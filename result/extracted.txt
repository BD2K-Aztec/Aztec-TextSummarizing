introduction using software tools developed by the bioinformatics community presents several challenges, beginning with the installation of the software itself and its dependencies.	0
Reproduction of computational results by others faces the challenge of frequent modifications in either the implementation of the algorithm itself or in one of its dependencies, or both ().	0
Although code sharing is possible through online code repositories like git hub it is hard to share the entire computational environment that a given software implementation of an algorithm depends on investigated the two main approaches to overcome these issues.	0
A more recent approach to solve this problem is to use software containers, particularly Docker, an open source technology used to package applications and their dependencies into a standardized software container showed that using Docker will overcome the problems related to dependency, documentation inaccuracy and code changes.	0

For example, obtaining the Bayesian probabilities for each gene in each cell cycle experiment by rustic i may take about 4 hours in SAS  Version 9.2 on a 3.00 GHz PC with Intel  Core TM 2 Duo CPU and 3.25 GM of RAM PC; however, first, considering the limited resources both in terms of financial and human resources, a more sensitive and specific gene list for further small scale studies should not be sacrificed for obtaining such a list rapidly.	0

Availability and Implementation: The pdb redo database and links to all software are available at http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/pdb_redo.
.	0
Over decades, a diverse community of crystallogr a phers has optimized these models to fit the experimental data using the software and computers available at their time.	0
Due to lack of attention and time, and also sometimes because of simple ignorance or even incompetence, some models that are submitted in the PDB are of lower quality than what could be expected given the advent of crystallographic methods and the outstanding tools that are available.	0
At the same time, older structure models start to lag behind in structure quality, since the current software was not available at the time of their deposition.	0
All these algorithms suggest that many features of models already in the PDB are likely wrong, but no automated mechanism currently exists to decide if a better modeling of specific areas would be better consistent with the validation criteria, correct these errors where applicable and make the new, corrected models available to the user community.	0

Availability: The algorithm has been included to S–MART, a versatile tool box for rnase q analysis, freely available at http://urgi.versailles.	0
Many mapping tools are now available and research is active on this topic.	0
Every efficient algorithm requires a dedicated data structure, such as an indexed database, an indexed flat file [such as a BAM file (, an r tree or nc lists (nested containment lists) ().	0
With the notable exception of the f join algorithm (), almost all the algorithms previously described only get all the reference intervals that overlap with one given query interval: most algorithms have been designed to retrieve all the intervals a user can see when he selects a given window in a genome browser ().	0
All together, the algorithm takes O#R log r  #Q log q  #M.	0
Although the complexity of the whole algorithm is not better than already known algorithms, the runtime complexity is significantly lower than other constant space algorithms.	0
However, this step is done only once and is far from un tractable (the sam tools sort algorithm is used routinely to sort BAM files).	0
While this algorithm presents a theoretical interest by itself, we also encapsulated it in the SMART tool box, which includes all the features to handle usual file formats.	0

Several publishers already ask for model source code to be made available along with the written paper (including Oxford journals, BMC journals, PLoS journals or the FEBS journal).	0
Consequently, the availability of every model version used in a simulation experiment is a major requirement to ensure reproducibility of results.	0
However, current approaches are appropriate for software code rather than model files.	0
The standard algorithms that are to date implemented perform poorly on xml encoded models.	0
We argue that the implementation of tools that identify and highlight differences between models enables researchers to reflect on model changes, which in turn has considerable value for the development of new models.	0
A consolidated view of all these factors indicates that a sophisticated model VCS is missing in current software tools.	0
For example, on discovering that a model has solely been updated to a new version of SBML, a user may decide to keep the older version of the model until his software is updated to support the new format specification.	0
Here, we have identified the following requirements for an improved system 1 An xml aware algorithm for difference detection should be used: Moving from LCS to entity based algorithms for XML version control is a first step towards a more efficient model VCS.	0

.	0
Algorithms for prediction of intermolecular structure generally build upon single stranded folding algorithms and come in two main types: free energy minimization and partition function calculations.	0
To get around these challenges, there has been a focus on the development of algorithms that predict only specific types of RNA RNA interactions.	0
It is necessary to develop a generalized algorithm for the reliable prediction of intermolecular binding sites of unknown structure class.	0
The first algorithm, density min computes the minimum free energy density structure or the structure with the lowest ratio of folding free energy change to number of nucleotides in the bimolecular structure.	0
This pseudo energy penalty model for accounting for accessibility was also incorporated into the free energy density minimization algorithm described above to test any synergistic improvement.	0
A set of 17 systems with known bimolecular structures was assembled for benchmarking, and the performance of pseudo energy minimization was compared to multiple variations of free energy minimization, partition function calculation and combination algorithms designed to predict rna rna interactions: BiFold, duplex fold bi partition and max expect from rna structure (); rna plex and rna up from the Vienna package () and b indigo from the a alberts lab ().	0
BiFold, duplex fold and rna plex are variations of free energy minimization algorithms.	0
discussion a major barrier to the development of general algorithms addressing the rna rna interaction prediction problem is a limited number of experimentally determined bimolecular structures.	0
Although algorithms addressing specific biological problems have been successful, particularly in predicting miRNA binding sites, it is necessary to develop a general algorithm for newly discovered nc rnas.	0
In this approach, a pseudo energy term is incorporated into the free energy minimization algorithm.	0
A set of 17 known bimolecular structures was compiled for testing, and the performance of pseudo energy minimization was compared to multiple variations of free energy minimization, partition function calculation and combination algorithms designed to predict rna rna interactions.	0
pseudo energy minimization provides a statistically significant increase in sensitivity when compared to the prior best available algorithm for considering self structure rna up.	0
The scaling factor, c, also accounts for the fact that the pseudo free energy is treating the un pairing probabilities of each nucleotide as independent.	0

Motivation: Extensive DNA sequencing of tumor and matched normal samples using exo me and whole genome sequencing technologies has enabled the discovery of recurrent genetic alterations in cancer cells, but variability in stromal contamination and sub clonal heterogen-eity still present a severe challenge to available detection algorithms.	0
Results: Here, we describe publicly available software, Shimmer, which accurately detects somatic single nucleotide variants using statistical hypothesis testing with multiple testing correction.	0
This program produces somatic single nucleotide variant predictions with significantly higher sensitivity and accuracy than other available software when run on highly contaminated or heterogeneous samples, and it gives comparable sensitivity and accuracy when run on samples of high purity.
.	0
introduction the development of next generation DNA sequencing methods has led to a rapid increase in the availability of high quality sequence data from large numbers of tumor samples, some with matched samples from the same individuals' blood or unaffected tissue ().	0
Available software for detecting differences between samples often provides little guidance with regard to how deep coverage needs to be to attain the user's required sensitivity and accuracy.	0
Implemented in a publicly available software tool, Shimmer, the algorithm yields highly accurate and sensitive calls on matched tumor and normal sequence, even in the presence of large amounts of stromal contamination, heterogeneity and copy number alteration, and even without any post filtering of ss nv calls.

Furthermore, another challenge is to develop software solutions, the scoring functions of which allow the rotation around torsional degrees of freedom of the flexible ligands and side chains of receptors.	0
An example of these software packages is auto dock (), a C toolbox, which has become the most cited and one of the most used software packages in molecular modeling studies, and also an efficient tool for virtual drug screening, which has been applied in real cases that involve flexibility ().	0
In this context, this article proposes a software platform oriented to provide a set of meta heuristic techniques allowing molecular docking problems to be optimized.	0
Our approach has been to integrate auto dock with j metal an object oriented framework for multi-objective optimization with metaheuristics (), which has become one of the most popular software tools in the field.	0
The original j metal software is written in Java script, so we have built a C implementation from scratch called j metal cpp (http://jmetalcpp.sourceforge.net), the idea being to achieve a clean and efficient integration with auto dock 4.2.	0
By doing this, the resulting platform can benefit, on the one hand, the biologists interested in applying other algorithms than those provided by auto dock to solve their target problems.	0
Furthermore, j metal cpp can be considered a useful tool for advanced users (or developers) with little C knowledge, who can implement new meta heuristic techniques that can be integrated into this framework with relative ease.	0

Availability: The snp rank code is open source and available at
.	0
In the development process of snp rank we attempted to systematically address some of the typical implementation issues facing bioinformatic ists plus emerging issues introduced by GPU.	0
Thus, with the availability of GPUs and the numerical improvements made to Matlab and Python by third party developers, we find it important to address implementation comparisons of snp rank in a manner that accounts for all aspects of the computation.	0
discussion by default, the third party numerical libraries NumPy and jbl as employ a single threaded approach, which allows a nave CPU implementation to be easily outperformed by GPU.	0
In contrast, Python and Java require some additional effort to take advantage of external numeric libraries, particularly for multithreaded implementations.	0
Unlike Matlab, both Java and Python are freely available and open source.	0
Thus, cost and skill level are determining factors for the appropriate language used to implement algorithms and develop bioinformatics tools.	0
A related benefit of their larger developer communities is that both Python and Java have more third party tools and libraries, compared with Matlab.	0
Moreover, while Jacket facilitates the conversion of Matlab code to GPU, this implementation actually showed slightly slower overall execution time.	0

======Foldalign 25 multithreaded implementation for pairwise.txt========
Availability and implementation: The fold align software and the web server are available at
.	0
fold align () is a tool that explicitly carries out local pairwise structural alignment of RNA sequences based on the Sankoff algorithm ().	0
The relevancy of a parallel version of the pairwise Sankoff algorithm is underpinned by its time complexity of OL 6 , where L is the sequence length.	0
All these heuristics can be used in a parallel version of the algorithm, which we address here, providing new opportunities for both large scale analysis as well as case based analyses through a web interface.
.	0
One great advantage of the multithreaded version is that it allows for better exploitation of the available hardware when the number of jobs which can run on a given machine is smaller than the number of cores available in the machine due to memory constraints.	0
With the previous version of the algorithm it is necessary to let the extra cores run idle, but now they can be put to use.	0


======Accurate estimation of short read mapping.txt========
Motivation: Several software tools specialize in the alignment of short next generation sequencing reads to a reference sequence.	0
Approach: We develop a machine learning tool, lo qum (LOgistic regression tool for calibrating the Quality of short read mappings, to assign reliable mapping quality scores to mappings of Illumina reads returned by any alignment tool.	0
lo qum uses statistics on the read (base quality scores reported by the sequencer) and the alignment (number of matches, mismatches and deletions, mapping quality score returned by the alignment tool, if available, and number of mappings) as features for classification and uses simulated reads to learn a logistic regression model that relates these features to actual mapping quality.	0
Results: We test the predictions of lo qum on an independent dataset generated by the ART short read simulation software and observe that lo qum can resurrect many mappings that are assigned zero quality scores by the alignment tools and are therefore likely to be discarded by researchers.	0
Availability: lo qum is available as open source at
.	0
conclusion in this article, we show that a machine learning framework that uses a combination of read and alignment statistics as classification features and simulated reads as training data to predict mapping accuracy can improve on mapping quality scores reported by available tools.	0

The classifier error is likely to be smaller when the sampling ratio r is close to c.	0
Hence, if one happens to fix r sufficiently close to c, then E" n jr5 E" n .	0
Because r ! c in probability as n ! 1 for mixed sampling, as n gets larger the distribution of r gets more tightly concentrated around c, so that the distribution of E" n jr (as function of r) gets more tightly packed around E" n , which in turn means that to have E" n jr5 E" n  one must choose r very close to c.	0

Results: INSPEcT is an R package for the integrative analysis of rna and 4sU-seq data to study the dynamics of transcriptional regulation.	0
A similar method was described for the inference of synthesis and degradation rates, lacking a corresponding software implementation ().	0
This method was extensively described in the publication but no software implementation was released.	0
At the moment of this publication, the method described in was extended to distinguish between constant and varying processing rates and a software implementation was released (DRiLL) ().	0
The software currently available has major limitations in terms of both documentation and implementation, and lacks functionalities to test its performance and provide guidance on the most suitable experimental design.	0

======On representative and illustrative comparisons with.txt========
In a few words, we fully comply with the claim of the authors that everybody (users and algorithm makers) suffers from the trend observed in bioinformatics toward the publication of many new algorithms without proper comparison between these algorithms.	0
The two underlying main ideas behind this claim are that (i) comparison studies comparing a new algorithm with existing algorithms are often severely biased for different reasons, as documented in our empirical study based on the example of supervised classification with high dimensional data (); simply, when reading articles on new methods, most of us think 'well, of course they say their method is better, but.	0
.'; and (ii) as stressed by, an extensive and fair comparison study requires a lot of work, care and attention in itself (, b) and can hardly be conducted within a study focused on another problem the development of a new algorithm.	0

======Consensus Genotyper for Exome Sequencing CGES.txt========
Motivation: The development of cost effective next generation sequencing methods has spurred the development of high throughput bioinformatics tools for detection of sequence variation.	0
With many disparate variant calling algorithms available, investigators must ask, Which method is best for my data? Machine learning research has shown that so called ensemble methods that combine the output of multiple models can dramatically improve classifier performance.	0
Here we describe a novel variant calling approach based on an ensemble of variant calling algorithms, which we term the Consensus genotype r for exo me Sequencing c ges.	0
c ges uses a two stage voting scheme among four algorithm implementations.	0
While our ensemble method can accept variants generated by any variant calling algorithm , we used GATK2.8, sam tools free bayes and atlas snp2 in building c ges because of their performance, widespread adoption and diverse but complementary algorithms.	0
c ges yielded the fewest total variant calls (N c ges =139 897), the highest ts tv ratio (3.02), the lowest Mendelian error rate across all genotypes (0.028%), the highest rediscovery rate from the exo me Variant Server (EVS; 89.3%) and 1000 Genomes (1KG; 84.1%) and the highest positive predictive value (PPV; 96.1%) for a random sample of previously validated de novo variants.	0
We describe these and other quality control (QC) metrics from consensus data and explain how the c ges pipeline can be used to generate call sets of varying quality stringency, including consensus calls present across all four algorithms , calls that are consistent across any three out of four algorithms , calls that are consistent across any two out of four algorithms or a more liberal set of all calls made by any algorithm.	0
Availability and implementation: To enable accessible, efficient and reproducible analysis, we implement c ges both as a stand-alone command line tool available for download in git hub and as a set of Galaxy tools and workflows configured to execute on parallel computers.

In recent years, several methods have been developed to analyze raw WES data, including atlas snp2 (), g atk (), seq em (), free bayes (), sam tools (), din del soap snp () and Varscan2 (), among others.	0

We chose to base our consensus based pipeline on GATKv2.8, sam tools Altas-SNP2 and free bayes as these *To whom correspondence should be addressed.	0

c ges also harmonizes quality scores from each algorithm to provide QC reports and publication quality plots cg esq c tool).	0
We use the Galaxy platform () to combine implementations for each branch of the pipeline and for c ges itself.	0
We use the results of this study to demonstrate the power of the c ges approach and provide project level variant level sample level and family based quality metrics across all algorithms.	0
discussion we have presented a novel variant calling approach based on an ensemble of variant calling algorithms, which we call c ges.	0
c ges uses a two stage voting scheme among four algorithm implementations to identify variant sites and determine genotypes.	0
We provide project based sample based and variant based quality metrics across all algorithms, as well as an estimate of the PPV of each algorithm and c ges.	0
Finally, we provide a galaxy based implementation of c ges and its constituent parts.	0

.	0
Here, we introduce TRanslational ONCOlogy (TRONCO), an R package built to infer cancer progression models from heterogeneous genomic data (in the form of alterations persistently present along tumor evolution.) Currently, TRONCO provides the implementation of two algorithms: (i) CAncer PRogression Extraction with Single Edges (CAPRESE) () and (ii) CAncer PRogression Inference (CAPRI) (), both based on Suppes' theory of probabilistic causation (), but with distinct goals and properties (see Section 2).	0
TRONCO, in its current form and perspective, should be thought of as a tool that provides the implementation of up-to-date solutions to the progression inference problem.	0
From the complementary perspective, TRONCO can also exploit the CAPRESE algorithm to infer the clonal evolutionary history in single patients when multiple samples are available, as in the case of multiple biopsies and or single cell sequencing data, as long as the set of driver events is selected; see).
.	0
The implemented algorithms are demonstrably the state of the art for the progression inference problem, in terms of computational cost, scalability with respect to sample size, accuracy and robustness against noise in the data.	0
The implementation makes straightforward the interaction of TRONCO with other common bioinformatics tools, possibly allowing the creation of a common suite of tools for cancer progression inference.	0

This is aggravated by the fact that the requirements change often and the software tools are constantly evolving.	0
In the context of bioinformatics, there are several frameworks to help implement data processing pipelines; although a full comparison is beyond the scope of this article, we mention a few that relate to our work: (i) snake make (K  oster and) written as a Python domain specific language (DSL), which has a strong influence from 'make' command.	0
This approach tends to spread the pipeline structure throughout the code, making maintenance cumbersome (), which is also written as a Python library, expresses pipelines as graphs 'drawn' using ASCII characters.	0
(iv) b pipe () is implemented as a DSL on top of Groovy, a Java Virtual Machine jvm based language.	0
BDS runs on any unix like environment (we currently provide Linux and OS.X pre-compiled binaries) and can be ported to other operating systems where a Java runtime and a GO compiler are available.	0
BDS is not as powerful as Java or Python, and our simple interpreter can not be compared with sophisticated justin time execution or jvm optimized bytecode execution provided by other languages.	0

Previously, we developed stand-alone software called gen clip () that annotated gene functions with free terms and generated gene co occurrence networks related to free terms.	0
However, gen clip had three distinct disadvantages: (i) the free terms were limited to single words, (ii) the gene network was constructed based on genes co mentioned in the same abstracts, often leading to high false positives and (iii) the analysis period generally took 2 weeks, and most of the time was spent on literature download.	0
Thus, we have developed gen clip 2.0, a web server that inherits the advantages of gen clip and extends it by incorporating five new features: (i) good performance in gene recognition, with f measure rising from 0.72 to 0.828, (ii) expansion of free terms to phrases, (iii) molecular interaction extraction accuracy of nearly 90%, (iv) search genes related to free terms and (v) complete analysis in minutes.

Biological networks, which can be derived from experimental data or downloaded from publicly available databases, are an increasingly important data structure in life science research.	0
* To whom correspondence should be addressed there are already some tools available which support the analysis of network central ities.	0

the human genome) has different overall objectives and hence represents a different challenge to the development of alignment tools.	0
The majority of currently available long read alignment algorithms may be classified as either using hash table indexing, like in BLAT () or in SSAHA2 (), or using some sort of compressed trie indexing based on Burrows Wheeler transform (BWT) (), for example, in bwt sw () or in b was w ().	0
The algorithm is designed to combine the advantages of both has hand trie based algorithms.	0
The overall complexity of the algorithms is bounded by the complexity of the local hit table building step, that is O(2 k q) (where q is the query length) or O(256q) for k = 8 used in prototype implementation, hence it does not depend on the size r of the reference.	0

XiP allows the construction of workflows by linking components written in both R and Java, the analysis of high throughput data in grid engine systems and also the development of customized pipelines that can be encapsulated in a package and distributed.	0
For example, a simple workflow to investigate genes potentially related to cancer might begin with microarray image analysis, normalization, statistical tests to identify differentially expressed genes between the normal and the tumor tissues followed by a multiple test p value correction have described that pipelines must satisfy at least three characteristics: (i) flexibility: a software can be used to analyze different data sets that may require different analysis tools; (ii) integrability: a system should provide the framework to facilitate data integration of analysis results from different tools; and (iii) extensibility: a system needs to allow for the inclusion of new tools in a modular fashion.	0
At, there is a list of components and a tool to search for a specific algorithm.	0
the pipelines are composed of an ordered sequence of components, one must replace only the different components to adapt the pipeline to a new data set.(2) Integrability: Components written in both R and Java programming languages run on XiP.	0
Internally, XiP translates the R data structures into Java structures, thus allowing the connection of packages available at the R web page (http://www.r-project.org) and the BioJava project ().(3) Extensibility: R and Java functions developed by different groups can automatically be translated to a XiP component and included in the platform.	0
The integration with grid engines makes XiP suitable for individual researchers with modest data sizes as well as for big collaborative projects with large amounts of data 5 Interoperability: Owing to several different pipeline platforms available in the literature such as Pegasus (), Kepler () and Galaxy (), each one with unique advantages, it would be interesting whether one platform could integrate components developed in different environments.	0
Summing up, the main advantages of XiP are (i) it satisfies all the five characteristics for a pipeline platform; (ii) components developed in the Galaxy platform can be converted to XiP components; and (iii) stand-alone packages created under XiP can be run outside the XiP environment.	0

introduction the number of available bioinformatics tools has grown dramatically over the past two decades.	0
However, as a result of increasing complexity of the tools and a lack of rigorous software engineering practices, using, installing and configuring a bioinformatics application, along with ensuring that it is communicating well with other programs, can be a challenging task.	0
Moreover, a large number of computational methods and tools are available only as source code packages, command line utilities which can run only in a linux unix environment, web services (), or programming libraries (), and can not be easily accessed by biologists who do not have the necessary skills.	0
Good examples of such tools are the Artemis genome browser (), Jalview multiple alignment editor (), Tablet () and IGV () next generation sequencing data visualization packages.	0
Applications such as Galaxy () or Taverna () solve communication issues between tools by providing easily accessible capabilities to manage bioinformatics workflows, but still require significant effort to set up on a local server.	0

Source code and binary packages are available from https://github.com/bioclipse and http://www.bioclipse.net/bioclipse-r, respectively.
.	0
introduction bio clipse () and R (R Development Core) are free and open source software systems for the life sciences and for statistics, respectively.	0
The R package rcd k adds core cheminformatics functionality to R but is not focused on providing a rich graphical user experience with functionality for editing and visualizing chemical data in 2D and 3D.	0
Other tools for integrating R in graphical user interfaces with applications in biology and chemistry include the workflow tools Konstanz Information Miner kni me () and Taverna ().	0
These provide nodes in a workflow that are capable of containing R code, but they are focused on constructing reproducible workflows and do not expose R in a workbench environment where it can be used programmatically and in combination with other tools in a more investigative fashion.	0
In contrast to these tools, bio clips er integrates R with the rich client bio clipse and, thus, provides cross fertilization between R and all other functionality in bio clipse for example, advanced visualizations, help systems and semantic data management ().	0
Constructing this system without the integration between bio clipse and R would require extensive efforts of copying data between various software tools and file formats, but is almost trivial with bio clips er.	0

Results: We have developed a BioConductor package, ADaCGH2, that parallelize s the main segmentation algorithms (using for king on multicore computers or parallelization via message passing interface, etc., in clusters of computers) and uses ff objects for reading and data storage.	0
Availability and implementation: ADaCGH2 is an R package available from BioConductor.	0
Version 2.3.11 or higher is available from the development branch
.	0
introduction current studies of genomic copy number alterations (CNA) are using platforms with several million probes per array and several thousand subjects (e.g.), but the canonical implementations of the widely used open source packages for the analysis of CNA data did not allow for parallelized execution of the analysis.	0
Moreover, especially for r bioconductor software, the available packages will not be able to analyze big datasets if these are larger than about a quarter to a half of the available memory (unless one uses time consuming and ad hoc, manual partition of the input and subsequent recombination of the output see discussion in Section 'Why ADaCGH2 instead of a ''manual'' solution' in the vignette of the package).	0
I leverage on two R packages, parallel, part of the standard set of R packages, and ff (), and combine them, to provide the following: Parallelized analysis.	0
Input from, and output to, other BioConductor packages here I present the main functions of the package, the differences with former version and some benchmarks.	0
the code has been rewritten to use for king data handling and reading of input data has been completely modified so that data much larger than available memory can be read and analyzed and missing value handling has been changed to use all available data per array.	0
The new version can read datasets much larger than the old one and datasets much larger than available memory (see details in Section 3).	0
The new version deals with missing values array by array, so for each array (or column) all available data (or probes) are used in the segmentation.	0
In POSIX operating systems (including Unix, GNU/Linux and Mac OS), for king can be faster, less memory consuming and much easier to use than a cluster.	0
The new version of ADaCGH2 has not removed the mechanisms of reading data available in the old version (when data are small or memory is plentiful, reading data from a single r data is an available option) and accepts data read by the former version.	0
These differences in implementation, however, do not affect the underlying core code for the algorithms, which is the same as in the previous version.	0

======NGS a library for rapid prototyping.txt========
Motivation: The development of computational tools to enable testing and analysis of high throughput sequencing data is essential to modern genomics research.	0
However, although multiple frameworks have been developed to facilitate access to these tools, comparatively little effort has been made at implementing low level programming libraries to increase the speed and ease of their development.	0
By standardizing the internal data structures and presenting a common interface to the data parser, NGSþþ offers an effective framework for epi genomics tool development.	0
Source code, tests, code examples and documentation are available via the website at http://www.ngsplusplus.ca and the git hub repository at https://github.com/NGS-lib/NGSplusplus.

Although certain tool suites, such as bed tools () and bam tools (), offer a library or API to assist developers, these are generally aimed at giving access to the existing tool functionality rather than facilitating development of new ones.	0
conclusion progress in the development of advanced bioinformatics analysis tools has undoubtedly been hindered by the lack of available programming frameworks.	0

In this study, we aim at comparing the predictive performance of eight publicly available prioritization tools on novel data.	0
In the past few years, many gene prioritization methods have been proposed, some of which have been implemented into publicly available tools that users can freely access and use ().	0
In this study, we aim at comparing the performance of several freely accessible web based gene prioritization tools on novel data, which, to our knowledge, has never been performed before.	0
It has to be mentioned that we compare tools and not the underlying algorithms (we see a tool as an algorithm plus some data sources), because this is what is most relevant to geneticists.
.	0
discussion we aim at assessing the usefulness of eight gene prioritization tools that are freely available via web applications.	0
This is different from the other tools for which missing genes basically correspond to genes that are not recognized by the tool (it happens most of the time with poorly characterized genes, such as C20orf54).	0
Indeed, each tool can perform better than all the others for some cases, or, in other words, none of the tools outperforms another on the complete dataset (if we do not consider the special case of pos med that also acts as a filter).	0
Therefore an in depth comparison of the implementation of the tools is beyond the scope of this study.	0

There are some R packages which provide a subset of these desirable features.	0
For example, SPRINT () provides a new framework for parallelizing classification algorithms in R, but requires new classification functions to be coded in C or Fortran.	0

For the mouse skin control dataset, running sparc c with 1000 bootstraps on a cluster of 20 cores of Intel Westmere X5650 processors (2.66 GHz, 4 GB memory per core) requires more than 10.5 h, whereas running re bacca with B  500 (equivalent to 1000 bootstraps) on the same cluster takes only about 30 min.	0
A fast implementation of sparc c reduces the computing time ().	0

There are a number of programs available for rnase q alignment gives a breakdown of the alignment algorithms used in a random sample of 130 papers listed on PubMed that have rnase q in the abstract (see Supplementary Table 1 for detailed information).	0
Currently, five algorithms are available that satisfy these three criteria: top hat () g snap (), map splice (), splice map () and soap soap als ().	0
rnase q data page 2519 25182528 are discrete in nature; therefore, as long as good gene models are available, it is possible to simulate rnase q data that is sufficiently realistic to allow for meaningful benchmarking of alignment algorithms.	0

The computationally demanding components of the SPADE algorithm are implemented in C using OpenMP to enable multi-threaded execution.	0
As shown in, the combination of a careful C implementation and multi-threaded execution results in a substantial speed up relative to the prototype implementation.	0
If OpenMP is not available, as is often the case on the Windows platform, cyto spade will default to using a single core.	0
However, even in single threaded mode, the C implementation offers a significant performance improvement for SPADE users.	0
conclusion cyto spade is a high performance modular and cross platform implementation of the SPADE algorithm and an accompanying graphical user interface.	0
Source code and binaries for cyto spade are available under the GPL license from http:// cyto spade org and as part of Bioconductor release 2.10 onwards.	0
Documentation, including the package vignette, wiki and getting started tutorials are also available at http://cytospade.org..	0
Structure (a) of cyto spade including the r package and the user interface (b) implemented as a Cytoscape plugin.	0
The R package can be used independently of the Cytoscape plugin.	0
Bar charts (c) show the performance of the multi-threaded R package on a dual socket Intel Xeon 2.27 GHz server with 12 GB of RAM for a variety of cytometry datasets and clustering parameters, including high dimensional mass cytometry datasets with millions of cells.

According to the cho us five step guidelines () and followed by many investigators in a series of recent publications (, b, c, d, e;), for developing a new prediction method that can be widely used by broad users, we should consider the following five points: (i) how to construct or select a valid benchmark dataset to train and test the predictor; (ii) how to formulate the biological sequence samples with an effective mathematical expression that can truly reflect their essential correlation with the target concerned; (iii) how to introduce or develop a powerful algorithm (or engine) to run the prediction; (iv) how to properly conduct cross validation tests to objectively evaluate the anticipated accuracy; (v) how to provide a web server and user guide to make people very easily to get their desired results.	0

The point is that r can not be reasonably used as an estimate of c taken from esfahan i and Dougherty, 2014) illustrates the effects of separate sampling on the expected true classifier error for two classification rules and multivariate Gaussian distributions of equal and unequal covariance structures and dimensionality d = 3.	0
For a given sample size n, sampling ratio r, and classification rule, the expected true error rate E" n jr is plotted for different class prior probabilities c, for LDA and a non-linear radial basis function support vector machine rbf svm.	0
We observe that the expected error is close to minimal when r = c and that it can greatly increase when r 6  c.	0
We will see that for a separate sampling ratio r not close to c there can be large bias, optimistic or pessimistic.	0
Whereas the expected true error of the designed classifier grows large when r greatly deviates from c, a large optimistic cross validation bias when r is far from c can obscure the large error and leave one with the illusion of good performance and this illusion is not mitigated by large samples! To overcome the bias problem for classical cross validation with separate sampling, we introduce a new cross validation estimator designed for separate sampling and prove that it satisfies a bias property analogous to (1).

This crisp r array is transcribed and processed into multiple mature RNA species c rrnas.	0
A single c rrna is integrated into an interference complex, together with crisp r associated (Cas) proteins, to bind and degrade invading nucleic acids.	0
Although existing bioinformatics tools can recognize crisp r loci by their characteristic repeat spacer architecture, they generally output crisp r arrays of ambiguous orientation and thus do not determine the strand from which c rrnas are processed.	0
Results: We present a fast and accurate tool to determine the c rrna encoding strand at crisp r loci by predicting the correct orientation of repeats based on an advanced machine learning approach.	0
We integrated crisp r strand predictions into our crisp r map web server of crisp r conservation and updated the latter to version 2.0.	0

The adaptive immune response of all types is divided into three major phases: (i) adaptation, the uptake of DNA fragments from genetic elements and their insertion between consecutive repeats of a crisp r array, generally adjacent to a leader sequence; (ii) processing of the crisp r array transcripts within the repeats to generate small c rrnas that derive from part or all of each spacer region and (iii) interference involving targeting and cleavage of an invading genetic element, or its transcripts, by Cas protein c rrna complexes barran gou and van der Oost, 2013, and).	0
We developed an efficient tool for determining the strand from which mature c rrnas are derived by focussing on the repeats at crisp r loci.	0
However, to date very few systems have been studied experimentally, and many large scale studies require accurate orientation information for all available crisp r arrays.	0
recently has presented the first tool to predict the orientation of crisp r arrays.	0
Thus, we consider that the repeat orientation tool presented here will be of critical importance for future crisp r based experimental studies.

Powerful selection queries and the notion of entity views to represent these selections greatly facilitate the development and implementation of algorithms on structural data.	0
The modular integration of computational core methods with powerful visualization tools makes open structure an ideal working and development environment.	0
Several applications, such as the latest versions of i plt and q mean have been implemented based on open structure demonstrating its value for the development of next generation structural biology algorithms.	0

introduction we introduce open structure a flexible software framework for computational structural biology, a solid, yet flexible and versatile toolkit for rapid prototyping of new methods as well as their productive implementation.	0
Typically, method development in structural bioinformatics involves combining different independent software tools, and significant effort is devoted to writing code for input output operations and format conversions between different packages.	0
Several software tools and frameworks are available today for molecular modeling, e.g.	0
open structure is a flexible software framework tailored for computational structural biology, which combines a C++ based library of commonly used functionality with a Python layer and powerful visualization tools.	0
While PyMol and VMD also combine a scripting environment with sophisticated visualization tools, they are primarily geared toward visualization and less on providing a clean application programmer interface (API) that is easy to use and allows for rapid development of new algorithms.	0
This allows for rapid visually enhanced prototyping of new functionality, making open structure an ideal environment for the development of next generation structural biology algorithms.	0

Availability and implementation: http://kpax.loria.fr/.
.	0
Efficient pattern matching algorithms such as fast a () and BLAST () are now standard tools for searching nucleotide and amino acid sequence databases.	0
These algorithms can often be classified according to how they use the internal geometries of proteins to calculate interatomic distances (;) or cliques of distances (), interatomic C vectors (), or triplets of C atoms (), torsion angles (), or combinations of distances and angles ().	0
Although we implemented sse dependent gap penalties initially to improve database retrieval performance, we find that using such penalties together with our Gaussian scoring function tends to produce alignments with smaller numbers of aligned residues but with somewhat tighter 3D overlays of SSEs than the other alignment algorithms studied here.	0
conclusion we have presented k pax a novel protein structure alignment and superposition algorithm that uses multiple C coordinate systems and a Gaussian peptide fragment scoring scheme to provide a sensitive structural similarity score.	0
Nonetheless, with the number of solved protein structures growing ever more rapidly, we believe the publicly available k pax program will provide a useful tool for high throughput comparisons of 3D protein structures.

introduction developing new bioinformatics tools, both computational and experimental, such as those for membrane protein type prediction (), protein subcellular location prediction (), drug target interaction prediction (), substrate enzyme product triad network prediction (), and so on, can timely provide very useful information and insights for both basic research and drug development and hence are widely welcome by the science community.	0
In 2-DE, image analysis software is required for objective and quantitative comparison of 2-DE spot patterns, and several software packages are commercially available.	0
In comparison with the other software packages tested, the proposed method is shown to be able to detect the majority of validated protein spots in a series of gel images, while at the same time minimizing the number of false positives.	0
Other software packages also give slightly different results, but again, it is not possible to say from this type of analysis which is the 'correct' answer.	0

======MeDuSa a multidraft based scaffolder.txt========
Availability and implementation: MEDUSA web server:
.	0
Currently available methods software include SOPRA (), SCARPA (), MIP (), Opera (), GRASS () and s space ().	0
These software differ in terms of their overall strategy and implementation but, in general, (i) they allow for only a single reference genome (); (ii) when multiple genomes are allowed, generally these have to be closed and (iii) a reference phylogeny accounting for the evolutionary relationships among the selected tax a is to be provided to guide a multi reference genomes based scaffolding ().	0
To overcome the difficulties that characterize currently available methods, we developed MEDUSA multi draft based scaffold er an algorithm for scaffolding draft genomes by ordering and orientating a set of de novo obtained contigs and thus speeding up genome finishing.	0
Unlike most of the other software, MEDUSA: (i) formalizes the scaffolding problem by means of a combinatorial optimization formulation on graphs and implements an efficient constant factor approximation algorithm to solve it; (ii) allows for multiple reference genomes to be used during scaffolding; (iii) does not require prior knowledge on the evolutionary relationships (i.e.	0

The availability of more efficient sequencing techniques, together with the growing number of genomes deposited on public databases, provides an ideal scenario for development of bioinformatics tools facilitating design of future experiments in this field.	0
Currently available tfbs s search tools can be grouped into two major approaches: (i) Motif discovery: tfbs s are inferred by analyzing a group of sequences that are considered to be under the regulation of a particular transcription factor (TF) and (ii) Motif search: to determine the location where a TF is more likely to bind by searching its corresponding TFBS over sequence datasets.	0
Importantly, most of these tools do not allow implementation of rules regarding the relationships between the individual tfbs s of a particular CRM ().	0
There are several ways of achieving this comparison, as seen in the implementation of tools such as cp module motif viz and Cluster Buster.	0
The ability to perform analyses that are usually difficult, or not possible, with most of the available tools, because they are not available fully as web servers, command line programs are difficult to use or they do not offer the INSECT web server functionality, demonstrates the advantages of having an integrated motif search tool.

======PyRosetta a scriptbased interface for implementing.txt========
py rosetta is a stand-alone python based implementation of the Rosetta molecular modeling package that allows users to write custom structure prediction and design algorithms using the major Rosetta sampling and scoring functions.	0
Interactive mode contains a number of help features and is ideal for beginners while script mode is best suited for algorithm development.	0
py rosetta has similar computational performance to Rosetta, can be easily scaled up for cluster applications and has been implemented for algorithms demonstrating protein docking, protein folding, loop modeling and design.	0
Availability: py rosetta is a stand-alone package available at
.	0
Developing such algorithms requires extensive experience in both C++ programming and Rosetta software development, severely limiting its accessibility.	0
To make custom molecular modeling using Rosetta accessible to a broader community of structural biologists, we developed py rosetta a python based implementation of the Rosetta molecular modeling suite.	0
Our goal was to enable users to define a molecular modeling problem, design an algorithm to solve it and implement that algorithm on the computer using preexisting Rosetta objects and functions.	0
py rosetta can be run in two modes: interactive mode which contains tab completion and help features which are ideal for beginners, and script mode which is better suited for algorithm development.	0
We chose Python as the scripting language because it is a sophisticated programming language that enjoys widespread use in the biology community and allows py rosetta to be compatible with other python based packages such as PyMol () and Bio-Python ().	0
Our hope is that the extensive online communities of users of the many python based bioinformatics tools will help develop and share interfaces with py rosetta.	0
We used a number of tools to convert the classes and functions in the Rosetta C++ source code into a python accessible form.	0
gcc xml () parses the classes and functions of the Rosetta C++ code into an XML representation using the GCC compiler.	0
The Py++ package (Language Binding) uses the gcc xml objects and generates Python bindings using the boost python library ().	0
The scripts are portable and tested on Mac OSX, Linux and Windows platforms.	0
The building process requires 46 h depending on the platform and the pre generated binary libraries are provided for download for all three platforms.	0
A version of py rosetta will be made available with each new release of Rosetta along with intermediate versions that add additional features, fix bugs, improve accessibility or expand documentation.	0

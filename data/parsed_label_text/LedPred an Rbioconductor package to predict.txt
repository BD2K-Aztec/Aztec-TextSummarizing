Supervised classification based on support vector machines (SVMs) has successfully been used for the prediction of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). However, no integrated tool using such heterogeneous data as position-specific scoring matrices, ChIP-seq data or conservation scores is currently available. Here, we present LedPred, a flexible SVM workflow that predicts new regulatory sequences based on the annotation of known CRMs, which are associated to a large variety of feature types. LedPred is provided as an R/Bioconductor package connected to an online ser-ver to avoid installation of non-R software. Due to the heterogeneous CRM feature integration, LedPred excels at the prediction of regulatory sequences in Drosophila and mouse datasets compared with similar SVM-based software. Availability and implementation: LedPred is available on GitHub: https:
IntroductionTranscriptional programs are tightly controlled by cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that control gene expression. CRMs are stretches of DNA that contain specific combinations of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and are often associated with histone modification or nucleosome-free regions (). A wellestablished strategy to predict CRMs is to analyze combinations of CRM features described above in a set of experimentally validated CRMs. Support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are appropriate for this task since they can learn sequence features that distinguish CRMs from background sequences. Existing tools (Supplementary) score sequences based on k-mer discovery (KIRMES,; k-mer-SVM Fletez), positionspecific scoring matrices (PSSMs) (CLARE,) or ChIP-seq data (). The DEEP tool theoretically integrates a large palette of features but is specific to mammals, does not return a model to score new sequences and is currently unavailable (). Here, we present an R/Bioconductor package based on the libsvm library (

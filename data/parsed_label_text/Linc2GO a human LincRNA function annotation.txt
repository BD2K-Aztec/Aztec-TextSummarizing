Large numbers of long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) have been detected through high-throughput sequencing technology. However, currently we still know very little about their functions. Therefore, a lincRNA function annotation database is needed to facilitate the study in this field. In this article, we present Linc2GO, a web resource that aims to provide comprehensive functional annotations for human lincRNA. MicroRNA-mRNA and microRNA-lincRNA interaction data were integrated to generate lincRNA functional annotations based on the competing endogenous RNA hypothesis. To the best of our knowledge, Linc2GO is the first database that makes use of the competing endogenous RNA hypoth-esis to predict lincRNA functions. Availability: Freely available at
INTRODUCTIONLong intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are endogenous long non-coding RNA molecules that transcribed from 'intergenic' regions of the genome. In recent years, as highthroughput sequencing technology developed, more and more lincRNA have been identified (). It has been demonstrated that lincRNAs play critical roles in regulating multiple important biological processes (). However, currently most lincRNAs are still poorly studied. Owing to the importance of lincRNA, it has become very necessary to develop computational tools to predict lincRNA functions. Previous researchers have proposed a 'co-expression-based' method to predict lincRNA functions and achieved many meaningful results (). That is, if a lincRNA is coexpressed with a protein-coding gene whose function is already known, then the lincRNA is predicted to take similar functions.In this article, we predict lincRNA functions in a rather different approach and present Linc2GO, a novel lincRNA function annotation database. Instead of using the co-expression information of lincRNA and protein coding-gene, our work is based on the competing endogenous RNA hypothesis (ceRNA hypothesis): lincRNA can function as microRNA 'sponge' to interact directly with microRNA and prevent them from binding to mRNA. In this way, lincRNA regulates gene expression and meanwhile regulates the biological processes in which they get involved in (). For example, MAML1 and MEF2C are two important transcription factors that activate muscle-specific gene expression. Marcellashowed that a lincRNA, linc-MD1, regulates muscle differentiation by interacting with two microRNAs, miR-135 and miR-133, which can bind to MAML1 and MEF2C to regulate their expressions (). Based on the above fact, it is natural to infer that if a lincRNA and an mRNA share some microRNAs that can interact with both of them, then the two have similar biological functions.

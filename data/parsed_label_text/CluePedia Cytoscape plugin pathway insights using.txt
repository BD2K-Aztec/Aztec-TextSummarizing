The CluePedia Cytoscape plugin is a search tool for new markers potentially associated to pathways. CluePedia calculates linear and non-linear statistical dependencies from experimental data. Genes, proteins and miRNAs can be connected based on in silico and/or experimental information and integrated into a ClueGO network of terms/pathways. Interrelations within each pathway can be investigated, and new potential associations may be revealed through gene/protein/miRNA enrichments. A pathway-like visualization can be created using the Cerebral plugin layout. Combining all these features is essential for data interpretation and the generation of new hypotheses. The CluePedia Cytoscape plugin is user-friendly and has an expressive and intuitive visualization. Availability: http://www.ici.upmc.fr/cluepedia/ and via the Cytoscape plugin manager. The user manual is available at the CluePedia
INTRODUCTIONIntegrating heterogeneous expression data and functional network information is essential for understanding cellular processes and their dynamics. Within the versatile framework of Cytoscape (), tools for ontology analysis () and gene function predictions () were developed. CluePedia provides a comprehensive view on a pathway or process by investigating experimental and in silico data from different perspectives: gene interrelations, miRNAs regulatory aspects, proteinprotein interactions, as well as the functional context, in conjunction with ClueGO ().

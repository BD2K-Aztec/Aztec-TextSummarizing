VarSim is a framework for assessing alignment and variant calling accuracy in high-throughput genome sequencing through simulation or real data. In contrast to simulating a random mutation spectrum, it synthesizes diploid genomes with germline and somatic mutations based on a realistic model. This model leverages information such as previously reported mutations to make the synthetic genomes biologically relevant. VarSim simulates and validates a wide range of variants, including single nucleotide variants, small indels and large structural variants. It is an automated, comprehensive compute framework supporting parallel computation and multiple read simulators. Furthermore, we developed a novel map data structure to validate read alignments, a strategy to compare variants binned in size ranges and a lightweight, interactive, graphical report to visualize validation results with detailed statistics. Thus far, it is the most comprehensive validation tool for secondary analysis in next generation sequencing. Availability and implementation: Code in Java and Python along with instructions to download the reads and variants is at
IntroductionDue to the lack of ground truth for real data, simulation is a common approach for the evaluation of high-throughput sequencing's secondary analysis, ranging from alignment to variant calling. An early attempt to perform validation without simulation is given in. However, their attempt involved extensive biological experiments and does not cover the full spectrum of variants.We present the first integrated pipeline that provides complete validation of secondary analysis through simulation as well as analysis with real data. Most tools simulate variants, but no single tool simulates the full spectrum of variants from small variants to all types of structural variations (SVs). RSVSim (

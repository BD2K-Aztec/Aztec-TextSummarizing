Motivation: Biochemical reaction networks in the form of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide a powerful modeling tool for understanding the dynamics of biochemical processes. During the early phase of modeling, scientists have to deal with a large pool of competing nonlinear models. At this point, discrimination experiments can be designed and conducted to obtain optimal data for selecting the most plausible model. Since biological ODE models have widely distributed parameters due to, e.g. biologic variability or experimental variations, model responses become distributed. Therefore, a robust optimal experimental design (OED) for model discrimination can be used to discriminate models based on their response probability distribution functions (PDFs). Results: In this work, we present an optimal control-based methodology for designing optimal stimulus experiments aimed at robust model discrimination. For estimating the time-varying model response PDF, which results from the nonlinear propagation of the parameter PDF under the ODE dynamics, we suggest using the sigma-point approach. Using the model overlap (expected likelihood) as a robust discrimination criterion to measure dissimilarities between expected model response PDFs, we benchmark the proposed nonlinear design approach against linearization with respect to prediction accuracy and design quality for two nonlinear biological reaction networks. As shown, the sigma-point outperforms the linearization approach in the case of widely distributed parameter sets and/or existing multiple steady states. Since the sigma-point approach scales linearly with the number of model parameter, it can be applied to large systems for robust experimental planning. Availability: An implementation of the method in MATLAB/AMPL is available at
INTRODUCTIONMathematical models of complex biological processes provide the basis for systems understanding. They are of vital importance for generating predictions of systems behavior based on hypothesized mechanisms. In the case of limited experimental access to biological systems, models can help to find missing links and provide a tool to aggregate existing knowledge and data. In this work, we focus on mathematical models in the form of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are being used to describe dynamics of biochemical reaction networks, e.g. signal transduction, metabolic or genetic regulation, on a deterministic, (semi-)mechanistic basis. Here, scientists are often facing limited or even contradicting knowledge about the underlying mechanisms, confined experimental possibilities, large biological variability as well as measurement noise. This leads to largely distributed model parameter sets, which in combination with several plausible alternative model structures renders model-based prediction highly uncertain. Therefore, model-based experimental design (e.g. optimal stimulus or additional experimental readout selection) is used to generate experiments that yield optimal experimental data to (i) reduce the spread in the model parameters (optimal parameter identification) and/or (ii) reduce the pool of plausible models (optimal model discrimination). Much work on optimal experimental stimulus design (OESD) for biological systems focuses on information maximization with respect to parameter identification (). Here, for a given pool of plausible ODE models, OESD is used to find experimental conditions that reduce the parameter uncertainties and thus model response variabilities. The methods used to quantify parameter uncertainties and model response variabilities include linearization, sigma-points (), profile likelihood () and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC,). An OESD aiming at model discrimination for biological systems has been addressed by few authors (). Although measurement noise has been included, a rigorous consideration of model response variabilities due to distributed parameters has been missing so far. For chemical reaction kinetics and biotechnology, there exists some work on designing dynamic stimuli for the purpose of model discrimination (). As has been illustrated, the consideration of model response variabilities strongly improves the designed experiments and experimental data quality (). Therefore, linearization of the system's parameter mapping has been used. However, by using the so-called Sigma-Point method (), (), () showed that the performance *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

An experimental design aimed at model discrimination is typically generated at a point where existing data do not provide further discriminative information for a pool of competing, validated and identifiable models. With these models, robust experimental designs can be generated, which presumably yield data with optimal discrimination information. Since predictions with ODE models depend on the model parameters, identifiability is important as it ensures the existence of a unique solution to the parameter estimation problem and, consequently, unique model predictions (). A non-identifiable model would yield non-unique model predictions under altered experimental design conditions, as there exists a set of several solutions to the parameter estimation problem. Robustness of the experimental design is achieved by considering (i) pure uncertainty about the model itself, (ii) distributed model predictions that arise from distributed model parameters and (iii) design variabilities (e.g. variations of the applied stimulus) during the conduction of the experiment. In this work, part (ii) of design robustification for nonlinear models is considered, focusing on computational efficient and accurate estimation of the nonlinear propagated parameter probability distribution function (PDF) in an optimal control framework. We suggest using the sigma-point method as an alternative to the classical linearization approach. Therefore, both approaches are presented, applied and compared in the light of OESD for robust model discrimination, assuming perfect experimental conduction. In the following section, we describe the essential parts of our design approach, including (i) ODE modeling of biological reaction networks with and extended interpretation of distributed determinism, (ii) the model overlap as a PDFbased discrimination criterion, (iii) linearization and sigma-point methods and (iv) two numerical approaches to solve optimal control problems. Then, using two numerical examples, we formulate the optimization problem and benchmark the linearization approach against the sigma-point approach (Section 3).
APPLICATION
CONCLUSIONBiological variability in combination with experimental measurement noise results into widely distributed response signals, which is one of the main challenges when modeling biological system deterministically with nonlinear ODEs. The parameter set needs to be extended to a parameter distribution. In this way, natural variability in the dynamic parameters as well as measurement noise can be readily accounted for. However, an exact quantification is computationally expensive and infeasible in an

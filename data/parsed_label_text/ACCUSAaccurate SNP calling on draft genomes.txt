Next generation sequencing technologies facilitate genome-wide analysis of several biological processes. We are interested in whole-genome genotyping. To our knowledge, none of the existing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) callers consider the quality of the reference genome, which is not necessary for high-quality assemblies of well-studied model organisms. However, most genome projects will remain in draft status with little to no genome assembly improvement due to time and financial constraints. Here, we present a simple yet elegant solution (ACCUSA) that considers both the read qualities as well as the reference genomes quality using a Bayesian framework. We demonstrate that ACCUSA is as good as the current SNP calling software in detecting true SNPs. More importantly, ACCUSA does not call spurious SNPs, which originate from a poor reference sequence.

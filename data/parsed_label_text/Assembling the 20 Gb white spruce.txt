White spruce (Picea glauca) is a dominant conifer of the boreal forests of North America, and providing genomics resources for this commercially valuable tree will help improve forest management and conservation efforts. Sequencing and assembling the large and highly repetitive spruce genome though pushes the boundaries of the current technology. Here, we describe a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy using two Illumina sequencing platforms and an assembly approach using the ABySS software. We report a 20.8 giga base pairs draft genome in 4.9 million scaffolds, with a scaffold N50 of 20 356 bp. We demonstrate how recent improvements in the sequen-cing technology, especially increasing read lengths and paired end reads from longer fragments have a major impact on the assembly contiguity. We also note that scalable bioinformatics tools are instrumental in providing rapid draft assemblies.

INTRODUCTIONThe assembly of short reads to develop genomic resources for non-model species remains an active area of development (). The feasibility of the approach and its scalability to large genomes was demonstrated by the ABySS publication () using human genome sequencing data and was later used to assemble the panda genome with the SOAPdenovo tool (). The technology provides high quality results, as demonstrated for bacteria (), and has been successfully applied numerous times on more complex genomes (). Estimated at 20 giga base pairs (Gb) (), sequencing and assembly of the genome of this gymnosperm species of the pine (Pinaceae) family present unique challenges. On the data generation end, those challenges include representation biases in whole-genome shotgun sequencing data, and difficulties in building reduced representation resources to scale down the magnitude of the problem. On the bioinformatics end, assembling massive sequencing datasets is extremely demanding on computing cycles, memory usage, storage requirements, and for parallel programming implementations on communication traffic. We addressed the data representation challenges by preparing and sequencing multiple whole-genome shotgun libraries on the HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq sequencers from Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA). Compared with localized sequencing protocols, such as building and sequencing fosmid libraries, or the recent approach of isolating $10 kb DNA strands to generate indexed sequencing fragments in high throughput (Moleculo, San Diego, CA, USA), a shotgun only sequencing approach rapidly provides sequence data effectively covering the target genome at a cost that can be an order of magnitude less. The difference in cost is especially substantial when sequencing a large genome. In this work, we demonstrate that shotgun sequence assembly at this scale remains viable and produces valuable results. To *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013.

The modular nature of the tool allowed us to execute a large number of tests to tune the message passing interface for a successful execution, train the assembly parameters for an optimal assembly and quantify the utility of long reads for large genome assemblies. To the best of our knowledge, the ABySS algorithm is unique in its ability to enable genome assemblies of this scale using whole-genome shotgun sequencing data.
CONCLUSIONThe choice between a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach and sequencing reduced representation libraries was extensively discussed during the Human Genome Project (), and the former became the dominant technology as the sequencing throughput rapidly increased, rendering library techniques to prepare data for the latter approach relatively expensive. A decade later, researchers studying conifer genomes are trying to answer the same question. In our study, we demonstrate that modern whole-genome shotgun sequencing and assembly methods can provide competitive draft genome assemblies at the multi-Gb scale for downstream biological studies in a cost-effective way, even if it is far from producing chromosome level contiguous sequence. We note that a rigorous assessment of the reported assembly is not a trivial undertaking and will need to be performed, as the assembly evolves from its draft stage toward a more established reference. For example, de novo assembly evaluation tools such as CGAL (), FRCbam () and ALE () would either not scale to the size of the problem or require substantial time and computational resources. Still, compared with previous targeted gene and genome subsampling studies, the assembly introduced in this article already gives the community considerably greater power to identify and study gymnosperm genes, to assist forest management strategies and to understand the environmental biological interactions that involve spruce trees at a basic level.

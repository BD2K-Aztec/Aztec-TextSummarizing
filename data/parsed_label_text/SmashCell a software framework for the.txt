Recent advances in single-cell manipulation technology, whole genome amplification and high-throughput sequencing have now made it possible to sequence the genome of an individual cell. The bioinformatic analysis of these genomes, however, is far more complicated than the analysis of those generated using traditional, culture-based methods. In order to simplify this analysis, we have developed SmashCell (Simple Metagenomics Analysis SHell-for sequences from single Cells). It is designed to automate the main steps in microbial genome analysis—assembly, gene prediction, functional annotation—in a way that allows parameter and algorithm exploration at each step in the process. It also manages the data created by these analyses and provides visualization methods for rapid analysis of the results.

INTRODUCTIONThe rapid evolution of DNA sequencing platforms has had a dramatic, beneficial impact on the study of microbial ecology and population genetics. So far, these benefits have mostly come from shotgun community metagenomics that provides a highlevel overview of the taxonomic and functional composition of microbial communities. However, this approach is limited in its ability to yield complete genome sequences as well as the fine-scale genetic variation that defines population substructures within these communities. One possible solution uses a combination of single-cell manipulation technologies, multiple-displacement amplification (MDA) and highthroughput sequencing to generate single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs). This approach has already been used to characterize the genomes of uncultivated microbes () and as the throughput of the associated technologies

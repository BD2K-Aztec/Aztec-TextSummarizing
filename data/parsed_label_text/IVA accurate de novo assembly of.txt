Motivation: An accurate genome assembly from short read sequencing data is critical for downstream analysis, for example allowing investigation of variants within a sequenced population. However, assembling sequencing data from virus samples, especially RNA viruses, into a genome sequence is challenging due to the combination of viral population diversity and extremely uneven read depth caused by amplification bias in the inevitable reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification process of current methods. Results: We developed a new de novo assembler called IVA (Iterative Virus Assembler) designed specifically for read pairs sequenced at highly variable depth from RNA virus samples. We tested IVA on datasets from 140 sequenced samples from human immunodeficiency virus-1 or influenza-virus-infected people and demonstrated that IVA outperforms all other virus de novo assemblers. Availability and implementation: The software runs under Linux, has the GPLv3 licence and is freely available from http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/iva
IntroductionThe main challenge of assembling sequence data from an RNA virus sample into a consensus sequence lies in the extremely variable read depth from current sequencing approaches combined with the extensive viral population diversity. An example is shown inwhere regions of the genome are represented with different read depths, caused by the separate reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification of overlapping regions of the genome before library preparation. Further, there is a relatively high rate of single base differences in the reads throughout the genome. These properties of the data cause standard assembly algorithms to produce multiple contigs covering the same region and, more significantly, miss regions of the genome entirely (). Despite the availability of at least 40 genome assemblers (http:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_assembly), VICUNA () and PRICE () are currently the only assemblers designed for virus data. VICUNA tackles the assembly problem by first clustering the reads that should belong to the same contig, using min hashes to infer similarity. Contigs are generated and then merged to form the final output. PRICE begins with seed sequences, which are iteratively extended by generating new sequence from local assemblies of reads at contig ends. In addition, the RNA-seq assembler Trinity () has been used to assemble virus data because it can handle irregular read depth. Trinity constructs de Bruijn graphs from clusters of the reads, then resolves each cluster into transcripts by tracing reads and their mates through the graphs. Our approach is similar to that of PRICE, except we extend contigs more conservatively using consensus kmers from the reads instead of using local assemblies. Also our new assembler, called IVA (Iterative Virus Assembler), is a completely de novo assembler, whereas PRICE must be provided with seed sequences to be extended into contigs.
DiscussionConsidering the number of ideal assemblies produced by the available tools, it can be seen that assembling RNA virus genomes is challenging. However, IVA was consistently better at producing single sequences representing the consensus sequence of each virus population, especially on the Influenza virus data. In contrast, the other tools tended to either produce multiple copies of parts of each genome or miss entire regions from their output. In summary, we developed IVA specifically to assemble short read sequencing data from RNA virus samples and have shown that it produces significantly higher quality assemblies than existing approaches.(a) For each segment of the reference, the longest matching contig was found.

Tabix is the first generic tool that indexes position sorted files in TAB-delimited formats such as GFF, BED, PSL, SAM and SQL export, and quickly retrieves features overlapping specified regions. Tabix features include few seek function calls per query, data compression with gzip compatibility and direct FTP/HTTP access. Tabix is implemented as a free command-line tool as well as a library in C, Java, Perl and Python. It is particularly useful for manually examining local genomic features on the command line and enables genome viewers to support huge data files and remote custom tracks over networks.

INTRODUCTIONWhen we examine local genomic features on the command line or via a genome viewer, we frequently need to perform interval queries, retrieving features overlapping specified regions. We may read through the entire data file if we only perform interval queries a few times, or preload the file in memory if interval queries are frequently performed (e.g. by genome viewers). However, reading the entire file makes both strategies inefficient given huge datasets. A solution to the efficiency problem is to build a database for the data file (), but this is not optimal, either, because generic database indexing algorithms are not specialized for biological data (). The technical complexity of setting up databases and designing schemas also hampers the adoption of the database approach for an average end user. Under the circumstances, a few specialized binary formats including bigBed/bigWig () and BAM () have been developed very recently to achieve efficient random access to huge datasets while supporting data compression and remote file access, which greatly helps routine data processing and data visualization. At present, these advanced indexing techniques are only applied to BED, Wiggle and BAM. Nonetheless, as most TAB-delimited biological data formats (e.g. PSL, GFF, SAM, VCF and many UCSC database dumps) contain chromosomal positions, one can imagine that a generic tool that indexes for all these formats is feasible. And this tool is Tabix. In this article, I will explain the technical advances in Tabix indexing, describe the algorithm and evaluate its performance on biological data.

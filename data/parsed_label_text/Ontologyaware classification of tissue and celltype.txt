Motivation: Leveraging gene expression data through large-scale in-tegrative analyses for multicellular organisms is challenging because most samples are not fully annotated to their tissue/cell-type of origin.
INTRODUCTIONGenome-scale expression profiling is an invaluable technique for quantifying gene-level activity under different experimental conditions. For more than a decade, researchers and clinicians have submitted their experimental data to public repositories such as NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) () and EBI's ArrayExpress (). These repositories now include almost half a million human expression profiles from multiple laboratories and hospitalsonly to further grow with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. Large but independent microarray datasets have been used to discover tissue-specific patterns (), establish breast cancer subtypes (Cancer Genome) and delineate the transcriptome response to candidate drugs (). Previous integrative studies have leveraged these independent datasets and have developed methods based on correlation (), differential expression (), supervised learning () and data integration (). However, directly dealing with multicellularity is paramount for precisely defining human homeostasis, disease manifestation and pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics. To some effect, few studies have focused on certain sample characteristics such as disease or phenotype (). Yet, to take full advantage of the entire compendia in all the above contexts, we must explicitly uncover tissue/cell-type-specific signals in genome-wide expression data. The current exponential rate of data submission nevertheless makes manual annotation impractical, leaving a curated annotation index for only a small fraction of samples (Supplementary). Text-mining sample descriptions are often unreliable due to the lack of standardized nomenclature and structured descriptive information (). Furthermore, textual information may not reflect the potential specificity and heterogeneity that are concealed in the molecular-level expression measurements of these samples. Therefore, we need a scalable and robust computational method to discover the tissue/ cell-type signals in each gene expression profile deposited in these large heterogeneous data compendia. In practice, tissue/cell-type annotation of gene expression profiles relies on the expression of known biomarker genes. Although pervasive, this approach is limited by the number of sufficient (or often any) known discriminative expression biomarkers and ignores potential specific signals in the entire transcriptome. Machine learning methods that model genome-wide expression have emerged as promising alternatives (), but so far have only been applied in the context of classifying tumor subtypes (e.g. ALL versus AML) in single datasets (). Applying such methods across a large collection of datasets is impeded by the dataset, platform and technology biases (). The only successful attempt at addressing dataset biases is a nearest-neighbor (NN) classification method based on the barcode algorithm (). The task of indexing these large heterogeneous data collections by tissues/cell-types presents substantial challenges. First, a *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013.

For example, classifying blood from brain is a relatively easy problem, but discriminating among different subtypes of blood is a much harder one. Second, the method should maintain consistency with the developmental and anatomical relationships between these tissues and cell-types. Third, the method must be robust across independent datasets to overcome study/laboratory biases. Finally, with emerging profiling technologies, the method should be readily applicable to novel platforms/technologies. No existing approach, to our knowledge, addresses all these challenges. Here, we present a computational algorithm Unveiling RNA Sample Annotation (URSA) that is the first to leverage the relationships between tissues and cell-types (based on a tissue ontology) and accurately identifies specific tissue/cell-type signals present in a given gene expression profile. URSA constructs individual tissue/cell-type classifiers based on ontology-aware sample labels and uses Bayesian Network Correction (BNC) () to integrate these individual classifiers. We demonstrate that URSA substantially outperforms barcodebased NN classification (the only prior approach to this problem) (), as well as independent classifiers that do not use the tissue ontology. Furthermore, although URSA is trained on data from the single most popular microarray platform, it is able to make tissue/cell-type predictions (without re-training) for samples measured by other microarray platforms and even by next-generation RNA sequencing. In the process of classification, our approach learns tissue/celltype signals without the use of any tissue-specific gene database such as the human protein reference database (). Thus, by examining the biological pathways enriched among the feature-weights in each tissue/cell-type classifier, we are able to provide a molecular-level interpretation of URSA's predictions.
DISCUSSIONIn multicellular organisms, integrative analysis leveraging large gene expression compendia requires accurate annotations ofsamples to their tissue and cell-type of origin. In this article, we present a scalable computational method URSA that predicts tissue/cell-type signals in expression profiles across platforms and technologies. Key to its performance is the incorporation of the tissue ontology. Much of URSA's improved performance can be attributed to the construction of more than one hundred additional intermediate (i.e. non-leaf) classifiers, which are then integrated using a Bayesian framework. URSA can be used to automatically annotate samples in public gene expression repositories where most samples are currently lacking tissue/cell-type-specific information. Researchers can discover specific signals in their own samples via our interactive interface at ursa.princeton.edu. Others interested in integrative studies can download the URSA C software and annotate samples on a large scale. Despite URSA's current applicability to a wide variety of tissues/cell-types, its predictions can be further improved as the ontology used for integration adds additional terms and associations. For example, immunologists may be interested in the signal of specific T-lymphocytes such as CD4 T cells, Th17 cells, germinal B cells, and so forth. Unfortunately, the current BRENDA ontology (which was used as a controlled vocabulary and the ontology structure of our method) does not include such terms. Nonetheless, URSA's ability to delineate tissue/cell-type signals without known biomarker genes makes it naturally extendable to such specific cell-types as the BRENDA ontology is extended with more terms and associations (). We plan to regularly maintain and update the software with new tissue and cell-type annotations and the latest version of the BRENDA ontology. Both the strength and the limitation of our method across platforms and technologies depend on the amount of tissue signal in the gene order and the number of missing values. For a given gene expression profile from a different platform, quantile transformation is applied to compute hg133plus2-like expression values. In consequence, our method is robust to different normalization techniques used because only the information of relative gene abundance is transferred. However, specific signals associated with the particular gene expression value may be lost, and properly incorporating such signals may provide greater prediction accuracy. Furthermore, expression values for genes not measured in hg133plus2 could affect the accuracy of our method, although simple mean imputation seems to alleviate that effect. URSA's tissue and cell-type-specific models provide a biological interpretation of its predictions. As such, URSA could potentially be used to test and identify possible sample contaminations, resolve cancer samples of unknown primary origin and perhaps provide insight into the molecular basis of poorly characterized clinical subtypes.

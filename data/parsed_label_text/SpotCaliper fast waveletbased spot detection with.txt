Motivation: SpotCaliper is a novel wavelet-based image-analysis software providing a fast automatic detection scheme for circular patterns (spots), combined with the precise estimation of their size. It is implemented as an ImageJ plugin with a friendly user interface. The user is allowed to edit the results by modifying the measurements (in a semi-automated way), extract data for further analysis. The fine tuning of the detections includes the possibility of adjusting or removing the original detections, as well as adding further spots. Results: The main advantage of the software is its ability to capture the size of spots in a fast and accurate way. Availability and implementation:
IntroductionThe focus of our article is the analysis of circular objects (spots), since their detection and size estimation is fundamental in the image processing of micrographs. Our method/software can be applied to a broad class of images; it is not linked to one specific biological problem. However, we note two particular applications, where the precise detection of the spots and their radius estimation is of high interest. First, in antimicrobial susceptibility testing of significant bacterial isolates, the size of the zones of the inhibition areas are measured and used as an indicator of antibiotics resistance (susceptible, intermediate or resistant) (). Second, detection and size measurements are also important for understanding ELISpot images ().

Motivation: BioJava is an open-source project for processing of biological data in the Java programming language. We have recently released a new version (3.0.5), which is a major update to the code base that greatly extends its functionality.
INTRODUCTIONBioJava is an established open-source project driven by an active developer community (). It provides a framework for processing commonly used biological data and has seen contributions from 460 developers in the 12 years since its creation. The supported data range in scope from DNA and protein sequence information up to the level of 3D protein structures. BioJava provides various file parsers, data models and algorithms to facilitate working with the standard data formats and enables rapid application development and analysis. The project is hosted by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF, http://www.open-bio.org), which provides the source code repository, bug tracking database and email mailing lists. It also supports projects SUCH AS BioPerl (), BioPython (), BioRuby (), EMBOSS () and others.
CONCLUSIONThe BioJava 3 library provides a powerful API for analyzing DNA, RNA and proteins. It contains state-of-the-art algorithms to perform various calculations and provides a flexible framework for rapid application development in bioinformatics. The library also provides lightweight interfaces to other projects that specialize in visualization tools. The transition to Maven made managing external dependencies much easier, allowing the use of external libraries without overly complicating the installation procedure for users. The BioJava project site provides an online cookbook which demonstrates the use of all modules through short recipes of common tasks. We are looking forward to extending the BioJava 3 library with more functionality over the coming years and welcome contributions of novel components by the community.

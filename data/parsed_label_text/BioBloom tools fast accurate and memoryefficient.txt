Large datasets can be screened for sequences from a specific organism , quickly and with low memory requirements, by a data structure that supports time-and memory-efficient set membership queries. Bloom filters offer such queries but require that false positives be controlled. We present BioBloom Tools, a Bloom filter-based sequence screening tool that is faster than BWA, Bowtie 2 (popular alignment algorithms) and FACS (a membership query algorithm). It delivers accuracies comparable with these tools, controls false posi-tives and has low memory requirements.
INTRODUCTIONPipelines that detect pathogens and contamination screen for host sequences so they do not interfere with downstream analysis (). The alignment-based algorithms that these pipelines use provide mapping locations that are irrelevant for classification, and thus perform more computation than is needed. To address this, we have developed BioBloom Tools (BBT). BBT uses Bloom filtersprobabilistic, constant time access data structures that identify whether elements belong to a set (). Bloom filters are similar to hash tables but do not store the elements themselves; instead, they store a fixed number of bits for every element into a common bit array. Thus, they use less memory, but queries to the filter may return false membership (hits) because of hash collisions in the common bit array. The false-positive rate (FPR) resulting from these false hits can be managed by increasing the size of the filter (Supplementary Material). Using Bloom filters for sequence categorization was pioneered by the program FACS (). Here, we describe a Bloom filter implementation that includes heuristics to control false positives and increase speed.

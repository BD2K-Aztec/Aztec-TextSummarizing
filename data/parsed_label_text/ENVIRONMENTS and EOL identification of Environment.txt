The association of organisms to their environments is a key issue in exploring biodiversity patterns. This knowledge has traditionally been scattered, but textual descriptions of taxa and their habitats are now being consolidated in centralized resources. However, structured annotations are needed to facilitate large-scale analyses. Therefore, we developed ENVIRONMENTS, a fast dictionary based tagger capable of identifying Environment Ontology (ENVO) terms in text. We evaluate the accuracy of the tagger on a new manually curated corpus of 600 Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) species pages. We use the tagger to associate taxa with environments by tagging EOL text content monthly, and integrate the results into the EOL to disseminate them to a broad audience of users. Availability and implementation: The software and the corpus are available under the open-source BSD and the CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0 licenses, respectively, at http://environments.
IntroductionThe Encyclopedia of Life (EOL; http://eol.org/) is a web resource offering biodiversity knowledge summaries of the world's species to a vast audience (). It currently aggregates content from more than 250 providers. These include textual descriptions about the biology, such as habitat, of more than 900 000 taxa. The Environment Ontology (ENVO) project aims to provide a controlled, structured vocabulary to support annotation of organisms with environmental descriptors (). The ontology comprises 1600 terms and is part of recommended (meta-)genomic metadata standards (). Having the environmental information contained in EOL annotated in the form of ENVO terms, rather than as free text, would enhance search capabilities and enable users to easily compile summary statistics on, for example, the ecological distribution of any taxa. However, manually annotating all EOL entries with ENVO terms would be

Motivation: Many biochemical systems require stochastic descriptions. Unfortunately these can only be solved for the simplest cases and their direct simulation can become prohibitively expensive , precluding thorough analysis. As an alternative, moment closure approximation methods generate equations for the time-evolution of the systems moments and apply a closure ansatz to obtain a closed set of differential equations; that can become the basis for the deterministic analysis of the moments of the outputs of stochastic systems. Results: We present a free, user-friendly tool implementing an efficient moment expansion approximation with parametric closures that integrates well with the IPython interactive environment. Our package enables the analysis of complex stochastic systems without any constraints on the number of species and moments studied and the type of rate laws in the system. In addition to the approximation method our package provides numerous tools to help non-expert users in stochas-tic analysis.

IntroductionInherent stochasticity of elementary reactions affects many biochemical processes. Analytic solutions of stochastic systems are rarely available and simulations () can come with high computational costs making the study of such systems implausible. Numerous approximation methods have been developed recently to lighten the burden. A popular approach is to approximate the whole system by following the moments of the temporally evolving probability distribution, such as in the Moment Expansiongamma not available in other packages. Furthermore, the package is complemented with an implementation of exact stochastic simulation, as well as support for different ODE solvers and sensitivity analysis, a parameter estimation tool and specific functions for the visualization of results.

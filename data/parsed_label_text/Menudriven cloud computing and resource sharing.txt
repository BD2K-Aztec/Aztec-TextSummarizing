INTRODUCTIONHigh-throughput technologies and integrative systems biology have led to an increasing need for high-performance computing. Cloud computing has emerged as an attractive solution to issues of maintenance, administration and obsolescence (). The Bioconductor (bioconductor.org) and R (cran.r-project.org) projects offer a rich, open-source computational environment with over 3000 'packages' (high-level libraries) covering data analysis (e.g. sequencing, ChIP/RNA-seq), simulation modeling (e.g. stochastic modeling, ODEs and PDEs) and network integration, analysis and visualization. Compatibility with other resources is provided via bridging packages such as RSBML and Rgraphviz.

We describe here the ncIDP-assign extension for the popular NMR assignment program SPARKY, which aids in the sequence-specific resonance assignment of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The assignment plugin greatly facilitates the effective matching of a set of connected resonances to the correct position in the sequence by making use of IDP random coil chemical shifts. Availability: The ncIDP-assign extension is available at http://www.protein-nmr.org/.
INTRODUCTIONThe structural characterization of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is a rapidly growing field in structural molecular biology. Over the past decade NMR spectroscopy has proven to be singular in its capacity to provide detailed structural characterization of these dynamic entities (). Although diverse experimental approaches have been developed (), the sequential resonance assignment of 10 kDa natively unfolded polypeptides is still not a trivial task. Here, we describe an enhanced version of the SPARKY () sequence repositioning extension, which assist in matching, connecting and assigning consecutive residues, and is specifically designed for intrinsically disordered proteins: ncIDPassign (neighbor-corrected IDP chemical shift assignment). This tool makes use of a novel random-coil chemical shift library, enabling the accurate prediction of the chemical shifts of a queried protein on a basis of tripeptides (). Predicted sequence-specific chemical shifts are used as a template for reassignment and validation of existing resonance assignments. The newly designed ncIDP-assign greatly accelerates the process of sequential resonance assignment of large intrinsically disordered proteins by drastically reducing the level of assignment ambiguities.

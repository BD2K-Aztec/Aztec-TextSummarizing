Motivation: Short sequence motifs are an important class of models in molecular biology, used most commonly for describing transcription factor binding site specificity patterns. High-throughput methods have been recently developed for detecting regulatory factor binding sites in vivo and in vitro and consequently high-quality binding site motif data are becoming available for increasing number of organisms and regulatory factors. Development of intuitive tools for the study of sequence motifs is therefore important. iMotifs is a graphical motif analysis environment that allows visualization of annotated sequence motifs and scored motif hits in sequences. It also offers motif inference with the sensitive NestedMICA algorithm, as well as overrepresentation and pairwise motif matching capabilities. All of the analysis functionality is provided without the need to convert between file formats or learn different command line interfaces. The application includes a bundled and graphically integrated version of the NestedMICA motif inference suite that has no outside dependencies. Problems associated with local deployment of software are therefore avoided. Availability: iMotifs is licensed with the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.0 (LGPL 2.0). The software and its source is available at http://wiki.github.com/mz2/imotifs and can be run on Mac OS X Leopard (Intel/PowerPC). We also provide a cross-platform (Linux, OS X, Windows) LGPL 2.0 licensed library libxms for the Perl, Ruby, R and Objective-C programming languages for input and output of XMS formatted annotated sequence motif set files.

INTRODUCTIONUntil recent years, studying sequence specificity of transcription factors systematically has been limited to a relatively small number of organisms and transcription factors. High-throughput protein DNA interaction assays such as protein binding microarrays (), bacterial one-hybrid screens (), large ChIP-chip studies and advances in motif inference algorithms and tools has, however, caused an expansion of motif databases such as UNI-PROBE (), TRANSFAC () and JASPAR (). * To whom correspondence should be addressed.Sequence motif analysis tools can be hard to deploy and use locally. Many commonly used software packages have therefore been made available as web applications (). Public servers can, however, be limited in the CPU time given to users which can rule out their use for large-scale studies. Data exchange and usability can also be a challenge. Therefore, we have created an OS X-based desktop software package for sequence motif analysis that is easy to install and update. Compared with previously published desktopbased cis-regulatory sequence analysis tools such as TOUCAN () or Sockeye (), iMotifs is more focused on visualization and computation of sequence motifs, although it also supports visualizing scored motif matches in sequences.
CONCLUSIONWe have created an integrated desktop application for short sequence motif analysis. It incorporates visualization, inference, alignment and comparison tools. The application widens the user base of sequence motif analysis tools and can improve the productivity of researchers working with sequence motif data. We aim to integrate with more sequence motif analysis tools and web services and to develop further the already included basic protein motif visualization and inference support. We also encourage the introduction of a standard format for exchange of sequence motif data by providing conversion utilities and an API for input and output of XMS motif set files for a number of common bioinformatics programming languages.

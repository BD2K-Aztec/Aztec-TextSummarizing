Motivation: Protein structural research in plants lags behind that in animal and bacterial species. This lag concerns both the structural analysis of individual proteins and the proteome-wide characterization of structure-related properties. Until now, no systematic study concerning the relationships between protein disorder and multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) in plants has been presented. Results: In this work, we calculated the global degree of intrinsic disorder in the complete proteomes of eight typical monocotyledon-ous and dicotyledonous plant species. We further predicted multiple sites for phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation and methylation and examined the correlations of protein disorder with the presence of the predicted PTM sites. It was found that phosphorylation, acetyl-ation and O-glycosylation displayed a clear preference for occurrence in disordered regions of plant proteins. In contrast, methylation tended to avoid disordered sequence, whereas N-glycosylation did not show a universal structural preference in monocotyledonous and dicotyle-donous plants. In addition, the analysis performed revealed significant differences between the integral characteristics of monocot and dicot proteomes. They included elevated disorder degree, increased rate of O-glycosylation and R-methylation, decreased rate of N-glycosylation, K-acetylation and K-methylation in monocotyledonous plant species, as compared with dicotyledonous species. Altogether, our study provides the most compelling evidence so far for the connection between protein disorder and multiple PTMs in plants.
INTRODUCTIONProteins with long disordered regions, often referred to as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), have been extensively investigated over the past several years. They represent a broad class of proteins found more abundantly in eukaryotes than in bacteria or archaea (). It was estimated that more than one-third of eukaryotic proteins contain IDRs of430 residues in length (). Other bioinformatics studies indicated that more than half of eukaryotic proteins possess IDRs and $2530% of the proteins are mostly disordered (). The proteins with IDRs are also widespread in plant proteomes with the overall proteome disorder content in different plant species being typical for other eukaryotes (). These proteins fulfill important cellular functions in plants, often serving as the integrators of multiple regulatory and environmental signals (). They are abundant in the highly regulated processes, such as cellular signaling and transcription (). It has been estimated that 8294% of all transcription factors, including those from Arabidopsis thaliana, contain extended IDRs () and 470% of signaling proteins have long disordered regions (). IDRs share some common sequence features such as low abundance of order-promoting and high abundance of disorder-promoting amino acids, low sequence complexity, poor sequence conservation, low mean hydrophobicity, high net charge, etc. (). At the structural level, they are distinguished by the absence of stable secondary and/or tertiary structure, high flexibility, elevated-sheet propensity and ability to undergo disorder-to-order transition when involved in proteinprotein interactions (). These interactions are characterized by high specificity coupled with low affinity, ensuring their transient character, selectivity and reversibility. The specific sequence features together with the experimental structure-related databases have been used to develop specific predictors of intrinsic disorder. More than 50 tools for protein disorder prediction have been developed up to now (). Disordered protein regions are often involved in post-translational modifications (PTMs). It has been hypothesized, based on empirical evidence, that PTM sites are located predominantly in the easily accessible and flexible IDRs (). Evidently, some advantages exist for positioning PTM sites within disordered regions. This location would facilitate the specific sequence-dependent association with modifying enzymes due to the high surface exposure and accessibility of the *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In addition, PTMs would typically cause only small changes on the surface of a structured protein, whereas large-scale structural changes, such as disorderto-order transition, can be expected in a disordered region. The larger structural changes would generally elicit a deeper impact on protein function, ensuring a stronger regulatory effect of PTMs. Numerous past studies addressed correlations between intrinsic disorder and individual PTMs in eukaryotic proteins. A wellestablished example includes protein phosphorylation. Several papers consistently reported that protein phosphorylation on Ser, Thr and Tyr occurs predominantly in the disordered regions of animal proteins (). Recently, this correlation has been confirmed in plant species using a predictive tool for analysis of protein phosphorylation in plants (). In addition, correlations between intrinsic disorder and glycosylation have also been investigated. Dissimilar structural preferences for the O-linked and N-linked protein glycosylation have been reported, reflecting differences in the catalytic mechanisms of these PTMs (). Also, several studies addressed correlations between intrinsic disorder and the universal Lys modifications, such as acetylation and methylation. It has been reported that acetylation and methylation showed a preference for occurrence in the disordered regions of animal proteins (); however, these reports were challenged by other researchers (). In the present study, we analyzed proteome-wide correlations of protein disorder with the main types of eukaryotic PTMs, such as Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation, Pro O-glycosylation, Asn N-glycosylation, Lys acetylation and Lys/Arg methylation in several typical monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species. In agreement with the previous studies, we observed that phosphorylation, acetylation and O-glycosylation displayed a preference for occurrence in the disordered regions of plant proteins. However, in contrast to the previous results obtained using combined datasets of eukaryotic proteins, we found, based on the set of tools used in this study, that methylation tended to occur in ordered protein regions. Also, we found that N-glycosylation did not show a clear preference for either ordered or disordered regions of plant proteins.

We present a new method to incrementally construct the FM-index for both short and long sequence reads, up to the size of a genome. It is the first algorithm that can build the index while implicitly sorting the sequences in the reverse (complement) lexicographical order without a separate sorting step. The implementation is among the fastest for indexing short reads and the only one that practically works for reads of averaged kilobases in length.

INTRODUCTIONFM-index plays an important role in DNA sequence alignment, de novo assembly () and compression (). Fast and lightweight construction of FMindex for a large dataset is the key to these applications. In this context, a few algorithms () have been developed that substantially outperform earlier algorithms. However, they are only efficient for short reads. A fast and practical algorithm for long sequence reads is still lacking. This work aims to fill this gap.

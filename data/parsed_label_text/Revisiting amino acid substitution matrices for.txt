Motivation: Although many amino acid substitution matrices have been developed, it has not been well understood which is the best for similarity searches, especially for remote homology detection. Therefore, we collected information related to existing matrices, condensed it and derived a novel matrix that can detect more remote homology than ever. Results: Using principal component analysis with existing matrices and benchmarks, we developed a novel matrix, which we designate as MIQS. The detection performance of MIQS is validated and compared with that of existing general purpose matrices using SSEARCH with optimized gap penalties for each matrix. Results show that MIQS is able to detect more remote homology than the existing matrices on an independent dataset. In addition, the performance of our developed matrix was superior to that of CS-BLAST, which was a novel similarity search method with no amino acid matrix. We also evaluated the alignment quality of matrices and methods, which revealed that MIQS shows higher alignment sensitivity than that with the existing matrix series and CS-BLAST. Fundamentally, these results are expected to constitute good proof of the availability and/or importance of amino acid matrices in sequence analysis. Moreover, with our developed matrix, sophisticated similarity search methods such as sequence–profile and profile–profile comparison methods can be improved further. Availability and implementation: Newly developed matrices and datasets used for this study are available at http://csas.cbrc.jp/ Ssearch/.
INTRODUCTIONProtein sequence comparison methods are fundamental tools in contemporary biology. Currently they are used widely in various fields of bioinformatics such as computational genomics and proteomics, and computational evolutionary biology. Pairwise alignment is the basis of protein sequence comparison methods. Consequently, improving pairwise amino acid sequence comparison methods can engender improved quality of studies in the field of computational biology. A few factors are necessary to improve pairwise amino acid sequence comparison methods. Minimum units that govern the methods consist of comparison algorithms and amino acid substitution matrices, also called similarity/mutation/scoring matrices. Development and improvement of a matrix are crucial for improvement of the methods. Many studies have been undertaken since the first compilation of such matrices () and have been developed and improved along the following three lines. (i) Specific matrices are proteins with distinctive amino acid compositions. Consequently, it is reasonable to construct matrices for distinctive protein classes or proteins encoded in the genome under directional mutation pressures. For instance, matrices specialized for transmembrane regions () and for-barrel membrane proteins (Jimenez) have been developed. Matrices for particular proteins/organisms have also been constructed (). Aside from those matrices, a general scheme for the compositional adjustment of matrices has been proposed (Optimized matrices: starting from the existing matrices, some superior matrices have been derived by maximizing the ability to discriminate between homologs and non-homologs (), and to obtain accurate alignments () with optimization methods. (iii) Contextdependent matrices: from the pioneering work of constructing 400  400 doublet-type ( dipeptide) substitution matrices (), several approaches along this line have been proposed (). More recently, a novel similarity search method called CS-BLAST, which uses information of neighboring residues extensively to improve similarity search, has been developed (). In this method, the similarity search is performed with no amino acid substitution matrix. CS-BLAST, which is reportedly of high detection performance, presents the possibility of displacement of a traditional amino acid substitution matrix (). Although many matrices have been proposed, we found previously that widely used matrices, so-called general purpose matrices such as PAM () and BLOSUM (), have common characteristics in terms of the results of both hierarchical cluster analysis and reproduction from amino acid indices, despite the difference in *To whom correspondence should be addressed.This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/), which permits noncommercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

This fact might imply the existence of common ground among general purpose matrices. It is worth investigating the potential for development. To this end, we explore effective matrices for identifying distantly related proteins based on the prevailing matrices. We explored and identified effective matrice(s) in the PCA subspace through the intensive benchmark analyses, and inferred the most sensitive matrix. That matrix, designated as MIQS, with SSEARCH outperforms the existing matrices and CS-BLAST on an independent dataset, in terms of sensitivity. We argue that substitution matrices are useful for amino acid similarity search.
CONCLUSIONWe demonstrated in this study that, using the PCA subspace based on typical existing matrices, we were able to obtain a sensitive novel matrix, MIQS, empirically. Therefore, it is possible to use it to improve the homology detection of proteins, especially in the SCOP and CATH database, compared with existing matrices and CS-BLAST. We argue that MIQS can be useful for other database searches, and that this matrix can be influential for the improvement of sophisticated methods, such as PSIBLAST and profileprofile comparison methods, in addition to any method using a substitution matrix in the field of bioinformatics.

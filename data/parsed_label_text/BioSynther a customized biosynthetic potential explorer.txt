Motivation: One of the most promising applications of biosynthetic methods is to produce chemical products of high value from the ready-made chemicals. To explore the biosynthetic potentials of a chemical as a synthesis precursor, biosynthetic databases and related chemoinformatics tools are urgently needed. In the present work, a web-based tool, BioSynther, is developed to explore the biosynthetic potentials of precursor chemicals using BKM-react, Rhea, and more than 50 000 in-house RxnFinder reactions manually curated. BioSynther allows researchers to explore biosyn-thetic potentials, through so far known biochemical reactions, step by step interactively, which could be used as a useful tool in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.
IntroductionBiosynthesis has important applications in producing bulk chemicals (), biofuels () or natural products (). There are some biosynthesis informatics tools (), such as BNICE (), RetroPath (), DESHARKY () and FMM (), to design biosynthesis pathways from a start molecule to a target molecule. In industrial biotechnology applications, researchers usually plan to get value-added chemicals from the ready-made molecules. That is, how to automatically explore the biosynthetic potentials of simple chemical precursors? In the present work, BioSynther is developed to assist researchers to get comprehensive biosynthesis target molecules based on the BKM-React reactions (), Rhea reactions () and in-house RxnFinder () reactions (www.rxnfinder.org).

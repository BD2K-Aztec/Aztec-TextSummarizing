Wave-spec is a pre-processing package for mass spectrometry (MS) data. The package includes several novel algorithms that overcome conventional difficulties with the pre-processing of such data. In this application note, we demonstrate step-by-step use of this package on a real-world MALDI dataset. Availability: The package can be downloaded at http://www.vicc.org/biostatistics/supp.php. A shared mailbox (wave-spec@vanderbilt.edu) also is available for questions regarding application of the package.
INTRODUCTIONThis paper demonstrates how the Wave-spec package works, as an application note designed to complement a Wave-spec method paper published previously (). The rest of this paper is organized as a step-by-step demonstration on real MALDI-TOF data and follows the procedure presented in Supplementary.

Gobe is a web-based tool for viewing comparative genomic data. It supports viewing multiple genomic regions simultaneously. Its simple text format and flash-based rendering make it an interactive, exploratory research tool. Gobe can be used without installation through our web service, or downloaded and customized with stylesheets and javascript callback functions. Availability: Gobe is a flash application that runs in all modern web-browsers. The full source-code, including that for the online web application is available under the MIT license at
INTRODUCTIONAs more genomic data and data formats are created, there is an increasing demand for a tool that accepts a simple text-based format and renders an interactive view of the data that can then be used to develop hypotheses and convey information. A web-based application has the advantage of being more accessible and easily deployable, allowing users to quickly visualize and share data. Existing genome visualization tools such as GBrowse (), GenomeGraphs () and genoPlotR () generate useful static images but require installation, use in a specific programming language environment and do not provide interactivity. Browsers such as Anno-J (http://www.annoj.org) and the UCSC genome browser () are interactive but more difficult to set up and do not easily support comparison of multiple genomic regions. Other stand-alone viewers such as GenomeView (http://genomeview.org/) and Tablet () excel in displaying next-generation sequence data but are less customizable. While tools such as VISTA () do offer a comparative view, deletions, inversions and transpositions are not visible given that representation. We introduce Gobe, a customizable, language-agnostic tool that can be run locally or used from an existing web-service. In either case, all data and styling are specified through a simple text format. Optional javascript callbacks allow interactivity for web developers. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

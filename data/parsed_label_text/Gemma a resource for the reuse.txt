Gemma is a database, analysis software system and web site for genomics data re-use and meta-analysis. Currently, Gemma contains analyzed data from over 3300 expression profiling studies, yielding hundreds of millions of differential expression results and coexpression patterns (correlated expression) for retrieval and visual-ization. With optional registration users can save their own data and securely share it with other users. Web services and integration with third-party resources further increase the scope of the tools, which include a Cytoscape plugin.

The ISMB Special Interest Group on Linking Literature, Information and Knowledge for Biology (BioLINK) organized a one-day workshop at ISMB/ECCB 2013 in Berlin, Germany. The theme of the workshop was Roles for text mining in biomedical knowledge discovery and translational medicine. This summary reviews the outcomes of the workshop. Meeting themes included concept annotation methods and applications, extraction of biological relationships and the use of text-mined data for biological data analysis.

INTRODUCTIONWith the increasing availability of text data related to biology and medicine in the scientific literature, database annotations, the electronic health record, clinical trials data and health information online, exciting opportunities arise to provide access to pertinent biomedical information and to advance biomedical knowledge. An evolving research direction is the integration of information from diverse data sources, including textual data, to support deeper understanding of biological systems, the genomic basis of disease and genotypephenotype relationships. During the BioLINK SIG 2013 meeting, we explored the current state of the field with respect to information extraction from the wealth of available textual sources and application areas where text mining is deployed to support biological data analysis.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of integral membrane proteins. They are the most important class of drug targets. While there exist crystal structures for only a very few GPCR sequences, numerous experiments have been performed on GPCRs to identify the critical residues and motifs. GPCRRD database is designed to systematically collect all experimental restraints (including residue orientation, contact and distance maps) available from the literature and primary GPCR resources using an automated text mining algorithm combined with manual validation, with the purpose of assisting GPCR 3D structure modeling and function annotation. The current dataset contains thousands of spatial restraints from mutagenesis, disulfide mapping distances, electron cryo-microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy experiments.
INTRODUCTIONG-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of membrane proteins and mediate most cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters, as well as being responsible for vision, olfaction and taste (). Many diseases involve the malfunction of these receptors, making them important drug targets. While knowledge of a protein's structure furnishes important information for understanding its function and drug design (), the experimental determination of the 3D structure of GPCR membrane proteins has proved to be very difficult. Only four GPCR structures from human have been solved so far: 2adrenergic (), A2A adenosine (), CXCR4 and Dopamine D3 (to be released). Fortunately, computer-based methods for predicting the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence have been increasingly successful as demonstrated by the recent CASP experiments (). The structure models for all 907 registered GPCRs in the human genome were recently generated using a threading-assembly refinement method (TASSER;). About 820 GPCRs are anticipated to have correct topology and transmembrane * To whom correspondence should be addressed. helix arrangement. Nevertheless, great cautions are needed when utilizing the homology-based models for detail structural and functional annotations since helix kinks and extracellular loops are often different in different receptors. Modeling the subtle distinctions, which is essential for ligand docking and screening, remains a major challenge as highlighted by the recent blind GPCR Dock experiment (). While there exist crystal structures for only a very few GPCR sequences, numerous experiments have been performed on GPCRs to identify the critical residues and motifs. The information can be of important use to the structure and function modeling of the GPCR molecules. For example, the coherent activation and inactivation of residues in mutagenesis experiments usually indicate that the residues are spatially neighbors because they are binding to the common ligands (). The orientation of mutated functional residues is usually towards inside of the seven-helix bundle (). Thus, specific contacts or distance maps and residue orientations can be derived from the experimental data which can be used as restraints to guide the protein structure modeling simulations (); this is especially helpful for the modeling of the structurally variant regions that cannot be directly transferred by homology inference (). GPCRRD is designed to systematically collect all available restraints derived from the experimental data scattered in the literature and GPCR-related databases using an automated text mining algorithm combined with manual validation, with the purpose of assisting GPCR 3D structure modeling and function annotation. The GPCRRD database is freely accessible. The database is updated automatically once every 2 weeks.
CONCLUSIONThe main purpose of GPCRRD is to automatically retrieve and update experimental information for GPCR 3D structure modeling and function annotation. Although several GPCR databases have been developed, useful information for GPCR 3D modeling cannot be directly obtained from these sources. For example, GPCRDB has general sequence and family data of GPCRs and TinyGRAP collects mutations but both do not provide the residuelevel structural information. GPCRRD is to our knowledge the first structure-oriented database that systematically collects GPCR spatial restraints from primary experimental resources assisted by manual curation. The use of the GPCRRD to guide I-TASSER () for high-resolution GPCR structure and function modeling is under progress. Funding: Alfred P.

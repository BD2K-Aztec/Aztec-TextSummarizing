Motivation: Genetic screens by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering have become a powerful tool for functional genomics. However, there is currently a lack of end-to-end software pipelines to analyze CRISPR/Cas9 screens based on next generation sequencing. Results: The CRISPR-AnalyzeR for pooled screens (caRpools) is an R package for exploratory data analysis that provides a complete workflow to analyze CRISPR/Cas9 screens. To further support the analysis of large-scale screens, caRpools integrates screening documentation and generation of standardized analysis reports. Availability and implementation: caRpools, manuals and an open virtual appliance are available at
IntroductionCRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering can be leveraged for high-throughput functional genomic screens in vertebrate cells (). For such screens, Cas9-expressing cells are infected with lentiviral short guide (sg) RNA libraries. After phenotypic selection, sgRNA sequences serve as barcodes to identify enriched or depleted mutant clones by next generation sequencing (NGS). Inter-experimental variations in sequencing quality and depth, variable sgRNA coverage per gene, on-target efficiency and off-target effects represent challenges for analysis and hit identification (). The software package CRISPR-AnalyzeR for Pooled Screens (caRpools) performs exploratory data analysis of CRISPR/ Cas9 screens combined with detailed screening documentation to enable reproducibility of analyses workflows ().

OmicsAnalyzer is a Cytoscape plug-in for visual omics-based network analysis that (i) integrates hetero-omics data for one or more species; (ii) performs statistical tests on the integrated datasets; and (iii) visualizes results in a network context. Availability: Implemented in Java, OmicsAnalyzer runs with Cytoscape 2.6 and 2.7. Binaries, documentation and video walkthroughs are freely available at http://vrac.iastate.edu/
INTRODUCTIONThe widespread use of omics-related biotechnologies has led to many heterogeneous omics datasets. Software packages facilitate the interpretation of omics data by using graph models where nodes represent bio-elements and edges are bio-interactions between these elements (). However, the complexity of biological systems and omics datasets require an integrative analytical environment, which allows network manipulation at different levels of detail, flexible mappings between multiple omics datasets coupled with data visualization and providing statistical analysis and system simulation and visualization of resulting analysis. Cytoscape (), an open source platform software dedicated to network modeling in biology, provides a highly flexible environment for combining these elements. To meet the above requirements, OmicsAnalyzer (i) manipulates networks through interface connection with third-party plug-ins; (ii) maps omics datasets within or across species and manages the datasets; (iii) visualizes dynamic data using plots and animations; and (iv) analyzes data using built-in statistical functions. The integration of these key analysis functionalities is a key building block for omics data analysis in systems biology.

Motivation: Mathematical morphology (MM) provides many powerful operators for processing 2D and 3D images. However, most MM plugins currently implemented for the popular ImageJ/Fiji platform are limited to the processing of 2D images. Results: The MorphoLibJ library proposes a large collection of generic tools based on MM to process binary and grey-level 2D and 3D images, integrated into user-friendly plugins. We illustrate how MorphoLibJ can facilitate the exploitation of 3D images of plant tissues. Availability and Implementation: MorphoLibJ is freely available at http://imagej.net/MorphoLibJ
IntroductionThe continuous development of microscopy imaging techniques results in increasingly better spatial resolution, signal quality and throughput and allows 3D imaging of biological cells, tissues or organisms. Biological images present specific difficulties for automated analysis, due to data dimensionality (space, time, channels, etc.), acquisition artefacts, or low contrast. There is thus a recurrent need for efficient image processing algorithms and for user-friendly software that integrates them.To meet the needs for generic implementations and ImageJ interfaces of MM operators, we developed the GPL-licensed MorphoLibJ library. MorphoLibJ implements a large collection of MM algorithms applicable to 2D and 3D grey level images and integrated into userfriendly interfaces.
ConclusionThe MorphoLibJ library provides a set of generic tools for image processing and analysis of biological samples. We demonstrated its applicability on 3D images of plant tissue. The cell-resolved data provided by MorphoLibJ will be useful for the analysis of cell lineage, and the modelling of plant growth and morphogenesis in 3D.

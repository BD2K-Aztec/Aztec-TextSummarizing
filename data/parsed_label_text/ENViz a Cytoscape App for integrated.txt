ENViz (Enrichment Analysis and Visualization) is a Cytoscape app that performs joint enrichment analysis of two types of sample matched datasets in the context of systematic annotations. Such datasets may be gene expression or any other high-throughput data collected in the same set of samples. The enrichment analysis is done in the context of pathway information, gene ontology or any custom annotation of the data.
IntroductionThe recent emergence of novel high-throughput technologies enables the quantification of different types of biological features in a genome-wide scale (e.g. mRNA expression levels, miRNA expression levels and DNA copy numbers). In parallel with these technologies, various methodologies have been developed to handle integrated analysis of functional genomics data, mainly by studying the transcriptional programs and global organization of biological processes. Still, only a few tools support routine joint analysis of sample cohorts with multiple genomic measurement results (). Even fewer tools provide the visualization strength of Cytoscape in this context (). The ENViz approach to integrated data analysis uses the power of enrichment statistics combined with genomic annotation databases to statistically assign relevant function annotations to explored profiled elements. It thus provides a better understating of the relationship between different molecular entities in cells or organisms. Visualizing ENViz results as Cytoscape networks provide compact structured representation of enrichment results. Even though the development of ENViz was motivated by available modern biological measurements, joint analysis of two sample matched datasets and systematic annotations may be applied to other similarly structured.

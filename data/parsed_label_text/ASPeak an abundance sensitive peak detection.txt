Unlike DNA, RNA abundances can vary over several orders of magnitude. Thus, identification of RNAâ€“protein binding sites from high-throughput sequencing data presents unique challenges. Although peak identification in ChIP-Seq data has been extensively explored, there are few bioinformatics tools tailored for peak calling on analogous datasets for RNA-binding proteins. Here we describe ASPeak (abundance sensitive peak detection algorithm), an implementation of an algorithm that we previously applied to detect peaks in exon junction complex RNA immunoprecipitation in tandem experiments. Our peak detection algorithm yields stringent and robust target sets enabling sensitive motif finding and downstream functional analyses. Availability: ASPeak is implemented in Perl as a complete pipeline that takes bedGraph files as input. ASPeak implementation is freely available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/as-peak under the GNU General Public License. ASPeak can be run on a personal computer, yet is designed to be easily parallelizable. ASPeak can also run on high performance computing clusters providing efficient speedup. The documentation and user manual can be obtained from http://master. dl.sourceforge.net/project/as-peak/manual.pdf.
INTRODUCTIONHigh-throughput sequencing of short RNA fragments directly associated with RNA-binding proteins enables transcriptomewide mapping of protein binding sites on RNAs. Such binding sites can be enriched by either immunopurification (IP) of RNA protein complexes (RIP) or cross-linking followed by IP (CLIP) (). These approaches are analogous to ChIP experiments for DNA-binding proteins. Although identification of peaks in ChIP-Seq data has been addressed by numerous approaches (), development of specific bioinformatics tools for RNAprotein binding site identification has lagged behind with few alternatives (). With the recent explosion of high-throughput sequencing data for dozens of RNA-binding proteins, there is an urgent need to develop efficient and userfriendly applications to better address the computational challenges of identifying peaks in sequences with variable starting abundances. Here, we describe a new peak detection algorithm that is sensitive to differential expression levels of target transcripts. This approach enables robust peak detection even in low abundance transcripts. We previously used our algorithm to define binding sites for the exon junction complex (EJC) (). Here we describe an open-source and a much-improved implementation of this abundance sensitive peak detection algorithm (ASPeak).
CONCLUSIONASPeak is a fast and efficient expression-sensitive peak caller for CLIP-and RIP-Seq data. ASPeak implementation has the ability to run on multiple processors resulting in a significant speedup when used on high performance computing centers. Compared with MACS or Piranha, ASPeak provides comparable or better results when used in an expression-sensitive mode. In addition, ASPeak is supported with extensive documentation that allows experienced bioinformaticians to customize their analyses using detailed parameter files. Finally, a streamlined mode is available for biologists with limited knowledge of Linux systems to easily run ASPeak using default settings. Our implementation, ASPeak, is an open-source command-line program. Input files are RNA-Seq, CLIP-/ RIP-Seq data in BED/ SAM/BAM/BOWTIE format and region annotation files such as RefSeq in BED format. Peak regions are output in a tab-separated format. ASPeak can be run using a single command in a streamlined and simple manner. Additionaly, ASPeak can be parallelized and allows advanced users to run different steps separately for effective debugging and specialized applications.

Motivation: Gene–gene interactions are of potential biological and medical interest, as they can shed light on both the inheritance mechanism of a trait and on the underlying biological mechanisms. Evidence of epistatic interactions has been reported in both humans and other organisms. Unlike single-locus genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which proved efficient in detecting numerous genetic loci related with various traits, interaction-based GWAS have so far produced very few reproducible discoveries. Such studies introduce a great computational and statistical burden by necessitating a large number of hypotheses to be tested including all pairs of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Thus, many software tools have been developed for interaction-based case–control studies, some leading to reliable discoveries. For quantitative data, on the other hand, only a handful of tools exist, and the computational burden is still substantial. Results: We present an efficient algorithm for detecting epistasis in quantitative GWAS, achieving a substantial runtime speedup by avoiding the need to exhaustively test all SNP pairs using metric embedding and random projections. Unlike previous metric embedding methods for case–control studies, we introduce a new embedding, where each SNP is mapped to two Euclidean spaces. We implemented our method in a tool named EPIQ (EPIstasis detection for Quantitative GWAS), and we show by simulations that EPIQ requires hours of processing time where other methods require days and sometimes weeks. Applying our method to a dataset from the Ludwigshafen risk and cardiovascular health study, we discovered a pair of SNPs with a near-significant interaction (P = 2.2 Â 10 À13
INTRODUCTIONGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have so far detected thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci that are associated with various traits (). Unfortunately, for most complex traits the discovered SNPs explain only a small fraction of the estimated heritability, a phenomena often referred to as the 'missing heritability' (). One plausible explanation suggested for this problem is the existence of an epistatic effect, where two or more loci have a synergetic influence on the phenotype, also referred to as genegene interactions (). The discovery of interacting SNP loci has an additional benefit, as it may shed light on the underlying biological mechanism or involved pathways. Despite evidences of genegene interactions reported in both human and other organisms (), very few reproducible discoveries were reported by GWAS (for example). The amount of data produced in a single study is a possible cause: when searching for groups of k SNPs with an epistatic effect, the number of possible k-sized groups is (m k ), where m is the number of SNP loci. With current GWAS typically including hundreds of thousands of SNPs, this implies both a computational and statistical burden even for groups sizes as small as k = 2: the numerous tests takes days and even weeks to compute and require a substantial correction for multiple hypothesis, leading in some cases to a loss of power (). One common approach is the reduction of the search space, usually by filtering candidate loci pairs:suggested selecting a subset of SNPs with a moderate marginal effect and testing for interaction in pairs where at least one locus is included in the subset. Reduction of the search space can also be done by manipulating contingency tables () or searching for a linkage disequilibrium (LD) contrast between cases and controls (). A more straightforward approach is increasing the computational power, either by multi-threaded implementations or by utilizing special hardware (). Binary operations are used in some cases to speedup performance (). All of these tools, and many others, are designed for case control studies; whereas for the quantitative case, where the tested phenotypes are physiological measurements of some sort, the selection of available software is limited. Since the phenotype tested is not dichotomous, testing for quantitative associations can be more challenging compared with casecontrol studies, as methods utilizing contingency tables, LD-contrast or binary operations are usually inapplicable.

In this study, we present EPIQ (EPIstasis detection for quantitative GWAS)an efficient algorithm for detecting pairs of SNP loci that have an epistatic effect on quantitative phenotypes. EPIQ achieves a substantial runtime speedup by avoiding the need to exhaustively test all SNP pairs: it applies a carefully chosen transformation that maps each genotyped SNP to a vector in a Euclidean space. This transformation has the property that SNP pairs with an epistatic effect are converted to vector pairs with a large inner product. A random projections method is subsequently applied to efficiently recover these SNPs. A novelty of our method is that each SNP is projected to two different points, for a more efficient detection of interacting SNPs. We show on simulated data that in just 43 h our algorithm was able to process a dataset that would take days or weeks using state of the art software, and present the results of running EPIQ on data from the Ludwigshafen risk and cardiovascular health (LURIC,) study.
DISCUSSIONIn this article we demonstrated how random projections methods can be applied on quantitative GWAS, achieving in most cases at least an order of magnitude speedup compared with other existing tools, scaling linearly with the number of SNP pairs. We showed that EPIQ required only 1.5 h on 10 processors for a real dataset of 687 253 SNPs and 826 individuals, identifying a pair of SNPs with a possible epistatic interaction, demonstrating that the model's assumptions do not hinder an efficient discovery of interacting pairs. This speedup is gained in exchange of a minor loss of power. As mentioned before, a search for interacting SNP pairs in current GWAS suffers from an inherent multiple testing problem, where P-values must be as small as 10 13 or less in order to be considered significant. Like RAPID () and SIXPAC (Prabhu and Pe'er, 2012) have done, EPIQ turns this limitation into an advantage: for a given sample size, smaller P-values are a result of larger effect sizes. This in turn makes interacting pairs more distinct from the rest of the SNPs and consequently easier to detect by EPIQ. The drawback is that as sample size increases, a smaller effect size is required for achieving the same significance level. In this case EPIQ is required to perform more iterations in order to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting pairs, and therefore does not scale linearly with sample size. Thus, as GWAS expand to include increasingly larger cohorts, further adjustments in the algorithm would be required. We wish to state that the settings used in this article are only a portion of a wide range of options. The approach we described can be extended to fit other statistical tests, and the binarycoding of the genotypes can be performed differently than described, to match other underlying models of interaction. EPIQ can also be used in conjunction with methods such as the genome-wide rapid association testing (GRAT) (), which utilize LD between SNPs for choosing a subset of proxy SNPs, thus reducing the number of tests and further improving runtime. Moreover, the runtime reported relates to the current code implementation of the algorithm. Different implementations, such as GPU-based code, are likely to achieve even better results. With the decrease in runtime, permutation tests for significance become a feasible option, resulting in increased power compared with stringent methods for multiple hypothesis correction.

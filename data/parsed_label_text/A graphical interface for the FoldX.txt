A graphical user interface for the FoldX protein design program has been developed as a plugin for the YASARA molecular graphics suite. The most prominent FoldX commands such as free energy difference upon mutagenesis and interaction energy calculations can now be run entirely via a windowed menu system and the results are immediately shown on screen. Availability and Implementation: The plugin is written in Python and is freely available for download at http://foldxyasara.switchlab.org/ and supported on Linux, MacOSX and MS Windows.
INTRODUCTIONThe empirical forcefield FoldX () was developed for the rapid evaluation of the effect of mutations on the stability, folding and dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids (). FoldX is normally run from the command line with userprovided configuration files. To increase the usability, many core functionalities of FoldX have now become available through a complete graphics interface as a plugin for the YASARA () molecular viewer.

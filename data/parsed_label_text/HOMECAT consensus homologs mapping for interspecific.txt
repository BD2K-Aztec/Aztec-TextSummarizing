Motivation: Comparative studies are encouraged by the fast increase of data availability from the latest high-throughput techniques, in particular from functional genomic studies. Yet, the size of datasets, the challenge of complete orthologs findings and not last, the variety of identification formats, make information integration challenging. With HOMECAT, we aim to facilitate cross-species relationship identification and data mapping, by combining orthology predictions from several publicly available sources, a convenient interface for high-throughput data download and automatic identifier conversion into a Cytoscape plug-in, that provides both an integration with a large set of bioinformatics tools, as well as a user-friendly interface.

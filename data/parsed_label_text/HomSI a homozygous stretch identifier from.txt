In consanguineous families, as a result of inheriting the same genomic segments through both parents, the individuals have stretches of their genomes that are homozygous. This situation leads to the prevalence of recessive diseases among the members of these families. Homozygosity mapping is based on this observation, and in consanguineous families, several recessive disease genes have been discovered with the help of this technique. The researchers typically use single nucleotide polymorphism arrays to determine the homozy-gous regions and then search for the disease gene by sequencing the genes within this candidate disease loci. Recently, the advent of next-generation sequencing enables the concurrent identification of homozygous regions and the detection of mutations relevant for diagnosis , using data from a single sequencing experiment. In this respect, we have developed a novel tool that identifies homozygous regions using deep sequence data. Using *.vcf (variant call format) files as an input file, our program identifies the majority of homozygous regions found by microarray single nucleotide polymorphism genotype data.

INTRODUCTIONIn communities with a high level of consanguineous marriage, the diagnosis of a recessive genetic disorder offers a unique advantage for positional cloning of rare diseases. In such an isolated inbred human population, several individuals may inherit a variation of an ancestor, and the offsprings born of consanguineous union will have a high probability of inheriting two copies of the mutated chromosomal segment and thus expressing the disease. In this respect, homozygosity mapping is an effective approach to identify potential disease loci. Because Lander and Botstein successfully used this technique in 1987 (), both the experimental and the computational methods that are used to generate and analyze relevant datasets have undergone diversification and refinement. Originally, to detect homozygous regions, individuals were genotyped with panels of highly polymorphic short tandem repeat (or microsatellite) markers, typically at genomic intervals of 1012 cM. With the availability of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, short tandem repeat microsatellites were later replaced by SNP arrays to survey the genome and to identify large stretches of homozygosity. The overlapping regions among the homozygous stretches of affected individuals are called runs of shared homozygosity (ROSHs), and these regions are expected to contain the disease gene. For this purpose, several computational tools have been developed (). Even though the identification of recessive disease loci (homozygous regions) is accomplished using the aforementioned SNP array-based techniques, the next step to detect pathogenic sequence variant is sequencing. Until recently, only the candidate genes in these loci are sequenced. If this disease locus is a large interval or if it includes several genes, the determination of disease causing mutations by Sanger sequencing becomes a backbreaking task. At this point, next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms present an alternative solution with their capacity to sequence the entire genome. Owing to the moderate costs and tractable data amounts, exome sequencing is a promising approach to detect novel mutations of human monogenic disorders. Hence, it is now possible to concurrently identify homozygous regions and possibly deleterious sequence variants, using data from a single sequencing experiment. To the best of our knowledge, only two programs have been developed to detect homozygous regions from NGS data, i.e. AgileVariantMapper () and HomozygosityMapper (). But, these programs do not take into account the distribution of the variants within the genomic coordinates. Here, we developed a novel sliding window-based methodology, which provides the advantage of scanning the genome in detail, but at the same time detecting the candidate homozygous regions easily. This type of analysis gives us the opportunity of converting the genotype information into a signal, where we can apply well-known signal processing techniques.

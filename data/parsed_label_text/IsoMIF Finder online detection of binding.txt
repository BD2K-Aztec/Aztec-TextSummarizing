IsoMIF Finder is an online server for the identification of molecular interaction field (MIF) similarities. User defined binding site MIFs can be compared to datasets of pre-calculated MIFs or against a user-defined list of PDB entries. The interface can be used for the prediction of function, identification of potential cross-reactivity or polypharmacological targets and drug repurposing. Detected similarities can be viewed in a browser or within a PyMOL session. Availability and Implementation: IsoMIF Finder uses JSMOL (no java plugin required), is cross-browser and freely available at bcb.med.usherbrooke.ca/imfi.

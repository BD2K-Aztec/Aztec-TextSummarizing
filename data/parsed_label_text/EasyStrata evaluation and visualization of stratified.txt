The R package EasyStrata facilitates the evaluation and visualization of stratified genome-wide association meta-analyses (GWAMAs) results. It provides (i) statistical methods to test and account for between-strata difference as a means to tackle geneâ€“strata interaction effects and (ii) extended graphical features tailored for stratified GWAMA results. The software provides further features also suitable for general GWAMAs including functions to annotate, exclude or highlight specific loci in plots or to extract independent subsets of loci from genome-wide datasets. It is freely available and includes a user-friendly scripting interface that simplifies data handling and allows for combining statistical and graphical functions in a flexible fashion. Availability: EasyStrata is available for free (under the GNU General Public License v3) from our Web site www.genepi-regensburg.de/ easystrata and from the CRAN R package repository cran.r-project. org/web/packages/EasyStrata/.
INTRODUCTIONGenome-wide association meta-analyses (GWAMAs), in which multiple study-specific genome-wide association (GWA) results are pooled, have resulted in a 10-to 20-fold increase in the number of known genes contributing to complex traits and diseases (). Meanwhile, a focus is also on geneenvironment-wide interaction analyses (GEWIS) that are conducted to further characterize genetic main effects as well as to discover novel genetic associations that are only present under certain environmental conditions (geneenvironment interaction, GxE). Although some GEWIS have already extended from single-study analyses to meta-analyses, so far, only few reported replicable GxE effects (). For categorical environmental factors E, GEWIS meta-analyses can be implemented as GWAMAs stratified by E, for example, a GWAMA stratified by sex or by smoking status. Stratified GWAMAs do not only improve power to detect stratum-sensitive genetic main effects () but also allow for testing genestrata (GxS) interaction and joint (main + interaction) effects (). Although a variety of methods for the analysis of stratified GWAMA results exist, the availability of software tools is limited (see Supplementaryfor a comparison with other GWAS tools). We have developed an R-package called EasyStrata, which allows the user to obtain statistical and graphical summaries for comparisons across strata and to investigate potential GxS effects. The software was developed within the GxE working groups of the GIANT (Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits) consortium, and the functionality of the package is exemplified on GWAMA results for anthropometric traits, which are publically available at www.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant. EasyStrata is applicable to stratified GWAMAs of continuous or dichotomous outcomes, and many of the functions are also applicable for 'non-stratified' GWAMAs (Supplementary Note).

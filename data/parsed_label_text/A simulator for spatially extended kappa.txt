Spatial Kappa is a simulator of models written in a variant of the rule-based stochastic modelling language Kappa, with spatial extensions. Availability: The spatial kappa simulator is an open-source project licensed under the LGPLv3, with Java source, binaries and manual available at
CONCLUSIONWe have presented in this note SK, a language and simulator to embed rule-based models in space. Although equivalent features exist in other simulation tools, the complete feature set below is currently unique: Flexible compartment definitions support arbitrary dimensions and connectivity between compartments.  Use of channels to simplify model construction: defined once, they can be used repeatedly within rules which involve a spatial element.  Complex composition-based diffusion rates that can vary with size and composition of a complex to represent, e.g. complexes diffusing more slowly as they grow larger.  Multicompartment complexes allowing for large aggregates or transmembrane arrangements.  Diffusion of multicompartment complexes via special multisource channels. The tool for the 3D/4D visualization of SK models (see) is available at https://github.com/lptolik/ SPKappaR.The formal description of the SK language, examples and the grammar can be found in the user manual distributed with the source code.

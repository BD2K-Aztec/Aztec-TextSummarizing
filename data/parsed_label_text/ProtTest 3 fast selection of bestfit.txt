We have implemented a high-performance computing (HPC) version of ProtTest that can be executed in parallel in multicore desktops and clusters. This version, called ProtTest 3, includes new features and extended capabilities. Availability: ProtTest 3 source code and binaries are freely available under GNU license for download from http://darwin.uvigo.es/ software/prottest3, linked to a Mercurial repository at Bitbucket (https://bitbucket.org/).
INTRODUCTIONRecent advances in modern sequencing technologies have resulted in an increasing capability for gathering large datasets. Long sequence alignments with hundred or thousands of sequences are not rare these days, but their analysis imply access to large computing infrastructures and/or the use of simpler and faster methods. In this regard, high-performance computing (HPC) becomes essential for the feasibility of more sophisticatedand often more accurate analyses. Indeed, during the last years HPC facilities have become part of the general services provided by many universities and research centers. Besides, multicore desktops are now standard. The program ProtTest () is one of the most popular tools for selecting models of amino acid replacement, a routinary step in phylogenetic analysis. ProtTest is written in Java and uses the program PhyML () for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of model parameters and phylogenetic trees and the PAL library () to handle alignments and trees. Statistical model selection can be a very intensive task when the alignments are large and include divergent sequences, highlighting the need for new bionformatic tools capable of exploiting the available computational resources. Here we describe a new version of ProtTest, ProtTest 3, that has been completely redesigned to take advantage of HPC environments and desktop multicore processors, significantly reducing the execution time for model selection in large protein alignments.

Motivation: The Illumina Infinium 450 k DNA Methylation Beadchip is a prime candidate technology for Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS). However, a difficulty associated with these beadarrays is that probes come in two different designs, characterized by widely different DNA methylation distributions and dynamic range, which may bias downstream analyses. A key statistical issue is therefore how best to adjust for the two different probe designs. Results: Here we propose a novel model-based intra-array normal-ization strategy for 450 k data, called BMIQ (Beta MIxture Quantile dilation), to adjust the beta-values of type2 design probes into a statistical distribution characteristic of type1 probes. The strategy involves application of a three-state beta-mixture model to assign probes to methylation states, subsequent transformation of probabilities into quantiles and finally a methylation-dependent dilation transformation to preserve the monotonicity and continuity of the data. We validate our method on cell-line data, fresh frozen and paraffin-embedded tumour tissue samples and demonstrate that BMIQ compares favourably with two competing methods. Specifically, we show that BMIQ improves the robustness of the normalization procedure, reduces the technical variation and bias of type2 probe values and successfully eliminates the type1 enrichment bias caused by the lower dynamic range of type2 probes. BMIQ will be useful as a preprocessing step for any study using the Illumina Infinium 450 k platform. Availability: BMIQ is freely available from http://code.google.com/p/bmiq/.
INTRODUCTIONIn the past few years, the field of epigenomics has risen to prominence (). Epigenomics not only offers an improved understanding of fundamental biological processes such as cellular differentiation and early embryogenesis, but is also widely recognized to be key in understanding the pathogenesis of complex genetic diseases like cancer (). One particular epigenetic mark of interest is DNA methylation. Indeed, DNA methylation markers have been proposed as early detection, diagnostic and prognostic markers in a wide range of different diseases (). Underpinning this increased interest in epigenomics are significant advances in beadarray technology, which now allow routine measurement of DNA methylation at over thousands of CpG dinucleotides (). Among these, the Illumina Infinium 450 k Human Methylation Beadchip offers both scalability and coverage (4480 000 probes) and is thus suitable for Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS) (). A key statistical issue with the Illumina 450 k beadchip is that probes come in two different designs, which causes the methylation values derived from these two designs to exhibit widely different distributions (). Indeed, type2 probes are typically characterized by a much lower dynamic range compared with type1 probes, even after adjustment for differences in biological characteristics such as CpG density (). Comparison with bisulphite pyrosequencing data further showed that type2 probe values are biased and generally less reproducible (). To correct for this bias, a peak-based correction (PBC) method was proposed () which normalises type2 design probes so as to render them comparable with type1 probes. Making the statistical distributions of type1 and type2 probes comparable is important for several reasons. Not doing so may introduce an enrichment bias towards type1 probes when ranking probes in supervised analyses, as the dynamic range of type1 probes is significantly higher. Moreover, methods that seek to determine differentially methylated regions () also assume that probes within these regions are comparable and thus one would want to avoid any sources of technical variation within them. Finally, one would wish to apply unsupervised dimensional reduction algorithms () and classification algorithms () to one single dataset, and not separately to two different assays. Although the PBC method was validated in one dataset () and has now been implemented in a pipeline for 450 k data (), two recent studies have exposed potential problems with PBC, specially when *To whom correspondence should be addressed  The Author 2012.

In fact, as noted in these studies, PBC breaks down when the methylation density distribution does not exhibit well-defined peaks/modes. Hence, both studies proposed subset quantile normalization methods (SQN and SWAN) to correct for the type2 bias and which avoid the pitfalls of PBC (). In this work, we show that PBC often leads to discontinuities ('holes') in the type2 density distribution. To address this problem, we here propose a novel mixture model-based normalization algorithm, called Beta MIxture Quantile dilation (BMIQ). We subject BMIQ to a rigorous evaluation using numerous independent datasets and using a number of different evaluation criteria to assess its robustness and performance. Specifically, we assess BMIQ in terms of reducing (i) the technical variance, (ii) the type2 bias, (iii) and the above-mentioned type1 enrichment bias. We further benchmark BMIQ against PBC and SWAN. For assessing technical variance and to allow a comprehensive comparison of BMIQ to PBC/SWAN across many datasets, we use in addition to replicates, a novel evaluation framework based on using adjacent type1type2 probe pairs within probe clusters, a framework which we show leads to consistent and robust conclusions across 10 independent datasets. We demonstrate that, overall, BMIQ compares favourably to PBC and SWAN.
DISCUSSIONIn this work we have presented a novel mixture-model-based algorithm (BMIQ) for correcting the bias associated with type2 probe values in 450 k studies. Confirming the observations) in the density distributions (), which motivated our quest to find a more robust algorithm. We have shown that BMIQ improves the robustness and can successfully normalize the type2 distribution, avoiding the appearance of such 'holes' (). Moreover, BMIQ successfully matches the tail-ends of the type1 and type2 distributions, while faithfully preserving the proportions of unmethylated and methylated probes within each of the two designs. To further test BMIQ, we used data on technical replicates (to show that it reduces technical variability) and matched BPS data (to show that it reduces the bias of type2 probe values). Using these criteria, we have seen that BMIQ leads to significant improvements, similar to the improvements noted for PBC (). In relation to these evaluation criteria, it is worth pointing out that BMIQ was compared with PBC on samples with well-defined type1 methylation peaks, i.e. on data that were used to develop PBC itself. Hence, it is likely that an evaluation of technical reproducibility (using replicates) and type2 value bias (using matched BPS data) on data where the methylated type1 peaks are less well-defined would favour BMIQ over PBC. However, we did not have access to technical replicates or matched BPS data in the other specific datasets considered here. Therefore, in order to further assess BMIQ, we devised a supervised framework across three independent datasets to objectively compare the algorithms in their ability to reduce the expected enrichment bias of type1 probes. First, we showed that if no design normalization is performed then there is indeed an enrichment bias towards type1 probes, even when adjusted for CpG density (). We also showed that in two datasets, PBC overcorrected the type2 data, leading to an overinflated dynamic range, thus favouring type2 probes and causing an 'overshooting' of the enrichment scores, reflected by a significant underenrichment of type1 probes (and C). In contrast, BMIQ successfully avoided any type1/type2 enrichment bias in all three datasets, indicative of an improved normalization of type2 values (). We should point out that the overcorrection of type2 values and the associated overinflated dynamic range caused by PBC is consistent with the presence of 'holes' in the hemimethylated region of the type2 density distribution. Thus, with PBC there is an artificial expulsion of data points from the hemimethylated region to the unmethylated and/ or methylated extremes. In a further assessment of BMIQ, we conducted a detailed spatial analysis of DNA methylation at the level of probe clusters across 10 independent datasets. By carefully analysing adjacent type1type2 probe pairs, we observed that PBC can often overcorrect or suppress the data (in some cases inducing abnormally large 30% changes in methylation), in contrast to BMIQ, which normalized type2 values in a way that rendered them more consistent with the values of neighbouring type1 probes (). Interestingly, BMIQ also appeared to outperform SWAN (), which is part of the popular and widely used minfi package (). Of note, the reduction in technical variance achieved by BMIQ was not at the expense of a lower biological signal ().

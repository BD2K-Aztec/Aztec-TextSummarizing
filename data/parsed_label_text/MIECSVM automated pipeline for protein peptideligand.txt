Motivation: MIEC-SVM is a structure-based method for predicting protein recognition specificity. Here, we present an automated MIEC-SVM pipeline providing an integrated and user-friendly workflow for construction and application of the MIEC-SVM models. This pipeline can handle standard amino acids and those with post-translational modifications (PTMs) or small molecules. Moreover, multi-threading and support to Sun Grid Engine (SGE) are implemented to significantly boost the computational efficiency. Availability and implementation: The program is available at http://wanglab.ucsd.edu/MlEC
IntroductionAccurate prediction of the binding specificity of proteins, particularly those whose interacting partners are conformationally flexible, remains a great challenge. Many computational methods have been developed to meet this challenge () and one of them is the MIEC-SVM method. This method has been successfully applied to predict the binding specificity of diverse systems including SH3 domains (), PDZ domains (), chromodomains () and HIV protease (). Here, we present an automated MIEC-SVM pipeline that allows users to predict interacting partners using the existing MIEC-SVM models as well as to construct new models for the protein families of their own interest.
ConclusionThe MIEC-SVM method is a powerful tool to predict the binding specificity of proteins. The pipeline presented here automates the model training and prediction, which will greatly facilitate the broader application of this method.

Motivation: Meta-analysis of genomics data seeks to identify genes associated with a biological phenotype across multiple datasets; however , merging data from different platforms by their features (genes) is challenging. Meta-analysis using functionally or biologically characterized gene sets simplifies data integration is biologically intuitive and is seen as having great potential, but is an emerging field with few established statistical methods. Results: We transform gene expression profiles into binary gene set profiles by discretizing results of gene set enrichment analyses and apply a new iterative bi-clustering algorithm (iBBiG) to identify groups of gene sets that are coordinately associated with groups of phenotypes across multiple studies. iBBiG is optimized for meta-analysis of large numbers of diverse genomics data that may have unmatched samples. It does not require prior knowledge of the number or size of clusters. When applied to simulated data, it outperforms commonly used clustering methods, discovers overlapping clusters of diverse sizes and is robust in the presence of noise. We apply it to meta-analysis of breast cancer studies, where iBBiG extracted novel gene setâ€”phenotype association that predicted tumor metastases within tumor subtypes.

INTRODUCTIONGenomic studies have generated vast quantities of data, including gene expression, copy number variation and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Tens of thousands of gene expression profiling experiments are stored in public repositories () and are increasingly studied in aggregate. The aim of these studies is typically to discover a set of genes that participate in a pathway and are robustly predictive of a biological phenotype in a meta-analysis of multiple studies. Gene set analysis (GSA) was developed to identify such gene sets whose expression distinguishes biological conditions, even if single-gene analysis fails to find significant associations with the phenotype. The method takes advantage of a priori defined gene sets published in gene set databases (Gene Ontology, KEGG and MSigDB) or resulting from differential expression studies (MSigDB and GeneSigDB) (). GSA has been successfully applied to the analysis of microarray experiments () and has been extended beyond transcriptomics to other areas, such as analysis of genome-wide association studies (). When compared to traditional single-gene analysis that ranks differential gene expression between two conditions, GSA produced more consistent biological results across studies even when some genes in a gene set were absent or poorly represented in a dataset (). Although GSA naturally extends to integrated meta-analysis, surprisingly few studies have applied meta-GSA to integration of multiple datasets (). Most meta-GSA approaches are designed for the limited case, where datasets have matched samples or features (). These either create a merged dataset of features (genes) common to all datasets and perform a GSA or apply GSA on each individual datasets and then combine the resulting GSA statistics or P-values to produce a ranked list of gene sets (). While a single ranked list of gene sets may capture the biological complexity of a simple cellular system, it is insufficient when applied to the study of complex disease or meta-analysis of large numbers of studies where different pathways are active in different subsets of samples. These limitations can be addressed using bi-clustering, a simultaneous similarity-based clustering of features and conditions, resulting in modules; subsets of features that exhibit consistent patterns over subsets of conditions (). Numerous bi-clustering approaches have been applied to continuous () and discretized gene expression profiles (); however, these methods have not been applied in meta-GSA. We introduce iterative Binary Bi-clustering of Gene sets (iBBiG), a new bi-clustering algorithm to perform meta-GSA that addresses the shortcomings of 'ranked list' meta-GSA approaches. It scales well when applied to hundreds of datasets is tolerant to noise characteristic of genomics data and when applied on simulated data, outperforms clustering and bi-clustering methods including hierarchical and k-means clustering, FABIA (), COALESCE () and Bimax (). To perform meta-GSA, we first transform 'noisy' gene expression profiles to *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

We then apply iBBiG to extract clusters or 'modules' of groups of phenotypes whose gene expression profiles are enriched in similar gene sets (Supplementary). An attractive feature of iBBiG is that it does not require prior knowledge or limit the number or size of clusters, a non-trivial requirement in cluster analysis of most large biological datasets. The results of iBBiG are easy to parse; iBBiG modules are ranked by an information score, and within each module, gene sets are ranked by a fitness score that measures its weight in the module. It uses a genetic algorithm to maximize the size and entropy of each bi-cluster producing a small number of bi-clusters whose functional and phenotypic associations can be easily interpreted; eight modules were associated with known breast cancer clinical covariates in meta-GSA of 21 breast cancer gene expression datasets, and we detected 13 modules prognostic both within and across breast cancer molecular subtypes using a cluster discovery approach, which ignored a priori sample knowledge.
DISCUSSIONThe iBBiG bi-clustering algorithm is optimized for module discovery in sparse noisy binary genomics data and can be used for(C) weighted score of the first eight modules. The weighted score is the log(k/m*S) where m is the total number of phenotypes. Modules M1M7 are highlighted in (D) an image of the matrix in which rows and columns have the same order as. The eighth module (M8) contains the residues of other modules which is reflected in a low weighted scoreBi-clustering of binary data meta-GSA of multiple genomics datasets, to discover modules: groups of phenotypes whose differential gene expression profiles are enriched in the same gene sets. Data integration is made tractable by transformation of continuous 'noisy' gene expression data (with different probes/genes in each study) into profiles of differentially enriched gene sets (which are common to all studies). We examined two GSA approaches, GSEAlm which tests for enrichment of gene sets in genes that are differentially regulated between conditions and GSVA which is single sample GSA. The former can be applied to identifying gene sets or pathways associated with known clinical covariates, the latter is a pure discovery approach that ignores prior sample knowledge. We designed iBBiG to have high specificity and thereby minimize the false-positive rate when discovering new classes, but the iterative approach employed in iBBiG ensures it is sufficiently sensitive to discover weak signals, even if they are potentially masked by stronger ones. When applied to simulated data it outperforms widely used global clustering approaches (Kmeans, hierarchical cluster analysis) and newer bi-clustering approaches (Bimax, FABIA and COALESCE) and is able to find overlapping gene set modules of varying sizes. iBBiG was able to identify all clusters in a simulated meta-GSA dataset with high levels of specificity and sensitivity. An advantage of iBBiG relative to other methods is that it does not require a priori knowledge of the true number of clusters. Following the application of iBBiG, the number of true clusters can be estimated from the weighed scores of the extracted modules. In some cases, we observed that a module may represent the residue or remaining signal of a stronger, previously extracted module. This residue remains because iBBiG only removes information from the data matrix that is actually used for the entropy-based score in a module. However, we do not consider these residual modules to be a shortcoming of the method as their existence facilitates discovery of the true overlap between modules and, further, these modules can be easily detected by looking at the overlap of phenotypes and gene sets. Although iBBiG includes several parameters, we have shown that most impact only computation time and do not effect cluster discovery. The only parameter that had an impact on cluster discovery was , which regulates the weighting between cluster homogeneity and the number of phenotypes. This parameter is useful in fine-adjustment of the sensitivityspecificity ratio. One major advantage of iBBiG is its robustness in the presence of noise and its tolerance of missing data. It can tolerate high levels of noise as the entropy derived fitness score add members to a bi-cluster once the number of associations exceeds 50%. We demonstrate that iBBiG performs well even in the presence of false-positive associations and noise in both signal (20%) and background (40%). Second, iBBiG does not require a gene set to be associated with all phenotypes in a bi-cluster which is a attractive feature in complex biological data were biological processes maybe redundant or regulated by multiple factors concurrently. Many other bi-clustering algorithms, including Bimax and the recently described BiBiT (), discover only homogenous bi-clusters and have low tolerance to noise and missing data. Bimax identified a large number of mini-bi-clusters and was unable to identify large clusters in our simulated dataset. In practice, application of Bimax to genomics data requires post-processing of bi-cluster results in order to either join or visualize overlapping bi-clusters (). We applied iBBiG to discovery of new modules among 1008 primary breast tumors and discovered 13 modules in an iBBiG-GSVA analysis. Each module contained samples from multiple studies demonstrating successful data integration. While the largest highest confidence modules (M1M4) discovered breast cancer molecular subtypes known to be important in breast cancer, the smaller modules represented sub-sets of these subtypes, supporting recent evidence that there are subtypes within each of the principal breast cancer molecular subtypes (). The module M10 was characterized by gene sets associated with angiogenesis in response to hypoxia (or HIF1A degregulation) and was a strong predictor of recurrence inup-regulation of proliferation genes and down-regulation of cell adhesion genes in high-grade breast tumors. Although they had insufficient numbers of patients to establish statistical significance, they observed that high levels of immune genes were an indicator of good prognosis in high-grade breast cancer patients. Our analysis also suggests B4 immune response is associated with better outcome. When we examined which genes that most frequently appeared in module B4 GeneSigDB gene signatures, we found several chemokines including CCL5 (RANTES), a key regulators of T-cell immune response highly expressed in breast cancer and reported to be associated with metastases and progression (). However, our analysis does not fit this prevailing hypothesis and suggests CCL5 is associated with good prognosis in high-grade breast cancer patients. In this study, we have used iBBiG to discover clusters in matrices of discretized P-values from GSA of gene expression data; however, the method can also be easily applied to GSA of other different data types including SNP data (). iBBiG can be applied to non-geneset data. For example, to demonstrate the application of iBBiG to an extremely sparse matrix (50.3%40) in which small clusters are expected, iBBiG was applied to discretized data from the NHGRI genome-wide association study (GWAS) catalog (). As the weighted scores were low for modules identified, we averaged results over 100 runs of iBBiG and chose 10 robust modules. Only genes and traits that occured in at least 65/100 runs were included (Supplementary). These modules are provided in Supplementary Table S22. It discovered a possible link between triglyercides, HDL cholesterol and waist circumference with genes GCKR, LPL, BUD13 and ZNF259. Although LPL, BUD13 and ZNF259 has been implicated previously, this module suggested a new link with an expanding waistline and GCKR. While GSA requires input gene sets, it is not restricted to databases of curated gene sets and can use gene sets deduced through text mining from the published literature (). We anticipate iBBiG will be useful in integrated data analysis of multiple data types. iBBiG can be performed on any binary matrix and could be applied to binary proteinprotein interaction or RNAi data; we would like to extend it to other data types, including categorical data. An attractive feature of iBBiG compared to others methods such as the recently described logistic regression meta-GSA approach () is its ability to perform integrative analysis using dozens of datasets. In summary, iBBiG provides a simple, robust, rapid and scalable method for meta-GSA. When applied to simulated data it outperforms commonly used clustering and bi-clustering approaches and iteratively discovers gene set modules made up of both strong and weaker signals. Meta-GSA using iBBiG constitutes a new approach for discovery of pathway and gene set behavior across multiple studies and provides a higher-level understanding of gene and cellular function.expertise and generous help in running COALESCE.

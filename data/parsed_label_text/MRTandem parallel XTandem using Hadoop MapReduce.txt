MR-Tandem adapts the popular X!Tandem peptide search engine to work with Hadoop MapReduce for reliable parallel execution of large searches. MR-Tandem runs on any Hadoop cluster but offers special support for Amazon Web Services for creating inexpensive on-demand Hadoop clusters, enabling search volumes that might not otherwise be feasible with the compute resources a researcher has at hand. MR-Tandem is designed to drop in wherever X!Tandem is already in use and requires no modification to existing X!Tandem parameter files, and only minimal modification to X!Tandem-based workflows. Availability and implementation: MR-Tandem is implemented as a lightly modified X!Tandem C++ executable and a Python script that drives Hadoop clusters including Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Map Reduce (EMR), using the modified X!Tandem program as a Hadoop Streaming mapper and reducer. The modified X!Tandem C++ source code is Artistic licensed, supports pluggable scoring, and is available as part of the Sashimi project at
INTRODUCTIONPost-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins are a valuable source of biological insights, and mass spectrometry is one of the few techniques able to reliably prospect for and identify PTMs. Yet many valuable datasets are not searched for PTMs due to computational constraints on investigators who do not have claim to significant time on a compute cluster. MR-Tandem helps by bringing X!Tandem () peptide search to cloud computing and using Hadoop to process large datasets in a fast and robust manner. MR-Tandem is not the first parallel implementation of X!Tandem but it is the first to exploit the scalability and fault tolerance of Hadoop to create large on-demand compute clusters on commodity hardware where MPI implementations may fail. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

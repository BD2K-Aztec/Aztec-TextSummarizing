Motivation: An ever-increasing body of evidence supports the importance of B cell receptor im-munoglobulin (BcR IG) sequence restriction, alias stereotypy, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This phenomenon accounts for $30% of studied cases, one in eight of which belong to major subsets, and extends beyond restricted sequence patterns to shared biologic and clinical characteristics and, generally, outcome. Thus, the robust assignment of new cases to major CLL subsets is a critical, and yet unmet, requirement. Results: We introduce a novel application, ARResT/AssignSubsets, which enables the robust assignment of BcR IG sequences from CLL patients to major stereotyped subsets. ARResT/ AssignSubsets uniquely combines expert immunogenetic sequence annotation from IMGT/V-QUEST with curation to safeguard quality, statistical modeling of sequence features from more than 7500 CLL patients, and results from multiple perspectives to allow for both objective and subjective assessment. We validated our approach on the learning set, and evaluated its real-world applicability on a new representative dataset comprising 459 sequences from a single institution.

IntroductionResearch into the immune pathogenesis of lymphomas and leukemias over the last three decades has highlighted the important role of antigen recognition by lymphocyte receptors, by uncovering restrictions in their immunogenetic makeup. Such research in large cohorts of cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in an ageing Western population, revealed that subsets of patients with stereotyped, or quasi-identical, B cellreceptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG, or antibody) collectively account for $30% of cases (), and represent disease sub-entities with shared biologic and clinical profiles, including outcome (). Intriguingly, in the latest and largest such study of over 7500 patients, 19 major subsets, each with at least 20 cases, accounted for 12% of the cohort and 41% of all stereotyped cases (). This is remarkable given the negligible chance, in the range of 1:10 12 , of finding two B cell clones with stereotyped BcR IG. Thus, major stereotyped subsets have attracted great interest. To date, assignment of new cases to these major subsets has been based on the ad hoc application of published criteria (), mostly by groups with advanced knowledge in immunogenetics, and thus with limited applicability, and arguably reliability, in routine practice. We therefore introduce a novel application, ARResT/AssignSubsets, which enables the robust assignment of submitted BcR IG sequences from CLL patients to the existing 19 major stereotyped subsets. negatively)these are: (i) rearranged IGHV and immunoglobulin heavy joining genes; and (ii) the VH CDR3 amino acid sequence through amino acid frequencies at any given sequence position. To keep the model robust and avoid overfitting, the Bayesian network topology is kept as simple as possible, with only obvious dependencies captured: VH CDR3 amino acid frequencies at any position, and relative frequencies of rearranged IGHV genes of the same phylogenetic clan. To avoid creating unrealistically stringent criteria, we include a 'relaxation' coefficient to the probability calculation of the observed frequency of each feature in all available sequences. Finally, to reduce the 'noise' created by relatively less frequent values, we apply the power function on the probability distribution of each feature. Assignment phase: Assignment is based on evaluating submitted sequence features with the learned Bayesian model. Each sequence first acquires an absolute score for each major subset of the positive set and for the negative set or 'pool' cohort. The absolute score is the minus logarithm of the exact probability of assigning to a set, with 'Inf' (minus infinity) meaning that the sequence core features did not match the subset core features. The difference between the absolute score of each major subset and that of the 'pool' cohort is then calculated as a relative score, with positive numbers for submitted sequences closer to subsets than to the 'pool' cohort. Assignment to the best-scoring subset uses a per-subset threshold, based on the range of scores achieved by existing members of that subset. The difference between the relative score and the subset threshold is 'translated' to confidence, ranging from 'borderline' to 'extreme', to further assist the user. Output: Real-time output consists of progress reports, links, information and help, results and tables. These include the detailed ARResT/SeqCure report on the 'health' of the submitted sequences; absolute and relative frequencies of assignment to each of the 19 major CLL subsets; and an assignment report for each submitted sequence, including its 'health', the confidence of the assignment, and, when possible, heat maps of core and secondary features with their significance with respect to the submitted sequence and the bestscoring, but not necessarily assigned, subset.

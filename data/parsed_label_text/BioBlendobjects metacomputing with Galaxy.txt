BioBlend.objects is a new component of the BioBlend package, adding an object-oriented interface for the Galaxy REST-based application programming interface. It improves support for metacomputing on Galaxy entities by providing higher-level function-ality and allowing users to more easily create programs to explore, query and create Galaxy datasets and workflows. Availability and implementation: BioBlend.objects is available online at https://github.com/afgane/bioblend. The new object-oriented API is implemented by the galaxy/objects subpackage. Contact:
INTRODUCTIONIn recent times, the massive increase in the amount of data produced by genomic sequencers and other data-intensive acquisition devices used in the life sciences has led to a continuous intensification of the effort required for biological data analysis. Huge and numerous datasets must be processed by complex analysis workflows, articulated in a large number of steps, most of which are highly dependent on many configuration parameters. Data processing frameworks can help mitigate the complexity by simplifying the pipeline execution. An example of such a framework is Galaxy (), an extremely popular Web application for bioinformatics analysis. It provides a simple way to encapsulate computational tools and datasets in a graphical user interface (GUI), together with a mechanism to keep track of the execution history in a reproducible manner. However convenient and user-friendly, though, GUIs are illsuited to automated analysis and bulk processing. For instance, consider a situation that happens regularly with each release of a new reference genome for resequencing, or with the update of sequence alignment software: to ensure that analysis results stay relevant, such events require that the full set of experimental results (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphism discovery) be reevaluated from scratch using the new model data or software. This laborious task requires better support from the computational framework being used, in the form of reliable ways to automate operations, process datasets in bulk and document the analysis performed on any of them. More generally, studies tend to handle a growing numbers of samples; they also tend to last longer than the relatively frequent update cycles for model data and software. Both these conditions pose requirements for such automated bulk data operations that are currently not handled well by GUIs. To facilitate this sort of processing, Galaxy includes a RESTful () application programming interface (API) that allows other programs to control it automatically. However, this API is fairly low level, as it requires users to construct and issue HTTP requests, explicitly handle the standard error cases that occur in such distributed scenarios and take care of data serialization and deserialization in exchanges between the client and the server. This gap in functionality motivated the development of BioBlend (), a Python package that hides HTTP communication, error handling and JSON (de)serialization from the user, providing a dictionary-based API that greatly simplifies interaction with the Galaxy server. However, despite its significant enhancements over the raw low-level interface, BioBlend still leaves room for improvement. For instance, most of the BioBlend API still offers a one-to-one mapping of generic Python dictionaries to the Galaxy REST resources, with no explicit modeling of Galaxy entities and their relationships. Also, the interface fails to isolate client code from changes in the Galaxy API, as it passes to the caller the same dictionary structures that the server sends. Finally, BioBlend does not provide much in the way of 'rich' functionality to perform higher-level, sophisticated yet generic tasks, despite being positioned in a prime location in the software stack where it is potentially shared by all the user's client applications. In this work we present BioBlend.objects, a Galaxy interface implemented as a new layer above BioBlend. The new API addresses the aforementioned issues with two main features: an object-oriented (OO) programming model, which simplifies development and isolates client code from changes in the Galaxy API and a high-level component that simplifies complex operations and supports metacomputing on the information describing the various Galaxy entities. With BioBlend.objects, running a Galaxy workflow requires just a few lines of simple code: from bioblend.galaxy.objects import GalaxyInstance gi = GalaxyInstance( " URL", " API_KEY " ) wf = gi.workflows.list()hist = gi.histories.list()inputs = hist.get_datasets()input_map = dict(zip(wf.input_labels, inputs)) params = {"Paste1": {"delimiter": " U"}} wf.run(input_map, " wf_output", params=params)The new API is described in more detail in Section 2. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

DISCUSSIONBioBlend.objects is designed to model the relations between Galaxy entities. For instance, a History object can be used to retrieve its datasets through an instance method: this makes the API similar to an object-relational mapping library for Galaxy. The BioBlend.objects module has received the support of the original BioBlend team members, who are involved in its development. As such, it is expected to supplant, in the future, the original programming interface.

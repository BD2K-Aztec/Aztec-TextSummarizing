The previously disclosed QuantMap method for grouping chemicals by biological activity used online services for much of the data gathering and some of the numerical analysis. The present work attempts to streamline this process by using local copies of the databases and in-house analysis. Using computational methods similar or identical to those used in the previous work, a qualitatively equivalent result was found in just a few seconds on the same dataset (collection of 18 drugs). We use the user-friendly Galaxy framework to enable users to analyze their own datasets. Hopefully, this will make the QuantMap method more practical and accessible and help achieve its goals to provide substantial assistance to drug repositioning, pharmacology evaluation and toxicology risk assessment.

INTRODUCTIONUnderstanding interrelationships between drugs, toxins and other chemicals is an important part of discovering new ways to make better medicines, avoid toxicity or achieve any of a variety of goals for systems chemical biology (). For many applications, chemicals are commonly compared structurally according to computed or measured properties (). Another method is to compare the associations with biological systems. One notable application of this method is the connectivity map, which relates biologically active chemicals to gene-expression data (). Our published QuantMap method explores the connections of chemicals to proteins through proteinprotein networks (). In this article, we adapt the partially manual QuantMap method to a rapid automated system with an easy-to-use interface, opening up for moderately larger datasets as well as integration with other tools in batch analysis.

Motivation: Knowledge-based and co-expression networks are two kinds of gene networks that can be currently implemented by sophisticated but distinct tools. We developed stringgaussnet, an R package that integrates both approaches, starting from a list of differentially expressed genes.

IntroductionAnalysis of genes differentially expressed (DE) depending on a condition has become a standard procedure in current biology. However, identification of biologically relevant DE genes is far from being trivial. Yet efficient prioritization of DE genes is an essential step before undertaking rate-limiting wet lab experiments (). In this regard, the network theory appears as a powerful framework. The aim is to connect genes (the nodes) by means of their interactions, the edges (). These interactions may be based on prior knowledge, curated and stored in databases, or extracted from the experimental dataset, e.g. using coexpression information (). Sophisticated but distinct tools are available to implement either one of these approaches separately. We introduce stringgaussnet, an R package that allows inferring gene networks starting from a list of DE genes by integrating both of these approaches with ease and flexibility.

Motivation: The analysis of differentially expressed gene sets became a routine in the analyses of gene expression data. There is a multitude of tests available, ranging from aggregation tests that summarize gene-level statistics for a gene set to true multivariate tests, accounting for intergene correlations. Most of them detect complex departures from the null hypothesis but when the null hypothesis is rejected, the specific alternative leading to the rejection is not easily identifiable. Results: In this article we compare the power and Type I error rates of minimum-spanning tree (MST)-based non-parametric multivariate tests with several multivariate and aggregation tests, which are frequently used for pathway analyses. In our simulation study, we demonstrate that MST-based tests have power that is for many settings comparable with the power of conventional approaches, but outper-form them in specific regions of the parameter space corresponding to biologically relevant configurations. Further, we find for simulated and for gene expression data that MST-based tests discriminate well against shift and scale alternatives. As a general result, we suggest a two-step practical analysis strategy that may increase the interpret-ability of experimental data: first, apply the most powerful multivariate test to find the subset of pathways for which the null hypothesis is rejected and second, apply MST-based tests to these pathways to select those that support specific alternative hypotheses.
INTRODUCTIONIn the era of high-throughput biology, technical difficulties of obtaining large-scale datasets are gradually becoming less pronounced, as compared with difficulties in the data analyses and interpretation. In the analysis of gene expression data, a conceptual shift toward a better interpretability of results happened almost a decade ago, when, instead of testing for the differential expression of a single gene, the first test for testing the differential expression of a set of genes, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) () was suggested. The motivating ideas of GSEA are 3-fold. First, small changes in gene expression, a sign mark of metabolic diseases, cannot be captured by a single gene using conventional tests such as a t-statistic together with a correction for multiple testing (). Second, the data interpretation can be greatly facilitated: conventionally gene sets represent molecular pathways and the differential expression of a pathway has more explanatory power compared with a single differentially expressed gene. Third, genes do not work in isolation but interact with each other; as a consequence, accounting for the multivariate nature of expression changes is more biologically relevant (Emmert). Since the advent of GSEA, many methodologies for testing the differential expression of gene sets (molecular pathways, biological processes) have been suggested and collectively named Gene Set Analysis (GSA) approaches (). GSA approaches have been classified into two categories: competitive and self-contained (). Competitive approaches compare a gene set against a background dataset, and self-contained tests compare whether a gene set is differentially expressed between two phenotypes. That means, self-contained tests are conceptually similar to classical two-sample statistical inference methods, e.g. individual gene tests based on a t-test, only with the unit of change being a set of genes rather than a single gene. Unfortunately, both categories have their own pitfalls and benefits. For instance, competitive approaches are dependent on the size of the entire dataset (), whereas in the case of self-contained approaches, a potential weakness is that null hypotheses tested by self-contained tests are not equivalent (Emmert). Previously, we demonstrated that the space of null hypotheses for self-contained GSA is mostly covered by three null hypotheses: their exact formulation reflects the underlying test statistic (). Specifically, consider the multivariate distribution of gene expressions in a gene set for a given phenotype. For the multivariate Hotelling T 2-statistic null hypothesis is formulated as the equality of the mean expression vectors of the two multivariate gene expression distributions () and the null hypothesis of multivariate N-statistic is the equality of the two multivariate gene expression distributions (). In contrast, gene-level test statistics aggregating scores, *To whom correspondence should be addressed. E-mail: yrahmatallah@uams.edu describing changes in the expression of individual genes (e.g. the squared values of individual t-tests), state the null hypothesis as the equality of aggregated scores between phenotypes (). The aforementioned three null hypotheses are not equivalent and each test projects on different aspects of the data. It should be emphasized, that gene-level test statistics disregard existing, complex correlation structures within a gene set. In real biological settings, moderate (), as well as extensive () correlations between genes in gene sets are well documented () and can result in a decrease in power for gene-level tests, compared with multivariate tests (). In this article, we further explore the opportunities to increase the biological interpretability of experimental results under the self-contained GSA framework. We start with the introduction of multivariate generalizations of the WaldWolfowitz (WW) and KolmogorovSmirnov (KS) non-parametric two-sample tests, which were developed more than three decades ago () based on the minimum spanning tree (MST) structure. These tests, however, have never been considered and implemented in the context of gene set analysis prior to our work. Using simulated data, as well as expression arrays we compare the properties of multivariate WW and KS tests with conventional multivariate tests, such as the N-statistic () and rotation gene set test (ROAST) (), as well as gene-level tests, such as SAM-GS () and the median of P-values from t-tests for individual genes. One property of multivariate non-parametric two-sample tests, namely that they can discriminate against several alternative hypotheses (), is specifically important in the context of data interpretability. For instance, a typical analysis question that asks, 'Is the expression of a pathway different between two phenotypes', can be too unspecific from a biological perspective. For this reason, employing statistical hypotheses tests that allow formulating more specific alternatives can sharpen the initial question itself, elucidating why the null hypothesis H 0 was rejected. The R-code for the multivariate generalizations of the WW and KS non-parametric two-sample tests is available in the Supplementary Material.

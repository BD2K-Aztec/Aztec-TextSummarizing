Brain is a Java software library facilitating the manipulation and creation of ontologies and knowledge bases represented with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Availability and implementation: The Java source code and the library are freely available at https://github.com/loopasam/Brain and on the Maven Central repository (GroupId: uk.ac.ebi.brain). The documentation is available at https://github.com/loopasam/Brain/wiki.
CONCLUSIONBrain is an open source Java library designed to build and query biomedical knowledge bases or OWL ontologies. The library is centered on the EL profile and designed to be suitable and scalable for biomedical knowledge representation. The convenience methods provided by Brain should simplify the development of biomedical knowledge bases and allow developers to increase their productivity while effectively dealing with data integration challenges.

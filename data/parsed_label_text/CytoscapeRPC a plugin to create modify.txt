CytoscapeRPC is a plugin for Cytoscape which allows users to create, query and modify Cytoscape networks from any programming language which supports XML-RPC. This enables them to access Cytoscape functionality and visualize their data interactively without leaving the programming environment with which they are familiar. Availability: Install through the Cytoscape plugin manager or visit the web page: http://wiki.nbic.nl/index.php/CytoscapeRPC for the user tutorial and download.
INTRODUCTIONCytoscape () is a network visualization and analysis tool which is mainly used in the life sciences. It enables users to display the data as graphs and helps them to perform basic actions such as gathering network-topological statistics. It comes with its own plugin management system to facilitate the easy implementation of new functionality. Researchers in the life sciences often use scripting languages to process their data and use Cytoscape to visualize it. Their workflow when using Cytoscape comes down to running their algorithm, converting the output data such that Cytoscape can use it, loading the data into Cytoscape and then setting the appropriate layout and visualization rules to control how the data is displayed. The last three steps of this process are repetitive and time consuming. We present CytoscapeRPC, a Cytoscape plugin created to solve the aforementioned problems by enabling users to create a connection to Cytoscape using XML-RPC, allowing them to create, modify and query Cytoscape networks from within their own programming environment.

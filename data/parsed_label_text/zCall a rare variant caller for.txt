zCall is a variant caller specifically designed for calling rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms from array-based technology. This caller is implemented as a post-processing step after a default calling algorithm has been applied. The algorithm uses the intensity profile of the common allele homozygote cluster to define the location of the other two genotype clusters. We demonstrate improved detection of rare alleles when applying zCall to samples that have both Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip and exome sequencing data available.
INTRODUCTIONArray-based genotyping has been a cost-effective method to capture common variation in the population and has led to the discovery of genetic risk factors for a wide variety of diseases (). In most instances, the significantly associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is not known to be causal but rather likely tags the causal variants through linkage disequilibrium. In contrast, the mapping of Mendelian diseases has been successful at identifying not only the gene of interest but also the specific variant or variants that are likely causal. Most of the causal alleles for Mendelian diseases have been found in the coding region of the human genome (i.e. the exome) (). With recent developments in sequencing, the human genetics community has aggregated an extensive list of coding region variants for the purposes of designing array-based genotyping platforms that capture these variants (e.g. the Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip and the Affymetrix Axiom Exome Array Plate). The overwhelming majority of variation assayed on the exome chip has a minor allele frequency 51%. Existing genotype callers were primarily designed for common variation (). For rare variation, however, only the common allele homozygote cluster is well populated limiting the efficacy of clustering algorithms. To address this need, we developed a new method to accurately call rare variation for array-based genotyping called zCall.

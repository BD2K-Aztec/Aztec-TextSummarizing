Current tools for liquid chromatography and mass spec-trometry for metabolomic data cover a limited number of processing steps, whereas online tools are hard to use in a programmable fashion. This article introduces the Metabolite Automatic Identification Toolkit (MAIT) package, which makes it possible for users to perform meta-bolomic end-to-end liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry data analysis. MAIT is focused on improving the peak annotation stage and provides essential tools to validate statistical analysis results. MAIT generates output files with the statistical results, peak annotation and metabolite identification.

INTRODUCTIONLiquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is an analytical technique used widely in metabolomics to detect molecules in biological samples (). A wide array of software tools is available for LC/MS profiling data analysis, including commercial, programmatic and online tools. A commercial example is Analyst  , whereas some open-source packages permit programmatic processing, such as the R package XCMS () to detect peaks or CAMERA () and AStream () for peak annotations. There have been efforts on just peak annotation using JAVA (). MZmine and mzMatch are modularized tools coded in JAVA that are focused on LC/MS data preprocessing and visualization (). Online tools permit sample processing through a web Graphical User Interface, such as XCMSOnline (http://xcmsonline.scripps.edu) or MetaboAnalyst (). Refer to Supplementaryfor a comparative between the capabilities for some of the main available tools. In this context, we introduce a new R package called Metabolite Automatic Identification Toolkit (MAIT) for automatic LC/MS analysis. The goal of the MAIT package is to provide an array of tools that makes programmable metabolomic end-to-end statistical analysis possible (see Section 3 of the Supplementary Material for details about the MAIT modularity). MAIT includes functions to improve peak annotation through the process called biotransformations and to assess the predictive power of statistically significant metabolites that quantify class separability.

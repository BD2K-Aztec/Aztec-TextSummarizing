Genome-scale metabolic models often lack annotations that would allow them to be used for further analysis. Previous efforts have focused on associating metabolites in the model with a cross reference, but this can be problematic if the reference is not freely available, multiple resources are used or the metabolite is added from a literature review. Associating each metabolite with chemical structure provides unambiguous identification of the components and a more detailed view of the metabolism. We have developed an open-source desktop application that simplifies the process of adding database cross references and chemical structures to genome-scale metabolic models. Annotated models can be exported to the Systems Biology Markup Language open interchange format. Availability: Source code, binaries, documentation and tutorials are freely available at http://johnmay.github.com/metingear. The application is implemented in Java with bundles available for MS Windows and Macintosh OS X.
INTRODUCTIONGenome-scale metabolic models have proved useful in areas such as growth optimization and metabolic engineering (). The time required to generate a reconstruction has decreased with improvements in automatic pipelines, such as the popular model-SEED (). Despite rapid improvements in automation, extensive manual curation is still required for an accurate model. Common practice is to download the draft reconstruction and curate the model in a textbased spreadsheet, adding missing reactions from multiple databases and literature reviews. Although recent models are also published in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) (), the spreadsheets contain additional annotations that are not transferred to the SBML annotation model. The main advantage of the annotations is that they allow identification of the components in a model. Identifying which components are present allows it to be integrated and analyzed with other resources, such as metabolomics experiments, without additional effort to map the components between datasets. The large number of components in genome-scale models means comprehensive annotation is time-consuming. For metabolites, these annotations constitute a cross reference to a chemical or a metabolic pathway database. Although this can help to identify what the metabolite is, there are limitations: (i) if the metabolite was added from a literature review, the reference dataset may not contain that entity, (ii) the reference dataset contains the entity but at a different protonation state (the protonation state of the entry is important, as conservation of mass and charge is a requirement for constraint-based analysis) and (iii) the reference databases are closed access or no longer fully accessible. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) () is frequently used as a starting point for models, but a paid subscription is now required for bulk access. Chemical structure is already used in smaller models of metabolic pathways where atomatom mappings between reactions are required for metabolic flux analysis. The inclusion of full chemical structure in a genome-scale metabolic model is advantageous over only including a cross reference. The structure is database independent and allows direct metabolite identification. A reference to any database can be inferred by searching for an isomorphic structure. Identification is required when incorporating several reference datasets. If no mapping exists, then additional processing is required to identify similarities and overlap. Integrating the chemical structure directly into the model facilitates this integration on demand. Reconciled databases (see Reconciled Databases, Supplementary Material) primarily use a structure representation to merge entities between datasets. These requirements are most beneficial as models grow larger. The recent human reconstruction () includes IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI) structure representations. The structure also allows identification of metabolites that cannot be referenced to an existing database. A metabolite may be added from a literature review or identified experimentally from a mass spectrum. Models may include small peptide chains or fatty acids associated with the acyl carrier protein. These metabolites are not normally found in chemical databases but can still be assigned a chemical structure. Subtleties of metabolites and reactions can be expressed and interpreted from the structure. Metabolites are often referred by their trivial name, from which it is difficult to determine such subtleties. In *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013.

Thermodynamic constraints and Gibbs free energy of formation can be estimated and used to constrain a model (). To estimate these constraints, the chemical structure is required. We have created Metingear, a desktop application to assist in the annotation of metabolic models using both manual and automated techniques. The main goal is to facilitate the integration of chemical structure into genome-scale models.

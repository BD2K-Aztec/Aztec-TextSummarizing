Motivation: As high-throughput transcriptome sequencing provides evidence for novel transcripts in many species, there is a renewed need for accurate methods to classify small genomic regions as protein coding or non-coding. We present PhyloCSF, a novel comparative genomics method that analyzes a multispecies nucleotide sequence alignment to determine whether it is likely to represent a conserved protein-coding region, based on a formal statistical comparison of phylogenetic codon models. Results: We show that PhyloCSFs classification performance in 12-species Drosophila genome alignments exceeds all other methods we compared in a previous study. We anticipate that this method will be widely applicable as the transcriptomes of many additional species, tissues and subcellular compartments are sequenced, particularly in the context of ENCODE and modENCODE, and as interest grows in long non-coding RNAs, often initially recognized by their lack of protein coding potential rather than conserved RNA secondary structures.

INTRODUCTIONHigh-throughput transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) is yielding precise structures for novel transcripts in many species, including mammals (). Accurate computational methods are needed to classify these transcripts and the corresponding genomic exons as protein coding or non-coding, even if the transcript models are incomplete or if they only reveal novel exons of alreadyknown genes. In addition to classifying novel transcript models, such methods also have applications in evaluating and revising existing gene annotations (), and as input features for de novo gene structure predictors (). We have previously () compared numerous methods for determining whether an exon-length nucleotide sequence is likely to be protein coding or non-coding, including single-sequence metrics that analyze the genome of interest only and comparative genomics metrics that use alignments of orthologous regions in the genomes of related species. Among the comparative methods benchmarked in our previous study, one of our original contributions was the Codon Substitution Frequencies (CSF) metric, which assigns a score to each codon substitution observed in the input alignment based on the relative

Motivation: Protein domains are subunits that can fold and evolve independently. Identification of domain boundary locations is often the first step in protein folding and function annotations. Most of the current methods deduce domain boundaries by sequence-based analysis , which has low accuracy. There is no efficient method for predicting discontinuous domains that consist of segments from separated sequence regions. As template-based methods are most efficient for protein 3D structure modeling, combining multiple threading alignment information should increase the accuracy and reliability of computational domain predictions. Result: We developed a new protein domain predictor, ThreaDom, which deduces domain boundary locations based on multiple threading alignments. The core of the method development is the derivation of a domain conservation score that combines information from template domain structures and terminal and internal alignment gaps. Tested on 630 non-redundant sequences, without using homologous templates, ThreaDom generates correct single-and multi-domain classifications in 81% of cases, where 78% have the domain linker assigned within AE20 residues. In a second test on 486 proteins with discontinuous domains, ThreaDom achieves an average precision 84% and recall 65% in domain boundary prediction. Finally, ThreaDom was examined on 56 targets from CASP8 and had a domain overlap rate 73, 87 and 85% with the target for Free Modeling, Hard multiple-domain and discontinuous domain proteins, respectively, which are significantly higher than most domain pre-dictors in the CASP8. Similar results were achieved on the targets from the most recently CASP9 and CASP10 experiments.
INTRODUCTIONProtein molecules are composed of domains that fold, function and evolve autonomously. The definition of protein domains is, however, not absolute. Recent studies have shown that protein domains within the same family or superfamily can vary significantly in both structure and function (). Nevertheless, correct assignment of boundaries of the protein domains is essential for the efficient elucidations of protein function and evolutionary mechanisms. The most accurate characterization of protein domains is through the analysis of the 3D structures. However, the experimental determination of protein structures is often time and manpower expensive and some proteins are even impossible to solve currently. The computational domain prediction from the amino acid sequence is, therefore, highly demanded. A variety of methods have been recently developed in this regard that can be roughly categorized into three groups: statistical and machine-learning based, homology-based and 3D model-based methods. The statistical and machine-learning-based methods are probably the most frequently used approaches to protein domain predictions, with examples including DGS (), DomCut (), Armadillo (), PPRODO (), DOMPro (), DomNet (), DROP (), DOBO (), PRODOM (), ADDA () and EVEREST (). In the DGS, DomCut and Armadillo programs, the statistical regularities seen in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures, including domain size distribution and residue propensities, are used to deduce the domain linker and boundary predictions. In PRODOM, ADDA and EVEREST, the domain boundaries are derived by large-scale sequence comparisons followed by clustering analyses. In the rest examples (PPRODO, DOMPro, DomNet, DROP and DOBO), the residue-based statistical features, together with the position-specific scoring matrix from PSI-BLAST search, are trained by machine-learning techniques, including neural network, support vector machine and random forest classifiers. These methods deduce boundary information from sequence only, which can in principle be applied to any proteins. But the overall accuracy is low compared with the homology-based approaches. In the homology-based methods, e.g. Pfam (), CHOP () and FIEFDOM (), target sequences are searched through known protein structure or family libraries by hidden Markov model (HMM) or PSI-BLAST programs. The domain boundary information is then obtained by mapping the domain information from the homologous templates or families following the sequence alignments. The homology-based methods can have a high accuracy of predictions when close templates are identified, but the accuracy decreases sharply when the sequence identity of target and template is low (e.g. 530%). In the 3D model-based methods, e.g. SnapDRAGON (), RosettaDom () and OPUS-DOM (), the authors first construct tertiary structure models of the target by either ab initio folding or knowledge-based coarse-grained modeling simulations.

The accuracy of domain assignments relies on the quality of the tertiary models, which usually decreases with the size of the target proteins because of the limited ability of ab initio folding simulations (). Having in mind the improved power of the template-based protein structure predictions and the increasing size of PDB, we propose a new algorithm ThreaDom based on multiple threading algorithms, which aims to significantly improve the reliability of domain predictions in the category of distantly homologous protein targets. Although the threading-based algorithms have been successfully used in the CASP experiments for modeling multiple-domain protein structures where the domain boundaries are usually decided by human-intervened views and interpretations of multiple-threading alignment profiles (), this is the first time to integrate the multiple threading algorithms into an automated pipeline for domain boundary determinations. The key to the algorithm is the development of a sensitive domain boundary profile that can calibrate composite structural and sequence alignment information from the multiple threading templates for precise domain assignment. The method will be systematically benchmarked on large-scale proteins, to examine the weaknesses and strengths in comparison with other widely used domain prediction approaches.

We present Circoletto, an online visualization tool based on Circos, which provides a fast, aesthetically pleasing and informative overview of sequence similarity search results. Availability and implementation: Online version and downloadable software package for offline use (source code in PERL) freely available at http://bat.ina.certh.gr/tools/circoletto/ Contact: ndarz@certh.gr
INTRODUCTIONThe calculation of sequence similarity between two biological sequences is as old a procedure as the field of bioinformatics. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, or BLAST (), is a celebrated and highly popular method for the task. However, and partly because the heritage of such tools goes back to very basic visualization technologies and monochromatic terminals, partly because speed and efficiency are still paramount, these tools do not come with visualization capabilities. Yet, there is great need for intuitive ways to quickly understand their output, and interactive solutions have so far included linearly stacked pairs of ideograms (), and highly efficient graph layouts of large numbers of nodes representing sequences and edges representing similarity (). In this context, Circoletto has been developed to complement such methods in a novel way.

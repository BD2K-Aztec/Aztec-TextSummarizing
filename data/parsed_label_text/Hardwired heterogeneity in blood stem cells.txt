Motivation: Combinatorial interactions of transcription factors with cis-regulatory elements control the dynamic progression through successive cellular states and thus underpin all metazoan development. The construction of network models of cis-regulatory elements, therefore , has the potential to generate fundamental insights into cellular fate and differentiation. Haematopoiesis has long served as a model system to study mammalian differentiation, yet modelling based on experimentally informed cis-regulatory interactions has so far been restricted to pairs of interacting factors. Here, we have generated a Boolean network model based on detailed cis-regulatory functional data connecting 11 haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) regulator genes. Results: Despite its apparent simplicity, the model exhibits surprisingly complex behaviour that we charted using strongly connected components and shortest-path analysis in its Boolean state space. This analysis of our model predicts that HSPCs display heterogeneous expression patterns and possess many intermediate states that can act as stepping stones for the HSPC to achieve a final differentiated state. Importantly, an external perturbation or trigger is required to exit the stem cell state, with distinct triggers characterizing maturation into the various different lineages. By focusing on intermediate states occurring during erythrocyte differentiation, from our model we predicted a novel negative regulation of Fli1 by Gata1, which we confirmed experimentally thus validating our model. In conclusion, we demonstrate that an advanced mammalian regulatory network model based on experimentally validated cis-regulatory interactions has allowed us to make novel, experimentally testable hypotheses about transcriptional mechanisms that control differentiation of mammalian stem cells.
INTRODUCTIONThe remarkable power of small combinations of transcription factors to program and reprogram cellular phenotypes is exerted through their ability to modulate the expression levels of their target genes, typically in the range of a few hundred to a few thousand genes. Despite the power of single transcription factors to influence cell fate decisions, it is clear that the transcriptional state of any given cell type is the result of interactions within wider (transcriptional) regulatory networks. These regulatory networks are composed of both the transcription factors (TFs) and the cis-regulatory elements they are bound to (). Regulatory network reconstruction, therefore, requires the identification of cis-regulatory elements, as well as the upstream factors that bind them. Haematopoiesis (blood formation) has long served as a model process for studying stem cells and represents the best characterized adult stem cell system with sophisticated purification strategies and functional stem cell assays. Transcriptional regulation is a key factor controlling haematopoiesis (Miranda-Saavedra and Gottgens), a fact underlined by the large number of TF genes that play key roles in normal haematopoiesis and/or the development of leukaemia (). However, relatively little is known about the way key regulators interact with each other in forming the transcriptional networks controlling haematopoiesis. Identification and subsequent characterization of gene regulatory elements is central to the reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks because these elements dictate the connectivity and topology of transcriptional regulatory networks (). Regulatory elements can be analysed using a variety of assays, such as transfection assays of luciferase reporter constructs or chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis to identify upstream regulators. However, the identification of true in vivo activities of mammalian regulatory elements requires the use of transgenic mouse systems. Regulatory elements from 11 gene loci active in haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) have been validated using all the aforementioned assays, including transgenic mice (*To whom correspondence should be addressed. yThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first three authors should be regarded as joint First Authors.

This wealth of data, therefore, represents a unique opportunity to (re)construct transcriptional network models for developing blood stem cells. Network modelling is increasingly recognized as a powerful approach to deal with the complexity of biological processes, including the intricate interactions between TFs (). Most of the current experimental data describing the function of haematopoietic TFs are of a qualitative nature (e.g. Gata1 and Scl together activate Scl expression), which limits the choice of possible modelling approaches. However, the accumulated knowledge of regulatory interactions () contains experimentally validated information on the topology of regulatory sub-circuits, including positive and negative feedback loops, which are important for maintenance of both the stem cell phenotype () and differentiation into different mature blood cell types (). An important challenge for regulatory network reconstruction is to devise models that can represent the dynamic interactions between important sub-circuits and represent the changes in gene expression when cells are undergoing differentiation. Importantly, experimentally defined regulatory hierarchies based on regulatory elements up to now largely represent a static view, which, in the case of blood stem cell formation is centred on a single time point in transgenic mouse assays (activity within the dorsal aorta region and foetal liver of the midgestation mouse embryo). Here, we have generated a network model based on extensive experimental data with the goal to better understand how core stem cell network circuits are incorporated into the wider dynamic system of blood stem cell development and differentiation. Through the modelling of steady-states and dynamic network behaviour, we were able to identify specific genes and feedback loops within the network that are likely key players in cellular decision making, such as the dynamic processes of stem cell maintenance and/or differentiation. Moreover, our analysis revealed heterogeneous gene expression states within undifferentiated blood stem cells, as well as accurately captured perturbations required to differentiate HSPCs along a specific lineage. Importantly, based on our modelling results, we made a hypothesis that Gata1 negatively regulates Fli1, which we validated experimentally using transcriptional assays, thus providing new insights into the dynamic nature of regulatory networks controlling differentiation of blood stem cells into erythroid cells.
DISCUSSIONThe construction of accurate regulatory network models is an essential prerequisite towards gaining a systems-level understanding of the transcriptional control of complex cellular behaviour. Here, we have generated a regulatory network model for HSPCs based on comprehensive experimental data, which represents the most complex mammalian network model to date anchored on cis-regulatory functional data. This experimentally validated network topology generated three stable states, one of which was composed of 32 interconnected internal states, including the one that matched the stem cell expression pattern. Binary on/off expression of an 11 gene network could theoretically generate 2048 possible expression states. The fact that we identify only 34 states thus highlights how network modelling based on experimental data can serve to reduce the complexity of analysing multi-gene interactions. Analysis of state-space transitions identified potential triggers that might mediate exit from the stem cell state and highlighted a previously unrecognized inhibition of Fli1 by Gata1, which was subsequently validated experimentally.

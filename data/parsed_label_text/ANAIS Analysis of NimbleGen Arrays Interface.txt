ANAIS is a user-friendly web-based tool for the processing of NimbleGen expression data. The interface reads single-channel microarray files generated by NimbleGen platforms and produces easily interpretable graphical and numerical results. It provides biologists six turnkey analysis modules—normalization, probe to gene, quality controls, differential expression, detection, queries and clustering—to explore quickly, freely and without the need for computer programming, NimbleGen transcriptome data.
INTRODUCTIONMicroarray technologies have become widely used in genomewide gene expression studies. The NimbleGen platform (http://www .nimblegen.com/), that offers customized high-density arrays with multiple long-oligos per gene, is particularly gaining popularity among biologists. Nevertheless, few complete, ready-mixed and free analysis tools are available (). Here, we report an intuitive web interface that allows scientists to conduct themselves all the analysis steps needed to interpret a NimbleGen expression experiment. In addition to the conventional processes, such as normalization and differential expression, the tool also offers interesting modules performing quality controls, detection and queries. Moreover, the toolset was developed with a sake of rapidity compatible with a remote use via Internet, and accepts all one-colour NimbleGen expression array designs.

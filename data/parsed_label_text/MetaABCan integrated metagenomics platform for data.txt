MetaABC is a metagenomic platform that integrates several binning tools coupled with methods for removing artifacts, analyzing unassigned reads and controlling sampling biases. It allows users to arrive at a better interpretation via series of distinct combinations of analysis tools. After execution, MetaABC provides outputs in various visual formats such as tables, pie and bar charts as well as clustering result diagrams. Availability: MetaABC source code and documentation are available at http://mpyatkov.github.com/sbarsl.
INTRODUCTIONMetagenomics is a field that involves sampling, sequencing and analyzing the genetic material of unculturable microorganisms in microbial communities while maintaining their physiological conditions in habitats (). Large amounts of metagenomic datasets have been accumulated for analysis in these years through the rapid advancement of sequencing technology. One of the main focuses in metagenomics is the comparative study of metagenomes based on microbial compositions and diversities that are obtained by binning. Binning assigns sequences to phylogenetic groups according to their taxonomic origins (). Recently, many binning tools, such as MEGAN (), PhymmBL (), SOrt-ITEMS () and DiScRIBinATE (), were developed to achieve higher binning accuracy. As the above binning methods become widely used, some data adjustment methods have lately been proposed to improve metagenomic data analysis. For example, it is known that 454 pyrosequencing produces artificial duplicated reads (), andindicated that removing

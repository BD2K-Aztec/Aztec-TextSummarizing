Motivation: Statistical validation of protein identifications is an important issue in shotgun proteomics. The false discovery rate (FDR) is a powerful statistical tool for evaluating the protein identification result. Several research efforts have been made for FDR estimation at the protein level. However, there are still certain drawbacks in the existing FDR estimation methods based on the target-decoy strategy. Results: In this article, we propose a decoy-free protein-level FDR estimation method. Under the null hypothesis that each candidate protein matches an identified peptide totally at random, we assign statistical significance to protein identifications in terms of the permutation P-value and use these P-values to calculate the FDR. Our method consists of three key steps: (i) generating random bipartite graphs with the same structure; (ii) calculating the protein scores on these random graphs; and (iii) calculating the permutation P value and final FDR. As it is time-consuming or prohibitive to execute the protein inference algorithms for thousands of times in step ii, we first train a linear regression model using the original bipartite graph and identification scores provided by the target inference algorithm. Then we use the learned regression model as a substitute of original protein inference method to predict protein scores on shuffled graphs. We test our method on six public available datasets. The results show that our method is comparable with those state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of estimation accuracy.

INTRODUCTIONShotgun proteomics is a strategy that is capable of identifying complex protein mixtures by combining high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS). In shotgun proteomics, the protein identification procedure has two main steps: peptide identification and protein inference (). In peptide identification, we search the experimental MS/ MS spectra against a protein sequence database to obtain a set of peptide-spectrum matches. In protein inference, we report a set of proteins by assembling peptide identification results (). Basically, there are two major computational issues in protein identification that have to be solved. On one hand, we need to develop effective and fast identification/inference algorithms at both the peptide level and the protein level. On the other hand, controlling the quality of identified peptides and inferred proteins is as important as developing identification algorithms. Inferred proteins are more biologically relevant than identified peptides in a proteomics experiment. Therefore, it is vital to control the quality of identification results at the protein level. However, the accurate assessment of statistical significance of protein identifications remains an open question (). To date, several research efforts have been made to estimate the protein-level error rate in terms of false discovery rate (FDR). The mainstream approach for FDR estimation is the target-decoy strategy, which searches a target-decoy concatenated database so that the number of false positive protein identifications can be estimated from the number of decoy proteins. For instance, the MAYU method () is a typical representative in this category. By adapting the target-decoy strategy to the protein inference task, the MAYU method first assumes that protein identifications containing false positive peptide-spectrum matches are uniformly distributed over the target database. Then, the number of false positive protein identifications is hypergeometrically distributed. As a result, the expected number of false positive protein identifications can be calculated as the probability weighted average. Finally, the protein identification FDR is computed as the ratio of the expected number of false positive protein identifications and the total amount of protein identifications mapping to the target database. However, this valuable approach has certain drawbacks (). First, searching both the target and the decoy database will certainly double the running time in the protein identification process. Second, the FDR estimation result may be unstable, as we usually use only one decoy database with the same size of target database. Finally, the protein FDR value is calculated according to the distribution of decoy peptides across different proteins, making it possible to propagate errors at the peptide level to the protein level in a non-trivial manner. In this article, we propose a new method for estimating the FDR at the protein level without searching the decoy database. Our method uses random permutation to assess the statistical significance of each protein in terms of P-value and then calculates the final FDR. First, the input for the protein inference problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph: the left is a set of identified peptides and the right is the set of candidate *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

From this bipartite graph, a protein inference algorithm calculates the probability or score for each protein. The null hypothesis in our method is that each candidate protein matches an identified peptide totally at random. Under this null hypothesis, we first create multiple random bipartite graphs with the same set of peptides and proteins. Each random bipartite graph has the same structure as the original one, i.e. each protein (peptide) is connected to the same number of peptides (proteins). Then, we run the same protein inference algorithm on these random bipartite graphs, and check if the score of each protein is significantly different on the real graph than on the randomized graphs. That is, we calculate the permutation P-value of one protein as the percentage of random graphs that produce a larger score than its original score. Finally, we sort the proteins according to their P-values and calculate the FDR at different thresholds with permutation P-values as input using the method in Storey and Tibshirani (2003). Our method has three key steps: (i) generating random bipartite graphs with the same structure; (ii) calculating the protein scores on these random graphs; and (iii) calculating the permutation P-value and FDR. Among these steps, it is relatively easy to perform the first step and the third step. However, it is timeconsuming or prohibitive to execute some protein inference algorithms for thousands of times to fulfill step ii. To address this issue, we first train a linear regression model using the original bipartite graph and identification scores given by the target inference algorithm. Then, we use the learned regression model as a substitute of original protein inference method to predict protein scores on shuffled graphs. Experimental results on several real proteomics datasets show that our method is effective in FDR calculation. Overall, the salient features of the work described in this article can be summarized as follows:It can calculate the FDR without using a decoy database. It can be applied to evaluate the protein identification results from any algorithm that outputs protein probabilities/ scores. The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our method in detail, Section 3 presents the experimental results and Section 4 concludes the article.
CONCLUSIONIn this article, we propose a novel protein-level FDR estimation method. We assume that each candidate protein matches an identified peptide totally at random. Then, we use random permutation for assessing the statistical significance of each protein in terms of P-value and calculate the final FDR. The main advantage is that our method can calculate FDR without searching a decoy database. Experimental results on six proteomics datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. In the future work, we will extend our method to validate the inference results of the algorithms that do not report protein probabilities or scores. We plan to train a logistic regression model, which can assign a corresponding probability to.

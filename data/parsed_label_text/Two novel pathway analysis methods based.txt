Motivation: Over the past few years several pathway analysis methods have been proposed for exploring and enhancing the analysis of genome-wide association data. Hierarchical models have been advocated as a way to integrate SNP and pathway effects in the same model, but their computational complexity has prevented them being applied on a genome-wide scale to date. Methods: We present two novel methods for identifying associated pathways. In the proposed hierarchical model, the SNP effects are analytically integrated out of the analysis, allowing computationally tractable model fitting to genome-wide data. The first method uses Bayes factors for calculating the effect of the pathways, whereas the second method uses a machine learning algorithm and adaptive lasso for finding a sparse solution of associated pathways. Results: The performance of the proposed methods was explored on both simulated and real data. The results of the simulation study showed that the methods outperformed some well-established association methods: the commonly used Fishers method for combining P-values and also the recently published BGSA. The methods were applied to two genome-wide association study datasets that aimed to find the genetic structure of platelet function and body mass index, respectively. The results of the analyses replicated the results of previously published pathway analysis of these phenotypes but also identified novel pathways that are potentially involved.
INTRODUCTIONIt is increasingly recognized that pathway analysis can support exploration of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data by incorporating the available biological knowledge of genes and pathways. Pathway analysis has gained great popularity over the past few years and several methods have been proposed (). One of the first proposed and most popular pathway analysis methods for GWAS data is gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). GSEA was originally proposed for pathway analysis of gene expression microarray data and later adjusted byfor GWAS data. GSEA tests the null hypothesis that the pathway genes (or SNPs) are no more associated with the studied phenotype than the non-pathway genes (or SNPs), and is an enrichment method in the terminology of Goeman and Buhlmann (2007). Other pathway analysis methods include Fisher's method (FM): its test statistic depends on the product of the pathway gene (SNP) P-values. In addition,proposed the adaptive rank truncated product method (ARTP) for pathway analysis of GWAS data. The ARTP method is a generalization of FM based on the product of the most significant pathway gene (or SNP) P-values. The number of the smallest P-values multiplied is found through a permutation procedure. In addition, a number of online bioinformatics tools have made their appearance over the recent years that test whether the pathway in question contains more significant genes than expected by chance, using either the hypergeometric test or Fisher's exact test. Most of the current pathway analysis methods are frequentist methods that depend on the results of single SNP analysis. In this article, two novel methods are proposed that are based on a hierarchical framework that models both pathway and SNP level effects. As discussed by, hierarchical modelling is another form of pathway association testing.pointed out that hierarchical modelling and shrinkage techniques have not been widely used in pathway analysis. On the other hand, Bayesian hierarchical modelling is discussed as a powerful technique in decreasing the signal to noise ratio in GWAS and for handling the problems of multiple comparisons observed in several statistical applications, for example, analyzing GWAS data (). Few pathway analysis methods have been published that use hierarchical modelling for identifying associated pathways. Two are the BGSA method suggested byand the method proposed by. BGSA is based on a two-level hierarchical model, where in the first level the unsquared CochranArmitage statistics of the lead SNP of each gene are assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean zero. A scaled-inverse-2 distribution is assumed for the variance *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

On the second level, a mixture of scaledinverse-2 distributions is assumed for the variance of the gene parameters of each pathway. A P-value of association between the tested pathway and the phenotype is computed using Markov chain Monte Carlo.proposed a mixed model that includes a fixed effects component that represents the mean disease contribution of a tested pathway and a random effects component that represents how the association of the pathway gene members with the disease varies around the pathway mean. As discussed by those authors, the proposed model allows information to be borrowed across genes in the same pathway. It further corrects for LD between SNPs and for the presence of overlapping genes. In contrast to the methods proposed byand, the two methods proposed in this article use the individual genotype data and do not depend on the results of single SNP analysis. Furthermore, in contrast to other hierarchical models that incorporate either the SNP-pathway membership or the gene-pathway membership in the second stage of their multilevel models (), our framework models hundreds of SNPs and pathways instead of a small selection of them. Furthermore, our methods do not depend on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for identifying associated pathways. The two methods differ in the prior distribution assumed for the pathway parameters. The first method assumes a normal distribution for the pathway parameters with mean zero and diagonal variancecovariance matrix with equal entries. It uses Bayes factors to test whether the pathways are associated with the phenotype. The second method assumes a normal distribution with mean zero and a diagonal variancecovariance matrix whose entries are not necessarily equal. This method adapts an iterative algorithm proposed bythat uses an adaptive lasso algorithm that shrinks the diagonal entries towards zero. In this article, this algorithm is adapted for finding the set of associated pathways that explain the most variation of the studied phenotype. First, the two proposed methods were applied to simulated data. Then, we applied the two proposed methods to two different GWAS studies that have been previously described by. The first GWAS, which we refer to as the Platelets GWAS, aims to find the genetic structure of platelet function. These data were first presented by). The second GWAS, which we refer to as the EPICNorfolk GWAS, aims to find the genetic structure of body mass index (BMI), as part of the EPIC-Norfolk study ().
DISCUSSIONIn this article, a Bayesian hierarchical framework is proposed that incorporates pathway membership of SNPs through a two-level hierarchical model for identifying pathways associated with a phenotype. The phenotype of an individual is modelled to depend on both, its genotype and on a common contribution from alleles in each pathway. The SNP effects, over the common contribution from pathways they are members of, are assumed to be distributed identically and independently. These SNP effects are considered nuisance parameters and integrated out of the analysis so that the pathways associated with the disease can be identified. Intuitively, as is typical for random effects models, integration over SNP effect implies a correlation structure in the noise that is dependent on genotypes: individuals with similar genotypes show similar deviations from expected values of the regression model. Within this hierarchical setting, we proposed two methods for selecting pathways as predictor variables for the phenotype. The NBF and the SNAL methods test the predictive power of a pathway, and hence its association with the phenotype. NBF uses the BF of the model that drops the pathway of interest over the full model that includes all pathways [see. An alternative way to test for association was to compute the BF of the model with no pathways included over the one that includes the pathway of interest, which shows similar, slightly inferior, performance as FM (data not shown) and has not been further considered here. Alternatively, a full model selection with a combinatorial search over all possible sets of pathways could be performed but would be computationally demanding and has also not been considered here. On the other hand, SNAL balances sparsity of predictors with explanatory power. The iterative algorithm proposed byThe simulation study showed that both SNAL and NBF are able to identify pathways associated with the phenotype. Further, the performance of NBF improves with increasing pathway size, whereas that of SNAL is unaffected by the size of the pathways. This can be explained by the fact that some of the smaller pathways are subsets of larger pathways. Therefore, the predictors of the model are correlated, and NBF finds sparser solutions with good predictive behaviour by dropping some of these pathways. NBF has the advantage over SNAL to be easily parallelized. The computing time of SNAL crucially depends on the algorithm used for a subroutine solving an l 1 norm regularization problem. We used the least angle regression algorithm in this study. Depending on the number of predictors, other algorithms, for example, based on coordinate descents (), could perform well. The two methods were applied to the data of two GWAS on the genetic structure of platelets function and body mass index. Through simulation, suitable hyper-parameters of NBF and SNAL were found, as well as the appropriate BF cut-off and tuning parameter 2 that gave an FPR of 0.05. As we pointed out in Section 2.4, the smaller the value of 2 the more shrinkage is applied and the fewer associated pathways are found. The shrinkage parameter 2 of SNAL, when applied to the BMI dataset, was found to be 1.4, larger than the one of the Platelets GWAS of 0.5. As discussed earlier, this is probably due to the variation of the studied phenotype and the number of correlated variables within the model. SNAL identified more pathways for BMI than NBF, whereas NBF found more pathways for platelet function than SNAL. The results of the simulations showed that the methods outperform both FM and BGSA. BGSA is one of the recently published methods for pathway analysis that uses hierarchical modelling for identifying associated pathways.compared BGSA with the well-known pathway enrichment methods ALIGATOR () and GSEA. The results of their analysis showed that the BGSA outperforms both methods. In addition, we have recently published a comparison of current pathway analysis methods (). Three well-known association methods were adapted to test the competitive null hypothesis that the pathway genes are no more associated than the non-pathway genes. The three adapted association methods, tail strength measure, FM and ARTP, were compared with competitive methods, hypergeometric test and GSEA. The results of the analysis suggested that ARTP and FM should be preferred for both competitive and association testing. It should be noted that association methods have in principle better performance than competitive methods, as their tested null hypothesis is more stringent (). These results led us to compare our new methods with FM and BGSA. Although the proposed methods are formulated in a Bayesian framework, an advantage is their implementation without timeconsuming Monte Carlo simulation and their ability to deal with both large numbers of tested SNPs and pathways. They are also easily adapted to include other functional information on the SNPs in the design matrix P. This is comparable with the work of Chen and Witte (2007) but with the difference that our methods can handle larger numbers of SNPs and any individual level covariates. This is potentially important when dealing with structured populations or when allowing for environmental exposures. We have considered a two-level model with SNPs assigned to pathways, but further levels of grouping SNPs, for example in genes, can be easily included potentially improving power by borrowing more information. This approach might be useful when dealing with rare variants that individually contribute little information. Further extensions of our approach are possible to allow for structure within the pathway database, such as the hierarchical organization of the Gene Ontology (The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2000). Finally, proper modelling of nonlinear responses, including ascertained case/control status, will be an important future direction, although we believe that linear modelling yields reasonable power for the small genetic effects typically seen for complex traits.

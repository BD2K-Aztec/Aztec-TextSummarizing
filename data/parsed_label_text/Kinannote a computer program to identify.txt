Motivation: Kinases of the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily are key regulators of most aspects eukaryotic cellular behavior and have provided several drug targets including kinases dysregulated in cancers. The rapid increase in the number of genomic sequences has created an acute need to identify and classify members of this important class of enzymes efficiently and accurately. Results: Kinannote produces a draft kinome and comparative analyses for a predicted proteome using a single line command, and it is currently the only tool that automatically classifies protein kinases using the controlled vocabulary of Hanks and Hunter [Hanks and Hunter (1995)]. A hidden Markov model in combination with a position specific scoring matrix is used by Kinannote to identify kinases, which are subsequently classified using a BLAST comparison with a local version of KinBase, the curated protein kinase dataset from www.kinase.com. Kinannote was tested on the predicted proteomes from four divergent species. The average sensitivity and precision for kinome retrieval from the test species are 94.4 and 96.8%. The ability of Kinannote to classify identified kinases was also evaluated, and the average sensitivity and precision for full classification of conserved kinases are 71.5 and 82.5%, respectively. Kinannote has had a significant impact on eukaryotic genome annotation, providing protein kinase annotations for 36 genomes made public by the Broad Institute in the period spanning 2009 to the present. Availability: Kinannote is freely available at http://sourceforge.net/pro jects/kinannote.
INTRODUCTIONProtein kinases are well-studied enzymes involved in the regulation of the majority of eukaryotic cellular processes. Mutations in protein kinases frequently cause human disease, and kinases have provided several drug targets (). Protein kinases act by transferring phosphate groups from ATP to the amino acid side chains of target proteins, a modification that often profoundly alters the biological activity of the target molecule. There are hundreds of types of protein kinases, which, despite their common mechanism, act specifically on diverse substrates and are themselves acted on by diverse regulators. The complete set of protein kinases, or kinome, encoded in an organism's genome, has a profound impact on the biological properties of that organism. For example, the advent of the tyrosine kinase (TK) group, of kinases (protein kinase category abbreviations are in Supplementary) correlates with the rise of the metazoans (). It is often possible to infer the function or specificity of a kinase discovered in a new organism by comparison with known examples, as many kinases are well conserved. The task of relating a new kinase to a known one has been facilitated by work on the classification and evolution of protein kinases () and KinBase (www. kinase.com). These studies show that most protein kinases belong to the eukaryotic protein kinase (ePK) superfamily, whose members share a common ancestry and fold. The ePK superfamily is divided into eight major groups, which are themselves divided into families and subfamilies (Supplementary), although not all families fall within one of the major groups. Most ePKs are recognized by similarity to hidden Markov profiles such as the Pkinase.hmm (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/), but members of several families are divergent and are often overlooked in searches targeted toward typical kinases. Although a core set of the ePKs is conserved across eukaryotes, this superfamily is plastic and prone to expansion (). The hierarchical structure of the classification system of Hanks, Hunter and Manning is well-suited to handle this plasticity, as it allows partial classification of newly discovered kinases and informatively describes relationships between similar but non-orthologous kinases. A much smaller number of protein kinases, designated atypical protein kinases (aPKs), have either limited similarity to ePKs (protein kinase-like sequences, or PKLs), or differ from them altogether, and also differ from each other (). Well-conserved aPKs have been annotated in several curated kinomes (), and are included in KinBase (www.kinase.com). The surge in the availability of genomic data has created a need to automate identification and classification of conserved *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013.

Current identification methods favor searches against protein kinase hidden Markov models (HMMs) from Pfam () or Kinomer (), and searches against position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) from the Conserved Domain Database (). These methods effectively identify average kinases but are often unable to identify novel or divergent superfamily members; moreover, classification based on Pfam and Kinomer HMMs does not exceed the group level. Sequence similarity searches against a specialized database (e.g. KinBase) provide more complete classification of kinases from families represented in the database, but results for novel kinases may be difficult to interpret, and the diversity of the ePK superfamily does not lend itself to application of a universal score threshold. Orthology-based methods () can provide accurate classification, but their success hinges on the availability of appropriate reference data. An ortholog must be present and identified in the reference genome to make a classification in the target genome; thus, nonorthologous kinases will be overlooked. None of the aforementioned methods are able to generate an accurate kinome without manual curation by a knowledgeable user, and therefore are not viable solutions to high-throughput kinase annotation. Here, we present Kinannote, an ePK identification and classification package that leverages a protein kinase HMM and similarity with known kinases to produce a high-quality draft kinome for a given gene set with a single command. Kinannote depends on two readily available third-party programs (BLAST and HMMER), and its input is a single fasta-formatted file, which may contain the complete set of predicted proteins from an organism, or as few as one sequence. The classifications produced by Kinannote are constructed according to the controlled vocabulary introduced by Hanks and Hunter (1995) and maintained at www.kinase.com. This allows information about related kinases to be directly mapped to newly classified kinases from the literature and resources such as ProKinO (), the Protein Kinase Resource (), KinG () and PhosphoSite (). Kinannote generates several files, including a table of kinases and their classifications and phylogenetic profiles of discovered kinases. We show that Kinannote performs well on four reference kinomes broadly representative of the eukaryotic tree-of-life (Amphimedon queenslandica, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum and Giardia lamblia) and describe its use to provide kinome annotations for 36 eukaryotic genomes released by The Broad Institute from 2009 through the time of publication (www.broadinstitute.org).

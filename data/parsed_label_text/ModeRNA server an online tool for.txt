The diverse functional roles of non-coding RNA molecules are determined by their underlying structure. ModeRNA server is an online tool for RNA 3D structure modeling by the comparative approach, based on a template RNA structure and a user-defined target-template sequence alignment. It offers an option to search for potential templates, given the target sequence. The server also provides tools for analyzing, editing and formatting of RNA structure files. It facilitates the use of the ModeRNA software and offers new options in comparison to the standalone program. Availability and implementation: ModeRNA server was implemented using the Python language and the Django web framework. It is freely available at http://magi.ucsd.edu.
INTRODUCTIONNon-coding RNAs have important catalytic and regulatory functions in organisms from all domains of life. The high costs and numerous obstacles in nucleic acid structure determination prompted the development of in silico RNA modeling methods, in analogy to similar efforts in the protein structure modeling field (). One successful approach is comparative modeling, based on the experimental observation that in evolutionarily related RNAs, 3D structure is typically more conserved than sequence (). We have recently developed ModeRNA, a standalone tool for RNA 3D structure prediction based on the comparative modeling approach (). Here, we present a web server, which considerably extends the functionality of our original method.

The wide variety of published approaches for the problem of regulatory network inference makes using multiple inference algorithms complex and time-consuming. Network Analysis and Inference Library (NAIL) is a set of software tools to simplify the range of computational activities involved in regulatory network inference. It uses a modular approach to connect different network inference algorithms to the same visualization and network-based analyses. NAIL is technology-independent and includes an interface layer to allow easy integration of components into other applications. Availability and implementation: NAIL is implemented in MATLAB, runs on Windows, Linux and OSX, and is available from SourceForge at https://sourceforge.net/projects/nailsystemsbiology/ for all researchers to use.
INTRODUCTIONModelling biological systems as networks (graphs) is becoming a common approach in the life sciences. Specifically, inferring regulatory networks from genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data is now giving insight into how biological systems function in healthy and pathological states (). In a clinical context, 'network medicine' is becoming increasingly important in developing treatments for complex multifactorial conditions ().

ChIP-Seq data are a new challenge for motif discovery. Such a data typically consists of thousands of DNA segments with base-specific coverage values. We present a new version of our DNA motif discovery software ChIPMunk adapted for ChIP-Seq data. ChIPMunk is an iterative algorithm that combines greedy optimization with bootstrapping and uses coverage profiles as motif positional preferences. ChIPMunk does not require truncation of long DNA segments and it is practical for processing up to tens of thousands of data sequences. Comparison with traditional (MEME) or ChIP-Seq-oriented (HMS) motif discovery tools shows that ChIPMunk identifies the correct motifs with the same or better quality but works dramatically faster.
INTRODUCTIONChIP-Seq () is an efficient technology for the identification of DNA sites of a specific protein binding. Being coupled with peak finding algorithms (), it yields a set of DNA segments with each sequence position having a weight reflecting how often DNA nearby was cross-linked with the protein of interest during ChIP stage (the so-called peaks). There can be tens of thousands of DNA segment, some longer than 1000 bp. Classic tools like Weeder (), Gibbs Sampler () or MEME () were tested for motif discovery in ChIP-Seq segments, but proved to be inefficient for the whole amount of data. Therefore, a fraction of top DNA segments was usually taken () or/and the segments were truncated around the peak maxima (). Tools like cERMIT () and HMS () have been developed for motif discovery from ChIP-Seq data. In this note, we present a motif discovery algorithm that can extract the single optimal motif from large datasets like ChIP-Seq without any preprocessing, while taking into account the peak shape. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

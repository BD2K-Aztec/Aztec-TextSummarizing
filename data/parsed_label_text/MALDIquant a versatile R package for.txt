MALDIquant is an R package providing a complete and modular analysis pipeline for quantitative analysis of mass spectro-metry data. MALDIquant is specifically designed with application in clinical diagnostics in mind and implements sophisticated routines for importing raw data, preprocessing, non-linear peak alignment and calibration. It also handles technical replicates as well as spectra with unequal resolution. Availability: MALDIquant and its associated R packages readBrukerFlexData and readMzXmlData are freely available from the R archive CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org).
INTRODUCTIONMass spectrometry profiling is increasingly becoming an important tool in clinical diagnostics, for example to identify biomarkers for cancer (e.g.). Similarly as with other high-throughput technologies, sophisticated statistical algorithms are essential in the analysis of spectrometry data (). We have developed MALDIquant to provide a complete opensource analysis pipeline on the R platform (R Development) comprising all steps from importing of raw data, preprocessing (e.g. baseline removal), peak detection and non-linear peak alignment to calibration of mass spectra. MALDIquant is written as a standalone package using S4 object-oriented programming to facilitate further extension. MALDIquant was initially developed for clinical proteomics using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) technology. However, the algorithms implemented in MALDIquant are generic and may be equally applied to other 2D mass spectrometry data.

Different experimental results suggest the presence of an interplay between global transcriptional regulation and chromosome spatial organization in bacteria. The identification and clear visualization of spatial clusters of contiguous genes targeted by specific DNA-binding proteins or sensitive to nucleoid perturbations can elucidate links between nucleoid structure and gene expression patterns. Similarly, statistical analysis to assess correlations between results from independent experiments can provide the integrated analysis needed in this line of research. NuST (Nucleoid Survey tools), based on the Escherichia coli genome, gives the non-expert the possibility to analyze the aggregation of genes or loci sets along the genome coordinate, at different scales of observation. It is useful to discover correlations between different sources of data (e.g. expression, binding or genomic data) and genome organization. A user can use it on datasets in the form of gene lists coming from his/her own experiments or bioinformatic analyses, but also make use of the internal database, which collects data from many published studies. Availability and Implementation: NuST is a web server (available at http://www.lgm.upmc.fr/nust/). The website is implemented in PHP, SQLite and Ajax, with all major browsers supported, while the core algorithms are optimized and implemented in C. NuST has an extensive help page and provides a direct visualization of results as well as different downloadable file formats. A template Perl code for automated access to the web server can be downloaded at http://www.lgm.upmc.fr/nust/downloads/, in order to allow the users to use NuST in systematic bioinformatic analyses.

Motivation: Systematic and scalable parameter estimation is a key to construct complex gene regulatory models and to ultimately facilitate an integrative systems biology approach to quantitatively understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning gene regulation. Results: Here, we report a novel framework for efficient and scalable parameter estimation that focuses specifically on modeling of gene circuits. Exploiting the structure commonly found in gene circuit models, this framework decomposes a system of coupled rate equations into individual ones and efficiently integrates them separately to reconstruct the mean time evolution of the gene products. The accuracy of the parameter estimates is refined by iteratively increasing the accuracy of numerical integration using the model structure. As a case study, we applied our framework to four gene circuit models with complex dynamics based on three synthetic datasets and one time series microarray data set. We compared our framework to three state-of-the-art parameter estimation methods and found that our approach consistently generated higher quality parameter solutions efficiently. Although many general-purpose parameter estimation methods have been applied for modeling of gene circuits, our results suggest that the use of more tailored approaches to use domain-specific information may be a key to reverse engineering of complex biological systems.
INTRODUCTIONA quantitative understanding of how expression of genes is controlled in time and space through the integration of computational and experimental methods is a main goal of molecular systems biology (). Among the major obstacles in such an integrative systems biology approach is the construction of kinetic models that quantitatively support the current knowledge of a given gene circuit. What makes the construction of gene circuit models especially difficult is the quantification of all reaction parameters, as direct measurements of gene regulation kinetics are seldom available. Thus, model parameters are often estimated indirectly using more readily available experimental data [e.g.. Even in modeling of relatively well-known gene circuits, such as the phage-l lysislysogeny developmental pathway (), there are a number of unknown parameters, which are phenomenologically determined by fitting the model's outputs to some experimental observations. The quality of time series gene expression data is crucial to the construction of phenomenological models that accurately capture the observed dynamical characteristics of a given gene circuit. With advances in the gene expression detection technologies, single-molecule level measurements of gene expression can now be obtained in a wide range of organisms (). In particular, recent advances in fluorescence imaging techniques () facilitate real-time measurements of gene expression at the single-molecule level, making more accurate parameter estimation for quantitative modeling of gene circuits possible. Such single-cell gene expression data are, however, noisy because of intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations () and often limited to lower concentration molecular species such as mRNAs (). Because of such noisy gene expression and highly nonlinear dynamics involved in transcriptional regulations, manual parameter estimation in nontrivial gene circuit models is generally infeasible. To systematically estimate the parameters of a biochemical kinetic model, the parameter estimation problem is often treated as an optimization problem in which parameter values are selected to minimize a certain objective function (). Although several stochastic optimization and Bayesian-based methods were successfully applied to estimate parameters of biochemical models (), they often suffer from scalability problems when there are a large number of unknown parameters. To make the estimation of parameters more efficient, several methods have been proposed to reduce the parameter search space by decomposing rate equations (). However, the quality of these methods strongly depends on interpolation and smoothing functions, which are often independent of the underlying model structure and can add strong artifacts. Recently, Kalman filter-based approaches, which can alleviate the scalability problem, were applied to efficiently estimate kinetic parameters (). Although these approaches support parameter estimation of models with unobserved variables, a *To whom all correspondence should be addressed. y The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors.

Most of these existing methods are applicable to parameter estimation problems of generic dynamical models, as they do not demand any domain-specific knowledge. Although these general-purpose methods can easily be applied to modeling of any biological systems, it is clear that each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, and that no single method is versatile enough to efficiently give optimal parameter sets for all biological models. This observation has led us to develop a more tailored parameter estimation method that focuses on a specific yet important subclass of biological models, namely, gene circuit models. To facilitate the mechanistic construction of thermodynamicsbased models (;) that describe the quantitative behavior of gene regulation from time series mRNA data, we developed a novel parameter estimation framework called Parameter Estimation by Decomposition and Integration (PEDI) that specifically focuses on modeling of gene circuits. The main paradigm of PEDI is 'divide' and 'conquer'; by using the given mRNA data and exploiting the structure of gene circuit models, our framework divides a high-dimensional parameter estimation problem into subproblems with a much smaller parameter space, each of which is, in turn, conquered (i.e. solved) by using any constrained optimization method. At the initial step, this problem reduction process leads to a crude linearization for numerical integrations, which often results in poor estimates especially for highly nonlinear systems. To improve the quality of the estimate with a basically negligible increase in computing time, PEDI places intermediate integration points using the underlying structural information of a given gene circuit model and iteratively increases the accuracy of these intermediate points to increase the accuracy of the numerical integration, which in turn improves the reconstructed dynamics. This article introduces PEDI and, through the use of simulated annealing (SA) as the optimization method, applies the framework to three-gene circuit models with complex dynamics based on synthetic time series mRNA datasets and one yeast gene circuit model based on time series microarray data. We compared PEDI with three state-of-the-art parameter estimation methods, namely, the evolutionary strategy with stochastic ranking (SRES) (), the moment matching method coupled with hybrid extended Kalman filter (HEKF  MM) () and the two-phase dynamic decoupling method (TDDM) (). Our results show that PEDI consistently produced the most accurate estimates efficiently in all the four parameter estimation experiments. This study, thus, demonstrated that PEDI could provide an effective approach to efficiently estimating kinetic parameters of gene circuit models.
DISCUSSIONThe parameter estimation problem in modeling of biological systems is challenging, as it usually involves many (often infinite) suboptimal solutions. Efficient and scalable parameter estimation is crucial to the systematic construction of quantitative models that support existing knowledge of complex biological systems and, more broadly, to the success of integrative systems biology going forward. Here, we have introduced a novel computational framework, which, instead of considering general applicability, is customized especially for parameter estimation of gene circuit models. To see how PEDI performs in comparison with state-of-the-art parameter estimation methods, we applied SRES, HEKF  MM and TDDM to the parameter estimation of the same gene circuit models with the same datasets. We found that PEDI consistently gave the most accurate estimates in a. The reconstructed dynamics from the best parameter solution of PEDI for the yeast feed-forward loop model. The dynamics of mRNA GCN4 was estimated by a smooth piecewise polynomial function. PEDI predicted the dynamics of mRNAs, LEU3 and ILV5 i105 A framework for scalable parameter estimation computationally efficient matter. To test how PEDI performs given experimental gene expression data, we applied it to modeling of a yeast gene circuit from time series microarray data. We found that the reconstructed dynamics from PEDI closely agreed with the experimental data, and by analyzing the estimated parameter set, we were also able to make a testable hypothesis for an underlying regulatory mechanism of this gene circuit. Although PEDI can be applied to gene circuits with an arbitrary size and degree of transcriptional interaction connectivity, there are some limitations. For example, PEDI cannot directly support gene regulatory models including transcriptional elongation and posttranscriptional modifications. Although we can relax the conditions of PEDI so as to support more generic biological models by not requiring a model to have the form described by Equation (3), the efficiency and the accuracy of the model decomposition might decrease. While acknowledging the limited scope of the applicability, we believe that the value of a more tailored approach to the gene circuit domain far exceeds such potential drawbacks because of the importance of transcriptional regulation in quantitative understandings of cellular systems. By narrowing down our focus to gene circuit models, our customized approach was able to display two main advantages over the general parameter estimation methods: (i) it can make more appropriate assumptions about the kinds of gene expression data available for parameter estimation and (ii) it can exploit the structural information on gene circuit modelsin particular, statistical thermodynamic-based gene circuit models. An additional practical benefit of PEDI is that it is relatively easy to implement in a lower level language such as C.

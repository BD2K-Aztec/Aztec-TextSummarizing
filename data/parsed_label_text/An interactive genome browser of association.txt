High-throughput sequencing technologies survey genetic variation at genome scale and are increasingly used to study the contribution of rare and low-frequency genetic variants to human traits. As part of the Cohorts arm of the UK10K project, genetic variants called from low-read depth (average 7Ã‚) whole genome sequencing of 3621 cohort individuals were analysed for statistical associations with 64 different phenotypic traits of biomedical importance. Here, we describe a novel genome browser based on the Biodalliance platform developed to provide interactive access to the association results of the project. Availability and implementation: The browser is available at http://\MNw.uk10k.org/dalliance.html.Source
IntroductionRare and low-frequency genetic variants play an important role in determining population variance of complex traits and disease; however, until recently their systematic evaluation has been beyond the reach of empirical population-based genetic studies. The UK10K project was designed to characterize rare and lowfrequency variation in the UK genome wide, and study its contribution to a broad spectrum of biomedically relevant quantitative traits and diseases with different predicted genetic architectures. The data generated by the different arms of the UK10K project and their use are described elsewhere (UK10K). Here, we describe the development of a novel browser for genetic association data based on the Biodalliance platform (), designed to facilitate the retrieval of genotypephenotype association results from the UK10K-cohorts arm of the project, and their visualization in the context of different annotation features (). In particular, we developed a novel interactive display for genetic variants showing both the strength of association with a trait, and the pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) within the cohort.

We provide a Bioconductor package with quality assessment, processing and visualization tools for high-throughput sequencing data, with emphasis in ChIP-seq and RNA-seq studies. It includes detection of outliers and biases, inefficient immuno-precipitation and overamplification artifacts, de novo identification of read-rich genomic regions and visualization of the location and coverage of genomic region lists.

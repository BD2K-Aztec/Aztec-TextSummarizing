There is a large amount of tools for interactive display of phylogenetic trees. However, there is a shortage of tools for the automation of tree rendering. Scripting phylogenetic graphics would enable the saving of graphical analyses involving numerous and complex tree handling operations and would allow the automation of repetitive tasks. ScripTree is a tool intended to fill this gap. It is an interpreter to be used in batch mode. Phylogenetic graphics instructions, related to tree rendering as well as tree annotation, are stored in a text file and processed in a sequential way. Availability: ScripTree can be used online or downloaded at www.scriptree.org, under the GPL license. Implementation: ScripTree, written in Tcl/Tk, is a cross-platform application available for Windows and Unix-like systems including OS X. It can be used either as a stand-alone package or included in a bioinformatic pipeline and linked to a HTTP
CONCLUSIONScripTree is a tool for scripting phylogenetic graphics. It allows the management of multiple trees and usual kinds of annotations. It can be used either as a stand-alone package or included in a pipeline and linked to a HTTP server. ScripTree is under continuous development, and suggestions of new functionnalities are welcome.

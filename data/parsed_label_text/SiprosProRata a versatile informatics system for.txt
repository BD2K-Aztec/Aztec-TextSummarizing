Sipros/ProRata is an open-source software package for end-to-end data analysis in a wide variety of community proteomics measurements. A database-searching program, Sipros 3.0, was developed for accurate general-purpose protein identification and broad-range post-translational modification searches. Hybrid Message Passing Interface/OpenMP parallelism of the new Sipros architecture allowed its computation to be scalable from desktops to supercom-puters. The upgraded ProRata 3.0 performs label-free quantification and isobaric chemical labeling quantification in addition to metabolic labeling quantification. Sipros/ProRata is a versatile informatics system that enables identification and quantification of proteins and their variants in many types of community proteomics studies.

INTRODUCTIONCommunity proteomics (metaproteomics) aims to characterize the whole protein complement of a microbial community. In a shotgun approach, proteins extracted from environmental samples of microbial communities are digested with trypsin into a more complex peptide mixture. Peptides are then separated by liquid chromatography and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). MS/MS data are searched against translated metagenomic sequences to identify proteins from different members of a microbial community. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins can be identified computationally by searching an expanded peptide space. Abundance changes of identified proteins can be measured between different environmental samples of a microbial community by quantitative proteomics. Common quantification methods include label-free approaches, 15N metabolic labeling and isobaric chemical labeling with TMT and iTRAQ. Here we present a versatile software package for a wide range of community proteomics analysis. The package integrates a redesigned and reimplemented Sipros 3.0 program for highly scalable database searching and an upgraded ProRata 3.0 program for handling all common quantification methods.

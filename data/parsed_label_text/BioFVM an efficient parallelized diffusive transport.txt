Motivation: Computational models of multicellular systems require solving systems of PDEs for release , uptake, decay and diffusion of multiple substrates in 3D, particularly when incorporating the impact of drugs, growth substrates and signaling factors on cell receptors and subcellular systems biology. Results: We introduce BioFVM, a diffusive transport solver tailored to biological problems. BioFVM can simulate release and uptake of many substrates by cell and bulk sources, diffusion and decay in large 3D domains. It has been parallelized with OpenMP, allowing efficient simulations on desk-top workstations or single supercomputer nodes. The code is stable even for large time steps, with linear computational cost scalings. Solutions are first-order accurate in time and second-order accurate in space. The code can be run by itself or as part of a larger simulator. Availability and implementation: BioFVM is written in C þþ with parallelization in OpenMP. It is maintained and available for download at http://BioFVM.MathCancer.org and http://BioFVM.sf.net under the Apache License (v2.0).
IntroductionMathematical modeling of many biological systems requires solving for secretion, diffusion, uptake and decay of multiple substrates in three dimensions. Cells change phenotype (division rate, metabolism, secretions, etc.) in response to their microenvironment; the spatial distribution of cells (and their uptake and secretion of substrates) alters the substrates' distribution, affecting later cell behavior (with zero flux conditions on oX. Here, X is the computational domain with boundary oX; ~ q is the vector of substrate densities, ~ q  are the substrate saturation densities, ~ D are the diffusion coefficients, ~ k are the decay rates, ~ S and ~ U are the supply and uptake rates (may vary throughout the domain), f~ x k ; W k ; ~ S k ; ~ U k ;~ q  k  : 1 k Ntg is a collection of cells centered at ~ x k with volume W k , supply and uptake rates ~ S k and ~ U k and saturation densities ~ q  k. 1 k ~ s is defined by 1 k ~ x  1 inside cell k and 1 k ~ x  0 otherwise. All products of vectors are element-wise. While most multicellular models [e.g. Morpheus (), Chaste (include diffusion solvers, they generally are not designed to scale well to large 3D domains with more than a few substrates. Most are not designed for multithreaded parallelization on multicore desktops. The solvers tend to use explicit time steppings (require strict stability restrictions on Dt) or implicit time steppings (stable but require inverting large matrix systems).

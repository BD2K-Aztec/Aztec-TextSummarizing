The article presents an infrastructure for supporting the semantic interoperability of biomedical resources based on the management (storing and inference-based querying) of their ontology-based annotations. This infrastructure consists of: (i) a repository to store and query ontology-based annotations; (ii) a knowledge base server with an inference engine to support the storage of and reasoning over ontologies used in the annotation of resources; (iii) a set of applications and services allowing interaction with the integrated repository and knowledge base. The infrastructure is being prototyped and developed and evaluated by the RICORDO project in support of the knowledge management of biomedical resources, including physiology and pharmacology models and associated clinical data.

INTRODUCTIONImprovement in computer technology makes it possible to store large volumes of biomedical resources (e.g. mathematical models of physiological processes and related data). The biomedical community is becoming increasingly aware of the importance of annotating this data in order to enable querying and retrieval. As a result, communities are engaged in working together to create annotation standards [e.g. MIRIAM (and biomedical ontologies [e.g. OBO ()] to provide a consistent method of sharing heterogeneous resources. These initiatives have improved the prospect of semantic interoperability of resource annotation based on biology. Nevertheless, reaching this interoperability goal remains a challenge. While simple retrieval based on direct matching of terms used in annotation is certainly straightforward, search using complex descriptions of biological entities denoted by those terms involves possibly demanding reasoning over ontologies. Reasoning is the process by which statements are automatically inferred based on a set of axioms. Automated reasoning enables flexible retrieval of). The applications are deployed in a tomcat application server. The applications interact with (i) the OWL knowledge base which is deployed in a Pellet OWLlink server, and (ii) the virtuoso RDF repository. The application does not require access to original data and model resources, but has to point to a relevant set of IDs, thus resources are depicted outside the box. a knowledge base created by the Pellet OWLlink server, it is possible to query over the ontologies using OWLlink API requests and responses. The infrastructure includes a web application for user interaction with resources, as well as web services that provide programmatic access to the OWL reasoner server. On the client side, the web application is implemented in Google Web Toolkit (http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) and hosted on a Tomcat (http://tomcat.apache.org/) server, with query services running on the server side to interact with the resources. REST ()/JSON (http://www.json.org/) based web services provide external access to the OWL reasoner server, thus enabling the integration of reasoning over large ontologies into third-party applications. The web application supports a number of functionalities, including: (i) the annotation of resources, using a URI for the resource to be annotated and a URI for an ontology term to be associated with that resource, to create a related RDF statement that is stored; (ii) the definition of complex terms based on class expressions in OWL-EL and using terms and relations from biomedical ontologies. We call such defined terms 'composites' (). Defining a composite assigns a unique identifier to this term for the storage and subsequent re-use of its definition; (iii) the querying of resources, achieved in two steps. The first generates a list of ontology terms by querying the OWL knowledge base. The RDF store is then queried for resources annotated with terms from this list. In our current configuration, the knowledge base includes biomedical ontologies relevant to data and model resources. This set of core ontologies (CORDO) includes FMA (), PATO (), GO (), Cell Type (), ChEBI (), HPO and its class definitions (), as well as composite terms developed within RICORDO. The RDF store maps ontology terms according to the) are applied to resolve MIRIAM URNs. An example of a search is to query the RDF store for resources related to volumes of some part of the heart. Finding the relevant ontology terms is achieved by querying the knowledge base, using the Manchester OWL Syntax (). In this use case, PATO_0000918 and inheres-in some (part_of some FMA_7088) represents the class of volumes of a part of the heart. This class definition is used to generate a list of subclasses and equivalent classes from the knowledge base via the OWLlink interface. This list is then passed to the RDF query engine. The application implements a set of templates that allow the formulation of queries. Each template has a particular form to specify the query terms and relations. An example of a query template is relation some term where relation and term refer to an ontology property and a class, respectively. Selecting a particular template generates fields to capture the terms and relations entering into the description of an OWL class. Auto completion of ontology terms and relations in these fields is supported by the Ontology Lookup Service (). Performance of the overall prototype is largely influenced by performance of the OWL reasoning module, thus an initial evaluation of reasoning over the CORDO ontologies was performed. This was carried out on a server with a dual CPU Intel Xeon 2.4 GHz with 24 GB memory. The start up of the KB involves loading the ontologies (90 s) and classification of the ontologies (9.4 min). Query times depend on the complexity of the queries as well as caching. Thus, the results of the query 'PATO_0000918 and inheres-in some (part-of some FMA_7088)' can be retrieved in 0.1 s ().
DISCUSSIONThe prototypical implementation of the infrastructure in the RICORDO context allows searching data and model resources using ontologies. The web applications allow the retrieval and annotation of resources with both terms from reference ontologies and composites of those terms. Web services provide programmatic access to the ontology resources. Future work will include distribution of the RDF store and OWL reasoning. The metadata is stored independently of the annotated resources. This independent storage supports efficient metadata management and preserves both the structural integrity and confidentiality of these resources. Furthermore, the separation of data and ontologies, as well as the subsequent separation of querying of metadata and reasoning over ontologies, allows the storage of large amounts of metadata without affecting the performance of ontological reasoning. The architecture can be employed to support ontologybased metadata management in any area of application. The solution

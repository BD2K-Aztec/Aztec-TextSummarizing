In the context of metagenomics, we introduce a new approach to protein database search called PAUDA, which runs $10 000 times faster than BLASTX, while achieving about one-third of the assignment rate of reads to KEGG orthology groups, and producing gene and taxon abundance profiles that are highly correlated to those obtained with BLASTX. PAUDA requires580 CPU hours to analyze a dataset of 246 million Illumina DNA reads from permafrost soil for which a previous BLASTX analysis (on a subset of 176 million reads) reportedly required 800 000 CPU hours, leading to the same clustering of samples by functional profiles.

Motivation: DNA methylation patterns are well known to vary substantially across cell types or tissues. Hence, existing normalization methods may not be optimal if they do not take this into account. We therefore present a new R package for normalization of data from the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip (Illumina 450 K) built on the concepts in the recently published funNorm method, and introducing cell-type or tissue-type flexibility. Results: funtooNorm is relevant for data sets containing samples from two or more cell or tissue types. A visual display of cross-validated errors informs the choice of the optimal number of
IntroductionRecently, a normalization method was introduced by Fortin et al.). The percentilespecific adjustments in funNorm are the key feature allowing batch effects and technical artefacts to have non-constant influence across the range of signal strengths. However, since methylation patterns may differ substantially across cell types or tissues leading to cell-(or tissue)-type-specific quantiles, optimal normalization adjustments should capture this. Here we present an R package for normalization of Illumina 450 K data, funtooNorm (an extension of the ideas in funNorm) applicable to such heterogeneous data sets.

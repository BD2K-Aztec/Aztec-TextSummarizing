Motivation: For many classes of disease the same genetic risk variants underly many related phenotypes or disease subtypes. Multinomial logistic regression provides an attractive framework to analyze multi-category phenotypes, and explore the genetic relationships between these phenotype categories. We introduce Trinculo, a program that implements a wide range of multinomial analyses in a single fast package that is designed to be easy to use by users of standard genome-wide association study software. Availability and implementation: An open source C implementation, with code and binaries for Linux and Mac OSX, is available for download at http://sourceforge.net/projects/trinculo
IntroductionOf the many associations discovered by genome-wide association studies, a large number are shared across multiple traits (), and many more predict different subtypes of the same disease (). A significant challenge for researchers is finding statistical techniques that leverage this genetic sharing to increase power and discover new biology. Multinomial logistic regression provides a powerful and flexible framework to carry out association analyses across multiple traits. The frequentist version has been used in studies of disease subphenotypes () and in cross-disorder association studies (). Bayesian extensions have been used to select between different models of genetic sharing across multiple traits (). However, these studies have fitted the models in an ad-hoc manner, using inefficient R or STATA packages. The lack of a single, flexible tool for multinomial logistic regression has made using these methods difficult for most users, especially when compared to the availability of fast, user-friendly tools for binary logistic regression such as PLINK (). To address this,we provide a software package that implements a wide range of multi-category logistic analyses in a single efficient and user-friendly program.

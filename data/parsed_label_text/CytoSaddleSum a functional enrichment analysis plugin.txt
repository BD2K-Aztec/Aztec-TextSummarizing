CytoSaddleSum provides Cytoscape users with access to the functionality of SaddleSum, a functional enrichment tool based on sum-of-weight scores. It operates by querying SaddleSum locally (using the standalone version) or remotely (through an HTTP request to a web server). The functional enrichment results are shown as a term relationship network, where nodes represent terms and edges show term relationships. Furthermore, query results are written as Cytoscape attributes allowing easy saving, retrieval and integration into network-based data analysis workflows.

INTRODUCTIONCytoSaddleSum is a Cytoscape () plugin to access the functionality of SaddleSum, an enrichment analysis tool based on sum-of-weights-score (Stojmirovic). Unlike most other enrichment tools, SaddleSum does not require users to directly select significant genes or perform extensive simulations to compute statistics. Instead, it uses weights derived from measurements, such as log expression ratios, to produce a score for each database term. It then estimates, depending on the number of genes involved, the P-value for that score by using the saddlepoint approximation () to the empirical distribution function derived from all weights. This approach was shown (Stojmirovic) to yield accurate P-values and internally consistent retrievals. As a popular and flexible platform for visualization, integration and analysis of network data, Cytoscape allows gene expression data import and hosts numerous plugins for functional enrichment analysis. However, none of these plugins are based on the 'gene set analysis approach' that takes into account gene weights. Therefore, to fill this gap, we have developed CytoSaddleSum, a Cytoscape interface to SaddleSum. To enable several desirable features of CytoSaddleSum, however, we had to significantly extend the original SaddleSum code (see descriptions below). * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

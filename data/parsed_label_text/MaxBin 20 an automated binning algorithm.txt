The recovery of genomes from metagenomic datasets is a critical step to defining the functional roles of the underlying uncultivated populations. We previously developed MaxBin, an automated binning approach for high-throughput recovery of microbial genomes from metage-nomes. Here we present an expanded binning algorithm, MaxBin 2.0, which recovers genomes from co-assembly of a collection of metagenomic datasets. Tests on simulated datasets revealed that MaxBin 2.0 is highly accurate in recovering individual genomes, and the application of MaxBin 2.0 to several metagenomes from environmental samples demonstrated that it could achieve two complementary goals: recovering more bacterial genomes compared to binning a single sample as well as comparing the microbial community composition between different sampling environments. Availability and implementation: MaxBin 2.0 is freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ maxbin/ under BSD license.
IntroductionRecovering individual genomes from metagenomic samples remains a difficult task since sequences of all microbial populations are sampled simultaneously; however, it is a critical procedure to understand the functional potential of the uncultivated microbes in natural and engineered ecosystems. Binning is a process to classify unassembled reads or assembled contigs into discrete clusters, in which one bin represents one genome. Predominant binning approaches include clustering by nucleotide frequencies () or sequence coverages (). Automating the binning process provides a high-throughput method to recover microbial genomes from metagenomes. We previously developed MaxBin (), an automated binnning algorithm that classifies assembled genomic sequences from metagenomic datasets. Based on both tetranucleotide frequencies and sequence coverages, MaxBin automatically estimates the bin number from the target metagenome, classifies the sequences into genome bins, and measures the coverage levels for the binned genomes in the metagenome. In total, 19 and 26 draft genomes were recovered from two cellulolytic bacterial consortia enriched from compost using MaxBin (), demonstrating its utility in recovering the genomes of uncultivated microbes. Recovering genomes from multiple samples may improve the performance of binning algorithms. A differential coverage binning approach was developed to use the coverage information of the contigs from two metagenomic samples to bin genomes by plotting them on a two-dimensional map (). Binning tools that employ multiple samples also demonstrated better performances when V C The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Here we describe MaxBin 2.0, the next generation of the MaxBin algorithm that recovers genomes from co-assembly of multiple metagenomic samples. By exploiting contig coverage levels across multiple metagenomic datasets, MaxBin 2.0 achieves better binning results than binning individual metagenomic samples. In comparison to other binning algorithms that utilize multiple metagenomic datasets, MaxBin 2.0 is highly accurate in recovering genomes from simulated metagenomes. The ability of MaxBin 2.0 to measure the coverage levels of the genome bins also allows comparisons of the genomeresolved microbial community composition across multiple samples.

Microarray technology has become an integral part of biomedical research and increasing amounts of datasets become available through public repositories. However, re-use of these datasets is severely hindered by unstructured, missing or incorrect biological samples information; as well as the wide variety of preprocessing methods in use. The inSilicoDb R/Bioconductor package is a command-line front-end to the InSilico DB, a web-based database currently containing 86 104 expert-curated human Affymetrix expression profiles compiled from 1937 GEO repository series. The use of this package builds on the Bioconductor projects focus on reproducibility by enabling a clear workflow in which not only analysis, but also the retrieval of verified data is supported.
CONCLUSIONThe inSilicoDb R/Bioconductor package provides an efficient means of performing large-scale genomic analysis on the large and growing amount of human Affymetrix gene expression profiles using automated scripting. The accompanying web interface (InSilico DB) allows search and browsing of curated datasets that can then be automatically retrieved, adding a means for reproducible data sourcing to the reproducible analysis platform R/Bioconductor.

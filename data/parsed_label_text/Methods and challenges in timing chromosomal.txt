Motivation: Tumors acquire many chromosomal amplifications, and those acquired early in the lifespan of the tumor may be not only important for tumor growth but also can be used for diagnostic purposes. Many methods infer the order of the accumulation of abnormalities based on their occurrence in a large cohort of patients. Recently, Durinck et al. (2011) and Greenman et al. (2012) developed methods to order a single tumors chromosomal amplifications based on the patterns of mutations accumulated within those regions. This method offers an unprecedented opportunity to assess the etiology of a single tumor sample, but has not been widely evaluated. Results: We show that the model for timing chromosomal amplifications is limited in scope, particularly for regions with high levels of amplification. We also show that the estimation of the order of events can be sensitive for events that occur early in the progression of the tumor and that the partial maximum likelihood method of Greenman et al. (2012) can give biased estimates, particularly for moderate read coverage or normal contamination. We propose a maximum-likelihood estimation procedure that fully accounts for sequencing variability and show that it outperforms the partial maximum likelihood estimation method. We also propose a Bayesian estimation procedure that stabilizes the estimates in certain settings. We implement these methods on a small number of ovarian tumors, and the results suggest possible differences in how the tumors acquired amplifications. Availability and implementation: We provide implementation of these methods in an R package cancerTiming, which is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at http://CRAN.R-project.org/.
INTRODUCTIONTumors accumulate large numbers of mutations and other chromosomal abnormalities due to defects in the genomic repair mechanisms of tumor cells. Not all of these abnormalities are believed to be crucial for tumor growth and progression, and a question of great importance is to try to identify the critical abnormalities. One possible indicator of the importance of an abnormality is when it occurred, relative to other abnormalities. The most straightforward approach for determining the progression of these abnormalities is to evaluate multiple samples from the same individual, such as primary and metastatic samples (), sub-clonal populations (), or different portions of the same tumor (). It is usually difficult to have data on multiple time points in the progression of an individual tumor; rather it is more common to have cross-sectional data with a single time point from multiple individuals. In this case, we cannot directly observe the accumulation of genomic abnormalities and must infer it. There has been a great deal of interest in identifying driver mutations and events based on the frequency of their occurrence across patients (e.g.). Many statistical methodologies rigorously analyze frequencies of aberrations to determine those that are significantly represented in the population, with specific statistical methods developed for mutations, copynumber abnormalities and others types of genomic profiles (). Yet, these techniques do not explicitly attempt to estimate the order of occurrence. Many methods do explicitly estimate a common temporal ordering among samples based on the co-occurrence across patients. Fearon and Vogelstein (1990) first proposed a temporal ordering of mutations based on the mutations in colorectal tumors from different stages. Since then, a great deal of methodological work has formalized this work. For example, oncogenetic tree models () cast this notion in a probabilistic setting, which later work extended and generalized ().modeled the critical elements of tumor progression in neuroblastoma by analyzing the sets of shared mutations between the stages of a tumor and finding the most likely model of progression between stages of aberrations. Other approaches rely on stochastic models of cellular *To whom correspondence should be addressed.This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

This is not an exhaustive review, as many other approaches to this problem exist, but a common feature is estimating a common temporal ordering by comparing across many samples. The simulation study ofcompares estimates of tumor progression that use multiple samples from a single tumor/patient with those obtained from cross-sectional samples from many independent tumors and finds that the crosssectional estimates can be quite misleading due to the heterogeneity of paths to tumorigenesis seen in tumors. In, we introduced a novel approach for temporal ordering of genomic abnormalities that instead focused on assessing from a single sample of a single individual the internal ordering of chromosomal abnormalities. In that work, we dealt with the narrow case of ordering regions of copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (CNLOH), when one copy of the chromosome is deleted and replaced by the other copy.is general in principle and offers a remarkable ability to analyze the history of a single tumor. However, there has been little examination of the performance of the estimates of the temporal orderings. We show that with higher levels of amplification, most events result in non-identifiable models, meaning that most regions with high levels of amplifications cannot be timed in this way. Furthermore, differences in estimation procedures can have important effects on the quality of the estimate, particularly for events that occur early in tumorigenesis, and therefore are of particular biological interest. The method ofuses a partial maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) technique, which can perform badly for early (and late) events. We introduce a full MLE procedure that accounts for sequencing variation, which we show performs better for estimating early events, particularly for samples with moderate read coverage. We also introduce a Bayesian estimation procedure, which can, in some situations, stabilize estimates for early events when there are low numbers of mutations in a region. The implementation of these methods on ovarian tumors, which contain a large number of amplifications, allows for the examination of the general pattern of amplification in ovarian tumors and suggests that there might be two distinct patterns of amplification present: steady accumulation of amplifications over time versus whole-genome amplification. Traditional copy-number analysis examines regions of the normal genome as to whether they are amplified in the tumor, and as such is largely our focus; indeed, this is the only alternative in the case of exon sequencing. If limited to this approach, only regions with one of three types of allelic copy number are viable candidates for the temporal analysis. However, an amplification and insertion of one region of the genome into another creates a different genome with connections between regions that do not exist in the normal genome. In the case of whole-genome sequencing, reads that span such breakpoints will be sequenced and algorithms have been proposed to use these breakpoints to estimate the relationships between these separate regions (). The additional information regarding the connections between regions, when available, has the potential to make specific estimates of timing more feasible.
CONCLUSIONPrecise timing of chromosomal abnormalities provides a wonderfully detailed glimpse of the etiology of a single tumor. However, we have demonstrated that there are limitations to this technique. In particular, we have shown that for high-level amplifications, most of the possible combinations of events that result in large amounts of amplification will not retain enough information in the allele frequencies to be able to estimate the ordering. Only regions where the amplification follows one single lineage can be timed using this model. This may result in a biased impression of the etiology, as this type of amplification may be predominant for the promotion of certain types of abnormalities and may miss many other types of oncogenes. As we note in the introduction, our focus has been the traditional one of copy-number analysis, where each region in the normal genome is analyzed separately as to its behavior in the tumor. With exome sequencing, this traditional viewpoint is still the only one available. With whole-genome sequencing, as we noted, one can analyze the relationships between the regions and order the events using the information from other regions. In this case, a single region A can share an event with another region B if the amplification brought the two into proximity to each other through an insertion. Then there are additional constraints on estimating A and B jointly, as that event must occur at the same moment for both. This implies that with reasonably deep whole-genome sequencing such that these relationships are reliably determined, there will be a larger percentage of histories that are identifiable. In addition, early events, which are of particular biological significance, are sensitive to estimation procedures and large numbers of mutations are necessary to be able have stable estimates of the time of occurrence. Of even greater difficulty is the ordering of a collection of early events. Even with whole-genome sequencing, some regions will not have the hundred or more mutations that our simulations show are necessary to distinguish early events, particularly in tumors with low mutation rates.

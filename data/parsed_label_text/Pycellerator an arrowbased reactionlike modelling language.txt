Motivation: We introduce Pycellerator, a Python library for reading Cellerator arrow notation from standard text files, conversion to differential equations, generating stand-alone Python solvers, and optionally running and plotting the solutions. All of the original Cellerator arrows, which represent reactions ranging from mass action, Michales–Menten–Henri (MMH) and Gene-Regulation (GRN) to Monod–Wyman–Changeaux (MWC), user defined reactions and enzymatic expansions (KMech), were previously represented with the Mathematica extended character set. These are now typed as reaction-like commands in ASCII text files that are read by Pycellerator, which includes a Python command line interface (CLI), a Python application programming interface (API) and an iPython notebook interface. Results: Cellerator reaction arrows are now input in text files. The arrows are parsed by Pycellerator and translated into differential equations in Python, and Python code is automatically generated to solve the system. Time courses are produced by executing the auto-generated Python code. Users have full freedom to modify the solver and utilize the complete set of standard Python tools. The new libraries are completely independent of the old Cellerator software and do not require Mathematica. Availability and implementation: All software is available (GPL) from the github repository at https://github.com/biomathman/pycellerator/releases. Details, including installation instructions and a glossary of acronyms and terms, are given in the Supplementary information.
IntroductionCellerator describes biological interactions with a reaction-like arrow-based input language. Input strings are converted into differential equations and integrated to produce numerical time-course predictions using Mathematica (). Extensions include Cellzilla for two-dimensional tissue simulation () and KMech for exact enzymatic expansion (). There are many tools that convert reactions to differential equations and solve them, particularly in Python, but they do not use an arrow-based language in the same manner as Cellerator. Examples include PySCeS (), which has its own text modeling language; PyDSTool () (for hybrid systems); and pybrn (pybrn.sf.net, for SBML-like structures). Perhaps the closest conceptually to Pycellerator are PySB () and SBML shorthand (). PySB is a rule-based system with a collection of text language rules that are merged into Python commands; models are built as Python programs. SBML Shorthand is not a simulator; it is a pre-processor for converting models into SBML, in which each reaction is represented by a single line of text. In addition, a number of popular stochastic simulation tools are also implemented in Python.Pycellerator also provides a simulation, modelling, programming and analysis interface. In Pycellerator the modelling language corresponds to (and extends) the arrow language introduced in Cellerator. Each arrow corresponds to a Cellerator arrow, but it can now by reprsented with ASCII arrow-like characters. The Pycellerator library provides a command line interface (CLI), an application programming interface (API) and an iPython notebook interface (), so that users have a choice of Python programming environments. Mathematica is not required.
DiscussionPycellerator variables may be specified using an array index notation to represent multiple compartments or multi-stage cascades. A possible future extension to the software would be two and three dimensional tissue based implementations similar to Cellzilla (). Dynamical grammars can also be implemented using a more expressive notation that makes this modelling paradigm significantly more powerful (). Rule-based models, graph grammars and hybrid systems, for example, could be automaticallygenerated using the techniques we have described here.
ConclusionThe Cellerator arrow notation for specifying biological interactions has been implemented in a human-readable text-based language. Parsers could be written in any language. Extensible open source Python libraries are provided for CLI, API and notebook support. The iPython notebook provides Pycellerator with a very convenient front end for modelers who want to combine code, text, markup and figures together in single documents. This is particularly useful for training researchers. The libraries can be used either as a frontend to produce or interact with other solvers or as end-user solvers in of themselves.. Sample output (cutoff) for simulating oscillations in a MAP kinase cascade. This model is structurally identical to () with two modifications: time-dependent input and a competitive feedback reaction. A similar model was proposed by (), and oscillations have been observed in yeast by (). The model file and output code are shown in Supplementary Figures S1 and S4

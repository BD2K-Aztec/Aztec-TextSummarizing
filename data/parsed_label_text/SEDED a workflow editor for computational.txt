The simulation experiment description markup language (SED-ML) is a new community data standard to encode computational biology experiments in a computer-readable XML format. Its widespread adoption will require the development of software support to work with SED-ML files. Here, we describe a software tool, SED-ED, to view, edit, validate and annotate SED-ML documents while shielding end-users from the underlying XML representation. SED-ED supports modellers who wish to create, understand and further develop a simulation description provided in SED-ML format. Availability and implementation: SED-ED is available as a standalone Java application, as an Eclipse plug-in and as an SBSI (www.sbsi.ed.ac.uk) plug-in, all under an MIT open-source license. Source code is at https://sed-ed-sedmleditor.googlecode. com/svn.
INTRODUCTIONThe simulation experiment description markup language (SED-ML) () is an XML language that aims to describe computational biology experiments so that they may be reproduced and exchanged between different software tools. In brief, SED-ML Level 1 encodes uniform time course simulation descriptions. It describes from where to obtain a model, the type of simulation to run and the content and presentation of the simulation output. SEDML is designed to be machine-readable rather than human-readable, and to most modellers, SED-ML should be largely hidden. However, there is a need for curators and SED-ML document editors to easily view, annotate and validate SED-ML files without being exposed to the underlying XML. SED-ED is an application designed to address the needs of these users.

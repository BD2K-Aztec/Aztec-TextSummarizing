We present a tool called MRSD (Metabolic Route Search and Design) to search and design routes based on the weighted compound transform diagraph. The search submodule returns routes between a source and product compound within seconds in the network of one or multiple organisms based on data from KEGG. The design submodule designs a route from an appointed compound in an interactive mode.
INTRODUCTIONWith the advent of post-genomic era and increasing use of computational techniques, great development has taken place in computational prediction in metabolic pathways which has numerous applications in systems biology and synthetic biology, for example, the design of tracer or knockout experiments (). The primary method adopted by current tools for studying the metabolic pathways is to use the traditional algorithms of paths searching to compute the metabolic routes. Related works include Rahnuma (), MetaRoute (), Pathway Hunter Tool (), FMM () and so on. Unlike previous methods, our application takes into account the relative conservation of reactions that can be measured by the reaction's frequency which is equals to the number of organisms that the reaction exists. Also, these tools either have no intermediates constraint or do not give a global and visual view of the search result. Furthermore, the user may want to design a route manually when there is no route to fulfil his needs in the search results; unfortunately, there are currently no tools provide such function, including the tools mentioned above. Here, we described a tool called MRSD (Metabolic Route Search and Design) for searching and designing the metabolic routes based on the different organisms' metabolic networks in KEGG. The search function enables users to perform route search in a weightedPage: 1582 15811582

We introduce ProfileChaser, a web server that allows for querying the Gene Expression Omnibus based on genome-wide patterns of differential expression. Using a novel, content-based approach, ProfileChaser retrieves expression profiles that match the differentially regulated transcriptional programs in a user-supplied experiment. This analysis identifies statistical links to similar expression experiments from the vast array of publicly available data on diseases, drugs, phenotypes and other experimental conditions.
INTRODUCTIONThe introduction of the DNA microarray and other genome-level technologies has provided an unprecedented, systems-level view of cellular transcription. This detailed characterization of gene expression provides a unique opportunity for data-driven discovery of connections between biological conditions and phenotypes. Past work has demonstrated the utility of gene expression-based discovery in predicting the mechanisms of genetic and chemical perturbations () and linking drugs and diseases (), even when integrating data across different platforms and cell types (). While these studies have demonstrated the power of gene expression-based approaches to biological hypothesis generation, few tools exist to exploit the primary molecular data cataloged in repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (). Here we introduce ProfileChaser, a web server that allows for content-based gene expression search with a user-supplied experiment. Our tool mines GEO DataSets for experiments that differentially regulate the same transcriptional programs. ProfileChaser provides an accessible and powerful interface for leveraging public data to inform new * To whom correspondence should be addressed. experiments and predict novel associations between diseases, drugs, genotypes and phenotypes.

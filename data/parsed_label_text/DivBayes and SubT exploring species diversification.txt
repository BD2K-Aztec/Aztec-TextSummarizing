DivBayes is a program to estimate diversification rates from species richness and ages of a set of clades. SubT estimates diversification rates from node heights within a clade. Both programs implement Bayesian statistics and provide the ability to account for uncertainty in the ages of taxa in the underlying data, an improvement over more commonly used maximum likelihood methods. Availability: DivBayes and SubT are released as C++ source code under the GNU GPL v. 3 software license in Supplementary information 1 and 2, respectively, and at
INTRODUCTIONBayesian inference has become a major part of the phylogenetic analysis tool kit, including applications such as topological inference and ancestral state reconstruction (). However, methods of Bayesian inference are still not widely applied to infer species diversification rates, a major field within macroevolution (). Here, we present two new programs that use Bayesian statistics to estimate net diversification rates (speciation minus extinction rate) and relative extinction rate (extinction rate divided by speciation rate) under the Yule or birthdeath model based on two different types of datasets. DivBayes uses the number of species and clade ages of a set of taxa (likelihood formula in), while SubT uses node height data from within a clade (likelihood formula in). Here, clade age data refer to the stem age of a group and may be derived from fossils, dated phylogenies or other sources. Node height data refer to the split between each lineage in a group and are most likely to derive from dated phylogenies.

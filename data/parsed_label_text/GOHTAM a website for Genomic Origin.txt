Motivation: This website allows the detection of horizontal transfers based on a combination of parametric methods and proposes an origin by researching neighbors in a bank of genomic signatures. This bank is also used to research an origin to DNA fragments from metagenomics studies. Results: Different services are provided like the possibility of inferring a phylogenetic tree with sequence signatures or comparing two genomes and displaying the rearrangements that happened since their separation. Availability and implementation: http://
INTRODUCTIONHorizontal transfers (HTs) are a major force of evolution () and this website proposes methods for their detection. The genomic signature was demonstrated to be species-specific () and allows HT detection in terms of tetranucleotide frequencies (). Parametric methods were designed to work only with the information contained in genomic sequences. They rely either on the whole set of genes or on local variations of genomic signature (). Recently, a benchmark has determined the most efficient parametric methods in different conditions and has proposed to use a combination of methods to analyze HTs in genomes (). This site provides user-friendly access to such methods as well as some unique features including signaturebased phylogeny and potential origin of a set of metagenomics sequences.

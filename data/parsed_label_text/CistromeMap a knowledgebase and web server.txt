Transcription and chromatin regulators, and histone modifications play essential roles in gene expression regulation. We have created CistromeMap as a web server to provide a comprehensive knowledgebase of all of the publicly available ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq data in mouse and human. We have also manually curated metadata to ensure annotation consistency, and developed a user-friendly display matrix for quick navigation and retrieval of data for specific factors, cells and papers. Finally, we provide users with summary statistics of ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq studies.
INTRODUCTIONTranscription regulators, chromatin regulators and histone modifications play key roles in eukaryotic gene transcription regulation in normal physiology and diseases (). Here transcription regulators include transcription factors, transcription initiation complexes, mediator complex and transcription co-activators/repressors. Chromatin regulators refer to chromatin-associated factors such as chromatin remodelers, histone modifying enzymes and other factors associated with specific chromosome or nuclear compartments. Mapping the genomewide in vivo locations of these factors and marks is important to understand the mechanisms of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. With the development of high-throughput sequencing, ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq have become popular techniques to

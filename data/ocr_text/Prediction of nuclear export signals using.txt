ABSTRACT

Motivation: Leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NESs) are short
amino acid motifs that mediate binding of cargo proteins to the nuclear
export receptor CRM1, and thus contribute to regulate the localization
and function of many cellular proteins. Computational prediction of
NES motifs is of great interest, but remains a significant challenge.
Results: We have developed a novel approach for amino acid motif
searching that can be used for NES prediction. This approach, termed
Wregex (weighted regular expression), combines regular expressions
with a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), and has been imple-
mented in a web-based, freely available, software tool. By making use
of a PSSM, Wregex provides a score to prioritize candidates for ex-
perimental testing. Key features of Wregex include its flexibility, which
makes it useful for searching other types of protein motifs, and its fast
execution time, which makes it suitable for large-scale analysis. In
comparative tests with previously available prediction tools, Wregex
is shown to offer a good rate of true-positive motifs, while keeping a
smaller number of potential candidates.

1 INTRODUCTION

Computational prediction of protein features is being increas-
ingly applied to investigate several aspects of protein function
and regulation, such as protein—protein interactions (Hooda
and Kim, 2012), post-translational modiﬁcations (Liu and Li,
2011) and subcellular localization (Imai and Nakai, 2010).

In eukaryotic cells, dynamic transport between the nucleus
and the cytoplasm is an important regulatory mechanism for
many cellular proteins. Active nuclear import and export is car-
ried out by soluble receptors termed importins and exportins,
respectively, which escort their cargo proteins through the nu-
clear pore complex (Gdrlich and Kutay, 1999). Importins and
exportins recognize and bind speciﬁc amino acid motifs in their
cargo proteins, which function as nuclear localization signals
(NLSs) or nuclear export signals (NESs). One of the best-studied

types of nuclear transport signal is the leucine-rich NES that
mediates binding of cargo proteins to the nuclear export receptor
CRMl (Hutten and Kehlenbach, 2007).

A leucine-rich NESs typically consists of a short stretch
of amino acids containing several hydrophobic residues (not ne-
cessarily leucine) with a characteristic pattern. Initial
studies of a limited number of NESs (Bogerd et al., 1996; La
Cour et al., 2004) led to propose a consensus NES pattern
[CID1 — (X)2_3 — CD2 — (X)2_3 — CD3 — (X) — CD4], with four con-
served hydrophobic residues (represented by <I>1_4) separated
by a variable number of intervening residues (represented by
X). This consensus pattern has been progressively expanded
and reﬁned through the analysis of a larger number of experi-
mentally conﬁrmed NESs (Fu et al., 2011; Kosugi et al., 2008;
Xu et al., 2012). These studies, mostly based on sequence align-
ment, suggested that residues at positions other than the con-
served <I>1_4 may also contribute to NES activity. For example,
acidic residues Glu, Asp were found to be overrepresented in
functional NESs (La Cour et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2012).
Further insight into NES features has been recently obtained
through structural analyses of the CRMl—NES-binding interface
(Guttler et al., 2010; Monecke et al., 2009). The crystal structures
of CRMl—NES complexes showed that NESs ﬁt into a rigid
hydrophobic groove on the surface of the receptor, and that a
ﬁfth hydrophobic residue (CD0) in the NES, amino-terminal to
CD1, may increase the afﬁnity of the NES/CRMl interaction
(Dong et al., 2009; Guttler et al., 2010; Monecke et al., 2009).
These structural analyses also revealed that acidic residues in
certain positions may contribute to NES afﬁnity by interacting
with a basic surface ﬁanking CRMl hydrophobic groove (Dong
et al., 2009), thus providing a biological explanation to the pre-
viously noted overrepresentation of acidic amino acids in NESs.
Altogether, these previous studies have unveiled the remarkable
complexity of the CRMl-dependent NES.

In addition to the complex nature of the signal, the identiﬁca-
tion of physiologically relevant NESs is further hampered by the
fact that amino acid motifs that conform to the NES pattern may
be found in hydrophobic protein cores, where they would be
unavailable for CRMl binding. A valid strategy for NES iden-
tiﬁcation may begin by mapping amino acid segments with
CRMl-dependent export activity (active NES motifs) in the pro-
tein of interest. If the 3D structure of the protein is known,
the solvent accessibility of these motifs may then be evaluated
and ﬁnally, their physiological relevance can be validated by

mutagenesis. In the ﬁrst step of this strategy, the use of efﬁcient
computer-based NES prediction tools may play an important
role. Several NES-prediction tools have been developed to
date. These include programs that apply regular expressions
derived from the NES consensus pattern, such as ELM (Gould
et al., 2010) as well as machine-learning—based programs, such as
NetNES (La Cour et al., 2004) and NESsential (Fu et al., 2011).

We have recently compared the performance of ELM and
NetNES using these programs to predict candidate NES motifs
in human deubiquitinases (DUBs) (Garcia-Santisteban et al.,
2012). The more recent NESsential program was not available
at the time this comparison was carried out. Predicted candidates
were subsequently tested using an in vivo nuclear export assay
(Henderson and Eleftheriou, 2000). In our hands, the ability of
ELM to identify amino acid motifs with nuclear export activity
was superior to that of NetNES, although the estimated positive
predictive value (26.6% for NetNES and 38.0% for ELM) was
relatively low for both programs (Garcia-Santisteban et al.,
2012).

We have devised and tested a novel approach, termed
weighted regular expressions (\Nregex) that can be applied to
the prediction of functional amino acid motifs, including
NESs. Wregex combines the use of a regular expression with a
position-speciﬁc scoring matrix (PSSM). In the case of NES pre-
diction, the PSSM takes into account the potential contribution
of each NES residue (not those at the conserved hydrophobic
positions) to NES activity.

In this study, we submit Wregex to a series of comparisons
with NESsential and ELM, and progressively optimize its regular
expression and training PSSM. The features of Wregex in com-
parison to these existing tools, as well as the potential application
of Wregex to the identiﬁcation of other functional motifs in pro-
teins besides NESs are discussed. We have implemented Wregex
as a web interface accessible to any researcher.

2 METHODS

2.1 Wregex in the context of protein and motif
searching tools

Figure 1 summarizes the approaches used by different protein— and motif-
searching tools. Tools based on sequence similarity like BLAST (Altschul
et al., 1997) and FASTA (Pearson, 1990) use a substitution matrix for
scoring alignments and allow specifying a sequence gap penalty. These
tools are more indicated for comparing the similarity between proteins
rather than for motif searching. PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) uses
an initial protein—protein BLAST to derive a PSSM, which is then used
for further database search in an iterative manner updating the PSSM in
each iteration. Rather than detecting speciﬁc protein motifs, the aim
of PSI-BLAST is to detect distant relationships between proteins. PHI-
BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) uses both a protein sequence and a
PROSITE (Hulo et al., 2006) regular expression as input. The regular
expression is used to search the database for proteins that are subse-
quently aligned with the input protein sequence using BLAST to obtain
a score, which is computed using a substitution matrix like BLOSUM-62
instead of a PSSM.

Another motif-searching approach consists on machine learning using
a training set of sequences. The most commonly used algorithms in this
approach are hidden Markov model (HMM) and support vector machine
(SVM). The NES prediction tool NetNES (La Cour et al., 2004) belongs
to this category, and uses a combination of both neural networks

Fig. 1. Wregex, a novel tool for amino acid motif searching. Different
approaches for protein and motif searching and selected software tools
related to each approach are shown. Unlike previous tools, Wregex com-
bines regular expressions with a PSSM. Asterisks indicate tools speciﬁc
for NES prediction

and HMM. A more recent NES prediction program, NESsential
(Fu et al., 2011), uses SVM models trained with sequence derived
meta-features, and a pre—ﬁlter consisting on the pattern (I) — (X)2_3
—<I> — (X) — (I). This tool will be further discussed below.

ScanProsite (De Castro et al., 2006) allows to scan the PROSITE
database (Hulo et al., 2006) using either patterns (regular expressions)
or proﬁles (tables of position-speciﬁc amino acid weights and gap costs),
but it does not allow to combine both a regular expression and a
weight matrix. Finally ELM (Gould 61 al., 2010) is a database of eukary-
otic linear motifs described as regular expressions, including the
‘TRG_NES_CRM1_1’ that allows prediction of CRMl-dependent
NES motifs.

The novel motif-searching tool presented in this article, Wregex, com-
bines both a regular expression and a PSSM.

2.2 Algorithm implementation
Wregex uses three type of inputs:

(1) Regular expression (mandatory). Deﬁnes the sequence patterns
and spacings allowed. This expression allows the use of ‘(brackets)’
to deﬁne the groups of amino acids that will be weighted together
later.

(2) PSSM (optional). Deﬁnes the weight of each possible amino acid
for each of the groups marked between ‘(brackets)’ in the regular
expression. These weights are interpreted as the base 10 logarithm
of the amino acid probability. If no PSSM is provided, score of
output candidates will not be available.

(3

v

Fasta database (mandatory). The protein sequence database used
for searching protein motifs using the regular expression and the
PSSM (if provided).

Figure 2 summarizes how Wregex uses these inputs for searching
candidates. Only amino acid sequences matching the regular expression
will be subsequently processed. This selection represents a ﬁrst ﬁlter for
candidate motifs. Next, each of the candidate sequences is subdivided into
smaller amino acid groups according to the regular expression, and
a score is computed using the PSSM values for each group position.
A threshold (arbitrarily selected by the user) can be applied to these
scores, thus introducing a second ﬁlter for candidate NES-motif selection.

Equation (1) is used for computing the score of a motif match; where G
is the number of groups in the regular expression, Jg is the length of the
group number g, Pg is the column g of the PSSM matrix, 10%),g is the

Fig. 3. PSSM calculation using experimentally validated NES motifs with an activity score determined using an export assay. Sequences are ﬁrst aligned
using the groups in the regular expression. The weight of a motif (W) is derived from the assay score (S). If several amino acid combinations in a motif
match the regular expression, the ﬁnal weight (W) of the motif is calculated by dividing W by the number of combinations. When input motifs lacking
an activity score are used for PSSM calculation, the same W value is ascribed to every motif

PSSM value in column g for the amino acid in the position j within the
group g, and len is the length of the sequence matched by the regular
expression.

G Jg

sum 2 Z 19%),5, — max(Pg)) (1)
g=l j=l

score = 10sum/len - 100

In this equation the group position-speciﬁc PSSM value is used as the
score of each amino acid of the match. In order to assign all positions the
same importance, the score is normalized by the maximum PSSM value
of the corresponding group position by subtracting max(Pg). Since we
are considering variable length matches, sum must be normalized by the
match length len. Finally the logarithm is translated into linear scale
resulting in a score ranging from 0 to 1, and then multiplied by 100 to
obtain a score ranging from 0 to 100.

Figure 3 illustrates how the PSSM is calculated in the case of experi-
mentally validated motifs with activity score. These motifs are ﬁrst
aligned using the groups in the regular expression. In case that different
group combinations are possible, all of them are considered and their
weight (w), derived from the activity score (5), will be divided by the
number of combinations, resulting in the ﬁnal weight (w’). Next, for
each group (g) and amino acid (a) a p“, value is computed using

Equation (2); where L is the number of training matches and w/ is the
weight of training match I. In the numerator, the weights w/ are only
added if the amino acid a is the same as the one in the position j of the
current group g for the training match [(a;, j(g)).

When calculating a PSSM using validated motifs without assay score, the
same weight w is ascribed to all sequences. In this case, the pa,g values of the
PSSM in Equation (2) represent the probability that amino acid a is present
in group number g. When different weight values w are considered (derived
from assay score), a similar interpretation can be assumed considering that
w represents the number of occurrences of the corresponding training
match. These PSSM values are expressed in logarithmic scale to facilitate
further operations, and they are rounded to the nearest integer to account
for the statistical sample size. The 10’5 value is added to avoid logarithm of
0, thus resulting in a minimum value of —5 for pa, g. This 10—5 term does not
affect signiﬁcantly the remaining non-zero values (at least two orders of
magnitude above in our tests) because of the integer rounding.

Other web pages not shown include home, documentation and download

The PSSMs used in this article are calculated using experimentally
validated NES motifs. In this regard, it is important to note that those
NES motifs that have been validated using the nuclear export assay de-
veloped by Henderson and Eleftheriou (2000) are assigned an activity
score, (ranging from 1+ to 9+) based on the proportion of transfected
cells showing nuclear, nuclear/cytoplasmic or cytoplasmic localization of
the Rev(1.4)—NES-GFP protein. This score is not available for NES
motifs validated differently.

2.3 Web interface

A web application has been developed using Java 7 and J SF 2.2 running
in a servlet 2.5 compliant web container. The training page (Fig. 4a)
allows to deﬁne a custom regular expression and upload input motifs
as fasta sequences. These motifs can be deﬁned as separate fasta entries,
or annotated as position ranges in the fasta header of protein entries
using the same format provided by ValidNESs (Fu et al., 2013) fasta
download. It is also supported to include a motif weight as an additional
annotation in the fasta headers by appending ‘@weight’ to the motif
position range. Then, a PSSM is computed as described in the previous
subsection using those input motifs matched by the regular expression. If
several amino acid combinations in a single input motif match the regular
expression, the motif weight is divided by the number of combinations.
This process can also be tuned by the user by removing undesired com-
binations. Finally, the PSSM can be downloaded and used later for
custom motif searching.

The search page (Fig. 4b) allows to search a fasta ﬁle for protein
motifs. The motif can be selected from a predeﬁned set or deﬁned by
the user as a custom regular expression with an optional PSSM ﬁle. If the
input fasta ﬁle has header annotations with motifs positions, additional
information is provided stating whether the resulting candidates match
the annotated motifs (e. g. laboratory assay results). By default, if several
candidate motifs overlap in the protein sequence, only the one with the
highest score or the longest sequence is displayed. This option can be
deactivated using the grouping checkbox. In any case, the number of
combinations/overlaps is displayed, as it may be of help when selecting
candidate motifs for testing.

2.4 In vivo nuclear export assay

Candidate NESs were tested using an in vivo nuclear export assay
(Henderson and Eleftheriou, 2000), as previously described (Garcia-
Santisteban et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, double-stranded DNA fragments encod-
ing the candidate NES and ﬂanking residues were cloned into the
pRev(1.4)—GFP vector (a gift from Dr Beric Henderson). HeLa cells,
growing in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium, supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml

streptomycin (all from Invitrogen), were seeded onto sterile glass cover-
slips in 12-well trays. Cells were transfected, 24h later, with the
pRev(1.4)—GFP-based plasmids containing the candidate NESs using
XtremeGENE 9 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) following
manufacturer’s protocol. Using a Zeiss Axioskop ﬂuorescence micro-
scope, the subcellular localization of the ﬂuorescent proteins was deter-
mined in at least 200 cells per sample, and the activity of the functional
NESs was rated between 1+ and 9+ using the scoring system originally
proposed (Henderson and Eleftheriou, 2000). Survivin NES (Engelsma
et al., 2007) and the empty pRev(1.4)—GFP were used as positive and
negative assay controls, respectively. A subset of the candidate NESs
were also tested in HEK 293 cells, showing equal activity proﬁles.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A prominent feature of Wregex is its ﬂexibility. On one hand,
training can be adjusted by deﬁning a ‘training regular expres-
sion’ that matches the input motifs used as training sequences for
computing the PSSM. On the other hand, searching can also be
adjusted for higher or lower stringency, by modifying the
‘searching regular expression’ and selecting a PSSM. Different
settings at the level of training or searching result in different
Wregex conﬁgurations. Here, we have tested several conﬁgur-
ations of Wregex (\Nregex A—E, summarized in Table 1), in
order to carry out a comparison with the previously available
NESsential and ELM tools, and in an attempt to obtain an op-
timal conﬁguration to be used as the ‘Recommended’ default in
the Wregex web interface.

The training regular expression is common to all conﬁgurations
tested here. We have chosen the low stringency regular expression
(. {2}) ( [LIVMFAWY] ) (. {2,3}) ( [LIVMFAWY] ) ( [AP]
{2, 3}) ([LIVMFAWY]) (["P]) ([LIVMFAWY]) (. {4}) for
training, in order to maximize the number of training sequences
used in the PSSM. As indicated in Table l and further detailed
below, the differences between the various Wregex conﬁgurations
lie in the training dataset used for computing the PSSM or in the
searching regular expression applied.

3.1 Comparison Wregex A versus NESsential

NESsential (Fu et al., 2011) is the most recently developed NES
prediction tool, and it was not tested in our previous comparison
of NES predictors (Garcia-Santisteban et al., 2012). Thus, we
decided to carry out a comparison between Wregex and

Predicted Score

Fig. 5. Comparison Wregex A versus NESsential. Graphs show the score assigned by Wregex A (a) or NESsential (b) to each predicted NES motif
versus the activity score experimentally assigned to each motif using a nuclear export assay. For displaying purposes, the 0—1 score range provided by
NESsential has been scaled to 0—100. Green circles to the right and the left of the threshold indicate true positives and true negatives, respectively. Red
circles to the right and the left of the threshold indicate false positives and false negatives, respectively. Black circles represent NT candidates

NESsential. In order for the comparison to be fair, we trained
this Wregex conﬁguration (\Nregex A) using the same set of 154
experimentally validated NESs used for NESsential training
(Horton P. and Fu S.-C., personal communication). The PSSM
used for training Wregex A is provided as Supplementary Table
S1. The searching regular expression applied by Wregex A is the
following pattern derived from the ‘TRG_NES_CRM1_1’ ELM
entry: ([DEQ].{0,1}) ([LIMl) (.{2,3}) ([LIVMFI) ([“Pl
{2,3}) ([LMVFI) ([“P]) ([LMIVI) (.{0,3} [DEQ] ).

Wregex A and NESsential were executed against a target set of
proteins consisting of 85 deubiquitinases (DUBs) for which ex-
perimental information on the presence of functional NES motifs
is available. Using a nuclear export assay, 32 active NES motifs
and 78 inactive NES-like motifs have been previously
identiﬁed in this set of proteins (Garcia-Santisteban et al.,
2012). Furthermore, active NES motifs were ascribed an activity
score, ranging from 1+ to 9+.

Figure 5a and b shows the results of the analysis using Wregex
and NESsential, respectively. Both tools provide a prediction
score for each candidate, which was plotted against the activity
score derived from the export assay. A number of candidate NES
not assayed in Garcia-Santisteban et a]. (2012) were predicted by
Wregex and NESsential. These new candidates that have not
been experimentally tested are indicated as NT (not tested).

As shown in Figure 5, Wregex A predicted fewer candidate
motifs than NESsential (64 versus 826). In order to select a

manageable number of candidate motifs to be experimentally
tested, a threshold can be arbitrarily deﬁned. As an example, a
threshold value of 50 is displayed in Figure 5. Using this thresh-
old, 42 candidates would be selected using Wregex A and 24
using NESsential. Wregex A candidates would include at least
15 true positive and 15 false positive NES motifs, whereas
NESsential candidates would include at least seven true positive
and ﬁve false positive motifs (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, we
have also estimated the number of true positives reported by
each program at a threshold value (34 for Wregex A and 14
for NESsential) that leads to the identiﬁcation of an equal
number of true positive motifs (21, the maximum number of
true positives reported by Wregex A). Using these thresholds,
NESsential reports a higher number of false positives than

Wregex A (29 versus 22) and, importantly, a much higher
number of candidates that would be selected for experimental
testing (214 versus 62). From this comparison, we conclude that
Wregex offers a good compromise of true positives with a smal-
ler number of candidates in relation to NESsential.

Another important difference is the computational resources
required by these tools. NESsential took several hours to process
the proteins used in Figure 5, while Wregex ﬁnished in a few
seconds. This faster execution time would be important for large-
scale (e.g. proteome wide) analyses.

3.2 Comparison Wregex B versus ELM

The best results in our previously reported comparison of NES
predictors were provided by ELM (Garcia-Santisteban et al.,
2012). Wregex can be regarded as an evolution of ELM, the
main difference being the training of Wregex with a PSSM,
which could help reﬁning the regular expression-based search.
In order to compare its performance with that of ELM, we
used a second Wregex conﬁguration (Wregex B) that uses the
ELM-derived expression described above, and is trained with a
PSSM (Supplementary Table S2) computed using the experimen-
tally validated NES motifs from the ValidNESs database (Fu
et al., 2013) and our previous DUB study (Garcia-Santisteban
et al., 2012). We used ELM and Wregex B to predict candidate
NES motifs in a set of 21 arbitrarily selected proteins
(ASPs) mostly related to chromatin modiﬁcation processes
(Supplementary Table S6). Both tools use essentially the same
regular expression, but Wregex allows further selection of

Table 3. Result summary for Wregex B and ELM predictions

 

Software Wregex B (Threshold 2 50) ELM (CRM1_1)

 

 

candidates by applying the PSSM and the score ﬁlter. Thus,
ELM predicted 21 candidates, and Wregex, at a score threshold
of 50, predicted 16 candidates. These candidate NES motifs were
subsequently tested using a nuclear export assay (two motifs
could not be analyzed due to cloning problems), and the results
are summarized in Table 3 and shown in detail in Supplementary
Table S7. These results indicate that Wregex B, at a threshold
value of 50, identiﬁes the same number of true positive NES
motifs as ELM (7), while decreasing the number of false positives
from 12 to 8, suggesting that the Wregex approach is a valid
strategy for NES prediction.

NES prediction with Wregex can potentially be further im-
proved by computing the PSSM with a larger number of experi-
mentally validated sequences, or by adjusting the stringency of
the searching regular expression. In this regard, we found that
using a more permissive regular expression led to the prediction
of three true positive NES motifs (WRE16, WRE19, WRE26 in
Supplementary Table S7) that were subsequently experimentally
validated in the export assay. Based on this observation, we pro-
pose a new searching regular expression ([DEQS] .{0, 1})
( [LIMA] ) (.{2,3}) ( [LIVMFH ([AP] {2,3}) ( [LMVFH
([AP]) ([LMIV]) ( . {0, 3} [DEC] ), Which allows serine
before (1)1 and alanine in (131. This new regular expression is
termed WRE, and has been used in the rest of Wregex conﬁg-
urations tested in this report (\Nregex C—E).

3.3 PSSM computation using export assay activity
score: Wregex C versus Wregex D

In order to gauge the effect of including the activity score for
PSSM computation two new Wregex conﬁgurations (Wregex C
and Wregex D) were evaluated (Table 1). Both conﬁgurations
were trained with the same set of active NES motifs that
have been validated using the export assay and therefore, have
been assigned an activity score. The activity score of each
motif was taken into account to compute the PSSM in

(22 versus 30). Thus, computation of the PSSM using the activity
score leads to a more restrictive prediction, but does not appear
to increase the proportion of true positive candidates. Therefore,
we favor the option of computing the PSSM without taking into
account the export assay activity scores. This would allow includ-
ing a larger number of experimentally validated NES motifs
(i.e. those not having an activity score) for PSSM computation.

3.4 Recommended conﬁguration for searching NES
motifs: Wregex E

Based on the results of the comparisons described above, we
recommend a Wregex conﬁguration for NES motif searching
(Wregex E) that uses the WRE regular expression and a PSSM
(Supplementary Table S5) computed using the experimentally
validated NES motifs reported in ValidNESs (Fu et al., 2013),
in the DUB NES survey of Garcia-Santisteban et a]. (2012) and
in this report. This conﬁguration is implemented in the Wregex
application webpage as ‘Recommended’, and an example of the
results obtained is shown in Figure 7 and Table 4.

4 CONCLUSION

We have developed and tested a novel approach for motif search-
ing consisting on the combination of both a regular expression
and a PSSM. This approach, termed ‘Wregex’, can be regarded
as an evolution of the Eukaryote Linear Motif (ELM) resource
(Gould et al., 2010). Importantly, the introduction of a PSSM
provides a score that may help prioritizing candidates for experi-
mental testing.

Our initial motivation to develop Wregex was the prediction of
NES motifs. In this regard, Wregex compares well with the most
recently developed NES predictor, NESsential (Fu et al., 2011),
being faster, and offering a better compromise between the
number of potential candidates to test and the number of true
positives.

Although we have focused here on NES motif searching,
Wregex is a generic tool that can be used for searching other
functional protein motifs. Thanks to the novel use of groups
in the regular expression, the PSSM can be computed based on
patterns rather than on strict positions. As a consequence, there
is no need to make use of the artiﬁcial concept of alignment gaps,
which has no utility when considering the physical conformation
of the protein motif. Wregex also offers the possibility of con-
sidering input motif weight when building the PSSM. This is
useful when the motif has a quantiﬁable activity rather than a
yes/no effect. If this is the case, scores derived from an activity

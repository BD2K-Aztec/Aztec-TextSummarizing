ABSTRACT

Motivation: The rapid accumulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) and
experimental evidence for miRNA interactions has ushered in a new
area of miRNA research that focuses on network more than individual
miRNA interaction, which provides a systematic view of the whole
microRNome. So it is a challenge to infer miRNA functional inter-
actions on a system-wide level and further draw a miRNA functional
network (miRFN). A few studies have focused on the well-studied
human species; however, these methods can neither be extended
to other non-model organisms nor take fully into account the informa-
tion embedded in miRNA—target and target—target interactions.
Thus, it is important to develop appropriate methods for inferring the
miRNA network of non-model species, such as soybean (Glycine
max), without such extensive miRNA-phenotype associated data as
miRNA-disease associations in human.

Results: Here we propose a new method to measure the functional
similarity of miRNAs considering both the site accessibility and the
interactive context of target genes in functional gene networks. We
further construct the miRFNs of soybean, which is the first study on
soybean miRNAs on the network level and the core methods can be
easily extended to other species. We found that miRFNs of soybean
exhibit a scale-free, small world and modular architecture, with their
degrees fit best to power-law and exponential distribution. We also
showed that miRNA with high degree tends to interact with those of
low degree, which reveals the disassortativity and modularity of
miRFNs. Our efforts in this study will be useful to further reveal the
soybean miRNA—miRNA and miRNA—gene interactive mechanism on
a systematic level.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), ~22 nt in length, are endogenous small
non-coding RNAs that repress gene expression by binding 3’-
untranslated regions (3’-UTRs) of their target messenger

RNAs (mRNAs), leading to direct destructive cleavage or trans-
lational repression. In plant, mature miRNAs are generated from
stem-loop regions of longer RNA precursors mainly by an
endoribonuclease III-like enzyme, dicer like-l (DCLl). The pro-
cessed and methylated miRNA/miRNA* duplex is then exported
to the cytosol. MiRNAs that are incorporated into an argonaute
protein containing RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) can
affect the target gene expression (Jones-Rhoades et al., 2006;
Voinnet, 2009). Different from of animals, most plant miRNAs
have highly complementary recognition sites on their targets; it is
considered to be a prominent feature of cleavage-guided repres-
sion. MiRNAs, one of the most important components of the
cell, play critical roles in many important biological processes,
such as development, nutrient homeostasis, abiotic stress
responses and pathogen responses in plant. So far, miRBase
(Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2006) (Release 19: August 2012) contains
21264 entries representing hairpin precursor miRNAs, express-
ing 25141 mature miRNA products, in 193 species. It is pre-
dicted that in eukaryotes, miRNA genes accounted for ~1%
of the total genes and their target genes may reach 10—30%.
The limited miRNAs are claimed to be able to control the
larger set of genes or processes through interaction, in which
multiple miRNAs work interactively to control individual
genes. To date, several elegant experiments have been carried
out, unraveling intriguing miRNA interactions. For example,
lin-4 and let-7, the first two experimentally veriﬁed miRNAs,
are cooperative in Drosophila (Enright, et al., 2004). Krek
et al. (2005) pointed out that there are interactive relations be-
tween miRNAs when they proposed the algorithm of PicTar and
further experimentally validated that miR-375, miR-l24 and let-
7b coordinately regulate M tpn. Additionally, numerous miRNAs
were identified to be involved in the aging signaling pathway,
such as miR—l, miR—2l, miR-24, miR—34, miR-100, miR-106,
miR-l32, miR-l45, miR-l46, miR-l99, miR-206, miR-2l7,
miR-320 and miR-449 [reviewed by Chen et a]. (2010)]. The
same interactions also exist in plant; for example, miRl60 and
miRl67 are involved in Arabidopsis adventitious rooting pro-
gram. All these experimental results bring to a new area of
miRNA research that focuses on network rather than individual
miRNA interaction. With the availability of large data derived
from fine-scale experiments and computer algorithms, several
results have been achieved. Shalgi et al. (2007) first built an
miRNA network by analyzing the target genes predicted
by PicTar and TargetScan. Integrated analysis of miRNA
expression profiling data showed that the higher correlation
coefﬁcient of miRNA co-expressions, the higher intensity in

their synergy; miRNAs with negative correlation between their
expressions tend to avoid the synergies. Recently, Xu et al. (2011)
constructed a human miRNA—miRNA functional synergistic
network Via co-regulating functional modules. They found
that, contrasting to non-disease miRNAs, disease miRNAs
have more synergism and are the global central cores of the
network, indicating their higher complexity of function.

The prerequisite of constructing an miRNA functional net-
work (miRFN) is to deﬁne the functions of the miRNAs.
However, the functions of the most recently identiﬁed
miRNAs are unknown due to the lack of experimental strategy
for systematic identiﬁcation of their regulating targets. To better
understand miRNAs, it is increasingly necessary to measure their
functional similarity (FS) and further construct a functional net-
work, thus in turn to infer novel potential functions for
miRNAs. For the FS of protein-coding genes, many successful
methods have been proposed either based on sequence or expres-
sion similarities (Horvath et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2007) or based
on Gene Ontology (GO) annotations (Lee et al., 2004; Lord
et al., 2003; Pesquita et al., 2008, 2009; Wang et al., 2007).
Nevertheless, we cannot indiscriminately imitate these successful
methods for inferring the FS of miRNAs. First, all miRNAs are
short in length and miRNA—mRNA duplex allows mismatch. So
miRNAs with similar sequence and pre—miRNAs with similar
structure may have distinctive functions. Second, although
expression similarity can interpret part of the FS of miRNA,
like protein-coding genes, the similar expression pattern does
not always signify FS. Third, it is impractical to measure
miRNAs FS directly based on their functions due to the absence
of functional databases such as GO annotations for coding genes
to annotate miRNAs.

Therefore, new methods were developed to measure miRNAs’
FS. Wang et al. (2010) used human miRNA-disease association
data to infer miRNAs’ FS by measuring the similarity of their
associated diseases structured as directed acyclic graphs, which is
similar to infer the similarity of protein-coding genes by measur-
ing the semantic similarity of their annotating GO directed acyc-
lic graphs (\Nang et al., 2007). However, few species has datasets
about the relationships between miRNAs and speciﬁc pheno-
types, such as miRNA-diseases associations in human. More
generally and directly, miRNAs’ function as repressive regulator
on their target transcripts. The ﬁnal functionality of miRNAs
that is embedded in the miRNA—target interactions mainly
depends on the functions of the downstream target genes.
Thus, the target genes should play the major roles in full eluci-
dation of the biological meanings as well as the FSs of the
miRNAs. Based on target genes, all existing approaches for
miRNA’s FS calculation can be summarized as shown in
Figure 1A. The simplest method reported by Shalgi et a].
(2007) deﬁned the FS as the proportion of the common target
genes, which is represented as a Jaccard similarity between two
target gene sets regulated by two miRNAs (Fig. 1A (a)). Yu et al.
(2010) presented a second method for systematic study of FSs
among human miRNAs by using their target genes’ FSs pre-
sented as GO semantic similarities [Fig. 1A (b)]. Xu et a].
(2011) used the third method shown as in Figure 1A (0). For
each pairwise miRNAs, they test the signiﬁcance of their
co-regulated genes sharing the same GO category (called as
co-regulating functional modules) using hypergeometric test.

Fig. 1. (A) Three approaches for measuring FS of miRNAs. (a) FS was
directly calculated as the proportion of the common target genes between
two miRNAs, which is represented as a Jaccard similarity between two
target gene sets. (b) FS was calculated by computing the semantic simi-
larity between their target gene sets based on GO. (c) FS was represented
as the signiﬁcance of their co-regulated genes sharing the same GO cat-
egory, which is identiﬁed by hypergeometric test. (B) Illustration of
accessibility, represented as for mRNA—target interaction. The left part
shows the unbound RISC and its partial-paired target UTR; the right
shows the RISC-target interactions. AAG is computed as the free energy
gained by transitioning from the state in which miRNA and target are
unbound (left) to the state in which the miRNA binds its target (right).
The region of the target site that needs to be unpaired for a miRNA—
target interaction includes the miRNA bound region and likely additional
ﬂanks. This ﬁgure was completely cited from Kertesz et a]. (2007)

However, all aforementioned methods ignored two critical as-
pects of information embedded in the miRNA-target regulatory
process, which would greatly improve their performances. One is
the site accessibility between miRNA and its target mRNA. The
other is the interactive context between target genes.

Target accessibility, ﬁrst proposed by Kertesz et al. (2007), has
been identiﬁed as one of important factors that are involved in
target recognition because the secondary structure (stem etc.)
around target site will prevent miRNA and target mRNA
from contacting. As shown in Figure 1B, the target accessibility
is represented by AAG, the energy computed as the free energy
gained by transitioning from the state in which miRNA and its
target are unbound (left) to the state in which the miRNA binds
its target (right). The less energy means the more possibility that
miRNA is able to contact (and cleave) target mRNA (i.e. high
accessibility). From this point of View, an miRNA pair that has
less AAG with their common target mRNAs should be more
similar in functionality (more detailed illustrations are provided
in Supplementary Materials S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1).
Thus, we should take into account target accessibility when
measuring the FS between miRNAs to improve the sensitivity
of functional comparison.

Interactive contexts between miRNAs’ target genes have
also attracted the attentions of several researchers. Satoh et al.
(2011) suggested that a set of miRNA targets regulated by a
single miRNA generally constitute the biological network of

functionally associated molecules in human cells. Hsu et al.
(2008) have performed topological analysis to elucidate the
global correlation between miRNA regulation and protein—
protein interaction network in humans. They showed that
target genes of individual miRNA tend to be hubs and bottle-
necks in the network. Although proteins directly regulated by
miRNA might not form a network module themselves, the
miRNA targets and their interacting neighbors jointly showed
signiﬁcantly higher modularity. These studies indicate that target
genes constitute not just a simple gene set, but also a subnetwork
of a larger scale functional gene network they involved in. The
interactive contexts in such target gene network should also be
used for inferring the FS of miRNAs.

We propose a novel approach to measuring the FS of
miRNAs, considering both their target site accessibility and the
topology of target functional gene networks (FGN), and further
construct four soybean (Glycine max) miRFNs. We by topology
analysis indicated that miRFNs of soybean exhibit a scale-free,
small world and modular architecture; with their degrees ﬁt best
to power-law and exponential distribution. Degree correlation
showed that miRNAs of high degrees in miRFNs tend to interact
with miRNAs of low degrees, revealing the disassortativity and
modularity of miRFNs. More researches on soybean genome
and microRNome based on miRFNs and FGNs are underway.

2 METHODS
2.1 Data source

2.1.] M iRNAS 0f soybean Soybean miRNA sequences were down-
loaded from miRBase (Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2006) (Release 19, August
2012). It contains 555 mature miRNAs generated from 506 hairpin
precursors, wherein 367 miRNAs belong to 81 miRNA families.
All miRNAs are denoted by their mature miRNA names, such as
‘gma-miR159a-5p’.

2.1.2 3’-UTRS mRNAs’ 3’ -UTRs were downloaded from Soybase
(http://www.soybase.org/dlpages/ﬂank/utrindex.php). It contains 14136
3’ -UTRs transcripted from 12082 distinct gene ensembls of Wm82
(annotation version: Glyma 1.1).

2.1.3 Target gene netWOrkS MiRNAs’ target gene networks were
extracted from three soybean FGNs (SoyFGNs), which were constructed
based on GO annotation of three orthogonal aspects: biological process
(BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function (MF). The work
about SoyFGNs will be published in another article synchronously.
Finally, we use gene ensembl IDs, such as G1yma10g28890, to represent
corresponding genes.

2.2 MiRNA target prediction

Owing to the lack of experimentally validated targets of soybean
miRNAs, in Silica methods for miRNA target prediction are used in
this study. To reduce the biases introduced by individual predicting
method, we incorporate all miRNA—target interactions that occur in
three accepted predicting methods using their default settings, respect-
ively. The three methods are PITA (http://genie.weizmann.ac.il/pubs/
mir07/mir07_prediction.html), psRNATarget (http://plantgrn.noble.
org/psRNATarget/) and TAPIR (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/
webtools/tapir/; using precise search). The AAGS of all miRNA-target
duplexes predicted by PITA are given by PITA itself, whereas the AAGS
of those predicted by psRNATarget and TAPIR are calculated using
Vienna RNA Package (Muckstein et al., 2006). Because the highly

complementary sequence feature of miRNA-target duplexes in plants,
to reduce the false positive, we set a relatively strict criteria of >7 bases
in seed length, no G:U wobble or loops, no mismatch and
AAG5—10 Kcal/mol to obtain a target set of high conﬁdence.

2.3 Methods for measuring miRNA FS

As demonstrated in Section 1, miRNAs perform their functions by down-
regulating their target genes, and the intensity of which is closely asso-
ciated with the accessibility of binding the target site. Thus, a more
accurate measurement should take fully into account both the FS
between their targets and the regulatory strengths they exert on their
targets. In this study, we propose an approach to measure the regulatory
strength based on target site accessibility and an approach to compute the
FS between the target genes of two miRNAs based on FGNs and further
to infer the FS of these two miRNAs by integrating these two critical
factors. Figure 2 shows the complete workﬂow of the approaches. Given
two miRNAs, miR, and miRj, we ﬁrstly predict their target gene sets,
Tar_gene, = {g1,g2, ...,gm} and Tar_genej = {g1,g2, ...,gn}, respect-
ively (Fig. 2(a)). After that, the union of their target gene sets,
T ar_gene,j = T ar_gene, U T ar_genej = {g1, g2, ..., gN} was subjected to
two subsequent steps. One is to extract the network topology from the
FGNs for further measuring the FS between these two target gene sets
(Fig. 2 (c), (d), (e), (f), (g); inside light gray shade); the other is to calculate
the regulatory strength for further getting the co-regulation coefﬁcient
(Fig. 2(h), (k); inside dark gray shade). Finally, these two values were
integrated into the ﬁnal FS of the given two miRNAs (Fig. 2(1)). The next
three subsections will give the details of these three steps.

2.3.1 Regulatory strength ofmiRNA Kertesz et al. (2007) had indi-
cated that target accessibility was a critical factor in miRNA function,
which was presented as the free energy (AAG) gained from the formation
of the miRNA-target duplex and the energetic cost of unpairing the target
to make it accessible to the miRNA. They experimentally showed that
diminishment of target accessibility substantially reduced the miRNA-
mediated translational repression. Based on such accessibility, we deﬁne
the regulatory strength (denoted by R) to quantify the effect of transla-
tional repression. First, we calculate the AAG of each miRNA-target
duplex in the targets prediction. Because an miRNA may be predicted to
bind more than one site on the same gene transcript, then we use
Equation (1) to integrate these multiple AAGS (AAGI, - - - , AAGi, - - - ,
AAGn) into a unique one for each miRNA-target duplex.

AAG = log: eAAGi (1)
i=1

Second, we assign a regulatory strength value (R) for a given miRNA—
target interaction (miR, — gk) as deﬁned in Equation (2), for the reason
that all AAGS are less than zero and the smaller its value the greater the
regulatory strength will be.

(AAGmaX — AAG)

R, = —
’gk (AAGmaX — AAGmin)

(2)
where AAG is the integrated unique accessibility of miR, — gk interaction,
AAGmax and AAGmm are the maximum and minimum integrated unique
AAG of all miRNA—target interactions.

Given two miRNAs, MR, and miRj, we can get the regulatory
strengths that they exerted on each gene of their union target set,
T ar_gene,j = T ar_gene, U T ar_genej = {g1, g2, ..., gN}, respectively, as
deﬁned in Equation (2). If there is no predicted interaction for
miR, — gk, we deﬁne R,,gk = 0. Putting these two sets of regulatory
strengths in an identical ﬁxed order, we form two vectors, I7,- and

vectors as deﬁned in Equation (3) (Fig. 2 (k)). wij ranges between 0 and

2.3.2 FS between target gene sets MiRNAs implement their func-
tions through regulating their target genes. Thus the FS between
miRNAs should be obviously represented by the FS between their targets
to a large extend, though it also suffers ﬁne-tuning of regulatory strength.
Therefore, to fully reveal the FS between targets is the key for measuring
the FS between miRNAs. Previous studies have shown that miRNA-
regulated genes function in a modular and hierarchical fashion and the
closer the two genes in a network, the more similar their functions
are likely to be. In this study, we propose a network-based method to
calculate the FS between two target gene sets.

Given a miRNA pair, miRi—miRj, the union set of their target genes
was subjected to the network-extraction from three global FGNs
(SoyFGNs), which have been constructed by us previously (Fig. 2 (c)).

Such a FGN is a weighted undirected graph in which each edge is
weighted by the FS of its two end-node genes. Given two target genes,
g, and g, we ﬁrstly ﬁnd out the shortest path(s) between them based on
the topology of the FGNs (Fig. 2 (d)). Then we deﬁne the FS of these two
genes as (Fig. 2 (e, f)):

F,~ = max H

eeshortestpath(g,-, gj)

weight(e) , (4)

where shortestpath(g,, gj) contains all the edges on a shortest path between
g, and g in FGN; weight(e) denotes the FS of two genes linked by the edge
e. The function max(x) means that Fij- is the product of all weights on the
shortest path, which can produce the maximum one, if there are more than
one shortest path between g, and g. Note that not all target genes are
included in SoyFGNs. These absent genes are regarded as orphan nodes
in SoyFGNs and have zero similarity with other genes when being used in
Equation (4). Finally, we combine all these pairwise similarities into a
unique one by Equation (5) (Fig. 2 (g)), which is same with the best-
match average approach used for integrating pairwise GO semantic simi-
larity into pairwise FS of genes (Xu, et al., 2013).

where, FSTaLgeneij ranges between 0 and 1; m, n are the number of target
genes of miR, and miRj.

2.3.3 F S between miRNAs Then, we have obtained two quantitative
indicators, the co-regulation coefﬁcient (wij) between two miRNAs and

the FS (FSTaLgeneij) between their target gene sets. Based on the afore-
mentioned point of View, the ﬁnal similarity between miRNAs on func-
tionality should be the FS of their target gene sets ﬁne-tuned by their
co-regulation coefﬁcient. Thus we give the ﬁnal calculating formula based
on these two indicators as follows:

FSm,R(miR,-, may) 2 Fsg‘wi)  (6)

ar_geney

where FSmiR (miR,,miRJ-) also ranges between 0 and 1.

Because we have constructed three SoyFGNs based on three GO
aspects (as hereinbefore abbreviated as BP, MF and CC), each miRNA
pair will get three FSs. We may also need a single integrated FS for each
miRNA pair. Here we calculate the weighted average of the three FSs
as their integration (hereinafter denoted by Integration), which can be
formulated as

Wl'Fpr+W2'FSmf+W3'FScc
W1+W2+W3

where, Fpr, FSmf and FSCC are three FSs for each miRNA pair; wl, W2
and W3 are the corresponding weights. Though the absence of a criterion
to quantify the weights of the different aspects of G0 on miRNAs”
function, we think that the aspect giving a larger similarity should have
a greater weight. Thus we let the weight be equal to the corresponding FS.
The ﬁnal formula for integration is

1'7pr - 1'7pr + FSmf - FSmf-i- FSCC - FSCC
Fpr + FSmf+FScc

 

FSWAVg = (7)

 

FSWAVg = (8)

where, FSWAVg also ranges between 0 and 1.

2.4 Construction of miRFN

An miRFN here is a weighted undirected graph, in which miRNAs rep-
resent the nodes and their functional interactions represent the edges,
which are weighted by the pairwise FSs of miRNAs they linked. As
described earlier in the text, our method can give a more reliable
miRNA FS, a critical problem of miRFN construction; in doing so,
we can calculate any pairwise FSs for a list of interesting miRNAs and
further construct the functional network. However, there is still a serious
problem needed to be addressed that two miRNAs of how similar in
function can be connected in the network. We should set an appropriate
threshold to ensure that miRNA pairs with FSs greater than or equal
to the threshold will be connected by edges; otherwise, they are not
connected directly.

In this study, we adopt the clustering—coefﬁcient-based threshold
selection. The clustering coefﬁcient (Ci) of a node (i) in a network is
deﬁned as C,- = 2n,-/k,-(k,- — 1), where n,- represents the number of edges
between k,(> 1) ﬁrst neighbors of the miRNA i; if k,- = 1, we deﬁne
C, = 0. While the clustering coefﬁcient of a network is deﬁned as the
average clustering coefﬁcient of all of its nodes,

1N
C=—§:C,-, 9
NM ()

where N is the number of nodes in the network. If N = 0, we deﬁne C = 0.

The construction of a miRNA network can be Viewed as a process that
links are removed from the original complete graph by gradually increas-
ing the FS threshold. We set a series of incremental thresholds r from
0 to 1 with an increment of 0.01. For each threshold 1, we construct
a network comprises the miRNA pairs with FSs greater than or equal
to r. In system biology, a genuine biological network should be scale-
free and highly modular; its clustering coefﬁcient, denoted by C(I), should
be signiﬁcantly higher than that of the corresponding random network,
denoted by c,(r). Here, we denote the difference between C(1) and c,(r) by
Ac(r), i.e. Ac(r) = c(r)—c,(r). We conjecture that the most appropriate
threshold should be the maximum 1, which can produce a monotonically
increasing Ac(r) when removing the links gradually as the threshold

increasing from 0 to t. More speciﬁcally, we formulate this as a discrete
optimization problem, where the critical cutoff threshold was determined
by ﬁnding the ﬁrst I, which lets Ac(r + 0.01)—Ac(r)<0 over a set of r
gradually increasing from 0 to 1, i.e. r = arg maxofrfl (Ac(r)). Note that
calculating c,(r) of the random networks was non-trivial Via Equation (9)
because it is not clear which and how many random network models
should be used for this purpose. Hence we adopt a statistical method
proposed by Elo et al. (2007) for its solution. If we denote by N the total
number of nodes and by k, the degree of a node i for the generated
network using threshold 1, then c,(r) was the expected value of the
clustering coefﬁcient, which can be calculated as:

(152 — 02
I€3N
where I; = 1/NZjvk, and I? =1/NZjvk12.

Finally an miRFN can be constructed and represented as
G(V, E, W, T), where V: {mileiRz - - - ,miRN} represents the
miRNAs involved in the network, E: {eij =< miR,,miRj > |
FSm,R(miR,-,miRJ-) Z T} represents the edges between miRNA pairs
with FSs greater than or equal to the threshold T and
W: FSm,R(miR,-,miRJ-) represents the weights of the edges that are the
FSs between each two connected miRNAs.

2.5 Topological characterization of miRFN

One way to characterize biological networks is to study their topological
properties. We by using Cytoscape 2.8.2 (Smoot et al., 2011) investigate
the global properties of the four miRNA networks ﬁrstly. In addition,
we conduct an in—depth analysis of the degree distribution and degree
correlation in next two subsections. In absence of special description,
degree refers to the nodal degree.

2.5.] Degree distribution Many previous studies have observed that
biological networks are generally scale-free and their degree distributions
follow the power law (Arita, 2005; Khanin and Wit, 2006). Some studies
have also argued that there are other distributions, such as the lognormal
distribution, which explains the degree distribution better than power
law does (Przulj et al., 2004; Stumpf and Ingram, 2007). Here we use
four models to investigate the distributions of the four resulting func-
tional miRNA networks. These models are Lognormal, Power law,
Exponential and Poisson. All model ﬁttings and Visualizations are
completed by using Origin 9 (http://www.originlab.com).

2.5.2 Degree correlation Degree correlation is a basic structural
metric that calculates the likelihood that nodes link to nodes of similar
or dissimilar degree. The former case is called positive degree correlation,
whereas the latter is called negative degree correlation. In the social
sciences, a network with positive degree correlation is called assortative,
whereas one with negative degree correlation is called disassortative
(Newman, 2002). Three ways of characterizing the amount of degree
correlation are used, each containing less detail and expressing the result
in more compact terms. They are the Joint Degree Distribution (J DD), the
k-nearest neighbors (knn) and the Pearson Degree Correlation (PDC).

The JDD is deﬁned as the distribution in which each entry Di]- is the
number of edges that the nodes at its endpoints have degrees 1' and j,
respectively. It is actually a 2D distribution of the number of edges with
respect to the degree of their connected nodes.

Instead of recording every pair of nodes, as JDD does, knn simply
averages the degrees of the neighbors of each node of a given degree
and plots the results as linear, semi-log and log-log plots. If a degree is
missing, it is skipped in the graph. If knn rises as nodal degree rises, this
indicates that nodes of similar degree tend to be linked, whereas if knn
falls as degree rises, this indicates the opposite.

The PDC is the most condensed way to characterize the degree-link
structure of a network. It consists of the conventional Pearson correlation

calculation applied to each pair of linked nodes. The result always lies in
the range [—1, 1] with a negative result indicating that nodes of dissimilar
degree tend to be linked and a positive result indicating that nodes of
similar degree tend to be linked.

In this section, we will analyze the JDD, knn and PDC for miRNA
networks to investigate their assortativity.

3 RESULTS

3.1 MiRNA target prediction

We used three methods (PITA, psRNATarget and TAPIR) to
predict soybean miRNA targets followed by a strict criterion to
control the false discovery rate. As a result, 554 of 555 soybean
miRNAs (except for gma-miR1530) target 34718 sites of 8731
transcripts (mRNAs) derived from 7598 distinct soybean
genes. A brief statistic is shown in Figure 3A and the detailed
information of predicted targets is provided in Supplementary
File Sl (XLS).

3.2 FS of miRNAs

We applied our method to calculate the pairwise FS of 554
miRNAs based on three target FGNs and the accessibility
of each miRNA-target duplex. As results, 153182(99.64%),
150 980(98.20%), 152 630(99.28%) and 153 730(99.99%)
miRNA pairs of 153 735(554 X 555/2) gained non-zero similari-
ties in BP, MF, CC and Integration, respectively. The zero simi-
larities appear to be the case of zero similarities between their
target genes due to the absence of these targets in SoyFGNs. The
pairwise FSs and their dendrogram of Integration, as an ex-
ample, were shown as a heat map in Figure 3B. The full size
of all heat maps in BP, MF, CC and Integration were provided
as Supplementary File S2 (PDF).

3.3 MiRNAs in the same family or cluster show high FS

A family of miRNAs includes similar mature miRNAs and
complete identical seed regions, which are widely used as the
key regions for miRNA target recognition (Bartel, 2009).
Therefore, miRNAs of the same family tend to show high FS.
A cluster of miRNAs incorporates those are located closely in
genome and thus are usually transcribed and expressed syn-
chronously and functions coordinately. Therefore, miRNAs in
the same cluster are expected to have higher FS. To evaluate the
reliability of the FSs computed by our method, we compared the
FS of miRNAs in the same family and the same cluster with that
of the random-selected miRNAs, which are neither from the
same family nor the same cluster. We ﬁrstly downloaded soybean
miRNA family data and the genome coordinate data from
miRBase and then identiﬁed miRNA clusters by setting the
distance between consecutive miRNAs <50 kb on the genome
coordinate, as previously suggested by BaskerVille and Bartel
(2005). We next calculated the FS of miRNAs in the same
family and miRNAs in the same cluster, and then compared
these with that of random-selected miRNAs. As a result, the
average FSs of miRNAs in 81 families (denoted by ‘miR-
Family’), miRNAs in 59 clusters (denoted by ‘Cluster’) and 81
random-selected miRNAs (denoted by ‘Random’) are shown as
Figure 3C. The analysis of variance indicates that the FSs of
miRNAs in the same family and miRNAs in the same cluster

are both signiﬁcantly greater than that of random-selected
miRNAs are in BP, MF, CC and Integration, respectively
(Fig. 3C). This result suggests that our method can reﬂect the
FS of miRNAs correctly and is consistent with expectations.
Additionally, miRNAs in a cluster are also signiﬁcantly more
similar in function than miRNAs in the same family, which is
contrary with the conclusions in the study of human miRNA
similarity by Wang, et al. (2010). This contradiction infers that
the clustered distribution of miRNAs in the genome may have
different importance between animals and plants. To conﬁrm
that using target network can improve the accuracy of comput-
ing miRNA FS directly using GO similarity, an additional com-
parison was carried out between the FSs based on these two
kinds of information in Supplementary Materials SM2 and
Figure S2. The results indicated that, target genes’ interactive
context enhanced the ability of our method on reﬂecting the
fact that miRNAs in the same family or in the same cluster are
more similar in function than those that are randomly selected.

3.4 Construction of miRFN

By setting a series of incremental thresholds ‘L’ (from 0 to l) with
an increment of 0.01, we used each threshold to ﬁlter the original
complete networks (including all pairwise similarity of 554
miRNAs) in BP, MF, CC and Integration, respectively. As a
result, we obtained 99, 98, 67 and 98 networks in BP, MF, CC
and Integration, respectively. Using our own JAVA script, we
calculated the cluster coefﬁcient of each network [c(t)] and that
of its random model [Cr(‘E)]. As shown in Figure 4A, the ﬁrst stop
of monotonically increasing of the Ac(t) occurs at ‘L’ 20.53, 0.68,
0.13 and 0.85 in BP, MF, CC and Integration, respectively,
which indicates that these thresholds are the most appropriate
ones to construct the miRFNs in BP, MF, CC and Integration,
respectively.

Using above thresholds, we constructed four miRFNs in BP,
MF, CC and Integration, respectively. A graphic View of the
network in Integration is shown as Figure 4B. The full size of
the graphic Views of these four networks was provided in
Supplementary File S3 (PDF).

3.5 Topology of soybean miRFN

Analyzed by Cytoscape 2.8.2, the global properties of the
miRFNs in BP, MF, CC and Integration are shown as
Table 1. These four networks cover 462 (83.2%), 454 (81.8%),
512 (92.3%) and 474 (85.4%) miRNAs of soybean, respectively.
All networks manifest the typical common characteristics of
biological networks: high clustering coefﬁcient, low diameter
and density and high centralization (shown in Table l).

3.5 .1 Degree distribution Figure 5A shows the graphic Views of
the degree distribution and four ﬁtted models for each miRNA
network. The detailed parameters of these models and their per-
formances (represented by R-squares, R2) are listed in Table 2.
Our results demonstrate that the Power law and Exponential
models ﬁt best to the degree distribution on the whole, whereas
the Poisson ﬁts worst. These degree distributions indicate that
miRFNs have the typical characteristics of biological networks,
e.g. scale-free small world, rather than that of random network,
of which the degree distribution ﬁts Poisson best.

3.5.2 Degree correlation The JDD of miRNA networks in BP,
MF, CC and Integration are Visualized as 3D surface graph in
Figure 5B. The results suggest several important points. First, in
all miRFNs, most of degree pairs have small number of edges.

The average numbers of edges are 3.5428, 3.6300, 2.6260 and
3.5473 for network in BP, MF, CC and Integration, respectively,
which indicate the low network densities, as the same as shown in
Table 1. Second, the extremely sharp protrusions, especially in
MF, CC and Integration, show that little nodes share a large
number of edges, indicating the existence of local dense func-
tional modules in miRFN. Third, the majority of apparent
peaks (the number of edges :30) appear in the degree of low-
high and high-low node pairs, followed by the low-low node
pairs. This result suggests that the nodes of high degree tend
to connect to that of low degree in miRFNs, indicating their
disassortative feature.

Similar results were obtained in the analysis of the knn and the
PDC (Fig. 5C). The descending knn and negative PDC indicate
that nodes of dissimilar degree tend to be linked in all four
miRFNs.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we ﬁrst proposed a novel approach to measuring
the FS of miRNAs, both considering their site accessibility
and the topology of target gene functional network. Based on
pairwise FS, we further constructed four soybean (Gmax)
miRFNs Via a clustering—coefﬁcient-based threshold selection.
Our method in this article made up for the defects of existing
methods either that some of them failed to infer the miRNA
network of non-model species without such extensive miRNA-
phenotype associated data as miRNA-disease association in
human, or that some of them did not consider the target site
accessibility and the interactive context between target genes.
The successful application in soybean indicates that our methods
can be easily extended to other species. In next ﬁve subsections,
we will discuss the highlights of this article and the research
prospects.

4.1 Indispensable target site accessibility

Accessibility proposed by Kertesz et al. (2007) has been identiﬁed
as one of critical factors that are involved in target recognition.
In this study, we further demonstrated its important role for
inferring miRNA FS, and hence used it to infer the FS of
miRNAs based on such an argument that a miRNA pair has
higher accessibility with their common targets should be more
similar in function. Taking accessibility into account improved
the sensitivity of functionally comparing miRNAs based on their
targets. Especially for those miRNAs having the same targets
can also be distinguished regarding their functionality due to
the different accessibility. Kertesz et al. (2007) deﬁned the acces-
sibility as the free energy gained by transitioning from the state in
which miRNA and target are unbound to the state in which the
miRNA binds its target (Fig. 1B). After a series of reasonable
transformation, we converted the pairwise accessibility between
miRNAs and their targets to regulatory strengths, and further
to a ﬁne-tuning factor, referred to as co-regulation coefﬁcient.
Such deﬁned co-regulation coefﬁcient reveals the intensity that
two miRNAs co-regulate the same group of target genes, which
is conducive to reﬂect the similarity of miRNAs in functionality
more accurately and sensitively (Supplementary Materials S1
and Fig. S1).

4.2 Interactive context between target genes

The FS of miRNAs should be obviously represented by that of
their targets to a large extend, though it also suffers ﬁne-tuning
of regulation strength. As reviewed in the Section 1, a growing
number of studies have shown that miRNA-regulated genes are

not isolated with each other, but tend to constitute a FGN,
which provides an additional global View of the interactive con-
text of each gene. With the realization that interactions encode
functional dependencies, the notion of functional comparison
has been expanded to multi-activities performed by multiple
gene products in conjunction. Hence the opportunity of compu-
tational function comparison is the use of a gene’s interaction
context within the network to compare its function. In this study,
we propose a network-based method to calculate the FS between
two target gene sets, considering such interaction context. Then
the ﬁnal similarity of miRNAs is subsequently quantiﬁed as the
similarity of the target genes ﬁne-tuned by co-regulation coefﬁ-
cient. By comparing the similarity of miRNAs in the same family
and the same cluster to the similarity of random-selected
miRNAs, we conﬁrmed the accuracy of our method.

4.3 The first global view of soybean miRNA functional
interactions

Current achievements in miRNA research area are inspiring.
Molecular cloning and functional elucidation have greatly
advanced our understanding of this small RNA species. As
one of the ultimate goals, many efforts have devoted to draw a
global View of miRNA interactions. However, such efforts
mainly focused on model organisms, especially the human spe-
cies, while rarely focused on plant. Additionally, they are either
difﬁcult to be extended to non-model organisms or fail to take
fully into account the information embedded in miRNA—target
and target—target interactions. Our work introduced in this art-
icle is the ﬁrst study on soybean miRNAs on the network level.
We draw four miRFNs, containing 554 soybean miRNAs, based
on three types of their target networks. The topological analysis
shows that, similar to other biological networks, miRFN is a
scale-free network, and its degree distribution ﬁts best to
power-law and exponential distribution. Its degree correlation
indicates that the miRNAs of high degrees tend to interact

with those of low degrees, which is referred to as disassortativity.
The achievements here are the fundamentals for further studies
on interactome of soybean on genome and microRNome level.

4.4 Availability

Based on the work of this research, we have also developed a web
platform for information retrieval and analysis of soybean
miRNAs and their target gene network. The Web site can be
accessed at SoymiRNet: http://nclab.hit.edu.cn/SoymiRNet.

4.5 Prospects

Our functional networks provide a systematic View of the whole
microRNome (miRNome) of soybean, and hence such construc-
tion of the ﬁrst miRNome-wide maps has been followed by
attempts to discover and predict function within the system as a
whole. Therefore, the efforts of this article are just the beginning
of the soybean functional genome and microRNome research,
and part of a comprehensive study on the soybean functional
network. As shown in Figure 6, our whole research project con-
sists of three main focuses: (i) the construction of FGN of soybean
(shapes in blue background), the result of which is part of the
source data of this article and will be published in another article;
(ii) inferring miRNA functional network of soybean as described
in this article (shapes in yellow background); and (iii) module
detection, miRNA-gene two layer network analysis and further
interactive module analysis coupled with genomic context ana-
lysis to discover the gene-miRNA regulatory mechanism involved
in stress resistance, nitrogen ﬁxation, protein and lipid synthesis
and so forth in soybean (shape in red background). All in all,
based on the efforts in this article and previous work, we will
carry out more comprehensive studies on soybean functional
interactome on genome and microRNome level.

ABSTRACT

Summary: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been extensively studied owing
to their important regulatory roles in genic expression. An increasingly
number of reports are performing extensive data mining in small RNA
sequencing libraries to detect miRNAs isoforms and also 5’ and 3’
post-transcriptional nucleotide additions, as well as edited miRNAs
sequences. A ready to use pipeline, isomiRlD, was developed to
standardize and automatize the search for miRNAs isoforms in high-
throughput small RNA sequencing libraries.

Availability: isomiRlD is a command line Python script available at

1 INTRODUCTION

Several high-throughput small RNA (sRNA) sequencing projects
have increased the discovery and number of small non-coding
RNAs related to gene expression regulation. MicroRNAs
(miRNAs) are endogenous sRNAs with 19—24 nt in length
(Bartel, 2004). To regulate protein-coding genes, mature miRNA
binds in the mRNA target sites leading to their degradation or
repression of translation (Pasquinelli, 2012; Voinnet, 2009).
Recently, reports have demonstrated the existence of isomiRs
(Cloonan et al., 2011; Guo and Lu, 2010; Korbes et al., 2012).
The isomiR classiﬁcation relies in three major categories: 5’, 3’
and polymorphic isomiRs, with the sub classiﬁcation of 5’ and 3’
isomiRs into templated or non-templated modiﬁcations, accord-
ing to the miRNA precursor sequence (Neilsen et al., 2012).
Furthermore, efforts have been made to identify and understand
the biological processes where non-templated nucleotides are
added in the 3’ end of mature miRNAs, altering the miRNA
stability and efﬁciency (Burroughs et al., 2010; Ebhardt et al.,
2009; Lu et al., 2009; Wyman et al., 2011). Nucleotide additions
at the 5’ end have also been reported altering the miRNA seed
region and consequently its functionality (Bizuayehu et al., 2012;
Ebhardt et al., 2010). Several isomiR variants have been dis-
covered with deep sequencing technologies. Some of these vari-
ations may have biological origin and functions, once the
modiﬁcations were seen repeatedly at the same sites with
higher frequencies than random errors (Ebhardt et al., 2009).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

To improve and automate the search for isomiRs in sRNA
sequenced libraries, we developed a simpliﬁed workﬂow.
isomiRID allows the identiﬁcation of 5’, 3’ and polymorphic
isomiRs based on the canonical miRNA known sequence and
also from other regions on the same miRNA precursor.
Additionally, the program can also identify non-templated 5’
or 3’ end variations by mapping the sRNAs in the known pre-
miRNAs. This framework is a simple method to identify and
compare isomiRs abundance in different sequencing libraries,
providing an initial view for biological relevant isomiRs. We
also highlight that this pipeline could be applied to study
isomiRs from plants, animals or any other living organisms.

2 METHODS

The isomiRID workﬂow (Fig. 1) has four main steps:

The ﬁrst step generates the ﬁle of sRNAs with perfect matches on the
pre-miRNA (R0 =round 0) and create the dataset for the subsequent
analysis with the pre-miRNA unmapped reads. Optionally, it is possible
to use a reference genome (or transcriptome), to ﬁlter the unmapped
sRNAs from other genomic regions.

On the second step, sRNAs mapping is performed, allowing a single
mismatch in the sequence. This ﬁrst part generates the R1 ﬁle, containing
sequences with one mismatch in the 5’ end (5’MM), in the middle of
sequence (MM) and in the 3’ end (3’MM). Posteriorly, the small reads,
which still do not match with the pre-miRNA sequence, are submitted to
trimming rounds in their 5’ and 3’ ends. Each trim is performed once in a
round, where a single 5’ or 3’ nt is removed for subsequent sRNA map-
ping on the pre-miRNA reference ﬁle. This procedure can be performed
N times, according to the number of nucleotide trimmings determined by
the user. Reads that match to the pre-miRNA reference after the
trimming will be separated in R2, R3. . .RN ﬁles. These ﬁles contain a
raw table with the mapped sequences, the name of miRNA precursor
from which it potentially originated, their lengths, the variant nucleo-
tide(s) and the abundance of such variations in each sequence on the
analyzed library(ies) (Supplementary File 1).

Additionally, in a third step, the ﬁles with mapped reads can undergo an
abundance cutoff ﬁlter, to restrict the read values, speciﬁed in the conﬁg-
uration ﬁle. Finally, the fourth step relies on concatenation of the isomiRs
mapping results in a sub folder (MapResults). A graphical output is built
based on the mappings with or without abundance cutoff. In graphical
outputs, the pre-miRNA sequence is aligned with the miRNA and its
isomiRs sequences, also detailing the individual sRNA variation and the
abundance of each sequence in different libraries that were analyzed.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The isomiRID was implemented with python 2.7 and use Bowtie
for mapping the reads (Langmead et al., 2009). This framework

was tested on Linux and Mac OSX environment and settled in a
simple and standardized text ﬁle (see Supplementary File 1).
With the use of this conﬁguration ﬁle, it is possible to set more
than one input sRNA sequencing ﬁle to be analyzed and com-
pared. Sequence ﬁles can be in fastQ or fasta format. The ﬁlter-
ing process using reference genome or transcriptome is optional,
as well as the abundance cutoff, which can be applied for more
than one value (e.g. 10, 50 and 100) corresponding to the reads
sum in all libraries analyzed.

4 APPLICATIONS

The main goal of this workﬁow is to provide a tool to automate,
standardize and simplify the searches for isomiRs and non-
templated nucleotides in 3’ and 5’ miRNA ends, using as input
single or multiple sequencing data ﬁles in a comparative way.
The output ﬁles produced from this workﬂow are understand-
able tab delimited.txt ﬁles, which can be easily imported for
spreadsheet or statistical suits, as R package (Dimitriadou
et al., 2010). Also, the aligned output provides a broad view
of particular miRNAs and the abundance of their isomiRs
sequences in different sequencing datasets.

To validate our workﬂow, we applied the isomiRID to a
sRNA sequencing library previously reported Wyman et al.,
2011) (GEO:GSM740469).This library from normal human
prostate tissue encompasses several cases of 3’ miRNA additions,
reported by the previous authors. isomiRID was also tested with
Arabidopsis thaliana immunoprecipitated AGOl sRNAs
libraries, from two tissues (GSM707682 — ﬂower and
GSM707683 — leaf) (Wang et al., 2011). These analyses were
performed with miRNAs and pre-miRNA sequences retrieved
from miRBase release 19 (Kozomara et al., 2011), for each spe-
cies, and ﬁltered against the human genome release 11, available
on Metazome (http://www.metazome.net) and arabidopsis
genome v.9 (http://www.phytozome.net). The isomiRID outputs
for prostate data can be visualized in Supplementary Table S1
and Supplementary Figure S1. Arabidopsis results can be
achieved in Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary
Figure S2. In these result examples, the.xt ﬁles generated by
the mappings (r0, r1, M5 and M3), with the cutoff of 50, were
summarized in four different tabs in the Supplementary Tables
S1 and S2. The Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 show a few
examples of the graphical output for some miRNAs aligned with
their respective pre-miRNA and isomiRs. More details about the
output data interpretation can be found in Supplementary File 1,
also supplied as a quick start guide in the software download
page.

With the isomiRID, we are able to detect miRNA variations,
known as isomiRs. Regarding nucleotide variations detected as a
middle mismatch, they should be considered as individual biolo-
gical variation (SNP) or the result of enzymatic modiﬁcation like
A-I editing (Bahn et al., 2012). The 5’ and 3’ modiﬁcations that
the isomiRID detects could be also originated by the two mech-
anisms cited earlier in the text, or they can also be the result from
biological events of nucleotides additions by nucleotidyl transfer-
ases in the extremities of miRNAs. The use of more than one
round of trimming allows higher accuracy in identiﬁcation of 5’
and 3’ addition events for two or more nucleotides.

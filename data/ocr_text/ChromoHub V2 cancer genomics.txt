ABSTRACT

Summary: Cancer genomics data produced by next-generation
sequencing support the notion that epigenetic mechanisms play a
central role in cancer. We have previously developed Chromohub,
an open access online interface where users can map chemical, struc-
tural and biological data from public repositories on phylogenetic trees
of protein families involved in chromatin mediated-signaling. Here, we
describe a cancer genomics interface that was recently added to
Chromohub; the frequency of mutation, amplification and change in
expression of chromatin factors across large cohorts of cancer pa-
tients is regularly extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the
International Cancer Genome Consortium and can now be mapped on
phylogenetic trees of epigenetic protein families. Explorators of chro-
matin signaling can now easily navigate the cancer genomics land-
scape of writers, readers and erasers of histone marks, chromatin
remodeling complexes, histones and their chaperones.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chromohub is an online interface that allows the epigenetics
research community to project biological, structural and chem-
ical data on phylogenetic trees of protein families involved in
chromatin-mediated signaling (Liu et al., 2012). The interface is
a useful hub for cell biologists to ﬁnd chemical inhibitors target-
ing their proteins of interest, medicinal chemists to inspect the
structural coverage of speciﬁc binding sites or structural biolo-
gists to visualize the disease association of phylogenetic neigh-
bors to the construct they crystallized. We previously described
how protein families were assembled, phylogenetic trees gener-
ated and biological, structural and chemical data extracted from
public repositories and mapped on the trees (Liu et al., 2012). We
have now added to Chromohub a large section entirely focused
on genomic data from cancer patients extracted from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome
Consortium (ICGC).

Recent landmark next-generation sequencing campaigns of
large cancer patient cohorts have revealed recurrent alterations
of genes involved in epigenetic mechanisms (Biankin et al., 2012;

et al., 2012; Le Gallo et al., 2012; Morin et al., 2011; Pugh et al.,
2012; Robinson et al., 2012; Schwartzentruber et al., 2012;
Stephens et al., 2012; Varela et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012).
These results support the notion that chromatin-mediated signal-
ing may be central to cancer initiation and progression (Baylin
and Jones, 2011; You and Jones, 2012). The data associated with
most of these and other unbiased cancer genomic projects were
deposited into TCGA and the ICGC repositories, and made
publicly accessible to the scientiﬁc community. Chromohub
users can now map cancer genomics data on phylogenetic trees
of protein families involved in epigenetic mechanisms.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources

RNASeq gene expression data, promoter and full genome methylation
data and somatic mutation data were downloaded from TCGA’s
Firehose data run (https://conﬂuence.broadinstitute.org/display/GDAC/
Dashboard-Stddata). GISTIC copy number data were downloaded via
TCGA’s Firehose analyses run (https://conﬂuence.broadinstitute.org/
display/GDAC/Dashboard-Analyses). Furthermore, somatic mutation
data are also extracted from ICGC’s Data Portal (http://dcc.icgc.org/).
All data were stored in a MySQL database. A list detailing all datasets as
of November 2013 underlying Chromohub’s cancer genomics interface is
provided in Supplementary Table S1.

2.2 Somatic mutations

Only data derived from patients with both a tumor and a matched normal
sample were used. Using an anonymized patient identiﬁcation code for
each patient, the overall number of genes mutated within the patient’s
genome is stored and is used to ﬁlter out genomes that are hypermutated.
A protein image is presented showing all mutations matching the set
cutoffs; hovering over the mutations shows the amino acid change.
When not explicitly speciﬁed by TCGA or ICGC, amino acid mutations
are derived from genomic location, strand and mutated nucleotide.

2.3 RNASeq gene expression

Only data from patients with matched tumor and normal samples were
used. RSEM values are used to quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) ex-
pression levels (RNASeq V2 data). A logz fold change in gene expression
is calculated from RSEM values of tumor and matched normal samples
as follows:

longold change 2 Logz(RSEM[tumor]/RSEM[matched normal])

Underexpressed genes have negative logz values; overexpressed genes
have positive logz values. A rank is also generated for each gene, which
is determined by ordering the frequency of over/underexpression of all
genes (with available data using the speciﬁed cutoffs).

2.4 Copy number variation

The GISTIC 2.0 algorithm (Mermel et al., 2011) is used to produce copy
number variation data. This preprocessing step is conducted by TCGA’s
GDAC Firehose and the results are provided. Using anonimized patient
identiﬁcation codes, for each patient, the overall number of genes with
gains/losses within the patient’s genome is stored and is used to ﬁlter out
genomes with a high number of aberrations.

2.5 GISTIC copy number variation versus RNASeq gene
expression

Anonymous patient identiﬁcation numbers, provided by TCGA, were

used to determine patients where both GISTIC copy number and

RNASeq gene expression data were available. These data were used to

ﬁnd correlations between copy number variation and gene expression

levels in tumor samples.

2.6 Promoter methylation in cancer

Promoter methylation data are downloaded exclusively from TCGA’s
Firehose, but it is derived from two platforms, Human Methylation
27k (strictly promoter methylation) and Human Methylation 450k
(whole genome methylation). Promoter methylation using the Human
Methylation 450k array was deﬁned as 1000 bp upstream the transcrip-
tion start site, which was determined for all genes using coordinates from
the refGene table from the UCSC table browser (http://genome.ucsc.
edu/cgi—bin/hgTables?command=start).

3 RESULTS

Rather than listing gene-speciﬁc links to existing cancer genomics
portals, Chromohub provides integrated data focused on chro-
matin signaling. Users can visualize on phylogenetic trees of
protein families involved in epigenetic mechanisms the percent
of tumor samples across large patient cohorts where a gene is
mutated (compared with a non-tumor sample from the same
patient). Highly mutated genomes can be excluded from the ana-
lysis by setting a threshold for the maximum number of genes
mutated in a sample. The output is grouped by cancer type. As of
October 2013, 16 cancer types are represented by cohorts of >100
patients. High or low copy number gains as well as heterozygous
and homozygous deletions [corresponding to GISTIC values of
2, 1, —1 and —2, respectively (Mermel et al., 2011)] can also be
plotted on phylogenetic trees. Statistically relevant data (>100
patients) are available for nine cancer types. Unlike mutation
data, copy numbers are compared with those in the reference
human genome.

In addition to chromosomal aberrations, changes in transcrip-
tion proﬁles are also available: mRNA levels are compared be-
tween tumor and non-tumor samples from the same patient and
tissue. This provides a bird’s eye view of genes that are over-
expressed or repressed in speciﬁc cancer types for any protein
family related to epigenetic mechanisms. Orthogonal data types
can be projected on a tree simultaneously. For instance, combin-
ing mRNA expression and mutation data, users can rapidly see
that the histone methyltransferase MLL3 is mutated in 7% (54 of
776) and repressed in 21% (23 of 107) of breast cancer samples,
suggesting that this gene acts as a tumor suppressor.

Change in expression of a given gene is generally not driving
cancer initiation or progression, but simply a passenger event
(Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011), unless it is directly caused by

a chromosomal ampliﬁcation or deletion (Beroukhim et al.,
2007; Eifert and Powers, 2012). To identify candidate driver
events affecting chromatin factors, Chromohub allows users to
automatically highlight genes where overexpression correlates
with copy number gains. Using this approach, one can rapidly
see that, among genes containing a Tudor domain (which bind
methylated lysines and arginines), FXRl is overexpressed and
ampliﬁed in 53% (18 of 34) lung squamous cell carcinoma
patients.

4 CONCLUSION

Dysregulation of the chromatin signaling platform plays a major
role in cancer (Baylin and Jones, 2011; Timp and F einberg, 2013;
You and Jones, 2012); chromosomal aberrations and transcrip-
tional alteration affecting chromatin factors can drive initiation
and development of speciﬁc cancer types. The new Chromohub
interface is a simple tool to navigate the cancer genomics of
epigenetic mechanisms.

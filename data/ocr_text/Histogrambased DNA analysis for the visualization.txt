ABSTRACT

Motivation: We describe a novel approach to explore DNA
nucleotide sequence data, aiming to produce high-level categorical
and structural information about the underlying chromosomes,
genomes and species.

Results: The article starts by analyzing chromosomal data through
histograms using fixed length DNA sequences. After creating the
DNA-related histograms, a correlation between pairs of histograms
is computed, producing a global correlation matrix. These data
are then used as input to several data processing methods for
information extraction and tabular/graphical output generation. A set
of 18 species is processed and the extensive results reveal that
the proposed method is able to generate significant and diversified
outputs, in good accordance with current scientific knowledge in
domains such as genomics and phylogenetics.

1 INTRODUCTION

Phylogenetics concerns the study of the evolutionary relations
between groups of organisms. Nowadays phylogenetics beneﬁts
from molecular sequencing data techniques to gather extensive
data for analyses, aiming to improve research in areas such as
the evolutionary tree of life (Maddison et al., 2007; Schuh and
Brower, 2009), grouping of organisms, among many others. With the
advent of genome sequencing and genome databases, a large volume
of information is available for computational processing, allowing
worldwide research on decoding the informational structure present
in DNA sequences.

A massive amount of DNA information is being collected and
decoded, as result of a large collaborative effort among many

individuals and research institutions around the world, and is
available for scientiﬁc research. In Machado (2010), this evolving
area was addressed by applying mathematical tools to genome data,
revealing new information patterns.

In this study, we analyze the DNA code in the perspective of
identifying structural patterns in the nuclear and mitochondrial
genomes. Understanding DNA may be one of the most challenging
problems posed to the human knowledge (Nobel Prize Web
site, http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/ 1968/).
The decoding of the DNA complex structure may not only have
a primary level of biochemical detail, but also other levels of
information (Seitz, 2007). This Vision motivated the association of
logical and mathematical concepts, namely, histogram, correlation
and analysis/Visualization tools such as multidimensional analysis,
directed graphs and dendograms. Once established the methodology
for several species, its DNA data is used to pursue the Vision. In
the chosen DNA repository a substantial part, corresponding to
genes and short repetitive sequences (as deﬁned in the University
of California Santa Cruz Genome Bioinformatics web site), is
organized into chromosomes, which is our input data. In this study,
we consider the available nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of 18
species: 10 mammals, 2 birds (aves), 2 ﬁshes, l insect, 2 nematodes
and l fungus. We note that in most of the species the association of
genes to chromosomes is not yet incomplete. In Table l, we present
the chromosomal characteristics of those species.

The DNA implements an alphabet composed by the symbols
{T, C, A, G}. Any simple translation to a numerical counterpart
may impose bias and destroy intrinsic information. Consequently,
it was decided to directly process the non—numerical code. Due to
the immense volume of information, a histogram—based measure
was adopted. Nevertheless, in general, histograms do not capture
dynamics. In order to overcome this limitation, a ﬂexible pattern
detection algorithm based on counting the sequence of symbols
was considered (Vinga and Almeida, 2003). By ‘ﬁexible’ we mean
that the algorithm can count sequences of length n items, each one
composed by one of the four base symbols.

With the exception of Yeast (Sc), the available chromosome
data includes a ﬁfth symbol (‘N’), corresponding to masked DNA
symbols not belonging to the genome, which typically appear
in large contiguous sequences. For example, in the human Y
chromosome ﬁle there are 59 373 566 bp, of which 33710000 bp
are ‘N’ (56.78%) arranged in 17 sequences, the largest one
with 30 000 000 symbols. Another example is the Chicken Ga25
chromosome, with 2 051 775 bp, of which 663 879 are ‘N’ (32.67%)

HoY and Ga25 are just two examples of chromosomes with a
percentage of ‘N’ symbols > 10%, but most of the chromosomes
have smaller percentages.

We decided not to use ‘N’ in sequences as a ﬁfth symbol or
not to replace it by any of symbols {T, C, (i A}, because that
would introduce an unknown bias in the sequence processing. We
then considered two approaches: (a) removing all ‘N’ symbols in
a preprocessing step or (b) process sequences but ignoring any
sequence with an ‘N’. Although (a) and (b) may seem different,

The large number of bins (4096) visually helps understanding the
differences in the DNA base sequences of both chromosomes. These
differences are our main motivation to study the genomic DNA and
ﬁnd out if some high—level structural information will emerge.

In short, for our DNA sequence analysis process we adopted
(i) the histogram for translating the T, C, A, G symbols into
numerical values; (ii) the dynamical code characterization by means
of n—tuple sequences; (iii) the sequence similarity comparison using
a correlation method; and (iv) the identiﬁcation of hidden patterns
in the numerical sequence and subsequent high—level visualization
of those patterns.

Histogram-based DNA analysis

 

In this study, we demonstrate that a four—phase methodology
for DNA sequence analysis is able to reveal unexpected structural
patterns between nuclear chromosomes, either intra— or interspecies.
The results also reveal important high—level relationships between
chromosomes/species, showing the goodness of the proposed
method and motivating further research involving more complete
and extensive DNA data and other complementary scientiﬁc tools.

2 METHODS

After downloading the DNA data (in FASTA format) from the University
of California Santa Cruz Genome Bioinformatics web site, each DNA
chromosomal sequence was processed in order to remove the ‘N’ symbols
and to convert all base symbols to the {A, C, G, T} alphabet.

For the bin counting two possible approaches were considered, namely
windows without any overlapping, and windows with a partial overlapping
of the n base sequence. Several tests revealed that both approaches tend
to generate similar results, although some slight differences show up when
processing smaller chromosomes. Therefore, to get a more robust counting,
the one base sliding window (i.e. shift of one base and overlap of n—l
consecutive bases) was adopted. For that purpose we developed the ‘genhists’
application, available in the Supplementary Material, which requires as
parameters the chosen sequence length (n) and ﬁltered DNA sequence ﬁles,
generating the corresponding histogram ﬁles.

After obtaining the histograms for a given value of n and a set of
chromosomes, the second step in our analysis is to evaluate their similarities.
There are many methods for such task (Chaa and Sn'hari 2002; Ling and
Okada 2006; Werman et al. 1985). In the end, we obtain a correlation matrix
S=[Sij], where 5,7 is deﬁned as Sij =f(Hi, [{j)/\i, j=1,...,l’l (SijZSjiAi,
j=1,...,n; sii=1/\i=1,...,n) in which H,- and H]- are two histograms
of length m, the function f(H,-,Hj) is real valued and 0551-1-51. Being
interested in qualitative similarities, we opted for a method that measures
the portion of ranks that match between any two histograms. As such, we
adopted the statistical ‘Kendall r’ rank correlation method (Kendall, 1938),
which computes the correspondence between rankings of two histograms
and assesses its signiﬁcance based on the number of ‘concordant pairs’,
‘discordant pairs’ and ‘ties’ over all {Hi(a),HJ-(a)} and {Hi(b),HJ-(b)} pairs,
where a, b=1,...,m and a<b. We note that the Kendall r correlation
method is computationally expensive. Therefore, we adopted the efﬁcient
algorithm described in Christensen (2005). To generate a correlation
similarity matrix ﬁle, we developed the ‘gentauk’ application, also available
in the Supplementary Material, which requires as parameters the chosen
sequence length (n) and the histogram ﬁles, generating the corresponding
correlation matrix ﬁle.

The third step in the analysis consists in revealing embedded patterns in
the correlation matrix data. For this purpose, we start by considering the
multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique (Borg and Groenen, 2005; Cox
and Cox, 2001; Kruskal and Wish, 1978; Shepard, 1962; Tzeng et 01., 2008).
The MDS is a mathematical tool that represents, in a lower dimensional map,
a set of data points whose similarities (or alternatively distances) are deﬁned
in a higher dimensional space by means of a symmetric matrix S=[s,-j].
In the case of similarities and classical MDS, the matrix main diagonal is
composed of ones, while the rest of the matrix elements must obey the
restriction 0 5 Sl‘j 5 1(Sl‘j Z 0), i, j = 1, ...,m. Usually, in order to facilitate the
graphical representation, 2D and 3D MDS plots are used and its consistency
veriﬁed by means of Shepard and/or stress charts. To create the MDS plots,
we opted for the GGobi package, chosen due to its simplicity, speed and
robustness (http://www.ggobi.org).

Other than for MDS plots, a correlation matrix can be used to
produce graphs linking the most correlated items, in order to visualize
the underlying patterns between them. As such, we chose the GraphViz
package (http://www.graphviz.org), an open source software for representing
structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks, to
create directed graphs that show how chromosomes or species are related.

A correlation matrix can also be used to generate a dendogram, a tree—
like diagram depicting clusters resulting from some hierarchical clustering
method. To generate the dendograms in this study, we selected the
MultiDendograms hierarchical clustering package, conﬁgured for the ‘Joint
Between Within’ clustering method (Fernandez and Gomez, 2008).

The Supplementary Material contains the source code and the executable
ﬁles of our custom—developed applications, as well as input data ﬁles
(sequence histograms), output data ﬁles (for use with the GGobi, GraphViz
or MultiDendograms packages, images and videos) and some utility
applications (mostly conversion scripts to be used in UNIX or GNU/Linux
platforms).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Correlation analysis of the nuclear chromosomes

After generating the sets of 384 histograms for the nuclear
chromosomes of 18 species using sequences of length n: {1, . . . , 8},
for each value of n, we applied the Kendall ‘L' correlation method
(Kendall, 1938) to generate the corresponding 384 X 384 Snuclear
similarity matrix. As previously mentioned, to create the MDS plots
we use the GGobi package.

Figure 2 shows 3D MDS plots of the 384 nuclear chromosomes of
18 species for sequence lengths n = {3, 6}. Even with a length as low
as n=3, 3D patterns are easily noticeable. The same patterns can
also be observed in the n =6 plot, but better deﬁned and separated.

Figure 3 shows the result of performing a 3D MDS on the 384
nuclear chromosomes of 18 species for sequence length n: 8, with
two distinct bi—dimensional projections. The analysis of images in
Figures 2 and 3 shows the emergence of spatial patterns strongly
related with the chromosome grouping into species. Although MDS
plots were created for n ={1, . . . , 8}, we note that larger values of n
(7 or 8) generate MDS plots with better chromosome groupings and
more clearly separated species. We also observe that the quality
of chromosome grouping and species’ separation improves as n
increases, stabilizing around n: 8.

The similarity matrix Snuolear can also be used to produce graphs
linking the most correlated chromosomes, in order to visualize the
underlying structural patterns between them. The directed graph of
Figure 4, generated by GraphViz, shows how the chromosomes of
{Ho, Ch, Or} are correlated for n=8. A chromosome pointing to
another chromosome by means of a continuous line (labeled ‘1’)
ending in an arrow represents the chromosome that is most correlated
to the ‘pointed’ chromosome. If the line is a dashed one (labeled
‘2’) then the pointing chromosome is the second most correlated. In
Figure 4, only links with correlation Z 95% are visible and it shows
that {Ho, Ch, Or} chromosomes with the same ‘number’ are more

correlated to each other, although there are some exceptions: for
example, the Y chromosomes and the 2a and 2b chromosomes in
{Ch, Or}.

The Snuolear similarity matrix can also be used to generate a
dendogram, a tree—like diagram depicting clusters resulting from
some hierarchical clustering method. The dendogram of Figure 5
was created by the MultiDendograms hierarchical clustering
package (Fernandez and Gomez, 2008), using n=8 and the {Ho,
Ch, Or} chromosomes. In Figure 5, we can observe several levels
of {Ho, Ch, Or} clusterings (e.g. the clusters of chromosomes 10,
11, 1, 9, 15 in the left corner of Fig. 5).

3.2 Correlation analysis of the nuclear genome

Up to this point we concentrated on the nuclear chromosomes
separately. Another approach is to consider the nuclear genome as
a whole. This can be done by combining, for each species, all their
nuclear chromosome histograms, thus originating the corresponding

of {Ho, Ch, Or} for n28. Gray rectangle: chromosome, link r: connection

‘global nuclear histogram’. Subsequently, by applying the Kendall
‘L' correlation method to 18 species’ global nuclear histograms, a
species similarity matrix Sglobal is produced, and then processed to
generate some high—level visualizations.

Figure 6 presents the 3D MDS plot of 18 nuclear genomes for
sequence length n=8 and shows a clear spatial organization of
patterns involving species, particularly for the mammals, which are
strongly clustered with the exception of the Opossum. We also note
that the aves {Ga, Tg} are near each other, as well as the ﬁshes
{Zf, Tn}, and that the non—vertebrate species are far apart from the
vertebrates.

Figure 7 depicts how 15 of the 18 species are most correlated
to each other at primary level (continuous line, labeled ‘1’) and
at secondary level (dashed line, labeled ‘2’). Only links with
correlation 275% are visible. It also shows ﬁve clusters of species
in the graph: {Ho, Ch, Or}, {Cb, Ce}, {Mn, Rn}, {Ga, Tg} and {Eq,
Dg, Op, Po, Ox}.

3.3 Correlation analysis of the mitochondrial genome

Mitochondrial genomes have DNA sequence counts between 13 000
and 86 000 nt, while nuclear genomes have DNA sequences counts
between 12 000 000 and 3 500 000 000 nt. This means that the
mitochondrial data are very much smaller than the nuclear one.

After generating the sets of 18 histograms for the mitochondrial
chromosomes of 18 species using sequences of variable length n,
for each value of n we applied the Kendall ‘L' correlation method to
generate the corresponding 18 X 18 similarity matrix Smite.

Figure 8 reveals the result of performing a 3D MDS on the
mitochondrial chromosomes of 18 species for n=8. It also shows
a clear spatial organization of patterns involving mitochondrial
chromosomes, particularly mammals, primates and aves.

Figure 9 depicts how some of 18 mitochondrial chromosomes
are most related to each other at a primary (continuous line)
and secondary (dashed line) levels. Only links with correlation
230% are shown, for n=8. We can observe that there are ﬁve
primary clusters of chromosomes in the graph: from left to right
invertebrates, primates, {Rn, Mm, Op}, {Ox, Po, Eq, Dg} and
{Ga, Tg}.

The dendogram of Figure 10 describes the hierarchical clustering
of mitochondrial genomes using the ‘Joint Between Within’
clustering method, with the topmost clustering compressed for
clarity. Only species that associate in groups of two or more are
depicted in the dendogram of Figure 10 (i.e. 10 mammals, 2 aves,
2 ﬁshes and 2 nematodes).

4 DISCUSSION

We described a novel approach to DNA analysis, based on a
methodology that takes as input whole—genomic chromosome
sequences and then, using alignment—free sequence techniques,
extracts high—level information from histogram correlations. This
information is used to generate several types of tabular and/or
graphical outputs relating chromosomes or species.

In this study, an important parameter is the word length n, used
in the sequence processing and histogram constructions steps. The
n=1 case is just a mere counting of {T, C, A, G}, but when n goes
from 2 to 8 the corresponding 3D MDS plots reveal increasingly
evident spatial and structural patterns related to chromosomes, as
shown in Figure 11 for n=8. In this 3D rendering (with ‘shadows
on the ﬂoor’), we can observe the individual chromosomes and many

Op slightly apart); a grouping with Ga and Tg; and a grouping with
Ce and Cb. Fish species Zf and Tn are spatially far away from each
other. It is also noteworthy the existence of spatial structure in most
species: other than {Cb, Ce, Sc, Zf}, the remaining species reveal
a chromosomal ‘linear organization’, with ‘lines’ mostly parallel
between species. In most of the species, it is the sexual chromosome
that lies more far apart from the corresponding species’ ‘line’, but
this also happens with other non—sexual chromosomes.

We do not have an immediate explanation for this remarkable
structuring, but it may be related with higher levels of information in
chromosomes and genomes. The emergence of this apparently new
structural knowledge from chromosomal DNA seems to be unique
to our approach and suggests novel ways to investigate the higher
levels of information referred by (Seitz, 2007).

We also performed a study using nuclear and mitochondrial
chromosomes from 18 species, with results at the chromosome,
genome and species levels:

shown the emergence of intra— and interspecies spatial patterns,
based on an alignment—free sequencing and data mining of the
whole—chromosomal DNA data, instead of genes or other small
sequences.

Fig. 12. Graphs of the most correlated nuclear chromosomes for n=8
in chimpanzee and human. Gray rectangle: chromosome, link: connection
of highest similarity between two chromosomes. Asterisks mark the main
differences in chromosomal relationships. (a) Chimpanzee (n = 8, correlation

0 Directed graphs of nuclear and mitochondrial chromosomes
demonstrated that chromosomal relationships can be derived
from histogram correlations, as well as genomic/species
relationships.

0 Chromosomal—based dendograms have shown that histogram
correlations can be used to compute diagrams depicting
hierarchical clusterings of chromosomes and species.

In the dendogram of Figure 5, we observe that human, chimpanzee
and orangutan chromosomes cluster into three main groups:

- 10+11+1+9+15+12+7+2l2a+14+21
- 13+4+X+18+8+2b+5+3+6+Y
- 16+20+17+19+22

being the last one the most ‘different’. There is no immediate
explanation for this 16 + 20 + 17 + 19 + 22 cluster separation.

Using DNA base sequences partitioned into chromosomes,
this study also showed the possibility of obtaining high—level
chromosomal information like the most interspecies correlated
chromosomes (Figs 4 and 7).

Looking at the dendogram of Figure 10 and considering the
small amount of information stored in the mitochondrial genome, it
seems that it can be regarded as a kind of species’ signature. This
dendogram depicts a hypothetical phylogenetic tree very similar,
in qualitative terms, to those described in Wildman et al. (2007),
Murphy et al. (2007), Zhao and Bourque (2009), Prasad and Allard
(2008), Ebersberger et al. (2007), Dunn et al. (2008) and Hillier
et al. (2004). It should be noted that the processes described by
the aforementioned authors to generate the phylogenetic trees use
portions of the DNA base sequence, and not a ‘transformed’ version
like the one presented in this study. It should also be mentioned that
whole DNA chromosomal sequences were used, not just portions
like genes or other partial sequences.

Using the described histogram—correlation approach, it is also
possible to generate outputs showing the most intraspecies correlated
chromosomes and highlighting the differences. Figure 12 shows it
for chimpanzee and human, with structural distinctions marked with
an ‘asterisk’.

In Figure 12, we can observe that chromosomes Ch21/Ho21
are linked to distinct chromosome groups (1 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 15 in
chimpanzee, 7 + 12 + 14 in human), as well as ChX/HoX (4 + 13 in
chimpanzee, 3 + 5 + 6 in human) and others.

All described results contribute to the notion that nuclear and
mitochondrial genomes include structural information that allows
chromosomal analysis and other high—level analysis, as well as
species—related studies (e.g. evolutionary/comparative genomics and
phylogenetic tree construction).

4.1 Open issues and future work

In this study, we have used chromosomal information that is
incomplete, as explained in the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics
web site. For many of the species referred in Table 1, there is a
considerable amount of DNA sequence data that is not yet attached
to chromosomes or, being associated to a certain chromosome, with
its placement not yet deﬁned. This informational uncertainty is
undesirable and prone to contribute to misleading results, which are
not caused by the mathematical and computational tools adopted.

For data processing we used, for DNA sequence lengths, values
of n = 1, . . . , 8. Although larger values of n are admissible, it should
be noted that the total number of histogram bins is m = 4” and, with
a very large m, most of the histogram bins may become zero for
the smaller chromosomes. For example, for the smallest nuclear
chromosome considered (Scl, with 231 k bases), for n = 8 then m =
65 536 and there is an average of 3.5 samples per histogram bin, but
for Scl with n: 10 the average number of samples per histogram
bin drops to 0.2 (i.e. 4/5 of bins equal to zero). From the empirical
evidence gathered, the most promising values of n are 6, 7 and 8.
Further research should address and clarify this issue.

The Kendall 1' rank correlation method has proved to be adequate
for generating the correlation matrix S, but other correlation methods
were also tested. This issue will be the subject of further research
and evaluation.

Finally, the study should be repeated when complete genomic data
becomes available, and extended to more species, eventually with
greater ‘biological diversity’. As soon as more DNA species’ data
are available or updated, this issue will be addressed.

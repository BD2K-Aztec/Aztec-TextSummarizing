ABSTRACT

Summary: Chromosomal patterns of genomic signals represent
molecular fingerprints that may reveal how the local structural
organization of a genome impacts the functional control
mechanisms. Thus, the integrative analysis of multiple sources
of genomic data and information deepens the resolution and
enhances the interpretation of stand-alone high-throughput data.
In this note, we present PREDA (Position RElated Data Analysis),
an R package for detecting regional variations in genomics data.
PREDA identifies relevant chromosomal patterns in high-throughput
data using a smoothing approach that accounts for distance and
density variability of genomics features. Custom-designed data
structures allow efficiently managing diverse signals in different
genomes. A variety of smoothing functions and statistics empower
flexible and robust workflows. The modularity of package design
allows an easy deployment of custom analytical pipelines. Tabular
and graphical representations facilitate downstream biological
interpretation of results.

Availability: PREDA is available in Bioconductor and at
http://www.xlab.unimo.it/PREDA.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput technologies allow the complete exploration of
DNA and RNA molecules at genome-wide scale, thus offering
the opportunity to decipher the control mechanisms underlying the
functional utilization of a genome. Although hundred of studies fully
demonstrated the relevance of bioinformatics in analyzing each data
type alone, fewer approaches have been proposed for the integrative
analysis of genomics signals and genome structural organization.
Some of these methods speciﬁcally address the identiﬁcation of gene
expression patterns at the chromosomal level (Callegaro et al., 2006;
Pollack et al., 2002; Toedling et al., 2005), others the integrative
analysis of paired DNA copy number and gene expression data
(Bicciato et al., 2009; Lahti et al., 2009; Salari et al., 2010; Schafer
et al., 2009).

Here, we describe PREDA, an R/Bioconductor package for
detecting regional variations of genomic features from the
integrative analysis of high-throughput data and genome local
structural organization. The program implements a generalized
version of the integrative strategy ﬁrst introduced by Toedling et al.
(2005) and further improved by Callegaro et al. (2006) to identify
and prioritize targets for functional studies from diverse type of hi gh-
throughput data in different genomes (Bicciato et al., 2009; Coppe
et al., 2009; Ferrari et al., 2007; Nie et al., 2009; Peano et al.,
2007). PREDA integrates high-throughput signals and structural
information using a non—linear kernel regression with adaptive
bandwidth that efﬁciently accounts for the density variability of
genomics data. The integrative analysis is performed through a
modular and ﬂexible framework that, accommodating different types
of smoothing functions and statistics, facilitates its adoption in
a broad spectrum of genomics studies. The potential applications
range from the study of pathological processes involving genome
structure modiﬁcations, as for chromosomal ampliﬁcations and
deletions in cancer (e. g. integrative analysis of DNA copy number
and gene expression), to the analysis of physiological mechanisms
regulating genome utilization (e.g. identiﬁcation of genes co-
localized and co-expressed; analysis of tiling arrays). A detailed
description and discussion of the package is reported in the
Supplementary Material.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

PREDA has been implemented as a package for R statistical
environment and is compliant with Bioconductor standards for
bioinformatics packages development and documentation.

Data structures: the package takes advantage of basic
Bioconductor objects classes to facilitate the management of input
data and to allow an easier integration of the PREDA pipeline in
other workﬂows. Moreover, additional custom S4 data structures
have been deﬁned for a more efﬁcient management of data and
genomic information and to facilitate further customization of the
analysis workﬂow.

Modular framework: the basic computational framework has
been developed focusing on modularity. Therefore, it can be easily
extended if custom analytical pipelines are required for more
complex or specialized purposes, or to integrate PREDA analysis
into other computational pipelines.

Parallel computing: since the analytical procedure is time
consuming due to repeated cycles of data permutations and

smoothing, a parallelized version of the algorithm has been
implemented to reduce the computation time. The parallelization
is based on Rmpi (R interface to widespread MPI parallel libraries),
which allows taking advantage both of high performance computing
systems and of modern multicore processors that are currently
available in common desktop computers. The computing time scales
almost linearly up to elevate numbers of CPUs (Supplementary
Material).

Documentation: the PREDA speciﬁc S4 classes are discussed
and detailed in package Vignettes and in a step-by-step tutorial for
R users with different levels of experience. In addition, each function
of the package has a speciﬁc documentation page, according to
Bioconductor standards.

3 METHODS

The core of the PREDA procedure consists of three major steps:

(1) computation of the observed statistic on each position (e.g. genes,
transcripts, any other genomic feature);

2 non-linear re ression smoothin of observed statistics alon the
g g g
genomic coordinate;

(3) construction and smoothing of the expected statistics. The expected
statistic is obtained permuting the position-related statistics and
allows empirically estimating the local signiﬁcance of peaks in the
observed smoothed statistics (empirical P-Values).

The empirical P-Values resulting from permutations analysis are
subsequently adjusted to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) and used
to identify signiﬁcant genomic regions (Fig. 1). Several functions have
been implemented to facilitate the management of different input data
(e.g. genomics signals and annotations) and to enhance the extraction of
biologically relevant information from the output results (e.g. signiﬁcant
genomic regions). In addition, several alternative methods for data smoothing
and quantiﬁcation of statistics have been implemented to allow full
ﬂexibility and applicability to data obtained from different technologies
(Supplementary Materaial). PREDA supports a variety of tabular and
graphical options for Visualizing results at the level of single chromosomes
or of the entire genome (Fig. 1). The package contains some predeﬁned
workﬂows (implemented as wrapper functions) to perform the multiple steps
of PREDA in a facilitated way.

4 RESULTS

PREDA generalizes and strengthens previously proposed methods
for the integrative analysis of high-throughput data and genome
structural information (Bicciato et al., 2009; Callegaro et al., 2006;
Toedling et al., 2005). The modularity of the package allows
implementing different type of smoothing functions and statistics,
thus facilitating its application to different genomics data and
genomes. The core components of the method, i.e. (i) the data
smoothing with non—linear regression functions; (ii) the permutation
schema to evaluate the signiﬁcance of results; (iii) the statistics
computed on each gene and used as input for the analysis,
have been rendered of general applicability and enhanced over
prior implementations. The modiﬁcations aimed at improving the
sensitivity of the procedure in detecting small signiﬁcant genomic
regions and at controlling false positive results. The methodological
reﬁnements were tested on simulated datasets and the results are
discussed in details in the Supplementary Material. Results indicate
that the overall procedure for position-related data analysis is robust
to modiﬁcations of input statistics and can be adopted in a number
of different biological problems. However, simulations revealed that
selecting the optimal smoothing strategy might be critical to improve
sensitivity and reduce the FDR. As such, several alternative options
for data smoothing have been implemented in the PREDA package
along with a ﬂexible and modular framework of R functions that
would allow end users to deﬁne custom smoothing methods, when
needed.

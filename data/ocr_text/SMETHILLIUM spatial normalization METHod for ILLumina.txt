ABSTRACT

Summary: DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification
in human cells. Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip makes it
possible to quantify the methylation state of 27 578 loci spanning
14 495 genes. We developed a non-parametric normalization method
to correct the spatial background noise in order to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio. The prediction performance of the proposed
method was assessed on three fully methylated samples and three
fully unmethylated DNA samples. We demonstrate that the spatial
normalization outperforms BeadStudio to predict the methylation
state of a given locus.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modiﬁcation that regulates
transcription by gene silencing and have a role in the protection
of chromosomal integrity. Methylation occurs in cytosines
which precede guanines in dinucleotide called Cst. Illumina
HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (Illumina, 2008; Weisenberger
et al., 2008) is a valuable technology for genome-wide screen
of DNA methylation. As any microarray technology, BeadChip
suffers from spatial artifact that requires a correction in order to
improve the signal-to-noise ratio. To our knowledge, the methylumi
R package (Davis and Bilke, 2010) is the only one to deal with
Illumina methylation BeadChip but does not address the spatial
correction. The proposed method SMETHILLIUM consists of a
spatial correction of the background noise, a probe summarization
and a conﬁdence assessment. The performance of the method is
evaluated on siX real samples with known methylation states.

2 METHOD
2.1 BeadChip design
Let us note (3%.)FIMW the set of beads for the  methylated probes, and

(BIZ-)Flmny the set of beads for the  unmethylated probes for a locus i
(i = 1, ...,lehere N is the total number of loci). Whatever the methylation
state and for any locus i, the intensity signal for both types of probes is
measured by the same single colour channel using the single-base extension
process (Weisenberger et al., 2008). However, as purines and pyrimidines
are labelled, respectively, with a red and green dyes, beads can be attributed
to a red set R, or a green set G. For all probes, both red and green signal
M

intensities are quantiﬁed for any Bid. and  For a given channel, the raw

intensities are noted If; and 15..

2.2 Spatial normalization

On all Illumina methylation BeadChip, a number of no Negative Control
Beads (NCB) are calibrated to not hybridize with any DNA template. We
thus consider that the intensities measured on the NCB correspond to spatial
noise. More precisely, we assume that the red (respectively green) intensities
162., i: 1, ...,n0 (respectively 162, i: 1, . . . ,no) measured on these probes are
related to their locations BCf, i: 1, . . . , no (respectively BCI.G , i: 1, ...,no) on
the chip via an unknown function N R(-) (respectively Ng(-)). In the following,
we only consider the spatial noise in the red channel since the procedure for
the green channel is the same.

As local polynomial estimation techniques apply at the boundaries (Fan
and Gijbels, 1996), we estimate the function NR(-) non-parametrically by a
local polynomial estimator NR(-, s) constructed upon the 2D LOESS model.
The parameter s in (0,1] is called the span. A small s value will reduce
the bias of NR(-,s) and increase variance while a large s value will reduce
variance and increase the bias. Choosing s is an issue and we propose an
adaptive method for the choice of an optimal data-driven s based on cross-
Validation approach. Namely, for each colour channel, and for each s on an
arithmetic grid 8, we compute the average prediction error (PE) of NR(-) by
NR(-,s) as follows:

PE(s) 1 iﬁ (BCR s) IR )2
n0 i=1 R,—i , 9 0,, 9
where NR,_,-(- , s) is the leave-one-out version of the LOESS estimator NR(-, s).
We then choose the span s; which satisﬁes:
s; = argmin PE (s).
seS

The s; which minimizes the average PE is afterward used in the estimation
of NR(-). Our local polynomial estimator of NR(-) is then N120 =NR(-,s;§).
Note that the resulting estimator achieves the global optimal rate of Stone
(1984).

Once the span selected, the LOESS model allows the extrapolation of
the background noise for all the beads in the set R (respectively G) taking

into account their location. For the set R of all red beads, NR(B?:J.) is the

extrapolated value for a given bead where S is either M or U. The/1?]. intensity
corrected from the red background correction is computed as follows:

A'S-_ Ig—zv‘ngjHiiflgj—N‘R(B§j)>rs,
w ed(Ii,j,NR(BfJ))+1 otherwise,

with ed(i,b) =6 exp[1 —(b+8) / i] where i is the raw signal intensity and b
is its estimated background. We choose 6 :1 as recommended by Edwards
(2003). A similar procedure is applied to correct the green background noise.

2.3 Probe summarization

For each locus i, the method computes the methylated, unmethylated and
beta values using median (another method of summarization based on the
mean is available and described in the Supplementary Material) as follows:

~ "1" ’14 ~ "iv "U N Mi
Mi=Medj=1(IiJ)’ UiZMedFl (1130’ ﬂi : Mr+l7r’

 

where Medf=1(XJ-) is the median of (X1, . ..,Xn).
Depending on the beta value, a methylation state is assigned according to
the following decision rule for each locus i:

M if E,zO.5+l,
Si: U 1f ,81'305—1,
H if ,Bie(0.5—l,0.5+l),

where H represents a hemi-methylation state and 0 <15 0.5.

2.4 Conﬁdence for methylation state

In order to deﬁne a conﬁdence value for the assigned methylation state, a
non-parametric test is proposed. In the following, we only consider the red
beads since the test procedure for the green beads is the same. Namely, we
use the Wilcoxon—Mann—Whitney statistic test. For any given locus i, let
med? and medi-W be the theoretical values of the median of the normalized
intensities. Let medo be the theoretical value of the median of the normalized
NCB intensities. The test we propose works as follows:

l'Ho : max (med? , med?!) 2 medo
l'Hl : max (med? , med?!) < medo. versus

Typically, we expect that 1H0 is rejected for all loci since at least one type of
probes must be signiﬁcantly different from the NCB. Therefore, loci showing
systematically high P-Values over a set of experiments will be unreliable,
possibly for technical reasons.

2.5 ROC and performance prediction

In order to validate the efﬁciency of the method, DNA extracted from a T24
bladder cancer cell line was used. A ﬁrst group of DNA samples (called
met1.1, met3.1 and met3.2) was treated with Methylase SssI such that all
Cst loci are methylated. A second group of DNA samples (called RCA,
Zeb3.1 and Zeb3.2) was ampliﬁed by PCR for the RCA sample and by
the Zebularine methylation inhibitor for the Zeb3.1 and the Zeb3.2 samples
such that all Cst loci are unmethylated after treatment. Therefore, both
groups of samples are representative of a fully methylated DNA and a
fully unmethylated DNA. Then, both groups of samples were individually
hybridized on Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip and separately
normalized according to the proposed method. Raw data are available from
our web site. The pooled beta values of the six samples were considered
to assess the prediction performance. For each sample and each locus, the
methylation state was assigned as described above. For each 1 in [0,05],
the proportions of correctly classiﬁed loci pM(l) and pU(l) are computed as
follows: let (,8?“),-=1MN and (,BIRCALELMN be, respectively, the beta values
for the methylated and the unmethylated samples. Then,

ROC Curve
Fig. 3. ROC curves for the pooled six samples.

Figure 1 shows the global performance criterion on the beta values calculated
with the SMETHILLIUM procedure, the BeadStudio procedure and also
the raw data (beta values computed without any normalization and with
intensities summarised using the mean). Figure 3 illustrates the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves obtained by the same three methods.

2.6 Results

Figures 1, 2 and 3 shows that the spatial normalization allows a better
separation between the methylation state than the Illumina’s proprietary
software BeadStudio (Illumina, 2008). This is conﬁrmed by the global
criterion in Figure 1. Our method allows a better concentration of the beta
values around their expected value allowing the possibility to better identify
intermediate state such as hemi-methylation. For a l threshold of 0.35, the
global performance criterion is 80% after SMETHILLIUM normalization,
53% with BeadStudio and 60% without normalization (raw).

3 CONCLUSION

We developed a non-parametric spatial normalization method
that improves the signal-to-noise ratio allowing a more reliable

prediction of the methylation state as compared with BeadStudio.
The method is implemented in R and publicly available. We
recommend the user to use in-house experiments in order to deﬁne
the most optimal 1 threshold for their data.

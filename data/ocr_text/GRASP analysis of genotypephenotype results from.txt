ABSTRACT

Summary: We created a deeply extracted and annotated database of
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) results. GRASP v1.0 con-
tains >6.2 million SNP-phenotype association from among 1390
GWAS studies. We re-annotated GWAS results with 16 annotation
sources including some rarely compared to GWAS results (e.g.
RNAediting sites, lincRNAs, PTMs).

Motivation: To create a high-quality resource to facilitate further use
and interpretation of human GWAS results in order to address import-
ant scientific questions.

Results: GWAS have grown exponentially, with increases in sample
sizes and markers tested, and continuing bias toward European an-
cestry samples. GRASP contains >100 000 phenotypes, roughly:
eQTLs (71.5%), metabolite QTLs (21.2%), methylation QTLs (4.4%)
and diseases, biomarkers and other traits (2.8%). cis-eQTLs,
meQTLs, mQTLs and MHC region SNPs are highly enriched among
significant results. After removing these categories, GRASP still con-
tains a greater proportion of studies and results than comparable
GWAS catalogs. Cardiovascular disease and related risk factors pre-
dominate remaining GWAS results, followed by immunological, neuro-
logical and cancer traits. Significant results in GWAS display a highly
gene-centric tendency. Sex chromosome X (OR = 0.18[0.16-0.20])
and Y (OR = 0.003[0.001-0.01]) genes are depleted for GWAS results.
Gene length is correlated with GWAS results at nominal significance
(P: 0.05) levels. We show this gene-length correlation decays at in-
creasingly more stringent P-value thresholds. Potential pleotropic
genes and SNPs enriched for multi-phenotype association in GWAS
are identified. However, we note possible population stratification at
some of these loci. Finally, via re-annotation we identify compelling
functional hypotheses at GWAS loci, in some cases unrealized in stu-
dies to date.

Conclusion: Pooling summary-level GWAS results and re-annotating
with bioinformatics predictions and molecular features provides a
good platform for new insights.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revolutionized the
study of human genetics for numerous traits and diseases, but
have rarely been used to synthesize results across traits and

diseases (Huang et al., 2011; Johnson and O’Donnell, 2009;
Sivakumaran et al., 2011). Biomolecular annotations of results
from GWAS are not uniformly applied across studies hampering
comparisons even for fundamental aspects such as overlap with
genes (Johnson and O’Donnell, 2009). Scientists commonly use
existing GWAS results databases to provide evidence for associ-
ation but these databases have signiﬁcant limitations in annota-
tions applied, and studies and results included (Hindorff et al.,
2009; Hong et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013; Palleja et al., 2012;
Thorisson et al., 2009). We collected >6.2 million available re-
sults from 1390 GWAS papers to create a large results database
deeply annotated in a uniform manner. In analysis of collected
results, we observe temporal trends across GWAS studies, dem-
onstrate how deep annotation can lead to functional hypotheses
often missed in original reports, and show how data mining
across diverse phenotypes reveals putative pleiotropic loci and
variants. The Genome-wide Repository of Associations between
SNPs and Phenotypes (GRASP) is freely available for query and
download (http://apps.nhlbi.nih.gov/grasp), and plans to accept
submission of additional results for public posting and archiving
in future releases.

2 METHODS
2.1 Search strategies and study and SNP-level data
extraction

Controlled vocabulary searches of PubMed and GoogleScholar were
applied to identify potential studies, and abstracts, and where necessary
articles, were reviewed to determine if inclusion criteria were met. Brieﬂy,
studies had to be published before January 1, 2012 and report association
testing of :25 000 SNP markers for :1 human trait to be included.
Studies which did not report any single SNP testing, or which focused
on SNP—SNP, gene—gene or gene—environment effects without reporting
single SNP main effects were excluded. All association results with
P 5 0.05 were extracted from each article including consideration of all
article text, ﬁgures, tables and Supplemental Materials including external
websites. More details on inclusion criteria for studies and results can be
found at http:// apps.nhlbi.nih.gov/ grasp. A web server at this site allows
full download of the database, or querying through a variety of mechan-
isms including phenotypes, SNPids, gene names, chromosomal location
and P—value ﬁltering.

Study-level information was annotated for each study. Some informa-
tion such as sample size and ancestry was extracted from the NHGRI
GWAS catalog (Hindorff et al., 2009) and then supplemented and ver-
iﬁed. Imputation and number of variants tested for each study was re-
ported post-quality control (QC) ﬁlters when described. If exact numbers
were unavailable the numbers were estimated based on the genotype

platform(s) or imputation description. Each study was reviewed to iden-
tify whether any gender-speciﬁc samples (male only or female only) were
included in the discovery and/or replication phase, and to determine if
any studies were exclusively male or female. The number of samples in
different ancestry categories in discovery and replication phases was re-
corded for each study. Reported ethnogeographic categories include:
European, African, East Asian, Indian/South Asian, Hispanic, Native
American, Aboriginal, Micronesian, Arab/Middle Eastern, Mixed
(a mixed sample was reported but speciﬁc proportions were not given)
or Unknown (an unspeciﬁed sample).

2.2 Construction and uniform annotation of GRASP
GWAS database

Results for each study were reviewed to eliminate duplicative entries and
ensure each result had a statistical P—value assigned. Phenotype descrip-
tions were harmonized at the level of each study, and broad (e. g. cancer)
and narrow (e.g. melanoma) phenotype categories were assigned to fa-
cilitate search and categorization. SNP identiﬁers were mapped to a single
dbSNP build (Build 134). Where valid SNPids could not immediately be
veriﬁed, or SNP chromosome and position were given, several informat-
ics strategies were used to recover a valid SNPid if possible. SNP identi-
ﬁers were used to provide consensus mapping of all results to the same
genome build (GR37), and SNPs with poor mapping were discarded
(n = 2062).

Consensus gene boundaries in GR37 were established based on UCSC
RefSeq genes track, deriving the maximal boundaries (5’ to 3’) for all gene
isoforms. This gene set was used to uniformly annotate all results for gene
overlaps based on SNP positions. SNPs overlapping multiple genes were
annotated as being in all genes they overlapped. Counts of GWAS SNPs
tested within genes were estimated based on a European HapMap
(release 22) from the Framingham Heart Study (11 = 2543 887 SNPs).
Additional SNP-speciﬁc annotations were applied including: dbSNP
functional category, observed alleles in dbSNP and heterozygosity,
global minor allele frequency (MAF) in dbSNP, validation status
in dbSNP, clinical annotation in dbSNP and for non-synonymous
SNPs, where available, PolyPhen2, SIFT and LS-SNP prediction
results. Other functional annotations were added based on SNP position
intersections including overlaps with: lincRNAs, miRNA-coding regions
from minase, miRNA-binding sites from PolymiRTS 2.0, regulatory
annotations from ORegAnno, conserved predicted transcription factor
binding sites (TFBS) from UCSC and validated human enhancer se-
quences from VistaEnhancers. Protein functional regions (e.g. post-trans-
lational modiﬁcations) from UniProtKB were mapped via several
bioinformatics approaches to their corresponding codons and 3-base gen-
omic positions and then checked for intersection with each SNP in
GRASP.

2.3 Comparison to NHGRI GWAS catalog

The NHGRI GWAS catalog was downloaded on March 27, 2013. All
valid SNP associations were retained for studies published through the
date of December 31, 2011 to provide a comparable time frame to
GRASP. Results from the same MHC region (chr6: 29 000 000 to
33 500 000 GR37) were removed for sub-comparisons. Studies that did
not overlap between the NHGRI catalog and GRASP were examined to
determine why. We compared GRASP SNP results to the NHGRI cata-
log SNP results at three different P—value thresholds: P 5 5E — 8, a com-
monly applied genome-wide signiﬁcance threshold; P<1E— 5, a
moderate threshold applied to the least signiﬁcant results in the
NHGRI catalog; and P5005, the liberal threshold applied for the
least signiﬁcant results in GRASP.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Description of the GRASP database results

At a genome-wide signiﬁcant level (Pg 5E — 8), there is clear
enrichment of gene expression eQTL results and MHC class-II
region results (Fig. 1). Expression QTL, methylation QTL and
metabolomics QTL studies and 6p21.3 results in the MHC class-
11 region were removed from subsequent analyses, except where
noted, in order to focus on primary diseases, risk factors and
biomarkers, and to identify pleiotropic regions beyond the MHC
region.

The studies included in GRASP contribute very different pro-
portions to the overall database. The following are proportions
of the 1390 studies in bins for number of results with P3 0.05:
0 results (2.2%), 1—100 results (63.5%), 101—1000 results
(26.5%), 1001—10 000 results (4.0%), 10 001—100 000 results
(2.7%), >100 000 results (1.1%). Study-level annotations were
used to enumerate results in general and speciﬁc categories.
The top-most represented phenotypes and phenotype categories
are shown at P3 0.05 and P3 5E— 8 in Figure 2 for
Cardiovascular traits and risk factors including lung and
kidney disorders (Fig. 2A), immunological (Fig. 2B), neuro-
logical (Fig. 2C) and cancer phenotypes (Fig. 2D). These results
distributions provide a rough composition of the body of GWAS
results with the most results in the cardiovascular domain and its
risk factors, followed by immunological phenotypes, neuro-
logical traits and diseases and then cancer phenotypes. The
broad phenotype domains are non-exclusive; e.g. brain cancers

are counted in both neurological and cancer domains. The dis-
tribution of phenotypes in GRASP is obviously influenced by
factors including the number of studies in a given phenotype
area, sample size (statistical power) of those studies, the
number of ‘true’ results for those phenotypes and the extent to
which authors’ disclosed results (e.g. full GWAS scan results). In
general there were far fewer signiﬁcant cancer results in GRASP
which may reflect fewer studies and less disclosure of results in
that domain. Cardiovascular-related results predominate in part
due to the availability of full results for GWAS scans of cardio-
vascular disease and its risk factors (e.g. lipids, blood pressure,
body mass index).

Unlike other GWAS results catalogs, the GRASP database
stores a location for each result allowing estimation of the pro-
portion of results in different manuscript portions. At
P3 5E — 8, location of results among 1390 papers was seg-
mented as follows: Supplemental Materials tables or full scan
results (87.9%), main article table (11.5%), main text or any
ﬁgure (0.6%). At nominal signiﬁcance levels (Pg 0.05), 99.6%
of results were found in a Supplemental Materials table or full
scan. While more signiﬁcant results tend to occur in main tables,
these results distributions demonstrate that across the signiﬁ-
cance spectrum most results appear in Supplementary
Materials. Supplementary Materials are generally unedited, not
included in most automated literature download tools and pre-
sent a wider diversity of information formats than main mater-
ials. The data-handling challenges presented by Supplementary
Materials, and to a lesser degree ﬁgures and text, necessitate that
a comprehensive GWAS database requires manual curation and
at best semi-automated processing of results is feasible.

3.2 Chronological trends across 1390 GWAS studies

The growth in published GWAS studies through the end of 2011
is best approximated by an exponential function (r2 = 0.956),
though the year of 2011 itself demonstrates a strong linear
trend (r2 = 0.997) indicating a saturation rate may have been
reached and projecting continued linear growth. Journals pub-
lishing the most GWAS included in GRASP were Nature
Genetics (n = 308), Human Molecular Genetics (HMG)
(n = 108), PLOS Genetics (n = 104), PLOS One (n = 68) and
American Journal of Human Genetics (AJHG) (n = 55). In
2011, Nature Genetics and AJHG sharply decreased in the
number of GWAS published, whereas HMG, PLOS Gen, PLOS
One and Human Genetics all sharply increased GWAS publica-
tions. The number of studies conducting SNP imputation grew
linearly between the period of 2006—2011, though in total still
only comprising 29.0% (n = 476) of the studies in GRASP.
Modest growth in the number of markers tested in GWAS is
similarly observed over time. Affymetrix and Illumina platforms
predominate over others with only 6.7% of studies reporting
any, or exclusive (4.2%), use of another GWAS platform
(Perlegen>Invader> Sequenom). Illumina SNP arrays were
applied in the greatest portion of studies (61.0%) versus
Affymetrix (42.1%), and showed faster growth over 2008—2011.

The publication bias of GWAS toward European ancestry
samples has previously been studied (Need and Goldstein,
2009). In an updated view of this analysis, we ﬁnd this trend
continues and even strengthens through the end of 2011
(Fig. 3). The next fastest growing ancestry classiﬁcations in
GWAS studies were East Asians, mixed ancestry studies and
then African ancestry samples. Even within studies including
multiple ancestries, European samples are most common fol-
lowed by African>East Asian>Hispanic>Indian/South
Asian. These results suggest that there remains a large gap in
our understanding of worldwide population genetic influences on
traits, and there should be continuing opportunity for novel-sci-
entiﬁc discoveries to be made by increasing both the sample size
and diversity of populations studied.

3.3 Genes enriched or depleted for GWAS results

We ﬁrst reported the gene-centric tendency of signiﬁcant SNPs in
GWAS (Johnson and O’Donnell, 2009). Here we ﬁnd a strong
central tendency of more signiﬁcant results after excluding
eQTLs, mQTLs and the MHC region (Fig. 4). Compared to
the background proportion of imputed SNPs outside genes,
GWAS results outside genes with P< 1E — 4 are particularly en-
riched within ~50 kb 5’ or 3’ of genes (Fig. 4, inset). Gene-centric
associations are likely to have the most plausible functional
mechanisms (e.g. protein sequence, RNA splicing, processing,
degradation or translational efﬁciency), thus we chose to conduct
analysis of genes enriched or depleted for signiﬁcant GWAS
ﬁndings within their transcript-coding boundaries.

There were 3984 out 23 026 UCSC RefSeq genes annotated as
lacking any GWAS result within their gene boundary at nominal
signiﬁcance (Pg 0.05). Of these genes, 496 were X-mapped and
111 were Y-mapped. Thus, genes having at least one nominally
signiﬁcant GWAS result were extremely depleted on the X
chromosome and Y chromosome relative to autosomal genes
(X-chromosome OR = 0.179 [0.157-0.204]; Y-chromosome

Genes with no reported GWAS result were signiﬁcantly shorter
(median size = 1172 bp, mean size = 6130 bp) than those with at
least one GWAS result (median size = 24 774 bp, mean
size = 62 624 bp). Autosomal gene length was correlated with
the number of nominally signiﬁcant (P3005) GWAS results
(r2 = 0.81) (Fig. 5, top panel and Table 1). At more stringent
thresholds this correlation attenuated (e.g. r2 = 0.0006 at
P<5E—8; Fig. 5, bottom panel). There is an inflection point
in the gene length to association correlation between —
log10(4.0) and —log10(5.0) (Table 1), which suggests a fuzzy
boundary where the prior positive of association likely increases

signiﬁcantly, somewhat consistent with several prior studies
examining thresholds and indicating weak polygenic effects for
many traits (Broer et al., 2013; Evans et al., 2013). For this
reason we chose P< 1E — 4 as a midpoint to consider gene en-
richment for GWAS results. Since the speciﬁc SNPs tested in
each study are unknown, we used a set of 2.5 million SNPs

Analysis of genotype-phenotype results

 

from a HapMap European imputed dataset and examined the
correlation between number of SNPs tested and GWAS associ-
ations in genes. We observe very similar patterns of correlation
to the gene length analysis (Table 1).

We identiﬁed outlier autosomal genes either most enriched or
depleted for GWAS results relative to their gene size at P—value
thresholds of 0.05, IE —4, and 5E — 8 (Fig. 5), assuming gene
length is a rough proxy for the number of haplotypes and vari-
ants tested. The largest autosomal gene depleted in GWAS as-
sociations was 1.9 Mb E YS, the largest eye-speciﬁc gene, well
conserved across many species and found to be mutated in ret-
initis pigmentosa families (Abd El—Aziz et al., 2008). Some genes
appear enriched primarily due to single traits or correlated traits,
and likely reflect extensive LD and correlated associations (e.g.
ADAMTSL3, BRE, CCDCQI, DOCK7, FBNI, FTO, PCLO,

SIK3 localized near APOA5, U GT cluster). A subjective selection
of potentially pleiotropic-enriched genes was made with their
GWAS results summarized in Table 2. Several of these gene re-
gions were originally highlighted in a prior analysis of 118
GWAS papers (ABO, CDKALI, CRHRI-KIAAI267, CSMDI,
RBFOXI) (Johnson and O’Donnell, 2009), or later in an analysis
of the NHGRI GWAS catalog (BNC2, CDHI3, ESRI, PTPRD,
THADA) (Sivakumaran et al., 2011).

Some of the loci highlighted have plausible phenotype inter-
sections (e.g. ABO, CRHRI-KIAAI26 7) while others are less in-
tuitive. These may represent true pleiotropic effects, antagonistic
pleiotropy, false positive associations or possible confounding.
RBFOXI is interesting as it was associated in GRASP with a
range of phenotypes including neural ones (hearing, BD, schizo-
phrenia, ADHD measures, anti-depressant outcomes), and the

gene encodes a splicing factor with relative neural speciﬁcity
(Fogel et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012), thus, having the potential
to effect many target genes and diverse phenotypes. Subsequent
to the results included in GRASP, RBFOXI SNPs and deletions
have been associated with other neural phenotypes including
glioblastoma (Hu et al., 2013), temporal lobe volume in
Alzheimer’s disease (Kohannim et al., 2012), visual refractive
error (Stambolian et al., 2013), autism (Davis et al., 2012) and
epilepsy (Lal et al., 2013a, b) making it a compelling case for a
pleiotropic gene. RBFOXl is further suggested to have under-
gone positive selection and as a target for FOXP2, a transcrip-
tion factor with key roles in brain plasticity and language
development (Ayub et al., 2013).

The potential effects of population stratiﬁcation are rarely dis-
cussed in the pleiotropy literature. If a locus or allele shows
strong population stratiﬁcation, given associations across many
phenotype studies this may lead to an erroneous conclusion of
pleiotropic effects. Common GWAS approaches to control
stratiﬁcation of single or double genomic-control correction
and principal components analysis are not uniformly applied,
and even when applied may not always be adequate to address
stratiﬁcation (Yan et al., 2013). Thus, caution and further de-
tailed study is warranted for suggested pleiotropic genes.

3.4 Repeatedly associated SNPs across GWAS

We searched for SNPs that were found across many studies.
These SNPs, or their correlated variants, may be the most obvi-
ous targets for functional assessment of pleiotropy and possible
mechanistic inights. Among those reaching genome-wide signiﬁ-
cance in one or more study, the most frequent SNP was
rs1260326 in the GCKR gene causing a Leu446Pro amino acid
change (n = 98 associations with P3 0.05; n = 62 associations
with P< 5E — 8), associated with traits including lipids, C-react-
ive-protein levels, HOMA-IR, platelet count, red blood-cell
count, eGFR (glomerular ﬁltration rate), uric acid and metabolic
syndrome. Many other SNPs were highly repeated at genome-
wide signiﬁcant levels across publications and map to described
pleiotropic regions: e.g. MHC SNP rs6457617 (intergenic be-
tween HLA-DQBI and HLA-DQA2, n = 25 times with
P< 5E — 8 across studies), rs1800775 (upstream of CETP,
n = 42), rs3184504 (in SH2B3, n = 39), rs4420638 (APOE,
n = 39), rs646776 (SORTI, n = 38), rs1800562 (HFE, n = 34),
rs964184 (ZNF259, n = 33), rs6511720 (LDLR, n = 29),
rs7903146 (T CF7L2, n = 28). These examples are well-
recognized, in many cases known since candidate gene and link-
age studies (Johnson and O’Donnell, 2009).

Also of interest are SNPs repeated many times but which have
not reached, or rarely reached, genome-wide signiﬁcance levels in
this build of GRASP. These could represent unappreciated pleio-
tropic alleles, or alternatively might reflect loci demonstrating
signiﬁcant population stratiﬁcation. A M UCI SNP, rs4072037,
was found to be strongly associated with decreased serum mag-
nesium levels (P<2.0E— 36) in a European ancestry sample
(Meyer et al., 2010). Only weeks later the same SNP allele was
associated with decreased gastric cancer risk in a Chinese sample
(P< 4.2E — 7) (Abnet et al., 2010) and later replicated (Shi et al.,
2011). MUCl is a highly spliced gene and a later study shows
rs4072037 functionally affects splice variants in the gastric

epithelium, causing a 9-amino acid deletion modifying both the
signal peptide and N-terminal amino acid of the mature protein
(Saeki et al., 2011). MUCl has been linked to a variety of cancer
types and targeted for therapeutics and diagnostics. Thus, the
combined genetic and non-genetic studies suggest MUCl is an
important pleiotropic gene with implications for several
disorders.

Intronic SNP rs6475082 in BN C2 is modestly associated with a
range of glycemic traits in diabetics and non-diabetics, retinal
and renal complications in Type I diabetes, LDL and total chol-
esterol and change with statins, Creutzﬁeld—Jakob disease, cor-
onary artery calcium, height (P-value range of association 0.04
through 1.8E—7). BNC2 is also notably enriched for GWAS
associations at the gene level, reaching genome-wide signiﬁcance
for ovarian cancer, freckles and glycated hemoglobin in T1D
(Table 2). Recent papers have replicated associations of BNC2
with human skin color (Jacobs et al., 2013), and the gene inﬂu-
ences coat color in mice (Smyth et al., 2006) and pigmentation
and fertility in zebraﬁsh (Lang et al., 2009). The human and
animal models show a convergence of ovarian and skin-related
phenotypes indicating potential causal roles for BNC2 in these
traits. Although skin color is a complex trait it is expected to
correlate with ethnogeographic status. It is possible that other
trait associations at this locus could represent unresolved strati-
ﬁcation. A study of BNC2 variants in a Norwegian T2D popu-
lation cohort did not replicate the GWAS associations with
glycated hemoglobin in TlD samples (Hertel et al., 2011).

Another example of possible stratiﬁcation effects is rs2011946
(and several correlated variants) which map between DARS and
CX CR4 in a region with histone and chIP-seq signatures in
ENCODE. CXCR4 is a well-studied protein with recognized
pleiotropic functions including but not limited to cancer biology
and HIV viral entry, making it an appealing candidate for gen-
etic pleiotropy. This single SNP is associated with 16 traits and
disorders (P-value range 0.04 through 6.9E — 7), many of which
are uncorrelated including melanoma, BMI, arthritis, epilepsy,
Alzheimer’s disease and cholesterol. The SNP also maps ~220 kb
3’ of the lactate dehydrogenase gene (LCT) a known major
human population stratiﬁcation locus (Campbell et al., 2005;
Moskvina et al., 2010), raising the question of whether some
phenotype associations near CX CR4 may reflect population
stratiﬁcation. Indeed the authors of the strongest association
(melanoma, P<6.8E—7) showed rs2011946 allele frequencies
varied strongly across their geographic samples and eliminated
the variant from further study (Bishop et al., 2009). These results
indicate that caution may be needed in asserting pleoitropic
hypotheses based on GWAS particularly when a large range of
relatively uncorrelated phenotypes are observed for a given vari-
ant or locus.

3.5 Deep annotation indicates functional hypotheses

Authors of GWAS articles often rely on ‘in—house’ annotations,
query tools such as SNAP (Johnson et al., 2008) and LocusZoom
(Pruim et al., 2010) and genome browser visualization to inter-
pret associations. They may be limited by available bioinfor-
matics specialists, time to devote to annotation and space in
publications to provide detailed descriptions, and are always
limited by the historic information available at the time of

their analysis. Thus, annotations are relatively non-standardized
across studies (Johnson and O’Donnell, 2009). Standardizing
and updating annotations to include new information
sources may allow for new functional hypotheses and potentially
important insights. We annotated GRASP with a variety of
annotation sources including predicted functional impact of
non-synonymous SNPs, UniProtKB functional domains and
post-translational modiﬁcations and regulatory annotations in
order to identify functional hypotheses for speciﬁc loci.

We subjectively selected several interesting annotations of
GWAS variants in GRASP from among genome-wide signiﬁ-
cant ﬁndings and present their summary in Table 3. A locus
on llql3.3 has been consistently associated with increased risk
for prostate cancer in GWAS and replication studies (Eeles et al.,
2008, 2009; Gudmundsson et al., 2009; Kote-Jarai et al., 2008;
Thomas et al., 2008). One of the strongest SNPs in common
across these studies is rs10896450. Across all the previous studies
this locus and associated variants were not annotated, were
described as being in ‘a gene desert’, or 67 kb away from
M YEO V. This variant was flagged in GRASP for its overlap
with known CTCF sites in the ORegAnno database (Grifﬁth
et al., 2008) and for proximity to lincRNAs (Cabili et al.,
2011). Visualization in UCSC Genome Browser shows the over-
lap in the ENCODE project with a strong CTCF signal as well as
nearby conserved transcription factor binding sites (Fig. 6). Two
lincRNA-coding regions appear nearby in head-to-head conﬁg-
uration, with the 5’-most lincRNAs (TCONS_00019682,
TCONS_00019683) exhibiting relatively testes-speciﬁc gene ex-
pression. This evokes a new hypothesis whereby the prostate
cancer risk increase may be mediated by cis-effects on one or
more of the lincRNA isoforms in the region. Notably, the
lincRNA data was not yet available at the time of the original
publications, providing an example of how updated annotations
such as those in GRASP may shed new light on prior ﬁndings.

Missense variants or other variants affecting protein sequence
provide appealing hypotheses, though many such variants are
neutral in their impact. Use of multiple prediction tools may

Table 3. Selected functional hypotheses from GRASP annotations

improve annotation of putative functional variants. We included
three nSNPs prediction annotations in GRASP: PolyPhen2,
SIFT and LS-SNP, as well as annotations on splicing effects,
and protein function annotations from UniProtKB mapped to
SNP codons. Integrating these sources, we ﬁnd interesting vari-
ants through multiple annotations. Three examples are shown in
Table 3 for PLPL3, WRNI and CPNEI. Missense variant
rs738409 (PLPL3, Il48M) is a good example of GWAS results
that converge on a likely functional variant. This SNP is pre-
dicted damaging by two programs and known to affect protein
function, as captured in UniProtKB annotations, by in vitro
assays, decreasing emulsiﬁed triglycerides and increasing hepatic
fat stores (He et al., 2010). The variant is associated in GWAS
with non-alcoholic hepatic statuses, alanine aminotransferase ac-
tivity and soluble ICAM-l levels.

A variant in CPNEI, rs2425068 (A> G), was associated with
plasma protein C levels, an important anticoagulant whose
reduction associates with venous thromboembolism (Tang
et al., 2010). While the original authors annotate this variant
as synonymous, we ﬁnd that it alters a consensus 3’ acceptor
splice site from AA>AG. In doing so, it is predicted to skip
amino acid 413Q amino acid within a VWFA domain of
CPNEl, a genetically driven alternative splicing event that is
supported by ESTs. However, stronger signals in the region lie

within protein C-related genes (PROCR, EPCR.). Thus, whether
rs2425068 and CPNEl play a functional role in determining pro-
tein C level, or merely reflect linkage disequilibrium with other
functional variants remains unknown.

The variant rs11574358 (WRN, Sll33A) was identiﬁed in a
scan for cardiovascular disease, cancer or premature death and
pleiotropy among traits (Kulminski and Culminskaya, 2013).
Notably, this gene is mutated in the autosomal recessive
Werner syndrome, resulting in premature onset of age-related
diseases including cancer and CVD, with death by middle age
typically by myocardial infarction. The S1133 amino acid has
been shown to be phosphorylated during early embryonic
stem-cell differentiation (Rigbolt et al., 2011) as annotated in
UniProtKB. The S1133A change would abolish the phosphoser-
ine and potentially effect protein function.

The MAPT region at 17q21.31 has been associated with sev-
eral neurological movement disorder, Parkinson’s disease (PD)
(Do et al., 2011; Pankratz et al., 2009; Saad et al., 2011;
Simon-Sanchez et al., 2009; Spencer et al., 2011) and progressive
supranuclear palsy (PSP) (Hoglinger et al., 2011). The disease-
association signals are also located in one of the largest, common
polymorphic genomic inversion sites known in humans.
Attempts to characterize the function of variants in the region
have not arrived at a clear conclusion, with no known missense
variants. MAPT is an obvious candidate in the region since it
encodes the human tau protein. Studies of local eQTLs in differ-
ent brain anatomical regions have yielded controversial results,
possibly favoring control of speciﬁc MAPT isoform splicing
(Hoglinger et al., 2011; Majounie et al., 2013; Trabzuni et al.,
2012). Multiple, independent associations in the region have been
suggested (Hoglinger et al., 2011; Spencer et al., 2011). Notably,
one of the strongest variants in common to PD and PSP,
rs393152, is located in the intron of CRHRI, a gene adjacent
to MAPT which encodes a critical G—protein coupled receptor

that binds corticotropin—releasing hormone neuropeptides and
regulates a variety of neurohormonal processes.

Through annotation in GRASP we ﬁnd rs393152 encodes a
variant base in CRHR-I T I (also known as C17orf69) that under-
goes RNA editing in cerebellar tissue (Kiran et al., 2013). The
cerebellum is a key brain region in the control of motor activity.
The variant would induce a Y132C amino acid change in the
predicted protein CRHR-ITl, which may be expressed in cere-
bellum based on the RNA-editing results. Notably, the cerebellar
A-I editing, if truly valid, would also result in a Y132C change.
Delta-BLASTp search shows signiﬁcant matches to predicted
proteins in ﬁve other species: Pongo abelii (96% identity), Pan
troglodytes (95%), Pan paniscus (95%), Nomsascus leucogenys
(84%), Macaca fascicularis (83%). Notably, the 132 position
encodes a Cysteine in these other species, suggesting CRHR-
IT I may be a recent gene and the Tyrosine 132 amino acid a
human-speciﬁc sequence. This raises the new hypothesis that
CRHR-ITl may contribute to PD or PSP pathology, possibly
in addition to the role of MAPT, through either RNA editing or
amino acid differences at position 132 of the predicted protein.

3.6 Increased coverage of GWAS studies over NHGRI
catalog

Differences between GRASP and the NHGRI GWAS catalog
are summarized in Table 4. There were 245 studies included in
GRASP that were not found in the NHGRI catalog. One hun-
dred twenty nine of these studies did not meet one or more of the
NHGRI catalog for inclusion: mainly <100 000 SNPs tested
(n = 58 studies), gene expression eQTL studies (n = 48), no
SNP-speciﬁc results were reported (n = 11), paper was not
indexed in PubMed (n = 9), methylation QTL studies (n = 2)
and metabolomics QTL study (n = 1). The other 116 studies
appear to meet inclusion criteria and are presumed not to have

been identiﬁed for the NHGRI catalog due to differences in
search and review strategies. Twenty-four studies were present
in the NHGRI catalog but missing in GRASP. Of these 22 were
excluded based on our criteria and two were not found presum-
ably due to search and review strategies (Fellay et al., 2010;
Karunas et al., 2011).

3.7 Increased coverage of GWAS results over NHGRI
catalog

GRASP contained 76-, 78- and 851-fold greater numbers of re-
sults than the NHGRI catalog at the respective thresholds of
P 3 5E— 8, P< lE— 5 and P g 0.05. This enrichment of results
persisted but was attenuated substantially when eQTL, methyla-
tion QTL and metabolomics QTL studies were removed (13-, 14-
and 753-fold at P 3 5E— 8, P<1E— 5 and P g 0.05, respect-
ively), and after further removal of the MHC class-II region
on chr 6p21.3 (11-, 12— and 770-fold at P§5E— 8, P<1E— 5
and P g 0.05, respectively). The results indicate an enrichment of
results in GRASP over the NHGRI catalog across the spectrum
of signiﬁcance levels.

3.8 Conclusions and future directions

Access to prior GWAS results is an important tool to modern
genetic and molecular biology researchers and may facilitate
many avenues of research. Estimates based on prior GWAS
and models of increased future marker coverage indicate the
GWAS approach is likely to continue to yield a large harvest
of new insights (Lindquist et al., 2013). A number of GWAS
results catalogs and database exist and each has unique design
features which make the breadth of resources collectively more
valuable. Beyond generating new research hypotheses, we ﬁnd
these GWAS resources (e.g. GRASP, NHGRI GWAS catalog,
GWAS3D, DistiLD, Ricopili) can be useful to establish the nov-
elty of results, identify potential collaborators with similar
phenotype and genotype data, quickly ﬁnd citations in a particu-
lar phenotype domain, or identify phenotype areas of opportun-
ity that have not been adequately studied in GWAS. Updating
GRASP is labor-intensive, necessitating a lag behind updates to
other resources such as the NHGRI GWAS catalog. Work on
updates to GRASP is ongoing with future releases and add-
itional annotation planned, including addition of sequencing-

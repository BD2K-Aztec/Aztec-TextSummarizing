ABSTRACT

Summary: Local opening of the DNA double helix is required in many
fundamental biological processes and is, in part, controlled by the
degree of superhelicity imposed in vivo by the protein machinery. In
particular, positions of superhelically destabilized regions correlate
with regulatory sites along the genome. Based on a self-consistent
linearization of a thermodynamic model of superhelical DNA intro-
duced by Benham, we have developed a program that predicts the
locations of these regions by efficiently computing base-pair and
bubble opening probabilities in genomic DNA. The program allows
visualization of results in standard genome browsers to compare
DNA opening properties with other available datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many key biological processes like transcription or replication
require the local opening of double-helical DNA. Under physio-
logical conditions, most base-pairs are double-stranded, but tran-
sient melting or unwinding of bubbles can occur spontaneously at
speciﬁc locations along the genome (Adamcik et al., 2012;
Kowalski and Eddy, 1988).

In vivo, the double helix of DNA is mechanically constrained
by protein machineries, imposing generally a negative super-
helical stress to DNA with a typical superhelical density of
about —0.06 in bacteria. This tendency to underwind DNA glo-
bally destabilizes the double helix, which might result in changes
in the local physicochemical DNA features, like, for example, the
binding constants of transcription enzymatic complexes
(Schneider et al., 2000). It is therefore believed that highly
destabilized regions in the sequence might be related to regula-
tory sites. Over the past 20 years, based on a thermodynamic
model of superhelical DNA introduced by Craig Benham
(Benham, 1992), it has been shown that these strongly stress-
induced duplex destabilized regions signiﬁcantly correlate with
yeast origin of replications (Ak and Benham, 2005) or promoter
regions in bacteria (Jost et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2004).
Such observed correlations suggest that information on the

local opening properties of DNA could drive the identiﬁcations
and annotations of putative regulatory regions in genomes.

Nine years ago, Bi and Benham developed the web server
WebSIDD (Bi and Benham, 2004) that predicts the destabiliza-
tion properties of genomic DNA in response to superhelical
stress. However, the systematic use of this tool to genome-wide
analysis of DNA local melting is highly limited by important
computation times that restrict the use of the server to sequences
<10 000 bp. Recently, we have developed a computationally efﬁ-
cient self-consistent linearization of the Benham model (J ost
et al., 2011) that allows the prediction of position-dependent
opening properties of entire genomes within minutes on a
personal computer.

Here, we describe Twist-DNA, a novel freely available open
source program that computes local base-pair and bubble open-
ing probabilities of superhelical DNA, under any given tempera-
ture, ionic condition or superhelical stress density. In particular,
it reads generic sequence ﬁles in FASTA format and provides
output ﬁles in BED format that can be loaded into genome
browsers to compare destabilization properties of genomic
DNA with existing annotations or available datasets.

2 METHODS

Local opening of DNA base-pairs is described by a thermodynamic
model of DNA under superhelical stress that couples the standard
thermodynamic description of base-pairing with the torsional stress en-
ergetics (Benham, 1992). In this model, the free energy of a given DNA
conﬁguration is decomposed into sequence-dependent pairing and stack-
ing free energies of closed base-pair steps, free energy penalties for the
nucleation of bubbles (unpaired regions) and an effective non-local elas-
tic-free energy accounting for torsional constraints on denatured and
double-stranded DNA regions. All thermodynamic parameter values
used in the model have been derived from experimental measurements
(see Supplementary Table). It has to be noted that the present model
neglects the writhe contribution to the superhelical density. This might
lead to overestimating the opening of the double helix (Adamcik et al.,
2012, Bar et al., 2012).

Resolution of the model is achieved by a self-consistent approximation
that conserves the global coupling between the melting of all base-pairs,
imposed by the superhelical constraint. Our approach allows the use of
the efﬁcient transfer-matrix method and the computation of position-
dependent opening properties of base-pairs and bubbles along genomes.
Although this approximation neglects some non-linear and ﬁnite-size
effects arising from the non-local elastic free energy contribution that
might be relevant for short sequences, it gives results in excellent agree-
ment with the full resolution of the model and speeds up the computation
by more than 1000-fold compared with the alternative approximate
method used by WebSIDD.

the UCSC Microbial Genome Browser (Schneider et al., 2005) for the genomic region 310—320 kbp. Base-pair opening probabilities signiﬁcantly correlate
with the GC-content. Bubbles are mainly localized in regulatory regions upstream of start codons

A detailed description of the model, the parameters and the computa-
tion methods can be found in J ost et al. (2011).

3 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM
3.1 Inputs and outputs

Twist-DNA allows the modiﬁcation of several input parameters
that directly inﬂuence the DNA denaturation: the superhelical
density a, the temperature T and the salt concentration [Na+].

The program reads DNA sequences in the standard FASTA
format and for each position along the sequence, it computes the
individual base-pair opening probability as well as the opening
probabilities of bubbles of given lengths centered at this position.
As superhelical stress is a global constraint, local melting proper-
ties depend on the whole input sequence. Thus, when studying
a particular DNA region, the user has to be cautious about
the window size taken around the investigated sequence.

As outputs, Twist-DNA produces ﬁles in BED format (with
bedGraph track) that can be loaded into standard genome brow-
sers: one containing the individual base-pair opening probabil-
ities (in loglo-unit) and the other containing the list of bubbles
(start and end) whose opening probabilities are higher than
a user-deﬁned threshold. For example, Figure 1 shows typical
stability proﬁles obtained for the genome of Escherichia
coli under physiological conditions (a: —0.06, T: 37°C,
[Na+] 20.1 M) Visualized using the UCSC microbial genome
browser (Schneider et al., 2005).

3.2 Implementation and performance

The source codes are written in F ortran90 and require a fortran
compiler. The program has been tested to work on Unix-based
operating systems (Linux and Mac OS X) using GNU compiler
gfortran or Intel compiler ifort, and contains testing routines to
check up its efﬁciency under the user’s computer. Additional
independent tests may be performed by the user with the proﬁles
provided in the Supplementary Data.

The computing time linearly depends on the size of the DNA
sequence and on the number of bubble sizes to investigate. For
example, on a 2.66-GHz Intel Core 2 Duo PC, for the E.c0li

genome (4.6 Mbp) and 1000 bubble sizes, the program runs
about 1min to compute the base-pair opening probabilities
and then runs about 15min to estimate the bubble opening
probabilities.

3.3 Example

Several bacterial genomes (including E.c0li and Bacillus subtilis)
were analyzed using Twist-DNA (see Supplementary Data) and
compared with corresponding results for random sequences
of same length and GC-content (Jost et al., 2011). Genomic
sequences are more destabilized with less but longer bubbles,
and the DNA breathing localizes into large AT-rich regions. In
particular, these metastable bubbles are mainly situated in the
neighborhood upstream of transcriptional start sites and start
codons (see Fig. 1) where transcription factors and RNA poly-
merases bind to DNA.

4 CONCLUSION

Twist-DNA is a fast and accurate program to compute base-pair
opening probability proﬁles and the list of transiently opened
bubbles along any speciﬁc genome for any user-speciﬁed condi-
tions of temperature, salt concentration and superhelicity. Based
on observed correlations between thermodynamically destabi-
lized regions and regulatory sites, Twist-DNA can be used to
discover novel properties of the regulation machineries. It can
also be helpful during the design of DNA sequences or plasmids
to test for example, whether speciﬁc regions are open or closed
under the desired experimental condition.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Rare copy number variations (CNVs) are frequent causes
of genetic diseases. We developed a graphical software package
based on a novel approach that can consistently identify CNVs of all
types (homozygous deletions, heterozygous deletions, heterozygous
duplications) from exome-sequencing data without the need of a
paired control. The algorithm compares coverage depth in a test
sample against a background distribution of control samples and
uses principal component analysis to remove batch effects. It is
user friendly and can be run on a personal computer.

Availability and implementation: The main scripts are implemented
in R (2.15), and the GUI is created using Java 1.6. It can be run on all
major operating systems. A non-GUI version for pipeline implementa-
tion is also available. The program is freely available online:

1 INTRODUCTION

Many sporadic and Mendelian disorders are caused by exonic
mutations that alter the amino acid sequence of the affected
gene. Exome sequencing has so far shown great utilty in eluci-
dating single nucleotide mutations that contribute to these dis-
eases. However, using exome sequencing to detect rare copy
number variations (CNVs) that contribute to diseases remain a
challenge.

We developed FishingCNV, a graphical software package for
comprehensive analysis of CNVs in exome—sequencing data. We
included a matched case/control analysis feature adapted from
ExomeCNV, but more importantly, we implemented a new CNV
detection algorithm that prioritizes rare variants for non-
matched sample analysis. Many sequencing centers have by
now accumulated large internal sets of exome samples that can
be used as controls for CNV detection in new unmatched sam-
ples. Our method relies on pooling such a control set, comparing
the exonic read depth of the test sample against the distribution
of read depths in the control set. To remove batch-to—batch vari-
ations in the control set, we applied principal component analysis
(PCA) and removed the top contributing principal components

(~2—10) from the data. We bundled GATK (McKenna et al.,
2010) into our program to extract coverage information. Read
depth information is then converted to Reads Per Kilobase per
Million mapped reads (RPKM) (Mortazavi et al., 2008), and the
test sample is segmented into regions of similar RPKM ratios
using circular binary segmentation (CBS) before comparison
against the control distribution (Olshen et al., 2004). The
output is a file that contains segmented CNV calls ranked by
statistical conﬁdence (See Supplementary Materials for details on
method). We tested our algorithm on simulated and actual
exome data and show that it is effective in identifying homozy-
gous as well as heterozygous CNVs of varying length. We also
show that principal component removal is effective in reducing
false positives. A summary of the program workflow is presented
in Figure 1. We compared our algorithm against ExomeCNV
(Sathirapongsasuti et al., 2011) and Conifer (Krumm et al.,
2012) and show that FishingCNV consistently outperforms pre-
vious approaches (See Supplementary Materials for data).

2 RESULTS

2.1 Simulation and performance

We created test files with presumably no CNVs by averaging the
RPKM values of a subset of samples from the control set. In
each file, we simulated heterozygous deletions, heterozygous
duplications and homozygous deletions of length 1 exon, 2
exons, 5 exons and 10 exons by changing the RPKM data
within the file. An FDR-adjusted P—value of 0.05 was used as
the threshold of detection. Our results show that our algorithm is
effective in detecting homozygous deletions, as well as heterozy-
gous deletions and duplications at the resolution of a single exon
(See Supplementary Materials). Sensitivity increases as the size of
the affected locus increases. Homozygous CNVs are detected
with higher sensitivity.

We compared our algorithm against ExomeCNV
(Sathirapongsasuti et al., 2011) and Conifer (Krumm et al.,
2012) using the same simulated dataset. We show that
ExomeCNV is not effective in detecting heterozygous variants
or larger sized CNVs and Conifer is unsuccessful when CNVs
are small (one to two exons long), but FishingCNV performed
well for all CNV types and lengths. The performance of
Conifer for larger sized CNVs is similar to FishingCNV.
Overall, FishingCNV outperforms previous approaches to
CNV detection.

2.2 CNV detection—two validated examples

We tested our program on two patients suffering from
metaphyseal dysplasia with maxillary hypoplasia and brachydac-
tyly (MDMHB), and it identified a 4 exon ampliﬁcation span-
ning SUPT3H and RUNX2 as the sixth most confident call
(P< 1.06e-ll). This CNV was verified as the causal variant in
a previous study (Moffatt et al., 2013).

In addition, we analyzed a sample from a study on mandibu-
lofacial dysostosis with microcephaly (MFDM), which was pre-
viously shown to harbor a deleterious heterozygous deletion in
the last 9 exons of the EFT UD2 gene (Lines et al., 2012). The
known deletion was the highest ranked call produced by our
algorithm, with a P—value of 4.38e-l2. FishingCNV determines
it to be a 12 exons long deletion that spans the last 9 exons of
EFT UD2 and the first 3 exons of the neighboring gene HIGDIB.

The analysis of the MFDM illustrates some of the problems
that may be encountered in real-life analysis. We note that the
MFDM sample is an outlier, as identified by PCA, and produces
many more CNV calls than is expected. However, our results
demonstrate the power of our approach because after the rank-
ing of CNV calls according to the P—values (even in cases where
the normal approximation does not hold well), the true variants
can be identified within the top ranking calls, despite the non-
ideal input.

3 CONCLUSION

We believe that looking for rare CNVs in exome-sequencing data
can be a powerful way of detecting new disease-causing muta-
tions. Until now, efforts on this front have been largely limited
by the computational tools available to us, but here we presented
a new graphical software package for easy detection of CNVs
and showed that it is effective in identifying causal CNVs in rare
diseases. This program should have vast applications in genomics

research, and will aid in the ever-expanding scientiﬁc efforts to
identify the genetic causes of rare diseases, such as the Finding of
Rare Disease Genes in Canada (FORGE) and Rare Disease
Consortium for Autosomal Loci (RaDiCAL) projects.

Abstract

Summary: Several approaches to the region-based association analysis of quantitative traits have
recently been developed and successively applied. However, no software package has been de-
veloped that implements all of these approaches for either independent or structured samples.
Here we introduce FREGAT (Family REGional Association Tests), an R package that can handle
family and population samples and implements a wide range of region-based association methods
including burden tests, functional linear models, and kernel machine-based regression. FREGAT
can be used in genome/exome-wide region-based association studies of quantitative traits and
candidate gene analysis. FREGAT offers many useful options to empower its users and increase
the effectiveness and applicability of region-based association analysis.

1 Introduction

The development of new and effective whole-exome and whole-genome
resequencing technologies demands the establishment of powerful and
computationally efficient statistical methods to test the associations be-
tween rare variants and complex traits. The methods developed for the
analysis of common variants are underpowered because of the small
number of observations for any given variant (Eichler et al., 2010). The
statistical power of the association analysis of rare variants is expected
to increase when genetic variants in a region of interest are tested simul-
taneously rather than separately (Eichler et al., 2010).

Several approaches to the region-based association analysis of
quantitative traits have been developed and successively applied in
practice. The simplest approach uses various methods for collapsing
rare variants within a region of interest (burden tests). In this case, a
set of rare variants in a region is described by a single genetic vari-
able that is then tested for association (Dering et al., 2011). Other

approaches wherein genotype effects are estimated as fixed effects
are based on the multiple regression model, especially on its func-
tional data analysis-based version (functional linear models, FLMs)
(Fan et al., 2013, 2014). An alternative approach treats the regional
association as a random effect and employs kernel machine-based
regression (i.e. sequence kernel association tests, SKAT and SKAT-
O) (Kwee et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2011).

Each of these methods has their own advantages and limitations.
All have been adopted for pedigree samples (Belonogova et al., 2013;
Chen et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2015; Oualkacha et al., 2013; Schifano
et al., 2012; Svishcheva et al., 2014, 2015). However, no software
package has yet been developed that implements all of these popular
approaches for handling population or family samples. We developed
the Family REGional Association Tests (FREGAT) package, an R
package that can handle population and family samples and imple-
ments a wide range of region-based association methods including

burden tests, FLMs, and kernel machine-based regression. FREGAT
can be used for the genome/exome-wide association studies of quanti-
tative traits and offers many useful options to increase the effective-
ness and applicability of region-based association analysis.

2 Implementation

In FREGAT, the inheritance of a quantitative trait in the sample of
n genetically related individuals is described by the linear mixed
model as y =Xor + r+ g+ a, where y denotes the n X 1 vector of
phenotypes; X represents the n X p matrix of p covariates; a is the
p X 1 vector of the regression coefficients of the covariates; g and a
are the n X 1 vectors of random polygenic and environmental effects,
respectively; r is the n X 1 vector of effects of the analyzed region
modeled as either random or fixed variables depending on the
chosen method. For family samples, vector g is assumed to be dis-
tributed as N (0, ZogzK), where K is the n x n kinship matrix, and ogz
is the variance component that models within-family correlations; a
N N(0, 0621"), where In is the n x n identity matrix and 062 is the
variance component of random errors. All FREGAT methods as-

2 and 062 are estimated once for each trait

sume that parameters or, 0g
under the null model (r: 0). This step is similar for all methods (Fig.
1). Within the package, the null model estimates obtained in the first
run can be saved and reused in all subsequent runs for the same trait.
This feature increases the analysis speed because the parameter esti-
mation under the null model can be computationally intensive, par-
ticularly in large samples. If the kinship matrix is not set, the
program does not include within-family correlations in the linear
mixed model and individuals are treated as unrelated.

Comparison with native implementations demonstrates that calcu-
lations are correct for all FREGAT methods (Supplementary Figures
51 and S2). Run times are comparable with those of the fastest exist-
ing programs, with SKAT-O and FLM methods in FREGAT being the
fastest among available implementations (Supplementary Table 51).
The run time of fitting the null model has cubic dependence on sample
size, while the run times of the association tests exhibit quadratic or
slower growth with the sample size and region size (Supplementary
Figures S3 and S4). All tests are fast enough to perform a whole-
exome region-based association study of a large structured sample in
a reasonable time even on a single processor. Parallel calculations are
enabled by foreach and doParallel R packages (Calaway et al.,
2015a,b) and increase the speed of large analyses on multi-core ma-
chines. FREGAT can accept genotypic data stored as snp.data class to
enhance memory usage (Aulchenko et al., 2007), but such data will
not be processed as raw data. For VCF and PLINK binary input files,
functions from seqminer (Zhan and Liu, 2015) and snpStats (Clayton,
2015 ) R packages are used to read them gene-wise. The run time of
the null model step is significantly improved compared with the
FFBSKAT package (Svishcheva et al., 2014).

All FREGAT methods support covariates, sliding window ana-
lysis and non-additive models. FREGAT can be used to analyze a

For each method, FREGAT offers an extensive list of options for an
informative and ﬂexible analysis. Kernel-based tests allows the assign-
ment of different kernel functions (e.g. linear, quadratic and identity-
by-state (IBS)-based) and estimation of P values by using either Davies’
or Kuonen’s methods. It also provides an option to estimate the propor-
tion of variance explained by region (see details in Supplementary
Materials). Arbitrary weight functions can be used in burden tests and
kernel machine-based regression. FLMs within FREGAT consider all
known analytical issues of this relatively novel approach to simplify cal-
culations and improve the interpretability of the results.

Abstract

Motivation: The establishment of quantitative gene regulatory networks (qGRNs) through existing
network component analysis (NCA) approaches suffers from shortcomings such as usage limita—
tions of problem constraints and the instability of inferred qGRNs. The proposed GeNOSA frame—
work uses a global optimization algorithm (OptNCA) to cope with the stringent limitations of NCA
approaches in large—scale qGRNs.

Results: OptNCA performs well against existing NCA—derived algorithms in terms of utilization of
connectivity information and reconstruction accuracy of inferred GRNs using synthetic and real
Escherichia coli datasets. For comparisons with other non—NCA—derived algorithms, OptNCA with—
out using known qualitative regulations is also evaluated in terms of qualitative assessments using
a synthetic Saccharomyces cerevisiae dataset of the DREAM3 challenges. We successfully demon—
strate GeNOSA in several applications including deducing condition—dependent regulations, estab—
lishing high—consensus qGRNs and validating a sub—network experimentally for dose—response
and time—course microarray data, and discovering and experimentally confirming a novel regula—
tion of CRP on AscG.

1 Introduction

 

In systems biology, inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) has
focused on identifying effective mathematical models that accurately
depict the variation of gene expressions through the use of mathem—
atical equations (Marbach et 61]., 2012). In these equations, the val—
ues of model parameters are estimated through the use of
microarray technologies and biological domain knowledge of con—
nectivity information from customized biological experiments
(Cooke et 61]., 2009; di Bernardo et 61]., 2005) and reliable databases
[e.g. RegulonDB (Gama—Castro et 61]., 2011) and EcoCyc (Keseler

et 61]., 2013)] remains challengeable (Marbach et 61]., 2012). The gen—
eral procedure for reconstructing GRNs is illustrated in Figure 1.
Various microarray experiments are conducted for some control fac—
tors, such as knockout, drug treatment or overexpression, to investi—
gate biological functions using gene expression analysis. To
accurately reconstruct GRNs from multiple microarray profiles of
dose—response or time—course data, prior connectivity information
from public databases of considered species (e.g. RegulonDB and
EcoCyc for Escherichia coli) that decreases the number of regulations
to be estimated is used to reduce the solution space for inferring

GRNs. Once the mathematic model of the GRN is established, one
can deduce and analyze interested regulation through qualitative as—
sessments regardless of regulatory roles as either activation or repres—
sion in GRNs. Qualitative GRNs have been inferred by numerous
methods (Marbach et al., 2012) but quantitative analysis and further
experimental support is still lacking (Bourdon et al., 2011; Dybas
et al., 2008). Quantitative GRNs have been widely investigated since
Pan et al. (2007) proposed an approach for inferring GRNs with
quantitative transcription rates and realistic descriptions of how a
gene’s regulators inﬂuence its expression level. Quantitative regulation
information can help biologists reveal hidden knowledge in compli—
cated and large—scale GRNs (Bar—Joseph et al., 2012).

The network component analysis (NCA) approach is a well—
known model—based decomposition method for inferring GRNs to de—
duce valuable information related to the transcription factor activity
(TFA) and control strength (CS) of TF—gene connectivity networks
(Liao et al., 2003). TFA is defined as the concentration of its subpopu—
lation capable of DNA—binding domains (Chang et al., 2008; Kao
et al., 2004) and is difficult to measure experimentally owing to the
post—transcriptional and post—translational modifications (Chang
et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2005). Estimating the quantities of TFAs pro-
vides a basis for investigating perturbations caused by drug effects,
genetic mutations, over—expression or complex environmental chal-
lenges. The linear model of NCA is described in Eq. (1) where the
levels of gene expression are determined by CS and TFA, respectively,
represented using the matrices [A] and [P] (Liao et al., 2003),

[El = IAIIPI + [Fl (1)

The values in the matrix [E] (size M X T) are the log ratios of ex—
pression values of M genes and T time points measured using micro—
array technology under specific conditions. The connectivity matrix
[A] (size M x N) is composed of the regulation between M genes
and N TFs, and the matrix [P] (size N X T) represents activities of
the N TFs on T time points. The matrix [F] represents the measure—
ment noise or other factors that inﬂuence gene expression but are
not directly related to this linear model. The NCA—derived algo—
rithms must obey the three identifiability criteria serving as con—
straints (Chang et al., 2008; Liao et al., 2003; Tran et al., 2010): (i)
the matrix [A] must have full—column rank; (ii) any subset of the ma—
trix [A] still has full-column rank and (iii) the matrix [P] must have
full—row rank to uniquely decompose the matrix [E] into matrices
[a] and [p] by minimizing the matrix [F] through the following
objective function (Liao et al., 2003).

131;; r: IIIEI — [41221112, w. [a] e 20 <2)

The set Z0 is the topologies induced by the network connectivity
pattern. The inputs of the NCA—derived algorithms are the matrices

[E] and [A] given from gene expression profiles and connectivity in—
formation, respectively. The outputs are the values in the matrices
[a] and [p]. To satisfy the three criteria, some valuable connectivity
information (such as the known TF—gene regulations) and some TFs
and genes in the GRN of interest would be ignored.

The existing NCA algorithm (Liao et al., 2003) adopts a two—
step iterative method to satisfy the three aforementioned criteria,
but the obtained solution has two shortcomings: (i) the method
adopts a local search methodology (Chang et al., 2008; Tran et al.,
2005) and (ii) the solution is computationally instable depending on
initial values in matrix [A] (Chang et al., 2008; Galbraith et al.,
2006; Tran et al., 2005). The subsequently developed NCA algo—
rithm incorporating the Tikhonov regularization method (Tikhonov
and Arsenin, 1977) can improve the numerical sensitivity induced
by the ill—conditioned matrices. However, the existing NCA—derived
algorithms cannot estimate so many TFAs due to insufficient tran—
scriptome data points in the third criterion. Hence, an enhanced ver—
sion of the NCA algorithm revises the third criterion, thus relaxing
the theoretical data point limitation (Galbraith et al., 2006). The
NCA algorithm with the revised third criterion and Tikhonov regu—
larization is named NCAr in this work. However, the third criterion
is difficult to meet because a single gene can be regulated by a large
number of TFs in higher eukaryotes (Tran et al., 2010). Therefore,
the NCA—derived algorithms have to prune some TFs and genes in
the original GRN of interest to make the GRN NCA—complaint and
thus yield a unique solution. Therefore, the trimming schema was
used to extend the applicability of the NCA model to the realm of
mammalian regulatory network analysis (Tran et al., 2010). In add—
ition, FastNCA (Chang et al., 2008), non—iterative NCA (NI—NCA;
Jacklin et al., 2012), and ROBNCA (Noor et al., 2013) focused on
improving the efficiency of matrix decomposition in the NCA model
when applied to large—scale GRNs. ROBNCA was more accurate
than FastNCA and NI—NCA, irrespective of varying noise, correl—
ation and/or amount of outliers for synthetic datasets (Noor et al.,
2013). Numerous studies have successfully used the NCA approach
for qualitative GRNs reconstruction, although the NCA algorithms
are still subject to limitations in the matrix [A] (Misra and Sriram,
2013; Shao et al., 2012; Tran et al., 2010, 2012; Ye et al., 2009)
and instability in the matrix [P] with insufficient connectivity infor-
mation (Chang et al., 2008; Misra and Sriram, 2013; Noor et al.,
2013; Ye et al., 2009). Theoretically, the inferred GRNs using
existing NCA—derived algorithms need to be further refined by
biologists and confirmed through biological knowledge and empir-
ical evidence.

This work proposes a framework (named Gene Networks via
Orthogonal Simulated Annealing, GeNOSA) for inferring quantita-
tive GRNs from multiple microarray profiles of dose—response or
time—course data using a global optimization algorithm (named
OptNCA). OptNCA bases on orthogonal simulated annealing
(OSA) and the best use of prior knowledge for the initial setting of
the connectivity matrix [A] without matrix reduction to confine the
solution space of the decomposition problem of the NCA model
(Fig. 2). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in
several respects. First, we adopt NCA—compliant datasets (Liao
et al., 2003) as benchmarks and show that OptNCA is superior to
existing NCA—derived algorithms in terms of the true network in sil-
ico. Moreover, OptNCA without using known qualitative regula—
tions is also evaluated in terms of qualitative assessments using one
of the widely used datasets of DREAM3 challenges. Second, we
show the good quality of the inferred GRNs using GeNOSA to de—
duce condition—dependent regulations of a CRP—regulated GRN.
Third, we apply GeNOSA to establish quantitative GRNs from

theoretical use in the reverse engineering of quantitative GRNs but
also can be practically applied in real—world GRNs.

2 Methods

2.1 Proposed algorithm OptNCA

The performance of the OptNCA algorithm benefits mainly from
the optimization algorithm OSA and available information of TF-
gene regulation. According to the NCA model with knowing quali-
tative regulation, we encode the solution representation and design
an objective function to make the best use of OSA. The initial setting
of the matrix [A] uses known regulation between genes and TFs col—
lected from the literature and existing databases for E. coli, such as
RegulonDB (Gama—Castro et al., 2011) and EcoCyc (Keseler et al.,
2013). The initial values of variables in the matrix [A] are one of the
four values 1, —1, 0 and 99, respectively, representing up regulation,
down regulation, no regulation and unknown regulation. The zero
values in the matrix [A] remain unchanged and the corresponding
variables are not encoded into the solution representation. The mag—
nitude of the variables with initial values of 1 and —1 are tuned
using OSA without changing their signs. If the recorded regulation
of a variable in the matrix [A] is dual, the variable is assigned with
an initial value of 99 and can be positive or negative real values in
the feasible range optimized by OSA. The setting of variable ranges
in matrices [A] and [P] depends on the given matrix [E] with prior
knowledge or problem—specific constraints. Since the values in the
matrix [P] for real profiles are difficult to measure directly by biolo—
gical experiments, we assume the variables in the matrix [P] have
real values in the range of [—1, 1] unless specified otherwise, and
these values (representing the relative activities of TFs in log ratio
for different phrases) are initialized with zero. The reconstruction of
a GRN is formulated as an optimization problem where the least
square error (LSE) between the experimental and estimated gene ex—
pressions is minimized as in the objective function Eq. (2) originally
proposed by Liao et al. (2003). OptNCA aims to obtain accurate
signs of variables with dual regulations and magnitudes of variables

in matrices [a] and [p] using an efficient optimization approach
while considering noisy gene expressions. The OptNCA algorithm
using OSA aims to find a nearly optimal solution to the large—scale
optimization problem. The values in matrices [a] and [p] are ob—
tained from decoding a current solution of OSA. The OSA used in
OptNCA is described below.

There are three essential parts to be specified before performing
the procedure of OSA to solve this optimization problem using the
NCA model: (i) representation of a solution, (ii) objective function
and (iii) cooling schedule. Generally, the cooling schedule in OSA
consists of four parameters: (i) the temperature T, (ii) the cooling
rate CR, (iii) the search radius R and (iv) the S number of steps for
each temperature. The proper values of parameters are problem—de—
pendent using OptNCA. Let X be a candidate solution consisting of
all variables in matrices [a] and [p].

1. Initialize a current solution X according to the initial settings of
variables in the NCA model and four parameters T, CR, R and S
of OSA. Let the count index C = 0.

2. Generate two temporary solutions X1 and X2 using X for
perturbation.

3. Divide X, X1 and X2 into a number of groups of variables and
apply the orthogonal experimental design (OED) with a three—
level orthogonal array to obtain a candidate solution Q which
is a potentially good combination of these variables’ values
(H0 at al., 2006).

4. Accept Q as the new X with probability P(Q):

1, if f(Q)S f(X)

P = _
(Q) mac—(X) Tﬂgl), if HQ) > 1‘00

(3)

5. Increase the value of C by one. If C < S go to step 2.
Multiply the values of T and R by CR and reset C to zero.
7. If a pre—speciﬁed stopping criterion is met (In this work, the vari-

S”

ance of the ﬁtness values is less than 10—4 over 50 iterations), de—
code X to obtain the solutions for matrices [a] and [p] and stop
the algorithm. Otherwise, go to step 2.

The matrix decomposition problem incorporated with the NCA
model for reconstructing large—scale GRNs is very intractable and is
subject to computational instability due to multiple local optima
(Chang et al., 2008; Tran et al., 2005). The three optimization meta—
heuristics, OSA, Intelligent evolutionary algorithm (IEA; H0 at al.,
2004) and Orthogonal particle swarm optimization (OPSO; H0
at al., 2008) based on OED are useful for solving large parameter
optimization problems. OSA is a single solution based metaheuris—
tic, and IEA and OPSO are population—based metaheuristics
(Boussaid et al., 2013). When the connectivity information is used
to substantially reduce a search space in inferring large GRNs, OSA
outperforms IEA and OPSO in a limited computation time that
benefits from a good initial solution. Considering the rapid increase
of available connectivity information accompanied with high-
throughput techniques and the proposed GeNOSA framework
for inferring large-scale GRNs, we adopt OSA in OptNCA. OSA
aims to escape local optima to find a globally optimal solution
(H0 at al., 2006).

2.2 Evaluation of inferred GRNs

Pursuing high quality of inferred GRNs requires an efficient compu—
tation method to obtain accurate values of matrices [A] and [P]. The
LSE error between the true and estimated profiles is commonly used
to evaluate the search ability of computation methods. However,

the quality of the mathematic model for GRNs cannot be assessed
by only LSE. A suitable measurement is needed to evaluate the
inferred models of GRN. The TFA for describing the regulation
strength (RS) between TFs and its target genes is time—variant or
dose—dependent. To provide a simple measurement for comparing
two inferred models of GRN, we summarize the TFAs of all time
points or doses. The value of RSmn defined in Eq. (4) illustrates
the RS of the nth TF to the mth gene over T experiments for each
TF-gene regulation.

The variables Am" and Pm respectively denote each value in matrices

 : m=1 1121 NZ 

 

where RSmn and RS’mn respectively denote the true and estimated
RS. The NZ is the total number of true TF—gene regulations with
non-zero RS. The Sign function returns one if the signs of true and
estimated values are different; otherwise it returns zero. We examine
the signs of RS s to assess the correctness of the inferred GRNs com—
pared to the high—trust regulation between TFs and genes. The
method of obtaining a low FPR value can help to identify a correct
TF—gene topological structure to justify unknown or questionable
regulations from the literature or published databases.

2.3 Evaluation of dual regulation with adaptive
thresholds

Most of TF—gene interactions were condition—dependent meaning
that the regulatory roles of these TFs change with environmental
conditions (Brynildsen et al., 2006; Harbison et al., 2004; Tran
et al., 2010), thus increasing the difficulty of GRN reconstruction.
GeNOSA provides three comprehensive steps to deduce behaviors
of dual regulation for a specific condition. First, the inferred TFA
for these dual—regulatory genes must find a consensus of activity val—
ues with a low standard deviation in 30 independent runs of
OptNCA. Second, insignificantly expressed genes should be omitted
by determining adaptive thresholds of the summation of gene ex—
pression levels (ERS) and their standard deviation (ESD) over experi—
ments from microarray data. Third, two variables CS6",g and SC were
used thresholds to assess the correctness of the predicted regulation
of GeNOSA.

The variable Scam" is the large one of the two respective numbers of
activation and repression in the 30 CSs and the set ASmn consists of
a number Scam” of CSs within 30 independent runs of OptNCA. In
the microarray DR—cAMP, we used thresholds (IERSI > 1.0 and ESD
> 0.1 for at least 1—fold changes and low experimental variability
over dosages of expression levels, respectively) to filter out insignifi-
cantly expressed genes from microarray data, and then we reserved
highly consistent regulations with thresholds at |CSaUg| > 1.0 and SC
: 100% (Supplementary Dataset S2). Results show that highly reli-
able regulation depends on the thresholds determined in these three

steps. Hence, dual regulations with high confidence could be con—
firmed as activators or repressors under cAMP dosages by these

thresholds.

3 Results and discussion

Various datasets are designed to compare OptNCA with existing
NCA—derived algorithms by using LSE and FPR. The NCA (Liao
et al., 2003), NCAr (Tran et al., 2005), FastNCA (Chang et al.,
2008), NI-NCA (Jacklin et al., 2012), ROBNCA (Noor et al., 2013)
and NARROMI (Zhang et al., 2013) algorithms are freely available
from their websites. The OptNCA parameters used in this work are
T: 1000, CR: 0.999, R = 0.05, and S: 1000. Because the non—
zero values in matrices [A] and [P] of these four synthetic datasets
have real values within the range [—10, 10], and NCA—derived algo—
rithms estimate solutions without retaining the sign of the values,
we set the variables with an initial value of 99 in the same range for
OptNCA.

3.1 Efficiency and accuracy comparisons among
NCA—derived algorithms and OptNCA

For the in silico experiments, we performed 30 independent runs
using NCAr, FastNCA, NI—NCA, ROBNCA and OptNCA with
four designed datasets (Section 1.1 of Supplementary Materials).
The results shown in Table 1 reveal that OptNCA is superior to all
the NCA—derived algorithms while considering the mean accuracies
of qualitative and quantitative regulations in terms of FPR and LSE,
respectively. Although FPRs of FastNCA and NI—NCA are lower
than those of NCAr in Table 1, LSEs of these two algorithms are
much higher than those of NCAr revealing that the values of quanti—
tative regulations do not approximate expression profiles perfectly.
It is better to consider both FPR and LSE simultaneously. In general,
NCAr is better than FastNCA, NI—NCA and ROBNCA considering
the three datasets (Kao_PNAS, Kao_Silico.R, and Kao_Silico.UR).
Hence, the results of NCAr and OptNCA are compared and ana—
lyzed further in detail. The values of LSE and FPR obtained using
OptNCA are substantially reduced for the real dataset Kao_PNAS.
Gaussian noises with levels of 5 and 10% were added to the expres—
sion profile [E] for Kao_PNAS. For matrices [A] and [P] we used the
same parameter settings, which are required to meet all the identifi-
ability criteria for the NCAr algorithm. The results show that
OptNCA outperforms NCAr in terms of accuracy and standard de—
viation for various noise levels.

We also compare OptNCA with NCAr using three synthetic
datasets based on the Kao_PNAS with known solutions. The values
of LSE and FPR obtained by OptNCA on Kao_Silico.R and
Kao_Silico.UR are 0.0003 i 0.00 and 68.12 i 7.39, and
0.43 i 1.31 and 0.00 i 0.00%, respectively. Considering the results
of NCAr (0.56 i 0.10 and 13656.1 : 0.00 for LSE, and
19.64 i 0.77 and 8.57 i 0.00% for FPR), OptNCA performs much
better than NCAr in terms of LSE and FPR. The high LSE causes
bias in quantitative analysis of inferred GRNs, and even FPR is low.
The comparable improvements of FPR with minimized LSE had
qualitative and quantitative impacts on the inferred GRNs. For the
synthetic dataset Silico_30 of an NCA—noncompliant network,
OptNCA can minimize LSE (0.0004 i 0.00) for approximating ex-
pression profiles. Although OptNCA can obtain a nearly optimal
solution to the NCA model decomposition problem defined in Eq.
(1), its FPR is as high as 23.28 i 4.20%. The result indicates that
best profile fitting cannot guarantee correctness of the inferred GRN
model, especially when the degree of freedom in the matrix [A] is

The mean i standard deviation (SD) is given for each measurement. The results obtained by OptNCA are better than those using NCAr, FastNCA, NI-NCA

substantially increased. OptNCA can use connectivity information
to decrease the degree of freedom in the matrix [A]. In conclusion,
OptNCA is more stable and finds better solutions than NCAr in
terms of LSE and FPR for these four datasets. Regarding the TFAs
estimated by OptNCA and NCAr for Kao_PNAS, the similarity of
the TFA profiles between these two algorithms is high except those
of CRP and NarL. The Pearson’s correlation coefficients (PCCs) for
CRP and NarL are 0.622 and 0.027, respectively.

OptNCA and NCAr were compared using Kao_Silico.R and
Kao_Silico.UR with known values in matrices [E], [A] and [P] for
advanced accuracy analysis. We analyzed the values in the matrix
[P] for these two datasets and found that the trends of TFAs are
similar in terms of both signs and magnitudes, but there are
only two exceptions from these two experiments (Supplementary
Fig. S1). The averaged PCCs for matrices [A] and [P] on both
Kao_Silico.R and Kao_Silico.UR using NCAr and OptNCA are as
high as 0.914 and 0.978 (Supplementary Table S1), respectively.
One exception is the TFA of NarL in that PCC: 0.634 for NCAr
and 1.000 for OptNCA on Kao_Silico.R (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Similarly, the other exception on Kao_Silico.UR is RpoE and its
TFA profile obviously exhibits an opposite trend (PCC: —0.999)
using NCAr while OptNCA has PCC: 1.000 (Supplementary Fig.
S1B and Dataset S1). In general, OptNCA and NCAr performed
well in estimating TFAs on Kao_Silico.R (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
However, NCAr obtained larger magnitudes of TFAs on
Kao_Silico.UR compared to the true TFAs. OptNCA with
PCC: 1.000 is substantially superior to NCAr with PCC:0.857
(Supplementary Fig. S1B and Dataset S1).

3.2 Comparisons with non—NCA—derived algorithms
Although OptNCA aims to utilize known qualitative regulations to
infer reliable quantitative GRNs (Fig. 2), OptNCA can also deduce
qualitative regulations by assigning initial values of 99 to variables
in the matrix [A]. In this work, the reference network Yeast1 from
the fourth challenge of DREAM3 (Marbach et al., 2010) was used
for further evaluation and comparison. Although these simulated
data sets likely exhibit properties that are different from real data, it
is instructive for evaluation as it is widely used in the literature on
network inference. To infer qualitative GRNs, the threshold value
of RS for discriminating the regulation from non—regulation is set to
0.1, 0.05 and 0.01 for the network sizes of 10, 50 and 100,
respectively.

The results of non—NCA—derived algorithms were obtained from
NARROMI (Zhang et al., 2013), as shown in Table 2. The follow—
ing measures, true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPoR),

characteristic curve (AUC), were used (Zhang et al., 2013). The
effectiveness of NARROMI (Zhang et al., 2013) was confirmed
through cross—validation results on various datasets suggesting that
NARROMI integrally outperformed previous non—NCA—derived
methods, such as LP (Wang et al., 2006), R0 (Zhang et al., 2013),
ARACNE (Margolin et al., 2006), GENIE3 (Huynh-Thu et al.,
2010) and LASSO (Geeven et al., 2012). However, performance of
these algorithms diverse according to measures and datasets used
(Zhang et al., 2013). OptNCA outperforms LASSO, LP and R0 in
the case of network size 10 in terms of TPR, FPoR, PPV, ACC and
MCC and performs well only in TPR and FPoR for the network size
of 50. The other non—NCA—derived algorithms outperform OptNCA
in deducing qualitative regulations on the two datasets.

OptNCA can infer regulatory roles (either activation or repres—
sion) of TFs. Therefore, we further utilized the qualitative regula—
tions of Yeast1 from the gold standard of DREAM3 to infer
quantitative GRNs. The error rates of predicted regulatory roles for
the network sizes of 10, 50 and 100 are 0, 23.5 and 28.9%, respect—
ively. OptNCA performs well in inferring small—scale quantitative
GRNs. Notably, no result of predicted regulatory roles on the same
datasets is available for the methods in Table 2.

3.3 Deduce behaviors of dual—regulatory genes of CRP
In the qualitative GRN CRP—ReDB72 (Section 2, Supplementary
Materials), there were 13 dual—regulations where 42 regulations
were regulated by CRP under some specific culture conditions.
Adaptive thresholds for evaluating dual regulation were used to
assess the deductive performance of OptNCA for the 42 CRP-
regulated genes from these dual regulations in the cAMP dose——
response microarray under aerobic growth conditions (DR—cAMP)
to reveal the regulatory roles of CRP within seven relative concen—
trations (Section 1.2, Supplementary Materials). First, the estimated
activity of CRP was stable over 30 independent runs of OptNCA,
and the averaged standard deviation for seven concentrations was
less than 0.04. This result suggested that the estimated activity of
CRP was highly consistent under this condition. The averaged PCC
between estimated values of CS and expression levels of genes in
seven cAMP concentrations was 0.788, indicating that the deduc—
tion substantially agreed with the experimental results. Second, in—
significantly expressed genes are rarely informative and we thus
obtained 21 significantly expressed genes for further analysis. Third,
we used a majority rule on the 30 estimated values of CS to deter—
mine the regulatory role of CRP on these 21 genes, and then calcu—
lated mean values considering the values of CS with consistent signs
for the regulatory role, which represent the fold change contributed
to gene expressions by the activity of CRP. Six deduction regulations
were correctly confirmed among the nine regulations with |CS| < 1,
and the other 12 deduction regulations with |CS|21 (greater than
1—fold change) were all correctly confirmed by analyzing gene
expression in the microarray DR—cAMP. The 12 genes with substan—
tially identified regulations are am], Cth, dadA, dadX, DgsA, MalI,
nagB, nagE, nup G, proP, tsx and udp (Supplementary Table S2).

3.4 Application to infer and validate quantitative GRNs
GeNOSA was used to reconstruct two quantitative GRNs for a
CRP—mediated network (CRP—ybiT) from the dose—responses (DR—
cAMP) and time—course (TC—IS) microarray data (Fig. 3A). We used
the qualitative regulation recorded in RegulonDB and the default
parameter settings for OptNCA in reconstructing the quantitative
GRNs. The regulation between CRP and AscG was initialized as an
unknown regulation. The estimation of gene expression values over
time and dosage were globally optimized through the cooperation of
the estimated CSs and TFAs using OptNCA. OptNCA was used to
conduct 30 independent runs of OSA to obtain two CRP—mediated
GRNs (Supplementary Fig. S2). The averaged mean squared errors
were 0.021 and 0.223, respectively, in approximating the gene ex-
pression profiles of DR—cAMP and TC—IS. Considering that the ex—
pression values of DR—cAMP and TC—IS were, respectively, in the
range of [—2.79, 6.60] and [—4.77, 4.70], OptNCA performed well
in fitting the expression profiles. Consequently, we want to further
validate the estimated TFAs.

For experimental validation, we randomly chose a small CRP—
regulated from all the sub—networks with the smallest regulation by
outer TFs on the target genes in the sub—network (Supplementary
Fig. S3). The sub—network consists of two genes (ascF and ybiT) and
their upstream TFs (CRP and AscG) from the qualitative CRP—medi—
ated GRN (Fig. 3A). The TFAs of CRP and AscG were estimated
from the expression profiles of their downstream genes that CRP
regulates 432 genes and AscG regulates three genes (ascG, ascF and
ybiT). By observing the expression levels of ascG, the self—regulation
of AscG was found to have occurred in the TC—IS but not DR—cAMP
dataset (Supplementary Dataset S2). The averaged standard devi—
ations of the estimated TFAs over 30 independent runs of OptNCA

were very small (0.0060 for CRP and 0.0092 for AscG) from DR-
cAMP dataset (Supplementary Fig. S4A). The expression profiles of
ascF and ybiT were perfectly estimated, and the trends of real and
estimated profiles of ascG were very similar (Supplementary Fig.
S4B). In the GRN inferred from TC—IS dataset, the averaged stand—
ard deviations of the estimated TFAs over 12 growth times were
0.0077 for CRP and 0.1059 for AscG (Supplementary Fig. S5A).
The TFA of AscG featured tolerable variance and the estimated ex—
pression profile of ascG was less accurate due to the self—regulation
(Supplementary Fig. S5B). The gene expression of self—regulation is
affected by many factors such as post—transcriptional regulation,
transcriptional regulation and other mechanisms. Furthermore, the
NCA model deals mainly with the transcriptional regulation only.
However, the estimated expression ratios of ascF and ybiT were still
accurate.

Consequently, we verified the results of those fold changes by
knocking out these two TFs for three concentrations (0.01, 0.1 and
1 mM) in DR-cAMP and five growth times in TC—IS by averaging
from three replicates of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR,
Supplementary Materials). The quantitative results of this sub—net—
work obtained using GeNOSA on the qualitative GRN CRP—ybiT
are shown along with the experimental validation results (Figs. 3B
and C). These two figures show the estimated TFAs of CRP and
AscG indicating that CRP activates AscG in both the DR—cAMP and
TC—IS microarray data. Furthermore, the PCC test indicated high
correlations of relative gene expressions between the qRT—PCR and
GeNOSA results for both the dose—responses and time—course data—
sets. The correlation coefficients (the two—tailed t—test P value) for
DR-cAMP and TC-IS are 0.85 (P = 6.9 X 10‘s) and 0.88
(P = 5.59 X 10_12 ), respectively (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).
The strength of association between the qRT—PCR and GeNOSA re—
sults is highly related and statistically significant from the null hy-
pothesis (P < 0.0001). Consequently, we can say that GeNOSA can
explain the coefficients of determination (72% in DR—cAMP and
77% in TC—IS) of variance in the result of qRT-PCR.

3.5 Experimental validations for the regulation of
CRP on AscG
The estimation results described in Section 3.3 show that CRP exerts
a strong regulation on AscG, shown in Figures 3B and C.
Experimental validations were used to confirm the novel regulation
of CRP on AscG. The in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays
(EMSA) for the CRP binding sites on ascG, ascF and ybiT genes
were shown in Figure 4A. The quantitative results obtained using
Zero—D software (Scanalytics, Billerica, MA) indicate that CRP
clearly retarded the migration of the ascF, ascG and ybiT oligo—
nucleotides (Fig. 4B) and CRP was responsible for the promoters of
ascF and ybiT in agreement with the regulation of CRP (Ishida
et al., 2009; Raghavan et al., 2011). Moreover, the CRP binding site
of ascG was recognized near positions ranging from —63 to —78 up—
stream of ascG with TGTGAAACCGGTCACC for the first time.
Therefore, a novel regulation between CRP and AscG is validated.
To clarify the effects of CRP regulation on ascG, ascF and ybiT,
wild—type and mutant strains (such as A617), AascG and AcrpAascG)
were grown to an exponential phase to detect the gene expressions
using qRT—PCR. The data from each mutant strain were normalized
against those for the 16S rRNA as a positive control. The results
show that the expressions of ascF and ascG were significantly re-
pressed in the A617) strain and slightly reduced in ybiT (Fig. 4C).
This result indicates that cAMP—CRP is an activator for ascF, ascG
and ybiT. In contrast, the gene expression of ascF was depressed in

double—mutant strain was further used to interpret the effects of the
two transcription regulators on gene expression of ascF and ybiT.
The result indicates that the expression patterns of ascF and ybiT in
the AcrpAascG double—mutant strain were similar to that of the
Acrp strain. This finding suggests that AscG exhibits a suppressive
effect and CRP is the dominant regulator for ascF and ybiT in re-
sponse to activation of gene expression.

4 Conclusion

This work proposes a complete framework GeNOSA to infer large—
scale, qGRNs using OptNCA based on the model of NCA. Using an

OSA algorithm, the proposed OptNCA can efficiently yield a good
solution to the decomposition problem without performing matrix
reduction. To obey the three identifiability criteria, existing NCA-
derived algorithms except OptNCA usually perform matrix reduc—
tion and ignore some genes and transcription factors of interest.
However, with prior knowledge of connectivity information from
the literature and existing databases, OptNCA can retain this
reliable connectivity information in inferring GRNs. The general-
purpose GeNOSA can quantitatively estimate CS and TFA as well
as discover novel regulations for specific conditions and applica—
tions. Estimating quantitative TFAs improves understanding of how
the physical states of cells respond to environmental changes and
elucidate the transcriptional architectures for various applications
such as drug design.

OptNCA performs well compared to existing NCA—derived algo—
rithms in terms of reliable connectivity information and reconstruc—
tion accuracy using synthetic and real E. coli datasets. Experimental
results indicate that GeNOSA can infer CRP—regulated GRNs to
quantitatively deduce condition—dependent and undiscovered regula—
tions. In the NCA model, the quantity of the activity of a TF mainly
depends on its target genes. By investigating the stability of a TFA
that targets on multiple genes, GeNOSA provides a solution to eluci—
date relative CS of TF—mediated genes and the dynamics of TFAs
(upper parts of Figs. 3B and C) for various dosages and time points.

While existing NCA—derived algorithms focus on approximating
expression profiles for GRN reconstruction with qualitative regula—
tion or quantitative regulation, GeNOSA aims to minimize a profile
approximation error while accurately identifying a topological
structure with quantitative regulation for efficiently establishing
large—scale GRNs. The framework GeNOSA consists of tools,
including generation of input files for OptNCA and optimization of
GRNs, to make the best use of connectivity information from the lit-
erature and regulation databases for time—course or dose—response

microarray datasets. We believe that GeNOSA could serve as a fun—
damental tool for estimating TFAs in the reverse engineering of
inferring quantitative GRNs and lead to the development of a rich
set of applications in the field of systems biology.

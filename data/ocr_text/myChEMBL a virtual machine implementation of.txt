ABSTRACT

Summary: myChEMBL is a completely open platform, which com-
bines public domain bioactivity data with open source database and
cheminformatics technologies. myChEMBL consists of a Linux
(Ubuntu) Virtual Machine featuring a PostgreSQL schema with the
latest version of the ChEMBL database, as well as the latest RDKit
cheminformatics libraries. In addition, a self-contained web interface is
available, which can be modified and improved according to user
specifications.

Availability and implementation: The VM is available at: ftp://ftp.ebi.
ac.uk/pub/databases/chembWM/myChEMBL/current. The web inter-
face and web services code is available at: https://github.com/
rochoa85/myChEMBL.

1 MOTIVATION

The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in the number of
informatics tools enabling the efﬁcient analysis of the large chem-
ical, biological and clinical datasets currently being produced by
both academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies in the
context of drug discovery ONegner et al., 2012). This was partly
catalyzed by the development of freely accessible repositories
containing expertly curated and annotated medicinal chemistry
and chemical biology data. For example, the ChEMBL database
is a public domain chemogenomics resource, which provides ex-
perimental data about the interactions between small molecules,
including approved drugs and clinical candidates, and speciﬁc
biological targets reported in the primary medicinal chemistry
literature (Gaulton et al., 2012). To facilitate the manipulation
of such structure—activity relationship data, the integration of
chemical information tools is required. These tools could then
be a part of larger data mining protocols. Currently, a limited
number of open source cheminformatics packages are available,
while, more importantly, few of them incorporate chemical
searching functionality using relational database architectures
(i.e. a chemistry cartridge). RDKit (RDKit, 2013) offers such
functionality within a PostgreSQL environment. Based on the
easy integration of these open tools and data, a Virtual
Machine was conﬁgured, and is ready to be used by both
expert users who can write and execute custom SQL queries,

and new users who can take advantage of a self-contained and
user-friendly interface.

2 DATABASE CONFIGURATION

2.1 ChEMBL data conﬁguration

The ChEMBL database was originally implemented as an Oracle
schema. In addition, a MySQL snapshot is generated and dis-
tributed with each new version of the database. However, owing
to RDKit’s requirements, a PostgreSQL version of ChEMBL
was also implemented using the tools provided by the Ora2Pg
project (http://ora2pg.darold.net/). The migration process was
exhaustively tested to avoid loss of information or undesired
changes over the data.

2.2 RDKit chemical cartridge functions

The RDKit chemical cartridge is written in C++ and, as a result,
its chemical search performance is scalable given the large
amount of structures currently stored in the ChEMBL database
(~1.2 million). With regard to the core functionality, the user can
execute chemical searches based on substructure and similarity.
In addition, the cartridge is capable of calculating physicochem—
ical properties for a given molecule, such as logP, molecular
weight and number of rings.

2.3 Database and virtual machine set up

Initially, three tables were added to the existing ChEMBL
schema. The first one contains the entire set of parent molecules
converted to the RDKit format and appropriately indexed, using
as input the original set of MDL Molﬁles (Dalby et al., 1992)
stored in the database. The second table contains several types of
molecular ﬁngerprints per compound. The third table contains
RDKit pre-generated depictions of the parent molecules stored
in the first additional table. Having conﬁgured the database, a
Virtual Machine was set up using the Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit oper-
ating system. It contains the latest ChEMBL PostgreSQL 9.1
schema with the aforementioned additions. The RDKit cart-
ridge, along with all its requirements, was compiled and installed
using the latest source code (version 2013-04). Moreover, docu-
mentation has been provided to aid and enhance the user experi-
ence. The VM can be easily imported using the freely available
VirtualBox application (https://www.virtualbox.org). The gen-
eral architecture is explained in Figure 1.

Fig. 1. General architecture of the myChEMBL Virtual Machine. The VM core consists of all the bioactivity and chemical data stored in the ChEMBL
database together with the cheminformatics tools provided by the RDKit chemical cartridge. Both are integrated through a PostgreSQL schema (version
9.1). All the protocols can be accessed using SQL queries, through a self-contained web interface or using RESTful web services. The basic usage needs as
input a valid molecule using in-line formats or through sketchers. The output formats will vary depending on the access route chosen by the user

3 myChEMBL ACCESS

After downloading and installing the Virtual Machine,
myChEMBL can be accessed in a number of ways. The user
has the option to directly execute SQL queries based on the
ChEMBL schema and the RDKit cartridge extensions.
Alternatively, the web interface provided with the VM can be
used locally. The ﬁnal option is to install the VM as a remote
web server, accessible to all users within an organization or pro-
ject team, thus taking advantage of both the web applications, as
well the web services provided.

3.1 Web application

A web-based application, developed using PHP, gives users
without any prior knowledge of SQL, the ability to run searches
against the myChEMBL system in a web browser. With regard
to the user input, the query structures can be represented in
three different formats. First, SMILES, which is the most
common in-line representation of small molecules (VVeininger,
1988). Second, MDL Molﬁles or SMARTS queries for more
advanced queries of chemical patterns; notably, the latter func-
tionality is not currently offered by the main ChEMBL web
interface (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/). Finally, the user has
the option to draw the structure query using the open source
sketcher J SME (Bienfait and Ertl, 2013), designed purely in
J avaScript code.

3.2 Web services

The web application also provides a set of RESTful Web
Services, which enable a user to programmatically access the
core functionality offered by the web application. For example,
the user can specify a similarity query through a URI format,
with the option to select the desired molecular format, choose
between a set of molecular ﬁngerprints and additionally select (in
the case of similarity searches) which similarity coefﬁcient wants
to be used for calculating the ﬁnal scores. The services can be
embedded in any programming language and workﬁow tools
with available libraries for manipulating URL and J SON

responses. A python client is provided with documented use
cases for all the current functionalities.

4 FURTHER WORK

The original aim of the myChEMBL project was to build an
open system, which would remove the technical burden of set-
ting up a cheminformatics infrastructure, making it easier for
users to interrogate in full the wealth of chemical and biological
data stored within the ChEMBL database. The ﬁrst release of
myChEMBL is primarily focused on exploring the chemical
space available within the ChEMBL database. Future func-
tionality may include combining structure searches with the
stored bioactivity data, to detect activity cliffs or matched mo-
lecular pairs in certain assays or biological targets. One of the
more exciting opportunities would be to fully expose the
ChEMBL data model, allowing users to load and curate their
own datasets. The availability of a completely free self-con-
tained version of ChEMBL (and a framework for loading
analogous data) will hopefully catalyze further innovation and
development in emerging economies, open innovation/commu-
nity projects, e.g. in areas such as malaria and tuberculosis
research. Finally, owing to the open philosophy of this project,
we encourage the community to provide feedback, new ideas
or code snippets, to enhance and improve the current
functionality.

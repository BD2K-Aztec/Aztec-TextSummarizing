ABSTRACT

Motivation: Conformational diversity is a key concept in the
understanding of different issues related with protein function such
as the study of catalytic processes in enzymes, protein-protein recog-
nition, protein evolution and the origins of new biological functions.
Here, we present a database of proteins with different degrees of
conformational diversity. Conformational Diversity of Native State
(CoDNaS) is a redundant collection of three-dimensional structures
for the same protein derived from protein data bank. Structures for
the same protein obtained under different crystallographic conditions
have been associated with snapshots of protein dynamism and con-
sequently could characterize protein conformers. CoDNaS allows the
user to explore global and local structural differences among confor-
mers as a function of different parameters such as presence of ligand,
post-translational modifications, changes in oligomeric states and
differences in pH and temperature. Additionally, CoDNaS contains
information about protein taxonomy and function, disorder level and
structural classification offering useful information to explore the
underlying mechanism of conformational diversity and its close
relationship with protein function. Currently, CoDNaS has 122122
structures integrating 12684 entries, with an average of 9.63 confor-
mers per protein.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is well established that the native state of a protein is repre-
sented by an ensemble of conformers in equilibrium (Tsai et al.,
1999). Different factors, such as ligands, post-translational modi-
fications or pH variations could shift this equilibrium toward a
given conformer (Kumar et al., 2000). Following conformational
selection theory, the change in the dynamic landscape and the
re-distribution of conformer population is a key feature to under-
stand protein function (Nussinov and Ma, 2012). It has been
shown that different structures for the same protein obtained
under different conditions represent snapshots of protein dyna-
mism and then characterize putative structural conformers
(Best et al., 2006). Here, we describe the design, development
and use of a database of proteins showing different degrees of
conformational diversity. Conformational Diversity of Native

State (CoDNaS) is a collection of redundant structures, obtained
from different experimental protocols, for the same protein.
CoDNaS is a database of complete proteins, linked with
Protein Conformational DataBase (J uritz et al., 2011), a previous
development from our group oriented to the analysis of con-
formational diversity in protein domains. The database is exten-
sively linked with physicochemical and biological information,
and it is designed to allow the user to explore how different
parameters could modulate protein conformational diversity.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Using the BlastClust application (Altschul et al., 1990) on protein
data bank database (Berman, 2000), for every protein deposited,
we obtained all available clusters with 100% of sequence identity.
We only considered clusters with more than two structures for
each protein and structures with resolutions <4 A. Structural
similarity measures were performed using MAMMOTH (Ortiz
et al., 2002), ProFit (McLachlan, 1982) and TM-score (Zhang
and Skolnick, 2004) for all the structures retrieved for each pro-
tein. The maximum C-alpha root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) value for every entry was registered as a measure of
the conformational diversity extension. Each structure in
CoDNaS is characterized by the conditions of its experimental
determination: presence of ligands, mutations, post-translational
modiﬁcations, oligomeric state, pH, loop regions and tempera-
ture. According to the conformational selection theory, these
factors could be used to study conformational changes and to
correlate them with biological information. In addition, proteins
were linked with other databases, such as UniProt (Jain et al.,
2009), gene ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000), enzyme commis-
sion (Kotera et al., 2004), CATH (Greene et al., 2007), SIFTS
(Velankar et al., 2005) and MobiDB (Di Domenico et al., 2012),
to obtain a broad spectrum of biological and physicochemical
information such as taxonomy, source organism, protein func-
tion, degree of protein disorder and structural class, among
others. Structures (putative conformers) for a given protein
were clustered using two algorithms: hierarchical clustering and
affinity propagation clustering. C-alpha RMSD per position
values were also derived to complement global similarity meas-
ures together with additional parameters characterizing conform-
ational change (such as degree of protein disorder, loopy residues
content and solvent-exposed area).

The web application server is implemented on HTML, PHP
and Java languages, connected with a MySQL-based database.
CoDNaS search is based on dynamics SQL queries generated in
PHP.

3 USAGE

CoDNaS database can be searched and browsed using different
global structural measures between conformers. This structural
information is linked with physicochemical and biological par-
ameters. The user can define and combine different parameters
to limit the search such as C-alpha RMSD extension, causes of
conformational diversity or taxonomy, among others. A typical
query, for example, could involve the search for those proteins
showing a conformational diversity >1A of C-alpha RMSD
owing to the presence of ligands. This query will retrieve all
entries containing at least one pair of conformers presenting a
C-alpha RMSD >1 A where the unique difference in the struc-
ture estimation (NMR or XRD) is the presence or absence of
ligands. An example of that search is shown in Figure 1, where
five conformational states are observed for the protein lysine,
arginine and ornithine-binding protein (LAO protein)
(Fig. 1A). One of these structures (2LAO) has no ligand
bound, whereas the other four (lLAH, lLAF, lLAG and
lLST) have arginine, lysine or ornithine bound. Maximum con-
formational diversity is obtained when the conformer with
unbound ligand is compared with any of the other conformers
containing a ligand. The conformers containing a ligand are
structurally similar to each other as derived from the clustering
analysis shown in Figure 1A. Global and local structural differ-
ences are shown in Figure 1B and C. The pair of conformers with
maximum structural diversity is shown in Figure 1B with a
C-alpha RMSD of 4.71A. Figure 1C represents the z—scores
derived from per position C-alpha RMSD showing the local
differences between bound and unbound forms of the protein.
Similar information is provided for all the aligned pairs of con-
formers for each protein at the web server. For each entry in
CoDNaS, structural alignments, sequence-derived alignment and
structural and physicochemical comparisons between conformers
are available to download. Other parameters besides the presence
of ligands can be used to search CoDNaS database, such as
differences in pH and temperature, change in oligomeric struc-
ture (e.g. the occurrence of transient oligomers for a given pro-
tein), presence of mutations, presence of disordered and/or loopy
regions and the presence of post-translational modifications.

4 DISCUSSION

Conformational diversity is a key feature to understand protein
function and evolution (Juritz et al., 2013), enzyme catalysis and
molecular recognition (Boehr et al., 2010).

Recently, it has been shown that explicit consideration of
conformational diversity improves prediction of disease-related
mutations (Juritz et al., 2012) and protein-protein interactions
and molecular docking (Kuzu et al., 2013; Osguthorpe et al.,
2012). As computational prediction of large conformational
changes could be challenging [e.g. using molecular dynamics
(Petruk et al., 2013)], CoDNaS database could provide a useful
dataset to test new tools to predict and explore possible causes of
conformational diversity in proteins.

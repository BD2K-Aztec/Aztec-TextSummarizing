Abstract

Summary: MIA detects and visualizes isotopic enrichment in gas chromatography electron ioniza—
tion mass spectrometry (GC—El—MS) datasets in a non—targeted manner. It provides an easy—to—use
graphical user interface that allows for visual mass isotopomer distribution analysis across mul—
tiple datasets. MIA helps to reveal changes in metabolic fluxes, visualizes metabolic proximity of
isotopically enriched compounds and shows the fate of the applied stable isotope labeled tracer.
Availability and Implementation: Linux and Windows binaries, documentation, and sample data
are freely available for download at http://massisotopolomeanalyzer.lu. MIA is a stand—alone appli—
cation implemented in C++ and based on Qt5, NTFD and the MetaboliteDetector framework.

1 Introduction

Stable isotope assisted metabolomics is widely applied to analyze
metabolism and to determine reaction mechanisms (Buescher et 61].,
2015). However, current approaches are usually highly targeted and
only take into account a small set of metabolites. We recently dem—
onstrated the potential of non—targeted stable isotope labeling in the
analysis of hypoxic cancer cells to detect hypoxia—induced metabolic
ﬂux changes in a non—targeted manner (Weindl et 61]., 2016).

There have been tools available for the non—targeted and quanti—
tative detection of isotopic enrichment in complex samples analyzed
by GC—MS (Hiller et 61]., 2013) or LC—MS (Bueschl et 61]., 2012;
Capellades et 61]., 2016; Chokkathukalam et 61]., 2013; Creek et 61].,
2012; Huang et 61]., 2014). These tools provide the isotopic enrich—
ment of all detected compounds in the form of mass isotopomer dis—
tributions (MIDs), which represent the relative abundances of the
different isotopic isomers (isotopologues) grouped by their masses.
However, such metabolome—wide stable isotope labeling data has
barely been analyzed to eXtract biological information in a truly
non—targeted manner. One reason is, that there is still a lack of ad—
equate software to facilitate the analysis of such datasets. Without
proper data analysis tools, a global mass isotopolome analysis and
its biological interpretation is tedious.

Until recently, there was neither free nor commercial software
available that sufficiently supported the biological analysis of global
stable isotope labeling datasets beyond the mere detection of isotopic

enrichment. To this end, we developed MIA, an easy—to—use software
tool to determine, visualize and analyze mass isotopomer distributions
across multiple GC—EI—MS datasets in a non—targeted manner (Fig. 1).

2 Features

MIA, the Mass Isotopolome Analyzer, provides the following
features:

° Non—targeted determination of mass isotopomer distributions

° Matching detected compounds across different datasets

° Visualization of MIDs of all mass—spectrometric fragments

° Analysis of MID changes

° Visualization of compound networks based on MID similarity

° Compound identiﬁcation using reference libraries

° Export of graphics or spreadsheet data

° Integration with MetaboliteDetector software for further data
analysis (http://metabolitedetector.tu—bs.de/)

2.1 Data visualization

MIA visualizes the MIDs of the detected fragments as barplots. All
detected isotopically enriched mass spectrometric fragments can be
analyzed. If replicate measurements are provided, confidence inter—
vals and quality measures of MID determination such as coefficient
of determination are provided (Weindl et 61]., 2015b).

Fig. 1. MIA workflow. After performing a stable isotope labeling experiment, isotopic enrichment is detected and quantified in a non-targeted manner. Labeled
compounds are matched across all datasets and MIDs are visualized. Data can be filtered and analyzed by changes in MIDs which indicate metabolic flux
changes. MID-similarity can be visualized to reveal metabolic proximity of the isotopically enriched compounds to aid compound identification or to reveal their
biosynthetic pathways. Finally, data can be exported either as spreadsheet or vector graphics for further use

2.2 Mass isotopomer abundance variation analysis

MIDs from different datasets can be analyzed for changes in relative
mass isotopomer abundance. Such variations are caused by, and are in—
dicative of, altered metabolic ﬂuxes. Therefore, metabolic ﬂux changes
are detected in a non—targeted manner (Weindl et al., 2015a, 2016).

2.3 MID similarity networks

Usually compounds closely connected within the metabolic network
show very similar MIDs (Weindl et al., 2016). MIA exploits this fact
for the analysis of stable isotope labeling data: Isotopically enriched
compounds can be visualized in form of a network with connectivity
based on their pairwise similarity. Due to this network visualization,
closely related compounds can easily be detected. Knowledge on
metabolic similarity can be valuable for compound identification,
addressing a common bottleneck of non—targeted metabolomics.

3 Experimental requirements

MIA operates on low resolution GC—EI—MS data in the
MetaboliteDetector or the commonly used netCDF format. MIDs
are determined from the difference between mass spectra of an iso—
topically enriched compound and those of the non—enriched com—
pound (Weindl et al., 2015b). Thus, two metabolite extracts need to
be measured: One from a stable isotope labeling experiment and one
from a label-free experiment.

4 Implementation

MIA is implemented in C—i——i— and Qt5. The MetaboliteDetector
(Hiller et al., 2009) library is used for GC—EI—MS data handling, the
NTFD library (Hiller et al., 2010, 2013) for non—targeted detection
and quantification of stable isotope labeling and the GraphViz li-
brary for graph layouts (Gansner and North, 2000). Binaries are
available for Linux and Windows operating systems.

5 Conclusion

Non—targeted stable isotope labeling analysis is a versatile tool for
metabolic research. However, it has not yet reached its full potential
due to the lack of appropriate data analysis software. MIA helps the
user to quickly visualize and analyze this complex data and to gain
new biological insights eventually. A more in—depth description of

the implemented workﬂows and a case study applying the described
workﬂows are available in Weindl et al. (2016).

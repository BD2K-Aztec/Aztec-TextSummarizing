Abstract

Summary: Precise regulatory control of genes, particularly in eukaryotes, frequently requires the
joint action of multiple sequence-specific transcription factors. A cis—regulatory module (CRM) is
a genomic locus that is responsible for gene regulation and that contains multiple transcription
factor binding sites in close proximity. Given a collection of known transcription factor binding
motifs, many bioinformatics methods have been proposed over the past 15 years for identifying
within a genomic sequence candidate CRMs consisting of clusters of those motifs.

Results: The MCAST algorithm uses a hidden Markov model with a P—value-based scoring scheme
to identify candidate CRMs. Here, we introduce a new version of MCAST that offers improved
graphical output, a dynamic background model, statistical confidence estimates based on false
discovery rate estimation and, most significantly, the ability to predict CRMs while taking into
account epigenomic data such as DNase I sensitivity or histone modification data. We demonstrate
the validity of MCAST’s statistical confidence estimates and the utility of epigenomic priors in
identifying CRMs.

Availability and implementation: MCAST is part of the MEME Suite software toolkit. A web server

1 Introduction

 

Eukaryotic gene regulation is carried out by a variety of mechan-
isms, involving transcription factors, microRNAs, DNA methyla-
tion, nucleosome occupancy and local as well as large-scale
chromatin structure. The relative importance of these various mech-
anisms is subject to debate; however, the joint influence of multiple
transcription factors on gene regulation is clearly an important com-
ponent of the eukaryotic gene regulatory system. In practice, a single
transcription factor is neither specific enough nor binds strongly
enough to achieve and maintain access to the genomic DNA; conse-
quently, most regulatory loci contain binding sites for multiple
factors that act in concert to upregulate or downregulate one or

more target genes. Such sites are known as cis-regulatory modules
(CRMs).

An important and well-studied problem in computational biology
is the CRM scanning problem. The input to this task is a collection of
transcription factor binding motifs plus a set of DNA sequences. The
latter may comprise a complete genome or a set of regions of interest,
such as upstream regions of annotated genes. The CRM scanning al-
gorithm searches for clusters of occurrences of the given motifs;
hence, the output is a collection of candidate CRMs, along with
annotations indicating which motifs occur within each one.

The first CRM scanning algorithm was LRA (Wasserman and
Fickett, 1998). Since its introduction, numerous other algorithms

have been described in the literature, some with accompanying
software and web servers (see Supplementary materials for a review
of existing methods). Some of these methods employ a sliding win-
dow approach, whereas others use probabilistic models such as
hidden Markov models.

Here, we introduce an improved implementation of the MCAST
algorithm (Bailey and Noble, 2003). MCAST uses a motif-based
hidden Markov model to scan for clusters of motifs. Its key features
include a scoring scheme based on P-values and a method for cali-
brating the resulting scores to obtain statistical confidence estimates.
We have recently improved MCAST in four ways. First, we have
dramatically improved the graphical output produced by the tool
(Supplementary Fig. 1). The new output provides a schematic view
showing the relative position and statistical significance of the motif
occurrences in the CRM. The schematic view can be expanded into
a detailed view displaying any region of the CRM at the nucleotide
level, and the region of the CRM displayed in the detailed view may
be chosen interactively. Second, to reduce false positives due to un-
usual local base content, we have added a dynamic background
model, selected based on the local GC content around the current
position in the genome. Third, we have improved the multiple test-
ing correction methodology, replacing the Bonferroni adjustment
with a false discovery rate (FDR) estimation procedure. This change
employs a reservoir sampling scheme to allow MCAST to accurately
estimate the percentage of motif scores drawn according to the null
hypothesis (Storey, 2002) without running out of memory when
scanning a large genome with many motifs. Fourth, and most signifi-
cantly, to improve accuracy we have incorporated into MCAST a
method for converting epigenomic data—DNase I sensitivity or his-
tone modification data from ChIP-seq experiments—into a prob-
abilistic prior (Cuellar-Partida et al., 2011). We demonstrate that
MCAST provides state-of-the-art discrimination power, and that the
incorporation of a DNase I sensitivity prior significantly improves
its performance.

2 Implementation

MCAST is implemented in C and is available as a command line
tool or via the web interface. Motifs are accepted in the MEME or
TRANSFAC formats, and utilities are provided for converting a var-
iety of common motif formats to MEME format. The command line
version of MCAST accepts FASTA-formatted DNA sequences, and
the web server additionally offers a large variety of genome data-
bases that are automatically downloaded from the NCBI. MCAST
supports a variety of user-level parameters, the most important of
which are the P-value threshold at which a motif is deemed signifi-
cant (motif-pthresh), the maximum allowed distance between adja-
cent motif occurrences within a CRM (max-gap) and the FDR
threshold for reporting CRMs (output-qthresh). MCAST provides
HTML, tab-delimited text and XML output. The HTML output
provides interactive graphical representations of the CRMs using
embedded JavaScript. Key features of the MCAST output include
summaries of the input sequences, motifs and analysis parameters.
The coordinates, log-odds score, P-value, E-value and q-value are
provided for each putative CRM.

3 Results

We tested the validity of MCAST’s statistical confidence estimates
by searching a set of five motifs against a shuffled version of the
mouse genome (see Supplementary materials for details). The

shuffled genome, MCAST’s estimated P—value as a function of the rank
P-value. The lines y = x, y: 2x and y = 0.5x are included for reference. The
close fit of the observed data to the line y= xshows that the P—values are uni-
formly distributed. (B) Enhancer identification. MCAST predicts substantially
more enhancers (’ldentified enhancers’) at all ’FDR’ when using five motifs
and a DNase 1 prior (’Motifs and prior’ curve) compared with using just the
five motifs (’Motifs only’ curve). Prediction accuracy attributable to the prior
alone was assessed by scanning a shuffled version of the genome using the
same motifs and the DNase 1 prior (’Priors only’ curve)

resulting P-values show good calibration, as evidenced by the close
fit between the P-values and a uniform distribution (Fig. 1A). In par-
ticular, the P-values are accurate to within a factor of 2 over nearly
five orders of magnitude. This result is robust to variations in the
primary parameters, max-gap and motif-pthresh, although setting
motif-pthresh to a smaller value leads to fewer predicted CRMs and
slightly conservative calibration in the tail of the p-value distribution
(Supplementary Fig. 3).

A recent study identified enhancers in several mouse embryonic
stem cell lines, characterized by clusters of the motifs for Oct4,
Sox2, Nanog, Klfr and Esrb and by interaction with the Mediator
complex (Whyte et al., 2013). Even jointly, these five motifs do not
have sufficient information content to enable detection of enhancers
at a low FDR. However, the motifs are indeed valuable when com-
bined with DNase I sensitivity data. We used MCAST to scan the
mouse genome with these five motifs and a DNase I prior, and we
compared the performance with searches in which (1) the DNA se-
quence is shufﬂed but the prior is left intact and (2) the prior is not
used at all (see Supplementary materials for details). This experi-
ment shows that, though the DNase I data alone are sufficient to
give a reasonably good ranking of sites in conjunction with shufﬂed
sequence data, the combination of true sequence data and DNase I
data boosts performance considerably (Fig. 1B). At an FDR thresh-
old of 1%, MCAST with a DNase I prior identifies 1307 out of
8794 enhancers, for a recall of 15%. Using only the DNase I prior
or using only the motifs yields far fewer identifications (793 and 82

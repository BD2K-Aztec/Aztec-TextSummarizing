ABSTRACT

Motivation: Cryo-electron tomography allows the imaging of macro-
molecular complexes in near living conditions. To enhance the nominal
resolution of a structure it is necessary to align and average individual
subtomograms each containing identical complexes. However, if the
sample of complexes is heterogeneous, it is necessary to first classify
su btomograms into groups of identical complexes. This task becomes
challenging when tomograms contain mixtures of unknown com-
plexes extracted from a crowded environment. Two main challenges
must be overcomed: First, classification of subtomograms must be
performed without knowledge of template structures. However,
most alignment methods are too slow to perform reference-free clas-
sification of a large number of (e.g. tens of thousands) of subtomo-
grams. Second, subtomograms extracted from crowded cellular
environments, contain often fragments of other structures besides
the target complex. However, alignment methods generally assume
that each subtomogram only contains one complex. Automatic meth-
ods are needed to identify the target complexes in a subtomogram
even when its shape is unknown.

Results: In this article, we propose an automatic and systematic
method for the isolation and masking of target complexes in subto-
mograms extracted from crowded environments. Moreover, we also
propose a fast alignment method using fast rotational matching in real
space. Our experiments show that, compared with our previously
proposed fast alignment method in reciprocal space, our new
method significantly improves the alignment accuracy for highly dis-
torted and especially crowded subtomograms. Such improvements
are important for achieving successful and unbiased high-throughput
reference-free structural classification of complexes inside whole-cell
tomograms.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cryo-electron tomography enables the 3D imaging of macromol-
ecular complexes at nanometer-scale resolution in near native
conditions (Best et al., 2007; Lucic et al., 2005; Medalia et al.,
2002). Tomograms of individual cells are essentially 3D represen-
tations of the entire proteome providing a snapshot of the dis-
tributions of protein complexes (Beck et al., 2011). However,
comprehensive detection of individual complexes in cell tomo-
grams is challenging because of the inherent low signal-to-noise

ratio (SNR), missing data, nonisotropic resolution and the fact
that individual macromolecules are difﬁcult to recognize in a
highly crowded environment (Beck et al., 2009; Best et al., 2007;
Bohm et al., 2000; Frangakis et al., 2002; Medalia et al., 2002;
Nickell et al., 2006).

Most methods for detecting complexes in cell tomograms rely
on a template structure, which serves as a reference in searching
for a similar pattern in the tomogram (e.g. Beck et al., 2009).
However, for an unbiased detection and classiﬁcation of all the
different complexes in a cellular tomogram, template-free meth-
ods are needed (Xu et al., 2011). Such an analysis is challenging
and relies on three main steps: First, the locations of potential
complexes are detected by using particle-picking methods and a
subregion surrounding the potential complex is extracted (i.e. the
subtomogram). Second, the subtomogram regions corresponding
only to the target complex must be detected, which allows mask-
ing out all background regions, which in turn contain noise and
in case of crowded subtomograms also fragments of surrounding
structures. Third, reference-free structural classiﬁcation of the
masked subtomograms is performed, which is typically based
on an iterative process of subtomogram alignments, classiﬁca-
tions and averaging (e.g. Amat et al., 2010; Bartesaghi et al.,
2008; Chen et al., 2013; Forster et al., 2008; Volkmann, 2010;
Xu et al., 2012). Finally, the averaging of aligned subtomograms
of the same complexes will enhance the nominal resolution of the
resulting density maps.

In this article, we address two main challenges in reference-free
subtomogram classiﬁcations. First, we propose an automatic
method for adaptive masking of target regions in crowded sub-
tomograms without the knowledge of the shape of the complex.
Such a method is particularly important for subtomograms ex-
tracted from crowded environments, such as the cell cytoplasm.
In such a case, subtomograms will also contain fragmental re-
gions of other complexes owing to the high particle density in the
tomogram. Masking out these regions is of great importance in
the subsequent classiﬁcation process. Unlike automatic masking
methods based on voxel weighting (Xu et al., 2012) or dimension
reduction methods such as Principle Component Analysis
(Heumann et al., 2011), our method is highly scalable because
it is independent of the classiﬁcation process and does not in-
volve iterative processing of a large number of subtomograms.
Second, we propose a new method for fast rotational matching
of subtomograms in real space. The 3D subtomogram alignment
is computationally the most intensive step in the classiﬁcation
process. Currently, most alignment methods are based on max-
imizing the overlap similarity of two subtomograms through
exhaustive search over all rigid transforms (rotation and

translation) of one subtomogram with respect to the other (e.g.
Amat et al., 2010; Forster et al., 2008). Such methods scan ex-
haustively through each rotational angle, and ﬁnd the best cor-
responding translation using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) (e. g.
Amat et al., 2010; Forster et al., 2008). These methods are com-
putationally intensive, which limits their applicability in refer-
ence-free classiﬁcations. To increase alignment accuracy, local
search methods have been developed to reﬁne initial alignments
(e.g. Bartesaghi et al., 2008; Hrabe et al., 2012; Xu and Alber,
2012). To increase computational efﬁciencies, two approximate
alignment methods have been developed, which separate the
translational from the rotational subtomogram alignments
(Bartesaghi et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2012). These methods are
based on similarity scores deﬁned in the reciprocal space (i.e.
Fourier space). To separate translational and rotational search,
these methods use an approximate score that introduces transla-
tional invariance by eliminating the phase information of the
complex coefﬁcients in the reciprocal space and use only the
magnitude of the Fourier coefﬁcients (Bartesaghi et al., 2008;
Xu et al., 2012). By expressing the structural information in
Spherical Harmonics (SH) Expansion, it is possible to formulate
the rotational alignment as a fast rotational matching, which
simultaneously calculates alignment scores of all rotations
using FFT. This procedure signiﬁcantly increases the alignment
speed. For example, our previously published method (Xu et al.,
2012) achieved between hundreds to thousands fold speedup (de-
pending on subtomograms size and rotational angle interval)
compared with the standard scanning-based alignment method
(Forster et al., 2008) by using a translational invariance approxi-
mation of a similarity score equivalent to a popular score pro-
posed by (Forster et al., 2008).

However, formulating the fast rotational matching in recipro-
cal space has some limitations. In reciprocal space, the majority of
informative signals of a complex is usually contained in a rela-
tively small amount of high magnitude Fourier coefﬁcients (Amat
et al., 2010). These coefﬁcients are often occupying relatively few
voxels in the reciprocal space located within a small region cen-
tered at the origin. Therefore, the SH expansion in the fast rota-
tional matching may be hampered by interpolation errors, which
reduces the accuracy in the alignment process. In contrast, in real
space, the signal covers a wider area within a subtomogram, and
the SH expansion is expected to be more accurate. It is therefore
beneﬁcial to formulate fast rotational matching in real space.
In addition, real space fast rotational matching uses the full
constrained alignment score instead of a translation invariant
approximation when the method is expressed in reciprocal space
(Bartesaghi et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2012).

Here, we devise an improved alignment method, which formu-
lates the fast rotational matching of subtomograms in real space.
To achieve this goal, we ﬁrst identify a keypoint in the target
complex whose relative location is invariant to rigid transform-
ations and serves as the center of rotation in the fast rotational
matching of the two subtomograms. A natural choice is the
center of mass of a complex. However, detection of the center
of mass is not trivial and cannot be approximated by the geo-
metrical or mass density center of the subtomogram. The reason
for this complication is that tomograms are images of the
crowded cellular environment (Beck et al., 2009), and a subto-
mogram contains not necessarily mass density of only one single

complex. When a potential complex is detected and its subtomo-
gram extracted as a rectangular cube then this subtomogram
typically contains also fragments of other surrounding structures
that occupy parts of the subtomogram. Then, the center of mass
estimation and subtomogram alignment are affected by the ex-
istence of the additional mass density in the subtomogram. It is
necessary to focus only on the regions that contain the actual
target complex. Even when a subtomogram does not contain any
surrounding structures, its mean intensity is often close to back-
ground intensity owing to the suppression of low frequency
signal owing to the Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) effect,
which also makes the estimation of the center of mass of the
complex inaccurate.

Applying our automatic target complex segmentation method,
it is possible to estimate a center of mass based only on the target
complex regions in the subtomogram (i.e. the constrained center
of mass). Once the constrained center of mass is detected, we
design a fast subtomogram alignment method that uses real
space signals and takes into account missing wedge corrections
using reciprocal space signals. Moreover, the alignment focuses
exclusively on the target complex regions in each subtomogram,
which signiﬁcantly decreases the inﬂuence of background noise
and surrounding structures to the alignment process.

Our experiments show that our new approach signiﬁcantly
increases the alignment accuracy compared with our previous
proposed fast alignment method (Xu et al., 2012) for highly dis-
torted subtomograms. Most importantly, the new method is
highly robust to the inﬂuence of surrounding structures inside
crowded subtomograms.

2 METHODS

This section begins by describing the automatic segmentation of the target
complex and then focuses on the fast rotational alignment in real space.

2.1 Automatic segmentation of the target complex in a
subtomogram

The automatic target complex segmentation method consists of several
steps (Figs 1, 2 and 7): (i) automatic scale selection is performed to max-
imally enhance the detection of structural boundaries in a subtomogram;

(ii) segments are deﬁned that describe the boundaries between structural
elements; and (iii) a classiﬁcation of the detected structural segments into
candidate regions is performed by using a statistical model based
clustering.

2.1.] Automatic scale selection for optimal smoothing and bound-
ary enhancement In this article, we assume that in a subtomogram
high image intensity corresponds to high electron density. When a sub-
tomo gram is renorrnalized so that its mean intensity is zero, the boundary
of a complex tends to have a negative intensity surface (Fig. 3, yellow
arrow). This property is due to the CTF effects in the electron tomog-
raphy imaging process, which suppresses low frequency signals. We use
this negative intensity surface as a main characteristic when identifying
the segments at the boundary of structural elements, such as the target
complex and these structures captured at the outer regions of the sub-
tomogram. To reduce the inﬂuence of noise, smoothing of the subtmo-
grams is needed. However, too much smoothing will weaken the negative
intensity boundary. To ﬁnd the optimal degree of smoothing, we use the
scale-space representation method and propose an automatic scale selec-
tion method to ﬁnd the optimal degree of smoothing that maximally
enhances the boundary surface while minimizing the noise. Scale-space
(Witkin, 1983) is a framework for multi-scale signal representation. An
image is represented as a one-parameter family of smoothed images, the
scale-space representation, parameterized by the size of the Gaussian
smoothing kernel (Lindeberg, 1994):

ga(X) I: (2ﬂ02)%

Given a subtomogram, f, a Gaussian smoothing can be expressed as the
convolution between f and g0:

J70 :=f* g0

In the smoothed subtomogram fa, all features with a size smaller than a
are ﬁltered out, whereas others are preserved. Our objective is to deter-
mine the optimal scale 0 to enhance the formation of a negative intensity
surface while minimizing the inﬂuence of noise. To do so, we scan a range
of feasible 0 values. For a given smoothed subtomogram with scale a, we
ﬁnd all local minima with negative intensities in in and denote this set as
Smin. We then deﬁne a local surface score for each minima in Smin, to
identify those minima that are likely part of a negative intensity surface.
The surface score is calculated as follows: we calculate the Hessian matrix
H(x), whose elements are second-order derivatives of fa evaluated at
x e [R3,

axiaxj x:

H,,-(x,,)=  X , VkeSmin, i,j= 1,2,3
k

where xk is the corresponding location of a voxel k.

For any k e Smin, let y1, y2, m be the ordered eigenvalues of H(xk)
such that |y1| Z |y2| Z |y3|. Then, we can construct a local surface
score s]:U(xk) similar to (Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2011) as follows:

, _ ll/ll—x/ll/zl/Sl ifr1>0,
Sfa(X") — {0 if y1<0.

We ﬁnd the a value that maximally enhances the surface scores of all the
minima so that the most negative minima tends to have a strong surface
score. To do so, we calculate an accumulative surface score from all the
minima. First, the minima are ordered in ascending order in fa such that

where k1, ...,k|5mm| e Smin. Then the accumulative surface score s?“ is
deﬁned as

i
Saccu = Z S]U(ij)
j=1

Because 07,,(xki)} is in ascending order with respect to i, this score s?“
forms a monotonically increasing function of ﬁ,(xk,). We can measure the
Area Under Curve, AU Cg, using {si‘ccu} and {fg(xk,)}. AUCU tends to be
large when the most negative minima have large surface scores. To meas-
ure how much the AUC reﬂects true surface signals rather than random
noise, we also randomly perrnutate all voxels in f and repeat the afore-
mentioned procedure to calculate a perrnutated AUC, AU C56"?

To determine the optimal Gaussian ﬁltering value a, we scan through a
range of different as to ﬁnd the 0* value that maximizes

AUCU
AUCgerm

For simplicity, in the following sections, we denote f 2:]; (Figs 2C
and 7B) and also denote f,- := f(x,-) for any voxel i.

2.1.2 Detecting structural, boundary and background segments
in the subtomOgram After identifying the optimal scale 0*, we now
determine those local minima that have strong surface scores and are
likely to separate different structural elements (i.e. the target complex
and surrounding structures). We deﬁne them as those local minima
with both high surface scores and low intensity values. To do so, ﬁrst
we select the minima whose intensity is signiﬁcantly smaller than the
average intensity, i.e.

Smin_intensity =  E Smin I

where CmiantensityJ‘actor is a constant parameter to control the signiﬁcance
level, and mad is the Median Absolute Deviation, which is a robust
measure of variability.

In addition, we also collect these minima whose surface score is
signiﬁcantly larger than the average scores of all minima, i.e.

Smin_surface  E Smin I
sf; (xk) > medianieSmin (sf; (x,))

+ cmin_surface_factor madiESmin (Sf (Xi

where Cmin_surface_factor is a constant parameter.
All minima with strong surface scores are deﬁned as the intersection of
both groups.

Smin_boundary I: Smin_intensity ﬂ Smin_surface

We denote these minima as the boundary surface minima.

We then determine all local intensity maxima Smax inf, which are likely
to be inside structural elements. We ﬁrst perform Watershed segmenta-
tion (Beucher and Lantuéjoul, 1979; Volkmann, 2002) using Smax as seeds
(Figs 2D and 7C). Each segment corresponds to one local maximum, and
therefore the terms local maximum and segment are used interchange-
ably. We then select all the segments that border with local minima
deﬁned in Smimboundary and denote the corresponding set of maxima as
SmaLboundary. The actual separations between structural elements and
background regions are always at the boundary between segments in
SmaLboundary. The segments in SmaLboundary can be divided into two
types: a structural boundary segment is located in the target complex or
the surrounding structures (Fig. 3, inside red circle), and it contains a
maximum with high intensity value (Fig. 3, highlighted by red cross); a
background boundary segment is located in the regions that do not contain
structural elements (Fig. 3, inside green circle), and which contain a max-
imum with low intensity value (Fig. 3, highlighted by green cross).

To separate these two types of boundary segments, we perform
k-means clustering on SmaLboundary (with cluster number = 2), resulting
in the two groups Smax_structural_boundary and Smax_background_boundary-
Smax_strucmra1_boundary are segments containing local maxima with higher
intensity values and are deﬁned as structural boundary segments (Figs 2E
and 7D), whereas Smax_background_boundary are deﬁned as background
boundary segments.

After focusing on boundary segments (i.e. those that border with sur-
face minima), we now characterize the remaining segments as either part
of structural elements or background regions. To do this, we ﬁrst deter-
mine a cutoff intensity value Cmaxima_cutoff as the largest intensity value in
all the background boundary segments Smax_background_boundary. All remain-
ing segments that contain a local maxima with an intensity value smaller
that cmaxima_cmoff are assigned as background regions.

Finally, the remaining segments whose maxima have intensity values
larger than Cmaxjma_cutoff are deﬁned as structural segments and are there-
fore assumed to be either part of the target complex or other structural
elements:  Smax_structural I:  E Smax I  > cmaxima_cutoff

2.1.3 Combining structural segments into complexes using model
based clustering We new cluster structural segments in Smautrucmral
according to the intensity values and location of their local maxima so
that each cluster of segments will approximately correspond to one con-
secutive structural region. We choose a model-based clustering approach
because it allows an automatic determination of the optimal set of clus-
ters. To perform the clustering, we assume that the location and intensity
of local maxima from clusters follows a probabilistic mixture model,
where each component probability distribution corresponds to a cluster
(Fraley and Raftery, 2002). We model the probability of independently
observing both location and intensity of a local maxima i e Smautrucmral
from a cluster k as:

Pik = 10;, ‘1)(Xi; Mk, 2k) (1)

where p; is a probability proportional to the intensity fl, and (I) is a
probability density function in the form of a multivariate normal distri-
bution with mean uk and covariance 2,. For simpliﬁcation, we assume
that the clusters are spherical with different sizes, i.e. 2k 2 MI. The main
difference between our model and the standard model-based clustering
(Fraley and Raftery, 2002) is the inclusion of the image intensity related
term pﬁ in Equation (1). Our simulation experiments show that the
inclusion of image intensity improves the clustering performance
(Supplementary Document).

probability of cluster k (i.e. cluster mixing probability). A model-based
clustering determines the parameters {1k}, {Mk}, {2k} that maximizes 5.

We use a scale-space representation to estimate cluster centers {uk}.
Given a scale a Z 20*, we obtain the set SO,max of local maxima with
positive intensities in f... The local maximajl, .. . ,le mm are ordered with
decreasing intensity values, i.e. fa(xa,jl) Z  2 ﬂ xmjlsmmaxl >0, where
xmjk is the corresponding location of local maxima jk on fa. We choose
cluster centers as the ﬁrst K local maxima, i.e uk 2 xmjk, Vk = 1, . . . , K

Similar to the standard model based clustering (Celeux and Govaert,
1995; Fraley and Raftery, 2002), an Expectation Maximization algorithm
is used to estimate {ck} and {M}. The expectation maximization is deﬁned
by two iterative steps:

The Expectation Maximization algorithm iterates until there is no signiﬁ-
cant change in the likelihood 5. The clustering of local maxima leads to
clusters of the corresponding segments (Figs 2F and 7E). Using statistical
modeling for clustering enables the determination of an optimal set of
clusters through model selection. By varying the scale a and cluster
number K, we obtain the optimal values for scale and cluster set using
the Bayesian Information Criterion (Fraley and Raftery, 2002):

BIC = 210g 5 — Klog ISmax_structural|

The ﬁnal target complex is then represented by combining multiple seg-
ments that fulﬁll the following criteria: (i) they belong to same cluster
in the model based clustering; (ii) they are in consecutive contact to each
other; and (iii) the maximum intensity values  of the voxels between

two consecutive segments i and j is larger than a threshold. The thresh-
old is computed as Cboundary_cutoff_factorStdLjeSmaX—Stmcmral(ﬂy), where
Cboundary_cutoff_factor is a constant parameter.

The target complex region is then selected as the combined segments
that contain at least one structural boundary segment (deﬁned by
SmaLstrucmraLboundary) and are located closest to the center of the subto-
mogram. To prevent that small features of the target complex are
excluded, a dilation operation is performed to deﬁne the target complex
region A (Figs 2G and 7F).

2.2 Real space fast subtomogram alignment using the
target complex region and its center of mass

Fast rotational matching in real space relies on an initial alignment of the
center of masses of the two subtomograms. Therefore, we describe ﬁrst
how the center of mass of each target complex is calculated before we
describe the fast rotational matching approach.

2.2.1 Calculation of center of mass for target complex region The
determination of the center of mass in subtomograms is not trivial, pri-
marily owing to high noise levels, the suppression of low frequency signals
in the reciprocal space and the existence of surrounding structures inside a
subtomogram.

Here, the center of mass is calculated only based on the regions in the
target complex  We set a thresholded region Athresholded 9n the ﬁltered
subtomogram f, i.e. Athresholded = {x e A : f(x)>mean(f) + 0.5std(f)}.
Then, we use Athresholded to calculate the center of mass. We deﬁne another
intensity function

 =  — minyEAthresholed   X E Athresholed,
0 1f X¢Athresholed~

We then calculate the constrained center of mass ccom of fem.

2.2.2 Fast rotation alignment We represent two subtomograms f
and g as two integrable functions f, g : [R3 —> R. They have been trans-
formed such that (i) their mean intensities are adjusted to zero, (ii) the
voxel intensities outside the target complex region A is set to zero, and
(iii) they are translated according to ccom so that their constrained centers
of mass are aligned. The constrained center of mass is used as rotational
centers in our fast rotational alignment. To correct for the missing wedge
distortions, we only keep the Fourier coefﬁcients within the overlap of
nonmissing wedge regions of both subtomograms. Following Bartesaghi
et al. (2008), Forster et al. (2008) and Xu et al. (2012), we use a binary
missing wedge mask function as M : [R3 —> {0,1}, which deﬁnes valid
and missing Fourier coefﬁcients in reciprocal space. For example, with
a tilt angle range :l:6, the missing wedge mask function can be deﬁned as
M(S) :2 H(Iglflglltan(9))(§), where H is the indicator function. Given M, the
real space subtomogram that excludes any coefﬁcients inside of any of the
two missing wedge regions is deﬁned as,

r = wry/Man]

g = air—1W..ng

where ER denotes the real part of a complex function; .7: is the Fourier
transform operator; and Mf and Mg are missing wedge masks for f and
g, respectively.

Given a 3D rotation R, we can calculate a correlation

where A R is the rotation operator such that (A Re)(x) :2 e[R_1(x)] for
any function e: [R3 —> (D, and R e [R3X3 is the rotation matrix corres-
ponding to 3D rotation R. As in Xu et al. (2012), the correlation measure
pR in Equation (2) is equivalent (up to a constant factor.) to a popular

constrained correlation score with missing wedge correction (Forster
et al., 2008).

The fast rotational alignment is based on sampling of pR simultan-
eously over all rotations R. To do so, we apply a fast 3D volumetric
rotational matching (Kovacs and Wriggers, 2002; Xu et al., 2012). It
can be seen that Equation (2) can be formulated as being composed of
three rotational correlation functions of the form KR :2 f p A—Rq, where
p and q are component functions; .2 denotes the complex conjugate (when
e is a real valued function, the complex conjugate e = e.) of a function e.

When represented in spherical coordinates, the p and q components of
these three functions KR can be approximated by an SH expansion.
Following Garzon et al. (2007), Kovacs and Wriggers (2002) and Xu
et al., (2012), the p and q components in Equation (3) can be expressed as:

where B is the bandwidth, and C[m(l') are the coefﬁcients associated with
the complex-valued spherical harmonic function Y;m(,8,)t) with degree I
and order m, where r, ,8 and A are the radial distance, co-latitude and
longitude, respectively, which deﬁne the position in spherical coordinate.

When a suitable parameterization of the 3D rotational group is
achieved, the rotational correlation function KR :2 f p A—Rq of all
sampled rotations R can be represented as an inverse FFT of a 3D
array of the sum of integrals as follows (Garzon et al., 2007; Kovacs
and Wriggers, 2002; Xu et al., 2012):

KR = 3}”, [Z dinndgm, / Cg’m(r)cgn,(r)r2dr]

where 011%,, are real coefﬁcients deﬁning the elements of the Wigner small
d-matrix evaluated at 90°.

As a consequence of the aforementioned formulation, the cross-correl-
ation functions can be efﬁciently sampled by using FFT simultaneously
over all sampled rotations (Kovacs and Wriggers, 2002; Xu et al., 2012).
The sampling is given as twice the bandwidth B used in the SH trans-
formations. Therefore, pR can be efﬁciently computed over all sampled
rotations R. Similar to Bartesaghi et al. (2008) and Xu et al. (2012),
the set of candidate rotations are then obtained by identifying the
local maxima of ,0 with respect to the rotational degrees of freedom R.
To obtain the optimal translation, a fast translational search is per-
formed for each candidate rotation over the full correlation function
pR by using FFT. Finally, the best combination of rotation and transla-
tion is chosen.

3 RESULTS

We assess the performance of our method by using simulated
subtomograms of a phantom model. In addition, we test our
method by experimentally determined structures of ﬁve com-
plexes as well as experimental ribosome subtomograms extracted
from a whole-cell tomogram.

Crowded subtomogram segmentation and alignment

 

3.1 Generation of simulated tomograms from phantom
and experimental structures

We follow a previously applied methodology for generating sub-
tomograms from initial structures by simulating the tomographic
imaging process as realistically as possible, allowing for the in-
clusion of noise, tomographic distortions due to missing wedge
and electron optical factors such as CTF and Modulation
Transfer Function (MTF) (Beck et al., 2009; Forster et al.,
2008; Nickell et al., 2005; Xu and Alber, 2012; Xu et al., 2011,
2012).

A density map of the complexes (Fig. 4) are generated by
applying a low pass ﬁlter at 4nm resolution to the atomic struc-
tures using the PDB2VOL program of the Situs 2.0 package
(\Nriggers et al., 1999) with voxel length of lnm. In addition, a
density map of a phantom model is generated (Fig. 4A). These
density maps are used as base maps, both of size 643 voxels, and
they are randomly rotated and translated to generate density
map instances in uncrowded conditions. To generate a crowded
environment, two additional structures (randomly chosen from
the phantom model or the ribosome complex) are randomly ori-
ented and placed into the density map ~32 voxels away from the
center of the map.

The density maps of the target complex and neighboring struc-
tures are used as input for simulating electron micrograph images
at different tilt angles. Our simulated subtomograms therefore
contain a wedge-shaped region in reciprocal space for which no
structure factors have been measured (i.e. the missing wedge

effect), resulting in distortions in the density map as observed
in the experimental measurements. To generate realistic micro-
graphs, noise is added to the images according to a given SNR
level (ranging between 0.05 and 0.001), deﬁned as the ratio be-
tween the variances of the signal and noise (Forster et al., 2008)
(Fig. 4A).

The resulting image is convoluted with a CTF, which describes
the imaging in the transmission electron microscope in a linear
approximation (Frank, 2006; Nickell et al., 2005). We also con-
volute the density map with the corresponding MTF of a typical
detector used in tomography. Typical experimental acquisition
parameters (Beck et al., 2009) were used: voxel grid length = 1
nm, the spherical aberration = 2 x 10—3m, the defocus value
= —4 x 10—6m, the MTF corresponded to a realistic electron
detector (McMullan et al., 2009), deﬁned as sinc(mo/2) where
a) is the fraction of the Nyquist frequency. Finally, we use a
backprojection algorithm (Nickell et al., 2005) to generate a
tomogram from the individual 2D micrographs generated at
the various tilt angles (Beck et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2011, 2012;
Xu and Alber, 2012).

3.2 Segmentation of the target complex in simulated
subtomograms

To determine the optimal scale for surface enhancement, we vary
a from 1.0 nm to 3.0 nm. At high noise levels (e.g. SNR g 0.01),
the optimal 0* is usually obtained at ~2.0nm.

For the detection of boundary segments, we set the signiﬁ-
cance levels Cmin_intensity_factor = Cmin_surface_factor = 1- For deter'
mining the target complex, we choose Cboundary_cutoff_factor = 0,
ignoring all boundary segment maxima with negative intensities
in {fij}. For combining segments, we scan a from 20* to 10 nm
and scan the cluster number K from 1 to 5.

To assess the target complex segmentation, we calculate the
overlap between the determined target complex A and the
ground truth Atrue_complex. We also calculate the overlap between
A and regions occupied by the surrounding structures in the
crowded ground truth density map Asurrounding_structure. Then, we
calculate the median of the following three overlap scores across
100 simulated subtomograms at each distortion level and for
each of the benchmark structures:

'14 n Atrue_complex l
lAtrue _complex l

|AnAc |

true_complex

0true.positive _rate =

Ofalse_positive_rate = I c I
true_complex

'14 n Asurrounding_structure|

 

Osurrounding_structure =
'14 surrounding_structure l

where AC denotes the complementary set of A. Our results show
that for all distortion levels, the median of otrue_positive_rate is at
least 0.9, and Ofalse_positive_rate is at most 0.004, demonstrating a
good performance in segmenting the areas of the corresponding
target structures. In contrast, the median of osurroundmgjtrucmre is
close to zero for most of the distortion levels, indicating that our
target complex segmentation method can successfully exclude
surrounding structures in the subtomograms. Only at high dis-
tortion levels, the median of osurrounding_structure starts to deviate
from zero (Supplementary Tables S7—S12).

3.3 Assessment of constrained center of mass detection

The constrained center of mass is expected to be invariant to
rigid transforms of the corresponding structures. The assessment
of the rotational invariance of our constrained center of mass is
performed as follows. We randomly select 100 pairs of subtomo-
grams for each of the benchmark structures. For each pair of
subtomograms i and j, we calculate

dccmﬁnversejj I: “Cccm_inverse,i _ Cccm_inverse,2

as a measure of the degree of invariance, where cccmmversej,‘ and
cccmgnversejj are the corresponding locations of the constrained
center of masses in the original complex that is used to generate
the instances by random rigid transforms. The smaller
dccmjnverse’l‘j, the higher is the degree of invariance, indicating a
good performance.

The performance is expressed as the median of {dccmgnversej ,j},
which is listed in Figure 5 and Supplementary Tables S1, S4, S13
and S16. We can see that the estimation error is generally smaller
than 3, indicating high accuracy even at high distortion levels. As
can be seen in the following section, the degree of invariance is
sufﬁciently small to allow successful pairwise fast rotational
alignments in real space.

3.4 Fast rotational alignment of subtomograms

Our fast alignment method relies on fast rotational matching. In
the following two subsections, we calculate the rotational align-
ment errors for the pairs of complexes, both for the crowded as
well as uncrowded cases. The rotational alignment error is cal-
culated as follows: Suppose R* is the rotation matrix calculated
for an alignment, and Rm, is the true rotation matrix. The re-
tation alignment error can then be measured as

3.4.] Uncrowded subtomograms First, we test our alignment
method with uncrowded subtomograms, which contain one com-
plex without surrounding structures. We compare the alignment
errors between our new alignment method presented here and
our previous method that relied on fast rotational matching in
reciprocal space (Xu et al., 2012) (left column of Fig. 6 and
Supplementary Tables S2 and S5). It is evident that our new
method improves the alignment accuracy on highly distorted
subtomograms.

3.4.2 Crowded subtomograms Next, we compare the two align-
ment methods (Xu et al., 2012) with crowded subtomograms,
which also contain fragments of additional complexes (right
column of Fig. 6 and Supplementary Tables S14 and S17). It
can be clearly seen that when considering crowded subtomograms
without excluding surrounding structures, our previous method
(Xu et al., 2012) generally fails in ﬁnding the correct alignment. By
contrast, our new alignment method aided by target complex seg-
mentation is only marginally affected by crowding and the exist-
ence of the surrounding structures. Our new method clearly
outperforms our previous method when dealing with subtomo-
grams from crowded cellular environments. Similar improvement
in performance is also observed by testing the crowded subtomo-
grams of four additional benchmark complexes (Supplementary
Tables S19—S22) (Fig. 4B) used in (Xu et al., 2012).

We have also measured the correlation between dccmg-nversejij
and drown (Supplementary Tables S3, S6, S15 and S18) and

distortion levels at which both methods can successfully perform align-
ments. The yellow regions correspond to the distortion levels at which our
new method outperforms our previous method and correctly aligns the
subtomograms, whereas our previous method (Xu et al., 2012) fails. The

tested the performance with respect to the levels of crowdedness
(Supplementary Figs Sl—S3). At low to median distortion levels,
we observe moderate correlation between the aforementioned
two quantities. At high distortion levels, the correlations are
small, showing that the alignment is more affected by high
levels of distortions.

3.5 Segmenting target complexes in subtomograms
extracted from experimental whole-cell tomogram
of the human pathogen Leptospira interrogans

We tested our method also on experimental subtomograms
extracted from a whole-cell tomogram of Leptospira interrogans
in undisturbed conditions (Beck et al., 2009). Segmenting of
complexes in such subtomograms is signiﬁcantly more challen-
ging because the macromolecular crowding is high and because
the SNR levels and resolution of these subtomograms is typically
low. Beck et al. (2009) have identiﬁed several complexes in the
tomogram using template matching (Best et al., 2007). The tem-
plates were generated by using density maps of structures in the
Protein Databank and convoluted with CTF and MTF. As a test
case, we use two subtomograms with high template matching
scores to the ribosome template. For each of these matches, we
extracted a subtomogram of size 493 voxels that was large
enough to contain an instance of the complex and certain
amount of surrounding structure fragments.

The results shown in Figure 7 demonstrate that our method
can successfully segment the target ribosome complex while sur-
rounding structures are clearly excluded. The ribosome positions
agree with those detected in the template matching. We further
extended the study to the subtomograms corresponding to the
top 20 template matching scores. Overall, 18 of them showed
successful segmentation (Supplementary Fig. S4). We also ana-
lyzed the target complex segmentation performance with respect
to the level of crowdedness. The crowdedness of the Leptospira
interrogans subtomograms ranges from 0 to 60%. The true-posi-
tive and false-positive rates plotted in Supplementary Figure S4
shows that, in most situations, our method can correctly identify

the target complex region. Only at high crowdedness level, (i.e.
>50%), our method fails to correctly identify the target complex
regions.

3.6 Analysis of computational costs

We implemented the methods in MATLAB and carried out our
tests on a computer cluster consisting of 2.3—2.7 GHz computer
nodes. On average, the target complex detection step takes 14.8 s.
In this step, the major proportion of computation time was used
for the scale selection (8.6 s on average). In practice, we can de-
termine a ﬁxed scale parameter a from a set of training subto-
mograms and directly apply it to all subtomograms. Then, on
average, only 6.2s would be used for detecting the target com-
plex. The computer memory consumption is small. Because a
subtomogram is typically small (a subtomogram of size 643 cor-
responds to at most 2M memory), our detection step uses no
more memory than 20 times the size of a single subtomogram.
The most computational intensive step in the classiﬁcation
process is the alignment. The computational cost of our new
method is essentially the same as our previous method (Xu
et al., 2012) and therefore allows high-throughput subtomogram
classiﬁcations.

4 CONCLUSION

Cryo-electron tomograms provide useful information for simul-
taneously detecting the native structures and their spatial cellular
locations of a large number of macromolecular complexes.
However, the high level of macromolecular crowding and distor-
tions in the extracted subtomograms makes such analysis
challenging. In addition, the availability of a large number of
subtomograms containing potential complexes requires high-
throughput analysis techniques. In this article, we propose an
automatic segmentation technique that isolates the target com-
plex inside a crowded subtomogram. We further detect the rigid
transform invariant center of mass of the target complex and
propose an improved fast alignment method using fast rotational
matching in real space. The new method shows good perform-
ance in segmenting target complexes in crowded subtomograms
and performing fast rotational alignments using both simulated
and experimental subtomograms. This performance is a neces-
sary condition for high-throughput structural classiﬁcations of
complexes in whole-cell tomograms. This work represents a step
toward high-throughput and reference-free Visual Proteomics
analysis of highly crowded whole-cell cryo-electron tomograms.

Abstract

Motivation: Current differential correlation methods are designed to determine molecular feature
pairs that have the largest magnitude of difference between correlation coefficients. These methods
do not easily capture molecular feature pairs that experience no correlation in one group but correl—
ation in another, which may reflect certain types of biological interactions. We have developed a tool,
the Discordant method, which categorizes the correlation types for each group to make this possible.
Results: We compare the Discordant method to existing approaches using simulations and two
biological datasets with different types of —omics data. In contrast to other methods, Discordant
identifies phenotype—related features at a similar or higher rate while maintaining reasonable com—

putational tractability and usability.

1 Introduction

Many strategies exist for analyzing high—throughput —omics data in
order to explore the complexity that differentiates biological groups.
The most common analysis is differential expression, which is
defined by molecular features that experience large changes in ex—
pression or abundance between groups (Malone and Oliver, 2011;
Oshlack et 61]., 2010). In addition to differential variance (i.e. groups
may not have different mean levels but dissimilar variance) (Ho
et 61]., 2008), another analysis that may be relevant is differential
correlation or coexpression (DC), which is the change of association
of molecular feature pairs between groups (e.g. healthy and disease).
These differential associations may indicate molecular interactions
that characterize or reﬂect biological or disease state.

Examples of DC can be found in both low— and high—throughput
studies. For instance, one study using chromatin immunoprecipitation
determined the effect of mutant p53 on wild—type p53 in the cell.
Mutated p53 reduces the binding of wild—type p53 to the p5 3 response
element of p21, MDM2 and PIG3, causing DC of p53 and these

targets between samples with wild—type p53 and mutant p53 (Willis
et 61]., 2004). Another study using ELISA and a lymphoproliferation
assay determined that patients with treated paracoccidioidomycosis
had correlation between interleukins and tumor necrosis factor, but
there was no correlation in untreated patients (Silva et 61]., 1995).

Larger—scale studies have identified DC to study how transcrip—
tion factors can inﬂuence the expression of a transcript. In a mye—
loma study, transcription factor coexpression with genes in
pathways was found to be different between the two major subtypes
of myeloma (Wang et 61]., 2014). Another transcriptomic study that
examined expression differences between lean and obese siblings
found that NEGR1 is a central hub in obesity—related DC networks
(Walley et 61]., 2012).

DC has been investigated with a myriad of approaches. These
methods have been reviewed recently (Kayano et 61]., 2014).
The classical method by Fisher transforms the correlation coeffi-
cients into 2 scores and then determines the statistical dissimilarity
between the two groups (Fisher, 1915). Software implementing this

method is now available (Fukushima, 2013). Wang et al. (2014)
makes similar assumptions and uses a Hotteling test.

Another popular method uses linear models and determines sig—
nificant interaction terms between groups (Cho et 61]., 2009; Ruggeri
and Eng, 2015; Jauhiainen et 61]., 2012). Linear models have been
shown to be effective, however, there are deficiencies when there is
large differences in variability between groups, which may be relevant
when examining —omics data from different types of platforms and/
or data from humans or non—experimental model systems. It has been
shown that large variability results in incorrect slope estimates
(Cornbleet and Gochman, 1979; Ludbrook, 2010). Furthermore,
slope estimates can be different depending on what feature is con—
sidered the dependent or independent variable in the linear model.

Alternative methods use Bayesian models (Bradley et 61]., 2009;
Dawson and Kendziorski, 2012). For example, Bradley et 611. uses
pathway information as a prior, which can be beneficial for identifi-
cation, but pathway knowledge can also be incomplete. Very few
pathway databases combine interactions between multiple types of
molecular features (Bader, 2006) except for KEGG (Kanehisa,
2000). Dawson et al. implemented EBcoexpress, which uses
Empirical Bayes estimation and returns a posterior probability of
differential coexpression for each pair of molecular features.

Another statistical method to determine DC is the Expected
Conditional F—statistic, which modifies the F—statistic from analysis
of variance for multiple groups (Fang et 61]., 2010; Ho et 61]., 2008;
Lai et 61]., 2004). The F—statistic was adapted to determine molecular
feature pairs that share the least variance instead of single features
that share dissimilar mean across groups.

Other methods use partial correlations, hierarchical clustering,
principal component analysis and other models to determine
DC modules rather than individual pairs (Kayano et 61]., 2013;
Kostka and Spang, 2004; Tesson et 61]., 2010; Watson, 2006).
Although these types of analyses are informative, they only de—
scribe the average behavior of molecular features instead of spe—
cific pairs.

Missing from all of these methods is categorizing the different
types of DC scenarios, commonly referred to as ‘binning’, where
each pair is categorized into all possible paired correlation scenarios.
The following are different examples: (i) Group 1: +, Group 2: —,
(ii) Group 1: +, Group 2: 0, (iii) Group 1: —I—, Group 2: —I—. Example
1 is an extreme version of DC, where the correlation is in opposite
directions between groups. Example 2 also illustrates DC, except
that in Group 2 the correlation is zero. Finally, Example 3 is where
there is no DC because the correlation is in the same direction for
both groups. Most methods are well suited to detect molecular fea—
ture pairs with a pattern similar to Example 1 (i.e. cross), but are
less likely to identify DC molecular feature pairs with a pattern simi—
lar to Example 2 (i.e. disrupted). Molecular feature pairs in Example
2 could be biologically relevant since they indicate an interaction in
one group that is disrupted in the other group.

In this work, we develop a method that uses binning to not only
improve the identification of molecular feature pairs that exhibit
more significant cross DC as in Example 1, but also disrupted DC as
in Example 2. Our method is based on a mixture model originally
developed to assess whether microarray experiments could be com—
bined (Lai et 61]., 2007, 2014). We have altered the application of
this method to determine DC of molecular feature pairs between
groups and have named it the Discordant method. Using the EM al—
gorithm (Dempster et 61]., 1977), the Discordant method estimates a
posterior probability for each possible paired correlation scenario to
achieve binning. Binning increases power since it identifies all pos—
sible DC pairs rather than the most extreme. Other advantages of

the Discordant method are computational tractability and ease in
choosing initial parameters.

We compare our method to Fisher’s method, linear interaction
models and EBcoexpress (Dawson and Kendziorski, 2012; Fisher,
1915) with simulations to assess specificity and sensitivity for all
three methods. We also use the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) glio—
blastoma miRNA and transcriptomic data (McLendon et 61]., 2008)
and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) metabolomic
and transcriptomic data (Bahr et 61]., 2013) as a biological validation
of the methods.

2 Methods

2.1 Fisher’s transformation

Fisher’s transformation is used (Fisher, 1915 ) to convert Pearson’s
sample correlation coefficient r into 2 score with the following
equation:

 

(1)

The resulting z score has an approximately normal distribution
(Hotelling, 1953). Fisher’s transformation is applied to all possible
feature pairs for each biological group, which may be subsets of dis—
ease, biological or treatment samples. For example, in the biological
applications of the methods in this study, the groups are defined by
the presence or absence of disease.

2.2 Discordant

The model is adapted from Lais et a]. which was developed to test
for concordance between microarrays (Lai et 61]., 2007, 2014). Our
method is based on a mixture model with three classes: 0, — and —I—
as seen in Figure 1. Given a class i, the density for one feature pair,
with Fisher’s transformed correlations z1 and zz’ for group 1 and
group 2, respectively, is:

group 2 with mean 17 and variance 12 and it),- is the frequency that the
feature pair is in class i for group 1 and class j for group 2. The three
classes (represented by i and j) are 0 (i orj: 0),—(i orj : 1), and—I— (i
or j = 2). Class 0 correlations are distributed around 0, class — correl—
ations are distributed around an unknown negative mean and class —I—
correlations are distributed around an unknown positive mean. The
three classes are combined into the 3 by 3 class matrix in Figure 1d to
explain all correlation scenarios between the groups (Supplementary
Fig. S1) represented by wij. The DC scenarios are those on the off—di—
agonal of the class matrix (i.e. when the correlations are different be—
tween the groups). In the mixture model, the unobserved variable is
the class membership for each feature pair.

In the E—step, posterior probabilities are determined for each
class and group:

612(k) = P(wzi(k) = liar—1. lz11, lzzl) <3)

where k is the molecular feature pair, r the rib iteration, z1 and z2 are
the z scores for groups 1 and 2, 0 is the set of parameters
[111711271137 0'1,0'2,03701702703711712713la and 612(k) is the updated
posterior probability of molecular feature pair [a being in class w,,- in
iteration r. The posterior probabilities from the E—step are used for
the M—step to update the parameters (Supplementary Materials).
Once these are re—estimated, the likelihood is determined using the
density function in Equation (2):

K
L = Hriz1<k>,z2<k>i <4)
[2:1

After convergence of the EM algorithm (squared difference in
parameters <0.01), we report the summed differential coexpressed
posterior probabilities (i.e. off—diagonal in Fig. 1d):

P(DCk) = 261,303) (5)
(747'
To compare with the other methods described below, we sub—
tract the posterior probabilities from one.

2.3 Comparison of discordant to other methods

Leading methods, Fisher, linear interaction models and
EBcoexpress, were chosen to compare to the Discordant method.
These methods have a similar output to Discordant, which is a
P—value or posterior probability of a molecular feature pair being
DC. They were compared based on q—values and ranks from simula-
tions and biological validations, which are further explained below.

2.3.1 Fisher

The dissimilarity between Fisher—transformed z scores is measured
with the following statistic, which has an approximately normal dis-
tribution (Fisher, 1915 ).

z*: ZZ—Zl 

 

 

We report P—values from testing H0: z1 = zz versus H1: z1 75 z2.

2.3.2 Linear interaction model

Linear models were fit by regression of the feature 3) on main effects
of feature x, disease group and the interaction between x and disease
group. The follow linear model was used:

EM 2 0‘ +xﬂ1 +gﬂ2 +xgﬂ3 (7)

where ﬁ1 is the linear parameter for feature x, ﬁz is the group effect
and ﬁg, is the interaction term. Using lm() in R, significance of x and
y interactions between groups was evaluated by determining if the
interaction ﬁ3 had a significant contribution to the model. This term
indicates group specific slopes and would reﬂect DC.

Linear interaction models were only applied to Glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM) data because it is assumed that the independent
and dependent variables are respectively miRNAs and transcripts.
Because it is unknown what should be the dependent and independ—
ent variable for metabolites and transcripts, linear interaction mod—
els were not applied to the COPD data.

2.3.3 EBcoexpress

EBcoexpress is a bivariate mixture model for two groups to deter—
mine molecular feature pairs that are DC (Dawson and Kendziorski,
2012). EBcoexpress is based on a hierarchical model that uses
Empirical Bayes to estimate the posterior probabilities. Further ex—
planation on how initial parameters were chosen for EBcoexpress is
in Supplementary Materials. To compare EBcoexpress to the
Discordant and Fisher’s methods, the posterior probability for
equivalent coexpression was examined.

2.4 Validations

2.4.1 Simulations

Bivariate normal 11 by m matrices with 11 features and m samples were
first simulated using the function mvrnorm from R package MASS.
The means were set to 0 and the covariance matrix was a diagonal ma—
trix of 1. We assumed independence for all samples in groups and
across all features. The features were separated into two different sec—
tions, where these sections were treated as different types of —omics
data (Supplementary Fig. 82a). The Pearson’s correlation coefficients
were calculated (Supplementary Fig. S2b) and then they were swapped
to create pairs that simulate the nine different situations of Figure 1d
within the data (Supplementary Fig. 82c). This resulted in known DC
pairs, so we could observe how categorizing association types in
Discordant affected power compared with the other methods.

All methods were run on the simulated data and compared using a
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and sensitivity/specifi—
city by rank of P—values/1—posterior probabilities. Simulations were
run 100 times and results were averaged over the runs. The simula—
tions were altered to take into account how the methods were affected
by feature size, sample size, proportion of forced DC and correlation
method as summarized in Supplementary Table S1. We also ran the
simulations with a positive definite matrix for the covariance matrix
to account for relationships between features and found no qualitative
differences in the simulation results (data not shown).

2.4.2 Glioblastoma multiforme miRNA and transcriptomic data

From The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, http://cancergenome.nih.
gov/) we accessed normalized GBM miRNA and mRNA expression
data that had matched subjects (McLendon et al., 2008). This data—
set was selected because it had the largest sample size of organ-
specific control samples between the two arrays on TCGA. The
miRNA data was generated on an Agilent miRNA array and was
normalized using quantile normalization and available at TCGA.
The mRNA data was generated on custom Agilent 244K array and
normalized using lowess normalization. In the datasets, there are
470 miRNA and 90 797 mRNA. Grubbs’ outlier test (Grubbs,
1969) was used to eliminate any molecular features with outliers

that could skew correlation, which reduced the feature size to 331
miRNA and 72 656 mRNA (Grubbs’ P—value > 0.05). The number
of matched samples between the—omics datasets are 10 control
samples and 21 tumor samples.

Cancer—related miRNAs were accessed from multiMiR and
miRcancer (Ru et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2013). We collected miRNAs
on four cancers, including GBM as well as breast cancer, prostate
cancer and melanoma as negative controls. There were 47 total can—
cer—related miRNA for GBM, but only four were unique to GBM
and not occurring in any of the other cancers. After running each
method, the top rank, and respective P—value/posterior probability
and q—value of unique GBM—related miRNA—transcript pair was
reported.

2.4.3 COPD transcriptomic and metabolomic data

Through COPDGene (http://www.copdgene.org/), a nation—wide
genetic epidemiologic study, we were able to acquire metabolomic
and transcriptomic data from COPD patients. The peripheral blood
mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomic data was generated on the
Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 array and normalized by measuring
the geometric mean (Bahr et al., 2013). Metabolomic data from
plasma was processed and generated using LC/MS Agilent software
and tools and pre—processed and filtered using MSPrep (Bowler
et al., 2015; Hughes et al., 2014). Both datasets were filtered based
on Grubbs’ outlier test, leaving 38 852 transcripts and 1640 metab—
olites (Grubbs’ P—value > 0.05). COPDGene subjects were separated
by spirometry, which indicates the severity of COPD in a patient.
The control group contained subjects with normal spirometry
(FEV1/FVC > 0.7 and FEV1 percent predicted > 80% after broncho—
dilator) and disease group contained subjects with abnormal spirom—
etry (FEV1/FVC < 0.7 and FEV1 percent predicted < 50% after
bronchodilator). The final sample size for each group was control:
39 and COPD: 39.

Previous studies by COPDGene have implicated sphingolipids
and their related pathways in COPD (Bowler et al., 2015).
Sphingolipid—related metabolites were determined using ID Browser
in Mass Profiler Professional (MPP) software (Agilent).
Sphingolipid—related transcripts were determined using the Gene
Ontology to collect transcripts with a GO term related to sphingo—
lipids, and the probes acquired from Ensembl BioMart. The final
number of sphingolipid—related metabolites and transcripts is 37
and 188, respectively. We examined the top ranks and respective
P—values/posterior probability and q—values of the sphingolipid-
related feature pairs.

3 Results

We applied DC analysis to simulations and biological data to iden—
tify the ability for each method to determine true positives defined
by the simulations and identify pairs that have been previously vali—
dated in the respective phenotype. P—values and posterior probabil—
ities are not directly comparable, therefore, molecular feature pairs
were ranked by statistical significance for comparison by the re—
spective value depending on the method and ranked lists (Kall et al.,
2008), i.e. in order of increasing P—values and decreasing posterior
probabilities.

3.1 Simulations

The basic parameters for the simulations were sample size 20 for
both groups, 0.2 of feature pairs differentially correlated, 1000 pairs
and correlation measured with Pearson’s correlation coefficient.

Senstivity/1-Specifcity plot

These parameters were adjusted to determine if any would alter the
methods’ power (Supplementary Table S1).

Statistical performance of simulations was evaluated by observ—
ing the prediction of known true positives and true negatives. In the
ROC curve Discordant has more area under the curve (AUC) than
any of the methods, and Fishers, linear interaction models and
EBcoexpress have similar AUC (Fig. 2a). Sensitivity and specificity
were plotted to determine why the Discordant method has a better
ROC curve (Fig. 2b). Although specificity is the same for all three
methods, Discordant method performs better with respect to sensi—
tivity demonstrating that the Discordant method identifies more
true positives than the other methods.

The ROC curves and plots of sensitivity and specificity for ad—
justed parameters are in Supplementary Figures S3 and S4. From the
plots, change in sample size, the type of correlation used and the
number of forced DC pairs and feature pairs in the simulation did
not affect power except for disparate sample size in linear models.

To explore the predictions of paired correlation scenarios in the
class matrix (Fig. 1d), the distribution of the ranks for each class
was plotted in each method. As an example, for class 3, group 1 has
a positive correlation and in group 2 has a correlation close to 0
(Supplementary Fig. S5a), while in class 6, group 1 has a positive
correlation and group 2 has a negative correlation (Supplementary
Fig. SS b). In Supplementary Figure 85a the distribution of ranks for
Discordant is much smaller than Fisher or EBcoexpress, but in
Supplementary Figure SS b the distribution of ranks is similar across
all three methods. This affirms that binning in Discordant achieves
greater power for identifying differentially correlated pairs where
the correlation in one group is absent, whereas all methods identify
all the most extreme differential correlated pairs, i.e. negative in one
group and positive in the other group.

3.2 GBM miRNA and transcript pairs

3.2.1 Validation

The top ranks, P—values and q—values of the four unique GBM—
related miRNAs pairs in Discordant, EBcoexpress, Fisher, miRNA-
independent and transcript—independent linear interaction models
were examined (Supplementary Table S2). The mean and median of
these ranks are found in Table 1. It was found that Discordant had a
smaller mean and median rank than the other methods, indicating
that overall Discordant identifies unique GBM—related miRNAs ear—
lier than any other method. Furthermore, at q—value < 0.05
Discordant identified all four GBM—related miRNAs, whereas
EBcoexpress, Fisher and linear interaction models identify 3, 1
and 1, respectively. The top unique GBM—related miRNA pair,

The linear interaction models identify miRNAs at an earlier rank
than Discordant but the results are inconsistent between the linear
interaction models when the independent and dependent variables
are swapped (Supplementary Table S2). This was further confirmed
using a Wilcoxon Signed—rank test on the —log10(P—values) between
the two models (P—value < 0.05).

The frequency of GBM—related miRNAs and their associated
classes were compared in Discordant and Fishers to determine the
effect of binning on the analysis. It was found that the differentially
correlated pairs with a GBM—related miRNA were more likely to be
class 2 or 3, or disrupted DC, in Discordant (Fig. 3a.1), in contrast
to Fishers and EBcoexpress where there were some pairs that were
class 6 or 8, or cross DC (Fig. 3a.2 and 3a.3). Linear interaction
terms had a similar pattern to Fisher and EBcoexpress (data not
shown).

3.2.2 Known and novel targets

Pairs with Discordant posterior probability > 0.99 were used to in-
vestigate which features had the most connections, or hubs. The top
four genes that were the biggest hubs with over 30 connections are:
AGAP2, CRY2, GRIN1 and UPF3A (Supplementary Table S3).
Most of these genes have functions that are central to the brain,
where GBM occurs. AGAP2 is an Arf GAP that has anti—apoptotic
effects of nerve growth factor (Inoue and Randazzo, 2007), CRY2 is
a circadian rhythm gene that principally is localized in the brain,
GRIN1 is a ligand—gated ion channel that facilitates signals through
neurons (Wahlsten, 1999). UPF3A is found in the UPF complex that
is implicated in pathways altered in cancer such as post—splicing,
mRNA decay and nuclear export (Dreyfuss et al., 2002). None of
these genes have been implicated in GBM.

The miRNA hsa-miR-545 was the biggest hub connected to 39
genes, which is visualized in Figure 4a. hsa—miR—545 has not been
found to be involved in GBM. Ten of the connected genes are anno—
tated as being transmembrane proteins, and three of these are serine/
threonine kinases (CDC2L2, PDPK1 and BMPR2). Tyrosine kinases
have been found to be involved in GBM and are similar to serine/
threonine kinases (Hamza and Gilbert, 2014).

genes was acquired, and the top rank and respective P—value/posterior
probability and q—value when sphingolipid—related pairs identified by
the three methods was evaluated (Supplementary Table S4). In
Table 1, it was found that the median sphingolipid-related pair rank
is smaller for Discordant compared with EBcoexpress and Fisher.
EBcoexpress’ mean rank is smaller than Discordant, but only by 2e4
where the median rank between Discordant and EBcoexpress differs
by 1e5. The expected mean and median rank of non-phenotype
related features that were randomly chosen was 3.6e5 and 2.6e5, less
than sphingolipid pairs. This may be reﬂecting the quality of the valid—
ation set (Section 4). At q—value < 0.10 Discordant identified 146
sphingolipid pairs, whereas EBcoexpress identified 1 and Fisher 0.
Similarly to GBM, the findings here indicate that overall Discordant
identifies sphingolipid—related feature pairs earlier than the other two
methods. The top ranked sphingolipid—related metabolite—transcript
pair determined by Discordant, a sphingenine and PSAPL1, is plotted
in Supplementary Figure S8. Unlike GBM, the ranks are much later in
the hundred thousands. This may indicate that although the sphingo—
lipid pathway could be relevant to COPD, there may be other path—
ways that contribute to the complexity of the disease that may appear
earlier on in the ranked list.

Because the sphingolipid pathway is not as significantly differen-
tially coexpressed in COPD as the GBM—related miRNAs were in
GBM, instead we examined the classes of sphingolipid—related me—
tabolite and gene pairs that were in the top ranked 100 000 pairs.

The discordant method: a novel approach for differential correlation

We found that Discordant identified relatively more disrupted
classes than EBcoexpress or Fisher (Fig. 3b).

3.3.2 Known and novel targets

Molecular features that had the largest hubs were identified and
listed in Supplementary Table S5. IGHG1, or immunoglobulin
heavy constant gamma 1 is considered a true positive since immun-
ity plays a central role in COPD (Rovina et al., 2013). Another gene
identified as a hub is SARDH, or sarcosine dehydrogenase which
has been implicated previously in COPD (Ubhi et al., 2012). The
metabolite that has the largest hub has yet to be formally annotated;
its chemical formula is C20 H33 N9 P2 S. The other metabolite that
was a large hub is L—Valine, a metabolite involved in multiple bio-
chemical pathways.

Genes connected to L—Valine were investigated using DAVID to
determine if they were enriched in a biological pathway that is impli-
cated in COPD (Huang et al., 2008, 2009). The ubiquitin mediated
proteolysis KEGG pathway was enriched in the L-Valine differential
coexpressed gene set with q—value:0.001. In Figure 4b the genes
involved in this pathway are highlighted from the rest of the other
genes, which total to 17 out of 1667 in the gene set. In previous
studies, the ubiquitin protease degradation pathway has been associ—
ated with COPD (Ottenheijm et al., 2006).

4 Discussion

We have presented the Discordant method for identifying DC pairs.
Discordant categorizes the paired coexpression scenarios by
‘binning’, enabling it to determine more DC pairs than the other
methods and improves power of detecting disrupted interactions.
Binning not only improves performance for the Discordant method
but also facilitates biological interpretation of results. As seen in
Figure 3, Discordant identifies more disrupted DC pairs than
EBcoexpress and Fisher, a trend also found in the simulations
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Discordant also identifies more significant
phenotype—related feature pairs in general for both GBM and
COPD.

The GBM dataset produced more significant DC results for
phenotype—related features than the COPD dataset. The GBM valid—
ation set is well curated because there are experimentally validated
miRNAs involved in GBM, whereas for COPD there is less known
about the molecular pathways. The sphingolipid—related genes and
metabolites were determined by annotation for being in sphingolipid
pathways, because there is limited experimental data for specific genes
and metabolites. Despite the challenges of the COPD dataset, we did
observe that sphingolipid metabolite—gene pairs were identified earlier
in Discordant than EBcoexpress and Fisher (Table 1) and that there
were more sphingolipid metabolite—gene pairs in the top 100 000 pairs
in Discordant than EBcoexpress and Fisher (Fig. 3).

Both GBM and COPD have promising results of known and
novel targets from Discordant. This confirms Discordant’s ability to
identify phenotype—related biological processes and indicates the po—
tential that Discordant can produce further testable hypotheses.

A similar method is to apply linear models with interaction
terms. One of the benefits of linear models is that it assumes condi—
tional normality instead of joint normality, meaning that the de—
pendent variable can be non—normal. Linear models identified
GBM-related miRNA pairs in earlier ranks than Discordant in the
GBM data, but linear models can be difficult to use since it is un—
clear what should be the dependent and independent variable. We
explored this by switching miRNA and transcript as the dependent
and independent variable and we found it changed the results. We

also found that the ranks of unique GBM—related miRNA pairs were
different between the two analyses. It is highly suggested to only use
linear models if it is known what is the independent and dependent
variable, such as miRNA and transcript, respectively.

In terms of run-time, Fisher is notably faster than the rest of the
methods, EBcoexpress is the slowest and Linear and Discordant
only differ slightly (Supplementary Table S5). The Big O notation
for Fisher is linear, O(n), where n is the number of feature pairs. For
the linear interaction model and Discordant it is polynomial, O(n2)
and O(2n —l— 3112). The Big O notation for EBcoexpress is not as sim—
ple to identify since there are nested EM algorithms. EBcoexpress
runs about 3—fold longer than Discordant in the GBM and COPD
datasets and it also requires a grid approach to determine hyper-
parameters. Although Discordant does not run faster than Fisher
and its run—time is comparable to linear interaction models, it still
performs either equally or better with consistent results.

There are some limitations to Discordant. We assume independ—
ence between pairs, which is not true since features show up in mul—
tiple pairs. This assumption is critical to reducing computational
complexity, and has been made by others (Dawson et al., 2012).
Appropriate sample size is necessary for Discordant or any other
DC method to work effectively to accurately estimate r between two
features. Finally, the model assumes there are three Gaussian com—
ponents in the mixture model. To explore the Gaussian assumption,
we suggest that users apply the R package mixtools or lcmix, which
can assess alternative or non—parametric densities (Benaglia et al.,
2009, Dvorkin et al., 2013). Assuming the Gaussian case, we then
recommend users to first run a mixture model fitting method (such
as mclust) on each group to check that there is more than one mix-
ture component (12 > 1) by comparing the Bayesian Information
Content (BIC) for different values of 12. For the simulations and
GBM, we found evidence of k > 1, while for COPD there was less
evidence (data not shown) which is not unexpected considering the
more challenging nature of that dataset.

Future directions for the Discordant method is to add more
classes (—— and +—I—) that would contain correlation coefficients
that were highly negative and highly positive to identify cases where
there is a stronger linear association in one group versus the other. A
challenge with adding these extra classes is that increasing the num—
ber of classes and parameters also increases complexity, which
means longer run—time. We also want to investigate using discrete
data, such as counts from RNA—Seq experiments.

Overall, when investigating DC pairs, Discordant performs well
with respect to usability and accuracy. EBcoexpress, the most analo—
gous method to Discordant, was not originally developed to investigate
large —omics datasets, so it is possible that it could be optimized for
that purpose. The Fisher method has short run—time but does not per—
form as well as similar methods. Linear interactions terms are effective,
but should only be used when the dependent and independent variable
are known when used to integrate different types of —omics data. The
Discordant method fills in the drawbacks to all of these methods, in
addition to providing a binning of results for easier interpretation.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has extensively been
used in cancer genome studies; however, the use of WES data in
the study of loss of heterozygosity or more generally allelic imbalance
(Al) has so far been very limited, which highlights the need for user-
friendly and flexible software that can handle low-quality datasets. We
have developed a statistical approach, ExomeAI, for the detection of
recurrent Al events using WES datasets, speciﬁcally where matched
normal samples are not available.

Availability: ExomeAI is a web-based application, publicly available
at: http://genomequebec.mcgill.ca/exomeai.

1 INTRODUCTION

In cancer, recurrent genomic aberrations are highly likely to
affect oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that drive cancer
progression. One efﬁcient way to identify such aberrations is to
investigate genomic proﬁle of allelic imbalance (AI) simultan-
eously across the genomes of a number of similar tumor samples.
Detection of AI is based on the study of the relative proportion
of the two alleles (A and B) at heterozygous sites Wong et al.,
2004). In a diploid normal heterozygous locus, the expected
frequency of the B allele is 0.5 (1:1 ratio). AI is deﬁned as a
signiﬁcant deviation from this proportion. The genotypes, B,
AAB, BB, which show loss of heterozygosity (LOH), duplication
and copy-neutral LOH, respectively, are examples of AI. The
ﬁrst two cases are also examples of Copy Number Aberrations
(CNA).

To date, investigation of AI/LOH in cancer studies has mainly
been based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping
or comparative genomic hybridization arrays and the potential
of WES data has not been fully exploited. To our knowledge,
there is no publicly available software for identiﬁcation of
recurrent genomic AI segments, using WES data, shared across
multiple tumor-only samples (Liu et al., 2013). To address the
limitation, we developed a novel software, ExomeAI, which can

detect recurrent AI across cancer genomes by analyzing batches
of WES data, and speciﬁcally in the absence of matched normal
samples. We recently applied our approach to different cancer
types [e. g. Small-Cell Carcinoma of the Ovary Hypercalcemic
Type, WVitkowski et al., 2014), gliomas and renal cell carcinoma
(our unpublished data)] and successfully identiﬁed recurrent AI
regions. To facilitate the analysis for non-computational cancer
researchers, using Galaxy platform (Goecks et al., 2010), we
implemented our approach and developed a user-friendly web
application.

2 METHODS

As shown in Supplementary Figure S1, ExomeAI gets a batch of tumor
Variant Call Format ﬁles, as input (see Supplementary information for an
alternative format). Using preset quality ﬁlters on variants, it converts
read counts for each variant to B-allele frequency (BAF), where BAF is
the number of reads with the non-reference base at the variant site divided
by the total read count. Since only heterozygous variants are informative
in A1 detection, only variants with BAF values from 0.05 to 0.95 (default
values) will be used as heterozygous variants for further analysis. The
expected BAF in a normal sample is 0.5 (one copy of B and one copy of
A). The absolute deviation of BAF values (dBAF) from the expected
value (dBAF = |BAF—0.5|) is used for segmentation and segment-wise
calling. Segments of similar dBAF values are detected using circular
binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm Wenkatraman and Olshen,
2007). The CBS algorithm is applied to each arm of all chromosomes.
For segment-wise calling, where matched samples are not available, the
dBAF values of each segment can be compared with a ﬁxed threshold.
Although a ﬁxed cutoff approach has been used successfully for
SNP arrays (Staaf et al., 2008), the proper threshold may vary for
WES datasets with different qualities (e. g. varying sequencing depths).
We propose a two-step approach: We ﬁrst call AI at each variant over the
genome using a binomial test (Sathirapongsasuti et al., 2011) and we
calculate the mean dBAF values for non-AI variants. In the
second step, a Wilcoxon signed rank test is performed to evaluate the
distribution of dBAF in each segment (see Supplementary information
for details).

One of the main issues in AI or CNA calling is false positives, which
gets even more challenging when the matched normal sample is not avail-
able. In cancer analysis, it is desirable to remove candidate segments that
may either represent common Copy Number Variations (CNVs) or tech-
nology or alignment artifacts. In order to remove false positives calls, we
created a control database of 500 non-cancer WES samples (the database
is kept updated). The statistically signiﬁcant AI segments will then be
compared with the control database to ﬁnd the number of hits within
the database. By default, ExomeAI counts each overlap of the control
database with more than 50% of the query segment as one hit. In the next
step, the signiﬁcant segments that were not seen (or seen less than a given

frequency) in the control database will be used to ﬁnd the recurrent AI.
The output of this ﬁnal step will be a list of identiﬁed segments with
names and number of tumor samples that share the segment
(Supplementary Table S2) along with the plots of the segments for
each chromosome (Supplementary Figs S6 and S7).

3 IMPLEMENTATION AND EXAMPLES

The development of ExomeAI method has been motivated by
the need to detect the recurrent AI using WES dataset of tumor-
only SCCOHT samples. By applying this method, we showed
that 19p were deleted in all patients with SMARCA4 mutations
WVitkowski et al., 2014). Since then, we have successfully
applied our method to several other cancer types such as
glioma, renal cell carcinoma (unpublished data) and ETMR
(Kleinman et al., 2014) (see Supplementary information) and
showed that the approach is sensitive to clearly detect the recur-
rent AI across cancer genomes, in the absence of paired normal
samples.

As we believe that the approach has a wide application in
cancer genome research and in order to make it publically avail-
able to non-computational cancer researchers, we developed a
web-based application facilitated by Galaxy platform (Goecks
et al., 2010) which is platform for biomedical genomic research.
ExomeAI server is equipped with two 3.4-GHz Intel processors
(a total of 8 cores/ 16 threads), 32 GB of RAM, and 10 TB of disc
space, and is accessible through http://genomequebec.mcgill.ca/
exomeai.

4 EVALUATION USING SIMULATED DATA

In order to evaluate the accuracy of the method, we created a
simulated dataset using 10 real non-cancer Exomes (not included
in the control database) and we added over 600 CNAs on 22
autosomal chromosomes (hg19). Ranging in length, size and
copy number, CNVs were randomly located on genome.
Simulated aberrations included all combinations of : length
(Mb) = [1,3,5,10,15,20], copy number = [1,3] and non-aber-
rant/normal DNA fraction (%) = [5,10,20,30,40,50].

We analyzed the simulated dataset using ExomeAI and four
other softwares: SomatiCA, ExomeCNV (LOH analysis),
XHMM and CoNIF ER. For the methods that required matched
normal samples (ExomeCNV and SomatiCA), samples before
adding simulated CNAs were used as matched normal samples.
For all softwares, default parameters were used (see supplemen-
tary information for details).

Sensitivity was calculated as the overlap of identiﬁed CNAs
with true simulated ones divided by the total length of simulated
CNAs. Speciﬁcity was calculated as TN/(TN + F P), where TN is
the length of True Negative and F P is the length of False Positive
regions at single base resolution.

Supplementary Figure S8 shows the sensitivity and speciﬁcity
of all ﬁve softwares averaged over all Exomes (n = 10). The
Circos plot (Supplementary Fig. S9) depicts the results for all
methods across the genome of one simulated Exome. As
shown in Supplementary Table S3, ExomeAI achieved a
sensitivity of 0.76 with speciﬁcity >0.99. Using matched
normal samples, SomatiCA could achieve a higher sensitivity
(0.82); however, its speciﬁcity was lower (0.97).

In general, the softwares that were primarily developed for
CNA detection in cancer (ExomeAI, ExomeCNV and
SomatiCA) showed higher power to detect CNA. It was at
least partially because ExomeCNV and SomatiCA used matched
normal samples and ExomeAI used the internal control
database. CoNIFER and XHMM had very similar results. The
sensitivities of the two software were low in the simulated
dataset, which is consistent with previous studies (Tan et al.,
2014); however, they may perform better when CNVs are more
homogeneous and are present only in a low proportion of
samples.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We present a novel web application for detection of recurrent
LOH or, more generally, AI events across batches of tumor-only
WES datasets. We show that ExomeAI can be effectively applied
in various cancer types. Using a control database of non-cancer
samples, ExomeAI overcomes the limitation of the ‘obligatory’
usage of matched normal samples and efﬁciently reduces the
rate of false positive calls. Working on multiple samples and
looking for recurrent events further reduce the chance of
false positives. In case where some of the samples have
matched-normal counterparts, the recurrent aberrations can be
further studied in those samples using other softwares which
have been well reviewed elsewhere (Liu et al., 2013; Alkodsi
et al., 2014).

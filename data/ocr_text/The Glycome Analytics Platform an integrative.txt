Abstract

Motivation: Complex carbohydrates play a central role in cellular communication and in disease
development. 0— and N—glycans, which are post—translationally attached to proteins and lipids, are
sugar chains that are rooted, tree structures. Independent efforts to develop computational tools
for analyzing complex carbohydrate structures have been designed to exploit specific databases
requiring unique formatting and limited transferability. Attempts have been made at integrating
these resources, yet it remains difficult to communicate and share data across several online re—
sources. A disadvantage of the lack of coordination between development efforts is the inability of
the user community to create reproducible analyses (workflows). The latter results in the more ser—
ious unreliability of glycomics metadata.

Results: In this paper, we realize the significance of connecting multiple online glycan resources
that can be used to design reproducible experiments for obtaining, generating and analyzing cell
glycomes. To address this, a suite of tools and utilities, have been integrated into the analytic func—
tionality of the Galaxy bioinformatics platform to provide a Glycome Analytics Platform (GAP).
Using this platform, users can design in silico workflows to manipulate various formats of glycan
sequences and analyze glycomes through access to web data and services. We illustrate the central
functionality and features of the GAP by way of example; we analyze and compare the features of
the N—glycan glycome of monocytic cells sourced from two separate data depositions.

This paper highlights the use of reproducible research methods for glycomics analysis and the
GAP presents an opportunity for integrating tools in glycobioinformatics.

used to determine the sequence and structure of glycans (Raman
et al., 2006; Ranzinger et al., 2015; Satomaa et al., 2009); while the
specificity of glycan binding is analyzed by glycan arrays (Heimburg-
Molinaro et al., 2011) or lectin microarrays (Hirabayashi et al., 2013)
and computational methods in informatics and machine learning
techniques are used to identify glycans and categorize their complex-
ity (Li et al., 2010).

While a chemically rigorous definition of carbohydrates is given
elsewhere (McNaught, 1997) that is not of relevance here.
Compared with DNA, RNA and proteins, which are composed of
nucleotides and amino acids, a glycan is structurally and conforma—
tionally more complex.

The alphabets between these biomolecules differ. The 4 DNA
monomers are the nucleotides derived from the A, C, T, G bases and
the protein alphabet consists of 20 amino acids. The glycan alphabet
is large. The monosaccharide database (http://www.monosacchari
dedb.0rg/start.action) catalogues 776 monomers, GlyTouCan
(Aoki-Kinoshita et al., 2015) the international glycan structure re—
pository lists 800 monomers and the Bacterial Carbohydrate
Structure Database (http://csdb.glyc0science.ru/bacteriall) registers
357 bacterial glycan monomers. Comparing the bacterial and mam-
malian registries of monosaccharides (Herget et al., 2008) reveals
that bacteria have a much greater monomer diversity than humans.
By defining the glycan alphabet in terms of the basetype (essentially
the variation of the core, see formal definition in the reference
(Herget et al., 2008)) of a monosaccharide the human glycan alpha-
bet consists of 14 monomers which is similar to that reported by
Cummings, who suggests that the diversity in human glycans stems
from merely 9 monomers (Cummings, 2009). While the human gly-
can alphabet is small in number (9), the complexity in glycan struc—
ture comes from the multiple linkages possible between monomers,
the stereochemical possibilities for each linkage as well as the con—
formational flexibility of the monomers themselves. This complexity
is evident by comparing the 9 combinatorial possibilities when link-
ing three different amino acids to as many as 27 648 possibilities
from three different monosaccharides (Laine, 2008).

A final level of complexity is the synthesis of glycans. Unlike
DNA and protein synthesis, glycan synthesis is non—templated.
Protein enzymes are responsible for glycan synthesis. Glycosyl trans—
ferases extend glycans by adding monomers to existing glycans,
while Glycosyl Hydrolases lyse glycosidic linkages and divide gly—
cans into smaller sections. The activity of these enzymes is influ-
enced by factors including cellular metabolism, life stage and
nutrient availability (Walt et al., 2012).

There are a number of well—developed, interoperable, robust
tools and databases for gene and protein analysis (Brooksbank et al.,
2003; Goecks et al., 2010; Smedley et al., 2009). This is due in part
to the templated synthesis of these polymers that make relatively r0—
bust methods for synthesis (notably PCR) and sequencing possible.
The combined effect of the biochemical synthesis and conformation—
ally complex, multi—branched nature of glycans makes the purifica—
tion, extraction and computational analysis of the structural data
far more challenging than in genomics and proteomics (Campbell
et al., 2014a; Raman et al., 2006; Ranzinger et al., 2008). Some
tools developed for the genomic and proteomic paradigm have been
applied to glycomics and used in the design and insertion of N-
glycosylation sites on proteins (Mazola et al., 2011).

Although limited efforts have been made to bridge glycomics
with other fields, glycobioinformatics remains hamstrung by the
complexity and diversity of oligosaccharide structures (Campbell
et al., 2014a). Superimposed on this is lack of sustained support
from funding agencies for the development of glycomics methods

and data repositories. The development of glycomics methods there—
fore relies upon independent and sporadically funded efforts. The re—
sulting databases and toolsets therefore lack interlinks between
similar and related tools. More serious is the lack of an emergent set
of developmental standards amongst databases. Major online re—
sources such as Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG)
(Raman et al., 2006), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) (Hashimoto et al., 2006), GlycomeDB (Ranzinger et al.,
2008, 2011), Resource for Informatics of Glycomes at Soka
(RINGS) (Akune et al., 2010) and UnicarbKB (Campbell et al.,
2014b) store glycan data, translate between various formats and
provide other useful tools.

A comprehensive overview of glycan sequence formats and data—
bases has recently been reviewed, (Campbell et al., 2014a) the limi-
tations in current glycomics recognized and partial solutions
proposed. For example, GlycomeDB (Ranzinger et al., 2011) is de—
signed to be a single web portal that provides access to glycan struc—
tures from several databases while UnicarbKB (Campbell et al.,
2014b) is a curated open access resource derived from EuroCarbDB
that is itself a collaboration of several databases. Many web portals
do not provide machine—readable web services; subsequently the
Working Group on Glycomics Database Standards (WGGDS) initi—
ated (i) the development of standards for inputs and outputs of gly—
comics web services and (ii) the development of guidelines to report
glycomics data (Campbell et al., 2014a; York et al., 2014). The
Resource Description Format (RDF) is a model for exchanging data
on the web that uses subject—predicate—object expressions (triples) to
express formal naming and to describe relationships between pieces
of information. The glycan RDF subgroup defined GlycoRDF, an
ontology used for exporting glycomics data via the Semantic web
(Ranzinger et al., 2015). The SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query
Language (SPARQL) along with the RDF Query Language is used
to query the RDF data from curated endpoints (Aoki-Kinoshita
et al., 2013a,b). The GlyTouCan (https://glyt0ucan.org/) initiative
aims to standardize glycan data that will result in an accessible inter—
national glycan structure repository (Aoki—Kinoshita et al., 2015).

Conducting an in silico systems biology experiment requires ac—
cess to data repositories, computational tools and a knowledge base
to connect these resources (Oinn et al., 2004). Access to remote web
services and ensuring reproducibility of computational experiments
requires a working knowledge of computer scripting and program-
ming. Workflows (Goecks et al., 2010) are useful for streamlining
data analysis where a repeatable process describing the organization
of the individual steps can be automated. Computational analyses
encompass tasks that retrieve data, transform or analyze it followed
by a visualization of the results (Goble et al., 2010). Workflows im—
plemented in Taverna (Oinn et al., 2004), Knime (Berthold et al.,
2008) and Galaxy (Goecks et al., 2010) annotate each part of a
computational experiment, that include the data source, data ma—
nipulation steps and assembly of necessary tools and parameters in a
reusable template. Galaxy (Goecks et al., 2010) provides a manage—
ment system that requires no prior programming and web services
experience. The workﬂows created on platforms such as this can be
published using social research platforms such as myExperiment
(Goble et al., 2010).

2 Methods and implementation

Efforts to characterize glycomes make apparent the inherent gaps in
accessibility to software, resources and databases. Methods to in—
crease the reproducibility of in silico analysis are not widely

The Glycome Analytics Platform

 

available. To address this, a single glycomics platform that is inter-
operable with multiple remote data sources and tools, provides tools
for the design of reproducible and cohesive workflows, provides
data sharing and addresses multiple glycan formats has been de—
veloped. This model relies on remote web resources that conform to
web standards and provide a machine friendly web interface for
sharing data and services. A REST or SOAP interface, or SPARQL
endpoint provides effective programmatic access to web services.
We recommend that all sites provide a web service interface with a
standard API. Although web automation software techniques
(‘screen scraping’) provide interaction with simple HTML websites,
websites designed using AJAX, Java and JavaScript are not easily
automated.

We have identified Galaxy as an existing open—source bioinfor-
matics platform that meets these requirements. Galaxy is an open—
source, web platform that incorporates workﬂow technology and
in—built access to bioinformatics resources including remote data
warehouses and tools. Several public instances of Galaxy are avail—
able and it can be installed locally or in the cloud. These multiple in-
stallation options denote that Galaxy is able to accommodate
varying user requirements, for example — data security, no IT experi—
ence and no network transfer of data (depends on tools used). The
Public Galaxy Toolshed is an appstore that hosts repositories con—
taining Galaxy Tools, Galaxy Data Managers, custom Galaxy
Datatypes and exported Galaxy Workflows. The Toolshed supplies
tools to Galaxy and provides tool developers with a framework and
common repository for sharing, updating and managing tools. To
ensure that Galaxy is able to execute custom tools in a robust man—
ner, a developer describes the underlying function of their custom
tool via an XML framework contained in a tool definition file.
Recently, a suite of open—source chemistry and cheminformatics

tools (Open Babel (O’Boyle et al., 2011)) has been integrated into
Galaxy as part of the ChemicalToolbox (Lucas et al., 2015 ).

We have created the GAP, Figure 1, which integrates existing
glycoinformatics tools and resources along with our own glycomics
utilities into the Galaxy platform. It contains tools for getting data
listed under the ‘GAP Get Data’ heading, tools for manipulating
data (‘GAP Manipulate’), tools for joining or grouping data (‘GAP
Join, Subtract’), tools for converting between formats (‘GAP
Convert’) and tools for extracting features from sets of glycans
(‘GAP Glycome Features’).

We designed GAP by identifying glycan formats and web services
pertinent to the analysis of cellular glycomes. This includes
command-line Python scripts to interactively retrieve data from web
services and in—house tools and utilities for glycan format manipula-
tion. Wrapper XML scripts integrate these tools into Galaxy that
are bundled together and installed to a Galaxy Instance via the
Galaxy ToolShed. The XML scripts comprise Python module re—
quirements that are automatically installed into a Python Virtual
Environment. Testing was done using Python 2.7. While GAP can
be used independently and is transferable to other workﬂow plat—
forms, explicit interfaces and datatypes have been written for inte—
gration into Galaxy. Therefore these tools interoperate and function
best on a Galaxy server with internet access.

Sources of individual glycan data as well as cell and tissue related
glycomes are available from the CFG and databases such as KEGG,
the GlycoGene Databank (Narimatsu, 2004), Glycosciences.de
(Lutteke et al., 2006) and GlycomeDB (Ranzinger et al., 2008,
2011). The CFG contains glycan profiling, glycan array, gene-
microarray and mouse phenotyping data. The glycan profiling data
is derived from experiments that have used MALDI mass spectrom—
etry and other analyses to characterize glycans from glycoconjugates

in cells and tissues. N—glycan, O—glycan, polar and non-polar glycoli-
pid data from Human, Mouse and Chinese Hamster is available.
The data from the CFG can be either manually accessed or via the
‘Get CFG’ tool within the GAP. The KEGG database contains nu—
merous databases of systems, genomic, chemical and health infor-
mation, for example KEGG GLYCAN, KEGG GENE, KEGG
ENZYME, KEGG REACTION and KEGG PATHWAY. These are
readily accessed through KEGG’s REST interface that allows remote
programmatic to its databases.

To illustrate KEGG’s remote data manipulation and access via
the GAP (Fig. 2), we build a workﬂow to access KEGG and search
for glycan entries in KEGG GLYCAN that are related to the
Enzyme ST6Ga11 (Beta—galactosamide alpha—2,6—sialyltransferase)
found in KEGG ENZYME. The KEGG database cross—referencing
tool is used to search for ‘ec: 2.4.99.1’ and return any glycans
related to this enzyme. The glycan sequence data can then be down—
loaded in KEGG Chemical Function (KCF) format. Images of the
glycan sequence can be created using ‘KCF to Image’. Following
this, variations in the glycan structures can be analyzed using tools
such as MCAW (discussed later).

2.1 Data types and conversion

Glycans are considered as rooted, labelled, ordered tree structures
(Aoki-Kinoshita, 2013a,b). Glycan sequence data is encoded using
various formats and often contains ambiguous structures and re—
peating unit. These features cannot be encoded by all glycan formats
(Campbell et al., 2014a). There are several formats that linearize the
glycan (IUPAC, LinearCode, LINUCS), while connection table
approaches are also used (KEGG KCF, GlycoCT) and XML based
formats (GlydeII, GlycoCT XML) have been adopted (Campbell
et al., 2014a). Recently the Web3 Unique Representation of
Carbohydrate Structures (WURCS) format has been introduced.
WURCS follows Semantic web guidelines and includes: (i) a linear
notation which can be used as a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)

   

if needed and (ii) a unique notation such that any published glycan
structure can be represented distinctively (Tanaka et al., 2014).

We have designed support for the following glycan formats (data
types) in Galaxy, KEGG KCF, GLYDEII, GlycoCT, GlycoCT
(XML), LINUCS, LinearCode, WURCS, IUPAC (condensed) and
MSA (annotated mass spec—contains LinearCode).

Galaxy is able to automatically deduce the type of input data
using a ‘sniffer’ function; this function identifies signatures of a par—
ticular format for identification. We have designed ‘sniffer’ func—
tions for each glycan data type. Initially the data is sent to the
RINGS webservice. If this is unavailable then a simple file signature
recognition code is called for each type. Failing this the user can up—
load data with the correct data type suffix, e.g. ‘.iupac’, or specify
the type. Data can be directly uploaded or copy—pasted into Galaxy
using ‘Get Data’. For example uploaded annotated mass spec pro—
files are automatically assigned as ‘.msa’ datatype. Only the tools
that support the ‘.msa’ datatype as an input will show this data in
their input selection panel.

Glycan builder (integrated with UnicarbKB) illustrates and inter—
converts between several glycan formats (for example it can import
BCSDB and export GlycoCT XML format) (Damerell et al., 2012).
The RINGS web resource includes utilities for converting between
glycan formats. There is a new converter tool which supports mul—
tiple format interconversions and specific interconversion utilities,
for example ‘LinearCode to KCF’ and ‘KCF to image’. Other re—
sources are available (c.f. Table 3 (Campbell et al., 2014a)) and we
provide interfaces to these tools.

2.2 Analyzing glycomes

Glycan Miner is an efficient method for mining motifs or significant
subtrees from a set of glycans that provides the novel ability to mine
closed frequent subtrees (Aoki—Kinoshita, 2013a,b). This functional-
ity depends on the definition of a support and a screening factor
(alpha) to modulate the properties of the subtrees mined from the

set of glycans. For a given set of glycans G, the support of a glycan g
is the number of glycans containing g. The glycan g is considered fre—
quent if its support is greater or equal to a cut off value viz, the min-
imum support (minsup). The minsup value represents the (integer)
number of glycans (Aoki—Kinoshita, 2013a, b; Hashimoto et al.,
2008)

A shortcoming of this mining algorithm is that the subtree
frequency depends on the distribution of monosaccharides.
Subsequently high frequency subtrees do not adequately represent
structural significance. Thus, a control dataset gets generated from
the input dataset and is used to predict and rank the significance of
the mined subtree patterns (Aoki—Kinoshita, 2013a,b; Hashimoto
et al., 2008).

Multiple Carbohydrate Alignment with Weights (MCAW) aligns
glycans using a tree alignment algorithm (Hosoda et al., 2012).
From an input of several glycans in KCF format (Hashimoto et al.,
2006), MCAW applies a pairwise glycan comparison algorithm and
progressively builds a multiple glycan alignment. This Profile KCF
(PKCF) alignment contains information on the alignment order, pos—
ition and state of each node in the tree. The PKCF is rendered as an
aligned glycan profile image presenting statistics of the alignment
order, position and state of each node such that common patterns in
the set of glycans can be identified. Multiple profiles can be com—
pared to reveal glycan recognition patterns across differing
glycomes.

The Glycoviewer (http://www.glycoviewer.babs.unsw.edu.au/)
(Joshi et al., 2010) produces similar multiple tree analysis to
MCAW but is not included in this implementation. This is because
it requires glycan sequences in IUPAC format that have fully speci—
fied linkage information and so does not function efficiently when
input data has multiple unknown linkage information.

2.3 Additional utilities
To maintain all analyses as steps of a workflow inside of Galaxy,
additional utilities were designed and implemented that overcome
error conditions resulting from inconsistent glycan data formatting.
This is required to maintain reproducible computational analyses.
We include a tool to extract LinearCode data from .msa files
(supports several versions of the msa file format specification). This
tool corrects format inconsistencies in the Linear Code, for example
spaces and missing outer brackets. The KCF format has the flexibil-
ity to include complex ENTRY specifications or multiple
REFERENCE and COMPOSITION entries this leads to the mal—
functioning of several analysis tools. The GAP has the functionality
that simplifies KCF by returning only the ENTRY NODE and
EDGE specifications and a tool for renaming and numbering the
ENTRY section.

2.4 Comparing sets of glycans

When comparing sets of glycans (virtual glycomes) the Miner tool is
used to distinguish common subtrees in each set and the MCAW
tool to overview the similarities and differences throughout the
leaves and the core. Nevertheless, even when summarized, the com—
plexity and multitude of glycans in a set can easily overwhelm the
user and reduce the usefulness of a particular analysis.

Our approach for comparing the glycan sets A, B is as follows.
Remove duplicate glycans in each set and return the unique sets A,
B. Determine the glycans that are in common between these sets by
the intersection set AﬂB. Determine the glycans unique to A and
unique to B by the relative differences A—B and B—A. Miner and
MCAW analysis of the glycans in the relative difference sets A—B

and B—A then more clearly presents the unique and significant fea—
tures of these glycomes.

2.5 Creation of glycomics workflows

During exploratory analyses an environment that favors ad hoc
discovery rather than predefined pipelines is preferred. This is sup—
ported within the GAP Galaxy implementation where the process
is simplified through the generation of workﬂows from user histor—
ies. The dynamic exploration and analysis of data (user history)
can be bundled into re—usable and shared workﬂows (predefined
analysis pipelines). This was the method used to create a Simple
Glycome Analysis workflow (Supplementary Fig. S1A). There, gly-
can msa data is loaded, converted to Linear Code, converted to
KCF, cleaned. This data was then converted to an image.
Duplicates were removed and a MCAW and Miner analysis was
carried out.

An additional workﬂow was created for the comparison of two
glycome datasets (Supplementary Fig. S1B). First, the Simple
Glycome Analysis workflow is applied to both datasets to yield two
sets containing unique glycan data. These are inputs for the new
analysis. The intersection and relative difference of these sets is cal—
culated, images of the glycans are created and MCAW and Miner
analyses are carried out.

3 Results

Glycomes comprised of N—glycans from healthy human monocytic
cells were analyzed. These were obtained from the CFG (N—Glycans
from Human Monocytes, Paul Crocker, cfg_rRequest_1686,
10000006.msa and N—Glycans from Human Monocytes, Yvette Van
Kooyk, cfg_rRequest_1687, 10000432.msa). These datasets are not
duplicative and the cells were sourced from different laboratories.
The data were loaded into Galaxy and the simple glycome analysis
workﬂow was applied to both datasets. An additional workﬂow for
comparing these sets was then applied. A MCAW and miner ana-
lysis were carried out on the common glycans (intersection set) and
on the glycans specific to the Crocker set.

There are 26 unique glycans (all have a unique sequence) in the
Crocker set (excluding the ambiguously attached fragments found
on certain glycans) and 25 unique glycans in the Van Kooyk set. A
miner analysis (alpha: 1.0, minsup: 5) found 7 subtrees in the
Crocker set and 8 subtrees in the Van Kooyk set. The subtree with
the most support (it is found in all glycans in the set) is the com—
mon N—glycan core. In general the subtrees between these sets are
similar and found in similar proportions, see Supplementary Figure
S2. The exceptions are subtree 4 which is not found in the Van
Kooyk sample and subtrees 8 and 9 which are not found in the
Crocker sample. Subtrees 8 and 9 include additional sialylation at
the leaves.

A MCAW analysis of the Crocker and Van Kooyk datasets
shows the conserved common N—glycan core and variability in the
leaves (Fig. 3). From these MCAW analyses we see that the Crocker
set has triantennary glycans not found in Van Kooyk’s data (see
node 18 in Fig. 3A). Note that according to the CFG glycan
profiling protocols low level MS is performed and wherever possible
ES—MS/MS or MALDI—TOF/TOF—MS/MS is used to further identify
the glycan sequence. This profiling is dependent on the experimen-
talist and the annotator of the dataset. It is important to note that al—
though the triantennary glycans are not seen in Van Kooyk’s data it
does not mean that they do not exist. The Van Kooyk data has
variability in the mannose linkages at depth 4 (nodes 4 and 10 in

Fig. 3B); although this may be an artifact of the ordering process in
the alignment algorithm as 21 of 25 structures are composed of sub—
tree 3 (Supplementary Fig. S2). This data also shows additional
fucosylation (nodes 18 and 19, Fig. 3B) and sialylation at the leaves
(nodes 20, 9, 13, 16, Fig. 3B). From application of the comparison
workﬂow, consider the MCAW analysis of the intersection set, the
glycans common to both sets (Fig. 4). There are 18 glycans in com—
mon and these are not fucosylated at the leaves, although there is
sialylation (nodes 8, 14, 17 in Fig. 4). Half of these glycan sequences
are found to be core—fucosylated. The Lewis and sialyl Lewis-like
motifs are not found to be in common.

To investigate the glycans that are unique to each set the relative
difference between the sets is calculated. 8 unique glycans are found
in the Crocker set and 7 unique glycans in the Van Kooyk set as
shown in Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S3 (Inspection of the
data, reveal however, that glycan 25 with a predicted mass of 3691.1,

is a relatively minor peak in the MALDI MS data profile shown for
Crocker dataset, and that mass appears to be present but not anno—
tated in the van Kooyk dataset.). The features of the unique glycans
derived from the Crocker set are then summarized using MCAW, see
Figure 6.

The N—glycan set from the Crocker study was found to have add—
itional bisected glycans, see Figures 5 and 6. The Van Kooyk set
included additional glycans with sialylation at the leaves and more
core fucosylation. The MCAW analysis of the Crocker set (Figs. 3A
and 6) gives the impression that Sialyl Lewis motif may be present,
but when considering the individual glycans this is not the case.
Instead only the Lewis motif is found on one of these glycans. In
contrast, the Van Kooyk set contains one glycan with Sialyl Lewis,
two with Lewis and one with two Lewis motifs. Inadequate linkage
information is available to concretely identify the Lewis motifs, al—
though it is most likely LewisX (Lo et al., 1997). A MCAW and
miner analysis of these sets more easily identifies the unique aspects
of each glycome.

4 Conclusions

The use of reproducible research methods for glycomics analysis is key
to the acceleration of glycome assembly in diseased and healthy cellular
states. Once a glycome is assembled it can be mined for biomarker dis-
covery. The GAP introduced here offers the opportunity for open
source development that integrates multiple web resources into

reproducible workﬂows using Galaxy. The GAP’s integration of glyco—
mics tools into an established bioinformatics web platform to improve
their accessibility, usability, re—usability improves the sharing and re-
producibility of computational analysis and data in glycomics. We
illustrated the analyses and pattern matching capabilities within GAP
on N—glycan sets found in two healthy monocyte cell studies. From this
18 glycans were found that were common to both sets. The GAP ana—
lyses revealed that the N—glycan set from the Crocker study has add—
itional bisected glycans; while that from Van Kooyk’s study was found
to have additional glycans with sialylation at the leaves and more core
fucosylation as well as the Sialyl Lewis and Lewis motifs.

In the future we intend to connect semantic web services and in—
clude access to UnicarbKB and GlyTouCan. Linking to glycogene in-
formation for each sample would aid in an improved understanding
of this data.

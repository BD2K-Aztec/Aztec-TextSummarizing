Preamble

The International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) is dedicated to advancing human knowledge at the intersection of computation
and life sciences. On behalf of the ISCB members, this public policy statement expresses strong support for open access, reuse, integration,
and distillation of the publicly-funded archival scientiﬁc and technical research literature, and for the infrastructure to achieve that goal.

Knowledge is the fruit of the research endeavor, and the archival scientiﬁc and technical research literature is its practical expression and
means of communication. Shared knowledge multiplies in utility because every new scientiﬁc discovery is built upon previous scientiﬁc
knowledge. Access to knowledge is access to the power to solve new problems and make informed decisions. Free, open, public, online
access to the archival scientiﬁc and technical research literature will empower citizens and scientists to solve more problems and make
better, more informed decisions. Attribution to the original authors will maintain consistency and accountability within the knowledgebase.
Computational reuse, integration, and distillation of that literature will produce new and as yet unforeseen knowledge.

We strongly encourage open software, data, and databases, issues which are not addressed here. A prior ISCB public policy statement on
sharing software provides very clear support for Open Source/Open Access (http://www.iscb.org/iscb-policy-statements/software_sharing).
We support open database access, standards, and interoperability. We also recognize that databases are complex dynamic entities, with
ongoing roles and needs that cannot be treated properly within this statement. In contrast, the publicly-funded archival research literature,
addressed here, is the static historical record of publicly-funded research outcomes.

ISCB supports many of the principles set forth in other open access policies and statements, including the ‘Budapest Open Access
Initiative,’ the ‘Bethesda Declaration on Open Access Publishing,’ the Bulletin of the World Health Organization ‘Equitable Access to
Scientiﬁc and Technical Information for Health,’ the US. National Academies of Sciences report on ‘Sharing Publication-Related Data and
Materials: Responsibilities of Authorship in the Life Sciences,’ the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development ‘Principles
and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding,’ and the ‘Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences
and Humanities.’

The public policy statement put forward here builds upon these principles to elucidate in more detail the public policy position of ISCB
and its members on this important issue in scientiﬁc dissemination.

 

Public Policy Statement

The International Society for Computational Biology strongly advocates free, open, public, online: (i) access by person or
machine to the publicly-funded archival scientiﬁc and technical research literature; and (ii) computational reuse, integration,
and distillation of that literature into higher-order knowledge elements.

 

 

 

Supporting Statements
(1) The possibilities latent in the digital information age make it essential to achieve open access, and computational reuse, integration,
and distillation, of the publicly-funded archival research literature.
(a) Immediate access is preferable, and when access is at an interval following publication, that interval should not exceed one year.

(b) At a minimum, every scientiﬁc journal should offer an open access option to every published research paper, as does every ofﬁcial
or afﬁliated journal of the ISCB.

(c) Copyright licenses explicitly should permit computational reuse, integration, and distillation, using standard existing language
that eliminates the need for manual or legal review.

(d) The format of the available article should be easy to parse by both human and machine (e. g., HTML). Ideally, a plain text version
should be available as well (e. g., TXT), to facilitate computational reuse and integration (e. g., computational text mining for
knowledge extraction).

(e) Computational reuse, integration, and distillation should give attribution to the original authors.

(2) Existing open access models show high impact, scientiﬁc beneﬁt, feasibility, and acceptability.

(a) The public beneﬁt from open access to the world’s online information via the publicly-funded Internet provides a good model of
expected impact.

(b) The scientiﬁc fertilization from open access to genomic information via the publicly-funded Human Genome Project provides a
good model of expected scientiﬁc beneﬁt.

(0) Open access policies by the US. National Institutes of Health, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the Wellcome Trust
provide good models of feasibility and acceptability.

(d) The Creative Commons Attribution License and the Science Commons Open Access Data Mark provide good models of legal
mechanisms for computational reuse, integration, and distillation.

(3) Open literature access, reuse, integration, and distillation will enable a whole new generation of innovative computational tools
and processes. The literature will be endowed with enriched commentary and usability. It will be connected seamlessly, by proper
semantic links, to relevant websites, data, databases, and algorithms. Creating a web of knowledge around publications is an
important consequence of semantic enrichment of the research literature. Such tools already are being built by publishers, researchers,
entrepreneurs, and others. The further development of these tools should be supported aggressively. Removing all barriers to literature
open access, reuse, integration, and distillation is critical to achieving such a knowledge-level transformation.

(4) Supplementary data and methods should be openly available online, in sufﬁcient detail to replicate the reported research results
and facilitate reuse. Such material should be deposited in appropriate public repositories, in compliance with accepted community
standards, and in accord with the existing ISCB public policy statement on sharing software. It should allow for application of other
computational methods to the data and application of other data to the computational methods.

(5) Publishing high-quality peer-reviewed scientiﬁc literature incurs costs. We recognize that cost recovery is a serious issue that must be
addressed carefully if open access is to be a mandated policy.

(6) Open access policy details—which version, where stored, how annotated and organized, what incentives, etc.—must be considered
carefully. However, it has now become essential to put forward a broad policy mandate for public access to, and computational reuse,
integration, and distillation of, the publicly-funded archival scientiﬁc and technical research literature.

(7) This statement is intentionally neutral about any speciﬁc funding policy. Many implementations all may achieve the same essential
goal. Acceptable funding policies should:
(a) Remove barriers to open access and subsequent computational reuse, integration, and distillation.

(b) Encourage public, private, and philanthropic funding organizations to establish policies that mandate free, open, public, online
access to, and computational reuse, integration, and distillation of, the research results funded from their public, private, or
philanthropic support.

(0) Promote the body of publicly-funded archival research literature as a public investment that bears interest, and not as an ongoing
access cost to the public.

(d) Establish copyright licenses in standard terms that permit literature access, reuse, and integration.

(e) Specify a format that is easy to parse by both human and machine (e.g., HTML); and, ideally, also provide a plain text version
(e. g., TXT) to facilitate computational reuse and integration.

(f) Recognize the need to fund activities of peer review, copy editing, and publishing.

(g) Provide fairness to several groups, including the developing world and its health concerns, unfunded or under-funded researchers,
and others.

(h) Provide fair interim support or compensation, if and where needed, to facilitate making transitions and adaptations to new models
for publishing and sustaining essential revenue.

(i) Be consistent with government laws, patent requirements, other existing regulations, and research dissemination through viable
commercial mechanisms.

(8) The expected cost of complete open access to the publicly-funded archival research literature is only a very small percentage of the
entire publicly-funded international research endeavor. Nevertheless, it is undesirable to divert funding from current research and thus
risk underfunding basic science. New funding should be made available for open access policy implementations.

Conclusion

Currently, scientiﬁc advancement is limited by article availability, access costs, copyright restrictions, document formats, bulk download
limits, etc. All such barriers should be removed.

The publicly-funded archival scientiﬁc and technical research literature represents a substantial investment by the public, governments,
foundations, non-proﬁt institutions, publishers, individuals, and others. We in the ISCB are committed to the continuous enhancement and

leveraging of society’s knowledge resources. One of our primary missions is the computational integration of individual pieces of knowledge
from the research literature and databases, in ways that provide powerful new ideas and insights for next-stage research, to the beneﬁt of the
scientiﬁc community and society in general.

To achieve these public beneﬁts, we strongly advocate free, open, public, online access to the publicly-funded archival scientiﬁc and
technical research literature, and the computational reuse, integration, and distillation of that literature into hi gher-order knowledge elements.

Appendices

Appendix A. Example Scenario

An automated malaria website might access location-speciﬁc information from thousands of publicly-funded malaria research articles daily,
and then integrate that information into a free online interactive world map. Such a map might be annotated with up-to-date information
about disease occurrences, drug resistance proﬁles, current best control practices, etc., as distilled from the research literature extracted for
and attached to each local region. A hypothetical user might be a public health ofﬁcial in the developing world responsible for controlling
a sudden malaria outbreak in a remote area. Such a website should encounter no barriers while performing this free, useful, and potentially
essential public service.

Example Discussion

A search for ‘malaria’ in the US. NIH/NLM PubMed literature database yielded more than 55,000 hits (July, 2010;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/). The publicly-funded portion of these 55,000 ‘malaria’ hits should be freely available in bulk to
this hypothetical malaria website, using technologies well suited to bulk tasks, for purposes of: (i) the initial bulk literature download; (ii)
regular updates; and (iii) intermittent bulk repeat downloads to reinitialize an improved knowledge base. The relevant copyright permissions
should permit computationally recombining the publicly-funded portion of these 55,000 texts into whatever ﬁnal form is most useful and
informative to the user.

This example scenario illustrates an important public health beneﬁt that could be achieved immediately: the opportunity to pursue useful
knowledge-based innovations, by computational reuse, integration, and distillation of the publicly-funded archival research literature, across
many areas in biology and medicine.

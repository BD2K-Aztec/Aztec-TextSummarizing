ABSTRACT

Motivation: Many analyses in modern biological research are
based on comparisons between biological sequences, resulting
in functional, evolutionary and structural inferences. When large
numbers of sequences are compared, heuristics are often used
resulting in a certain lack of accuracy. In order to improve
and validate results of such comparisons, we have performed
radical all-against-all comparisons of 4 million protein sequences
belonging to the RefSeq database, using an implementation of the
Smith—Waterman algorithm. This extremely intensive computational
approach was made possible with the help of World Community
GridT'V', through the Genome Comparison Project. The resulting
database, ProteinWorldDB, which contains coordinates of pain/vise
protein alignments and their respective scores, is now made
available. Users can download, compare and analyze the results,
filtered by genomes, protein functions or clusters. ProteinWorldDB is
integrated with annotations derived from Swiss-Prot, Pfam, KEGG,
NCBI Taxonomy database and gene ontology. The database is a
unique and valuable asset, representing a major effort to create a
reliable and consistent dataset of cross-comparisons of the whole
protein content encoded in hundreds of completely sequenced
genomes using a rigorous dynamic programming approach.

1 INTRODUCTION

The assignment of biological function predictions and structural
features to raw sequence data is typically accomplished by
comparing them either to predicted protein sequences or to the
corresponding genes. This information is stored in several primary
public databases, such as GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0V/
Genbankl) or EMBL—Bank (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl). However,
annotations are often incomplete, based on non-standardized

nomenclature or might have no value when inferred from previous
incorrectly annotated sequences. Hence, secondary databases
such as Swiss-Prot (http://www.expasy.ch/spr0t/), PFAM (http://
pfam.sanger.ac.uk) or KEGG (http://www.gen0me.ad.jp/kegg), to
mention only a few, have been implemented to analyze speciﬁc
functional aspects and to improve the annotation procedures and
results.

Dynamic programming algorithms, or a fast approximation,
have been successfully applied to biological sequence comparison
for decades, and this class of algorithms comprises the heart of
many well-known sequence alignment programs (Batzoglou, 2005).
However, because of their quadratic time complexity, rigorous
dynamic programming algorithms are usually not suitable for the
comparison of a large set of sequences against a database, as
they demand exceptionally huge computational power and are
very time consuming. For this reason, sequence comparisons are
generally performed by heuristics like BLAST (Altschul et al.,
1997) and FASTA (Pearson, 1990), which have proved to be quite
effective and signiﬁcantly faster than the dynamic programming
algorithms. However, in many instances, these comparisons might
lack accuracy, as these heuristics do not guarantee to ﬁnd
a mathematically optimal alignment (Pearson, 1990), therefore
affecting all subsequent analytical steps. The Genome Comparison
Project (GCP) (http://www.dbbm.ﬁocruz.br/GenomeComparison)
aims to compare protein information on a genomic scale to
improve the quality and interpretation of biological data and
our understanding of biological systems and their interactions.
Stringent comparisons were obtained after the application of the
Smith—Waterman (SWO algorithm (Smith and Waterman, 1981)
in a pairwise manner to all predicted proteins encoded in both
completely sequenced and unﬁnished genomes available in the
public database RefSeq (version 21). The project represents a joint
effort involving Fiocruz, PUC-Rio and IBM®, and was executed
through World Community GridTM (WCG), a computational grid on
a global scale. We present here the outcome of this joint effort, the
ProteinWorldDB, which represents a major effort to create a reliable
and consistent dataset of cross-comparisons of the whole protein
content encoded in hundreds of completely sequenced genomes
using a rigorous dynamic programming approach.

2 METHODS

The core of the ProteinWorldDB comprises the results of all pairwise
comparisons accomplished by the GCP. Brieﬂy, a set of 3 812 663 proteins
from RefSeq version 21—consisting of all predicted proteins encoded in
458 completely sequenced and unﬁnished genomes—and 254 609 proteins
from Swiss-Prot version 51.5 were compared, in a pairwise manner, with
the program SSEARCH (http://fasta.bioch.Virginia.edu/), an implementation
of the SW local alignment algorithm. The sample was partitioned in blocks
containing up to 2000 sequences each, and comparisons were made applying
standard parameters, with an E-Value cutoff equal to one. To overcome
distortions in the E-Value and bit score produced by the partitioning of the
data, we recalculate the statistical parameters Lambda and K for each aligned
pair, taking the entire dataset into account, using four different mathematical
models implemented in the SSEARCH algorithm: (i) a weighted regression
of average score versus library sequence length, which provides an accurate
estimate of whether an alignment score is likely to occur by chance (Pearson,
1998; Pearson and Sierk, 2005), (ii) estimation from the mean and standard
deviation of the library scores, without correcting for library sequence length,
(iii) maximum likelihood estimates of Lambda and K and the (iv) Altschul—
Gish parameters (Altschul and Gish, 1996). For each comparison, a report
containing sequence identiﬁers, alignment length, coordinates of the most
similar regions, percentage of identity, number of gaps, raw and bit scores
and E -Value was returned. These central data were subsequently connected to
several third-party annotations, including gene and protein features (RefSeq),
taxonomic information (NCBI Taxonomy database), gene ontology (GO),
functional classiﬁcation (Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL), domain and protein family
classiﬁcation (Pfam) and enzymatic activity (KEGG). Additionally, we have
clustered all proteins of the dataset. Two or more proteins are included in
the same cluster if either their SW score or the combination of identity and
overlap is greater than or equal to a certain threshold (Otto et al., 2008).
More than 40 complete sets of clusters, using different parameter settings,
were generated and stored.

The ProteinWorldDB data are stored and managed using IBM® DB2
database management system, and are publicly accessible Via a web-
based graphical user interface. Currently, the following analyses are
implemented:

(1) Query of annotation features by primary/secondary database
identiﬁers, GO terms, EC numbers or Pfam terms. The records are
returned in tabular form, including all aforementioned qualiﬁers, the
genome name and its NCBI taxonomy ID. This is the standard output
for most results.

(2

v

Return of all proteins stored in the database similar to a query

sequence according to a certain qualiﬁer. The user can limit the results

using the E -Value, percentage of identity, overlap area or SW score.

(3) Comparison of protein sequences not included in the database with
all proteins in the dataset using BLAST algorithm. The ﬁrst ﬁve hits,
including their features, are returned.

(4) Download of the complete comparison data of two (fully sequenced)
genomes. The number of hits displayed can be limited as in 3.

(5) Search for unique proteins encoded by each organism. Under a given
cluster threshold, these proteins represent the sequences that have not
been grouped with any other sequence.

(6) Query of groups of related proteins, based on the primary/secondary

database identiﬁers, GO terms, EC numbers or Pfam terms.

3 RESULTS

ProteinWorldDB hosts a singular core dataset, composed of nearly
4 million proteins compared in a pairwise manner with the
rigorous SW algorithm, which guarantees to ﬁnd a mathematically
optimal alignment for a given set of parameters. With the help

of the WCG, the processing took ~7 months of calendar time
(the equivalent of 3748 computer years, including an average
3-fold redundancy in the grid, which was simultaneously allocating
resources to two other projects). The complete result occupies
~1 TB in a tabular form, each line comprising 80 characters for
each alignment with an E-Value 31. Of the 16 X 1012 comparisons
executed, 4.2 X 109 are currently in the database (comprising 300
GB of data), corresponding to alignments with an E-Value 50.001.
Different groups compared subsets of sequences with a SW approach
(Kanehisa et al., 2006) or pairs were ﬁrst ﬁltered with a heuristic
method and then compared, after satisfying a certain threshold
(Rattei et al., 2008). As previous studies have shown (Pearson, 1990;
Uchiyama, 2007), the latter strategy is not guaranteed to ﬁnd all hits.
One should keep in mind that false positives are expected to be found
with an E -Value threshold of E 5 0.001, as millions of comparisons
were done. Nevertheless, function transfer and homology inference
should not rely on E-Value thresholds alone, since the fraction of
identical positions between a pair of sequences, as well as the
extension of their overlapping area, among several other sequence
properties, play an important role in functional and evolutionary
predictions based on sequence similarity (Boekhorst and Snel, 2007;
Rest, 2002; Tian and Skolnick, 2003).

Valuable and unique information can be retrieved from
ProteinWorldDB. For instance, queries could include: (i) individual
or groups of proteins and their similarities with other entries based
on the SW algorithm; (ii) download of subsets of the comparison
data, i.e. related proteins shared by two particular species (inferred
orthologs) or related proteins present in the same organism (inferred
paralogs); (iii) genes that are exclusive of a particular species,
i.e. taxonomically restricted (unique) genes; (iV) groups of related
proteins for particular species using a protein of interest or a shared
biological function as reference; and (V) comparison of different
annotations for each entry. The ProteinWorldDB will, no doubt,
contribute to improve annotation, to studies on genome and protein
family evolution and in many other research aspects.

3.1 Further work

At this moment, the database contains similarity information using
an E -Value cutoff of 10—3. Later on, we will add additional results up
to an E -Value of one, and comparisons of an experimental set of open
reading frames, which have not been predicted as coding. Datasets
comprising different phylogenetic experiments, phylogenomics and
horizontal gene transfer are in construction. Also, an update can
be envisaged with the WCG to compute all the genomes that were
included in RefSeq since the end of our experiments. In the future,
we hope to develop automatic algorithms to scan differences in
annotation between third-party databases, evaluate the conﬁdence
of the annotations, add a wiki-like annotation support system,
allowing other groups to include their expertise in the database,
as well as reﬁne the interface in order to allow more complex
queries.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Arcadia translates text-based descriptions of biological
networks (SBML files) into standardized diagrams (SBGN PD maps).
Users can view the same model from different perspectives and
easily alter the layout to emulate traditional textbook representations.
Availability and Implementation: Arcadia is written in C++. The
source code is available (along with Mac OS and Windows binaries)
under the GPL from http://arcadiapathways.sourceforge.net/

1 BACKGROUND

Biological models such as metabolic pathways have traditionally
been described in textbooks and journal publications via diagrams.
Nowadays, these models can be stored in electronic databases and
shared as electronic ﬁles, using XML—based formats such as the
Systems Biology Markup Language (Hucka et al., 2003). In this
standardized form, the same data sets can be easily reused in
different software applications (e.g. simulation tools, text mining
tools, etc.). However, for a human being, the raw content of an SB ML
ﬁle is usually much more difﬁcult to interpret than are traditional
diagrammatic representations: even with a good understanding of
SBML elements, the model still only appears as a disjointed list of
isolated biochemical reactions, with no clear sense of the network
they form together. To obtain a map of this network, scientists have
to rely on visualization tools.

A number of existing software tools offer (among other features,
e.g. model editing or network analysis) to display SBML ﬁles as
diagrams: e.g. Cytoscape (Killcoyne et al., 2009), CellDesigner
(Funahashi et al., 2008), EPE (Sorokin et al., 2006) or VANTED
(Junker et al., 2006). Typically, they interpret the SBML model
as a graph, which is transformed algorithmically into a diagram
by deﬁning a rendering style for the nodes and edges (size,
shape, color, etc.), and positioning the resulting graphical objects
on a 2D plane. To perform this positioning task automatically,
network visualization tools apply a variety of generic layout methods
developed by the graph—theory community. However, when dealing
with biochemical models, the resulting network maps are often
disappointing: numerous edge crossings tend to impair readability,
leading in most cases to diagrams that have little in common

with traditional text—book representations of biological pathways.
Users often need to perform time—consuming manual adjustments
to produce a comprehensible map of their models. To remedy this
problem, Arcadia recognizes that diagrams representing biological
pathways are not merely generic graphs, but conform to a number
of context—speciﬁc stylistic conventions that aid their legibility.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The sole purpose of Arcadia is to display existing SBML ﬁles as
diagrams. By focusing on this single task, the interface can be kept
as simple as possible. Importing and exporting SBML ﬁles makes
Arcadia interoperable with a large number of tools specializing
in other tasks. Arcadia is packaged as a cross—platform desktop
application written in C++ and powered by a number of open
source libraries: Qt (Nokia Corporation, 2009) for the graphical user
interface; LibSBML (Bomstein et al., 2008) to handle SBML ﬁles;
the Boost Graph Library (Siek et al., 2002) to store the core graph
model; Graphviz (Ellson et al., 2002) for graph layout; and libavoid
(Wybrow et al., 2006) for edge routing. The source code is available
on Sourceforge under the GPL (cf. www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html),
along with precompiled binaries for Windows and Mac OS.
Internally, the data structure can be decomposed into three
interconnected layers (Fig. 1). The ﬁrst layer, or model layer,
corresponds to the data available in the SBML ﬁle, interpreted as
a directed bigraph. The last layer, or geometry layer, can display
graphs as diagrams, according to a speciﬁc rendering style and local
layout constraints. As explained before, similar mechanisms exist
in other network visualization tools. However the middle layer, or
topology layer, is speciﬁc to Arcadia. At this level, the topology
of the graph representation of the model can be modiﬁed without
altering the model itself. This extra layer enables unique features.

3 KEY FEATURES

Node cloning: It means replacing a single node connected to n
different other nodes, by n nodes, each connected to only one node.
In traditional diagrams, this operation is usually performed on highly
connected currency molecules such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). This simple transformation helps
reduce edge crossings and enables greater emphasis to be placed on
the overall ﬂow of the pathway.

Neighborhood visualization: An alternate way to reduce visual
clutter is to focus only on chemical interactions happening around
a speciﬁc network hub. In addition to the main view, Arcadia can

generate complementary views of the core model, displaying all the
species located one reaction away from a species of interest.
Graph constraints: At the geometry level, it is possible to alter the
automatic placement of species and reactions by attaching speciﬁc
layout rules to certain parts of the graph. This can be used to
emphasize particular aspects of the pathway: e. g. the central ﬂux can
be made to stand out as a main vertical axis, by placing secondary
reactions and species perpendicularly to the overall layout.

Each of the above operations can be performed in a single step.
In term of rendering, Arcadia uses the systems biology graphical
notation (Le Novere et al., 2009) for process description. By
default, Arcadia represents SBML species and reactions as SBGN
unspeciﬁed entities and transitions. When these SBML objects are
annotated with relevant systems biology ontology terms (Le Novere,
2006), Arcadia automatically translates them into more speciﬁc
SBGN glyphs.

4 RESULTS AND FUTURE PLANS

Figure 2 illustrates results obtained on a published model of yeast
glycolysis (Pritchard and Kell, 2002). More generally, in its current

form, Arcadia can deal with networks of up to a few 100 nodes.
Diagrams can be saved as standard SBML annotations (Gauges et al.,
2006) or exported as vector graphic ﬁles (PDF, PS, SVG). Annotated
SBML ﬁles can be reused in tools supporting the SBML layout
extension, e.g. COPASI (Hoops et al., 2006).

Future efforts will focus on supporting more input and output
standards, dealing with genome scale networks, and the visual
comparison of more than one model.

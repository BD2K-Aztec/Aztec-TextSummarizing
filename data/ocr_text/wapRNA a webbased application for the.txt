ABSTRACT

Summary: mRNA/miRNA—seq technology is becoming the leading
technology to globally profile gene expression and elucidate the
transcriptional regulation mechanisms in living cells. Although there
are many tools available for analyzing RNA-seq data, few of them are
available as easy accessible online web tools for processing both
mRNA and miRNA data for the RNA-seq based user community.
As such, we have developed a comprehensive web application
tool for processing mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq data. Our web tool
wapRNA includes four different modules: mRNA-seq and miRNA-
seq sequenced from SOLiD or Solexa platform and all the modules
were tested on previously published experimental data. We accept
raw sequence data with an optional reads filter, followed by mapping
and gene annotation or miRNA prediction. wapRNA also integrates
downstream functional analyses such as Gene Ontology, KEGG
pathway, miRNA targets prediction and comparison of gene’s or
miRNA’s different expression in different samples. Moreover, we
provide the executable packages for installation on user’s local
server.

Availability: wapRNA is freely available for use at http://waprna
.big.ac.cn. The executable packages and the instruction for
installation can be downloaded from our web site.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNA-Seq is a recently developed revolutionary approach for
transcriptome proﬁling and miRNA analysis using next generation
sequencing technologies. It can allow us to study RNA in further
depth and more accurate measurement. Studies using this method
have already altered our View of transcriptome and miRNA.
Recently, a lot of methods have been developed to process the
different aspects of RNA-seq data, such as short reads mapping
(Li and Durbin, 2009), gene annotation and differential gene-
expression analysis (Wang et al., 2010). Meanwhile, several
web-services for RNA and microRNA analysis have also been
developed, such as rQuant.web (Bohnert and Ratsch, 2010), MAGIA

(Sales et al., 2010), miRCat (Moxon et al., 2008), miRAnalyzer
(Hackenberg et al., 2009), mirTools (Zhu et al., 2010) and DSAP
(Huang et al., 2010). However, some of these web services need
prior data processing, such as mapping raw sequences, normalizing
expression data, or they do not provide local installation package.

In order to provide a service for the increasing amount of
experimental studies using RNA-seq methods, here, we present the
wapRNA, a novel web service that allows us to do mRNA and
miRNA expression analysis simultaneously. wapRNA complements
other RNA analysis tools reported by Goncalves et al. (2011).
Moreover, we provide the executable packages for installation
on user’s local server. This will facilitate studies for RNA using
high-throughput approaches, especially for biologists who have
limited computing sources or are short of bioinformatics processing
experience.

2 METHODS

2.1 The analysis pipeline

The wapRNA web service simpliﬁes the analysis of mRNA-seq/miRNA-seq
data by executing a computational pipeline on a set of data uploaded by user.
To accommodate different sequencing methods (SOLiD or Solexa) and study
targets (RNA or miRNA); we built four modules for SOLiD mRNA, Solexa
mRNA, SOLiD miRNA and Solexa miRNA data analysis, respectively.
Ten animal species whose genome sequences are available are provided
in our server (The species will be added according to user’s requirements
in future), and the gene structure information is based on ENSEMBL
(http://asia.ensembl.org/index.html) annotation. For mRNA data analysis,
the process starts from selecting sequencing platform, uploading raw data and
specifying the parameters like species and mapping mismatches allowance.
When submitted the above request, wapRNA will launch the processes by
preparing reference sequences and ﬁltering raw data according to user’s
request or default parameters. Then, those cleaned reads will be mapped
to corresponding reference sequences automatically using Corona_Lite
package for SOLiD (http://solidsoftwaretools.com/gf/project/coronal) and
BWA package (Li and Durbin, 2009) for Solexa, respectively. The expression
levels (RPKM, Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads)
for each gene will be calculated using uniquely mapped reads by in-house
built Perl module. Moreover, the downstream functional classiﬁcation will be
launched through the integrated localization of Gene Ontology (Harris et al.,
2004) and KEGG pathway database (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000). When the
job is ﬁnished, an email alerts will be automatically sent if the email address
is provided, and all results can be found and downloaded at the results page,
and also some concise pictures and statistical tables are provided for users.

While for miRNA data analysis, users also should specify the requisite
parameters listed in webpage and submit the job. We adopted two different
methods for SOLiD and Solexa data analysis. For Solexa platform,

we ﬁrst remove adaptors sequences, cluster those identical reads into
unique tags, map tags to assigned genome sequences and use those
perfect hits for the following analysis. Then we ﬁlter those non-miRNA
(including snRNA, tRNA, rRNA, mRNA, etc.) tags and annotate conserved
miRNA by comparing tags to miRBase (Grifﬁths-Jones, 2006; Grifﬁths-
Jones et al., 2008) database. Finally, we predicate new miRNAs using
miRdeep software (Friedlander et al., 2008). While for SOLiD platform,
due to the color-spaced sequences, we integrate the RNA2MAP package
(http://solids0ftwaretools.com/gf/project/rna2mapl) for ﬁltering the non-
miRNA sequences, annotating the known miRNAs by aligning to the miRNA
precursor sequences from miRB ase, and mapping to the genome sequence for
predicting novel miRNAs. The miRNA targets are predicated and combined
by using RNAhybrid (Kruger and Rehmsmeier, 2006) and miRanda (Betel
et al., 2010) software.

Moreover, we developed an independent module for detecting
differentially expressed genes (DEG), functional classiﬁcation (based on GO
and KEGG database), and miRNA target predication.

2.2 Case study
To demonstrate the functionality of wapRNA, we used it to analyze SOLiD
mRNA data from SRA009022 (Cui et al., 2010) and miRNA data (Cai
et al., 2010) produced in our lab. We also tested our Solexa pipeline using
mRNA data from SRRO37165 (Wu et al., 2010) and Solexa miRNA data
from SRR026761 (Morin et al., 2008). All analyzed results were showed in
demo results part, and all these jobs were run on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Cluster with 12 16 GB-RAM compute nodes and a total of 96 CPU cores.
For the SOLiD mRNA pipeline, we got 13.6% multiple mapped reads and
32.8% unique mapped reads, which are relatively higher than Cui et al.’s
(2010) original results. The difference is caused by parameter setting in
mapping procedure. For the miRNA pipeline, we identiﬁed 397 (341 unique)
known miRNA and 138 (111) novel miRNA in only one sample (hESC),
while 315 known miRNA and 100 novel miRNA in hESC samples by Morin
et al.’s (2008) results, about 82% of those known miRNA and 87% of those
novel miRNAs are overlapped between the two methods. The other two tests
also showed very similar results with original results.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

wapRNA consists of front— and back-end programs. The front—
end program, constructed based on Java Server Page (JSP) 2.0
technology, is in charge of tasks submission and results display.
We used the Struts (http://struts.apache.0rg), Spring (http://
www.springs0urce.0rg) and Hibernate (http://www.hibernate.org/)
framework to enhance the ﬂexibility and extendibility, and Mysq15.0
as the DBMS to store the interim and ﬁnal results. The back-end
program consists of series of Perl and Shell scripts, it is mainly in
charge of the data processing.

The executable packages for four pipelines designed and
implemented using Java program, which can be download from our
web site. All the packages can be run on 64-bit Linux system. Before
running the packages, some essential tools declared in the download
page are needed to be pre-installed in the system.

4 DISCUSSION

The wapRNA web service provides users to analyze next— generation
sequencing mRNA and miRNA data directly and simply by an easy-
to-use browser user interface. The service includes major processes
for the next-generation mRNA or miRNA data analysis, including
preprocessing raw sequenced reads, mapping tags to reference
sequences, gene expression annotation, and other downstream
functional analysis such as detecting differentially expressed genes,
Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis for RNA, novel

miRNA predication and miRNA target prediction. Moreover, we
also provide executable packages for users to build their pipeline
locally. However, some steps are still improvable, for example, we
ignored those multiple mapping reads which may be very important
for duplicated genes or members of gene family. And also, there
are a few additional features we have not involved, such as new
transcript identiﬁcation, alternative splicing, these features will be
integrated into the wapRNA in the near future.

Abstract

Motivation: RNAs fold into complex structures that are integral to the diverse mechanisms under—
lying RNA regulation of gene expression. Recent development of transcriptome—wide RNA struc—
ture profiling through the application of structure—probing enzymes or chemicals combined with
high—throughput sequencing has opened a new field that greatly expands the amount of in vitro
and in vivo RNA structural information available. The resultant datasets provide the opportunity to
investigate RNA structural information on a global scale. However, the analysis of high—throughput
RNA structure profiling data requires considerable computational effort and expertise.

Results: We present a new platform, StructureFold, that provides an integrated computational solu—
tion designed specifically for large—scale RNA structure mapping and reconstruction across any
transcriptome. StructureFold automates the processing and analysis of raw high—throughput RNA
structure profiling data, allowing the seamless incorporation of wet—bench structural information
from chemical probes and/or ribonucleases to restrain RNA secondary structure prediction via the
RNAstructure and ViennaRNA package algorithms. StructureFold performs reads mapping and
alignment, normalization and reactivity derivation, and RNA structure prediction in a single user—
friendly web interface or via local installation. The variation in transcript abundance and length that
prevails in living cells and consequently causes variation in the counts of structure—probing events
between transcripts is accounted for. Accordingly, StructureFold is applicable to RNA structural
profiling data obtained in vivo as well as to in vitro or in silico datasets. StructureFold is deployed
via the Galaxy platform.

Availability and Implementation: StructureFold is freely available as a component of Galaxy avail—
able at: https://usegalaxy.org/.

1 Introduction

RNA plays vital roles in myriad cellular functions, including regula-
tion of transcription, RNA processing and stability, and translation
(Mortimer et 61]., 2014; Sharp, 2009). The secondary and tertiary
structures of RNAs are integral to their biological functions; e.g. as
ligand-binding sensors (riboswitches), enzymes (ribozymes) or tem—
perature sensors (RNA thermometers). Therefore, knowledge of
RNA structure, especially in vivo, is essential for a mechanistic
understanding of RNA function.

Understanding of RNA structure has been greatly advanced
through the development of computational approaches for RNA
secondary and tertiary structure prediction (Schroeder, 2009).
Resultant software packages (Table 1) include RNAstructure
(Reuter and Mathews, 2010), ViennaRNA package (Lorenz et 61].,
2011), MC—Fold/MC—Sym (Parisien and Major, 2008) and SeqFold
(Ouyang et 61]., 2013). Each method has its advantages (cf. Table 1),
including pseudoknot predictions, local folding, G—quadruplex fold—
ing and prediction of 3D structure. Nonetheless, any purely compu—
tational RNA structure prediction method has severe limitations due
to incomplete knowledge of free energy parameters, RNA inter-
action with other molecules ranging from ligands to proteins, and
kinetically controlled RNA folding. To overcome these limitations,
RNA—modifying agents can be used to provide experimental re—
straints regarding the single— and double—stranded regions of the
RNA. For example, critical RNA structural information can be pro—
vided using nucleases (Kertesz et 61]., 2010; Knapp, 1989;
Underwood et 61]., 2010; Zheng et 61]., 2010) such as RNase V1,
which cleaves double—stranded RNA sites, and RNase Sl, which
cleaves single—stranded RNA sites. However, a limitation of such nu—
clease—based structure probing is that it can only be applied in vitro.
RNA structures in vivo can be very different due to protein binding,
RNA—RNA interactions, ionic and pH conditions, and other aspects
of the cellular milieu such as molecular crowding and the inﬂuence
of metabolites that are impossible to either completely model in sil-
ico or reconstitute in vitro (Kwok et 61]., 2013; Zaug and Cech,
1995).

As an alternative to nucleases, several RNA modifying
chemicals, including dimethyl sulfate (DMS; Zaug and Cech, 1995)
and Selective 2’—Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension
(SHAPE) reagents (Wilkinson et 61]., 2006) can be employed to report
the presence of single—stranded nucleotides in RNA and thus provide
experimental information on RNA structure. DMS methylates the

Watson—Crick N1 position of adenine and N3 position of cytosine
when these positions are not engaged in Watson—Crick base pairing
or other interactions. SHAPE reagents acylate the 2’ —hydroxyl group
on the sugar of ﬂexible nucleotides of all four nucleotide types. An
advantage of chemical probing methods is that many can be applied
in vivo as well as in vitro (Kwok et 61]., 2013; Spitale et 61]., 2013;
Wells et 61]., 2000; Zaug and Cech, 1995).

Nuclease—based cleavage truncates the RNA template available
for reverse transcriptase (RT), while the above chemical modifica—
tions of the RNA halt the reverse transcriptase one nucleotide before
the modification (Ehresmann et 61]., 1987). Both of these effects can
be read out as ‘stops’ in reverse transcription using conventional
methods based on gel (PAGE) or capillary electrophoresis (Fig 1).
Such electrophoresis—based methods, however, only read out this
structural information for relatively short segments of individual
RNAs and so are low—throughput and incapable of providing tran-
scriptome—wide data.

Recently, genome—wide methods employing high-throughput
sequencing techniques to identify the RT stops resulting from cleav—
ages or chemical modifications have been developed (e.g. Fig 1).
These methods make it possible to obtain structural information on
thousands of RNAs in a single experiment. To date, such studies
have been conducted in vitro in yeast (Kertesz et 61]., 2010), mouse
(Incarnato et 61]., 2014; Underwood et 61]., 2010), Drosop/oila, C. ele-
gans (Li et 61]., 2012a), Arabidopsis (Zheng et 61]., 2010) and human
(Wan et 61]., 2014), and in vivo in Arabidopsis (Ding et 61]., 2014),
yeast (Rouskin et 61]., 2014; Talkish et 61]., 2014) and human cells
(Rouskin et 61]., 2014). Another method, SHAPE—MaP, that relies on
mutagenesis rather than RT stops, has been applied in vitro to the
HIV-1 RNA genome (Siegfried et 61]., 2014). We recently reviewed
many of these approaches (Kwok et 61]., 2015).

While the combination of RNA structure probing with
high—throughput sequencing is a major advance in the RNA field, it

left side diagrams the standard electrophoresis-based method, while the right
side diagrams the next-generation-sequencing (NGS)-based approach, as
exemplified by Structure-Seq. Chemical probe treatment can be in vivo or

tion (RT). Nuclease treatment results in cleavage of the RNA (not explicitly

duced without nuclease or chemical probe treatment. In the NGS-based
readout, purple lines indicate 5’-runoff RT products; although they do not pro-
vide information on RT structure stops, inclusion of these reads (as well as
red and black reads) in the Structure-Seq method is critical as it allows proper
normalization for transcript abundance

requires intensive computational efforts to derive the explicit pre—
dicted reactivities and secondary structures transcriptome—wide
from high-throughput RNA structure profiling data. Some efforts
have been made to develop algorithms and implement software tools
and webservers to facilitate the data analysis process for high-
throughput RNA structure profiling (Table 2), which includes reads
mapping, normalization, reactivity derivation and RNA structure
prediction (Aviran et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012b; Loughrey et al.,
2014; Siegfried et al., 2014; Talkish et al., 2014). Here we provide a
brief overview of these methods and then indicate the advances pro—
vided by StructureFold.

Spats (Aviran et al., 2011; Loughrey et al., 2014) is a method to
derive reactivities from Shape—seq raw data (Lucks et al., 2011)
based on maximum likelihood, primarily to solve the problem aris—
ing from the signal decay that occurs at the 3’ end of each cDNA
read when using a single fixed primer that initiates reverse transcrip—
tion at the 3’ end of the RNA. Mod—seeker (Talkish et al., 2014) is a
method that identifies significantly enriched sites of DMS modifica—
tion by Cochran—Mantel—Haenszel tests on each transcript and de—
fines structural reactivity as the fold enrichment of RT stops on each
nucleotide in the DMS treated library relative to a control library
with no DMS treatment. While Spats and Mod—seeker provide meth—
ods to derive structural reactivities from high-throughput RNA
structure profiling data, Spats focus on reactivity information for in-
dividual RNAs, while the structural reactivities provided by Mod—
seeker are not directly comparable between different RNAs in a
transcriptome. In addition, while these programs calculate reactiv—
ities, they do not include the essential step of actual prediction of
RNA structures.

SAVoR takes RNA sequences and mapped high—throughput
RNA structure profiling data as inputs, and outputs individual RNA
structures from the RNAfold program in the ViennaRNA package
(Lorenz et al., 2011), either including experimental restraints as
derived from mapped high—throughput RNA structure profiling data
or without any restraints. The online SAVoR platform is easy to use
but it cannot be downloaded and installed locally, and it does not
provide an option to output transcriptome—wide RNA structural
reactivities or structures, which is crucial for deriving global prin-
ciples of RNA folding and function.

ShapeMapper and the SM_folding_pipeline software developed
in the SHAPE-MaP approach (Siegfried et al., 2014) rely on muta—
genesis rather than stops during RT. The programs output structural
reactivities as well as predicted RNA structures.

StructureFold (this study).

Here we describe our development of StructureFold, a series of
software packages that integrates reads mapping, RT stop count cal—
culation, reactivity derivation, and structure prediction in a web—
based interface. The two inputs to StructureFold are transcriptome
sequence and (optional) high—throughput RNA structure profiling
data; the outputs are structural reactivities on each nucleotide tran—
scriptome—wide and the corresponding RNA structures predicted
with or without the experimental restraints. By taking into account
the differential abundances and lengths of RNAs in a transcriptome,
StructureFold provides values of in vivo structural reactivities of nu—
cleotides on different RNAs that are directly comparable.
StructureFold is provided as a component of the Galaxy platform
(http://www.galaxyproject.org) and takes advantage of the compu—
tational tools available in Galaxy (Goecks et al., 2010), such as
Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) and SAMtools (Li et al., 2009).
StructureFold consists of a series of intuitive modules that are easy
to use, either online or after local installation.

2 Methods/software implementation

We developed StructureFold as four modules that perform two
major functions. The first function employs the first three modules
to derive structural reactivities on each nucleotide in a transcriptome
based on input of raw sequencing reads. The second function, en—
compassed in the fourth module, predicts RNA secondary structures
transcriptome—wide. StructureFold takes in high—throughput
sequencing data from control datasets and from treated datasets
consisting of nuclease—based or chemical—based (e.g. DMS or
SHAPE) structure probing data and outputs predicted RNA second—
ary structures in just a few simple steps. Figure 2 provides an over—
view of how StructureFold works.
StructureFold is implemented as follows:

1. The ﬁrst module in StructureFold is the Iterative Mapping mod-
ule. This module maps the raw reads from the sequencer to the
reference transcriptome library using Bowtie (Langmead et al.,
2009), allowing up to the maximum number of mismatches
speciﬁed by the user. The two inputs are raw sequencing reads
and the corresponding reference library (i.e. the transcriptome
or RNA genome of interest), provided as Fasta/Fastq and Fasta
ﬁles, respectively. Bowtie is used to iteratively map the reads to
the reference library. Users can use the —5/—3 ﬂag in Bowtie to

RNA Structure Prediction

Fig. 2. StructureFold calculates reactivities from experimental RNA structure
profiling data and predicts RNA structures with or without these experimental
restraints. StructureFold consists of 4 modules: Iterative Mapping, Get RT
Stop Counts, Reactivity Calculation, and RNA Structure Prediction. Circles
represent inputs, boxes represent processes, and ovals represent outputs.
Outputs of modules that are also inputs for the next module are left as ovals

remove a user—speciﬁed number of nucleotides at the 5 ’ and/or 3’
end of each read. This process is useful for removing adapter se—
quence from the read. Users can also use the —v option to set the
ﬂag for the number of mismatches allowed while mapping. If a
read cannot be mapped, it may be because of internal mis—
matches between the read and the reference library sequence, or
because adapter sequence is included in the read. Accordingly, if
a read cannot be mapped, it is trimmed by a user—speciﬁed num—
ber of nucleotides at the 3’ or 5’ end, and mapping to the refer—
ence library is again attempted. The process is iterated until the
read either properly maps or is less than the minimum length re-
quirement speciﬁed by the user, which typically corresponds to
the minimum length required for unique mapping of a read to
the reference library. Each successfully mapped read with its
mapping location is collected and the information is stored as a
.bam ﬁle.

2. The second module in StructureFold is the Get RT Stop Counts
module. This module calculates the number of RT stops that
map to each nucleotide of each transcript. The inputs are a
mapped dataset (in .bam format), typically from the preceding
Iterative Mapping module, and the reference library that was
used to map the reads, and the output is an RT Stop Counts
(RTSC) text ﬁle, which contains RT stop counts mapped to each
of the four nucleotides (A, C, G, U) in each transcript.

To obtain the number (count) of RT stops for each nucleotide,
the mapping location of each RT stop is first considered. For chem—
ical modification, mapping allows identification of the nucleotide
immediately 5’ to the RT stop on the RNA, which is the nucleotide
that was modified and so receives the stop count. When nucleases
are used for structure mapping, the nucleotide that will receive the
count according to this procedure is the nucleotide on the 5’ side of
the cleavage site on the RNA. The counts of the RT stops of all the
nucleotides of each of the RNAs in the experimentally queried tran-
scriptome are combined into a RT termination (stop) count .txt file
for each type of library: control and reagent treated. The control
library is used to account for background RT stops arising from
reverse transcriptase drop off at non—exogenously modified or
non—nuclease cleaved sites, which can result from a number of fac—
tors including imperfect processivity of the reverse transcriptase, the
presence of endogenous RNA modifications, or degradation of the
RNA template.

3. The third module of StructureFold is the Reactivity Calculation
module. This module calculates reactivity based on the RTSC
ﬁle generated from the preceding Get RT Stop Counts module.
The Reactivity Calculation module begins with a two-step
normalization of the RT stop counts:

Step 1: The RT stop counts on each nucleotide of each mapped tran—
script in the plus and minus reagent conditions are incremented by
1 and the natural log (ln) is taken of the resultant value. This pro—
vides the numerator in Equations (1) and (2). These raw data are
typically skewed, and taking the ln results in a distribution much
closer to Gaussian (Fig 3). Incrementing by 1 avoids an undeﬁned
value of the natural logarithm if there are zero RT stop counts.

Step 2: The ln of RT stop counts on each nucleotide of each mapped
transcript in the plus and minus reagent conditions are normalized
by the transcript’s abundance and length. For a transcript, suppose
P,(z') and M,(i) are the raw ‘r’ numbers of RT stops mapped to nu—
cleotide i (all four nucleotides are included) on the transcript in the
plus (P) and minus (M) reagent libraries, respectively, and l is the
length of the transcript. P,(0) and M,(0) are the raw numbers of

5’—runoff RT reads (purple—coded reads in Fig 1) on the transcript
in the plus and minus reagent libraries, respectively. The denomin—
ators in Equations 1 and 2 thus represent the abundance normal—
ized by transcript length.

Equation (1) provides the normalized RT stop count for nucleo—
tide i in the plus reagent library.

Equation (2) provides the normalized RT stop count for nucleotide i

in the minus reagent library.

ln[M,(z')+1]

‘Final structural reactivities’ (FSRs) are then calculated from the

 

M(z') = (2)

normalized RT stop counts in equations 1 and 2 in three steps. First,
values of a term denoted ‘raw structural reactivity’ (RSR) are
defined. Raw structural reactivities (RSRs) are calculated by sub—
tracting the normalized RT stop count on each nucleotide in the
minus reagent library from the normalized RT stop count on each
corresponding nucleotide in the plus reagent library. If the value is
negative, it is set to zero. Second, 2—8% normalization is applied to
the RSRs. In 2—8% normalization, the top 2% of the data are ini—
tially removed and the average value of the remaining top 8% of the
data is then calculated (Low and Weeks, 2010). Then all the data
(here, all the RSRs) are divided by this average value to obtain the
‘normalized structural reactivities’ (NSRs). The purpose of this nor—
malization is to convert RSRs into a range that can be used as re—
straints for RNA structure prediction in RNAstructure and
ViennaRNA package. As with SHAPE data (Deigan et al., 2009),
this normalization places most reactivities between 0 and 1, with the
few reactivities larger than 1 representing highly reactive nucleo—
tides. Third, the NSRs are capped by a user—specified threshold.
Capping avoids extremely high structural reactivities, which could
introduce bias when investigating meta properties of RNA structural
patterns (Kertesz et al., 2010). The resultant values are the ‘final
structural reactivities’ (FSRs) for each nucleotide in the
transcriptome.

The output from this module (.txt file), which is indicative of the
tendency of a nucleotide to be single—stranded, can be used as input
for the next module or can be used directly (i.e. without the next
module) to carry out meta analyses. For instance, we used FSRs to
evaluate periodicity in mRNA reactivity and relationships between

FSRs and alternative polyadenylation or alternative splicing (Ding
et al., 2014).

4. The fourth module of StructureFold is the RNA Structure
Prediction module. This module predicts RNA structures using
the RNAstructure program (V5.6; http://rna.urmc.rochester.
edu/RNAstructure.html) and ViennaRNA package (V2.1.9).
The module can predict RNA secondary structures from se—
quence data alone, or with inclusion of restraints from struc-
tural reactivities as provided by the ﬁrst three modules. Lastly,
the user has the option of creating bar plots to illustrate the dis—
tribution of the FSRs of the nucleotides in any transcript speci—
ﬁed by the user (Fig 4a).

The RNA Structure Prediction module requires one or more
transcript IDs from the reference library as input; these are provided
as a .txt file with each ID on one line. StructureFold will find the
RNA sequence in the reference library corresponding to the ID pro-
vided. If the FSR on each nucleotide of the RNA is provided, the
module can output bar plots that illustrate the distribution of the
FSRs (generated from the third module) of the nucleotides in any
transcript specified by the user (Fig 4a). When the FSRs are pro—
vided, the module outputs the predicted structures of the RNA with
these restraints (Fig 4b). Otherwise the module outputs the predicted
structures without restraints, i.e. an in silico prediction that does not
incorporate any experimental data (Fig 4c).

Explicit inputs and outputs for all four modules in StructureFold
can be found in the Supplementary Note.

2.1 ROC curve generation

ROC curves were generated on regions of 18S and 25 S rRNAs for
both gel—based and NGS—based readouts. These curves are based on
phylogenetic secondary structures, derived by the Gutell lab based
on comparative analyses of RNA sequences and their secondary
structures (Cannone et al., 2002; http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu).
We define a single—stranded nucleotide in the phylogenetic structure
as condition positive. We vary a reactivity threshold from 0 to 7
evenly with 15 000 divisions. For a given threshold, each nu—
cleotide with FSR (or normalized gel intensity) that is above
the threshold is designated as test outcome positive. We calculate
sensitivity (true positive rate) and 1—specificity (false positive rate)
at each threshold and use this information to generate the ROC
curves.

2.2 Gel—based structure probing

In vivo DMS modification was performed on etiolated Arabidopsis
seedlings, and the structure probing results were analyzed by gel
electrophoresis (Fig 1) as described previously (Ding et al., 2014;
Kwok et al., 2013). Briefly, the DMS—treated and DMS—
untreated (control) RNA were used as the inputs for rRNA structure
probing. Approximately 1 ug of total RNA was used for the (—l—)
and the (—) DMS conditions and total RNA was used for dideoxy
sequencing. 32P radiolabelled 185 or 255 rRNA—specific
primers were used for the reverse transcription: for 185 region one
(5’ -AACTGATTTAATGAGCCATTCGCAG-3’ ), for 185 region
two (5’-GAGCCCGCGTCGACCTTTTATC-3’), for 185 region
three (5’ —GGTAATTTGCGCGCCTGCT—3’ ), for 25 S region one (5’ —
AAGCGCCATCCATTTTCGG-3’ ). The labeled cDNA
fragments were size fractionated by PAGE and detected using a
Typhoon phosphorimager. Gel intensity was quantified using
ImageQuant 5.2. Gel—based DMS reactivity was normalized (Kwok
et al., 2013) by 2—8% normalization based on Low and Weeks
(2010).

3 Results

3.1 Comparison between structural reactivities and
gel—based assay intensities

We used ROC curves to compare the similarity of structural reactiv—
ities generated by the NGS—based Structure—Seq method (Ding et al.,
2014) analyzed via StructureFold to DMS reactivities derived
from the classical gel—based method of RNA structure—probing
(Fig 5). The Structure—Seq FSRs and normalized in vivo
gel—based assay intensities have similar performance on all of
the rRNA regions tested, which strongly validates the DMS
reactivities generated from StructureFold. The observation that the
ROC curves are above the diagonal line of no discrimination
indicates that the methods perform much better than random pre—
diction, and the observation that the curves track each other on each
of the plots indicates that the two methods have similar
performance.

3.2 Comparison between structural reactivities derived
from StructureFold and Mod—seeker

To compare our method of deriving structural reactivities with the
previously published method, Mod—seeker, we applied the
Mod—seeker approach to our high—throughput structural profiling
data on rRNA from Ding et al. (2014). For Arabidopsis 18S and 25 S
rRNAs, we observed a high correlation between the structural
reactivities derived using StructureFold and those from Mod—seeker
[Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) 20.91 and PCC:0.93, re—
spectively]. In addition, as shown in Table 3, the structural reactiv—
ities derived from both programs are consistent with the
phylogenetic structures of 18S and 25 S rRNA.

3.3 Sample outputs from StructureFold
In addition to providing FSRs, StructureFold can provide RNA
structures in the following two ways:

3.3.1 Predict RNA structures in silico

The RNA Structure Prediction module can predict RNA structures
at a user—chosen temperature without the imposition of any re-
straints. In this case, StructureFold employs RNAstructure (Reuter
and Mathews, 2010) or ViennaRNA package (Lorenz et al., 2011)
with default thermodynamic parameters to predict RNA structures
directly from the RNA sequence according to thermodynamics.
Candidate structures selected are those with minimum free energy.

3.3.2 Predict RNA structures with experimental restraints
StructureFold can take as input experimentally—generated
high-throughput RNA structure profiling data to restrain

structure prediction. By sequentially employing the preceding
Iterative Mapping, Get RT Stop Counts, and Reactivity modules,
StructureFold will derive the FSR reactivity for each nucleotide,
which is a quantification of the likelihood that the nucleotide is sin—
gle—stranded.

The RNA Structure Prediction module in StructureFold then pre—
dicts RNA structures using these reactivities as restraints. The
method converts reactivities into pseudo—free energy terms, or ‘soft
restraints’ that are used to adjust the purely model oligonucleotide
based thermodynamic free energies (Turner and Mathews, 2010;
Xia et al., 1998) of the candidate structures. Reactivities are used as
restraints in an analogous way as previously described for DMS and
SHAPE data (Cordero et al., 2012; Deigan et al., 2009). After our
own assessment (Supplementary Table S1), we opted to use the
same slope and intercept parameters for StructureFold as those used
by Hajdin et al. (2013). The corresponding equation is:

AG(i):1.8ln[Reactivity(i)+1]—0.6 (inkcalmol_1) (3)

where ‘1" is the ith nucleotide in a given transcript.

StructureFold outputs include the RNA structure predicted with
and without restraints and a bar plot that illustrates the per nucleo—
tide reactivity of the RNA (Fig 4). It is evident from Figure 4 that
this RNA structure predicted with restraints is quite different from
that predicted without restraints, an observation that is generally

tally—derived restraints.

4 Discussion

StructureFold is the first computational platform designed specific—
ally for transcriptome—wide RNA structure mapping and reconstruc—
tion. In addition to enabling transcriptome—wide prediction of RNA
secondary structures in silico (unrestrained), StructureFold can out—
put FSRs that can then be used for transcriptome—wide prediction of
experimentally—restrained RNA structures. In the future, we antici—
pate StructureFold outputs being used to assess and compare the re—
strained predictions resulting from RNA structure profiling data
generated by numerous experimental methods, including nuclease,
SHAPE, DMS, and other chemical probing agents (Kwok et al.,
2015

StructureFold has several advantages over other software plat—
forms for analysis of RNA structure (Table 2). Compared to SAVoR
(Li et al., 2012b), StructureFold outputs transcriptome—wide struc—
tural reactivities on each nucleotide, allowing investigation of global
structural patterns. Compared to Spats (Aviran et al., 2011) and
Mod—seeker (Talkish et al., 2014), StructureFold predicts RNA
structures in addition to deriving structural reactivities. In contrast
to Mod—seeker, StructureFold takes the abundance of transcripts
into consideration and thus can be used for comparative analyses of
in vivo as well as in vitro high throughput RNA structure
data within and between transcriptomes. Compared to
ShapeMapper, StructureFold provides a user—friendly online plat-
form where high-throughput data probing RNA structures can be
analyzed directly.

StructureFold is straightforward to use online or to install for
local use on UNIX systems. Through incorporation into the Galaxy
platform, StructureFold takes advantage of the computational infra—
structure and tools, as well as the ongoing curation provided by
Galaxy (Goecks et al., 2010). For example, outputs from read map—
ping algorithms in Galaxy such as Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009)
and BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) directly provide the input to the
Get RT Stop Counts module of StructureFold.

In the future, StructureFold could be extended in several ways:

(i) Methods for reads trimming

StructureFold employs iterative mapping to remove adapter se—
quences; this method uses the exact biological sequence to identify
the presence of adapter sequence but requires more computational
time. The cutadapt program (Martin, 2011) is commonly used to re—
move adapter sequence but has difficulty to identify the adapter se—
quence if only a small portion of the adapter is present. Iterative
mapping and cutadapt could possibly be integrated.

(ii) More options to derive reactivities from RT stop count ﬁles

Currently, three experimental approaches have been applied for
in vivo transcriptome—wide profiling of RNA structure: Structure—Seq
(Ding et al., 2014), Mod—seq (Talkish et al., 2014) and DMS—seq
(Rouskin et al., 2014). Each approach has its advantages and limita—
tions. For example, StructureFold takes the transcript abundance into
account and avoids skewness of the raw number of RT stops by ln
transformation but it is still susceptible to experimental noise to some
extent, especially on low—abundance RNAs. RNAs with low abun—
dance have fewer RT stops mapped in total, and so are proportion—
ately more affected by stops resulting from drop off of the RT primer.
One way to compensate for this is simply to obtain more reads.

Mod—seeker (Talkish et al., 2014) is more resistant to experimental
noise than StructureFold because it identifies significantly enriched
sites of DMS modification before deriving the final DMS reactivity.
Mod—seeker and StructureFold have very similar performance on
deriving structural reactivities of individual rRNAs as shown in
Table 3; however, DMS reactivities derived by Mod—seeker on differ—
ent transcripts are not directly comparable because each nucleotide in
a library is normalized by the same value, which does not take into ac—
count differences in transcript abundance. DMS—Seq (Rouskin et al.,
2014) normalizes RT stops mapped to each position proportionally to
the most highly reactive base within a given structured window
(5 0—200 nucleotides in length). The method avoids local bias of the
RT stops on each RNA, but the length of the window is fairly arbi-
trary (Aviran and Pachter, 2014). Moreover, local region normaliza-
tion assumes independence of the different regions of the transcript,
which is not always a valid assumption (Behrouzi et al., 2012;
Strulson et al., 2014). In the future, StructureFold could be expanded
to provide options for users to choose among methods of reactivity
calculation.

(iii) More alternatives for predicting RNA structures

StructureFold employs the free energy minimization program in
RNAstructure (Reuter and Mathews, 2010) or the ViennaRNA
package (Lorenz et al., 2011) to predict RNA structures. Both
RNAstructure and ViennaRNA predict RNA structures according
to thermodynamic parameters (Turner Rules) measured on model
oligonucleotides and provide the candidate structures with the low—
est free energy. RNAstructure is able to use the experimentally—
derived reactivities as soft restraints, which improves the accuracy
of the prediction. By contrast, the ViennaRNA package incorporates
the experimental data only as hard restraints for RNA structure pre—
diction. Hard restraints are digital (0/1) restraints that designate
each nucleotide to be base—paired or non—base paired, which may re-
sult in less accurate structure prediction than the use of soft re—
straints. The ViennaRNA package uniquely allows local folding
(RNALfold) and G—quadruplex prediction, which are advantageous
for some applications.

MC—Fold/MC—Sym (Parisien and Major, 2008), another com—
monly used RNA structure prediction package, can also use re—
straints for structure prediction, wherein the user must designate the
reactivity for each nucleotide as high, low or medium. MC—Fold uses
a knowledge—based scoring function rather than thermodynamics
for 2D RNA structure prediction, and MC—Sym is further able to
predict the 3D structures of the RNAs based off the 2D MC—Fold
structures. In the future, incorporation of MC—Fold and MC—Sym al—
gorithms as choices in StructureFold could provide additional infor—
mation on individual RNA structures.

We believe that StructureFold is well—suited for use by any scien—
tist interested in generating and analyzing high-throughput RNA
structure profiling data. Given the current rapid development of the
RNA structure field, the user—friendly nature of the StructureFold
platform, and the plentiful computational resources available on the
Galaxy platform, StructureFold will facilitate genome—wide RNA
structure prediction by both experimentally—focused and computa—
tionally—focused groups.

Abstract

Summary: Synthetic fusion proteins have shown great potential in various biotechnological and
(bio)pharmaceutical applications. They usually contain more than two protein domains joined by
a linker peptide sequence which is often selected intuitively or in ad hoc manner. Thus, we
developed an integrated web—based system, SynLinker, to provide appropriate linker candidates
for constructing fusion proteins. We compiled a total of 2260 linker sequences comprising of natural
linkers extracted from a set of non—redundant multi—domain proteins in Protein Data Bank and artifi—
cial/empirical linkers collected from literature and patents. Multiple query interface allows users to
search for the desired linker candidates based on selection criteria and their preferences. In addition, a
selected linker can be combined with two domain structures which are uploaded and appended at its
N and C terminals, thereby predicting a de novo structure of the fusion protein. Hence, SynLinker can
serve as a systematic tool for researchers who are interested in designing synthetic fusion proteins.

1 Introduction

A synthetic fusion protein is constructed to improve properties or
new functionality by synergistically connecting multiple proteins
into one single complex via a peptide linker sequence (Yu et 61].,
2015). However, it is not straightforward to identify a suitable
linker since its length or amino acid composition may affect the
fusion proteins to be misfolded (Zhao et 61]., 2008), expressed at low
levels (Amet et 61]., 2009) and reduce bioactivity (Bai et 61]., 2005;
Chen et 61]., 2012; Zhang et 61]., 2009). The linker selection is done
mostly ad 1906 and still based on random test in experiments. Thus,
two interesting bioinformatics tools have been developed for helping
rational design of fusion proteins and selection of their linkers. The
first one is LINKER program, which was an online server for

automatically generating linker sequences for fusion proteins
(Crasto and Feng, 2000; Xue et 61]., 2004). Unfortunately, this server
website is not accessible any more. The second tool is LinkerDB, a
database of linkers extracted from natural multi—domain proteins
(George and Heringa, 2002). This database provides linker candi—
dates via user—defined query interface with respect to their Protein
Data Bank (PDB) code, sequence, length and secondary structure.
However, no further update or improvement has been made ever
since it was created although PDB database has expanded tremen—
dously during the last decade. Hence, in order to provide most
updated linker candidates, we built SynLinker for synthetic fusion
protein design. For the comparison of linker design tools including
SynLinker, refer to the supplementary information.

SynLinker

 

2 Synlinker features

SynLinker contains a total of 2150 natural linkers obtained from a
non—redundant dataset which was collected by applying a blast P—value
cutoff 10‘7 on a clustering of chains from NCBI MMDB. The data—
base also comprises of 110 artificial/empirical linkers collected from
public domains including literature and patent information (See the
Supplementary Information for dataset description). SynLinker encom-
passes a range of features for users to search, BLAST and select their
desired linker candidates for constructing synthetic fusion proteins.

2.1 Linker selection criteria

On the ‘Search’ tab, SynLinker incorporates multiple query criteria
that are critical for linker selection. (i) Linker length, in terms of
number of residues or end—to—end distance in Angstroms, is import-
ant when the distance between the joined domains influences the
fusion protein’s bioactivity. (ii) Solvent accessibility of the linker is
considered as another criterion since flexible linker regions in a
protein are more accessible to solvent. (iii) Terminal amino acids of
linker sequence are pivotal for the connection of joining genes.
(iv) Compositional bias is a determining factor for linker selection
since it can largely affect the folding stability of a fusion protein.
(v) Proteolytic site also requires attention when selecting cleavable
linkers for constructing fusion proteins. Once a query is submitted,
both the natural and artificial/empirical linkers in SynLinker are
searched simultaneously, giving rise to a list of linker candidates
satisfying the desired selection criteria (Fig. 1A). The structure of a
linker candidate can be visualized by clicking the ‘show’ button,
which brings up a JSmol viewer displaying its conformation.

2.2 Fusion protein construction

The prediction of fusion protein conformation is a unique feature of
SynLinker. At the outset, users select multiple linkers from the
searched candidates by clicking the checkboxes based on their prefer—
ences. These selected linkers can be viewed for comparison and also
used for constructing fusion proteins on the ‘Protein Fusion’ tab.
Subsequently, two domain structures in PDB format can be uploaded
and appended at N and C terminals of suggested linker sequences. In
turn, the website server calls up a backend program ‘fusedomains’,
which in silico fuses the two domains together with the linker selected
among candidates, followed by the energy minimization to further
reduce the steric hindrance within the structure. Finally, a possible
conformation of a fusion protein is generated along with calculated
hydropathicity profile indicating the regions likely to be exposed on
the protein’s surface (Fig. 1B). The algorithm of ‘fusedomains’
program is described in the supplementary information. In future,
more options will be provided to enhance the quality of protein struc—
ture by incorporating conformational sampling and domain inter-
actions, e.g. rigid—body docking on interacting domain pairs as
implemented by py—DockTET (Cheng et al., 2008).

3 Implementation

SynLinker has a web interface written in a LAMP solution stack
(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), and designed for standard client/
server architecture. The MySQL database stores linker information
using the InnoDB engine. The website also uses JSmol for molecular
structure visualization. SynLinker stores the 3D structures of linkers
having coordinates in the PDB files. For those linkers that do not have
resolved structures, SynLinker also provides a possible extended
conformation generated by TraDES (http://trades.blueprint.org/)—an
ab initio structure prediction method (Feldman and Hogue, 2000).

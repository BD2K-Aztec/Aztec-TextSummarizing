ABSTRACT

Motivation: The biological pathway exchange language (BioPAX) and
the systems biology markup language (SBML) belong to the most
popular modeling and data exchange languages in systems biology.
The focus of SBML is quantitative modeling and dynamic simulation of
models, whereas the BioPAX specification concentrates mainly on
visualization and qualitative analysis of pathway maps. BioPAX de-
scribes reactions and relations. In contrast, SBML core exclusively
describes quantitative processes such as reactions. With the SBML
qualitative models extension (qual), it has recently also become pos-
sible to describe relations in SBML. Before the development of SBML
qual, relations could not be properly translated into SBML. Until now,
there exists no BioPAX to SBML converter that is fully capable of
translating both reactions and relations.

Results: The entire nature pathway interaction database has been
converted from BioPAX (Level 2 and Level 3) into SBML (Level 3
Version 1) including both reactions and relations by using the new
qual extension package. Additionally, we present the new webtool
BioPAX288ML for further BioPAX to SBML conversions. Compared
with previous conversion tools, BioPAX288ML is more comprehen-
sive, more robust and more exact.

1 INTRODUCTION

The goal of systems biology is the model-driven understanding of
biological and biochemical processes across all layers and various
levels of detail. The biological pathway exchange language
(BioPAX) and the systems biology markup language (SBML)
are common modeling languages that facilitate the exchange
and storage of in silico models. BioPAX can be used to describe
the biological semantics of metabolic, signaling, molecular,
gene-regulatory and genetic interaction networks. It is mainly
used for qualitative analysis and information exchange (Demir
et al., 2010). SBML describes the structure of models. In contrast

to BioPAX, it offers the possibility to include mathematical ex-
pressions, which are necessary for dynamic simulations (Hucka
et al., 2003). A detailed comparison between both languages has
been given by Stromb'ack et al. (2005, 2006).

Besides these language differences, BioPAX models from data-
bases like the nature pathway interaction database (PID,
Schaefer et al., 2009) or MetaCyc (Caspi et al., 2012) are often
used as information source to build SBML models for further
simulation processes (Bauer-Mehren et al., 2009). The SBML
core speciﬁcation defines quantitative processes, such as reac-
tions, events, rules and constraints, in detail but no other rela-
tionships between molecules. Those relationships are denoted as
relations that specify enzyme—enzyme relations, protein—protein
interactions, interactions of transcription factors and genes, pro-
tein—compound interaction, links to other pathways, etc. These
relations are also provided in BioPAX models, but before the
creation of the Qualitative Models extension for SBML (qual,
see Berenguier et al., 2011), it was not possible to define those
relations or to include reactions together with relations in one
model.Hence, new BioPAX to SBML converters are needed.

Today, there exist mainly converters from SBML to BioPAX
like The System Biology Format Converter (see European
Bioinformatics Institute—Computational Systems Neurobiology
Group, 2011), but no converter for BioPAX to SBML that is
capable of properly including relations. Other research groups
previously faced the same problem with incompatibilities be-
tween BioPAX and SBML. To overcome the limitations of
those file formats and to avoid the creation of pseudo-reactions
or similar constructions, Rubenacker et al. (2009) introduce an
intermediate bridging format. The need to combine both formats
to use the knowledge from a multitude of databases in various
applications becomes more and more urgent.

In this article, we present a webtool for the translation from
BioPAX into SBML format. We demonstrate its functionality by
converting the whole PID from BioPAX Level 2 and Level 3
formats to the SBML format, including the qual extension.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 SBML and the qualitative models extension

The SBML Level 3 Version 1 core specification defines a special XML
dialect to describe quantitative models. The most important classes are
species, describing reactive species, and reactions, which intercon-
nect species elements. A species element can be further speciﬁed
with the aid of MIRIAM annotations (Novere et al., 2005). The SBML
core specification provides several constructs to describe quantitative

processes, such as events, rules, constraints and reactions, but there is no
possibility to deﬁne qualitative relationships.

The SBML Qualitative Models extension (qual) introduces qualitative
elements, such as qualitativeSpecies and transition, providing
the necessary means to describe relationships that cannot be described by
reactions, for instance, enzyme—enzyme relations or interactions of tran-
scription factors and genes (Berenguier et al., 2011). Instead of the quan-
tities associated to species, which are affected by reactions,
qualitat iveSpecies exhibit discrete states, representing their activ-
ities that are changed using transitions. These transitions are linked to
input and output elements. The sign attribute of the input elem-
ents describes whether the relationship between the input and output
elements is positive, negative, dual or unknown. Dual means that the tran-
sition can operate both activating (positive) and inhibiting (negative). In
contrast, unknown is assigned to the input if the transition effect is not
further speciﬁed. If, in a qualitative model, the activity of Protein A
inhibits the activity of Protein B, this would be represented as a transition
with an input A, whose sign attribute is negative, and an output B.

2.2 The BioPAX speciﬁcation

The BioPAX is a web ontology language (OWL) dialect based on
RDF. There is one superclass called Entity that is extended by all
other BioPAX classes. Two main classes are distinguished:
PhysicalEntity and Interaction. PhysicalEntity describes
molecules, such as proteins, complexes, small molecules, DNA or
RNA, whereas Interaction deﬁnes reactions and relations between
PhysicalEntity Classes. Interaction is split into Control and
Conversion, which can be separated in several subclasses (see Fig. l).

BioPAX is released level-wise with the current level being Level 3.
Level 1 is exclusively able to describe metabolic interactions, whereas
Level 2 supports signaling pathways and molecular interactions. In add-
ition to Level 2, gene-regulatory networks and genetic interactions can be
described with Level 3. For this purpose, several new BioPAX instances
have been added (see dashed elements in Fig. 1). Level 3 is not down-
wards compatible with Level 2, but Level 2 is downwards compatible
with Level 1 (Demir et al., 2010). The BioPAX speciﬁcation of Level 2
denotes all classes in lower case typewriter font and the speciﬁcation of
Level 3 denotes them in upper case typewriter font. For better readability
of this article, all BioPAX element names begin with capital letters and
refer to Levels 2 and 3. In contrast, SBML classes are written in lower
case.

2.3 Conversion of BioPAX to SBML qual

The complete nature PID has been converted from BioPAX to SBML
Level 3 Version 1 including the qualitative models extension (qual). PID
provides curated pathways from the National Cancer Institute (L2/L3
2012-03-16), pathways from BioCarta (L2 2009-09-09, L3 2010-08-10)
and human Reactome pathways (L2/L3 2010-08-10 Schaefer
et al., 2009). The translation of the BioPAX Level 2 and Level 3 pathway
ﬁles is performed in four steps: (i) initializing the models, (ii) translation
of PhysicalEntity elements, (iii) translation of Interaction elem-
ents and (iv) annotation of all species. An overview of the mapping
from BioPAX elements to SBML and to SBML qual elements is shown
in Figure l.

2.3.] Step I: initializing the models First, the pathway organism
is determined by searching for the BioSource reference in the BioPAX
ﬁle. Furthermore, the SBML model and qualitativeModel are
built. Both models correspond to the complete pathway represented in
the BioPAX ﬁle.

2.3.2 Step 2.‘ translation of PhysicalEntity elements Each
BioPAX Entity is converted to an SBML species and
qualitativeSpecies. In BioPAX, one can specify the nature of

the real entity by classes that are derived from Entity (e.g. DNA and
Protein). SBML does not contain speciﬁc entities that can be derived
from an SBML species. The common way to separate different gen-
omic entities in SBML is using SBO terms from the material entity
branch. This table speciﬁes the SB0 terms that we used to distinguish
between various cellular entities in SBML.

In this step, an SBML species and qualitativeSpecies are
created for each PhysicalEntity. Depending on the kind of the
PhysicalEntity, i.e. if it is a protein, complex, DNA, RNA or
small molecule, the species is annotated with the corresponding SBO
term (Courtot et al., 2011). The used SBO terms are listed in Table 1.
Furthermore, the species compartment is assigned due to the
CellularLocation 0f the PhysicalEntity. The default compart-
ment is set if the CellularLocation is not known.

Then, the BioPAX document is mined for an RDF link from the
PhysicalEntity to a corresponding Entrez Gene ID. These identifers
are unique and facilitate the automated annotation of this species
(described in the fourth step). If there exists no Gene ID but a gene
symbol, the gene symbol is mapped to a Gene ID.

2.3.3 Step 3.‘ translation of Interaction elements BioPAX
Interaction elements are translated into SBML core reactions
and qual transitions. An SBML transition describes relation-
ships between molecules that cannot be translated into reactions.
Examples for such relationships are enzyme—enzyme relations, protein—
protein interactions, interactions of transcription factors and genes, pro-
tein—compound interaction, links to other pathways, etc. BioPAX
Interaction elements can be split into Conversion and Control
elements.

The translation of the Conversion elements is straightforward, be-
cause all elements can unambiguously be mapped to SBML reactions.
The translation of those elements is performed by creating the same
reaction with all substrates, products and enzymes in SBML.
Furthermore, the stoichiometry of the reactants and products of
BiochemicalReaction and TransportWithBiochemical
Reaction is also translated into SBML.

The translation of Control elements is more complicated, because
they are translated into a transition or a reaction depending on
enclosed Control elements. Control elements always consist of zero
or more Controller and zero or one Controlled elements.
Controller elements are inherited from PhysicalEntity or
Pathway, whereas Controlled elements are also Interaction
elements. Thus, it depends on the kind of Controller and
Controlled element whether the Interaction is translated into an
SBML reaction or transition. All Controller—Controlled
combinations and the corresponding SBML classes are listed in Table 2
and discussed in more detail in Supplementary Information. For nearly
all Control elements, a ControlType is assigned describing the rela-
tionship between the enclosed elements (i.e. activating, inhibiting).
Depending on this type, the sign attribute of the SBML input element
is determined.

2.3.4 Step 4: annotation of the translated model Finally, the
SBML instances are further annotated. The BioPAX speciﬁcation
allows users to encode arbitrary identiﬁers for elements. These can
be identiﬁers for various databases, e.g. UniProt, Entrez Gene and
Ensembl. Unfortunately, the syntax used in BioPAX is sometimes
inconsistent, which leads to XML database annotations like
‘UniProt’ or ‘UniProtKB’ within BioPAX documents that hamper the
automatic reading and interpretation of those models by third-party
applications.

In SBML, such identiﬁers can be expressed as standardized MIRIAM
URNs that can be added as annotation to any SBML element. We sup-
port and add MIRIAM identiﬁers for the following databases: Entrez
Gene, Omim, Ensembl, UniProt, ChEBI, DrugBank, Gene Ontology,

Fig. 1. Conversion from BioPAX Level 2 and Level 3 to SBML Level 3 Version 1 with the Qualitative Models extension (qual). The green rounded
rectangles on the right-hand side describe the SBML and qual classes, and the blue ones on the left the BioPAX elements. The distinction between
BioPAX Level 2 and Level 3 elements is Visualized with dashed rectangles. The dashed rectangles denote elements, which are only available in Level 3.
All other elements occur in both levels. The ancestry of both BioPAX and SBML elements is indicated with arrows. Lines, ending with a diamond,
indicate elements that are contained in other elements. The conversion from BioPAX to SBML qual is drawn with black lines. For some BioPAX
elements, it depends on the enclosed entities if the BioPAX element is translated into a reaction or to a relation. This translation dependency is Visualized
with black dashed lines. A detailed translation description of those elements is shown in Table 2

Each BioPAX Entity is converted to an SBML species and
qualitativeSpecies. In BioPAX, one can specify the nature of the real
entity by classes that are derived from Entity (e.g., DNA, Protein, etc). SBML
does not contain speciﬁc entities that can be derived from an SBML species. The
common way to separate different genomic entities in SBML is using SBO terms
from the material entity branch. This table speciﬁes the SB0 terms that we used to
distinguish between various cellular entities in SBML.

HGNC, PubChem, 3DMET, NCBI Taxonomy, PDBeChem,
GlycomeDB, LipidBank, EC-Numbers (enzyme nomenclature) and vari-
ous KEGG databases (gene, glycan, reaction, compound, drug, pathway
and orthology). To obtain identiﬁers for those databases, we map the
Entrez Gene identiﬁer, which we annotated on every element in Step 2, to
a KEGG identiﬁer. Using the KEGG API, we then query all of those
identiﬁers to retrieve more descriptive names, descriptions of the elements
and the mentioned database identiﬁers. The goal of those annotations is
to provide models whose components can uniquely be identiﬁed by any
application and be linked to external data sources.

BioPAX Control elements consist of a Controller and one or
more Controlled elements. Depending on the kind of Controller
or Controlled element, the Control entity is translated into an
SBML reaction or transition. The table gives an overview of this conver-
sion regarding BioPAX Level 2 and BioPAX Level 3.

2.4 Implementation

The conversion was implemented in JavaTM, using JSBML (Drager
et al., 2011) with the Qualitative Models extension, PaxTools (Demir
et al., 2010) and the KEGG API (Kanehisa et al., 2006). PaxTools was

used to read the BioPAX ﬁles and to manipulate the information content.
With the aid of the KEGG API, this information was extended with
MIRIAM identiﬁers (Novere et al., 2005) from the various databases,
for instance Entrez Gene, Ensembl and UniProt.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The PID is a curated and peer-reviewed pathway database con-
taining human pathways with molecular signaling and regulatory
events provided by the Nature Cancer Institute, BioCarta, and
Reactome. All pathways are provided in XML, BioPAX Level 2
and Level 3 format.

The BioPAX format is perfectly suitable to encode pathway
relations and reactions that can be further used for Visualization
or pathway analysis. However, this format also has its limitations.
Many applications, especially for simulation and modeling
of biological networks, use the SBML format (Funahashi
et al., 2007; Hoops et al., 2006; Zinovyev et al., 2008). Therefore,
a few importers and converters for BioPAX into SBML have been
developed. BioPAX Entity elements, which can be genes,

proteins, small molecules, etc., can be translated into SBML spe —
c i es and the type of the BioPAX Ent i ty can be encoded as SBO
term or MIRIAM annotation of the species itself. Relations be-
tween Enti ty elements, corresponding to edges in a pathway
graph, are also provided with detailed information in BioPAX.
These relations can be transports, biochemical reactions, complex
assemblies, etc. At this point, most translations to SBML usually
produce errors or have a massive loss of information because the
SBML core speciﬁcation only provides reactions, which represents
real biochemical reactions with substrates, products and enzymes.
Processes, such as modulation of an entity by another one, cannot
directly be encoded as a reaction, at least not without knowing the
exact chemical equation. Hence, former conversion approaches
from BioPAX to SBML did either incorrectly convert those rela-
tions to reactions or simply removed them during the translation.
To ﬁll this gap, the SBML community has recently developed the
qual speciﬁcation, which allows users to model arbitrary transi-
tions between species.

Furthermore, the models themselves just provide the base for
further analysis or Visualization methods. Other applications,

such as Clandestine (Funahashi et al., 2007) or COPASI (Hoops
et al., 2006), focus on Visualization, simulation, analysis, etc. of
those models. Therefore, most of those applications have certain
requirements on the models. For example, to uniquely map mass
spectrometry data on a model, it may be required for the model
to have UniProt IDs. To match mRNA expression data or per-
form gene set enrichment analyses, Entrez Gene identiﬁers might
be required. Consequently, we provide all annotations that we
could gather from the input BioPAX ﬁles also in the SBML ﬁles
and further annotate all species with a plethora of additional
identiﬁers.

The qual extension has been created recently and, thus,
might not be supported by all applications, yet. Therefore, we
decided to build joint SBML core and qual models. All our
SBML ﬁles contain a model that corresponds to the SBML
core speciﬁcation and an additional qualitativeModel
that contains all relations. These models are compatible with
older applications that do not yet support qual but still can
read all species and reactions. Newer applications that
are ready to handle relations can read the additional qual
model and process all information that was also available in
the BioPAX ﬁle.

We converted both the Level 2 and the Level 3 BioPAX ﬁles
to SBML core, including the qual extension. The reason for
converting both levels was the additional description possibility of
gene-regulatory networks and genetic interactions in BioPAX
Level 3, which is not supported by Level 2 pathway models.
Since older simulation applications still work with BioPAX

Table 3. Comparison of different available converters for BioPAX pathways

Level 2, we also translated these ﬁles into SBML in order to pre-
vent loss of information and to be able to use these models, too. All
models are available at http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/
downloads/Qualitative—Models/. Furthermore, we provide our
webtool BioPAX2SBML for further BioPAX translations at
http: //webservices .cs .uni-tuebingen. de/.

3.1 Comparison to other BioPAX to SBML converters

Only a few approaches exist to convert BioPAX to SBML and
the existing ones use a simple one-to-one conversion without
augmenting the ﬁle content for further modeling steps. This
might be due to the fact that ‘the inter-conversion between
BioPAX and SBML is not trivial as both formats were developed
for different purposes’ (Bauer-Mehren et al., 2009). Sybill
(Rubenacker et al., 2009) and BiNoM (Zinovyev et al., 2008)
are two approaches that can be used for the translation of
BioPAX into SBML but none of them is able to appropriately
translate signaling networks. Sybill is a stand-alone tool that is
also integrated in the quantitative modeling environment VCell
(Slepchenko et al., 2003). In contrast, BiNoM is a Cytoscape
plugin (Smoot et al., 2011), which offers the possibility to open
BioPAX Level 3 ﬁles. It mainly focuses on the Visualization of
BioPAX ﬁles and not on the actual conversion into SBML.
Table 3 compares these programs based on deﬁned criteria.
Sybill converts BioPAX Level 2 and Level 3 ﬁles and has a
very comfortable graphical user interface allowing the user to
manipulate the conversion result. Unfortunately, the converted
SBML ﬁles are not complete and the validator from sbml.org

This table compares three applications that are able to translate BioPAX into SBML. The checkmark (J) indicates that the criterion is completely fulﬁlled, the circle (0)
shows that the criterion is partially fulﬁlled and the minus (—) is used if it is not fulﬁlled. A conversion is valid if the validator from sbml.org reports no errors in the converted
SBML ﬁle and the converted model is complete if no BioPAX entity is missing. The No duplicate entities criterion is important for modeling purposes to guarantee that a
species is only mentioned once. A converter is robust if it can handle all tested ﬁles from the Pathway Interaction Database and is able to convert a BioPAX ﬁle, which contains
no Pathway element. The Compartments, Stoichiometry, and Uses SBO terms criteria denote if this information is translated into SBML and if the SBML species are denoted
with the corresponding SBO term. Additionally, it is checked if the BioPAX cross-references (Xrefs) are translated into SBML controlled vocabulary terms (CV terms) and if
the SBML model is augmented with further information, such as Entrez Gene IDs. Finally, the provenance criterion denotes if the ﬁle history and conversion tool information

is saved in the converted SBML ﬁle.

reports errors, because species involved in several reactions are
missing in the l istO f Species. Additionally, some groups and
pathway links are missing, too. BiNoM generates a complete
conversion result, but the validator also reports errors due to
empty listOf elements and due to the wrong order of these
elements. In contrast to Sybill, BiNoM converts BioPAX ﬁles
without a pathway element, but is only able to handle a small
number of BioPAX ﬁles from the PID. Another feature of
BiNoM is that it can separately Visualize reaction networks,
pathway structure and protein—protein interaction networks
out of one BioPAX ﬁle.

All approaches avoid the translation of duplicate species. Only
BioPAX2SBML converter uses the qual extension and SBO
terms for detailed species description, translates the BioPAX
cross-references (Xref s) into SBML CV terms and augments
the SBML ﬁle content with further database cross-references.

4 CONCLUSION

Conversion between different formats is important in all parts of
computer science. In many cases, conversion leads to errors or a
loss of information. The BioPAX to SBML conversion is such an
example. Due to limitations of the SBML core speciﬁcation, it
was not possible to include all relationships between reactive
species from BioPAX ﬁles in SBML ﬁles, while producing cor-
rect SBML code. But with SBML Level 3 Version 1 and the
addition of extensions to the speciﬁcations, in particular the
qualitative models extension (qual), it is now possible to create
accurate and speciﬁcation-conform SBML code. Using this ex-
tension, we produced error-free SBML models while minimizing
or even eliminating the loss of information during the
translation.

The SBML models, provided along with this publication, con-
sist of SBML species and, wherever possible, exact reac—
tion equations. All relations from the BioPAX documents
that could not be converted to exact reactions have been included
as qualitative transitions between qualitative species. Additional
information, such as various identiﬁers or the type of an entity,
are encoded as SBO terms or MIRIAM URNs of the corres-
ponding elements. By utilizing the KEGG API, it was even pos-
sible to complement the translated BioPAX documents with a
wealth of information from further databases, such as Entrez
Gene and KEGG.

Compared to existing conversion approaches with similar
scope, BioPAX2SBML conversions result in comprehensive
and correct SBML models, created for all pathways in the
nature PID. These models can easily be used, e.g., for further
simulation and modeling steps, without having to deal with in-
correct input ﬁle formats or error-prone conversions.

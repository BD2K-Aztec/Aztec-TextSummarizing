Abstract

Motivation: Orphan genes, also known as ORFans, are newly evolved genes in a genome that
enable the organism to adapt to specific living environment. The gene content of every sequenced
genome can be classified into different age groups, based on how widely/narrowly a gene’s homo-
logs are distributed in the context of species taxonomy. Those having homologs restricted to
organisms of particular taxonomic ranks are classified as taxonomically restricted ORFans.

Results: Implementing this idea, we have developed an open source program named ORFanFinder
and a free web server to allow automated classification of a genome’s gene content and identifica-
tion of ORFans at different taxonomic ranks. ORFanFinder and its web server will contribute to the
comparative genomics field by facilitating the study of the origin of new genes and the emergence

of lineage-specific traits in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

1 Introduction

ORFans stand for orphan Open Reading Frames (Fischer and
Eisenberg, 1999). In addition to ORFans, in literature orphan genes
are also known as new genes, lineage-specific genes (LSGs) and
taxonomically restricted genes (TRGs) (Tautz and Domazet-Loso,
2011), although some terms are used in very specific contexts, e.g.
de novo originated new genes. Orphan genes (hereafter ORFans) are
new inventions of a genome that enable the organism to adapt to its
specific living environment. They are fundamentally important for
the origin of new species and the emergence of lineage-specific traits,
e.g. morphological diversity, metabolic innovation and pathogen-
icity (Chen et al., 2013; Khalturin et al., 2009).

ORFans are usually identified by using sequence similarity
search tools such as BLAST (Fischer and Eisenberg, 1999; Yin and
Fischer, 2006). The simple BLAST method tends to identify very
narrowly distributed ORFans and cannot classify ORFans into
groups of different ages. Therefore the phylogeny-based approach
was developed to map BLAST hits onto a species phylogeny, which
allows identifying ORFans of different ages. One method using

this approach (Daubin and Ochman, 2004) required a well-
accepted species phylogeny, often not available for non-model or-
ganisms. Another method termed phylostratigraphy approach
(Domazet-Loso et al., 2007) also required a phylogeny, which
however is derived from the query species’ taxonomic lineage.
Although the phylostratigraphy approach was recently shown to
have some limitations (Moyers and Zhang, 2015), it has been
widely used to study ORFans in various organisms (e.g.
Carvunis et al., 2012; Guo, 2013). However, the phylogeny-based
methods are more difficult to automate and often need human
intervention.

Here, we present a new tool ORFanFinder and its web server.
ORFanFinder is fully automated and the results are completely re-
producible. While the algorithm behind ORFanFinder is essentially
based on the phylostratigraphy approach (Domazet-Loso et al.,
2007), it is more strictly formulated for the purpose of complete
automation. To our knowledge ORFanFinder is the only open
source computer software and the first online server for ORFan
identification and classification.

2 Algorithm

In our algorithm, the query genome and all the sequences in the data-
bases should have their taxonomic ranks known. For example,
Escherichia coli MG1655 has the following taxonomic lineage: Bacteria
(superkingdom); Proteohacteria (phylum); Gammaproteohacteria
(class); Enterohacteriales (order); Enterohacteriaceae (family);
Escherichia (genus); Escherichia coli (species) according to the NCBI’s
Taxonomy database.

M: If the query genome Q is in the databases, exclude it be-
fore doing BLAST search. W: In the BLAST result, for each gene
g of the query genome Q, record the subject genomes (Hi, i = 1, . . .,
la) that g has hit(s) in. M: Suppose Q has the following taxonomy
ranks: species S, genus G, family F, order O, class C and phylum P.
Our program considers all named ranks (including e.g. subclass and
tribe), while ‘no ranks’ are excluded because they appear at multiple
levels in the hierarchy. W: Examine the taxonomy ranks of the
subject genomes H,-: which phyla (let P], be an array of phyla of the
subject genomes) and how many phyla (let #Ph be the number of
elements in P1,) do they belong to? If they all belong to a same phy-
lum, which classes (C1,) and how many classes (#Ch) do they belong
to? This is done recursively until it reaches the bottom species rank.
M: For each gene g of the query genome Q, determine if it is an
ORFan and if yes, classify it using the pseudocodes shown in Fig. 1
(include only 7 ranks for simplicity but more ranks could be pos-
sible). This algorithm is very efficient in genome-wide ORFan identi-
fication, with the limitation that sporadically distributed genes
(often horizontally transferred or rapidly evolved) are treated
equally as universally distributed genes in our algorithm.

In addition to similarity information, other information like syn-
tenic (gene order) information has also been used to assist ORFan
identification in closely related species (Zhang et al., 2010).
Incorporating this information in the ORFanFinder algorithm is cur-
rently not possible as determining gene order itself is a highly chal-
lenging problem: gene order is far less conserved than gene sequences.

3 Implementation

Standalone program: The ORFanFinder program was written in C
language. It expects a BLAST search result file (tabular format) as
the input. For example, to identify ORFans in E. coli MG165 5 gen-
ome one has BLASTed all its 4141 proteins against the NCBI nr
database. ORFanFinder program will require the following as the
inputs: (i) the taxonomy ID of E. coli MG1655, which is 511145;
(ii) a query ID file with all the 4141 protein IDs of MG1655; (iii) a
taxonomy node file parsed from NCBI taxonomy database’s
nodes.dmp file; (iv) a NCBI nr ID—taxonomy ID mapping file. In
fact, along with the ORFanFinder program, the software package
has included pre-computed files to be used in (iii) and (iv), if one has
searched against the NCBI nr database or the UniProt database. If
one intends to use a different BLAST database, we have detailed in-
structions in a readme file on how to make a customized file for (iii)
and (iv). The output of ORFanFinder is a tab-delimited file contain-
ing two columns: protein IDs of the query genome and ORFan
group (e.g. species ORFan).

Web server: In addition to the standalone program, a web server was
developed for users who do not have programming experience. Two
types of data are allowed to submit to our web server: (i) FASTA
format sequences, which will be used to run BLAST against NCBI-
nr and then run ORFanFinder on a Linux cluster; (ii) tabular format
(-outfmt 6) BLAST result file, which is pre-computed by the user
elsewhere, e.g. on their own computers. It should be noted that run-
ning BLAST search against a large database such as NCBI-nr is the
most time-consuming, while the ORFanFinder program itself runs
relatively much faster.

4 Evaluation

To assess ORFanFinder’s performance, we have run it on the prote-
omes of E. coli MG1655 (Taxonomy ID: 511145) and Arabidopsis
thaliana (Taxonomy ID: 3702). ORFans of the two species have
been extensively studied in previous papers (e.g. Daubin and
Ochman, 2004 and Yu and Stoltzfus, 2012 for E. coli and
Donoghue et al., 2011 and Lin et al., 2010 for A. thaliana).
Comparing to these previous ORFan sets shows that ORFanFinder
performs fairly well (sensitivity 2 91 .9% and specificity = 71.5% for
E. coli and sensitivity 2 91.6% and specificity = 72.2% for A. thali-
ana). The detailed results are available in Supplementary data.

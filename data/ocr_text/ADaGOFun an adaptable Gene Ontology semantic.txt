Abstract

Summary: Gene Ontology (GO) semantic similarity measures are being used for biological knowledge
discovery based on GO annotations by integrating biological information contained in the GO structure
into data analyses. To empower users to quickly compute, manipulate and explore these measures,
we introduce A-DaGO-Fun (ADaptable Gene Ontology semantic similarity-based Functional analysis).
It is a portable software package integrating all known GO information content-based semantic similar-
ity measures and relevant biological applications associated with these measures. A-DaGO-Fun has
the advantage not only of handling datasets from the current high-throughput genome-wide applica-
tions, but also allowing users to choose the most relevant semantic similarity approach for their biolo-
gical applications and to adapt a given module to their needs.

Availability and implementation: A-DaGO-Fun is freely available to the research community at
http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/ITGOM/adagofun. It is implemented in Linux using Python under free soft-
ware (GNU General Public Licence).

1 Introduction

 

Recent years have experienced an exponential growth of publicly
available and accessible genomics, proteomics and other biological
data resulting from high-throughput biology technologies and compu-
tational scanning approaches. Retrieving information from these dif-
ferent biological data constitutes an essential step and challenging task
which requires the use of computational tools and algorithms for
translating these data into different applications. In the context of
functional annotation data, the Gene Ontology (GO-Consortium,
2012) provides a way of consistently describing genes and proteins in
any organism, producing a well-adapted platform to computationally
process data at the functional level. Currently, ~30 629 514 proteins
are already annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms in the existing

biological databases (see the latest version of GOA UniProt version
143 at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/uniprot_release, released on 27
May, 2015), thus enabling protein comparisons on the basis of their
GO annotations. Several semantic similarity (55) measures (Mazandu
and Mulder, 2013b, 2014) have been suggested to tackle major chal-
lenges for knowledge discovery based on these GO annotations.
The recent proliferation of these measures in the biomedical and bio-
informatics areas was accompanied by the development of tools
(http://neurolex.org/wiki/CategoryzResource:Gene_Ontology_Tools)
that facilitate effective exploration of these measures. These tools in-
clude software packages and web-based on-line tools.

None of these tools support all relevant topology-based
approaches in the context of GO, except the DaGO-Fun on-line tool

(Mazandu and Mulder, 2013a) implementing the GO-universal met-
ric, the Wang et al. (2007) and Zhang et al. (2006) approaches, the
G-SESAME on—line tool (Du et al., 2009) and the GOSemSim R
package (Yu et al., 2010) which implement the Wang et al. (2007)
approach. These tools are often context dependent and only imple-
ment SS measures shown to perform well in a specific application.
Moreover, these tools work only for proteins contained in the GOA
dataset or existing GO-annotated organisms for SS calculations and
each has its specific gene or protein identifier (ID) system, making it
difficult to meet input requirements of current genome- and prote-
ome-wide applications from high-throughput analysis. Here, we pre-
sent A-DaGO-Fun (ADaptable Gene Ontology semantic similarity-
based Functional analysis), which overcomes these limitations, ena-
bling effective exploration of different protein functional similarity
measures, calibrating datasets from high-throughput experiment
analyses and providing researchers with the freedom to choose the
most relevant measure for their specific applications using their gene
or protein ID system and associated GO annotations.

2 Overview of A-DaGO-Fun

A-DaGO-Fun is a repository of python modules for analyzing protein
or gene sets at the functional level based on GO annotations using in-
formation content-based SS measures. It contains six main functions
and implements 101 different functional similarity measures (see
Supplementary File). Each of the eight annotation-based and three
topology-based approaches, namely Resnik, XGraSM-Resnik,
Nunivers, XGraSM-Nunivers, Lin, XGraSM-Lin, Relevance and Li
et al. (2010), Wang et al. (2007), Zhang et al. (2006), and GO-univer-
sal, is implemented with seven known term pairwise-based functional
similarity measures: Avg, Max, ABM, BMA, BMM, HDF and VHDF
(see Supplementary File, Appendix 2). A-DaGO-Fun also includes the
five IC-based (Information content-based) direct term functional simi-
larity measures: SimGIC, SimDIC, SimUIC and Cosine (SimCOU and
SimCOT) for the annotation-based and each of the three topology-
based approaches, and the following particular cases: SimUI, SimDB
and SimUB, as well as the Normalized Term Overlap (NTO) measure.
Depending on the function being used, the user inputs may be two
GO terms, a GO term or GO term pair list or file, or proteins and
associated GO terms in a dictionary or file. Comprehensive summary
reports are generated and made available in a table format. More
details are provided in the supplementary File.

3 A-DaGO-Fun and other tools

As mentioned previously, there have been numerous tools developed
for producing GO term and protein SS scores and we refer the inter-
ested reader to the Supplementary File (Appendix 3) where these
tools are described in terms of SS measures and input size that each
tool supports. Each of these tools uses its specific gene ID system in
integrating and constructing its database. As examples, the three re-
cently introduced tools, KU-GOAL (Jeong and Chen, 2014),
GOssTo (Caniza et al., 2014), SML (Harispe et al., 2013) and
DaGO-Fun (Mazandu and Mulder, 2013a), use UniProt IDs. Thus,
the user’s datasets have to be aligned with tool ID requirements
when exploring SS measures from these tools. However, in the ID
mapping process, some annotation content may be left out of the SS
score retrieval, especially if the user input IDs are redundant or
some gene IDs cannot be efficiently mapped to their corresponding
annotation content. Another critical issue is that these tools are or-
ganism-based tools, except GOSim (Frohlich et al., 2007) and

DaGO-Fun (Mazandu and Mulder, 2013a), and use different infor-
mation content values for a term, whereas a term in the GO struc-
ture is expected to have a unique information content value which
should not depend on the corpus under consideration (Mazandu and
Mulder, 2013b). Furthermore, regardless of species coverage these
tools may not support less popular species and all existing tools are
very limited for newly annotated organisms.

A-DaGO-Fun solves these issues by storing term IC values precom-
puted using the GO structure and protein GO annotations as provided
by the GOA dataset (Huntley et al., 2014). This enables it to handle
any dataset under any ID system with their associated GO annotations
and to quickly respond to user queries as shown in Fig. 1. These results
show that A-DaGO-Fun retrieves SS scores faster than existing soft-
ware packages (Caniza et al., 2014; Harispe et al., 2013), outputting
SS scores in a few seconds. A-DaGO-Fun outputs SS scores of a 100
MB file of protein pairs in 213.77 s (or 3 min 34 s) and 692.24 s (or 11
min 32 s) on average using IC- and pairwise-based functional similar-
ity measures, respectively, and in 34.29, 24.53 and 24.45 s for biolo-
gical process, molecular function and cellular component term
pairwise files respectively, compared to SML producing these scores in
133 min 27 s (Harispe et al., 2013). Furthermore, A-DaGO-Fun imple-
ments topology-based approaches producing a fixed and well-defined
information content value for a given GO term independent of the cor-
pus under consideration.

4 Conclusion

A-DaGO-Fun provides a python portable application to the large
community of GO users and to a broad computational audience,
enabling tool designers or developers and experienced end-users as
well as non-programmers to retrieve SS scores. This application can
be extended, modified and adapted to a defined user need, ensuring
that GO SS data and related biological applications are conveniently
accessible to researchers and can effectively be used in their func-
tional analyses based on GO annotations.

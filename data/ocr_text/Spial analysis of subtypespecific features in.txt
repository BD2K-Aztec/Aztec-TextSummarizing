ABSTRACT

Motivation: Spial (Specificity in alignments) is a tool for the
comparative analysis of two alignments of evolutionarily related
sequences that differ in their function, such as two receptor subtypes.
It highlights functionally important residues that are either specific
to one of the two alignments or conserved across both alignments.
lt permits visualization of this information in three complementary
ways: by colour-coding alignment positions, by sequence logos
and optionally by colour-coding the residues of a protein structure
provided by the user. This can aid in the detection of residues that
are involved in the subtype-specific interaction with a ligand, other
proteins or nucleic acids. Spial may also be used to detect residues
that may be post-translationally modified in one of the two sets of
sequences.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identifying residues in proteins that are associated with speciﬁc
functions is a recurring task in molecular biology. To assist this, we
have developed Spial (Speciﬁcity in alignments), a web—based tool
that allows the comparative analysis of two related protein subtypes
(Fig. 1A). Spial differs from other related tools by allowing the
simultaneous identiﬁcation of residues that are (i) either speciﬁc
to one of the two subtypes but not the other and/or (ii) conserved
across the two subtypes. It also permits Visualization using sequence
logo and coloured alignments and mapping this information on to a
representative structure, if available.

For example, when comparing the alignments of two related
receptor subtypes that bind two different ligands, Spial allows the
identiﬁcation of residues that are speciﬁc to the binding of each
of the ligands. For this, Spial takes two related sets of sequences or
alignments as input and assigns each residue to one of eight possible
types, depending on whether it is speciﬁc to the ﬁrst alignment,

Spial accepts sequences or multiple sequence alignments as input.
In the case of submitting sequences, they are ﬁrst combined together,
aligned using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) and then split into two
separate sets of alignments. In the case of submitting alignments,
they are accepted in FASTA and SELEX formats. The sequences
in the two input alignments should originate from related protein
subfamilies. The alignments have to be of the same length and the
positions in both alignments have to correspond. In rest of this
article, we refer to these two alignments as alignments A and B,
respectively. Additionally, Spial accepts a protein structure in the

Protein Data Bank (PDB) format as input. In this case, the sequence
of the structure should be present and indicated in the input.

For each position in the two input alignments A and B, Spial
decides whether the residue is in consensus or not. In order
for an amino acid to be in consensus, it has to be present
above a user—speciﬁed threshold proportion in both alignments. In
Figure 1A, a consensus threshold value of 0.35 (default value)
was used. Next, Spial decides whether there are amino acids
that are speciﬁc for one of the two alignments, but not for
the consensus. For this, a non—consensus amino acid has to be
present above a user—speciﬁed threshold proportion in one of the
alignments. In Figure 1A, a speciﬁcity threshold value of 0.35
(default value) was used. As long as the sum of the consensus
threshold and the speciﬁcity threshold is lower than one, a position
can be in the consensus and speciﬁc to one of the alignments
at the same time (Supplementary Material at http://www.mrc—
lmb.cam.ac.uk/genomes/spial/help.html). Therefore, there are eight
possible combinations of speciﬁcity for alignment A, alignment B or
the consensus (Fig. 1B). We here refer to these eight combinations as
types. Each position in an alignment can also be one of three possible
categories, which indicate whether the position is in the consensus
(C), speciﬁc to one or both of the input alignments but not in the
consensus (S), or not speciﬁc at all (0). The one—letter codes that
specify the types and categories of each residue are located in two
rows below the Spial output alignment (Fig. 1A).

Spial’s output consists of coloured alignments as described above,
of sequence logos (Crooks et al., 2004; Schneider and Stephens,
1990), and of coloured protein structures (Fig. l). The logos
produced by Spial appear similar to those produced by the program
Two Sample Logo (Vacic et al., 2006), which treats one alignment
as the background and then computes whether there are residues
that are enriched or depleted in the other alignment. Spial logos
differ from this by Visualizing how frequent a residue is in either
alignment, or, if it is a consensus residue, how frequent it is in the
consensus. In the output protein structures, the default colouring
scheme differs from that used in the alignments. The colour of
each protein residue reﬂects whether it is speciﬁc to alignment
A (red), speciﬁc to alignment B (blue), speciﬁc to both (pink)
or speciﬁc to neither (black). The structure, coloured using this
scheme, can be Viewed either directly in the browser using Jmol
(http://www.jmol.org/), or by loading the structure into the PyMol
(http://www.pymol.org/) structure Viewer and then running a script
that is provided by Spial. Another option offered by Spial is the
colouring of residues according to residue type as deﬁned above.

Spial is a versatile tool with a number of potential applications.
Scenarios in which Spial may be useful include: (i) Of a number
of homologous proteins, some bind a certain ligand or drug while
others do not. Spial can assist in identifying surface patches that
are speciﬁc to the proteins that bind the ligand. (ii) A protein has
homologues in two different evolutionary lineages. Spial can assist
in identifying residues that are speciﬁc to either lineage, and those
that are conserved in both. (iii) Of a number of paralogues in a
genome, some have a speciﬁc function while others do not. Spial
can assist in identifying the residues that are speciﬁc to the proteins
that have the function of interest. (iV) Spial can assist in identifying
residues that undergo post—translational modiﬁcations by running
an alignment of sequences that are commonly modiﬁed against an
alignment of related sequences that are not.

Here, we use Spial to elucidate the differences in coordination
of retinal between vertebrate and cephalopod rhodopsin. Opsins
are a family of seven—helix membrane receptors that activate
G proteins in a light—dependent manner Via the photo—isomerization
of retinal in the protein. Vertebrate and invertebrate rhodopsins
are two subgroups of opsins. Though related, they differ in their
molecular properties and function. While vertebrate rhodopsin
activates the cGMP signalling pathway through the Gt—type
G—protein (Li et al., 2004), invertebrate rhodopsin activates the
BF pathway Via a Gq—type G protein (Murakami and Kouyama,
2008). The molecular causes of these functional differences still
remain unclear. We used the alignments of rhodopsin sequences
as available from GPCR database (http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/) as
input for Spial and mapped the results to the structure of squid
rhodopsin (Murakami and Kouyama, 2008). The result indicates
that although some residues that coordinate retinal are conserved
between vertebrate and cephalopod rhodopsin, this does not apply
to all of them. For example, Lys 305, which covalently binds retinal,
is conserved between both vertebrate and cephalopod rhodopsin.
Other hydrophobic residues in the retinal binding pocket, including
Phe 120 and Phe 188 are speciﬁc to cephalopod rhodopsin and are
not conserved in vertebrate rhodopsin. Phe 205, although it is part
of the binding pocket in the squid rhodopsin structure used here, is
generally not conserved in cephalopods but conserved in vertebrates.
The Spial output for this example is available at: http://www.mrc—
lmb.cam.ac.uk/genomes/spial/examples/example_rhodopsin.html.

In conclusion, Spial can be used as a tool for the detection and
Visualization of information about the speciﬁcity of protein residues.
This can aid in understanding protein function, protein—small
molecule, protein—nucleic acid and protein—protein interactions.

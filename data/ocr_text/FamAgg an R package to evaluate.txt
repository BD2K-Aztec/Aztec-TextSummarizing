Abstract

Summary: Familial aggregation analysis is the first fundamental step to perform when assessing
the extent of genetic background of a disease. However, there is a lack of software to analyze the fa-
milial clustering of complex phenotypes in very large pedigrees. Such pedigrees can be utilized to
calculate measures that express trait aggregation on both the family and individual level, providing
valuable directions in choosing families for detailed follow-up studies. We developed FamAgg,
an open source R package that contains both established and novel methods to investigate familial
aggregation of traits in large pedigrees. We demonstrate its use and interpretation by analyzing
a publicly available cancer dataset with more than 20 000 participants distributed across approxi-

mately 400 families.

Availability and implementation: The FamAgg package is freely available at the Bioconductor re-

pository, http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/FamAgg.

1 Introduction

The investigation of whether a disease or symptom trait recurs more
often among close relatives than in the general population is a deeply
rooted subject in genetic epidemiology, often termed as familial aggre-
gation analysis (Khoury et al., 1993). While segregation analysis was
the tool of choice to identify patterns of Mendelian diseases, there is
no unique method to highlight familial clusters for complex diseases,
especially in situations involving very large pedigrees lacking a regular
family structure. In this setting, more than three decades ago, a com-
putational method was first developed to highlight familial aggrega-
tion of various cancer types (Hill, 1980). The method was based on
the kinship coefficient <1>,~,~, which is the probability that two subjects 2'
and 7' share the same allele identical-by-descent at one locus, and rep-
resents a suitable measure to quantify the relationship between two
individuals in the pedigree (Malecot, 1948). In this early approach,
the average kinship between all affected pairs was compared to the

mean kinship of multiple sets of randomly selected matched controls
(Hill, 1980). This and other kinship-based methods have been suc-
cessfully applied to very large pedigrees to assess whether diseases
such as autism (Jorde et al., 1990) or Parkinson’s disease
(Sveinbjornsdottir et al., 2000) showed evidence of familial aggrega-
tion. The kinship-based approach was also extended to be used with
time-to-event data: the presence of familial clustering is assessed
based on disease incidence rates, thus accounting for the time to dis-
ease onset (Kerber, 1995).

Driven by the lack of open access tools for familial aggregation
analyses in large pedigrees, we have developed an R package provid-
ing this functionality. Besides basic pedigree analysis, sub-setting
and plotting methods, it implements the previously published meth-
ods based on average kinship and disease incidence rates as well as
two novel approaches to detect familial aggregation employing stat-
istics based on kinship coefficients combined with Monte Carlo
simulation techniques.

2 Implementation

The FamAgg package implements five family aggregation detection
methods that can be run on a single family or sets of families and
allow stratification according to different conditions such as gender,
age and generation.

The kinship sum (KS) test assesses whether an affected subject is
more closely related to other affected rather than unaffected cases in
the pedigree. Let A be the set of affected subjects and N the number of
simulation steps. The kinship sum of subject i to all other affected cases
is S,- 2 21-614, i¢i<I),-,-, whose null distribution S is obtained by N-time
random sampling of #(A) affected cases from the complete pedigree
without replacement. An empirical p-value for S,- is obtained as p,- =
P(S 2 8,).

In the kinship group (KG) test, for each affected individual i, its
most distant affected relative la is identified. We then define a group
G,- that includes all individuals 7' such that (1),,- 2 (Dik. For each group
G,, we calculate two null distributions, based on repeatedly random
sampling of #(A) affected individuals from the complete pedigree.
First, for each group G,- we compute the distribution of the number
of affected cases from the random sampling, which allows comput-
ing an empirical p-value p,- for finding by chance at least the number
of observed cases in group G,. Second, we provide a means to detect
clusters of closely related affected family members: for each group
G,- we derive the distribution of kinship coefficients (1),“ from the ran-
dom sampling for all affected individuals a. From this distribution
we calculate the empirical p-value to find a closer affected relative
than in the observed case.

The genealogical index of familiality (GIF) test (Hill, 1980) is a
pure family-based test. It computes the mean kinship KF (Malecot,
1948) for a selected family F, defined as the average kinship coeffi-
cient between all possible pairs of affected individuals i and j, and
creates a null distribution K of mean kinships of N sets of randomly
selected (optionally matched) controls. An empirical p-value is
derived as pp 2 P(K 2 KF).

The familial incidence rate (FIR) approach introduced by Kerber
(1995) concentrates on familial aggregation for individuals in longi-
tudinal studies. It is based on the incidence rate I = C/T, where C is
the number of incident cases and T is the total number of years an
individual was exposed to the risk of disease (person-years). This
measure has been refined by weighting the individual’s contribution
and time spent in the study by the kinship coefficient (1),,- to arrive at
a measure of familial incidence rate FR,- for any individual i.

Finally, we provide a convenience interface to compute the
exact probability of familial clustering (PFC) of phenotypes as pro-
vided in the gap R package (Yu et al., 2002). It contrasts the num-
ber of affected cases against family sizes in a contingency table but
the estimation of an exact p-value is possible only for families of
limited size, due to the high computational demand. The method is
based on the exact test for multinomial distributions, and therefore
its application to large pedigrees is possible only with the aid of
pedigree splitting software such as for example Jenti (Falchi et al.,
2008).

With the exception of the GIF method, which identifies aggrega-
tion of a trait in the full pedigree all kinship-based methods are
applied at the level of individuals and thus allow to identify either
individuals in families with significant aggregation (KS test), or
groups of highly clustered affected individuals within families (KG
test), or assess the risk for individuals given their relation to affected
individuals in the pedigree (FIR).

In addition to these familial aggregation methods, FamAgg pro-
vides functions to sub-set pedigrees, to identify common ancestors for

any given list of individuals, to identify matched controls within pedi-
grees and to convert pedigrees into graphs, which opens the whole
world of graph-theory methods to pedigree analyses. It uses the kin-
ship2 R package (Sinnwell et al., 2014) for kinship coefficient calcula-
tion and plotting, and provides a transparent interface to Haplopainter
software (Thiele et al., 2005). The open, object-oriented software archi-
tecture of the FamAgg package invites contribution of additional tests
from the research community. Extensive documentation and ex-
amples are distributed with the FamAgg package, which is available as
supplementary material.

3 Applications

We applied the KS, GIF, KG and FIR tests from the FamAgg pack-
age to the publicly available Minnesota Breast Cancer dataset
(Sellers et al., 1999), which contains genealogical information
from 426 unrelated affected founders whose families entered a

Fig. 1. Familial aggregation in the Minnesota Breast Cancer dataset. (A) Scatter
plot of —log1o(p-values) from the KS test (x—axis) and the GIF test (y-axis) com-
puted for all 426 families. Given the KS test provides a p—value for each affected
subject, the lowest p—value in each family is displayed. At a significance level of
0.05 (dashed lines), the GIF test identifies 34 families whereas the KS test identi-
fies 42 families. Filled circles and family identifiers are provided for the 14 fami-
lies when tests are jointly significant. For example, family 432 is top-ranked by
both tests: p—value = 1.3 x 10—3 and 9.6 x 10—5 with the GIF and KS test, re-
spectively. Non-significant family clusters are gray shaded. (B) Pedigree of fam-
ily 13, which is ranked second by the GIF test (p—value = 2.4 x 10—3). The family
comprises 29 phenotyped members and includes five affected females. If
known, age of cancer onset (cases) or age of demise is indicated below individ-
uals’ identifiers. For subject 410, S,-= 1.0 (0.25 x 3 affected sisters + 0.25 x 1 af-
fected daughter), with p—value = 1.3 x 10—2. Sisters 406, 408 and 409 have
equal S,-= 3 x 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.875 (p—value = 2.4 x 10—2), as they are aunts of
subject 419. The familial incidence rate of individual 410 is FR- = 8.7 x 10—3,
which is in the top percentile of all computed values in the Minnesota Breast
Cancer dataset

longitudinal study on cancer in the state of Minnesota (USA) in
1944. There are 1376 cases spread over these 426 families with a
median family size of 53 members, the largest family comprises of
382 individuals in six generations. The performed tests did not
utilize sampling stratification and the null distributions were calcu-
lated with N = 50 000 sampling steps. Runtimes on a single
2.4 GHz processor of a MacBook Pro with 16 GB of memory are
as follows: FIR test, 2 s; GIF test, 7min; KS test, 23 min; and KG
test, 3 h. At a significance level of 0.05, the KS test and the GIF test
identified 42 and 34 families with a significant enrichment of
cases, respectively. Figure 1A highlights the 14 families with filled
symbols where both the KS and the GIF tests identified significant
familial aggregation. Figure 1B provides an example of a smaller
family with breast cancer aggregation. The p-values are 2.4 X 10—3
for the GIF test and 1.3 X 10—2 for individual 410 according to the
KS test.

Figure 1 demonstrates that there is a certain agreement between
the methods. However, differences in the results from distinct meth-
ods are expected as each method is based on a slightly different ap-
proach to identify familial aggregation and therefore reports
different families at a specified significance level. We recommend
bearing in mind the underlying statistical test when interpreting the
results of a specific method.

Abstract

Summary: As the volume of patient—specific genome sequences increases the focus of biomedical
research is switching from the detection of disease—mutations to their interpretation. To this end a
number of techniques have been developed that use mutation data collected within a population to
predict whether individual genes are likely to be disease—causing or not. As both sequence data
and associated analysis tools proliferate, it becomes increasingly difficult for the community to
make sense of these data and their implications. Moreover, no single analysis tool is likely to cap—
ture all relevant genomic features that contribute to the gene’s pathogenicity. Here, we introduce
Web—based Gene Pathogenicity Analysis (WGPA), a web—based tool to analyze genes impacted by
mutations and rank them through the integration of existing prioritization tools, which assess dif—
ferent aspects of gene pathogenicity using population—level sequence data. Additionally, to explore
the polygenic contribution of mutations to disease, WGPA implements gene set enrichment ana—
lysis to prioritize disease—causing genes and gene interaction networks, therefore providing a com—
prehensive annotation of personal genomes data in disease.

1 Motivation

With the growing volume of patient—specific sequences that is
being generated there is an increasing need to annotate these data and
distinguish possible disease causing mutations from benign
mutations. To this end, a number of approaches have been developed
to prioritize genes based on their predicted pathogenicity using whole—
exome and whole—genome data. A recently introduced class of
approaches use the pattern of functional sequence variation (i.e. rare
and common mutations) observed in the human population (Petrovski
et 61]., 2013), the likelihood of observed mutations according to evolu—
tion (Rackham et 61]., 2014) or statistical modelling of genes under

selective constraint (Samocha et 61]., 2014) to prioritize (rank) disease—
causing genes from sets of genes impacted by mutations. Differently
from sequence variant—level analysis (e.g. PolyPhen2 (Adzhubei
et 61]., 2013)), these methods specifically allow a gene-level analysis of
pathogenicity, providing elegant, yet distinct schemes to evaluate the
significance for individual genes in disease (Enns et 61]., 2014; Shashi
et 61]., 2014). Here we provide an easy to use web—based tool (Web—
based Gene Pathogenicity Analysis or WGPA) that integrates these
methods for gene-level pathogenicity analysis (Petrovski et 61]., 2013;
Rackham et 61]., 2014; Samocha et 61]., 2014) as well as any future scor—
ing system, therefore facilitating the assessment of the evidence

supporting a role for a gene or variant in disease pathogenesis. Beyond
single—gene analyses, WGPA provides a means to assess and test patho—
genicity (using gene set enrichment analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005))
for groups of genes of interest, look for mutations in the so called hot—
zone using the gene level scores in conjunction with PolyPhen-2
(Adzhubei et al., 2013) or FATHMM (Shihab et al., 2013) and also to
incorporate information from known gene interaction networks all
within the same web based framework. Our platform will allow the
scientific community to critically evaluate and interpret the large sets of
mutation data from sequencing studies, aiding in the identification of
genes and networks that play a critical role in disease aetiology.

2 Methods and implementation

2.1 Measures of genic intolerance

To date, only a few methods to predict pathogenicity at the gene
level using sequence or population information alone are available:
Residual variance intolerance score (RVIS) (Petrovski et al., 2013),
Evolutionary intolerance score (EvoTol) (Rackham et al., 2014) and
gene constraint scores (GCS) (Samocha et al., 2014). The combin—
ation of these techniques with other analysis tools can provide a
means to assess pathogenicity for sets of genes that have been found
to be mutated in a disease, such as those identified by whole—exome
and whole—genome sequencing. Here we provide a web—based tool
that integrates in a single framework of analysis the following genic
intolerance measures:

° RVIS identiﬁes an intolerant gene as a gene containing a higher
number of rare mutations than would be expected compared to
other genes with a similar number of mutations.

° EvoTol identiﬁes an intolerant gene as a gene containing an ex—
cess of mutations that, on the protein space, are not favoured by
evolution as compared with other genes with the same number
of mutations.

° GCS identiﬁes excessively constrained genes using a statistical
model which allow to rank genes based on their relative deﬁ—
ciency of functional variation.

2.2 Gene set enrichment analysis of gene pathogenicity

The methods described above provide gene—level scores for the identi—
fication of variants and genes that have a critical role in disease; these
scores can be used to create ranked gene lists where individual highly
intolerant (or constrained) genes can be prioritized. In order to inte—
grate these scores over sets of genes, we provide a gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) implementation (Subramanian et al., 2005) that can
be used with RVIS, EvoTol or GCS. Briefly, given a ranked list of
genes (calculated genome—wide for each method described above) the
GSEA tool tests if the genic intolerance scores of a subset of genes
(provided by the user) occupy higher (or lower) positions in the
ranked gene list than what it would be expected by chance. Gene set
enrichment scores and significance level of the enrichment (P—value,
False Discovery Rate (FDR), FWER P—value) are provided, using the
GSEA output format developed by Broad Institute of MIT and
Harvard (Subramanian et al., 2005).

2.3 lnteractome data

Genes that are mutated in disease do not operate in isolation, but as
part of highly complex cellular and regulatory systems. A number of
sources of gene interaction data are available, and here we use the
STRING database (von Mering et al., 2003), which provides several
types of gene—gene interaction data. In order to remove less reliable

interactions, we have filtered the STRING network to include only
those interactions that have a STRING confidence score greater
than 500 and are experimentally supported (Rackham et al., 2014).
The interaction data is used to display the pathogenicity scores for a
set of genes on a network which, for instance, can be used to inden—
tify genes that are both intolerant to mutation and network hubs.

2.4 Tools for annotating individual SNPs

In the development of RVIS the authors also defined the ‘hot—zone’
of mutation. This is a set of mutations that are both predicted to be
damaging and also lie within genes that are predicted to be intolerant to
mutation. In order to generalize this concept we have integrated both
PolyPhen—2 and FATHMM, allowing for the hot—zone to be created as
a combination these with of any of the three measures of intolerance.

2.5 Web interface

In order to facilitate the annotation of personal genomes data with re—
spect to disease pathogenesis, we have developed a unified web—based
tool for pathogenicity analysis of individual genes, gene sets and gene
interacting networks. To this aim, we developed an intuitive graphical
user interface that will make the available prioritization methods
(RVIS, EvoTol, GCS) and integrated analysis tools (GSEA, cell—type
specificity, gene interacting networks) easy to access and use by the
general scientific community. The type of input data, integrative ana—
lyses components and outputs are schematically summarized in Figure
1, and include the following inputs, analyses and outputs:

° Inputs — Gene-Level: manual data entry; gene list ("' .txt); GRP,
gene set ("' .grp); GMX, gene matrix ("' .gmx); GMT, gene matrix
transposed ("' .gmt); WGCNA, weighted gene co—expression net—
work analysis output ("' .wgcna); Variant-Level: manual data
entry; list of protein substitutions ("' .txt); list dbSNP identiﬁers
("' .txt); Network-Level: manual data entry; list of gene identiﬁers
for STRING ("' .txt); list of gene pairs ("' .txt)

° Analyses — RVIS, EvoTol (can be stratiﬁed by gene expression),
GCS (user—selected); RVIS, EvoTol, GCS combined with variant—
level consequence predictions (PolyPhen2 (Adzhubei et al., 2013))
or FATHMM (Shihab et al., 2013)); gene set enrichment analysis
(for Gene-Level inputs)

' Outputs — genes ranked by their genic intolerance or constraint
scores (graphical and table formats); GSEA results for gene sets

loot-zone, i.e. predicted both highly—intolerant and ‘functionally
damaging’) (graphical and table formats); gene interaction net—

3 Example

An example of where WGPA will be useful is to prioritize the set
of genes with de novo mutations from trio sequencing projects. For in—
stance in the Epi4K project Allen et al. (2013), trio sequencing was
performed on epilepsy patients resulting in the identification of 329
de novo mutations impacting 176 different genes. By cross matching
the RVIS, GCS and EvoTol scores and focusing on the genes from the
top 25 percentile, we identify a set of 17 genes of interest (ATP2B4,
CHD4, DNMI, FLNA, FLNC, GABRAI, GABRB3, GNAOI,
GRINI, KCNQZ, MLL, MLL4, MYH6, SCNIA, SCNZA, SCN8A,
WHSCILI, Supplementary Table S1). Using WGPA it was also pos—
sible to perform a GSEA of each of the measures of intolerance using
the Epi4K mutated genes as the gene set of interest, and show
that in each case the Epi4K mutated gene set is significantly enriched
for predicted pathogenic genes (Supplementary Figure S1).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identification of flexible regions of protein structures is
important for understanding of their biological functions. Recently,
we have developed a fast approach for predicting protein structure
fluctuations from a single protein model: the CABS-flex. CABS-flex
was shown to be an efficient alternative to conventional all-atom mo-
lecular dynamics (MD). In this work, we evaluate CABS-flex and MD
predictions by comparison with protein structural variations within
NMR ensembles.

Results: Based on a benchmark set of 140 proteins, we show that the
relative fluctuations of protein residues obtained from CABS-flex are
well correlated to those of NMR ensembles. On average, this correl-
ation is stronger than that between MD and NMR ensembles. In con-
clusion, CABS-flex is useful and complementary to MD in predicting
protein regions that undergo conformational changes as well as the
extent of such changes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Proteins exist in solution as ensembles of structurally different
conformational states. These ensembles can exhibit different de-
grees of structural diversity, ranging from ahnost static to highly
mobile protein regions. Structural ﬂexibility is one of the key
characteristics of proteins and allows them to play important
functional roles in living organisms. Thus, knowledge of con-
formational states in native-state ensembles can provide import-
ant insights into protein functions (e.g. molecular recognition,
protein allostery) (Fenwick et al., 2011; Gerek et al., 2013;
Hilser, 2010; Wrabl et al., 2011) as well as protein evolution
(Gerek et al., 2013; Wrabl et al., 2011).

Most of the known protein structures have been solved by
X-ray crystallography and deposited in the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) as a single model. A single crystal structure,
however, gives little information about conformational
heterogeneity or model accuracy, and this is why the crystal-
lographic community has been urged to deposit an ensemble of
solutions whenever possible (Furnham et al., 2006). An ensemble

view of protein structures comes predominantly from NMR
spectroscopy, which is the method of choice for the determin-
ation of protein structure and dynamics in solution (Markwick
et al., 2008). NMR spectroscopy routinely provides an ensemble of
protein models, which usually consists of 20 conformers on average.
The precision and accuracy of NMR ensembles have been a subject
of a long-standing dispute in the ﬁeld (Spronk et al., 2003). The
structure diversity of NMR-derived ensembles may depend not
only on the quality and amount of collected data but also on the
computational procedures used for generating and selecting low-
energy models that fit experimental data. Nevertheless, it has been
demonstrated that NMR ensembles may provide valuable insights
into protein ﬂexibility that is of practical use in structure-to—function
studies (Bolstad and Anderson, 2008; Dam and Carlson, 2007;
Isvoran et al., 2011; Knegtel et al., 1997). Among these studies,
particularly interesting is probably the first comparison of NMR
ensembles and a collection of crystal structures from the point of
using them in structure-based drug design, performed by Dam
and Carlson (2007). They demonstrated that for human immunodefi-
ciency virus-l protease (HIV-1p), there is more structural
variation between 28 structures in an NMR ensemble than between
90 crystal structures bound to a variety of ligands. Because the NMR
ensemble-derived model provided the most general, yet accurate,
representation of the active site of HIv-lp, the authors strongly
encourage the use of NMR models in structure-based drug design.
Except for experimental sources, the present views on protein
ﬂexibility have been largely obtained, thanks to the use of molecular
dynamics (MD). In the past decades, MD has become an indispens-
able tool for determining conformationally heterogeneous states of
proteins, most often through unbiased simulations starting from
experimental static structures or in combination with experimental
data (Fisette et al., 2012; Vendruscolo, 2007). The idea that unbiased
MD simulations capture the true dynamic nature of proteins was
supported by a study showing that various MD force-ﬁelds provide
a consensus picture of protein ﬂuctuations in solution (Rueda et al.,
2007). Using the MD simulation data from this study, we recently
demonstrated that the structural and dynamics characteristics of
MD trajectories are fairly consistent with simulation results from
a coarse-grained protein model—the CABS model (J amroz et al.,
2013b). Importantly, the computational cost of obtaining near-
native dynamics by CABS simulations was proved to be much
lower (~6 x 103 times) than that of MD [technically, this is the
cost of achieving a residue ﬂuctuation profile that best ﬁts that
obtained from 10 ns MD simulations, see details in Jamroz et al.
(2013b)]. Following this work, we implemented the developed
CABS-model—based protocol for fast simulations of near-native
dynamics in a web server called CABS-ﬂex (Jamroz et al., 2013a).

CABS-flex predictions of protein flexibility

 

In previous works, we compared CAB S-ﬂex predictions of pro-
tein ﬂexibility with a large set of MD simulation data (Jamroz
et al., 2013a, b). The comparison tests showed that the CABS-
ﬂex method is a computationally efﬁcient alternative to MD. The
present work describes a comparison of protein ﬂuctuations
obtained from CABS-ﬂex and MD simulations with ﬂuctuations
derived from NMR ensembles.

2 METHODS
2.1 Benchmark set

We used a protein benchmark set constructed and reported by Jamroz
et a]. (2012). The benchmark set contains 140 non-redundant proteins
determined by NMR (with NMR ensembles consisting of >10 models in
their PDB ﬁles) and MD simulation trajectories deposited in the MODEL
database (Meyer 61 al., 2010). The protein set is non-redundant in the
sense that it contains no two proteins that have sequence identity higher
than a 35% cutoff according to the PISCES database (Wang and
Dunbrack, 2003).

2.2 CABS-ﬂex method

The CABS-ﬂex method follows our earlier work (Jamroz et al., 2013b)
where we demonstrated that the consensus view of protein near-native
dynamics obtained from 10 ns MD simulations (all-atom, explicit water,
using the four most popular force-ﬁelds for all protein metafolds) is
consistent with dynamics from the CABS model. The CABS-ﬂex
simulation length has been optimized to obtain the best possible
convergence with the 10 ns MD simulations [see details in Jamroz
et al. (2013b)].

CABS is a well-established coarse-grained protein modeling tool for
predicting protein dynamics (Kmiecik and Kolinski, 2007, 2011; Kmiecik
et al., 2012) and protein structure (Blaszczyk et al., 2013; Kmiecik et al.,
2007; Kolinski and Bujnicki, 2005). The CABS design is a compromise
between high sampling efﬁciency and high resolution of protein repre-
sentation. The CABS protein representation is reduced to up to four
pseudo-atoms per residue, the force ﬁeld uses knowledge-based potentials
(accounting for solvent effects in an implicit fashion), and the sampling is
realized by the Monte Carlo method [details are given in Kolinski (2004)].
The resolution of CABS-generated models allows the reconstruction of
physically sound atomistic models (Kmiecik et al., 2007, 2012; Wabik
et al., 2013).

The CABS-based procedure for the simulation of near-native dy-
namics has been made available as a CABS-ﬂex web server (J amroz
et al., 2013a). The CABS-ﬂex server requires input of a single protein
structure and outputs a residue ﬂuctuation proﬁle together with accom-
panying analysis. Additionally, the CABS-ﬂex pipeline incorporates mul-
tiscale reconstruction and optimization procedures (Gront et al., 2012;
Kmiecik et al., 2011), which output an ensemble of protein models (in all-
atom resolution) reﬂecting the ﬂexibility of the input structure.

2.3 Computing residue ﬂuctuation proﬁles

Based on the generated trajectory (CABS-ﬂex or MD) or NMR ensem-
ble, superimposed with THESEUS (Theobald and Wuttke, 2006), a residue-
ﬂuctuation proﬁle (root mean square ﬂuctuation, RMSF), is calculated as

follows:
RMSF = limo) — (x-))2
N  l l

where <> denotes the average over the whole NMR ensemble or trajec-
tory, and x is the position of residue (Co: atom) i in the trajectory or
NMR ensemble model j.

For the comparison of residue ﬂuctuation proﬁles obtained from
CABS-ﬂex, MD and NMR ensembles, we used Spearman’s rank correl-
ation coefﬁcient. It quantiﬁes the extent of statistical dependence between
pairs of observations (and is better suited to reﬂect data correlation in the
presence of outlier values than the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient).
Spearman’s rank correlation was also used in our earlier comparisons
of MD and CABS-ﬂex ﬂuctuation proﬁles to which we refer in this
study (Jamroz et al., 2013a, b).

Note that the statistical errors of RMSF values generated by CABS-
ﬂex are reﬂected in root mean squared deviations (RMSD) between
RMSF proﬁle data (Fig. 2B).

3 RESULTS

In this work, we used a benchmark protein set of 140 proteins
collected and reported by J amroz et al. (2012).

In Figure l, we show a comparison of ﬂexibility for four ex-
ample proteins from the benchmark set. Structural ﬂexibility is
presented in the ﬁgure as residue-ﬂuctuation proﬁles, i.e. RMSF
values for each residue (see Section 2.3), visualized in plots or
projected on protein models.

In Figure 2, we present a comparison of residue-ﬂuctuation
proﬁles for the entire benchmark set. The comparison is done
using Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient (rs) (Fig. 2A) and aver-
age root mean square deviation (RMSD) between RMSF values
of MD/NMR/CABS-ﬂex (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, the average rs
between CABS-ﬂex and NMR ensembles is slightly less scattered
than that between MD and NMR: 0.72 (:l:0.15) and 0.64
(:l:0.23), respectively (standard deviation values are given in
brackets).

The rs correlation coefﬁcient is a measure of statistical depend-
ence between compared residue-ﬂuctuation proﬁles and does not
reﬂect differences in proﬁle amplitudes. This is reﬂected in the
average RMSD between the compared proﬁles shown in
Figure 2B. As presented in the plot, the RMSD between NMR
prpﬁles and CABS-ﬂex or MD proﬁles usually does not exceed
2A. In general, the higher the structural heterogeneity in NMR
ensembles, the higher is the presented RMSD values. The largest
RMSD values correspond to proteins with highly ﬂexible
regions. For instance, the highest RMSD values (NMR to MD
as well as CABS-ﬂex to NMR) correspond to the structure of
CIDE-N Domain of CIDE-B protein (PDB ID: ld4b), which has
largely disordered regions of substantial length (residues l—3l
and 111—122). The exact rs and RMSD values for each protein
are given in Supplementary Table S1 together with accom-
panying data.

4 DISCUSSION

The proteins from the benchmark set represent different degrees
of structural variability within NMR ensembles. The degree of
variability (average displacement per residue) ranges from 0.2 to
almost 12A. For the entire benchmark set, the average displace-
ment per residue in NMR ensembles is 1.68A (the values for
each protein are given in Supplementary Table S1).

The analysis of variability of NMR ensembles versus predic-
tion quality showed a tendency that the higher the ﬂexibility

observed in an NMR ensemble, the better the correlation coef-
ﬁcient (rs) between NMR and CABS-ﬂex or MD ﬂuctuation
proﬁles. For 57% of proteins from the benchmark set, the aver-
age displacement within their NMR ensembles is >1 A. In this
subset, the average rs between NMR and simulation (CABS-ﬂex
or MD) is slightly higher (0.78 for CABS-ﬂex and 0.69 for MD)
than for proteins with less variable NMR ensembles (Table 1).
Furthermore, we examined another subset of proteins for
which CABS-ﬂex predictions were the poorest (with rs<0.5:
lk8b, lwaz, lkkg, lk5k, lcok, lsgg, lpcp, lpav, lp6q, 2rgf).
In this subset of 10 proteins, the average rs between NMR and
CABS-ﬂex ﬂuctuation proﬁles was 0.35, while that between
NMR and MD was even lower: 0.26. The subset analysis
showed that 9 of 10 proteins had NMR ensembles exhibiting
almost no or small ﬂexibility, in contrast to CABS-ﬂex or MD
predictions (the exception was lpcp, which has a small amount

For the set of 140 protein structures, a comparison between CABS-ﬂex
and NMR is presented together with that of MD and NMR. For each
protein, residue-ﬂuctuation proﬁles (root mean squared ﬂuctuations,
RMSF) are compared using (A) Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient (rs)
and (B) average RMSD (root-mean square deviation) values

displacement per residue within NMR ensembles was below
0.5A (counted for the entire or most of the chain). Such large
rigidity does not seem to be justiﬁed by the structural character-
istics of these proteins. For at least some of them, highly homolo-
gous counterparts can be found in the PDB, which show more
structural variation than the analyzed NMR ensembles.

The above observations suggest that an important source of

predictions (from CABS-ﬂex or MD) and NMR ensembles is the
underestimation of ﬂuctuations in NMR ensembles. Several stu-
dies strongly indicate that ﬂuctuations in NMR ensembles are
underestimated and do not reﬂect real structural heterogeneity
(Pfeiffer et al., 1997; Scheek et al., 1995; Spronk et al., 2003;
Torda et al., 1990). The underestimations are largely due to
shortcomings of computational procedures used to generate the
ensembles based on NMR data.

The CABS-ﬂex method provides an alternative to other efﬁ-
cient computational tools generating protein residue ﬂuctuation
proﬁles, such as sequence-based predictors of protein disordered
regions (Mészaros et al., 2014) or coarse-grained normal mode
analysis (NMA; Ma, 2005). Most disorder prediction algorithms
[such as DISOPRED, Ward et al. (2004)] perform well for stable
globular domains or highly ﬂexible disordered regions without a
strong structural preference. However, their performance does
not meet expectations for structurally ambiguous regions
(Mészaros et al., 2014). Therefore, in comparison with se-
quence-based disorder prediction algorithms, CABS-ﬂex is
better suited to detecting non-obvious dynamic behavior (e.g.
signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations within the well-deﬁned secondary struc-
tural elements that could be of biological importance). Another
class of commonly used algorithms that compute protein ﬂuctu-
ation proﬁles use NMA based on elastic network models or
other coarse-grained models [e.g. WEBnma server, Hollup
et al. (2005)]. In comparison with elastic network models,
CABS-ﬂex uses more detailed information on the protein
system and generates residue ﬂuctuation proﬁles better corre-
lated (on average) with those obtained by all-atom MD [see
our Section 4 in J amroz et al. (2013b)]. The CABS-ﬂex-generated
models (or trajectory) can also be subjected to NMA. As we
demonstrated earlier (J amroz et al., 2013b), essential movements
derived from CABS-ﬂex trajectories might not be accurate indi-
vidually, but when considered together they provide a similar
description to that obtained by all-atom MD. Readers interested
in applying the NMA may refer to a review on the usefulness and
limitations of the method (Ma, 2005).

5 CONCLUSION

Due to the dynamic nature of proteins, structure-based studies of
protein functions require accurate description of protein
ﬂexibility.

Crystallographic B-factors are perhaps the most common
measure used for the elucidation of residue ﬂuctuations, and
this is probably because the majority of known structures have
been solved by X-ray crystallography. The B-factors reﬂect pro-
tein ﬂexibility but are also inﬂuenced by crystallization condi-
tions, the reﬁnement method (used for the interpretation of
X-ray data) and, importantly, the molecular environment of
the crystal structure. The crystal environment has a signiﬁcant
effect on protein ﬂexibility: the spectrum of ﬂuctuations is con-
siderably ﬂattened in crystal as compared with that in solution
(Eastman et al., 1999). Moreover, most X-ray structures have
been determined at cryogenic temperatures. Crystal cryo-cooling
has been shown to reduce B-factors, introduce packing defects
and it may result in unrealistically unique non-functional struc-
tures (Fraser et al., 2011; Rasmussen et al., 1992). Therefore,
descriptions of protein ﬂexibility derived from X-ray models
and B-factors must be approached with caution.

NMR and all-atom MD are now the methods of choice for
investigation of protein ﬂexibility in solution. Because of the
difﬁculty of NMR studies and timescale problems in all-atom
MD, coarse-grained methods have emerged as an inexpensive
and powerful alternative. The design of coarse-grained methods
successfully applied for large timescale investigations of protein
dynamics encompasses entirely different modeling strategies
(Emperador et al., 2008; Jamroz et al., 2013b; Maisuradze
et al., 2010). An excellent review on the successes and shortcom-
ings of diverse coarse-grained representations of protein ﬂexibil-
ity is provided in (Orozco et al., 2011).

In this work, we compare CABS-ﬂex predictions of protein
ﬂuctuations with that derived from NMR ensembles and MD
simulations. The comparison shows that CABS-ﬂex produces, on
average, a more similar distribution of residue ﬂuctuations to
NMR ensembles than MD does. This is due to more efﬁcient
sampling compared with MD, which leads to additional ﬂuctu-
ations or ﬂuctuation amplitudes that better ﬁt the NMR ensem-
ble data. Moreover, the results from CABS-ﬂex and MD can
complement each other in the sense that the ﬂexibility of some
protein regions may be better retrieved by one of these methods,
while the remaining part by the other one. In summary, our
results suggest that for the accurate assessment of protein ﬂexi-
bility it is reasonable to analyze results from both CABS-ﬂex and
atomic MD simulations. Because the CABS-ﬂex method pro-
vides a signiﬁcantly cheaper means of accessing backbone dy-
namics than atomic MD, it is a promising tool for larger and/or
initial reconnaissance screening studies, for example, of the effect
of mutations on protein stability or structure-based drug design.

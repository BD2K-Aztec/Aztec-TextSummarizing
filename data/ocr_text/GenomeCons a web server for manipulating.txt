Abstract

Summary: Genome sequence alignments provide valuable information on many aspects of mo-
lecular biological processes. In this study, we developed a web server, GenomeCons, for manipu-
lating multiple genome sequence alignments and their consensus sequences for high-throughput
genome sequence analyses. This server facilitates the visual inspection of multiple genome se-
quence alignments for a set of genomic intervals at a time. This allows the user to examine how
these sites are evolutionarily conserved over time for their functional importance. The server also
reports consensus sequences for the input genomic intervals, which can be applied to downstream
analyses such as the identification of common motifs in the regions determined by ChlP-seq

 

experiments.

1 Introduction

The progress of genome sequencing projects for various species has
now made it possible to compare genome sequences over a wide
range of related species. Genome sequence alignments provided by
the UCSC Genome Browser (Karolchik et al., 2014) greatly facilitate
the identification of the regions under strong selective pressure by
measuring the conservation in related species.

Genome sequence alignments in the UCSC Genome Browser are
useful for the visual inspection of a genomic region of interest, but
they are not suitable for downloading to perform further
detailed analyses. Moreover, the browser can handle only a single
locus at a time, making it difficult to survey many loci, for
example, a set of the genomic regions identified by ChIP-seq
experiments.

To conduct a large-scale analysis of genome sequence alignments,
it is necessary to download and manipulate the data stored in the
Multiple Alignment Format (MAF) from the UCSC Genome Browser

(Karolchik et al., 2014). As expected based on the length of an entire
genome and the number of species available, the amount of data in
these genome sequence alignments is huge. Furthermore, genome se-
quences of any two species are not always collinear because of the
genome rearrangements that occur during the course of evolution.
Thus, genome alignments consist of a huge set of small alignment
blocks because of the inclusion of species with various levels of
diversity. Therefore, it is not a trivial task to retrieve a genome se-
quence alignment for a region of interest from a huge amount of MAP
files.

A possible solution to this problem is to use a set of specialized
tools for manipulating genome sequence alignments (Blankenberg
et al., 2011), which have been implemented on the Galaxy web ser-
ver (Goecks et al., 2010). Recently, another program, MafFilter,
was developed for this task (Dutheil et al., 2014). These programs
facilitate the highly ﬂexible manipulation of MAP files, but they
also require command-line and/or multi-step operations, which are

not always straightforward for researchers who are not familiar
with these tasks.

In this study, we introduce our web server, GenomeCons, a
highly user-friendly, dedicated web server for manipulating genome
sequence alignments and for the automatic generation of consensus
sequences of the corresponding genomic intervals in one step.
GenomeCons is well suited for large-scale analyses of genome se-
quence alignments, for example, the identification of evolutionarily
conserved transcription factor binding sites in the peak regions iden-
tified by ChIP-seq experiments.

2 Implementation

We used multiple genome sequence alignments provided by the
UCSC Genome Browser (Karolchik et al., 2014) in the MAF format
for the following four reference species: human, mouse, medaka and
Drosophila melanogaster. We converted the MAF blocks into a con-
secutive alignment for each chromosome of the reference species.
This concatenation approach has a clear disadvantage because it
only retains the information about the genomic coordinates of the
reference species, whereas it loses that for the aligned species, but
the concatenated file makes it possible to access the query regions in
a file very quickly via a random access function implemented during
programming. To achieve even quicker access to a file, we installed
a solid-state drive for storing the concatenated alignment files on
our server.

As inputs, GenomeCons takes either a genomic interval of inter-
est by specifying a chromosome and its coordinates or a set of
genomic intervals in BED format, which is used widely in high-
throughput genome analyses. The genomic coordinates are then con-
verted into the coordinates in the concatenated alignment using the
liftOver program (Kuhn et al., 2013) on the basis of the chain files
that we constructed for coordinate conversion between genomic
coordinates and the positions in the concatenated alignment. This
process is necessary because of the insertions and deletions in the
alignments. There are also some optional settings on the web server
for tweaking the output.

The server returns the output in three formats: (i) multiple genome
sequence alignments of the input regions; (ii) consensus sequences
where the sites with low phastCons scores (Siepel et al., 2005), which
is a metric that represents the conservation at each aligned position,
are masked with ‘N’s and (iii) consensus sequences divided by low
phastCons scores. The cut-off phastCons scores can be specified by
the users, but the default value is set to 0.2. The users can also specify
the species that will be reported in the output alignments with the
‘species selection’ option. The consensus sequence output has an ad-
vantage in downstream analyses, for example, for the identification of
common motifs in the peak regions defined by ChIP-seq experiments.
In general, de novo motif identification is a CPU-intensive task and
the computational time depends on the amount of input residues.
The use of consensus sequence, which can be thought of as the regions
under selective constraints, can dramatically reduce the number of
residues that need to be processed and enhance signal-to-noise ratio
during motif identification.

3 Usage

Next, we provide two brief examples of the multiple genome
sequence alignments retrieved by GenomeCons. One example illus-
trates the conservation of splice sites. Some introns are spliced out by
a U12-dependent spliceosome, and these introns often have AT and
AC at the 5’ and 3’ splice sites, respectively. One of these introns can
be found in the RasGRP3 gene. GenomeCons can easily be used to
show that the splice sites are conserved from humans to lizards
(Fig. 1A). Another example is a genome sequence alignment for the
region of a transcription factor binding site identified by a ChIP-seq
experiment for the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF).
The data for the ChIP-seq peaks were downloaded from a
previous study (Handstad et al., 2011). A representative case shows
clearly that the binding motif is highly conserved among verte-
brates, which contrasts with the remaining regions in the alignment
(Fig. 1B).

Genome sequence alignments are valuable resources for biomedical
applications as well as basic molecular biological studies. For example,

in genome-wide association studies, there are often cases where no
genes exist in the linkage disequilibrium (LD) block that contains stat-
istically significant markers. If there are some conserved non-coding re-
gions in the LD block, these can be candidates for disease susceptibility
(Ward and Kellis, 2012). Similarly, during exome analysis, single
nucleotide variants (SNVs) that are specifically identified in patients
may be implicated in pathogenesis even if they are in synonymous sites
because they have functions other than coding such as exonic splicing
regulators (Chamary et al., 2006). Evaluating the conservation of the
positions of synonymous SNVs in multiple genome sequence align-
ments may facilitate the inference of their functional relevance to
pathogenicity.

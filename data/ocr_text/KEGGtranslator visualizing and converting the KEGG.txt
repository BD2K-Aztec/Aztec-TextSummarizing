ABSTRACT

Summary: The KEGG PATHWAY database provides a widely used
service for metabolic and nonmetabolic pathways. It contains
manually drawn pathway maps with information about the genes,
reactions and relations contained therein. To store these pathways,
KEGG uses KGML, a proprietary XML-format. Parsers and
translators are needed to process the pathway maps for usage in
other applications and algorithms.

We have developed KEGGtranslator, an easy-to-use stand-alone
application that can visualize and convert KGML formatted XML-files
into multiple output formats. Unlike other translators, KEGGtranslator
supports a plethora of output formats, is able to augment the
information in translated documents (e.g. MIRIAM annotations)
beyond the scope of the KGML document, and amends missing
components to fragmentary reactions within the pathway to allow
simulations on those.

Availability: KEGGtranslator is freely available as a JavaTMWeb
Start application and for download at http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-
tuebingen.de/software/KEGGtranslator/. KGML files can be
downloaded from within the application.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many academic researchers, who want to use pathway—based
information, utilize the KEGG PATHWAY database (Kanehisa
and Goto, 2000). The database, established in 1995, contains
manually created maps for various pathways. These maps are
visualized on the web and can be downloaded free of charge
(for academics) as XML—ﬁles in the KEGG Markup Language
(KGML). The elements in a pathway XML—ﬁle (such as reactions
or genes) are usually identiﬁed by a KEGG identiﬁer only. Thus,
KEGG PATHWAY is strongly related to other KEGG databases that
resolve and further describe the identiﬁers. However, the content
of these KGML—formatted XML—ﬁles itself is limited. Gene names
are often encoded as barer readable abbreviations and elements
are only annotated by a single KEGG identiﬁer. By improving
the annotation and translating the KGML—ﬁles to other ﬁle formats,
researchers could use the KEGG database for many applications:
individual pathway pictures could be created; pathway simulation

and modeling applications could be executed; graph—operations on
the pathways or stoichiometric analyses could be performed (see,
e.g. Heinrich and Schuster, 2006, chapter 3); or the KEGG pathway
database could be used for gene set enrichment analyses. For these
purposes, only a few converters are available: KEGGconverter
(Moutselos et al., 2009) or KEGG2SBML (Funahashi et al., 2004)
offer command—line or web—based conversion of KGML—ﬁles to
SBML—ﬁles. KEGGgraph (Zhang and Wiemann, 2009) is able to
convert KGML—ﬁles to R—based graph structures. None of these
tools has a graphical user interface, is capable to validate and
autocomplete KEGG reactions, adds standard identiﬁers (such
as MIRIAM URNs) to pathway elements, or is able to write
KGML ﬁles in multiple ouput formats. Along with this work, the
command—line toolbox SuBliMinaL (N.Swainston et al., submitted
for publication) overcomes some of these limitations.

We here present KEGGtranslator, which reads and completes the
content of an XML—ﬁle by retrieving online—annotation of all genes
and reactions using the KEGG API. KGML—ﬁles can be converted
to many output formats. Minor deﬁciencies are corrected (e.g. the
name of a gene), new information is added (e. g. multiple MIRIAM
identiﬁers for each gene and reaction (Novere et al., 2005), or SBO
terms describing the function) and some crucial deﬁciencies (like
missing reactants) are addressed.

2 TRANSLATION OF KGML-FILES

In the ﬁrst step of a translation, KEGGtranslator reads a given XML—
ﬁle and puts all contained elements into an internal data structure. To
get further information and annotation, the KEGG database is queried
via the KEGG API for each element in the document (pathway, entries,
reactions, relations, substrates, products, etc.). This completes the sparse
XML—document with comprehensive information. For example, multiple
synonyms and identiﬁers of many external databases (Ensembl, EntrezGene,
UniProt, ChEBI, Gene Ontology, DrugBank, PDBeChem and many more)
are being assigned to genes and other elements. After this initial step,
various preprocessing operations are performed on the pathway. The user
may choose to let KEGGtranslator correct various deﬁciencies automatically:
Remove white nodes—KEGG uses colors in the visualization of a pathway
to annotate organism—speciﬁc orthologous genes. Nodes in green represent
biological entities that occur in the current organism. Nodes in white
represent biological entities, corresponding to genes that occur in this
pathway in other species, but not in the current one. Translating all those
nodes into new models, without caring for the node color, would lead to
a model, that contains invalid genes in the pathway. Remove orphans—
isolated nodes without any reactions or relations are usually unnecessary
for further simulations. Autocomplete reactions—another major deﬁciency
are incomplete reactions. The XML—ﬁles only contain those components of
a reaction, that are needed for the graphical representation of the pathway.
Reactants that are not necessary for the visualization are usually skipped

in the KGML format. Thus, the given chemical equation is sometimes
incomplete (see Fig. l). KEGGtranslator is able to lookup each reaction and
amend the missing components to reactions. This leads to more complete
and functionally correct pathway models, which is very important, e. g. for
stoichiometric simulations. After these preprocessing steps, KEGGtranslator
branches between two different conversion modes for the actual translation:
a functional translation (SBML) and a graphical translation (e. g. GraphML,
GML). Depending on the chosen output format, KEGGtranslator determines
how to continue with the conversion.

The functional translation is performed by converting the KGML
document to a JSBML data structure (Drager et al., 2011). The focus lies
on generating valid and speciﬁcation—conform SBML (Level 2 Version 4)
code that eases, e.g. a dynamic simulation of the pathway. Multiple
MIRIAM URNs and an SBO term, which describes best the function
of the element, is assigned to each entry of the pathway (pathway
references, genes, compounds, enzymes, reactions, reaction—modiﬁers, etc.).
Additionally, notes are assigned to each element with human—readable names
and synonyms, a description of the element, and links to pictures and further
information. The user may also choose to add graphical information by
putting CellDesigner annotations to the model. But the focus in functional
translation lies on the reactions in KGML documents, whereas graphical
representations concentrate on relations between pathway elements. Besides
the already mentioned completion of reactions, each enzymatic modiﬁer
is correctly assigned to the reaction and the reversibility of the reaction
is annotated. As a ﬁnal step, the SBML2IATEX (Drager et al., 2009)
tool has been integrated into KEGGtranslator, which allows users to
automatically generate a IATEX or PDF—report, to document the SBML—code
of the translated pathway. Furthermore, the user may add kinetics to the
pathway by using the SBMquueezer (Drager et al., 2008) tool after the
translation.

In graphical translations, results can be saved as GraphML, GML or
YGF and ﬁnally as images of type JPG, GIF or TGF. In this mode, the
KGML data structure is being converted to a yFiles (Wiese et al., 2001)
data structure. The focus here lies on the visualization of the pathway.
Relations are being translated by inserting arrows with the appropriate style,
which is given in the KGML document. For example, dashed arrows without
heads represent bindings or associations and a dotted arrow with a simple,
ﬁlled head illustrates an indirect effect. Please see the KGML speciﬁcation
for a complete list. As in the functional translation, GraphML allows to
deﬁne custom annotation elements. KEGGtranslator makes use of those, by
putting several identiﬁers (e.g. EntrezGene or Ensembl) and descriptions
to the single nodes. From the KGML document, the shape of the node
is translated as well as the colors and labels. Links to descriptive HTML
pages are being setup and hierarchical group nodes are being created for
deﬁned compounds. All these features lead to a graphical representation
of the pathway that provides as much information about the elements as
possible.

3 DISCUSSION

KEGGtranslator is a stand—alone application with a graphical
user interface that runs on every operating system for which
a J avaT“ virtual machine is available. There are other tools for
converting KGML to SBML and for converting KGML to graph
structures in R. But, to our knowledge, no other KEGG converter is
able to translate KGML formatted ﬁles to such a variety of output
formats with important functionalities like the autocompletion of
reactions or the annotation of each element in the translated
ﬁle, using various identiﬁers. Furthermore, KEGGtranslator is
simple, easy—to—use and comes with a powerful command—line and
graphical user interface. The variety of output formats, combined
with the translation options and comprehensive, standard—conform
annotation of the pathway elements allow a quick and easy usage

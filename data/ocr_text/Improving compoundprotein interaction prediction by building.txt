Abstract

Motivation: Computational prediction of compound—protein interactions (CPIs) is of great import—
ance for drug design and development, as genome—scale experimental validation of CPIs is not
only time—consuming but also prohibitively expensive. With the availability of an increasing num—
ber of validated interactions, the performance of computational prediction approaches is severely
impended by the lack of reliable negative CPI samples. A systematic method of screening reliable
negative sample becomes critical to improving the performance of in silico prediction methods.
Results: This article aims at building up a set of highly credible negative samples of CPIs via an in
silico screening method. As most existing computational models assume that similar compounds
are likely to interact with similar target proteins and achieve remarkable performance, it is rational
to identify potential negative samples based on the converse negative proposition that the proteins
dissimilar to every known/predicted target of a compound are not much likely to be targeted by the
compound and vice versa. We integrated various resources, including chemical structures, chem—
ical expression profiles and side effects of compounds, amino acid sequences, protein—protein
interaction network and functional annotations of proteins, into a systematic screening framework.
We first tested the screened negative samples on six classical classifiers, and all these classifiers
achieved remarkably higher performance on our negative samples than on randomly generated
negative samples for both human and Caenorhabditis elegans. We then verified the negative sam—
ples on three existing prediction models, including bipartite local model, Gaussian kernel profile
and Bayesian matrix factorization, and found that the performances of these models are also
significantly improved on the screened negative samples. Moreover, we validated the screened
negative samples on a drug bioactivity dataset. Finally, we derived two sets of new interactions by
training an support vector machine classifier on the positive interactions annotated in DrugBank
and our screened negative interactions. The screened negative samples and the predicted inter—
actions provide the research community with a useful resource for identifying new drug targets
and a helpful supplement to the current curated compound—protein databases.

1 Introduction

Compound—protein interactions (CPIs) are crucial to the discovery
of new drugs by screening candidate compounds and are also helpful
for understanding the causes of side effects of existing drugs.
Although various biological assays are available, experimental valid—
ation of CPIs remains time—consuming and expensive. Therefore,
there is a strong incentive to develop computational methods to de—
tect CPIs accurately. Meanwhile, with the rapid growth of public
chemical and biological databases, such as the PubChem (Wheeler
et al., 2006), DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2008), SIDER (Kuhn et al.,
2010), STITCH (Kuhn et al., 2014), STRING (Franceschini et al.,
2013) and Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2013), various
kinds of resources, including drug features such as chemical struc—
tures, side effects and gene expression profiles under drug treatments
and protein features such as amino acid sequences, protein—protein
interaction (PPI) networks and functional annotations, become
available to the research community and consolidate the basis of
computational CPI prediction.

Traditional computational approaches fall roughly into two
categories: structure based and ligand based. The structure—based
methods depend on the structural information of target proteins
that are often unavailable for most protein families. Ligand—based
methods get poor performance for those proteins having few or
none of the known ligands. Recently, a variety of machine learning-
based methods have been proposed and achieved a considerable suc—
cess by taking the viewpoint of chemogenomics (Jaroch and
Weinmann, 2006), which integrates the chemical attributes of drug
compounds, the genomic attributes of proteins and the known CPIs
into a unified mathematical framework. The main rationale underly-
ing the chemogenomics approaches is that similar compounds tend
to bind similar proteins, so that the lack of known ligands for a
given protein can be compensated by the availability of known
ligands of similar proteins and vice versa.

Following the philosophy of chemogenomics, many methods
have been proposed by exploiting various types of features and clas—
sification algorithms (Tabei and Yamanishi, 2013; Yabuuchi et al.,
2011; Yamanishi et al., 2010). With the chemical structure similar—
ity and protein sequence similarity measures, Bleakley and
Yamanishi (2009) proposed the bipartite local model (BLM) to infer
CPIs by training local support vector machine (SVM) classifiers
based on known interactions. van Laarhoven et al. (2011) proposed
Gaussian interaction profile (GIP) kernels that exploit the topology
of CPI networks. However, these methods still suffer from the lack
of known interactions between the drugs and proteins of interest,
which often leads to the failure of prediction. Therefore, Mei et al.
(2013) improved BLM by exploiting the known interactions of
neighbors to compensate the lack of interaction information. van
Laarhoven and Marchiori (2013) also used the interaction profiles
of weighted nearest neighbors to improve the GIP method.

Instead of utilizing the attributes of drugs and proteins separ—
ately, more and more researchers combined these attributes into a
single feature vector by the concatenation or tensor product oper—
ators and then built classifiers based on the integrated features and
known CPIs. For example, Jacob and Vert (2008) proposed SVM
classifiers with pairwise kernels that were derived, respectively, from
similarity measures of drugs and proteins. Yamanishi et al. (2008)
proposed the bipartite graph inference that maps drugs and proteins
into a unified Euclidean feature space in which the distances between
drugs and proteins linked by known interactions are minimized and
otherwise maximized. The network-based inference originally pro-
posed for personal recommendation (Zhou et al., 2010) was also

used to identify CPIs (Alaimo et al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2012). Other
methods including kernel—based data fusion (Wang et al., 2011),
Kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization with twin kernels
(KBMF2K) (Gonen, 2012), restricted Boltzmann machine (Wang
and Zeng, 2013) and semi—supervised methods (Chen and Zhang,
2013; Xia et al., 2010) were successively proposed. In addition to
chemical structures and protein sequences, researchers also resorted
to other attributes of drugs and proteins to reveal their interacting as—
sociations, including the drug expression profiles (Carrella et al.,
2014; Iorio et al., 2010; Wolpaw et al., 2011), functional groups
(He et al., 2010) and side effects (Campillos et al., 2008; Mizutani
et al., 2012) of drugs, signaling pathways and GO annotations
(Jaeger et al., 2014) of proteins or even the combination of these
attributes (Gottlieb et al., 2011, 2012; Perlman et al., 2011).

Most previous approaches used experimentally validated CPIs as
positive samples and randomly generated negative samples to learn
the prediction models. However, the randomly generated negative
samples may include real positive samples not yet known. A classi—
fier trained by using such randomly generated negative samples may
yield high cross—validation accuracy but very possibly has poor
performance on independent, real test datasets. Screening highly re—
liable negative samples is therefore critical to improving the accur—
acy of computational prediction methods. The importance of true—
negative interactions was recently highlighted as one of the future
developments in predicting drug—target interactions (Ding et al.,
2014). Motivated by this, we set about to screen in silico highly
credible negative samples of CPIs. An assumption underlying most
computational methods for predicting CPIs is that similar drug com-
pounds are likely to interact with similar target proteins. Our
method is based on the converse negative proposition, i.e. the pro—
teins that are dissimilar to every known/predicted target of a given
compound are not much likely to be targeted by the compound and
vice versa. We integrated various resources of compounds and pro—
teins, including chemical structures, chemical expression profiles
and side effects of compounds, amino acid sequences, PPI networks
and GO functional annotations of proteins, to a systematic screen—
ing framework. We evaluated our method on both human and
Caenorloabditis elegans data. We first tested our screened negative
samples on six classical classifiers, including random forest, L1- and
L2-regularized logistic regression, naive Bayes, SVM and le—nearest
neighbor (kNN). All these classifiers achieved remarkably higher
performance on our negative samples than on randomly generated
negative samples. We also verified our negative samples on three
existing prediction models, including BLM (Bleakley and
Yamanishi, 2009), Gaussian kernel profile (van Laarhoven et al.,
2011) and Bayesian matrix factorization (Gonen, 2012), and found
that the performances of these models are also significantly im-
proved on the screened negative samples. Furthermore, we validated
our screened negative samples with a drug bioactivity dataset.

Finally, we derived two sets of new CPIs by training an SVM
classifier on the positive interactions annotated in DrugBank and
our screened negative interactions. These screened negative samples
and the predicted interactions can serve the research community as a
useful resource for identifying new drug targets and as a helpful sup—
plement to the current curated compound—protein databases.

2 Materials

2.1 Compound—protein interaction
CPIs were retrieved from DrugBank 4.1 (Wishart et al., 2008),
Matador (Gnther et al., 2008) and STITCH 4.0 (Kuhn et al., 2014).

DrugBank and Matador are manually curated databases, and
STITCH is a comprehensive database that collects CPIs from four
different sources: experiments, databases, text mining and predicted
interactions. Meanwhile, STITCH provides a score ranging from
0 to 1000 for each interaction, which indicates the confidence of the
CPI supported by four types of evidence, i.e. experimental valid—
ation, manually curated databases, text mining and predicted inter—
actions. We assigned the interactions from DrugBank and Matador
the highest score 1000 because these interactions are supported by
biochemical experiments and the literature. Totally, we got
2290 630 interactions between 367 142 unique compounds and
19 342 proteins of human, and 2 141 740 interactions between
276 294 unique compounds and 11 234 proteins of C.elegans. For
simplicity, we refer to the created assembly of CPIs as K and denote
by a triple (61,19), uni) E K the interaction between drug 6,- and pro—
tein p,- with confidence score w,,- in the rest of the article.

2.2 Chemical data

2.2.1 Chemical structure similarity

Chemical structures (also referred to as ﬁngerprints) of drugs were
obtained from the PubChem database (Wheeler et al., 2006). We
calculated the Jaccard score (Jaccard, 1908) of the fingerprints as
the chemical structure similarity between compounds. The Jaccard
score between compounds 6 and c’ is defined as |cﬂc’|/|cUc’|,
which is the ratio of the number of common substructures between
c and c’ over the total number of substructures in c and c’ . There are
totally 881 kinds of substructures used in our analysis for human
and C.elegans. Applying this operation to all drug pairs, we thus
constructed a chemical similarity matrix.

2.2.2 Side effect similarity

Side effects of drugs were downloaded from the SIDER database
(Kuhn et al., 2010). For the drugs involving in CPIs but not included
in the SIDER database, we employed a recently proposed method
that predicts side effects based on chemical fragments (Pauwels
et al., 2011) to predict side effects. Similarly, we computed the
Jaccard score of each pair of drugs as side effect similarity based on
either their known side effects or top 10 predicted side effects in case
they are unknown (Perlman et al., 2011).

2.3 Protein data

2.3.1 Sequence similarity

Amino acid sequences of proteins were obtained from the UCSC
Table Browser. We computed sequence similarity between proteins
using a normalized version of Smith—Waterman score (Smith and
Waterman, 2010). The normalized Smith—Waterman score between
two proteins g and g’ is sw(g,g’)/(/sw(g,g)(/sw(g’,g’) where
sw(.,  means the original Smith—Waterman score. Applying this
operation to all protein pairs, we got the similarity matrix of protein
sequences.

2.3.2 Functional annotation semantic similarity

GO annotations were downloaded from the GO database
(Ashburner et al., 2013). Semantic similarity score between each
pair of proteins was calculated based on the overlap of the GO terms
that were associated with the two proteins (Coutoa et al., 2007). All
three types of ontologies were used in the computation as similar
drugs are expected to interact with proteins that act in similar biolo-
gical processes or have similar molecular functions or reside in simi-
lar compartments. We computed the Jaccard score with respect to
the GO terms of each pair of proteins as their similarity.

2.3.3 Protein domain similarity

Protein domains were extracted from PFAM database (Punta et al.,
2012). Each protein was represented by a domain fingerprint
(binary vector) whose elements encode the presence or absence of
each retained PFAM domain by 1 or 0, respectively. The numbers of
PFAM domains for human and C.elegans are 1331 and 3837,
respectively. We computed the Jaccard score of any two proteins via
their domain fingerprints as their similarity.

3 Methods

3.1 Integration of multiple similarities

We have computed multiple similarity measures from different
features for both drugs and proteins as mentioned above. For drugs
6,- and c], we formulate them into a single comprehensive similarity
measure as below:

CS,-,- 2 1 — Ha — cs?) (1)

n

in which c551) (n: 1, 2) represents the similarity measure derived
from features of chemical structure and side effect, respectively.
Note that similar formulation was also adopted by STITCH (Kuhn
et al., 2014), as it can be easily extended to integrate more similarity
measures. Similarly, we computed the comprehensive similarity be—
tween proteins p, and p,- by

Ps.-,- = 1 — H<1 — psi”), (2)

n

where p5,?) (n: 1, 2, 3) represents the similarity measure derived
from sequence similarity, functional annotation semantic similarity
and protein domain similarity, respectively.

3.2 The screening framework

Most existing prediction methods for CPIs (positive samples) are
based on the assumption that similar compounds are likely to inter-
act with the proteins that are similar to the corresponding known
target proteins. Our basic idea was inspired by the converse negative
proposition of this assumption. Specifically, we assume that a pro—
tein dissimilar to every known/predicted target of a compound is not
much likely to be targeted by this compound, and on the other
hand, a compound not similar to any known/predicted compound
targeting a protein is not much likely to target this protein. For sim-
plicity, we refer them as protein dissimilarity rule and drug dissimi-
larity rule, respectively. Both rules are simultaneously applied in our
screening framework so as to identify the most reliable negative
samples of CPIs. Different from existing prediction methods that
often depend on known CPIs for making reliable predictions, our
negative sample screening framework exploits both validated and
predicted CPIs. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of our method. Here,
the three green dashed—line boxes show the data resources used in
our screening framework, and the protein dissimilarities and drug
dissimilarities are, respectively, computed so as to gain a combined
score for each candidate negative sample. We summarize the screen—
ing steps as follows:

1. Compute the integrated similarity of each pair of compounds/
proteins via Equation (1)/Equati0n (2). Build the assembly K of
known/predicted CPIs as mentioned above.

2. Build the set of candidate negative interactions from all possible
interactions excluding the created assembly K of known/
predicted CPIs. We take the candidate negative interaction

Fig. 1. The flowchart of our negative CPI screening framework. Three green dashed-line boxes show the data resources used in our screening process, and the
red dashed-line boxes represent the screening steps that include multiple operations

between compound la and protein 1', denoted by (ck, pi, de) with

dkl- indicating the distance between compound la and protein 1', as

an example to demonstrate the screening process. Figure 2 is to
illustrate the process of calculating dkj.

a. For any protein [)1 targeted by ck in K, we compute the
weighted score spcI-kl : wk] >1< PSI-I that indicates the possibility
of protein [9,- being targeted by compound ck in consideration
of the similarity between [9,- and 1);. Taking into account the
similarity between [9,- and each known/predicted protein [)1 tar—
geted by compound ck, i.e. (ck,pl,wk1) E K, we calculate the
combined score by summing up the weighted scores spcjkl
with respect to l, and thus obtain SPCI-k : Elspcl-kl.

b. Similarly, we compute the weighted score scka-I- : wII- >|< CSIk
that represents the possibility of compound ck targeting
p,- in consideration of the similarity between ck and c,-.
Considering the similarity between ck and each known/
predicted compound 6,- targeting protein 1),, i.e.
(6), pi, MI) E K, we calculate the combined score by summing
up the weighted scores spckj, with respect to i and thus ob—
tain SCPkI- : Ziscpkii.

c. For compound ck and protein 1),, we deﬁne the distance be—
tween ck and p,- as below:

dki : e—(SPCIHSCPM) I (3)

dkl- is the ﬁnal score representing the possibility that com—
pound ck does not target protein pi. The larger dkj is, the
higher the possibility of ck not targeting p,- is.

3. Build the set of positive interactions from two manually curated
databases: DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2008) and Matador
(Gnther et al., 2008).

4. Rank the potential negative CPIs according to the scores ob—
tained by Equation (3), and those with the highest scores are
taken to form the set of negative sample candidates.

5. The negative sample candidates are further ﬁltered by using fea—
ture divergence of compound and protein, as described in
Section 3.3.

6. Combining the positive interactions and negative interactions,
we get a gold standard set of CPIs. On the basis of the chemical

substructures and protein PFAM domains, we construct the ten—

by a vector in the chemogenomical space.

7. Train a classiﬁer (e.g. SVM) by using the chemogenomical fea—
ture vectors, tune the model parameters via cross—validation and
ﬁnally predict new CPIs.

Conceptually, the confidence values of the known/predicted inter—
actions wkl and w,-,- are propagated to the candidate negative inter—
actions via similar proteins and compounds in Step 2(a) and Step
2(b). The protein similarity linking compound ck to protein j via
protein [)1 is formulated by spckﬂ in Step 2(a), and chemical similar-
ity linking protein p,- to compound ck via compound 6,- is formulated
by scpkj, in Step 2(b). In Step 2(c), the two resulting scores are com—
bined according to Equation (3), which embodies the protein dis—
similarity rule and the drug dissimilarity rules through a negative
exponent function. In particular, the known/predicted interactions
function as a bridge to link compounds and proteins that do not
form potential interactions of high probability.

3.3 Filtering by feature divergence
It is known that compounds with similar chemical features may
have greatly different binding bioactivity (activity cliff) (Sun and
Bajorath, 2012). On the other hand, compounds with completely
different core structures could potentially target similar proteins
(scaffold hopping) (Sun et al., 2012). When the number of validated/
predicted target proteins of a specific compound is small and thus
covers limited proteomic features, it is likely that some proteins
screened via proteomic feature dissimilarity based on all known
target proteins are actually the targets of the compound. From the
perspective of protein, similar situation maybe exists, when the
number of validated/predicted compounds targeting a protein is
small. Thus, we require that the number of validated/predicted inter—
actions participated by the protein and the compound of each nega—
tive sample candidate should be larger than some predefined
threshold. By setting the threshold to 15, we got 23 392 compounds
and 10757 proteins of human, 33 353 compounds and 7584
proteins of C.elegans, which were used to construct the negative
samples.

Moreover, we expect that the features of the proteins targeted by
a specific compound differ from each other as largely as possible, so
that our dissimilarity rules can exclude more specious candidates
that have similar features to known target proteins. Similarly, the
more different the chemical features of the compounds targeting a
specific protein are, the more false—positive targeting compounds
could be excluded by our dissimilarity rules. In other words, the
credibility of the screened negative samples is positively correlated
to the feature divergence of the proteins (compounds) in validated/
predicted interactions associated to a specific compound (protein).
Therefore, we exploited the feature divergence to further screen the
candidate negative samples. Since variance is a commonly used
measure for evaluating data divergence, we carried out statistical
test to check whether the similarity variance of the subset of proteins
(compounds) in interactions associated to each compound (protein)
in the candidate negative samples is significantly larger than the
population variance. Take compounds as example, the similarity
variance of the compound population is 0.0335, which can be easily
computed based on C5,,- (see Equation 1). For a subset of n com—
pounds interacting with a protein, the null hypothesis is that the
sample variance is less than the compound population variance, and
the alternate hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis,
then the sample variance follows 12 distribution with degree of free—
dom n — 1. With a significance level 0.05, we filtered out more spe—
cious candidates and finally obtained 384916 negative samples
between 14 613 unique compounds and 2229 unique proteins of
human by setting the threshold of dkl- to 0.9 (% e‘0‘1). For C.elegans,
we finally got 88 261 negative samples between 2224 unique
proteins and 5278 unique compounds by setting the threshold of elk,-
to 0.368.

4 Results

4.1 Performance evaluation protocol

To conduct an objective and fair evaluation on the negative CPIs
screened by our method, we first built the positive samples from the
manually curated databases DrugBank and Matador and then gener—
ated two sets of negative samples: one was generated by randomly
sampling compound—protein pairs not included in the positive sam—
ples, the other was extracted from the list of negative samples
screened by our method. We evaluated the screened negative sam—
ples by comparing the performances of both six classical classifiers

and three existing predictive methods on the same set of positive
samples combining with screened and randomly generated negative
samples, respectively. We selected the top 384 916 screened negative
samples (the dataset is available in the Supplementary Material)
from the ranking list as candidates and used some of them in the
experiments.

As shown in Supplementary Figure 81, the frequency distribution
of interactions is biased to only a small portion of compounds/
proteins, indicating that random sampling over the whole inter—
actions might cover only a limited number of compounds and pro—
teins. Therefore, as in Tabei and Yamanishi (2013) and Yamanishi
et al. (2014), we used two protocols: pairwise cross—validation and
blockwise cross—validation, to evaluate our negative samples against
randomly generated negative samples. Concretely, pairwise cross—
validation assumes that the aim is to detect missing interactions
between known ligand compounds and known target proteins with
information of interaction partners, while blockwise cross—
validation assumes that the goal is to detect new interactions for
new ligand compounds and target proteins with no information of
interaction partners. Pairwise cross—validation was performed in 3
steps: (i) the CPIs in the gold standard set are randomly split into
five subsets of roughly equal size; (ii) each subset is taken in turn as
a test set and the remaining four subsets are used to train a predict—
ive model, whose prediction accuracy on the test set is then eval—
uated and (iii) the average prediction accuracy over the 5—folds is
used as the final performance measure. Instead of splitting inter-
actions, blockwise cross—validation randomly splits the compounds
and proteins in the gold standard set into five subsets, respectively.
Each compound subset and each protein subset are taken in turn
and combined as a test set, and then a predictive model is trained on
the compound—target pairs included in the remaining four com-
pound subsets and four protein subsets and is further evaluated on
the test set. Finally, the average prediction accuracy over the 5 —folds
is calculated.

Several performance measures are used in the following experi-
ments. Denote by TP and FP the numbers of correctly and falsely
predicted positive CPIs, TN and FN the numbers of correctly
and falsely predicted negative CPIs, the measures are precision
[or positive predictive values (PPV)] :TP/(TP—I—FP), recall (or
sensitivity):TP/(TP—I—FN), specificity=TN/(FP—I—TN) and AUC
(area under the ROC curve). Especially, the PPV measure reﬂects
the discriminatory power of a classifier to distinguish true positives
when the number of negative samples is far larger than that of posi—
tive samples. In addition, we report the precision—recall curve be—
cause it is rather informative when the number of positive examples
is small.

4.2 Evaluation on classical classifiers

4.2.1 Pairwise cross-validation

The human dataset that we used includes 3369 positive interactions
between 1052 unique compounds and 852 unique proteins, and the
C.elegans dataset includes 4000 positive interactions between 1434
unique compounds and 2504 unique proteins (the datasets are avail—
able in the Supplementary Material). Similar to Tabei and
Yamanishi (2013), we evaluated the performance of each classifier

dates in the ranking list produced by our method. We produced the

chemogenomical features of the positive and negative samples by
performing tensor product of chemical substructures and protein
domains.

We conducted performance evaluation on six classical classifiers
by comparing our screened negative samples against randomly gen—
erated negative samples. The six classical classifiers are naive Bayes,
random forest, L1—logistic regression, L2—logistic regression, SVM
and kNN. The naive Bayes, random forest and kNN were run by
using Weka 3.7 (Hall et al., 2009), L1— and L2—logistic regression
were run by liblinear 1.94 (Fan et al., 2008) and SVM was run by
libsvm 3.17 (Chang and Lin, 2011). All these methods were run on
default setting except for kNN where la is set to 1, 3 and 5, respect—
ively. As similar results were obtained for different la values, we re—
ported only the results of la : 1. Table 1 shows the AUC, recall and
precision measures of the six classifiers on human data. We found
that the performances of all six classifiers were significantly
improved on our screened negative samples in comparison to on
randomly generated negative samples. For example, for the six clas—
sifiers from naive Bayes to SVM, the average AUC improvement
achieved on our screened negatives over the randomly generated
negatives is 8.0%, 53.4%, 39.7%, 4.2%, 5.3% and 29.6%, respect—
ively. When the ratio of negative samples increases, the AUC values
of most classifiers keep steady or increase slightly. However, we also
noticed that the recall and precision measures of most classifiers de—
crease with the increase of the ratio of negative samples, this is
mainly due to the increasingly imbalanced ratio of the negative sam—
ples to the positive samples, which leads to the increasing bias of the
classification decision boundary against the positive ones. In add—
ition, we obtained similar results on C.elegans, as shown in
Supplementary Table 81. These empirical results demonstrate the
high reliability of our screened negative samples.

4.2.2 Blockwise cross-validation

Here the positive samples are the same as those used in pairwise
cross—validation. An equal number of random negative samples to
positive samples were selected by the random sampling procedure
mentioned above. Also, an equal number of screened negative sam—
ples were randomly extracted from the top 384916 candidates in
our ranking list. The six classical classifiers were run in the same
way as mentioned above, and the precision—recall curves and AUC
histograms are shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S2.
Compared with pairwise validation, the six classifiers perform
worse in blockwise cross—validation on both screened and randomly
generated negative samples, but their performances are still substan—
tially improved on the screened negative samples. In particular, on

randomly generated negative samples, the performance of each clas—
sifier deteriorates dramatically under blockwise cross—validation,
but most classifiers except for naive Bayes and kNN still achieved
relatively high AUC values on the screened negative samples:
L1- and L2-logistic regression and SVM achieved AUC values larger
than 0.8. As also shown in Supplementary Figure S3, all the six clas—
sifiers obtain larger AUC values on screened negative samples than
on random negative samples of C.elegans, whereas the overall per—
formances of these classifiers decrease slightly in comparison to that
on human dataset.

4.3 Evaluation on existing predictive methods

We further checked whether existing predictive methods can achieve
higher performance on screened negative samples than on randomly
generated negative samples. The evaluated existing methods include
BLM (Bleakley and Yamanishi, 2009), RLS-avg and RLS-Kron
classifiers with GIP kernels (van Laarhoven et al., 2011), KBMF2K-
classification and KBMF2K—regression (Gonen, 2012). RLS—avg and
RLS-Kron were run by setting two different groups of parameters,
(0.5, 0.5) and (1,1), respectively, and the others were run by default
settings. All these methods were originally evaluated on four widely
used human datasets involving Enzyme, Ion Channel, GPCR and
Nuclear Receptor proposed in Yamanishi et al. (2008). But these
four datasets are small scale and cover only a small number of nega-
tive samples screened by our method, so we built another relatively
larger dataset of human to evaluate these methods. We got the posi—
tive samples from DrugBank and then extracted the negative

Fig. 4. Histogram of the AUC values achieved by three existing predictive
methods on screened and randomly generated negative samples of human

samples whose compounds and proteins are both involved in the
positive samples from our ranking list. The resulting human dataset
includes 2315 positive interactions and 2576 negative interactions
between 821 unique compounds and 846 unique proteins, and the
C.elegans dataset includes 463 positive interactions and 1561 nega—
tive samples between 543 compounds and 504 proteins (the datasets
are available in the Supplementary Material). As these compared
methods take as input the chemical structure similarity matrix, pro-
tein sequence similarity matrix and CPI matrix, we built the similar-
ity matrices and the interaction matrix as mentioned in Section 2.
The AUC values achieved by these predictive methods on
screened and randomly generated negative samples of human are
shown in Figure 4. Clearly, all the methods achieved significantly
higher performance on the screened negative samples than on the
randomly generated negative samples. In particular, BLM had the
least AUC (0.679) on the randomly generated negative samples but
achieved a comparable AUC (0.932) to other methods on the
screened negative samples. KBMF2K—classification and KBMF2K-
regression had considerably high AUCs (0.868 and 0.846) on the
randomly generated negative samples, but their performances were
also significantly improved on the screened negative samples. On
C.elegans, the performance improvement is more notable than on
human for all methods except for KBMF2K—classification and
KBMF2K-regression, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4.
Although BLM and the four RLS algorithms performed only moder—
ately on the randomly generated negative samples, their perform-
ances were substantially boosted on the screened negative samples.
This result shows again that our screened negative samples are help—
ful for improving the performances of existing predictive methods.

4.4 Evaluation on drug bioactivity dataset
The quantitative drug—target bioactivity assays for kinase inhibitors
provide experimental observations of the bindings of drug molecules
to targets, which enable us to derive both positive and negative
interactions. As suggested by Pahikkala et al. (2015), recent kinase
bioactivity assay data from Davis et al. (2011) can be used as an in—
dependent benchmark test set for performance evaluation of drug—
target prediction methods. This assay reported the quantitative
interaction affinity as the dissociation constant (Kd), which reﬂects
how tightly a drug molecular binds to a target protein. The smaller
Kd is, the higher the interaction affinity between the chemical com—
pound and the target protein is.

The bioactivity assay included the interactions between 68
unique drugs and 442 unique proteins, from which 20 931

on screened and randomly generated negative samples, evaluated on the
kinase bioactivity assay data (Davis et al., 2011)

interactions with Kd210 000 were extracted as negative samples.
We got 3564 overlapping interactions between our screened nega—
tive samples and the experimentally supported ones. We calculated
the frequency distribution of overlapping negative samples with re—
spect to an increasing cutoff threshold of the confidence scores of
our screened negative samples, which is shown in Supplementary
Figure 85. It can be seen that the confidence scores of about 80%
overlapping negative samples are more than 0.5, i.e. the screened
negative samples with larger confidence scores are more likely sup—
ported by drug bioactivity experiments, which indicates the high
credibility of our screened negative samples. Furthermore, we used
the threshold 30.00nM of Kd suggested by Davis et al. (2011) to ex—
tract positive samples and obtained 1867 positive interactions.
Together with the same number of negative interactions, we got an
independent test set, which was used to evaluate the SVM and L2—
logistic classifiers trained on screened and randomly generated nega—
tive samples, respectively. We chose SVM and L2—logistic regression
for performance evaluation because they are, respectively, binary
classification and realistic regression representatives. Figure 5 pre—
sents their precision—recall curves, which show that the classifiers
trained on our screened negative samples greatly outperform those
trained on the random negative samples.

4.5 Prediction of new interactions

After confirming the quality of our screened negative samples, we
built two sets of predictions of potential CPIs on human. The first is
a relatively small—scale prediction set built based on a subset of com—
pounds and proteins included in DrugBank. Specifically, we ex-
tracted 2675 interactions from DrugBank as positive samples and
select an equal number of negative samples from our screened rank-
ing list and then train an SVM classifier based on the chemogenomi—
cal features to predict potential interactions. The trained SVM
classifier predicted about 390 838 new CPIs from all possible
896 304 interactions whose compounds and proteins are included in
DrugBank. We extracted the top 50 interactions for each compound
to get a set of 35 425 interactions, in which 1093 predictions were
annotated in DrugBank and 3224 predictions (3224/35 425%9.2%)
were annotated in STITCH. Note that only 18 580 interactions are
recorded in STITCH for all possible 896 304 (18 580/
896 304%2.1%), thus our predictions rank these curated inter—
actions high and give priority to highly credible interactions.

As a confirmative example, we examined the predicted inter—
actions regarding Donepezil, a centrally acting reversible acetyl—
cholinesterase inhibitor compound that is therapeutically used in the
palliative treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (Birks and Harvey,
2006). Our method predicted 253 target proteins that include

the cholinesterase coding genes ACHE and BCHE, which are two
main targets of Donepezil annotated in DrugBank and STITCH.
In fact, the set of target proteins covers all 17 interactions annotated
in STITCH whose associated proteins are included in the test set, as
shown in Figure 6. To confirm other new predictions, we inspected
the functional annotations of the top 125 target proteins by using
DAVID (Huang et al., 2009) and found that 45 proteins are highly
enriched in the neuroactive ligand—receptor interaction pathway
(P value : 4.7E—32). These proteins are closely related to many dis—
eases including multiple kinds of psychotic disorders. Furthermore,
these proteins are significantly associated in various mental and ner—
vous diseases, such as hypertension (P value : 1.5 E-11), Alzheimer’s
disease (P value:3.1E—4), Parkinson’s disease (P value:3.0E—4)
and arteriosclerotic vascular disease (P value : 1.3E—3). Figure 6
gives an illustration of Donepezil’s target proteins and related func—
tional annotations (for the detailed list of proteins involved in the
pathways and diseases, please see the Supplementary Table S2).

In addition, to facilitate the research community, we built the se—
cond set (a large—scale one) of predictions by constructing a large train-
ing set that consists of all 6354 interactions included in DrugBank and
the equal number of screened negative samples. The trained SVM clas—
sifier predicts more than 6 340 000 CPIs (please refer to the
Supplementary Material for detail). These new predictions would be
helpful for identifying truly druggable targets in new drug design.

5 Discussion and conclusion

The identification of interactions between compounds and proteins
plays an important role in the genomic drug discovery. However,
experimental validation of CPIs is still laborious and expensive,
although various high—throughput biochemical assays are available.
In silico prediction methods are appealing to guide experimental de—
sign and to provide supporting evidence for the experimental results.
Methods based on machine learning have been proposed and dem—
onstrated encouraging performance. However, their performance
and robustness depend on the training set in which negative samples
have equal importance to positive samples. Unfortunately, our

knowledge of negative samples of CPIs is extreme limited which re-
stricts severely the performance of computational methods. This
problem motivated us to propose a systematic screening workﬂow
to identify reliable negative CPIs. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work devoted to screen reliable negative samples of CPIs.

Our screening framework is based on the assumption that the
proteins dissimilar to any known/predicted target of a given com—
pound are not much likely to be targeted by the compound and vice
versa. In the view of chemogenomical space, we managed to find
those compound—protein pairs that locate far from all positive sam—
ples in the chemogenomical space as negative samples, which really
contributed to the performance improvement of both classical classi—
fiers and existing computational methods. Furthermore, the com—
pounds and proteins associated with a small number of known
interactions were excluded to reduce the possibility of taking real
interactions as negative interactions due to activity cliff and scaffold
hopping. The feature divergence filtering further consolidated the
strength of our dissimilarity rules. Extensive experiments demon—
strated that our screened negative samples are highly credible and
helpful for identifying CPIs.

On the basis of the screened negative samples and positive samples
obtained from DrugBank, we carried out prediction of potential CPIs
on human and C.elegans by training SVM classifiers on the chemoge—
nomical features. Also, we gave a confirmative example that the newly
predicted target proteins of Donepezil are highly enriched in mental
and nervous pathways and diseases. In summary, our screened negative
samples and predictions provide the research community with a useful
resource for identifying drug targets and constitute a helpful supple—
ment to the current curated compound—protein databases.

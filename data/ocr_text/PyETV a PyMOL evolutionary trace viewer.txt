ABSTRACT

Summary: PyETV is a PyMOL plugin for viewing, analyzing
and manipulating predictions of evolutionarily important residues
and sites in protein structures and their complexes. It seamlessly
captures the output of the Evolutionary Trace server, namely ranked
importance of residues, for multiple chains of a complex. It then
yields a high resolution graphical interface showing their distribution
and clustering throughout a quaternary structure, including at
interfaces. Together with other tools in the popular PyMOL viewer,
PyETV thus provides a novel tool to integrate evolutionary forces into
the design of experiments targeting the most functionally relevant
sites of a protein.

Availability: The PyETV module is written in Python. Installation
instructions and video demonstrations may be found at the URL:

1 INTRODUCTION

Since protein—protein interactions are ubiquitous and an emerging
target for design and therapeutics (Mandell and Kortemme, 2009),
it is critical to improve the tools that enable their characterization.
Here, we present an ET Viewer that provides a hi gh-quality interface
to map and analyze evolutionary forces and the functional sites they
deﬁne across multi-protein interfaces and assemblies. Importantly,
it enables the integration of Evolutionary Trace (ET) analysis
(Lichtarge and Wilkins, 2010; Lichtarge et al., 1996) with any
type of structural and biophysical information accessible to PyMOL
(DeLano, 2002).

ET is a well-validated method to identify functional sites and
their residue determinants in proteins. It drives experiments that
efﬁciently elucidate the molecular basis of binding, catalysis
and allostery, and that rationally perturb networks (Ribes-Zamora
et al., 2007; Rodriguez et al., 2010). ET ranks the ‘evolutionary
importance’ of sequence positions by tracking whether their
variations during evolution correlate with large or small divergences
among orthologs and paralogs (Lichtarge et al., 1996). These
ET ranks are robust, and the best-ranked sequence positions
form continuous spatial clusters (Wilkins et al., 2010) that reveal
functional sites and their functional determinants. Varying the
threshold of importance reveals these sites at varying levels of

detail. Recent studies show that small motifs of ET residues can
be compared across all protein structures to predict functions in
enzymes and non-enzymes alike, thereby validating ET predictions
of functional determinants on a large scale (Erdin et al., 2010;
Kristensen et al., 2008).

Yet, the study of the structural interactions of evolutionary
important ET residues across structural interfaces has been limited.
The ET report_maker (Mihalek et al., 2006) only provided a PDF
report of individual sequence or structure ET analysis, with no
graphical user interface. A prior Evolutionary Trace Viewer (ETV)
that did provide an interactive molecular viewer (Morgan et al.,
2006) could only display just a single protein chain at a time; and it
could not show surfaces, secondary structure elements or any other
type of information, such as crystallographic B-factors, electrostatics
or bound ligands. By addressing these problems, PyETV offers a tool
to study protein functional determinants and evolutionary forces in
the more relevant structural context of quaternary interactions.

2 OVERVIEW OF PYETV

PyETV builds on the popular and extensible PyMOL (DeLano,
2002) platform. PyMOL is a molecular graphics package to view,
select, label and perturb any number of structures or residues in
many ways (e.g. cartoon, surface, stereo, etc.). Moreover, it is
easily extended with plugins—scripts that overlay complementary
information through custom interfaces, such as the APBS plugin (by
M. G. Lerner) to generate electrostatics maps. Likewise, PyETV,
which opens when selected among the items under the ‘Plugin’
menu, speciﬁcally maps ET ranks onto structures.

2.1 Loading evolutionary information

The primary source of precomputed ET rank data is the
ET server (http://mammoth.bcm.tmc.edu/ETserver.html), which
regularly updates to incorporate new PDB (Berman et al., 2000)
structures. If a user wishes to start with a new protein sequence or
provide a custom alignment, new ET rank data can be generated via
the ET Wizard feature of ETV (Morgan et al., 2006).

ET rank data can be loaded into PyETV in several ways:

(1) Most simply, PyETV has a ‘Load trace’ feature that takes a
single PDB code and chain identiﬁer and fetches ET ranks
and the matching PDB chain directly from the ET server.
Similarly, traces and structures of entire biological units can
be loaded at once (see Section 2.4).

(2) Alternatively, PyMOL scripts can be used to launch PyMOL
and to simultaneously load multiple structures and their
corresponding traces. After selecting PyETV in the ‘Plugin’

menu, the ranks are mapped to their corresponding structures.
Web links to such scripts are available in the ET server.

(3) Finally, users can explicitly specify in PyETV a directory path
to a rank data ﬁle they have produced themselves or obtained
from sources mentioned above.

2.2 Basic viewing

Once the ET data are loaded for any number of chains, the top-ranked
residues of each one can be highlighted at any desired threshold of
evolutionary importance by dragging a slider (horizontal scrollbar)
speciﬁc to that structure. The color scheme is ﬂexible: it can
be made uniform (all red for the top n-th percentile rank of
importance), or it can follow a rainbow spectrum in which
red is the most important and purple the least so. For added
clarity, top-ranked residues may also be distinguished from the
rest of the structure by their representation (e. g. spheres, C-alpha
atoms, sticks). (For a video demonstration, see http://www.youtube.
com/watch?v=Wt5Q0vau24.) These operations can be repeated
individually for each chain, or they can be coordinated among all
chains to display the same threshold of importance throughout a
complex.

2.3 Statistics of trace clusters

After selecting top-ranked residues for some threshold, PyETV
provides z-scores (Mihalek et al, 2003; Wilkins et al, 2010) that
quantitatively assess whether these residues cluster within a single
protein structure or across a protein—protein interface more so than
expected by chance (i.e. if z-score > 2). High z-scores indicate that
surface groupings of ET residues may well reveal functional sites.
Two types of clustering z-scores are available for single structures:
one that accounts for close sequence neighbors (3D biased z—score)
and another that does not (3D no-bias z-score). For protein—protein
complexes, a similar z-score, called Zcouphng, is also available.

2.4 PISA assembly tool

It is often non-trivial to extract the biologically relevant complex
from a PDB ﬁle. As an aid to general users, PyETV can
load a macromolecular assembly directly from Protein Interfaces,
Surfaces and Assemblies (PISA, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/
prot_int/pistart.html) (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007), and match
precomputed traces to each chain. The user need only to supply a
PDB code. Mappings of ET ranks can be simultaneously controlled
over all chains at once to examine the joint distribution of importance
over the entire complex. To assist with interface analysis, one may
select residues in a structure that is in contact with any ligand, such
as a protein complex partner.

For demonstrations of these features, see the following: (i) to
load PISA structures, map ET ranks and select a protein—protein
interface, view http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VCdKPKqLdg.
(ii) for another video example of selecting and isolating interface

residues with ET ranks mapped to these residues, visit http://www.
youtube.com/watch?v=OUyaJCSYQQA

3 CONCLUSION

PyETV integrates data from several sources (ET, PDB, PISA) and
extends the trace-to-structure mapping originally implemented in
the J ava-based ETV to any number of structures and traces. PyETV
relies on the power, ﬂexibility and wide availability of the PyMOL
molecular visualization system and its extensibility through Python.
Future updates may include new tools for analyzing protein—protein
interfaces, mapping new attributes such as correlations between two
residues or ET ranks for residue pairs, and incorporating quality
measures that supplement the clustering z-score.

Abstract

Motivation: Uridine diphosphate glucunosyltransferases (UGTs) metabolize 15% of FDA approved
drugs. Lead optimization efforts benefit from knowing how candidate drugs are metabolized by
UGTs. This paper describes a computational method for predicting sites of UGT—mediated metabol—
ism on drug—like molecules.

Results: XenoSite correctly predicts test molecule’s sites of glucoronidation in the Top—1 or Top—2
predictions at a rate of 86 and 97%, respectively. In addition to predicting common sites of UGT
conjugation, like hydroxyl groups, it can also accurately predict the glucoronidation of atypical
sites, such as carbons. We also describe a simple heuristic model for predicting UGT—mediated
sites of metabolism that performs nearly as well (with, respectively, 80 and 91% Top—1 and Top—2
accuracy), and can identify the most challenging molecules to predict on which to assess more
complex models. Compared with prior studies, this model is more generally applicable, more ac—
curate and simpler (not requiring expensive quantum modeling).

1 Introduction

Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are an im—
portant family of proteins that metabolize 15 % of FDA—approved
drugs (Williams et 61]., 2004). UGTs conjugate glucuronic acid to a
diverse range of molecules, rendering them more hydrophilic and
more easily eliminated. Specifically, the glucuronic acid can conju—
gate to oxygens, nitrogens, sulfurs or carbons, in order of decreasing
likelihood (Fig. 1).

Understanding and modeling UGT metabolism is important be—
cause conjugation can affect the safety and efficacy of drugs. For eX—
ample, a genetic polymorphism that inactivates a specific UGT
significantly increases the bone marrow toxicity of irinotecan, by
preventing its primary route of elimination (Carlini et 61]., 2005).
Similarily, genetic polymorphisms that increase expression of a

specific UGT reduce the efficacy of atorvastatin, a commonly used
HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (Prueksaritanont et 61]., 2002;
Riedmaier et 61]., 2010). More commonly, drug candidates are opti—
mized to ensure that they are metabolically stable and, therefore,
not too rapidly eliminated (Kumar and Surapaneni, 2001).
Identifying the specific atoms of a candidate drug that are glucor—
onidated during UGT—mediated metabolism—its sites of metabolism
(SOMs)—is valuable to lead optimization efforts. Knowing the
SOMs of a candidate drug allows medicinal chemists to design new
compounds with improved bioavailability. Computational methods
that predict UGT—mediated SOMs for drug—like molecules are just
now beginning to appear. So far, the literature reports two
approaches to predicting UGT SOMs (Peng et 61]., 2014; Rudik
et 61]., 2015). Both methods use machine learning to encode the

Fig. 1. Four types of UGT catalyzed reactions. UGTs attach glucoronides to
molecules to detoxify them and make them easier to excrete. Glucoronides
can be attached to several atom types in a molecule, for example (in order of
decreasing likelihood) oxygens, nitrogens, sulfurs and carbons. Specific ex-
amples, from the database, of each of these conjugation reactions is dis-
played. The site of conjugation is circled in the parent molecules

chemical and biological rules represented in a set of reactions ex—
tracted from the Accelrys Metabolite Database (AMD).

Here, we present two models to predict UGT metabolism. First,
we propose a simple heuristic model (based on global statistics) to
predict UGT metabolism. This simple model correctly predicts the
site of UGT conjugation in >80% of molecules. This heuristic model
provides both a baseline of performance against which other meth-
ods can be compared, and also a method for identifying specific
molecules in the dataset that are difficult to predict without model—
ing. Second, we introduce XenoSite UGT, an adaptation of an algo—
rithm previously developed by our group to predict drug
metabolism by cytochrome P45 Os (Zaretzki et al., 2013). The
XenoSite UGT model uses a similar approach as existing methods,
by learning rules from a training dataset derived from the AMD. We
built the XenoSite model using 2898 unique substrates containing
4557 glucoronidation reactions, 3.2 times more reactions than used
in previous models.

XenoSite improves on existing approaches, including the simple
heuristic model, in several ways. First, it improves on the SOM—UGT
model described by Peng et al. (2014), who used support vector ma—
chines to build four independent classification models to differentiate
between observed and non—observed SOMs for common substructures
vulnerable to UGT—mediated metabolism—aromatic and aliphatic hy-
droxyls, carboxylic acids and nitrogen containing groups. Unlike
XenoSite, SOM—UGT cannot predict glucuronidation of less common
or atypical substructures, such as ketones, thiols, or amides.
Moreover, Peng et al. (2014) do not describe or test any strategies for
combining the predictions of their four independent models into a sin—
gle set of predictions for a given molecule. This is a critical shortcom—
ing, because in practice individual molecules are being evaluated for
metabolic soft spots, and there is no way to know the performance of
SOM—UGT at correctly identifying these soft spots on a per—molecule
basis. In contrast, XenoSite is a single model that produces predictions
for all atoms in molecule, and can even identify atypical sites of conju—
gation accurately. Second, XenoSite improves on the Site of
Metabolism Prediction (SOMP) model described by (Rudik et al.,
2015), which uses fingerprint descriptors in a naive Bayes classifier to
rank all atoms in a molecule by their likelihood of being conjugated
by UGTs. However, SOMP was only tested on small, uncharged mol-
ecules, and was not evaluated on difficult to predict molecules. On
these challenging molecules, XenoSite was significantly more accurate
than SOMP, SOM—UGT and the heuristic model.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Training data

The AMD was used to build a dataset of UGT substrates with their
annotated sites of glucoronidation. Each reaction in the AMD con-
tains reactant and product molecular structures, the catalyzing en—
zyme, and the species involved in the reaction. We extracted 4325
human reactions labeled as glucoronidation by the AMD. To con—
firm the AMD’s classification, we used SMARTS string matching
to check that each reaction product included an added glucoronide
attached to an oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, or sulfur atom. UGT—
mediated SOMs were identified through analysis of reactant and
product structures to identify which reactant atom(s) are glucoro—
nidated. In total, 2839 unique substrates containing 3340 SOMs
were curated from the AMD. All atoms in each molecule were clas—
sified into one of four substructure groups, matching those in Peng
et al. (2014). These groups were aliphatic hydroxyls (AlOH), aro-
matic hydroxyls (ArOH), carboxylic acids (COOH) and nitrogen
containing sites (Nitrogen). The Nitrogen group contained aro—
matic and aliphatic amino nitrogens, and aromatic and aliphatic
heterocyclic nitrogens. All remaining oxygens, nitrogens, sulfurs
and carbons were added to the Atypical group. For example, nitro-
gens in sulfoamides, urea and carboxamides were included in the
Atypical group because they are only rarely conjugated. The exact
definitions of these groups are included in the Supplementary
Materials. As expected, commonly glucoronidated substructures
(Fig. 2) were much more common than atypical substructures
(Fig. 3), and there were enough examples to model even the atyp—
ical sites.

2.2 External testing data

Three external datasets were used to assess the generalizability of
models built on the training data. The first testing set contains 141
unique UGT substrates recently added to AMD (January 2015 ver—
sion) that are not in our training dataset. The second and third test

sets respectively composed of 54 and 20 substrates were used as val—
idation sets by Rudik et al. (2015) and Peng et al. (2014).

2.3 Heuristic model

We constructed a simple heuristic model based on overall database
statistics. This model was useful for two reasons. First, it provided a
baseline of performance that more complex methods should outper—
form. Second, the molecules it cannot predict were good test cases
for more complicated algorithms. In this heuristic model, all the po—
tential sites of UGT metabolism in a test molecule were identified.
Each potential site was labeled by its overall probability of being
metabolized in the database. Matching these probabilities, the
AlOH, ArOH, COOH, Nitrogen and Atypical groups were assigned
the initial scores of, respectively, 49.6, 76.3, 80.0, 8.5 and 0.14%.
Next, these scores were summed across the whole molecule to com—
pute a normalization term. Finally, the initial scores were divided by
this normalization term to yield the final score. This score sums to
one in molecules that have at least one potential site. The atoms of a
molecule with no potential sites all receive a score of zero. A Python
implementation of this model is included in the Supplementary
Materials to facilitate future studies.

2.4 Descriptors

A vector of numerical descriptors represented each atom in a test
molecule; 98 descriptors in total, 62, 20, and 16 of which encode
topological—, molecule— and quantum chemical—derived chemical

Fig. 3. Atypical chemical groups undergoing UGT-mediated glucorondiation.
In rare instances, ethers, ketones, ureas, carboxamides, sulfoamides, thiols
and tertiary carbons are chemical groups that are glucoronidated. These
chemical groups are collectively referred to as Atypical group in the text.
Across 54965 atypical sites within thousands of molecules, only 85 positive
were identified, where UGT was conjugated with oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and
carbon, respectively, 29, 51, 2 and 3 times. Examples of these atypicals are
shown with sites of UGT metabolism circled

information, respectively. These descriptors were chosen because
they are effective for modeling P450 metabolism in our prior work
(Zaretzki et al., 2013). Descriptors were computed using in-house
software applied to SDF files with 3D coordinates (generated using
Open Babel) and explicit hydrogens (OLBoyle et al., 2011). We
added an additional set of 7 statistical descriptors based on the heur-
istic model. Five of these descriptors encoded the number of certain
substructural groups—AlOH, ArOH, COOH, Nitrogen (NR3,
NHR2, NH2R) and thiols—that are contained in a given substrate.
All atoms of the same molecule had the same values for these de-
scriptors. Two atom-level descriptors, heuristic score (see Section
2.3) and the number of topological equivalent atoms was also
added. A full description of all descriptors used in this work is avail-
able in the Supplementary Materials.

2.5 Machine learning models

A matrix of descriptor encoded atoms was presented to a neural net—
work with 10 hidden nodes. For comparison, we also trained a logis—
tic regressor on the same data. During training, we learn a mapping
between the descriptor values of each atom and the binary experi-
mental response of that atom, metabolized or not metabolized.
Also, atoms in the dataset were weighted so that the less common
elements were equally important to the model’s error function as the
most common atoms. The weights of the model were calibrated dur—
ing training by performing gradient descent on the cross—entropy
error of the difference between the predicted and actual response
values of each atom. Predictions were obtained using a leave—one—
molecule—out cross—validation procedure. Each molecule was pre—
dicted by an independent model trained using the remaining mol-
ecules of the training set.

2.6 Performance metrics

Two different metrics were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy.
The first was the Top—N metric, which considered a substrate cor—
rectly predicted if any of its experimentally observed SOMs were
predicted in the top N rank—positions out of all possible SOMs of
the substrate. Tied scores are handled appropriately, by averaging
Top—N scores over all permutations of the tied sites within each

Simple Molecules

molecule. The Top—2 metric is the standard metric for evaluation
CYP site of metabolism models and is sensible in this context as well
(Rydberg et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2003). We used a paired t—test to
compute the statistic significance between Top—N accuracies. The se—
cond metric was the area under the ROC curve (AUC) (Swamidass
et al., 2010) of the predictions of metabolized and not metabolized
atoms that all belong to the same chemical group: AlOH, ArOH,
COOH, Nitrogen or Atypical. This is a standard metric employed in
machine learning, as well as by Peng et al. (2014), to determine how
well a method is able to distinguish between positives and negative
test cases. This metric does not measure the within—molecule accur—
acy, which is much more important for this specific application. At
the same time, it exposes which types of sites are best predicted. We
used fisher’s exact test to compute the significance of ROC differ-
ences, choosing the score cutoff at the point closest to the upper left
corner of the ROC plot. All significance tests used a threshold of
0.05.

racies of 86.1, 97.1 and 98.9% for the training set (Table 1 and

Nitrogen, and Atypical chemical groups were, respectively, 87.1,
83.1, 87.5, 93.3 and 98.4%. It appears that modeling UGT metabol—
ism is easy for most molecules; according to the Top—2 metric, the
XenoSite models were 10% more accurate than CYP models, and
the heuristic model alone was 91% accurate. According to the Top—
1, Top-2 and Top-3 metrics the performance difference between
XenoSite and the baseline heuristic was respectively 6, 5 and 4%.
Likewise, the accuracy of the neural network and logistic regressor
models differed by less than one percent for all performance metrics,

but this improvement was consistent so we decided to continue

using the neu

ral network.

At the same time, the neural network identified Atypical and

Nitrogen sites much better than the heuristic model. About 80% of

the training set molecules were very easy, and predicted correctly by

the heuristic model. The remaining molecules were difficult, but

often predicted correctly by XenoSite (Fig. 5).

the human UGT metabolism model to differentiate metabolized from non metabolized sites across the whole dataset (Top-2 accuracy) and within all potential
sites of the same substructure groups (AUC accuracy). The 10 most important descriptors are plotted. The heuristic and topological descriptors were most im-
portant. Surprisingly, none of the quantum level descriptors were important. Consequently, the final model we publish in the website does not run a quantum

simulation to make predictions

model. Next, we selected the 508 molecules that were poorly pre—
dicted by the heuristic model (with no validated SOMs within the
molecules’ first ranked heuristic scores). Next, we randomly per—
muted each descriptor column (or group of closely related descrip—
tors) in the input data for these molecules. The trained model was
applied to the permuted data, and the performance drop across all
the molecules was recorded. The higher the performance drop, the
more important the descriptor to the model’s performance.

We saw similar results using all performance metrics (Fig. 6).
Using the aggregate Top—2 performance as a guide, this analysis
identified topological descriptors (identities of the atom and its
neighbors (atoms one, two and three bond away), number of bound
hydrogens and heavy atoms and size of ring containing the atom)
and heuristic descriptors (heuristic score and number of substruc—
tures) as the most important descriptors for differentiating metabo—
lized sites from non—metabolized sites. The result revealed that
XenoSite heavily relies on local topology for calculating SOM score,
and does not need descriptors from the quantum simulation. Similar
results were seen in the substructure—specific sensitivities. Here, once
again, topological and heuristic descriptors were the most import—
ant, and no quantum chemical descriptors were necessary. At the
same time, a few molecule—level descriptors (like logP) were also im-
portant. Notably, the two heuristic descriptors were consistently
among the most important.

3.3 Performance on external dataset

We settled on using a neural network trained on heuristic and topo—
logical descriptors for our final model, but also saw value in the
heuristic model’s simplicity. Both the neural network and the heuris—
tic models performed well on the external testing dataset of 141
molecules (Fig. 7). Just like in the the training set, the neural net—
work performed better than the heuristic model (83.7 versus 75.5%
Top—1 accuracy). Accuracies in substructure AUCs, however, were
essentially identical except with atypical sites. Here, the neural net—
work achieved an AUC of 99.5%, compared with 55.4% for the
heuristic model. Overall, performance on the testing dataset of ei—
ther model was comparable to the cross—validated performance on
the training dataset.

3.4 Comparison to prior studies

Performance comparisons to prior methods using previously pub—
lished external datasets were inconclusive. We first compared
XenoSite to SOMP (Rudik et al., 2015). SOMP’s test set included
20 molecules. Prediction accuracies of XenoSite and SOMP (Rudik
et al., 2015) on this test—Top—1, —2 and —3 scores of 90, 95 and
95%, respectively for SOMP versus 95, 95 and 100% for
XenoSite—were not statically significant. Similarly, the SOM—UGT
model in Peng et al. (2014) was validated using an external dataset
of 54 molecules, reporting only sensitivity and specificity for each
chemical group. Difference in accuracies was not statistically signifi—
cant (Fig. 8), probably because this dataset is small and is mainly
composed of very easy to predict molecules.

A test set built using 49 molecules that the heuristic model does
not predict accurately according to the Top—1 metric, showed
XenoSite is significantly more accurate than the heuristic model,
SOM—UGT and SOMP. A subset of 49 difficult molecules was iden—
tified from the 141 external test set molecules. Each of these 49 mol—
ecules was not correctly predicted by the heuristic model. The sites
of UGT metabolism for these 49 molecules were predicted using
SOMP’s website and SOM—UGT software. Top—N and substructure
AUC metrics were used to assess the performance of the two models.

Fig. 8. The XenoSite predictions on an external dataset of 54 molecules. The
external dataset in the Peng et al. (2014) study is used to test our model. The
published performance of SOM-UGT are depicted as stars. XenoSite ROC
plots are depicted as solid black lines. Heuristic ROC plots are depicted as
dash lines. The points closest to the upper left corner of the XenoSite ROC
plots are chosen for comparison to SOM-UGT. The performance difference
between our model and the SOM-UGT on this test set is not statistically sig-
nificant (Fisher's exact test (2 x 4) two-tailed P—values: AIOH: 0.636, ArOH:
0.340, COOH:0.058, Nitrogen: 0.229)

The true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative val—
ues were calculated using the point closet to the upper left conner on
the ROC curve. SOMP was unable to make predictions on two mol—
ecules with positive charges in this testing set while all other models
could. As shown in Table 2, XenoSite outperforms all other models
across all accuracy metrics. Specifically, XenoSite has statistically—
significant better performance than SOMP, SOM—UGT and the
heuristic model according to the Top—2, —3 and Atypical AUC
metrics.

XenoSite and the heuristic model run very quickly, taking less
than a second per molecule. We expect SOMP, which is based on
fingerprints, is similarly fast. However, SOM—UGT requires 5 9 mi—
nutes to predict the 49 molecules in the test set. In this regard,
SOM—UGT is substantially slower than other approaches, and there—
fore less useful for screening large numbers of molecules.

To compute the Top-N performances, a global SOM-UGT model was con-
structed predicting positive sites that were predicted positive by any of the
four published substructure-speciﬁc models. For each metric, the highest per-
formance is bold, along with any scores not statistically different from the
best performance (using a P-Value cutoff of 0.05 ). XenoSite is the best per-
forming model. The number of metabolized to nonmetabolized AlOH,
ArOH, COOH, Nitrogen and Atypical sites are, respectively, 26/44, 17/23, 2/
15, 8/36 and 2/1062.

These comparisons not only show that our modeling approach
outperformed existing methods in tests, but also highlights a key de—
ficiency in the literature. Accuracy in this problem is strongly driven
by the number of easy molecules that are trivially predicted by a
heuristic method. We recommend future modeling effort should be
directed towards predicting molecules performance according to the
heuristic model on test sets in future studies.

4 Conclusion

This study introduces two approaches to predicting UGT SOMs: (i)
a statistics—based heuristic model and (ii) XenoSite, a neural network
trained on a large database of UGT metabolism. XenoSite accurately
predicts observed SOMs of known substrates 86% of the time, and
outperforms existing methods, including the heuristic model, on dif-
ficult molecules. XenoSite might be most useful in contexts where
atypical sites of UGT metabolism are important and, therefore, the
heuristic model is less accurate.

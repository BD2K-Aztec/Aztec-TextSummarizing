ABSTRACT

Motivation: Fixed nitrogen is an essential requirement for
the biosynthesis of cellular nitrogenous compounds. Some
cyanobacteria can fix nitrogen, contributing significantly to the
nitrogen cycle, agriculture and biogeochemical history of Earth. The
rate and position on the species phylogeny of gains and losses of
this ability, as well as of the underlying nif genes, are controversial.
Results: We use probabilistic models of trait evolution to investigate
the presence and absence of cyanobacterial nitrogen-fixing ability.
We estimate rates of change on the species phylogeny, pinpoint
probable changes and reconstruct the state and nif gene
complement of the ancestor. Our results are consistent with a
nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial ancestor, repeated loss of nitrogen
fixation and vertical descent, with little horizontal transfer of the
genes involved.

1 INTRODUCTION

The cyanobacteria are a biochemically and morphologically diverse
clade of Gram-negative bacteria with major environmental and
economic roles and effects, including global primary productivity
(Iturriaga and Mitchell, 1986; Paerl, 2000), potential uses in biofuel
production (Hu et al., 2008) and in presenting water-borne health
hazards Via toxin production (Codd et al., 2005). Cyanobacteria are
key biocatalysts in the N2 cycle (Vitousek et al., 2002). The rice
paddies of Asia, which feed over half of the world’s population,
depend upon cyanobacterial N2 ﬁxation (Irisarri et al., 2001). The
cyanobacterial genus T richodesmium is responsible for ~42% of
the total global nitrogen ﬁxation of 240 Tg N2 y‘1 (Berman—Frank
et al., 2003).

Cyanobacteria may have existed for 2.7—2.9 billion years
or more (Blank and Sénchez—Baracaldo, 2010; Noffke et al.,
2008; Olson, 2006). A question of primary importance to our
View of the biological environment of the early Earth, and

to cyanobacterial evolution, is whether the last cyanobacterial
common ancestor (LCCA) could ﬁx N2 (reduce N2 to NH3).
Sénchez-Baracaldo et al. (2005) concluded that LCCA was not
N2-ﬁxing. A study of 13 cyanobacterial genomes agreed with
this conclusion (Shi and Falkowski, 2008). A study of a greater
number of genomes, including basal N2-ﬁxers Synechococcus
sp. JA-3-3Ab (Cyanobacteria bacterium Yellowstone A—Prime)
and Synechococcus sp. JA-2-3B’a(2-13) (Cyanobacteria bacterium
Yellowstone B-Prime), reconstructed the status of LCCA as
ambiguous (Larsson et al., 2011). But due to use of parsimonious
ancestral state reconstruction, the relative support for presence
versus absence of N2 ﬁxation could not be quantiﬁed.

Where present in cyanobacteria, N2 ﬁxation is performed by
proteins encoded by m'f genes. The central enzyme is nitrogenase
1 (N2ase), a molybdenum-dependent ATP—hydrolyzing complex
of two metalloproteins: a dinitrogenase 052,62 heterotetramer that
contains the active site for the reduction of N2 (its or and ,8
subunits are coded by the nifD and nifK genes, respectively) and a
dinitrogenase reductase yz homodimer (coded by nifH) that transfers
high—energy electrons to dinitrogenase. N2ase is inactivated upon
oxygen binding, suggesting an origin prior to the Great Oxygenation
Event (Broda and Peschek, 1983) at the start of the Proterozoic eon
between 2400 and 2200 million years ago. There are about 16 m'f
genes in cyanobacteria, of which 8 are regarded as core to the N2
ﬁxation pathway, or 9 including the crucial non-m'f transcriptional
regulator patB (Stucken et al., 2010). Larsson et al. (2011) included
the m'f genes nifEHDKUB and patB in the LCCA genome that
they predicted using parsimony reconstructions, though they state
that this reconstruction is ambiguous. m'f genes have been highly
evolutionarily conserved despite being present in a wide range of
bacterial and archaeal taxa (Ruvkun and Ausubel, 1980; Young,
1992). A vanadium-dependent system, nitrogenase 2, is found in
addition to nitrogenase 1 in the cyanobacteriumAnabaena variabilis.
Iron-dependent nitrogenase 3 is known in other groups (Lyons and
Thiel, 1995).

On a phylogeny of 49 cyanobacterial genomes, we perform
empirical Bayes ancestral state reconstructions for the ability to
ﬁx N2 and for the presence/absence of 27 m'f orthologous groups.
Empirical Bayes ancestral state reconstruction quantiﬁes ambiguity
by giving a posterior probability for each state at each ancestral
node (Pagel, 1999; Yang, 2006). We address the question of whether
there has been any gain of N2 ﬁxation within the cyanobacterial

clade, using a likelihood ratio test (LRT). To reduce the inﬂuence
of phylogenetic uncertainty, we perform these analyses of trait
evolution on a bootstrap sample of phylogenies (Felsenstein, 1988;
c.f. Lutzoni et al., 2001). We also use stochastic mapping to estimate
the number of gains and losses of the ability to ﬁx N2 within
cyanobacteria and the position of these evolutionary events on the
phylogeny (Heulsenbeck et al., 2003; Neilsen, 2002).

2 METHODS

Protein sets for all 49 cyanobacterial genomes in release 108 of integr8
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/integr8) and a proteobacterial outgroup (cf. Swingley
et al., 2008) were downloaded (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S1).
Orthologous groups predicted using OrthoMCL 2.0 (Li et al., 2003) with
MCL 09-308 (van Dongen, 2000) on BLAST results with ‘m S’ masking
and an E-Value cutoff of 10‘5 (Altschul et al., 1997). From trial inﬂation
parameters 1.2, 1.6, 2, 2.8, 3.6, 4.4, 5.2, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 20, the ﬁnal
value, 1.6, was chosen to maximize the number of orthologous groups
in a single copy in each of the 65 species (cf. Swingley et al., 2008).
A maximum likelihood (ML) species phylogeny was estimated, and 50
bootstrap replicates obtained, as described in Supplementary Material S1.
For main analyses, trees were rooted using the outgroup, which was removed
to leave a rooted tree of the 49 cyanobacterial species (Barker et al., 2007).
For trait model selection and ancestral reconstructions, additional analyses
were performed with the outgroup retained and the tree rooted at the mid-
point of the branch between the ingroup and the outgroup (Barker and Pagel,
2005).

Data indicating presence or absence of the ability to ﬁx N2 in the species
or strains were compiled from the literature (Supplementary Table S1).
Parameters of continuous time Markov processes representing evolution of
this binary trait were estimated for the phylogeny of species and these data

using ML in the StochChar package (version 1.1) of Mesquite (version 2.74;
W.P. Maddison and DR. Maddison, http://mesquiteproject.org). Model
selection (Asymm.2 or Mk1) was performed with an LRT. Empirical Bayes
marginal ancestral state reconstructions were obtained in Mesquite using
the ‘global’ approach of Pagel (1999) but with equilibrium state frequencies
(Yang, 2006: 124). To test for N2 ﬁxation gain within the cyanobacterial
clade, the Asymm.2 model with free parameters was compared with
Asymm.2 with the rate of gain ﬁxed close to zero, i.e. 1 x 10‘10 (LRT). To
estimate the number of gains and losses of N2 ﬁxation and their positions on
the phylogeny, Mesquite’s stochastic character mapping was performed 100
times on the ML tree. The distribution of each nif gene across extant genomes
was obtained by text searches of sequence headers in the integr8 database
and the assumption that all sequences in an orthologous group containing a
nif gene were also products of that nif gene. Where a gene was represented
by two or more orthologous groups, it was regarded as present where at
least one of these groups was present, and absent where all the orthologous
groups were absent. Exceptions were nifS and nifU for which, to avoid
masking major differences in orthologous group distribution, ancestral state
reconstructions were performed for the orthologous groups separately. Also,
nifD was assumed present in Nostoc punctiforme (Larsson et al., 2011: 12).
Ancestral state reconstructions of presence/absence of each nif gene on the
ML tree were carried out as above.

Cyanobacteria! N2 fixation

 

orthologous groups and cross-species distribution patterns are given
in Supplementary Table S3. Within cyanobacteria, nifHDKTEXWZ
have a pattern of presence and absence identical to that of the N2
ﬁxation trait.

For the N2 ﬁxation trait, the Asymm.2 model was selected in
preference to Mk1 whether the outgroup was excluded (ML tree,
likelihood ratio statistic 2A£=2.70, 1 d.f., P=0.0202; bootstrap
sample, n=48, maximum 2A5 =2.755, P=0.0189, minimum
2A£=2.63, P=0.0218) or included (ML tree, 2A£=6.47, P:
3.22 X 10‘4). On the ML tree, the accepted Asymm.2 model gave
a posterior probability for N2 ﬁxation in LCCA of 0.61 (Fig. 1)
and the rejected Mk1 model gave a posterior probability of 0.42.
Including the outgroup changed the Asymm.2 posterior probability
only slightly, to 0.64. Across the outgroup-excluding bootstrap
sample, the mean posterior probability of N2 ﬁxation at LCCA
was 0.60 (11:48, SD = 0.050, range 0.363—0.636; Supplementary
Fig. S2).

The ratio of rate of gain of N2 ﬁxation to rate of loss was 0.15
on the ML tree, and across the bootstrap sample had a mean of
0.15 (11:48, SD = 0.00108, range 0149—0153). The rate of trait
gain is signiﬁcantly different from 1 x 10‘10 (ML tree, 2A5 = 11.38,
1 d.f., P: 1.84 X 10‘6; bootstrap sample, maximum 2A£=20.59,
P: 1.38 X10_10, minimum 2M =20.52, P: 1.49 x10_10). The
mean number of gain events across stochastic mappings on the ML
tree was 0.64 (n = 100, SD = 0.75, range 0—3), of losses was
7.97 (n=100, SD = 0.95, range 5—11) and the total number of
evolutionary events (gains + losses) was 8.61 (n: 100, SD = 0.69,
range 8—11), excluding changes occurring in both directions on the
same branch (Supplementary Fig. S3). The locations of the trait
gains most often seen in stochastic mappings suggest most probable
positions for the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of m'f genes (Fig. 1;
Supplementary Table S3 for the nif orthologous group distributions).
The posterior probability of m'f genes at LCCA, with and without
the outgroup included and at the cyanobacterial—proteobacteria1
ancestor, is shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Stochastic mapping
of m'f genes largely suggests the same pattern of gain and loss as
N2 ﬁxation, with a few deviations (see Section 4).

4 CONCLUSIONS

Our phylogeny of species is broadly congruent with others
(e.g. Gupta, 2009; Larsson et al., 2011; Swingley et al., 2008;
Tomitani et al., 2006). The reconstruction for presence versus
absence of N2 ﬁxation in LCCA favours N2 ﬁxation, but only weakly
(probability 2 0.61). This contrasts with Sénchez-Baracaldo et al.
(2005), Shi and Falkowski (2008), Boyd et al. (2011) and David and
Alm (2011), but is in accord with Leigh (2000), Mehta and Baross
(2006), Tomitani et al. (2006), Swingley et al. (2008) and Criscuolo
and Gribaldo (2011). We expect this reconstruction to be reﬁned
as further taxa are included (Supplementary Table S4; Buschbom
and Barker, 2006), but do not expect N2 ﬁxation in LCCA to be
ruled out.

An N2 ﬁxing LCCA would imply that N2 ﬁxation and m'f genes
had arisen by ~3 billion years ago. It is thought that ﬁxed N was
a limiting resource in the early Earth environment (Kasting and
Siefert, 2001; Raven and Yin, 1998). The early Earth appears to have
featured a mildly reducing atmosphere, in which ﬁxed nitrogenous
compounds would have been stable (Catling et al., 2001; Kasting
and Siefert, 2001, 2002). A dramatic decrease in atmospheric CO2

in the early Archaean (~3.5 billion years ago) may have led to
a ﬁxed N crisis by limiting the amount of NOx formation from
N2 and CO2 (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2001), creating evolutionary
pressures for biological N2 ﬁxation at an early stage of prokaryotic
evolution (Towe, 2002), despite the high energetic cost of this
process (at least 16 ATP molecules per N2 ﬁxed; Scherer et al.,
1988). Alternatively, the origin of N2ases may pre—date the origin
of biological N2 ﬁxation. The ﬁrst N2 ases may have been N2 -using
respiratory enzymes or cyanide detoxiﬁcation centres (Fani et al.,
2000; Postgate and Eady, 1988).

The means of the spread of N2 ﬁxation after its appearance has
been another outstanding question. It has been unclear whether N2
ﬁxation has spread by HGT, or if vertical descent has had a larger
impact. The rate of gain of N2 ﬁxation within the cyanobacterial
clade was found to be signiﬁcant, but much lower than the rate
of loss. Consistent with this, stochastic character mapping most
frequently suggested zero trait gains (51% of mappings; 35%
showed one gain) and always suggested a higher number of trait
losses than gains. In the 35% of instances in which the N2 ﬁxing
trait was not ancestral and was gained only once, the most common
position (86% frequency) of trait gain occurred very close to the root,
just after the split between Gloeobacter violaceus and all remaining
cyanobacteria (Fig. 1). This may be a site of HGT. There is very
slight support for additional potential HGT events: 6% of mappings
showed gain of N2 ﬁxation in the branch leading to Cyanothece sp.
PCC 7425; 12% showed a gain in the ancestor of Synechococcus
sp. J A—3-3ab and Synechococcus sp. JA-2-3B’a(2-13). Additionally,
9% of mappings included at least one instance of a gain of N2
ﬁxation, followed by loss on the same branch, manifested as absence
in the extant descendant(s), which usually occurred amidst recent
Prochlorococcus ancestors; 4% showed a single branch lose and
subsequently gain N2-ﬁxing ability. Zehr et al. (1997) suggested
that any HGT in cyanobacterial N2 ﬁxation would have happened
early, and our results indeed suggest the most probable HGTs have
occurred near the root of the phylogeny (Fig. 1), aside from the case
of the potential HGT event in the terminal branch culminating in
Cyanothece sp. PCC 7425.

Stochastic character mapping suggests that one loss of N2
ﬁxation occurred either just before (in 44% of mappings) or
after (44%) the split between the Synechococcus elongatus PCC
7942/Synechocococcus Sp. ATCC 27144 clade and its sister group.
Most other losses occurred recently in independent strains (Fig. 1).
Our phylogeny supports both the monophyly of heterocyst—forming
cyanobacteria (Henson et al., 2004) and their evolution within an
N2-ﬁxing lineage, dated at 2450—2100 million years ago (Tomitani
et al., 2006).

Ancestral state reconstructions on nif genes are broadly similar
to the N2 ﬁxation results (Supplementary Fig. S4; Supplementary
Material S2). Our reconstructions for LCCA (posterior probability
> 0.5) agree with Larsson et al. (2011) in the presence of nifEHDK U
and potentially nifB. Our results also predict nifT, nifN, nifX,
nifS, nifV, nifW, nifZ, and have ﬁner resolution of nifS and nifU
orthologous groups. Raymond et al. (2004) suggest that the N2ase
gene family has evolved as a unit, with a highly conserved operon
structure.

Our analysis has shown that loss of N2 ﬁxation has been more
prevalent than HGT in cyanobacteria, despite evidence for HGT
of N2ase in other systems (Raymond et al., 2004). Our results are
consistent with a pre-cyanobacterial origin of N2 ﬁxation, perhaps

even in the Last Universal Common Ancestor, followed by repeated
independent loss (Fani et al., 2000; Normand et al., 1992; Young
1992). We conclude that trait loss has been the predominant agent
in sculpting the modern distribution of N2 ﬁxation in cyanobacteria.

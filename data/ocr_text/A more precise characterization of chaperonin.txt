ABSTRACT

Motivation: Molecular chaperones prevent the aggregation of
their substrate proteins and thereby ensure that they reach their
functional native state. The bacterial GroEL/ES chaperonin system is
understood in great detail on a structural, mechanistic and functional
level; its interactors in Escherichia coli have been identified and
characterized. However, a long-standing question in the field is: What
makes a protein a chaperone substrate?

Results: Here we identify, using a bioinformatics-based approach
a simple set of quantities, which characterize the GroEL-substrate
proteome. We define three novel parameters differentiating GroEL
interactors from other cellular proteins: lower rate of evolution,
hydrophobicity and aggregation propensity. Combining them with
other known features to a simple Bayesian predictor allows
us to identify known homologous and heterologous GroEL
substrateproteins. We discuss our findings in relation to established
mechanisms of protein folding and evolutionary buffering by
chaperones.

1 INTRODUCTION

Molecular chaperone systems and their interaction with substrate
proteins are a fascinating paradigm in molecular biology.
Chaperones assist newly synthesized polypeptide chains to fold and
mature to functional proteins: they are able to rescue substrates
trapped in energetically unfavorable states (Hartl and Hayer—Hartl,
2002), and are markedly over-expressed under cellular stress to
prevent the aggregation of unfolded proteins. In fact, one could say
chaperone substrates are proteins on the edge, often carrying out
important cellular functions but relying on helper proteins to reach
their native state.

Arguably, the best studied chaperone system are the bacterial
Hsp60/Hsp10 (GroEL/ES) heat shock proteins (Fenton and
Horwich, 1997; Hartl and Hayer—Hartl, 2002; Xu et al., 1997).
GroES functions as a lid-like structure, allowing for the full
encapsulation of substrate proteins inside the GroEL cavity, thereby
providing a secluded folding environment; productive folding
can involve various rounds of binding to and release from the

chaperonin (Weissman et al., 1994). The in vivo substrate proteins
of Escherichia coli GroEL have recently been identiﬁed and
characterized experimentally (Chapman et al., 2006; Kerner et al.,
2005); between 250 and 320 proteins interact with the chaperone in
the cell under regular growth conditions with different interaction
propensities.

In spite of these sophisticated experimental studies, a few speciﬁc
features of chaperonin substrates have been described so far. Due
to the limited size of the GroEL cavity, their molecular weights
range predominantly between 20 and 60 kDa (Kerner et al., 2005;
Sakikawa et al., 1999); they show a speciﬁc enrichment in certain
fold types, such as the TIM barrel (Kerner et al., 2005); they
show lower average folding propensities and higher translation
efﬁciencies (NoiVirt-Brik et al., 2005). In addition, an attempt has
been made to identify speciﬁc chaperone-binding motives in the
substrate proteins, after the idea that they would resemble the GroES
binding loop (Stan et al., 2006); however, the picture is still far from
being complete.

In this article, we establish novel parameters differentiating them
from other cellular proteins, such as lower rate of evolution, lower
hydrophobicity and aggregation propensity; furthermore, we re-
analyze some known factors and examine their relation to our
newly determined ones. As a ﬁnal consistency test, we show
that the quantities delineated by this study can be combined into
prediction algorithms, allowing at least some degree of quantitative
discrimination of GroEL substrates from chaperonin-independent
folders.

2 METHODS

We analyzed speciﬁc properties of various subsets of proteins of E.coli
known to interact with the chaperone GroEL in vivo, as from the lists
published in Kerner et al. (2005) and Chapman et al. (2006). In Kerner et al.
(2005), the authors isolated stabilized GroEL—GroES-substrate complexes; a
quantitative mass-spectrometry approach allowed the identiﬁed 252 GroEL
substrates to be sorted in three classes according to their abundance in
complex with the chaperone, relative to their native levels in an E. coli cell
lysate and based on experimental testing of chaperone usage for several
example proteins (see the Supplementary Material of Kerner et al., 2005, for
a full list). GroEL substrates in E. coli have more recently been identiﬁed by
a second independent study (Chapman et al., 2006) from inclusion bodies
after depletion of cellular GroEL levels, yielding 317 proteins; 136 proteins
are common to both datasets (Noivirt-Brik et al., 2005). Our analysis is
based both on various combinations of GroEL substrate proteins belonging
to Classes I, II and III of Kerner et al. (2005), and on the full set of identiﬁed
GroEL substrates of Chapman et al. (2006).

Statistical setup: to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of the differences
between the GroEL substrates and the entire proteome, we consistently
adopted the same procedure already used in Noivirt—Brik et al. (2005), which

is independent of the speciﬁc feature one is looking at, and hinges on the
fact that the substrates are nothing but a particular subset of the proteome
of cardinality n: (i) we extracted from the proteome N random subsets
of n elements each (ii) for each of the subsets i, we computed its mean
m, i = 1, ...,N. Note that for very large N, we expect the ms to be Gaussianly
distributed, with the same average as the population’s. We empirically
took N 25000, which guarantees that the deviations from Gaussianity are
small enough to legitimate the use of Z-scores as statistical indicators for
signiﬁcance (iii) for each feature under examination, we compared the mean
of the GroEL substrates mGroEL to the mean m and the SD 0 of the mis. It
was then possible to give a Z-score equal to (m—mGroEL)/o.

Rate of evolution: for each transcribed gene of E.coli, we computed the
corresponding closest gene in eight other organisms (Table 2), whose
sequences we obtained from the KEGG database (Kanehisa and Goto,
2000). Closeness is deﬁned by sequence identity calculated according to
the Needleman—Wunsch algorithm as implemented in NEEDLE (Rice et al.,
2000). In principle, phylogenetic proximity of the considered organisms
suggests that gene pairs selected on the basis of high sequence similarity
correspond to proteins with orthologous function; for this study, only gene
pairs with at least 40% sequence identity were considered. The assigned gene
pairs were veriﬁed by conﬁrming that they share the same classiﬁcation in
terms of KEGG orthology classes (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000), where such
a classiﬁcation was available. In this manuscript, we use the ratio dN/dS of
the number of non-synonymous and synonymous amino acid substitutions
between two given proteins with high sequence identity as a measure for
their rate of evolution. To determine it for each pair of genes assessed, we
ran the software ynOO from the package PAML (Yang, 2007) taking the
distance described in Yang and Nielsen (2000). This in turn implied ﬁrst
aligning the amino acid sequence of each gene product [for which we used
MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004)] and then using this result to align the nucleotide
sequences Via TRANALIGN (Rice et al., 2000).

Hydrophobicity and aggregation propensity: the average hydrophobicity of
proteins was assessed with PEPWINDOW, which gives scores based on
the Kyte-Doolitle index (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982); aggregation propensity
values were computed with TANGO (Femandez-Escamilla et al., 2004),
an algorithm considering stretches of amino acids rather than entire amino
acid sequences, which seems more relevant for aggregation during protein
folding. To avoid a bias, membrane proteins were excluded for the analysis
of both protein hydrophobicity and aggregation propensity. Likewise, to
exclude a possible bias induced by mass spectrometry hydrophobicity
computations were repeated considering only experimentally identiﬁed
E.coli proteins (Corbin et al., 2003; Gevaert et al., 2002; Ishihama et al.,
2008), with entirely similar results. We also tested the FoldIndex algorithm
(Prilusky et al., 2005) and found it to correlate well with both hydrophobicity
and aggregation propensity.

Fold type analysis: as of SCOP database version 1.73, 217 of the 252 GroEL
substrate proteins (and 2644 of the 3928 annotated E.coli proteins in total)
had SCOP classes assigned. The substrates fall into the following classes:
a: 11, b: 17, c: 126, d:52, e:6, f:4 and g: 1. To assess the contribution of structural
properties to the rate of evolution of GroEL substrates, we randomly extracted
100 samples from the E.coli proteome. To build each sample, we chose
randomly 11 proteins of Class a, 17 of Class b, etc. as to reﬂect the structural
properties of the GroEL substrates. We then applied the statistical procedure
described above to the sample distribution. Essentiality, expression level,
molecular weight, GroES-type binding motif and amino acid chain length
were additional parameters tested. Results are shown in the Supplementary
Material.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we illustrate our main results (see Table 1): we ﬁnd
that GroEL substrates show lower dN/dS than other proteins; that
they are less hydrophobic and have lower aggregation propensity

than other proteins; Our results are statistically highly signiﬁcant
(Table 1). Finally structural properties (like the SCOP fold class)
are partly responsible for all the observed effects. To the best of
our knowledge, the ﬁrst result is entirely new in the literature,
and the second one essentially new, although NoiVirt-Brik et al.
(2005) proved a similar behavior for folding propensity, which is
related to hydrophobicity. As for the third result, it was known
that GroEL substrates are enriched in some SCOP classes (Kerner
et al., 2005), but the effects of the enrichment had not been
quantiﬁed precisely. Interestingly, our results hold irrespectively of
the dataset considered [either Kerner et al. (2005) or (Chapman
et al., 2006)]; in particular, as for Kerner et al. (2005) taking into
account only 84 stringent GroEL substrates belonging to Class III, or
omitting Class I substrates, does not signiﬁcantly change our results
(Supplementary Fig. Sl).

3.1 Parameters describing GroEL substrates

We compared the rate of evolution (dN/dS) between pairs of
genes with high sequence identity coding for proteins of E. coli
and the closely related organism Salmonella typhimurium. Several
reasons suggested this pair of organisms as prime example: (i) both
organisms have comparable genome sizes—E.coli: 4132 genes,
S.typhimurium: 4527 genes, see Table 2—(ii) setting the sequence
identity threshold to 90% still allowed us to conﬁdently map
3316 gene pairs (iii) the two GroEL genes are 100% identical in
their sequence, suggesting that—although not a prerequisite for this
study—proteins of S. typhimurium highly similar to E. coli GroEL
substrates are also likely to interact with their own chaperonin. We
found that GroEL substrate proteins diverge less from their best
matching partners (i.e. the ones with highest sequence identity) than
all mapped gene pairs between E. coli and S. typhimurium (Fig. 1A,
and Supplementary Fig. S 1a). The measured dN/dS for the matched

are three parameters differentiating GroEL substrates from other cellular
proteins [substrate set from Kerner et al. (2005) was used for the plots].
Red histograms: GroEL substrate proteins. Blue histograms: all E.coli
proteins excluding membrane proteins. (A) Rate of evolution dN/dS;
(B) hydrophobicity; and (C) aggregation propensity. The peaks of the
distributions for GroEL substrate proteins are in all cases shifted to
lower values when compared with other cellular proteins. Additionally,
a considerable fraction of cellular E.coli proteins is observed with high
hydrophobicity and aggregation propensity values. It is important to note
that membrane proteins were excluded from the analysis.

GroEL substrates was 0.050; the average rate of evolution of all
mapped pairs 0.073. We then extended the analysis to other gamma-
proteobacteria (Buchnera aphidicola, Haemophilus inﬂuenzae,
Pasteurella multocida, Photorhabdus luminescens, Shigellaﬁexneri,
Vibrio cholerae and Yersinia pestis). In all eight pairs of organisms,
genes coding for GroEL substrate proteins diverge less than their
respective control sets taken as the group of all mapped gene pairs
(Table 2).

We assessed the hydrophobicity and the aggregation propensity
of proteins using two different, well-established algorithms, Kyte-
Doolitle (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) and TANGO (Fernandez-
Escamilla et al., 2004). Both independently showed a clear
indication towards GroEL substrates being less hydrophobic and
less aggregation-prone than chaperonin-independent folders. More
in detail, our study shows that the hydrophobicity averages for
substrates and non-substrates are —0.25 and —0.08, respectively;
analogous results can be obtained for aggregation propensity
(Table 1, Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. Sl). An interesting fact
is that although Kyte-Doolittle and TANGO values for all non-
GroEL substrates correlate well (r=0.69, Fig. 2C), aggregation
propensity and hydrophobicity only show a very weak correlation
when considering GroEL substrate proteins alone (r = 0.02, Fig. 2C).
We also observed a very weak correlation (r=0.06) between
the calculated rates of evolution for matched gene pairs and
the respective hydrophobicity values of the corresponding E. coli
proteins (Fig. 2A). This establishes both low rate of evolution
and low hydrophobicity as criteria describing the GroEL substrate
proteome independently. Aggregation propensity also describes the
GroEL-substrate proteome independently of the rate of evolution
(Fig. 2B). We observe that in general our results, and what has
already been found in NoiVirt-Brik et al. (2005) about a lower
average folding propensity in GroEL substrates, corroborate each
other, since the considered quantities are related.

chaperonin interacting proteins.

certain SCOP fold classes, such as the TIM barrel fold (Kerner
et al., 2005). We tested the hypothesis that the SCOP class bias can
also account for the observed differences: to this end, we created
random sets reﬂecting the SCOP class distribution of the GroEL
substrates, and measured their rate of evolution, hydrophobicity and
aggregation propensity. While the dN/dS of the random subsets
shows a mean of 0.073, the SCOP class correction leads to a mean
of 0.062, which is considerably closer to the value for the substrates;
similar effects hold for all other quantities (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Therefore, we reason that speciﬁc structural properties of the GroEL
substrate set are at least partly responsible for the observed lower
value of our quantities. We additionally tested if a bias in the
expression level (Supplementary Fig. S4) or the essentiality of
GroEL substrate proteins could account for the observed lower
rate of evolution, but found no signiﬁcant effect. We further
analyzed various other parameters; the results are reported in the
Supplementary Material.

Finally, as a proof of the consistency and applicability of our
ﬁndings, we implemented a Bayesian predictor based on the above
features, which we also exercise on known heterologous substrates
(see Table S2) as well as on a second set of experimentally
identiﬁed GroEL substrate proteins (Chapman et al., 2006). All
results related to our predictor are shown in the Supplementary
Material.

3.2 Folding kinetics and evolutionary buffering

We found three novel parameters differentiating GroEL
substrates from other cellular proteins, namely rate of evolution,
hydrophobicity and aggregation propensity. Why are the identiﬁed
factors suitable criteria to describe the GroEL substrate proteome?
A common answer could lie in the folding pathway of proteins
considering robustness to mutations and differences in kinetic
stability of GroEL substrates and proteins folding without the help
of chaperones. The protein folding process has been depicted as a
descent through a funnel-shaped energy landscape, where the native
structure with the least free energy sits at the bottom (Onuchic
and Wolynes, 2004). Proteins with a robust folding pathway reach
the native state fast and seamlessly without the aid of chaperones.
Additionally, these proteins can accommodate for certain mutations
without severe effects on their thermodynamic stability (Bloom
et al., 2006; Tokuriki et al., 2007). On the other hand, chaperone
substrates routinely form kinetically trapped folding intermediates,
leading to the accumulation of non-native isoforms; interaction
with chaperones smoothes their energy landscape and rescues
folding (Altschuler and Willison, 2008). Mutations in chaperonin
substrates, although potentially beneﬁcial for function, are hence
more likely to lead to a further reduction in folding ﬁdelity and
protein stability, explaining the observed lower average rate of
evolution for the GroEL substrate proteome. The rate of folding
is another crucial parameter to successfully reach the native state
in the cytosol. Upon emergence from the ribosome, nascent amino
acid chains of globular proteins need to bury hydrophobic residues
in the core of the protein, thereby stabilizing their structure and
preventing unproductive inter-protein interactions. Proteins with a
relatively lower hydrophobicity and low aggregation propensity
(as observed for the bulk of the GroEL substrates) might have
slower and only partial initial collapsing steps, leading to the
accumulation of folding intermediates with exposed hydrophobic
residues functioning as recognition sequences for GroEL (Fig. 2D)
and which likely cause increased aggregation when translated in a
chaperone-free in vitro system (Niwa et al., 2009).

Several groups have shown that chaperones function as
evolutionary buffers or capacitors, shielding chaperone substrate
proteins from deleterious effects of mutations both at the phenotypic
(Fares et al., 2002; Sangster et al., 2004) and the genetic level
(Tokuriki and Tawﬁk, 2009). Our results indicate that GroEL
substrates have on average a lower rate of evolution than other
cellular proteins; this fact seems to question the applicability of
the so-called ‘buffering hypothesis’ under in vivo conditions. We
speculate that even though GroEL promotes genetic and phenotypic
variation, such an effect might be transient and represent only
a comparatively short phase on evolutionary time scales, getting
rapidly exhausted after the introduction of the chaperone into the
organism. Today, at equilibrium, constraints in the folding pathways
of genuine chaperone substrate proteins under physiological GroEL
expression levels might keep them from reaching their potentially
higher rate of evolution in vivo: because GroEL substrates fold on
the verge of what is energetically possible, they might just not
be able to accommodate more mutations, which are likely to be
detrimental and dramatically impair the folding process. It is also
important to appreciate that other mechanisms already proposed in
the literature might contribute as well to keep evolutionary buffering
effects unobservable in vivo: among them the role of chaperones

play as examiners (Tomala and Korona, 2008) and the recently
proposed intriguing ﬁnding (Specchia et al., 2010) that chaperones
might interfere with genome-wide mutagenesis processes other than
simple random mutations.

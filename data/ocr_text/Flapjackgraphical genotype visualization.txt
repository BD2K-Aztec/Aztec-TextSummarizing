ABSTRACT

Summary: New software tools for graphical genotyping are
required that can routinely handle the large data volumes
generated by the high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) platforms, genotyping-by-sequencing and other comparable
genotyping technologies. Flapjack has been developed to facilitate
analysis of these data, providing real time rendering with
rapid navigation and comparisons between lines, markers and
chromosomes, with visualization, sorting and querying based on
associated data, such as phenotypes, quantitative trait loci or other
mappable features.

Availability: Flapjack is freely available for Microsoft Windows,
Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris, and can be downloaded from

1 INTRODUCTION

The concept of a graphical genotype to Visualize haplotype diversity
between chromosomes has been widely adopted since Young and
Tanksley (1989) used it in the context of restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) mapping populations. Existing software
tools to display graphical genotypes include GGT (van Berloo,
2008) and Geneﬂow (geneﬂowinc.com). The advent of new high—
throughput genotyping technologies have given a renewed stimulus
to the concept of graphical genotyping, through a combination
of dramatic reduction in cost per data point and vastly increased
marker density and throughput. The resultant high—density data
underpin new genetic approaches such as genome—wide association
analysis (Rostoks et al., 2006). It also leads to the possibility of
visually comparing many lines (e. g. samples or individuals) or
sorting and selecting based on phenotype, identiﬁed groupings and
genome features, such as quantitative trait loci (QTL) or gene models
mapped to the genetic or physical genome. However, the ability to
generate datasets with many thousands of markers (McMullen et al.,
2009) on many thousands of lines imposes a signiﬁcant demand
on both software tools and the underlying computer hardware.
Flapjack provides a high performance Visual interface into graphical
genotyping applications in genetics and plant breeding.

2 FEATURES

Flapjack’s main display (Fig. 1) consists of a genotype rendering
canvas that shows the data for a given chromosome. The alleles
are plotted as a grid, with lines/germplasm running horizontally
across the screen and markers/loci running vertically. The line
names are shown in a list to the left, and across the top we
provide a graphical View of the positions of the markers on the
currently selected chromosome (from either physical or genetic
maps). Several alternative map displays are provided, including
a global View that shows where the currently Visible markers are
located on the chromosome, and a local View, that scales and
optimizes the map to concentrate only on the region containing the
currently Visible on—screen markers. Hovering the mouse over an
allele highlights not only the data under the point but also the name
of the line in the lines list, the position on the chromosome display,
and graphically displays the entire dataset for the line and marker at
that position.

Flapjack provides several customizable colour schemes for data
display, and will attempt to auto—select a suitable scheme based
on the type of data loaded. The schemes include a four—colour
nucleotide model (homozygous genotypes get a single colour;
heterozygous genotypes are split diagonally); similarity models, that
use one colour for every allele of a reference line or marker, and a
second colour for any data that differs from the reference; and a
model that performs frequency—based colouring that can be used to
highlight rare alleles and haplotypes on a per—marker basis. Random
colour schemes also exist that are applicable to datasets with a large
number of possible values per allele position, such as SSR data.
Flapjack’s subtle use of colours and gradients allows for pattern
recognition and structure to still be seen, even at the highest levels
of overview.

Once a project is in use, additional data types can be imported and
Visualized alongside the main display. Information on phenotypic
traits—both numerical and categorical (per line)—is displayed as
a heat map running alongside the lines. This can also be used to
reorder the lines, for example, by yield or ﬂowering date.

QTL aligned against chromosome map positions may be
Visualized at the top of the screen, using a novel method of packing
and displaying the features across a custom number of tracks, with
the number controlled by a slider.

A user interacts with Flapjack using one of three modes:
navigation mode, marker mode or line mode; with the latter two
options enabling support for object highlighting and selection. This
provides a graphical means of ﬁltering the data, for example, to
reorder the lines based upon their similarity across a speciﬁc subset

of markers or to export sections of data into their own custom View.
Selections can be made either manually or by markers under a QTL.
Flapjack allows the user to create any number of these custom
Views, each containing its own set of lines, markers, ordering, colour
schemes, bookmarked locations and so on.

The data for a given View—either in graphical or in its underlying
raw format—can be exported back to disk. Images can be produced
and saved in PNG format for the current View, or the on—screen
subsections of a View, and the user can select whether to include all
components (allele data, chromosome maps, line names, traits, etc.)
or pick and choose only the ones of interest. When exporting the
underlying data, similar options are available to export the entire
dataset or to only include data from speciﬁc chromosomes or the
currently selected lines and markers. The data are saved in tab—
delimited plain text ﬁles identical in format to the ﬁles original
imported into Flapjack.

Although completely standalone, with data imported Via simple
plain—text formats, integration with external data sources such
as Germinate (bioinf.scri.ac.uk/germinate) is also possible. This
provides easy selection and export of data directly into Flapjack,
along with web—links back to the line and marker data in the original
database. This feature has been designed to work with any external
data source, by means of supplying Flapjack with a custom URL
that can be queried with key/value pairs.

Flapjack projects are persistent, with all data, Views, user
selections and so on being saved to either an XML—based ﬁle or an
experimental binary format more suited to very large datasets. The
XML and text formats are documented on our web site, and are also
currently supported by iMAS (icrisat.org/bt—biomatrics—imas.htm),
QU—GENE (Podlich and Cooper, 1998), Gramene (Liang et al.,
2008), Genstat (vsni.co.uk/software/genstat) and The Hordeum
Toolbox (hordeumtoolboxcrg). Projects can also be created using a
command—line utility, which provides a convenient integration with
custom analysis pipelines and databases.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

Flapjack is written in Java and is compatible with any system running
Java 1.6 or higher. For convenience, we provide installable versions
with everything required to run the application, including a suitable
Java run—time. These are available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux
and Solaris. Flapjack regularly monitors our server for new versions
and will prompt, download and update quickly and easily when
a new release is available. The code is internationalized and is
distributed with translations in English (UK/US) and German.

The code can take advantage of multicore processors, a feature
especially signiﬁcant for the rendering code, which—among its
other optimizations—is capable of simultaneous rendering across all
cores, greatly improving the end—user experience when navigating
around large or complex datasets. We have designed Flapjack to be
very memory efﬁcient, and are conﬁdent that it can comfortably
handle datasets with hundreds of millions of alleles even on a
machine with just 1 GB of main memory.

4 FUTURE WORK

Future development with Flapjack will entail enhancing its
Visualizations to provide better support for very small datasets,
primarily by enabling the display of all markers across the genome
in a single View. We want to extend support for rendering features
beyond QTL to include more generic features, such as gene models
for SNP data anchored to physical maps, and to provide a graph track
to display summary information such as PIC values or test statistics.
We are also working with academic and breeding company partners
to explore supporting additional data formats such as HapMap and
PLINK, and on closer integration with Germinate, by allowing its
databases to be automatically populated by the data imported into
Flapjack.

Abstract

Summary: Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS or MS”) is a potent technique for characterizing
N—glycan structures. GlycanAnalysis searches a glycan database to support the identification of
glycan structures from MS/MS spectra. It also calculates diagnostic ions of glycan structures regis—
tered in a glycan database (GlycomeDB or KEGG GLYCAN) and searches for MS/MS spectra of
N—glycans that match diagnostic ions to determine the structures. This program functions as a
plug—in for Mass++, a freeware mass spectrum visualization and analysis program.

Availability and implementation: The executable files of Mass++ are available for free at http://
\AMAN.first—ms3d.jp/english/. The GlycanAnalysis plug—in is included in the standard package of

Mass++ for Windows.

1 Introduction

N—Glycosylation is an important post—translational modification of
proteins and has a wide variety of biological roles. N—Glycans form
branching—tree structures consisting of two main antennae, 6—an—
tenna and 3—antenna. Since these structures are assumed to be
related to their biological functions, it is important to characterize
the glycan structures.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful technique for analyzing
N—glycans. The structures can be deduced using tandem MS (MS/
MS). Typical N—glycan analysis using MS is performed in positive—
ion mode. In contrast, Harvey’s method can be adopted in negative—
ion mode, which has proven useful for less ambiguous structural
clarification (Harvey, 2005a,b,c). Harvey described the method—
ology to identify the glycan structure uniquely with the observed
structure—specific ‘diagnostic ions,’ which are included in only nega-
tive—ion MS/MS spectra. Although various excellent computer pro—
grams (e.g. GlycoWorkBench—Ceroni et 61]., 2008) have been
developed for interpreting MS/MS spectra of N—glycans, they do not
consider highly specific features of negative—ion mode analysis (e.g.
diagnostic ions) (see Supplementary Material for details).

Recently, we developed more sensitive methods for analyzing N—gly—
can structures in negative—ion mode using matrix—assisted laser desorp—
tion/ionization—MS with unique chemical labeling (Kaneshiro et 61].,
2011; Nishikaze et 61]., 2012a, b). We thus developed GlycanAnalysis
software to provide support to routine processes in manual interpret-
ation of mass spectrometric data for N—glycan structures, using diagnos—
tic ions searching against the public glycan structural database. For this
software, we developed an algorithm to calculate m/z values of fragment
ions, including diagnostic ions, and to search for structures matching
MS/MS spectra in glycan structural databases. GlycanAnalysis is avail—
able as a free plug—in of Mass—l——l—, pluggable freeware for analyzing and
visualizing MS data (Tanaka et 61]., 2014).

2 Methods

Acidic N—glycans readily form negative—ion species [M—H]_, while
neutral N—glycans do not. Thus, ionizing neutral N—glycans as
anion—adducted forms is a common approach in sensitive N—glycan
analysis in negative—ion mode (Harvey 2005a; Kaneshiro et 61].,
2011; Nishikaze et 61]., 2012a, b; Rohmer et 61]., 2010). Diagnostic

fragment ions can be obtained from both deprotonated ([M-H]_)
and anion-adducted ([M+anion]_) forms.

To determine glycan structures, the m/z values of generated ions
are calculated from the theoretical structure of N-glycans, and the
diagnostic ions from MS/MS spectra are sought as either deproto-
nated or anion-adducted forms (N03_ or HZPO4_ adducts). The
search process consists of repeating the following four steps (see
Supplementary Material for details).

1. Read the structure data of an entry from the glycan database.
Calculate the m/z values of theoretical fragment ions for glycan
structures in all entries. This process does not generate all possible
fragment ions (e.g. performing a brute-force search), but possible
fragment ions speciﬁc to only negative-ion N-glycan fragmentation.

3. Read measured mass spectrometric raw data to automatically
detect peaks and their intensities. Users themselves need not
count generating peak lists.

4. Search for matched precursor ions and diagnostic ions in the
MS/MS spectrum by comparing m/z values. A diagnostic ion is
identical to a D-ion that reﬂects the 6-antenna structure, except
when glycan structures have bisecting GlcNAc.

5. When D-ions (or D—HZO ions) are detected in the input peak
list, the corresponding glycan structure is added to the result list,
the number of matching ions (A, B, C-series and E-ion) is
counted. The matching score is then calculated by the ratio of its
intensity to the total intensity.

As the glycan structure database, the subsets of GlycomeDB
(Ranzinger et al., 2011) and KEGG GLYCAN (Hashimoto et al.,
2006) (a KEGG user license is required) are available.

3 Implementation and usage

GlycanAnalysis runs as a plug-in of Mass++, a free software plat-
form for visualizing and analyzing mass spectrometric data, which
runs in the Windows environment; hence, all functions of
GlycanAnalysis are performed on Mass++ as its functions.

For the standard analysis, the user first opens the target MS/MS
data from the Mass++ file menu, performs peak detection to detect
ion peaks and then opens the GlycanAnalysis plug-in. At this stage,
parameters (mass-error tolerance, labeling method and anion type)
must be set; the input value of the labeling method is used for anno-
tating and calculating the m/z values of precursor ions. After the
database search, candidates for the target glycan structure are listed
in the dialog window (Fig. 1). Descriptions of annotations for the
selected glycan structure in the result list are displayed in the
Mass++ spectrum window. Clicking the text in the Mass++
spectrum window presents the detailed glycan structure as the anno-
tation of glycan fragmentation in another window.

GlycanAnalysis is implemented in C++, and the graphical user
interface is designed with wxWidgets, as with the Mass++ main
program. GlycanAnalysis is included in the Mass++ standard pack-
age and can be downloaded for free from http://www.first-ms3d.jp/
english/ under the Mass++ license.

4 Discussion

GlycanAnalysis is an easy-to-use tool for supporting the structure
identification of N-glycans; its distinguishing characteristic is the
ability to perform a database search using the specific features of
N-glycan anion spectra. Users have the option to select a suitable
peak-detection algorithm implemented in Mass++ and to optimize

predicted candidate structures are displayed in the lower half of the dialog
window with IDs and scores. The Assigned/Theoretical column indicates the
number of matched theoretical fragment ions and the number of all theoret-

Supplementary Fig. S8 for the annotation window.)

parameters because the performance of retrieving candidates de-
pends on these parameters. In addition, the annotation indicated in
the MS/MS spectrum window of Mass++ can be utilized to deter-
mine which peaks are used for the retrieval.

The database search function is the direct implementation of our
developed method but depends only on the existence of a diagnostic
ion without any consideration of peak intensity. Similarly, the corres-
ponding score of the retrieved glycan entry is currently defined as the
number of matching ions. This scoring definition thus has room for im-
provement; the intensity of peaks and its related data can be employed.
This indicates one future direction for improving GlycanAnalysis.

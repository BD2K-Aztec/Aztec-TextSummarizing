ABSTRACT

Motivation: Considerable attention has been focused on predicting
RNA—RNA interaction since it is a key to identifying possible targets
of non-coding small RNAs that regulate gene expression post-
transcriptionally. A number of computational studies have so far been
devoted to predicting joint secondary structures or binding sites
under a specific class of interactions. In general, there is a trade-
off between range of interaction type and efficiency of a prediction
algorithm, and thus efficient computational methods for predicting
comprehensive type of interaction are still awaited.

Results: We present RactIP, a fast and accurate prediction method
for RNA—RNA interaction of general type using integer programming.
RactIP can integrate approximate information on an ensemble of
equilibrium joint structures into the objective function of integer
programming using posterior internal and external base-paring
probabilities. Experimental results on real interaction data show that
prediction accuracy of RactIP is at least comparable to that of
several state-of-the-art methods for RNA—RNA interaction prediction.
Moreover, we demonstrate that RactIP can run incomparany faster
than competitive methods for predicting joint secondary structures.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent years have seen a renewal of interest in the biological roles
of functional non—coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Modern studies have
provided evidence that they can act as ubiquitous regulators in
living cells (Eddy, 2001; Vogel and Wagner, 2007). A class of
small ncRNAs downregulates gene expression post—transcriptionally
via base—pairing with target mRNAs of the ncRNAs to inhibit the
translation into the corresponding proteins. Eukaryotic microRNAs
(miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are very short and
have almost full sequence complementarity to their targets. On the
other hand, several regulatory antisense RNAs have been found in

bacterial chromosomes, which have relatively long sequences and
interact with their target mRNAs in a more intricate manner (Brantl,
2002). This type of interaction comes from the fact that the genes
encoding the antisense RNAs are located at loci different from those
encoding their targets (i.e. trans—encoded antisense RNAs) (Wagner
and Flardh, 2002). In particular, kissing hairpin structures (see
Fig. 1) caused by loop—loop interaction have been observed (Brunel
et al., 2002). To help to understand the mechanism of RNA—RNA
interaction further, as well as to identify target RNAs of speciﬁc
ncRNAs, it is desirable to develop fast and accurate computational
methods for predicting interacting RNA structures.

RNA—RNA interaction prediction has so far been performed by
several computational approaches, which can be roughly classiﬁed
into four groups. The ﬁrst group including UNAFold (Dimitrov
and Zuker, 2004), RNAhybrid (Rehmsmeier et al., 2004) and
RNAdup 1 ex from the Vienna RNA Package (Hofacker et al., 1994;
Hofacker, 2003) disregards intramolecular bonds in both sequences
and computes the minimum free energy (MFE) hybridization. They
work out for short interacting RNAs but are impracticable for
long sequences with intramolecular structures. The second group
belongs to the category that uses the idea of concatenating two RNA
sequences and considering them as a single strand so that the MFE
structure of the resulting sequence can be computed. PairFold
(Andronescu et al., 2005) and RNAcofold (Bernhart et al., 2006)
adopt this procedure, but these methods cannot predict general type
of interaction such as kissing hairpins. Other approaches such as
RNAup (Muckstein et al., 2006), IntaRNA (Busch et al., 2008),
inRNAs (Salari et al., 2010a) and bi staRNA (Poolsap et al., 2010)
fall into the third group, which considers RNA—RNA interaction
as the stepwise process of individual intramolecular foldings and
their hybridization. RNAup and IntaRNA can predict only one
binding site, whereas inRNAs and bistaRNA can predict multiple
binding sites. The ﬁnal group aims at predicting the MFE joint
secondary structure or computing the interaction partition function
under the comprehensive type of interaction. IRIS (Pervouchine,
2004), inteRNA (Alkan et al., 2006), RIG (Kato et al., 2009),
piRNA (Chitsaz et al., 2009), rip (Huang et al., 2009, 2010) and
also inRNAs (Salari et al., 2010a) are listed as this category. These
methods impose natural constraints on the joint structure such that
there are no internal pseudoknots, crossing interactions and zigzags
(Alkan et al., 2006; Chitsaz et al., 2009). Note that Alkan et al.
suggested that these constraints are satisﬁed by all examples of

complex RNA—RNA interactions in the literature. In this sense, we
can consider the class of joint structures satisfying those constraints
the most general type of interaction. Although the ﬁnal group can
cover wider class of interacting structures simultaneously, their
computational costs could be prohibitively expensive for long
sequences.

Prediction of interacting RNA structure can be considered as a
kind of optimization problem in a sense that we seek to minimize
the free energy of the joint structure or maximize a score such
as an interaction probability under the possible topology of the
interacting structure. Various problems presented in bioinformatics
have been formulated as mathematical programming problems,
where the objective function is minimized or maximized under
some constraints. Recently, Bauer et al. (2007) presented LARA
that implements an integer programming—based method for multiple
structural alignment of RNA sequences. To reduce the computational
cost of the structural alignment, they simpliﬁed the mathematical
structure of the integer programming (IP) formulation, eliminating
information on the topology of secondary structure from the
constraints and integrating the structural information into the
objective function, as well as using the Lagrangian relaxation. In
general, IP problems are known to be NP—hard, but use of IP
formulation fascinates us due to its strong and ﬂexible descriptive
power to model a large number of combinatorial optimization
problems.

Motivated in part by Bauer et al.’s work, we present a novel
method called RactIP, RNA—RNA interACTion prediction using
Integer Programming. In our IP formulation, the objective function,
which is to be maximized, is deﬁned as the sum of scores with
respect to internal and external base pairs of two interacting RNAs.
In particular, we make use of posterior probabilities such as base-
pairing probabilities and hybridization probabilities for scores of
internal pairs and those of external pairs, respectively, to incorporate
further structural information into the objective function as in
the case of LARA (Bauer et al., 2007). It is to be noted that
use of such posterior probabilities enables the method to take
account of an ensemble of equilibrium structures approximately,
which will lead to improve expected accuracy. We introduce a
threshold cut technique to solve the IP problem efﬁciently, which
is shown to be reasonable from the viewpoint of maximizing
expected accuracy. By virtue of this technique, RactIP achieves
considerably short run—time despite the computational hardness of
IP. We demonstrate the prediction performance of RactI P on a set
of known interacting RNA pairs both for joint structure prediction

and binding site prediction, making a comparison with several state—
of—the—art methods. Advantages of Ract I P are summarized as
follows:

0 As for joint secondary structure prediction under the most
general type of interaction, RactIP can run overwhelmingly
faster than competitive prediction methods with 0(n6) time
complexities, where n is the length of the longer input sequence.
In fact, experimental results reveal that computation time of
Ract I P is an order of magnitude shorter than that of inRNAs
(the joint structure prediction model) (Salari et al., 2010a),
inteRNA (the Loop Model) (Alkan et al., 2006) and rip
(Huang et al., 2009, 2010). Recently, Salari et al. (2010b)
proposed a sparsiﬁed dynamic programming algorithm whose
time complexity is 0(n5 ) on average. To the best of the authors’
knowledge, RactIP is the fastest method for predicting
both internal structures and binding sites simultaneously on
condition of the comprehensive class of interactions.

0 RactIP is comparable in accuracy to inRNAs (the joint
structure prediction model) and outperforms inteRNA and
rip for joint structure prediction. From the viewpoint of
binding site prediction that disregards (predicted) internal base
pairs, accuracy of RactIP is as good as that of inRNAs (the
binding site prediction model) and better than that of IntaRNA
(Busch et al., 2008).

0 The mathematical model of Ract I P is compact. In particular,
the IP objective function ﬁt in well with the sum of the
posterior probabilities that consider many complex loop
energies necessary to achieve prediction of good quality.

0 The IP—based method is ﬂexible and extensible. Compared with
other computational approaches, it is easy to change the model
to cope with a desired class of secondary structures simply by
adding or removing appropriate constraints. In our model, we
employ additional constraints to represent stacking base pairs,
which is expected to improve prediction accuracy.

The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes
our prediction model Ract I P in detail after providing several
preliminaries to grasp it. We show experimental results of interaction
prediction and discuss them in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Section
5 concludes the article.

2 METHODS

We propose a new method RactIP for RNA—RNA interaction prediction
using IP. RactIP executes the following two steps when two RNA
sequences are given:

( 1) compute the score matrices of the IP objective function for internal
and external base pairs;

(2) solve the IP problem to predict the optimal joint secondary structure.

It should be noted that the program RactIP actually solves the IP problem
using libraries of a high—performance solver (see Section 3 for details).

2.1 Scoring functions for predicting RNA—RNA
interaction

Let 2={A,C,G,U} and 2* denote the set of all ﬁnite RNA sequences
consisting of bases in E. For a sequence a e 2*, let |a| denote the number

of symbols appearing in a, which is called the length of a. For 1 5 i < j 5 |a|,
we let a[i..j] denote a sequence aiai+1"'aj€ 2*.

Let S (a) be a space of all possible secondary structures of a sequence
a e 2*. An element x e S (a) is represented as a |a|2 binary—valued triangular
matrix x = (xij)i<j, Where x1721 means that bases a,- and aj form a base pair.
We denote by P(x | a) a probability distribution over S (a). Let 7-i(a,b) be a
space of all possible hybridized structures between a, b e 2*, which considers
no secondary structures of a and b. An element z e 7-i(a, b) is represented as
a |a| >< |b| binary—valued matrix z = (zl-j), where zij =1 means that the base a,-
interacts with the base bj. We denote by P(z | a, b) a probability distribution
over H(a,b). Let J8(a,b) be a space of the joint secondary structures of
a and b that considers both the secondary structures of a and b and the
hybridized structures between a and b. In other words, J8(a,b) is a subset
of 8(a) x S (b) x H(a,b). We denote by P(6 | a, b) a probability distribution
over .78(a, b), where 6 = (x, y, z) e .78(a, b) such that x e 8(a), y e 8(b) and
z eH(a,b). We assume that each base can be paired with at most one base
regardless of whether the base pair is formed inside or outside the sequence,
and internal pseudoknots and crossing interactions (external pseudoknots)
are disallowed.

We now deﬁne the problem of predicting RNA—RNA interaction as
follows:

DEFINITION 1 (RNA—RNA interaction prediction). Given two RNA sequences
a=a[l..n] e 2* (5/—3/ direction) and b=b[l..m] e 2* (3/—5/ direction),
predict a joint secondary structure a e .7 S (a, b).

To tackle this problem, we ﬁrst deﬁne the gain function for the true joint
structure 6 = (x, y,z) and a predicted joint structure 6 2 (5c, 52,2) as

0(0, 6) = 03/. (x7501— Gm (y, 57) + 060W, (z, 2) ( 1)

it

Here, I (condition) is the indicator function that takes a value of 1 or 0
depending on whether the condition is true or false, ys and 7/}, are weight
parameters for base pairs, and a is a balancing parameter between internal
base pairs and external base pairs. The gain function (1) is equal to the
weighted sum of the number of true positives and the number of true
negatives of base pairs. In order to maximize the expected number of
true predictions, we ﬁnd a joint secondary structure 6 that maximizes the
expectation of the gain function (1) with respect to an ensemble of all possible
joint secondary structures under a given posterior distribution:

Macao]: Z G(a6)P(ola,b). (2)
aeJS(a,b)

For the posterior distribution P(6 | a,b) over a space of joint secondary
structures, we can employ the piRNA model (Chitsaz et al., 2009) and the
rip model (Huang et al., 2009, 2010). However, these exact models are
impractical since 0(n6) time and 0(n4) space are required where n is the
length of the longer RNA sequence. Therefore, we approximate the posterior
distribution over a space of joint secondary structures by its factorization:

P(o | a,b):POc | a)P(y | b)P(Z l a,b) (3)

Finally, we ﬁnd a joint structure 6 2 (it, y, 2) that maximizes the approximate
estimator (4). We should notice that maximizing the approximate estimator
(4) is equivalent to maximizing the sum of: (i) the sum of the base—pairing
probabilities pg?) larger than QS =1/(ys +1); (ii) the sum of the base—pairing

probabilities pg» larger than 63; and (iii) the sum of the hybridization
probabilities ql‘j larger than 6h=1/(yh+1). This means that there is no
need to consider the base pairs whose posterior probabilities are at most
the predeﬁned thresholds e, and 6;, so that the search space for the optimal
structure can be reduced. This threshold cut technique makes our method
run much faster.

2.2 IP model

2.2.] Deﬁnition of IP Integer (linear) programming, which is one of the
mathematical programming methods, seeks to maximize/minimize a linear
function called objective function subject to linear equality and/or inequality
constraints. The most important constraint of IP is that speciﬁed variables
must take integral values. An IP problem where all variables are non—negative
integers can be described as follows:

n

where Clij, bi, Cj e R and xj is a variable deﬁned over a set Z+ of non—negative

integers.

kissing hairpin structure by setting these variables as xl-jz 1, yitj/ =1 and

an IP problem for joint secondary structure prediction as follows:

where pg“), pg” and q,- denote the base—pairing probabilities and the
hybridization probability deﬁned in Section 2.1, respectively, and a e (0, 1)
is a parameter that regulates the proportion of hybridization in the predicted
structure. Recall that values of all variables must be either 0 or 1.

Here, let us look more carefully into each equation of the above
IP formulation. The objective function (5) shows an instantiation of
the approximate estimator (4) using the base—pairing probabilities and
hybridization probabilities. Note that the third term describing sum of scores
of external base pairs is multiplied by a positive weight parameter a. As
suggested by Alkan et al. (2006), we set ae(0, 1) so that external base
pairs are less likely to be formed than internal ones. In this study, we ﬁx
a=0.5, that is, external base pairs contribute to the objective function by
half compared with internal base pairs. Constraints (6) and (7) mean that each
base can be paired with at most one base regardless of whether the base pair
is formed inside or outside the sequence (Fig. 4a). Internal pseudoknots and
crossing interactions are prohibited by constraints (8), (9) and the constraint
(10), respectively (Fig. 4b and c).

To solve the IP problem, we employ the threshold cut technique where we
exclude the IP variables in advance representing internal and external base
pairs whose posterior probabilities are not exceeding a, and 6),, respectively,
deﬁned in Section 2.1, before computing the optimal solution. As described
in Section 2.1, this threshold cut is derived from the viewpoint of maximizing
expected accuracy of joint structure prediction.

2.2.3 Incorporating stacked pairing constraints It is widely accepted that
base pairs in stable RNA structures are likely to appear in a stacked form
rather than an isolated one. Following the IP formulation for predicting
secondary structure of a single RNA sequence proposed by Poolsap et al.
(2009), we deﬁne further variables for promoting stacking base pairs as

follows:
E _ 1 (a,- bonds with a base in a at a position greater than i),
l 0 (otherwise),

i

r 1 (a,- bonds with a base in a at a position less than i),
0 (otherwise).

In the IP formulation, we describe the deﬁnitions of xf and xl.’ as

n i—l
xf: Z x,-,- (1 SVi<n), xf=Zxﬁ (1 <Vi5n).
We should notice that the following ingenious constraints containing linear
combinations of these variables actually play a role in yielding stacking base
pairs:

xf_1+(1—xf)+xf+1 :1 (1<Vi<n), (11)
xl-r_1+(l —xl-r)+xl-r+131 (1<Vi<n). (12)

These constraints guarantee that if a base a,- is paired with another one,
the base(s) adjacent to a,- must also form a base pair (Fig. 5). The rest of the
variable deﬁnitions with respect to the sequence b and interaction part, and
related constraints, are similarly represented in the IP formulation.

3.2 Data

In our experiments, we used two datasets of RNA—RNA interactions.
The ﬁrst set comprises ﬁve pairs of RNA sequences with their joint
secondary structures including kissing hairpins, which was used
by Kato et al. (2009). We made use of this set to evaluate the
performance of joint secondary structure prediction. The second set
contains 18 sRNA—target pairs with their binding sites, which was
used by Busch et al. (2008). All of the two datasets (i.e. 23 pairs of
interacting RNAs) were used to assess the performance of binding
site prediction.

3.3 Joint structure prediction

We ﬁrst conducted experiments in joint secondary structure
prediction on the dataset compiled by Kato et al. (2009). The
performance was evaluated by sensitivity and positive predictive
value (PPV) deﬁned as follows:

V TP
TP+FN’ T TP—I—FP’
where TP is the number of correctly predicted base pairs, FN is the
number of base pairs in the true structure that were not predicted,
and FP is the number of incorrectly predicted base pairs. We also
used F —measure as the balanced measure between sensitivity and
PPV, which is deﬁned as the harmonic mean of them:

sensitivity 2

_ 2 X sensitivity >< PPV
_ sensitivity + PPV

 

We compared our method RactIP with two state—of—the—art
methods: inRNAs (the exact model for joint structure prediction)
(Salari et al., 2010a) and inteRNA (Alkan et al., 2006).
The accuracy of inRNAs is extracted from their literature. In
order to calculate the accuracy of int eRNA, we computed
the joint structure of each pair in the dataset by using the
inteRNA Web server with default settings (Aksay et al., 2007)
(http://compbio.cs.sfu.ca/taverna/interna/).

Table 1 shows the results of joint structure prediction using our
approach and two existing methods. As can be seen, RactIP
outperforms inteRNA and is comparable to inRNAs. It should
be noted that computation time of RactIP includes both the pre—
processing step to calculate posterior pairing probabilities and the
one to solve the IP problem. We did not compare the running
time strictly between the three methods due to difﬁculty in their
availability. However, we would like to remark that Salari et al.
(2010a) reported in their literature that inRNAs runs for ~4000 s
on Sun Fire X4600 2.6GHz with 64 GB memory to predict the
joint structures of CopA—CopT and IncRNA54—RepZ. Meanwhile,
RactIP consumes only 0.13s and 0.10s to predict the joint
structures of CopA—CopT and IncRNA54—RepZ, respectively, on
Mac OS X 10.6 running on Intel Core 2 Duo 2.13 GHz with 2GB
memory.

3.4 Binding site prediction

In the second experiment, we assessed the performance of predicting
binding sites on the dataset reported by Kato et al. (2009) and Busch
et al. (2008). The accuracy was measured by sensitivity, PPV and
F —measure such that only external base pairs are considered. Table 2
shows the results of prediction by our program RactIP, inRNAs
(the heuristic model for binding site prediction) (Salari et al., 2010a)
extracted from their literature, and IntaRNA (Busch et al., 2008)
with default settings, indicating that our method is more accurate
or comparable as compared with the existing methods. It is worth
noting that RactIP has no restriction on the number of accessible
regions to predict, whereas IntaRNA and inRNAs can consider
only one or two accessible regions that are putative binding sites.

3.5 Time and accuracy trade-off by approximation

To conﬁrm the effectiveness of approximating the joint posterior
distribution by its factorization, we compared running time and

The 23 RNA—RNA interaction pairs were predicted by RactIP, inRNAs (the binding site prediction model) (Salari et al., 2010a) and IntaRNA (Busch et al., 2008). We set the
parameters for RactIP as a=0.5, 65 :03 and 6;, :05. Running time of RactIP and IntaRNA was measured on Mac OS X 10.6 running on Intel Core 2 Duo 2.13 GHz with
2 GB memory. Computation time of inRNAs measured on Intel Core 2 Duo 2.53 GHz with 4 GB memory was given by R. Salari (personal communication).

The four RNA—RNA interaction pairs were predicted by RactIP, rip (Huang et al., 2009, 2010) and RactIP with base-pairing probabilities calculated by rip (rip+RactIP).
We set the parameters for RactIP as a=0.5, 65 :05 and 6;, :02. Running time of RactIP was measured on Mac OS X 10.6 running on Intel Core 2 Duo 2.13 GHz with 2 GB
memory. Computation time of rip was measured on linux kernel 2.6.30 running on Intel Xeon 3.33 GHz with 32 GB memory.

prediction accuracy of the factorized model that we proposed with
those of the naive model by rip (Huang et al., 2009, 2010). rip
calculates exact base—pairing probabilities of internal base pairs and
external base pairs by taking 0(n6) time and 0(n4) space where
n is the length of the longer sequence. We compared RactIP
with rip, which samples joint structures from internal and external
base—pairing probabilities, and RactIP combined with rip, in
which internal and external base—pairing probabilities calculated by
rip were used in the IP [see Equation (5)] instead of factorized
ones. Note that rip failed to calculate base—pairing probabilities
for the CopA—CopT pair since their length might be too long for
rip. As shown in Table 3, our approximation by factorization

is signiﬁcantly faster than the naive calculation of base—pairing
probabilities, though the accuracy of our approximation dropped
slightly. The results indicate that our method can be applicable to
joint secondary structure prediction for long sequences.

4 DISCUSSION

We employed the threshold cut technique to reduce the search space
for the optimal joint secondary structure, which makes RactIP
run much faster than existing state—of—the—art algorithms for joint
structure prediction. Let us stress again that there is a close relation
between the threshold cut and maximizing expected accuracy.

The scoring scheme of RactIP can be regarded as the generalized
centroid estimator (Hamada et al., 2009) since the gain function (1)
with ys = yh and 0t=1 corresponds to the y—centroid estimator. As
described in Section 2.1, the thresholds correspond to the weights
for base pairs in Equation (1), which control the balance between the
expected number of true positives and that of true negatives. This
means that an appropriate choice of the thresholds will improve the
balanced accuracy such as F —measure. See Supplementary Material
for more details.

In the experiments, we used the combination of the parameters
derived from the machine—learning model and the ones from the
thermodynamic model to implement the scores of the RactIP
objective function. It is possible to adopt such a hybrid scoring
scheme due to the factorization of the posterior probability of
a joint structure shown in Equation (3). In fact, prediction
accuracy decreased when adopting the identical scoring scheme
(e.g. the CONTRAf old model is used to derive both base—
pairing probabilities and hybridization probabilities). The main
reason will be that the machine—learning model (CONTRAf old)
specializes in predicting internal secondary structures, whereas the
thermodynamic model (RNAdupleX) aims at predicting hybridized
structures. Therefore, the approximation enables us to select good
models separately and integrate them into the prediction model.

The results shown in Table 2 tell us that RactIP performs
worse than inRNAs and is not signiﬁcantly better than IntaRNA
on CopA—CopT and OxyS—fhlA pairs with two binding sites. One
reason is that lack of interaction data with multiple binding sites
makes our method fail to optimize appropriately. Nevertheless,
we would like to emphasize again that RactIP can deal with
complex interactions with more than one binding site in the
framework of the integer programming formulation. As our future
work, optimizing hybridization scores appropriately is necessary to
improve prediction performance on the data with multiple binding
Sites.

5 CONCLUSION

We proposed RactIP, a novel method for predicting RNA—
RNA interaction of general type using IP In our approach, the
threshold cut technique was adopted to reduce the complexity of the
solution space of the IP problem, which also leads to maximizing
expected accuracy. Experimental results on real interaction data
demonstrated that prediction accuracy of RactIP is at least
comparable to that of several state—of—the—art methods for joint
structure prediction and binding site prediction. Although it is
difﬁcult to evaluate theoretically the time complexity of our IP—
based approach, experimental validations revealed that RactIP
can run much faster than competitive methods for predicting
joint secondary structures. This is an important fact to stress
since RactIP is expected to improve prediction performance in
unknown target search in long genomes by predicting respective
intramolecular structures as well as intermolecular binding sites
in practical time. For this purpose, we should also show that
RactIP can discriminate between targets and non—targets, which
is left as our future work. RactIP not only achieved success
in RNA—RNA interaction prediction but also showed further
possibility of applying the fast IP—based method with threshold cut
to other biologically important problems, which are worthwhile and
challenging tasks.

1 Introduction

The genome—wide association study (GWAS) is a commonly used
study design for the identification of genetic variants that inﬂuence
complex traits. In this type of study, millions of genetic variants are
genotyped on thousands to millions of individuals, and each variant
is tested to see whether an individual’s genotype is predictive of their
phenotypes. Because of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the genome
(Pritchard and Przeworski, 2001), a single genetic variant with a
causal effect on the phenotype leads to multiple statistical (but non—
causal) associations at nearby variants. One initial analysis goal in a
GWAS is to count the number of independent association signals in
the genome while accounting for LD.

The most commonly used approach to counting independent sin—
gle—nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence a trait is to
count ‘peaks’ of association signals—this can be done manually
when the number of peaks is small (e.g. Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium 2007) or in a semi—automated way when the
number of peaks is larger (e.g. Jostins et al. 2012). There are also
fully automated methods that use LD patterns estimated from large
reference panels of individuals (Yang et 61]., 2012). In some contexts
(e.g. when performing identical analysis on multiple GWAS with the
goal of comparing phenotypes), it is useful to define approximately
independent LD blocks a priori rather than letting them vary across
analyses performed on different phenotypes (Loh et 61]., 2015;
Pickrell, 2014).

To define approximately independent LD blocks, Loh et al.
(2015) used non—overlapping segments of 1 megabase, and Pickrell
(2014) used non—overlapping segments of 5000 SNPs. The break—
points of these segments undoubtedly sometimes fall in regions of
strong LD, thus potentially splitting a single association signal over
two blocks (and leading to over—counting of the number of associ—
ated variants). A better approximation could be obtained by con—
sidering the empirical patterns of LD in a reference panel (e.g.
Anderson and Novembre 2003; Greenspan and Geiger 2004;
Mannila et al. 2003). In the remainder of this article, we present an
efficient signal processing—based heuristic for choosing approximate
segment boundaries.

2 Approach and results

To estimate LD between pairs of SNPs, we use the 1'2 metric. If a
genetic variant is in LD with another genetic variant that has a
causal influence on disease, then 1'2 (times the strength of association
at the causal SNP) is proportional to the association statistic at the
non—causal SNP (Pritchard and Przeworski, 2001). For our pur-
poses, we define two sets of SNPs as ‘approximately independent’ if
the pairwise 1'2 between SNPs in different sets is close to zero.

Our approach is a heuristic for choosing segment boundaries,
given a mean segment size (which is the required input). Let there be
11 genetic variants on a chromosome. The method can be broken

GWAS hits with partially filtered vector Vand comparison of breakpoints

down into the following basic steps (see the Supplementary Material
for details):

1. Calculate the n X n covariance matrix C for all pairs of SNPs
using the shrinkage estimator of C from Wen and Stephens
(2010).

2. Convert the covariance matrix to nxn matrix of squared
Pearson product—moment correlation coefﬁcients P.

3. Convert the matrix P = (6177') to a (2n — 1)—dimensional vector V
: (11k) as follows:

k 6,7,,  
12,, = 227,111, t,,- = , (k = 1,2, ...,2n — 1)
i=1 0, otherwise

The effect of this step is representing each antidiagonal of P by
the sum of its elements (Fig. 1a and b). This step has similarities to
Bulik-Sullivan et al. (2015), where the authors represent each col-
umn by the sum of its elements. The method presented in this article
uses the antidiagonal to differentiate between neighboring blocks of
similar size.

4. Apply low-pass ﬁlters of increasing widths to (i.e. ‘smoot/o’) V
until the requested number of minima is achieved.

5. Perform a local search in the proximity of each minimum from
Step 4 to ﬁne tune the segment boundaries.

In reality, matrix P turns out to be sparse, approximately banded
and approximately block—diagonal, with sporadically overlapping
blocks (Slatkin, 2008; Wall and Pritchard, 2003; Wen and Stephens,
2010).

To provide intuition for Step 3, Figure 1a shows a simplified ex-
ample of a correlation matrix P, where two SNPs i and j are either
correlated (represented by 1 in element 6,,- of the matrix) or uncorre-
lated (represented by zero, not shown). Representing each antidiago-
nal of P by the sum of its elements results in the vector shown in
Figure 1b and identifying segments representing blocks of LD re—
duces to identifying local (or more stringently, global) minima in
this vector. In reality, the elements 6,,- of P are continuous values
from the interval [0, 1] and result in an extremely noisy vector V (ex—
ample in blue in Fig. 1c) Therefore, to identify large—scale trends of
LD and reduce high frequency components in the signal, we apply a

signal processing technique dubbed low—pass filtering [utilizing a
Hann window (Blackman and Tukey, 1958)] in Step 4. The result of
applying a low—pass filter (with width=100) is shown in red in
Figure 1c.

Applying wider and wider filters to vector V in Step 4 allows us
to focus on the large scale structure of LD blocks but also causes the
approach to miss small scale variation around identified minima. To
counteract this effect, Step 5 conducts a local search in the proximity
of each local minimum identified in Step 4 to find the closest SNP l
with minZKl 27>, 61,-.

We applied this method to sequencing data from European,
African and East Asian populations in the 1000 Genomes Phase 1
dataset. We set a mean block size of 10 000 SNPs and used the algo—
rithm to define the block boundaries. As expected, these boundaries
fall in regions with considerably higher recombination rates than the
genome—wide average (Supplementary Fig. S4). In Figure 1d, we
show an example from GWAS results for Crohn’s disease (Jostins et
al., 2012) where using uniformly distributed breakpoints would re—
sult in double—counting of an association signal, whereas the LD-
aware breakpoints avoid stretches of SNPs in LD.

To test whether this approach is useful more generally, we ran
fgwas (Pickrell, 2014) on GWAS of Crohn’s disease (Jostins et 61].,
2012) and height (Wood et 61]., 2014), using both uniformly distrib—
uted breakpoints and LD—aware breakpoints. Using the LD—aware
breakpoints successfully eliminated double—counting of SNPs in
moderate—to—high LD and on opposite sides of uniform breakpoints
(Supplementary Material Section S6).

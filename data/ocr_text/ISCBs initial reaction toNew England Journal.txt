Editorial

ISCB's initial reaction to New England Journal of Medicine editorial on

data sharing

The recent editorial by Dr Longo and Dr Drazen in the New
England journal of Medicine (Longo and Drazen, 2016) has stirred
up quite a bit of controversy. As Executive Officers of the
International Society of Computational Biology, Inc. (ISCB), we ex-
press our deep concern about the restrictive and potentially damag-
ing opinions voiced in this editorial, and while ISCB works to write
a detailed response, we felt it necessary to promptly address the edi-
torial with this reaction. Although some of the concerns voiced by
the authors of the editorial are worth considering, large parts of the
statement purport an obsolete view of hegemony over data that is
neither in line with today’s spirit of open access nor furthering an at-
mosphere where the potential of data can be fully realized.

ISCB acknowledges that the additional comment on the editorial
(Drazen, 2016) eases some of the polemics unfortunately without
addressing some of the core issues. We still feel, however, that we
need to contrast the opinion voiced in the editorial with what we
consider the axioms of our scientific society, statements that lead
into a fruitful future of data-driven science:

i. Data produced with public money should be public in beneﬁt of
the science and society
ii. Restrictions on the use of public data hamper science and slow
progress
iii. Open data is the best way to combat fraud and
misinterpretations

Current large data collections proceed from many sources, are
continually accumulated, and require a variety of analytical
approaches. Data generation and data analysis overlap in time and
are continually updated with new data sets produced by new tech-
niques and new analysis methodologies. Furthermore, in many cases
current science functions in consortia in which scientists collaborate
toward common goals while preserving their own scientific object-
ives. Dividing scientists into data providers and data analysts is

simplistic and gives a misleading impression of the actual state of
biological and biomedical science.

ISCB very much supports collaboration between disciplines,
including experimental and clinical as well as bioinformatics, as the
best way forward to address complex biological problems. But this
collaboration cannot be based on imposed restrictions to data access
and cannot be contained in professional silos. (The use of expres-
sions such as ‘research parasites’ clearly does not help.)

Many bio-communities have made significant progress by
endorsing open data policies and, gratefully, public funding agencies
have connected to the spirit that they are distributing taxpayers’
money to science and that, therefore, the data that are generated in
the course belong to the public. It is, perhaps, natural that some
areas of biomedical research are slow in adopting these policies.
History and the confidential nature of the relevant data are surely
among the reasons. However, in our opinion data hegemony is an-
other, a reason that has to be overcome. The sooner these barriers to
progress are removed the sooner the patients will benefit from the
current flourishing of biomedical research.

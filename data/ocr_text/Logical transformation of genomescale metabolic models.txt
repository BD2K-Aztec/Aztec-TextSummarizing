Abstract

Motivation: In recent years, genome—scale metabolic models (GEMS) have played important roleS
in areas like systems biology and bioinformatics. However, because of the complexity of gene—
reaction associations, GEMS often have limitations in gene level analysis and related applications.
Hence, the existing methods were mainly focused on applications and analysis of reactions and
metabolites.

Results: Here, we propose a framework named logic transformation of model (LTM) that is able
to simplify the gene—reaction associations and enables integration with other developed methods
for gene level applications. We show that the transformed GEMS have increased reaction and
metabolite number aS well aS degree of freedom in flux balance analySiS, but the gene—reaction
associations and the main features of flux distributions remain constant. In addition, we develop
two methods, OptGeneKnock and FastGeneSL by combining LTM with previously developed
reaction—based methods. We Show that the FastGeneSL outperforms exhaustive search. Finally, we
demonstrate the use of the developed methods in two different case studies. We could deSign fast
genetic intervention strategies for targeted overproduction of biochemicaIS and identify double
and triple synthetic lethal gene setS for inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma tumor growth
through the use of OptGeneKnock and FastGeneSL, respectively.

throughput experimental data (Chandrasekaran and Price, 2010;
Hamilton et 61]., 2013; Hoppe et 61]., 2007) and provide new biolo—
gical insight into the physiology of different microorganisms
(Feist and Palsson, 2010; Harrison et 61]., 2007; Reznik et 61]., 2013;
Segre et 61]., 2005; Suthers et 61]., 2009; Tepper et 61]., 2013). More
recently, human GEMs have been employed to identify novel prog—
nostic biomarkers and potential drug targets for designing efficient
treatment strategies (Agren et 61]., 2014; Barabasi et 61]., 2011;
Jerby-Arnon et 61]., 2014; Ji and Nielsen, 2015; Mardinoglu et 61].,
2013a, b; Mardinoglu and Nielsen, 2012, 2015; Nam et 61]., 2014;
Ryan et 61]., 2014; Yizhak et 61]., 2014).

Although GEMs are widely used, their uses have some limita—
tions in genetic related applications. A number of bi—level linear pro-
gramming methods have been developed for in silico metabolic
engineering, such as OptKnock (Burgard et 61]., 2003), OptReg
(Pharkya and Maranas, 2006), OptForce (Ranganathan et 61].,
2010), Genetic Design through Local Search (GDLS) (Lun et 61].,
2009) and Genetic Design through Branch and Bound (GDBB)
(Egen and Lun, 2012) and these methods have only identified poten—
tial targeted reactions (knockouts or up/down regulations) rather
than targeted genes which can be modified in vivo. Moreover, these
reaction—based methods did not consider the genetic interactions in
the context of protein complexes and isoenzymes, which result in
strategies genetically complicated or infeasible. Recently, another
bilevel—based method, OptORF (Kim and Reed, 2010), was de—
veloped for identifying metabolic and regulatory gene that are tar—
gets for knockout or upregulation which may lead to
overproduction of desired chemicals. OptORF employed a three—di—
mensional gene—enzyme reaction array to enable gene level predic—
tion. Nevertheless, this array needs to be systematically defined by
the user for each model, which restrict the widely use of OptORF in
strain design. On the other hand, OptGene and its derived algo—
rithms (Chong et 61]., 2014; Choon et 61]., 2014; Patil et 61]., 2005),
could identify gene knockout strategies. However, these methods
are based on Genetic Algorithm, which is basically random muta-
tion and would probably miss the optimal solution.

Moreover, synthetic lethality (SL) analysis, which identifies
combinations of mutations in two or more genes leading to cell le—
thality in silico, could be applied for identification of small hairpin
RNA (shRNA) (Bernards et 61]., 2006) and CRISPR (Cho et 61].,
2013) targets for cancer treatment. However, the huge computa—
tional cost of triple or higher level SL makes it infeasible for its use
in biotechnology applications. There were two methods developed
for efficient identification of synthetic lethal reactions (Pratapa
et 61]., 2014; Suthers et 61]., 2009). But when it comes to synthetic
lethal genes analysis, one of them becomes unavailable, while the
other one requires manual identification of ‘appropriate equations’
relating binary variables of genes and reactions, which is time
consuming.

This gene level application problem originates from the gene——
protein relations (GPRs) information loss in the gene—reaction
association matrix (GRAM). The GRAM is a predefined binary ma-
trix in GEMs, whose ijth elements is 1 if ith reaction is associated
with jth gene and is 0 otherwise. GRAM is the only mathematically
friendly part for most of the existing methods to capture the GPRs
information. However, GRAM does not include any information of
the relationship among gene sets. For example, one cannot know
whether a reaction is associated with a protein complex (AND rela-
tionship in gene set) or with isoenzymes (OR relationship in gene
set) directly from GRAM. Therefore, in order to correctly integrate
GPRs information into the simulation algorithms, one needs to
interpret the information into mathematical expressions, which is

time—consuming and tedious, and sometimes it may even be ex—
tremely difficult to reconstruct the correct relationship.

Here, we introduced a GEM modification algorithm, called logic
transformation of model (LTM), which extended the original GEM
into a logically equivalent with much better genetic applicability.
In this algorithm, pseudo reactions and metabolites were added
into the GEM based on the GPR relationships described in GEMs to
simulate the isoenzyme and protein complex relationships. Hereby
reactions are associated with no more than one gene. Therefore,
GPRs information was included in the stoichiometric matrix of
GEM, and we can directly apply GRAM to all kind of optimiza-
tion programming algorithms, such as OptKnock, OptReg and
OptForce. Furthermore, LTM could extend the use of previously
well designed methods that were only developed for reaction simula—
tions in gene level applications. We developed OptGeneKnock,
which incorporated LTM with a bilevel mixed integer linear pro-
gramming (MILP)-based knockout method. The MILP problem was
then solved by truncated branch and bound, to obtain near optimal
gene knockout strategies with desired phenotype. In addition, by
incorporating LTM with a previous method (Pratapa et 61]., 2014),
which was developed for efficient identification of reaction SL, a
new method called FastGeneSL was designed for genetic SL analysis.
We showed that FastGeneSL greatly outperformed exhaustive
analysis in gene SL analysis for GEMs of Escherichia coli,
Saccloaromyces cerevisiae and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Finally, we performed two case studies for demonstrating the
capability of the here presented methods. First, we identified gene
targets that may increase the production of desired biochemicals by
designing fast genetic intervention strategies by OptGeneKnock
using two different GEMs of E.coli. Second, we employed
FastGeneSL together with a HCC GEM for gaining biological in-
sight into underlying molecular mechanism of HCC and identifying
potential shRNA targets which may inhibit tumor growth.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Logic transformation of model

Reaction associated with more than two genes were extended into
a subnetwork which is a logic equivalent based on its original GPR
relationship through the use of LTM. The relationship among genes
in gene sets controlling the same reaction were divided into two
groups, protein complexes and isoenzymes. For example, if a reac—
tion is associated with gene A and gene B, (A and B) means that
both genes are needed to catalyze the reaction, while (A or B) means
that either of these genes can catalyze the reaction and the associated
reaction can only be blocked when both genes are deleted. Pseudo
metabolites and reactions which do not exist in reality were added
into the GEM to simulate the logical relationships of reactions and
their gene sets. In case of (A and B), the reaction was separated into
two pseudo reactions associated with gene A and gene B, respect—
ively (the lower left of Fig. 1). And to keep the original ﬂux bounds,
the ﬂux bounds are set the same as the original reaction. While in
case of (A or B), the reaction was split into two equivalent pathways
which are associated with genes A and B separately, and additional
arm reactions were added to control the overall flux (top right of
Fig. 1). The arm reactions were set the same upper (UBoriginal) and
lower (LBoriginal) bounds with the original reaction, while the
bounds of reactions inside the pseudo network were set differently.
If UBoriginal > 0 and LBoriginal > 0, then for all inner pseudo reactions,
UB=UBoriginah LB=0; if UBoriginal< 0 and LBorigina1< 0, then
UB = 0, LB 2 LBO,,g,nal; otherwise, UB = UBoﬂginal, LB 2 LBoﬂgmal.

marked as ‘R1' to ‘R5', and each has an arrow indicating the direction. ‘g1’ to
‘g7’ were genes. ‘ARx-y', ‘PRx-y' and ‘Mx-y’ denote the yth arm reaction,
pseudo reaction and pseudo metabolite of reaction ‘RX', respectively

By setting reaction bounds as above, all kinds of in silico genetic ma—
nipulation (up/down regulation and knockout) would have the same
effect as in the original GEM. For more complex gene sets, this prin-
ciple can also be applied step by step (Supplementary Fig. S1).
However, in order to reduce the number of redundant pseudo reac—
tions, arm reactions were only added to both side of the overall net—
work (the lower right of Fig. 1). This kind of transformation
decomposed reactions with comprehensive GPRs into several
pseudo reactions. Thus, all reactions that are associated with more
than one gene in the GEM were broken down into pseudo reactions
associated with at most one gene.

In order to further elucidate how LTM simplifies the GRAM, we
illustrated the principles of LTM using a toy model (Fig. 2). This toy
model included four exchange reactions and five intracellular reac—
tions. Three intracellular reactions were associated with more
than one gene, and other two were associated with only one gene.
After applying LTM, reactions without gene association (exchange
reactions) and associated with only one gene were kept the same
and other reactions were replaced with an extended subnetwork
according to their GPR associations.

Fig. 3. Comparison between GRAMS of toy model before and after LTM.
In vectors of gene or reaction knockouts, if ‘g1’ or ‘R1' is knocked out, the
corresponding binary variable is 1; otherwise, it is 0

In the extended model, all reactions were associated with no
more than 1 gene. Therefore, the GRAM of the extended model be—
came simple and easy to use for gene target identification. For
example, if ‘g1’ and ‘g3’ were knocked out, the binary reaction
knockout vector could be easily obtained by multiplying GRAM
with a binary gene knockout vector. It should be noticed that, incor—
rect results could be obtained if the same principle is applied to the
original GRAM (Fig. 3).

2.2 OptGeneKnock

We developed OptGeneKnock by applying LTM to previously de—
veloped OptKnock (Burgard et al., 2003). Before the implementa—
tion of OptGeneKnock, GEMs were extended by LTM to obtain the
simplified GRAM. After that, an m’ile binary matrix G, which
stands for the new GRAM, was obtained. In this matrix, Gik is 1 if
the ith reaction was associated with lath gene; otherwise, Gik is 0
(Fig. 3). Therefore, the problem of searching the best gene knockout
strategy was converted into a single—level MILP problem that similar
to a previously published study (Egen and Lun, 2012):

for the ﬂux of the ith reaction; x is the binary gene knockout vector,

whose lath element is 1 if the lath is mutated and is 0 otherwise; C is
the maximum number of genes that are allowed to be knocked out;

S is the m’in stoichiometric matrix; or, ﬂ are the upper and lower
bound vectors, whose ith element records the upper and lower
bound of flux through the ith reaction, respectively; f is the biolo—
gical objective vector, whose ith element is the weight of the ith reac—
tion in biological objective; 2 is the dual variable for the equality
constraints; ,u and z/ are the dual variables for the lower and upper
bounds, respectively; 5 is the dual variable corresponding to the con—
straint 12,-: 0 if xi: 1 and D is a scalar which is set to 100. In this
MILP problem, the gene knockout vector, x, was easily converted to
a reaction blocking vector, y, by simply multiplying with the G ma-
trix. The problem was then solved by the truncated branch and
bound algorithm from a previous study (Egen and Lun, 2012).

2.3 FastGeneSL

We developed FastGeneSL which accelerates the identification of
synthetic lethal genes by prescreening the gene candidates by apply—
ing LTM to FastSL (Pratapa et al., 2014; Suthers et al., 2009). First,
we extended the GEM by LTM to simplify the GPR relationships.
As a result, we could easily find genes from reaction sets. Then, the
principle of FastSL is applied. The biological objective was opti—
mized, and the ﬂux distribution was obtained. Here, reactions carry—
ing non-zero ﬂuxes, Rf, were selected, and then genes associated to
these reactions, Gf, were also screened. It should be noted that, all
essential genes were included in Gf. Therefore, it was possible to
perform exhaustive gene single mutations within Gf and calculate
the flux distributions for each mutant. As a result, Gf was divided
into two parts, Gfo, if the ﬂux to biological objective is below cutoff
(set to 5% of maximum in this study), and Gf1, otherwise. Thus,
Gfo is the essential gene group, and Gf1 is the candidate group for
double gene SL analysis. In double gene SL analysis, the ﬂux distri-
butions with single mutation within Gf1 were selected one at a time.
Similar to the previous process, Gfo’ and Gf1’ were screened for
every mutant. Consequently, all the synthetic lethal gene pairs were
identified by combining each Gfo’ with the selected gene in Gf1. As
described, triple, tetra and high—order synthetic lethal gene sets can
be obtained in the same way.

2.4 Models and SimulationS

An E.coli core metabolic model (Orth et al., 2010) was used as a
platform for demonstrating the basic feature of the LTM. In add—
ition, GEMs of E.coli, iAF1260 (Feist et al., 2007), and S.cerez/isiae,
Yeast 7.11 (Aung et al., 2013), which are manually reconstructed
and commonly used models, were directly employed for knockout
simulation and genetic SL analysis, respectively. In the case of
microaerobic succinate production in E.coli GEM iAF1260, the glu—
cose uptake was set to 10 mmol/(gDW"' h), and the OZ intake was set
to 5 mmol/(gDW"' h). For comparison with OptORF, we also em—
ployed a updated E.coli GEM from iJR904 (Reed et al., 2003) to
simulate ethanol production under anaerobic condition, and the up—
take of glucose and OZ were set to 18.5 mmol/(gDW"' h) and
0mmol/(gDW"' h), respectively. In addition, genes encoding ATP
synthase were excluded from knockout so that all conditions were
consistent with the original study (Kim and Reed, 2010). For the
shRNA targets identification, a generic human HCC, liver cancer
GEM was used (Agren et al., 2014). However, since there are a lot
of gene sets with unknown gene—reaction relationships (isoenzymes
or protein complex), in order to get more reliable results, all these
relationships were treated as ‘or’ in HCC GEM to make it a stronger
case against shRNA. We also performed toxicity test for the identi—
fied targets through the use of GEM for healthy hepatocytes within
liver tissue, iHepatocytes2322 (Mardinoglu et al., 2014) and tested

if the identified targets disrupt the biological tasks known to occur
in normal human liver tissue. These 256 metabolic tasks were
defined based on the known biological functions of the healthy
hepatocytes (Mardinoglu et al., 2014).

In this study, Matlab (version 8.0.0.783 (R2012b)) incorporated
with COBRA Toolbox 2.0 (Schellenberger et al., 2011) as well
as RAVEN Toolbox (Agren et al., 2013) was employed for GEM op—
eration and analysis. Flux balance analysis (FBA) which assumes that
the metabolic network is a pseudo steady—state system was used for
ﬂux calculation. The Gurobi solver (version 5.6.3, academic) and
Mosek solver (version 6) were used to solve all the optimizing prob-
lems. All procedures were implemented on a personal computer with
3.00 GHz Intel(R) Core(TM) i7—3540M CPU and 8.00 GB RAM.

3 Results

3.1 Comparison between original model and the
extended logic model

To illustrate the effect of LTM in the model content, we made direct
comparison between the original model and the extended logic
model in several aspects.

First, we compared the number of reactions, metabolites and
genes in five models used in this study before and after applying
LTM. As shown in Table 1, the numbers of reactions and metabol—
ites were increased around 2— to 5—fold, while the number of genes
was kept constant as expected. The explanation to this difference in
fold changes of numbers of reactions and metabolites among differ—
ent GEMs was that the models have different prevalence of protein
complexes and isoenzymes reactions (Supplementary Table S1).
LTM only works on reactions controlled by genes, thus reactions
with more complex gene associations will be extended more.
It should be noticed that, HCC GEM and iHepatocytes2322 had
more significant size increase compared with models of microorgan—
isms, which could be explained by the superior complexity of human
GPRs. However, the size of HCC GEM was still larger than the
iHepatocytes2322 despite the small gene and original reaction num-
bers which is caused by the different way of GPRs interpretation.

Second, differences in FBA performance between the original
and extended models were observed. We did singular value decom—
position (SVD) to the E.coli core model and its extended version and
the singular values were ranked (Fig. 4). It has been shown that the
extended model had bigger singular values, which implies a higher
degree of freedom in the solution space. Explanation to this is that
the split of isoenzyme associated reactions, which offered alternative

changed reactions (as shown in Fig. 5).

At last, the GPRs of the extended model were validated by
double gene deletion analysis. Growth rate of all combinatory
knockouts of two genes were calculated for both models, and the
result of extended model was exactly the same as that of the original
model (Supplementary Fig. S2), which clearly showed that GPRs
between both models are equivalents.

Therefore, as described above, it was concluded that LTM
increases the number of reactions and metabolites, but it kept the major
characteristics of ﬂux distribution and GPRs of the original model.

method, named OptGeneKnock, by straightforwardly integrating
LTM with a previous method (Egen and Lun, 2012). The previous
one could only deal with predictions of gene set knockouts, which is
actually discovered by reaction knockouts. Searching for the optimal
knockout strategies of reactions (gene sets) and individual genes are
two independent questions (Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition,
only reactions with exactly the same gene sets were simultaneously
blocked, which means that the comprehensive GPRs were not
correctly captured. However, when using OptGeneKnock, these
problems are solved since reactions are only associated with no
more than one gene. Therefore, the in silico gene knockouts can be
performed by solving the MILP problem with truncated branch and
bound.

Using the extended logical model of E.coli, we have identified
gene knock—out strategies (one to five knockouts) for anaerobic etha—
nol and microaerobic succinate overproduction with OptGeneKnock
(Table 2). Unlike most of the previous methods (OptKnock et al.), the
strategies obtained by OptGeneKnock were all actual gene targets,
which are user friendly for in vivo validation. Interestingly, the single
deletion of [mtB (encoding pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase beta
subunit) will significantly improve the production of ethanol. In
E.coli, [mtA and [mtB encode the alpha and beta subunit of mem—
brane—bound pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase, which couples the
reversible reduction of NADP by NADH. Thus, pntA and pntB in-
volve in two reactions: NADTRHD and THD2. While stloA encodes
a soluble pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase by the oxidation of
NADPH. Therefore, the deletion of [mtB will only block the reaction
THD2, and lead to the overproduction of ethanol (Table 2). In the
case of double deletion, both focA and focB encode the formate trans—
porters. The deletion of focA and focB will block reaction FORt, and
thus block the transport of formate into cytosol. The best single and
double gene knock—out strategies for ethanol production both resulted
in blocking of one reactions, and this clearly showed the difference be—
tween reaction and gene level mutation. In addition, the optimal 5
gene knockout strategy for succinate overproduction obtained re—
sulted in simultaneous blocking of 20 reactions, which is quite diffi-
cult to be predicted by other reaction—based methods. Mutations of
ptsI, pyleA and [)ku cut off all direct transformation from PEP to
pyruvate, which shifted the ﬂux from pyruvate to the tricarboxylic

acid (TCA) cycle and hereby enhanced the production of succinate.
On the other hand, knockouts of focA and focB blocked the ﬂux to
formate as byproduct. Since formate is not a common byproduct of
E.coli, the knockout of these two genes may be less important than
the others. This complex gene knock strategies obtained by
OptGeneKnock further proved that the optimal gene—level knockouts
are not limited by the number of reactions affected.

In addition, the results highlighted the great efficiency of
OptGeneKnock. Most of the strategies were obtained within
minutes, and none of them exceeded 1 h. In addition, our ethanol—
producing strategies could result in better solutions (even global
optimal solutions for levels 1—level 3) in all conditions in com-
parison to those obtained by OptORF without regulation
(Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, we concluded that
OptGeneKnock had less computational cost and found better solu—
tions. Thus, the development of OptGeneKnock gave a successful
example showing that LTM could extend previously developed
reaction—based bilevel MILP method to gene level applications.

3.3 Comparison between FastGeneSL and

exhaustive search

We also developed a method called FastGeneSL for efficient gene SL
analysis by combining LTM with FastSL which is a previous reac—
tion—based method (Pratapa et al., 2014). GEMs pretreated by LTM
which simplifies the GPRs is a prerequisite for FastGeneSL. Firstly,
we performed both FastGeneSL and an exhaustive search for double
gene SL analysis of iAF1260 and Yeast 7.11. Compared to the
exhaustive algorithm, FastGeneSL was nearly 20 times faster while
obtaining the same results (Supplementary Table S3). In addition,
triple gene SL analysis was implemented by FastGeneSL for both
GEMs as well as GEM for HCC, and the computational costs of ex—
haustive search were calculated (Table 3). FastGeneSL was much
faster than exhaustive search (up to more than 100 times) and thus
enabled triple gene SL analysis for large GEMs. Furthermore,
FastGeneSL showed an increased improvement in both double and
triple SL analysis for Yeast 7.11 (910 genes), iAF1260 (1261 genes)
and HCC GEM (1779 genes), which suggested it can be applied
to more comprehensive models. Therefore, FastGeneSL is another
successful example showing that LTM could extend the use of
existing reaction—based methods to gene level analysis.

3.4 Case study 2: identification of shRNA/CRISPR
targetS for cancer therapy with FastGeneSL

We exhibited the applicability of FastGeneSL in novel shRNA
and CRISPR targets identification. These both techniques are used
in suppression of the expression of genes in biotechnology applica—
tions. Gene SL analysis could help us find potential shRNNCRISPR
targets that can inhibit or kill the growth of the tumor while keep
normal cells alive. In this study, we used HCC GEM for identifying
the shRNNCRISPR targets (Agren et al., 2014) and performed a
toxicity test using healthy hepatocytes model iHepatocytes2322
(Mardinoglu et al., 2014).

Essential genes as well as double and triple synthetic lethal genes
sets were identified by applying LTM and FastGeneSL to HCC
GEM. 67 essential genes as well as 85 double and 175 triple syn—
thetic lethal gene sets were found to inhibit the growth of HCC
tumors. We also performed in silico toxicity test to reveal the effect
of these identified targets in healthy hepatocytes. We found that
34 of the essential genes as well as 44 of double and 95 of triple
synthetic lethal gene sets did not disrupt any of the 256 biological
functions that are known to occur in healthy hepatocytes

and the results were consistent before and after LTM.

(Supplementary Table S4). Hence, we suggested that these identified
targets can be used for designing novel effective cancer treatment
strategies.

The result of gene SL analysis also provided biological insight
into the metabolism of HCC. In cancer cells, glutamine can be con—
verted to citrate via conversions to glutamate, oc—ketoglutarate
and isocitrate which partially reverses the TCA cycle in the process.
This glutamine—derived citrate could then be incorporated in the
fatty acid biosynthesis (FAB) which is an essential pathway for
tumor growth. Through our analysis, we found that the targeting
genes involved in glutaminolysis including glutamate dehydrogen—
ases (GLUD1 and GLUD2), glutamic—oxaloacetic transaminase
(GOT2), glutamic—pyruvate transaminase (GPT1) as well as gluta—
minase (GLS) in synthetic lethal gene sets can be used to inhibit
or kill the growth of HCC tumors.

We identified the citrate synthase (CS), pyruvate carboxylase
(PC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHA2) in synthetic lethal gene
sets as potential targets for inhibition of the HCC tumor growth.
Pyruvate transported into the mitochondria is converted to acetyl—
CoA by PC and PDHA2. Next acetyl—CoA is converted to citrate by
CS and exported to the cytosol where citrate is reconverted to ace—
tyl—CoA. This cytosolic acetyl—CoA can then enter the FAB and thus
serve as a substrate for the production of lipids in HCC. Previously,
it has been shown that fatty acid synthase which overexpressed in
tumor cells is a general feature for tumor cells (Flavin et al., 2010).
There are also mounting evidence to suggest that altered lipid me—
tabolism is a common feature of cancer cells (Zhang and Du, 2012).

FAB requires large amounts of NADPH and the increased activ—
ity of the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway would indeed satisfy the
increased demand for reducing power resulting from induction of
FAB. We identified genes involved in PP pathway including glucose—
6—phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), transaldolase 1 (TALDOl)
and transketolase (TKT) as targets for inhibiting/killing the growth
of HCC tumors.

We also identified the genes involved in fatty acid beta—oxida—
tion, cholesterol biosynthesis, amino acid synthesis and amino acid
transportation that are known to have major roles in the formation
of biomass components as anticancer drug targets. Previously, anti—
cancer drug targets involved in the similar pathways were identified
in HCC tumors (Agren et al., 2014) and our analysis confirmed the
potential use of previously identified targets. In addition, SLC3 8A4
which controls the transportation of amino acids, especially cationic
amino acid was identified as anticancer drug target. This implicated
that HCC tumors had a specific amino acid metabolism that is dif—
ferent from other cancer cells. We observed that the predicted anti—
cancer drug targets for inhibiting/killing the growth of HCC tumors

correctly captured the general feature of HCC through the use of
our method.

4 Discussion

In this article, we developed a method, called LTM, which trans—
forms a GEM to a logically equivalent extended model to enable
gene level applications. The transformation enlarges the size of
GEMs while keeps the correct GPRs, and the FBA results of ex—
tended models are equivalent to the original models despite the
increased degree of freedom.

We showed the applicability of our method in two different bio-
technology applications. We first showed the utility of LTM in opti-
mization frameworks. The optimization frameworks could be easily
applied to genetic solution prediction by incorporating with LTM.
This implicated the wide application of LTM with many well
designed methods such as OptKnock and OptForce (Burgard et al.,
2003; Ranganathan et al., 2010). We developed OptGeneKnock
by combining OptKnock and LTM as well as truncated branch
and bound algorithm, and showed its capability in designing
gene knockout strategies leading to overproduction of desired
biochemical.

In addition, we developed a gene SL analysis method called
FastGeneSL. This method combined LTM and a previous method
FastSL, and enabled efficient genet SL analysis in GEMs for different
organisms. We demonstrated that the efficiency was greatly im—
proved by FastGeneSL and this enable identification of triple SL
genes in GEMs which was previously infeasible. Next, by employing
FastGeneSL, we identified novel anticancer drug targets that can be
used for inhibition of the HCC tumors and performed in silico tox—
icity test for these identified targets. We found the most prominent
distinguishing metabolic features of HCC and observed that here
identified targets can be used in the drug development process for
efficient treatment of HCC tumors.

By the two biotechnology applications tested in this study, we
could conclude that although the principle of LTM is simple, it
greatly benefits gene level analysis and applications. In addition,
many previous methods (e.g. OptKnock and FastSL) could be ex—
tended to gene level applications (e.g. OptGeneKnock and
FastGeneSL) by incorporating with LTM in a straightforward way.

Furthermore, as GPRs are simplified after LTM, complex gene set
controlled reactions are avoided and it becomes very convenient to in—
tegrate different omics data into extended models. Thus, LTM could
also be used together with multiomic data integrating methods like
GIMME and PROM (Becker and Palsson, 2008; Chandrasekaran
and Price, 2010). In total, we could conclude that LTM is a useful
tool which facilitates the application of GEMs and we are therefore
confident that it will find wide use in the community.

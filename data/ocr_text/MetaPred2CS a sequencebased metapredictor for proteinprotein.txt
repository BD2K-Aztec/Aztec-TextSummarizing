Abstract

Motivation: Two—component systems (TCS) are the main signalling pathways of prokaryotes, and
control a wide range of biological phenomena. Their functioning depends on interactions between
TCS proteins, the specificity of which is poorly understood.

Results: The MetaPred2CS web—server interfaces a sequence—based meta—predictor specifically de—
signed to predict pairing of the histidine kinase and response—regulator proteins forming TCSs.
MetaPred2CS integrates six sequence—based methods using a support vector machine classifier
and has been intensively tested under different benchmarking conditions: (i) species specific gene
sets; (ii) neighbouring versus orphan pairs; and (iii) k—fold cross validation on experimentally vali—
dated datasets.

1 Introduction

Two—component systems (TCSs) are the most common signal trans—
duction pathway found in prokaryotes, and they regulate crucial
biological functions such as antibiotic resistance, chemotaxis, sporu—
lation, virulence, stationary phase transition, nitrogen regulation,
competence and phosphate regulation (Whitworth, 2012). TCSs
function via phosphoryl group transfer between a histidine kinase
(HK) and a response regulator (RR) protein. HK-RR pairing is
highly specific and experimental validations are both costly and
lengthy. Here, we present MetaPred2CS, a web—server that inter—
faces a meta—predictor designed to predict interactions between HK
and RR proteins based on six sequence—based prediction methods
(Kara et 61]., 2015). Moreover, users have also access to the source
code distributed on a git—hub repository or as virtual machine to

execute the method on local computers, thus providing full flexibil-
ity with regards to execution parameters, reference datasets, size of
alignments, etc. We also present the prediction at genome—wide scale
of the TCS interactome of Myxococcus xcmt/ous DK1622 as exem-
plar of large—scale applicability of the method.

2 Methods

2.1 Meta—predictor and performance

MetaPred2CS provides an interface with a support vector machine
(Noble, 2006) meta—predictor that integrates six sequence—based pre—
diction methods: four genome context based methods, namely gene
fusion (GF) (Enright et al., 1999), phylogenetic profiling (PP) (Sun
et 61]., 2005), gene neighbourhood (GN) and gene operon methods

The meta—predictor has been extensively benchmarked and tested as

2.2 Implementation

MetaPred2CS webs

erver is implemented using Perl, Perl_CGI and HTML, is installed
on a local cluster and runs on the BioLinux operating system and
uses an Apache2 web—server. This server supports all current web—
browsers and does not require any additional plugins to run. Users
can also opt to install MetaPred2CS locally using the fully docu—
mented source code distributed in a git—hub repository or download—
ing the image of a virtual machine compatible with Virtual Box
(http://virtualbox.org).

2.3 Web server usage

The only requirement to utilize MetaPred2CS is the sequence of two
HK and RR proteins in FASTA format (either by uploading or copy/
pasting the data). Both sequences are initially compared against pre—
computed predictions and scores presented if the given pair is pre-
sent in the local database (Fig. 1, first submission loop). Currently,
MetaPred2CS archives pre—computed predictions for the following
organisms: Escherichia coli K—12 MG1655, Myxococcus xcmthus
DK1622, Erwinia amyloz/om ATCC 49946 and Pseudomonas clem-
ginosa UCBPP-PA14.

If the given pair is not among the pre—calculated predictions,
users are directed to a second submission page (Fig. 1, Second
Submission Loop) for de novo prediction. On this page, users can
adjust parameters to their individual needs if default values are not
suitable. Further information about these parameters and the usage
of MetaPred2CS webserver can be found in the ‘Methods’ and
‘Help’ web pages of the server, respectively. For more ﬂexibility
users can install a local version, see above.

Upon submission, MetaPred2CS generates a unique identifica—
tion code and submission web page that can be used to track pro—
gress and retrieve prediction results (bookmarking the submission
web—page is recommended). The prediction progress is updated in
real time and depending on prediction parameters, the running time

MetaPred2CS web-server. The paths for checking pre-calculated inputs and
for de novo predictions are represented by dotted and solid arrows,
respectively

is approximately 30 min (the most costly computational step is the
search for protein homologs).

Upon completion, a ‘Results’ web page is displayed, with four
different tables. The first three tables describe information on the
submitted files and prediction parameters, e.g. cut—off values for
each individual prediction method and a final table illustrating the
prediction class: —1 and +1 for non—interacting and interacting pairs,
respectively) and score, ranging from 0 to 1. Based on the score, pre—
dictions can be classified as high, medium or low confidence if the
score ranges between 1.0 and 0.7; 0.7 and 0.4; and <04
respectively.

3 The two-component system interactome of
Myxococcus xanthus DK1622

Several interactomes of TCS pathways (including M.xcmthus
DK1622) have been pre—computed and are available via the
MetaPred2CS web—server (see before). The M.xcmthus TCS network
is poorly defined, in part because it has one of the largest comple—
ments among prokaryotes: 138 HK and 136 RR compared to 15
HK and 15 RR in Eamyloz/om and 30 HK and 32 RR in E.coli
(Ortet et al., 2015; Whitworth, 2015) (see supplementary file 1, 2, 3
for complete interactome sequences and prediction scores.) In such
cases, MetaPred2CS can provide useful information on potential
pairings of HKs and RRs, in turn proposing candidate biologically
relevant protein complexes.

MetaPredZCS

 

For instance, MXAN_6979—MXAN_6693(DifD) and MXAN_
6692(DifE)—MXAN_6224 are two of the predicted TCS protein
pairs of M.xanthus. DifD and DifE have a role in fibril
polysaccharide production (Black and Yang, 2004). Even though
the functions of MXAN_6979 and MXAN_6224 are not yet
known, the predicted interactions with DifD/DifE make involve-
ment in motility (and dependant phenomena such as fruiting body
formation) plausible. MXAN_1129(FrgB)-MXAN_6099 and
MXAN_4140(FrzE)-MXAN_6980 are also among the predicted
protein pairs of M.xanthus. FrgB and FrzE regulate fruiting body
formation and vegetative swarming through S motility (Cho et al.,
2000), suggesting that MXAN_6099 and MXAN_6980 may also
regulate motility. Similarly, the predicted novel interaction pair,
MXAN_0733: MXAN_3606(RodK), suggests that like RodK,
MXAN_0733 may take part in the coordination of cellular aggrega—
tion during the early stages of fruiting body formation (Wegener—
Feldbrugge and Sogaard—Andersen, 2009).

4 Conclusion

In this work, we present a web server for prediction of PPIs in pro-
karyotic TCS signalling pathways. Predictions are generated by a
sequence—based meta—predictor, which is interfaced through a freely
available user—friendly web—server (http://metapred2cs.ibers.aber.ac.
uk/). For local use, the source code and installation instruction is
available at: https://github.com/martinjvickers/MetaPred2CS; and a
virtual machine implementing the method at: http://metapred2cs.
ibers.aber.ac.uk/MetaPred2CS.ova. MetaPred2CS also contains pre—
computed predictions for a number of organisms.

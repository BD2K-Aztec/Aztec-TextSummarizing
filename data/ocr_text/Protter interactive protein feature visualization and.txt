ABSTRACT

Summary: The ability to integrate and visualize experimental
proteomic evidence in the context of rich protein feature annotations
represents an unmet need of the proteomics community. Here
we present Protter, a web-based tool that supports interactive
protein data analysis and hypothesis generation by visualizing both
annotated sequence features and experimental proteomic data in
the context of protein topology. Protter supports numerous proteomic
file formats and automatically integrates a variety of reference protein
annotation sources, which can be readily extended via modular plug-
ins. A built-in export function produces publication-quality customized
protein illustrations, also for large datasets. Visualizations of surfa-
ceome datasets show the specific utility of Protter for the integrated
visual analysis of membrane proteins and peptide selection for
targeted proteomics.

Availability and implementation: The Protter web application is
available at http://wlab.ethz.ch/protter. Source code and installation
instructions are available at http://ulo.github.io/Protter/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Visualization of features within biological sequences is essential
for integrated analysis and interpretation of experimental
sequencing data. Software solutions to Visualize nucleic acid
sequences such as genomic DNA in the context of rich feature
annotations (e.g. genes, promoters) and experimental evidence
(e.g. RNA-Seq reads) have become indispensable research tools
for interactive data analysis and hypothesis generation.
Prominent examples include the UCSC genome browser
(Meyer et al., 2012) and IGV (Robinson et al., 2011). In contrast,
only few tools support the Visualization of protein features such
as post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs) or protein domains
within the context of a protein’s topology and—like the examples
above—down to single residue resolution. These include RbDe
(Skrabanek et al., 2003), TMRPres2D (Spyropoulos et al., 2004)
and TOPO2 (http://www.sacs.ucsf.edu/TOPO2). Importantly,
none of these tools integrates experimental proteomic data

in an automated fashion (see Supplementary Table S1 and
Fig. S1 for a detailed comparison).

To exploit the unique insights into protein structure and func-
tion that experimental proteomic data provide, tools are needed
that would allow for their integrated Visualization, interactive
analysis and hypothesis generation (Gehlenborg et al., 2010).
For membrane proteins, which carry out many essential cellular
functions and represent more than half of all current drug targets
(von Heijne, 2007), taking into account the topology is particu-
larly important.

Protter is an interactive and customizable web-based applica-
tion that enables the integration and Visualization of both
annotated and predicted protein sequence features together
with experimental proteomic evidence for peptides and PTMs,
onto the transmembrane topology of a protein. It allows users to
choose from numerous annotation sources, integrate own prote-
omics data ﬁles, select best-suited peptides for targeted quantita-
tive proteomics applications and export publication-quality
illustrations.

2 METHODS

Protter was designed as a web-based software using a client-server archi-
tecture (Fig. 1A). The Protter server application is written in Java and
communicates with clients using HTTP: parameters (Supplementary
Table S3) are speciﬁed in a GET request and the protein Visualization
is returned. Clients can be desktop or web applications (e.g. the Protter
web application), scripts (e.g. for advanced batch plot generation) or any
other tool capable of loading images from the web using HTTP. Thus,
Protter could also be integrated with popular web services like STRING
(Szklarczyk et al., 2011), UniProt (Magrane et al., 2011) or neXtProt
(Lane 61 al., 2011). For each request, the Protter server application gath-
ers (i) protein topology information from UniProt or Phobius (Kall et al.,
2007), (ii) detailed protein feature annotation from UniProt, (iii) proteo-
lytic peptides from PeptideCutter and (iv) experimental proteomic data
from a user’s ﬁle or from repositories like PeptideAtlas (Deutsch, 2010).
The list of available annotation sources (Supplementary Table S2) can be
extended using Java plug-ins. Internally, Protter uses the LaTeX type-
setting system with the TeXtopo (Beitz, 2000) macro package to generate
the topological layout of the protein plot, which is processed and returned
to the client. A multi—level cache strategy is used to minimize response
time.

The Protter web application (Fig. 1B) offers an intuitive way to specify
all parameters for plotting using a web browser. It communicates to the
Protter server Via AJAX and presents an interactive inline display of the
resulting protein plot. Proteomic result ﬁles are loaded and analyzed
on the client side, allowing for responsive browsing through proteins
and peptides.

3 RESULTS

The Protter web application enables users to generate custom
protein feature Visualizations right in their browser by following
four easy steps: (i) A UniProt identiﬁer or a protein sequence
is speciﬁed. (ii) The protein’s transmembrane topology is
deﬁned. (iii) Various protein features (e.g. PTMs, secondary
structure, sequence motifs, custom regions of interest, etc.; see
Supplementary Table S2 for supported annotation sources) are
highlighted. (iV) Additional options for the Visualization are set.
Selected features are highlighted in the residue-based protein dia-
gram by varying four parameters: the color of the amino acid
letter, the shape of the amino acid symbol, the symbol’s frame
color and the symbol’s background color. As Protter chooses
appropriate default settings automatically, all but the ﬁrst step
are optional. The interactive Visualization of the chosen protein
is displayed freely scalable in the browser (Fig. 1C). An online
help guides the user through all steps and provides documenta-
tion on underlying annotation sources and technologies used.

A distinctive key feature of Protter is the ability to overlay
experimental proteomic data either from individual experi-
ments [result ﬁles of PeptideProphet (Keller et al., 2002),
ProteinProphet (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003), Mascot (Perkins
et al., 1999), MaxQuant (Cox and Mann, 2008) and Skyline
(MacLean et al., 2010) are supported] or large data collections
like PeptideAtlas. Identiﬁed proteins, peptides and PTMs can
be inspected individually in the browser and a combined Visual-
ization of all proteins can be downloaded as one PDF document
or as ZIP archive of separate ﬁles.

Protter supports several common usage scenarios, such as
the Visual inspection of a protein’s transmembrane topology,
the integrated assessment of both predicted and experimental
peptide and PTM evidence, the generation of publication-quality
ﬁgures and a wide range of speciﬁc applications in proteomics
research:

0 Protter supports targeted proteomic approaches like selected
reaction monitoring (SRM) (Lange et al., 2008), which are
based on selection of peptides that unambiguously identify
and reproducibly quantify a speciﬁc protein of interest.
Through integrated Visualization of protease cleavage sites,
peptide evidence classes (Qeli and Ahrens, 2010), previously
experimentally identiﬁed peptides [e.g. from PeptideAtlas,
UniPep (Zhang et al., 2006), N—glycoprotein SRMAtlas
(Huttenhain et al., 2013)], transmembrane regions and any
known PTM or sequence variant, suitable peptide candidates
can be Visualized and selected intuitively before the actual
and after the proteomic experiment (see Supplementary
Fig. S2). To facilitate this process, Protter is supported Via
a plug-in from the leading targeted proteomics software en-
vironment Skyline (see Supplementary Fig. S3).

0 Proteomic evidence from surfaceome research (W ollscheid
et al., 2009; Beck et al., 2012) generates glycopeptide—derived
topological constraints (Tsirigos et al., 2012), where Visual-
ization using Protter aids in the better prediction and valid-
ation of the actual transmembrane topology of cell surface
proteins (see Supplementary Fig. S4).

o Ligand-based receptor-capture (LRC) technology (Frei
et al., 2012) allows MS-based identiﬁcation of receptor
proteins to orphan ligands. Potential receptors need to
have cell surface—exposed N—glycosylation sites within MS-
compatible tryptic peptides to be identiﬁable. Using a
Protter Visualization, one can judge at a glance whether a
potential receptor will be amenable to LRC technology.

0 Phosphorylation site identiﬁcations from phosphoproteomic
screens can be Visualized in the context of annotated phos-
phorylation sites as well as known protein kinase sequence
motifs, giving a direct hint on a protein’s potential role in the
cell signaling network.

0 Experimentally identiﬁed peptides from large datasets can
be easily Visualized Via the web interface, as demonstrated in
a combined PDF (Supplementary Fig. S5) of 267 plots
Visualizing proteins with predicted transmembrane domains
from the ﬁrst complete membrane proteome described
(Omasits et al., 2013). This big dataset was Visualized in
only a couple of minutes—less than it takes to create a
single protein plot using any of the other tools.

All of Protter’s functionalities described above can be accessed
through the user-friendly web interface, without writing a single
line of code—another feature unique to Protter. However, for
more reﬁned automation purposes, the Protter server API is
simple to use from any scripting language, as exempliﬁed in
Supplementary Listing S1 and Figure S6 for the Visualization
of sequence conservation, or Supplementary Listing S2 for the
usage of TMHMM instead of Phobius for transmembrane
topology prediction.

In summary, the open source application Protter supports the
customizable Visualization of protein sequence features in
the context of protein topology and experimental proteomic
evidence in publication quality, for single proteins as well as
for large-scale proteomic datasets. This, in turn, enables direct
Visual insights pre— and post-publication of discovery-driven and
targeted proteomic datasets.

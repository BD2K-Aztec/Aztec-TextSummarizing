ABSTRACT

Motivation: Mass spectrometry (MS) instruments and experimental
protocols are rapidly advancing, but de novo peptide sequencing al-
gorithms to analyze tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra are lagging
behind. Although existing de novo sequencing tools perform well on
certain types of spectra [e.g. Collision Induced Dissociation (CID)
spectra of tryptic peptides], their performance often deteriorates on
other types of spectra, such as Electron Transfer Dissociation (EI'D),
Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) spectra or spectra of
non-tryptic digests. Thus, rather than developing a new algorithm for
each type of spectra, we develop a universal de novo sequencing
algorithm called UniNovo that works well for all types of spectra or
even for spectral pairs (e.g. CID/ETD spectral pairs). UniNovo uses an
improved scoring function that captures the dependences between
different ion types, where such dependencies are learned automatic-
ally using a modified offset frequency function.

Results: The performance of UniNovo is compared with PepNovo+,
PEAKS and pNovo using various types of spectra. The results show
that the performance of UniNovo is superior to other tools for ETD
spectra and superior or comparable with others for CID and HCD
spectra. UniNovo also estimates the probability that each reported
reconstruction is correct, using simple statistics that are readily ob-
tained from a small training dataset. We demonstrate that the estima-
tion is accurate for all tested types of spectra (including CID, HCD,
ETD, CID/ETD and HCD/ETD spectra of trypsin, LysC or AspN
digested peptides).

Availability: UniNovo is implemented in JAVA and tested on Windows,
Ubuntu and OS X machines. UniNovo is available at http://proteomics.

1 INTRODUCTION

De novo peptide sequencing by tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrom-
etry is a valuable alternative to MS/MS database search. In con-
trast to the database search approach that utilizes the
information from proteome, the de novo sequencing approach
attempts to identify peptides only using the information from
the input spectrum. Hence, most de novo sequencing algorithms
are based on the prior knowledge of the fragmentation

characteristics (e.g. ion types and their propensities) of MS/MS
spectra (Frank, 2009; Frank and Pevzner, 2005; Ma et al., 2003).
The fragmentation characteristics are highly dependent on the
fragmentation method used to generate the spectrum. Among
several fragmentation methods available, the collision-induced
dissociation (CID) is the most commonly used method.
Accordingly, the fragmentation characteristics of CID have
been well studied compared with recently introduced fragmenta-
tion methods, such as electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and
higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) (Barton and
Whittaker, 2009; Breci et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2005;
Johnson et al., 1987; Tabb et al., 2004; Wysocki et al., 2000).
As a result, many de novo sequencing algorithms have been intro-
duced for CID spectra; for example, PEAKS (Ma et al., 2003)
and PepNovo+ (Frank, 2009; Frank and Pevzner, 2005) are the
state of the art de novo sequencing tools for CID spectra.
Other fragmentation methods like ETD and HCD have a
great potential for de novo sequencing. For example, for highly
charged spectra, ETD provides better fragmentation and thus is
better suited for de novo sequencing than CID (Swaney et al.,
2008; ZubareV et al., 2008). Also, more complete fragmentation
of peptide ions (especially in low mass regions) in HCD provides
a better chance to obtain more accurate de novo reconstructions
than CID (Chi et al., 2010; Olsen et al., 2007). Furthermore,
modern mass spectrometers (e. g. LTQ-Orbitrap Velos) allow
the generation of paired spectra (e.g. CID/ETD or HCD/ETD
spectral pairs). Since CID (or HCD) and ETD spectra provide
complementary information for peptide sequencing (Datta and
Bern, 2009; He and Ma, 2010; Savitski et al., 2005), such spectral
pairs (or even triplets) enable more accurate de novo sequencing.
Several de novo sequencing algorithms were recently presented
to take advantage of those new fragmentation methods. For in-
stance, Liu et al. (2010) proposed a de novo sequencing algorithm
for ETD spectra, which is used by PEAKS. For HCD spectra,
Chi et al. (2010) introduced a de novo sequencing tool, pNovo,
that not only takes advantage of the high precision peaks in
HCD spectra but also uses the information of abundant immo-
nium and internal ions. In case of spectral pairs, Savitski et al.
(2005) proposed a greedy algorithm (for CID/ECD spectral
pairs) that signiﬁcantly boosts the performance of de novo
sequencing. Datta and Bern (2009) presented Spectrum Fusion,
a de novo sequencing algorithm for CID/ETD spectral pairs.
Spectrum Fusion constructs a combined spectrum from the
input CID/ETD spectral pair using a Bayesian Network. It gen-
erates multiple de novo sequences using the combined spectrum
and score them by the scoring function in ByOnic (Bern et al.,
2007). He and Ma (2010) also presented a de novo sequencing

algorithm, ADEPTS, for CID/ETD spectral pairs. Given a CID/
ETD spectral pair, ADEPTS ﬁrst ﬁnds 1000 candidate de novo
sequences from each spectrum, using PEAKS. The total 2000
candidate sequences are then rescored against the input spectral
pair, and the best-scoring peptide is reported.

While the above tools perform well for the spectra generated
from the fragmentation method(s) that each tool targeted, they
often generate inferior results for the spectra from other frag-
mentation methods. Moreover, if alternative proteases (e.g. LysC
or AspN) are used for protein digestion, these tools may produce
suboptimal results because different proteases often generate
peptides with different fragmentation characteristics (Kim
et al., 2010).

In case of the database search approach, Kim et al. (2010)
recently introduced a universal algorithm MS-GFDB
that shows a signiﬁcantly better peptide identiﬁcation per-
formance than other existing database search tools such as
Mascot+Percolator (Kall et al., 2007; Perkins et al., 1999).
However, a universal de novo sequencing tool is still missing.

We present UniNovo, a universal de novo sequencing tool
that can be generalized for various types (i.e. the combinations
of the fragmentation method and the protease used to digest
sample proteins) of spectra. The scoring function of UniNovo
is easily trainable using a training dataset consisting of thou-
sands of annotated spectra. All information needed for de novo
sequencing are learned from the training dataset, and the run-
ning time for training is <5h in a typical desktop environ-
ment. Currently, UniNovo is trained for CID, HCD and ETD
spectra of trypsin, LysC or AspN digested peptides. We show
that the performance of UniNovo is better than or comparable
with PepNovo+, PEAKS and pNovo for various types of
spectra.

One of the biggest challenges in de novo sequencing is to esti-
mate the error rate of the resulting de novo reconstructions.
Unlike MS/MS database search tools that commonly uses the
target-decoy approach (Elias and Gygi, 2007; Nesvizhskii, 2010)
to estimate the statistical signiﬁcance of the peptide identiﬁca-
tions, de novo reconstructions have rarely been subjected to a
statistical signiﬁcance analysis in the past.

Several de novo sequencing tools report the error rate of amino
acid predictions (e. g. conﬁdence scores in PEAKS), but this is
often not sufﬁcient because the overall quality of the sequence
cannot be easily determined by the error rates of individual
amino acid predictions. To our knowledge, only PepNovo+ re-
ports the empirical probability that the output peptide is correct.
PepNovo+ predicts the probabilities using logistic regression
with multiple features of the reconstructions such as length and
score, which are extracted from a training dataset consisting of
hundreds of thousands of annotated spectra (Frank, 2009).
However, PepNovo+ does not include an automated training
procedure (that would allow to easily extend PepNovo+ for
newly emerging mass spectrometry approaches) and is currently
trained only for CID [Extending PepNovo+ beyond CID spectra
requires training complex boosting-based re-ranking models for
predicting peak ranks and rescoring peptide candidates.
PepNovo+ training includes several manual steps and the avail-
ability of a very large corpus of training spectra (Ari Frank,
personal communication, October 5, 2012)]. Thus, in case of

non-CID fragmentation methods, it remains unclear how to
obtain accurate error rate estimation for de novo reconstructions.

UniNovo estimates the probability that each reported recon-
struction is correct, using simple statistics that are readily ob-
tained from a small training dataset. We demonstrate that the
estimation is accurate for all tested types of spectra (including
CID, HCD, ETD, CID/ETD and HCD/ETD spectra of trypsin,
LysC or AspN digested peptides). This allows UniNovo to auto-
matically ﬁlter out low quality spectra.

2 METHODS

Similar to Kim et al. (2009a), we ﬁrst describe the algorithm on a
simpliﬁed model that assumes the following:

o the masses of amino acids are integers (e.g. the mass of Gly is 57).
o the m/z (mass to charge ratio) of peaks (in spectra) are integers.
o the intensity of all peaks is 1.

0 only N-terminal charge 1 ions are considered (e.g. b, c, or b — H20
ions, but not y-ion series).

0 the parent mass (the mass of the precursor ion) of a spectrum equals
to the mass of the peptide that generated the spectrum.

While such a simpliﬁed model is impractical, we chose to introduce our
algorithm on this model for better understanding of the algorithm on a
more complex and realistic model. The algorithm on a more realistic
model is described in the Supplementary section S2.

2.1 Terminology and deﬁnitions

Let A be the set of amino acids with (integer) masses m(a) for a e A. A
peptide a1a2 - - -ak is a sequence of amino acids, and the mass of a peptide
is the total mass of amino acids in the peptide. We represent a peptide
a1a2 - - -ak with mass n by a Boolean vector P = (P1, ...,Pn), where

P,- = 1 if i = ﬁat for 0<j<k, and P,- = 0 otherwise. If P,- = 1, we call
t=1

a mass i a fragmentation site. For example, suppose there are two amino

acids A and B with masses 2 and 3, respectively. Then, the peptide ABBA

has the mass of 2 + 3 + 3 +2 2 10 and is represented by a Boolean

vector (0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0). The fragmentation sites of this peptide are,

thus, 2, 5 and 8.

A spectrum is a list of peaks, where each peak is speciﬁed by an m/z.
We represent a spectrum of parent mass n by a Boolean vector
S 2 (S1, ..., Sn), where S,- = 1 if the peak of m/z i (or simply the
peak i) is present and S,- = 0 otherwise (Representing peptides and spec-
tra as vectors allows us to represent the generation of spectra from pep-
tides by simple vector operations).

A peptide-spectrum match (PSM) is a pair (P, S) formed by a peptide
P and a spectrum S. Given an integer 8 called an ion type and a PSM
(P, S), we say a peak i is a 8-i0n peak (with respect to P) if i— 8 is a
fragmentation site, that is, PM = 1. In this model, the ion type can be
any integer. In the connection to the experimental MS/MS spectra, ion
types can represent common singly charged N—terminal ions; for example,
the ion types 1 and —27 represent b and a ions, respectively.

Given an integer f called a feature and a spectrum S, we say that a peak
i satisfies f if another peak i+ f is present in the spectrum, that is,
Si+f = 1. For instance, a peak 30 satisﬁes a feature f = —18, if
S30_1g = 1. In experimental spectra, various ions are often observed
along with neutral losses (e.g. b-ion and b — H2 O-ion) or with related
ions (6. g. b—ion and a-ion). A feature describes the relation (the shift of
m/z values in this simpliﬁed model) between two peaks that may corres-
pond to a neutral loss or a mass gain/loss between related ions. For
example, since we are dealing with only charge 1 ions, a water loss

from a-ion to b-ion is represented by the feature f = +27. The possible
interpretations of selected features are found in Supplementary Tables
S5—S37 in the Supplementary section S12.

2.2 Peptide-spectrum generative model

We model how a peptide P of mass n generates a spectrum S. Apart from
a 1-step generative model in Bandeira et al. (2008) or Kim et al. (2009a),
we introduce a more adequate 2-step probabilistic model in which the
dependency between different ions can be described.

Assume that we are given the set of ion types (the ion type set A) and
the set of features (the feature set F). For simplicity, we consider the case
where only one ion type 6 = 0 is in A and one feature f is in F. Given a
peptide P, a partial-spectrum s is generated per each element P,~ of P as
follows: The probability that s,- = 1 is given by a if P,- = 1 or by ,8 other-
wise (the ﬁrst generation step). This ﬁrst step can be characterized by a
2 x 2 matrix called the ion type matrix (Fig. 1). When s,- = 1, the prob-
ability that Si+f = 1 (i.e. the peak i satisﬁes f) is given by ,u if P,- = 1 or 1)
otherwise (the second generation step). The second step is characterized
by the feature-ion type matrix (Fig. 1) (Given s,- = 0, the probability that
Si+f = 1 is assumed to be 0.). The second step can describe the depend-
ency between different ions (or an ion and its neutral loss) from the same
fragmentation site. If multiple ion types and multiple features are con-
sidered, the ion type matrix should be deﬁned per ion type, and the
feature-ion type matrix per ion type and per feature. The spectrum S is
generated by taking elementwise OR operation for the generated partial-
spectra s.

2.3 Training UniNovo

Since the ion type matrices and feature-ion type matrices fully describe
the generation of a spectrum, in the training step, UniNovo learns these
matrices from the training dataset (a set of PSMs). To deﬁne these matri-
ces, the ion type set A and the feature set F should be formed. Using the
offset frequency function introduced in Dancik et al. (1999), we collect
frequently observed ion types and form the ion type set A. To form the
feature set F, we deﬁne the feature frequency function with which one can
count how many times each possible feature is observed in the training
dataset (see the Supplementary section S1.2). Using the feature frequency
function, we collect frequently observed features and form the feature set

F. From here on, we only consider ion types in the ion type set A and
features in the feature set F.

Next UniNovo learns the ion type and feature-ion type matrices that
characterize the generative model of the PSMs in the training dataset. For
example, a = Pr(s,- = 1|P,- = 1) can be empirically determined if partial-
spectra s are given. However, it is not clear how to decompose a spectrum
S into partial-spectra s (since partial spectra may share peaks in the
spectrum). As a compromise, we learn Pr(S,- = 1|P,- = 1) for estimation
of or. Other probabilities are also empirically determined similarly by
substituting the partial-spectra by the spectrum.

We emphasize that all the above probabilities can be learned from a
small set of PSMs (e. g. 5000 PSMs per charge state are often sufﬁcient to
avoid overﬁtting; see the Supplementary section S15) even if there are
many ion types in A and features in F because each probability is asso-
ciated to an individual ion type or a combination of an ion type and a
feature, not a combination of multiple ion types and multiple features.

Lastly, we compute the probability that a random element of a peptide
vector is a fragmentation site, i.e., Pr(P,- = 1) [When masses of amino
acids are rounded to integers, Pr(P,- = 1) N ﬂ. However, if we consider
more accurate amino acid masses (for the spectra of high resolution), this
probability should be learned from the training dataset.]. This probability
is called the prior fragmentation probability and denoted by p. The de-
tailed description of UniNovo training is given in the Supplementary
section S1.

2.4 How to infer fragmentation sites from a spectrum

Given a spectrum S of parent mass n, our goal is to predict the frag-
mentation sites of the (unknown) peptide P that generated S. For
simplicity, assume that there exists a single ion type 6 = 0 is in the ion
type set A (but multiple features in the feature set F). Given a peak i,
deﬁne H as the set of features that the peak i satisﬁes. Then the fragmen-
tation sites are predicted by solving the following Bayesian inference
problem.

Fragmentation inference problem: Given the set of features H and P,~
such that Pr(P,- = 1) = p (the prior fragmentation probability), derive the
posterior probability Pr(P,- = 1|S,- = S,-+f = 1 for f e H).

Since we assumed that there is only one ion type, we have only one ion
type matrix. On the other hand, per each feature we have a feature-
ion type matrix. Let W and vf denote ,u and v associated to the fea-
ture f, respectively. If we can assume that all features are independent

(i.e., the events ‘S,- = Si+f= 1 for f’ are independent for f e H), we

where y = Pr(P,- = 1|S,- = 1) = 1% (see the Supplementary section

a fragmentation probability vector (737312) as a vector with n elements
such that

probability that P,- = 1 (see Supplementary Figs S3 and S4, blue bars).
We use .7731} for the generation of de novo reconstructions.

The equation (1) is based on a simpliﬁed model in which a single one
ion type and multiple independent features are used. However, some
features are known to be strongly dependent on each other (e. g. a feature
describing a single water loss and a double water losses), and usually
multiple ion types are present in the ion type set. Thus, in practice, per
each peak, UniNovo automatically selects a small number of features
(<10 out of thousands of features in the feature set) that are weakly
correlated yet effective to determine the ion type of the peak. Assuming
that the selected features are mutually independent, 737312 is calculated
per ion type using the equation (1), and then the ﬁnal 7:73)} is given by a
weighted summation of the .7: 7312’s of different ion types. Note that there
are many possible combinations of features due to the large number of all
the features in the feature set (even if the number of the features to cal-
culate $7312 per peak is <10). Since different combinations of features are
selected for different peaks, UniNovo is able to use more diverse relations
between different ions as compared with other tools that typically use
ﬁxed dependencies between ions (6. g. PepNovo). The detailed description
and an example of the feature selection method and the calculation of
.7731} are given in the Supplementary section S3.

2.5 Generating de novo reconstructions

To generate de novo reconstructions, we ﬁrst construct a spectrum graph
(Dancik et al., 1999). Given a spectrum S of parent mass n from an
unknown peptide P, the spectrum graph G( V, E) is deﬁned as a directed
acyclic graph whose vertex set V consists of 0 (the source), n (the sink)
and integers i such that .7731},- > 0. Two vertices i and j are connected by
an edge (i, j) if j — iequals to the mass of an amino acid or the total mass
of multiple amino acids (a mass gap). Any path from 0 (the source) to n
(the sink) in a spectrum graph corresponds to a peptide (possibly con-
taining mass gaps). We say that a vertex iis correct if P,- = 1 and an edge
(i, j) is correct if both vertices i and j are correct. We also say that a path r
is correct if all vertices in r are correct. The length of a reconstruction is
deﬁned by the total number of amino acids and mass gaps in the
reconstruction.

To score a de novo reconstruction, we use an additive (i.e., the score of
a path is the sum of scores of vertices of the path) log likelihood ratio
scoring [similar to Dancik et al. (1999)]. Given a vertex i, let .7731},- = x.
The likelihoods of the following two hypothesis for the outcome
737312,- : x are tested: (1) the vertex i is correct and (ii) the vertex i is
incorrect. Let Pr(P,- = 1|.7-"73Vi = x) = x. Then, we have

£(P,- = 11737312,- : x) _ Pr(.7-'73V,- = x|P,- = 1) _ x l—p

£(P, = 0mm- : x) T Pr(f73v,- = lei = 0) T 1 — x ' p ' (3)

The score of the vertex i with .7731},- = x is deﬁned by
Score(i) z: [logﬁ - 1%] where H denotes the rounding to the nearest

 

integer. Given a path r, the score of the path r is deﬁned by Z Score(i).

iEr

Since an additive scoring is used, top scoring reconstructions can be
efﬁciently generated using a dynamic programming as in Dancik et al.
(1999). We did not exclude symmetric paths in the spectrum graph that
usually correspond to incorrect reconstructions. Considering only the
antisymmetric paths would further enhance the performance of
UniNovo (Chen et al., 2001).

After generating the reconstructions, a probability that each recon-
struction is correct (termed the accuracy of the reconstruction) is pre-
dicted, using Hunter’s bound OIunter, 1976) (see the Supplementary
section S4 for the deﬁnition of the accuracy of reconstructions).
Hunter’s bound can be calculated from relatively simple statistics that
are readily learned from a small set of PSMs (about 5000 PSMs).
Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 (green bars) in the Supplementary
section S9 show that the accuracy of a reconstruction is a conservative
estimate of the empirical probability of the reconstruction being correct.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Datasets

To benchmark UniNovo, we used 13 different datasets with di-
verse fragmentation methods (CID/ETD/HCD), digested with
diverse proteases (trypsin, LysC and AspN), and having diverse
charge states (see Table 1). We re-analyzed the spectral datasets
(original datasets) from Albert Heck’s and Joshua Coon’s labora-
tories that were previously analyzed in Kim et al. (2010), Swaney
et al. (2010) and F rese et al. (2011). The CID and ETD spectra in
these original datasets were acquired in a hybrid linear ion trap/
Orbitrap mass spectrometers (high MS1 resolution and low MS2
resolution). The HCD spectra have high MS1 and MS2 reso-
lution. All spectra in the original datasets were identiﬁed by
MS-GFDB (ver. 01/06/2012) (Kim et al., 2010) at 1% peptide-
level FDR without allowing any modiﬁcation except the carba-
midomethylation of Cys (C + 57) as a ﬁxed modiﬁcation [In the
Supplementary section S13, we also re-analyzed the dataset
reported in Kim et al. (2009b) that contains doubly charged
CID spectra identiﬁed using Sequest (Eng et al., 1994) and
PeptideProphet (Keller et al., 2002).]. Out of all identiﬁed spec-
tra, we selected 1000 spectra (or pairs of spectra) from distinct
peptides randomly and formed the 13 datasets listed in Table 1.
The unselected identiﬁed spectra (about 5000 to 20 000 spectra
depending on the type of spectra) were used for the training of
UniNovo. The peptide contained in the training dataset were not
contained in the above 13 datasets. See the Supplementary sec-
tion S10 for the detailed description of these datasets.

3.2 Benchmarking UniNovo

We benchmarked UniNovo, PepNovo+ (ver. 3.1 beta) (Frank,
2009), PEAKS (ver. 5.3, online) (Ma et al., 2003) and pNovo
(ver. 1.1) (Chi et al., 2010) using the datasets in Table 1. For each
tool, we generated N de novo reconstructions per each spectrum
for N = 1, 5 and 20. We say that a spectrum is correctly
sequenced if at least one of N reconstructions generated from
the spectrum is correct. To evaluate the performance of each
tool, the number of correctly sequenced spectra and the average
length of correct reconstructions were measured for each tool
(Since mass gaps are allowed for reconstructions, often multiple
correct reconstructions were reported for a spectrum. To calcu-
late the average length of correct reconstructions, only the top
scoring correct reconstruction was counted per a spectrum.).

Note: Number of spectra (or spectral pairs) is 1000 for each dataset. While UniNovo is applicable to all datasets, other tools are only applicable to (or optimized for) datasets

marked by ‘*’. PEAKS was not tested for HCD datasets.

For UniNovo, the maximum number of mass gaps in a recon-
struction was set to 2. UniNovo was tested for all datasets. For
PepNovo+, also N top scoring reconstructions were generated
per spectrum. PepNovo+ was used for CID2, CIDL2, CIDA2,
HCD2 and HCD3 datasets. In case of PEAKS, we ﬁrst gener-
ated 500 top scoring reconstructions per each spectrum. Then,
for each reconstruction we converted amino acids with the local
conﬁdence <30% into mass gaps. Such conversion is adopted
because PEAKS generates reconstruction without mass gaps
while UniNovo and PepNovo+ generate reconstructions with
up to two mass gaps. In this procedure, multiple reconstructions
without mass gaps were often converted into the same recon-
struction with mass gaps. The score of a converted reconstruc-
tion is deﬁned as the highest score of the reconstructions before
conversion. Out of the converted reconstructions, N top high
scoring (distinct) ones were chosen and used for further analysis.
PEAKS was tested for all datasets except for HCD2 and HCD3
datasets. For pNovo, N top scoring reconstructions were gener-
ated per a spectrum (pNovo also generates reconstructions with-
out mass gaps. However, the conversion of reconstructions as in
PEAKS could not be applied to pNovo because pNovo does not
report any local score.). Only HCD2 and HCD3 datasets were
analyzed by pNovo. The parameters of each tool for each dataset
is provided in the Supplementary section S8.

We also indirectly compared UniNovo with MS-GF DB (Kim
et al., 2010), as both tools were developed to analyze diverse
types of spectra. We replaced the scoring function of UniNovo
with that of MS-GF DB and generated reconstructions using the
replaced scoring method. More precisely, the spectrum graph
was generated by MS-GF DB per each spectrum, and the recon-
structions were generated by UniNovo on that spectrum graph
(instead of the spectrum graph generated by UniNovo). This
generation method is speciﬁed by MS-GFDBScore. All experi-
mental parameters for MS-GFDBScore were the same as for
UniNovo.

Figure 2 shows the comparison results for different datasets.
UniNovo found the largest number of correctly sequenced
spectra among all the tested tools in most datasets. In particu-
lar, for ETD spectra, UniNovo reported signiﬁcantly more
correctly sequenced spectra than PEAKS. For example, in

case of ETD2 or ETDL4 dataset, the number of correctly
sequenced spectra was more than twice for UniNovo than
for PEAKS.

For CID spectra, UniNovo and PepNovo+ showed similar
results. When N: 1, UniNovo and PepNovo+ found about
the same number of correctly sequenced spectra in CID2 and
CIDL2 datasets, but UniNovo found about 35% more correctly
sequenced spectra than PepNovo+ in CIDA2 dataset.

While trypsin and LysC-digested peptides generate the spectra
of similar fragmentation characteristics, AspN-digested peptides
generate spectra with distinct fragmentation propensities.
UniNovo worked well with AspN-digested peptides, but
PepNovo+ showed suboptimal results for the spectra of
AspN-digested peptides [Training of the parameters for the
Bayesian network of PepNovo (Frank and Pevzner, 2005) for
the CID spectra of AspN- or LysC-digested peptides would lead
to better results; however, as mentioned above, the re-ranking
models of PepNovo+ (Frank, 2009), which are crucial for the
superior performance of PepNovo+ for CID tryptic spectra (see
the Supplementary section S14), cannot be readily trained.]. The
length of correct reconstructions for PepNovo+ was slightly
longer than for UniNovo.

The results on HCD spectra also demonstrate that UniNovo
ﬁnds the largest number of correctly sequenced spectra in gen-
eral. The reconstructions reported by pNovo were, however,
longer than those by UniNovo (and PepNovo+) by two to
three amino acids. This suggests that UniNovo still has room
for improvement for HCD spectra (e.g. introducing features
better reﬂecting the high mass resolution and information from
immonium or internal ions).

The results from UniNovo were superior to MS-GFDBScore
in both terms of the number of correctly sequenced spectra and
the average length of the correct reconstructions in all datasets.

For each dataset, we drew the Venn diagrams of the correctly
sequenced spectra (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs S5—S12) to
see the overlaps of the spectra between different tools. For all
datasets, the overlaps between different tools increase as N
grows, as expected. Relatively small overlaps are observed for
ETD spectra (as compared with CID or HCD spectra). It indi-
cates that UniNovo may have been using some valuable features

Fig. 2. Comparison of de novo sequencing tools [as well as a database search tool MS-GFDB (Kim et al., 2010) tweaked for de novo sequencing]. Per
each spectrum, N top scoring reconstructions were generated by UniNovo, PepNovo+ (Frank, 2009; Frank and Pevzner, 2005), PEAKS (Ma et al.,
2003), pNovo (Chi et al., 2010) and MS-GFDBScore. MS-GFDBScore provides UniNovo with MS-GFDB’s scoring function. The number of reported
reconstructions per a spectrum (N) is set to 1, 5 and 20. A reconstruction is correct if all the fragmentation sites of the reconstruction are correct, and a
spectrum is classiﬁed as correctly sequenced if at least one of the reconstructions generated from the spectrum is correct. Figures on the left side (a, c and
e) show the number of correctly sequenced spectra in each dataset, and ﬁgures on the right side a), d and 1) show the average length of the correct

reconstructions

of ETD spectra missed by PEAKS (and vice versa) and suggests
that combining UniNovo and PEAKS results may potentially
lead to a promising de novo sequencing approach.

While the above results measure the sequence level accuracy,
they do not directly show the amino acid level precision or
recall. To measure the amino acid level precision and recall,
the top scoring reconstruction was generated per spectrum for
each tool (i.e. N: 1). For this experiment, MS-GFDB was not
tested, and the reconstructions of PEAKS were not converted
using the local conﬁdence. From the generated reconstructions,
the number of (predicted) fragmentation sites and the number
of correct fragmentation sites are counted. Also, since the spec-
tra are annotated, we can count the number of all

fragmentation sites in test sets. The precision and recall are
deﬁned by

#correct fragmentation sites
#predicted fragmentation sites

 

(4)

recall: (5)
Figure 4 shows the precision and recall values of the
tested tools for different datasets. For all datasets, UniNovo
showed the highest precision value. But the recall values
of UniNovo tended to be lower than others in particular
for CID spectra. For ETD2 and ETDL4 datasets, UniNovo

of the scoring function (i.e., spectrum graph) of UniNovo for
different spectrum types is found in the Supplementary section
S14, where we also compared the spectrum graphs from
UniNovo, PepNovo and MS-GF DB for CID2 dataset.

3.3 De novo sequencing of paired spectra

UniNovo also can be used to sequence paired spectra (e. g. CID/
ETD spectral pairs). Given multiple spectra from the same pre-
cursor ion, UniNovo ﬁrst generates a spectrum graph from each
of the spectra and next merges the spectrum graphs into a com-
bined spectrum graph, on which the reconstructions are gener-
ated (refer to the Supplementary section S5 for the spectrum
graph merging algorithm).

To benchmark UniNovo in de novo sequencing of paired spec-
tra, CID/ETD2 and CID/ETD3 datasets were analyzed by
UniNovo. From CID/ETD2 dataset, two additional datasets
were generated: CID/etd2 and Cid/ETD2 datasets. CID/etd2
dataset was formed by taking only CID spectra, and cid/ETD2
dataset by taking only ETD spectra in CID/ETD2 dataset. CID/
etd3 and Cid/ETD3 datasets were generated similarly. For each
dataset, we generated N : 1, 5 and 20 top scoring
reconstructions.

The results are shown in Figure 5. When precursor ions were
doubly charged, the performance boost from the paired spectra
was very modest. For N : 1, 5, and 20, UniNovo reported 5%
more correctly sequenced spectral pairs in CID/ETD2 datasets
than in CID/etd2 dataset. The average length of correct recon-
structions for CID/ETD2 dataset was slightly longer than for
CID/etd2 dataset.

In contrast, for triply charged spectra, the use of paired spectra
was highly beneﬁcial for generating more accurate reconstruc-
tions. For example, when N: 1, UniNovo reported 100 and
50% more correctly sequenced spectral pairs in CID/ETD3 data-
set than in CID/etd3 and Cid/ETD3 datasets, respectively. The
length of correct reconstructions typically increases by 1—2 amino
acids by using the CID/ETD paired spectra.

3.4 De novo sequencing with quality ﬁltering

Given a set of reconstructions generated from a spectrum,
UniNovo estimates the probability that at least one reconstruc-
tion in the set is correct (i.e., a probability that the spectrum is
correctly sequenced) based on the accuracies of reconstructions.
The estimated probability is called the set accuracy (When mul-
tiple de novo reconstructions are reported, it is important to guar-
antee that one of them is correct.) Denote the set of
reconstructions by R : {r1, ...,rN}. If the events ‘r, is correct’
for i : 1, . . . ,N are independent, the set accuracy is simply given

N
by 1 — H (1 — Accuracy(r,-)). However, since the reconstructions
i=1

are often similar to each other, the dependency between recon-
structions should be taken into account. To model this depend-
ency, we assume Markov property between the events ‘r,- is
correct’ for i: 1, ...,N and compute the set accuracy. The
derivation of the set accuracy is given in the Supplementary
section S6.

When the parameter N is set, one may want to choose N re-

constructions with the highest accuracies to maximize the set

Fig. 5. De novo sequencing of paired spectra. CID/ETD spectral pairs
were analyzed by UniNovo (in CID /ETD2 and CID/ETD3 datasets). To
see if the spectral pairs are beneﬁcial for de novo sequencing, CID/etd2
(Cid/ETD2) dataset was generated from CID/ETD2 dataset by collecting
only CID (ETD) spectra in CID/ETD2 dataset. Likewise, CID/etd3 and
Cid/ETD3 datasets were generated from CID/ETD3 dataset. (a) the

accuracy. However, such a selection often results in a set of
short reconstructions (because short reconstructions have rela-
tively high accuracies). Since short reconstructions are not very
useful in many cases (e.g. in follow-up homology searches),
UniNovo uses a greedy algorithm to select long and accurate
reconstructions. The inputs to the algorithm are the parameters
SetAccuracyThreshold and N. The algorithm tries to form an
output set of N reconstructions of set accuracy higher than
SetAccuracyThreshold while maximizing the minimum length
of the reconstructions (see the Supplementary section S7 for
the description of the algorithm). If UniNovo fails to generate
a set of N reconstructions with the set accuracy higher than
SetAccuracyThreshold, it ﬁlters out the query spectrum.

We set SetThreshold : 0.8 and reanalyzed the datasets in
Table 1. The maximum number of mass gaps per each recon-
struction was set to 10. For each dataset, we measured
the number of unﬁltered spectra (termed qualified spectra) and
the percentage of qualiﬁed spectra that were correctly sequenced
(which is expected to be 80% since SetAccuracyThreshold : 0.8).
The average length of correct reconstructions was also measured.

Fig. 6. De novo sequencing with qualify ﬁltering of spectra. Given a spec-
trum, if the parameter SetAccuracyThreshold is set, UniNovo attempts to
achieve set accuracy (an estimated probability of the spectrum being cor-
rectly sequenced) exceeding SetAccuracyThreshold. If it fails to generate
such a set, the spectrum is ﬁltered out. An unﬁltered spectrum is called a
qualified spectrum. We set SetAccuracyThreshold : 0.8. (a) the number of
qualiﬁed spectrum, (b) the percentage of qualiﬁed spectra that were cor-
rectly sequenced, (c) the average length of correct reconstructions

The results are given in Figure 6. For all datasets, the number
of qualiﬁed spectra increases sharply as the number of reconstruc-
tions N grows (Fig. 6a). For example, UniNovo reported only few
qualiﬁed spectra (<5) from CIDA2 dataset when N: 1. When
N: 20, it reported >900 qualiﬁed spectra from the same dataset.
In contrast to the dramatic changes in the number of qualiﬁed
spectra, the percentage of qualiﬁed spectra that were correctly
sequenced hardly changed across the datasets and the values of
N (Fig. 6b). As expected, the percentage was around 80% for all

cases (including the datasets containing CID /ETD spectral pairs),
which shows that the set accuracy reported by UniNovo is reli-
able. Figure 6c shows the average length of correct reconstruc-
tions. As N decreases, the average length also decreases. This is
because shorter reconstructions (with higher accuracies) are
chosen by UniNovo when N is small to achieve high set accuracy.

4 CONCLUSION

We presented a universal de novo sequencing tool UniNovo that
works well for various types of spectra. UniNovo can be easily
trained for different types of spectra using only thousands of
PSMs that typically can be obtained from a single MS/MS
run. The experimental results show that UniNovo generates ac-
curate and long de novo reconstructions from spectra of CID,
ETD, HCD and CID/ETD fragmentation methods and spectra
of trypsin, LysC or AspN digested peptides. We also showed that
UniNovo is better than or comparable with other state of the art
tools.

As pointed out by Ma and Johnson (2011), de novo sequences
not only are valuable for the analysis of the novel peptides that
are not present in proteome databases but also can facilitate the
homology-based database searches. Since the reconstructions re-
ported by UniNovo contain mass gaps representing the total
mass of multiple amino acids [termed gapped peptides (Jeong
et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2009b)], MS-BPM algorithm (Ng et al.,
2011) can be used for fast exact or homology searches
(UniNovoEBMS-BPM). MS-BPM enables searches against a se-
quence database using gapped peptides as queries. Currently MS-
BPM takes gapped peptides generated by MS-GappedDictionary
(Jeong et al., 2011) (MS-GappedDictionaryEBMS-BPM).
However, the reconstructions from UniNovo are usually longer
than those from MS-GappedDictionary (8—9 versus 5—6). Since
the search time of MS-BPM strongly depends on the length of
gapped peptides—the longer gapped peptides, the shorter search
time—the running time of UniNovoEBMS-BPM is smaller than
MS-GappedDictionaryEBMS-BPM by an order of magnitude in a
blind search against the IPI Human proteome database ver.3.87
(Kersey et al., 2004) (data not shown).

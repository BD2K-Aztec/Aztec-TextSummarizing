Abstract

Summary: Identification of domains in protein sequences allows their assigning to biological func—
tions. Several webservers exist for identification of protein domains using similarity searches
against various databases of protein domain models. However, none of them provides comprehen—
sive domain coverage while allowing bqu querying and their visualization schemes can be im—
proved. To address these issues, we developed CDvist (a comprehensive domain visualization
tool), which combines the best available search algorithms and databases into a user—friendly
framework. First, a given protein sequence is matched to domain models using high—specificity
tools and only then unmatched segments are subjected to more sensitive algorithms resulting in a
best possible comprehensive coverage. Bulk querying and rich visualization and download options

 

provide improved functionality to domain architecture analysis.
Availability and implementation: Freely available on the web at http://cdvist.utk.edu

1 Introduction

The identification of protein domains is a key feature of protein
sequence analysis. Several databases, notably Pfam (Punta et 61].,
2012), Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART)
(Letunic et 61]., 2009), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG)
(Tatusov et 61]., 2003), Conserved Domain Database (CDD)
(Marchler—Bauer et 61]., 2013) and others, develop and maintain do—
main models. Searching tools such as RPS—BLAST (Marchler-Bauer
et al., 2013), HMMER3 (Eddy, 2011) and HHpred/HHsearch
(Hildebrand et 61]., 2009; Soding, 2005) are used to match sequences
to domain models present in a given database. The size of the pro—
tein sequence database grows dramatically, whereas its coverage by
pre—computed domain models increases very slowly (Rekapalli et 61].,
2012). Consequently, sensitive domain searches of sequences in bulk
are necessary to improve computational coverage of the current and
future protein sequence space. Despite the overwhelming success of

the current state—of—the—art domain searching resources, three areas
require further improvements: (i) combining tools with high specifi-
city and tools with high sensitivity in a single framework, (ii) mul-
tiple query searches using highly sensitive (e.g. profile-to-profile)
methods, (iii) visualization of most relevant information in a respon-
sive and interactive way.

To address these issues, we have developed the Comprehensive
Domain Visualization Tool (CDvist), a domain—searching webserver
specialized in maximizing domain coverage of multidomain protein
sequences with emphasis on visualization.

2 Implementation and features

Users submit protein sequences in FASTA format and each sequence
is processed independently of each other on individual linuX cluster
nodes. Up to 500 queries per request are supported. The following

Fig. 1. Workflow and visualization example. (a) Primary sequence is used as input and transmembrane (gray), low complexity (magenta), and coiled-coil (green)
regions are predicted. (b) HMMER3 scan against Pfam database is executed and first domain architecture is built. (c—e) HHblits followed by HHsearch is executed
against (c) Pfam, (d) PDB and (e) CDD databases. (f) Domain coverage option: gray background represents the whole length of model whereas red bar displays
the portion of the model that aligns with the query. Square points represent the domain positions that do not align with the query. (9) Alignment option.
Sequence is displayed to scale, and each bar stands for alignment quality at that position. The absence of the bar at a given position indicates gap in the align-

ment on query side

domain search methods are implemented in CDvist: HMMER3
(Eddy, 2011), RPS-BLAST (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2013; Schaffer
et al., 1999), HHSEARCH (Soding, 2005), and HHBLITS-
HHSEARCH (Remmert et al., 2012). Transmembrane regions are
predicted by either TMHMM (Sonnhammer et al., 1998) or Phobius
(Kall et al., 2007). Low complexity and coiled coil regions are pre—
dicted by SEG (Wootton, 1994) and Coils (Lupas, 1996) respect—
ively. To improve domain coverage, rather than using the entire
sequence, CDvist iteratively identifies regions without significant
domain match (orphan segments) and submits each one of them to
similarity search against a user—determined sequence of databases
until the entire protein sequence is covered or all databases have
been searched (Fig. 1). The key principle of this process is that tools
that have high specificity—HMMER against Pfam and RPS-BLAST
against CDD—are used first. Only then, the sequence segments that
were not confidently matched to any model are used to build pro—
files and subjected to more sensitive profile—profile searches by
HHsearch. Each algorithm can be turned on/off and the order of
databases, and their significance thresholds, can be altered. This
ﬂexibility enables users to tailor the overall process for their specific
purposes. Optional ‘domain split’ function splits the matched do—
main model if there is a considerable unaligned query region (5% by
default) in the query—model alignment. This unaligned region is con-
sidered as an orphan segment and is used in the next run to search
for potential domains.

A custom built JavaScript module powers the visualization on
the client side with images in vector format (SVG) that are practical
to edit, export as PDF and produce figures of publication quality.
Results are displayed asynchronously for each query sequence sub—
mitted, which also allows the user to interact with the data before
the completion of the entire request. Domain coverage bar provides
information on what portion of the matched domain model is repre—
sented on the query sequence (Fig. 1f). Alignment quality is repre-
sented as vertical bar for each position of the alignment. Gaps in the
alignment indicate that the corresponding part of the query is not

aligned with the model (Fig. 1g). Scaled sequence information is
mapped on the domain architecture, which is easily retrievable by
zooming in on the browser. Drag feature allows user to align desired
parts of batch data for further analysis. All this information is
hosted in our webserver for over a week with a unique URL.
Alternatively, the user can retrieve the HTML file to control the
interactive feature visualizations locally on a web—browser. JSON
formatted files containing the information used to draw the graphics
in the website are available not only for each individual sequences
but also for the entire input set as a single file. Finally, the log files
for each run are available, which display the raw output of the
whole process. Logs provide extra information on less significant
hits which are not displayed visually. The databases are updated
immediately upon their release.

3 Discussion

CDvist is designed to provide maximum domain coverage in protein
sequences by bundling the best current domain search tools into a
pipeline that exhaustively searches through a series of domain data—
bases in an iterative fashion. This methodology yields the most com—
prehensive domain architecture for a given protein sequence. Rich
visualization, download options and linear speed—up for bulk queries
should be appealing to both biologists and bioinformaticians. This
webserver would be especially useful for multi—domain proteins with
rare or unique domain architectures and those prone to domain
swap, where whole sequence similarity searches often yield unin-
formative and misleading results (Iyer et al., 2001).

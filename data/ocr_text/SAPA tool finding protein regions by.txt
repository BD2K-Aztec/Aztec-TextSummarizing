ABSTRACT

Summary: Functional modules within protein sequences are often
extracted by consensus sequence patterns representing a linear
motif; however, other functional regions may only be described by
combined features such as amino acid composition, profiles of
amino acid properties and randomly distributed short sequence
motifs. If only a small number of functional examples are well char-
acterized, the researcher needs a tool to extract similar sequences for
further investigation.

Availability and Implementation: We provide the web application
‘SAPA tool’, which allows the user to search with combined proper-
ties, ranks the extracted target regions by an integrated score, esti-
mates false discovery rates by using decoy sequences and provides
them as a sequence file or spreadsheet. Source code, user manual
and the web application implemented in Perl, HTML, CSS and
JavaScript and running on Apache are freely available at http://sapa—
tool.uio.no/sapa/

1 INTRODUCTION

Finding functional regions in protein sequences is an important
annotation task. Although many features of proteins are
encoded by interacting amino acid residues positioned apart
from each other in sequence, some exist as linear motifs repre-
sented by a continuous stretch of residues. Estimations for
eukaryotes assume that such linear regions cover up to 30% of
all protein sequences (Dunker et al., 2008). They have diverse
functions in protein folding, protein complex assembly, protein—
protein interactions, ligand binding, signalling and as sites of
post-translational modiﬁcations (Dunker et al., 2008; Fuxreiter
et al., 2007).

Many such sites may be extracted with distinct sequence
patterns, simple or complex rules for amino acid neighbourhoods
or position-speciﬁc matrices, which describe a speciﬁc amino
acid sequence and its allowed variations, as collected by the
INTERPRO (Hunter et al., 2009) or the PROSITE database
(Hulo et al., 2008; Sigrist et al., 2010). Functional regions may

also be predicted by a speciﬁc amino acid composition and
similarity to a scaled amino acid proﬁle or index, which deﬁnes
for each residue a weight for being part of a sequence with a
speciﬁc property. Such scaled proﬁles are collected by the
AAINDEX database (Kawashima and Kanehisa, 2000;
Kawashima et al., 2008) and may be applied by seaming tools
like the application pepwindow of the EMBOSS program suite
(Rice et al., 2000).

In silico identiﬁcation and analysis of hydroxyproline-rich
glycoproteins from Arabidopis thaliana were recently performed
by the BIO-OHIO software, a tool, which combines the searches
for regions of biased amino acid composition (e.g. 50% PAST)
and that for repeated small patterns like AP, PA, SP and TP
(Showalter et al., 2010).

A functional region may also be characterized by low
complexity because of stretches of the same amino acid or the
repeated occurrence of short sequence motifs as compiled by the
RepSeq database (Depledge et al., 2007). Regions having a spe-
ciﬁc amino acid composition may be mapped using the oddcomp
application of EMBOSS or generally searched for by the
software SEG Mootoon and Federhen, 1993).

Although there are several servers and tools separately per-
forming proﬁling sequences using amino acid scales, analysis of
amino acid composition and scanning motifs, there is no appli-
cation that combines all three search strategies in a ﬂexible way.
We programmed, therefore, the web application ‘SAPA tool’,
where the user can upload protein sequences, search with com-
bined strategies and download the found and scored target
sequences. It was named after a typical overrepresented motif
(SAPA) in bacterial glycopeptides of Neisseria gornorrhoeae,
for which it was ﬁrst programmed.

For demonstration, we used the SAPA tool for retrieving the
possibly 0-glycosylated sequence regions from proteins of
M ycobacterium tuberculosis (see Supplementary information).
Starting from 21 known examples, the tool was used to extract
putative target regions having glycopeptide-like composition
from the proteome of M .tuberculosis H37Rv (Camus et al.,
2002; Cole et al., 1998).

2 FEATURES

Protein sequences are imported from an uploaded multiple
sequence ﬁle (FASTA format), from the NCBI protein database
or from pasted sequences, which may alternatively be used as

control sequences. The region of the proteins to be scanned may
be restricted. The set minimum size of the target sequence has to
comply with all settings. Overlapping or adjoining targets will
be fused.

Three decoy methods (riﬁled, shufﬂed, reversed) allow the user
to make a set of decoy sequences, which are scanned together
with the imported proteins for estimation of a cumulative local
false discovery rate (FDR) (Elias et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2009).
The FDR for a speciﬁc target score is two times the observed
number of decoy targets above or equal to that score, divided by
the number of all observed targets above or equal to that score.
Although the reversed method conserves local amino acid com-
position completely, the random method would scramble it;
however, it removes the natural sequence redundancy and under-
estimates the FDR. We designed a rifﬂing method, which mixes
the sequence analogous to the rifﬂed shufﬂe of a stack of playing
cards, mostly conserves sequence redundancy and destroys local
amino acid composition (for details see the programs decoy help
ﬁle, manual and the supplement).

The user selects minimum occurrence percentages for up to six
single amino acids or three groups of related amino acids, which
must be found in selected target sequences.

Up to three scaled AAINDEX amino acid proﬁles can be used
for scoring and/or selecting target sequences, which can be set to
remain below or above a speciﬁed mean score value.

Targets are also optionally selected depending on their motif
content. The motifs are deﬁned by an extended version of the
PROSITE pattern syntax (Hulo et al., 2008; Sigrist et al., 2010),
and are combined with ‘AND’, ‘NOT’ or ‘OR’ operators.

Each target sequence is scored by the information content of
each amino acid matched by a composition setting, the scores of
the appropriately re-scaled and weighted AAINDEX scales and
the information content of the deﬁned motifs. Details of the
scoring scheme are described in the manual and the supplement.
The scores of each protein are the sum score of their target
scores.

The result screen summarizes the applied search settings, the
scoring scheme and target/protein extraction results. A result
table shows all targets sorted by their scores and contains protein
sequence icons with highlighted target regions, where the scores
are encoded by different colour intensities. When clicking on an
icon, a pop-up window shows the sequence with the highlighted
regions. All setting and result tables may be downloaded as a
multiple Excel spreadsheet ﬁle and protein sequences as a
FASTA-formatted sequence ﬁle.

The SAPA tool enables easy subsetting of any protein list
using compositional, proﬁle and motif data, scores the targets
appropriately and estimates their FDR. The example provided in
the Supplementary information shows how the SAPA tool can
extract sequences with properties derived from 0-glycosylated
peptides. Often, only a few experimentally conﬁrmed example
sequences are available. Similar sequences, when extracted, can
be experimentally investigated for more information, which
allows a new and better informed round of sequence retrieval
by the SAPA tool. For example, mass-spectrometric analysis of
fragmented peptide ions provides quantitative information on

their amino acid composition via their immonium ions; this
information can be used to extract the respective subset of
sequences, resulting in higher conﬁdence levels for peptide iden-
tiﬁcation. More usage examples and references for them are
described in Section 4 of the Supplementary Data.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The web application was written in Perl, HTML, CSS and
J avaScript and runs on a web server enabled for Perl CGI (e. g.
Apache) (http://sapa-tool.uio.no/sapa/). Images of sequence
icons are dynamically produced by the Perl GD package, spread-
sheet ﬁles by Spreadsheet::WriteExcel. The online manual offers
usage examples and screen views. The application can be
downloaded and installed locally, as described in the manual.

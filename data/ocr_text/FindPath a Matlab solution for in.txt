ABSTRACT

Summary: Several methods and computational tools have been de-
veloped to design novel metabolic pathways. A major challenge is
evaluating the metabolic efficiency of the designed pathways in the
host organism. Here we present FindPath, a unified system to predict
and rank possible pathways according to their metabolic efficiency in
the cellular system. This tool uses a chemical reaction database to
generate possible metabolic pathways and exploits constraint-based
models (CBMs) to identify the most efficient synthetic pathway to
achieve the desired metabolic function in a given host microorganism.
FindPath can be used with common tools for CBM manipulation and
uses the standard SBML format for both input and output files.

1 INTRODUCTION

Broadening the spectrum of compounds that microorganisms are
able to convert into biomass or other valuable products is at-
tracting increasing interest in biotechnology and synthetic biol-
ogy. Metabolic pathways are introduced in the organism to
enable the conversion of the desired compound into host metab-
olites, which, in turn, can be further converted into biomass or
other valuable products. Computational tools are already avail-
able to design such pathways, using the large repertoire of reac-
tions and pathways found in the microbial world, or from
novel—synthetic—reactions, or combinations of both. These
tools use different strategies to identify all possible metabolic
pathways able to support the desired metabolic function and
to select the most suitable among the many possibilities. To
search for all possible pathways, methods such as F MM (Chou
et al., 2009) and DESHARKY (Rodrigo et al., 2008) rely on
databases of known chemical reactions and compounds, whereas
BNICE, RDM and others capture all biochemical transform-
ations in the form of reaction rules extracted from known bio-
chemical reactions (Finley et al., 2009; Medema et al., 2012; Oh
et al., 2007). Alternatively, Retropath (Carbonell et al., 2011)

uses a molecular signature-based approach. The best pathway(s)
are then identiﬁed using algorithms allowing to rank all the path-
ways generated based on scoring criteria such as thermodynamic
feasibility, pathway length, energetic costs, genetic loads, etc.
(Medema et al., 2012). However, the metabolic efficiency of
the identiﬁed pathways in the host metabolism is rarely included
in scoring criteria despite its critical importance (Medema et al.,
2012). Here we introduce FindPath, a standardized framework
for the prediction of metabolic pathways enabling the conversion
of one or more novel compounds into any host metabolite. The
tool combines a database of all reactions associated with the
metabolism of the novel compound, a constraint-based model
(CBM) of the host organism, and tools to explore, prioritize
and score metabolic pathways. Pathways are scored based on
both topological feature (i.e. pathway length) and metabolic ef-
ﬁciency in the host organism, thus making it possible to tackle
pathway design from a quantitative and functional point of view.
FindPath is an easy-to-use Matlab package to streamline the
design of novel synthetic pathways. Finally, FindPath predicts
and ranks pathways in a single package that can be run in a
couple of minutes.

2 FINDPATH WORKFLOW

2.1 Implementation

FindPath is implemented in Matlab, a programming language
that is widely used in the metabolic modeling community, and
requires minimal user programming skills. F indPath integrates
existing tools for CBM manipulation, i.e. COBRA-Toolbox
(Becker et al., 2007) and EFMTool (Klamt and Gilles, 2004),
as well as novel functions for the design of metabolic pathways.
Such implementation allows to beneﬁt from additional tools
included in the COBRA-Toolbox and required by our method
[i.e. ﬂux balance analysis (F BA)]. All are then incorporated into
a single platform. F indPath can use different ﬁle formats, includ-
ing CSV, SBML (i.e. the standard format in system biology
modeling) (Hucka et al., 2003) and the COBRA-toolbox
format. It also includes a function to convert CSV ﬁles into
other ﬁle formats. Errors during import and export of data
and ﬁles are reduced to a minimum, and exploitation of the
workﬂow is facilitated for beginners. Finally, F indPath can be
easily integrated into more complex and evolved workﬂows using
other Matlab CBM-dedicated methods or tools that use the

SBML format. A user manual is provided in Supplementary
Materials.

A schematic diagram of the computational workﬂow of
F indPath is given in Supplementary Figure S1 and is described
step by step in the following sections.

2.2 Creation of the substrate-associated reaction database

F indPath requires a dedicated substrate-associated reaction
(SAR) database including all the reactions and processes
involved in the metabolic conversion of the compound of interest
(see Supplementary Fig. S1A). This information can be extracted
from metabolic databases such as MetaCyc (Karp et al., 2002) or
KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2008) or from the literature. The SAR
database can be generated manually (See Supplementary Data).
The reactions included in the database must be balanced, generic
reactions must be instanced and reversibility of each reaction
must be given. To ensure full compatibility between the different
tools, the identiﬁers of metabolites and reactions in the SAR
database and in the host organism CBM must be uniﬁed and
must respect the COBRA-toolbox formalism.

2.3 Prediction of possible pathways

FindPath predicts possible pathways capable of converting the
novel compound into any host metabolites by elementary ﬂux
mode (EFM) analysis (Klamt and Stelling, 2003). To this end,
the information contained in the SAR database is converted into
an SAR model (see Supplementary Fig. SlB and Supplementary
Materials). The resulting SAR model is then converted by
FindPath into the EFMTool format (Klamt and Gilles, 2004)
by linking all equivalent ﬁelds (stoichiometric matrix, list of re-
actions list of reactions list, reversibility, etc.). The input metab-
olite is the novel compound to be converted. The output
metabolites are all host metabolites, but a subset of host metab-
olites can be speciﬁed as output metabolites when appropriate
(e.g. to exclude cofactors or undesired intermediates). All the
resulting EF Ms enabling the conversion of the novel compounds
into a host metabolite are considered as possible solutions. Using
this process, both naturally occurring pathways and pathways
resulting from novel combinations of reactions—i.e. synthetic
pathways—can be predicted.

2.4 Prioritization of pathways

Depending on the number of reactions in the SAR database, the
number of pathways predicted by F indPath may increase dra-
matically. F indPath makes it possible to prioritize the different
pathways based on two criteria: the length of the pathway and
the metabolite composition of the pathway (see Supplementary
Fig. S1C). Short pathways reduce both the genetic effort needed
to construct the strain and the energetic costs related to the bio-
synthesis and maintenance of enzymes (Medema et al., 2012).
The second criterion helps prioritize pathways according to
metabolic considerations, e. g. selecting pathways containing me-
tabolites of interest or discarding pathways containing toxic
compounds. The pathways selected during this step are kept
for the next step.

2.5 Ranking of selected pathways

For each pathway selected, F indPath creates a speciﬁc pathway/
organism CBM by incorporating the pathway reactions into the
genome-scale model of the selected host. Constraints on these
newly added reactions (i.e. upper and lower bound of the ﬂux)
can be set by the user or an arbitrary range can be automatically
applied by the COBRA-Toolbox functions. For each model,
FBA is performed after an objective function corresponding to
the desired metabolic capability (e.g. production of biomass or
product of interest, etc.) has been deﬁned in the model. To de-
termine the best trade-off between genetic effort and metabolic
efﬁciency, pathways are ranked based on a weighted score that
accounts for both pathway length (i.e. data obtained during the
previous step) and efﬁciency (i.e. results of the F BA) (see
Supplementary Fig. SlD and Supplementary Materials). The
weight of each parameter can be deﬁned by the user. This
allows long pathways with high productivity to be selected
over short pathways with low productivity. Results are exported
to SBML ﬁle to ensure the data produced are fully compatible
when incorporated in a larger workﬂow and in a log ﬁle. The
number of pathways to be exported can be speciﬁed by the user.

3 TEST CASE

As proof of concept, FindPath was used to select the best path-
ways to enable growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on D—xylose.
Although this sugar is one of the main monomers present in
lignocellulosic hydrolysates, S.cerevisiae is unable to grow on
or consume it (Kim et al., 2013). To achieve economically
viable ethanol production from lignocellulosic feedstocks, it is
essential to generate a pentose using yeast, and this is the focus
of many current studies. Starting with an SAR database of 29
reactions and a genome-scale model of 1412 reactions, i.e.
iMM904 (Zomorrodi and Maranas, 2010), FindPath was able
to identify 15 potential pathways in <1 min in an XEON E5410
(8 cores) and 16GB of RAM. Interestingly, the two pathways
with the highest scores matched the pathways (i.e. xylose isom-
erase and xylulose kinase (XK) or xylose reductase, xylitol de-
hydrogenase and XK) that were successfully used to obtain a
xylose-fermenting S.cerevisiae strain (Kim et al., 2013). More
details can be found in Supplementary Materials.

4 CONCLUSION

F indPath is a simple uniﬁed workﬂow for the in silico design of
pathways to convert novel compounds into any host metabolites.
F indPath rapidly identiﬁes the best solution but also alternative
solutions with topological and efﬁciency interest. It provides
additional features to the COBRA-Toolbox and can also be
used in addition—or in parallel—to other computational tools
that accept SBML formats. FindPath is a ﬂexible tool that can
be used for many purposes, including: (i) prediction of pathways
involved in the conversion of a carbon source that is not natur-
ally consumed by the host organism; (ii) design of degradation
pathways for the detoxiﬁcation of toxic compounds; (iii) cur-
ation of CBMs, by providing candidate pathways when experi-
mental evidence points to metabolic conversion, but the pathway
has not been identiﬁed; and (iv) choice among a large set of

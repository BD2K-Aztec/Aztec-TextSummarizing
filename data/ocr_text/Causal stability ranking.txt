ABSTRACT

Genotypic causes of a phenotypic trait are typically determined via
randomized controlled intervention experiments. Such experiments
are often prohibitive with respect to durations and costs, and inform-
ative prioritization of experiments is desirable. We therefore consider
predicting stable rankings of genes (covariates), according to their
total causal effects on a phenotype (response), from observational
data. Since causal effects are generally non-identifiable from observa-
tional data only, we use a method that can infer lower bounds for the
total causal effect under some assumptions. We validated our
method, which we call Causal Stability Ranking (CStaR), in two situ-
ations. First, we performed knock-out experiments with Arabidopsis
thaliana according to a predicted ranking based on observational gene
expression data, using flowering time as phenotype of interest.
Besides several known regulators of flowering time, we found
almost half of the tested top ranking mutants to have a significantly
changed flowering time. Second, we compared CStaR to established
regression-based methods on a gene expression dataset of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that CStaR outperforms these
established methods. Our method allows for efficient design and pri-
oritization of future intervention experiments, and due to its generality
it can be used for a broad spectrum of applications.

1 INTRODUCTION

The growing interest in causal inference (e.g. Kruglyak and
Storey, 2009) has increased the need not only for methods able
to handle this task but also for designed experimental validation.
It is of general interest to infer the genotypic causes of a complex
phenotypic trait (Glazier et al., 2002). The classical approach
relies on randomized controlled intervention experiments, e.g.
knocking out a gene and observing the effect on the phenotype

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

relative to the wild-type organism. However, such intervention
experiments are time consuming and expensive, and a prioritiza-
tion with respect to most informative new experiments is very
desirable. A genetic method to identify loci causing phenotypes
or gene expression patterns is based on quantitative trait loci
(QTL) and expression QTL (Gilad et al., 2008; Kliebenstein,
2009). This can be a very powerful approach but it is limited
to loci where genetic variation exists and to situations where
segregating progeny of control crosses is available. Often, how-
ever, it is desirable to predict causal effects from purely observa-
tional data. We therefore consider the problem of predicting
total causal effects from data obtained by observing a system
without subjecting it to targeted interventions (observational
data). This problem is generally ill-posed, but the recently pro-
posed IDA method (Maathuis et al., 2009, 2010) provides esti-
mated lower bounds of total causal effects from observational
data under some assumptions (Supplementary Section Sl).
However, these bounds come without a measure of uncertainty.
We address this issue by introducing a new method combining
IDA and a version of stability selection (Meinshausen and
Buhlmann, 2010), which we call Causal Stability Ranking
(CStaR; Fig. l). The addition of stability selection to IDA pro-
vides two advantages. First, CStaR leads to a stable ranking of
genes (covariates) according to the sizes of lower bounds for their
predicted total causal effects, irrespective of the choice of the
tuning parameter in stability selection. Second, under some add-
itional assumptions, CStaR allows controlling an error rate of
false-positive findings, namely the expected number of false posi-
tives and hence also the per-comparison error rate (PCER).
CStaR results were confirmed in two biological scenarios using
the simple model Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the more com-
plex model Arabidopsis thaliana. Together, the built-in error
measure and the success in finding relevant regulator genes
make CStaR an excellent ranking method for the targeted
design of experiments based on easily available resources.

2 METHODS

Based on observational training data and a set of required assumptions,
CStaR predicts a lower bound for the total causal effect of a covariate on
a response of interest, including a PCER for the false-positive selections.
This is achieved by combining IDA (Section 2.1) with a version of sta-
bility selection (Section 2.2) on a range of different parameters. Predicted

Fig. 1. Schematic overview of the methodological framework used in CStaR. After pre—processing the data (Step 1), lower bounds for the total causal
effects are estimated 100 times using stability selection (Meinshausen and Biihlmann, 2010) according to the following procedure. A subsample of size
Lit/2] is repeatedly drawn from the total of n pre-processed data points (Step 2). On each subsample (or stability run), lower bounds for the total causal
effects are estimated using IDA (Maathuis et al., 2009) and used to rank the genes (Step 3, Section 2.1). Next, for a range of different q-values, we record
the relative frequencies over the 100 stability runs that each gene appeared in the top q ranks (Section 2.2). The median rank over these different qs is used
to generate the ﬁnal ranking of the genes (Step 4). Furthermore, under additional assumptions, an upper bound for the PCER is estimated for each
q-value and its corresponding relative frequency (Section 2.3). Finally, the gene ranking allows for design of new experiments. Thus, a biological
validation using intervention experiments can be performed. We tested CStaR in two situations. First, on a publicly available compendium of 31 natural
A. thaliana accessions consisting of n = 47 gene expression measurements, each with 21,326 genes and corresponding ﬂowering time data (Lempe et al.,
2005; Supplementary Section S2.l). We performed biological intervention experiments according to the causal gene ranking (Table l) by focusing on
candidates that were not already known to control ﬂowering time and for which mutant seeds were readily available (Supplementary Section S2.3). The
biological experiments were analyzed using a two-sample Welch’s t—test (Supplementary Section S2.4). The second validation was performed on a
publicly available dataset in S. cerevisiae containing 11 = 63 observational and 234 interventional full-genome expression proﬁles, with p = 5,361 genes
(Hughes et al., 2000; Supplementary Section S3). Since this dataset includes both observational and interventional data, the validation was analyzed by
comparing estimated total causal effects based on the observational data with inferred effects from the interventional data (Fig. 2)

total causal effects are ranked according to their stability aggregated over index corresponding to the top rank, jg for the second best rank and
this range (Section 2.3). so on:

2.1 Causal inference when the directed acyclic graph
(DAG) is absent (IDA)

The IDA procedure (Maathuis et al., 2009) is a statistical method
that infers lower bounds for the absolute values of total causal effects on a
response of interest from observational data under the assumption that
the data come from an unknown DAG without hidden variables.
Suppose we have a dataset with n observations consisting of a response
and p explanatory variables. Denoting by 9- (j = 1,. . . , p), the true total
causal effect of gene (covariate) j to the response (the total causal effect 6]-
can be interpreted as follows: a change of gene j by one unit (one standard
deviation) causes an average change of size 9- in the response), the output
of IDA is the estimated lower bound 6].. It is shown (Maathuis et 611.,

Under the assumption that the data come from an unknown DAG with-
out hidden variables, the true total causal effect 9- is generally
non-identiﬁable from observational data, but lower bounds are. The con-
ceptual idea for constructing lower bounds is as follows (Maathuis et al.,
2009). We ﬁrst infer the so-called Markov equivalence class of all the
DAGs (see Supplementary Section S1), which are compatible with the
observational data. Using intervention calculus (Pearl, 2000), we derive
all potential total causal effects based on each DAG G, in the equivalence
class (for every gene (covariate) j)

{6j;l’;r:19  19 ""p)’

2009) that under certain assumptions (Supplementary Section 1) and as
sample size 11 tends to inﬁnity:

(gin—3001319131 E lei
justifying the IDA procedure to infer lower bounds. These lower bounds
are conservative: for example, if the lower bound is equal to zero, we
would not make a statement that there is no causal effect (since the true
total causal effect could be indeed equal to zero, or it could be larger than
zero but the lower bound would not detect it). Based on the estimated
lower bounds, we obtain a ranking of genes (covariates) with jl being the

 

9

and we deﬁne the true lower bounds as
t. = .Jiﬁnmlej;rl0 =1....,p>. <2>

Under our assumptions (see Supplementary Section S1), these (true)
lower bounds ,BJ- are identiﬁable from observational data, and the IDA
algorithm yields the estimates ,3]- (j = l, . . . , p). The main components of
the IDA method are the PC-algorithm for estimating the Markov equiva-
lence class of DAGs (Spirtes et al., 2000) and a local algorithm for
calculating the bounds ,8,- without enumerating all DAG members in
the estimated Markov equivalence class (Maathuis et al., 2009). It is

from the interventional data

this local algorithm that makes the inference of these lower bounds based
on thousands of genes (covariates) feasible. IDA is implemented in the
R-package pcalg (Kalisch et al., 2012).

2.2 Stability selection

CStaR incorporates a stability selection step (Meinshausen and
Biihlmann, 2010). We draw 100 independent random subsamples of
size 11/2 and we run IDA on the subsampled data. In each subsampling
run, which we also call stability run, we check whether gene (covariate) j
has appeared among the top q variables when using the ranking as in
equation (1) based on the subsampled data. We can then report the
relative selection frequency 1211-, among the 100 stability runs, that gene
(covariate) j has appeared (or been selected) among the top q variables.
These relative selection frequencies yield a stable list of genes (covariates):
the index j1 corresponds now to the most stably selected variable, and jp
to the least stable variable:

ﬁjzﬁzz...2ﬁp. 

Besides the increased stability in the ranking (3), stability selection is
controlling the expected number of false-positive selections. Deﬁne the
stably selected genes (covariates) as

Sstable = U; 1clj 2 77thr}:

for some threshold 0.5 < 71th, 5 1. Denote the wrongly selected genes (false
positives) by V: lSsmbge ﬂSfagsel, where Sfagse is the set of (false) genes
(covariates) whose true lower bound 131:0, see (2). Then, for a given
threshold 71,)” and a given value of q [which inﬂuences (3)] we have,
assuming an exchangeability condition (see Supplementary Section S1;
Meinshausen and Biihlmann, 2010):

q2

E <——
[W—Zﬂthr_1p

(4)

and this leads to a bound for the PCER (PCER=E[V]/p). If a gene
(covariate) j has relative selection frequency H], a bound for the corres-
ponding PCER is given by

1 q2
2ftj — 1p2

 

2.3 Summary ranking

As novelty, we avoid choosing a speciﬁc q for the execution of stability
selection by assessing the stability and the rank of each gene on a range of
different q-values. This constitutes the main modiﬁcation of the standard
stability selection scheme and it also constitutes a useful simpliﬁcation for
the practitioner. This can be summarized graphically (Supplementary Fig.
S1 gives an example for a single gene in the A. thaliana validation). We
found that CStaR is relatively insensitive to the choice of the range of qs.
However, down to a certain lower bound, small values of q lead to higher
sensitivity and thus better results (see also Supplementary Section S3). If
the q-values fall below such a lower bound, the ranking becomes unstable
again. Finally, all genes are ranked according to the median rank with
respect to the different q-values. Ties in the ﬁnal ranking are sorted ac-
cording to median total causal effect size.

2.4 Validation

We validated CStaR in two situations. First, we trained CStaR on a
publicly available compendium of A. thaliana gene expression data and
performed new biological validation experiments (Supplementary Section
S2). The compendium contains 47 expression proﬁles of natural acces-
sions from diverse geographic origins (Lempe et al., 2005). The pheno-
typic trait of interest is time to ﬂowering, which is robustly measured by
the number of days to bolting or the number of rosette leaves formed
before bolting (Amasino, 2010). Timing of ﬂowering according to
local climatic conditions is a major determinant of the plants’ repro-
ductive success and an important agronomical trait that greatly
affects yield. Therefore, an improved knowledge about genes controlling
ﬂowering time is of substantial economic value (Craufurd and Wheeler,
2009).

As a second validation of the CStaR method, we compared it with the
plain IDA method [ranking as in (1)], Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), elastic net
(Zou and Hastie, 2005) both using linear models (ranking according to
absolute values of estimated regression coefﬁcients) and marginal correl-
ation (ranking according to absolute values of marginal correlation to the
response) on a publicly available dataset of gene expression proﬁles in S.
cerevisiae (Hughes et al., 2000; Supplementary Section S3). This dataset
includes both observational and interventional data obtained under simi-
lar conditions. Hence, it forms an excellent basis to assess the perform-
ance of methods aimed at estimating total causal effects from
observational data, as the effects estimated from the observational data
can be compared with the effects inferred from the interventional data.
These data were used to validate IDA (Maathuis et al., 2010), and we
followed the same approach to validate CStaR. In particular, we used the
interventional data to infer the total causal effects of the knock-out genes
on the remaining genes and deﬁned the top 5% of the effects that were
largest in absolute value as the true positives.

The genes are ranked by increasing summary rank, where ties are sorted according to the estimated median total causal effect taken over 100 stability runs (third column).
The maximum expression is taken over the original logz data. The error (PCER) is the median PCER over the range of q values. SOC], FRI and FLC are 3 of 119 curated
ﬂowering time genes in the Arabidopsis Reactome (Tsesmetzis et al., 2008) (http://www.arabidopsisreactome.org). This is a highly signiﬁcant enrichment of known curated
regulators when compared with random guessing (p < 105, hypergeometric test). Although not curated in Arabidopsis Reactome, also RPAZB and DWF4 are known to affect
ﬂowering time (Domagalska et al., 2007; Xia et al., 2006). Since the ordering of the genes in the table is given by their summary rank, the values of median total causal effect
and PCER are not decreasing monotonously. For instance, AT S UC6 has a smaller median total causal effect and a larger PCER than the endonuclease, but since its lower
bound for the total causal effect is more stable, the former is ranked 10 positions higher than the latter. All genes from this list, for which mutant seeds were readily available
and which were not already known to control ﬂowering time, were used in the subsequent intervention experiments (indicated in bold). In total, intervention experiments were
performed for 13 of the 25 top genes not previously known to regulate ﬂowering (Supplementary Section S23).

Arabidopsis Reactome (Tsesmetzis et al., 2008) containing 119
known regulators of ﬂowering. This is a highly signiﬁcant en-
richment of known curated regulators when compared with
random guessing (j)<10’5 in a hypergeometric test).
Interestingly, FLC and FRI are not only major regulators of
ﬂowering time in the model species A. thaliana but also in the
oil-seed rape crop.

Among the other genes in the top 25, which were not already
known to play a role in ﬂowering time, there were 13 genes for
which mutant seeds were readily available (Supplementary Table
S1). These mutants were used for intervention experiments in
order to further validate CStaR and to discover new inﬂuential
genes for ﬂowering time in A. thaliana (Supplementary Section
S23).

The intervention experiments were performed under two
photoperiod conditions, short-day (SD) and long-day (LD)
with 8 h and 16 h of light, respectively. As phenotypic responses,
the number of days to bolting (DTB, for both SD and LD) as
well as the rosette leave number (RLN, only for LD) were re-
corded. Seed viability varied between different genotypes

(Supplementary Tables S2—S4) reducing the number of testable
mutants to nine (Supplementary Table S1).

Differences between the knock-out and control group were
tested using a two-sided Welch’s t—test, because the mutant sam-
ples showed different empirical variances compared with the con-
trol group. This is most pronounced in the short-day layout.
Four new genes were found to have a signiﬁcant total causal
effect on the phenotypic responses at level 052005 in at least
one of the three settings (Table 2). Among the signiﬁcant genes is
OTLDI, a gene involved in chromatin modiﬁcations, which may
potentially regulate FLC expression. Another signiﬁcant gene is
PDH—EI, which is involved in carbohydrate metabolism, a
known regulation point of ﬂowering time. We did not adjust
these p-values for multiple testing because we only perform a
small number of tests and, in view of small sample sizes, we do
not want to sacriﬁce power. Future studies of the identiﬁed novel
genes may increase the biological understanding of ﬂowering
time control and provide potential targets for breeding strategies
in crops. The entire approach from modelling to biological ex-
periments and ﬁndings is schematically described in Figure l.

3.2 Validation for S. cerevisiae

We trained the plain IDA method, Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996),
elastic net (Zou and Hastie, 2005) and marginal correlation rank-
ing on the observational data, and compared their receiver oper-
ating characteristic curves on absolute scale (Fig. 2) showing a
clear improvement of CStaR over plain IDA. Moreover, CStaR
and IDA are clearly superior to high-dimensional regression
methods and marginal correlation screening, which is in line
with the earlier validation of IDA (Maathuis et at, 2010).

4 DISCUSSION

We propose CStaR as a general method to obtain a stable rank-
ing of genes in terms of the strengths of their total causal effects
on a phenotype of interest. An added value of our method is
that, under some assumptions, this ranking comes with an error
measure controlling false-positive selections. We showed that
CStaR exhibits a large increase in sensitivity when compared
with plain IDA and modern regression-type methods in S. cere-
visiae (Fig. 2). Moreover, we demonstrated the success of CStaR
for the biologically much more complex multicellular organism
A. thaliana. However, in view of uncheckable assumptions
(Supplementary Section S1), CStaR is not a tool for conﬁrma-
tory causal inference.

We used insertion mutant lines for experimental validation.
This approach can provide very strong evidence for hypotheses
about gene function but it often suffers from a high
false-negative rate. Genetic networks are characterized by a
high degree of functional redundancy, which can buffer effects
of single mutations. The A. thaliana genome, for instance, under-
went a relatively recent duplication causing partial redundancy
between many orthologous gene pairs. Thus, often double mu-
tants need to be tested to observe alterations in phenotype.
In addition, the function of essential genes cannot be tested

with insertion mutants. Therefore, the high proportion of con-
ﬁrmation in the test set of insertion mutants is highly reassuring.
This makes it plausible that CStaR is relevant for commercial
crops, by pointing to better target genes for marker-assisted
breeding and transgenic approaches. In fact since CStaR is math-
ematically justiﬁed under clearly stated assumptions (Maathuis
et at, 2009; Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2010), it has the po-
tential to generalize many other settings in biology, agriculture
and other ﬁelds where efﬁcient design and prioritization of new
intervention experiments is a core aim.

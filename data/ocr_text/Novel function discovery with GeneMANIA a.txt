ABSTRACT

Motivation: The model bacterium Escherichia coli is among the best
studied prokaryotes, yet nearly half of its proteins are still of unknown
biological function. This is despite a wealth of available large-scale
physical and genetic interaction data. To address this, we extended
the GeneMANIA function prediction web application developed for
model eukaryotes to support E.coli.

Results: We integrated 48 distinct E.coli functional interaction data-
sets and used the GeneMANIA algorithm to produce thousands of
novel functional predictions and prioritize genes for further functional
assays. Our analysis achieved cross-validation performance compar-
able to that reported for eukaryotic model organisms, and revealed
new functions for previously uncharacterized genes in specific biopro-
cesses, including components required for cell adhesion, iron—sulphur
complex assembly and ribosome biogenesis. The GeneMANIA ap-
proach for network-based function prediction provides an innovative
new tool for probing mechanisms underlying bacterial bioprocesses.

1 INTRODUCTION

As the primary model organism for microbial biology, Escherichia
coli has been studied for decades using countless large- and small-
scale biochemical assays of gene function. More recently, the
physical (protein—protein) and functional (gene—gene or epistatic)
relationships between Ecoli genes have been extensively studied
by our group (Hu et al., 2009; Babu et al., 2011a, 2014;
Rajagopala et al., 2014) and others (Arifuzzaman et al., 2006;
Typas et al., 2008) in the hopes of understanding the entire

complement of biological pathways in a prokaryotic organism.
These studies have revealed much of the physical and functional
organization of the E. coli bacterial proteome. However, as many
of the low-throughput studies were particularly concerned with
speciﬁc, smaller groups of genes, and the larger scale studies were
conducted using methodologies that inherently enrich for certain
physical (i.e. transient versus more stable protein interactions) or
genetic interactions, defining a single pathway level map of E. coli
function can be problematic. Complicating matters further is the
inherent difficulty in querying, navigating, and visualizing such
complex biological networks in a meaningful way as each study
only identiﬁes part of the map and is idiosyncratically biased.
Thus, despite rapid progress, we are far from understanding the
biological roles and functional relationships of the 4247 Ecoli
genes from an integrated ‘systems’ perspective. As~45% (1925
of 4247) of this organism’s genome (i.e. K-l2 W3110) still remains
functionally unannotated, methods more sensitive at interpreting
existing data appear warranted.

Underlying this disconnect between the volume of data avail-
able and the lack of annotation is a paucity of user friendly tools
for the accurate and automatic inference of a gene’s function.
While many gene function prediction systems based on func-
tional interaction networks exist (Alexeyenko and
Sonnhammer, 2009), few are readily available for prokaryotes
[e.g. eNet (Hu et al., 2009); ECID (Andres Leon et al., 2009);
STRING (Franceschini et al., 2013)], and none consider the
breadth of evidence supporting functional interactions available
today, such as phenomics and epistatic interactions, which have
only recently become available.

Here, we extend the GeneMANIA resource to support Ecoli
(Mostafavi et al., 2008; Zuberi et al., 2013) for gene function
prediction. We validate novel predictions supporting a role in
iron (Fe) - sulphur (S) cluster binding, cell adhesion and riboso-
mal protein degradation and biogenesis for more than half a
dozen uncharacterized (orphaned) Ecoli genes. An online imple-
mentation of GeneMANIA including all Ecoli biological

Novel function discovery with GeneMANIA

 

networks used to generate our predictions has been made pub-
lically available (www.genemania.org), and we have also created
a stand-alone program and plugin for the Cytoscape network
visualization environment (Shannon et al., 2003; Montojo
et al., 2010). We ﬁnd that integration of these Ecoli datasets
into a single uniﬁed network using GeneMANIA furthers our
understanding of how bacterial components are connected in
complexes and pathways, and enables functional prediction of
previously uncharacterized or under-characterized bacterial gene
products.

2 METHODS

2.1 E.coli (K-12) genomes and biological networks

Since Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets (see Supplementary
Methods for details), protein domains, coexpression and all experimental
interactions were generated in the K-12 genomes of W3110 or MG1655
(which are highly similar), for gene function prediction, we merged the
gene identiﬁers from both these genomes, generating a non-redundant
dataset of 4455 genes (excluding insertion sequence elements). In total,
48 biological networks from various literature sources were compiled for
function prediction, which are currently displayed on the GeneMANIA.

2.2 Validation

GeneMANIA performance was evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation on
each Gene Ontology (GO) annotation category (GO gene sets were
downloaded from go_daily-termdb.obo-xml.gz; dated 2013-12-03). In
each instance, true examples were withheld proteins with the correspond-
ing annotation, and negative examples were all other proteins. Cross-
validation and area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic)
curve (AUC) was computed using the ‘Network Assessor’ component
of the GeneMANIA command line tool (Montojo et al., 2010). To
gauge the contribution of each feature to overall prediction performance,
networks were withheld and average AUC and error rate estimated
across all GO annotations.

2.3 Fe-S cluster, ribosome and adhesion function
prediction

The query gene derived subnetwork corresponding to the selected process
was generated using the GeneMANIA plugin (Montojo et al., 2010) for
Cytoscape (Shannon 61 al., 2003), available from the Cytoscape App
Store (Lotia et al., 2013). Relative network weightings were determined
using the GeneMANIA web interface.

2.4 Bacterial strains and media

Strains used were either the wild-type E.coli K-12 BW25113 or single gene
deletion mutant strains marked with a kanamycin resistance marker from
the Keio knockout library (Baba et al., 2006) for validation experiments.
Mutant strains were streaked onto Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates sup-
plemented with 30 ug/ml kanamycin and incubated at 37°C overnight to
obtain single colonies.

2.5 Growth curves

Overnight cultures of wild-type and mutant strains prepared from single
colonies were inoculated in LB supplemented with either no antibiotic,
6 ug/ml streptomycin, 0.5 ug/ml tetracycline, 750 uM reduced L-glutathi-
one, 250 uM 2, 2’ -dipyridyl or a combination, as indicated, at an OD600
of ~0.01. Concentrations of additives were based on analogous recently
conducted experiments (Wong et al., 2014). Cultures were grown in
Bioscreen C (Growth curves) honeycomb 100-well plates in 200 ul

volumes at 37°C and the turbidity of the cultures was measured using
the wide-band ﬁlter (450—580nm) at 15-min intervals.

2.6 Degradation of ribosomal proteins, ribosomal proﬁles
and translation ﬁdelity

The reaction mixture used for degradation assays contained 1.2 uM ClpP,
3.9 uM substrate and an ATP regeneration system (13 units/ml of creatine
kinase and 16mM creatine phosphate) in buffer containing 25 mM
HEPES (pH 7.5), 5mM MgClz, 5mM KCl, 0.03% (w/v) Tween 20
and 10% glycerol. Components were incubated at 37°C for 3 min
before adding 1.0 uM Cle to start the reaction. At given time points,
aliquots were withdrawn and mixed with 4X Laemmli buffer to stop the
reaction. Proteins were then resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and visualized
by Coomassie staining.

The S30 crude extracts were loaded on linear sucrose density gradients
as described (Jiang et al., 2007), with 40% sucrose used as cushion and
ribosomes or other complex subunits isolated by high-speed ultracentri-
fugation at 4°C for 16h as previously described (Campbell and Brown,
2008). Translational ﬁdelity of mutant strains expressed via reported ex-
pression plasmids was evaluated as previously described (Thompson
et al., 2002; Hu et al., 2009; Babu et al., 2011b).

2.7 Bioﬁlm assay

The bioﬁlm assay was performed as previously described (O’Toole et al.,
1999), with minor modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, 5 ul of overnight E.coli cultures
grown in LB at 32°C was added to sterile 96-well polystyrene dish con-
taining 100 pl of fresh LB medium supplemented with 0.45% glucose.
Culture dish was incubated overnight (~18 h) at 32°C, and the bioﬁlm
was stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 5 min. Excess crystal violet was
washed off with sterile water. An ethanol—acetone mixture (80:20) was
added to the wells to release the dye, and the bioﬁlm that adhered to the
surface of the well was imaged using a Canon digital camera. Bioﬁlm
formation was assessed by the intensity of residual coloration.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Networks supporting function prediction

We collected ﬁve types of E.coli GeneMANIA functional inter-
action networks: physical interactions, transcript coexpression,
genetic interactions, shared protein domains (SPDs) and ‘other’
networks inferred from genomic context and chemogenomic (i.e.
phenomic) proﬁles (Supplementary Table S1). Speciﬁcally, we
included 48 experimentally derived Ecoli biological networks,
from our group and others that span these evidence types. While
the physical interaction networks were unweighted, all remaining
network types were weighted by proﬁle correlation, wherein
higher correlations are more indicative of shared function
(Mostafavi et al., 2008). To evaluate the extent to which these
lines of evidence types overlapped, we counted the number of par-
allel edges (i.e. edges from different networks connected to the
same node pairs) in each supporting network (to a maximum of
50) for each gene in the Ecoli genome. More than 57 000 edges
were supported by several networks, while the majority (>800 000)
of edges existed in only a single network, or were only weakly
supported (i.e. with low edge weight; Supplementary Fig. S1).
Notably, coexpression contributed most (>500 000) of these
edges due to the large number of experiments included (33),
followed by networks derived from genetic screens (>145 000).
GeneMANIA uses the ‘guilt-by-association’ function predic-
tion approach (Oliver, 2000), wherein a user provides a ‘seed list’

of known related genes that is then extended to include other
genes that are predicted to share a similar function based on
overlapping connection within the biological networks
(Mostafavi et al., 2008). In the simplest mode of operation, the
user needs only to enter in a gene or genes of interest. In gen-
erating functional predictions, the GeneMANIA algorithm is
designed to automatically weight networks on the basis of rele-
vance to the query set. This weighting is calculated for each
query, so that network weights can vary based on user input.
These assigned network weights are provided to the user, so that
they may assess the relative predictive power of the biological
evidence types and the basis for each prediction.

3.2 Cross-validation and performance of
network categories

To assess the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of GeneMANIA in
making functional predictions in E .coli, we used 5-fold cross-val-
idation to measure its ability to correctly identify known func-
tionally annotated Ecoli genes given input genes possessing the
same functional annotation. These results were compared across
GeneMANIA score thresholds using AUC. The average error,
measured as l - AUC, across all GO biological process, cellular
component and molecular function annotations ranged from
0.10 for cellular component annotations to 0.15 for biological
process annotations (Fig. la), which is comparable to that
achieved with yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Mostafavi et al.,
2008). Moreover, comparison of function predictions derived
from STRING to GeneMANIA predictions indicated that
GeneMANIA achieved signiﬁcantly better performance
(Supplementary Table S2, see Supplementary Methods).

Next, we evaluated the contribution of each input network
type by individually excluding each type of network and re—eval—
uating overall performance (Fig. lb) using the GeneMANIA
network assessor function (Montojo, 2014). We ﬁnd that while
the SPD and other network types contribute substantially to the
overall predictive accuracy of the program, some networks ap-
peared to have little inﬂuence on average. However, this was not
the case for all GO terms. For example, physical interactions
contribute more substantial reductions in error for GO terms
such as ribosome assembly (Supplementary Table S3). This
underscores one of the principle beneﬁts of the GeneMANIA

algorithm: namely, its ability to adaptively weight evidence
based on the input genes.

3.3 Predicting gene function

To identify functions for Ecoli genes, we input genes by GO
annotation (assuming at least 10 genes per GO term) to
GeneMANIA using the command line tools available at http://
pages.genemania.org/tools/. The top 100 results were retrieved
for each GO term (Supplementary Table S4). To conﬁrm the
value of some of the higher ranking predictions, we focused ex-
perimental effort on functionally uncharacterized proteins that
were predicted to have a novel function. For example, Fe—S clus-
ter biogenesis proteins were found to be associated with three
uncharacterized proteins: Yan, thA and Yth (Fig. 2a). This
association was based largely on SPDs, coexpression and other
sources of evidence including large-scale phenomics data
(Nichols et al., 2011) (Fig. 2a). Since a large number of genes
that confer aminoglycoside sensitivity are involved in Fe—S clus-
ter biogenesis and aerobic respiration (Kohanski et al., 2007;
Babu et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014), we tested the sensitivity
of yan, )2th and )2th single mutants to sublethal concentra-
tions of streptomycin antibiotic. Both wild-type and single
mutant deletion strains exhibited similar growth curves in the
absence of antibiotic or in the presence of a non-aminoglycoside
(tetracycline) drug (Fig. 2a). However, at a sublethal dosage of
the aminoglycoside streptomycin, wild-type cells reached a lower
density of cells in stationary phase compared with the mutant
cells. Addition of the iron chelator 2,2’-dipyridyl (DP) or the
essential antioxidant, glutathione (GSH) to the streptomycin
containing medium relieved the growth reduction in wild-type
cells to a level comparable to single mutants (Fig. 2a), indicating
the participation of Yan, thA and Yth in an Fe—S cluster-
related processes.

Another example of novel assigned function was the implica-
tion of the gene ClpP in ribosome biogenesis, a prediction driven
largely by strong coexpression. Consistent with this prediction,
the ClpP, a serine protease that forms an active degradation
complex with Cle ATPase was found to degrade the ribosomal
subunit S7 in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2b), but the mechanism
by which the CleP protease recognizes the ribosomal S7 for
degradation (Flynn et al., 2003) is not yet known.

Similarly, based on SPDs, coexpression and other data sources
(e.g. phenomics and genomic context), a ribosomal link was pre-
dicted between a previously uncharacterized protein, YihD, and
the methyltransferase factors (TrmA, Rst) responsible for
methylation of 16 S rRNA and tRNAs. To evaluate this possible
connection, we tested the ribosome proﬁle of yihD deﬁcient
strains. In contrast to wild type, yihD mutant had an elevated
amount of free 30 S and 50 S ribosomal subunits, and a concomi-
tant decrease in 70 S formation (Supplementary Fig. S2a).
Consistent with this result, yihD mutant also exhibited signiﬁ-
cantly higher read-through of amber (UAG) and opal (UGA)
stop codon alleles, and +1 and —l frameshift mutations in
a ,B-galactosidase reporter system (O’Connor, et al., 1992).
Collectively, these results support our prediction of ClpP and
YihD involvement in ribosome biogenesis.

Finally, SPDs and correlated transcript expression proﬁles
connected the unannotated proteins YdeT, Yth, thY with

components involved in bacterial adhesion and bioﬁlm forma-
tion. To evaluate this link, we measured mutant strains harbor-
ing deletions in each of these genes for their ability to form a
bioﬁlm in vitro (see Methods). In contrast to wild-type cells, all
three single mutants displayed surface attachment through bio-
ﬁhn formation (Supplementary Fig. S2b) as has been previously
noted for other bioﬁlm—associated mutants (Ma and Wood,
2009). Notably, only one of the eight experimentally tested func-
tion predictions from GeneMANIA were ranked highly by the
STRING-derived function predictor (Supplementary Table S6,
see Supplementary Methods).

4 CONCLUSIONS

Until now, GeneMANIA has been limited to eukaryotes, where
it has proven to be a powerful resource for probing gene function
and revealing pairwise connections linking genes in yeast, ﬁy,
worm, human and other species (Zuberi et al., 2013). In this
study, we have extended the predictive power of GeneMANIA
to a leading model prokaryote, E.coli, an organism that has to
date lacked comparable tools for functional interrogation that
are simultaneously accurate, comprehensive (including the latest
high-throughput data), and easy to use. This work combines the
GeneMANIA algorithm with expansive networks of informative
functional connections consisting of more than one million gene—
gene associations based on physical interactions and shared

       

 

       
 

     
   
   
 

 

genetic, domain, chemogenomics and coexpression proﬁles.
This represents a rich resource, unparalleled in any other bacter-
ial species to date, for further mechanistic characterization of
both known and uncharacterized genes.

The GeneMANIA algorithm and supporting networks for
Ecoli and several model eukaryotes are made freely available
via a user friendly GeneMANIA web interface (www.genema-
nia.org) and as a plugin for the Cytoscape network visualization
environment. This web-accessible resource facilitates exploration
of functional inferences in hypothesis-driven follow-up studies
aimed at elucidating mechanistic aspects associated with particu-
lar bioprocesses.

While the prediction performed by GeneMANIA provides a
new method for leveraging functionally informative associations
to explore bacterial gene function, the quality of function predic-
tions, especially for loosely connected proteins, is expected to be
improved over the coming years as new genomic resources,
including protein and genetic interactions for the previously un-
explored interactome and biological space become available.
Nevertheless, just as we were able to identify novel functions
for uncharacterized genes in Fe—S cluster binding, ribosome bio-
genesis and cell adhesion, we believe that this resource will enable
additional functional discoveries in E.coli, and, through orthol-
ogy mapping, in other experimentally and evolutionarily signiﬁ-
cant uncharacterized bacterial species (Supplementary Table S7,
see Supplementary Methods), including opportunistic pathogens.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identification of ligand binding pockets on proteins
is crucial for the characterization of protein functions. It provides
valuable information for protein—ligand docking and rational
engineering of small molecules that regulate protein functions.
A major number of current prediction algorithms of ligand binding
pockets are based on cubic grid representation of proteins and, thus,
the results are often protein orientation dependent.

Results: We present the MSPocket program for detecting pockets
on the solvent excluded surface of proteins. The core algorithm of the
MSPocket approach does not use any cubic grid system to represent
proteins and is therefore independent of protein orientations. We
demonstrate that MSPocket is able to achieve an accuracy of 75%
in predicting ligand binding pockets on a test dataset used for
evaluating several existing methods. The accuracy is 92% if the top
three predictions are considered. Comparison to one of the recently
published best performing methods shows that MSPocket reaches
similar performance with the additional feature of being protein
orientation independent. Interestingly, some of the predictions
are different, meaning that the two methods can be considered
complementary and combined to achieve better prediction accuracy.
MSPocket also provides a graphical user interface for interactive
investigation of the predicted ligand binding pockets. In addition,
we show that overlap criterion is a better strategy for the evaluation
of predicted ligand binding pockets than the single point distance
criterion.

1 INTRODUCTION

The prediction of ligand binding sites on proteins provides
important information for protein—ligand docking and structural—
based rational engineering of small molecules that modulate protein
functions (Campbell et al., 2003; Sotriffer and Klebe, 2002).
Furthermore, comparative analysis of ligand binding pockets is

found to provide valuable information for the understanding of
protein—ligand binding speciﬁcity (Chen and Honig, 2010).

It has been observed that ligand binding sites often locate in
the largest pockets on protein surfaces (London et al., 2010;
Nayal and Honig, 2006). Thus, the identiﬁcation of pockets on
protein surfaces plays a key role in the prediction of protein
functional sites, in particular, ligand binding sites. A variety of
computational approaches have been proposed for the prediction
of ligand binding pockets. These methods can be divided into two
categories according to the information they utilize to detect pockets:
geometric approaches that are purely based on the geometric
characteristics of proteins, and comprehensive approaches that
not only consider geometric criteria but also take into account
evolutionary information, interaction energy or chemical properties
of proteins. A major number of these methods, in both categories,
are based on the cubic grid representation of protein structures.
Geometric methods like POCKET (Levitt and Banaszak, 1992),
LIGSITE (Hendlich et al., 1997) and LIGSITECS (Huang and
Schroeder, 2006) generate 3D grids for proteins and identify surface
pockets as the set of solvent grid points that are situated between
protein grid points. PocketPicker (Weisel et al., 2007) uses grids to
represent proteins and search the environment of each surface grid
along 30 directions for deﬁning pockets. Tripathi and Kellogg (2010)
introduced the VICE program as part of the HINT toolkit (Kellogg
et al., 2005). Similar to PocketPicker, VICE scans grid points along
the path in various directions at each grid points and deﬁnes pocket
grids as those with at least half of the scan directions ‘blocked’. The
VICE program represents proteins as binary grid maps, in which grid
points occupied by atoms are set to one and the rest zero, such that
the VICE algorithm is performed on only integers and thus is very
efﬁcient. Yu et al. (2010) suggested the R011 algorithm, in which a
probe sphere of radius 2A is used to roll on each slice of the 3D
grid representations of proteins. Pockets are deﬁned to be the regions
between the probe sphere and the protein surface.

The grid representation of proteins is dependent on the orientation
of proteins in the coordinate system. Inconsistent results may
be observed for grid—based methods if the atomic coordinates of
proteins are transformed. One solution to address the problem
of inconsistent results is to increase the grid resolution and
generate ﬁner grid representations. However, this is at the cost
of decreased efﬁciency of the methods. Alternatively, geometric
methods that do not use cubic grid systems have also been
suggested. SURFNET (Laskowski, 1995) places probe spheres in
gaps between protein surface atoms and deﬁnes pockets using the
probe spheres. CAST (Liang et al., 1998) represents a protein as
Delaunay triangulation and derives the alpha shape of the protein

to detect pockets using discrete—ﬂow theory. PASS (Brady and
Stouten, 2000) coats a protein using probe spheres repeatedly
and searches pockets that are ﬁlled with buried probes. Petsalaki
et al. (2009) proposed a novel idea for predicting ligand binding
sites. First, spatial position speciﬁc scoring matrices (S—PSSMs) are
derived from known protein—ligand complexes. Then, the surface
of the putative binding protein is scanned using the S—PSSMs to
locate potential ligand binding sites. The method reaches a positive
predictive value of 85% on a benchmark dataset of 405 known
protein—ligand complexes. Fpocket (Le Guilloux et al., 2009) uses
alpha spheres (Liang et al., 1998) to ﬁll the space within and around
the protein. Each alpha sphere is deﬁned by four atoms that are in
touch with the sphere and contains no atoms inside it. In addition,
each alpha sphere is labeled as polar or apolar according to the
physicochemical property of the atoms with which it is in contact.
Pockets are predicted to correspond to the ensembles of alpha
spheres of intermediate radii, which are required to be predominantly
apolar.

Here we present MSPocket (Molecular Surface Pocket), a
novel geometric program for searching pockets on protein solvent
excluded surfaces. MSPocket does not employ any cubic grid
representation of proteins. Thus, MSPocket results are inherently
independent of the orientations of proteins in coordinate systems
in terms of its core algorithm. MSPocket identiﬁes surface pocket
regions according to the normal vector directions at the vertices
on the surface. In an evaluation to predict ligand binding pockets,
MSPocket achieves an accuracy of 75% on a dataset used in the
evaluation of several existing methods. If top three predictions
are considered, the accuracy is 92%. There are currently three
approaches that reach the best performance in terms of detecting
ligand binding pockets on a benchmark dataset of proteins. Among
the three approaches, the program Fpocket (Le Guilloux et al.,
2009) not only applies geometric criteria, but also considers the
electronegativity of protein atoms to prune pockets. The other two
approaches use pure geometric criteria: VICE (Tripathi and Kellogg,
2010) and POCASA (Yu et al., 2010). In VICE, protein structures
were ﬁrst processed by performing molecular modeling and adding
hydrogen atoms using the Sybyl program suite (www.tripos.com).
VICE does not work as an independent program and needs Sybyl to
function at the moment (personal contact with the VICE authors).
POCASA uses the original atomic coordinates of proteins as
input, and it is freely available. We consider POCASA as our
reference approach and perform a thorough comparison with it.
The comparison results show that MSPocket achieves comparable
performance to POCASA with the additional feature of being
orientation independent. In addition, some results of MSPocket are
observed to be different from those of POCASA. This suggests
that the two approaches may be adopted as complementary tools to
achieve higher success rate. Moreover, in contrast to the widely used
evaluation method of calculating the minimum distance between
the mass center of predicted pockets and the ligand atoms, we
demonstrate that measuring the overlap between the ligand and
predicted pockets provides a more comprehensive assessment of
prediction results.

2 METHODS

MSPocket detects pockets on the solvent excluded surface (SES) computed
by using MSMS, which is a tool for efﬁcient computation of the analytical

model of protein SES (Sanner et al., 1996). MSMS generates a set of
surface vertices as a sampling of the protein SES. Each surface vertex is
associated with an atom in the protein. The surface vertices are triangulated.
The coordinates and the normal vectors of all surface vertices are produced,
which are utilized by MSPocket for identifying surface vertices located in
concave regions on the SES.

2.1 Workﬂow

The workﬂow of the MSPocket approach is described in the following
steps:

(i) Calculating protein SES using MSMS. Normally, in the SES generated
by MSMS, there is an external component and several internal
components. The external component of the SES is the exterior region
of the protein SES. The internal components are normally interior
regions surrounded by the protein (see Fig. 2b). In the MSPocket
algorithm, internal components are directly reported as cavities. The
following steps are only applied on the external component of the
protein SES for detecting pockets.

(ii) Sampling surface vertices. In order to reduce computational
complexity, we simplify the surface triangulation by sampling the
surface vertices generated by MSMS. To this end, we consider the
surface triangulation as a graph G(V,E), where V denotes the set of
all surface vertices, and E denotes the set of all edges between the
vertices in V. First, for every vertex v we compute the angle between
its normal vector and the normal vector of each adjacent vertex of v.
Then, we calculate the average value of all the angles and assign it
to v as its average angle if all the angles are smaller than 90 degrees.
Otherwise the average angle of v is set to inﬁnity. Next, we traverse
all the vertices in ascending order of average angle. Our aim here is
to reduce the number of vertices in G by choosing a subset of V as
representative vertices. During the traverse of the vertices, if we ﬁnd
that a vertex vc and all its neighbors N0(VC) have not been traversed
yet, then vc is sampled as the representative vertex for vc UNc;(vC), and
vc UNc;(vC) are all marked as traversed. After the traversal is ﬁnished,
all remaining non—traversed vertices are also taken as representative
vertices. We then construct a new graph G/(V/ ,E/), where V/ is the set
of all representative vertices. Two vertices in G/ are adjacent if they
are adjacent in G, or one of them is adjacent to any neighbor of the
other vertex in G, or their neighbors are adjacent in G. The number
of vertices is reduced to approximately 25% of the original number of
vertices using this sampling procedure. In the following steps, G/ is
used for detecting pocket vertices.

(iii) Identifying pocket vertex pairs (PktVPs) and protrusion vertex pairs
(PtrVPs). First of all, two surface vertices are considered to be a close
vertex pair (ClsVP) if the distance between them is less than or equal
to a cutoff dp. We then identify PktVPs and PtrVPs in ClsVPs (see
Fig. l). A ClsVP (A,B) is moved along the directions of their respective
normals for a short distance (0.2 A). We consider (A,B) to be a PktVP
if dAB — dA/B/ >0.2rr, where r is a distance change ratio parameter that
reﬂects how much closer A/ and B/ have moved toward each other
(—2.0 5 r 52.0). The larger the r value, the more restrictive it is for
deﬁning PktVP. The two vertices in a PktVP are regarded as potential
pocket vertices, and they are termed the pocket partners of each other.
For deﬁning PtrVPs, we consider the angle a between the normal IV;
of A and the vector A—E, and the angle ﬂ between the normal 2V; of B
and the vector 521. A ClsVP (A,B) is regarded as a PtrVP if 05+ emp,
where ap is an angle cutoff parameter.

(iv) Identifying pockets. We cluster pocket vertices based on the adjacency
between vertices in G/ to deﬁne pockets. Here, we construct a graph
G” (V” ,E” ), where V” is the set of all potential pocket vertices
identiﬁed in step (iii) and E” is the set of edges between potential
pocket vertices. In G”, two vertices are adjacent if they are adjacent
in G/ and they are not a PtrVP. Each connected component in G” is

an induced subgraph of G” and is considered to be a potential surface
pocket. Then we prune each potential pocket in order to remove outlier
vertices. We iteratively remove vertices that have no more than np
pocket partners, or have no more than nb neighbors in G” until no
more vertices are removed from the component. The vertices located
at the bottom of pockets have few pocket partners and are often missed
in the potential pockets. Therefore, we extend the pruned pockets by
adding new vertices to them. A vertex v is added to a pruned pocket p
if more than 50% of v’s neighbors belong to p.

Till now, surface pockets are deﬁned by representative vertices
sampled in step (ii). Here, we replace each representative vertices by
all the vertices it represents in G. In the end, each pocket is reported
as an induced subgraph of G.

Note that all parameters used in MSPocket are adjustable by users,
including distance cutoff dp, angle cutoff ap, distance change ratio r, pocket
partner number cutoff rip and neighbor number cutoff nb. In this work, we
set the parameters to a, 28A, a, =200°, r: 1.3, np=4, 71b: 1.

2.2 Ranking of pockets

In MSPocket, the identiﬁed pockets may be ranked according to a variety of
measures: the number of pocket vertices, number of pocket atoms associated
with pocket vertices, pocket surface area, or pocket volume. Here, we
introduce the methods for calculating pocket surface area and estimating
the pocket volume.

2.2.] Calculation of pocket surface area Each pocket identiﬁed by
MSPocket is deﬁned to be an induced graph of G, which is deﬁned by
the triangulation of the protein SES generated by MSMS (see Section 2.1).
We calculate the area of each triangle formed by the pocket vertices, and
compute the total area of all the triangles as the pocket surface area.

2.2.2 Estimation of pocket volume The pocket volume is estimated using
two methods. In the ﬁrst method, the volume of a pocket is calculated as the
sum of the volumes of all tetrahedra formed between Cp, the mass center
of all the pocket vertices and all triangles in the triangulation formed by the
pocket vertices (see Fig. 2a and b). For each tetrahedron, we calculate the
mass center of the triangle (C,) and the average vector (IV;) of the normal
vectors at the three vertices in the triangle. The volume of the tetrahedron V,-
is deﬁned to be positive if the angle between CTC; and IV; is less than 90 0,
otherwise negative. The pocket volume Ve is deﬁned to be 2V1.

Pockets detected by MSPocket on the external component of SES are
normally not closed. Therefore, the volume Ve estimated using the ﬁrst
method is typically smaller than the pocket volume. To address this problem,
we propose the second method for estimating pocket volumes more precisely.
We aim to close each pocket by adding a ‘cover’ on top of the pocket. The

method for building a cover for each pocket is described in detail in the
Supplementary Material. A more precise estimation of the pocket volume Vp
is calculated by considering not only the tetrahedra used for calculating Ve,
but also the tetrahedra formed by Cp and all triangles in the pocket covers.
Note that covers are only build for pockets. Cavities are always closed and
for them Ve 2 VP.

By default, MSPocket uses Ve to rank pockets and cavities. Pockets
and cavities are ranked separately. The computation of Vp is more time—
consuming and it is not performed by default in MSPocket.

2.3 Evaluation dataset

We use the dataset collected by Huang and Schroeder (2006) for evaluating
the prediction results of MSPocket. There are 48 bound structures and 48
corresponding unbound structures in the dataset. In each bound structure,
there is at least one ligand binding to the protein. See Table l for the complete
list of PDB entry codes and ligands. We refer to this dataset as Huang2006
dataset.

2.4 Evaluation method

There are different criteria proposed for the evaluation of identiﬁed pockets.
One of the most widely applied criteria is the single point distance criterion
(SPDc): a predicted pocket is regarded as correct if the mass center (MC)
of the pocket is within 4A of any atom of the ligand binding to the
protein (Huang and Schroeder, 2006; Le Guilloux et al., 2009; Weisel et al.,
2007). Yu et al. (2010) adopted a revised version of SPDc. They measured
the distance between the depth centers (DCs) of pockets to atoms in the
ligand, rather than the commonly used MCs.

To deal with the limitations of SPDc, alternative strategies like overlap
criterion (OVLc) have been proposed. Hendlich et al. (1997) calculated the
overlap between the atoms that are in contact with ligands and the atoms
predicted by LIGSITE to be part of the binding site. Tuffery and coworkers
have proposed a mutual overlap criterion (MOc) to assess the performance
of the Fpocket program (Le Guilloux et al., 2009). Using MOc, a predicted
pocket is considered correct if at least half of the ligand is covered by the
pocket, and the pocket is not too big at the same time (at least 20% of
the pocket is occupied by the ligand).

We argue that the SPDc has the following limitations compared with
OVLc: (i) a single point is an oversimpliﬁed representation of a pocket.
Distance between the single point and the ligand does not provide a
quantitative measure of the overlap between the space occupied by the ligand
and the predicted pocket. (ii) the assessment result depends on the deﬁnition
of the single point. For example, the use of DC leads to slightly different
evaluation of POCASA results from using MC (see Table 2). Speciﬁcally, for
a purine nucleoside phosphorylase (lULB), the top 1 pocket is considered to
be a success if DC is used as the single point to represent pockets. However,

aIf there are multiple ligands in a protein structure ﬁle, they are considered separately in the evaluation (separated by forward slash). In 1APU, the whole chain I comprises the
inhibitor isovaleryl (a pepstatin analogue) for an aspartyl proteinase. Thus, chain I is considered to be the ligand in 1APU. Similarly, in lPSO, the whole chain I comprises the
pepstatin in complex with human pepsin and is considered to be the ligand.

aMSPocket results are obtained using the same structure ﬁles used by POCASA. Pocket
MCs are employed in the evaluation.

bPOCASA results are taken from Yu et al. (2010) and are calculated using pocket
DCs. As a comparison, an evaluation using pocket MCs (see Section 2.4) is given in
parentheses.

CVICE results are taken from Tripathi and Kellogg (2010) and are calculated using the
‘center—of—gravity’ of pockets.

deocket results are taken from Le Guilloux et al. (2009).

none of the pockets detected by POCASA is regarded correct if MC is used
because none of the pocket MCs is within 4 A of any atoms of the guanine
molecule (see Fig. 3a). Similar results are also observed for an unbound
structure (lQIF, see Fig. 3b). A counterexample is also obtained. For the
top 1 pocket detected on 3GCH, the shortest distance is 4.2A between its
DC and any ligand atom. This value is 2.8A if MC of the pocket is used
(Fig. 30). (iii) The SPDc is biased against the cases in which ligands do
not locate in the center of the pockets. This is again illustrated by the two
examples shown in Figure 3a and b.

In spite of the limitations of SPDc, we nevertheless evaluated the
performance of MSPocket using SPDc and pocket MC. A pocket/cavity
prediction was considered to be successful if the MC of the pocket is within
4.0 A of any atom of the ligand. Both top 1 and top 3 best predictions were
considered with respect to their volume Ve. Yu et al. (2010) distinguished
pockets from cavities in the evaluation. Both pockets and cavities were
considered in the evaluation of the R011 algorithm and the best result was
reported. In other words, a prediction was regarded to be successful at top 1
if either the top 1 pocket or the top 1 cavity was correct. We followed the
same rule in the evaluation of MSPocket results.

We also evaluated the MSPocket program using OVLc. To assess the
performance of MSPocket, we examined the overlap between ligand binding
site atoms and pocket atoms as proposed by Hendlich et al. (1997). An atom
is considered to be part of the ligand binding site if its distance to any ligand
atom is less than or equal to the sum of the van der Waals (vdW) radii of the
atoms plus 1.0 A, i.e. rhgand+rp,0,e,n+1.0 (Zhu et al., 2008). As for pocket
atoms, they are derived from the detected pockets using distance criteria. In
MSPocket, predicted pockets are reported as surface vertices. We deﬁne all
atoms that are in proximity of 3.0 A to any pocket vertex to be pocket atoms.
This cutoff (3.0 A) was chosen to be close to the upper bound of rprotein+l.0,
such that the distance is at least rligand+rpr0tein+10 between the pocket atoms
and atoms of the ligand that potentially binds at the pocket. To compare
MSPocket results to those of POCASA, we deﬁned atoms associated with
POCASA pockets as the set of atoms in proximity of r to any pocket grid
point. We evaluated the performance of POCASA using different r values
(23.0, 4.0, . . ., 10.0 A). The performance of POCASA with respect to different
r values is shown in Supplementary Figures S3 and S4. In the end, we decided
to choose r=5.0 because POCASA reaches the best balanced performance
using this value.

2.5 Evaluation measures

We use LigBSA to represent the ligand binding site atoms that are identiﬁed
using the distance criteria in Section 2.4. Similarly, we use PktBSA to denote

pocket atoms. The overlap between LigBSA and PktBSA is deﬁned to be true
positive (TP). The remaining parts of the LigBSA and PktBSA are deﬁned
to be false negative (FN) and false positive (FP) (see Fig. 20). We deﬁne
performance measures sensitivity and precision as follows for the evaluation
of pocket prediction results:

TP TP
TP+FN TP+FP'

A high sensitivity reﬂects that the predicted pocket has a large overlap with
the ligand. But if the high sensitivity is achieved by the excessive size
of the pocket, the precision will be low. Similar to the M00 proposed by
Le Guilloux et al. (2009), we deﬁne our OVLc using sensitivity 2 50% and
precision Z 20%.

3.1 Evaluation results using SPDc

The performance of MSPocket using SPDc and pocket MC is
reported in Table 2. The details of the MSPocket predictions

POCASA, VICE and Fpocket is also listed in Table 2. MSPocket

and POCASA were run on the same input data. The performance
of POCASA using both MC and DC is reported. The performance
of VICE and Fpocket is obtained from the respective publications.
In this work, we considered POCASA as the reference program and
focused on the comparison of MSPocket and POCASA.

The success rates of MSPocket for the unbound structures are
75 and 92% when the top 1 and top 3 predicted pockets are
considered. These performances are better than POCASA, for which
the corresponding success rates using pocket MC are 73 and
85%. For bound structures, MSPocket has the same success rate
as POCASA if only top 1 of predicted pockets are considered.
POCASA produces slightly better results when top 3 predicted
pockets are considered. MSPocket results are worse than VICE
except for unbound structures when top 3 predictions are considered.
The comparison with Fpocket shows that Fpocket reaches better
performance except for bound structures when top 1 predictions are
considered.

After analyzing the detailed results on the Huang2006 dataset,
we notice that some results of MSPocket are different from those of
POCASA, although the overall accuracies of the two methods are
similar. For the 48 bound structures, MSPocket and POCASA predict
the ligand binding site at the same rank for 38 (79%) structures. For
the 48 unbound structures, the ligand binding sites of 36 (75%)
structures are identiﬁed at the same rank. If the top 1 predictions
of both methods are combined, the accuracy is improved to 85 and
81% for bound and unbound structures, respectively. Similarly, if the
top 3 predictions are combined, the accuracy is improved to 96%
for both bound and unbound structures. See supplementary Table SI
for details. We do not ﬁnd patterns in the different results. Some of
the differences in the predictions originate from the limitation of the
SPDc (see Section 3.3). The discrepancy in results is mainly due
to the different deﬁnition of pocket in the two approaches. These
results suggest that MSPocket and POCASA may be regarded as
complementary methods for the detection of ligand binding pockets.
When the predictions of both methods are considered, the success
rates are greatly improved.

3.2 Evaluation results using OVLc

We plot the success rates of MSPocket based on different sensitivity
and precision cutoffs for unbound structures in Figure 4 (see
Supplementary Figure S2 for bound structures). The detailed
sensitivity and precision values for MSPocket results are shown in
Table 1. The area under the curve (AUC) values are also reported in
the same plot. The performance of MSPocket using OVLc is given
in Table 3. As a comparison, the performance of POCASA is also
shown in Figure 4 and Table 3.

MSPocket successfully identiﬁes 69 and 83% of the ligand
binding sites on the unbound structures using MOc. In general, the
sensitivities of MSPocket and POCASA are similar to each other.
MSPocket performs slightly better than POCASA in identifying
ligand binding pockets on bound structures as top 1 pockets/cavities
(see AUC values in Supplementary Fig. 82a) and on unbound
structures when top 3 pockets/cavities are considered (see AUC
values in Fig. 4a). The precision of MSPocket is better than
POCASA. The difference in the AUC values is observed to be in
the range of 0.06—0.11 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 820).

We again observe that the results of MSPocket are different from
those of POCASA. Here, we regard the results to be the same if

the rank of the successful predictions are both 1, or both 2 or 3
or both larger than 3. For the 48 bound structures, MSPocket and
POCASA results are the same for 41 (85%) structures. For the 48
unbound structures, the number is 31 (65%). If the top 1 predictions
of both methods are combined, the accuracy is improved to 85%
and 81% for bound and unbound structures, respectively. If the
top 3 predictions are combined, the accuracy is 96% for both bound
and unbound structures. See Supplementary Table SI for details.
Some of the difference comes from the cutoff values used in the
OVLc. Nonetheless, the disagreement in the results is mainly due
to the different deﬁnition of pocket in the two approaches. These
results again illustrate that combining MSPocket and POCASA as

MSPocket: detection of ligand binding pockets

 

complementary methods allow the user to achieve higher success
rate than using any of the methods separately.

3.3 SPDc versus OVLc

We have noticed that the success rate of MSPocket is different
using SPDc and OVLc. Apart from the examples of lULB and
1QIF we introduced in Section 2.4, the predicted pockets/cavities
are also assessed differently in a few other cases. In the case of
1ACJ, the ligand tacrine (THA) locates almost completely within
the top 1 pocket (sensitivity=98%). However, the top 1 pocket is
large and THA locates at one corner of the pocket (precision = 29%)
(see Fig. 3d). Similar results are also observed for 1CDO (see
Fig. 3e). In these two examples, the top 1 pockets are not regarded
as successful predictions according to SPDc because the distance
between the MCs of the pockets and all atoms in the ligand exceeds
4.0 A. But, in all the four cases, such spatial relationship between
pockets and ligands is clearly reﬂected by higher sensitivity and
low precision values. This demonstrates that OVLc provides a more
comprehensive assessment of the predicted pockets than SPDc.

3.4 Pockets and protein orientation

MSPocket does not use any cubic grid representation of proteins.
Its results are thus independent of protein orientations (given
consistent generation of SES). On the contrary, the pockets detected
by methods based on grid representations of proteins are not
necessarily the same if proteins are transformed. Consequently, this
may lead to inconsistent prediction results of pockets. For instance,
in the unbound structure of a—momorcharin (PDleAHC), when
the original coordinates of the protein in PDB are used, MSPocket
identiﬁes the ligand binding site at rank 1, while POCASA only
detects the binding site at rank 2. Only when the unbound structure
of a—momorcharin is superposed using PyMOL to its corresponding
bound structure in the dataset (PDleMRG), is POCASA able to
detect the binding site at rank 1. In other words, POCASA produces
different results if the structure of a—momorcharin is transformed in
3D space. In another example, POCASA fails to identify ligand
binding pockets in the top 5 pockets on the unbound structure
of a neutral protease (PDleNPC) if the neutral protease is ﬁrst
aligned to its bound structure (PDleHYT). However, the ligand
binding pocket is successfully identiﬁed by POCASA at rank 1 if the
original coordinates of the neutral protease lNPC is used. MSPocket
identiﬁes the ligand binding site of the neutral protease at rank 1 in
both cases.

3.5 Implementation

MSPocket is implemented using Python. We also used Python
packages BioPython (Cock et al., 2009) and NetworkX (Hagberg
et al., 2008). The source code of MSPocket is publicly available
at http://appserver.biotec.tu—dresden.de/MSPocketl. We have also
created a MSPocket plugin for PyMOL (DeLano, 2002). Figure 5
shows a snapshot of the MSPocket PyMOL plugin. The runtime of
MSPocket is given in the Supplementary Material.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Here we present MSPocket, a program for detecting pockets
using geometric criteria on protein surfaces calculated by MSMS.
MSPocket can be used for the prediction of potential ligand binding

site on proteins. The comparative work presented here shows that
in an evaluation using the same dataset, the sensitivity of MSPocket
results is comparable to that of POCASA, which is one of the
currently best performing methods and used as the reference in this
work. The precision of the pockets predicted by MSPocket is higher
than that of POCASA. Furthermore, we illustrated that the two
methods successfully predict ligand binding pockets for different
subsets of structures in the test dataset. The discrepancy in the results
appears mainly because of the different deﬁnition of pocket used in
the two approaches. The results obtained indicate that MSPocket and
POCASA may be used as complementary programs for identifying
ligand binding pockets. The combination of the results obtained on
the prediction of pockets/cavities using each of these two methods
may increase the probability of discovering biologically meaningful
ligand binding sites. We foresee that a method combining the two
algorithms could potentially be used to generate higher accuracy
predictions.

MSPocket does not use any cubic grid system to represent
proteins, which makes the core algorithm of the MSPocket approach
independent of protein orientations. MSPocket yields consistent
results when proteins are transformed. This is a feature that grid—
based methods like POCASA program lack. MSPocket is also
implemented as a PyMOL plugin, which provides a ﬂexible and
interactive tool for the graphical investigation of protein surface
pockets.

We also demonstrated that OVLc provides a more comprehensive
assessment of pocket prediction results. Using sensitivity and
precision measures, the spatial relationship between the predicted
pockets and ligands is clearly reﬂected. This feature of OVLc is also
important in the comparison of the geometry of pockets and ligands.
For instance, Yu et al. (2010) reported that the shape of the predicted
pockets agrees well with that of bound ligands. The comparison of
the shapes was performed by visually inspecting the geometry of
the pockets and ligands. Using OVLc, the assessment work may be
carried out automatically, because a predicted pocket of both high
sensitivity and precision must have a very similar shape to that of
the ligand. This again illustrates that OVLc is a better strategy than
SPDc for the assessment of predicted pockets.

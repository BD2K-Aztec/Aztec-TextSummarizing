ABSTRACT

Summary: Systematically extracting biological meaning from omics
data is a major challenge in systems biology. Enrichment analysis is
often used to identify characteristic patterns in candidate lists.
FungiFun is a user-friendly Web tool for functional enrichment analysis
of fungal genes and proteins. The novel tool FungiFun2 uses a com-
pletely revised data management system and thus allows enrichment
analysis for 298 currently available fungal strains published in standard
databases. FungiFun2 offers a modern Web interface and creates
interactive tables, charts and figures, which users can directly manipu-
late to their needs.

Availability and implementation: FungiFun2, examples and tutorials
are publicly available at https://elbe.hki-jena.de/fungifun/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Fungi form an extremely diverse kingdom of organisms with
different lifestyles and interesting human applications
(Blackwell, 2011). Fungi are not only important to produce
food but also produce bioactive compounds known as secondary
metabolites (Brakhage, 2013), which are important for the
pharmaceutical and chemical industries. On the other hand,
there are many pathogenic fungi that destroy crops and infect
humans. The growing amount of omics data from the fungal
community will help to identify Virulence factors as well as inter-
esting bioactive compounds. Enrichment analysis is often applied
along with omics data analysis. Here candidate genes/proteins
are assigned to categories from structured vocabularies (ontolo-
gies). Afterward, statistical tools help to identify those categories
that are signiﬁcantly enriched with the given candidates. These
enriched categories may represent molecular functions, pathways
or cellular locations most affected by the experiment. A number
of easy-to-use online tools exist, e.g. YeastMine (Balakrishnan
et al., 2012), and are reviewed in Huang et al., 2009. However, no
user-friendly online tool for the systematic analysis of long can-
didate lists existed for most fungal species.

Our group implemented the tool FungiFun (Priebe et al.,
2010) supporting enrichment analysis for 28 species with a
focus on fungal pathogens. In this article, we present the novel
tool FungiFun2, which allows the systematic analysis of

candidate lists from all the currently available fungal strains pub-
lished in standard databases (Fig. 1). Users can choose from 298
strains of 240 species. For data collection, FungiFun2 uses a
semi-automatic procedure, which downloads gene to category
associations and annotations (names and functions) from
online databases. This procedure allows the database to be
kept up-to—date and simpliﬁes the addition of further species.
In comparison to the previous version, which worked with ﬂat
ﬁles for annotations, FungiFun2 parses annotation into a stan-
dardized database allowing higher data connectivity and ﬂexibil-
ity, e. g. alternative input identiﬁers (IDs), gene annotation and
complex search queries. Finally, F ungiFun2 offers a modern and
user-friendly interface.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

Figure 1A illustrates the three functional ontologies that are
integrated into FungiFun2, i. e. Gene Ontology (GO;
Ashburner et al., 2000), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG; Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) and Functional
Catalogue (F unCat; Riipp et al., 2004). F unCat gene to category
associations were downloaded from MIPS through the
PEDANT database WV alter et al., 2009). For GO, several data
source have been used: Candida Genome Database (CGD; Inglis
et al., 2012), Aspergillus Genome Database (AspGD; Cerqueira
et al., 2014), Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; Cherry
et al., 2012), UniProt-GOA-project at European Bioinformatics
Institute (EBI) and Ensembl Fungi (Kersey et al., 2010).
Additionally, we included GO gene to category associations by
applying Blast2GO (Conesa et al., 2005). To do so, proteomes
were obtained from BROAD, NCBI or in-house data
(Schwartze et al., 2014, Linde et al., 2014). Finally, KEGG
gene to pathway associations were obtained from the KEGG
FTP server.

With the help of a semi-automatic procedure, all available
strains in the used databases are listed. Each strain may have
different data sources, where the preferred version needs to be
manually selected. Afterward, ﬁat ﬁles are automatically down-
loaded and parsed into a MySQL database using Python and
R scripts. These scripts guarantee that the database stays up-
to-date with only small effort. Currently, ontologies formed by
FunCat, KEGG and GO were downloaded from nine different
sources. Primarily obtained from EBI, GO gene/protein to
category association is available for 258 strains. FunCat gene/
protein to category association is available for 180 strains.
Finally, KEGG pathway association is available for 71 strains.

Fig. 1. Overview of FungiFun2 functionality. (A) With help of a semi-
automatic procedure, gene to category associations for three ontologies as
well as gene names and functions are downloaded. The numbers in the
Venn diagram indicate the number of available strains. (B) The user se-
lects a strain and ontology. (C) On the Web server, gene to category

association and signiﬁcance tests are performed. (D) Schematic Visualiza-
tion of the output (dynamical ﬁgures, charts and tables) is shown

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1B illustrates main features of the user interface. To run
FungiFun2, users need to chose a strain, select an ontology,
supply the tool with a list of candidate IDs and choose a
P-Value cutoff. After strain selection, the user may check for
available (alternative) IDs. Only those ontologies can be used
for which annotation is currently available. Advanced options
allow for alternative P-Value calculations and multiple test cor-
rections, for upload of a background list, for in/exclusion of
categories and for the selection of GO evidence codes.

Figure 1C illustrates main aspects for the calculation of en-
riched categories as well as results, graphs and tables. On the
server side, a PHP script parses user input, controls calculations
of statistics, graphs and tables and ﬁnally creates data for the
result page. P-Values indicating the signiﬁcance of the enrichment
are calculated with Fisher’s exact test or hypergeometric test.
Multiple test correction may be performed, e.g. Via FDR
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). The R—package RamiGO
(Schr6der et al., 2013) is used to Visualize signiﬁcantly enriched
GO categories within the GO hierarchy. Bar, pie and column
charts are created with help of the J avaScript library
Highcharts, whereas customizable result tables are created
with J avaScript library DataTables.

Figure 1D illustrates parts of the results of a FungiFun2 run.
Each output can be customized directly in the Web interface as
well as downloaded in commonly used formats. The number of
enriched categories as well as the number of genes within
enriched and non-enriched categories give an overview of the
results. Speciﬁc pie and bar charts allow users to Visualize

the number of genes in the signiﬁcant categories compared
with the number of genes in the input list. Finally, graphs high-
lighting enriched categories within the hierarchies of the ontolo-
gies are available. Results are displayed in tables focusing on
categories or genes, which can be interactively rearranged and
ﬁltered.

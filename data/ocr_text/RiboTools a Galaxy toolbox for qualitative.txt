Abstract

Motivation: Ribosome profiling provides genome-wide information about translational regulation.
However, there is currently no standard tool for the qualitative analysis of Ribo-seq data. We pre-
sent here RiboTools, a Galaxy toolbox for the analysis of ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) data. It can
be used to detect translational ambiguities, stop codon readthrough events and codon occupancy.
It provides a large number of plots for the visualisation of these events.

Availability and implementation: RiboTools is available from https://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/
view/rlegendre/ribo_tools as part of the Galaxy Project, under the GPLv3 licence. It is written in
python2.7 and uses standard python libraries, such as matplotlib and numpy.

1 Introduction

Translation fidelity is essential for the correct decoding of genetic in-
formation. However, translation fidelity is not maximal, and several
genes use alternative mechanisms to regulate their expression
(Eswarappa et al., 2014; Namy et al., 2004). Such recoding events
are difficult to identify by bioinformatics methods and their
incorrect annotation in databases is still frequent. Genome-wide
translational analyses, such as ribosome profiling, can identify many
features affecting translational quality, such as ribosomal pauses,
dual coding regions, translation start sites at AUG or non-AUG
codons or unconventional translational decoding events, the transla-
tion of non-coding RNA and translational ambiguities (Baudin-
Baillieu et al., 2014; Ingolia et al., 2014; Ingolia et al., 2011;
Menschaert et al., 2013; Michel et al., 2012; Wan and Qian, 2014).

Ribosome profiling has been widely adopted by the scientific
community, because it has revolutionised the ways in which transla-
tion can be studied (Ingolia et al., 2014). It can be used for both
quantitative and qualitative analyses of translation. Quantitative
analysis is carried out with standard RNA-seq scripts and is easy to
implement (Olshen et al., 2013). An online genome browser is also
available for the visualisation of many ribosome profiling data

(Michel et al., 2014). However, qualitative analysis is much more
challenging, because there is no standard analysis technique avail-
able. Correct analysis requires the development of specific scripts, as
most publications describe only brieﬂy the way in which the data
should be analysed. A better standardization of ribosome profiling
approaches is urgently needed to limit misinterpretations (Artieri
and Fraser, 2014; Gerashchenko and Gladyshev, 2014).

We describe here RiboTools, an efficient Galaxy package that can
be used for primary analyses of Ribo-seq data, and to address
common issues, such as the identification of translational ambiguities,
or of stop codon readthrough events, and the codon occupancy of
ribosomal A, P, and E-sites. RiboTools provides user-friendly publica-
tion-grade graphical results (html report). Scripts are available from
the Galaxy bioinformatics platform (Goecks et al., 2010) via
ToolShed. RiboTools will be useful to the research community as it
facilitates the complete qualitative analysis of ribosome profiling data.

available in a binary version of sequence map/alignment (BAM) for-
mat. To this end, we provide a supplementary file containing a
tutorial explaining how to obtain the BAM file from the FastaQC
file. The BAM file must be sorted, but no subalignment extraction is
required before its use. All the scripts use two automatic alignment
filters: uniquely mapped footprints only, and footprints mapped
with high quality (MAPQ > 20). GFF3 files are required for feature
annotation.

2.1 Primary analysis and k—mer choice

Kmer can be used to choose the best length of footprint, k-mer, with
the largest number of in-frame footprints. Two kinds of analysis are
performed: (i) size distribution of the mapped footprints present in
the BAM file; (ii) classification of the category of each footprint,
within the three possible reading frames from the translational
start and stop sites annotated in the GFF3 file (Supplementary
Figure S1A).

2.2 Detection of translational ambiguities

Translational ambiguities are coding sequences for which footprints
are simultaneously present in several frames. Frame uses the k-mer
selected as described above to detect such rare events, by analysing
the out-of-frame footprints in each annotated coding sequence
(CDS) presents in the GFF3 file.

For this analysis, we divide CDS into segments of a size defined
by the user. We then compare k-mer distribution in each segment
with the global footprint distribution in the three possible reading
frames (obtained by kmer, Supplementary Figure 51A) and we
report genes with unconventional distributions.

This tool also generates an html report and a subprofile plot of
genes with translational ambiguities (Supplementary Figure S1B).

2.3 Identification of readthrough events

Stop codon readthrough corresponds to ribosomes translating part
of the 3’UTR. Such events have been reported to occur in complex
genomes (Eswarappa et al., 2014; Loughran et al., 2014; Namy
et al., 2003; Schueren et al., 2014). We use the parameters described
by Dunn and collaborators (Dunn et al., 2013) to identify potential
stop codon readthrough events. Stop_supp considers all the foot-
prints present in the BAM file. Potential readthrough is considered
to occur if: (i) there are footprints after the stop codon of the CDS;
(ii) there are footprints overlapping the next in-frame stop codon;
(iii) there is no methionine codon in the next five codons down-
stream from the stop codon of the CDS; (iv) there is homogeneous
coverage of the extension.

Stop codon readthrough is estimated by calculating the ratio of
the number of footprints in the C-terminal extension to the number
in the CDS. Ribosome density footprints are estimated in RPKM
(reads per kilobase per million). We control for variability due to
stop codon peaks, by excluding footprints mapping to stop codons
from the calculation of RPKM.

2.4 Codon occupancy at a specific ribosome site

The codon_density tool determines whether codon occupancy dif-
fers between two sets of conditions, by calculating the numbers of
each codon in the theoretical position of the ribosome site selected
by the user. Classically, the A, P and E-sites are located 15, 12 and 9
nucleotides downstream from the start of the footprint. However,
this parameter can be modified by the user. This tool uses the foot-
print size defined by the user with Kmer. Codon_density plots codon
occupancy for each set of conditions and evaluates differential

occupancy with a chi-squared test. Codons are also grouped by
amino acid in another plot, for visualisation of the possible global
effects (Supplementary Figure 51C).

3 Example of application

We recently used RiboTools to analyse the translational impact of
the [PSI+] prion in yeast (Baudin-Baillieu et al., 2014). Ribosomal
footprints of different lengths may be obtained, due to the variability
of digestion efficiency. Kmer can be used to visualise this diver-
sity and to identify the best in-frame subfamily. For example, in
yeast, more than 80% of the 28-mers are in-frame (Supplementary
Figure S1A).

Using Frame, we were able to identify 119 genes with transla-
tional ambiguities, revealing, for the first time, an unexpected effect
of [PSI+]. Moreover, Stop_supp identified 205 potential read-
through events generated by [PSI+].

Codon_density revealed no significant differences in the codon
occupancy of ribosomal sites other than for stop codons, consistent
with a larger number of ribosomes translating the stop codon and
continuing downstream (Supplementary Figure SlC). We checked
that RiboTools was suitable for use with other datasets, by also
analysing published ribosome profiling data from other groups
working on yeast, Drosophila and mouse. We obtained results
similar to those published (see Supplementary Figures 52A and S2B).

4 Conclusion

The methods provided by RiboTools are designed for the accurate
analysis of k-mer length distribution, translation ambiguities and
translation readthrough events. They evaluate codon occupancy at a
specific ribosome site on the basis of Ribo-seq data. These tools
have been tested and the results support their statistical and compu-
tational properties. We report here an integrated open-source
Galaxy tool providing the broader research community with access
to these methods. RiboTools is available from the public ToolShed
repository.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The study of metabolites (metabolomics) is increasingly
being applied to investigate microbial, plant, environmental and
mammalian systems. One of the limiting factors is that of chemically
identifying metabolites from mass spectrometric signals present in
complex datasets.

Results: Three workflows have been developed to allow for
the rapid, automated and high-throughput annotation and
putative metabolite identification of electrospray LC-MS-derived
metabolomic datasets. The collection of workflows are defined
as PUTMEDID_LCMS and perform feature annotation, matching
of accurate m/z to the accurate mass of neutral molecules and
associated molecular formula and matching of the molecular
formulae to a reference file of metabolites. The software is
independent of the instrument and data pre—processing applied. The
number of false positives is reduced by eliminating the inaccurate
matching of many artifact, isotope, multiply charged and complex
adduct peaks through complex interrogation of experimental data.
Availability: The workflows, standard operating procedure and
further information are publicly available at http://www.mcisb.org/
resources/putmedid.html.

1 INTRODUCTION

Systems biology is applied to study the components of, and
more importantly their complex interactions in, biological systems.
One set of components which are studied in systems biology
investigations are metabolites, either by targeted or holistic proﬁling
experimental strategies (Dunn et al., 2011). Low molecular weight
inorganic and organic metabolites play important roles in the

operation and maintenance of biological systems. The study
of metabolites (metabolomics) is increasingly being applied to
investigate microbial (Bradley et al., 2009; MacKenzie et al., 2008;
Mashego et al., 2007), plant (Allwood et al., 2008; Fernie and
Schauer, 2009; Hall et al., 2008), environmental (Bundy et al.,
2009; Viant et al., 2006) and mammalian (Grifﬁn, 2008; Kenny
et al., 2010; Lewis et al., 2008) systems. Many studies follow
a hypothesis generating or inductive strategy (Kell and Oliver,
2004) and start from a small and known subset of biological
knowledge. Valid experiments are designed to acquire robust and
reproducible data on a wide range of different metabolites and
metabolite classes from carefully selected samples. Subsequent data
analysis procedures deﬁne the metabolic differences associated with
a biological change related to genotype, biological perturbation
or environmental intervention (for example, drug therapy). These
studies employ a metabolic proﬁling strategy to detect a wide range
of (but not all) metabolites from numerous biochemical classes
to obtain maximum metabolic information rapidly. This strategy
provides the detection of hundreds or thousands of metabolites.
However, due to the diverse range of chemical and physical
properties and the wide concentration range of metabolites within
the metabolome, no single analytical technology can provide
the non-biased quantitative detection of all metabolites in a
biological system (Dunn, 2008). Metabolic proﬁling provides
semi-quantitative data, typically as chromatographic peak areas,
rather than absolute quantitation where metabolite concentrations
would be reported. Mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (NMR) have been widely employed
and provide complementary roles (Dunn et al., 2005, 2011).
Chromatography-MS techniques provide advantages for these
highly complex biological samples and include gas chromatography
(GC-MS), liquid chromatography (LC-MS) and LC derivatives
including ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC-MS).
Capillary Electrophoresis-MS (Soga et al., 2003) and LC-MS apply
electrospray ionization. Direct infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS)
can also be applied, though lacks the chromatographic separation of

metabolites (Dunn et al., 2005; Southam et al., 2007). Hyphenated
platforms can provide (with suitable operation and mass calibration)
high separation resolution, high mass resolution and mass accuracy,
typical limits of detection of micromol per litre and the ability
to identify metabolites through a combination of Retention Time
(RT)/index, accurate mass and gas-phase fragmentation-derived
mass spectra. Each of these platforms, whether hyphenated or non—
hyphenated, provide different advantages and disadvantages for
metabolite identiﬁcation as has been reviewed previously (Dunn
et al., 2011). The increasing use of high mass resolution LC-MS
and UPLC-MS platforms provides the detection of many thousands
of features [see Brown et al. (2009) for a comparison of the features
detected related to sample type] with high mass accuracy and has
led to a need to develop data handling methods for the conversion
of this raw analytical data into biological knowledge.

One of the data processing procedures essential in metabolic
proﬁling is metabolite identiﬁcation which has been reviewed
previously (Dunn et al., 2011; Wishart, 2009). Guidelines have
been provided by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative to deﬁne
how the different levels of metabolite identiﬁcation can be reported
(Sumner et al., 2007). A range of approaches can be applied for
metabolite identiﬁcation. Two generalized types of identiﬁcation are
achievable: putative identiﬁcation and deﬁnitive identiﬁcation.

Putative identiﬁcation usually employs one or more molecular
properties for identiﬁcation, but does not compare these to the
same properties of an authentic chemical standard as is performed
for deﬁnitive identiﬁcation. The accurate mass (or m/z) of an
analyte and its associated isotopologues can be used to deﬁne
molecular formulae (MFs) from which suitable metabolites can be
derived by searching a range of electronic resources [e. g. PubChem
(http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0V/), HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca/),
KEGG (http://www.gen0me.jp/kegg/) and MMD (Brown et al.,
2009)] and has been previously shown (Brown et al., 2005 ;
Junot et al., 2010; Lane et al., 2008; Rogers et al., 2009).
Direct matching of accurate mass (or m/z) to data in electronic
resources without intermediate matching to MF can also be
performed. However, structural isomers and stereoisomers have the
same accurate mass and therefore require a separate, orthogonal
property for identiﬁcation of all potential isomers. Typically, this
is chromatographic separation though separation of isomers is not
always achievable. Separation of enantiomers requires a chiral
chromatography column.

Deﬁnitive identiﬁcation employs at least two properties (typically
RT or index and fragmentation mass spectrum) and compares these
properties to an authentic chemical standard analysed under identical
analytical conditions. In LC-MS and UPLC-MS applications, the
accurate masses of the detected ions is employed in combination
with other rules (e.g. isotope ratio of 12C and 13C isotopic peaks to
deﬁne the number of carbon atoms present in the MF; calculated as
peak area 13C isotopologue/peak area 12C isotopologue) to generate
MF and thus provide putative metabolite identiﬁcati0n(s). Speciﬁc
rules are not always applicable. For example, 13C/12C isotopic
peaks can only be applied on instruments where accurate isotopic
ratios are detected and where 13C-artiﬁcially labelled metabolites
have not been applied in the biological experiment. Fragmentation
mass spectra (MS/MS or MS") are then used to provide increased
conﬁdence through comparison to authentic chemical standards or to
in silica-derived fragmentation mass spectra to give an unequivocal
metabolite identiﬁcation (Wolf et al., 2010). It should be noted that

not all authentic chemical standards are commercially available and
that MS/MS and MS" fragmentation mass spectra are not always
accurate in unequivocal identiﬁcation of two isomeric metabolites.

Studies by the authors have assessed the level of complexity
of electrospray UPLC-MS data derived from biological extracts
in a metabolic proﬁling strategy (Brown et al., 2009). This work
has shown that a multitude of different ion types are observed
including commonly described ions (e. g. protonated, deprotonated,
sodium or potassium adducts and 13C isotope). However, many
other unexpected types of ions including adducts (e.g. complex
combinations of sodium chloride and formate dependant on the
matrix type and mobile phase), fragments, dimers, multiply charged
and instrument speciﬁc ions (e. g. Fourier Transform (FT) artifact
peaks) are also detected. Each different ion type is deﬁned as a
feature, whose accurate mass (or m/z) is unique but whose RT and
chromatographic peak proﬁles are identical. Information on the type
of ion should be applied in metabolite identiﬁcation (Brown et al.,
2009; Draper et al., 2009).

Automated software or workﬂows for high-throughput
identiﬁcation of large metabolomic datasets are not freely available.
Currently, metabolite identiﬁcation is a manual or semi-automated
process assessing those features of biological interest and not the
complete set of detected features (Dunn, 2008). For metabolomics
to be successful it is essential to derive biological knowledge from
analytical data, a View emphasized by a recent Metabolomics ASMS
Workshop Survey 2009 which found that the biggest bottlenecks in
metabolomics were thought to be identiﬁcation of metabolites and
assigning of biological interest (http://ﬁehnlab.ucdaVis.edu/staff/
kind/Metabolomics-Survey-2009).

To ﬁll the gap in requirements, three workﬂows have been
written to perform for the ﬁrst time integrated, automated and
high-throughput annotation and putative metabolite identiﬁcation
of electrospray LC-MS and UPLC-MS metabolomic datasets in
a freely available package. The workﬂows were developed in
the Taverna Workﬂow Management System to provide ﬂexibility
in their operation and the ability to rapidly and simply
integrate with web services and other Taverna workﬂows in the
future [for example, see Li et al. (2008)], so as to provide
integrated data analysis and bioinformatics or cheminformatics
packages. Examples are available on myExperiment, a repository
of workﬂows freely available to the scientiﬁc community
(http://www.myexperiment.0rg/), including a workﬂow to perform
data pre-processing with XCMS and a workﬂow to perform in silico
fragmentation applying MetFrag. The achievement of this level of
integration would be more technically demanding and would require
signiﬁcantly greater expertise and time if coded in many other
programming languages. Taverna is also easy to operate for relative
novices with minimal training as the process involves deﬁning
parameter values and ﬁles only.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

The current lack of freely available workﬂows or software to process
deconvoluted data acquired from electrospray LC-MS experiments led the
authors to develop three workﬂows. The workﬂows have been developed
in Taverna (Hull et al., 2006) using Beanshell, a Java scripting language,
which is enabled in Taverna and can perform data manipulation, parsing
and formatting. Taverna can be downloaded from http://www.taverna.org.uk.
The workﬂows were developed under Windows using Taverna V1.7.0

and subsequently tested using Taverna Workbench 2.2.0. In combination,
the workﬂows perform the automated, high-throughput annotation and
putative metabolite identiﬁcation of electrospray LC-MS and UPLC-MS
metabolomic datasets. The software has been coded as a series of separate
workﬂows to allow more ﬂexibility in the analysis of data by obviating
the need to re-run the whole pipeline when altering one of the workﬂow
parameters, such as the mass tolerance or database. This approach also
reduces the likelihood of memory problems when handling large datasets
on computers with small RAM.

The workﬂows, related ﬁles and standard operating procedure (SOP)
are available to the user community on http://www.mcisb.0rg/resources/
putmedid.html and will also be placed on MyExperiment (http://www
.myexperiment.org/). In general, the input and output ﬁles are tab-delimited
(*.txt) ﬁles and are sorted by ascending accurate mass or MF as appropriate
(ordered as C, H, N, O, P, S, Br, Cl, F, Si in ascending alphanumeric form
as is standard for PubChem). Internal checks are made within the workﬂows
to ensure that the number of features in both peak and data ﬁles match
(workﬂow for correlation analysis) and that the study and reference input ﬁles
are sorted either by accurate m/z (workﬂow for metabolic feature annotation)
or MF (workﬂow for metabolite annotation). Termination of the process and
reporting of an informative error message occurs if this is not the case. The
three workﬂows are described in detail in the available SOP and brieﬂy
below.

2.1 Workﬂow for correlation analysis

The workﬂow for correlation analysis (List_Coerata) allows the user to
calculate either Pearson or Spearman rank correlations or read in previously
calculated correlation data. The correlation calculations allow for NaN,
Inf and 0 in the input data and are equivalent to using the Matlab
(http://www.mathworks.co.uk/) corr function with the following parameters:

corr(Xdata, ‘rows’, ‘pairwise’, ‘type’, ‘Pearson’) or
corr(Xdata, ‘rows’, ‘pairwise’, ‘type’, ‘Spearman’)

2.2 Workﬂow for metabolic feature annotation

The workﬂow for metabolic feature annotation (annotate_MassMatch) uses
correlation coefﬁcient information calculated in the workﬂow for correlation
analysis, accurate m/z difference, RT and median peak area data to group
together and annotate features with the type of ion (isotope, adduct, dimer,
others) originating from the same metabolite. The same metabolite can be
detected as different ion types each with different m/z. Following annotation,
the experimentally determined accurate m/z are matched to the accurate m/z
of unique MF in a reference ﬁle within a speciﬁed m/z tolerance.

2.3 Workﬂow for metabolite annotation

In the workﬂow for metabolite annotation (matchMMF_MF), the MF
from the output ﬁle calculated in the workﬂow for metabolic feature
annotation is matched to the MF from the Reference ﬁle of metabolites
(trimMMD_sortMF.txt or other appropriate reference ﬁle). The metabolite
information for all matched MFs is added to the input data and output data
are generated in three formats, each of which can be saved as tab-delimited
ﬁles by the user.

3 RESULTS

An assessment has been made of the workﬂows’ ability to perform
putative metabolite identiﬁcation using two reference ﬁles: (i) a
listing of unique accurate mass/MF data from PubChem using
speciﬁc elements (C, H, N, O, P, S, Br, Cl, F, Si only; ﬁle downloaded
from http://ﬁehnlab.ucdaVis.edu/projects/Seven_Golden_Rules/)
selected to give a wider selection of MFs and (ii) The Manchester
Metabolomics Database (Brown et al., 2009) constructed with data

from genome-scale metabolic reconstructions, HMDB, KEGG,
LIPIDMAPS, BioCyc and DrugBank. Data from all these sources
are included to provide a comprehensive set of metabolites. For
example, HMDB does not contain all lipids that are theoretically
present in human bioﬂuids and tissues and therefore inclusion of
data from LIPIDMAPS provides greater complementary metabolite
coverage.

A clinical dataset of fasting blood serum samples were taken
from participants according to ethical guidelines and stored before
being analysed with quality control samples in a random order and
within 48 h of reconstitution using an UPLC (Waters UPLC Acquity,
Elstree, UK) coupled on—line to an electrospray LTQ-Orbitrap hybrid
mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, Bremen, Germany).
The collection and storage of serum samples and the UPLC and
mass spectrometer methods applied have been previously described
(Dunn et al., 2008; Zelena et al., 2009). Independent samples (118
in total) were analysed in both positive and negative ion mode.
Raw data ﬁles (.RAW) were converted to the NetCDF format using
the File converter program in XCalibur (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc,
Bremen, Germany). Deconvolution of data was performed using
XCMS, running on R version 2.6.0, an open-source deconvolution
program available for LC-MS data (Smith et al., 2006) using
identical settings to those reported previously (Dunn et al., 2008).
This produced a list of features with associated RT, accurate m/z and
chromatographic peak area. For these data, the mass accuracy was
assessed using a set of 35 and 50 metabolites commonly detected in
serum and plasma in positive and negative ion modes, respectively.
Shown in Table 1 is the distribution of annotated features found in
the dataset and excluded from further mass matching.

In positive ion mode >50% of features were marked for exclusion
from further metabolite identiﬁcation, which was considerably
higher than in negative ion mode (36.9%) due in part to the much
greater occurrence of multiply charged ions (~ 10% of all features). It
should be noted that multiply charged ions can be peptides, proteins
or high molecular weight metabolites capable of carrying multiple
charges. Approximately 25% of these excluded features are isotopic
peaks. These are annotated and linked to the related molecular ion.
In the workﬂow for metabolite annotation, all isotope and FT artifact
peaks are labelled with the accurate identiﬁcation observed for the
molecular or adduct ions.

Automated workflows for accurate mass-based putative metabolite identification

 

Using a mass tolerance of 3 ppm, ~6% of the remaining features
were not matched to any unique MFs in the PubChem reference
ﬁle (301507 entries). Seventy-six percent in negative and 60% in
positive ion mode of the remaining features (791 and 1292 features)
were fully annotated and given putative metabolite identiﬁcation
using a revised version of the MD database (31648 entries). The
reference data ﬁle is based on molecules and parent compounds
carrying no charge and is derived from the MMD which contains
an array of information from a wide variety of electronic resources.
The MD data ﬁle was revised by removal (or modiﬁcation) of
charged species of salts e.g. sodium ascorbate, calcium citrate,
metamphetamine hydrochloride. Obvious duplicates of data were
removed and for many common metabolites e.g. amino acids
and sugars only a single stereochemical form of the compound
was retained. The included form usually related to the one most
well described in HMDB, and if not present in HMDB then as
described in KEGG, and if not present in HMDB and KEGG then as
described in LIPIDMAPS and resulted in a much cleaner dataset for
putative metabolite identiﬁcation. A fairly stringent mass tolerance
of 3 ppm. was used in this analysis and in a number of cases the
annotation of adducts is based on strong evidence, but the exact mass
matching may be outside the allowed tolerance. This is certainly
seen for metabolites such as tryptophan where many ions/adducts
are detected, some of which are within the 3 ppm. mass tolerance
and others, particularly K and NaCl/HCOONa adducts of low
response, are in the mass error range of 3—10p.p.m. Increasing
the mass tolerance would result in more of these adducts being
correctly matched but would greatly increase the overall number
of putative metabolite identiﬁcations through matching to a greater
number of MFs. This is possible if further data are acquired to
reduce the number of potential hits (e.g. 13C/12C isotope ratios
or MS/MS fragmentation). Additionally, neither reference ﬁle had
‘complete’ information relevant to the human metabolome—the
MMD is from a wide variety of sources and includes drugs (but not
drug metabolites), and the PubChem reference ﬁle contains a limited
number of elements and limited numbers of atoms per element.

The workﬂow for correlation analysis processed correlation data
in 3—20 min depending on the option selected and the number of
features. The workﬂow for metabolic feature annotation processed
the negative ion data in ~3 min for the PubChem reference ﬁle. In
positive ion mode with 100% more peaks and nearly 5 times as
many correlations, the processing time was <20 min. The number
of correlations is the rate determining factor and in most cases
processing is <30 min and frequently <5 min. The workﬂow for
metabolite annotation matched MF derived from experimental data
to IMF in MMD rapidly when fewer than 5000 matches were
present. This process took just over 1 min to perform in each ion
mode. However, when using large reference ﬁles such as PubChem,
typically up to 30 000 matches, processing time may be of the order
of 1 h.

The workﬂows developed are automated, rapid, open-source and
freely available with all features fully annotated or given putative
metabolite identiﬁcations. The approach is ﬂexible, it is independent
of chromatographic deconvolution method and analytical instrument
applied. Additional adducts can be added to the adducts ﬁle for
user— speciﬁc instruments, and data and organism-speciﬁc metabolite
reference ﬁles can be used. Two additional differently formatted
outputs are available for all matched features and the workﬂows
have the potential to be integrated with other Taverna workﬂows.

Large numbers of features are recognized as artifact, isotope,
salt and multiply charged ions and removed from the metabolite
identiﬁcation process. This in combination with data with good
mass accuracy (in raw data or following post-acquisition mass
alignment) results in a greatly reduced number of putative metabolite
identiﬁcations within a speciﬁed mass tolerance (typically 3 ppm.
for the ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc LTQ-Orbitrap acquired data). Using
this approach, putative metabolite identiﬁcation does not depend on
a high level of experience in dealing with MS data and can be used
as a starting point for subsequent deﬁnitive identiﬁcation.

A number of false positives are always found although they
are signiﬁcantly reduced using this approach by annotation of ion
type prior to assignment of accurate m/z to IMF or metabolite.
Wide variation in m/z or RT range or missing values following
deconvolution can result in any or all of the following: (i) mass
difference can be outside mass tolerance limits (e. g. missed adduct);
(ii) RT difference between two features may be outside given value
(missed grouping); and (iii) correlation between two features may
be below speciﬁed limit (missed adduct, missed grouping). Within
the software, allowance is made for this, for example, a feature
(sodium adduct) that has a correlation with the parent metabolite
below the correlation limit will not be grouped with this feature.
However, if the m/z is within the mass tolerance it will still be
putatively identiﬁed as the appropriate sodiated ion. Additional
grouping information based on correlation is present in the output
ﬁle and can assist the user when two or more MFs matches are
reported for a feature.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The workﬂows presented are rapid and high-throughput and
greatly reduce the number of false positives by eliminating the
inaccurate matching of many artifact, isotope and complex adduct
peaks. Subsequent deﬁnitive identiﬁcation employing at least two
properties of sample-derived metabolite and an authentic chemical
standard (typically RT and fragmentation mass spectrum) can then
be performed. Additional information based on similarity measures
(e. g. metabolite class or metabolite pathway) are being incorporated
into the Manchester Metabolomics Database and will allow in time
for further interrogation of the biological changes of interest within
microbial, plant and mammalian metabolomic studies. Further
developments are planned to amalgamate the separate workﬂows
together and to integrate with separate workﬂows to increase the
applicability and ease of data analysis and interpretation.

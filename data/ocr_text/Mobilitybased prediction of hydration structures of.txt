Abstract

Motivation: Hydration largely determines solubility, aggregation of proteins and influences
interactions between proteins and drug molecules. Despite the importance of hydration, structural
determination of hydration structure of protein surfaces is still challenging from both experimental
and theoretical viewpoints. The precision of experimental measurements is often affected by fluctu—
ations and mobility of water molecules resulting in uncertain assignment of water positions.
Results: Our method can utilize mobility as an information source for the prediction of hydration
structure. The necessary information can be produced by molecular dynamics simulations
accounting for all atomic interactions including water—water contacts. The predictions were vali—
dated and tested by comparison to more than 1500 crystallographic water positions in 20 hydrated
protein molecules including enzymes of biomedical importance such as cyclin—dependent kinase 2.
The agreement with experimental water positions was larger than 80% on average. The predictions
can be particularly useful in situations where no or limited experimental knowledge is available on
hydration structures of molecular surfaces.

1 Introduction

OXFORD

Water molecules located on protein surfaces play fundamental struc—
tural and functional roles in biology. For example, hydrogen bonds
formed by waters stabilize protein structure (Nisius and Grzesiek,
2012) and affect folding (Cheung et 61]., 2002; Levy and Onuchic,
2006). Surface water molecules are mediators of the assembly of ﬂ—
amyloid protofilaments of Alzheimer’s disease (Thirumalai et 61].,

2011) and there is evidence that structurally conserved waters are
parts of electron transfer networks (Antonyuk et 61]., 2013) such as
respiratory chain (de la Lande et 61]., 2010). Structures of many G—
protein—coupled receptors are also stabilized by hydration (Angel
et 61]., 2009). A recent study (Xu and Leitner, 2014) suggests
that structural water molecules are also involved in thermal

conductance of proteins, in photochemistry, as well as playing a fun-
damental role in charge transfer, allostery and energy flow (Fang
et al., 2009).

Water molecules are often considered essential parts of the pro—
tein structure (Petsko and Ringe, 2009) and the first hydration shell
is a key determinant of the solubility and aggregation of solute mol—
ecules (Israelachvili and Wennerstrom, 1996). Protein—protein and
protein—ligand interactions are influenced by surface—bound water
molecules, and therefore, knowledge of their location is of great im-
portance during structure—based drug design (Baron et al., 2012;
Garcia—Sosa, 2013). Tightly bound water molecules can affect the
chemical diversity of designed ligands (Garcia—Sosa and Mancera,
2006) leading to simple rules for the use of water molecules in drug
design (Garcia—Sosa et al., 2005) and also in interpretation of lig-
and—based pharmacophore models (Lloyd et al., 2004). Inclusion of
explicit water molecules in drug design (Mancera, 2007) have been
thoroughly studied and was found to be of central importance in lig-
and—protein docking (Roberts and Mancera, 2008; Thilagavathi
and Mancera, 2010).

Although hydration structure is important, it has hitherto proven
to be very difficult to determine at the atomic level by experimental
means largely due to mobility and complexity of interactions of
water molecules located on a protein surface. The residence of a
water molecule on the surface and its exchange with bulk are af—
fected not primarily by the strength of protein—water interactions,
but it is ‘rather a topography that prevents the water molecule from
exchanging by a cooperative mechanism’ (Halle, 2004a).
Importantly, such a cooperative mechanism of exchange also gov—
erns several water—water interactions that can often be detected be—
tween surface water molecules (Finney, 1977). It is problematic to
handle (and to predict) the residence of water molecules in the hy—
dration layer of a protein using merely thermodynamic or kinetic
approaches (Halle, 2004a).

Crystallography is the prime experimental method for detection
of water positions, via electron density maps and used as the de
facto standard (Savage and Wlodawer, 1986). However, there are
still numerous limitations of this method coming from low reso—
lution of large structural assemblies (Finney, 1977), assignment
problems (Afonine et al., 2013; Badger et al., 1997), and artifacts
due to cryogenic temperatures used (Halle, 2004b).

A number of computational methods have been proposed for
prediction of hydration structure on protein surfaces. Such methods
generally require the ‘dry’ protein structure as an input and provide
predictions for hydration structure using a variety of algorithms. A
large group of the methods uses fast and simplified approaches dis—
regarding exchange (mobility) between surface and bulk water mol—
ecules and dynamics of the hydration structure. They assume a static
picture of hydration shells and focus on finding appropriate binding
sites of water molecules on the protein surface using scoring
schemes, energy calculations (Schymkowitz et al., 2005), prior
knowledge (Pitt and Goodfellow, 1993), H—bonding information
(Vedani and Huhta, 1991) or artificial neural networks (Ehrlich
et al., 1998). Several studies (Makarov et al., 1998; Truchon et al.,
2014; Virtanen et al., 2010) have dealt with construction and use of
density distribution functions of hydration shells for different atom
types occurring in proteins. Limitations of generalized, density-
based approaches were discussed in detail (Henchman and
McCammon, 2002). These methods ignore dynamics and coopera—
tivity governing hydration.

With advancement of computational infrastructure and force
fields, the efficiency and chemical accuracy of atomic level Monte—
Carlo and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has increased

enormously in the past decades (Michel et al., 2009; Pettitt and
Karplus, 1987) enabling their applications in cutting edge drug de—
sign projects (Dror et al., 2012). It has become a routine task to gen—
erate MD trajectories with explicit water molecules for virtually any
protein of interest. Atomistic simulations of MD hold a conceptual
advantage over the static or density—based (trained) methods as the
mobility, a key determinant of hydration structure is described dir—
ectly at atomic level. Whereas such benefits of atomic MD calcula—
tions have been extensively used in analyses (Schoenborn et al.,
1995), there are not many MD—based methods for prediction of the
hydration structure (Abel et al., 2008; Cui et al., 2013; Henchman
and McCammon, 2002). These approaches focus on all individual
positions of hydrating water molecules and apply various evaluation
schemes such as the definition of time averaged positions
(Henchman and McCammon, 2002) for calculation of the hydration
structure. In this study, we introduce a mobility—based atomic—level
method for prediction of hydration structure of molecular surfaces
using only ‘dry’ protein structures as input. Our method was tested
on 20 proteins, and the corresponding computational procedures
are provided in a program MobyWat, which can be used in conjunc—
tion with any MD software that can produce all—atom MD
trajectories.

2 Algorithm
2.1 Prediction

Logging molecular movements of all water molecules during a time
period provides mobility information required by the prediction pro—
cess used here. Such a log—book (a trajectory) is preferably generated
by MD calculations with an explicit water model. Generation of
molecular trajectories was performed by the GROMACS (Hess
et al., 2008; Pronk et al., 2013) MD package in this study. During
additional post—MD and preparatory steps a standard protocol was
followed (Supplementary Methods S1.2).

Mobility information of the trajectory is transformed into the
hydration structure of the protein surface during the prediction pro—
cess outlined in Figure 1. All predictions can be performed with the
program MobyWat designed and written in C implementing the pre-
diction protocols of this study. Detailed descriptions of the algo—
rithms can be found in Supplementary Algorithm S21 and also in
the User’s Manual of the program.

Brieﬂy, during the prediction procedure, MobyWat performs
clustering of water molecules in candidate pools filtered from the
corresponding MD frames. Besides the usual spatial position—based
(POS) clustering, an identity (ID)—based algorithm was also intro—
duced with ranking variants named all—inclusive (IDa) and elitist
(IDe, Supplementary Algorithm S2.1.5). The procedure ends up in
prediction lists including the coordinates and mobility values of
water molecules in Protein Databank (PDB) format. A merged
(MER) prediction list can be also produced combining the results of
the above IDa, IDe and POS predictions.

2.2 Validation

The identification of matches between experimental and pre—
dicted water positions is used for validating algorithms of
MobyWat. From the matches, a success rate (SRX) value is calcu—
lated for a prediction list (XzIDa, IDe, POS or MER, Eq. 1).
The higher the SRX value, the more successful a prediction is in com—
parison with crystallographic water positions. For comparison
and estimation of the effect of clustering, per frame SR" values

3 Results and Discussion

3.1 Sampling versus predictions

MobyWat predictions are based on atomic mobility data of all water
molecules obtained from MD simulations. In this study, mobility of
a predicted water molecule is defined by its occupancy value

(Supplementary Eq. S2). Occupancy can be counted using a collec—
tion (sample) of hydrated protein structures. Such a sample can be
collected as a series of hydrated experimental structures of the same
protein (Carugo, 1999; Patel et al., 2014), or generated by computa—
tional methods. Sample collection from experimental structures is
not an option for this purpose as the number of hydrated structures
is limited to available entries available in the PDB. In addition, if
there are hydrated PDB structures available, then comparative ana—
lysis can be performed by other tools (Garcia—Sosa et al., 2003; Patel
et al., 2014) which proved to be useful for selection of consensus or
conserved water molecules.

However, in most of the cases, only a single structure of the
same protein is available. Thus, computational generation of hydra—
tion states of a protein is presently the only tractable approach to
produce an appropriate sample even if only a ‘dry’ protein surface is
available lacking experimentally determined positions of water mol—
ecules. Among computational techniques atomic level MD simula—
tion with an explicit water model is the obvious choice of sampling
method. The user needs to supply only a ‘dry’ protein structure and
a series of hydrated protein structures are resulted as an MD trajec—
tory. MD—generated, raw hydration structures are sometimes used
even as references in comparison with other methods (Ross et al.,
2012). However, important parameters such as the minimal length
of an MD simulation necessary for a predictive sampling have not
been determined. To address this question, 1—us—long MD simula-
tions were performed for the protein systems of the validation set
producing a sample of 1000 frames spaced at 1 ns. SR" values were
calculated for each pool according to Eq. 1 and plotted in Figure 2A
for Alzheimer’s amyloid precursor protein (system 2FMA).
Descriptive statistics of SR" values are provided for all validation
systems in Supplementary Table S4. The descriptive statistics show a
good performance of raw MD sampling with mean SR" values rang-
ing between 44.6 and 72.7. The SR" values fluctuate randomly dur—
ing the 1 us time—scale of the trajectory (Fig. 2A). This finding can be
explained by the short residence time of water molecules in the hy—
dration shell of protein surface (Halle, 2004a). During 1 us water
molecules can change their positions many times, and occurrence of
frames with large SR" values (with a lot of matching water pos—
itions) is unpredictable and non—deterministic.

In summary, MD provides an appropriate sampling with good
SR" values. However, the performance of a ‘prediction’ based on a
single frame (randomly) picked from a trajectory is non—determinis—
tic. Thus, a valid prediction cannot be guaranteed if using only one
frame. Processing several frames of a trajectory may be a better way
to maximize SR and arrive at valid predictions. Accordingly, valid—
ation, calibration and measurement of the performance of predic—
tion algorithms are described in the forthcoming sections.

3.2 Validation, performance and robustness

The prediction parameters dmax, ctol and ptol (Supplementary
Table S3) were calibrated for all four types of prediction algorithms
implemented in MobyWat. The calibration process is documented
in Supplementary Results S3.2. Optimal sampling conditions were
also determined, as the final step of the validation process. Using
calibrated values of parameters, MobyWat predictions were per—
formed for all proteins by processing 1000 coordinate frames from
1—us—long trajectories. The results are shown for system 2FMA
(Fig. 2A), and for all systems of the Validation set (Supplementary
Table S4). The SR values yielded by the predictions were signifi-
cantly higher than the mean SR" from raw MD, and in many cases
they were close to the maximal SR" values. Thus, all four algorithms

aMean and standard deviation (SD) values of success rates were calculated
for systems of external test and validation separately. bSampling conditions:
10 ns MD run time, 1.0001 x 104 frames. cSuccess rates of MobyWat predic-
tions were calculated with default mtol = 1.5 A, bmax = 30.0 A2, a'max = 3.5 A,
ptol = 2.5  and 6,01 according to Supplementary Table S5.

resulted in valid predictions. Whereas sampling of 1—us—long trajec—
tories provided good predictions, such simulations with explicit
waters can be computationally demanding. Figure 2A shows that
SRIDa values exceeded the SR" curve and reached a plateau relatively
early, after 100—200 ns sampling time. This finding suggested that
shortening the sampling time should be possible without a large
drop in SR of the prediction. Increasing the sampling frequency
(frame count) is also a logical step to achieve reliable predictions
with shortened sampling time. Indeed, results in Table 1 reveal that
10—ns—long trajectories with increased frame count yielded mean SR
values of >80% for the Validation set, similarly to the 1-us-long
runs (Supplementary Table S4).

Figure 2B shows that the good performance of ID—based predic—
tion algorithms was preserved at 1, 5 and 10 ns sampling times aver—
aged for all systems used in Validation set. In the cases of MER and
POS, there is a 5% increase in average SR values if comparing trajec—
tories of 1 and 10ns length. In summary, the ID—based algorithms
outperformed POS and MER predictions, and they provide good
predictions even at 1 ns sampling time (Table 1, Fig. 2B).

To evaluate system—independence of our method, a test of the
predictions was performed. Systems of Test set 1 (1UBQ, 1WLA
and 6LYZ) have relatively moderate resolution and a low number of
assigned water positions per protein surface area (Supplementary
Table S1). The same set had been used earlier in a study (Virtanen
et al., 2010) applying a solvent density—based approach. Detailed
comparison of our results using the standards of the earlier study
(Supplementary Results S3.3) indicates that overall performance of
MobyWat is good if compared with solvent density—based results.
For comparability with the above validation results performance of
MobyWat on Test set 1 was also evaluated using the standards of
this study and the results are listed separately in Table 1. All four al-
gorithms provide valid predictions with SR significantly higher than
average values of SR". Moreover, the mean SR values of Test set 1
are comparable to or slightly higher than mean SR values obtained
for Validation set (Table 1) indicating system—independence of the
method.

1E2H, C) and glutathione S-transferase (system 16GS, D). Ligands were inserted from superimposed ligand-bound enzyme structures (PDB codes 1HCK, 1E2| and
5GSS) for comparison with water positions. Match distances between crystallographic (red spheres) and predicted (blue spheres) water oxygen atoms are given
in A. Conserved and replaceable water molecules are marked with C and asterisk at the distance values, respectively

Reproducibility is also a key issue of robustness. As MobyWat
operations are reproducible by their algorithmic definition, reprodu-
cibility tests can be performed for the MD sampling process. MD
trajectories are inherently chaotic in practical applications due to
hardware—dependent rounding of floating point calculations, the use
of dynamic load balancing in parallel execution and so on.
Therefore, it is common to repeat MD calculations with different
starting atomic velocity values to test the convergence of trajecto—
ries. Practically, this can be done by selecting different seed numbers
of the velocity generator routine. During the tests, three MD trajec—
tories of all systems were produced using three different sets of ini-
tial velocities. For these trajectories, predictions were made using
the top performer algorithms of Table 1.

The corresponding three SR values were averaged for all systems
and plotted in Figure 2C. Their standard deviations are found to be
small compared with mean values for all systems, and MD sampling
is therefore shown to be reproducible in terms of SR. Improvements
in the quality of force fields, in particular the introduction of polar—
ization, may improve the reproducibility of water prediction further
(Lopes et al., 2013).

During validations and tests, MobyWat automatically calculated
SR values using a match tolerance of 1.5  which is the upper limit
for the detection of matches between predicted and reference water
molecule pairs (Section 2.2). To further quantify the precision of
matches, statistics of distances of all matched pairs of the top per—
former algorithms were calculated (Fig. 2D). It can be seen that
mean match distances are below 1  for all systems. Matching water
positions of one of the systems is shown in Figure 3A, and three
other systems are depicted in Supplementary Figure S4.

3.3 Featured test examples
Test set 2 containing 12 proteins was assembled to further check the
performance of MobyWat predictions. Using prediction algorithm
IDa, a mean SR of 87% was achieved for this set. The members of
Test set 2 and the resulted SR values are listed in Supplementary
Table S8. Below the prediction results obtained for three enzymatic
systems of Test set 2 are discussed focusing on their active sites.
Cyclin—dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) is a key enzyme in cell cycle
control and a promising drug target in oncology (Akli et al., 2011)
that also affects senescence (Chenette, 2010). A change of the hydra—
tion structure of the active site of Cdk2 due to ligand binding has
been reported with obvious implications for drug design (Schulze-
Gahmen et al., 1996). A good agreement was obtained between pre—
dicted (blue spheres, Fig. 3B) and experimental reference (red
spheres) water positions verifying that MobyWat accurately pre—
dicted the hydration structure of the active site of apo Cdk2
(Fig. 3B). Notably, experimental water positions were used in com—
parisons of Figures. 3B—D without any restrictions on their B—fac—
tors. Insertion of the ligand (ATP, thin lines in Fig. 3B) from the
superimposed ATP—bound Cdk2 structure reveals that six waters
(marked with asterisks in Fig. 3) are displaced by the ligand during
binding. Release of such water molecules has a favorable contribu—
tion to binding entropy of the ligand, and therefore, their identifica-
tion is important for thermodynamics-driven engineering of new
ligands. The results were not affected by the chemical nature of lig—
and binding as waters replaced by both the charged phosphate moi—
eties and the non—charged adenine ring were found correctly. This
finding is in agreement with our general results showing that predic—
tion quality is independent on the type of interacting amino acids

(Supplementary Results $37). The second example (Fig. 3C) fea—
tures the nucleoside binding pocket of thymidine kinase from
Herpes simplex type 1. This enzyme has been involved in enzyme-
prodrug gene therapy of cancer (Vogt et al. 2000). Besides two re—
placeable water molecules, MobyWat precisely predicted several
conserved water positions (marked with C in Fig. 3) existing in both
the apo and the ligand—bound enzyme structures. Similar to the cases
of replaceable water molecules, locating conserved water sites pre—
cisely is also important during the design of new ligands. A complete
chain of waters leading to the active site was also predicted correctly
(top—right corner of Fig. 3C). The third binding pocket in Figure 3D
belongs to glutathione S—transferase, an important detoxifying en-
zyme (Wu and Dong, 2012). Binding chemistry of glutathione, the
peptidic ligand of this enzyme is remarkably different from the pre-
vious two ligands with heteroaromatic cores (Fig. 3B and C).
However, the quality of MobyWat prediction of the surrounding
water positions is similarly good as it was in the other two
examples.

MobyWat produces a prediction list including water positions in
increasing order of mobility scores (Supplementary Algorithm S21.
5) where experimentally verified (positive) predictions are mostly
located at the top of the prediction list. It was found (Supplementary
Results S3.4) that 88% of positive predictions for whole protein sur-
faces are located in the top 50% of the prediction list. As active sites
are the most important spots on enzymes, it was also checked how
mobility scores work for these specific segments of the surface. 20 of

Figures. 3B—D are located in the top 15% of the prediction lists.
Thus, in the cases of active sites investigated, the mobility scores
short—list the positive candidates very efficiently at the top of the pre—
diction list. This indicates that water molecules in the active sites of
enzymes are predicted with higher fidelity than other water mol—
ecules residing on the surface. This result can in part be explained by
the presence of conserved water molecules surrounding the ligands,
most of which are located at the top 5% of prediction lists. Notably,
half of replaceable water molecules occupying active sub—sites in the
apo structures were also ranked at top 10%.

4 Conclusions

MD has become an indispensable tool of prediction of structure of
proteins and protein—ligand complexes (Shan et al., 2011;
Soderhjelm et al., 2012). However, there are only a few MD—based
methods for the prediction of hydration structure using explicit
simulation of water contacts. Here, we presented MobyWat, a freely
available program validated and tested on more than 15 00 experi—
mental water positions in 20 different protein surfaces. The predic—
tion process of MobyWat aims at finding the least mobile (most
occupied) points of the hydration structure. It was shown that MD
simulation is an appropriate sampling technique for such predic—
tions. MobyWat performs predictions using mobility information
cumulated in MD trajectories. Two predictive approaches were im—
plemented and tested. The first approach uses only spatial informa-
tion (coordinates) for a candidate water position. This can be done
for example by averaging trajectory frames and producing solvent
densities (Virtanen et al., 2010) or by clustering water molecules
along the trajectory and counting frequencies of their occurrence in
candidate positions. In this study, a second approach was introduced
based on identification records of water molecules rather than spa—
tial positions. On average, the identity—based predictions provided
higher success rate values than positional and merged algorithms.

This is probably a consequence of the position—independent philoso—
phy of the identity—based algorithms.

Valid predictions do not require trajectories from long MD runs.
The typical lifetime of a hydrogen bond is a few pico seconds only,
virtually independent of the environment (van der Spoel et al.,
2006). Consequently, due to rapid exchange and equilibration of
water positions relatively short simulations (e.g. 1—10 ns) with regu—
lar saving of coordinates suffice. Thus, with a moderate computa—
tional effort valid predictions can be achieved.

Limitations of mobility—based predictions were also investigated
via an analysis of non—matched water positions of eight systems
(Supplementary Results S37 and Appendix 2). The analysis identi-
fied location of waters above shallow protein sites and/or far from
the surface to be a limiting factor in a few cases. Further work is on
the way to overcome such limitations using a relative coordinate
definition and testing combined MD sampling schemes.

MobyWat algorithms were coded in the portable C language. As
the program has to perform calculations on numerous atoms in nu—
merous frames (e.g. 104 X 104) special attention was paid to the effi—
cient use of memory. MobyWat can be used in conjunction with any
MD program as it reads frames from PDB files. However, for effi-
cient use of memory and disk space MobyWat also reads and writes
xdr—type portable binary trajectory files called xtc in GROMACS.

Mobility is often considered as a disturbing property hampering
experimental determination of positions of water molecules on pro—
tein surfaces. In this study, it was shown that mobility can be uti—
lized as an information source for prediction of hydration structure.
If experimental determination of water structure is not available or
incomplete, MobyWat can offer an alternative solution.

ABSTRACT

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)
code specified nearly 25 years ago provides a nomenclature for
incompletely specified nucleic acids. However, no system currently
exists that allows for the informatics representation of the relative
abundance at polymorphic nucleic acids (e.g. single nucleotide
polymorphisms) in a single specified character, or a string of
characters. Here, I propose such an information code as a natural
extension to the IUPAC nomenclature code, and present some
potential uses and limitations to such a code. The primary anticipated
use of this extended nomenclature code is to assist in the
representation of the rapidly growing space of information in human
genetic variation.

1 INTRODUCTION

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)
code speciﬁed nearly 25 years ago provides a nomenclature for
incompletely speciﬁed nucleic acids (Cornish—Bowden, 1985). The
correct origin of the code is with the International Union of
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) but it has become
more widely known as the IUPAC code. The IUPAC code,
presented in Table 1, has been applied in a wide—ranging manner,
contributing to many biologically and chemically meaningful
representations, including: (i) recognition sequences (e.g. restriction
enzymes, protein and RNA binding sites, consensus signals);
(ii) codon degeneracy; (iii) sequence base calling ambiguity;
(iv) representation of ancestral states in phylogenetics; and (V) to
a vast extent in the ﬁelds of genetics and genomics in representing
polymorphic nucleic acids, e. g. single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs). However, no system currently exists that allows for the
informatics representation of the relative abundance at polymorphic
nucleic acids (e.g. SNPs) in a single speciﬁed character or a string
of characters. Here I propose such an information code, displayed
in Table 2, as a natural extension to the IUPAC nomenclature
code, and present some potential uses and limitations to such a
code. The original IUPAC code remains useful in all its previous
applications and is also compatible as a subset of the extended
code proposed here. The extended IUPAC code allows for new
nucleic acid representations, in single characters or character strings,

with potential applications in genetics, cross—species or cross—
strain comparison, sequence alignment, bioinformatics, genome
assembly, database design and querying and chemical sequencing
and synthesis. The primary anticipated use of this extended
nomenclature code is to assist in the representation of the rapidly
growing space of information on human genetic variation.

1.1 IUPAC code for incomplete nucleic acid
speciﬁcation

The IUPAC code is a l6—character code which allows the ambiguous
speciﬁcation of nucleic acids (Table l). The code can represent states
that include single speciﬁcations for nucleic acids (A, G, C, T/U) or
allows for ambiguity among 2, 3 or 4 possible nucleic acid states.
The IUPAC code is, in principle, case insensitive, but its established
uses generally default to the capital case.

1.2 Extended IUPAC code for speciﬁcation of relative
nucleic acid prevalence

The extension of the standard IUPAC code is a character case—
sensitive code that includes all 16 original IUPAC characters with
similar meanings intact (Tables 2 and 3). This code relies on the
use of character case information, additional available alphabetic
characters, bolding and underlining to specify the ordering of all
possible combinations and interrelationships containing 2 (Table 2)

or 3 (Table 3) nucleic acid states. Speciﬁcation of all possible
orderings for four nucleic acids in a single character is not possible
in the alphabetic system, since this requires 24 unique characters
or more if interrelationships are considered, and only ‘P’/ ‘p’ and
‘Q’/ ‘q’ remain unspeciﬁed here. Instead, the extended code makes
use of additional ASCII characters to represent states for four nucleic
acids (Supplementary Table 81). The system for 2 nt combinations
is relatively straightforward with bold case in instances where the
two bases are represented in equal proportion (Table 2).

There are four classes of 3 nt groupings possible. Within each
class, there are 13 possible relationships among the three nucleotides
(represented in each of four subparts of Table 3). Bold case is again
reserved for equality among all three states. The most common
expected states where there will be differential states or counts for
all three nucleotides are highlighted in gray. In uncommon cases
where there is equality for two of the nucleotides, this is indicated
using the corresponding underline character. While the code is more
complex and less readable than previous human codes, the ability
to specify all states means that it will be relatively straightforward
to develop programmatic translation tables for process like strand
ﬂipping or rapid summarization of data across many sequences.

2 DISCUSSION

The development of an extended IUPAC code was primarily
motivated by informatics issues within the realm of databases
and research relating to genetic variability. It is predicted that
in the near future full genome sequencing of many humans may
be feasible and cost—effective, and that patients may approach
clinicians, counselors and researchers for interpretations of their
primary sequence data. While much attention has been paid to
developing technologies to make such a situation feasible, little
attention has been paid to the informatics challenges that would
accompany it. Assembling and storing this volume of data is feasible
with current computing standards, although perhaps not trivial when

many genomes are considered (e.g. the 1000 Genomes Project,

and evolving picture of human genetic variation. A recent survey
of CLIA—tested variants indicates that the majority of these are

not precisely mapped or represented against the human genome
or within the major databases of genetic variation (Johnson et al.,
2010). At the same time, the reference human genome sequence
which is used in a wide range of informatics tools (e.g. BLAST)
contains nucleic acids at some positions that are found at the lowest
abundance in the general population, with potential implications
for processes that rely on the reference sequence. Furthermore,
as sequencing efforts and deposition in databases like GenBank
continue we will continue to discover and align more variation,
particularly variants that are rare or private to particular subsets of
individuals. Thus, we would be hard pressed given current standards
and available databases to rapidly provide an individual with a nearly
complete picture of where their personal sequence deviated from
some reference group or even to provide a concise informational
representation of a ‘reference group’ sequence itself. The realities
of the coming informatics challenges of individual human genomes
are highlighted in the recent releases of four full human genome
sequences (Bentley et al., 2008; Levy et al., 2007; Wang et al.,
2008; Wheeler et al., 2008).

While the current IUPAC code allows incomplete nucleic acid
speciﬁcation, it requires additional information such as allele strand
and relative allele frequencies for many analyses. This information
is by necessity disconnected from the primary sequence information,
or requires the speciﬁcation of multiple, and sometimes many
sequences. This often complicates algorithmic processes involving
sequence data or genetic analysis, for instance by necessitating
the integration of information on the ﬂanking sequence, strand
orientation and relative allele abundances. This has important
implications for instance in imputation methods which estimate
unknown genotypes given prior known patterns, which can be
confounded to some degree by problems with strand orientation and
incompletely speciﬁed nucleic acids (de Bakker et al., 2008; Franke
et al., 2008). The alternative system presented here could assist
by providing an unambiguous code within primary polymorphic
sequences, and may also facilitate a wide range of potential
applications.

2.1 Advantages and applications of an extended IUPAC
code

Allowing for an extended IUPAC code for the representation
of sequences has a number of potential advantages both in the
representation and presentation of polymorphic sequences, and in
potential future bioinformatics and analytic applications, with a
number of simulated examples presented in Figure 1. Using the
extended IUPAC code it would be possible to create a single
reference sequence that summarizes the dominant and recessive
allele codings across a group of sequences with storage savings
proportional to N, where N = the number of sequences summarized.
This would make it feasible to summarize genetic variation and
SNP annotations for instance across 1000 individual genomes.
Combined with other strategies for compression and representation
of genome sequences, individual personal genome sequences and
summaries for meaningful reference sequence groups (Fig. 1E)
could realistically be e—mailed or transferred on portable media
(Brandon et al., 2009; Christley et al., 2009). Lean storage formats
should also facilitate the ability to rapidly determine where a de novo
sequence differs from a known reference summary of genetic
variants for a group of sequences of interest (Fig. 1A and B).

A number of additional practical applications of the extended
IUPAC code are possible. The extended code could also be used
to specify the relative allele frequencies for triallelic SNPs in
databases (e. g. dbSNP), where the third allele is often but not always
relatively uncommon. This has possible important implications
for sequence—based analyses and genotyping assay design (e.g.
Huebner et al., 2007). There are also potential clinical implications
when diagnostic laboratories rely on reference sequences to design
custom genotyping assays or sequencing primers. For example, the
cystic ﬁbrosis gene CF TR and breast cancer genes BRCA1 and
BRCA2 contain hundreds of known disease—causing mutations and
hundreds more common variants, including triallelic SNPs. These
gene regions are routinely sequenced in diagnostics and research, but
the many variants in these gene regions can make interpretations
challenging and have the potential to confound sequence assay
probes. The construction of important gene reference sequences
(e. g. CF TR) using the extended IUPAC code could facilitate better
assay design by enabling design algorithms to avoid polymorphic
regions or preferentially select a probe that will contain the most
common allele in a given population. The construction of disease—
or condition—speciﬁc IUPAC masks for groups of important variants
(Fig. 1B) could also facilitate initial categorization and visualization
of de novo sequences relative to summaries of what is known.

With the ability to represent the relative abundance of
polymorphic genetic sequences in a single character or string,
a number of additional potential applications include: (i) the
less ambiguous speciﬁcation of alleles relative to their genomic
strand without additional information (Fig. 1A); (ii) the facile
and unambiguous summarization of relative abundances of nucleic
acids among meaningful groups (e.g. patients versus controls,
tumors of speciﬁc types, tumor cell subtypes within single tumors,
biological strains with different virulence characteristics, population
groupings) (Fig. 1B and E); (iii) simpliﬁed sequence speciﬁcation
of polymorphisms within genomes or sequence databases with
ramiﬁcations for sequence alignment (e.g. BLAST) and the
assembly and analysis of de novo sequence data (Fig. 1D); (iv) in
phylogenetics applications, particularly in the representation of

proportions associated with ancestral states (Lewis, 2001), and the
resolution of non—binary nodes; (v) representation and analysis of
differing sequences in triploid genomes; and (vi) the ability to
specify preferred differential nucleic acid states in a high—throughput
environment [e.g. probe design where SNPs may cause problems
(Koboldt et al., 2006), preferred recognition sequences, sequence tag
or SELEX analysis] (Fig. 1C). The code has the additional advantage
of being fairly straightforward to operationalize and is an inclusive
extension of the IUPAC code that is already used.

2.2 Potential limitations of an extended IUPAC code

While the extended IUPAC code provides a less ambiguous code
than the standard IUPAC code, it remains a relatively ambiguous
code with a number of implications. First, the application of such
a code certainly does not replace the need for more detailed
speciﬁcation of relative nucleic acid abundances in many cases. For
instance, two different polymorphisms encoding G>A transitions
would similarly be represented as ‘r’ even if the observed population
allele frequencies are G (50.1%)>A (49.9%) and G (99.9%)>A
(0.1%), respectively. Further, in the case of specifying preferred
sequence recognition sites for transcription factor binding, a position
weight matrix (PWM) would provide more detailed and quantitative
information than an extended IUPAC coding. Such PWMs are useful
in deriving graphical representations of relative preferences. These
are widely applied extensions of an original sequence logos proposal
for consensus sequence representation (Scheinder and Stephens,
1990). Thus, most systems or databases that might employ the
extended IUPAC code would likely do so while still retaining more
detailed information (e.g. information about ﬂanking sequences
and population allele frequencies). A further limitation is that this
code by itself provides no assistance in addressing more complex
variants such as insertions, deletions, repeats and copy number
variants.

A potential pitfall to the use of an extended IUPAC code is
that software may not be equipped to handle, may ignore or may
otherwise employ case—speciﬁc character information. In most cases,
it is expected that software will simply ignore case sensitivity
resulting in little difference. However, where useful, software
could be reconﬁgured to recognize whether unambiguous sequence,
standard IUPAC coding or extended IUPAC coding is employed if
the user speciﬁes it. The difference between standard and extended
IUPAC coding may not be computer auto—detectable, particularly
for short sequences, and thus software should default to the
standard IUPAC coding unless otherwise speciﬁed. Interpretations
that default to the standard IUPAC code will likely perform as
always since the two codes are essentially compatible. The format
of nucleic acid ﬁles or database entries could be speciﬁed in any
representation. For example, in the instance of FASTA type nucleic
acid sequences, format could be speciﬁed in the header line, as
‘FORMAT=SEQ’, ‘FORMAT=IUPAC’ or ‘FORMAT: IUPACX’ or
ﬁle naming conventions could be represented as ‘.FASTA’, ‘.FASTI’
and ‘.FASTX’, respectively.

A potential confounding case could arise when polymorphic
nucleic acids are speciﬁed within repeat masked sequences which
may subsequently be translated to lower case. In such cases, it is
suggested that the repeat masking program should ﬂip the IUPAC
case as it does with the other characters except for N in (whether
standard or extended).

3 CONCLUSION

While the use of an extended IUPAC code is not appropriate
in many cases and is not intended to replace the need for
detailed primary sequence databases, it may provide more efﬁcient
representations of consensus sequences for a variety of applications.
In particular, the application of such a code may allow simpliﬁed
representations of polymorphic nucleic acids within, and among,
species, and other meaningful groupings. It may not be appropriate
to have one reference omnibus representation of the human genome
as we gain understanding of more individual DNA sequences
worldwide; however, the availability of accurate summarizations
of meaningful but differing groups of sequences will likely remain
useful to researchers well into the future for both descriptive
and applied purposes. Given the coming explosive growth in
DNA sequencing, the extended IUPAC code may have its greatest
use in summarizing and providing rapid representations of and
identiﬁcation of polymorphic nucleic acids among large groups of
sequences.

Abstract

Motivation: A sizeable fraction of eukaryotic proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions
(lDRs), which act in unfolded states or by undergoing transitions between structured and unstruc—
tured conformations. Over time, sequence—based classifiers of lDRs have become fairly accurate
and currently a major challenge is linking lDRs to their biological roles from the molecular to the
systems level.

Results: We describe DISOPRED3, which extends its predecessor with new modules to predict
lDRs and protein—binding sites within them. Based on recent CASP evaluation results, DISOPRED3
can be regarded as state of the art in the identification of lDRs, and our self—assessment shows that
it significantly improves over DISOPREDZ because its predictions are more specific across the
whole board and more sensitive to lDRs longer than 20 amino acids. Predicted lDRs are annotated
as protein binding through a novel SVM based classifier, which uses profile data and additional se—
quence—derived features. Based on benchmarking experiments with full cross—validation, we show
that this predictor generates precise assignments of disordered protein binding regions and that it
compares well with other publicly available tools.

1 Introduction

 

Proteins experience more or less pronounced structural changes
while performing their functions. In particular, completely unfolded
states or transitions between structured and unstructured conform—
ations are distinguishing features, which enable the physiological
activities of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs). Our understanding of the biological im-
portance and of the widespread occurrence of this phenomenon is
gradually expanding, thanks to the fine—tuning of experimental tech-
niques and to computational genome—wide surveys. The DisProt
database (Sickmeier et 61]., 2007) stores manually curated data for

IDRs, but annotations are accumulating at a very slow rate: DisProt
v. 6.02 reports 1539 IDRs and ~40% of them still have unknown
function. Therefore, bioinformatics plays a major role in researching
the occurrence, the biological function, and the involvement of in-
trinsic disorder in phenotype and disease.

Many computational methods can predict IDRs within protein
sequences (Deng et 61]., 2012; Orosz and Ovadi, 2011). Propensity-
based approaches were inspired by the observed enrichment of polar
and charged amino acids and by the under—representation of hydro—
phobic and aromatic residues in IDRs (Dosztanyi et 61]., 2005;
Linding et 61]., 2003; Prilusky et 61]., 2005). Further comparative

analyses also highlighted differences in the patterns of length, loca—
tion and sequence conservation among IDRs, and machine-learning
techniques have been trained to detect them (Eickholt and Cheng
2013; Hirose et 61]., 2007; Ishida and Kinoshita 2007; Liu and Rost
2003; Shimizu et 61]., 2007a,b; Ward et 61]., 2004). Finally, meta—pre—
dictors integrate the output of independent tools through an array of
algorithms (Ishida and Kinoshita 2008; Kozlowski and Bujnicki
2012; Schlessinger et 61]., 2009).

Objective benchmarking of protein disorder prediction methods
is essential before these can be used for further inferences. CASP
(Critical Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction)
has been testing these predictors since 2002 (Melamud and Moult,
2003) and has tracked moderate progress since. Current prediction
accuracy for IDRs spanning up to 30 residues is estimated at roughly
70% (Monastyrskyy et 61]., 2014) and this has already allowed us to
investigate the role that protein disorder plays in living organisms at
different levels of complexity (Cozzetto and Jones, 2013)—including
the organization and the re—wiring of protein—protein interaction
networks, cellular differentiation and development and human dis—
ease (Buljan et 61]., 2013; Perkins et 61]., 2010).

At the molecular level, it is important to grasp whether IDRs act
as ﬂexible linkers or have binding activity and, if so, what molecules
they recognize. ANCHOR was the first program to tackle the identi—
fication of disordered protein—binding regions (Meszaros et 61].,
2009) using a linear regression model of the estimated stabilizing en—
ergy that IDRs would gain by folding upon binding. The statistical
model was learnt from a small set of chains with evidence for being
unstructured in isolation, but structured in complex with their part-
ners. A few machine learning approaches have been parameterized
on larger sets of solved protein—peptide complexes, where the pep—
tides are likely to be disordered in the unbound state. MoRFpred
(Disfani et 61]., 2012) combines annotation transfers by similarity to
the output of a support vector machine (SVM) that examines se—
quence conservation data, amino—acid physicochemical properties
and predictions of intrinsic disorder, relative solvent accessibility
and residue flexibility. MFSPSSMpred (Fang et 61]., 2013) considers
only sequence profiles, which are pre—processed to enhance the sig—
nal of local conservation within the fast evolving landscape of IDR
sequences. Finally, PepBindPred (Khan et 61]., 2013) first attempts to
estimate the binding affinity of tripeptides from the input sequence
to a library of known protein—binding domains, and then feeds these
data to a bidirectional recurrent neural network along with add—
itional features.

Here we describe the latest incarnation of DISOPRED, which
was originally trained on evolutionarily conserved sequence features
of IDRs from missing residues in high—resolution X—ray structures.
DISOPRED3 extends the previous architecture with two independ—
ent predictors of intrinsic disorder, one module that combines the
intermediate results and one component that annotates protein—
binding IDRs. During the CASP9 and CASP10 experiments aimed at
monitoring the state of the art in IDR prediction from sequence, the
assessors ranked the updated server at the top or near the top across
a range of evaluation measures and test cases (Monastyrskyy et 61].,
2011, 2014). Using the same data, we demonstrate that
DISOPRED3 is more specific than its predecessor and that it pro—
duces more accurate predictions across different IDR lengths and
positions along the test sequences.

Residues in the predicted IDRs are annotated as folding upon
protein binding through a new SVM trained to distinguish short
peptides bound to globular domains from unbound protein
domain linkers using sequence—derived features. Through stringent
cross—validation experiments, we show that this predictor can

generate precise annotations and that it compares well with
ANCHOR, MoRFpred and MFSPSSMpred based on a carefully
assembled test set derived from database annotations and scientific
reports.

2 Methods

2.1 Datasets for protein disorder prediction

The new components aimed at IDR detection were trained with a
concatenation of two datasets. The first was all entries (228 in total)
from the Disprot v5.0 database (Sickmeier et 61]., 2007) ﬂagged as
being derived from either NMR or biophysical methods. The other
dataset was a redundancy—reduced (percentage sequence identity
<90%) subset of high resolution (32.2 A) X—ray structure chains
from PDB (Berman et al., 2000) derived from PISCES (Wang and
Dunbrack, 2005) compiled in February 2010. Chains shorter than
25 amino acids were discarded. Missing residues, including those
with occupancy equal to zero, were treated as disordered.

Position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) scores were calculated
for each residue using three iterations of PSI—BLAST (Altschul et 61].,
1997) running on the UniRef90 data bank (Suzek et 61]., 2007) with
an inclusion E—value threshold of Io : 0.001.

DISOPRED3 was registered as a server at CASP9 and CASP10—
group ids 015 and 170, respectively—and made predictions for all
assessed targets. The corresponding predictions are therefore avail-
able at the Prediction Center website; DISOPRED2 predictions for
the same protein sets were generated as a prerequisite and stored
locally.

The reference classification of the residues as ordered or dis—
ordered was taken from the Prediction Center website and was
based on the structural data available before the final meetings. The
amino acids were regarded as disordered if and only if either they
were not assigned spatial coordinates, or the positions of their Cor
atoms were more than 3.5  away across different chains or NMR
models in the LGA (Zemla, 2003) structural alignment.

2.2 Datasets for protein—binding site prediction

A set of 840 peptides, with lengths between 5 and 25 amino acids
and solved in complex with globular protein domains, was initially
obtained from a previous study (Disfani et 61]., 2012). We discarded
196 peptides that couldn’t be mapped onto UniProtKB (UniProt,
2014) sequences with SIFTS (Velankar et 61]., 2013)—because they
were synthetic constructs, or the PDB files had been superseded, or
the ATOM records mapped onto discontinuous fragments. We also
removed 247 chains sharing 30% or more sequence identity to other
regions, based on the BLASTP alignments generated with the recom—
mended settings for short peptides (—seg no —matrix PAM30 —
gapopen 10 —gapextend 1 —word_size 3). The positive training set
was therefore made up of 5501 amino acids from 397 regions occur—
ring in as many PDB chains (372 UniprotKB sequences). Just 104 of
these UniProtKB chains were also used as positive examples for the
new disordered residue prediction modules. This limited overlap
mostly reflects the different length requirements for inclusion into
the two training sets.

Negative training examples were obtained from unbound protein
domain linker regions in known protein structures. A total of 1164
linkers annotated in CATH v.3.5 (Sillitoe et 61]., 2013) and spanning
between 5 and 60 amino acids were screened for the lack of inter-
actions with other molecules in the same PDB file. Contacts with
other protein and nucleic acid chains were identified when any two
heavy atoms were closer than 6A; for ligands and metal ions the

distance threshold was set to 3.9  As for the positive instances, we
discarded the linkers that didn’t map completely to UniProtKB se—
quences with SIFTS or with at least 30% sequence identity to other
regions. The negative training set consisted of 4930 amino acids
from 373 protein domain linkers occurring in 322 PDB chains (297
UniprotKB sequences).

To build an independent benchmark set, we thoroughly mined
database annotations and scientific reports to collate 29 protein
chains, which have been investigated using biophysical techniques
and have been shown to be disordered in isolation and to fold upon
protein binding. These sequences include 4077 disordered residues
forming 36 regions, within which 37 protein—binding sites occur
spanning between 5 and 47 positions and comprising a total of 708
amino acids. Supplementary Table S1 reports detailed information
about such test proteins, the annotated IDRs and segments undergo—
ing disorder—to—order transitions as they bind other proteins.

2.3 DISOPRED3 neural networks
The design goal for the third version of DISOPRED was to counter
the tendency for DISOPRED2 to under—predict long disordered re—
gions. This was very clear from the independent assessment carried
out in CASP8 (Noivirt—Brik et 61]., 2009). Although the DISOPRED2
SVM offers adjustable specificity, and so allows some reduction of
under—prediction as a whole, we were unable to tune it to specifically
improve long-region prediction. We surmise this is due to the lack of
long disordered regions in the X—ray—derived training sets used to
train DISOPRED2. To try to tackle this issue, we opted to return to
the original neural network based DISOPRED method (Jones
and Ward, 2003), but trained on data rich in long disordered regions
(see Section 2.1). Although we explored SVM classifiers for long-re-
gion prediction, we found the neural network method performed
better on this particular problem. The neural network architecture,
feature set and training procedures were as previously described.

A small second—stage neural network was then trained to com—
bine the three component predictors into a single prediction output.

This small network comprises 15 X 4 inputs, 15 hidden units and
2 output units (ordered/disordered). The 15 X 4 inputs represents a
window of 15 positions centered around the residue being classified,
with 3 outputs from the first—level component methods (SVM, neu—
ral network and nearest neighbor classifier) plus a fourth input per
position to indicate missing data (i.e. where the window extends be—
yond the N or C—terminus). Prediction confidence is estimated by
considering the difference between the two outputs (disordered—
ordered), which effectively compensates for the effects of
unbalanced training, and thus requires no further calibration for the
output difference to be considered directly as a posterior
probability.

2.4 DISOPRED3 nearest neighbor classifier

In addition to the DISOPRED2 SVM and the long—region neural net—
work predictors, we decided to add a third predictor, namely a near—
est neighbor classifier. This was done for practical reasons, because
a nearest neighbor classifier needs no training, and so it is easy to in—
corporate very up—to—date data in the prediction process, whereas
the other classifiers require a great deal of time and effort to train on
new data. The addition of the nearest neighbor classifier thus makes
DISOPRED3 more easily updated and maintained.

Nearest neighbor classification was carried out by comparing
every window of seven residues in the target protein with every
seven—residue window taken from the profiles in the reference set.
This comparison is made on the basis of total PSSM score, and the

order/disorder label for each residue is decided by transferring the
labels from the reference protein windows that have the highest
match scores. In most cases, the label arises from considering the
maximum of 7 scores, as aside from the residues near the termini,
most residues end up contributing to the match scores in seven dif—
ferent offset positions.

2.5 Training procedures for protein—binding site
prediction
To determine residues which might be part of protein—binding sites
within disordered regions, we employed an SVM classifier rather
than a neural network, as the data set was known to be extremely
biased towards negative cases. Using a sliding window of size 15, we
derived three independent SVM classifiers from the training data
that are based on (i) single sequences alone, where each amino acid
was encoded by the similarity values in the corresponding entry in
the Blosum62 matrix; (ii) the PSSM values obtained after three
search iterations of PSI—BLAST against UniRef90 with a profile-in-
clusion threshold of Io : 0.001; (iii) the same PSSM scores, followed
by the length of input region, the start and the end positions of the
region relative to the whole protein chain, a ﬂag for windows ex—
tending beyond the protein termini and the amino acid composition
of the window under consideration. The PSSM scores were linearly
scaled to [0.0, 1.0] based on the maximum and minimum values
observed for each amino acid in the whole training set, while for
protein sequence length the natural logarithmic scale was adopted.
To perform proper cross—validation, separate training runs were
carried out for each of the 29 test proteins. During training, we
excluded from the training data any sequence found to be similar to
the target chain. We used a sequence identity threshold of 25% in
the case of the SVM classifier based on sequence data alone and a
PSI-BLAST E-value cut—off of 0.001 for all profile—based predictors.
We ran LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) with a radial basis function
kernel to identify the trade—off and gamma parameters that give the
highest average Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)—see below
for the definition—across 10—fold cross validation experiments. The
imbalance between the positive and negative classes was addressed
by setting the cost parameter of the positive class to the ratio of
negative to positive examples used for training at each iteration. The
resulting parameters were then passed to LIBSVM to learn a regres—
sion model from the whole training set.

2.6 Evaluation measures

where TP is the number of residues correctly labelled as positives
(true positives); TN is the number of residues correctly labelled as
negatives (true negatives); FP is the number of misclassified negative
cases (false positives); and FN is the number of misclassified positive
cases (false negatives).

For disordered residue predictions, ROC analysis was carried
out in the light of the output probability scores. For each value
z/E[0.0, 1.0], we considered as putatively disordered those and only
those residues with a score higher than or equal to v, and as puta—
tively ordered the remaining ones. Such binary classifications helped
calculate TP, FP, FN, TN, sensitivity and specificity. Finally, ROC
curves were generated from the pairs (1—specificity, sensitivity) cor-
responding to decreasing values of z/ and the area under the curve
(AUC) was calculated with the trapezoid integration method in the
pROC package (Robin et al., 2011) for R (R Core Team, 2012).

In the statistical comparisons of method performance, we always
test the null hypothesis that DISOPRED3 is not more accurate than
DISOPRED2 against the alternative hypothesis that DISOPRED3
outperforms DISOPRED2. For binary classifications, we carried out
105 resampling experiments: each time we randomly sampled 80%
of the proteins, we estimated the scores for the two predictors, and
we finally recorded the values of the paired differences. P—values for
the null hypotheses were estimated by comparing such differences
with zero. For probability—based predictions, we assessed the statis—
tical significance of the differences in AUC values with the DeLong
non—parametric test (DeLong et al., 1988) as implemented in the
pROC package.

3 Results and discussion

DISOPRED3 participated as a server at the CASP9 and CASP10 ex—
periments, and the official assessment reports acknowledged its
value by ranking it at the top or near the top across a number of tests
(Monastyrskyy et al., 2011, 2014). Although not exhaustive, the list
of predictors tested at CASP is nonetheless representative of the lat—
est developments in the field, which are also usually publicly avail-
able to the scientific community. Therefore, the results and
discussion below focus on the comparison of DISOPRED3 with its
predecessor using standard evaluation measures, and then on its use
for protein-binding region detection.

3.1 Improvements over DISOPRED2

The analysis of both the binary and the probability—based classifica—
tions against the CASP10 reference assignments is summarized in
Figure 1, Tables 1 and 2. The evaluation results based on CASP9
data are consistent with those presented here and are outlined in
Supplementary Tables S2 and S3. Overall, our self—assessment shows
that DISOPRED3 greatly reduces the number of false positives
with negligible loss of sensitivity. This leads to a statistically
significant increase in precision (P<1e—5), MCC (P<1e—5) and
AUC (P < 2.2e—16), which are known to correlate with the under—
prediction of the minority class in the context of imbalanced data
classifications. On the other hand, the observed difference in terms
of balanced accuracy defined as the average of sensitivity and specif—
icity, is unlikely to be significant (P = 0.06), because this measure is
generally affected by the over prediction of the minority class.

The usefulness of the additional modules for intrinsic disorder
prediction becomes clear when the focus shifts to increasingly longer
IDRs. It’s fair to say that the CASP target selection procedure is
mainly aimed at releasing protein sequences, the structures of which
are unknown but expected to be solved by the end of the 3—month

prediction stage or soon after that. This inevitably selects against
disordered residues—and long IDRs in particular—which can hinder
structure determination efforts. In fact, ~60% of the disordered
residues in the benchmark set occur in IDRs shorter than 20 amino
acids. With this caveat in mind, we looked at a few length ranges, by
masking both the reference and predicted state assignments for IDRs

shorter than the selected thresholds. Table 1 reports the values for
the recalculated evaluation measures after IDRs shorter than 20, 30
and 40 residues were discarded. As the number of negative cases
didn’t differ, the corresponding specificity values were unchanged.

We observe a clear improvement over DISOPRED2 across the
whole board. In particular, the higher levels of sensitivity for seg—
ments with at least 20 or 30 amino acids clearly confirm the added
value of the neural network and of the nearest neighbor classifier of
long IDRs. Certainly, a more balanced test set would allow for more
detailed investigations, but the occurrence of 307 and 197 dis—
ordered residues respectively in such subsets is enough for such a
conclusion. For regions of 40 or more residues, DISOPRED3 still
outperforms the previous release, but the rather limited number of
positive test cases—just 94 residues in two distinct stretches—makes
it hard to draw general and sound conclusions.

We finally compared the prediction accuracy of the two
DISOPRED versions on the subsets of terminal and internal IDRs.
Here, terminal amino acids are those within 10 positions of each pro—
tein sequence termini, while all the remaining ones are regarded as in—
ternal. The higher abundance of IDRs at protein’s N— and C—termini is
a well—known bias, and represents one of the helpful features exploited
by machine learning methods. Correct identification of IDRs far from
termini is therefore expected to be more challenging.

Generally, the outcome of this test—shown in Table 2—mirrors
the findings based on the whole dataset, with DISOPRED3 giving
more consistent results. For amino acids further than 10 positions
from the protein’s N— or C—terminus, we also observe that
DISOPRED3 makes a slight improvement in sensitivity over
DISOPRED2, which is likely correlated to the higher occurrence of
long IDRs at internal positions.

3.2 Effectiveness of disordered protein—binding region
predictions

Over the past few years, tentative steps have been taken towards
annotating the molecular activities of predicted IDRs, including the
identification of relatively short regions that fold upon interacting
transiently with other proteins. We initially set out to train an SVM—
based classifier for this task using a 15 amino acid long sliding win-
dow, which considers sequence profile data, the length and location
of the input IDR relative to the whole protein sequence, and the
amino acid composition of the window. The length and position of
IDRs, indeed, correlate with general protein functional categories
and so can be useful for the annotation of proteins with distant or
no homologues with known function at all (Lobley et al., 2007;
Minneci et al., 2013). In particular, regions closer to the chain’s ter—
mini are very likely to perform binding activities while those further
away could also act as flexible linkers.

Despite the availability of many protein disorder predictors
based on evolutionary information, there is still no unanimous con-
sensus in the field about the extent of usefulness offered by sequence
profile data. This prompted us to investigate the possibility of learn—
ing the classification of disordered protein—binding regions from se—
quence data alone, from PSSM values, and from the list of features
mentioned above. For this purpose, we tested and compared with
full cross—validation these SVM—based predictors against a set of 37
protein regions shown to be disordered in isolation and folded in
complex with other globular protein domains using biophysical
techniques—mostly NMR spectroscopy. Here, we measure predic—
tion accuracy conservatively: all disordered residues not annotated
as protein binding were considered as not being able to do so, even
under different physiological conditions—e.g. in the presence of

Naive predictions correspond to random labelling of the known disordered
residues as folding upon protein binding or not with equal probability.

other proteins. We certainly appreciate that these assumptions are
highly conservative and arguably somewhat unrealistic, given the
occurrence of IDRs in protein—protein interaction network hubs.
However, at this point in time this is the only viable strategy that we
can envisage to penalize and avoid over predictions, and indeed it
appears to be the approach used in the similar areas, such as the as—
sessment of methods for Gene Ontology terms or post—translational
modification predictions.

The summary evaluation results in Table 3 show that the use of
single sequence information provides less sensitivity but more speci—
ficity than the use of PSSM scoring. Overall, PSSM data would ap—
pear to provide slightly better predictions, as gathered from the
precision, F1 and MCC scores. Adding information about IDR
length, location and amino acid composition greatly boosts specifi—
city and MCC, at the expense of sensitivity. Given the correct resi—
due level assignments to the disordered regions, these methods strike
rather different balances between sensitivity and specificity, but
overall they appear to be useful, as they outperform na'ive
approaches that randomly label each disordered residue as protein
binding or not.

3.3 Comparison with other tools detecting disordered
protein—binding regions

The performance of the predictor based on profile data, IDR loca—
tion and length and window composition was also compared with
publicly available tools and with a naive approach that randomly
labels the target sequence amino acids as either disordered protein
binding or not with equal probability. The three other programs in
the benchmark are ANCHOR (Meszaros et al., 2009), MoRFpred
(Disfani et al., 2012) and MFSPSSMpred (Fang et al., 2013), which
are available for download or online use; PepBindPred (Khan et al.,
2013) was not tested, given the running times needed for molecular
dynamics simulations.

To reduce biases on the one hand and to keep a reasonable num—
ber of test cases on the other, we ended up limited to considering
only 9 of the 29 protein chains we originally collected, because the
remaining chains belong to the published training sets of ANCHOR,
MoRFpred or MFSPSSMPred. Because we could not ensure full
cross—validation of these tools, the accuracies reported below may
be overestimated. On the other hand, DISOPRED3 predictions were
generated using the appropriate fully cross—validated SVMs and the
disordered residue assignments predicted from sequence—see
Supplementary Table S4 for details about IDR prediction accuracy.
All reference annotations and predictions collected for this study are
available from our own website, so that readers can easily reproduce
our results or compare their own methods.

DISOPRED3 no DPB SVM is a baseline method that considers all dis-
ordered residues identiﬁed by DISOPRED3 as involved in protein binding.

Again, prediction accuracy was measured conservatively, by con—
sidering each residue as disordered protein binding if and only if
there is clear experimental evidence from biophysical methods.
Prediction accuracy was gauged using precision and recall analysis
as well as MCC scores, though the former approach might be more
appropriate to keep the focus on the task of IDR functional annota—
tion rather than on the problem of their identification. The assess—
ment would otherwise be inevitably affected by the vast majority of
ordered residues in the negative set and by the difficulty of identify-
ing disordered residues never interacting with other proteins.

Table 4 shows that, overall, DISOPRED3 performs well when
compared with all the other approaches, by providing the most spe—
cific and precise predictions of residues that undergo disorder—to—
order transitions upon protein binding. The benefits of the SVM for
protein-binding region annotation is demonstrated by the massive
reduction in the number of false positive assignments that would be
made by tagging all predicted disordered residues as protein binding
(method ‘DISOPRED3 no DPB SVM’). This supports the usefulness
of unbound domain linker regions to represent IDRs that do not
bind proteins. The other two machine—learning based methods,
MoRFpred and MFSPSSMpred, achieve nearly identical F1 scores to
DISOPRED3 due to their ability to recall slightly more disordered
protein-binding residues. Finally, ANCHOR attains the highest level
of sensitivity, though at the heavy expense of lower specificity.
However, due to the limited number of IDRs that fold upon protein
binding in this test set, it is difficult to make statistically sound con—
clusions about differences in method performance. Certainly, we
hope that larger corpuses of confirmed protein annotations, along
with side—by—side blind testing experiments will help address this
point in the future

We further investigated whether the false positive assignments of
each program were sufficiently close to the validated regions, that
users with prior knowledge about the test proteins might still gain
some benefit from these predictions after manual inspection. To this
end, we focused on those amino acids predicted as disordered pro—
tein binding but observed in complex with no other protein domain.
For every such residue, we initially calculated the minimum se—
quence separation from the closest amino acid annotated as a posi—
tive instance. We then computed the proportion of false positive
predictions within 5, 10, 20 and 35 positions of the validated sites.
This largest distance was determined as half the length of the short—
est protein sequence in the test set.

The numerical results of this study are reported in
Supplementary Table S5 and show that ~30% of the false positive
predictions are no more than 35 positions away from the binding
sites so far characterized. Because the structural, dynamic and

functional aspects of these proteins have not been sufficiently char—
acterized, it is difficult to tell whether these predictions are incorrect
or represent plausible hypotheses awaiting better experimental
verification.

Overall, the above results show substantial room for improve—
ment in different areas. Certainly, more sensitive IDR predictions
would allow for the detection of additional protein binding dis-
ordered sites. As far as DISOPRED3 is concerned, the current results
show that most false negative assignments correspond to residues
predicted as ordered in the first place. In the future, we are keen to
investigate more effective integrative approaches of the prediction
modules for IDR detection and protein—binding site annotation.
Further improvements will definitely stem from the availability of
large sets of residue—level annotations of IDRs and of their biological
roles that can be automatically parsed. Many DisProt entries contain
IDRs undoubtedly involved in protein—protein interactions, but
often the resolution of the available experimental data is not suffi—
cient to locate the protein—binding sites accurately. In other cases,
manual annotation efforts apparently do not follow standard guide—
lines—an issue exacerbated by the lack in the database schema of at—
tributes for ligand binding sites. Consequently, long protein-binding
IDRs are sometimes reported, but the specific binding residues docu—
mented in the cited primary literature are not—compare the entry
DP00608 and the referenced article (Wang et al., 2010), for

instance.

4 Conclusion

We have documented the DISOPRED3 program for protein disorder
prediction and for protein—binding site annotation within disordered
regions. The tool first identifies disordered residues through a con—
sensus of the output generated by DISOPRED2 and two additional
machine—learning based modules trained on large IDRs, and then an—
notates them as protein binding through an additional SVM classi—
fier. The intrinsic disorder predictor attains fairly high levels of
prediction accuracy across different test conditions, and can be re—
garded as state of the art—as independently reported by the CASP9
and CASP10 assessment teams—thus confirming the usefulness of
integrating multiple complementary approaches. Compared with its
predecessor, DISOPRED3 shows improved sensitivity for IDRs with
twenty or more amino acids, as well as increased overall specificity.
Such predictions form a useful basis for the identification of protein-
binding regions mediating key transient interactions through a novel
SVM, which compares well with existing tools for the same task.

On these grounds, DISOPRED3 is expected to represent a useful
addition to the toolbox for the functional annotation of proteins
and proteomes. Notwithstanding, further advances are needed to en—
hance the sensitivity of IDR detection and of the protein-binding
sites therein. Of course, the accumulation of additional experimental
information and its availability in a structured, easy—to—parse man—
ner will be beneficial—as already witnessed in other areas of compu—
tational biology. However, new ideas will be crucial to make major
progress, especially in the attempt to link the binary classifications
of ordered and disordered residues to biological functions at differ—
ent scales of complexity. In particular, initial system—level investiga—
tions of the role of protein disorder in cellular development and
differentiation have already begun thanks to the increasing availabil—
ity of genome—wide heterogeneous datasets. In this context, the de—
sign and implementation of reliable and more scalable tools will be
of special relevance.

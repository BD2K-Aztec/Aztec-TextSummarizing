ABSTRACT

Summary: GRN2SBML automatically encodes gene regulatory net-
works derived from several inference tools in systems biology markup
language. Providing a graphical user interface, the networks can be
annotated via the simple object access protocol (SOAP)—based appli-
cation programming interface of BioMart Central Portal and minimum
information required in the annotation of models registry. Additionally,
we provide an R-package, which processes the output of supported
inference algorithms and automatically passes all required parameters
to GRN2SBML. Therefore, GRN2SBML closes a gap in the processing
pipeline between the inference of gene regulatory networks and their
subsequent analysis, visualization and storage.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding the complex interaction processes within biolo-
gical networks is one of the driving forces in the research of
systems biology. One of the important processes is the regulation
of gene expression, which provides information about the func-
tion and behavior of the biological system under investigation.
To this end, mathematical models are frequently used to eluci-
date the complex nature of these processes. To make these
models accessible to other researchers, to ensure interoperability
and to permit their further development and reuse, mathematical
models should be represented in a standardized format. By now,
the defacto standard for the storage, exchange and use of quan-
titative models is the XML-based systems biology markup
language (SBML, Hucka et al., 2003).

Typically, SBML is used to represent complex models at the
biochemical reaction level, which describe the underlying biolo-
gical processes in a mechanistic in—depth manner. However, in
the field of dynamic gene regulatory network (GRN) inference the
applied approaches often use phenomenological modeling

concepts instead, disregarding the detailed mechanisms. This ac-
counts for missing knowledge about the underlying molecular
processes and the limited amount of data available (see Hecker
et al., 2009a for a review on different approaches).

Therefore, the adequate representation of such models in
SBML, even if they are based on quantitative frameworks such
as differential equations, becomes a difficult task because the
SBML core package contains several parts that are not directly
applicable to the qualitative character of GRNs and lacks neces-
sary attributes for their interpretation (Chaouiya et al., 2013).

A subsequent problem to the representation of GRNs in
SBML is the appropriate annotation of such models. To make
them completely understandable and reusable for others, all
models should be annotated following the minimum information
required in the annotation of models (MIRIAM, Le Novere et al.,
2005) standard. This includes annotation of the model itself as
well as annotation of its components using ontologies such as the
gene ontology (GO; Ashburner et al., 2000), the systems biology
ontology (SBO; Courtot et al., 2013) and standardized uniform
resource identifiers as provided by the MIRIAM Registry (Juty
et al., 2012).

In the ﬁeld of automatic GRN inference, model annotation
and representation in SBML is still a time-consuming manual
task that requires multiple tools. In fact, there is a gap between
the automated inference of networks and their subsequent ana-
lysis with tools such as Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) or the
SBMLsimulator (Keller et al., 2013) (Fig. l).

2 IMPLEMENTATION

We present GRN2SBML, a JavaTM program that encodes
GRNs in SBML using the Java library JSBML (Dr'ager et al.,
2011). At the moment, GRN2SBML includes parsers for three
successfully applied network inference algorithms, NetGenerator
Weber et al., 2013), TILAR (Hecker et al., 2009b) and
ExTILAR (Vlaic et al., 2012). GRN2SBML can be used in
three different ways to encode GRNs in SBML. The tool can
either be employed from the terminal, using the graphical user
interface, or directly out of R passing the algorithm’s speciﬁc
output of the networks. Basic annotation with SBO- and GO-
terms is automatically performed by GRN2SBML according to
the algorithm-specific interpretation of the network model.
Additional annotation of the genes can be added either by the

Fig. 1. In a typical network inference approach, gene expression that was pre-processed and analyzed (i.e. by using R) is used for automated network
inference to derive new testable biological hypothesis. GRN2SBML offers the possibility to automatically encode the inferred models in SBML and,
therefore, makes them accessible for diverse processing, visualization and simulation tools. The automated annotation with SBO-terms and GO-terms
allows easy interpretation of the models. Additional annotation of the enclosed species can be added by accessing the BioMart Central Portal

import of text ﬁles or by using the simple object access protocol
(SOAP)-based application programming interface of BioMart
Central Portal (Guberman et al., 2011) and MIRIAM
Registry. Relations between the genes in a network can also be
annotated using PubMed identiﬁers. This is particularly import-
ant for networks that were inferred using prior knowledge be-
cause the annotation refers to the knowledge’s original source.

Although the format to process networks is often similar
across different algorithms, we found that the interpretation of
the inferred networks often differs. Regarding the currently sup-
ported algorithms, species are used to denote for genes, while
rules or events are used to represent the mathematical frame-
work. In this way, we can use reactions for the visualization
allowing to display structural features used, i.e. by TILAR-
type of algorithms (see Supplementary Material for details).
However, proper annotation that allows a correct interpretation
of the network model still depends on algorithm-speciﬁc parsers.
Therefore, GRN2SBML has a modular architecture that sup-
ports the implementation of parsers for both new and currently
unsupported algorithms without the need to change core func-
tions of the program.

3 CONCLUSION

A key achievement of this project is the development of
GRN2SBML, a tool that provides a framework for the auto-
mated encoding of GRN-models in SBML in compliance with
the speciﬁcations of the standard. This is a mandatory step
toward interoperability, exchangeability and proper storing of
the inferred networks. GRN2SBML automatically annotates
the networks corresponding to the interpretation of the
model and allows easy and up-to-date annotation of its
components via diverse web resources. We used the SBML
layout extension (Gauges et al., 2006) to provide visualization
of different levels of abstraction of the models. This is
especially helpful when working with large and complex
networks. Therefore, GRN2SBML closes the gap in the
processing pipeline between network inference and a wide
range of subsequent network processing and visualization
tools.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Effective access to the vast biomedical knowledge present
in the scientific literature is challenging. Semantic relations are increas-
ingly used in knowledge management applications supporting bio-
medical research to help address this challenge. We describe
SemMedDB, a repository of semantic predications (subject—predi-
cate—object triples) extracted from the entire set of PubMed citations.
We propose the repository as a knowledge resource that can assist in
hypothesis generation and literature-based discovery in biomedicine
as well as in clinical decision-making support.

Availability and implementation: The SemMedDB repository is
available as a MySQL database for non-commercial use at http://skr3.
nlm.nih.gov/SemMedDB. An UMLS Metathesaurus license is required.

1 INTRODUCTION

Scientiﬁc discoveries depend on synthesis of knowledge from the
literature and generation of novel hypotheses for testing. In bio-
medicine, the overwhelming size of literature makes it difﬁcult
for researchers to identify promising new avenues, which may
involve insights from seemingly unrelated subﬁelds of the
domain. Large-scale information extraction in the form of
semantic relations is increasingly proposed for advanced know-
ledge management and discovery systems (Bjorne et al., 2010,
2012; Cohen et al., 2010; Hristovski et al., 2006).

In this note, we describe SemMedDB, a repository of semantic
predications extracted from the titles and abstracts of all
PubMed citations by SemRep (Rindﬂesch and Fiszman, 2003),
a rule-based semantic interpreter. Elements of semantic predica-
tions are drawn from the Uniﬁed Medical Language System
(UMLS) knowledge sources (Bodenreider, 2004); the subject
and object pair corresponds to Metathesaurus concepts, and
the predicate to a relation type in an extended version of the
semantic network. For example, SemRep extracts the predica-
tion Infection-CA USES-Guillain—Barre Syndrome from the sen-
tence Infections can trigger GBS. By normalizing the free text
describing a relation to UMLS domain knowledge, SemRep pro-
vides the ability to combine and link knowledge from various
sources as well as aggregate knowledge at PubMed

scale. SemRep extracts 3O predicate types, largely relating
to clinical medicine (e.g. TREATS, DIAGNOSES,
ADMINISTERED_TO, PROCESS_OF), substance interactions
(e.g. INTERACTS_WITH, INHIBITS, STIMULATES), genetic
etiology of disease (e.g. ASSOCIATED_WITH, CAUSES,
PREDISPOSES) and pharmacogenomics (e.g. AF F ECTS,
AUGMENTS, DISRUPTS). For a full list and descriptions
of these predicate types, we refer the reader to Kilicoglu et al.
(2011). Several evaluations have focused on different domains
and linguistic structures. Results are summarized in Table 1.
Numbers in the ﬁrst column indicate the number of predica-
tions evaluated.

The SemMedDB repository consists of information regarding
semantic predications extracted from PubMed citations by pre-
processing and stored for efﬁcient access. The repository under-
pins Semantic MEDLINE (http://skr3.nlm.nih.gov/SemMed), a
Web application that incorporates PubMed-based information
retrieval with semantic predications, automatic summarization
and Visualization (Kilicoglu et al., 2008; Rindﬂesch et al.,
2011). In this note, we propose the repository as a stand-alone,
large-scale knowledge resource that can be exploited independ-
ently of Semantic MEDLINE. With the ability to access the full
extent of the repository, the users can circumvent the ‘search—
summarize—Visualize’ model of Semantic MEDLINE and apply
advanced data mining algorithms directly to support biomedical
research as well as clinical practice, for hypothesis generation and
literature-based discovery.

2 OVERVIEW OF SemMedDB

The SemMedDB repository is implemented primarily as a
MySQL relational database that consists of tables holding

information regarding PubMed citations, relevant UMLS know-
ledge and the semantic predications. A brief description of the
content of each table and the approximate number of records in
it are provided in Table 2. The UMLS-related tables
(CONCEPT*) contain information from a modiﬁed version of
the UMLS 2006AA release, adapted for SemRep. The descrip-
tions of data ﬁelds in each table are explained in detail in the
online documentation. The entity-relationship diagram of the
database is also provided.

The preprocessing of PubMed for SemMedDB takes about
2 months. Citations are ﬁrst retrieved from PubMed using the
NCBI E-utilities API and then processed by SemRep in a dis-
tributed computing environment. The latest version of the re-
pository has ~57.6M predications extracted from 21 M
citations (dated June 30, 2012 or earlier). We process newly
added citations at regular intervals and update the repository
with the extracted predications.

3 USE CASES

SemMedDB is being used to support a range of biomedical
applications, especially for literature-based discovery and hy-
pothesis generation. Miller et al. (2012) proposed a mechanistic
link between cortisol, testosterone and age-related sleep-quality
decline, while Wilkowski et al. (2011) applied graph-theoretical
notions to elucidate the relation between sleep and depression.
More recently, Goodwin et al. (2012) replicated these results by
exploiting information foraging theory. Cohen et al. (2012)
used analogical reasoning in a high-dimensional vector space
to suggest drug therapies. Similarly, Hristovski et al. (2012) pro-
posed predication space for drug target discovery and drug
repurposing, whereas Hristovski et al. (2010) combined predica-
tions with DNA microarray data to generate novel hypotheses
on Parkinson disease. We are currently combining predications
with microarray data to automatically generate gene regulatory
networks.

SemMedDB has formed the basis of several clinical applica-
tions. J onnalagadda et al. (2012) generate therapy-oriented sum-
maries to support clinical decision making, while Liu et al. (2012)
elucidate the association between medical concepts co-occurring
in clinical reports. The repository also underpinned a recent
study to identify interactions between drugs mentioned in clinical
reports.

4 CONCLUSION

We described the SemMedDB repository, which makes the
semantic content of all PubMed citations as extracted by
SemRep available to the research community. The utility of
the repository for hypothesis generation, literature-based discov-
ery and clinical decision making has so far been demonstrated
from within the Semantic MEDLINE paradigm and independ-
ently. Given its scale and size, this repository can further serve as
the basis of advanced data-mining techniques and assist in un-
covering novel relationships in biomedicine.

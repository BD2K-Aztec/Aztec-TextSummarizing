ABSTRACT

Motivation: Template-based modelling can approximate the
unknown structure of a target protein using an homologous template
structure. The core of the resulting prediction then comprises the
structural regions conserved between template and target. Target
prediction could be improved by rigidly repositioning such single
template, structurally conserved fragment regions. The purpose of
this article is to quantify the extent to which such improvements
are possible and to relate this extent to properties of the target, the
template and their alignment.

Results: The improvement in accuracy achievable when rigid
fragments from a single template are optimally positioned was
calculated using structure pairs from the HOMSTRAD database, as
well as CASP7 and CASP8 target/best template pairs. Over the
union of the structurally conserved regions, improvements of 0.7
in root mean squared deviation (RMSD) and 6% in GDT_HA were
commonly observed. A generalized linear model revealed that the
extent to which a template can be improved can be predicted using
four variables. Templates with the greatest scope for improvement
tend to have relatively more fragments, shorter fragments, higher
percentage of helical secondary structure and lower sequence
identity. Optimal positioning of the template fragments offers the
potential for improving loop modelling. These results demonstrate
that substantial improvement could be made on many templates if
the conserved fragments were to be optimally positioned. They also
provide a basis for identifying templates for which modification of
fragment positions may yield such improvements.

1 INTRODUCTION

Knowledge of the structure of a protein is crucial to an understanding
of its function. Experimental determination of protein structure is far
from keeping pace with the discovery of the amino acid sequences
of proteins (Levitt, 2007). Thus to further our understanding of
the molecular function of organisms using the growing volume of
genomic information, it is necessary to be able to accurately predict
protein structure from the amino acid sequence.

Template—based modelling (TBM), the most accurate method
of predicting protein structure, exploits the structural similarities

shared between two related proteins (Cozzetto et al., 2009).
As the amino acid sequences of related proteins diverge through
evolution, each accumulates insertions, deletions and mutations.
These modiﬁcations are manifested in shifts and rotations of
structural elements, local deformations and changes in side chains
(Lesk and Chothia, 1986), while the fold of the protein tends to
be maintained. It is this structural similarity of related proteins that
is exploited by TBM. Beginning with its amino acid sequence, the
unknown, or target structure is predicted by approximating it with the
structural features putatively conserved between itself and a known,
homologous template structure.

In general, TBM proceeds by ﬁrst identifying the template
structures that best approximate the target, and subsequently
attempting to remove any differences that have accumulated
between the target and templates. Of the two approaches currently
adopted (Bujnicki, 2006), one predicts the target by optimizing
restraints on inter—atomic distances and torsion angles, restraints
derived in part from the templates (Sali and Blundell, 1993,
e. g. Modeller). In the alternative approach, TBM involves the
direct transfer of backbone and/or side chain coordinates from
the templates to the target structure wherever the target—template
sequences are aligned (Bates and Stemberg, 1999; Greer, 1990;
Krieger et al., 2009)—it is this last approach with which we are
concerned here. The component steps of this approach have been
modiﬁed little since the work of Browne et al. (1969). These are:
(i) aligning a template and target sequence; (ii) using the structure
from sequence regions conserved between the template and target
to predict the target structure; (iii) prediction of non—conserved
regions; (iV) side chain addition; and (V) reﬁnement/modiﬁcation
of the resulting predictions.

Current modelling methods are largely successful in ﬁnding the
initial approximation, that is, in selecting the best template and
aligning this with the target. In the two most recent biennial protein
structure prediction experiments [CASP7 (Moult et al., 2007) and
CASP8 (Cozzetto et al., 2009)], for example, optimal or near—
optimal template selection and alignment was achieved for most
proteins with readily identiﬁable templates (Kopp et al., 2007;
Kryshtafovych et al., 2009). In spite of this success, the majority
of ﬁnal predictions from TBM methods remain inferior to the direct
transfer of coordinates from the best template to the target based on
an optimal template—target alignment (Kopp et al., 2007).

The accuracy with which a template approximates a target is
directly related to their sequence identity (SI). Templates with
residues 30% identical to the target generally approximate the core
to around 1.5—2A root mean squared deviation (RMSD), and this
may improve to <1 A RMSD when sequence identities rise >50%
(Cozzetto and Tramontano, 2005). Even for templates with high SI to

the target, differences in packing and contacts may result in the main—
chain conformation of the template and target differing by ‘up to
several angstroms’ (Tress et al., 2005). It is therefore important that
TBM be able to predict structures that improve upon the template,
and for this it is necessary to modify and reﬁne the backbone (Read
and Chavali, 2007; Tramontano and Morea, 2003). Unfortunately,
reliable methods of template reﬁnement have so far been elusive.

To completely predict the structure of the target often requires
the modelling of regions with no corresponding residues in the
template—a consequence of the insertions and deletions that have
occurred as proteins evolve. The resulting gaps within the predicted
structure must be ﬁlled using loop prediction methods (Deane and
Blundell, 2001; Rohl et al., 2004). The accuracy of loop prediction
is reduced by the distortions present in the unmodiﬁed template
relative to the target, particularly in the residues adjacent to the gaps
in the target—template alignment, known as anchor regions (Deane
and Blundell, 2001; Fiser et al., 2000; Lessel and Schomburg, 1999).
A further beneﬁt of improving upon the template structure may thus
be improved accuracy of anchor regions, which could then yield
more accurate prediction of loops.

Modifying a template to better approximate the target is
equivalent to adjusting for the structural differences that have
accumulated between two homologues. Lesk and Chothia (1986)
previously examined the sources of structural differences within the
backbone of conserved regions, and identiﬁed all differences as a
combination of rigid shifts and rotations of the conserved region,
and local deformation of the backbone. Using proteins from the
eight families known at that time, the way structural differences
were manifest between homologues was related to both SI and
type of secondary structure. Although a small number of studies
such as Baldwin et al. (1993) have observed shifts and rotations
of structural elements within homologues, and some structure
alignment algorithms implement ‘ﬂexible’ structures (Verbitsky
et al., 1999), no other study quantiﬁes the sources of structural
variation in the conserved regions of homologues since the analysis
of 32 homologues by Lesk and Chothia (1986). Given that
more than 50000 proteins have been experimentally determined
in the intervening period, it now seems prudent to revisit this
topic.

How much of the structural difference observed between two
homologues results from the shifts and rotations of the structural
elements, and how much from changes in local conformation? This
question is critical for determining the nature of the differences that
exist between two homologues. At one extreme, if a large proportion
of the differences observed derives from shifts and rotations, then
such modiﬁcations should be considered prior to exploring local
changes. At the other extreme, if all of the differences observed are
from changes in local conformation, then a TBM algorithm should
focus solely on modifying the local conformation.

Here, we analyse the extent to which differences between the
homologous proteins are a consequence of shifts and rotations of the
conserved regions. We demonstrate the potential value of optimizing
the positioning of template regions conserved within the target,
showing that the accuracy with which the conserved fragments
within a template structure can approximate the target is predicted
by the number and length of structurally conserved regions within
the alignment, the or—helical proportion of the target, and the SI.
We also show that half of the anchor regions have RMSD to the
native conformation decreased by at least 0.45 A when fragments

are shifted optimally, thus providing scope for more accurate loop
modelling.

The contributions of the current article are 2—fold. First, the
article quantiﬁes the ultimate extent of improvement possible
through rotation and translation of structurally conserved regions
of a template, so deﬁning the distance to the ﬁnish line for such
model reﬁnement. Second, the article ﬁnds a relationship between
the extent of improvement possible and the properties of both
the template and the target, so providing initial guidelines for
establishing the distance to the ﬁnish line for a given template. It
remains as future work to provide explicit rules for repositioning
fragments, relating the translation and rotation required to local and
global properties of the template and target.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

Two datasets presented in the main results were used as a source of
target—template pairs, a comprehensive, non—redundant dataset based upon
structures within the HOMSTRAD database (Mizuguchi et 01., 1998) and a
benchmark dataset based upon data from each of the seventh and eighth
sessions of CASP (Cozzetto et al., 2009; Moult et al., 2007). (Datasets
are provided in the Supplementary Material.) Possible bias arising from
the different HOMSTRAD family sizes was avoided by selecting only the
pair of proteins from each family with the highest resolution. Furthermore,
the HOMSTRAD non—redundant dataset comprised protein pairs for which
there was at least one gap in the sequence alignment. HOMSTRAD class
was recorded to enable assessment of between—class differences. Families
within HOMSTRAD classes represented by fewer than 25 protein pairs in
this dataset were excluded, with the ﬁnal dataset comprising all—oz, all—ﬂ, aﬁ,
oz+ﬁ and multidomain classes. A ‘high resolution’ version of this dataset
was used for model building, comprising a subset of 232 protein pairs with
resolution 2 A or better.

The CASP dataset comprised all protein domains from each of CASP7
and CASP8 that were deﬁned on the CASP web site as containing a
single continuous amino acid sequence. The CASP7 data included all such
domains from the TBM targets and their best templates as described by Kopp
et al. (2007). The CASP8 data included all domains in the TBM and high
accuracy TBM categories of CASP (www.predictioncenter.org/casp8). The
best template for each CASP8 target was found by identifying the parent
structures used by each predictor group, generating a structure alignment
between each template and the target using TM—align (Zhang and Skolnick,
2005), and selecting the template with the highest GDT_TS score. The
resulting dataset contained 131 models from CASP7 and CASP8 combined
(Supplementary Material). A third dataset presented in the Supplementary
Material was designed to evaluate how applicable these results were to
target—template pairs in which homology was more distant. Three hundred
randomly selected pairs of proteins that share homology on the superfamily
level (but not on the family level) as classiﬁed by SCOP (Murzin et al., 1995)
were processed in the same manner as described below for the HOMSTRAD
dataset.

2.2 Construction of the fragment-optimized template

Within each protein pair, one protein was arbitrarily selected as ‘target’, and
the remaining protein as ‘template’. The method for constructing the datasets
analysed in this article is illustrated in Figure 1, and consists of two major
steps, target—template alignment and calculation of the ‘fragment—optimized
template’. These two steps are described below.

2.2.] Target—template alignment To assess how well the template
approximates the target (Fig. 1a) using GDT and RMSD, the best target—
template alignment must ﬁrst be known. The sequence alignment between the

Fig. 1. Optimally modifying the position of template fragments. The method for constructing the dataset: (a) the structures within each pair are arbitrarily
assigned to target (blue/dark) and template (yellow/light); (b) target and template are structurally aligned using TM—align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005), and
regions conserved between target and template in the structural alignment then identiﬁed, as indicated by the boxed residues; (c) regions not conserved between
the target and template are removed from the template, leaving the set of structurally conserved template fragments; (d) a fragment—optimized template is
created by identifying corresponding regions between template and target within the structural alignment, and individually superposing these conserved
template fragments onto the corresponding regions of the target; (e) the fragment—optimized template remains as the union of conserved regions, with each

conserved region positioned such that they are superposed onto the target.

template and target based upon structural criteria (i.e. structural alignment)
was calculated using TM—align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005). Amino acids
within the backbone were deﬁned as ‘structurally conserved’ between target
and template when they were aligned within the structural alignment.
Conserved fragments were deﬁned as regions containing four or more
contiguous aligned amino acids, indicated in Figure 1b by a ‘box’ and
in Figure lc as fragments. This deﬁnition of structural conservation is a
modiﬁcation of that commonly used in the literature, in which the distance
between two structurally conserved residues must also fall below a cut—off
(Deane et al., 2001; Hilbert et al., 1993). This modiﬁed deﬁnition better
mimics the real—world task of TBM, where the best sequence alignment may
be obtained, but the distance between the C“ atoms remains unknown.

Generating the target—template alignment from structure alignment
methods such as TM—align corresponds to a ‘gold standard’, by which
alignments made in the absence of knowledge of the target structure may be
judged. The aim of this article is to determine the full extent of improvement
that is available when adjusting a template to match a target, and so it is
consistent with this aim to carry out the alignment with TM—align

To evaluate how the results presented here are affected by a diminished
alignment quality more consistent with the task of real—world TBM,
the results were recalculated using the sequence—based alignment method
CLUSTAL (Larkin et al., 2007). The parameters of the generalized linear
model (GLM) presented below were also calculated for this dataset, and are
presented in the Supplementary Material.

2.2.2 Calculating the fragment-optimized template When the target and
template are globally superposed, the positioning of individual conserved
template fragments is not necessarily optimal. To calculate the optimal
fragment positions, we performed local least—squares superpositions of the
C“ atoms from the conserved template fragment onto the corresponding

target fragment using Theseus (Theobald and Wuttke, 2006), that is, we
optimally positioned each individual conserved fragment to minimize the
fragment RMSD (Fig. 1d). The structure with all conserved fragments
individually superposed onto the target is shown in Figure 1e, and we refer
to this as the fragment—optimized template.

Target—template similarity was assessed using RMSD of all backbone
atoms within the union of structurally conserved regions, as well as the ‘total
score’ and ‘high accuracy’ versions of the global distance test [GDT_TS
and GDT_HA (Zemla et al., 1999)]. The amount by which the fragment—
optimized template improves upon the unmodiﬁed template was quantiﬁed
by the change in each of RMSD, GDT_HA and GDT_TS, summarized
schematically in Figure 2. The change in RMSD, ARMSDa, was calculated
as the RMSD of the unmodiﬁed template to target (RMSDun) minus the
RMSD of the fragment—optimized template to target (RMSDOPt), with both
of these quantities calculated for all residues in the conserved fragments (i.e.
ARMSDazRMSDun—RMSDOpt). The GDT of the unmodiﬁed template
was subtracted from the GDT of the fragment—optimized template, so that
AGDTa = GDTOpt — GDTun.

2.3 Optimal fragment positioning and loop modelling

Gaps in the structure alignment where the target has no corresponding
template residues are normally predicted using techniques of loop modelling.
Fiser et al. (2000) showed that the accuracy with which the conformation
of a loop may be predicted is strongly related to the RMSD between the
model and target measured over the three residues either side of that loop
(the ‘anchor’ residues). To measure the expected effect of ﬁnding the optimal
position of individual template fragments on the accuracy of loop modelling,
the backbone atom RMSD for the three anchor residues either side of each
loop was calculated between both the target and unmodiﬁed template, and

Fig. 2. Three types of template were compared with the target structure:

ARMSDa was calculated as RMSDun—RMSDOPt to compare how much

the target and fragment—optimized template. The expected change in loop
accuracy for each set of anchor residues, ARMSD (or anchor ARMSD) was
calculated as ARMSDzRMSDun—RMSDOpt, where RMSDun represents
the anchor RMSD of the unmodiﬁed template to target, and RMSDOpt
represents anchor RMSD of the fragment—optimized template to target.

2.4 Improvements in structural similarity as a function
of other variables

The distribution of improvement in ﬁt of the template to target resulting
from fragment optimization (ARMSDa, see Fig. 2) shown in Figure 3 is
constrained by zero on the left, and is strongly right skewed. Conditional
on the predictor variables used here, ARMSD,1 values resemble the gamma
distribution (Supplementary Fig. S 1). GLMs (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989))
are useful tools for linear modelling where the distribution of the response
variable, conditional upon values of the explanatory variables, assumes a
distribution that differs from the normal distribution. A GLM with a log link
was used to model the ARMSD,1 of structure pairs within the HOMSTRAD
high—resolution dataset. The predictor variables used were the number of
fragments in the alignment, mean fragment length (MFL), the proportion of
a—helix in the template as deﬁned by deﬁne secondary structure of proteins
(DSSP) (Kabsch and Sander, 1983), and SI. Additional variables that were
also considered but that did not contribute signiﬁcantly to the ﬁnal model
included structure class (as deﬁned by HOMSTRAD), target length, template
proportion of ﬁ—strand, target—template differences in secondary structure
composition, proportion of target covered by the template and functions
of the difference in side chain volume. Although these variables may in
isolation be related to ARMSD, they did not explain a signiﬁcant amount of
the remaining variation in ARMSD when considered jointly with the four
selected variables.

The full model with all variables listed above was simpliﬁed by iteratively
removing the least signiﬁcant term with P—value >0.05, resulting in a ﬁnal
model with all terms explaining a signiﬁcant amount of the variation in
ARMSD. SI is expressed as a percentage in the text, but is expressed as a
value between 0 and 1 for the purposes of modelling. The accuracy of the

ﬁnal model was evaluated by predicting the ARMSD for all 3974 template—
target pairs in CASP8 (Supplementary Material), and the HOMSTRAD pairs
for which the resolution of one or more structures was greater than 2 A.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The structural differences between each homologous target—
template pair were analysed by comparing how well each of
two templates, the unmodiﬁed and ‘fragment—optimized’ template,
approximated the target. The fragment—optimized template is the
unmodiﬁed template with structurally conserved regions superposed
onto the corresponding target region (see Section 2 and Fig. 1 for
a full description). Structure comparisons were made using RMSD
and GDT scores, as detailed in Section 2.

RMSD captures how similar two structures are in their conserved
regions, hence is not ‘order dependent’, that is, RMSD remains
unaffected by which structure within a protein pair is selected
as the ‘target’. In contrast, GDT captures how well the template
approximates the whole of the target—GDT is an order—dependent
measure designed for protein structure prediction. GDT is thus
affected by both changes in the conserved regions, and insertions
in the target relative to the template.

3.1 Differences between homologues and
improvements in the template

The shifts and rotations of the structural regions conserved between
two homologous proteins account for a substantial amount of
their structural difference. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the
difference in RMSD, ARMSDa (Fig. 2), for the HOMSTRAD non—
redundant dataset. For 42.7% of pairs, the RMSD between template
and target is at least 0.5 A greater than the RMSD between the
fragment—optimized template and the target. In over 12% of pairs
this difference is greater than 1A.

Using the CASP—favoured measure of GDT conﬁrms that the
fragment—optimized template and target are substantially more

similar than the unmodiﬁed template and target. Half of the
improvements in the fragment—optimized templates were greater
than 5% GDT_TS (Fig. 4a) and 7.7% GDT_HA (Fig. 4b), and one—
quarter were greater than 9.7% GDT_TS and 12.6% GDT_HA.
Although the bulk of structures were improved as measured by
both GDT scores, least squares positioning of template fragments
to minimize template RMSD has resulted in a few examples where
the fragment—optimized template has a GDT score lower than that
of the unmodiﬁed template. This apparently anomalous result arises
because the kind of differences between structures that are captured
by GDT are different from those captured by RMSD, and it is only
RMSD that is minimized by least—squares superposition. In cases
where the original template fragment was already well positioned
relative to the target fragment, very small shifts in the position of
some atoms may result in their passing into a more distal distance
category (e.g. a single atom moving from 1.99A to 2.01 A from
the corresponding target atom would reduce the GDT score). These
reductions are best considered ‘noise’.

Protein pairs with large values of ARMSD and AGDT are visible
in Figures 3 and 4. These large changes in RMSD upon repositioning
of the template fragments arise due to a large number of helices
that pack differently in the target and the template. An example
of the spatial disparities of multiple helices conserved between the
target and template is illustrated in Supplementary Figure S2. The
model presented below incorporates the effect of helix packing by
including the helical fraction of the template (HFT), and the number
of conserved fragments.

3.2 Comparison with CASP predictions

The CASP dataset provides an opportunity to measure the
contribution of relative shifts and rotations between the template
and target to inaccuracies in current TBM predictions. TBM
predictions from CASP7 and CASP8 with best GDT_HA scores
and best GDT_TS scores were selected for comparison with
both the best template (as listed here and in Kopp et al.,
2007) and the fragment—optimized best template. GDT scores for
each model relative to the target were calculated based upon
the structural alignment from TM—align, and pairwise differences
between each of best template, fragment—optimized best template
and best CASP model were assessed for signiﬁcance using paired
t—tests. The best CASP models have signiﬁcantly higher GDT_HA
(Fig. 5b) and GDT_TS scores than those of the best template
(AGDT_HAc =5.9, t130 = 10.2, p < 1e— 13; AGDT_TSC =6.4,
t130=10.9, P<1e—12). The histogram of pairwise differences
AGDT_HAb between the fragment—optimized template and best
CASP model (Fig. 5b) shows the data generally to the right of the
origin, suggesting the fragment—optimized template has a higher
GDT_HA and GDT_TS score, although this is not signiﬁcantly
different from zero (AGDT_HAb = 1.39, I130: 1.9, P=0.055;
AGDT_TSb=0.33, t130=0.52, P=0.60). Note that AGDTb is
calculated over the union of the structurally conserved regions,
whereas AGDTC is calculated over the entire protein.

The TBM section of CASP is an assessment of current abilities to
approximate a target with one or more homologues, and then account
for the structural changes introduced during the course of evolution.
Differences that derive from modiﬁcations to the positioning of the
conserved regions are not yet commonly addressed; accounting for
these differences alone would produce gains in model accuracy that
are better than those achieved by the best template—based models in
CASP.

3.3 Optimal fragment positioning and loop modelling

Loop prediction improves with the accuracy of the anchor residues in
the model (Lessel and Schomburg, 1999); we quantify the change in
anchor residue accuracy here using the HOMSTRAD non—redundant
dataset. The median change in anchor RMSD from unmodiﬁed
template to target to fragment—optimized template to target is an
improvement of 0.45 A, with 28% of all anchors improved by >1 A
RMSD, as shown in Figure 6. The ARMSD of anchor regions
shown in Figure 6 is generally greater than the ARMSD of the
entire structure, as it is anchor regions which change position most
following fragment superposition. An extreme example of the large
effect that changes in fragment position can have on anchor RMSD
is illustrated in Supplementary Figure S3, where repositioning of an
SCR in the HOMSTRAD AMP—binding domain improves anchor
RMSD by 9.5 A. Relative to the unmodiﬁed template, some anchors

(these have ARMSD below zero in Fig. 6). These reductions
in accuracy are almost never greater than 2A, and mostly less
than 0.5 A.

Fiser et al. (2000) showed that RMSD between predicted and
target loops is positively correlated with RMSD between target and
template anchor regions. Speciﬁcally, for short loops, reductions in
anchor RMSD of at least 1 A are likely to result in reductions in loop
RMSD of at least 0.5 A. Thus, improvements of 0.5 A or greater can

be expected around a quarter of the time with optimal positioning
of conserved fragments.

Better positioning of anchor regions provides a basis for improved
loop modelling, so the quality of the prediction on the entire length
should be further improved over that currently achieved. Combined
with optimal positioning of conserved template fragments, these
improvements demonstrate that the ability to optimally shift
conserved template fragments could yield improvements in structure
prediction better on average than those observed in CASP8.

3.4 Improvements in the template as a function of
other variables

Understanding how the characteristics of each protein pair inﬂuence
the magnitude of the shifts and rotations between two homologues
is potentially helpful for TBM; templates that may beneﬁt from such
modiﬁcations can then be identiﬁed.

The GLM for ARMSDa, constructed using the high—resolution
HOMSTRAD dataset, is summarized in Table 1. The improvement
in the predicted model that results from using the fragment—
optimized over the unmodiﬁed template varies as a function of the
structural similarity of target and template (approximated by SI),
alignment properties [the MFL and the number of fragments (NF)
in the alignment] and structure type (deﬁned by the HFT, which
is highly correlated with the helical fraction of the target). The
distributions of these variables are summarised in Supplementary
Figure S4, and their relationship with ARMSD in Supplementary
Figure S5. Speciﬁcally, ARMSDa is modelled multiplicatively as

ARMSDa = 2.670exp(—3.604NF_1)MFL_0‘585 exp(1.131HFT)SI_O‘258

The ARMSDa for any template—target alignment can be estimated in
the absence of the target structure by entering values corresponding
to the four variables.

The generality of the model was demonstrated by predicting
ARMSDa for the HOMSTRAD non—redundant dataset, as well as
the full CASP8 dataset. The observed versus predicted values are
plotted in Figure 7. The HOMSTRAD and CASP8 datasets are seen
to be predicted with an accuracy almost identical to that for the
data with which the model was built. This consistency indicates
that the relationship described between ARMSDa and the predictors
developed here applies generally.

The sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the alignment
quality was evaluated by reﬁtting the model using the CLUSTAL

aligned HOMSTRAD pairs. To enable generalization to proteins
more distantly homologous, the model was reﬁtted using the SCOP
dataset. The recalculated models are presented in Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2, and the contrasting parameter estimates discussed
qualitatively below.

The two variables of MFL and number of fragments are likely
to differ between alignment methods. The predictive model was
also re—estimated in the absence of these variables using both the
non—redundant HOMSTRAD dataset and the CLUSTAL—aligned
HOMSTRAD pairs. These are presented in Supplementary Tables
S3 and S4, respectively.

The predictions of ARMSD are not uniformly precise for all
ARMSD values; as ARMSDa increases, the precision with which it
can be estimated decreases. The usefulness of this result is evident in
that templates for which repositioning of conserved fragments does
not yield beneﬁt can be readily identiﬁed.

The four predictors are discussed below, in order of importance.

3.4. I Number of fragments ARMSDa increases with the number
of fragments. For example, the ratio of improvements in RMSD as
the number of fragments doubles from 5 to 10 is predicted to be
exp(—3.604(% — %))w 1.4, or an increase of 40%. The greater the
number of fragments in an alignment, the closer the template may
be made to approximate the target, the ﬁnal model being limited by
local structure differences in the individual fragments.

For both alignments of poorer quality (represented by the
CLUSTAL dataset) and proteins of more distant homology
(represented by the SCOP dataset), the effect of the number of
fragments on the ARMSD is very similar to the effect in the original
model (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).

3.4.2 Mean fragment length ARMSDa increases as the mean

conserved fragment length decreases. For example, when the MFL

. . . . —0.585
halves, the ratio of improvements in RMSD 1s % = 1.50 or an

increase of 50%. The shorter the rigid fragments used to approximate
the target, the more closely the backbone atoms can be superposed
and local structure differences removed.

Note that MFL and NF are functionally related—given the same
coverage of target by the template, a shorter fragment length results
in a greater number of fragments. The correlation between these
variables, however, is weak.

Greater ARMSD is achievable in poorer quality alignments
at shorter MFLs compared with high—quality alignments
(Supplementary Table S1). For high—quality alignments, however,
the effect of MFL is essentially unchanged across all levels of
homology (Supplementary Table S2).

3.4.3 Fraction of the template that is helical ARMSDa increases
with the proportion of residues in u—helices. For example, an
increase of 0.1 in the helical fraction yields a predicted increase of
exp(1.131 X0.1)~ 1.12 or 12% in ARMSDa. Secondary structure
within a protein provides regularity, greater for u—helices than for
,8—sheets. The regularity of helices allows local superposition to be
closer, so increasing ARMSDa. The effect of the HFT on ARMSD
changes little with alignment quality (Supplementary Table S1) and
homology (Supplementary Table S2).

The HFT is strongly related to structure class, and so differences
in ARMSD related to structure class are captured by the HFT
(Supplementary Fig. S6).

3.4.4 Sequence identity ARMSDa increases as SI decreases. For
example, comparing two templates with 35% and 70% SI to the

target, the predicted ARMSD is %_0‘258~1.20 or 20% greater
for the template with lesser SI. Low SI indicates a poor initial
approximation of the target by the template, leaving greater scope for
improvement in RMSD through optimal placement of the conserved
fragments.

For alignments of poorer quality (here represented by the
CLUSTAL dataset), greater improvements in ARMSD are predicted
(Supplementary Table S1) than when alignments are of higher
quality. Analysis of the SCOP dataset (Supplementary Table S2)
shows that the effect of SI is consistent even when protein pairs are
distantly homologous.

In the absence of variables MFL and NF, SI is still a useful
predictor of ARMSD for high—quality alignments (Supplementary
Table S3). When alignment quality decreases, greater improvements
are achievable at lower levels of SI (Supplementary Table S4), just
as for the full model presented above.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Pairs of homologous protein structures possess structurally
conserved regions that have accumulated differences in structure
throughout the process of evolution. Repositioning of such regions
is crucial in template—based prediction of protein structure, where
one protein is considered a target and the other a template. Such
repositioning can be broken into two stages, the ﬁrst stage being
a shift and rotation of the rigid structurally conserved region
minimizing target/template RMSD over the region, while the second
stage is a deformation bringing the two fragments into coincidence.
This article has quantiﬁed movements of the ﬁrst type and related
them to properties of the proteins and their alignment.

These results show that a closer approximation of the target
(a reduction of the order of 1A in RMSD) can often be found
via repositioning of conserved structure fragments. Removal of
differences between the local backbone conformation of the template

and target necessitates all—atom reﬁnement, and the difﬁculty of this
task is lessened if the fragments can initially be better positioned.
The magnitude of the improvement to be gained, and the relatively
lower dimensionality of optimally positioning fragments, suggests
that the latter is worthy of consideration in TBM.

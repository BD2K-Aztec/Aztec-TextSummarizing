ABSTRACT

Summary: Absynte (Archaeal and Bacterial Synteny Explorer) is a
web-based service designed to display local syntenies in completely
sequenced prokaryotic chromosomes. The genomic contexts are
determined with a multiple center star clustering topology on the
basis of a user-provided protein sequence and all (or a set of)
chromosomes from the publicly available archaeal and bacterial
genomes. The results consist in a dynamic web page where a
consistent color-coding permits a rapid visual evaluation of the
relative positioning of genes with similar sequences within the
synteny. Each gene composing the synteny can be further queried
interactively using either local or remote databases. Absynte results
can be exported in .CSV or high-resolution, .PDF formats for printing,
archival, further editing or publication purposes. Performance, real-
time computation, user-friendliness and daily database updates
constitute the principal advantages of Absynte over similar web
services.

1 INTRODUCTION

The availability of more than 1400 completely sequenced archaeal
and bacterial genomes at the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) repository provides a wealth of information
to researchers involved in prokaryotic genetics. In particular,
the comparison of the relative genetic positioning on microbial
chromosomes is of special interest not only to measure evolutionary
relationships between different species but also to deduce
the function of uncharacterized proteins. This conservation of
orthologous gene order is commonly referred as ‘synteny’ even if
in its original deﬁnition the term had a different meaning (Renwick,
1971). The extraction of syntenic information from sequenced
genomes involves the impractical manipulation of large data ﬁles
and the complexity of the task increases with the number of
genomes that need to be compared. The comparative analysis of
genome segments from prokaryotic organisms has been addressed
by web services such as GeConT2 (Martinez—Guerrero et al., 2008),
PSAT (Fong et al., 2008) and GCView (Grin and Linke, 2011).
Unfortunately, these web applications suffer from one or more
restrictions as discussed below. In response to these limitations, we
have developed Absynte (Archaeal and Bacterial Synteny Explorer)

a web tool, which only requires a user—provided protein sequence
to display the corresponding synteny from a daily updated list of
archaeal and bacterial genomes. This interactive web application
is executed in real time and is designed to extract, compare and
predict orthologous gene clusters originating from any combination
of sequenced prokaryotic organisms.

2 FEATURES

The Absynte workﬂow is initiated by the submission of a protein
sequence, which is ﬁrst compared to itself using BLASTP (Altschul
et al., 1997) in order to determine the maximal bit score.
The user then opts either to match this protein against all available
completely sequenced archaeal and bacterial chromosomes in the
database or to a selection of up to 50 individual replicons using
TBLASTN (Altschul et al., 1997). Normalization of the resulting
scores with the maximal bit value allows to sort the chromosomes
by decreasing score. Each matching chromosome determines a
15 kb—segment centered on the sequence similarity coordinates from
which open reading frames and protein sequences are extracted
according to GenBank annotations. The proteins from the highest
ranking chromosomes are compared to each other in order to detect
potential duplicates/paralogs using the Smith—Waterman—Gotoh
(SWG) algorithm (Gotoh, 1982). These proteins are then matched
using SWG against the proteins of the remaining chromosomes.
A consistent color code is assigned to matching proteins and synteny
maps are then rendered with their genes drawn to scale according
to the same color scheme. The alignment and coloring of all the
genes composing the genomic context maps allow an immediate
visual evaluation of the conservation of gene order across the
various analyzed genomes (Fig. 1). This in an advantage over other
synteny servers such as GCView, which will only trace user—deﬁned
syntenies using simple BLASTP searches. Absynte is designed to
produce synteny maps in real—time in order to simplify daily database
maintenance and update. The GeConT2 or PSAT web services
rely instead on pre—computed databases that are rarely updated
and lack recent genomes. Each newly added genome might indeed
require the impractical regeneration of the whole pre—computed
database. On the other hand, the real—time Absynte workﬂow is
more computationally intensive. Several techniques were therefore
elaborated in order to optimize the overall performance. Among
these, the development of parallel processing routines permitted
to fully exploit multi—core processors. In addition, a particular
interest was devoted to the implementation of routines such as SWG,
able to process data directly from faster live memory instead of
relying on slower temporary disk ﬁles. An additional beneﬁt of
Absynte is constituted by its ‘multiple center star’ gene clustering

topology which allows the detection of duplicates/paralogs even in
the highest ranking chromosome. These duplicates/paralogs would
be overlooked by the aforementioned web services that use instead
a star network topology. Absynte provides also full access to
all archaeal genomes contrarily to PSAT and GeConT2, which
offer respectively partial access and no access to these genomes.
To maximize intuitive user experience, the Absynte web service
was designed with an uncluttered user interface to insulate the user
from the complexity of the underlying data processing. The results
are presented in a rich and interactive graphical form, providing
additional information and external web links for each individual
gene. The results can be exported in .PDF and .CSV formats for
printing, imaging or further processing purposes

3 DATABASES

The Absynte database is located on the web server, it contains all the
bacterial and archaeal genomes provided by the NCBI repository.
It is used to calculate synteny maps and to provide contextual
gene information. The database update is fully automated and
synchronizes daily at 7:00 GMT with the NCBI repository using
the FTP protocol. Since they share the same database, Absynte
and the previously described BAGET and FITBAR servers form
a complementary set of web tools (Oberto, 2008, 2010). Additional
taxonomic and speciﬁc gene coding information is available through
hypertext links to the corresponding NCBI services.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The analysis of synteny constitutes the criteria of choice to establish
the orthology of genomic regions in different species and more
importantly allows inference of important functional relationships
between genes. We presented here Absynte, a web tool able to

explore conservation of prokaryotic gene sequence similarity by
the means of a multiple center star clustering algorithm. The initial
protein comparisons are executed with TBLASTN instead of
BLASTP to avoid potential inaccuracies in genomic annotations.
The computations are executed in real—time, from live memory,
on the full set of daily updated archaeal and bacterial genomes,
allowing independence from pre—calculated databases more difﬁcult
to maintain. We believe that the rapid identiﬁcation of synteny
provided by Absynte might be of wide interest for researchers
dealing with prokaryotic genetics and could constitute a valid
complement to phylogenetic analyses of gene clusters.

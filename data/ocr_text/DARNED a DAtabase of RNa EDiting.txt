ABSTRACT

Motivation: RNA editing is a phenomenon, which is responsible for
the alteration of particular nucleotides in RNA sequences relative
to their genomic templates. Recently, a large number of RNA
editing instances in humans have been identified using bioinformatic
screens and high-throughput experimental investigations utilizing
next-generation sequencing technologies. However, the available
data on RNA editing are not uniform and difficult to access.
Results: Here, we describe a new database DARNED (DAtabase of
RNa EDiting) that provides centralized access to available published
data related to RNA editing. RNA editing locations are mapped on
the reference human genome. The current release of the database
contains information on approximately 42000 human genome
coordinates corresponding to RNA locations that undergo RNA
editing, mostly involving adenosine-to—inosine (A-to-l) substitutions.
The data can be queried using a range of genomic coordinates,
their corresponding functional localization in RNA molecules [Exons,
lntrons, CoDing Sequence (CD8) and UnTranslated Regions (UTRs)]
and information regarding tissue/organ/cell sources where RNA
editing has been observed. It is also possible to obtain RNA
editing information for a specific gene or an RNA molecule
using corresponding accession numbers. Search results provide
information on the number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
supporting edited and genomic bases, functional localization of RNA
editing and existence of known single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs). Editing data can be explored in UCSC and Ensembl
genome browsers, in conjunction with additional data provided
by these popular genome browsers. DARNED has been designed
for researchers seeking information on RNA editing and for the
developers of novel algorithms for its prediction.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNA editing is a biological phenomenon of changing RNA sequence
relative to its corresponding DNA template by inserting, deleting or
substituting one or a few nucleotides (B ass, 2002; Gott and Emeson,
2000; Maas and Rich, 2000). It is distinct from other nucleotide
modiﬁcations in which nucleotides retain their identities during
decoding or sequencing. For instance, a change of adenosine—to—
inosine (A—to—I) is considered as RNA editing, since inosines are
recognized as guanosines by polymerases and the translationary

machinery, while methylation of adenosines is not considered an
editing event, since the identity of the nucleotide remains the same.
RNA editing has been found across all kingdoms of life, including
Viruses (Casey, 2006; Kolakofsky et al., 2005). There are several
molecular mechanisms responsible for RNA editing. It can occur
co—transcriptionally, for example, due to slippage of a growing
nascent RNA chain relative to its template resulting in insertion
or deletion of nucleotides (Baranov et al., 2005; Iseni et al., 2002;
Penno et al., 2006; Tamas et al., 2008). Alternatively, it can be
a result of enzymatic modiﬁcation, e.g. deamination of cytidines
and adenosines that leads to the formation of uridines and inosines,
respectively (Bass, 2002).

Earlier, RNA editing was known to be particularly abundant in
plant organelles (Covello and Gray, 1989) and was also identiﬁed
in a few human genes, where it contributes to diversiﬁcation of
corresponding protein products, such as those encoding the ApoB
protein and the glutamate and serotonin receptors (B ass, 2002; Chen
et al., 1987; Seeburg et al., 1998). The abundance of RNA editing
in humans, however, has only recently come to light. Most RNA
editing instances found so far in humans involve A—to—I conversions
that are carried out by ADARs (Adenosine Deaminase that Acts on
RNAs). ADARs bind to double—stranded regions of RNA molecules
and catalyze deamination of adenosines, converting them to inosine
residues (Bass, 2002). Therefore, the majority of RNA editing
instances occur in regions where long RNA stem—loop structures
can be formed and are particularly abundant among Alu repeats
(Athanasiadis et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2004; Levanon,K. et al., 2005).

RNA editing plays a variety of functional roles in gene expression.
RNA editing of a nucleotide within the CoDing Sequence (CDS)
may change the identity of a particular encoded amino acid or could
generate signiﬁcantly altered protein sequences if editing leads to
the formation of a stop codon (e. g. the ApoB case mentioned earlier).
Editing occurring within introns can affect splicing, effectively
resulting in the generation of alternatively spliced products (Maas
and Gommans, 2009). Hyper—editing of UnTranslated Regions
(UTRs) leads to retention of mRNA inside the nucleus, consequently
down—regulating synthesis of the encoded protein by preventing
transport of its mRNA to the cytoplasm (Sansam et al., 2003).
An interesting role of RNA editing is in diversiﬁcation of miRNA
sequences that consequently change their target repertoire (Blow
et al., 2006; Kawahara et al., 2008). Abnormal RNA editing has
also been associated with a number of diseases, including several
neurological disorders and cancers (Klimek—Tomczak et al., 2006;
Vollmar et al., 2004).

A large number of recently discovered RNA editing instances
have been found by means of bioinformatic screens of discrepancies
between genomic sequences and corresponding RNA products,
and by applying statistical ﬁlters to distinguish RNA editing from

sequencing errors or human polymorphisms (Athanasiadis et al.,
2004; Clutterbuck et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2004; Levanon et al.,
2004). Recent developments in high—throughput parallel sequencing
technologies have facilitated the experimental analysis of a large
amount of RNA editing candidates, making the past year particularly
remarkable for the area (Li et al., 2009). A surprisingly large number
of conﬁrmed RNA editing instances have been found in protein—
coding regions. Interestingly, many proteins whose sequences are
altered by means of RNA editing are not directly involved in
synaptic functions, contrary to previous observations that RNA
editing affects mostly proteins which function in the nervous
system (Hoopengardner et al., 2003; Jepson and Reenan, 2008;
Levanon,E.Y. et al., 2005). The data on RNA editing accumulated
so far are spread across a number of research papers in the form of
supplementary ﬁles. Even though there are a few databases dedicated
to RNA editing, such as REDIdb (Picardi et al., 2007) and DbRES
(He at al., 2007), they do not provide access to these new datasets
on human RNA editing. According to a recent examination (during
the preparation of this manuscript), REDIdb did not have any data
related to human RNA editing, while DbRES contains information
on only 34 instances. Therefore, there is a clear and timely need for
a resource that would provide uniﬁed access to the accumulating
information on RNA editing in humans.

To generate such a resource, we have designed a database,
called DARNED (DAtabase of RNa EDiting), which is freely
accessible at http://darned.ucc.ie. DARNED is a convenient resource
allowing centralized uniform access to growing information on RNA
editing in humans. At present the database stores information on
approximately 42 000 instances of RNA editing. While most of the
current data are on A—to—I editing, a few citidine—to—uridine (C—to—U)
instances are also included in the DARNED dataset.

2 DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING

For data collection, we searched PubMed for articles describing
newly identiﬁed instances of RNA editing. We have identiﬁed four
types of datasets: (i) those based on bioinformatics analysis of
discrepancies between cDNA sequences and genomic sequences
(Blow et al., 2006; Clutterbuck et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2004;
Levanon et al., 2004; Levanon,K. et al., 2005); (ii) analysis of
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data (Eisenberg et al., 2005;
Levanon,E.Y. et al., 2005); (iii) analysis of miRNA (Blow et al.,
2006; Kawahara et al., 2008); and (iV) results of high—throughput
sequencing of RNA and DNA samples from the same tissues (Li
et al., 2009).

To describe RNA editing instances in a uniform format, we
decided to map RNA editing locations to the reference human
genome. Since original data have been formatted in different ways,
we processed each dataset in a unique manner. For example,
Levanon et al. (2004) generated a dataset with sequences ﬂanking
editing locations by 100 nt on both sides. To process these data, we
used BLAT (Kent, 2002) to identify genomic locations matching
these ﬂanking sequences. Coordinates corresponding to the position
101 (within 201 nt sequences) have been chosen as genomic
locations that are edited on the RNA level. (Kim et al., 2004)
have provided accession numbers of edited cDNAs also indicating
matching coordinates from hg16 human genome assembly. To
process these data, the coordinates of hg16 assembly were converted
into coordinates of the hg18 assembly using UCSC liftOVer tool

(Kuhn et al., 2009). Further BLAT was used to generate alignments
between cDNA sequences and genomic sequences. Adenosine—to—
guanosine (A—to—G) mismatches were further identiﬁed using a
custom python script and the coordinates of mismatches were
extracted. Research articles dedicated to the analysis of SNP data
have reported accession numbers of SNPs in dbSNP (Sherry et al.,
2001). We used these accession numbers to ﬁnd genomic coordinates
of SNPs that were further taken directly into the DARNED dataset as
locations of RNA editing. Kawahara et al. (2008) have reported RNA
editing locations within miRNA sequences. Since miRNA sequences
are short, they are not suitable for the BLAT search. Therefore,
corresponding pre—miRNA sequences have been downloaded from
the miRBase (Grifﬁths—Jones et al., 2006). Pre—miRNA sequences
were then aligned to mature miRNA sequences using ClustalW2
(Larkin et al., 2007) to identify RNA editing locations within
miRNA sequences. Next, miRNA sequences were aligned to the
reference genome using BLAT and coordinates corresponding to
RNA locations were extracted in a manner similar to that described
above. Genomic coordinates have been reported in a number
of datasets. In cases where the coordinates corresponded to the
hg18 assembly, the data were used directly, while for instances
where coordinates corresponded to previous assemblies, they were
converted to hg18 using the UCSC LiftOVer tool. The total number
of RNA editing instances currently stored in the database is about
42 000.

Information on C—to—U editing was obtained from the following
research publications: Blanc and Davidson (2003), Keegan et al.
(2001) and Kondo et al. (2004).

For all RNA instances, DARNED provides information on a
number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) supporting both edited
and non—edited base identities, information on tissue or cell type
sources and also on functional regions in RNAs. Tissue source
information has been extracted directly from the datasets of the
analyzed research articles. To obtain information on EST sequences
supporting edited or non—edited bases, coordinates of matching
ESTs and genomic blocks were obtained from the all_est MySQL
table of UCSC genome browser. Base identities of RNA editing
genomic locations were then compared with base identities in the
corresponding locations of individual ESTs. Functional regions of
RNA editing locations were identiﬁed using the refGene MySQL
table of UCSC genome browser and ﬁrst classiﬁed as intronic or
exonic. Further, exonic regions were sub—classiﬁed as CDS, 5’ or 3’
UTRs. Locations that did not correspond to mRNA sequences were
classiﬁed as ‘others’.

3 DATABASE INTERFACE

The database can be freely accessed at http://darned.ucc.ie. The web
interface is based on HTML and Python/CGI scripts that provide
access to a local MySQL database. The search page of DARNED
provides the interface for querying the database. Figure 1 illustrates
a combination of the search form and an example of a search
output. To search the database, a user needs to specify a region
within the reference human genome (hg18 assembly) by specifying
a chromosome ID and a coordinate range. The default is set at zero
value, which will result in querying the entire chromosome length.
The search can be limited by several ﬁlters. First, it can be limited
to a tissue where supporting sequences (cDNA, EST or RNAseq
short reads) have been identiﬁed. The user can then choose between

normal or cancerous tissues or human cell lines. After that choice
has been made, the user is provided with additional menus that list
available sources (a particular tissue type or a cell line). The data
output can also be limited to a particular functional region within
an RNA molecule (intronic, exonic or others) Exonic regions can be
further speciﬁed as CDS, 5’ or 3’ UTRs. The last option in the search
form is speciﬁcation of ﬂanking sequence length. This value is used
to specify the length of genomic region in which RNA location will
be displayed in UCSC genome browser custom tracks (Kuhn et al.,
2009) or Ensembl distributed annotation system (DAS; Hubbard
et al., 2009) for global exploration of RNA editing in the context of
other available information for a chosen genomic region.

Alternatively, the database can be searched for RNA editing
instances associated with a particular gene or a molecule. For this
purpose, the user can choose the menu located at the bottom of the
search page, where sequence type needs to be speciﬁed and then an
accession number for corresponding sequence needs to be inserted
into the adjacent box.

Search results are displayed in the form of a table (Fig. 1B).
The text above the table contains links to the UCSC custom tracks
[U] and Ensembl [E] corresponding to the entire region of the
human genome speciﬁed in the search form. Each row of the
table itself corresponds to a particular editing location. The table
is organized into 10 columns: location, strand, editing, SNP, gene,
sequence region, exon region, source, EST ratio and reference.
The location column provides genomic reference coordinates with
a chromosome index separated from a coordinate by a dot, e.g.
chr1.239848 and links to custom tracks on UCSC [U] and Ensembl
[E] genome browsers. Clicking on these links opens a separate
window in a corresponding genome browser showing a coordinate
of RNA editing within a ﬂanking region speciﬁed in the search form.
Strand indicates from which strand an edited RNA is transcribed.
The menu option allows to group entries by strand. The editing
column provides information on the type of editing associated with
the particular chromosomal location, e.g. A—to—I or C—to—U. SNP

column indicates whether there is a known SNP in dbSNP, in which
case RefSNP accession number is given that is hyperlinked to its
corresponding entry in NCBI dbSNP. A number of SNPs in the
dbSNP are not supported by genomic sequences and their validation
is classiﬁed as ‘unknown’, such cases are likely to be RNA editing
events misinterpreted as SNPs (Eisenberg et al., 2005). To help
users to compare DARNED and dbSNP data, SNPs with unknown
validation are marked with t symbol. Gene column provides
information on a gene if it is associated with a corresponding
locus, the gene name is linked to a separate table (an example can
be found in the Help page of DARNED). This table lists all the
known transcript variants for this gene and functional classiﬁcation
of the edited locations in relation to the individual transcripts.
Transcripts are listed by their accession numbers and hyperlinked to
NCBI RefSeq database. Sequence region indicates whether the RNA
editing location corresponds to intronic or exonic sequences and in
the case of an exonic sequence, the next column exonic region also
indicates a functional location within a corresponding mRNA, e. g.
CDS, 5’ or 3’ UTR. Information on a tissue or a cell type where
a corresponding RNA molecule has been identiﬁed is provided in
the source column. EST ratio column provides information on the
number of ESTs that are consistent with the edited base (E) and
the number of ESTs that are consistent with the genomic base (N)
separated by a colon. The EST ratio is not intended to indicate the
efﬁciency of RNA editing, since (i) RNA editing could be tissue
or developmentally regulated and (ii) available ESTs are likely
to be skewed in representation of different sources. Clicking on
a particular number of ESTs within a particular cell generates a
new table where all ESTs are listed by their accession numbers and
also by the source from which they were obtained. An example
of such a table can be found in DARNED help page. All EST
accession numbers are hyperlinked with corresponding entries in
dbEST. Finally, the PubMed column contains citations of primary
sources where RNA editing has been identiﬁed, with a link to its
abstract on PubMed. The data in the table can be sorted using devoted
links in the header of the table or can be grouped together according
to a particular value in the table by clicking on that value within the
table.

4 CUSTOM TRACKS AND FUNCTIONAL
DISTRIBUTION OF RNA EDITING SITES

Custom tracks for the UCSC genome browser and Ensembl DAS
have been designed to provide users with means to explore RNA
editing datasets within their genomic locations in one of the two
most popular human genome browsers. For each search, cgi script
designs a new custom track in the bed format as a separate ﬁle for
each individual chromosome. Figure 2 illustrates screen—shots of
RNA editing custom tracks at different levels of magniﬁcation. Each
RNA editing location is indicated as a differentially colored vertical
dash. Differential coloring is used to indicate a type of functional
RNA region where an edited base is located, i.e. red for intron, blue
for CDS, dark green for 5’ UTR and deep pink for 3’ UTR.

The current distribution of known RNA editing instances in terms
of their functional location within RNA molecules is shown in
Figure 3. An interesting observation that can be made from this
distribution is that RNA editing is signiﬁcantly more frequent in 3’
UTRs compared with 5’ UTRs.

5 FUTURE PROSPECTS

DARNED will accommodate the novel RNA editing data that
is anticipated to become available in the near future due to
the progress in high—throughput sequencing technologies such
as whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (Mardis, 2008;
Wang et al., 2009). This anticipation is based on a recent frontier
article on the analysis of ~36 K suspected RNA editing candidates
in seven human tissues (Li et al., 2009). These data are extremely
useful in that they provide direct experimental analysis of RNA
editing instances with reliable information on the efﬁciency of RNA
editing and currently they form the largest bulk of data in DARNED.

 

 

Fig. 3. Distribution of RNA editing instances in different functional
locations of RNA molecules.

Using such data, we plan to design more detailed descriptions of
RNA editing locations, which will include data on the efﬁciencies of
RNA editing levels in individual human tissues based on quantities
of corresponding short reads.

To keep the database synchronized with the developments in the
RNA editing ﬁeld, we constantly monitor newly published literature.
We also plan to expand the Database to accommodate RNA editing
data that is available for other model organisms.

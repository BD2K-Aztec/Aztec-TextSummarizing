Abstract

Motivation: The number of sequenced genomes rises steadily, but we still lack the knowledge about
the biological roles of many genes. Automated function prediction (AFP) is thus a necessity. We hy-
pothesize that AFP approaches which draw on distinct genome features may be useful for predicting
different types of gene functions, motivating a systematic analysis of the benefits gained by obtaining
and integrating such predictions.

Results: Our pipeline amalgamates 5,133,543 genes from 2,071 genomes in a single massive anal-
ysis that evaluates five established genomic AFP methodologies. While 1,227 Gene Ontology terms
yielded reliable predictions, the majority of these functions were accessible to only one or two of the
methods. Moreover, different methods tend to assign a GO term to non-overlapping sets of genes.
Thus, inferences made by diverse AFP methods display a striking complementary, both gene-wise
and function-wise. Because of this, a viable integration strategy is to rely on a single most-confident
prediction per gene/function, instead of enforcing agreement across multiple AFP methods. Using an
information-theoretic approach, we estimate that current databases contain 29.2 bits/gene of known
E. coli gene functions. This can be increased by up to 5.5 bits/gene using individual AFP methods, or
by 11 additional bits/gene upon integration, thereby providing a highly-ranking predictor on the
CAFA2 community benchmark. Availability of more sequenced genomes boosts the predictive accu-
racy of AFP approaches and also the benefit from integrating them.

1 INTRODUCHON

Even though the number of sequenced genomes rises steadily, we still
lack the knowledge about the biological roles of many genes. Gene
ﬁinction may be determined experimentally, for instance by observing
a phenotype of a mutant organism with an altered or deleted gene of
interest (Brochado and Typas, 2013), allowing curators to annotate the
gene with Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Ashbumer et a1., 2000) or with
other controlled vocabularies. Experimental essays coupled to manual
curation result in high quality ﬁinction assignments, but are costly,
time consuming, and cannot keep up with the deluge of new genome
sequences. Reliable automated ﬁinction prediction (AF P) methods are,
therefore, of key importance for ﬁinctional annotation of newly se-
quenced genomes and metagenomes (Radivojac et a1., 2013, The
CAFA Consortium, 2016).

The most common approach to AFP is transferring ﬁll’lCthl’lS from
homologs - genes with shared ancestry - estimated by sequence simi-
larity using BLAST (Altschul et a1., 1990) or other tools. In addition
to homology, there exist many AFP methods that exploit additional
information extracted from the genome sequence, e. g., conserved gene
neighborhoods (Ling et a1., 2009), phylogenetic distribution (Pelle-
grini et a1., 1999), protein motifs and biophysical properties (Ofer and
Linial, 2015), codon usage biases (Krisko et a1., 2014), remote homol-
ogy OIawkins et a1., 2009; Sokolov and Ben-Hur, 2010), and compo-
sition of protein domains (Hunter et a1., 2011; Punta et a1., 2011).
Moreover, inference using genomic information can be ﬁirther sup-
plemented by experimental data: gene expression (Tian et a1., 2008),
protein-protein interactions (Cao and Cheng, 2015) or protein struc-
ture (W ass et a1., 2012), and also by text-mining the scientiﬁc litera-
ture (Cozzetto et a1., 2013).

Combining diverse AF P models leads to higher accuracy. This was
made evident in the analyses of gene/protein ﬁinctional association
networks, constructed using various sources of large-scale data.
Integrating the individual networks resulted in gene modules that were
more ﬁinctionally consistent (Lee et a1., 2004; von Mering et a1.,
2005) and could thus more accurately predict gene ﬁinction (Troyan-
skaya et a1., 2003; Hu et a1., 2009) or phenotypic effects of gene
perturbation (Lee et a1., 2010).

One explanation for the beneﬁts of integration is that random error
from individual data sources cancels out, enabling the signal of gene
ﬁinction to surface. In addition, different sources of genomic or exper-
imental data may be intrinsically better suited for predicting some
gene ﬁinctions than for others. For instance, physical protein-protein
interactions more directly correspond to the ‘Cellular component’
domain of the GO, while genetic interaction experiments relate to the
‘Biological process’ GO domain. Such rules may, however, also
extend to the deeper, more informative levels of the GO. A known
example is the contrast between ribosomal proteins and membrane
proteins in yeast, where the former are predictable from gene co-
expression, while in the latter case, protein compositional features are
more relevant (Lanckriet et a1., 2004). More generally, assigning
ﬁinction-speciﬁc weights to integrated gene networks inferred from
biological experiments improves AF P accuracy (Myers and Troyan-
skaya, 2007; Mostafavi and Morris, 2010). Thus, different high-
throughput experimental assays appear to be better suited for predict-
ing different aspects of a gene’s role in the cell. Given that AFP
methods often draw on analysis of genome sequences to predict gene
ﬁinction, it is thus important to systematically characterize the beneﬁts
to combining genomic methods.

We there fore investigate to what extent ﬁve well-known sequence-
based methodologies differ in their ability to assign particular gene
ﬁinctions across many organisms. One known example are stress
response genes, where phylogenetic proﬁling was shown to be accu-
rate for heat, osmotic and DNA damage responses, but codon usage
biases were superior for starvation and oxidative stresses (Skunca et

a1., 2013; Krisko et a1., 2014). We search for broader trends of this
sort by examining the overlap and complementarity between purely
genome-based AF P methods. An advantage of these approaches is that
they apply to any organism with a genome sequence of sufﬁcient
quality and do not require costly and time-consuming large-scale
experimentation that is restricted to a handful of model organisms.

Relying exclusively on genomic data enabled us to perform AFP on
a massive scale, considering >2,000 bacterial and archaeal genomes
with >5 million genes in a single analysis, assigning 4,145 different
GO ﬁll’lCthl’lS. Since the amount of sequenced genomes will continue
to rise rapidly, there is a need to characterize the contribution of
various genomic AF P methodologies towards resolving particular
ﬁinctions of poorly described genes. Crucially, we investigate to what
extent the methods will beneﬁt from ﬁiture availability of more ge-
nomes. Using information-theoretic measures, we quantify the current
knowledge on gene ﬁinction in model microorganisms, and suggest
that common AFP methods applied to the already-available genome
sequences can provide very high-conﬁdence predictions that increase
this knowledge by at least 20%. The results of our analysis provide
guidelines to researchers on how to best integrate predictions of
diverse AFP methods. In particular, one simple but surprisingly
accurate strategy is to rely on a single most conﬁdent prediction for a
given gene and ﬁinction, thus best exploiting the complementarity
between individual genomic predictors.

2 METHODS

2.1 Representing gene families using diverse sets of ge-
nomic features

Our pipeline includes ﬁve well-established AF P methods relying on
genomic data, which we examined in terms of complementarity of
their predictions (Fig. l; implementation details in Sec. Sl).

First, the phyletic proﬁles (PP) method represents the COG/NOG
gene families (OGs; see below) by the presence/absence patterns of
their member genes across 2,071 genomes, and then makes inferences
about gene ﬁinctions by comparing such patterns via pairwise simi-
larity (Fig. Sla; Pellegrini et a1., 1999; Kensche et a1., 2008; de
Vienne and Azé, 2012) or by machine learning (Tian et a1., 2008;

Skunca et a1., 2013).

Second, biophysical and protein sequence properties (BPS) method
includes 1,170 features representing amino acid composition, particu-
lar motifs or periodicities (King et a1., 2001; Jensen et a1., 2003;
Lanckriet et a1., 2004; Minneci et a1., 2013) and various sequence
statistics (summary in Sec. S1). Features were extracted using ProFET
(Ofer and Linial, 2015).

Third, evolutionarily conserved gene neighborhoods (CGN) may
reﬂect co-regulated genes (Rogozin et a1., 2002; Lemay et a1., 2012)
and can thus be used to infer gene ﬁinction (Ling et a1., 2009). Here,
the data consists of the average log-distance (in bp) between genes
from individual gene families, measured across all genomes (Fig.
Sld). For computational efﬁciency reasons, the feature set encom-
passes the 5,891 most common gene families (occurring in 2100
genomes).

Fourth, signal from remote homologs may predict gene ﬁinction,
because such (individually unreliable) hits may be collectively en-
riched with correct gene ﬁll’lCthl’lS (W ass and Stemberg, 2008; Haw-
kins et a1., 2009). We employ the empirical kernel map (EKM) (Tsu-
da, 1999; Lanckriet et a1., 2004; Sokolov and Ben-Hur, 2010) ap-
proach, wherein sequence similarity between pairs of OGs is consid-
ered by performing searches towards a reference set of genomes, in
our case encompassing six genomes (Sec. S1) and 8,447 OGs therein.

Fifth, evolution of codon usage biases relates to phenotypic diver-
gence (Man and Pilpel, 2007) and can be used to predict the roles of
genes in environmental adaptation (Supek et a1., 2010; Krisko et a1.,
2014). The translation efﬁciency proﬁles (TEP) (Krisko et a1., 2014)
measure codon biases associated to gene expression; similarity of such
proﬁles suggests co-evolution of expression levels (Fraser et a1.,
2004). The proﬁles are represented with 2,071 features indicating
OG’s predicted expression levels throughout genomes, and additional-
ly 5,891 features that capture OGs predicted co-expression patterns
(Sec. S1, Fig. Slc).

2.2 Integrating across genomes in a single massive AFP
analysis

Importantly, prior to making inferences with each method, we amal-
gamate 5,133,543 genes from the 2,071 bacterial and archaeal ge-
nomes using COG/NOG gene families, here collectively referred to as
OGs. In particular, we selected 21,626 OGs from the EggNOG 4
database (Powell et a1., 2013) that were represented in at least 20
genomes. These OGs form examples in our data sets, each described
by the ﬁve distinct groups of features, as described above.

Having a single, cross-genome set of training examples facilitates
unbiased comparisons between the AFP methods, with conclusions
valid for many organisms. Such a gene family-based representation is
moreover orders of magnitude computationally more efﬁcient than
treating thousands of organisms separately (the typically employed
‘focal species’ approach).

Using OGs as examples bears an implicit assumption that the genes
within an OG share ﬁinctions, and thus can be represented by a single
data point obtained by integrating over all genes in the OG. In prac-
tice, the GO term labels of the OG were obtained by propagating the
known ﬁinctions of individual genes across the OG, if a speciﬁc
ﬁinction is initially assigned to at least 50% of the OG member genes
that had known ﬁinctions (as in Skunca et a1., 2013). This yields
15,318 OGs with at least one non-root GO term assigned, which
constitute the training set of examples; the remaining 6,308 OGs were
initially unlabelled but could receive predictions. Thus, our pipeline
ﬁrst propagates GO annotations via sequence similarity within the
OGs, and then transfers GO ﬁinctions across the OGs using machine
learning on ﬁve genomic representations, which are orthogonal to the
homology trans fer employed in the ﬁrst step.

A classiﬁcation model is constructed for each of the ﬁve AFP
methods using the supervised learning algorithm CLUS-HMC, a
Random Forest classiﬁer adapted for hierarchical multi-label classiﬁ-
cation. CLUS-HMC can exploit the hierarchical relationships in GO to
achieve higher predictive performance (Blockeel et a1., 2006; Vens et
a1., 2008) and was previously used for AFP tasks (Schietgat et a1.,
2010; Slavkov et a1., 2010; Skunca et a1., 2013). For each OG and GO
term pair, the classiﬁer outputs a score ranging between 0 and 1 that
indicates conﬁdence in assignment of that ﬁinction to the OG.

Predictions from the individual classiﬁers are then combined. One
approach to this is 'early ﬁision', which would imply joining the ﬁve
sets of features together before having constructed classiﬁcation
models (Snoek et a1., 2005; Dong et a1., 2014). Here, we employ the
'late ﬁision' approach, wherein each set of features was used to train a
separate classiﬁer and the outcomes were subsequently combined
using different schemes.

The 'one vote' scheme requires the support of only a single classiﬁ-
er, meaning it reports the maximum conﬁdence observed among the
individual classiﬁers. On the other hand, 'two votes' and 'three votes'
schemes require independent support of more classiﬁers at a given
level of conﬁdence, meaning they report the second-highest and third-
highest score. Next, 'weighted voting' reports the mean of individual
classiﬁers’ conﬁdences weighted by classiﬁers’ accuracy (as the area
under precision-recall curve (AUPRC) score; explained below).
Finally, 'consensus' considers support of 21 classiﬁer, reporting conﬁ-
dence at least equal to the maximum conﬁdence among the individual
classiﬁers, which can be ﬁirther increased with calls from additional
classiﬁers and was computed as:

cconsemusmsbsoj) = 1 — UMP (1 — cp(06i,r;0,-)) (1)

CI) is a conﬁdence of an individual predictor p that GOj is assigned to
an OGi. P is the set of ﬁve classiﬁcation models, each trained on a set
of features derived from a single AF P method.

2.3 Complementarity analysis and evaluation measures

First, a visual estimate of overall complementarity between methods
was provided by clustered heatmaps revealing groups of GO ﬁll’lCthl’lS
well-predicted by each of the methods. Second, precision-recall (P-R)
curves and the corresponding area-under-P-R-curve (AUPRC) score
quantify the accuracy of individual predictors and of the combination
schemes. Third, the choice of the scheme(s) is validated on the exter-
nal Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation 2 (CAFA 2) bench-
mark (The CAFA Consortium, 2016). Finally, selected scheme(s) are
evaluated in terms of the proportion of genes in model microorgan-
isms that received new GO ﬁll’lCthl’lS, amount of novel information
brought by that ﬁll’lCthl’lS and the extent to which the scheme(s) may
beneﬁt from additional genomes.

In the P-R analysis, the predictors’ generalization ability is estimat-
ed using out-of-bag cross-validation (Breiman et a1., 2001) performed
on 15,318 OGs with available GO annotations. For OG-GO pairs, the
conﬁdence scores given by the classiﬁer are converted into the preci-
sion (Pr) scores using P-R curves obtained from cross-validation.
Importantly, unlike the conﬁdence score, Pr has a probabilistic inter-
pretation and is equivalent to 1 - false discovery rate (FDR). Upon
combining the conﬁdence scores of the ﬁve classiﬁcation models, this
integrated score is also converted to a Pr score using the joint P-R
curve. In this setting, the individual ﬁlSlOl’l schemes are not inherently
more permissive or more stringent, but the tradeoff between the two
extremes can be adjusted by choosing a Pr threshold for the ﬁised
predictions.

AUPRC represents the area under P-R curve, summarizing the pre-
cision vs. recall tradeoff at various Pr levels. It is computed separately
for each GO term by varying a Pr threshold from one to zero, thus
gradually relaxing stringency of the predictions and consequently

9mg ‘09 isnﬁnV uo salaﬁuV s01 ‘erHJOJrIBQ jo AirSJQAru [1 112 [310'8112(Ian[plOJXO'SODBIILIOJHIOIQ/[I(11111 uroxj popcorumoq

 

increasing the number of OGs that receive a G0 label. Classiﬁer
AUPRC is an area under P-R curve averaged over individual GO
curves.

Further, both the training set and unlabeled OGs are classiﬁed with
each of the ﬁve classiﬁers, following the rationale that the sets of
known ﬁll’lCthl’lS assigned to OGs are incomplete (Dessimoz et a1.,
2013).

We validate our predictions using CAFA 2, an AFP community
challenge where organizers publish a benchmark set with unknown
ﬁinction (Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation; The CAFA
Consortium, 2016). After the submission closes, the experimentally-
veriﬁed annotations for these genes are collected during a certain
period of time and later used to evaluate the competing methods. We
benchmarked our results against CAFA 2 Escherichia coli set of
annotations, following rules of the challenge (the ‘no-knowledge’
benchmark in ﬁill evaluation mode). The evaluations of accuracy of
the 129 CAFA 2 participating methods and the BLAST baseline were
downloaded from the CAFA web page. The Fmax measure is computed
as the maximum F-measure (harmonic mean of the precision and
recall scores), and its standard deviation using bootstrapping (Sup-
plementary Methods).

We estimated the total information in gene ﬁinction annotations
contributed by different predictors using the information accretion
(IA) measure (Clark and Radivojac, 2013). LA of a GO term quantiﬁes
the increase in specialization in the set of genes assigned to that GO
term, compared to its parent in the GO graph. In particular, LA equals
zero when the information content of a GO term is equal to its parent.
It was computed as:

LA(GOi) = —log2 P(GOi|T) (2)
T is a set of parent terms of G01 and P denotes conditional probability.
We summed the LA of assigned annotations on the gene level and

expressed it in bits per gene, both for known GO annotations and also
for newly-pre dicted ones in several representative genomes.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Extensive complementarity between AFP methods

Two methods that predict gene ﬁinctions are complementary if one
draws on a set of features strongly associated with genes having a
certain ﬁinction, while the features used by the other method are
uninformative in the context of that speciﬁc ﬁinction.

A simple measure of complementarity is to consider whether a G0
ﬁinction is learnable by a certain method, here deﬁned as the method
being able to provide at least one prediction at Pr250% (equivalent to
550% FDR) measured in cross-validation. In other words, the features
considered by this method can be used to consistently recover one or
more genes with that GO ﬁinction from the entire dataset. Out of
4,145 GO ﬁll’lCthl’lS considered in our analyses, 1,227 are learnable by
either of the ﬁve methods or some combination thereof. Remarkably,
30% of these GO ﬁll’lCthl’lS are only learnable by a single classiﬁer
and inaccessible to the other four. A ﬁirther 25% are only learnable by
two out of ﬁve classiﬁers (Fig. 2a). In other words, almost half of the
learnable GO terms are not accessible to the majority of the AFP
methods. On the other hand, only 16% of the GOs are learnable by all
of the ﬁve classiﬁers, and moreover these disparities become even
more pronounced with a more stringent threshold for leamability
(520% FDR; Fig. 2b). This reveals a considerable complementarity
between the different methods: if methods are applied individually,
some gene ﬁll’lCthl’lS may be predicted highly accurately while the
others not at all. A combination of genome sequence-based predictors
is able to reach many different GO ﬁinctions, consistent with the
success of past approaches that integrate across large-scale experi-
mental data sources (Troyanskaya et a1., 2003; Lee et a1., 2004;

a1., 2010).

Next, we compare the accuracy of individual classiﬁers measured by
the cross-validation AUPRC score (Methods) for each individual GO
category (Fig. 2c). A broad trend can be observed when comparing the
three GO domains: the two sequence-based methods (EKM and BPS)
are generally better at predicting Molecular ﬁinction GOs than the

9mg ‘09 1sn8nV uo sejeﬁuV s01 ‘121u10111123 jo A1is19Aiuf1 112 ﬂJO's112umofpinXO'soi112u1101uioiq//:d11q 111011 papeolumoq

Biological process GOs (p=3.6*10'7 and 0.02 for EKM and BPS,
respectively; Mann—Whitney test). This is consistent with their ability
to capture protein sequence motifs and general structural features
informative of enzymatic activity. On the contrary, the three ‘genomic
context’ methods (PP, TEP and CGN) are better at predicting the
Biological process GOs (p=10'13, 2*10'4 and 3*10'8, respectively).
This is consistent with their ability to capture the signal emanating
ﬁom genetic interactions, thus describing the context of a protein in a
ﬁinctional association network.

The methods’ relative performance also broadly differs between the
generality levels of GO ﬁll’lCthl’lS (Fig. 2d). The sequence motif-based
EKM and BPS methods are more adept at capturing broader, more
general ﬁinctional categories with information content (IC) <5 than
the more speciﬁc GOs (p<2*10'16). In contrast, the genomic context
PP and CGN methods have higher overall performance for the more
speciﬁc GOs with IC25, in comparison to the more general GOs
(p=10'9 and p<2*10'16, respectively).

These broad trends notwithstanding, the predictive accuracy of in-
dividual methods varies widely even between GOs in the same do-
main and of similar information content (Fig. 2e,f, S2a,c). Important-
ly, such patterns are also to a great extent different between the indi-
vidual methods, and we next examine the comparative strengths and
weaknesses of each AFP method with regard to the speciﬁc GO
categories they predict.

Of note, the overall ability to predict GO ﬁll’lCthl’lS differs between
methods: BPS has the highest AUPRC out of the ﬁve methods for
33% of the 1,227 learnable GO terms, and PP in 25% of the GO terms
(example GO terms in Fig. S2d-g). Nevertheless, the other three
methods prove valuable when predictions for particular GO terms are
sought. For instance, TEP is the method with highest cross-validation
AUPRC scores for the ﬁinctions ‘tRNA aminoacylation for protein
translation’ and for ‘photosynthesis’ (Fig. 2h, S2b), and it exhibits
comparable overall performance to other methods across a set of other
GO terms (Fig. 2g; trends across GO terms for other methods visual-
ized in Fig. S2). Crucially, even two apparently equally performing
methods — exhibiting similar AUPRC for a GO term — may provide
complementary predictions in practice, assigning the ﬁinction to
disjoint sets of genes. We ﬁirther examine to what extent this occurs
and how can it be exploited to boost predictive power by combining

3.2 Method complementarity and prediction fusion

We quantiﬁed the complementarity of the ﬁve predictors described
above by testing the accuracy of combined predictions. In particular,
we evaluated ﬁve different ﬁlSlOl’l schemes in a cross-validation test
and additionally on the CAFA 2 benchmark that served as an inde-
pendent validation, while stratifying by GO domain and information
content (IC) of GO terms (Fig. 3, Fig. S3).

Overall, integration schemes perform substantially better than the
individual predictors, regardless of the GO term generality (Fig. 3a,b)
or of the GO domain analyzed (Fig. 3a,b; S3a-d). For example, the
AUPRC scores for the most speciﬁc (IC>10) GO terms range between
0.04 and 0.28 for the ﬁve individual predictors, and between 0.18 and
0.40 for the ﬁve ﬁlSlOl’l schemes (Fig. 3a, S3d). Therefore, the meth-
ods indeed do cover different sets of genes with their predictions,
raising the combined accuracy far above the individual methods.

With respect to strategies to integrate predictions, an appealing ap-
proach is to require that an annotation be made by more than one
independent methodology. Intuitively, enforcing consistency across
the methods should imply more conﬁdence in the call. We tested this
approach using ‘two votes’ and ‘three votes’ schemes that conserva-
tively annotate ﬁll’lCthl’lS only if supported in >1 predictor (Methods).
However, such schemes were routinely outperformed by the two
commonly employed ﬁlSlOl’l schemes (Fig. 3b, S3a-d) that integrate

the predictions across all methods using weights (‘weighted voting’
and ‘consensus’; Methods). These integration schemes allow the
overall result to stem only from a single conﬁdent prediction, even if
it is not consistent across individual methods. This motivated us to test
a simpliﬁed strategy where we simply take the prediction of the single
most conﬁdent model as the ﬁnal prediction (‘one vote’). Somewhat
counterintuitively, this approach appears to perform equally well to

the ‘weighted voting’ for the general GO terms (Fig. 3b, S3a-d), and
similarly well even for the more speciﬁc GO terms (Fig. 3b, S3c, d).
This observation can be explained by the very high complementarity
between the methods — if the majority of reliable annotations are
predicted only by a single method and there is little overlap, even
sophisticated methods to combine them will not improve much over
the ‘one vote’ approach, and might even be counterproductive in some
instances.

We ﬁirther reﬁned the ‘one vote’ scheme to ﬁrst compute Pr scores
separately for each of the ﬁve methods and then to take the highest Pr
score among the methods as an integrated prediction (‘best precision’
scheme; highlighted bar in Fig 3c). This implicitly incorporates infor-
mation, via Pr scores, on the accuracy of classiﬁers in making each
individual prediction. Such a scheme that considers only a single
prediction with highest Pr (or, equivalently, lowest FDR) performs
indistinguishany from the commonly ‘weighted voting’ scheme that
combines many classiﬁers (Fig. 3d; p=0.09, Wilcoxon signed-rank
test). Notably, a Pr-based weighted voting does not outperform the
‘best precision’ scheme either (Fig. 3e, p=0.45).

The results from cross-validation were ﬁirther validated on the E.
coli predictions from the CAFA 2 benchmark. Of note, the two tests
are on a rather different scale: cross-validation results are obtained
from multiple genomes (15,318 OGs) compared to a single benchmark
genome (70 genes). Furthermore, the number of GOs available for
testing is reduced from 713 to 232 in Biological process and 409 to
139 in Molecular ﬁinction domain. The choice of optimal strategy is
conﬁrmed on the largest ‘Biological process’ part of the benchmark:
the conservative ‘two votes’ and ‘three votes’ perform worse than the
other schemes. Moreover, weighted voting does not outperform the
simple ‘best precision’ scheme (Fig. 3c). In addition, all types of
integration are beneﬁcial since all schemes performed equally or
better than the best CAFA 2 competitor on the Biological process
domain (Fig. 3c). These trends are broadly conﬁrmed on Molecular
ﬁinction domain (Fig. S3c, d): best precision and consensus outper-
form other schemes and methods. In addition, these two schemes are
in the top 25% of the CAF A 2 competitors for the Molecular ﬁinction
E. coli benchmark (Fig. S3e).

The individual and integrated GO predictions for the complete set
of OGs and genes therein are available from http://gorbi.irb.hr/.

3.3 The tally and overlap of newly predicted functional
annotations

We examined the genomes of several model microorganisms in terms
of how many genes could be covered with novel GO predictions at a
certain Pr (or equivalently FDR) threshold, given a certain annotation
method or a ﬁlSlOl’l scheme to combine them (Fig. 4a, S4). The indi-
vidual methods could annotate roughly ~1/6 of the genes in the ge-
nomes at Pr250%, e.g., 9-19% for the different methods in E. coli and
8-16% for Staphylococcus aureus. Strikingly, using the combination
schemes can achieve at least twice the coverage at the same FDR (36-
43% and 28-34%, for E. coli and S. aureus, respectively). Alternative-
ly, combining classiﬁers can increase the precision while achieving
similar coverage as the individual methods. The various ﬁlSlOl’l
schemes perform similarly in this test, with the consensus and
weighted voting having an edge at very stringent (Pr290%) thresholds.
Of note, genes not included in OGs cannot be annotated in our setup
and contribute towards the uncovered part of the genome.

Next, we quantiﬁed overlaps between methods in terms of particu-
lar genes in model microorganisms that received predictions at various
Pr thresholds. We observe that the overlap is very low at high strin-
gency thresholds: at Pr290%, 98% genes that received any annotation
in E. coli did so only by a single method (Fig. 4b); this percentage is
100%, 99% and 96% for S. aureus (Fig. 4b), for Bacillus subtilis and
Streptomyces coelicolor (Fig. S5), respectively. However, as the
stringency is relaxed, the overlap between the covered genes increas-

es, where at Pr250% many of the same genes receive predictions from
multiple methods (Fig. 4b, Fig. S5, Table S1). Crucially, this does not
imply that the same GOs are assigned to those genes by the different
methods. Indeed, when quantifying the GO terms that were annotated
to at least one OG at Pr250%, we observe considerable differences
between methods: 36% of the GO terms are assigned to at least one
OG only by a single method, an additional 30% by two methods and
only 6% by all ﬁve methods (Table S2). The complementarity is also
evident (at any Pr threshold) in the increased number of GO terms
assigned to any one OG upon applying a scheme to combine the
annotations (Fig. S6). Overall, the high accuracy of the combined
predictors stems both from the complementary in gene ﬁinctions each
method can predict and in the sets of genes that it assigns a particular
gene ﬁinction to.

A part of newly predicted annotations can be validated using CAF A
2 E. coli benchmark and so can the overlap of the annotated GO terms
for particular genes. We searched for examples thereof, in terms of E.
coli genes that received validated annotations at Pr thresholds corre-
sponding to Fmax (Supplementary Methods). While the CAF A 2 E. coli
set is not large enough to quantitate the overlap between validated
predictions made by particular methods, we found individual exam-
ples that support the trends observed previously in cross-validation
tests. For instance, the ﬁ'uA / ﬁ'uB genes had received correct predic-
tions from multiple methods simultaneously, and the predictors for
assigned GO terms had low levels of complementarity in our analyses
(max. excess AUPRC=0.05; Fig. S7). On the other extreme, there are
multiple examples of pronounced complementarity for method-
speciﬁc GOs (max. excess AUPRC=0.39) correctly predicted for
genes but unreachable to other methods, e.g., EKM-speciﬁc to mobB,
TEP-speciﬁc to ung and BPS-speciﬁc to yciS (Fig. S7).

Next, we turn to address the issue of how well the genes are covered
by novel annotations using different methodologies. In particular, we
measure the total amount of information accretion (IA; Methods;
Clark and Radivojac, 2013) that was contributed by different predic-
tors. We estimate that the E. coli genome has on average 29.2
bits/gene of currently known ﬁinctional annotations spanning all three
GO domains (Fig. 4c). Of that, 8.7 bits/gene is assigned directly from
experimental data, and the other 15.4 bits/gene is assigned using the
commonly-applied electronic annotation methods, per the Uniprot-
GOA database (Camon et al., 2005); many of these annotations derive
ﬁom InterPro (Jones et al., 2014). We supplement this by a ﬁirther 5.1
bits/gene obtained by transferring GO annotations across OG groups
(by sequence similarity). Given that the GO electronic annotations are
of comparable quality to the manually curated annotations (Skunca et
al., 2012), they are used as input to our ﬁinction prediction algorithms.
At a permissive threshold of Pr25 0%, the individual prediction meth-
ods can assign between 2.8 bits (TEP) and 5.5 bits (BPS) for E. coli
genes, on average. Integrating the predictions raises this to a total of
11 bits/gene of newly predicted ﬁll’lCthl’lS (Fig. 4c, 'consensus'
scheme) at Pr250%. At a more stringent threshold of Pr270%, 3.9 new
bits/gene are still available (Fig. 4c, consensus). Interestingly, the
novel annotations apply similarly well to both the poorly and the well-
annotated E. coli genes (10.7 vs. 11.8 additional bits/gene for genes in
the lower vs. upper quartile by the known bits/gene; Fig. S9). This
suggests that there are still many undiscovered biological roles even in
the currently well-annotated genes. This trend is also observed con-

sistently across the three GO domains (Fig. S9). For instance, in
addition to the existing 108 bits of annotations to ftsI gene, we predict
a ﬁirther 23 bits, 13 of which were from the Molecular ﬁinction do-
main and the remainder from the other two domains. The trends above
hold also for other organisms, meaning that AFP methods can also
afford great gains in medically important microbes: S. aureus has 18.4
bits/gene of known annotations but 9.7 additional bits/ gene are readily
available from predictions; for Streptococcus pyogenes this is 20.8
plus 11.3 bits/gene, and for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Fig. S8) this
is 17.7 plus 8.2 bits/gene (all given at Pr25 0%).

Therefore, the established genome-based AFP methods can imme-
diately extend our knowledge of gene ﬁinction using current data. An
important question is also how much of this knowledge remains to be
gained in the ﬁiture, as more genomes are sequenced. We address this
by sampling from our ﬁlll set of 2,071 genomes and examining how
the accuracy changes with the number of available genome sequences.
Interestingly, for the most of the tested methods and integration
schemes, the average AUPRC scores increase approx. linearly with
the logarithm of the number of genomes. Some saturation is evident in
the individual methods with the current set of ~2000 genomes, par-
ticularly in the Cellular component GO domain (Fig. 5a, S10 and
Table S3). Crucially, the ﬁlSlOl’l schemes display very little saturation
in all but the very general GO terms (IC<5) of the Biological process
and Molecular ﬁinction domains; Fig. 5a, S10 and Table S3). In
summary, many AF P methodologies stand much to gain from increas-
es in size of genomic databases. Importantly, the integrated predic-
tions generally exhibit steeper slopes than individual classiﬁers (Fig.
5b). This suggests that with more genomes, the complementarities
between methods grow more pronounced and the relative beneﬁt of
integrating across many AF P methods increases.

4 DISCUSSION

Automated gene ﬁinction prediction is a necessity: the numbers of
sequenced genomes are growing rapidly, but the known ﬁinctional
annotations are not keeping up. The methods that transfer known
biological roles to homologous genes via sequence similarity searches
are well-established and appear quite SUCCCSSﬁll in community evalua-
tions (Hamp et al., 2013). Thus, they present a baseline that ﬁiture
methods must build and improve upon, aiming to provide predictions
complementary to the commonly employed methods such as PSI-Blast
or Pfam searches. To this end, we have evaluated ﬁve existing meth-
odologies that produce novel GO annotations from data orthogonal to
stande sequence similarity searches, while being based exclusively
on genome sequences. We ﬁnd that the methods are highly comple-
mentary: more than half (676/1,227) of examined GO ﬁll’lCthl’lS are
inaccessible to the majority of the AFP methods, but only to one or
two individual predictors. In particular, the protein sequence-based
methods tend to be more adept at capturing general GO terms and
those in the Molecular ﬁmction domain, while genomic context meth-
ods better capture the speciﬁc GO terms and the Biological process
GO domain. Thus, the output of various comparative genomics-based
AFP approaches needs to be combined to ﬁnd ﬁinctionally coherent
groups of genes.

We ﬁnd that, due to the pronounced complementarity, a simple yet
viable strategy for integrating predictions is to take the prediction of
the single most conﬁdent model, which performs similarly to
weighted voting schemes. Recent research in machine learning ex-
plored various classiﬁer combination techniques, concluding that the
simple late ﬁlSlOl’l schemes — not unlike the ones employed in this
work — can double the recall at high precision, if the near-
independence of feature families is properly exploited (Madani et al.,
2013). Consistently, our data also suggests that the beneﬁt gained

9mg ‘09 1sn8nV uo sejeﬁuV s01 ‘121u10111123 jo A1is19Aiuf1 112 /810's112umofpinXO'soi112u1101uioiq//:d11q 111011 popcorumoq

 

from applying and subsequently integrating multiple AF P methods
increases when a higher stringency of predictions is desired (Fig. 4b).
The scientiﬁc community has been painstakingly accumulating
knowledge about protein ﬁinction by performing experiments in
model organisms, such as E. coli, throughout the past decades. We
estimate that current knowledge — to the extent it can be described by
the GO and covered in the available databases — amounts to 29.2 bits
per E. coli gene, on average. The established AFP methods operating
only on genomic data, if combined properly, can increase this by a
ﬁirther 11 bits/gene. Finally, we showed that various integration
schemes proﬁt more than the individual methods from inclusion of
additional genomes, highlighting the increasing importance of consid-
ering multiple complementary genomic AF P methods in ﬁltqu work.

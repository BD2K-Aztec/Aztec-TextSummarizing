ABSTRACT

Motivation: In mammalian cells, many genes are silenced by genome
methylation. DNA methyltransferases and polycomb repressive com-
plexes, which both lack sequence-specific DNA-binding motifs, are
recruited by long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) to specific genomic
sites to methylate DNA and chromatin. Increasing evidence indicates
that many lncRNAs contain DNA-binding motifs that can bind to DNA
by forming RNA:DNA triplexes. The identification of lncRNA DNA-
binding motifs and binding sites is essential for deciphering lncRNA
functions and correct and erroneous genome methylation; however,
such identification is challenging because lncRNAs may contain thou-
sands of nucleotides. No computational analysis of typical lncRNAs
has been reported. Here, we report a computational method and pro-
gram (LongTarget) to predict lncRNA DNA-binding motifs and binding
sites. We used this program to analyse multiple antisense lncRNAs,
including those that control well-known imprinting clusters, and
obtained results agreeing with experimental observations and epigen-
etic marks. These results suggest that it is feasible to predict many
lncRNA DNA-binding motifs and binding sites genome-wide.

1 INTRODUCTION

In mammalian cells (especially differentiated somatic cells), many
genes are accurately silenced by DNA and chromatin methyla-
tion via DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and polycomb re-
pressive complexes (PRCs) (Lee, 2009). By contrast, in cancer
cells, genomic regions are often erroneously methylated or
demethylated (Gupta et al., 2010). Mammals have very limited
DNMT and PRC proteins, which lack sequence-speciﬁc DNA-
binding motifs (Simon and Kingston, 2013). Many long non-
coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have DNA- and protein-binding
motifs, allowing them to carry DNMTs and PRCs to speciﬁc
genomic sites (Lee, 2009; Tsai et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2008),
and lncRNAs can bind to DNA by forming RNAzDNA

triplexes. However, details of how lncRNAs bind to DNA tar-
gets are scarce.

Single-stranded RNAs that are rich in pyrimidines (T and C)
can bind to DNA strands that are rich in purines (A and G) by
Hoogsteen-type hydrogen binding to form RNAzDNA triplexes
(Morgan and Wells, 1968). In vitro studies have revealed at least
four types of RNAzDNA binding: (i) a pyrimidine-rich RNA
strand binds to a polypurine DNA strand by Hoogsteen base-
pairing; (ii) a purine-rich RNA strand binds to a polypurine
DNA strand by reverse Hoogsteen base-pairing; and (iii and iv)
an RNA strand that is rich in both purines and pyrimidines binds
to a polypurine DNA strand by either Hoogsteen or reverse
Hoogsteen base-pairing (Duca et al., 2008). Triplexes, however,
occur widely between RNAzRNA and RNAzDNA. A recent
study indicates that there should be additional non-canonical situ-
ations of Hoogsteen and reverse Hoogsteen base-pairing (Schmitz
et al., 2010). Given the huge number (>14 000) of human
lncRNAs (Derrien et al., 2012), the experimental identiﬁcation
of their DNA-binding motifs and binding sites is not feasible.

A computational program was reported to predict RNAzDNA
binding based on the above four canonical base-pairing rules and
was used to analyse a large set of short (mostly 30—50 bp), chro-
matin-associated RNAs (Buske et al., 2012). Compared with such
short non-coding RNAs, the prediction of lncRNA DNA-binding
motifs and binding sites is complicated by two factors and is much
more challenging. First, lncRNAs may contain thousands of nu-
cleotides and multiple functional motifs with featured sequences.
Second, a considerable number of lncRNAs, such as HOTAIR
(Rinn et al., 2007), function in trans and regulate remote genome
methylation, for which binding to their target regions is also con-
trolled by CTCF (Phillips and Corces, 2009). Here, we introduce a
computational method and program (LongTarget) to predict
lncRNA DNA-binding motifs and binding sites. We used this
program to analyse multiple antisense lncRNAs, including some
well-characterized lncRNAs that control gene imprinting. The
predicted binding motifs and binding sites exhibit signiﬁcant
sensitivity and speciﬁcity and agree with experimental observa-
tions. These lncRNAs bind not only to promoter regions and
CpG sites but also to many transposable elements.

2 METHODS

2.1 Base-pairing rule-sets

In addition to the four canonical base-pairings (Duca et al., 2008), add-
itional Hoogsteen and reverse Hoogsteen base-pairing have been

reported, making it necessary to inspect all of the potential base-pairing
rules. For example, an RNA strand can bind to a C-rich (instead of
purine-rich) DNA strand (Schmitz et al., 2010). Despite being enriched
in two nucleotides bound by nucleotides (such as T and C) in binding
motifs, most binding sites contain all four types of nucleotides (A, T, G
and C). To accurately examine diverse base-pairing between binding
motifs in lncRNAs and binding sites in DNA sequences, we collected
from intensive literature reviews potential base-pairing rules
(Supplementary Table S1) and combined them into 24 rule-sets
(Supplementary Table S2). A rule-set, such as ‘TA-U, AT-G, CG-G,
GC-U’, that accurately determines how ATGC in a binding site is
bound by U and G in a binding motif, describes RNAzDNA binding
more accurately than do two canonical rules such as ‘TA-U, CG-G’.

2.2 RNAzDNA triplexes

For a genomic region of interest (Fig. 1A), LongTarget constructs two
RNA strands for its plus and minus strand on each base-pairing rule-set
because a lncRNA may bind to either strand of the DNA duplex
(Fig. 1B). Thus, the predicted binding motifs and their binding sites

Fig. 1. Illustration of the method. (A) The input is an lncRNA and a
DNA sequence. (B) On the 24 rule-sets for the DNA sequence’s plus and
minus strands, 48 RNA strands (in blue) are constructed. (C) The
lncRNA is aligned to each constructed RNA strand; the aligned regions
in the lncRNA are TFOs and in the constructed RNA strands are TTSs.
(D) The triplexes that are generated by all of the TFOs and all of the rule-
sets are assorted to identify TFOl (the best TFO) and other TFOs. (E)
The DNA sequence is shufﬂed, or (F) the lncRNA sequence is shufﬂed,
after which the above steps are repeated for each pair of shufﬂed se-
quences. (G) Details of triplex assorting. All of the triplexes are handled
with their addresses in the lncRNA sequence. In the example, within the
range of offset (= 3), the midpoints (indicated by red dots) of the triplexes
(indicated by red lines) at B— l, B and B + l contribute an overlap value
(= 3 — l) to neighbours at B, B— l, B + l, and B; the midpoints (indicated
by blue dots) of triplexes (indicated by blue lines) at A—2, A and A + 2
contribute an overlap value (= 3 — 2) to neighbours at A, A— 2, A + 2 and
A (double arrows). After all of the triplexes are processed, the RNA
sequences in overlapping triplexes at close positions form consensus se-
quences. The position with the highest overlap value (at B, value = 4) is
chosen ﬁrst as the midpoint of TFOl, and triplexes with their midpoints
within the range of offset (shadowed in red) are clustered (and removed
after) as TFOl’s triplexes. Next, TF02 and its triplexes (shadowed in
blue) are determined on the second highest overlap value (at A, value = 2)
and removed. The remaining TFOs and their triplexes are determined
following the same steps

triplex-forming oligonucleotides and triplex target sites) as determined
by the rule-set in the lncRNA and in the two constructed RNA strands
have the same sequences. Because TFOs vary in length but are mutually
determined by their TTSs, we use [align in the fasta36 package (Goujon
et al., 2010) to align the lncRNA to each constructed RNA strand. Lalign
aligns a region in the lncRNA to all of the alignable regions in a con-
structed RNA strand, thus simultaneously identifying all of the TFOs and
all of the TTSs of each TFO (Fig. 1C).

2.3 Identify the best TFO and its TTSs

The existence of >14 000 lncRNAs in humans (Derrien et al., 2012) sug-
gests that each lncRNA should have a fairly speciﬁc function and that, if
it binds to DNA, it has a speciﬁc DNA-binding motif that may bind to
many genomic sites (Chu et al., 2011). The binding sites of a transcription
factor share a consensus sequence but show sequence variability. We
assume that, due to strong binding afﬁnity, a binding motif can bind to
its binding sites with a certain amount of mismatches, thereby generating
multiple triplexes at a binding site. Of all of the TFOs that are generated
by the 24 base-pairing rule-sets, TFOl (the best TFO) is determined,
without a pre-deﬁned length, by the consensus RNA sequence of triplexes
that are distributed most densely with a sufﬁciently high overlap at a
particular position in the lncRNA (triplexes, if in varied sequences, do
not reasonably indicate a TFO; Fig. 1G). We ﬁnd that TFOl generally
(but not always) generates much more triplexes than any other TFO (who
are visibly false positives, produce much fewer or poorly overlapped
triplexes and simply reﬂect the quality of TFOl; Figs 1G and 2).

To identify the triplexes that are distributed most densely with a suf-
ﬁciently high overlap at a particular position in a lncRNA, the
LongTarget processes all of the triplexes that are generated by all of
the rule-sets. For any two triplexes with midpoints within the range of
the parameter offset, the closer their midpoints are to each other, the
higher is the overlap value that they contribute to each other. After all
of the triplexes are processed, the position in the lncRNA with the highest
overlap value is chosen as the midpoint of TFOl, and the triplexes with
midpoints at both sides within the offset are clustered as TFOl’s triplexes
(Fig. 1G). When, very rarely, TFOl generates slightly fewer yet more
densely distributed triplexes than does TF02, LongTarget still treats
TFOl as the best TFO because the densely distributed overlapping tri-
plexes powerfully indicate a consensus sequence (and thus a true binding
motif). Statistically, the fewer the other TFOs and their triplexes, the

better TFOl is (Fig. 2). If TFOl’s triplexes are mainly generated by a
highly dominant rule-set, the result is more convincing. The maximum
number of overlapped triplexes and the enriched distribution of triplexes
in a region are two criteria for prediction of binding sites.

2.4 Stability of triplexes

In vitro RNAzDNA binding is relatively stable. Two datasets of triplex
stability, on the stability of different triplets (Supplementary Table S1),
are constructed. The default dataset is based on thermal stability
(Supplementary Table S1), and the other is based on observed instances
of RNA triplets (Abu Almakarem et al., 2012; Leontis et al., 2002).
LongTarget sums each triplet’s ability to obtain triplex stability. The
thermal stability of triplets with a mismatch or a gap is assumed zero.

Pyrimidine interruptions (especially successive Ts) in a polypurine
region reduce the binding stability (Kukreti et al., 1998; Orson et al.,
1999). The parameters T T penalty and CC penalty penalize TT and
CC, respectively. By default, —1000 is set for TT so that TT—containing
triplexes generate a negative stability value and are ﬁltered out. Because
two sub-triplexes that are separated by TT in a long triplex are still
reported if their stability exceeds the parameter mean stability and the
length exceeds the parameter minimal T FO length, T T penalty = —1000
simulates the effect of TT breaking a lncRNAzDNA bound as experi-
mentally observed. A small T T penalty reduces the TT—containing tri-
plexes’ stability. The CC is by default not penalized according to
experimental ﬁndings (Schmitz et al., 2010).

2.5 Sensitivity and speciﬁcity

Because lncRNAs may contain thousands of nucleotides, multiple TFOs
are usually reported, especially when lncRNAs are examined against mul-
tiple rule-sets. Normally, other TFOs except for TFOl are obvious false
positives because they generate much fewer and poorly overlapped tri-
plexes (Fig. 2) and, therefore, do not affect the prediction. To rigorously
evaluate the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of TFOl and its TTSs, LongTarget
shufﬂes the lncRNA or DNA sequence and repeats the prediction for
each pair of shufﬂed sequences (Fig. 1E and F). This permutation test
examines whether a predicted TFOl and its TTSs would occur by chance.
The program shuﬂle at eyegene.ophthy.med.umich.edu/shufﬂe/was used
(with the default parameters 100 simulations, TRUE_RANDOM) to
shufﬂe the lncRNA and DNA sequences without substituting any nu-
cleotide. This program uses a high-quality random number generator
with a period greater than 2 X 1018 and performs better than the program
shuﬂle at www.bioinformatics.org. The program Random DNA Sequence
at www.bioinformatics.org was used to generate random DNA sequences
(maximally 10 000 bp).

2.6 Input, output and parameters

LongTarget accepts a pair of lncRNA and DNA sequences as input and
outputs nine ﬁles, including a list of sorted TFOs and their triplexes, a ﬁle
reporting permutation test result, a ﬁle reporting simple statistics of
TFOl, TF02 and TFO3 and six ﬁles describing the TTS positions that
are generated by TFOl and TF02. There are eight parameters (with
default values): T T penalty (—1000), CC penalty (0), mean stability (1.0),
alignment identity (0.6), minimal T FO length (20 bp), sequence shuﬂle (not
shufﬂe), shufﬂe times (0) and offset (10). The ﬁrst ﬁve parameters are for
ﬁltering triplexes on user-deﬁned conditions, sequence shuffle and shuﬂle
times are for permutation test, and offset constrains distances between the
triplex midpoints to control their overlap for sorting triplexes (Fig. 1G).
The default parameters -n -r +5/—4 -f 12 -g 4 -E 10 -m 0 for lalign are
used. -n, -r (+5/—4), -f (12), and —g (4) indicate nucleotide sequences,
substitution scoring matrices, gap open penalty and gap extension pen-
alty, respectively; -E controls the maximum number of times that the

match is expected to occur by chance; and -m controls the output
format (www.cbi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/lalign/).

2.7 Gene and genome sequences

For a lncRNA that has multiple transcripts, we used the transcript that
contains all of the exons as input, or when such a transcript was lacking,
we assembled all of the exons into a sequence as the input. To obtain
lncRNA target regions in humans and mice, the human genome hg19 and
the mouse genome mm9 were used. Unless speciﬁcally mentioned, the
lncRNAs and DNA sequences are in the human genome.

3 RESULTS

There are two classes of lncRNAs. One class locates near and
antisense to the genes they regulate; a typical example is ANRIL
(CDKN2B-AS), which regulates the expression of CDKN2A/
ARF/CDKN2B (Kotake et al., 2011). An antisense lncRNA
may silence nearby genes if its transcript fully or partially over-
laps with these genes, but many lncRNAs, including those con-
trolling imprinted gene clusters, function as long-range cis-
silencers to regulate non-overlapping genes (Pauler et al.,
2012). The second class comprises lncRNAs that are located
far from their target genes; the best known is HOTAIR, which
is located between HOXCll and HOXC12 on chromosome 12
and regulates the expression of multiple HOXD genes on
chromosome 2 (Rinn et al., 2007). Compared with antisense
lncRNAs, the targets of lncRNAs that function in trans are
poorly understood. The tertiary structures play an important
role in target site recognition for some lncRNAs (Engreitz
et al., 2013). At this stage, we used LongTarget to analyse mul-
tiple antisense lncRNAs and obtained results agreeing with ex-
perimental observations (Supplementary Results).

3.1 ANRIL

ANRIL, which was initially identiﬁed in a melanoma-neural
system tumour (Pasmant et al., 2007), regulates the expression
of the three cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN2A
(INK4a/pl6), ARF (p14) and CDKN2B (INK4b/p15) and is
involved in many tumourigenetic processes (Kotake et al.,
2011; Yu et al., 2008). ANRIL has 19 exons and is unique in
that it contains 10 transposable elements and exhibits two-stage
and Glade-speciﬁc evolution (He et al., 2013). ANRIL coincides
with higher levels of occupancy of EZH2, CBX7 and SUZl2
near the promoter region of CDKN2A (Supplementary Fig.
S1; Kotake et al., 2011; Yap et al., 2010), indicating that
ANRIL binds to and densely distributes at CDKN2A’s pro-
moter region. What remain unknown are ANRIL’s DNA-bind-
ing motif and binding rules.

First, to predict ANRIL’s binding motif and binding sites, we
examined the large genomic region at chr9:2l900000—22l40000
covering CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B. The 24 base-pairing rule-
sets generated 1236 triplexes that meet the default conditions of
‘mean stability>l.0, identity>0.6, minimal T FO length>20’.
Because only 2 triplexes of the 411 triplexes that were <40 bp
were generated by TFOl, we further ﬁltered the triplexes on the
condition ‘minimal T FO length>40’ and obtained 825 triplexes.
Of the 825 triplexes, TFOl generated 367 triplexes, of which 231
were generated by the dominant rule-set R12. The 367 triplexes

Fig. 3. The distribution of ANRIL’s TTSs in the region of CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B. Hereafter, TTS distributions are shown as custom tracks of the
UCSC Genome Browser. In this and the following ﬁgures, right of the lncRNA name, ‘(1)’ indicates TFOl, and the number above ‘0’ indicates the
maximal number of overlapped triplexes at an address in the region. In the lncRNA track, the peaks show triplexes, the shadowed blue and green bars
mark TTSs at the promoter regions and other sites, and the top central numbers are values of offset and minimal T FO length (separated by ‘-’). The
others are tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser, including signals of ENCODE Histone Modiﬁcation (Ram et al., 2011). The two insets in the right-
bottom corner show three TTSs with dense triplexes at transposable elements

were, on average, 68 bp and contained an average of 61% A
(adenine). By contrast, TF02 and TFO3 generated only eight
and six triplexes, respectively (Fig. 2). TFOl’s triplexes were
densely distributed at several TTSs in CDKN2A’s promoter re-
gions (Fig. 3), agreeing with the experimentally observed
H3K27m3 signal and the higher level occupancy of EZH2,
CBX7 and SUZl2 at this region (Supplementary Fig. S1)
(Kotake et al., 2011; Yap et al., 2010) and with the ﬁndings
that the methylation of the CDKN2A promoter causes
CDKN2A inactivation (Bian et al., 2002; Csepregi et al., 2010).
Three TTSs outside the promoter regions and characterized by
high peaks fall within transposable elements.

Second, to determine whether the predicted TFOl (centred at
ANRIL’s 3403 bp) on the CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B region
was mainly determined by triplexes at the CDKN2A promoter
region, we repeated the prediction using only CDKN2A’s pro-
moter region at chr9:2l990000—22005000. The same TFOl and
densely distributed triplexes at this region were obtained
(Fig. 4A), indicating that these triplexes mainly determined
T FOl in ANRIL.

Third, to evaluate the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of TFOl and
its TTSs, we repeated the prediction with ANRIL and the
15 000 bp promoter region that were shufﬂed 100 times, respect-
ively. When the 15 000 bp promoter region was shufﬂed, in every
case, TFOl generated few triplexes, indicating the high speciﬁcity
of the original TFOl’s TTSs (Fig. 5A). When ANRIL was
shufﬂed, in most cases, TFOl generated few triplexes, but in
three cases, TFOl in the 14th, 58th and 65th shufﬂed ANRIL
sequences generated many triplexes (Fig. 5B). Looking at these

three cases, we found that the three TFOls (which were centred
at 2465, 3260 and 739 bp) were also highly A-rich, and the dom-
inant rule-set was R12. Moreover, all three of these TFOls gen-
erated triplex distributions that were nearly identical to that
generated by the original ANRIL (Fig. 4B—D). Thus, the three
putative false positives of TFOl in shufﬂed sequences are actu-
ally true positives. Two additional rounds of permutation pro-
duced similar results (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results
indicate that whenever and wherever the A-rich TFO is formed
accidentally by shufﬂing ANRIL, the TFO generates triplexes at
the same genomic sites; whenever such an A-rich TFO is not
formed, other TFOs fail to generate triplexes at these genomic
sites. Thus, only speciﬁc A-rich TFOs can generate the experi-
mentally conﬁrmed TTSs at the CDKN2A promoter region.

Fourth, to further evaluate the speciﬁcity of ANRILzTTS
binding, we constructed two randomly generated DNA se-
quences (10000 bp). At 10 sites with intervals of 1000 bp, we
replaced 100 nucleotides with a sequence of 100 bp containing
a typical TSS on the minus strand. Running LongTarget with
ANRIL and the two artiﬁcial DNA sequences, we found that
ANRILzDNA binding occurred exactly at the 10 inserted sites
on the minus strand (Supplementary Fig. S3), further supporting
the speciﬁcity of TFOl’s TTS.

Finally, we determined whether the parameters of lalign would
inﬂuence the TFO and TTS prediction. The default parameters
in the fasta36 package for substitution scoring matrices, gap
open penalty and gap extension penalty suit most situations
(see Methods); we speciﬁcally examined the -E parameter. On
ANRIL and CDKN2A’s promoter region, the examination of

Fig. 5. Sensitivity and speciﬁcity of ANRIL’s TFOl and its TTSs. The
dots at point 1 denote the original ANRIL sequence + the original
CDKN2A promoter [in both (A, B)], at point 2—101 denote the original
ANRIL sequence + 100 shufﬂed CDKN2A promoter [in (A)] and 100
shufﬂed ANRIL sequences + the original CDKN2A promoter [in (B)].
At each point the blue and red dots denote the triplex number generated
by TFOl, and among which the triplex number generated by rule-set
R12. (A) When the CDKN2A promoter was shufﬂed, in every case
TFOl generated few triplexes. (B) When the ANRIL sequence was
shufﬂed, in three cases (at points 14, 58 and 65) TFOl generated consid-
erable triplexes, many of which were generated exactly by R12. In other
cases TFOl generated few triplexes

E = l, E = 10, E = 20 and E = 50 indicated that a large E value
generated more triplexes (and slightly more TFOs) than did a
small E value (Supplementary Fig. S4), and the same E (espe-
cially a large one) value may cause slightly different triplex num-
bers (Fig. 5). Despite these differences, in all the four cases, the
same TFOl was predicted, and its TTSs share the same distri-
bution pattern (Supplementary Fig. S4). The above results sug-
gest that ANRIL’s DNA-binding motif and binding sites at the
CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B region are predicted with satisfac-
tory reliability, sensitivity and speciﬁcity.

3.2 H19, Igf2-AS and Airn

anRNAs regulate the imprinting of many genes (imprinted
genes are always expressed from one parental allele). Most im-
printed genes are found in clusters that include multiple protein-
coding genes and at least one lncRNA (Barlow and Bartolomei,

2014; Ferguson-Smith, 2011). Igf2 is a well-characterized, pater-
nally imprinted gene that is controlled by the maternally ex-
pressed lncRNA H19 and a CTCF-binding site (Bell and
Felsenfeld, 2000). The human Igf2—H19 locus contains three dif-
ferentially methylated regions (DMRs): the Igf2 DMRO at Igf2’s
exons 2 and 3, the Igf2 DMR2 at Igf2’s exons 8 and 9 and the
H19 DMR ahead of Hl9’s exon 1 (Supplementary Fig. S6;
Boissonnas et al., 2010). Whether and how DMRs are targeted
by lncRNAs is unknown.

H19 functions in cis to repress the expression of Ins2 and Igf2
(Boissonnas et al., 2010). LongTarget predicted that Hl9’s TTSs
are located at multiple promoter regions of Igf2 (and of Ins2 and
Igf2-AS) (Fig. 6), which agrees well with the experimental ﬁnd-
ings. Impressively, in addition to Igf2’s multiple promoters,
Hl9’s TTSs were also predicted largely at the Igf2 DMRO and
the Igf2 DMR2, and the TTSs at the latter position are especially
strong (Fig. 6). The Igf2 locus also contains the antisense
lncRNA Igf2-AS whose function is unclear (Moore et al.,
1997). LongTarget predicted that Igf2-AS generates fewer tri-
plexes with a featured distribution at three positions at the Igf2
DMRO, the Igf2 DMR2 and a CpG site, suggesting that Igf2-AS
may be involved in the regulation of DMRs instead of the ex-
pression of Igf2. If Igf2-AS plays a signiﬁcant role, it may help
explain how the deletion of the H19 alone affects imprinting in
only some, but not all, tissues (Barlow and Bartolomei, 2014;
Schmidt et al., 1999).

Igf2r (the receptor of Igf2), Slc22a2 and Slc22a3 are imprinted,
maternally expressed genes that are controlled by another
lncRNA—the imprinted, paternally expressed Airn. Although
overlapping only with Igf2r in an antisense orientation, the ex-
pression of Airn is correlated with the repression of all the three
genes on the paternal allele (Sleutels et al., 2002). Airn accumu-
lates at the Slc22a3 promoter to silence in cis Slc22a2 and Slc22a3
by targeting the histone methyltransferase G9a to this region
(Nagano et al., 2008). A recent ﬁnding suggests that Airn silences
the imprinted Slc22a3 and Igf2r genes via different mechanisms
(Latos et al., 2012). Agreeing with these ﬁndings, LongTarget
predicted the TTSs of Airn at the promoter regions of Slc22a2,
Slc22a3 and Igf2r, overlapping with some CpG sites
(Supplementary Fig. S5).

Based on the experimentally uncovered mechanism, that is, the
imprinting of Igf2, Igf2r and related genes is controlled by
methylation at DMRs and at these genes’ promoter regions,

Fig. 6. The distribution of H19’s and Igf2-AS’s TTSs in the Igf2 imprinting cluster. Two TTSs were at two DMRs, one between Igf2’s exon 2 and exon 3

and the other mainly in Igf2’s exon 9

we conclude that LongTarget predicted the TTSs of H19, Igf2-
AS and Airn at reasonable sites, agreeing with the experimentally
revealed binding sites of these lncRNAs in the two imprinted
clusters.

3.3 Gnas-ASl (Nespas)

The Gnas cluster is another well-studied case of imprinting genes
and includes the protein-coding gene Gnas (Nesp) and the
lncRNAs Gnas-ASl (Nespas). A recent study in mice revealed
that when Nespas is present at a low level, the Nesp promoter is
unmethylated, indicating that Gnas-ASl negatively regulates
Nesp most likely by interacting with Nesp’s promoter
(Williamson et al., 2011).

We ﬁrst predicted human Gnas-ASl and identiﬁed the TTSs
exactly at Gnas’s multiple promoter regions (Fig. 7). Again,
some TTSs impressively match CpG sites and histone methyla-
tion marks. This result agrees with experimental ﬁndings
(Williamson et al., 2011). We next analysed mouse Gnas-ASl.
At this cluster in mouse, the TTSs of Gnas-AS were predicted
mainly at multiple promoter regions of Gnas, and considerable
TTSs matched transposable elements (Supplementary Fig. S7).

3.4 Kcnqlotl

The extraordinarily long (91 kb) lncRNA Kcnqlotl is important
for imprinting multiple genes in the large Kcnql cluster.
Kcnqlotl interacts with chromatin, with the H3K9- and
H3K27-speciﬁc histone methyltransferases G9a and the PRC2
complex (Pandey et al., 2008), and with DNMT (Mohammad
et al., 2010). In the large Kcnql cluster, impressively, the TTSs of
TFOl are distributed not only at promoter regions of nearby
genes, such as Kcnql, Cdknlc and Slc22al8, but also at pro-
moter regions of remote genes, such as Ascl2, Tspan32, Cd81
and Phlda2 (Fig. 8; Supplementary Fig. S8), agreeing with ex-
perimental ﬁndings (Pandey et al., 2008). Moreover, most of

these triplexes exceed 70 bp (Fig. 2). The identiﬁcation of TTSs
that were >70 bp and that were at promoter regions of so many
imprinted genes strongly indicates that this result is unlikely to
have been generated by chance.

Because Kcnqlotl is predicted to generate many long triplexes
at the promoter regions of eight genes, it is a good example for
determining whether the predicted TFOl and its TTS distribu-
tion are speciﬁc to parameters (particularly, to the conditions of
‘minimal T FO length>50, oﬂset = 15, identity: 06’). We re-
peated the prediction by separately setting ‘minimal T FO
length> 70’, ‘identity 2 0.7’, and ‘identity 2 0.8’ but maintaining
the other two conditions. Under the condition ‘minimal T FO
length>70’ and the condition ‘ia’entity20.7’, the same TFOl
and TTS distributions were obtained. Under the condition ‘ia’en-
tity20.8’, the same TFOl was obtained, but many TTSs dis-
appeared (Supplementary Fig. S8). We found that the same
TFOl under the conditions ‘ia’entitngﬁ’, ‘ia’entitngJ’ and
‘identity 3 0.8’ generated 41625, 5743 and 97 triplexes, respect-
ively. These results demonstrate two indications. First, the abun-
dant relatively shorter triplexes (50~70 bp) are not generated
randomly at TTSs. As long as oﬂset and minimal T FO length
are within reasonable ranges (not necessarily at the best values),
they contribute to identifying the best TFO and its TTSs.
Second, setting a very high identity does not safely improve the
prediction. As EZH2 and CBX7 exhibit higher levels of occu-
pancy at the promoter region of CDKN2A (Yap et al., 2010),
dense distributions of triplexes should be more important for
correctly identifying TTSs.

4 DISCUSSION

The prediction of lncRNAs’ DNA-binding motifs and binding
sites is important for uncovering the correct and aberrant
genome modiﬁcation. LongTarget is different from the reported

cluster. TTSs were predicted at the promoter regions of multiple imprinted

genes, including Asc12, Tspan32 and Cd81, which are located far from Kcnqlotl (Supplementary Fig. S8). Note that the H3K27me3 signals at this
region in the shown datasets are not as strong as the speciﬁc report (Pandey et al., 2008)

T riplexator in that it explores a wide range of base-pairing rules
(e.g. CG—A and GC-C in the dominant rule-set R12 for multiple
lncRNAs) instead of canonical ones, examines base-pairing be-
tween all nucleotides instead of enriched ones, determines the
single best TFO on the RNA sequences in triplexes that overlap

most densely in the lncRNA, determines the best TFO’s TTSs
upon dense distributions of triplexes in a genome region, and
evaluates the triplexes’ stability (Buske et al., 2012;

LongTarget

 

(Schmitz et al., 2010), it is necessary to include non-canonical
base-pairing rules. The inclusion of these rules in LongTarget is
harmless if these rules do not generate signiﬁcant triplexes but is
significant in some case. Because on these rule-sets a nucleotide
in a TFO can bind to two different nucleotides in a TTS; TTSs
are structurally more complex and informative than are TFOs,
which may explain why ANRIL’s TTSs are more sensitive to
sequence shufﬂing than its TFOl. The permutation tests of
ANRIL and the quality of other lncRNA TFOl (Fig. 2) indicate
that TFOl and its TTSs have a high sensitivity and specificity.
The analysis of these lncRNAs suggests that it is feasible to pre-
dict many lncRNA TFOs and TTSs.

Consistent with experimental evidence, most of the predicted
TTSs of lncRNAs are at promoter regions of nearby genes and at
CpG sites. Examined with signals of ENCODE Histone
Modification in the UCSC Genome Browser, these TTSs
match well with EZH2, SUZl2 and H3K4m3 signals but
poorly with H3K27m3 and H3K9m3 signals in many cells.
This poor match can be explained by four reasons. First, the
detected H3K27m3 signals may be low in some experiments
but high in others (Pandey et al., 2008). Second, lncRNAs,
such as Kcnqlotl, and PRC proteins may have preferred
target sites from where they most likely spread to neighbouring
imprinted genes (Pandey et al., 2008), making sites of H3K27m3
signals different from and broader than TTSs. Third, the expres-
sion levels of lncRNA are low; therefore, the amount of tran-
scripts is likely insufficient for them to bind to the broad
H3K27m3 domains. Fourth, in some situations, lncRNAs inter-
act with methylated histone H3 lysine 27 (Yap et al., 2010), sug-
gesting that H3K27m3 signals may exist as a condition for a
lncRNA to bind to DNA. It is interesting that many TTSs per-
fectly match strong H3K4m3 or H3K27Ac signals, which indi-
cate active chromatin and occur in many gene promoter regions,
and some TTSs occur at the gap in high level H3K4 and H3K27
signals (Fig. 8, Supplementary Fig. S15). Because in many data-
sets, both H3K4m3/H3K27Ac signals and H3K9m3/H3K27m3
signals exist at a genomic site, the TTSs at sites with strong
H3K4m3 and H3K27Ac signals are sensible, and it is possible
that such sites can be competitively bound by lncRNAs of dif-
ferent regulatory functions.

Technically, when predicting a lncRNA TFOl and TTSs,
three issues should be considered. First, the default minimal
T FO length = 20 is rather small. While this value ensures that
no important triplexes would be filtered out, it increases the
chance of generating a bad TFOl because RNA sequences in
short triplexes are prone to generate more dense distributions in
the lncRNA. A large value (minimal T FO length>70) shares the
same risk because it filters out too many triplexes. It is advisable
to try a small and a large minimal T FO length and to determine
whether TFOl is different or whether the number of its triplexes
is significantly changed. Normally, minimal T FO length = 40 or
50 and oﬂset = 10 or 15. Second, we determined whether filter-
ing the triplexes with a large identity would improve the quality
of TFOl and found that identity = 0.7 may help, but iden-
tity = 0.8 does not, indicating that lncRNA:DNA triplexes
may enjoy a high binding affinity but not accurate base-pairing
between all nucleotides. Third, while most lncRNA TFO2s are
negligible, some lncRNA TFO2s generate considerable triplexes.

Whether some lncRNAs could use two motifs to bind to DNA
sequences is an interesting and unresolved issue.

Promoter regions, CpG sites and DMRs are known targets of
genome modification (Barlow and Bartolomei, 2014; Ferguson-
Smith, 2011); the predicted TTSs of lncRNAs at these positions
indicate that they are direct targets of lncRNAs. Transposable
elements inserted into the introns of functional genes can reduce
the transcription of those genes. Because considerable TTSs are
at transposable elements, we postulate that after targeting by
lncRNAs, the methylation of these transposable elements may
hinder the transcription of genes and that because many lncRNA
genes contain multiple transposable elements (He et al., 2013;
Kelley and Rinn, 2012), the TTSs at transposable elements in
lncRNAs help control the highly tissue-specific expression of
lncRNAs. Because most lncRNAs emerge in mammals, beyond
the hypothesis that X-inactivation and gene imprinting may have
co-evolved in mammals (Reik and Lewis, 2005), imprinting in
somatic cells as a genome defence against transposable elements
and as a mechanism regulating gene expression may also have an
associated origin and evolution.

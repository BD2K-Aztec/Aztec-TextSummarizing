ABSTRACT

Motivation: Several types of studies, including genome-wide associ-
ation studies and RNA interference screens, strive to link genes to
diseases. Although these approaches have had some success, gen-
etic variants are often only present in a small subset of the population,
and screens are noisy with low overlap between experiments in dif-
ferent labs. Neither provides a mechanistic model explaining how
identified genes impact the disease of interest or the dynamics of
the pathways those genes regulate. Such mechanistic models could
be used to accurately predict downstream effects of knocking down
pathway members and allow comprehensive exploration of the effects
of targeting pairs or higher-order combinations of genes.

Results: We developed methods to model the activation of signaling
and dynamic regulatory networks involved in disease progression. Our
model, SDREM, integrates static and time series data to link proteins
and the pathways they regulate in these networks. SDREM uses prior
information about proteins’ likelihood of involvement in a disease
(e.g. from screens) to improve the quality of the predicted signaling
pathways. We used our algorithms to study the human immune re-
sponse to H1N1 influenza infection. The resulting networks correctly
identified many of the known pathways and transcriptional regulators
of this disease. Furthermore, they accurately predict RNA interference
effects and can be used to infer genetic interactions, greatly improving
over other methods suggested for this task. Applying our method to
the more pathogenic H5N1 influenza allowed us to identify several
strain-specific targets of this infection.

1 INTRODUCTION

A wide variety of experimental and computational approaches
have been used over the past few years to screen for genes that
play important roles in human disease. These include RNA inter-
ference (RNAi) screens (Mohr et al., 2010), which knock down
human genes to quantify the phenotypic effects in diseases such
as HIV (Brass et al., 2008) and inﬂuenza (Brass et al., 2009;
Karlas et al., 2010; Konig et al., 2010) infection, and genome-
wide association studies (GWAS), a powerful approach for un-
covering strong connections between genetic variations such as
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and disease traits
(Altshuler et al., 2008).

Although these and similar sequencing-based methods have
been widely applied and were able to identify many relevant
genes, they also suffer from important drawbacks that limit

their effectiveness. RNAi screen hits are often not reproducible
among different labs and experimental settings. For example, the
overlap among hits in HIV screens is low. Three genome-wide
screens identified 842 genes that impact HIV replication, but
only three genes were common to all screens (Bushman et al.,
2009). Similar low overlap is observed for other diseases as well
(Stertz and Shaw, 2011). Interpretability of screen hits remains a
challenge, as the screens cannot explain why a gene impacts a
disease. Similarly, interpretation of GWAS hits is not straight-
forward as they oftentimes lie outside of coding regions of the
genome (Schaub et al., 2012). Even those variants lying within a
coding region only explain a small fraction of affected individ-
uals for several diseases and conditions (Maher, 2008).

These observations motivated methods that integrate GWAS
or perturbation information with functional annotations and
other types of genomic data (most notably gene expression and
protein interaction data). For example, pathway-based GWAS
Wang et al., 2010) maps SNP P—values to proximal genes and
links pathways to diseases by testing whether any predefined
pathways are enriched for genes that ﬂank signiﬁcant SNPs.
However, this and similar strategies are dependent on the quality
of the annotated pathways preventing their use for important
diseases that are poorly represented in public pathway databases
Wang et al., 2010).

A variety of gene prioritization algorithms, which have been
extensively reviewed (Moreau and Tranchevent, 2012; Piro and
Di Cunto, 2012) and benchmarked (Bornigen et al., 2012), use
known disease genes from literature curation, GWAS or other
sources as seeds to search for similar genes that are likely to be
related to the same disease. The evidence used to define gene
similarity includes text mining, pathway membership, functional
annotations, protein properties, sequence, co-expression and
proximity in protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks.
However, these methods do not attempt to mechanistically
model the pathways that are activated during disease progression
and response and thus do not provide a model to explain the
various observations. Instead, they use a “black box’ approach;
they take seed genes as input and produce a ranked list of can-
didate genes without explaining the predicted relationship to the
disease, which may impair further analysis (Moreau and
Tranchevent, 2012).

Other algorithms use perturbation and genetic data to link
proteins to diseases, while at the same time using other genomic
datasets and interaction networks to suggest how these proteins
may be involved in disease response (Huang and Fraenkel, 2009;
Kim et al., 2011; Ourfali et al., 2007; Tuncbag et al., 2013; Yeang
et al., 2004; Yeger-Lotem et al., 2009) However, these methods
have only used static models so far. In such models, the pheno-
typic outcomes of the network perturbations (or genetic variants)
are typically differentially expressed genes. The algorithms then

connect possible disease sources (for example, genetic variants,
perturbed genes, receptors or proteins that directly interact with
a pathogen) with the differentially expressed genes and use the
resulting source—target pathways to explain the role various pro-
teins play in the disease response.

Static models ignore the dynamic nature of responses and the
temporal changes in active genes and pathways. Indeed, many
transcriptional studies of disease highlight the importance of the
temporal aspects, for example, the rapid immune response follow-
ing infection (Li et al., 2011; Shapira et al., 2009) and longitudinal
clinical studies (Desai et al., 2011). Static modeling of dynamic
interactions aggregates several different pathways at once, which
leads to missing key factors that are only active at speciﬁc times
during response (Ernst et al., 2007). In addition, many static al-
gorithms do not attempt to infer the directionality of the edges on
the pathways despite the importance of edge orientation in cor-
rectly representing signaling paths (Gitter et al., 2011).

To address these issues, we developed the Signaling and
Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (SDREM) (Gitter et al.,
2013). SDREM combines an input—output hidden Markov
model (IOHMM) (Bengio and Frasconi, 1995) with a combina-
torial optimization algorithm to reconstruct dynamic models of
the signaling and regulatory networks using high-throughput
data including PPI, transcription factor (TF) binding and time
series gene expression data. The signaling pathways inferred by
SDREM are directed cascades that connect sources and target
TFs. These TFs are in turn used as part of the reconstructed
dynamic regulatory network to explain the temporal gene expres-
sion. SDREM was developed and tested on yeast and was shown
to accurately reconstruct yeast stress response networks leading
to new insights into the speciﬁc pathways controlling such re-
sponses (Gitter et al., 2013).

Although SDREM was successfully applied to model organ-
isms, the application to human disease remained a challenge. The
larger scale of the human interaction network makes search and
inference much more complicated. In addition, several data
sources available for studying diseases (including RNAi screens
and GWAS data) were not used by the original SDREM algo-
rithm. Finally, human networks are more complex and involve
extensive redundant parallel pathways (Logue and Morrison,
2012), which means that new methods are required to assess
the ability of proteins and combinations of proteins to affect
disease progression.

Here we present new computational methods that extend
SDREM by designing a new target function that uses prior
node (protein) information, developing new optimization meth-
ods for searching large networks and creating new gene ranking
metrics based on target connectivity as a post-processing step.
Combined, these extensions allowed us to apply SDREM to
study human response to inﬂuenza A viral infection. The result-
ing networks identiﬁed several key proteins and pathways known
to be involved in H1N1 inﬂuenza response and predicted novel
targets as well. To comprehensively test our method’s ability to
identify potential drug targets, we used the reconstructed net-
works to predict the results of RNAi screens demonstrating
that SDREM can make accurate predictions regarding such po-
tential targets. SDREM correctly predicts more RNAi screen
hits than top genome-wide gene prioritization algorithms, and
its predictions are better suited for experimental validation

because they are placed in the context of inﬂuenza-speciﬁc path-
ways. We also used SDREM to predict genetic interactions that
can lead to reduced viral load. Finally, we used SDREM to study
the more lethal H5N1 inﬂuenza. Comparing the networks con-
structed for H1N1 and H5N1 allowed us to predict genes that
are uniquely involved in H5N1 response, shedding light on the
speciﬁc characteristics of this infection.

2 METHODS
2.1 SDREM: Signaling and Dynamic Regulatory Events
Miner

SDREM (Gitter et al., 2013) links the two core components of the cellular
response to an external infection or treatment: signaling cascades and
transcriptional regulation. To reconstruct such models, SDREM starts
with the upstream proteins that detect the invading pathogen and deter-
mines signaling pathways that allow such proteins to communicate with
downstream TFs. The activated TFs coordinate changes in the expression
of their bound genes, which allows the cell to adapt to the new condition.
SDREM integrates general TF binding data and PPI network informa-
tion with condition-speciﬁc time series gene expression data to build such
models.

To ﬁnd TFs that are end points of the signaling pathways initiated by
the upstream proteins and responsible for the observed temporal tran-
scriptional changes SDREM iteratively combines two computational
modules. For the regulatory part of the model, SDREM uses an
IOHMM to analyze time series expression proﬁles and identify split
events—places in the time series where a group of co-expressed genes
starts to diverge (Ernst et al., 2007). These split events are annotated
with TFs that are predicted to control them allowing the method to
assign temporal information to the (static) TF—gene interaction data.

Using the putative active TFs predicted for various splits, SDREM
assesses the likelihood that each of these TFs is indeed responding to the
infection or treatment. A TE that is not well-connected to the upstream
source proteins in the signaling network is unlikely to be a major driver of
the transcriptional response. To search for such connections, SDREM
enumerates all possible depth-bounded paths from the sources to the TFs
in the undirected PPI network. Next, SDREM orients the PPI network
forcing information to ﬂow along each edge in a single direction (Gitter
et al., 2011). To ﬁnd the optimal orientation SDREM maximizes the
following combinatorial function:

21mm) (1)

peP
where P is the set of all unique depth-bounded paths between sources and
TFs, 15(1)) is an indicator function that has the value 1 if path p is satisﬁed
and w(p) is the path weight. A satisﬁed path is a path in which all of the
edges have been oriented such that the TF is reachable from the source.
Our initial edge orientation analysis (Gitter et al., 2011) used only edge
conﬁdence to weight paths, which in practice reduced w(p) to

we) = H woe) <2)
eep

where p is a source—target path and e is an edge on the path. Edge weights
w(e) depend on our conﬁdence that a speciﬁc interaction exists
(Supplementary Table S1) so that more conﬁdent pathways have
higher weights (Gitter et al., 2011).

SDREM uses the source-TE pathways in the oriented network to
quantify how well the putative active TFs are connected to the sources.
This information is fed back into the temporal gene expression analysis
and SDREM’s two stages (IOHMM and network orientation) iterate for
a ﬁxed number of rounds. In all rounds (except for the ﬁrst when path-
ways have not yet been learned), the IOHMM incorporates a prior that
represents the likelihood each TF is activated by the signaling pathways

predicted in the previous round. In addition, the pathways can be used to
identify other proteins (not TFs) that are involved in many high-weight
satisﬁed paths and therefore important to the response.

As mentioned above, we previously used SDREM to study yeast stress
response. Conceptually, SDREM is a general algorithm and can be read-
ily applied to other organisms as well. However, when attempting to use it
to model human disease response we faced several new computational
challenges. First, the complexity of the human interaction networks
means that SDREM’s search algorithm would be too time-consuming
and thus required specialized approaches to improve the runtime and
accuracy. Second, while in yeast we relied only on edge and target con-
ﬁdence to identify high-scoring pathways, human data provides informa-
tion about the nodes (proteins) as well leading to a new objective function
for ﬁnding well-connected TFs. Finally, identifying key signaling proteins
by determining their involvement in high-scoring pathways, as was done
for yeast, may be less important for the human network. Instead, to
identify potential drug targets, we would like to develop methods that
can automatically determine the effects of single or double knockdowns
on the ability of human cells to respond to infection or treatment. Below
we discuss the new computational methods we developed to address these
Issues.

2.2 Algorithm parallelization and source—target pathway
approximations

We explored several avenues for speeding up the computation required to
reconstruct the human signaling networks. Although it is challenging to
parallelize the orientation step (because local changes in edge direction
may affect other edges in different parts of the network) other aspects of
the algorithm could be parallelized including the randomization tests to
assess TF connectivity scores and the initial depth-ﬁrst search.

However, these and other precomputing steps (Supplementary
Information) do not reduce the time it takes to orient the network. The
Maximum Edge Orientation problem is NP-hard (Gitter et al., 2011) and
we already solve it using a heuristic approach, suggesting that a further
approximation may not negatively impact our results. We thus modiﬁed
the parallel path enumeration algorithm to only store the top m paths
from any source to any TF in our dataset, ranking the paths by path
weight. Considering only the top m paths also enables us to include early
termination in the depth-ﬁrst search’s branch traversal, further reducing
runtime. Evaluating the objective function requires summing the weights
of all satisﬁed paths, and for every potential edge ﬂip that is considered
during greedy local search we must determine which paths are still satis-
ﬁed. We now approximate the calculation of the orientation objective
function by only examining these top m undirected paths. In test
cases with millions of potential paths, the correlation between the node
scores obtained using the exact objective and those obtained with the
approximated objective when only using m = 100 000 was >0.999
(Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). Therefore, we set m = 100 000 for
our H1N1 and H5N1 analysis.

2.3 Incorporating RNAi screens

When modeling human response, we can sometimes use additional
sources of information regarding the involvement of a speciﬁc protein.
Although in the original SDREM formulation (Gitter et al., 2013) all
proteins were assumed to have the same likelihood of participating in the
response pathways, information such as knockdown phenotypic effects or
GWAS data can increase our prior belief that a protein participates in
one of the response pathways. To capture such information, we can
modify the target function discussed above (Equation 2) to incorporate
node priors as follows:

we) = w<r)1‘[w<v)1'[w<e) <3)

vep eep

where p is a source—target path, I is the target on that path, v is a vertex
on the path, e is an edge on the path and the function w(>1<) is the edge
conﬁdence or node prior. Equation 3 attempts to ﬁnd paths that contain
proteins that are likely involved in the response based on the screen data
as well as highly reliable protein interactions. Because the optimization
function in Equation 2 is NP-hard (Gitter et al., 2011), the target
function in Equation 3 is also NP-hard and the heuristic we used to
solve the original (edge only) function can be applied to this formulation
as well.

Using prior information regarding protein involvement also helps us
better resolve edge orientation in the signaling networks. Owing to the
larger PPI and regulatory networks for human data, there are many more
possible connections from sources to targets and disagreements about the
orientation of individual PPI in human models. A gene that is associated
with a phenotypic change in an RNAi screen leads to higher weights for
the (directed) pathways in which it is contained; thus, these are preferred
during the network orientation. Due to pathway redundancy, the con-
verse is not necessarily true. Genes that are negative screen hits may still
be highly relevant to signaling pathways.

Although related approaches use the screen hits directly as sources in
the network (Y eger-Lotem et al., 2009), we place less trust in the RNAi
data. Independent RNAi screens can exhibit low overlap (Bushman et al.,
2009; Stertz and Shaw, 2011) in part owing to the impact of differences in
methodology or cell population context (Snijder et al., 2012). Supplemen-
tary Table S2 demonstrates this disagreement for RNAi screens for
H1N1 inﬂuenza infection. No genes are hits in all ﬁve screens, and
only a single gene is detected in four of the ﬁve screens [note that two
of the screens (Bortz et al., 2011; Shapira et al., 2009) are targeted, not
genome-wide].

Thus, to derive a prior based on screen results, we convert the RNAi
data into vertex weights as follows:

l—(l—c)", ifn>0
w(v)={

0.5, otherwise

(4)

where w(v) is the weight assigned to a vertex (gene), c is the conﬁdence in
the screen in the range [0, 1] and n is the number of screens that report v
as a hit. We set c = 0.75 in all analyses here but could incorporate bio-
logical knowledge to set different conﬁdence levels for different screens.
These node priors are used directly in the formula for path weights [w(v)
in Equation 3] so that paths containing many screen hits have higher
weights.

2.4 Predicting RNAi effects

To predict RNAi screen hits for new conditions, we developed methods
to estimate the in Silica effects of removing a protein from the signaling
network component of an SDREM model. Instead of directly linking the
sources and differentially expressed genes, we compute how the connect-
ivity to the TFs is affected when a node is removed. This allows us to
leverage the fact that each key TF affects many genes (often hundreds) so
blocking access to such TFs signiﬁcantly impacts the cell’s ability to
mount an effective response. We devised several scoring metrics to
quantify the effect of node deletion on the targets. These metrics vary
along three lines: (i) All versus T 0p denotes whether all satisﬁed paths or
only the top-ranked paths are used to calculate change in connectivity.
(ii) Source—target Pairs versus Targets determines whether a target’s
connectivity is evaluated separately for every source (i.e. each source ac-
tivates a target differently) or if a target is considered to be disconnected
only when it is no longer reachable from any source (i.e. any source
can activate the target). (iii) Weighted versus Unweighted speciﬁes if
connectivity is treated in a binary (connected or disconnected) or con-
tinuous (fraction of connectivity remaining) fashion. The score for the

where A is the deleted node, T is the set of all targets, P(t) is the set of
paths to the target I to be considered (depending on the choice of All
versus Top and Pairs versus Targets), w(p) is the path weight, I(>1<) is an
indicator function and N(p) is the set of nodes on the path. The Pairs
option replaces the summation over targets by a double summation over
sources and targets and updates the denominator accordingly. Intuitively,
this score is the fraction of path weight that exists along paths that can
still activate t after A is deleted averaged across all targets. The un-
weighted score, which reﬂects the fraction of targets that are still reach-
able after removing node A, is

2.5 Predicting genetic interactions

Although screen hits for individual genes are often noisy, higher-order
knockdowns (of two or more genes) may prove to be more robust
because they can target several pathways simultaneously. However, ex-
perimentally testing all possible combinations, even for pairwise inter-
actions, is not feasible given the large number of human genes. Our
method provides a viable alternative: rather than performing an experi-
mental screen, perform in Silica knockdowns of all pairwise combinations,
score each pair and then only experimentally test the top-ranking pairs.

To derive a score for pairwise knockdowns, we mimicked experimental
studies of genetic interactions in yeast (Collins et al., 2010; Jonikas et al.,
2009; Tong et al., 2004). Initial work classiﬁed gene pairs as either inter-
acting or not with less emphasis on the strength of the interaction (Tong
et al., 2004). More recent work has focused on quantifying genetic inter-
actions on a continuous scale.

where 6,413 is the interaction between genes A and B and PAB is the
phenotype when both A and B are deleted (Collins et al., 2010).
Typically the expected phenotype is deﬁned as the product of the pheno-
types observed in the individual single deletions

Using this deﬁnition, negative interactions, the type we are primarily
interested in because they indicate the pair blocks disease-related pheno-
types, occur when the double knockdown has a stronger effect than ex-
pected because stronger effects correspond to lower values of Pﬁmd.

In yeast experimental work, colony size is a typical phenotype (Collins
et al., 2010; Tong et al., 2004) because it approximates growth rate, but
other possibilities exist (J onikas et al., 2009). Single human knockdown
screens often use viral load as the phenotype (Konig et al., 2010). In our
simulations, the score deﬁned in Equation 5 is the in Silica phenotype
P‘jlbserved. Similar to colony size and viral load, in our scoring function,
more signiﬁcant deletions result in lower values, and it is meaningful to
take the product of the scores from two individual deletions. To calculate
PSBSCWCd, we generalized Equation 5 to consider the simultaneous removal
of two nodes from the signaling network.

2.6 Data

The interaction network contained PPI from BioGRID (Stark et al.,
2006), post-translational modiﬁcations and PPI from the Human
Protein Reference Database (Mishra et al., 2006) and TF-gene binding
predictions (Ernst et al., 2010) that were processed as described in (Schulz
et al., 2012) (Supplementary Information). The H1N1 data consisted of
temporal gene expression (10 time points) (Shapira et al., 2009), ﬁve
RNAi screens (Bortz et al., 2011; Brass et al., 2009; Karlas et al., 2010;
Konig et al., 2010; Shapira et al., 2009) and 204 source proteins that
detect inﬂuenza infection or directly interact with inﬂuenza proteins
(Supplementary Table S3). Similarly, for H5N1, we collected temporal
expression data (six time points) (Li et al., 2011), one small-scale RNAi
screen (Bortz et al., 2011) and 41 sources (Supplementary Table S4).
Source proteins were compiled from the VirHostNet database (Navratil
et al., 2009), large-scale host—pathogen PPI studies (Shapira et al., 2009;
Tafforeau et al., 2011) and the literature (Supplementary Information).

We set all of SDREM’s parameters to their default values (Gitter et al.,
2013) except the number of top-ranked paths used to score nodes and
targets, which we set to 1000.

2.7 Gene prioritization algorithms

To benchmark SDREM’s ability to predict H1N1 RNAi screen effects,
we tested two genome-wide gene prioritization algorithms, Endeavour
(Aerts et al., 2006; Tranchevent et al., 2008) and Pinta (Nitsch et al.,
2009, 2011). Endeavour ranks genes using many lines of evidence such
as functional annotations, gene expression, interaction networks, text
mining and sequence similarity and combines the individual rankings to
create a global prioritization. Pinta is designed for diseases where a set of
seed genes is not available but there are differential gene expression data
between healthy and diseased individuals. It ranks genes based on the
expression levels of their neighbors in an interaction network. The human
proteins that interact with H1N1 proteins and differentially expressed
genes were provided as input to both Endeavour and Pinta. We used
EDGE (Leek et al., 2006) to identify signiﬁcantly differentially expressed
genes by comparing the mock treatment and viral treatment time courses
and using 500 null iterations. Endeavour does not use weights on the
input genes so we provided the sources and all genes that had the most
signiﬁcant q-value from EDGE (1.64 E-6). We performed a genome-wide
ranking using all lines of evidence. For Pinta the weight of a gene was
— log10(q—value), and all genes were used as input. Sources were given the
same weight as the most signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes. All
default settings were used.

3 RESULTS

Pathogens infecting cells provide a clear set of sources that ini-
tiate the subsequent signaling and transcriptional response. In
particular, many viruses encode only a small number of proteins
allowing us to generate speciﬁc models for the host response that
is triggered by host proteins that detect viral RNA or interact
with viral proteins.

To test SDREM’s application to such responses, we focus on
inﬂuenza A viruses because of the rich datasets available and
their importance to global health. The 2009 swine-origin H1N1
virus outbreak received great public attention and was declared a
global pandemic in June of that year (Zhang et al., 2010). More
recently, research concerning mutations of avian H5N1 inﬂuenza
that could allow it to be transmitted among mammals via aero-
sols has sparked immense controversy (Berns et al., 2012),

highlighting the threat inﬂuenza A viruses pose and the need to
better understand their interaction with the human immune
system.

3.1 H1N1 inﬂuenza model

The host response to H1N1 inﬂuenza is the best proﬁled in terms
of protein interactions, functional screens and transcriptional
effects. We leveraged these data, in particular the temporal
gene expression, to construct a dynamic model of the human
immune response to H1N1 infection. SDREM identiﬁed the
TFs that control this immune response and the signaling path-
ways that activate them—36 internal proteins that connect 33
target TFs to upstream nodes in the signaling network (Fig 1
and Supplementary Table S3). These include many proteins
known to be involved in immune response such as STATl
(Shuai and Liu, 2003), seven IRF family members (Honda and
Taniguchi, 2006), three NFKB variants (Baeuerle and Henkel,
1994), RELA (Ouaaz et al., 1999) and XBPl (Martinon et al.,
2010). Interestingly several cancer-related proteins such as AR,
BRCAl, MYC, SMAD3, SMAD7 and TP53 appear as well.

We used DAVID (Huang et al., 2009) to compute the Gene
Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000) biological process en-
richment of the proteins predicted by SDREM, leaving out the
sources because they are already known to be relevant to H1N1
and would bias the results. The most signiﬁcant GO terms are
dominated by processes related to transcriptional regulation due
to the prevalence of target TFs in our predictions. However,
beyond these are many highly relevant enriched terms including
‘immune system development’ [Benjamini-Hochberg corrected
P—value 2.18 E-5 (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)], ‘response to
virus’ (P200169), ‘virus—host interaction’ (P=0.0289) and
‘immune response’ (P: 0.0431).

3.2 Predicting RNAi screen hits

SDREM can rank human genes for their involvement in mediat-
ing host response to viral infection. Even for viruses for which
genome-wide screens are available SDREM’s models are useful
since they provide mechanistic explanations for genes’ involve-
ment in the response. In addition, the large disagreement among
genome-wide screens (Supplementary Table S2) makes such
models important in order to distinguish real hits from noise.
Finally, several pathogens, including H5N1, are challenging to
work with because they require a biosafety level 3 lab, making it
difﬁcult to generate genome-wide RNAi screens. Using SDREM
to predict RNAi screen hits allows researchers to prioritize
candidate H5N1 targets, which could later be validated
experimentally.

To determine which of the scoring metrics described in Section
2.4 is most predictive of RNAi screen hits, we ran SDREM on
the H1N1 data holding out the RNAi screen data from
SDREM’s input. We used the metrics to rank all 252 non-
target proteins in the model using the number of high-conﬁdence
paths that use the node and the network degree to break ties in
the ranking. Given the rankings for each metric, we computed
the percentage of correct hits within the top X predictions (where
X ranges from 10 to 100).

As seen in Table l, SDREM performed exceptionally well on
this task. To illustrate this, consider the number of correct screen
hits in the top 50 ranked genes. Roughly 20 of these (depending

on the actual metric used), or 40%, are known hits. Because all
the 14 334 proteins in the interaction network are included in
SDREM’s search, the expected number of known hits in a ran-
domly selected set of 50 genes is 3.1. Thus, using SDREM we
obtain a 6.5-fold enrichment in the number of correct hits, indi-
cating that such a method can be effectively used to design spe-
ciﬁc experiments for other viruses as well. Similar enrichments
are seen for other values of X.

The best-performing metric uses only the top paths, allows
targets to be activated by any source and uses the weighted
score. Intuitively, including the lower conﬁdence paths can
hurt predictive performance because these source—target connec-
tions may contain false-positive PPI and not actually affect con-
nectivity when they are broken. Our results also suggest that a
target can function if it remains connected to any source. Due to
the many parallel paths in the signaling network, it is uncommon
for a single node removal to completely disconnect a target. The
weighted variant distinguishes between deletions that do not
impact a target at all and those that remove many paths to the
target but do not fully disconnect it. This metric’s predictions
signiﬁcantly overlap with the known screen hits at all thresholds,
which is also the case for most of the other metrics. Because the
overlaps are signiﬁcant even for the worst-performing metric
when 20 or more genes are predicted, we conclude that the
SDREM model itself is a powerful ﬁlter for predicting screen hits.

3.3 Comparison with gene prioritization algorithms

Having demonstrated that SDREM produces highly accurate
rankings of putative RNAi screen hits, we examined whether
existing tools could achieve similar performance. Although
other algorithms for connecting sources and transcriptional ef-
fects provide candidate pathways (Huang and Fraenkel, 2009;
Kim et al., 2011; Ourfali et al., 2007; Schaefer et al., 2013;
Tuncbag et al., 2013; Yeang et al., 2004; Yeger-Lotem et al.,
2009), they do not rank the pathway members or quantify the
effect of knocking them down so it is impossible to compare our
knockdown prediction results with these methods. Instead, we
assess Endeavour (Aerts et al., 2006; Tranchevent et al., 2008)
and Pinta (Nitsch et al., 2009, 2011), the only two gene priori-
tization web servers in a recent benchmark (Bornigen et al., 2012)
that can prioritize the entire genome and take seed genes instead
of disease keywords as input.

We ran Endeavour and Pinta using the differentially expressed
genes identiﬁed by EDGE (Leek et al., 2006) and the H1N1
sources as input and evaluated the number of correct screen hit
predictions at the same thresholds used previously (Table 2).
Because the web servers do not provide their full ranked list of
genes, we cannot calculate AUC. SDREM outperforms the gene
prioritization tools at all thresholds except for the top 20
threshold where Pinta makes the same number of correct predic-
tions and Endeavour makes two more. SDREM’s advantage is
greatest when assessing the top 100 predictions, at which point
SDREM correctly predicts nearly twice as many RNAi screen
hits as Pinta and 24% more than Endeavour. When using alter-
native methods to select the input genes for Endeavour and
Pinta, SDREM’s strengths are even more pronounced
(Supplementary Information, Supplementary Table S5). These
results are especially impressive considering Endeavour uses

Fig. 1. The SDREM H1N1 response model. (a) The regulatory paths summarize the temporal patterns of the differentially expressed genes. The x-axis is
time and the y-axis is logz fold change. Split events, green nodes where a regulatory path branches, are annotated with the TFs that are predicted to
activate or repress the genes at that time point. These annotations are placed on the path immediately after the split to indicate whether the TF controls
the upper or lower path out of the split. (b) The signaling paths from sources (red) through internal nodes (blue) to the active TFs (green). Sources
directly interact with viral proteins or detect viral presence. The active TFs are the same TFs shown on the regulatory paths. Diamonds are RNAi screen
hits. Solid edges are PPI whose orientation has been inferred by SDREM. Dashed edges are post-translational modiﬁcations and TF-gene binding

interactions, which already have a known orientation

via text mining. These results stress the importance of building
mechanistic models that explain why differentially expressed
genes are affected by infection instead of directly ﬁnding genes
that are similar to the differentially expressed genes.

3.4 Predicting host proteins affecting H5N1 viral load

Having successfully used SDREM to predict H1N1 screen hits
we turned to the independent H5N1 data. Using the scores from
the best metric, we ranked all proteins in the H5N1 SDREM

model (Supplementary Table S4) and compared the ranks with
those we obtained using the same scoring metric on the H1N1
data. We also examined the degree of the top-ranked predictions
because we expected that high-scoring nodes would have high
degree because such nodes are likely to affect a large number of
targets when deleted. Table 3 lists the top 25 H5N1 predictions.
Recall from Equation 5 that the scores denote the fraction of
target connectivity remaining after the in silico deletion so lower
scores translate to a stronger effect. Six of the H5N1 predic-
tions—STAT 3, CASP8, HSF1, ERBB3, NRIPl and
PRMTl—are particularly interesting because they are neither
known H1N1 RNAi screen hits nor in the top 100 H1N1 pre-
dicted hits. Two of these, CASP8 and ERBB3, have been re-
ported to directly interact with H5N1 viral proteins but not
H1N1 proteins even though the H1N1-human PPI have much
greater coverage, suggesting that they may indeed play distinct
roles. Several top-ranked H5N1 proteins are sources (directly
interacting with the viral proteins) or high-degree nodes. In con-
trast, NRIPl and PRMTl are neither sources nor of high degree.
Their inclusion in the top predictions is noteworthy because the
paths through these nodes affect targets to a greater extent than
expected. NRIPl, also known as RIP140, is involved in inﬂam-
matory response as a coactivator for NFKB (Zschiedrich et al.,
2008). PRMTl methylation of STATl is one of the ways in
which STATl is regulated in the immune system (Shuai and
Liu, 2003).

3.5 Screen hits improve the SDREM H1N1 model

SDREM can predict screen hits, but when RNAi data are al-
ready available they do indeed lead to more accurate SDREM
models. Here we refer to the model reconstructed using all data
as the ‘original’ model and the model obtained after omitting the

RNAi data as the ‘no-RNAi’ model. Of the 69 signaling proteins
and TFs predicted in the original SDREM H1N1 model, 38
(55%) are screen hits versus only 20 of 61 predictions (33%) in
the no-RNAi model. The original and no-RNAi models overlap
substantially. However, some important immune responders,
including IRF2 and NFKBl, were only detected in the original
SDREM model.

The original SDREM model better corresponds to related
annotated pathways as well. We used DAVID to examine the
enrichment of Biocarta pathways (Nishimura, 2001) for SDREM
model members. The immune-related pathways ‘Human
Cytomegalovirus and Map Kinase Pathways’, ‘The informa-
tion-processing pathway at the Interferon-beta enhancer’, ‘T
Cell Receptor Signaling Pathway’ and ‘Toll—Like Receptor
Pathway’ are enriched in the original model (all with corrected
P<0.05) but not the no-RNAi SDREM model.

3.6 Predicting genetic interactions

Genetic interactions are functional interactions between pairs of
genes where simultaneous double deletion has a smaller or
greater than expected effect. Humans have tens of thousands
of genes, making it impossible to comprehensively screen for
all possible genetic interactions in a condition of interest as is
done to identify the phenotypic effects of single gene loss. In
contrast, the in silico analysis performed by SDREM can be ex-
tended to pairwise or higher-order analysis. Given its perform-
ance on the single knockdown prediction task, the ranked list of
pairs identiﬁed by SDREM can serve as a starting point for
follow-up validation experiments. Considering the rather disap-
pointing agreement between screen hits performed by different
labs, such higher-order analysis may be required to accurately
and robustly identify targets that can impact disease progression
and viral load.

Based on our results for predicting H1N1 screen hits (Table 1),
we again consider only the top-ranked paths and allow targets to
be activated by any single source. We used our method to predict
genetic interactions that affect H1N1 (Table 4) and H5N1
(Supplementary Table S6) infection. Condition-speciﬁc experi-
mental validation is necessary to conﬁrm that these pairs form
genetic interactions that impact viral infection, but annotated
pathways indicate that some of these pairs do act in parallel in
other settings. For example, RBl and TP53 are on parallel paths

Ribosomal Biogenesis’ as are TP53 and TRAF2 in KEGG’s

pairs such as ILF3 and PA2G4 (ﬁfth on the H5N1 list) are es-
pecially interesting because the two proteins are not high-degree
nodes in the PPI network.

4 DISCUSSION

SDREM is unique in that it combines time series and static data
to model both signaling and dynamic regulatory networks. This

allows it to infer, more conﬁdently, the TFs that are at the end
points of signaling cascades and control human disease response.
To manage the complexity of human interaction networks, we
extended SDREM to leverage gene priors from RNAi screens in
its objective function and incorporated several algorithmic im-
provements. As we have shown for inﬂuenza infection, by recon-
structing disease response networks we can accurately identify
key signaling pathways and nodes (proteins). SDREM can be
applied successfully in many different settings even when the PPI
data, node priors or gene expression time points are sparse
(Supplementary Information, Supplementary Tables S7 and S8).

SDREM

 

Given the predicted directed signaling pathways, we can esti-
mate the phenotypic effects of knocking down genes by assessing
how strongly the downstream TFs are affected. These techniques
can be used to infer putative drug targets for hard-to-study con-
ditions (such as H5N1 infection) and for combination of targets,
which can lead to more robust treatments. Successfully predict-
ing the effects of pairwise and higher-order gene knockdowns
can guide targeted experimental validation, a major contribution
because exhaustive pairwise RNAi screening is currently infeas-
ible and signaling pathway redundancy can limit the effectiveness
of drugs that target individual genes (Logue and Morrison,
2012). Owing to this pathway redundancy and false negatives
in the existing RNAi screens, the precision we calculate for
SDREM’s RNAi effect predictions (Table l) is conservative.
Many proteins predicted by SDREM (for example STAT1,
RELA, NFKB2 and several IRF TFs) are not screen hits but
are known to be important to the immune response.

An important advantage of SDREM over previous RNAi
screen and host—pathogen PPI studies is the ability to infer
new pathways from general interaction data. Previous studies
[for example, (Shapira et al., 2009)] and pathway-based GWAS
(Wang et al., 2010) often rely on known curated pathways that
are incomplete and not always relevant to the disease studied. In
contrast, using condition-speciﬁc time series data and sources,
SDREM can predict which candidate proteins are involved in
the signaling pathways and which are not.

Unlike the gene scores from Endeavour, Pinta and other gene
prioritization algorithms that are only deﬁned for single genes,
SDREM predicts functional disease genes by modeling the
impact of removing a gene from the disease-speciﬁc signaling
pathways. This simulated phenotype can be naturally extended
to pairs of genes, allowing SDREM to predict genetic inter-
actions analogously to experimental approaches. Existing genetic
interaction prediction algorithms require a partial set of known
genetic interactions (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2012; Qi et al., 2008;
Wong et al., 2004; Zhong and Sternberg, 2006), which prevents
their application in human. Furthermore, SDREM’s genetic
interaction predictions are condition-speciﬁc.

Our inﬂuenza analysis focused on data from human cell lines,
but some of SDREM’s most exciting future applications will
involve data from individual patients. We would like to use the
extensions presented in this article to enable GWAS data to be
used as node priors. One possible approach we intend to explore
is to map SNP P—values to gene scores as in pathway-based
GWAS (Wang et al., 2010). In addition, SNPs in non-coding
regions with potential regulatory functions could be used to sug-
gest which TFs’ binding is disrupted (Schaub et al., 2012), pro-
viding priors for both the network orientation and the temporal
expression analysis.

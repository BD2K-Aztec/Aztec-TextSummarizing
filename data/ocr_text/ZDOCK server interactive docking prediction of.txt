ABSTRACT

Summary: Protein—protein interactions are essential to cellular and
immune function, and in many cases, because of the absence of an
experimentally determined structure of the complex, these interactions
must be modeled to obtain an understanding of their molecular basis.
We present a user-friendly protein docking server, based on the rigid-
body docking programs ZDOCK and M-ZDOCK, to predict structures
of protein—protein complexes and symmetric multimers. With a goal of
providing an accessible and intuitive interface, we provide options for
users to guide the scoring and the selection of output models, in add-
ition to dynamic visualization of input structures and output docking
models. This server enables the research community to easily and
quickly produce structural models of protein—protein complexes and
symmetric multimers for their own analysis.

Availability: The ZDOCK server is freely available to all academic and
non-profit users at: http://zdock.umassmed.edu. No registration is
required.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein interactions are responsible for a wide range of
key biological processes such as cell signaling, enzyme inhibition
and immune recognition. A high-resolution structure of a protein
complex provides the atomic details of the interaction, and
enables rational design of therapeutic molecules that inhibit or
improve binding. Although many structures of protein com-
plexes have been determined by x-ray crystallography, many
have not been characterized experimentally due in part to cost
and experimental limitations. This has led to the development of
protein—protein docking algorithms, of which the top-performing
methods often produce models with atomic-level accuracy. These
approaches are distinct from those developed for protein-
small molecule docking, which are often used to dock ligands
(or sets thereof, for Virtual screening) to a known binding pocket.
To facilitate protein—protein docking prediction, web-based ser-
vers have been developed for rigid-body docking (Ritchie and
Venkatraman, 2010; Tovchigrechko and Vakser, 2006), flexible
docking and refinement (Lyskov and Gray, 2008; Mashiach

at al., 2010; Torchala et al., 2013), clustering (Comeau et al.,
2004) and symmetric multimer docking (Schneidman-Duhovny
et al., 2005).

The rigid-body protein—protein docking program ZDOCK
was developed in our laboratory >10 years ago (Chen and
Weng, 2002). It uses the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm to
enable an efﬁcient global docking search on a 3D grid, and util-
izes a combination of shape complementarity, electrostatics and
statistical potential terms for scoring. ZDOCK achieves high
predictive accuracy on protein—protein docking benchmarks,
with >70% success in the top 1000 predictions for rigid-body
cases in the most recent benchmark version (Pierce et al.,
2011), and consistent success (acceptable or better predictions
for 22 of the last 35 submitted targets) in the international pro-
tein—protein docking experiment, Critical Assessment of
Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) (Hwang et al., 2010a; Vreven
et al., 2013; Wiehe et al., 2005; Wiehe et al., 2007). To provide
the research community with a simple interface to predict struc-
tures of protein complexes using ZDOCK, we developed the
ZDOCK Server. Since its initial implementation, the ZDOCK
Server has undergone major changes to improve its docking per-
formance, functionality and user interface. The improvements
were motivated by valuable user suggestions as well as our
own initiatives and algorithm development. These include
upgrading the docking algorithm from ZDOCK 2.3 to
ZDOCK 3.0.2, resulting in greater accuracy and highly efficient
searching. A portal for running the program M-ZDOCK (Pierce
et al., 2005) to predict the structures of symmetric multimers was
recently added. Also, various aspects of the user interface have
been improved, integrating Viewing of structures and descriptions
during submission and analysis of results.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The ZDOCK Server web interface is written in PHP and HTML,
as well as Javascript for dynamic functionality. JMol (http://
www.jmol.org) is used for molecular Visualization on the residue
selection and results pages, and the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
RESTful web service interface (Rose et al., 2011) is used to dy-
namically gather information for PDB IDs that are entered
during submission. The ZDOCK Server allows users to generate
sets of predictions in PDB format from job output files with a
Java program.

Jobs are run on a dedicated computer server at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School with 128GB RAM and 64
(2.2GHz) cores. Each ZDOCK and M-ZDOCK job is paralle-
lized using Message Passing Interface (MP1) to run on eight cores.
A Perl script on the backend server checks for jobs to submit,
submits jobs, checks for completed jobs and sends results to users.

The ZDOCK and M-ZDOCK executables and code were not
modified for the server from the downloadable and published
algorithms; default sampling levels are used for all jobs.

3 USAGE

Prediction of complexes using the server proceeds in three steps
(Fig. l):

(1) Input structures and options. On the initial submission
page, users provide two input structures to be docked
(one structure in the case of M-ZDOCK), either by up-
loading their own PDB files or by specifying PDB codes
followed by selection of chains or biological assembly Via
dynamically generated checkboxes. Options include selec-
tion of ZDOCK version (3.0.2 or 2.3.2).

(2) Selection of blocking/contacting residues. The next step is
selection of blocking (ZDOCK and M-ZDOCK) and con-
tacting (ZDOCK only) residues for each submitted pro-
tein, which is aided by J Mol Visualization of each molecule
that highlights selected residues for the user.

(3) Viewing results. Users are emailed a link to the results
page on job completion, where randomly generated
codes are used for results page names (to ensure privacy
of users’ data). In addition to the ZDOCK output and
pre—processed input PDB files, the results page features a
JMol Visualization of the top docking models and the
center-of—mass positions of the top 500 ligands (the
latter for ZDOCK only), as well as the capability to
Visualize (in JMol) or download any individual complex
from the output. In addition to the top 10 models
that are available as a user download, sets of predicted
complexes can be generated using a Java program, or
alternatively an executable file that is included with the
download of the appropriate program (ZDOCK or
M-ZDOCK).

The ZDOCK Server has established a sizable user base.
Since its move to the dedicated computer server at the
University of Massachusetts 7 months ago, the ZDOCK Server
has completed >6200 jobs from >1000 unique users. The aver-
age running time for jobs is 11.5 min. While this is significantly
faster than most docking servers, its predictive performance
is comparable with recently developed docking servers. For
example, based on CAPRI ‘Acceptable’ criteria, the success
rates of ZDOCK 3.0.2 on Docking Benchmark 4.0 (Hwang
et al., 2010b) are 12 and 51%, for the top 1 and 50 predictions,
respectively, versus rates of 10 and 57% reported for the
SwarmDock Server, which takes up to 36h per docking run
(Torchala et al., 2013).

4 CONCLUSIONS

The ZDOCK Server provides a fast and effective means to pro-
duce models of protein—protein complexes and symmetric multi-
mers, Via a user-friendly web interface. In addition to generating
and Viewing structures of docking models through the server’s
tools and interface, users have the option of submitting ZDOCK
Server output files directly to several available docking refine-
ment and post-processing tools (linked from the server page). In
the future, possible developments include clustering and post-
processing functionality directly on the server itself, in addition
to other improvements based on user requests.

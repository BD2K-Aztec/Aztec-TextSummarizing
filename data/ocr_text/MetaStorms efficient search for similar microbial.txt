ABSTRACT

Background: It has long been intriguing scientists to effectively com-
pare different microbial communities (also referred as ‘metagenomic
samples’ here) in a large scale: given a set of unknown samples, find
similar metagenomic samples from a large repository and examine
how similar these samples are. With the current metagenomic sam-
ples accumulated, it is possible to build a database of metagenomic
samples of interests. Any metagenomic samples could then be
searched against this database to find the most similar metagenomic
sample(s). However, on one hand, current databases with a large
number of metagenomic samples mostly serve as data repositories
that offer few functionalities for analysis; and on the other hand, meth-
ods to measure the similarity of metagenomic data work well only for
small set of samples by painNise comparison. It is not yet clear, how to
efficiently search for metagenomic samples against a large metage-
nomic database.

Results: In this study, we have proposed a novel method, Meta-
Storms, that could systematically and efficiently organize and search
metagenomic data. It includes the following components: (i) creating a
database of metagenomic samples based on their taxonomical anno-
tations, (ii) efficient indexing of samples in the database based on a
hierarchical taxonomy indexing strategy, (iii) searching for a metage-
nomic sample against the database by a fast scoring function based
on quantitative phylogeny and (iv) managing database by index
export, index import, data insertion, data deletion and database mer-
ging. We have collected more than 1300 metagenomic data from the
public domain and in-house facilities, and tested the Meta-Storms
method on these datasets. Our experimental results show that
Meta-Storms is capable of database creation and effective searching
for a large number of metagenomic samples, and it could achieve
similar accuracies compared with the current popular significance
testing-based methods.

Conclusion: Meta-Storms method would serve as a suitable data-
base management and search system to quickly identify similar meta-
genomic samples from a large pool of samples.

1 INTRODUCTION

Microbes are everywhere around us on the planet, and the
total number of microbial cells on earth is huge: a rough estima-
tion of their number is 1030 (Proctor, 1994). Microbes usually live
in communities, and each of these communities has different
community structures and functions. As such, microbial commu-
nities would serve as the largest reservoir of genes and genetic
functions for a vast number of applications in “bid-related
disciplines, including biomedicine in healthcare, bioenergy,
bioremediation and biodefense (National Research Council
(U.S.). Committee on Metagenomics: Challenges and
Functional Applications. and National Academies Press (US),
2007).

Because >90% of the strains in a microbial community could
not be isolated and cultivated (Jurkowski et al., 2007), the meta-
genomic methods have been used to analyze the microbial
community as a whole. Understanding the taxonomical structure
of a microbial community (alpha diversity) and the differences in
taxa among microbial communities (beta diversity) have been
two of the most important problems in metagenomic research.
In contrast to alpha diversity, which measures how many kinds
of microorganisms are there in a single community, beta diversity
measures how community membership varies over time and
space, and is especially important for finding the complex rela-
tionships among a large numbers of samples. Understanding the
beta diversity is critical for studying microbial ecology. For eX-
ample, Human Microbiome Projects (Turnbaugh et al., 2006)
and related efforts to study microbial communities occupying
various human body habitats have shown a surprising amount
of diversity among individuals in skin (Fierer et al., 2008), gut
(Turnbaugh et al., 2009) and mouth ecosystems (Yang et al.,
2012). Furthermore, the microbial communities would differ sig-
niﬁcantly even for those from types of similar environment
(Muegge et al., 2011).

Next-generation sequencing techniques have enabled the
fast profiling of a large number of metagenomic data. Thus, a
rapidly increasing number of metagenomic profiles of microbial
communities have been archived in public repositories and
research labs around the world. As such, it is becoming more
and more important to compare microbial communities in large
scale.

1.1 Comparison of microbial communities

A number of methods have been proposed for class discovery
and comparison of different metagenomic samples. For compari-
son of multiple metagenomic samples, current researchers would
adopt two different approaches: taxon-based (using overlap in
lists of species, genera, OTUs and so on) or phylogenetic (using
overlaps on a phylogenetic tree), both of which were based on the
taxonomical information from the samples.

In the first approach, many recent pyro-sequencing studies
have been developed to compare samples (Huber et al., 2007;
Roesch et al., 2007; Sogin et al., 2006). MEGAN (Huson et al.,
2007) is a metagenomic analysis tool with recent additions for
phylogenetic comparisons (Mitra et al., 2010) and statistical
analyses (Mitra et al., 2009). MEGAN, however, can only com-
pare single pairs of metagenomic samples based on taxonomy,
as is also the case with STAMP (Parks and Beiko, 2010), which
does introduce a concept of ‘biological relevance’ in the form of
conﬁdence intervals. Other methods, such as MG—RAST (Meyer
et al., 2008), ShotgunFunctionalizeR (Kristiansson et al., 2009),
mothur (Schloss et al., 2009) and METAREP (Goll et al., 2010),
all process metagenomic data using standard statistical tests
(mainly t-tests with some modiﬁcations). Those analyses are
clear and simple, yet would turn out not to be very accurate
(Hamady and Knight, 2009). In the second approach, some re-
searchers have used phylogeny-based methods to compare sam-
ples (Hamady et al., 2010; Lozupone and Knight, 2005).
Phylogenetic beta diversity measures, such as UniFrac and
Fast UniFrac (Hamady et al., 2010; Lozupone and Knight,
2005), are speciﬁcally important because, unlike taxon—based
measures (Huson et al., 2007), they utilize the similarities and
differences among species (Graham and Fine, 2008). This add-
itional information makes phylogenetic beta diversity measures
more effective at showing ecological patterns than taxon—based
methods (Lozupone et al., 2008). Therefore, considerable insight
has been gained from applying phylogenetic beta diversity meth-
ods to microbes in different environments. The number of sam-
ples and sample sizes (e.g. currently the Fast UniFrac online
upload restriction is 200 samples) was the current limiting factors
for the extension of this approach on the rapidly increasing scale
of metagenomic experiments, thus rendering large-scale (e.g.
more than 1000 samples) comparison of metagenomic samples
difﬁcult.

1.2 Databases of microbial communities

As metagenomic samples have been rapidly accumulated, it is
natural to facilitate the comparison of microbial communities:
create a database system with large number of metagenomic
samples, and then given a set of samples as queries, ﬁnd if
there are similar metagenomic samples in the database. In
other words, ‘what does my sample like, how is it similar and
different from any known samples?’

However, current metagenomic databases, such as MG—RAST
(Meyer et al., 2008) and CAMERA2 (http://camera.calit2.net/),
mainly serve as the data repositories, with only some modules for
basic alpha and beta diversity analysis but neither full support of
comparison nor search functions. Recently, a new database,
MeganDB (http://www.megan—db.org/megan—db/home/), has
been developed with public metagenomic samples pre—processed

and archived, against which query metagenomic samples could
be searched. This is an increasingly viable approach for searching
for similar metagenomic samples, yet the current approach based
on pairwise taxonomical comparison of metagenomic samples
still lacks of index supporting for high efﬁcient query.

1.3 Efﬁcient search for similar metagenomic communities
in a database

To facilitate the metagenomic sample comparison and search, it
is crucial to design an effective metagenomic database system,
primarily based on database creation and search schemes. Such
scheme would include key advantages such as efﬁcient indexing
of database and accurate search scores, based on which, (i) the
metagenomic samples are not only the accumulation of raw data
(Supplementary Fig. SlA), but a set of well-organized and
indexed datasets (Supplementary Fig. SlC) and (ii) the focus of
the ‘comparison of different microbial communities’ is not
the traditional pair-wise comparison for all possible pairs
(Supplementary Fig. SlB), but more of the query-based similar-
ity analysis (Supplementary Fig. SlC).

In this work, we have designed a novel database indexing and
searching method, Meta-Storms, based on taxonomical annota-
tions and phylogenetic structure of metagenomic samples. The
overall scheme of Meta-Storms is illustrated in Figure 1.

In the database creation part (Fig. 1A), all metagenomic sam-
ples are pre-computed to parse out their taxonomical structures
(community structure), based on which Meta-Storms then gen-
erates the index of the database by four alternative methods:
scanning sample ﬁles to automatically add each sample, inserting
single index entry manually, merged with other databases and
merged by indices of other databases. In the database query part
(Fig. 1B), the query sample’s taxonomical structure is also parsed
out, which is then searched against the samples in the database
by very fast indexing to retrieve candidate samples. After that, a
quantitative phylogenetic-based similarity scoring function is
used to compute the similarity between query and each of
these candidates, and candidates with matching scores above
thresholds are considered as matches to query. Meta-Storms
also has database management part (Fig. 1 C) to efﬁciently

Novel indexing scheme and similarity score for metagenomic data

 

manage the database, which is speciﬁcally useful when the data-
base is huge.

2 METHODS

We have used C/C++ to implement the Meta-Storms. This software
package includes database and index creation, metagenomic data
query, database management and other functions which, together,
could be beneﬁcial for the maintenance and usage of metagenomic
sample management, comparison and query.

2.1 Database and index creation

2.1.] Database creation by taxonomical structure The taxo-
nomical structure of a metagenomic sample is directly associated with
the community structure of the corresponding microbial community. The
database is composed of metagenomic datasets, all of which are ﬁrst
analyzed by a highly efﬁcient taxonomy- and phylogeny-based metage-
nomic analysis pipeline, Parallel-META [(Su et al., 2012), version 1.3], to
obtain the taxonomical structure. Then, a unique ID is assigned to each
sample in the database.

2.1.2 Database indexing An index is created to organize the whole
metagenomic database into hierarchical structure, mainly for the purpose
of fast look-up for query samples. It is noticed that for many microbial
communities (though might not be true for all), an intricate nature of its
structure is that each microbial community is dominated by a few gen-
omes (Hugenholtz and Tyson, 2008). Based on this general fact, we
selected a set of phyla of each sample with high abundance (in the
lexicographical order) as the ‘index key’. To avoid arbitrary choice of
indexing, each selected phylum should have signiﬁcantly large proportion
of reads. Based on previous experience, the abundance threshold of phyla
for index key selection was decided to be 15%. We then built a Trie
structure for high efﬁcient indexing of the corresponding subdatasets of
the samples, which have the same index key.

Figure 2A illustrates the hierarchical structure of the index with an
example of a Trie. In the index, each character above the branches rep-
resents one phylum name in the index key, and the subdatasets are rep-
resented by the nodes, such as index key ‘BC’ is for samples in subdataset
8 (node 8 in Fig. 2A). Meta-Storms initialized the index by inserting all
samples of the database into an empty Trie. Once the index is built,
adding new samples in the database is simple: just insert them into the
proper position of the Trie by their index keys. For instance, samples with
index key ‘BCE’ (the selected phyla are B, C and E) should be inserted
into subdataset 15 (node 15 of Fig. 2A) and sample with index key ‘CDH’
should be added to a new subdataset (Fig. 2B, node 19 in dashed line).

 

 

 

Fig. 2. Index structure based on Trie. (A) Characters above branches
represent phylum names in index keys, and nodes represent the corres-
ponding subdatasets. (B) is updated from A by adding a new subdataset
(node 19) with index key ‘CDH’.

Samples without index keys (i.e. without phylum of high abundance) are
stored into the same subdataset named ‘others’ (node 4 of Fig. 2A).

2.2 Database query

2.2.] Indexed query and parallel indexed query The ‘query key’
of the query metagenomic sample is parsed out by the same method as for
the index key of samples in the database. Meta-Storms maps the query
key in the Trie to the deepest (right-most) level, and fetches the subdataset
in which samples have high abundance phyla as candidates, such as query
key ‘ABD’ should be mapped to subdataset l3 (node 13 of Fig. 2A).
When the query key cannot be fully mapped in the Trie, the least abun-
dant phylum is removed from the query key, and this updated query key
is tried again. If successful, the indexed query compete, otherwise this
query key updating and mapping procedure continues until there is a hit,
or all phyla are removed from the query key, which means that there is no
hit for indexed query. For example, query key ‘AEFD’ (with abundance
A> D > F > E) could be mapping to subdataset 7 (node 7 of Fig. 2A) by
removing the two least abundance phyla F and E, and query key ‘AGHI’
(with abundance G>H>I>A) could be considered as ‘not hit’.

Then, a quantitative phylogenetic-based scoring function (refer to
Section 2.2.2 for details) is used to accurately search for the query
sample by pairwise comparison with the candidate samples. As each can-
didate sample in the subdataset is independent, this comparison can be
parallelized based on parallel programing. In this work, we map each pair
of comparison with a thread, and on multi-core CPUs, these threads can
be processed at the same time. All threads store their results in a
shared-memory space which can be accessed by other threads.

2.2.2 Scoring functiOn The scoring function is to compare the mi-
crobial communities’ structure similarity by quantitative (i.e. the relative
abundance of each species in a sample) and phylogenetic (i.e. the evolu-
tionary distances between each species and its parent) (Hamady and
Knight, 2009) calculation of their common component’s proportion
based on the phylogenetic relationship of species in two microbial
communities.

(1) Preprocessing: initially, a common ‘binary’ phylogenetic tree of the
two metagenomic samples with branch lengths and node weights is
built: The branch length between each species and its ancestor
represents the number of different nucleotides in every 100 nucleo-
tides between their genome sequences, which reﬂects their degree of
difference and the node weights are the proportion of reads for
species of each sample that can be obtained by taxonomical struc-
ture analysis.

(2) Recursive scoring function: from each leaf node to the root,
the similarity score for every single branch in the common phylo-
genetic tree is calculated by the recursive functions described as
below:

Suppose for a single species X (represented by a leaf node in the phylo-
genetic tree), the proportions of this species in the two samples are X.Pl
and X.P2, respectively. For example, the proportions of species X are
30% in sample S1 and 40% in sample S2 (node X in Fig. 3A). We deﬁne
MIN(X) as the similarity score for a single species:

MIN(X) =(X.P1 g X.P2) ? X.Pl : X.P2; (1)

That is, the similarity score of one single species can be interpreted as the
common proportion on this species of two samples, such as at node X,
the score is MIN(30%, 40%): 30%.

After extracting the common proportion, sample with larger propor-
tion is remained of which the new proportion is |X.P1 — X.P2| (node X in
Fig. 3B). Samples at different nodes in the phylogenetic tree (node X and
nod Y in Fig. 3B) cannot be compared directly, but should be reduced to
their common ancestor X. Ancestor (if X is not root) by being multiplied

Fig. 3. An example of how scoring function works. Here, we have two
metagenomic samples S1 and S2, their common binary phylogenetic tree
with three species X, Y, Z and the proportion of each species
(A). The ﬁrst step is to get the similarity score from leaf node of X and
Y. Then the remaining component of X and Y are reduced to their
common ancestor by being multiplied by l-Dist and continue the com-
parison at both the ancestor node and leaf node Z (B). The remaining
component of ancestor node of X and Y and leaf node Z are recursively
reduced to the root node and (C) the overall similarity are got after the
comparison at root. Finally, (D) the overall similarity of these two sam-
ples is 92.8%.

by the factor of l-Dist (‘Dist’ is the phylogenetic distance between this
species and its ancestor), which indicates how much component they
shared with their ancestor. This step is referred to as the ‘Reduce’
function.

Reduce(X){
M = MIN(X);
X.Ancestor.Pl+ = (X.Pl — M) >I< (l — Dist); (2)
X.Ancestor.P2+ = (X.P2 — M) >I< (l — Dist);
}

We further deﬁne that for an internal node X, its two child nodes are
X.Left and X.Right. Then the overall similarly score of one whole branch
in the phylogenetic tree can be calculated recursively by this function:

GetSimilarity(X) =
MIN(X);

I XisaLea Node
Reduce(X); f f

, GetSimilarity(X.Left) (3)
+GetSimilarity(X.Right)
+MIN(X);
K Reduce(X);

If X is an Internal Node

 

All branches are calculated in the same way and at the root of the
phylogenetic tree, we can get the overall similarity score of two metage-
nomic samples. For example, the overall similarity score for comparing
S1 and S2 is 92.8% (Fig. 3D).

(3) The properties of scoring function: the scoring function calculates
the overall proportion of common components of two metage-
nomic samples in all phylogenetic level by bottom—up analysis of
the weighted common phylogenetic tree. This calculation based on
weighted sum take into consideration both (a) the evolutionary
distances of the species in each sample that are between 0 and l
and (b) the different normalized abundances of these species in
different samples represented by leaf nodes in the common phylo-
genetic tree, which also make the similarity score of two samples is
always between 0% and 100%. Therefore, it realistically reﬂects
the (weighted) structure differences between two different metage-
nomic samples. As such, the query results could be ranked directly
by their similarity values compared with query sample. Moreover,
since it depends on only a hierarchical annotation structure, such a
scoring function could measure any kind of beta diversity for two
samples.

(4) Data structure and time complexity: the common binary phylogen-
etic tree is stored in Newick format (Cayley et al., 2000) as a char-
acter string, and the proportion of read for species in two samples
are stored in a hash table for constant-time access. As the similarity
score calculation of two metagenomic samples can be completed by
scanning the character string of the Newick-formatted phylogen-
etic tree only once, the algorithm of scoring function is in O(n)
time, where n is the total number of nodes in the common phylo-
genetic tree. In our experiments, more than 10000 times of execu-
tion of scoring function could be ﬁnished within minute (refer to
Fig. 7 in Section 3.6 for details).

(5) P-value calculation: to assess the signiﬁcance of the similarity
between two samples, we further deﬁned a statistically meaningful
P—value between two samples: the proportions of species in each
sample are randomly permuted for 1000 times, and random simi-
larity scores based on new abundance are calculated by the scoring
function, then P—value is the rank of the original real similarity
score among the permutated scores. Since two samples are signiﬁ-
cantly similar, if the real similarity score is signiﬁcantly higher than
would be expected when the sequences were randomly distributed
between the two samples (Lozupone and Knight, 2005), if the
P—value is equal to or lower than an experimental threshold of
10% (refer to Section 3.5 for details), then the two metagenomic
samples can be considered as signiﬁcantly similar.

2.2.3 Exhaustive search Meta-Storms also provide the exhaustive
search, which is based on comparing the query sample to all samples in
the database by our scoring function to get the best match scores (con-
sidered as ‘golden standard’). As all samples are computed by this method
in the database, exhaustive search is much slower than indexed query
(refer to Section 3.3 for details).

2.2.4 Index consistency The index consistency between indexed
query and exhaustive search is calculated by checking the probability
that results of these two methods to be equal, which can reﬂect the reli-
ability that whether the indexed query can ﬁnd out the same best-match
result as the ‘golden standard’.

We can give the Dominant Genomes Lemma to predict the index
consistency. In the database, a sample is considered to have dominant
phyla if and only if the total proportion of the phyla which are selected in
the index key is >60%. Then, the Dominant Genomes Lemma is
described as the following:

Dominant Genomes Lemma:
If D% samples in the database have dominant phyla, then the index
consistency is at least D%.

2.3 Database management

Meta-Storms also has modules to efﬁciently manage the database, includ-
ing index import and export, data insertion and deletion, database mer-
ging and so on, which would be especially useful when the database is
huge. We have implemented database operations that include (Fig. l C):
(i) index export, to export an index of a database for query after database
creation; (ii) index import, to use an index on a database for efﬁcient
query; (iii) data insertion, to insert new metagenomic sample(s) into a
database; (iv) data deletion, to remove metagenomic sample(s) from a
database and (v) database merging, to merge two different metagenomic
databases into one.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

3.1 Experiment settings

In this work, we performed seven experiments with ﬁve datasets
to evaluate the index consistency, index efﬁciency, scoring
function consistency, scoring function efﬁciency and so on of
Meta-Storms. Tables 1 and 2 (refer to ‘Dataset details’ in
Supplementary Material for more information and availability)
show the information of our experiments and datasets. We also
built a ‘test database’ with all 1363 metagenomic samples of
dataset Database 1 (Table 2) for the ﬁrst two experiments on
indexing.

Table 1. Description of experiment setting

3.2 Indexing consistency evaluation

In this experiment, we used dataset Query 1 (Table 2, 80 samples
in total) as query samples to assess the consistency of indexing in
the ‘test database’. With 1179 of 1383 samples having dominant
phyla, the index consistency of the test database would be
>86.50%, as predicted by the ‘Dominant Genomes Lemma’
(refer to Section 2.2.4). We also tracked the 184 samples that
do not have dominant phyla. Among them, 99 samples were
from ‘Dog Fleas’ and 27 samples were from ‘Snake Gut’ of
which the unclassiﬁed reads took a percentage of >20%. This
made the average of their index keys to be 45.78%. For the other
58 samples, the average proportion of their index keys was
54.82%, which is very close to 60%. Therefore, it is conjectured
that the major reason for samples without dominant phyla is
largely due to the incompleteness of the taxonomy annotation
of these samples, based on current taxa database.

In this experiment, as 72 indexed query results of 80 query
samples (Fig. 4A) were the same as those based on exhaustive
search, the index consistency was considered to be 90.0%, which
veriﬁed the Dominant Genomes Lemma. We also checked the
rank of indexed query results in the top ﬁve best-match results of
exhaustive search (Fig. 4A). Results have shown that all samples
were in top three matches. Such high ranks of indexed query

results compared with ‘golden standard’ partially indicated that
the results between the two approaches (indexed query and
exhaustive search) would be signiﬁcantly similar. This is also
veriﬁed by direct comparison: the average difference of
best-match results between them are only 0.19% (Fig. 4B).
Here ‘average difference’ was calculated by the formula
(2?; Ei — Ii)/80. In which, Ei represents the similarity score of
query sample i and its best-match sample by exhaustive search
and Ii represents the similarity score of query sample i and its
best-match sample by indexed query.

3.3 Indexing efﬁciency evaluation

To evaluate the efﬁciency of indexing, we also compared the
running time of indexed query and exhaustive search with the
test query samples in the last experiment (80 samples of dataset
Query 1 as queries against the test database). This is performed
for four times to get the average performance.

For indexed query, as all samples in the subdataset represented
by the query key of query sample are scanned to compute the
similarity score with query sample, the running time of indexed
query mostly depends on the size of the corresponding subdata-
set (number of samples, Supplementary Fig. S2A) of the
database. Additionally, there is no apparent correlation between
query sample size (number of reads) and the processing speed by
either indexing or exhaustive search (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
In this experiment, the indexed query had achieved an average
speed of 12.02 compared with exhaustive search.

3.4 Scoring function analysis

The scoring function module is one of the key components of the
Meta-Storms method. To test the reliability of scoring function,
we calculated the pairwise similarity score of samples in our
database and compared with weighted Fast UniFrac (Hamady
et al., 2010) distance, which has different principles for calcula-
tion of pairwise score for metagenomic samples. Limited by
the Fast UniFrac online upload restriction of 200 samples,
we randomly selected 200 samples from six different kinds of
source (dataset Select, Table 2) from 1363 samples of dataset
Database 1.

For 200 samples, there were 200 * 199/2 2 19900 sample pairs,
each has a pairwise distance. In Figure 5, distance values (dots in
Fig. 5) were distributing in the diagonal area, meaning that

results of the two methods (our scoring function distance and
Fast UniFrac distance) are very consistent (Spearman correl-
ation of 0.915) in measuring pairwise similarity (distance) be-
tween samples.

Having high correlation of pairwise distances with weighted
Fast UniFrac, Meta-Storms has three major advantages/differ-
ences compared with other methods: (i) Meta-Storms is fully
open-source, which could be installed locally as a stand-alone
version with no sample number restriction (advantage in soft-
ware conﬁguration); (ii) Meta-Storms can take input of the 16 s
rRNA pyro-sequencing data or Whole Genome Sequencing
(WGS) data, so it is independent of any other method to retrieve
the community structure of the metagenomic samples (advantage
in system integrity) and (iii) Meta-Storms system is a metage-
nomic data management and search system, rather than a mul-
tiple sample comparison method (difference in design principle).
Thus, Meta-Storms’ scoring function serves as one of the several
important components for its advantages and uniqueness.

3.5 P—value analysis

In this part, to test P—values, we have used the P—value of 19 900
sample pairs of 200 samples of dataset ‘Select’ (Table 2). To
avoid inaccuracy caused by random sampling, permutation of
each sample pair was repeated 1000 times.

The resultant ﬁgure (Fig. 6) was divided into four areas by
horizontal reference line indicating P—value 10% and vertical ref-
erence line indicating similarity score 85%. Sample pairs in area
1 are very few, and they have low similarity scores; Sample pairs
in area 2 could be considered as not similar for high P—value but
low similarity scores; In area 3, all sample pairs have pairwise
similarity 285%, and P—value 310% (signiﬁcant similar accord-
ing to P—value). In area 4, although the P—values of sample pairs
were >10%, they were still considered to be signiﬁcant similar
because, in—depth analyses have shown that for most of the
sample pairs, the leaf nodes of each common phylogenetic tree
were quite similar. For 1016 (Fig. 6 sample pairs marked by
light-colored circles) of 1090 sample pairs in area 4, two samples
in the pair were from the same source such as soil, ocean and
human, meaning that the structure of two samples were similar,
based on which most permutations of the proportion led to high
similarity scores.

P—value by statistical analysis. Points marked by light-colored circles rep-
resent sample pairs with two samples from same sources, while others are
marked by deep-colored crosses.

Based on these results, we could provide a recommended
threshold of similarity score of 85%, which means that for two
samples, if the similarity score is 285%, they could be considered
as signiﬁcantly similar. From the results in Figure 6, we can
observe that in this test, 2570 sample pairs were considered sig-
niﬁcantly similar (1480 sample pairs in area 3 and 1090 sample
pairs in area 4). Among them, 96.61% (1467 sample pairs in area
3 and 1016 sample pairs in area 4, refer to Supplementary Table
S3 for details) were with two samples from the same source. On
the other hand, there were 4404 sample pairs with two
same-source samples in total but only 56.38% of them were con-
sidered as signiﬁcantly similar. Therefore, if two samples are
signiﬁcantly similar, they tend to be from the same source, but
samples from same source might not be signiﬁcantly similar.

3.6 Scoring function efficiency evaluation

As stated previously, each similarity score for a pair of metage-
nomic samples could be calculated in a liner time. Here, we
computed distance matrices of 10, 50, 100, 150 and 200 samples
randomly selected from the dataset ‘Database 1’ (Table 2) by
scoring function to test its speed. Results (sub-graph on left
top of Fig. 7) have shown that the running time had a linear
relationship with the number of sample pairs. For 200 samples,
the scoring function had been executed for 19 900 times and
could be ﬁnished in 1.5 min (Fig. 7). Thus, the running time is
quite fast, given the current scale of metagenomic samples. We
have also tested Meta-Storms system on a collection of more
than 10000 metagenomic samples (data not shown), and the
distance matrix could be computed within several hours. As far
as we know, Meta-Storms is one of the ﬁrst systems that could
handle such a large number of samples within a day’s time.

3.7 An application of Meta-Storms on human
microbiome samples
In this section for application test, Meta-Storms is applied on the

human microbiome from different sites and individuals. We used
all 60 samples of dataset Database 2 (Table 2) from three

different sites in human gut, palm skin and mouth of two indi-
viduals with different genders (Caporaso et al., 2011) to build a
metagenomic database. In this database, for each site on host,
there are 10 different samples. For these 60 samples in the data-
base, the similarity score of 1770 different sample pairs
[C(60,2) = 1770] and the pairwise distance matrix are generated
using our scoring function (Fig. 8A).

Based on this distance matrix, a phylogeny tree of samples
from each body site in the database has been created using
Phylip-ﬁtch (Makarenkov, 2001) (Fig. 8B, right part). From
which we could observe that samples were more diverse among
different sites on same host, rather than between different indi-
viduals. This result is consistent with the research conclusion of
Caporaso et al. (2011). It is also interesting to ﬁnd out that the
oral microbial community structures are more similar to those on
palm skin than those in gut, probably due to the fact that
Staphylococcus aurous is one of the dominant species both in
oral conditions and on skin (Hamady and Knight, 2009; Kong,
2011).

Then, we used all 120 samples of dataset Query 2 (Table 2),
which were collected from the same three sites of these two
people but not in the database, as queries to ﬁnd the best
matches in the database (Fig. 8B, left part). Results had correctly
identiﬁed the location from where the microbial community sam-
ples were collected, yet it was not very sensitive to host (Fig. 8B,
left part).Among the queries, 99.2% (119 out of 120)
were matched to the right sites, and 75.8% (91 out of 120)
were perfectly matched to the right sites of the right host.
This proved that the search accuracy of the Meta-Storms
method is very high. As regard to speed, the whole analysis
(from database creation to sample query) has taken <5 min.

3.8 Functional comparison of metagenomic samples

With the fast development of next-generation sequencing
(NGS) techniques, some of the whole genome sequencing-based
metagenomic sequencing projects had been conducted (Muegge

et al.,2011; Yang et al., 2012). With these data available, it was
now possible to proﬁle all functions in a metagenomic sample. In
such context, another measure similar to taxonomy-based beta
diversity could be measured: hierarchical functional diversity
[such as subsystems (Cayley and Holt, 1997)] of different sam-
ples. This measure could answer the fundamental question re-
garding the functional diversities among samples.

Previously, we have already mentioned the applicability of
Meta-Storms on comparing functional diversity of metagenomic
samples. In this part, we have tested Meta-Storms’ ability to
perform similarity search, which was conducted similar to the
taxonomy-based search, except that indexing and searching
were both based on functional hierarchy. We have selected func-
tional annotation data from metagenomic samples obtained
from a recent study on mouse gut microbiota (Faith et al.,
2011). We have selected the Escherichia coli samples from 36
mouse/diet period in total based on 13 mice [refer to (Faith
et al., 2011) for details]. Results have shown that the microbial
communities’ functional structures were not sensitive to different
hosts, as samples from different hosts could be clustered together
(refer to Supplementary Fig. S3 for more details). Yet these

functional structures were quite sensitive to different diet periods:
samples of third diet period were more conserved, whereas sam-
ples of fourth diet period were more diverse (refer to ‘The
functional diversity of different metagenomic samples’ in
Supplementary Material for more details). This might be
explained by the microbial communities’ exploitation or adapta-
tion for the diet over time.

As shown in these applications on real metagenomic samples,
because the WGS-based metagenomic studies have been more
and more commonly used, it is now possible to have a metage-
nomic database with both taxonomical and functional proﬁles of
metagenomic samples. The application of sample search and
comparison methods such as Meta-Storms could help to discover
the intricate relationship among samples, which would lead to
great enhancement of metagenomic data analysis and data
mining for a wider range of studies of microbial ecology.

4 CONCLUSION

With the fast accumulation of metagenomic samples and sequen-
cing data, their comparison becomes very important to illustrate
their similarities and differences. As such, the database search for
metagenomic samples is becoming more and more important.
However, current metagenomic data are not organized well
(thus they are only data repositories, but not yet modernized
and manageable database), and current metagenomic sample
comparison methods are generally based on pairwise compari-
sons (thus, only comparable in small-scale, and difﬁcult with
large-scale analysis) without efﬁcient index supporting.
Therefore, we have designed the Meta-Storms system as a
system for database creation, indexing and searching for similar
metagenomic samples. Meta-Storms is not only a database
builder and searcher, but a search-engine-based metagenomic
sample comparison system that could organize the database
well, and could perform quick and accurate search.

Although it is one of the ﬁrst systems of its kind, Meta-Storms
has already been proved to perform well in similarity search for a
large numbers of samples. Its main advantages include: ability to
handle large number of samples in an integrated system, fast
indexing and candidate retrieval, accurate scoring function for
comparison, etc.

First, Meta-Storms has advantages in system integrity: it can
take input of the 16 s rRNA pyro-sequencing data or WGS data,
thus is independent of any other method to retrieve the commu-
nity structure of the metagenomic samples. Additionally, the
database could be built based on more than 10 000 metagenomic
samples, making it one of the ﬁrst systems that could handle such
a large number of samples.

Second, its index is simple, yet quite fast and accurate in clus-
tering different samples. The fast speed comes out of the simple
categorization by only using phyla with high abundance as the
index key. Therefore, such indexing scheme would be useful, es-
pecially when there are many samples, for organizing samples in
a metagenomic database.

Third, for sample comparison, it was noted that signiﬁcance
tests such as the P—test (Martin, 2002) and the Fast UniFrac
replicated permutation become decreasingly useful as the depth
of coverage and the number of samples increase (Hamady et al.,
2010). However, although our methods based on scoring

function does not need complex computation, it is as accurate as
those based on signiﬁcance tests with fast speed. Therefore, our
scoring function might be a better alternative to the traditional
time-consuming signiﬁcance test.

Functional comparison of different metagenomic samples
have also shown the ability of Meta-Storms to accurately and
efﬁciently identify microbial communities of similar functions,
and also help to shed new light onto the functional diversity of
the microbial communities. With the advance of WGS of meta-
genomic samples, it is anticipated that the functional proﬁling
and comparison of metagenomic samples would become more
and more important, for which Meta-Storms would be of greater
importance.

In conclusion, Meta-Storms would provide key methods for
metagenomic projects to facilitate the research in metagenomics,
and more broadly, microbial communities, including Human
Microbiome Projects, Earthmicrobiome Project, etc.

Current Meta-Storms method could be updated in index efﬁ-
ciency and consistence. First, current indexing strategy is suitable
for searching samples with dominant genomes (which are always
the case) against large database. For query samples without
dominant phyla, or when samples in the database are quite simi-
lar to each other (e. g. from the same source), we recommend the
exhaustive search for high reliability rather than indexed query.
Second, the statistical model for the database search could be
improved by integrating a mixture model. By these reﬁnements,
it is expected that the overall performance of Meta-Storms could
improve further. All of these issues are expected to be addressed
in our future work.

Abstract

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in general biological processes and
diseases pathogenesis. Identifying miRNA target genes is an essential step to fully understand the
regulatory effects of miRNAs. Many computational methods based on the sequence complemen—
tary rules and the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles have been developed for this purpose. It
is noted that there have been many sequence features of miRNA targets available, including the
context features of the target sites, the thermodynamic stability and the accessibility energy for
miRNA—mRNA interaction. However, most of current computational methods that combine
sequence and expression information do not effectively integrate full spectrum of these features;
instead, they perceive putative miRNA—mRNA interactions from sequence—based prediction as
equally meaningful. Therefore, these sequence features have not been fully utilized for improving
miRNA target prediction.

Results: We propose a novel regularized regression approach that is based on the adaptive Lasso
procedure for detecting functional miRNA—mRNA interactions. Our method fully takes into account
the gene sequence features and the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles. Given a set of
sequence features for each putative miRNA—mRNA interaction and their expression values, our
model quantifies the down—regulation effect of each miRNA on its targets while simultaneously
estimating the contribution of each sequence feature to predicting functional miRNA—mRNA
interactions. By applying our model to the expression datasets from two cancer studies, we have
demonstrated our prediction results have achieved better sensitivity and specificity and are more
biologically meaningful compared with those based on other methods.

1 IntrOducuon molecules exert their function through interacting with their mRNA

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules (con- targets. The base paring of the miRNA With the 3’ -untranslated re-
taining about 22 nucleotides) that play important gene—regulatory gion (3’-UTR) of their targets triggers the mRNA degradation and/
roles in plants and animals (Bartel, 2004). These small RNA or protein translational inhibition (Fabian et 61]., 2010; Huntzinger

and Izaurralde, 2011). Since their initial discovery, miRNAs have
emerged as key gene regulators in a variety of fundamentally import-
ant biological processes, including cell proliferation and apoptosis
(Iorio and Croce, 2012; Lee et al., 2011). Dysregulation of miRNA
function has played a role in the pathophysiology of many human
diseases, particularly in cancer (Calin et al., 2004; Chen et al.,
2014)

MiRNAs represent one of the most abundant classes of gene—
regulatory molecules in mammals. There are more than 2000 dis—
tinct miRNAs identified in human (Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones,
2011). It is also demonstrated that >60% of human mRNAs are
subject to miRNA—mediated post—transcriptional regulation
(Friedman et al., 2009). Among the miRNA—mRNA regulatory rela-
tionships, multiple miRNAs are often required to act cooperatively
to target the same gene. On the other hand, a given miRNA is able
to pair with up to hundreds of genes (Selbach et al., 2008). This
multiplicity effect poses a great challenge to comprehensively depict
a functional miRNA—mRNA regulatory network. Over the past dec—
ade, many miRNA algorithms and tools have been independently
developed to study the miRNA—mRNA interactions, including
TargetScan (Friedman et al., 2009; Garcia et al., 2011; Grimson
et al., 2007; Lewis et al., 2005), PicTar (Krek et al., 2005),
MicroT_CDS (Maragkakis et al., 2009), miRanda (Betel et al.,
2008), RNAhybrid (Kruger and Rehmsmeier, 2006), and TargetS
(Xu et al., 2014a). The majority of these algorithms are based on
several well—known rules derived from important sequence features
of target recognition, including sequence complementarity (seed
matching), thermodynamic stability, target site context, target site
accessibility and the degree of site conservation (Friedman et al.,
2009; Grimson et al., 2007; Kertesz et al., 2007; Lewis et al., 2005).
Despite these efforts, the number of false predictions obtained from
these computational methods is still high, and more importantly,
these predictions only represent static miRNA—mRNA interactions.
Therefore, expression profiling has been proposed as a complemen—
tary information resource to study dynamic miRNA—mRNA regula-
tory relationship. As a result, many approaches tend to integrate this
expression information into sequence—based target predictions to ob—
tain more reliable miRNA targets. These methods assume that the
expression levels of a given miRNA and its targets are inversely cor—
related due to the down—regulation effect of miRNAs on its targets.
For example, GenMiR—l——l— computes the probabilities of having an
interaction between a miRNA and its putative targets in a Bayesian
framework (Huang et al., 2007). A Lasso—based method enforces a
sparseness solution and combines the RISC availability with
sequenced—based prediction and expression data (Lu et al., 2011).
Another related method named TaLasso includes non—positive con—
straints in their regularized least squares (Muniategui et al., 2012).
However, when integrating the sequence—based predictions on
miRNA—mRNA interactions with the expression data, these
approaches perceive these putative interactions as equally meaning-
ful, as long as they meet certain criteria defined by the sequence—
based prediction rules. Therefore, these approaches neglect the full
spectrum of available sequence features of miRNA targets. A recent
study addresses this problem to some degree by combining sequence
context scores and conservation information with expression pro-
files. This model is specifically designed for miRNA—overexpression
experiments to identify targets of a particular miRNA in different
cell conditions (Li et al., 2014).

In this article, we propose a novel regularized regression approach
for detecting miRNA—mRNA interactions. Our approach takes into
account the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles from matched
samples while incorporating sequence features of putative targets.

Beside the seed match rule between a miRNA and its targets, we use
three additional features: (i) Thermodynamic stability, measured by
the hybridization energy between a miRNA and its candidate target
sites. For a successful hybridization, the binding energy AGhybrid must
be thermodynamically favorable, i.e. negatively valued (Rehmsmeier
et al., 2004); (ii) Target site accessibility, which is energetically meas—
ured by AAG, the free energy required to unpair the nucleotides on the
target site to make the target accessible. It includes two components:
AGhybrid and AGdismption. The latter is the cost of altering the local
structure of the mRNAs, which also prefers to be negatively valued
(Kertesz et al., 2007); (iii) Target site context. Several context features
are related to miRNA targeting and have been found to boost the tar—
get site efficacy (Garcia et al., 2011; Grimson et al., 2007). Among
these features, the local AU content near the target site, the target pos—
ition within 3’ UTR, the residue pairing at 3’ end of miRNA, the tar—
get—site abundance, and the seed—pairing stability are used as the
determinants to generate the target site context score by the
TargetScan algorithm (Garcia et al., 2011; Grimson et al., 2007). For
different types of target sites, the contribution of these context features
are calculated using different sets of regression parameters deduced by
the algorithm. The combined context value, named the Context Score
is then calculated as the sum of the contribution of these context fea—
tures, plus the mean repression level of the targets with the corres—
ponding seed match type. To ease the implementation of our method,
we use the context score directly as an additional sequence feature.
Our algorithm only quantifies the miRNA—mRNA interactions from
an initial set of putative miRNA—mRNA pairs that were obtained
from TargetScanHuman. Therefore, it works as a filter to the
TargetScanHuman prediction results, and is expected to achieve a bet—
ter accuracy by combining these sequence features and the expression
data of miRNAs and mRNAs together. Through real data application,
we have demonstrated that our method has achieved better sensitivity
and specificity in predicting miRNA—target interactions, and the pre—
dicted targets are more biologically meaningful than other methods
we compared.

2 Methods

2.1 Mathematical model

Given an expression dataset corresponding to totally G mRNAs and M
miRNAs in N samples, we let vectors x]- : [Kl-1, x12, . . . , xjN] and
2k: [zk1, Zkz’ . . . , sz] represent the expression levels of mRNA j and
miRNA k, in samples 1 to N, respectively. Let cjk be an indicator vari—
able whose value is 1 if mRNA j is a putative target of miRNA [a pre—
dicted in existing sequence databases and 0 otherwise. Then, a linear
relationship between the expressions of each mRNA j and the K
miRNAs is assumed and it is represented by the following linear model,

K
x,- = Zpikakzk + e,- (1)
k=1

where 8,- is a standard Gaussian noise, and ﬂik represents the degree
of regulatory effect for each miRNA—mRNA interaction.
Considering the down—regulation effect of miRNA, ﬂjk is preferen-
tially a negative value. We further assume that x,- are standardized
and consider a model without intercept. Within this context, the
goal of study is to find a subset of miRNAs that regulate each
mRNA with ﬂ < 0.The number of miRNAs that putatively regulate
an mRNA is often larger than the number of samples, which pos—
sibly results in a high—dimensional model selection problem. To en—
sure proper estimation of parameter ﬂ, a L1 penalized least square
estimator, known as the Lasso technique has been widely adapted as

a model selection method (Cao et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2011; Wang
et al., 2013). With the nature of sparse solution of Lasso, most of
these regression coefficients ﬂ shrink to 0 and the nonzero ones will
be fully recovered. Therefore, an L1 norm constraint on the coeffi-
cients is enforced in the model as the following:

. 1 K K
mln{§ llxi — Zﬂjk-Cjk-Zkllz + 4i: |5jk- ﬂ jk-Cjkl} (2)
k=1 k=1

subject to ﬂjk g 0, for k = 1,2, . . .K, where 2,- determines the degree of
regularization of nonzero ﬂjk, and K is the total number of miRNAs
in the dataset. The scale parameters (Sjk E [0, 1] are usually fixed as
unit one. Non—positivity constraints are added to ensure that the solu—
tion includes only negative relationships between mRNA and miRNA
expressions. This is a convex problem and thus, the local minimum
found by the algorithm is also guaranteed to be the global minimum.

To incorporate the prior knowledge of sequence features, we
propose to automatically learn the scale parameter (3 from data. We
define 5jk as a weighted sum of sequence features on the interaction
between the jth mRNA and the lath miRNA. i.e.

5.1. = Z wtfik (3)
t

where ftjk is the tth feature for the interaction between mRNA j and
miRNA 12. Because we are interested in the relative contributions of
different features, we further add the constraints that Eta), : 1
with constraint on the weights of each feature cot Z 0.

In an adaptive Lasso solution, the scale parameter (Sjk further re—
fines the degree of regularization of nonzero ﬂjk according to the
prior knowledge of each putative miRNA—mRNA interaction.
Recall that the Lasso estimates can be interpreted as maximum a
posteriori (MAP) estimates under Laplace priors (Tibshirani, 1996;
Wang et al., 2013), similarly, we compute the MAP estimates of
ﬂ under the adaptive scale parameter in a Bayesian framework.
Specifically, the conditional probability of ﬂ given the scale param—
eter has the following form:

P(ﬂjk|5jka Iii) = eXP(_4“/'5jklﬂjkl) (4)

1
Z(2,-5jk)
It refers to a Laplacian prior with mean equal to 0 and the scale par—
ameter related to (Sik. Z(2,-5jk) is a normalization factor and it can be
easily derived as the exponential integral equal to 2/2i5jk(Lee et al.,
2010). Our objective is to compute the MAP estimate of ﬂ and to
simultaneously estimate the feature weights to with the following op—

timization problem

. 1 K K K
m1n{2  — Zﬂik-Cik-Zkllz ‘l‘ 4Li::l511<'ﬂik'cik| + ZlOga/iiéjﬂ}
k=1 k=1 (€21
(5)

The model can be illustrated as a network in Figure 1. This opti-
mization problem can be solved by an iterative algorithm which (i)
minimizes the equation over ﬂ by fixing a); and (ii) minimizes the
equation over a) by fixing ﬂ iteratively until convergence (Lee et al.,
2010). Both sub—problems are convex and they can be solved effi—
ciently via an interior—point method and a gradient descent method,
respectively. When compared with other convex quadratic pro—
grams, the interior—point method we implement here uses a precon—
ditioned conjugate gradients algorithm to compute the search
direction, which lends itself to efficiently solve large—scale L1—regu—
larized least—squares problems (Kim et al., 2007).

2.2 Selection ofthe L1—penalty parameter

In the Lasso framework, the regularization parameter 2 controls the
sparsity of the selected model and its possible value often falls in the
interval [0, ﬁrm], where

A?“ = 2 - mgx |(Xj -zE)I (6)

However, due to the scale parameter (3 in the adaptive Lasso, if“ is
usually greater than the predefined value in lasso. The optimal value
of 2,- can be selected based on cross—validation. There are two ways
to select 2): the global and the local parameter tuning methods. The
global tuning method first identifies the maximum value of the L1
penalty where the optimal solution is a null vector for all the
mRNAs, and then decreases the penalty gradually by searching
through all the possible solution space, so it selects a general regular—
ization parameter for all the mRNAs. For the local tuning method,
it computes 2,- independently for each mRNA. It has been noted that
the global tuning method performed better in selecting miRNA—
mRNA interactions from the whole set of putative interactions than
the local tuning method (Muniategui et al., 2012), so the global tun—
ing method is chosen in our implementation.

2.3 Pre—processing of sequence features

As previously stated, we extract three sequence features for each of
the putative miRNA—mRNA pairs. We obtain the context score of
target sites from TargetScanHuman (release 6.1). We also calculate
the total hybridization energy (AG) and accessibility energy (AAG)
for each miRNA target pairing. All of these three features yield
negative values when functional miRNA targeting occurs. The
smaller the value obtained from the formation of miRNA—target du—
plex, the more likely it suggests a functional target miRNA binding.
To accommodate to our adaptive Lasso framework, we transform
each of the features to a positive value in the following form:

1

jk tran :si moid b >l< jk :—.,
M > g (.f.>1+exp(_bt*ﬂk)

(7)
where ftjk represents the tth feature for the mRNA j and miRNA
[a pair. In this data pre—processing step, we include an extra param—
eter, bt, where bt is a scale factor for the tth feature and is larger than

zero. Therefore, the transformed features will keep their original
rankings and fall into the same range (0, 1/2). When the scale param—
eter approaches to infinity, the transformed feature values tend to be
indistinguishable and will approach to 0. In this case, we would lose
the informativeness of sequence features to the scale parameter. The
same problem occurs if the parameter b is too small, where all trans—
formed feature values will be close to 1/2. Therefore, an appropriate
value of b would be critical for variable selection in the adaptive
Lasso procedure. In the practical implementation of this study, the
parameter is tuned for each feature set individually to achieve an op—
timal performance of the model.

2.4 Expression data collection

The first dataset, referred as Multi Class Cancer (MCC) dataset, has
been used to evaluate both the GenMiR—l——l— and the TaLasso meth—
ods. The dataset is composed of 88 paired normal and tumor sam-
ples, where 21 samples are from normal tissues and the rest are
obtained from tumor tissues, spanning 1 1 different tumor types. The
mRNA expression was measured with microarray Hu6800 and
Hu35KsubA GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)
(Ramaswamy et al., 2001), while the miRNA expression (GSE25 64)
was obtained using the ﬂow cytometry technique (Lu et al., 2005).
The final compiled expression data used in GenMiR—l——l— and
TaLasso consist of 114 human miRNAs and 16 063 mRNAs.

The second dataset is a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) dataset
downloaded from TCGA Data Portal (https://tcga—data.nci.nih.gov).
It consists of matched miRNA and mRNA expression data from
miRNA—seq and RNA—seq experiments, respectively. The informa—
tion on patient survival outcome was also obtained and mapped
based on the patient ID. The dataset includes 123 patients, among
which 50 patients were alive at the time of last follow—up.

2.5 Methods evaluation

2.5.1 Experimentally validated targets

To evaluate our model, we downloaded experimentally validated
miRNA targets from the miRTarBase as the gold standard.
MiRTarBase 4.5 includes 14 659 experimentally verified miRNA—
mRNA interactions between 358 miRNAs and 8400 target genes in
human (Hsu et al., 2014). These interactions have been validated by
low—throughput assays including reporter assay and Western blot, or
high-throughput transcriptomic experiments, such as microarray
and pSILAC experiments. The sensitivity and specificity of the pre—
diction method were systematically evaluated by the receiver operat—
ing characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC),
using the ROCR package in R (Sing et al., 2005).

2.5.2 Gene ontology enrichment analysis

We extracted the Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO—BP) anno-
tations from the Gene Ontology Annotation database. The GO
terms with less than five genes or with no biological Data available
were removed, giving totally 2321 GO—BP terms. We examined the
GO categories enrichment for the predicted targets of each miRNA
in each prediction method. The GO enrichment P—values were calcu—
lated by the hyper—geometric test, subject to the False Discovery
Rate (FDR) control by Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) multiple test—
ing procedure. The GO terms with FDR< 0.1 were considered as
significantly enriched by predicted miRNA target sets.

2.5.3 Examining the clinical relevance of predicted targets
As an additional evaluation metric, we examined whether the predicted
miRNA targets were biologically meaningful by analyzing the

correlation between their gene expression profiles and the samples.
Specifically, for the MCC dataset, we examined the association be—
tween the expression levels of each target gene with the tumor samples.
The signal—to—noise (S2N) statistics was obtained for each gene, as in a
previous study (Ramaswamy et al., 2001). Here, the S2N of each gene
was calculated as (ummor — unormal)/(0'tumor —l— anormaj), where u and 0'
represent the mean and standard deviation of expression levels of each
gene, respectively. The permutation test was then used to calculate
whether the gene is a statistically significant tumor marker. 1000 per-
mutations of the sample labels were performed on the dataset, and the
S2N value was recalculated for each gene in each permutation. The
gene is considered to be statistically significant if the observed S2N
value exceeds the permuted ones at least 99% of the time (P g 0.01).

For the HCC dataset, since we have the patient clinical informa-
tion available, we examined whether the targets were strongly asso—
ciated with patient survival outcome. For each of the target, we
divided the patients into two equal groups based on their expression
values: the high—expression group and the low—expression group. We
used the ‘Survival’ package in R to calculate the Kaplan—Meier sur—
vival curved. For each gene, its statistical significance was deter—
mined with the BH multiple testing procedure for the P—values
obtained from log—rank test. The genes with FDR < 0.2 were con—
sidered as having significant association between their expression
values and the liver cancer patient outcome.

2.5.4 Comparison with other methods

We first compared the performance of our adaptive Lasso (named
AdaLasso) method with six other methods by evaluating their sensi—
tivity and specificity according to the overlap between the predicted
targets and the set of experimentally validated targets in
miRTarBase. Among the six methods, GenMiR—l——l— (Huang et al.,
2007), Lasso (Lu et al., 2011) and TaLasso (Muniategui et al.,
2012) combine the sequence—based predictions and expression pro—
files, but neglect the full spectrum of sequence features. For the other
three methods, the Context Score from TargetScan, the hybridiza-
tion energy (AG), and the accessibility energy (AAG) are based on se—
quence information alone and do not consider expression data.
Therefore, the miRNA—mRNA interactions predicted by each of the
methods were ranked by their corresponding feature values, with
the lowest value ranking on the top. According to the comparison
results, we picked the best—performing sequence—based method, and
then evaluated the targets predicted from this method and those
from the expression—based methods by examining their clinical rele-
vance (as described in detail in Section 2.5 .3).

3 Results

3.1 Expression datasets

We applied the AdaLasso method on two datasets composed of
miRNA and mRNA paired expression data. With a preprocessing
step, the overlap between the MCC dataset and the predicted targets
by TargetScanHuman 6.1 yielded totally 65 081 putative miRNA—
mRNA pairs between 104 miRNAs and 9559 mRNAs (Muniategui
et al., 2012). Among them, 83 miRNAs with 1244 miRNA—mRNA
pairs have biological verifications in the miRTarBase. For the HCC
dataset, the intersection of the data with the predicted targets by
TargetScanHuman yielded a final dataset with 207 515 putative
miRNA—mRNA interactions between 170 miRNAs and 17 201
mRNAs. Among them, 102 miRNAs with 2470 miRNA—mRNA
interactions have been experimentally validated, as listed in the
miRTarBase.

3.2 Adaptive Lasso performs better on experimentally
validated miRNA targets recovery
As a commonly applied penalty for variable selection, adaptive
Lasso could perform differently depending on the choice of regular-
ization parameter 2. In addition, the feature transformation will de—
termine the magnitude of the feature values, which in turn regulate
their corresponding Lasso penalty in the model. Therefore, the fea—
ture transformation is critical to the variable selection problem. We
tuned the regularization parameter 2 and the scale factor b simultan—
eously using the two—dimensional cross validation technique for
each feature set individually. Specifically, we applied leave—one—out
cross validation to test the parameter values. The optimal 2 and b
corresponding to the minimum square error (MSE) in testing sam—
ples were selected as tuning parameters. Based on the MSE results,
the optimal parameter b was obtained as 6.5, 0.1 and 0.2 for the
context score, AG and AAG features, respectively. The difference of
scale factors among the three features may be explained by the
ranges of their corresponding feature values. We have found the val—
ues of AG and AAG are scattered away from zero, and the values of
context scores are more concentrated and closer to zero. Therefore,
the context score feature utilizes a larger scale factor to transform its
values to a range comparable to that of the other two feature sets.
Given the tuning parameters, we can use the Equation (5) to ob—
tain values of ﬂ and w, where ﬂ quantifies the relationship between
each pair of miRNA and mRNA, and 0) indicates the weights of
each feature. To assess the performance of our approach, we used
experimentally validated target pairs from miRTarBase to examine
the sensitivities and specificities for our model and other well—known
methods. Correspondingly, we have calculated the ROC curves and
the areas under ROC curve (AUC) for the optimal set of parameter
(2, b). In MCC dataset, our AdaLasso approach yielded an AUC
score of 0.696 (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S1). For compari-
son, other methods that were based on sequence information only
(Context Score, AG and AAG), and those combined expression in-
formation with sequence—based prediction (TaLasso, Lasso and
GenMiR—l——l—) were also applied on the MCC dataset. Their

corresponding ROC curves are shown in Figure 2A, and the AUC
scores are listed in Supplementary Table S1. We found our
AdaLasso approach that combined three sequences features and the
miRNNmRNA expression profiles had superior performance than
the other methods according to the comparison of their sensitivity
and specificity. In particular, TaLasso, GenMiR—l——l—, and Lasso
yielded very low AUC scores of 0.537, 0.530 and 0.528, respect—
ively. Note that the existing databases on miRNA target information
are far from completeness. In addition, the miRNA regulation is dy—
namic and it is not clear to what extent the dynamic miRNA—
mRNA interactions align with the information in existing databases,
which may explain the low sensitivity and specificity obtained in
these expression—based methods that do not fully utilize the sequence
feature information. Although the Context Score method yielded a
high AUC score (0.641), its performance was inferior to ours. These
results indicate that combining the full spectrum of multiple types of
sequence features with miRNNmRNA expression data is critical in
improving the model performance on identification of miRNA—
mRNA interacting pairs. The same comparison was performed for
the HCC dataset. We observed similar results as those for the MCC
dataset, in that our AdaLasso method achieved the highest AUC
score than both sequence—based methods and the expression—based
ones (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S1). In addition, we note a
Leukemia dataset (LDS), available in GEO (GSE14834) was used to
evaluate the TaLasso approach. To obtain a more comprehensive
comparison, we included this dataset here for further evaluating the
performance of different methods on recovering experimentally vali-
dated miRNA targets. The results of using the LDS dataset were
consistent with those obtained from the MCC and HCC datasets
(Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1).

miRNA targets identified from each method according to their
scores: one candidate group contains the top 1000 miRNA—mRNA
interaction pairs with the highest prediction scores, and the other
candidate group contains 1000 pairs with the lowest prediction
scores. Their corresponding sequence features were compared based
on the cumulative frequency analysis. As shown in the Figure 3 for
the MCC dataset, the AdaLasso approach has the most differenti-
ated feature values between the high— and the low—scoring groups. It
is demonstrated the high—scoring miRNA—target interactions from
AdaLasso always have lower feature values than those in the low—
scoring candidate group, which is consistent with the well—known
miRNA targeting rules (Kertesz et al., 2007; Krek et al., 2005).
However, the results from TaLasso do not always follow this
inversed relationship. In fact, some target pairs in the high-scoring
group even have higher context scores than those in the low—scoring
group, which to some degree violates the rationale of functional
miRNA targeting. This may explain the relatively poor performance
of TaLasso compared with our method. For the HCC dataset, the
cumulative frequency plot analysis on high— and low-scoring inter-
actions groups also showed the largest difference of their respective
sequence feature values for AdaLasso compared with other methods
(Supplementary Fig. S2). We also compared the contribution of each
individual feature on our AdaLasso approach by examining the
learned feature weights of co. In the results, the three features (con—
text score, AG, and AAG) had similar weights (0.36, 0.33 and 0.31,
respectively). It agrees with the previous insights on miRNA target
predictions that the thermodynamic stability, site accessibility and
context score are all important for improving miRNA target predic-
tion (Wang et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2014b). For the HCC dataset, the
learned feature weights of a) are 0.35, 0.32 and 0.33 for context
score, AG, and AAG, respectively, which are comparable to their
values in the MCC data.

3.4 GO enrichment analysis

To further investigate the function of our predicted targets and the
potential miRNA regulatory roles, we extracted the GO—BP annota—
tions from the GO annotation, and examined the GO term enrich-
ment for the miRNA target sets obtained by TaLasso, GenMiR—l——l—
and our approach, respectively. The GO enrichment P—values were

 

calculated by the hyper—geometric test, followed by multiple hypoth-
eses testing correction. For each miRNA and each prediction
method, we examined the GO enrichment in the target gene sets pre—
dicted by the given method for the given miRNA. The GO terms
with FDR< 0.1 were considered as significantly enriched. For the
MCC dataset, GenMiR—l——l— yielded totally 400 significantly enriched
GO functional terms with FDR < 0.1, whereas TaLasso and our ap—
proach resulted in 440 and 468 significantly enriched GO terms, re—
spectively. For the HCC dataset, GenMiR—l——l—, TaLasso and our
approach obtained 451, 540 and 595 significantly enriched GO
terms, respectively. The comparison results indicate that the targets
predicted by our adaptive Lasso—based approach have more bio—
logically meaningful annotations.

3.5 Clinical relevance of top predicted targets

We also examined whether there is a strong association between the
gene expression profiles of targets and the samples. The results were
summarized in Table 1. For MCC dataset, we only identified 7% of
all genes that were differentially expressed between normal and
tumor samples by using the S2N metric (see ‘Methods’ section).
These genes were considered as statistically significant tumor

markers. We then extracted the top 1000 miRNA—mRNA pairs pre-
dicted by our AdaLasso method. Among the 85 6 unique genes from
these pairs, 22.8% of them can be considered as significant tumor
markers (P : 7.38E—35, chi—squared test). As the Context Score
method outperformed two other sequence—based methods (AG and
AAG) in recovering experimentally validated targets, we also exam—
ined the top 1000 miRNA—mRNA pairs predicted by Context Score
and found it yielded smaller percentage of significant tumor markers
compared with all the expression—based methods for MCC dataset
(Table 1). We note that the Context Score does not consider expres—
sion data, so it only represents static miRNA—mRNA interactions
and may not capture the dynamic miRNA regulatory effects in a
particular phenotype or condition. This may explain the small num-
ber of genes whose expression profiles are significantly associated
with tumor samples by the Context Score method. For the HCC
dataset, we also extracted the top 1000 interaction pairs predicted
by each method, and performed the survival analysis on the unique
genes from the top interactions. We found 13.2% of the top targets
obtained from our AdaLasso method demonstrated significant asso—
ciation between their expression values and patient survival out—
come. In contrast, only 11.4, 9.8, 8.7 and 11.3% of the top targets
from TaLasso, GenMiR—l——l—, Lasso and Context Score can be con—
sidered as having the significant association, respectively (Table 1).
As the control, we only found 2.9% of all genes included in the data—
set demonstrated the significant association between their expres—
sion profiles and the liver cancer survival outcome. These results
indicated that our AdaLasso approach outperformed others in ef—
fectively identifying clinically relevant targets.

4 Discussion and conclusion

In this article, we have proposed an adaptive form of Lasso for func—
tional miRNA—mRNA interaction prediction, using the full spec—
trum of sequence features and the expression profiles of miRNAs
and mRNAs. Our method is based on three assumptions: First, the
number of predicted interactions is small. This assumption is
ensured by the sparse solution of the linear regression problem.
Second, we assume miRNAs down—regulate their corresponding
mRNA targets. This assumption could lead to a potential problem
that the targets affected by translation repression only would not be
identified by our method. For such targets, the relevant miRNAs
might not inhibit the mRNA expression profiles, but would reduce
the protein levels (Selbach et al., 2008; Zhuang et al., 2015). It
would be more comprehensive to examine the changes at both
mRNA and protein levels if datasets are available. Third, the full
spectrum of sequence features can make a significant contribution
on improving target prediction. To validate this assumption, we
have compared the feature values in high—scoring miRNA-target
interactions with those in low—scoring ones. The results indicate the
notion of a positive support from sequence features in adaptive
Lasso procedure.

When compared with the existing computational methods that
integrate expression data with sequence rule—based prediction, our
method has demonstrated the utilities of three types of sequence fea—
ture information, including the context scores, the thermodynamic
stability and the accessibility energy of the target sites. Our method
based on the adaptive Lasso procedure automatically learns the
relative contribution of each type of sequence features and dynamic—
ally integrates the features into expression profiles, while optimizing
the expression support for predicting the miRNA—mRNA inter-
actions. This offers a suitable solution for a challenging problem on
how to integrate individual features for miRNA target prediction.

Most current miRNA target prediction tools tend to consider only a
single feature type, leading to different candidate sets of miRNA tar—
gets. According to the ROC analysis of predicted miRNA—mRNA
interactions on the experimentally—validated targets, the GO ana—
lysis and the clinical relevance of predicted miRNA targets, our
model outperforms other methods in real dataset applications. It has
been well known that plant miRNAs often have targets with perfect
or near-perfect sequence complementarity. In contrast, animal
miRNA target sites only exhibit partial complementarity (Axtell
et al., 2011). The distinct pairing requirements and target breadth of
animal and plant miRNAs suggest simpler target identification in
plants than that in animals. Therefore, our method proposed here
should not be used to predict miRNA—mRNA interactions in plants,
but can be broadly applied for miRNA target predictions in other
animal species.

Besides the three sequence features examined in our model, the
degree of target site conservation can also be used as an additional
sequence feature to represent the conservation of the target sites.
However, the coverage of this feature in existing databases is sig—
nificantly lower than the three features we used in this study.
Therefore, to achieve high coverage of prediction results, we chose
not to incorporate the target site conservation information in our
methods. We also note that, with years of intensive biomedical re—
search, a large amount of experimentally validated miRNA targets
information has been accumulated in available databases.
Therefore, the future work will focus on leveraging the prior
known knowledge of miRNA targets to improve the prediction ac—
curacy, since our adaptive form of regularized regression approach
is capable of efficiently incorporating data from different sources
into the model.

There has been increasing evidence that many miRNAs are gen—
erated as a family of related isomers that differ by a small number of
bases at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the miRNA, termed isomiRs. Current
sequence—based prediction programs only use single miRNA se-
quence, so they may underestimate the impact of miRNA isoforms
on target regulation (Neilsen et al., 2012). The expression of
isomiRs varies between cell types and tissues, indicating their func—
tional importance can be different among different cellular condi-
tions (Tan et al., 2014). With more expression profiles and the
sequence information of isomiRs available, we expect our method is
applicable for studying the miRNA—mRNA interactions at the
isomiR levels as well.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Chimeric RNA transcripts are generated by different
mechanisms including pre-mRNA trans-splicing, chromosomal
translocations and/or gene fusions. It was shown recently that at
least some of chimeric transcripts can be translated into functional
chimeric proteins.

Results: To gain a better understanding of the design principles
underlying chimeric proteins, we have analyzed 7,424 chimeric RNAs
from humans. We focused on the specific domains present in these
proteins, comparing their permutations with those of known human
proteins. Our method uses genomic alignments of the chimeras,
identification of the gene—gene junction sites and prediction of
the protein domains. We found that chimeras contain complete
protein domains significantly more often than in random data sets.
Specifically, we show that eight different types of domains are
over-represented among all chimeras as well as in those chimeras
confirmed by RNA-seq experiments. Moreover, we discovered that
some chimeras potentially encode proteins with novel and unique
domain combinations. Given the observed prevalence of entire
protein domains in chimeras, we predict that certain putative
chimeras that lack activation domains may actively compete with
their parental proteins, thereby exerting dominant negative effects.
More generally, the production of chimeric transcripts enables a
combinatorial increase in the number of protein products available,
which may disturb the function of parental genes and influence their
protein—protein interaction network.

1 INTRODUCTION

The splicing of mRNAs is an essential aspect of eukaryotic gene
expression. This process can occur in cis, within a single pre—
mRNA, or in trans, between two different pre—mRNAs; in the
latter case, chimeric transcripts are generated (Gingeras, 2009).
Chimeric transcripts can also be produced by other mechanisms,
including gene fusion (Li et al., 2008, 2009), recombination and
other mechanisms (Gallei et al., 2004; Gmyl et al., 2003). The
deﬁning property of a chimeric RNA transcript is a fusion of
transcripts from at least two discrete genes.

The pioneering observations evidencing the joining of sequences
from separate genes were made in trypanosomes (Sutton and
Boothroyd, 1986), though similar events have been shown to occur

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed

in nematodes (Krause and Hirsh, 1987) and higher eukaryotes (Li
et al., 2009). More recently, chimeric transcripts were demonstrated
also in ﬂies (McManus et al., 2010a, b). In the case of the ﬂy
mod gene (mdg4), the independently transcribed pre—mRNAs are
formed a chimeric transcript with exons from the sense and anti—
sense strands of the mod genomic region. Other genes in fruit
ﬂy incorporate both sense and antisense exons, such as lola genes
(McManus et al., 2010a, b). In the mosquito, chimeric transcripts
were found to involve internal exons from genes at different
chromosomal loci (Robertson et al., 2007).

In mammals, chimeric transcripts are frequently associated with
cancer (Lackner and B'ahler, 2008; Maher et al., 2009a, b). Indeed,
abnormal MYC mRNA transcripts, a ubiquitous feature of tumor
cells, typically involve one or more exons from another gene spliced
to exon 2 of MYC (Chen et al., 2005). Additionally, fusion genes
that arise from chromosomal rearrangements have been found in
an expressed sequence tag (EST) library (Hahn et al., 2004) and in
a more recent study, chimeric proteins were identiﬁed in different
human cell lines (Frenkel—Morgenstem et al., 2012).

The interesting empirical evidence of human chimeras made up of
two genes (Breen and Ashcroft, 1997) was supported in a subsequent
study of the human cholesterol acyltransferase—l (ACAT—1) hybrid
mRNA (Li et al., 1999), in which mapped the 5’ Untranslated
Region (5’ UTR) of this gene was mapped to Chromosome 7
and the remaining sequence to Chromosome 1 (Li et al., 1999).
Paired—end RNA sequencing of human cancer cell lines led to the
discovery of tissue speciﬁc converging, diverging and overlapping
mRNA chimeras (Djebali, 2010; Maher et al., 2009a, b). Finally,
high—throughput sequencing of fruit ﬂy mRNAs identiﬁed chimeric
transcripts with complex genomic architecture (McManus et al.,
2010a, b).

Although, a large variety of chimeras have been described at the
RNA level, there are still only a few examples in humans, where
it has been shown empirically by mass spectrometry experiments
that the chimeric RNAs produce corresponding chimeric proteins
(Frenkel—Morgenstern et al., 2012). Some examples of chimeric
proteins found in tumors, are those that result from recurrent
chromosomal translocations, which can be found in different patients
with the same tumor type (Mitelman et al., 2005). Although several
studies have addressed the potential inﬂuence of local sequence
features on such recurrence (Aplan, 2006; Mirault et al., 2006; Ortiz
de Mendibil et al., 2009), the design principles of chimeric proteins
still remain unclear, for examples the preferential incorporation of
a full protein domain from the parental protein.

To better understand the design principles underlying chimeric
proteins, here, we present an analysis of a data set of
7,424 human chimeric transcripts (Kim et al., 2006, 2010; Li
et al., 2009). Recently, the expression of 175 chimeras in this

data set was conﬁrmed by high—throughput RNA sequencing
(Frenkel—Morgenstem 61611., 2012). We focused on protein domains
present in the chimeric transcripts and compared their permutations
to those contained in protein coding transcripts generally found in
humans. We found that chimeras contain complete protein domains
signiﬁcantly more often than would be expected if gene or exon
splicing were assumed to be a random process. Speciﬁcally, we
show that AT—hook, GTP_EFTU, MHC, SH2, SH3, Terc, EF—h
domains and WD40 repeats are over—represented among chimeras.
Moreover, we discovered that some chimeras potentially encode
proteins with novel and unique combinations of domains. Given
the observed prevalence of entire protein domains in chimeras,
we predict that certain putative chimeras with missing activation
domains may actively compete with their parental proteins, thereby
exerting dominant negative effects. Interestingly, fusion proteins
produced by chromosomal translocations in cancers also incorporate
the tyrosine kinase (Terc), Runt, AT—hook (DNA binding), NUP
repeats (nuclear signals) and coiled coil domains. Therefore, we
propose that production of chimeric transcripts may produce active
competition with original proteins and produce dominant negative
phenotypes in cancer. Finally, it must be noted that chimeras
can drive diversiﬁcation of a given transcriptome offering the
opportunity to acquire novel functional proteins.

2 METHODS
2.1 Data sets

The data for chimeric transcripts was taken from ChimerDB (Kim 61 611.,
2006, 2010) and the study of Li et 611. (2009). In addition, we used the data
set of the chimeric junction sites covered by the RNA—seq reads from a
recent study (Frenkel—Morgenstem et 611., 2012). Only chimeric transcripts
involving two genes were included in our chimera data set, and chimeras with
a gap of one or more nucleotides in the junction site were excluded from
the analysis. In addition, we separated our chimera data set from known
fusion proteins catalogued in dbCRID (Kong et 611., 2011), an inventory of
fusion proteins produced by chromosomal translocations in human cancers
and other diseases. The GENCODE (Harrow et 611., 2006) and ENSEMBL
(Flicek e1611., 2011) databases were used, and to create the ‘all proteins’ data
set. To avoid bias in the analysis due to over—representation of identical
or similar sequences, we compared the protein sequences using BLAST
(Altschul e1611., 1997). When sequences were found by BLAST to be similar
with an E—value <10—3, only one representative was kept in the data set. In
addition, short protein coding regions, <100 amino acids, were excluded from
the analysis. Domains were deﬁned as in Pfam (Bateman et 611., 2004; Finn
etal., 2008; Gould etal., 2010) and SMART (Mulder etal., 2005). Finally,
for each protein or chimera, we created a list of all possible domain—domain
combinations. The basic units in our analysis are these domain pairs.

2.2 Fusion proteins in cancer

We used a data set combined from the study of Ortiz de Mendibil et 611.,
(2009) and the dbCRID database (Kong et 611., 2011), which incorporates
fusion sequences of gene—mapped translocation breakpoints in cancer from
the Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer (Mitelman
et 611., 2005). Sequences of fusion transcripts shorter than 100 amino acids
were excluded from the analysis and thus, we analyzed a total of 323 gene
fusions in which both partner genes contributed an annotated protein domain
to the chimeric fusion protein generated by the translocation. Most these
fusions (>60%) were reported in hematological tumors.

2.3 Random data sets and the null model

A random chimera data set was generated by randomly mixing and matching
known protein coding sequences to create ‘artiﬁcial’ chimeric transcripts,
and a set of 10,000 of these random chimeras was used in the analysis. To
test if the chimeras incorporate full protein domains, the null hypothesis
was that frequencies of full domains in the ‘real’ and randomly generated
chimeras are similar when these sets are compared. We used a null hypothesis
to test if certain domains are enriched in the chimeras and if they produce
unique combinations of domains, i.e. whether the frequency of the domains
is equivalent in the chimeras and in all human proteins when all the chimeras
are compared with all proteins.

2.4 Enrichment of the protein domains

To verify the functionality of protein domains, The Eukaryotic Linear
Motifs resource (ELM; Gould etal., 2010) was used. To recognize potential
membrane proteins participating in a given chimera, we used TargetP
(Emanuelsson 61611., 2007) and ELM (Gould et 611 ., 2010). The 20—t0p domain
frequencies in chimeras were considered for the over—representation analysis
of speciﬁc domains versus the domain frequencies in all the human proteins.
The standard error was calculated using the distributions of the domain
frequencies in chimeras and all proteins as follows:

STDerr = STD EV/x/N (1)

where N equals 20 (top domains) and STDEV was calculated as a standard
deviation of the absolute differences between the observed and expected
frequencies of 20—top domains.

An expected frequency for every domain was calculated using an
assumption that a domain can be owned from any of two parental proteins
and it calculated by the formula:

P (domain) 2 2 >l< P ALLPRTS (domain) (I — P ALLPRTS (d0main)>

+P3LLPRTS (domain) (2)

where P ALLPRTS (domain) is the observed frequency of the domain in a data
set of all human proteins. The domains were considered as over—represented
in the chimeras if their frequencies were at least two standard errors bigger
than the corresponding frequencies in all human proteins. The 20 most
common (20—top) domains were chosen for the analysis because all the other
domains had a frequency of <1% (Supplementary Material). These 20—top
corresponded to 69% of the domains identiﬁed in all proteins, and 61% of
those in all the chimeras.

2.5 Annotation of chimeras

The sequence similarities between the chimeric RNA transcripts and human—
genomic regions were identiﬁed using in—house software and the UCSC
BLAT search (Kent, 2002) to annotate the genes participating in each
chimera. Using information on known transcripts from ENSEMBL (Flicek
et 611., 2011) and an in—house Perl program, the aligned exons, introns
and untranslated regions in the chimeras were recognized. NCBI BLAST
(Altschul etal., 1997) was applied to delineate the parental protein domains
corresponding to the genomic regions contained within each chimeric
mRNA. All the domain annotation results were manually inspected. Finally,
WU BLAST (Lopez et 611., 2003) was employed to deﬁne more precisely
short or ‘strange’ genomic regions, as WU BLAST has proven most efﬁcient
when transcript composition is unknown (Elizabeth Cha and Rouchka, 2005).

2.6 Analysis of chimeric proteins translated in frame

To identify possible in frame translations of a given chimera, we translated
all the chimera transcripts in six frames. We ran UCSC BLAT search (Kent,
2002) and NCBI BLAST (Altschul et 611 ., 1997) and used ENSEMBL (Flicek
et 611., 2011) to identify a frame enabled correct translation of exons from
both proteins participating in chimeras. Thus, only the exons of two parental

genes, appearing in the sequence of ESTs, were used for the domain analysis
of the chimeras (Fig. 1). In our chimera data set, 1,643 chimeras had a correct
frame for two parental proteins that ensured a directed translation without
a stop codon at the junction site of chimeras. We analyzed this collection
separately and found an over—representation of protein domains, as in the
whole chimera data set.

2.7 Comparison of domain pairs

We carried out a paired Wilcoxon test for each collection of protein sequences
(Fay and Proschan, 2010), comparing the differences in the permutations of
protein domains within the domain pairs of all the chimeras with that of all
the human proteins, and that of all the chimeras against the random chimeras.
The average length of a speciﬁc domain was computed considering all the
proteins predicted to have this domain.

3 RESULTS

We surveyed all the functional domains in proteins encoded
by chimeric transcripts translated and we found that 27% of
chimeras tend to contain complete functional domains of their
proteins, signiﬁcantly higher than in the corresponding random
data set of chimeras (Wilcoxon test, P < 10ET21). We noted
that chimeras contain various well—characterized complete protein
domains (Supplementary Material), representing most protein
domains (69%) of those present in the GENECODE 3C (human)
database (Table 1). Remarkably, we found that the chimeras in
our data set were signiﬁcantly enriched in AT_hook, GTP_EFTU,
MHC, SH2, SH3, Terc, EF—h domains and WD40 (see ‘Results’
section below). These ﬁndings complement our earlier discovery of
enrichment in transmembrane domains among chimeras (Frenkel—
Morgenstem 61 611., 2012). Moreover, we found that that 30.2% of
chimeras conﬁrmed by RNA—seq reads in the study of (Frenkel—
Morgenstem 61 611. 2012) encode complete protein domains. Most
of the chimeras are weakly expressed transcripts and they are
very tissue—speciﬁc (Frenkel—Morgenstern 61 611., 2012). Given the
prevalence of entire protein domains in chimeras, we suggest that
certain chimeras may actively compete with the wild—type parental
proteins, especially transcription factors.

3.1 Domains from membrane proteins and receptors
in chimeras

The domains of membrane proteins and receptors, namely, MHC
and receptor tyrosine kinases catalytic domain (Terc) are enriched
in chimeras (P < 10E_5 ). Moreover, we noted that short coiled—coil
domains (<50 aa) are also signiﬁcantly enriched in human chimeras,
likely reﬂecting the enrichment of parental membrane proteins (B arr
and Short, 2003; De Matteis and Morrow, 2000; Short 61611., 2005).
These ﬁndings extend our previous observations that chimeras
incorporate transmembrane domains and signal peptides to change a
cellular localization of parental proteins (Frenkel—Morgenstern 61611.,
2012). Notably, 15% of chimeras conﬁrmed by RNA—seq reads
(Frenkel—Morgenstern 61 611., 2012) indeed incorporate coiled—coil
and MHC domains of the parental membrane proteins (Table 1).

3.2 EF-hand domains in chimeras

The ‘EF—hand’ (EFh) domain name is the Calcium (Ca)—binding
variant of a helix—loop—helix motif discovered in the structure of

parvalbumin, a small Ca—binding protein isolated from carp muscle
(Kretsinger and Nockolds, 1973). Subsequently, many other Ca—
binding proteins have been identiﬁed (Kawasaki and Kretsinger,
1994, 1995). To date, there are >3000 EFh—related entries in the
NCBI Reference Sequences Data Bank (Grabarek, 2006). Typically,
the role of proteins containing EFh motifs is to ‘translate’ a
regulatory signal into various functional responses (Grabarek, 2006).
EFh motifs always occur in pairs, forming an EFh domain.

We found a signiﬁcant enrichment of EFh domains among the
chimeras in our data sets (P < 10ET5). We noted that chimeras had
more than one EFh domain, with 20% having three or four domains,
supporting the premise that they are functional. Remarkably, some
chimeras incorporate Ca—binding domains from each of the parental
proteins, and thus, they have multiple EFh domains (Table 1).

3.3 WD40 repeats in chimeras

WD40 repeats of about 40 amino acid residues are found in a wide
variety of eukaryotic proteins (Andrade 61 611 ., 2000). WD40 proteins
play roles as adaptor and regulatory modules in various processes
including signal transduction, pre—mRNA processing, transcriptional
activation, cytoskeleton assembly and cell cycle regulation (Andrade
61 611 ., 2000). WD40 repeats form ,B—propeller structures, which act as
a platform for stable association between proteins. Additionally, the
WD40 repeat propeller structure is an adaptable module that can
recognize particular post—translational modiﬁcations (Stirnimann
61611., 2010; Xu and Min, 2011).

We found a signiﬁcant enrichment of WD40 repeats in chimeras
(P—value < 10ET5). In particular, 9% of chimeras conﬁrmed by
RNA—seq reads at the chimeric junction site incorporate WD40
repeats (Table 1). However, it is notable that the number of repeats
in chimeras is on average 1.3, as opposed to 6.1 in the parental
proteins (Table 1). This reduction in the number of repeats raises the
possibility that these domains are only partially folded and may be
non—functional, and thus, they may contribute to dominant negative
effects (see below) if they are fused into transcription factors.

3.4 DNA and GTP binding domains in chimeras

AT hooks are type of DNA—binding motifs with a preference for A/T
rich regions and found in the high mobility group (HMG) proteins
(Reeves and Beckerbauer, 2001) and others (Singh 61 611., 2006).
Among other functions, HMG proteins are also involved in the
transcription regulation of genes containing, or in close proximity
to, AT—rich regions. The AT hooks domains are enriched in chimeras
(Wilcoxon test, P < 10ET5) and incorporate with other functional
domains, which may inﬂuence the activity of parental proteins
especially transcription factors incorporated in chimeras.

Zinc ﬁnger proteins (ZFPs) are a category of DNA—binding
proteins that bind to DNA and RNA and other proteins through
a ‘ﬁnger—shaped’ fold stabilized by zinc ions (Brown, 2005;
Dhanasekaran 61 611., 2006; Hall, 2005; Johnston 61 611., 2006; Negi
61 611., 2008). In most organisms, ZFPs are located in the cell
nucleus, where they regulate the activity of genes by binding to
target nucleotide sequences. Each zinc ﬁnger domain (ZFD) consists
of 30 amino acids, which fold into a ,8,80(—structure, in which the Zn
ion stabilizes the conserved Cys2His2 or other residues (Brown,
2005; Dhanasekaran 61611., 2006; Hall, 2005; Johnston 61611., 2006;
Negi 61611., 2008). The target DNA—binding site for ZFDs primarily
comprises a speciﬁc three nucleotide sequence (Grover 61611., 2010).

Interestingly, our analyses predicted all different types of
ZFDs to be represented among chimeras: ZnF_A20, ZnF_C2C2,
ZnF_C2H2, ZnF_C2HC, ZnF_C3H1, ZnF_C4, ZnF_CDGSH,
ZnF_RBZ, ZnF_TAZ and ZnF_ZZ. Moreover, we noted that 8%
of human chimeras incorporate parental proteins that themselves
possess more than one type of ZFD (Table 1). Accordingly, chimeras
were found to typically contain up to ﬁve ZFDs, and have more
ZFDs ‘repeats’ on average relative to all human proteins, 2.1 versus
1.03 ZFDs, respectively. It has been speculated that a number of
ZFDs in tandem recognize longer DNA sequences (Alwin 61 611.,
2005; Beerli and Barbas, 2002; Beerli 61 611., 2000; Kim and Pabo,
1998; Liu 61611., 1997; Pabo 61611., 2001). Moreover, we found that
transcription activators or repressors were highly represented among
ZF proteins in chimeras (19.5%, P—value < 6.5E‘4). Taken together
with the aforementioned multiplicity of ZFDs in chimeras, these
ﬁndings suggest that chimeric zinc ﬁnger transcription activators
and zinc ﬁnger transcription repressors potentially recognize longer
DNA sequences.

3.5 Novel combinations of protein domains in chimeras

We compared the permutations of domain pairs in chimeras versus
those in all proteins. We found that most domain pair combinations
are represented in chimeras but also noted novel domain pairs,
including HLH (Helix—Loop—Helix) and Pfam:GTP_EFTU (GTP—
binding domain) as well as Pfam:Hydrolase_3 domain and
Pfam:Polyprenyl_synt, coiled_coil domain and ZnF_C2C2 and
others (Table 2). Notably, the domains participating in a novel
domain combination in a given chimera were found in multiple
ESTs from the two parental proteins (Table 2). Moreover, the same
order and amount of exons are incorporated in the chimera as found
in both parental proteins. Expression of the novel chimeras was
conﬁrmed at the RNA level by RNA—seq reads, with 4.1 chimeric
reads on average in different human tissues (Frenkel—Morgenstern
61 611., 2012). These observations support the premise that there are
speciﬁc design principles underlying the formation of chimeras.

3.6 Dominant negative effects

Mutated transcription factors and mutated proteins that function
as dimers/multimers have the potential to exert dominant negative
effects competing with the parental proteins (Fig. 2). Namely, if
a mutated protein has lost a particular activity but is still able to
form a multimer or bind DNA, it can antagonize the function of the
wild—type protein (Maki 61 611., 2008). Given the prevalence in our
chimera data set of entire DNA—binding domains in the absence of
transcriptional activation domains, we suspect that such chimeras
compete with the parental transcription factors, thus exerting
dominant negative effects (Fig. 2). In support of our hypothesis,
a chimera that comprises a ligand—dependent transcriptional factor,
the Peroxisome proliferator—activated receptor gamma—2 (PPARG2)
and the amino—terminal domain of the nuclear receptor co—repressor
(CoR) has already been shown to exert a dominant negative effect
(Suzuki 61611., 2010).

Based on our hypothesis, we predict that a chimera from
our data set, comprising the E2—oz transcription factor, TCF3
(Immunoglobulin enhancer—binding factor E12/E47) and the
Ribosomal protein, RPS19 (EST = ‘BC009346.1’) exerts dominant
negative effects. Although the full sequence of RPS19 is present,
encoding a known transcriptional repressor that is located in

Every domain combination is conﬁrmed by the putative chimeric ESTs from our data set. Potential function of the resulting chimera is proposed.

the cytoplasm and nucleus, and that can form homodimers and
heterodimers (Fig. 3A), only the DNA—binding domain of the
nuclear transcription factor TCF3 is incorporated in the chimera,
the activation domain of TCF3 is missing (Fig. 3A). Therefore, the
resulting chimera can potentially bind TCF3’s target DNA but it
cannot activate transcription and accordingly it could compete with
wild—type TCF3 to bind DNA (Fig. 3B).

Overall, around 14% of the chimeras in our data set have the
potential to exert dominant negative effects. We also noted changes
in the permutations of domain pairs among chimeras, particularly
when considering domains found in enzymes that function as
dimers. This ﬁnding suggests that such chimeric enzymes could
exert dominant negative effects, but when considering enzymes,
it is important to note that the ﬁnal phenotype would be strongly
dependent on the expression level of the chimeric protein. For
example, in the human data set (Li 61 611., 2009), a translocation
between the myeloid/lymphoid or mixed—lineage leukemia (MLL)
protein and guanine monophosphate synthetase (GMPS) produces a
chimera with potential to exert dominant negative effects. Typically,
MLL positively regulates the expression of target genes, including
multiple HOX genes (Li 61 611., 2005), but some MLL gene fusions
have been shown to exert dominant effects (Li 61611., 2005). GMPS

is an enzyme that functions as a homodimer, and although the
functional domain is missing in the chimera, the dimerization
domain is preserved along with the Zinc ﬁnger and PHD domains
(Fig. 3C). Therefore, the resulting chimeric enzyme can potentially
dimerize with the wild—type functional GMPS enzyme but interfere
with its function due to the non—functional part of MLL (Fig.
3D), and thus exert a dominant negative effect. Similarly, the
AML1/EVI—1 chimera generated by translocation has been shown
to exert dominant negative effects (Mitani, 2004) and the MLL/AF4
fusion product has been suggested to function as a dominant negative
protein (Domer 61 611., 1993).

We focused our analysis on chimeras that incorporate parts
of transcription factors (activators or repressors) as it has been
shown that even low expression of mutated transcription factors
can interfere with gene activation/repression. The abundance
of chimeras containing transcription factor among DNA—binding
proteins was determined to be (19.5%, P < 6.5ET6). Given the
prevalence of entire protein domains in chimeras, we predict that
even low expressed chimeras that incorporate the DNA—binding
domains of transcription factors but have lost activation domains
actively compete with the parental proteins, thus exerting dominant
negative effects.

3.7 Protein domains in cancer fusion proteins

Using the same prediction procedures, we identiﬁed the main
classes of fusion proteins resulting from translocations: the tyrosine
kinase (Terc) domains (5.7%), the Runt domain (4.5%), the AT—
hook DNA—binding domains (4.8%), the NUP repeats (6%) and
coiled—coil domains (18.5%). Interestingly, most of these domains
are DNA—binding domains or they incorporate nuclear signals.
Our ﬁndings indicate that only certain combinations of protein
domains are present in fusion proteins, forming non—random domain

combinations, and implying that such combinations are subject to
potential functional constraints (Ortiz de Mendibil 61 611., 2009).
As mentioned above, the signature of DNA—binding domains and
transcription factors can produce dominant negative phenotypes
(Fig. 3A and B).

4 DISCUSSION

Here, we show that chimeras are particularly enriched in eight types
of protein domains. In conjunction with our earlier study, our data
raise the possibility that chimeras result not only in altered cellular
localizations due to a sizable enrichment in transmembrane domains
(Frenkel—Morgenstern 61 611., submitted for publication), but also in
the acquisition of a number of other new functions.

Using the ELM resource, the position and length of each domain
within a given protein was assigned and annotated. Thus, the domain
composition and domain order relative to the protein sequence was
readily available for each protein, allowing us to identify unique and
novel domain combinations in chimeras. Of note, as many chimeras
have been evidenced by multiple ESTs (Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Material), we propose that some chimeras may be produced by
regulated trans—splicing and have functional advantages. Elucidating
the possible trans—splicing mechanisms, in humans, remains as a
promising ﬁeld of research.

In this study, we focused on chimeras ‘in—frame’ and chimeras
conﬁrmed by RNA sequencing experiments (Frenkel—Morgenstern
61611., 2012). For all chimeras conﬁrmed by RNA—seq and ‘in—frame’,
we predicted the protein domains they contained and compared the
permutations of domain pairs to those found in all proteins or in
random data sets. Using this approach, we identiﬁed novel domain
pairs that are unique to chimeras, which incorporate transcription
factors as parental genes. Given the fact that even low expression of
mutated transcription factors can interfere with the function of the
wild—type transcription factor, we propose that many chimeras exert
dominant negative phenotypes. Taking into consideration the protein
domains identiﬁed in the fusion proteins, we propose that dominant
negative effects of fusion proteins may be frequent in cancer.
Moreover, chimeras may inﬂuence the protein—protein interactions
of parental genes in the protein interaction network. Thus, chimeras
with domains from the highly connected proteins will produce
more consequences than chimeras from less connected proteins.
Taking in consideration, the recent ﬁndings on the highly expressed
genes incorporated in the human chimeras (Frenkel—Morgenstern
61 611., 2012), and the fact that highly expressed genes tend to have
more protein—protein interaction partners (Krylov 61 611., 2003), we
propose that chimeras can inﬂuence the protein—protein interaction
network of the parental genes.

Having validated the existence of chimeric proteins in eukaryotes,
we stress the need to take chimeric proteins into consideration when
carrying out experimental studies of protein cellular localization.
Moreover, the potential dominant negative effect of chimeras should
be taken into account when protein—protein interactions are studied.
Finally, we suggest that future studies investigate if chimeric RNAs
represent useful biomarkers for the early diagnosis of different
different cancers.

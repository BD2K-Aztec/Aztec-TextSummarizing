ABSTRACT

Motivation: Previous researches showed that phytoene synthase
(Psy) from Dunaliella bardawil is the first regulatory point in
carotenogenesis. We hypothesize certain interactions between the
environmental stress factors and the regulatory sequences of
Psy in D.bardawil (Dsty). Consequently, LA PCR-based genomic
walking approach was performed for isolation of psy promoter and
terminator, respectively. The obtained nucleic acid sequences and
the corresponding protein structure of Dsty were analyzed and
predicted using various bioinformatics tools. Finally, we presented
some hints for the regulation mechanisms of Dsty at the molecular
level according to the computed results.

Results: LA PCR-based genomic walking results showed that
the isolated sequences are the promoter and terminator of
psy, correspondingly. Computational analysis demonstrated several
candidate motifs of the promoter exhibiting hypothetic UV-B-,
norglurzon- and salt-induced characteristics, as well as some
typical domains universally discovered in promoter sequences, such
as TATA-box, CCAAT—box and GATA-box, etc. Furthermore, the
structure of Psy was also predicted and aligned along with many
counterparts at the protein level. Low homology of N-terminus
was found in D.bardawil, while a relatively conserved C-terminus
was predicted to be involved in the catalytic activity and substrate
recognization/binding. Phylogenic analysis classified the Dsty into
a cluster with other algae. These results implied that Psy may share
similar regulation mechanisms among algae with respect to their
C-termini; while the diversity in N-terminus among Psys, along with
the predicted inducible motifs in psy promoter from D.bardawil, may
confer the fine tuning differences between D.bardawil and other
algae.

Conclusion: By means of computer techniques, we found in
D.barawali that two interesting conserved motifs of psy promoter
may involve in UV—B, norglurzon and salt regulation correspondingly;
and that the diversity of Psy protein mainly lies in the N-termini among
algae. These results indicate some hints for regulation mechanisms
of carotenogenesis in D.bradawil.

1 INTRODUCTION

Carotenoids are a wide family of polyene pigments synthesized
by all plants, various algae and certain species of bacteria,
fungi and archaea (Goodwin, 1980). In photosynthetic organisms,
carotenoids carry out several essential functions, i.e. participating
in photosynthesis to protect the photosynthetic apparatus from
potential oxidative damage besides light harvesting (Demmig—
Adams and Adams, 1996; Siefermann—Harms, 1987). Animals
cannot synthesize carotenoids but may obtain them through
derivative pigmentation from diet (Olson, 1994). Some carotenoids
have vitamin A activity in humans; therefore, they are classiﬁed as
essential nutrients (Farré et al., 2010). Many researches show the
prevention and treatment properties of carotenoids against several
kinds of diseases, such as certain chronic disease (Landrum and
Bone, 2001), cardiovascular disease (Shaish et al., 2006) as well as
certain cancers (Michaud et al., 2000). These promoting properties
of carotenoid have attracted intensive interesting in carotenoid
biosynthesis and its commercial exploitation. So far, at least
700 carotenoids have been characterized from nature carotenoid
biosynthetic pathways involving in C30 and C40 isoprenoids (Feltl
et al., 2005).

In recent years, Dunaliella bardawil has received intensive
attention as a natural rich source of ,B—carotene, owing to its
capability to accumulate massive amount of ,B—carotene under stress
conditions such as high light density, high salt concentration and
nutrient starvation (Ben—Amotz et al., 1982). Many studies on
accumulation of ,B—carotene and phytoene have been conducted
to date (Ben—Amotz et al., 1987; Leon et al., 2005; Mogedas
et al., 2009; Muthukannan et al., 2010). For large production of
,B—carotene, the optimal conditions should be high UV—A intensity,
slightly alkaline pH, low NaCl concentration and moderate NaNO3
concentration (Mogedas et al., 2009; Muthukannan et al., 2010);
while UV—B and other photobleaching compounds could elevate
phytoene production, instead of ,B—carotene (Ben—Amotz et al.,
1987; Leon et al., 2005; White and Jahnke, 2002). Nevertheless,
these investigations were primarily focused on culture condition
optimization at physiologic and biochemical level, none of them
probed into the molecular mechanisms for carotenogenic regulation
in D. bardawil.

The hypothetic biosynthetic pathway of carotenoid in Dunaliella
is disproportional to synthesize various carotenoids such as
,B—carotene, neoxanthin, lutein and so on (Ye et al., 2008). The
most universal carotenoid biosynthetic pathway is the successional

reactions leading to the formation of ,8—carotene. The ﬁrst committed
step is a head—to—head condensation of two geranylgeranyl
diphosphate (GGPP) molecules to produce phytoene by phytoene
synthase (Psy) (Salvini et al., 2005). Subsequently, phytoene is
converted to lycopene through four desaturation reactions, and
,8—carotene is ﬁnally formed by two cyclization steps. Enzymes
involved are membrane—associated or integrated into membranes,
and Psy is considered to be the ﬁrst rate—determining point to control
the carbon resource ﬂux toward carotenoid synthesis (Shewmarker
et al., 1999). At present, many Psy cDNAs have been isolated
to investigate the regulation mechanisms controlling carotenoid
biosynthesis in plants and microalgae (Salvini et al., 2005; Yan et al.,
2005); however, most of them remain conﬁned to molecular cloning
and expression analysis. In D.bardawil, Psy is even merely cloned
and sequenced (GenBank: EU328287.1).

We hypothesize certain interactions between the environmental
stress factors and the regulatory sequences of Psy in D.bardawil
(Dsty), more speciﬁcally, the conserved motifs encompassing the
psy gene and the resulting diversity of protein structure caused by
the variation of amino acid sequence in comparison to other species.
Therefore, we isolated and cloned the promoter and terminator
of psy, and then analyzed the obtained nucleic acid sequences
and predicted the corresponding protein structure of Dsty using
various bioinformatics tools. Finally, we presented some hints for the
regulation mechanisms of Dsty at the molecular level according
to the computed results.

2 METHODS

2.1 Strains and culture conditions

Dunaliella bardawil cells, obtained from the Institute of Hydrobiology,
Chinese Academy of Science, were grown in deﬁned medium (Sheffer and
Avron, 1986) containing 2mol/l NaCl at 26°C under a 14/10h dark/light
cycle, and were collected at the log phase or late log phase. Escherichia coli
TOP10 was used as the host for the multiplication of plasmids.

2.2 Known sequence veriﬁcation

For validation of the psy sequence deposited at NCBI (GenBank:
EU328288.1), two pairs of overlapping primers (Table 1) were designed
according to the Psy mRNA sequence (GenBank: EU328287.1).

Total RNA was extracted from 6 ml of D.bardawil cells grown at the late
log phase using E.Z.N.A. Total RNA Kit II (OMEGA) following conditions
recommended by the manufacturer. First strand cDNA was synthesized
with Oligo dT—Adaptor Primer in a total volume of 10 ul, and subsequent
PCR ampliﬁcation of two cDNA fragments, with two pairs of speciﬁc
primes (Dbpsy—F and Dbpsy—inR; Dbpsy—inF and Dbpsy—R), respectively,
was fulﬁlled using an RNA PCR Kit (AMV) ver. 3.0 (TaKaRa) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. The PCR procedure to amplify the Psy cDNA
fragments is as follows: 95°C, 5min; 35 cycles of 94°C, 45 s; 60°C, 45 s;
and 72°C, 1min. The ampliﬁed fragments were cloned to pMD 19—T vector
(TaKaRa) and sequenced.

2.3 Genomic walking for isolation of psy promoter and
terminator

Based on the sequences of the psy gene of D.bardawil (GenBank: EU
EU328288.1), three gene—speciﬁc primers for cloning of psy promoter,
pSPl, pSP2 and pSP3, were designed (Table 1). Likewise, the primers
for isolation of psy terminator, tSPl, tSP2 and tSP3, are also shown
in Table 1. Genomic DNA of D.bardawil was extracted following the
method described by Yang et a]. (2000). Using Genomic Walking Kit

(TaKaRa), LA PCR—based genomic walking was performed to obtain
the psy promoter and terminator, respectively. The primary nested PCR
products were diluted to 1:100 with distilled water for subsequent
nested PCR reactions; all manipulations were corresponding with the
manufacturer’s protocol. Validation of putative psy promoter and terminator
were performed using primers Ptest For (Table 1) and pSP3 or primers tSP3
and Ttest Rev (Table 1), respectively. Sequence analysis was performed
using Blast Software (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), promoter predictions
software PlantPAN (http://plantpan.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/), CorePromoter
program (http://rulai.cshl.org/tools/geneﬁnder/CPROMOTER/) for

Poly (A) Signal Miner (http://dnafsminer.bic.nus.edu.sg/) and RibEx
(http://132.248.32.45/cgi—bin/ribex.cgi).

2.4 Bioinformatics analysis and phylogenetic
construction

Psy splicing pattern was predicted through NCBI Splign (http://www
.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/splign/splign.cgi?textpage=online&level=fonn)
and GENSCAN (http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi—bin/portal.py?form=genscan).
Component analysis of psy was calculated using DNAStar software 7.1.0.
Physical and chemical characteristics of Dsty were analyzed by ProtParam
tool (http://expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). Subcellular localization
presumption was performed using WOLF PSORT (http://wolfpsort.org/).
Conserved domains in Dsty were detected using the Conserved Domains
Search tool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi).
Secondary structure was predicted via the PSIPRED server (httpz/lbioinf
.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/); 3D structure was constructed using 3D—JIGSAW
(http://bmm.cancerresearchuk.org/~3djigsaw/). Multiple alignments among
similar enzymes were conducted using Clustal X 1.83. Phylogenetic and
molecular evolutionary analysis of the amino acid sequences of different
Psys were conducted using the Neighbor Joining method and the molecular
evolution genetics analysis (MEGA) software, version 4.0.2.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Isolation and sequence analysis of the full-length
Dsty cDNA

The Psy template deposited at NCBI comes from direct submission
without any support of report hitherto, which necessitates the
validation work before genomic walking. To this end, RT—PCR

was performed and two cDNA fragments, 555 bp and 741 bp in
length respectively, were obtained with overlapping primers Dbpsy—
F/inR and Dbpsy—inF/R, correspondingly (Fig. 1a). Sequencing and
sequence assembly results fed back a complete full—length cDNA of
Dsty (GenBank: EU328287.1, 1275 bp in length), which validates
the psy gene deposited at NCBI (GenBank: EU328288. 1) indirectly.

3.2 Isolation of the promoter and terminator of Dsty

Three candidate promoter fragments of the third nested PCR were
puriﬁed and sequenced (Fig. 1b). Sequence analysis by BlastN
found that both the 3763 bp and 2975 bp fragments possess identical
regions (130 bp in length) as expected with the 5’—end of psy.
Comparison of the sequences showed that the 3763 bp fragment is
the extension of the shorter one. Likewise, a putative terminator
fragment shares 184 bp identical nucleotides with the 3’ —end of
psy as intended (Fig. 1c). The AGE and sequencing results further
validate the hypothetic promoter and terminator (Fig. 1d). These
results suggested that the obtained sequences are the upstream and
downstream UTR of psy, correspondingly.

3.3 Computational analysis of promoter and
terminator of Dsty

BlastN search found that the obtained sequences have great
homology with the 5’ — and 3’ —end of psy gene, respectively.
CorePromoter detection suggested that the TSS, ‘A’ marked in
Figure 2a, locates at 370 nt upstream of the initiator codon ATG
Five species (Arabidopsis, Maize, Rice, Tomato and other) were
selected when conducting transcriptional factor binding sites search
at PlantPAN server (Chang et al., 2008). The retrieval results showed
that the isolated promoter possesses many conserved motifs of
plant (Fig. 2a), e.g. GATA box at position +149, CCAAT boxes
widely found in eukaryotic genes, CGCG boxes with conserved

Fig. 2. Structure of full—length genomic DNA of psy including promoter
and terminator. (a) A 3633 bp length promoter was obtained and analyzed.
Several conserved motifs in addition to a CprG Island were identiﬁed
in the promoter: (1) TATABOXOSPAL, a typical box found in various
species (Zhu et al., 2002); (2) C8GARGAT, a A/T—rich binding site
for plant MADS—domain protein AGL15 (Tang and Perry, 2003); (3)

whose expression is induced by pathogen and salt through GT—1 like
factor (Park et al., 2004); (5) BOXIIPCCHS, Box II/G box found in the
parsley chs genes, essential for light regulation (Block et al., 1990); (6)

transcription factor TGA1, may be relevant to light regulation (Despres et al.,
2003). (b) Psy gene consists of six exons separated by ﬁve introns franked

sequences GCGCGC and ACGCGC at position —344 and +121
correspondingly. In addition, some regulatory elements were also
found, such as AFRAT involving in IAA regulation with consensus
sequence TGTCTC at position +341 (Goda et al., 2004), the
light—regulated elements G box (position —28) and ASF—1 binding
site (position +102), etc. Interestingly, two remarkable motifs
were also found in the promoter: box—L—like core sequences
(position —491, also named BOXLCOREDCPAL in Fig. 2a) and
GT—l motifs (position —85 and —2606). Previous researches has
implied a valuable application of UV irradiation for accumulating
carotenoids (Mogedas et al., 2009; Salguero et al., 2005; White
and Jahnke, 2002; Xue et al., 2005). Maeda et al. (2005) showed
that BOXLCOREDCPAL involved in UV—B irradiation regulation in
Daucus carota, therefore, such motif in D.bardawil might function
in a similar way. The GT—l box (also called GT1GMSCAM4, Fig. 2a)
might contribute to pathogen— and NaCl—induced expression of the
promoter (Park et al., 2004).

Both the Signal Miner and RibEx programs (Abreu—Goodger and
Merino, 2005) failed to detect any canonical poly (A) signal in
the hypothetic terminator. While a reverse translation attenuator
inside the last intron of psy was identiﬁed by RibEx at 322 bp
upstream of the TAA terminator codon, as is shown in Figure 2c.
Such disappointing results prompted us to clone and analyze psy
terminator sequence again, resulting in the same outcome (data not
shown). These results suggest that we may fail to isolate the genuine
terminator of psy in D. bardawil, or the psy terminator may possess
no canonical poly (A) signal.

3.4 Analysis of the genomic structure of psy

To further validate and elucidate the genomic structure of psy, NCBI
Splign (Kapustin et al., 2008) and GENSCAN (Burge and Karlin,
1997) were performed. Both servers returned a consistent result that

psy contains six exons separated by ﬁve introns (Fig. 2b). As shown
in Table 2, the GC content (%) of all six exons varies from 49.67%
to 60.54%, whereas the GC content (%) of the ﬁve introns ranges
from 47.2% to 54.95%. Although the introns of psy are ﬂanked
by conventional 5’ splice donor GT and 3’ splice acceptor AG
they appear to be lack of A+T—rich region, which characterizes a
canonical intron.

3.5 Physical and chemical characteristics of Dsty

The 424 amino acid peptide possesses a computed molecular weight
of 48.30 kDa, a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 9.16, and exhibits
an aliphatic index of 76.65. It contains 46 negatively charged
residues (Asp + Glu) and 57 positively charged residues (Arg + Lys)
with several hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions, as determined
by ExPASy (Gasteiger et al., 2003). In addition, it is classiﬁed
as an unstable protein with a considered methionine N—terminus.
WoLF PS ORT showed that Dsty may be situated in the chloroplast
(Horton et al., 2007).

3.6 Conserved domain and motifs in Dsty

Through the NCBI Conserved Domain Search (Marchler—Bauer
et al., 2009), the deduced amino acid sequence was speciﬁcally hit
by the trans—Isoprenyl Diphosphate Synthases (Trans_IPPS) which
included squalene and phytoene synthases. The prediction showed
that Dsty can be classiﬁed into the superfamily of IPPS and Class I
terpene cyclases. Six regions together forming Trans_IPPS were also
predicted in Dsty (Fig. 3): substrate binding pocket, Mg2+ binding
site, active site lid residues, catalytic residues and two aspartate—rich
sites (171—DELVD—175, 297—DVGED—301). In rat, the catalytic site
consists of a large central cavity formed by mostly antiparallel alpha
helices with two aspartate—rich regions (DXXXD) (Gu et al., 1998).
The catalytic residues involved in the reactions of forming squalene.
However, unlike squalene synthase, Psy does not require NADPH
for its activity (Gu et al., 1998). The two aspartate—rich motifs, along
with Tyr and Phe rich in the rest conserved regions, may involve in
condensation reactions in Dsty (Tansey and Shechter, 2000).

3.7 The advanced structures of Dsty

The secondary structure prediction run at the PSIpred server
(McGufﬁn et al., 2000) showed that the Dsty consists of 72.64%

detected a transmembrane region between amino acids 250 and 265.
The carboxy—terminus is possible in the cytoplasm; while the amino—
terminus, followed by a 37 amino acid signal peptide, locates in the
extracellular ﬂuid (Fig. 4).

Moreover, the tertiary structure of Dsty was also constructed by
3D—JIGSAW (Contreras—Moreira and Bates, 2002). The calculated
result shown in Figure 5 revealed that the single polypeptide chain
model covers 322 residues from 103 to 424 amino acids, which is
composed of 209 H—bonds, 20 helix elements and 32 turns. However,
unlike the secondary structure retrieved from PSIPRE server, there
is no strand element predicted using the 3D—JIGSAW server.

3.8 Homologous alignment and phylogenetic analysis
of Dsty

by ClustalX analysis revealed that the overall structure of the

Fig. 5. The tertiary structure of Dsty. Comparative modeling was
performed using 3D—JIGSAW. The structure was presented as ribbons
(the secondary structure elements) and wireframe using RasMol
version 2.7.2.1 .1. The oz—helix and ,B—turn regions of the putative protein
were indicated with cylinders (red) and bands (blue), respectively. The two
aspartate—rich motifs were colored by yellow, and the distinctive Asp residues
(171, 175, 297 and 301) were labeled and highlighted as spaceﬁll. The
N—terminus and C—terminus were also shown.

Trans_IPPS_HH domains has been conserved from bacteria to
higher plant (Figs 3 and 6), though all of the homologs aligned varied
considerably in their N-termini (data not shown). The functional
conserved domain may cover from 132 to 424 amino acids.

The BlastP search demonstrated that Dsty shares the highest
homology with D.salina at the protein level (79% identity and
87% similarity), 68% identity and 80% similarity with the
Haematococcus pluvialis counterpart, 69% and 81% with the
Chlammydomonas reinhardtii counterpart, 55% and 69% with the
Arabidopsis thaliana counterpart. A lower homology of Dsty
was found with the prokaryote counterparts, with the exception of
cyanobacterial Psys (40—42% identity).

The phylogenetic tree was constructed using Neighbor Joining
method by MEGA 4.0.2 software (Tamura et al., 2007) (Fig. 7).
Three deﬁned clusters can be found: Clusters I, II and III. Cluster I
contains Psys from higher plants, cluster II consists of the algae Psys
and cluster III comprises the bacterial homologs. Such phylogenetic
dendrogram showed similar patterns with BlastP search and DNA
sequence alignment results (data not shown); which indicated
that Psys isolated from green algae can be classiﬁed into one
group (Fig. 7). Accordingly, these results indicated an evolutionary
relationship among green algae.

4 DISCUSSION

Duanliella bardawil and D.salina are recognized as the most
promising natural sources to produce ,8-carotene in biotechnology
commercial-production applications, due to their ability of massive
accumulation of ,8-carotene under stress conditions, such as high

light intensity and salinity, stress temperature, privative nutrients,
etc. Plenty of studies have been performed to investigate the
carotenoid biosynthesis pathway for the ultimate goal to produce
as much ,8-carotene as possible (Mogedas et al., 2009; Salguero
et al., 2005; Xue et al., 2005). Nevertheless, most of these researches
mainly focused on culture conditions and extraction approaches, or
other aspects except carotenogenic enzyme genes. So far, a small
number of enzymes directly involving in carotenoid biosynthetic
pathway have been studied in Dunaliella, especially in D. bardawil
(Yan et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2005). Psy is one of the few which were
cloned in D.salina and D.bardawil. However, it has not yet been
experienced deeply functional validation up to now in D.bardawil.
The attempts to obtain psy regulatory elements from D. bardawil
would facilitate interpretation of the regulation mechanisms for Psy
expression and accumulation of ,8-carotene. Additionally, works
on elaborating the Psy structure at the protein level would help
further presentation of the differentiations of Psy regulation even the

whole carotenoid metabolic pathway between species. We strongly
speculate, based on previous intensive efforts (Ben—Amotz et al.,
1987; Leon et al., 2005; White and Jahnke, 2002; Xue et al.,
2005), that regulation of Psy and carotenogenesis is fulﬁlled at
multiple levels from DNA structure to post—translational control.
More speciﬁcally, the regulatory elements of psy gene and its protein
structure may confer different regulation mechanisms in D.bardawil
from other aglae.

As shown previously, massive accumulation of ,8—carotene is
triggered by environmental stress (Mogedas et al., 2009; White and
Jahnke, 2002; Ye et al., 2008), implying a regulatory expression
pattern of many carotenogenic genes. Among these environmental
stresses, UV interference executes different effects on ,8—carotene
accumulation through photosynthetic responses (Mogedas et al.,
2009; White and J ahnke, 2002). One of the protective mechanisms

against UV—induced photosynthetic damage involves in massive
accumulation of ,8—carotene in D. bardawil exposed to UV—A rather
than UV—B, while D.salina lacks such ability (White and Jahnke,
2002). UV—B even executes contrasting effects on ,8—carotene
biosynthesis: decreases ,8—carotene but enriches other carotenoids
including phytoene. However, this UV—A—induced protection is lost
in cells treated with the bleaching herbicide norﬂurazon (Ben—
Amotz et al., 1987). In such cells phytoene synthesis is enhanced
signiﬁcantly, with a decreased level of ,8—carotene, so that Leon
et al. (2005) applied this bleaching herbicide to product phytoene in
D. bardawil. Our study found that the promoter of Dsty possesses
a conserved motif BOXLCOREDCPAL (Fig. 3) homologous with
DcPALl counterpart in D. carota. Such motif participates in up—
regulation responses of DcPALl to UV—B irradiation in D. carom
mediated by DcMYBl (Maeda et al., 2005). These proofs suggest
that, in accordance with the investigations discussed above (Ben—
Amotz et al., 1987; Mogedas et al., 2009; White and Jahnke,
2002), Dsty may be regulated by UV—B and norﬂurazon with
respect to similar photobleaching effects to accumulate phytoene,
rather than ,8—carotene, through its promoter region. We conclude
that UV—B and norglurzon may induce photobleaching through the
BOXLCOREDCPAL situated within the promoter of Dsty.
Moreover, a salt— and light—induced pattern of ,8—carotene should
be concerned with certain regulatory domains in carotenogenic
genes. Here, we found two GT—l—like boxes deposited inside
the isolated promoter, which were widely discovered in many
light—regulated genes (Terzaghi and Cashmore, 1995). With
respect to GTlCONSENSUS (GAAAAA, position —354), we
speculate an intermediary role on interaction between TFIIA
and GT—l—like factors in D.bardawil (Terzaghi and Cashmore,
1995): TFIIA indirectly interacts with GT—l—like factors through
GTlCONSENSUS to accumulate ,8—carotene induced by light.
Another GT—1—like box (Fig. 3, GT1GMSCAM4) involves in NaCl—
induced up—regulated expression of SCaM—4 in Glycine max (Park
et al., 2004), consequently, GT1GMSCAM4 found in Dsty
promoter may fulﬁll similar function as its counterpart in Glycine
max: up—regulates its host gene psy in order to enhance ,8—
carotene synthesis by NaCl. Since both motifs up—regulate their
corresponding genes in their own species, we suppose parallel effect
in D.bardawil. Furthermore, as described above, the contrasting
effects of UV—A and UV—B exclusively in D.bardawil (White and
Jahnke, 2002) suggest UV—B may also up—regulate the expression
of Psy through these motifs. Such unique characteristics imply ﬁne
tuning of Psy (even the whole carotenogenesis) related to diversity
of DNA—protein interactions between D.bardawil and other algae.
Psy has been regarded as the ﬁrst key enzyme to catalyze a
head to head combination reaction, generating colorless phytoene
in carotenoid biosynthesis. It is supposed to be the regulatory
point controlling the ﬂux of carbon source towards carotenoids
(Shewmarker et al., 1999). To further illuminate the regulation
mechanisms of Dsty, we performed a series of in silico analysis
at the protein level. Advanced protein structure analysis manifests
a relatively conserved C—terminus containing putative substrate
binding and catalytic domains from around 100 to 400 amino
acids. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Psys isolated from algae
occupy one cluster (Fig. 7). These clues imply that they may
share some similar regulation mechanisms distinctively with regard
to the C—terminus of Psy in algae. Furthermore, alignments of
the deduced amino acid sequence showed the sequence diversity

between species primarily in the N—terminus. Tran et al. (2009)
suggested the N—terminal regions, unessential to the enzymatic
function, uniquely account for the major differences of the two Psy
classes found in some algae. Moreover, the N—terminal region of
plant Psy is generally longer than bacterial enzymes (Kim et al,
2003). This region is crucial for protein targeting and dimerization
that are critical for enzyme stability and activity (Cunningham and
Gantt, 1998; Sun et al, 1996). The N—terminus diversity between
D.bardawil and other algae may affect Psy turnover and catalytic
activity in certain similar patterns. In addition, increased level of
Psy does not directly correlate with increased carotenoids content
(Kim et al, 2003); the N—terminal variety may render different
capabilities between different Psy members of inter and intra species
with regard to protein targeting, processing or assembly into a fully
functional complex. As discussed above, we speculate the sequence
differences of Psy at the protein and DNA levels may be responsible
for the ﬁne tuning differences between D.bardawil and D. salina, we
also conducted alignments between these two algae, which returned
similar diversity of N—terminus (or the 5’—end of the Psy mRNA
CDS) and conserved C—terminus (or the 3’ —end of the Psy mRNA
CDS) (data not shown). Accordingly, we speculate that the ﬁne
tuning mechanisms of Psys between algae may lie in the variation
of their N—terminus. Studies on the N—terminal diversity as well as
other differential regions between species would be helpful to clarify
the distinct regulation mechanisms for Psy in D. bardawil.

An in—depth understanding of the regulation mechanisms of
Dsty still requires further intensive investigations on the promoter
function involving in the putative motifs discussed above and other
related conserved sequences. Moreover, the identiﬁcation of psy
promoter in D.salina and subsequent comparison with the one in
D.bardawil will shed light on the ﬁne tuning differences between
the two algae at the DNA level. Besides, the protein structure
is also a key point to aid the presentation of these mechanisms,
especially its N—terminus. Such understanding would also contribute
to bioengineering using Dsty promoter to product foreign proteins.

Abstract

Motivation: Large—scale chemical cross—linking with mass spectrometry (XL—MS) analyses are
quickly becoming a powerful means for high—throughput determination of protein structural infor—
mation and protein—protein interactions. Recent studies have garnered thousands of cross—linked
interactions, yet the field lacks an effective tool to compile experimental data or access the network
and structural knowledge for these large scale analyses. We present XLinkDB 2.0 which integrates
tools for network analysis, Protein Databank queries, modeling of predicted protein structures and
modeling of clocked protein structures. The novel, integrated approach of XLinkDB 2.0 enables the
holistic analysis of XL—MS protein interaction data without limitation to the cross—linker or analytical

system used for the analysis.

1 Introduction

Large—scale structural characterization of interactions within proteins
and protein complexes is a major goal of structural proteomics.
Recent efforts have generated datasets featuring thousands of peptide—
peptide links used to build networks of protein—protein interactions
(PPIs). Yet, the full depth of these datasets is often unrealized as (i) the
structural data inherent to chemical crosslinking—mass spectrometry
(XL—MS) networks remains untapped on a network—wide scale, par—
ticularly for proteins lacking empirically derived structures and
(ii) there is currently no centralized platform to host these large—scale
networks. To address the lack of network level structural information
we present XLinkDB 2.0 (hereafter XLinkDB), a web resource de—
signed to integrate XL—MS data with databases of protein structures,
enable generation of protein structure models for proteins lacking
known structures, and generate automated protein—protein docking
models. Protein structures are derived from empirical data when

available (Protein Databank, PDB) or through high—quality structural
prediction (Modeller). Similarly, structures of docked interacting pro—
teins are queried from the PDB or docked with PatchDock.
XLinkDB’s automation allows for the first, cross—platform, stream—
lined structural analysis of large XL—MS datasets and provides a cura—
ted, ever—growing reference database of cross—linked protein
interactions for the general community.

2 Resource description

XLinkDB is implemented primarily within the PHP framework run-
ning on a Linux server (Apache 2.4.7, Ubuntu 14.0.2) supported by
an SQL database system. For structural modeling and docking,
XLinkDB uses the Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP; Russel, et
61]., 2012). The integration of the well—established, high—quality mod—
eling (Modeller) and docking (PatchDock) modules within IMP, its
invocation by Python (which provides flexibility for additional

features), and relatively low runtime make IMP ideal for high-
throughput analyses (Fig. 1) (Marti—Renom, et al., 2000;
Schneidman—Duhovny, et al., 2005). The user input for XLinkDB is
a tab—delimited text file with only six columns to identify cross—
linked peptides and protein accessions: peptide sequence #1, protein
UniProt accession #1, the relative position of the crosslinked residue
within peptide #1, peptide sequence #2, protein UniProt accession
#2 and the relative position of the crosslinked residue within peptide
#2. XLinkDB has been preloaded with publicly—available, example
XL—MS datasets from previous analyses. Importantly, as demon—
strated by the publicly accessible datasets within XLinkDB, data
from any XL-MS pipeline can be used as the input, including that
generated by pLink (Yang, et al., 2012), XlinkX (Liu, et al., 2015),
or ReACT (Chavez, et al., 2015; Chavez, et al., 2013; Navare, et al.,
2015; Schweppe, et al., 2015; Weisbrod, et al., 2013).

XLinkDB generates protein—protein interaction networks and
queries the Uniprot database to determine the amino acid sequences
for all input proteins (Supplementary Fig. 81). XLinkDB then queries
the PDB to determine if a PDB structure exists for the protein and
maps identified crosslinked residues to these structures. If no PDB
structure exists XLinkDB generates a homology model using Modeller.

Through the PDB query or Modeller prediction, XLinkDB seeks
to establish an associated PDB structure or structural model for each
protein from the original input. For cross-linked relationships identi-
fied between two proteins (multi—protein complexes) XLinkDB will
automatically query the PDB again, this time searching for co-pro-
tein structures that contain both input proteins. If no co—protein
structures are identified, XLinkDB initiates IMP’s integrative dock—
ing to determine interaction interfaces of these proteins using sites of
crosslinking as empirical distance constraints. Finally, XLinkDB

retains the top—ranked docked model for each protein complex.
Modeling and docking jobs are scheduled and initiated via a Jenkins
server and job queueing is performed via a centralized Sun Grid
Engine. In this manner, the docking and modeling platforms are
maintained separately from network analysis. All associated struc—
tures, models, docked models and crosslinked residues therein can
be visualized using Jmol directly within the user’s web browser.

3 Application and use cases

XLinkDB is able to generate large network plots and thousands of
models based on minimal user input (Fig. 1). The automated, multi—
dimensional data output allows for efficient analysis of XL—MS
datasets. Considering both public and private data, XLinkDB cur-
rently contains 57 950 cross—linked peptide relationships and a total
of 4872 protein structures. 1011 of these protein structures are from
the PDB (including co—protein structures). Of the remaining 3861,
XLinkDB 2.0 generated 1942 Modeller structures and 1919 docked
protein models. Importantly, the database of structures will con—
tinue to grow with additional datasets being incorporated and ini—
tiating the structural workflow.

To further demonstrate the utility of XLinkDB, we uploaded data—
sets from three distinct XL—MS pipelines, all using different cross-link-
ing chemistry, instrumentation and analytical tools. These included:
pLink (Yang, et al., 2012), XlinkX (Liu, et al., 2015) and
ReACT(Chavez, et al., 2015; Chavez, et al., 2013; Navare, et al.,
2015; Schweppe, et al., 2015; Weisbrod, et al., 2013) (Supplementary
Fig. 81). These datasets are available on the XLinkDB website as use
cases, and for general data mining and network analysis.

4 Conclusions

The current XLinkDB server is the first integrated pipeline to ana—
lyze protein crosslinking data in the context of proteome scale struc—
tural knowledge, both from empirically evidenced structures and
protein structural predictions. XLinkDB offers a platform that is
ﬂexible, adaptable and freely available. Moreover, because models
and interactions can be input irrespective of cross-linking platform
or linker chemistry, XLinkDB can integrate multiple data types.
XLinkDB takes advantage of well—established modeling and docking
protocols to automate time—intensive analytical bottlenecks. The
prediction of almost 4000 protein structures and docked models
highlights the broad utility of XLinkDB’s structural insights.

Finally, several large—scale protein cross—linking studies have
been uploaded to XLinkDB from multiple species, including: Homo
sapiens (Chavez, et al., 2013; Liu, et al., 2015; Schweppe, et al.,
2015), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Navare, et al., 2015), Escherichia
coli (Weisbrod, et al., 2013; Yang, et al., 2012) and Acinetobacter
baumannii (Schweppe, et al., 2015 ). These datasets, along with their
structural and docking predictions, provide the first compendium of
high-throughput XL—MS experiments and easy access to a wealth of
network—level XL—MS information (Supplementary Figs 81—84).
This compendium is a novel, ever—growing resource for integrated
structural and XL—MS data that will be constantly enriched by (i)
further structure submissions to the PDB, (ii) integration of XL-MS
knowledge for structure selection (Schweppe, et al., 2016) and (iii)
future improvements to modeling/docking software.

ABSTRACT

Summary: End-to-end next-generation sequencing microbiology data
analysis requires a diversity of tools covering bacterial resequencing,
de novo assembly, scaffolding, bacterial RNA-Seq, gene annotation
and metagenomics. However, the construction of computational pipe-
lines that use different software packages is difficult owing to a lack of
interoperability, reproducibility and transparency. To overcome these
limitations we present Orione, a Galaxy-based framework consisting
of publicly available research software and specifically designed
pipelines to build complex, reproducible workflows for next-generation
sequencing microbiology data analysis. Enabling microbiology
researchers to conduct their own custom analysis and data manipu-
lation without software installation or programming, Orione provides
new opportunities for data-intensive computational analyses in micro-
biology and metagenomics.

Availability and implementation: Orione is available online at http://
orione.crs4.it.

1 INTRODUCTION

Application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in microbiol-
ogy is becoming a common practice with a profound impact on
research, diagnostic and clinical microbiology (Loman et al.,
2012). Recent applications include genomic sequencing, differ-
ential transcription analysis, variant investigation, as well as
metagenomics studies. Major challenges include draft assemblies
ﬁnishing followed by reliable genome annotation or robust
dissection of microbial communities including those associated
with human health and disease. Furthermore, there is an increas-
ing need to process and present data in a fashion that is transpar-
ent and reproducible and to provide analysis frameworks that
are usable and cost-effective for biomedical researchers.

To address these challenges, we developed Orione, an online
framework for integrative analysis of NGS microbiology data.
Orione is based on Galaxy (Goecks et al., 2010), an open plat-
form for reproducible data-intensive computational analysis used
in many diverse biomedical research environment. Orione is the
first freely available platform that supports the whole life cycle of
microbiology research data from production and annotation to

publication and sharing. Other commercial alternative exists
(e.g. CLC Genomics Workbench by CLC Bio), but Orione is
unique in transparently combining the most used open source
bioinformatics tools for microbiology. Orione is currently
applied to a variety of microbiological projects including bacteria
resequencing, de novo assembling and microbiome investigations;
see http://goo.gl/owgPD for a list. Furthermore, Orione is part
of an ongoing project to integrate Galaxy with Hadoop-based
tools to provide scalable computing (Leo et al., 2012); a specia-
lized version of OMERO (Allan et al., 2012) to model biomedical
data and the chain of actions that connect them; and iRODS
(Rajasekar et al., 2010) to efficiently support inter-institutional
data sharing. This infrastructure is already used in production at
Center for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in
Sardinia for the automated processing of sequencing data
(Pireddu et al., 2013) and for quality control in gene therapy
applications (Bifﬁ et al., 2013).

2 FEATURES AND METHODS

Orione consists of ‘best—of-breed’ NGS bioinformatics tools cov-
ering end-to-end data analysis for bacterial resequencing, de novo
assembly, scaffolding, bacterial RNA-Seq, gene annotation,
metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Publicly available re-
search tools were integrated under the open source Galaxy
framework with pipelines and workﬂows newly developed by
our group for ready-to-go microbiological analysis. Although
several of the tools for NGS microbiology data analysis were
already available in Galaxy, a signiﬁcant effort was required to
expand the Galaxy functionalities with new features such as
SSPACE (Boetzer et al., 2011), SSAKE WVarren et al., 2007),
SOPRA (Dayarian et al., 2010), SEQuel (Ronen et al., 2012),
EDGE-pro (Magoc et al., 2013), Gene Locator and Interpolated
Markov ModelER (Delcher et al., 2007) and Prokka (http://goo.
gl/aSqu). We refer to the Supplementary information for a
description of the complete set of Orione tools and workﬂows.

3 FUNCTIONALITIES

Orione complements the ﬂexible Galaxy workﬂow environment,
allowing microbiologists without any speciﬁc hardware or in-
formatics skill to consistently access a set of NGS data analysis
tools and conduct reproducible data-intensive computational
analyses from quality control to microbial gene annotation. In
the following paragraphs, we describe the main Orione
functionalities.

Preprocessing, quality control and trimming. The funda-
mental step before any NGS analysis is the quality control of
reads and their trimming. To cope with long reads and paired-
end technology, FastX (http://goo.gl/quyV) and FASTQC
(http://goo.gl/6TUqD) were complemented with speciﬁcally de-
veloped tools (see also workﬂow #1 in the Supplementary
information).

Reads mapping. Mapping is a key step in many NGS applica-
tions from bacteria resequencing to variant calling. The most
widely used aligners are integrated in Orione, including BWA
(Li and Durbin, 2009), Bowtiel (Langmead et al., 2009),
Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), SOAP (Li et al.,
2008) and MOSAIK (http://git.io/QrYWXg). We further
added BLAT (Kent, 2002), SHRiMP (David et al., 2011),
LASTZ (Harris, 2007) and BFAST (Homer et al., 2009) for
use with long reads from 454 Roche.

De novo assembly. De novo assembly produces contigs without
the aid of a reference genome. Different methods, either based on
a de Bruijn graph [Velvet (Zerbino and Birney, 2008), ABySS
(Simpson et al., 2009) and SPAdes (Bankevich et al., 2012)] or on
a greedy approach [SSAKE, Edena (Hernandez et al., 2008)], are
available in Orione.

Scaffolding. After mapping, contigs are ordered and oriented
to produce even longer sequences called scaffolds, exploiting the
mate-pair/paired—end information. Orione includes the most es-
tablished scaffolders such as SSAKE, SSPACE, SEQuel and
SOPRA.

Post assembly, contigs statistics, (multi) alignng and variant
calling. This section of Orione includes tools we have developed
covering task such as genome-scale alignment, high-quality con-
tigs extraction, statistics over contigs or draft genomes (N50/
NG50 values, contigs length distribution, high/low quality
regions/ gaps in draft genomes).

Annotation. Annotation is the process of identifying meaning-
ful biological information from sequences. Glimmer and
tRNAscan-SE (Lowe and Eddy, 1997) were wrapped into
Orione together with the Prokka pipeline, enabling easy
Genbank/DDJB/ENA submission.

RNA-Seq. We integrated EDGE-pro tool for bacterial RNA-
Seq analysis. As EDGE-pro requires genome annotation ﬁles, we
developed an accessory tool (‘Get EDGE-pro ﬁles’) that retrieves
them directly from the NCBI RefSeq repository.

Metagenomics and other tools. We added to the standard
Galaxy metagenomics pipeline MetaPhlAn (Segata et al., 2012)
and MetaVelvet (Namiki et al., 2012). The MetaGeneMark (Zhu
et al., 2010) annotation tool has been added for gene prediction
in metagenomic sequences and a workﬂow has been developed
for (bacterial) metatranscriptome analysis. We complete this sec-
tion with instruments for data ﬁltering, conversion and tax-
onomy abundance displaying into the Krona Visualizer (Ondov
et al., 2011).

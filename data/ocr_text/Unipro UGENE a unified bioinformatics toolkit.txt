ABSTRACT

Summary: Unipro UGENE is a multiplatform open-source software
with the main goal of assisting molecular biologists without much
expertise in bioinformatics to manage, analyze and visualize their
data. UGENE integrates widely used bioinformatics tools within a
common user interface. The toolkit supports multiple biological data
formats and allows the retrieval of data from remote data sources.
It provides visualization modules for biological objects such as
annotated genome sequences, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
assembly data, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees
and 3D structures. Most of the integrated algorithms are tuned for
maximum performance by the usage of multithreading and special
processor instructions. UGENE includes a visual environment for
creating reusable workflows that can be launched on local resources
or in a High Performance Computing (HPC) environment. UGENE is
written in C++ using the Qt framework. The built-in plugin system
and structured UGENE API make it possible to extend the toolkit
with new functionality.

Availability and implementation: UGENE binaries are freely
available for MS Windows, Linux and Mac OS X at http://ugene.
unipro.ru/download.html. UGENE code is licensed under the GPLv2;
the information about the code licensing and copyright of integrated
tools can be found in the LlCENSE.3rd_party file provided with the
source bundle.

1 INTRODUCTION

The number of available bioinformatics tools has grown
dramatically over the past two decades. However, as a result
of increasing complexity of the tools and a lack of rigorous
software engineering practices, using, installing and conﬁguring
a bioinformatics application, along with ensuring that it is
communicating well with other programs, can be a challenging
task. Moreover, a large number of computational methods and tools
are available only as source—code packages, command—line utilities
which can run only in a Linux/Unix environment, web—services
(Stockinger et al., 2008), or programming libraries (Mangalam,
2002), and cannot be easily accessed by biologists who do not
have the necessary skills. A number of existing tools also lack user
documentation and have limited support.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Some solutions have been proposed to improve the situation.
There are bioinformatics tools which are multiplatform, easy to
install and hide the underlying complexity behind an easy—to—use
GUI interface. Usually, these tools are focused on a particular
niche. Good examples of such tools are the Artemis genome
browser (Rutherford et al., 2000), JalView multiple alignment
editor (Waterhouse et al., 2009), Tablet (Milne et al., 2010)
and IGV (Robinson et al., 2011) next—generation sequencing data
Visualization packages. Applications such as Galaxy (Goecks et al.,
2010) or Taverna (Hull et al., 2006) solve communication issues
between tools by providing easily accessible capabilities to manage
bioinformatics workﬂows, but still require signiﬁcant effort to set
up on a local server. There are also closed—source commercially
available programs, such as VectorNTI (www.invitrogen.com),
Geneious (www.geneious.com) or CLCBio (www.clcbio.com) that
could act as a bioinformatics ‘Swiss army knife’.

In this article, we introduce Unipro UGENE, a multiplatform
open—source application, which integrates popular bioinformatics
algorithms and tools, providing both graphical and command—line
interfaces. It has an active user community and support from a
team of professional software developers. To perform complex
computational experiments, UGENE allows the construction of
reusable workﬂow diagrams.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

UGENE currently supports reading and writing in >20 popular
biological data formats. Among them are FASTA, GenB ank, Clustal,
GFF and SAM/BAM. It is capable of working with local ﬁles and
accessing data from key biological online databases including NCBI
GenB ank, UniProt and PDB. To simplify management of biological
datasets, UGENE uses the concept of a project, an abstract structure
that contains information about ﬁles and Visualization settings.
A project can be saved or exported with all data to a speciﬁed
location and restored at any time. By using the point—and—click Visual
interface, one can manipulate groups of items in the project.

The toolkit allows the Visualization of biological objects such
as annotated DNA/RNA and protein sequences, multiple sequence
alignments, phylogenetic trees, chromatograms, macromolecular
3D structures and NGS assemblies. All Visualization components
use common principles in providing functionality for users, and
allow export of publication—quality images. Most of the Visualization
components allow editing of biological objects. For example, the
sequence Viewer allows Visualizing and editing of genomes in linear
and circular modes, and includes an interactive annotations editor
(Fig. 1).

UGENE incorporates a large library of computational methods.
The library currently consists of >30 methods and is constantly
growing. The integrated tools and algorithms solve a variety of

bioinformatics tasks that include a pattern search, local sequence
alignment, search for repeats, multiple sequence alignment, HMM
proﬁle tools, restriction sites analysis, primer design, short read
alignment and many others.

There are two kinds of UGENE tools: those directly integrated
into the UGENE application and external tools. To use an external
tool, it must be available as a binary executable. All needed binaries
can be downloaded from the UGENE website as a separate package
or as a part of the UGENE Full Package.

A key advantage of UGENE is that all of the included algorithms
are adapted to use the internal UGENE data model. This allows
one to avoid manual data conversion between the tools’ input and
output. The algorithm library consists not only of popular tools and
methods such as MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) or Bowtie (Langmead
et al., 2009), but also includes unique computational methods
developed by the UGENE team or contributed by other researchers.
New versions of third—party tools are tracked by UGENE developers
and, typically, updates are applied in every major release. A test
base containing >5000 automated tests helps to avoid potential
regressions in the integrated code.

Some of the integrated algorithms are adapted to utilize multicore
systems, special processor instructions and GPUs. For example,
the integrated Smith—Waterman algorithm, developed by the
UGENE team, has the multi—threaded and vectorized version for
multicore processors and the GPU—optimized version. All optimized
algorithms are included in the standard installation package and
accessible for users ‘out—of—the—box’.

One of the key components of UGENE is the Workﬂow Designer,
a visual tool for building complex analysis pipelines. As UGENE is
a standalone application, one does not need to install any additional
components or upload and download any data to use the Workﬂow
Designer. This factor, along with the intuitive and user—friendly
interface, reduces the entry threshold for new users. For advanced
users, the Workﬂow Designer provides capabilities to create custom
workﬂow elements in C++, QtScript programming languages or
from any external application by customizing the input and output
with the step—by—step wizard. Every user—designed workﬂow can
be run from the command line. This feature makes it easy to

run workﬂows in an HPC environment, and/or incorporate them
into users’ scripts. A more detailed overview of the Workﬂow
Designer’s features and its comparison to Taverna and Galaxy can be
found in Section S1 in the Supplementary Materials. The Workﬂow
Designer ﬁle format is described in Section S2 in the Supplementary
Materials.

Workﬂows constructed using the Workﬂow Designer can be
ofﬂoaded to a remote computational resource running UGENE
Remote Service—a custom HPC facility. There is a publicly
available beta of the service utilizing the Amazon EC2 cloud. More
details are available in Section S3 in the Supplementary Materials.

UGENE is written in C++ using the Qt4 library. The toolkit has a
highly modular structure and a built—in plugin system. Therefore, its
components can be reused in other applications, and UGENE can
be extended with new functionality. The Unipro UGENE project
was started in 2008, and has already gathered a strong community
of users. According to our statistics, the UGENE binary packages
for different operating systems are downloaded ~1000 times per
month. Owing to the efforts of the community, the toolkit has
been integrated into major Linux distributions: Ubuntu, Fedora,
Debian (Meller et al., 2010) and others. New features suggested
by users have the highest priority in the project road map. For better
interaction with the community, there is an open bug—tracking system
(https://ugene.unipro.ru/tracker) and a forum.

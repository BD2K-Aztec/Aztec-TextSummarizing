Abstract

Summary: ABIF Manager is simple application for low-level access to ABIF formatted files. Those
are produced by Data Collection software based on the data, collected from capillary sequencing
machine. The application shows all the data as readable text, which can be easily edited.
Availability and implementation: The program source code and compiled executable is freely
available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/abifmanager/

1 Introduction

Although there has been a massive development of next generation
sequencing recently, Sanger sequencing method still remains widely
used for routine sequencing of DNA fragments (Chen et al., 2014;
Dawit et al., 2014; Ihle et al., 2014; Rounds et al., 2014). Results pro-
duced by capillary sequencing machines are often analyzed by Data
Collection software, which generates ABIF (Applied Biosystems
Genetic Analysis) formatted files (.ab1, .fsa). All data generated by the
software (sequencing machines) are stored in structured directories
which forms the resulting file (AB manual). Typical directory of ABIF
formatted file consists of: Tag name, Tag number, Element type code,
Size in bytes of one element, Number of elements in item, Size in bytes
of item and Item’s data or offset in file and Datahandle.

There are several applications which can show and sometimes
modify the data (e.g. Sequence Scanner, Applied Biosystems;
Chromas, Technelysium Pty Ltd). Most of the applications, how-
ever, process the data and show it in user friendly form. Although
this approach suits the needs of most users, the data loses some in-
formation by the processing. Furthermore, usually not all data con-
tained in the data file are processed by such software.

The ABIF Manager is a simple, yet powerful application, which
reads and writes the directories of ABIF formatted file by accessing
the directories directly.

2 Program overview

ABIF Manager is simple stand-alone application for reading and
editing ABIF formatted files (.ab1, .fsa) and doesn’t require installa-
tion. It’s programmed in Visual Basic .NET 2012 (Microsoft, USA)
and requires .NET Framework version 3.5 for running on Microsoft
Windows.

The application reads ABIF formatted files and lists all the direc-
tories contained in the file. The directories contained in the opened
file are listed in ABIF Manager main window as individual items of
ListView control. Data of the items can be accessed by double-click.
Application also includes descriptions of all directories according to
ABIF reference, so that the user did not have any difficulties in iden-
tifying individual directories. Data and type of all directories can be
changed by the user. It’s also possible to remove existing and add
new directories.

3 Purpose

Purpose of the ABIF Manager is to give users a simple tool, which
will allow them to freely manipulate ABIF formatted files without
any limitation. Any aspect of the edited file can be changed due to
first-hand directory manipulation approach. Apparent drawback of
the program is the difficulty of complex data manipulation. The aim

of ABIF Manager, however, is tuning of minor deficiencies the file
can possibly contain, and which cannot be changed by any other
software.

4 Interface

The interface of ABIF Manager is very simple and intuitive and all
users with basic computer/Microsoft Windows skills should use the
program without any difficulty. All the control elements are clearly
visible in the main window and double-clicking on listed directories
opens a second window with its data.

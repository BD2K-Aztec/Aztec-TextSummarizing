ABSTRACT

Motivation: Metaproteomic analysis allows studying the interplay of
organisms or functional groups and has become increasingly popular
also for diagnostic purposes. However, difficulties arise owing to the
high sequence similarity between related organisms. Further, the state
of conservation of proteins between species can be correlated with
their expression level, which can lead to significant bias in results and
interpretation. These challenges are similar but not identical to the
challenges arising in the analysis of metagenomic samples and require
specific solutions.

Results: We introduce Pipasic (peptide intensity-weighted proteome
abundance similarity correction) as a tool that corrects identification
and spectral counting-based quantification results using peptide simi-
larity estimation and expression level weighting within a non-negative
lasso framework. Pipasic has distinct advantages over approaches
only regarding unique peptides or aggregating results to the lowest
common ancestor, as demonstrated on examples of viral diagnostics
and an acid mine drainage dataset.

1 INTRODUCTION

In contrast to classical proteomic approaches, metaproteomics
and environmental proteomics studies aim at deciphering the
interplay of different organisms contained within an environ-
mental sample (Muth et al., 2013). Throughout the past years,
this idea has seen increasing application primarily in three ﬁelds:
aqueous ecosystems, terrestrial systems and eukaryotic host
microbiomes (Hettich et al., 2013). In addition, metaproteomic
approaches have become of interest also for clinical diagnostics,
e. g. for characterizing the state of an infection (Fouts et al., 2012)
or for identifying and strain-level typing of bacteria (Karlsson
et al., 2012).

Similar to metagenomic approaches Mooley et al., 2010), the
analysis of environmental samples and the interplay of organisms
offer an enormous potential to further the characterization and

understanding of these systems. At the same time, challenges in
metaproteomics are manifold and relate to all steps of the ana-
lysis. Particularly, this includes the handling of the resulting large
and complex datasets of spectra derived from mass spectrometry
(MS) experiments and their meaningful comparison with refer-
ence proteomes of organisms. It can by no means be generally
assumed that this set of references—in particular for bacteria or
viruses—is complete or representative for the given sample
(Lindner et al., 2013). Depending on the sample of interest, the
number of organisms of interest may vary signiﬁcantly from tens
to thousands and more. In all cases, it is non-trivial to identify
the correct origin of a spectrum and thereby to allow either the
identiﬁcation of organisms or the quantiﬁcation of either organ-
isms or key biological processes.

While many goals and strategies correlate for metagenomic
and metaproteomic approaches, several distinct differences are
noteworthy. In metaproteomic approaches, expression levels are
analyzed and thus quantitative measures differ even for proteins
from a single organism. This can be highly insightful for func-
tional analyses (Muth et al., 2013), but poses an additional chal-
lenge for data analysis. Further, while the method is designed to
be unbiased, it cannot be assumed that all proteins are extracted
and captured by MS in a metaproteomics experiment. However,
as it is an orthogonal technique to metagenomics, metaproteomic
and metagenomic approaches have differing error proﬁles and
can jointly provide a much deeper insight than each method on
its own (Hettich et al., 2013), even in cases such as the quantiﬁ-
cation of strains when metagenomics is usually preferable owing
to lower demands on material and longer sequences. It should be
noted that metaproteomic approaches require the availability of
reference proteomes or genomes and cannot assemble them from
a given sample as in metagenome protocols [e.g. Lai et a].
(2012)].

While numerous tools have been introduced for
metagenomic data analysis (see Teeling and Glockner (2012)
for an overview), only comparatively few tools exist with
focus on the speciﬁc difﬁculties arising in the analysis of meta-
proteomic data. These cover a broad ﬁeld ranging from specia-
lized approaches for visualization (Mehlan et al., 2013) to the
scalability of database search algorithms (Jagtap et al., 2013,
2012b) and to metaproteogenomics and the difﬁculty of identify-
ing a suitable reference database (Rooijers et al., 2011; Seifert
et al., 2013).

One key difﬁculty that is hindering metaproteomic data ana-
lysis is the ambiguity of peptide identiﬁcations (Hettich et al.,
2013; Muth et al., 2013; Seifert et al., 2013). Even more

Fig. 1. Method overview. Pipasic involves three main steps: (i) peptide identiﬁcation: here metaproteomic peptide spectra are identiﬁed by a database
search. The number of matches to the proteomes is the observed abundances. (ii) Similarity estimation: the similarities between the reference proteomes
are calculated and stored in a similarity matrix. This incorporates the adjustment to only regard expressed proteins and to weight them according to their
expression level. (iii) Similarity correction: the observed abundances are corrected using the similarity matrix yielding corrected abundances

pronounced than in classical bottom-up proteomic approaches
(Nesvizhskii, 2010), one spectrum can not only match to several
peptides occurring in multiple proteins of the same organism, but
may match to proteins in different organisms. This is particularly
common for closely related organisms with sufﬁcient sequence
similarity and for well-conserved proteins. Consequently, this
problem hinders the correct identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of
the species present in a sample. While also common in metage-
nomics (Lindner and Renard, 2013), it is even more challenging
in proteomics because peptides are commonly shorter than
sequencing reads and thereby less likely to be unique.
Furthermore, expression levels are not necessarily uncorrelated
to the state of conservation of a protein and thereby constitute a
potentially large bias when disregarded.

Currently, two major ideas are used to address this difﬁculty:
either the analysis is based primarily on unique peptides that are
speciﬁc for a single organism (Karlsson et al., 2012; Lo et al.,
2007; Rooijers et al., 2011) or the phylogenetic resolution is
reduced. This can be achieved by limiting the analysis to a set
of well-chosen representative species that have no signiﬁcant
overlap (Chourey et al., 2013) or by dynamically allocating re-
sults to the lowest common ancestor that allows a distinction
(Huson et al., 2007; Jagtap et al., 2012a; Schneider et al.,
2011). When disregarding shared peptides and focusing on
unique peptides, it is feasible to identify the species present in
an organism as long as the coverage is high enough to observe a
sufﬁcient number of these peptides with sufﬁcient conﬁdence.
This can be a challenge in metaproteomic experiments, which
commonly have low coverage for individual species (Hettich
et al., 2013), and resulting difﬁculties in the reliability of peptide
identiﬁcations (Renard et al., 2010) can lead to false conclusions.
Furthermore, quantitative information derived exclusively from
distinct unique peptides is not necessarily representative for the
presence of organisms or functional groups. When using repre-
sentatives or lowest common ancestor, the resolution of the

approach is reduced and it may no longer be possible to distin-
guish strains or related species.

Within this contribution, we introduce Pipasic (peptide inten-
sity-weighted proteome abundance similarity correction) as a
tool for metaproteomic data analysis, which overcomes the
limitations of these two strategies. Pipasic uses all peptide iden-
tiﬁcations available, not only unique peptides, and generates a
strain-speciﬁc quantitative output without resorting to a lower
phylogenetic resolution. This is possible because Pipasic builds
on a similarity correction approach from metagenomics (Lindner
and Renard, 2013), which implicitly weights and corrects
observed abundances based on the experiment-speciﬁc expected
similarity between reference genomes. Further, Pipasic avoids
potential bias by estimating the similarity only for expressed pro-
teins, which may correlate with the state of conservation of
proteins.

We evaluate Pipasic in two settings: a diagnostic setting where
we distinguish two closely related cowpox virus strains at varying
concentrations and a metaproteomic dataset from an acid mine
drainage (AMD) environment. We compare Pipasic to a
MEGAN-based (Huson et al., 2007) analysis as a commonly
used lowest common ancestor approach (Jagtap et al., 2012a)
and analyze the impact of the expression level correction and
unique peptides.

2 METHODS

Pipasic is a method for estimating corrected proteome abundances in a
metaproteomic dataset and builds on the GASiC approach (Lindner and
Renard, 2013), extending it to the speciﬁc features of metaproteomic
data. The overall workﬂow is outlined in Figure 1. As input, Pipasic
takes a metaproteomic dataset containing a set of tandem mass spectra
data and a set of N reference proteomes 73,-, i=1..N of organisms or
functional groups that are expected to be potentially contained within
the sample. The goal then is to quantify the contribution of these refer-
ences to the spectral data at hand. The ﬁrst step is the identiﬁcation of the

Pipasic

 

metaproteomic spectra with the peptides in the reference proteomes. The
number of identiﬁed spectra per proteome is the naive observed abundance
estimate. The second step calculates a matrix containing the pairwise
similarities of the reference proteomes, reﬂecting only these proteins ex-
pressed in the sample according to their expression level. The results of
the ﬁrst two steps are then used to estimate the corrected proteome
abundances.

There are two main differences to the genomics-based GASiC ap-
proach: ﬁrst, expression levels are analyzed in metaproteomics.
Compared with the homogeneous coverage in metagenomic whole
genome sequencing, each protein—even within a single organism—will
have a different expression level. These expression levels directly inﬂuence
the similarity estimation. Second, the number of spectra is typically lower
than the number of reads in metagenomics. This requires the proteomes to
have sufﬁciently high numbers of matching spectra that the probabilistic
correction step works correctly. Therefore, abundance estimates may be
distorted if the coverage is low or the proteome only contains few proteins.

2.1 Peptide identiﬁcation

The peptide spectra in the metaproteomic dataset are searched separately
against each reference proteome using an appropriate database search
algorithm. The choice of peptide search tool is not restricted; we tested
searches with InsPecT (Tanner et al., 2005), Sequest/Tide (Diament and
Noble, 2011) and BICEPS (Renard et al., 2012). It is crucial for Pipasic
that matches to all reference proteomes are reported instead of a subset of
best hits as commonly done by many search engines. We generally run the
peptide identiﬁcation and false discovery rate (FDR) computation separ-
ately for each reference proteome to be more independent of database size
and quality effects (Jeong et al., 2012) and further to allow a more ﬁne-
grained probabilistic weighting of peptide identiﬁcations against presence
of a species. However, Pipasic can also be run with a joint peptide iden-
tiﬁcation and FDR computation for all reference proteomes.

To ensure speciﬁcity, we apply a standard decoy database strategy
(Bradshaw et al., 2006) using a reverse database. A FDR is calculated
for each identiﬁcation; identiﬁcations below a user-deﬁned FDR thresh-
old are discarded. For each proteome 73,-, the number of FDR-controlled
identiﬁcations is called the observed proteome abundance. Normalizing
the observed abundances of all proteomes to one yields relative observed
abundances ri.

2.2 Proteome similarity estimation

The similarity of two reference proteins can be computed in various ways,
e.g. based on mismatch statistics or alignment scores. However, for the
application to metaproteomics, the quantity of interest is the similarity
that may lead to an ambiguous spectra-to-species assignment. The equiva-
lent similarity estimation step in the metagenomic GASiC method involves
the simulation of short reads for each genome, which are then mapped to
all other genomes. This carefully reﬂects the risk of incorrectly assigning a
read. One could estimate proteome similarities in the same way by simu-
lating spectra for each proteome and identifying them among all other
proteomes. However, simulating a signiﬁcant number of spectra using a
simulation method such as the MSSimulator (Bielow et al., 2011) is par-
ticularly time-consuming and practically infeasible.

2.2.] String comparison As a signiﬁcantly faster alternative, we thus
regard the reference proteomes as sets of protein sequences, i.e. sets of
strings. Because the proteins in the experiment are typically digested into
tryptic peptides before the spectra are acquired, we perform an in silico
digestion of the reference proteomes, yielding a list of short peptide
strings for each proteome. For a proteome, we search all short peptide
strings in all other proteomes using exact string matching. To account for
the amino acids with indistinguishable masses, we replace all occurrences
of I by L and Q by K. We do not regard any ambiguity arising from

variable modiﬁcations (such as oxidized M) because the analysis on the
sequence level cannot incorporate the knowledge whether the potential
modiﬁcation indeed occurs. The fraction of tryptic peptides in proteome
E that can be found in another proteome 73,- is denoted the unweighted
similarity 51,}. Thus, we obtain the—unweighted—similarity matrix
2 =(&,,), i=1..N,j=1..N.

2.2.2 Weighting by the expression level A reference proteome often
contains proteins that were not expressed or measured in the experiment.
This may either result from the fact that not all proteins are expressed or
that expression levels span several orders of magnitude and may be below
the detection limit or from biases in sample preparation or MS acquisi-
tion (Hettich et al., 2013). The similarity of the expressed proteins may
strongly differ from the overall similarity because proteins of key cellular
functions may be better conserved as well as higher expressed than other
proteins of an organism. Thus, we reﬂect these particular effects in the
similarity estimation by introducing weights for all peptides. The weight
wp for the tryptic peptide 1) in proteome 73,- is calculated as follows:

(1) Assign a preliminary weight w I, to each peptide p: add Ni to w I, for
each spectrum that was identiﬁed with p, where Np is the number
of peptides the spectrum can be identiﬁed with.

(2) For each protein P e 73,-, set the peptide weights op, p e P, to the

average preliminary peptide weight: viz}, =

 

(3) Normalize the sum of all weights to one: w = Zw” w .

The matrix entry aij of the weighted similarity matrix A is calculated by
summing over the weights of the peptides in 731— that were found in 73,:

2.3 Similarity correction

The similarity correction step corrects the relative observed abundance r,
of proteome 73,- by estimating the true abundance ci. This step is math-
ematically identical to the GASiC correction step: the relative observed
abundance r, of proteome 73,- is assumed to be a mixture of the true
abundances cj weighted with the similarity matrix entry aij and can thus

be written as
E Clij 2 H
J

In matrix notation, we can write this equation more brieﬂy as
Ac=r

where c=(c1, 62, ...,cN)T and r=(r1, r2, ...,rN)T. Directly solving
the linear system of equations for c may lead to numerically unstable
results. Furthermore, we require the estimated abundances to be 2 0
and the sum over all abundances to be 5 1. Thus, we formulate the so-
lution for c as a non-negative lasso (Efron et al., 2004; Renard et al.,
2008) problem:

6 = argmin ||Ac — r||2

In our implementation, we solve this problem with the COBYLA
method implemented in SciPy (Oliphant, 2007).

Similarly to the GASiC framework, it is possible to obtain statistically
more robust estimates by bootstrapping from the set of spectra and
iterating the similarity correction step. Statistical tests for the presence
of a proteome as well as error estimates for the obtained abundances can
then be computed from the distribution of abundance estimates.

2.4 Technical details

Pipasic is implemented as Python scripts where performance-critical parts
are calculated using the scientiﬁc computing libraries SciPy and NumPy.
Currently, Pipasic is designed to directly work with either InsPecT or
Sequest/Tide for peptide identiﬁcation. Pipasic is freely available from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/pipasic/

3 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS

To evaluate Pipasic and the impact of the various algorithmic
steps, we conducted two experiments. First, we demonstrate the
accuracy of the method on a mixture of real datasets of cowpox
viruses with a known ground truth. Here, we can identify the
beneﬁts of individual steps and compare Pipasic with a metapro-
teomic analysis based on MEGAN and unique peptides. In a
second experiment, we apply Pipasic to a published AMD data-
set showing that our method is also able to provide corrected
abundance estimates for datasets from a natural environment.

3.1 Performance evaluation

The goal of the ﬁrst experiment is the quantitative evaluation of
the Pipasic method using gold standard ground truth data. In
this experiment, we ﬁrst provide evidence that including the ex-
pression information for similarity estimation signiﬁcantly im-
proves the abundance estimates. Secondly, we demonstrate that
Pipasic provides more accurate results with regard to identiﬁca-
tion and quantiﬁcation than the analysis with MEGAN and
based on unique peptides.

The idea behind this experiment is to mix two pure proteomic
MS datasets of highly similar proteomes in predeﬁned ratios. The
challenge for the computational method is to correctly estimate
the fraction of each proteome in the dataset. To this end, we rely
on two datasets containing two different but closely related
cowpox virus strains: Krefeld (Kre) and Brighton Red (BR). A
more thorough description of these datasets is available in
(Doellinger et al., unpublished data). HEp-2 (ATCC-CRL-23)
cells were infected with the individual viruses and the viruses
were then puriﬁed, collected by centrifugation and washed. The
viral particles were then dissolved in ammonium bicarbonate.
Proteins were digested with trypsin, desalted and fractionated.
The peptide fractions were then analyzed with an Easy-nanoLC
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) coupled online to an LTQ Orbitrap
Discovery mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).

To reduce the number of contaminating spectra, we searched
both datasets against the human reference proteome and
removed all matches below a 5% FDR. To create the reference
proteomes for both viruses, their viral DNA sequences were
assembled and genes were identiﬁed based on existing NCBI
annotations for cowpox viruses. The reference proteomes for
both strains were created by translating the identiﬁed genes
into proteins (Doellinger et al., unpublished data).

We now mixed the remaining spectra to create 11 artiﬁcial
datasets with mixtures ranging from 100% Kre strain to 100%
BR strain by sampling spectra from the original datasets such
that each dataset contained 3000 spectra in total. To ensure a
balanced spectrum quality in all datasets, we sampled high-
and low-quality spectra in a 1:1 ratio from the original data-
sets where high quality was deﬁned as spectra within the 5%

FDR range when searched against the corresponding reference
proteome.

3.1.] Unweighted versus weighted Pipasic We processed the 11
datasets with Pipasic as described in the Section 2 using InsPecT
for peptide identiﬁcation and both the unweighted and expres-
sion-weighted similarity matrix. Figure 2 shows the calculated
abundance estimates plotted over the true fraction of Kre spectra
on the x-axis, such that the estimates for one dataset lie in a
column. The dashed lines represent the observed abundances
and emphasize the major challenge with these datasets: high rela-
tive abundance values are assigned to both proteomes, as the
bulk of the spectra could not be identiﬁed uniquely. Although
the unweighted correction (dash-dotted lines) clearly improves
on the observed abundances, we can still see the discrepancy to
the ground truth (solid circles). The expression-weighted correc-
tion (solid lines) yields the best approximation of the true abun-
dances. The error bars show the 95% conﬁdence interval of our
estimates, which was estimated by 100-fold bootstrapping from
our datasets. In particular, the weighted correction estimates zero
or low abundances if a proteome was not or ahnost not con-
tained in the metaproteomic dataset.

Furthermore, we repeated the experiment using the 20%
BR/80% Kre dataset, but successively increased the number of
reference proteomes by adding proteomes of other DNA viruses
to the database (BR and Kre proteomes were always present).
We used up to 20 proteomes (see Supplementary Text) and mea-
sured the Pipasic run time and estimation accuracy by calculating
the root mean squared error. Both metrics are shown in Figure 3.
The most time-consuming step of Pipasic is peptide identiﬁca-
tion, and therefore, its linear contribution is stronger than the
contribution of the similarity matrix calculation with quadratic
complexity. We also see that the error of the estimated abun-
dances is low for all considered database sizes and only increases
slightly with the number of proteomes.

3.1.2 Comparison to MEGAN To compare Pipasic with cur-
rently used approaches, we also applied MEGAN to the data,
which parses the results of a BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) search
against a reference database. An underlying phylogenetic tree
allows assigning of shared identiﬁcations to lowest common an-
cestor nodes in the tree, expressing the degree of ambiguity in the
results. In this way, MEGAN raises the signiﬁcance of the
unique identiﬁcations for the evaluation of the experiment.

We searched all 11 mixed cowpox virus datasets against the
Kre and BR reference proteome databases using InsPecT to
identify each spectrum with a peptide sequence. Then we
searched the peptide sequences with BLASTP in the reference
proteomes, such that all identiﬁcations could be placed to the cor-
rect position in the phylogenetic tree with MEGAN. Figure 4a
shows the output of MEGAN for the dataset containing 10%
Kre and 90% BR spectra. The size of the circles is log-propor-
tional to the number of assigned spectra, visualizing that the
majority of spectra was assigned to the higher level
Orthopoxvirus node. The leaves, representing Kre and BR, ob-
tained relatively few spectra: only 8.4% of all matches were
unique. In Figure 4b, we plotted for each dataset both the
unique matches to each proteome as well as the sum of shared
Cowpox virus and unique matches. Because the number of

Fig. 2. Effect of Pipasic correction: the relative abundances of 11 mixed
cowpox virus Kre/BR datasets were corrected with Pipasic without and
with expression correction. The observed abundances (dashed lines) are
insufﬁcient estimates for the true abundances (solid dots): in the extreme
cases of pure Kre or BR datasets the absent virus still receives 45%
abundance. The unweighted correction (dash—dotted line) improves on
this, but best results are obtained using the expression-weighted similarity
matrices (solid line). The error bars indicate the 95 % conﬁdence interval
after lOO-fold bootstrapping

shared matches is much higher than the number of unique
matches, the sum of unique and shared (dashed lines) is not
informative, as both proteomes obtain close to 50% relative
abundance. The number of unique matches (dash—dotted lines)
contains more information, and the resulting relative abundances
are closer to the ground truth. However, in the case of pure
datasets, still a signiﬁcant number of spectra is matching
uniquely to the absent species (about 15%). Here, the Pipasic
estimates (solid lines) are much closer to the ground truth.

3.2 AMD experiment

In the second experiment, we demonstrate the applicability of
Pipasic to metaproteomic data originating from a natural envir-
onment, which is more complex than our in silico metaproteome.
With this experiment, we show that Pipasic automatically cor-
rects abundances of highly similar reference proteomes without
affecting the abundances of other unrelated proteomes. For that
purpose, we used metaproteomic spectra of an AMD bioﬁlm
dataset described in Denef et al. (2010). AMD bioﬁlms are bac-
terial communities in a highly acidic environment. Thus, AMD
communities are not as complex as other microbial communities
and their composition is well understood.

We downloaded the metaproteomic spectra of sample 20 run 2
and the corresponding protein database from the authors’ Web
site (http://compbio.ornl.gov/bioﬁlm_amd_PIGT/ accessed in
March 2013). As the protein database contained sequences for
all dominant organisms, we manually divided the database into
six reference proteomes: Leptospirillum group II and III (Lepto2
and Lepto3), Ferroplasma acidarmanus Type I and II (Ferl and
Fer2), G-plasma and others, like contaminants and unassigned

Fig. 3. Inﬂuence of reference database size on Pipasic prediction accuracy
and run time. A dataset containing 20% BR and 80% Kre was searched
against a reference proteome database with increasing size. Prediction
accuracy was measured using the root mean squared error of the BR
and Kre estimates. The run time was measured for the complete
Pipasic run, including peptide identiﬁcation with InsPecT and abundance
correction, but without bootstrapping. The error is low for all database
sizes and only increases slightly with the database size. The run time
increases linearly with the number of reference proteomes, as peptide
identiﬁcation is the most time-consuming step in the pipeline

archaea and bacteria. Then we searched the spectra in the refer-
ence proteomes with Tide and counted the number of matching
spectra. We applied Pipasic with data weighting on the results to
obtain the corrected abundance estimates.

The results of this experiment are shown in Table 1. Here,
the effect of the correction is not as pronounced as in the
previous experiment owing to the relatively low similarity
values (maximum 0.21 compared with 0.92). Lepto3 receives
the strongest absolute correction (—359 PSMs) owing to the
protein sequence similarities with Lepto2, which receives low
relative correction. Ferl and Fer2 have the highest proteome
similarities in this experiment (0.21/0.19); their abundances
were reduced in sum by 48.3%. G-plasma has the least simi-
larity to the other proteomes (<0.04) and therefore receives
only little correction by 3%. Notably, the correction within
the Lepto group is asymmetric: Lepto3 receives stronger rela-
tive correction than Lepto2. Two opposing factors contribute
to this effect: ﬁrst, the number of peptide spectrum matches to
Lepto2 is more than twice as high as to Lepto3 (Table 1) and,
second, the probability to ﬁnd a Lepto2 spectrum in Lepto3
(Fig. 5) is ~30% higher than vice versa. Taken together, the
difference in abundance dominates the correction in the
Lepto group, such that the absolute number of Lepto2 pep-
tides that can also be found in Lepto3 is much higher than
vice versa.

This experiment demonstrates that the proposed Pipasic
method can handle real metaproteomic data and the calculated
estimates are in agreement with the expectation. The two main
groups Ferl/2 and Lepto2/3 receive abundance corrections
within each group, but not between the groups. This is note-
worthy because we did not require any prior information other
than the reference proteomes and shows that the similarity esti-
mates reﬂect the nature of the microbial community.

MEGAN and Pipasic on all 11 mixed cowpox virus datasets. For MEGAN, the number of unique and shared matches (dashed lines) shows almost no
difference between the two proteomes because the number of unique matches is low. The number of unique matches (dash—dotted lines) provides

abundances closer to the ground truth, but Pipasic (solid lines) yields the best estimates

Note: The peptide spectrum matches (PSM) were counted for each proteome and
subsequently corrected with Pipasic using a weighted similarity matrix. The results
show a strong relative correction for the highly similar Fer 1/2 and only small
relative correction for Lepto 2/ 3 and G-Plasma.

4 DISCUSSION

The experiments indicate that Pipasic allows the reliable separ-
ation of highly similar strains in metaproteomics experiments. It
can be used for reliably identifying and quantifying the contri-
butions of organisms and functional units even in cases when—
as in the cowpox virus data experiment—92% of all expressed
tryptic peptides are identical. In particular, Pipasic allows having
a phylogenetic resolution down to the strain level, which is in-
herently not feasible for lowest common ancestor approaches for
highly related species. This is also clearly visible in the compari-
son with MEGAN on the cowpox virus strain data (Fig. 4).
Given its reliability, Pipasic is preferable to approaches relying
solely on the analysis of unique peptides. Figure 4 indicates the
risk of analyzing unique peptides for highly related strains. Even
though the overall number of identiﬁed peptides per species is
above 1000, which is high for a metaproteomic setting, the
number of unique peptides remains low owing to the sequence
similarity. Thus, only few peptide identiﬁcations out of a thou-
sand decide on the identiﬁcation of a species when relying on
unique peptides. The example in Figure 4 highlights the risk:
even in cases when the ground truth contains 0% spectra of

Fig. 5. Pipasic similarity matrix with data weighting for the AMD experi-
ment. The matrix entries encode the probability that a peptide in a source
proteome can be found in a target proteome, modulated by the metapro-
teomic data (see Section 2). Here we see that the intra-group matrix
coefﬁcients for the Fer and Lepto group are greater than the inter-
group coefﬁcients. This means in practice that Pipasic corrects abun-
dances within but not between the two groups. It is noteworthy that
the matrix coefﬁcients can be asymmetric, which has the effect that abun-
dance can be shifted from one proteome to another rather than correcting
both proteomes equally

the Kre strain, MEGAN ﬁnds 17 unique peptides; this effect
was also observed when using the more conservative OMSSA
(Geer et al., 2004) search engine instead of InsPecT. These may
incorrectly be interpreted as proof of the presence of the Kre
strain. However, given that the original peptide identiﬁcation
search was conducted at a 5% FDR and given the large
number of spectra searched, these identiﬁcations are incorrect.
Because Pipasic leverages the computed similarity and the shared

peptides into the analysis, it is less at risk to overvalue these
incorrect identiﬁcations and correctly reduces the presence of
the Kre strain in this example down to a level where it cannot
be distinguished from a 0% presence.

This example also indicates that the statistical model behind
Pipasic contains and quantiﬁes uncertainty. A bootstrapping
strategy in the abundance estimation step allows us to obtain
conﬁdence statements for all estimates, and thereby the deﬁn-
ition of cutoffs for diagnostic decisions can be supported by
statistical statements. The reliability of an estimate obviously
primarily depends on data abundance—the number of support-
ing spectra—as well as on the computed and weighted similarity
of the species of interest.

Pipasic computes its similarity correction adjusted to the ex-
pression level of proteins. The cowpox virus data experiment
clearly indicates the signiﬁcance of this step for the results.
This step highlights a major difference between metaproteomics
and metagenomics: although the main idea of the metagenomic
method could be applied in metaproteomics, the method itself
must be tuned to the underlying difference in the biological data.
The expression level correction should also be applicable and
helpful in metatranscriptomics settings where also expression
level information can be confounded with the state of conserva-
tion. Here, we applied the correction only for complete prote-
omes of species because the number of spectra per species was
limited. In large-scale experiments, it should also be feasible to
adjust for protein groups separately.

With regard to quantiﬁcation, Pipasic currently relies exclu-
sively on spectral counts. While we observe positive results for
both the expression level correction and the quantiﬁcation in the
cowpox virus experiment, spectral counts have been shown to
have limitations with regard to the quantitative range and preci-
sion that they cover. Methods combining the intensity of mass
spectra with spectral counts, e.g. Dicker et al. (2010), could in
principle be integrated into the Pipasic framework and further
improve the quantiﬁcation exactness.

One general difﬁculty for metaproteomics is that all analyses
depend on the completeness of the provided reference proteomes
because purely de novo peptide identiﬁcation approaches are not
yet sufﬁciently reliable (Hettich et al., 2013). Thus, any quanti-
ﬁcation or identiﬁcation by Pipasic is also at risk of only reﬂect-
ing the available reference proteomes. Using an error-tolerant
peptide search strategy such as BICEPS (Renard et al., 2012),
peptides containing up to two amino acid substitutions can be
included and thereby this risk can be reduced.

Pipasic is currently not optimized for large-scale datasets and
can become computationally expensive because peptide identiﬁ-
cations need to be performed separately against all reference
proteomes and all pairwise string comparisons need to be
computed and accounted for. To overcome this, a two-step pro-
cedure may be helpful to ﬁrst identify all species having unique
identiﬁcations with existing methodology and then to run Pipasic
on those subsets that are expected to have a high sequence simi-
larity to ensure speciﬁcity of results.

5 CONCLUSION

With this contribution, we introduced Pipasic as a tool for iden-
tiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation in metaproteomics. Pipasic focuses

on correcting observed proteome abundances without having to
exclusively assign ambiguous peptide spectrum matches to their
correct origin among a potentially large number of reference
proteomes. Its particular strength is that it computes the peptide
level similarity between reference proteomes and thereby can re-
liably distinguish on the strain level. Further, Pipasic includes the
expression level in the analysis and thereby avoids bias resulting
from the correlation of conservation and expression in metapro-
teomics. Pipasic is implemented in Python and freely available as
an open-source project.

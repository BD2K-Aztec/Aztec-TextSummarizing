Abstract

Summary: For numerous experimental applications, PCR primers must be designed to efficiently
amplify a set of homologous DNA sequences while giving rise to amplicons with maximally di-
verse signatures. We developed DesignSignatures to automate the process of designing primers
for high-resolution melting (HRM), fragment length polymorphism (FLP) and sequencing experi-
ments. The program also finds the best restriction enzyme to further diversify HRM or FLP signa-
tures. This enables efficient comparison across many experimental designs in order to maximize

signature diversity.

Availability and implementation: DesignSignatures is accessible as a web tool at www.DEC|PHER.
cee.wisc.edu, or as part of the DECIPHER open source software package for R available from

1 Introduction

Primer design is a fundamental step to any application of polymer-
ase chain reaction (PCR), including high-resolution melting (HRM)
analysis, fragment length polymorphism (FLP) analysis and ampli-
con sequencing. Although these techniques differ considerably, a
common design objective is to construct primers that can efficiently
amplify many different template variants while maximizing the dif-
ference between the resulting amplicon ‘signatures’—melt curve,
length or sequence depending on the experimental method. While
many primer design tools are available (Noguera et al., 2014), there
currently does not exist a design tool that brings together different
experimental techniques sharing the objective of maximizing signa-
ture diversity. Moreover, no automatic method is available to design
primers for HRM analysis. Instead, semi-manual design approaches
are typically used with the aid of software for melt curve prediction
(Dwight et al., 2011). Although this approach is reasonable for dis-
criminating single nucleotide polymorphisms, it is unlikely to yield
optimal results when the goal is to differentiate more complex vari-
ants. Furthermore, when variants are impossible to distinguish with
FLP or HRM, digesting amplicons with a restriction enzyme can
greatly diversify their signatures (Akey et al., 2001). In such cases,

an automated solution is highly desirable for exploring the space of
possible primer and restriction enzyme pairings. By accurately pre-
dicting results in silico, design choices can be efficiently compared to
maximize resolving power and minimize costs.

2 Methods

DesignSignatures designs primers in three or four steps:

1. Designing forward and reverse primers that will efﬁciently amp-
lify as many input sequences (i.e. alleles) as possible.

2. Determining the set of PCR products for each combination of
forward and reverse primers.

3. Scoring each candidate primer pair based on the diversity of its
resulting amplicon signatures in sequencing, FLP or HRM.

4. Optionally, choosing the best restriction enzyme to further
maximize signature diversity in FLP or HRM experiments.

The user provides a set of unaligned input DNA sequences (see
the Supplementary Information (SI) text for usage information). The
sequences (i.e. alleles) may be grouped if multiple templates will be
present in the same PCR reaction, such as in the case of duplicate

genes. In design step 1, candidate 3’-ends are chosen that have the
highest 8-mer frequency, since the 3’-subsequence must generally
match all alleles for efficient amplification (Wright et al., 2014). The
most frequent 3’-ends are elongated into full-length primers that
achieve reasonably high hybridization efficiency (>80% by default)
at the user’s specified experimental conditions (Noguera et al.,
2014). If desired, ambiguity is incorporated into the primer se-
quences to encompass more variants. The candidate primers match-
ing the most input DNA sequences are used in subsequent steps.

In step 2, pairs of forward and reverse primers are used to
‘amplify’ the DNA in silico. In order to rapidly amplify many
groups using a large number of primer pairs (25 00), we configured
a fast method for predicting mismatched hybridization efficiency
(Yilmaz et al., 2012) to use DNA/DNA thermodynamic param-
eters. Regions of the DNA that are predicted to amplify with at
least moderate efficiency (>5 0% by default) are include in the set
of PCR products. In step 3, a signature is calculated for each set of
amplicons, weighted by their amplification efficiency and/or length
in accordance with the user’s application. For sequencing, the sig-
nature is the 5-mer histogram of each group (i.e. allele), which is
commonly used for classification. For FLP, the signature is the
length(s) of amplicons belonging to each group. For HRM, the sig-
nature is the melt curve calculated using a linear-time algorithm
(Tostesen et al., 2003) with unified nearest neighbor parameters
(SantaLucia, 1998).

Amplicon signatures are scored based on their average pairwise
divergence (LP-norm, where p = 1 by default) across all groups of in-
put sequences. This approach rewards divergent signatures, and ef-
fectively penalizes similar signatures. The highest scoring primer
pairs are then returned to the user, unless it is specified that a restric-
tion enzyme will be used after PCR amplification. In step 4, restric-
tion enzymes are used to digest the amplicons in silico into a set of
shorter products. The set of all restriction enzymes available from
New England BioLabs is provided for enzyme selection. The same
scoring methodology is applied to the resulting DNA fragments ac-
cording to the user’s application. Finally, the top scoring combin-
ations of primers and enzyme are returned to the user. The web tool
also outputs visualizations of the predicted signatures and their pair-
wise distances.

3 Results

We first tested our algorithm for primer design by comparing its
results to those of commonly used primers with the same objective
(refer to the SI text for experimental methods). Although we would
not expect the algorithm to output exactly the same primers, we
would expect it to target the amplification of similar regions. As
input, we used a set of 1601 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons ex-
tracted from 550 publically available bacterial genomes. Sequences
were grouped by their genus of origin because many genomes con-
tain more than one rRNA operon. We began by designing primers
for amplicon sequencing with a product length between 350 and
500 base pairs (Fig. 1a). The top scoring primers overlapped with
U515F and E939R, which are commonly used in 16S-based studies
of bacterial diversity (Baker et al., 2003). Next we designed pri-
mers for FLP analysis using the same input set. This yielded pri-
mers surrounding the variable length internal transcribed spacer
(Fig. 1a), which is the same region used for automated ribosomal
intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), an FLP-based method (Jones
et al., 2007).

Since an equivalently widespread application does not yet exist
for HRM analysis, we focused on designing primers targeting a

Fig. 1. (a) Primers designed by DesignSignatures were very similar to those
commonly used for sequencing and ARISA targeting the rRNA operon. (b)
Predictions of the melting peak for 15 distinct PCR products correlated
strongly with those determined experimentally. (c) Primers designed to target
the rpoB gene for HRM analysis resulted in substantially more diverse melt
curve signatures after digestion with a restriction enzyme

variable region of the RNA Polymerase Subunit B (rpoB) gene,
which is commonly used as a phylogenetic marker for bacteria be-
longing to the genus Streptomyces. We first verified our implementa-
tion of the algorithm for melt curve prediction using a set of 15
amplicons with diverse melt temperatures (Tm). Observed and pre-
dicted melt peaks were strongly correlated with an R2 = 0.993, indi-
cating that Tm prediction was very precise (Fig. 1b). However, Tm
values required linear transformation to achieve high accuracy, as is
typically observed due to the effects of salt concentration and inter-
calating dyes (Rasmussen et al., 2007). Nevertheless, repeatable pre-
dictive offsets effectively cancel out since HRM analysis occurs on a
relative basis.

To test the HRM algorithm, we designed primers for distinguish-
ing the 26 rpoB sequences belonging to the genus Streptomyces
available from GenBank. The results indicated that the top scoring
primers would not generate sufficiently distinct melting signatures
for the purposes of typing new strains. In contrast, digestion of the
amplicons with a restriction enzyme (CviKI-1) was predicted to sep-
arate most strains. We verified these predictions experimentally by
using the top scoring primers to amplify the DNA of 27 new
Streptomyces isolates with different rpoB sequences, followed by di-
gestion of the PCR products. As the outputs had indicated, the melt
curve signatures after digestion were considerably more diverse than
pre-digestion (Fig. 1c). This confirmed that DesignSignatures can as-
sist in challenging experimental designs by suggesting primers, pre-
dicting their amplicons’ signatures and indicating when it may be
necessary to use a restriction enzyme or choose another target gene
to achieve more diverse signatures.

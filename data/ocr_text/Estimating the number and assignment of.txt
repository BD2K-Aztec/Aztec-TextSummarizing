Abstract

Motivation: Molecular-clock methods can be used to estimate evolutionary rates and timescales
from DNA sequence data. However, different genes can display different patterns of rate variation
across lineages, calling for the employment of multiple clock models. Selecting the optimal clock-
partitioning scheme for a multigene dataset can be computationally demanding, but clustering
methods provide a feasible alternative. We investigated the performance of different clustering
methods using data from chloroplast genomes and data generated by simulation.

Results: Our results show that mixture models provide a useful alternative to traditional partition-
ing algorithms. We found only a small number of distinct patterns of among-lineage rate variation
among chloroplast genes, which were consistent across taxonomic scales. This suggests that the
evolution of chloroplast genes has been governed by a small number of genomic pacemakers. Our
study also demonstrates that clustering methods provide an efficient means of identifying clock-
partitioning schemes for genome-scale datasets.

1 Introduction

Evolutionary rates and timescales can be estimated from nucleotide
sequences using molecular-clock models, which describe the pattern
of rate variation among lineages. The various clock models share a
reliance on age calibrations, but they differ in their assumptions
about the number and distribution of distinct evolutionary rates (re-
viewed by Ho and Duchéne, 2014). For example, the strict molecu-
lar clock assumes a single rate across all lineages (Zuckerkandl and
Pauling, 1962), whereas uncorrelated relaxed clocks allow branches
to have distinct rates that are drawn from the same distribution
(Drummond et al., 2006; Rannala and Yang, 2007). There are vari-
ous model-selection methods for identifying the best-fitting clock
model for a dataset of interest (e.g. using marginal likelihoods; Baele
et al., 2013). The choice of clock model can have substantial impacts
on phylogenetic estimates, particularly those of evolutionary rates
and timescales.

Rates of molecular evolution often vary among lineages, but this
pattern of variation can differ across sites and across genes (Gaut
et al., 2011; Muse and Gaut, 1997). Therefore, when complex se-
quence data are being analyzed, the use of multiple clock models
might provide a better fit (e.g. higher marginal likelihood) than a
single clock model. For example, separate clock models might be
applied to different genes or codon positions.

In analyses of multigene datasets, there are usually many possible
partitioning schemes. Identifying the best-fitting schemes involves
two components: determining the optimal number of clusters, and
assigning the genes to these clusters. In Bayesian analyses, this can
be done using Bayes factors to compare different clock-partitioning
schemes (Ho and Lanfear, 2010). However, such an approach is im-
practical when there are many candidate schemes, as is often the
case for multigene or genome-scale datasets, because the statistical
fit of every possible scheme would need to be assessed.

Clustering methods provide a computationally feasible means of
identifying appropriate clock-partitioning schemes, by grouping
subsets of the data according to their pattern of among-lineage rate
variation (Duchéne et al., 2014). Similar approaches are available
for selecting partitioning schemes for substitution models (Frandsen
et al., 2015). The software ClockstaR, which was designed to iden-
tify the best-fitting clock-partitioning scheme for multigene datasets
(Duchéne et al., 2014), employs a k-medoids clustering algorithm
known as partitioning around medoids (Kaufman and Rousseeuw,
2005). However, other clustering methods, such as k-means and
Gaussian mixture modeling, have not been tested in the context of
clock-model selection. One advantage of Gaussian mixture models
is that they can represent the shapes of clusters flexibly by using co-
variance matrices. For example, they can use a diagonal covariance
matrix to identify clusters with ellipsoidal shapes, such that they
might have higher accuracy than k-medoids.

Here we test the performance of three different clustering meth-
ods for identifying the clusters of patterns of among-lineage rate
variation in multigene datasets: variational inference Gaussian mix-
ture model (VBGMM), Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model
(DPGMM), and partitioning around medoids (PAM). We evaluate
these three methods using simulated data and apply them to chloro-
plast genome sequences from angiosperms. We find that the optimal
number of clusters for these datasets range from one to three. Our
results also reveal that mixture models, such as VBGMM and
DPGMM, tend to detect a larger number of clusters than methods
based on partitioning, such as PAM. Mixture models also appear to
be more robust than PAM in that they can detect the correct number
of clusters in a broader range of simulation conditions.

2 Methods

2.1 Clustering methods
We compared the performance of three different methods: VBGMM
and DPGMM, as implemented in the Python module Scikit-learn
v0.16 (Pedregosa et al., 2012), and PAM implemented in the R
package Cluster v1.15 (Maechler et al., 2005). The PAM algorithm,
also known as k-medoids, is very similar to the k-means algorithm.
It involves randomly choosing k data points from the data, known
as the ‘medoids’. The remaining data points are assigned to their
closest medoid to form k clusters. In the next step, the medoids are
replaced by the data points that are closest to the center of each clus-
ter, resulting in new medoids. The data points are reassigned to the
new medoids. The last two steps are repeated until the medoids are
the same for successive iterations. To select the optimal value of k,
we use the Gap statistic, which uses the ratio of cluster width to dis-
tance between clusters, as a measure of goodness-of-fit (Tibshirani
et al., 2001). In our analyses, each cluster represents a group of
genes that have similar patterns of among-lineage rate variation.
The VBGMM and DPGMM assume that the data were gener-
ated from a mixture of Gaussian probability distributions, also
known as ‘components’, with unknown parameters. Both of these
methods incorporate information about the covariance structure of
the data. The most commonly used are the spherical and the diag-
onal covariance matrices. The spherical covariance matrix assumes
that each cluster has the same variance across dimensions, resulting
in spherical clusters. In contrast, in the diagonal covariance matrix
the variance can differ among dimensions, such that clusters can
take ellipsoidal shapes. The number of components for VBGMM is
finite, so they need to be specified a priori. To select the optimal
value, we calculate the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for

values of k from 1 to 11—1, where n is the number of data points. In
DPGMM, the number of components is infinite, but the number of
clusters to which the data are assigned is defined by a Dirichlet pro-
cess. In practice, the implementation of DPGMM requires an upper
bound for the number of components, which we set as n— 1. For
both the VBGMM and the DPGMM algorithms, we used the BIC to
compare the fit of diagonal and spherical covariance matrices.
However, the BIC cannot be computed for PAM, such that the per-
formance of this method cannot be assessed using this metric.

2.2 Chloroplast genome data

We obtained complete chloroplast genome sequences of angio-
sperms from GenBank (accession numbers in Supplementary Table
S1). The advantage of analyzing genes from the non-recombining
chloroplast genome is that they all share the same topology, which
is an important requirement of these methods. We initially aligned
all protein-coding genes using MUSCLE v3.5 (Edgar, 2004), fol-
lowed by visual inspection. Three genes (z'an, ycf1 and ycf2) were
excluded because of alignment ambiguities, leaving 76 genes for sub-
sequent analysis, although this number varied among taxonomic
groups. To reduce potential impacts of missing data, we excluded
any sites in the alignment at which a gap was present for 280% of
taxa.

Our initial dataset contained 183 taxa, including representatives
of all major angiosperm groups. We drew subsamples to form five
datasets representing different taxonomic levels: (i) angiosperms (18
taxa); (ii) eudicots (15 taxa); (iii) rosids (13 taxa); (iv) Poaceae (20
taxa); and (v) Asteraceae (7 taxa). For the Poaceae and Asteraceae
datasets, some gene alignments consisted primarily of missing data,
so we removed these alignments and used 61 and 74 genes, respect-
ively, instead of the 76 genes in the complete set of gene alignments.
For each of the five taxonomic datasets, we concatenated all of the
genes to infer the topology using maximum likelihood in PhyML
v3.1 (Guindon et al., 2010) with the GTR+F nucleotide substitution
model. We then estimated individual gene trees while constraining
the tree topology to that inferred from the concatenated data, which
is equivalent to optimizing the branch lengths.

Clustering algorithms typically cluster data points represented in
an n-dimensional space. Previous studies have used individual
branch lengths as dimensions in which to represent gene trees as
data points (e.g. dos Reis et al., 2012; Duchene et al., 2014;
Duchene and Ho, 2015 ). We used the same approach by treating the
branch lengths as a proportion of the total tree length and using a
logo transformation. Our empirical data and example code are
available online (https://github.com/sebastianduchene/pacemaker_
clustering_methods).

2.3 Simulations

To test the performance of the clustering methods under known con-
ditions, we first generated datasets by simulating data points using
the mixture model with the highest fit according to the BIC. This
involved sampling data points from the mixture of distributions
inferred by the model. We also simulated data under optimal condi-
tions for the PAM algorithm. To do this, we estimated the mean and
standard deviation of each dimension for each cluster inferred using
the mixture models to represent the clusters as multivariate normal
distributions. We then sampled data points from these distributions.
In both simulation scenarios, the simulations have the same dimen-
sions as the chloroplast genome data described above, but they differ
in the shape and spread of the clusters. We conducted 100 simula-
tions for each of the chloroplast datasets and analyzed them using

all of the clustering algorithms. We analyzed the simulated datasets
using the mixture models, then we selected the model with the high-
est statistical fit and noted the optimal value of k. We also estimated
k using the Gap statistic under the PAM algorithm.

Our simulations serve two specific purposes. First, they allow us
to assess the stability, or reproducibility, of the methods; that is,
whether the same model and value of k is recovered for datasets gen-
erated under the same simulation conditions. Second, the simula-
tions can be interpreted as parametric bootstrap replicates: if the
inferences of the model are robust, the simulated datasets should
have the same optimal model and number of clusters as those
inferred for the empirical data.

3 Results

In our analyses of five chloroplast datasets, the VBGMM with a
spherical covariance matrix had higher fit than the other mixture
models (Table 1). Using this method, the optimal number of clusters
ranged from one to three across the five datasets (Fig. 1;
Supplementary Fig. S1). The PAM algorithm inferred one cluster for
Poaceae, rosids, and eudicots, and two clusters for Asteraceae and
angiosperms. Although the number of clusters inferred by all of the
methods was similar, VBGMM with a spherical covariance matrix
tended to infer the largest number of clusters. The exception was the
angiosperm dataset, for which VBGMM with a spherical covariance
matrix only identified one cluster, whereas the other methods identi-
fied two clusters. Importantly, for all datasets there were at least
some discrepancies in the number of clusters inferred by the meth-
ods. The PAM algorithm inferred the smallest number of clusters for
almost all of the datasets.

Our analyses of data simulated under mixture models showed
that the algorithms with mixture models correctly identified the
model used to generate the data and the number of clusters for a ma-
jority of the simulations (Table 2). In all cases, the VBGMM with a
spherical covariance matrix presented the highest statistical fit for
all 100 simulations. For the chloroplast data from angiosperms,
Poaceae and eudicots, the estimated value of k matched the true
value in all 100 simulation replicates. For rosids, the correct value of
k was recovered for 97% of the simulated datasets. The mixture
model fitted to the Asteraceae dataset performed the most poorly. In
this case, the correct value of k was recovered for only 69% of the
simulated datasets. The fact that the frequency of the optimal k is
overall high for the mixture model also indicates that it is stable,
yielding similar estimates for data simulated under the same
conditions.

For the simulations based on mixture models, the PAM algo-
rithm performed more poorly (Table 2). It only recovered the true
value of k for the simulations using the model fitted to the angio-
sperms. For the other simulations, it tended to estimate a larger
number of clusters, from five in the simulations using the model

fitted to Poaceae to eight for the simulations under the model fitted
to the rosids. The stability of this algorithm was also much lower
than that of the mixture models for most datasets. For example, for
the Asteraceae data, the most frequent value of k was present in 20
of the 100 simulated datasets, with many different values of k being
inferred for the remaining 80 simulated datasets. This probably
occurred because this dataset contains a small number of points,
such that there is greater variation among simulation replicates. The
simulations using the model fitted to the angiosperm data had more
stable results, with a frequency of 1.00 for k = 1.

In our analyses of data simulated under conditions consistent
with the assumptions of the PAM algorithm, we found that both
mixture models and PAM recovered the correct number of clusters
with a frequency of 1.00. As with the data simulated using mixture
models, the VGBMM with a spherical covariance matrix had the
highest statistical fit among the mixture models. Collectively, our

Results are based on analyses of 100 simulations under the model ﬁtted to
each of the ﬁve chloroplast datasets. In all cases, the most frequently chosen
mixture model was the VGBMM with a spherical covariance matrix (fre-
quency of 1.00). kmixtme is the most frequent k for analyses of the data simu-
lated using mixture models. kpA M is the most frequent k for the analyses using
the PAM algorithm, with its corresponding frequency.

analyses of simulated data show that mixture models and the PAM
algorithm perform well when the model used to generate the data
matches that used to infer the number of clusters. However, mixture
models performed well even when the data were simulated using a
scenario based on PAM, such that they provide more robust
estimates.

4 Discussion

We investigated the performance of three different clustering meth-
ods for grouping genes according to their pattern among-lineage
rate variation. We have found that the VBGMM with a spherical co-
variance matrix provides the best fit among the mixture models to a
range of chloroplast datasets, and our simulation study confirms the
stability of this method. The PAM algorithm failed to recover the
simulation conditions under VBGMM in most cases, probably be-
cause the shape of the clusters is difficult to capture using this
method. In contrast, VBGMM frequently estimated the correct
number of clusters irrespective of the simulation method. This dif-
fers from the results of previous studies of clustering methods for
branch-length patterns, which found that the PAM algorithm ap-
peared to perform well (Duchene and Ho, 2014, 2015; Duchéne
et al., 2014). However, we reanalyzed a mammalian genome dataset
from our previous study (Duchene and Ho, 2015) and found a simi-
lar number of clusters (Supplementary Material); the most stable
mixture model (DPGMM) supported seven clusters, compared with
13 using PAM in the original study. This suggests that, in empirical
studies, it is important to compare the inferences from different clus-
tering algorithms. In this study, for example, the estimated numbers
of clusters for the empirical data are very similar among clustering
algorithms. We find that mixture models provide a powerful alter-
native that can flexibly accommodate different cluster shapes. The
results from these models also appear more stable under different
simulation conditions, at least for the datasets analyzed here.
Another advantage of these methods is that their parametric nature
offers a simple framework for conducting simulations, which should
be done routinely to assess the robustness of the results.
Importantly, the shape of the clusters and choice of covariance

structure do not necessarily have biological implications. Rather,
they provide a convenient mathematical description of the cluster
shapes.

The clusters identified in our analyses represent groups of genes
that have similar patterns of among-lineage rate variation. All of the
clustering algorithms suggest that the evolution of chloroplast gen-
omes in angiosperms and nuclear genomes in mammals has been
governed by a small number of pacemakers, each of which leads to a
distinct pattern of rate variation among lineages (Ho, 2014; Snir
et al., 2012). This is consistent with previous findings from prokary-
otes (Snir, 2014), Drosophila, and yeast (Snir et al., 2014).
Furthermore, comparing the gene clusters across our five angio-
sperm datasets reveals that there is some consistency in pacemakers
across different taxonomic scales (Fig. 1). However, additional
work will be needed to understand the biological bases of these
pacemakers.

Identifying genes with similar patterns of among-lineage rate
variation has important applications in phylogenetic analyses.
Notably, in molecular dating studies, estimates of divergence times
have been shown to be more accurate if a separate relaxed-clock
model is assigned to each cluster of genes (Duchene and Ho, 2014).
Our results indicate that multigene datasets might only exhibit a
small number of distinct patterns of rate variation among lineages.
This has notable implications for analyses of genome-scale datasets,
for which only a small number of relaxed-clock models might be
sufficient to capture the key components of evolutionary rate vari-
ation. To this end, clustering methods provide a feasible and reliable
alternative to more computationally demanding approaches to se-
lecting clock-partitioning schemes for molecular dating analyses. In
particular, mixture models might have better performance than the
k-medoids and k-means algorithms for genomic data because they
can model clusters of different shapes. Increasing the adoption of
these methods will help to improve estimates of evolutionary rates
and timescales from genome-scale datasets.

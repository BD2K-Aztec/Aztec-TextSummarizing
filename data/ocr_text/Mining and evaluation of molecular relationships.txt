ABSTRACT

Motivation: Specific information on newly discovered proteins is
often difficult to find in literature. Particularly if only sequences and
no common names of proteins or genes are available, preceding
sequence similarity searches can be crucial for the process of
information collection. In drug research, it is important to know
whether a small molecule targets only one specific protein or whether
similar or homologous proteins are also influenced that may account
for possible side effects.

Results: prolific (protein-literature investigation for interacting
compounds) provides a one-step solution to investigate available
information on given protein names, sequences, similar proteins or
sequences on the gene level. Co-occurrences of UniProtKB/Swiss-
Prot proteins and PubChem compounds in all PubMed abstracts
are retrievable. Concise ‘heat-maps’ and tables display frequencies
of co-occurrences. They provide links to processed literature with
highlighted found protein and compound synonyms. Evaluation with
manually curated drug—protein relationships showed that up to 69%
could be discovered by automatic text-processing. Examples are
presented to demonstrate the capabilities of prolific.

1 INTRODUCTION

Collecting information on proteins in the large and fast growing
body of available biomedical information can be an elaborate
task, particularly if proteins are only rarely investigated, newly
predicted or sequenced, or if no common names are available for
proteins and genes. Researchers may want to search for potential
lead structures for given targets, determine the function of the
protein, or analyse side effects of drugs with regard to protein
similarity. To gather needed information for proteins as possible
targets for chemical compounds, there are a variety of databases
available providing manually curated information (Aranda et al.,

2010; Gunther et al., 2008; Knox et al., 2011; Kuhn et al., 2010;
Sharman et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2010a). However, a need for
information beyond the scope of the existing databases often requires
researchers to ﬁnd information in biomedical texts by searching
PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) with MeSH terms.
Although the texts are rather unstructured, PubMed is widely
accepted as the most comprehensive and up—to—date source for
biomedical information (Berardi et al., 2008). While subsequent
analysis of information found in texts seems inevitable, text— or data—
mining tools greatly enhance the process of information collection
(Alex et al., 2008). A variety of tools can be found Via the Critical
Assessment of Information Extraction systems in Biology initiative
(BioCreAtIvE, Krallinger et al., 2008). Several tools focus on
the recognition of proteins and genes in texts (Hur et al., 2009)
or extraction of information of relationships between biological
entities (Rebholz—Schuhmann et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2010b).
Others focus on a convenient provision of mined data of several
types like proteins, drugs and diseases Via web service (Rebholz—
Schuhmann et al., 2008) or the co—occurrence of biological entities
like EXCERPT (Mewes et al., 2011), CoPub (Fleuren et al., 2011)
and CIL (Griining et al., 2011). Finding co—occurences of biological
entities is a well—accepted method for ﬁnding associations of any
type that may be hidden in context or implicit (Andronis et al., 2011)
and supports on—going research in Natural Language Processing.
CIL was recently published, enabling users to search for compound
structures, similar structures and names in all PubMed abstracts.
Proteins referred to in those texts are related to the compounds. The
relationships and their frequency are displayed as results.

proliﬁc (protein—literature investigation for interacting
compounds) closes the gap between protein information in
literature and sequence information on proteins with a one—step
solution. Thus, it complements CIL. It enables researchers to
collect a variety of information on proteins without identiﬁers or
synonyms. Similar sequences are searched and all compounds
mentioned in the same context are identiﬁed. It provides all
information including abstracts with highlighted found entities in
a pre—calculated, swiftly accessible database Visualizing data in
a ‘heat—map’ with colours representing displayed values. Thus,
proliﬁc has a protein—centric point of View, in contrast to CIL with
its compound—centric View, allowing to obtain new information on
proteins, compounds and their relationships. However, this requires
specialized data structures allowing for high speed data retrieval for
the large amount of data. The interconnection of both applications
results in an additional beneﬁt, enabling users to switch between
protein and compound literature research using result compounds

in CIL and result proteins in proliﬁc as query compounds and
proteins with minimal effort.

Possible ﬁelds of application of proliﬁc are depicted with three
paradigm scenarios: the literature search for new drugs or potential
lead structures based on known drug—target interactions, the analyses
of drugs’ side effects, and the discovery of the function of newly
sequenced genes.

2 DATA AND METHODS
2.1 Databases

All titles, abstracts, keywords and substance terms of articles contained
in PubMed possessing abstracts (11.7 million out of 20.6 million) were
made locally available in proliﬁc. Furthermore, the local database contains
all PubChem (Bolton et al., 2008) compounds (35.4 million) with 606.3
million (partially overlapping) synonyms. Those are connected to their 28.3
million annotated parents (i.e. basic compounds without ions, etc.) and all
UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot (Magrane and Consortium, 2011) protein IDs (i.e.
from the manually annotated section of UniProt) with 2.0 million synonyms.
Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) terms (Barrel et al., 2009) and their
‘gene symbols’ were attached to protein IDs. PubChem parents and GOA
gene symbols were used to pool very similar compounds (e.g. diclofenac
sodium and diclofenac potassium) or homologues of different organisms,
respectively.

2.2 Finding similar proteins

By default, protein synonym searches in the database are conducted
using the unmodiﬁed user input. If users decide to use an approximate
search, wildcards are used as sufﬁx or spelling correction is used to
ﬁnd misspelled names (Hunspell, http://hunspell.sourceforgenet). Sequence
similarity is determined for protein and nucleotide sequences utilising
BLAST+ (Camacho et al., 2009).

2.3 Finding biological entities in texts

Protein synonyms were searched using the Whatizit web services (Rebholz—
Schuhmann et al., 2008). Abstracts were retrieved from the local database and
passed to Whatizit. Protein synonyms in abstracts and titles were annotated
with protein IDs by Whatizit. Annotated texts were stored in the local
database and parsed to store protein—article relationships after ﬁltering with a
protein ‘stop word list’. It is composed of natural language words and words
with a high frequency of occurrence which have to be ﬁltered out because of
unspeciﬁc meanings (e.g. ‘And’ for the ‘Calmodulin—related protein 97A’
or ‘ANOVA’ usually used in statistical context but also as abbreviation
for ‘RNA—binding protein Nova—2’). The list was generated after analysing
synonyms of found compounds and their frequencies of occurrences in all
PubMed articles.

Compound synonyms were searched in all PubMed articles with available
abstracts following the synonym processing rules described in Hettne et al.
(2009). Titles, abstracts, MeSH terms and substance names were indexed
and searched with all compound synonyms provided by PubChem. Found
article—compound relationships were stored in the database, after ﬁltering
with a compound stop word list analogous to the protein stop word list.

Protein—article—compound relationships were grouped in four grading
classes: (i) co—occurrence of protein and compound in the abstract, (ii)
co—occurrence in the same sentence, (iiia) co—occurrence in the same
sentence enclosing a ‘functional process’ or ‘molecular function’ derived
from the Gene Ontology (Ashbumer et al., 2000) and (iiib) co—occurrences
in a sentence enclosing curated ‘relationship’ verbs, derived by analysing
approximately 2 million randomly selected abstracts for verbs occurring with
compounds and proteins in the same sentence. Those relationships were
assembled and stored de—normalized in a NoSQL database, allowing fast
access to the large amount of data.

To obtain precision, recall, and F—Score, a test set of 120 articles was
randomly selected from the SuperTarget database (Hecker et al., 2012).
SuperTarget provides manually curated compound—target relations with
associated PubMed references. To include all compounds (also non—drugs)
and all proteins (also non—targets) the abstracts were re—annotated by four
Biologists and Bioinformaticians.

Those abstracts were searched in the proliﬁc database. Precision and recall
were calculated with the resulting found proteins and compounds and the
annotations of the abstracts.

2.4 Quality assessment

To evaluate the results of proliﬁc, DrugBank target proteins, drugs and
drug—target relationships were used. DrugBank provides about 1500 FDA
approved drugs (and additional 4000 experimental drugs), 3800 targets
and about 1400 drug—target relationships with approved drugs. proliﬁc was
queried using all target proteins from DrugBank. Subsequently, result data
were analysed to see if drug—target relationships of DrugBank are contained
and at which rank they are placed in the result list. Reasons for missed
drug—targets were assessed quantitatively where possible, or qualitatively
otherwise.

Hyperlinks to all downloaded data, synonym lists and stop word lists
used in proliﬁc are provided in the Supplementary Material. Text indexing
and search took place using Xapian (Xapian 1.2.0, http://xapian.0rg). Data
was stored in a PostgreSQL database (PostgreSQL 8.4.8, PostgreSQL Global
Development Group). De—nonnalized data was stored in a NoSQL database
(MongoDB 1.8.1, 10gen, Inc., New York, USA). A ﬁxed update schedule of
the de—normalized relation will be performed every 6 months.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Workﬂow

The proliﬁc workﬁow and the search process is not visible for the
user, but can be controlled by adjusting search parameters (Fig. 1).
A query can be started with names, IDs, or sequences. If the exact
name is unknown for a search with names, an approximate search
can be triggered. In the case of ID or name searches, the database
will be queried for corresponding sequences. A similarity search
is conducted with query sequences or sequences obtained from
the database within the set of protein sequences available in the
database. The database is queried for all PubMed articles containing
found proteins. Compounds mentioned in those abstracts found by
proliﬁc are retrieved from the pre—calculated database. Subsequently,
results will be evaluated, counted and visualized. An option to read
the texts with highlighted found entities is provided to the user. If too
few or too many results are found, search parameters can be adjusted
for e. g. lower similarity search thresholds or to narrow searches for
co—occurrences with protein and compound in the same sentence,
enclosing a ‘functional’ GO term or ‘relationship’ verb.

3.2 Relationships of protein synonyms, compound
synonyms and articles

In all abstracts, 8.8 million relationships could be found between
protein synonyms and articles. Between compounds and articles 12.5
million relationships were found. After assembling, 309.5 million
protein—article—compound relationships were available. Besides the
web —interface, data can be accessed via web service.

Precision and recall were calculated as 94 and 72% (F—
Score: 82%).

possibility to adapt parameters, e.g. if no results are found with default
settings or to narrow searches for co—occurrences of protein and compound
in the same sentence.

3.3 Data validation

Using the targets of all drug—target relationships of DrugBank as
query proteins in proliﬁc, 56% of all DrugBank relationships could
be found as protein—compound relationships (Table 1). Considering
that proliﬁc does not include biologicals (e. g. antibodies and nucleic
acids) and some proteins or drugs could not be found in any abstract,
69% of the relationships were identiﬁed. Qualitative analyses of
50 out of the 357 relationships not found with proliﬁc revealed
that in 132 analysed full articles 78 abstracts contained a protein
synonym deviating too much from UniProt synonyms, 48 contained
target synonyms only in the article body, and six targets were DNA
or RNA. The 102 protein or compound synonyms not found in
the abstracts separately were e. g. too exact (‘gamma—aminobutyric
acid receptor subunit rho—1’ instead of ‘GABA’) or had only IDs
(i.e. alpha—numeric codes) in the respective synonym database.
If the relationships were found, 70% of the drugs were found
as compounds in the ﬁrst 100 places of the proliﬁc result order
(Table 2). Of all compounds found with proliﬁc for which the query
proteins are available in both databases, on average 23% (Median,
interquartile range 17—27, FDA approved drugs only) and 32%
(Median, interquartile range 27—40, FDA approved and experimental
drugs) were contained in DrugBank.

3.4 Visualization

Results of proliﬁc queries are presented in a heat—map, with colours
indicating the frequencies at which protein synonyms co—occur with
compound synonyms in abstracts (Fig. 2). A ‘noise ﬁlter’ is applied
to the table to display only those relationships occurring more
frequently than a given threshold. The threshold can be adjusted
in the parameter settings. Columns represent proteins found with
the query sequence, name or ID and similar proteins found via
BLAST. Proteins are sorted by similarity. Furthermore, proteins are

pooled by their gene symbol inherited from GOA. This allows for a
more compact overview and merges proteins found independently
of organisms with identical results. Rows represent compounds (i.e.
their synonyms) found in the abstracts assigned to found proteins.
The order is given by the row’s sum of abstracts. Compounds are
pooled by their parents for a better overview and because synonyms
of some derivatives may largely overlap and thus yield equal results.

Synonyms and sketches of compounds as well as (E) values and
synonyms of proteins are provided by hovering over row or column
headers with the mouse, hyperlinks lead to UniProt and PubChem.
Table cells are linked to article lists where users can inspect title,
abstract, keywords and substance terms in which found entities are
highlighted, and which are linked to UniProt, PubChem and PubMed
(Fig. 3). Moreover, the article lists show the numbers for restricted
searches e.g. co—occurrences in the same sentence. In case a user
decides for a conventional result table, an alternative view can be
selected on the results page.

3.5 proliﬁc-CIL interplay

Compounds mentioned in proliﬁc results can be clicked to initiate
subsequent CIL searches. Vice versa, CIL has been enhanced and
now allows for querying proliﬁc with proteins from CIL’s result set.
Additionally, menus were added to the heat—maps’ column headers
enabling users to query proliﬁc repeatedly with homologues of
proliﬁc‘s results and analogously CIL with similar compounds of
CIL’s results. CIL has been updated with the newly generated data
with regard to stop word lists, current compound synonyms, protein
synonyms and abstracts.

compounds ordered by frequency of occurrence covers most of
the drug—target relationships, still allowing for a comprehensive
overview. Missing relationships are mainly caused by synonyms
strongly deviating in texts from those in databases and relationships
mentioned in the article body only, not in the abstract. The latter
could be addressed in the future by using full texts increasingly
available via ‘Open Access’ initiatives, while the former one points
out the need for good vocabularies not only containing scientiﬁc
or common names but also e. g. common abbreviations, which in
turn must be speciﬁc enough. Almost a quarter up to a third of
the compounds found with proliﬁc is a drug in DrugBank with
described drug—target relationships. Further investigation should
analyse in detail the remaining part of found compounds. However,
those results highlight the capabilities of proliﬁc in ﬁnding and
visualizing literature data containing protein—drug as well as other
protein—compound co—occurrences.

3.7 Paradigm scenarios

To demonstrate the capabilities of the database, three paradigm
scenarios were analysed in which proliﬁc supports and expedites
research.

Potential lead structure search: Brd4 is a new cancer—related
drug—target (Blobel et al., 2011). Using the sequence of Brd4 as
query, proliﬁc shows all related proteins containing a bromodomain
and the related known inhibitors, e. g. Brd2 and doxorubicin. These
compounds could be considered as possible lead compounds for the
screening of speciﬁc Brd4 inhibitors. Direct links are provided to
related literature.

Protein function prediction: Q813T7 is a predicted protein of
Bacillus cereus with some evidence at protein level. Using the
sequence as query in proliﬁc shows that ATP and cob(I)alamin are
the most mentioned compounds in literature related to homologous
proteins. Estimating the function on the basis of sequence similarity
with InterPro (Hunter et al., 2009), the protein is predicted as
a cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase using ATP as a co—substrate.
proliﬁc highlights the related literature that describes the putative
molecular function in a single step.

Side eﬁ‘ect prediction: the dopamine—4—receptor is a main target
for drugs against schizophrenia. Searching for related compounds
with proliﬁc (Fig. 2) reveals that dopamine, serotonin and
clozapine are most mentioned in the same context of the receptor.
Furthermore, many abstracts exist that describe the relationship of
the compounds to the dopamine—2—receptor and the dopamine—3—
receptor. Found literature shows that those additional target receptors
could be considered for side effects of the anti—schizophrenia drug
clozapine.

3.8 Limitations

The presented approach has also some limitations. First, quality of
the data strongly depends of the quality of PubChem and UniProt
synonyms, which may vary with each update. However, even if
the main focus is not for text processing purposes, vocabulary
extension and curation for protein and compound synonyms is on—
going and vocabularies can be applied subsequently in proliﬁc,
further enhancing results. Second, the data in general only represents
co—occurrences of protein synonyms, compound synonyms and GO

substances. Thus, a subsequent curation of result data is necessary.
Furthermore, entities in the body of articles are not discovered, yet.

3.9 Future developments

Further developments include protein—protein relationships and the
processing of full articles which are freely available. Furthermore,
extensions are in preparation to provide tools for interactive curation,
graphical mapping of data to metabolic pathways and statistical
analyses. Future statistical analyses may also cover trends in
publications related to protein—compound relationships.

4 CONCLUSIONS

proliﬁc supports researchers looking for potential drug targets,
side effects and protein functions by providing a comprehensive
overview of proteins, homologues and compounds mentioned in
the same texts. Possibly, the combined use of other available
independent tools for protein—similarity searches, text—mining,
ﬁltering and co—occurrence detection could provide similar results.
However, this would mean researchers would have to transform data,
reapply several tools a number of times, and prepare visualizations
on their own. Those shortcomings are eliminated by proliﬁc with
a one—step solution and a comprehensive result overview, while
maintaining the advantages of well—deﬁned interfaces by supplying
a web service.

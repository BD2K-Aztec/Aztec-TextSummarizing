ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein—DNA interactions often take part in various crucial
processes, which are essential for cellular function. The identification
of DNA-binding sites in proteins is important for understanding the
molecular mechanisms of protein—DNA interaction. Thus, we have de-
veloped an improved method to predict DNA-binding sites by integrat-
ing structural alignment algorithm and support vector machine—based
methods.

Results: Evaluated on a new non-redundant protein set with 224
chains, the method has 80.7% sensitivity and 82.9% specificity in
the 5-fold cross-validation test. In addition, it predicts DNA-binding
sites with 85.1% sensitivity and 85.3% specificity when tested on a
dataset with 62 protein—DNA complexes. Compared with a recently
published method, BindN+, our method predicts DNA-binding sites
with a 7% better area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
value when tested on the same dataset. Many important problems in
cell biology require the dense non-linear interactions between func-
tional modules be considered. Thus, our prediction method will be
useful in detecting such complex interactions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—DNA interactions play essential roles in a variety of vital
biological processes, such as DNA replication, transcription,
packaging (Luscombe et al., 2000). For example, the interactions
between DNA and transcription factors are important for mod-
ulating the process of gene replication and transcription (Ptashne
et al., 2005). The interactions of DNA and histones are involved
in chromosome packaging in the cell nucleus (Kornberg, 1974).
Moreover, Bullock and Fersht (2001) have shown that mutations
of DNA-binding residues, such as those on the tumor repressor
protein P53, may predispose individuals to cancer. Thus, the
accurate identification of DNA-binding sites in proteins is not
only important for understanding the mechanisms of these bio-
logical processes but also helpful for annotating the function of

proteins. Protein—DNA interaction sites can be detected by using
biochemical techniques, such as DNase I foot-printing
(Brenowitz et al., 1986), Gel retardation (Lane et al., 1992) in
vivo foot-printing (Dumitru and McNeil, 1994) in vitro binding
assay (Diekmann and Hall, 1995) and methylation (Baldwin
et al., 2001). However, traditional biochemical methods are
time-consuming and laborious to carry out for the rapidly
increasing number of protein—DNA complexes. Therefore, de-
veloping an objective and effective computational approach to
precisely predict DNA-binding sites would be necessary.

Several computational methods have been developed to
identify DNA-binding sites in proteins based mainly on protein
sequence or protein structure. The sequence-based method can
be further divided into two classes. The first class is based on the
following: side chain pKa value, hydrophobicity indeX and
molecular mass of the amino acid residues and DNA-binding
residues predicted by support vector machine (SVM) Wang
and Brown, 2006; Wang et al., 2010) and random forests classi-
fier Wang et al., 2009). The second class uses evolutionary and
other sequence information to identify DNA-binding sites in
proteins (Ahmad and Sarai, 2005; Huang et al., 2009; Hwang
et al., 2007; Kuznetsov et al., 2006; Ofran et al., 2007;
Wu et al., 2009). Structure-based methods are further classiﬁed
into a structural alignment-based method and a structural
alignment-free method. For the structural alignment-based
method, the DNA-binding sites are recognized from a structural
alignment between the query sequence and a template known to
bind DNA (Gao and Skolnick, 2008; Holm and Sander, 1993).
In the structural alignment-free method, DNA-binding sites
are predicted using electrostatic potentials and the shape of
the molecular surface (Jones et al., 2003; Tsuchiya et al., 2004,
2005).

With the rapid increase in the number of high-quality protein
structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), developing new and
efficient techniques for predicting DNA-binding sites using geo-
metric structures has become feasible. In this article, we intro-
duce a two-stage machine-learning strategy to predict
DNA-binding sites. In the first stage, DNA-binding sites are
predicted by a structural alignment algorithm using the geomet-
ric structure. In the second stage, DNA-binding sites are pre-
dicted by SVM using evolutionary information, torsion angles
(go, my) present in the backbone structure and solvent accessibility.
The final results are obtained by a consensus of SVM predictions
and geometric structure-based predictions.

PreDNA: accurate prediction of DNA-binding sites in proteins

 

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Dataset preparation

In this study, two datasets, PDNA-62 and PDNA-224, were used to
evaluate the performance of our method. A summary of these datasets
are shown as follows:

PDNA-62: This is a non-redundant database of representative pro-
tein—DNA complexes from the PDB (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/), which
was constructed by Ahmad and Sarai (2005) and used by several other
studies (Kuznetsov et al., 2006; Wang and Brown, 2006; Wang et al.,
2009, 2010). The sequence identity in the dataset was 525% and the
resolution of the structures was 2.5 A or better. Based on the cutoff dis-
tance of 3.5 A, the PDNA-62 dataset contained 1215 DNA-binding resi-
dues and 6948 non-binding residues (Ahmad and Sarai, 2005; Ahmad
et al., 2004).

PDNA-224: In addition to the latest PDB (released by January 25,
2011), a new DNA-binding protein dataset was constructed from 978
protein—DNA complexes in this work. The 978 protein—DNA complexes
were determined by radio graphic crystallography with a resolution better
than 3.0 A. Redundancy among the amino acid sequences was removed
using the PISCES software (Wang and Dunbrack, 2003) with a threshold
of 25% set for sequence identity. Any proteins homologous to those in
the PDNA-62 were also removed by the PISCES software. Finally, 224
non-redundant protein chains containing 57 348 amino acids were ob-
tained. According to an identical criterion suggested in previous studies,
a residue is regarded as interacting with DNA if the distance between an
atom of the residue and an atom of base is <3.5A (Ahmad and Sarai,
2005; Ahmad et al., 2004). Using this criterion, 3778 interacting residues
and 53 570 non-interacting residues were projected to be present in the
PDNA-224 dataset. The PDNA-224 dataset and the binding sites infor-
mation are listed in the Supplementary Data S1.

2.2 Methods for prediction

Our method consisted of a SVM predictor and a geometric
structure-based predictor. For the SVM predictor, a SVM decision
value (sdv) for each site in a protein is obtained by SVM using the evo-
lutionary information, solvent accessible surface area and the protein
backbone structure (PBS). For the geometric structure-based predictor,
another geometric decision value (gdv) for each protein site is obtained by
the structural alignment method using the geometric structure informa-
tion. The ﬁnal result for each site is obtained by combining the two
decision values of SVM-based predictor and geometric structure-based
predictor. The whole prediction procedure is illustrated in Figure l.

2.3 SVM-based predictor

Owing to the fact that the DNA-binding site is determined not only by
the central residue, but also by other residues present in its neighboring
sites, a sliding window with K residues is selected to represent the infor-
mation of the central site. The information of each residue in the sliding
window is constructed using evolutionary information, the torsion angles
((p, w) in the PBS and the solvent accessible surface (Li and Li, 2012).
These features and the encoding scheme are described in Part 1 of the
Supplementary Data S2. Then, the encoded features are selected as the
input parameters of the SVM, which is a popular machine-learning ap-
proach mainly used in pattern recognition and orientation (Cai et al.,
2002, 2004; Kuznetsov et al., 2006; Shu et al., 2008). In this work, the
publicly available LibSVM software (version 3.0) was used (http://www.
csie.nut.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm) (Chang and Lin, 2011). The SVM outputs
(SVM decision value) have been converted into conditional probabilities
using a sigmoid function. The probability interpretation of sdv(x) is used
for evaluating the performance of the SVM predictor. The sigmoid func-
tion is deﬁned as follows:

P(Y = llx) = l/(l + exp(A X sdv(x) + B)) (l)

where x is the SVM input of each feature for position x, sdv(x) denotes
the decision value of the test feature for position x, P(Y: llx) is the
probability of DNA-binding prediction, and A and B are the slope and
offset, respectively, to be learned by a 3-fold cross-validation method
suggested in Platt (2000) (see Part 2 in Supplementary Data S2 for
more details) from the training set for the sigmoid function. Empirically,
one could use A = —2.0, B: —0.5 for DNA-binding prediction.

To combine linearly the scores of SVM predictions with the scores of
geometric structure-based predictions (see section 2.5 for more detail), we
converted conditional probabilities back to SVM decision value by,

56006) = {1n[(1 — P)/ P] — B}/A (2)

where sdv(x) is the decision value of the test feature for position x, P is the
conditional probability for DNA-binding and A and B are the same as
used in the sigmoid function. Equation (2) is an inverse of Equation (1).

2.4 Geometric structure-based predictors

Generally speaking, if a protein has a geometric structure similar to a
DNA-binding protein, the probability that this protein is also
DNA-binding protein is much higher. In our study, we use a structural
alignment method (see Section 2.5 for more details) to detect structural
similarities between a query protein and a template known to bind DNA.
The quality of the structural alignment method is determined by an inter-
face alignment score (IAS), which provides a quantitative measure of the
similarity between two protein—DNA complexes in the geometry.
Therefore, for a complex in the test set, a protein—DNA complex in the
training set with the highest IAS is kept, including the PDB code and the
DNA-binding information. This information is used to calculate the de-
cision values for all matched residues of the target chain according to the
following strategies: If the matched residue in the detected chain is a
DNA-binding site, a positive amino acid—amino acid similarity score is
assigned to the site in the target chain. On the other hand, if the matched
residue in the detected chain is a non-DNA—binding site, a zero score is
assigned to the site in the target chain.

2.5 Structural alignment method for detecting structural
similarity

Structural similarities between two protein—DNA complexes were calcu-
lated using the structural alignment method described in a previous study
(Siggers et al., 2005).

Step I .' Construct coordinate system

Based on this method, local coordinate systems are constructed on
both the amino acid residue and the nucleic acid (see Fig. 2A).

Fig. 2. Description of the geometric parameters used to compare two
amino acid—nucleotide pairs. (A) Orthonormal coordinate systems con;
structed on the amino acid backbone (i) and DNA base (m). The vector 0
connects the origin of the base system to the origin of the amino acid
system. The three coordinate vectors of the amino acid frame and the 0
vector are transformed into the base reference frame. These four vectors
describe the relative spatial orientation of the amino acid backbone with
respect to the base. (B) Geometric parameters Ad and Ad for (ic) and
(mn) amino acid—nucleotide pairs. Amino acid—nucleotide-pair geometric
relationships are described in the base reference frame. In the base refer-
ence frame, the radialAdisplacemeAnt Ad is the difference between the
magnitude; of the Oic and Om” vectors: Ad {(i,c)(m,n)} z abs
(llOicll — NOW”). The angle displacement Aa, which is analogous to an
arc length, is represented by the base of an isosceles triangle where the
shorter of the two 0 vectors determines the length of the two equivalent
sides. (C) Geometric parameter A6 for (ic) and (mn) amino acid—nucleo-
tide pairs. A6 (rotation angle) is the acute angle required to superimpose
the two transformed amino acid coordinate frame when their origins are
coincident

According to the local coordinate systems, the vector (O) connecting the
nucleotide—amino acid pair (base to amino acid) is determined as set out
in Figure 2A. The magnitude of the 0 vector for all nucleotide—amino
acid pairs is calculated in our datasets. As in the previoui study (Siggers
et al., 2005), a pair is regarded as ‘contacting’ if it had a 0 vector whose
magnitude was <16A. Therefore, this value is chosen as the distance
cutoff used to deﬁne an ‘interfacial’ amino acid—nucleotide pair when
determining amino acid—amino acid similarity scores.

Step 2: Calculating amino acid—nucleotide geometric similarity score

Based on the coordinate system, the indices i and c are introduced to
represent an amino acid and nucleotide subunit, and m and n for the
other, respectively. By comparing the geometric similarity between two
amino acid—nucleotide subunits ic and mn, the geometric parameters such
as the rotation angle and the distance displacement are obtained. The
rotation angle is in the form of A6 {(i,c)(m,n)}. The distance displacement
contains a radial displacement, Ad {(i,c)(m,n)}, and an angular dis-
placement, Aa {(i,c)(m,n)}. The geometric parameters are described in
Figure 2. Because the geometric parameters Ad {(i,c)(m,n)}, Aa
{(i,c)(m,n)} and A6 {(i,c)(m,n)} are discrete distributions, these param-
eters are transformed into corresponding geometric parameters
sd{(i,c)(m,n)}, s”{(i,c)(m,n)} and s9{(i,c)(m,n)} so that the transformed
geometric parameters are continuous distributions in the range of
~0—l. In this article, sd{(i,c)(m,n)}, s”{(i,c)(m,n)} and s9{(i,c)(m,n)} are
calculated by using the following logistic function:

shunnmhwmwiﬂ—AaMmewaﬂ—Aa» e)

S“{(i, 0X1”, 11)} = €Xp(A“(B“ — Aa))/ (1+ €Xp(A“(B“ — ACID) (4)

56W, C)(m, n)} = aim/19036 — M))/ (1+ €Xp(A9(BQ — A9») (5)

where A", B", A”, B”, A0 and B9 are the constant coefﬁcients, respectively,
to be obtained by the method suggested in Siggers et al. (2005) (see Part 3
in Supplementary Data S2 for more details). Therefore, the constant co-
efﬁcients used here are 25.0 (Ad) and 0.5 (Bd) for sd{(i,c)(m,n)}, 5.0 (A”)
and 2.6 (3”) for s”{(i,c)(m,n)} and 0.45 (A9) and 25.0 (B9) for
s9{(i,c)(m,n)}. The ﬁnal stage in this step is to calculate the amino acid—
nucleotide geometric similarity score; the amino acid—nucleotide geomet-
ric similarity score can be written in the form,

“gammy:ameemmnmuemmnmaemm» o)

where sd{(i,c)(m,n)}, s”{(i,c)(m,n)} and s9{(i,c)(m,n)} are the transformed
geometric parameters.

Step 3: Calculating amino acid—amino acid similarity score

The amino acid—amino acid similarity score S {i,m} is the average of
the geometric similarity scores for all successful matches,

 m} = :6," Ssuccessful{(i9 CXm»  

 

where N is the number of all successful matches.

Step 4: Calculating the Protein—DNA interface alignment score

Based on an amino acid—amino acid similarity matrix with elements S
{i,m}, the protein—DNA IAS is determined by summing the S {i,m} scores
over all aligned residues,

IAS = Z S{i, m} (8)

where S {i,m} is the amino acid—amino acid similarity score, and IAS is
the Protein—DNA IAS.

Therefore, for a test instance, a complex in the training set with the
highest IAS is kept, including the PDB code and the DNA-binding in-
formation. The amino acid—amino acid similarity score is used to calcu-
late the gdv for all matched residues of the test instance. However, there
are two important differences in the usefulness of the amino acid—amino
acid similarity score: (i) In our study, the amino acid—amino acid simi-
larity scores are converted into the average amino acid—amino acid simi-
larity score using the normalized function suggested in a previous study
(Chang and Lin, 2011) in order that the average amino acid—amino acid
similarity score remains the same as the decision value derived from SVM
predictions. (ii) Not all the amino acid—amino acid similarity scores are
used in our study. The amino acid—amino acid similarity scores in which
the matched residues in the detected chain are non-DNA—binding sites
are not included in this study. The remaining amino acid—amino acid
similarity scores are regarded as the gdv. The scheme is deﬁned as follows:

0 if the matched residue in the alignment chain
is a nonDNA — binding

S{x, m} if the matched residue in the alignment chain
is a DNA — binding

gdv(x, m) =

(9)

where S {x,m} is the average amino acid—amino acid similarity score for
position x and gdv(x,m) is the gdv for position x.

2.6 The combination of the decision values from the SVM
and geometry-based predictor

To predict the DNA-binding sites accurately, we used a novel scheme by
combining the SVM decision value with the gdv. The scheme is based on
the expected value in probability theory; suppose a random variable X
can take value x1 with probability p1, value x2 with probability p2, and so
on, up to value xk with probability pk. Then the expectation of this
random variable X is deﬁned as follows,

PreDNA: accurate prediction of DNA-binding sites in proteins

 

E(X) = X1191 + X2192 +  + kak (10)

wherep1+p2+...+pk= 1.

Therefore, in this section, the decision values from the SVM and the
geometry-based predictor are combined by a combination scheme as
follows:

c0m(x) = (1.0 —p) X sdv(x) +p X gdv(x) (x = 1, 2...L) (11)

where sdv(x) is the SVM decision value for the position x, gdv(x) is the
gdv for the position x, c0m(x) is the combined decision value for the
position x, L is the length of the protein sequence and p is the proportion
factor, p = 0.45 is used by learning the method from the training set (See
Part 4 in Supplementary Data S2 for more details).

Then, the c0m(x) elements are normalized to fall with the range of
O ~1 by the sigmoid function, which is analogous to equation (1) as
shown below,

pc0m(Y= 1|x)= 1/(1+ exp(A X c0m(x) + B)) (12)

where c0m(x) denotes the combined decision value for the position x,
pc0m(Y=1lx) is the probability interpretation of the c0m(x), and A
and B are the slope and offset, respectively. In this article, we use
A = —6.0, B: —0.2 for the ﬁnal prediction.

The ﬁnal prediction result is obtained using the probability interpret-
ation of the c0m(x). Given a protein sequence X with lresidues, we obtain
an l—dimensional feature vector [pc0m(l), pc0m(2),. . ., pc0m(l)]. Then, we
use a threshold 50 to integrate the vector into a non-linear discriminant
function. The threshold 50 gives the decision for sample X. As
pc0m(x)>.§0, the sample X is classiﬁed into the positive group, or into
the negative group as pc0m(x) 550. Empirically, one could use 50 = 0.52
for DNA-binding prediction (See Part 5 in Supplementary Data S2 for
more details).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In predicting DNA-binding sites, the 5-fold cross-validation test
is often used to examine the effectiveness of a predictor (\Nang
and Brown, 2006; Wang et al., 2009, 2010; Wu et al., 2009). The
performance of our predictor was also assessed by the 5-fold
cross-validation test. During this test, a dataset is randomly
divided into ﬁve non-overlapping sets, four of which are used
for training the predictor and the accuracy of the predictor is
assessed on the remaining sets. This process is repeated ﬁve
times. The predictive capability of our method was evaluated
by the sensitivity (Sn), speciﬁcity (Sp), Matthew’s correlation
coefﬁcient (MCC), overall prediction accuracy (Acc), strength
(Str) and false-positive rate (FPR):

Sn = TP/(TP + FN) (13)

Sp = TN/(TN + FP) (14)

Strength = (Sn + Sp) /2 (15)

FPR = FP/(TN+ FP) = 1 — Sp (16)

Acc = (TP + TN)/(TP + FP + TN+ FN) (17)

MCC: (TP x TN—FPXFN)/
\/(TP+FP) x (TN+FN) x (TP+FN) x (TN+FP)
(18)

 

where TP represents the number of correctly identiﬁed positives,
FN represents the number of the positives identiﬁed as negatives,
TN represents the number of the correctly identiﬁed negatives
and FP represents the number of negatives identiﬁed as positives.

To further evaluate the capability of using our method on an
unbalanced dataset, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve (Swets, 1988), one of the most robust approaches for clas-
siﬁer evaluation, was also used. It is obtained by plotting the
true-positive rate (sensitivity) on the y-axis against the FPR
(l-speciﬁcity) on the x—axis. The area under the ROC curve
(AUROC) (Bradley, 1997) can be used as a reliable measure
for the prediction performance. The maximum value of
AUROC (1) denotes a perfect prediction. A random guess re-
ceives an AUROC value close to 0.5.

3.1 Effect of the sliding window size in the construction of
the SVM input vectors

To obtain the best performance for predicting DNA-binding
sites, the sliding window size is optimized with respect to the
overall accuracy, MCC and Strength values. The optimized slid-
ing window size is obtained by testing the performance of differ-
ent sliding window sizes from 3 to 21 with the default parameters
c, g and weight in SVM. Table 1 shows the results of different
sliding window sizes on the dataset PDNA-62. It was found that
a sliding window of 11 amino acids achieves the best predicting
performance. Therefore, the optimized sliding window size was
set to 11 in this study.

3.2 The predicted results on the PDNA-62 dataset

Table 2 shows the predicted results for the PDNA-62 dataset
with various combinations of features. We show that the
lowest overall prediction accuracy is 62.6% when only using
the PBS as the input parameter. By using the PSSM proﬁles
as the input vector, the accuracy of the SVM classiﬁer is signiﬁ-
cantly improved up to 79.4%. However, the prediction perform-
ance slightly increases when the PSSM proﬁles were combined
with PBS or normalized solvent accessible surface area (NSASA)
are used as the input vectors. The best results (Acc of 83.6%,
MCC of 0.50 and Strength of 82.2%) were obtained when all the

features, including PSSM proﬁles, PBS and NSASA were com-
bined. Therefore, in our work, the SVM-based prediction model
was constructed by combining all the features. By integrating
SVM with geometric structure-based predictor, we obtained a
ﬁnal ROC curve for the ﬁnal prediction shown in Figure 3. It
is clear that the AUROC values in our predictions are ~5—10%
higher than those obtained in other studies. The best values for
Acc, MCC, strength and AUROC were 85.5%, 0.55, 85.3% and
0.926, respectively, in our study.

3.3 The predicted results on the new PDNA-224 dataset

To further evaluate the performance of our method in predicting
DNA-binding sites, we applied it to a new dataset PDNA-224
generated in this work. The test results of the SVM models using
various features are listed in Table 3. Our results show that the
prediction performance increases signiﬁcantly while using the
PSSM proﬁles as the parameter of the SVM model. When the
PSSM proﬁle was combined with one or more additional fea-
tures as input vectors, the performances were slightly improved.
The best performance was achieved with an MCC of 0.35, over-
all accuracy of 81.8% and strength of 79.2% (with a sensitivity of
76.1% and speciﬁcity of 82.2%) by combining the PSSM pro-
ﬁles, PBS and NSASA. In addition, the ROC curves of predict-
ing DNA-binding sites for the PDNA-224 dataset (Fig. 4) was
obtained by combining the SVM predictor using different par-
ameters with the geometric structure-based predictor. The
AUROC values show that the combined results are better than
the results of the SVM models using various features. The best
AUROC value was 0.898 in the 5-fold cross-validation test.

3.4 Comparison with other computational methods

DNA-binding sites have been predicted successfully using pre-
dictors, such as Dps-pred (Ahmad et al., 2004), Dbs-pssm
(Ahmad and Sarai, 2005), BindN (\Nang and Brown, 2006),
Dp-bind (Kuznetsov et al., 2006), DP-Bind (Hwang et al.,
2007), BindN-RF (\Nang et al., 2009) and BindN +(VVang
et al., 2010). When we compared our method with prior methods
using the common dataset, PDNA-62, we obtained the results
shown in Table 4. Overall, the best results of our prediction were
85.2% (85.2% sensitivity and 85.3% speciﬁcity). The results
show that our predictor has a considerably higher sensitivity of
85.2% compared with 40.3% from a previous study (Ahmad

has good generalization abilities in recognizing DNA-binding
sites.

3.5 False-positive sites predicted with high conﬁdence

To further illustrate the predictive capability of our predictor,
our results for the common PDNA-62 dataset were compared
with those of the PDB. The results show that 197 residues that do
not bind to DNA in the PDB annotation are predicted as
DNA-binding sites with >90% conﬁdence. However, based on
deep and comprehensive analyses, the 197 residues can be clas-
siﬁed into ﬁve groups. We used the pdb_id+chain_letter (e.g.
1B3TA) to name the protein chains.

In the ﬁrst group, we found 27 false-positive residues with
other related functions. Some of the residues are protein—protein
interaction sites (Ala46 in 1A02J, Gly82 in 1B3TA, Asp50 in
1CF7A, Gln18 in lFJLA, Glul28 in lGDTA, Lys22 in
1HWT D, G1n44 in 1HWTD, His 32 in lIHFB, Leu37 in
lIHFB, Cys93 in lMNMA, Val63 in lPYIA, Asnll7 in
lTSRA, Thr118 in lTSRA, Gln28 in lYRNA), while others
represent water-binding sites (Val99 in 1A02N, Gly158 in
lA74A, Thr9 in lBHMA, Ala40 in lCDWA, Trp65 in lFJLA,
G1u30 in 1HCQA, Met 42 in 1HCQA, Leu83 in lIGNA, G1u101
in lIGNA, Tyr57 in lPUEE, Thr30 in lTSRA). Moreover,
Ser49 in lDP7P is a ligand-binding site and Cysl25 in lA74A
is a Zn-binding site. Although these predicted residues are not
DNA-binding sites, they do interact functionally with other resi-
dues or small molecules. The results seem to indicate that our
method is helpful for predicting other functional sites.

The second group contains 21 false-positive residues. Our re-
sults show that these residues (Lys42, Phe63, Leu76, Asp77,
Lys102 and His113 in lUBDC) have higher amino acid—amino
acid similarity scores with actual DNA-binding residues based
on the structural alignment method. Because of structural re-
latedness to actual DNA binding residues, these false-positives
may indeed bind to DNA.

In the third group, seven sites (Gly158 in lGDTA, ArglO in
lPERL, T hr27 in lPERL, Lys23 in 1SRSA, Gly36 in 1SRSA,
Arg17 in 1YSAC and Ser19 in 1YSAC) are neither functional
nor geometrically similar. But the sequences of lGDTA, lPERL,
1SRSA, 1YSAC are exactly the same as lGDTB, lPERR,
1SRSB, 1YSAD. And Gly158 in lGDTB, Arg10 in lPERR,
Thr27 in lPERR, Lys23 in 1SRSB, Gly36 in 1SRSB, Argl7 in
1YSAD and Ser19 in 1YSAD have been veriﬁed in actual
DNA-binding experiments (Berman et al., 2000). Therefore,
the results show that our method can detect true DNA-binding
sites.

The fourth group has 110 mis-predicted residues that are
located in DNA-binding regions (DBRs). A DBR is an inde-
pendently folded protein region that contains at least one motif
that recognizes double— or single-stranded DNA. From the pre-
dicted results, it is obvious that some demonstrated binding re-
gions are in reasonable agreement with experimental data (see
Supplementary Data S3 for more details). For example, in
1A02F, we observe that Arg7, Asn10, Lysll, Ala13, Lys16,
Ser17, Arg18, Arg21 form a DBR. The results indicate that
our method predicts DNA-binding with greater accuracy and
will be of help to biologists.

Besides the four groups mentioned above, only 32 residues in
the ﬁfth group were incorrectly predicted by our method.

3.6 Effect of the beginning or the end of a-helices and
[l-strands

From an analysis on the false-negatives sites with <10%
conﬁdence level, we ﬁnd it difﬁcult to predict DNA-binding
sites when these sites are located in the beginning or the end
of a-helices and ,B-strands. For example, Lys17, Thr130 in
1B3TA are DNA-binding residues according to experimental
data. But these are mis-predicted in this article. From the spatial
structure of 1B3TA (Fig. 5), we ﬁnd Lysl7 is located in the
beginning of a-helices and Thrl30 is located in the end of
,B-strands. As alluded to earlier, residues of this nature are difﬁ-
cult to predict, as they occur in the beginning or end of a-helices
and ,B-strands that are usually distorted randomly (Zhou et al.,
2010).

4 CONCLUSIONS
The following conclusions can be drawn from this work:
(1) Based on SVM and geometric structure-based algorithms,

a novel computational method for predicting DNA-
binding sites in proteins is proposed in this work. Overall,

 

Fig. 5. The spatial structure of 1B3TA, Lys17 is located in the beginning
of a-helices, and Thr130 is located in the end of ,B-strands

method when applied to the common dataset PDNA-62
shows better predictive capability when compared with
other methods using the 5-fold cross-validation test.

(2) Our method performs equally well and can detect novel
DNA-binding proteins when tested on a new DNA-
binding protein dataset generated in this study.

(3) Our method has a better predictive value especially with
false-positive sites located in a DBR and can indeed show
that these residues have other functions unrelated to DNA
binding.

(4) From an analysis on the false-negatives sites with <10%
conﬁdence level, it is difﬁcult to predict some binding resi-
dues that are located in the beginning or end of a-helices
or ,B-strands.

Abstract

Motivation: Markov networks are undirected graphical models that are widely used to infer rela—
tions between genes from experimental data. Their state—of—the—art inference procedures assume
the data arise from a Gaussian distribution. High—throughput omics data, such as that from next
generation sequencing, often violates this assumption. Furthermore, when collected data arise
from multiple related but otherwise nonidentical distributions, their underlying networks are likely
to have common features. New principled statistical approaches are needed that can deal with dif—
ferent data distributions and jointly consider collections of datasets.

Results: We present FUSENET, a Markov network formulation that infers networks from a collection
of nonidentically distributed datasets. Our approach is computationally efficient and general: given
any number of distributions from an exponential family, FUSENET represents model parameters
through shared latent factors that define neighborhoods of network nodes. In a simulation study,
we demonstrate good predictive performance of FUSENET in comparison to several popular graph—
ical models. We show its effectiveness in an application to breast cancer RNA—sequencing and
somatic mutation data, a novel application of graphical models. Fusion of datasets offers substan—
tial gains relative to inference of separate networks for each dataset. Our results demonstrate that
network inference methods for non—Gaussian data can help in accurate modeling ofthe data gener—

1 Introduction

Undirected graphical models or Markov networks are a popular
class of statistical tools for probabilistic description of complex as—
sociations in high—dimensional data (cf. Rue and Held, 2005).
Biological processes in a cell involve complex interactions between
genes and it is important to understand, which genes conditionally
depend on each other. These dependencies can be inferred from the
experimental data and represented in a gene network. As a popular
approach to network modeling, Markov networks are particularly
appealing because they focus on finding such conditional depend—
ence relationships. Intuitively, the existence of a link between genes
A and B in a Markov network indicates that the behavior of gene A
is still predictive of gene B given all available measurements about
gene A and its immediate neighbors in a network. Hence, Markov
networks can help us to find a rich set of direct dependencies be—
tween genes that are stronger than gene correlations (Allen and Liu,
2013).

Markov networks have been well studied in bioinformatics and
numerous applications are concerned with inferring the network
structure primarily from microarray and next generation sequencing
gene expression data (Kotera et 61]., 2012; Gallopin et 61]., 2013;
Segal et 61]., 2003). They are complementary but not superior to
other gene network inference approaches (Marbach et 61]., 2012).
However, the increasing variety of data generating technologies and
heterogeneity of resulting data draw attention to two challenges in
the context of Markov network inference: inference from non-
Gaussian distributed data, and simultaneous inference from many
datasets.

In bioinformatics, many datasets are high dimensional, contain a
limited number of samples with a large number of zeros, and come
from skewed distributions. Most existing methods assume that data
follow a Gaussian distribution. While this assumption holds for
typical log ratio expression values from microarray data, it is vio—
lated for measurements obtained from sequencing technologies.

Gene network inference by fusing data from diverse distributions

For example, gene expression levels from RNA—sequencing count
how many times a transcript maps to a specific genomic location
(Wang et 61]., 2009) and as such these data are not Gaussian (Allen
and Liu, 2013). The Gaussian assumption is also violated for cat—
egorical datasets, such as data on mutation types and copy number
variation data (Hudson et 61]., 2010). While it would be possible to
design a network inference for each specific data type, we could
benefit from a procedure that can treat a wide class of distributions
and can jointly consider all available data during network inference
(Zitnik and Zupan, 2015).

We have developed a novel approach, called FUSENET, for infer-
ence of undirected networks from a number of high-dimensional
datasets (Fig. 1). Our approach builds upon recent theoretical results
about Markov networks (Yang et 61]., 2012, 2013) and, unlike the
previous works in Markov modeling, can be applied to settings
where data arise from multiple related but otherwise nonidentical
distributions. To achieve this level of modeling flexibility, we repre-
sent model parameters with latent factors. FUSENET implements data
fusion through sharing of latent factors that are common to all data—
sets and distributions, and handles data diversity through inference
of factors specific to a particular dataset.

In simulation studies, FUSENET recovers the true networks under—
lying the observed data more accurately than several alternative
approaches. The improved performance demonstrates that FUSENET
can find conditional dependencies between genes that could not be
reconstructed with Gaussian—based approaches. In a case study with

FUSENET'S input is a collection of datasets that can follow different exponential
family distributions. The example from the figure uses two datasets: (a) gene
expressions from next-generation sequencing follow the Poisson distribu-
tion, and (b) somatic mutation data follow the multinomial distribution. (c)
FUSENET infers a network by collectively modeling dependencies between any
two genes conditioned on the rest of the genes. The absence of an edge be-
tween sz and $3 (dotted line in grey) implies that $2 acts independently of $3
given 31 and $4, the neighbors of $2. The J_ symbol stands for conditional in-
dependence. Genes s1 and 32 are linked because data profiles of $2 in (a, b)
are still predictive of the profile values of $1 given 34, the neighbor of 32. (d)
Shown are FUSENET-inferred coefficients that relate $2 to all other genes.

breast cancer RNA—sequencing expression values and somatic muta—
tion data, we demonstrate the benefits of joint network inference
from multiple related datasets. The networks inferred collectively
from both types of data show greater functional enrichment than
networks learned from any data type alone.

2 Related work

The most straightforward approach to network inference is a simi-
larity—based approach, which assumes that functionally related genes
are likely to share high similarity with respect to a given dataset. A
well-known network obtained with this approach is the S. cerevisiae
genetic interaction network by Costanzo et al. (2010). Whenever the
similarity value between two genes is above a threshold they are
linked by an edge, which is referred to as a direct network inference
approach (Kotera et al., 2012). In contrast to direct network infer-
ence, model—based network inference via graphical models focuses
on local dependencies between genes, where each gene is directly af—
fected by a relatively small number of genes. Edges estimated by a
graphical model can be related to causal inference (Pearl and Verma,
1991)

The problem of learning a network structure associated with an
undirected graphical model has seen a wide range of applications
ranging from social networks and image and speech processing
(Metzler and Croft, 2005; Wang et al., 2013) to genomics.
Applications in bioinformatics include estimation of molecular path—
ways from protein interaction and gene expression data (Segal et 61].,
2003; Stingo and Vannucci, 2011), reconstruction of gene regula—
tory networks from microarray data (Marbach et 61]., 2012), infer—
ence of a cancer signaling network from proteomic data (Mukherjee
and Speed, 2008) and reconstruction of genetic interaction networks
from integrated experimental data (Isci et 61]., 2014). Methods
applied to these problems and many other recent gene network in-
ference algorithms (Anjum et 61]., 2009; Friedman et 61]., 2008;
Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2006; Ravikumar et 61]., 2010; Schafer
and Strimmer, 2005) estimate Gaussian or binary Markov networks,
i.e. they assume that data follow an approximately Gaussian
distribution.

Although non—Gaussian data are becoming increasingly common
in biology, until now, very few network inference algorithms have
been proposed for their treatment. When dealing with non—Gaussian
data, some authors simply use methods that are based on a Gaussian
assumption (Cai et 61]., 2012). We show in experiments that this de—
cision may result in poor predictive performance. Recently, various
extensions of Gaussian Markov networks have been proposed that
first Gaussianize the data, using for example a copula transform
(Liu et 61]., 2009, 2012; Murray et 61]., 2013) or a log transform, and
then apply algorithms that rely on an assumption of normality.
While these approaches perform better than na'ive application of
Gaussian—based methods to untransformed data, they are ill—suited
to data generated by next generation sequencing technologies (Allen
and Liu, 2013). A handful of recent algorithms (Allen and Liu,
2013; Gallopin et 61]., 2013) have considered Markov networks for
non—Gaussian data, using for example the Poisson distribution for
RNA—sequencing read counts. In contrast to our FUSENET, these meth—
ods cannot integrate datasets across different data types, thereby
limiting their ability to fuse information from many datasets.

Our work presented here is similar in spirit to our recently de—
veloped methodology for data fusion via collective matrix factoriza-
tion (Zitnik and Zupan, 2015). The methodology therein can jointly
model any number of datasets that can be represented with matrices.
Unlike existing data integration approaches, it does not require

transforming data into a common data space (e.g. a gene space). We
applied this methodology to mining disease—disease associations
(Zitnik et 61]., 2013), predicting drug toxicity (Zitnik and Zupan,
2014) and gene functions (Zitnik and Zupan, 2015) and observed
substantial gains in predictive accuracy. While both our work here
and in Zitnik and Zupan (2015 ) rely on latent factor models, they
are substantially different from one another. First, FUSENET builds on
the Markov network theory, whereas previously we considered ma—
trix decomposition. Second, FUSENET is a probabilistic model that ex—
plicitly considers various data distributions, and third, FUSENET is a
network inference approach, whereas our previous works focused
on matrix completion.

3 Methods

FUSENET takes as its input a collection of datasets where each dataset
consists of a set of gene profiles (Fig. 1). Gene profiles can be
heterogeneous and belong to different data types, e.g. data can be
continuous, discrete or categorical. For example, measurements
from RNA-sequencing represent the numbers of fragments that
were mapped to a specific genomic location (Wang et 61]., 2009).
The RNA—sequencing expression values are then non—negative and
integer valued and, hence, are not approximately Gaussian, but ra—
ther follow the Poisson or negative binomial distribution. This is in
contrast to copy number variation data and mutation data, i.e.
single—base substitutions, short indels, or multiple base substitutions,
that might be modeled better with multinomial or categorical distri—
butions. On the other end of spectrum are microarray gene expres—
sion data, which are approximately Gaussian distributed.

The crucial feature of FUSENET is the representation of model par—
ameters via latent factors. This feature, together with the sharing of
latent factors between datasets, allows us to infer a network by sim—
ultaneously considering many datasets that each can arise from a
different exponential family distribution (Section 3.7).

We exemplify FUSENET by deriving Markov network models for
two distributions from an exponential family, the Poisson distribu—
tion (Section 3.3) and the multinomial distribution (Section 3.5).
Since the exponential family includes not only Gaussian but also bi—
nomial, multinomial, Poisson, gamma distributions and others,
FUSENET can achieve great ﬂexibility in estimating gene networks
from diverse data (Section 3.6) and also comes with an efficient al—
gorithm for network structure estimation (Section 3.8).

Our work provides two novel contributions over current
approaches to gene network inference discussed in Related work:

° FUSENET simultaneously infers networks from datasets that may
be generated by nonidentical distributions, and

° FUSENET estimates large—scale genomic networks from increasingly
common non—Gaussian distributed data.

3.1 Preliminaries

3.1.1 Markov networks

A Markov network specifies conditional dependence relationships
between genes. In particular, if there is no edge between genes 5 and
t then this implies that the behavior of s is independent of t given the
set of immediate neighbors of s. From this local property (Murphy,
2012), one can easily see that two genes (nodes) are conditionally
independent given the rest of the genes iff there is no direct edge
between them. The conditional independence (Markov) properties
permit a rich set of dependencies among the nodes and hence, the
connectivity of a Markov network can reveal complex relationships
between its nodes (Allen and Liu, 2013; Jalali et 61]., 2011).

3. 1.2 Exponential family

The probability distributions that we study in this article are specific
examples of a broad class of distributions called the exponential
family (Duda and Hart, 1973). Members of the exponential family
have many important properties in common. Given parameters 0,
the exponential family of distributions over X is defined to be the set
of distributions of the form:

P(X) = exp(0B(X) + C(X) — D(0)), (1)

where B (X) are sufficient statistics, C(X) is a base measure and D(0)
is a log-normalization constant (Murphy, 2012). The exponential
family includes many widely used distributions, such as Bernoulli,
binomial, Poisson, gamma, multinomial and Gaussian distributions.

3.1.3 Parameterization of Markov networks

Let X : (X1,X2, . . . ,Xp) be a random vector with X,- being a ran—
dom variable. Suppose G = (V, E) is an undirected graph with
p nodes representing p variables in X, |V| : [9. Then the correspond—
ing undirected graphical model is any distribution defined on X that
satisfies Markov independence assumptions with respect to graph G
(Murphy, 2012). By the Hammersley-Clifford theorem (Murphy,
2012), any such distribution of X decomposes according to graph G
in the following way. Let C be a set of maximal cliques (fully con—
nected subgraphs) in graph G and let {¢C(XC), c E C} be “clique
potential” functions. By the Hammersley—Clifford theorem, any dis-
tribution of X within the graphical model family defined by G can
be represented as an exponential of a weighted sum of potential
functions over the maximal cliques C:

1’00 o< exp (2 Home»), (2)

cEC

where {05, c E C} are the weights of potential functions.

An important question is how one would select potential func—
tions {db 6 E C} to obtain various multivariate extensions of uni-
variate distributions. Recently, Yang et al. (2012) showed that if a
node—conditional univariate distribution, i.e. distribution of a ran—
dom variable conditioned on all other variables, belongs to an expo—
nential family, it necessarily follows that the joint distribution of X
has the form:

P(X) o<exp(ZesB(X.)+Z Z 6..B(X.)B(Xt)

sEV sEV tEN(s)
k
+ Z Z 05,t.,...,t.B(Xs)HB(Xt,) + Z C(Xs», <3)
sEV t2,...,tkEN(S) i=2 SEV

where the cliques are of size at most [3, N(5) are neighbors of node
5, B represent sufficient statistics and C is the base measure of the a
given exponential family distribution (cf. Proposition 1 and
Proposition 2 in Yang et al. (2012)). These results tell us that the
joint distribution specified in Eq. (3) has the most general form
under the assumption of exponential family node—conditional distri-
butions. Hence, learning a graphical model from the data can be
reduced to learning weights {0,} U {05,} U . . . U {057,327." 7,3,} of distri-
bution—specific sufficient statistics.

3.2 Problem definition

Suppose we are given a collection D of n observations,
D: {X(1),X(2), 
i.i.d. from a specific distribution of the form in Equation (3). This

graph G: (V,E*) on p nodes. Graph G encodes Markov

independence properties between the respective variables. The goal
of learning the structure of G is to infer an edge set E* that corre—
sponds to distribution, which generated observations in D. We can
express E* as a function of parameters {0; c E C} and write it as:

E*:{(s,t)E V>< V:3cliquecEC:{s,t}§c/\H: #0}.

Hence, learning the network structure reduces to the problem of
estimating weights {05, c E C} that should be as close as possible to
the true but otherwise unknown parameters {0; c E C}.

In this article, we focus largely on a special case of pairwise
Markov networks, where the joint distribution has cliques of size at

 

most two:

(4)

with entries 0:, 7E 0 if t E N(s) and 0:, = 0 if t E N Following
the work of Ravikumar et al. (2010), Jalali et al. (2011) and Allen
and Liu (2013), we approach the problem of Markov network struc—
ture learning via neighborhood estimation, where we obtain the
global network estimate E by stitching together the estimated neigh—
borhoods of the nodes. The overall network structure is then:

B 2 U {(570}: (5)

sEV,tEJ\7 (s)

where (s, t) denotes an edge between 5 and t and ANS) :
{t E V\{s} : 05,: 7E 0} is the estimated neighborhood of node 5.

In the remainder of this section, we formulate two pairwise
Markov networks, which assume either Poisson or multinomial data
distribution. These two exponential family models are taken as an
example through which we specify a general scheme for network
inference from multiple potentially nonidentical data distributions.

3.3 Poisson model specification

Following the work of Yang et al. (2012) and Allen and Liu (2013), we
define a Poisson Markov network model by specifying a distribution
where all node—conditional distributions follow a univariate Poisson dis—
tribution. Our Poisson Markov network model is then a series of locally
defined models, one for every variable (node). A local model for s is
given by a distribution of X5 conditioned on all other variables:

P(x,|xV\,)~ Poisson(exp{us—l— Z uSTWTWutXtD, (6)
tEV\{s}

where XV\S : {Xt|t E V\{s}} denotes the rest of the variables, and
u, E R’ and W E R7)" are model parameters. An r—dimensional vec—
tor us is a latent factor for node 5 that consists of r latent compo—
nents. For now, we assume that the number of latent components r
is given; we will later discuss how to automatically determine r.
Notice that the latent factor of node 5, us, represents the strength of
membership of node 5 to r latent components and W models the
interactions between all combinations of r latent components. The
formulation of the Poisson conditional distribution in Equation (6)
ensures that node pair—wise weights are symmetric, which is an
appealing property when studying undirected graphical models. In
particular, the contribution of X, towards P(XS|XV\S) is the same as
is the contribution of X5 towards P(Xt|XV\t).

We refer to our model as a model parameterized via latent facto—
rization, since model parameters us, 11, and W form a factorization
of the edge weight 05,, which is specified by a Markov network

model in Equation (4). The importance of latent factor parameter—
ization will be obvious later in Section 3.7 when we discuss collec—
tive network inference from many datasets.

Recall the univariate Poisson distribution is given by the mass
function P(X = x) = 2" exp (—2) /x!, where 2 is the shape parameter.
Our model extends the univariate Poisson in a natural and strict
sense to the multivariate graphical model setting. The latter can be
obtained from the univariate Poisson by setting the shape parameter
to 2 = exp (uS —l— Stews uSTWTWutXt). We then write the expression
in Equation (6) as:

P(x,|XV\,) :exp{uSXS—log(XS!)—l— Z (uSTWTWutXSXt
tEV\{s} (7)

—exp(uS + uSTWTWutXtD}

Intuitively, variable X, in Equation (7) can be viewed as the
response variable in a latent factor Poisson regression in which the
other variables XV\S play the role of the predictors. Variables with
strong relationships with gene s will have nonzero regression coeffi-
cients, and these will be connected to node 5 in the inferred graph.

3.4 Optimization of the Poisson model
The node—conditional distributions specified in Equation (7) define
a global distribution that factors according to the cliques of the
underlying graph G that we would like to estimate. We obtain
edge set E by stitching node neighborhoods as prescribed by
Equation (5), where we define the neighborhood of node 5 as
A715) 2 {t E V\{s} : uSTWTWut 7E 0}. This means that edge (5, t) is
included in the network if the estimated product of respective latent
factors of variables X, and X, is nonzero.

To estimate edge set E, we have to determine the node neighbor—
hoods of all nodes in V. To achieve this goal, we solve a sparsity
constrained conditional maximum likelihood estimation problem:

13%; EMU, W; D) + oc(Reg(U) + Reg(W)). (8)

’ sEV

Here, U is a matrix with node latent factors placed in the col—
umns,U = [u1,u2,  ,un].

Equation (8) consists of two parts, which we discuss next. Terms
involving Reg represent the elastic net penalties (Zou and Hastie,
2005). The penalty is defined for U as Reg(U) : (1 — 2)%|IUII§71—l—
2||U||171, where 220 is a regularization parameter controlling the
amount of sparsity in the node neighborhood. The definition of the
penalty term for W is analogous. Notice that the L271 norm is the
sum of 2—norms of the columns, ||U||271 : 5:1 ||us||§, and the L171
norm is the sum of 1—norms of the columns, ||U||171 : 2:721 ||us||1.
Since latent factors are affected by the strength of regularization, the
choice of parameter 2 is important. Procedure for selection of 2 is
described in Supplementary Section 1.

The crucial part of Equation (8) is, however, the sum of the
node—wise Poisson likelihood functions. Given node 5 and n realiza—
tions of the associated random variable XS, the Poisson likelihood
function E, follows directly from Equation (7) and can be written as:

1 n . .

unknowns. Notice that node—wise terms are ignored here for
simplicity.

3.5 Multinomial model specification and optimization
We now develop a multinomial Markov network model that relies on
latent factor parameterization of the model parameters and follows
the same paradigm as our Poisson model described in the previous sec—
tion. The multinomial model presented here is a natural extension of
the multinomial graphical model described by Jalali et al. (201 1).

We start with the neighborhood recovery of one fixed node 5 and
then combine the neighborhood sets across nodes to estimate the
network. The multinomial model assumes that each variable X,-
from a random vector X follows a multinomial distribution with
potentially different parameters. This means that X,- can take any
value from a small discrete set {1,2, . . . ,m} of cardinality m.
Probabilities of different values are not independent so that, given
any m — 1 of the probabilities, the probability of the remaining value
is fixed. It is convenient to express the distribution in terms of only
m — 1 values, thereby leaving m — 1 probability parameters that need
to be estimated.

The distribution of X5 conditioned on other variables XV\S :
{X, : t E V\{s}} is given by:

exp(95,-+ Z Zest;jkI/e(Xt))

 

. V\{s} k
P(X. = IIXVo = E (10)
1 + ZCXP (951 + Z Z 65t;lka(Xt))
l tEV\{s} k
for all j E {1,2,  m — 1}. Here, 05,- represents a node—wise term

that models the probability of variable X, taking value 1'. The other
model parameter is (ism-k, which models dependency between varia—
ble X5 and variable X, when they take values j and 12, respectively.
We can view Equation (10) as a multiclass logistic (softmax) regres—
sion, where X, is the response variable and indicator functions asso—
ciated with other variables:

{1,(x,),t e V\{s},/e 6 {1,2,  ,m — 1}},

where Ik(X,) : 1 if X, = 12 else 0, are the predictors.

We now proceed by writing model parameters 05,- and 05,”), in the
form of a product of latent factors. We gather node—wise terms 05,-

way as is described in Section 3.3.
To estimate the latent factors and node—wise terms from the data
we solve the following convex optimization program:

where definitions of U, W and Reg are the same is in the previous
section. Here, the node—wise multinomial likelihood function E, for

where X?) E {1,2, . . . ,m — 1} is the i-th realization of X5 in data D,

 denotes the i—th realization of the rest of the variables XV\S, and

U, Q and W are matrix unknowns. Given latent factor estimates U
and W, and the estimate of node—wise terms Q, we determine
the neighborhood for node 5 as A715) : {t E V\{s} :
ZuSTQSiWTWQ,ku, 7E 0}. This means that edge (5, t) is included in
011% network if product uSTQSI-WTWQ,ku, does not vanish over at
least one choice of categories j and k.

3.6 Other exponential family distributions

So far, we described in Section 3.3—3.5, the Poisson model and the
multinomial model that are suitable for separately inferring the edge
set of a Poisson or a multinomial Markov network. In this section,
we would like to allude to the fact that a procedure with derivations
very similar to those in the above sections can be applied to any
exponential family distribution.

From Equation (1), we see that the unnormalized probability of
an exponential family distribution can be expressed as an exponen—
tial of a weighted linear combination of sufficient statistics. These
sufficient statistics correspond to clique potential functions (see Sec.
3.1.3). Under the assumption of joint distribution having cliques of
size at most two, node—conditional distributions take the form:

P(XS|XV\S) oc exp(05B(XS) —I— Z HS,B(XS)B(X,) —l— C(XS»
tEN(s)

where {05, s E V} and {093, s, t E V} are parameters that shall be esti—
mated from the data.

FUSENET yields a general framework for including data from any
exponential family distribution, such as Gaussian, binomial, Poisson
or multinomial distributions, in its predictive model by simply
expressing weights {05, s E V} and {093, s, t E V} of a given distribu—
tion as products of appropriately selected latent factors. Here, facto—
rization of the weights is appropriate if it allows fusion of data from
diverse distributions, such that factorization consists of both latent
factors that are shared between different distributions and factors
that are specific to a particular distribution (Zitnik and Zupan,
2015 ), a property that we describe in the following section.

3.7 Collective inference of a gene network
We proceed by formulating a collective network inference model,
wherein a network is jointly estimated from multiple nonidentical
data distributions.

Let 1),, : {X(1),X(2), 
a random vector X, where each p—dimensional vector X“) is

,X(”x)} be a set of 11,, observations of

drawn from a distribution Px of the form of Equation (4) and let
Dy = {341),be 
p—dimensional vector ya) is drawn from distribution P, of the form

,y(”y)} be a set of n, observations where each

of Equation (4). Importantly, distributions Px and P, are not necessarily
identical in terms of their parameters or distribution type. For example,
Px might denote the Poisson distribution and P, might be the multino—
mial distribution or they could both describe multinomial distributions
that have different parameters. For simplicity of notation we provide
here the formulation for the case with only two datasets, Dx and Dy,
but notice that our analysis generalizes to any number of datasets.
In collective network inference, we solve for:

butions. In a specific scenario in which Px and P, are the Poisson
and the multinomial distributions, respectively, we set Qx : I.

We specify the regularization according to the Poisson model in
Equation (8) and the multinomial model in Equation (11) as:

2(Reg (U) + Reg(Wx) + Reg(Qy) + RegWVyD,

where Reg is the elastic net penalty defined in Section 3.3. The esti—
mated neighborhood of node s, which corresponds to a random vari—
able X, E X, are then nodes whose behavior depends on behavior of
s according to any of considered data distributions,
JV 2 {t E V\{s} : 05,3129, 74 0V0,,;py 74 0}. In our specific scenario,
parameters 05,3129, and 05,313 would be given by 05,312), : uSTWTWu,
and 325,12, 2 2,7, 113 Q,,WTWQ,,u,.

It is important to notice the coupling of the parameters in
FUSENET through which data fusion is achieved (Zitnik and Zupan,
2015 ). As is evident from Equation (13), the latent factor of node s,
u,, participates both in terms associated with Px and terms related to
Py. Hence, a good estimate of u, should simultaneously minimize
both £5,129, and 25,13, but should do so in a way that statistics internal
to both data distributions are considered. To account for the fact
that datasets may disagree and differ in how accurately they capture
biological signals, FUSENET has parameters that are specific to every
distribution. In particular, we allow that interactions between latent
components in 13,, are different from those in D, and hence, the
model has one latent matrix W for each distribution. An additional
parameter Q captures the characteristics of a particular exponential
family distribution, e.g., the bias associated with m categories in the
multinomial distribution.

3.8 Learning the models in practice

Now that we defined the FUSENET model, we explain how to solve
related optimization problems. Notice that the exact optimization
problem one needs to solve depends on a particular data setting, i.e.
a particular combination of considered exponential family
distributions.

There has been a strong line of work on developing fast algo—
rithms to solve sparse regression problems that are similar to
Equations (8) and (11) including the work by Krishnapuram et al.
(2005), Meier et al. (2008), Jalali et al. (2011) and Allen and Liu
(2013). Existing algorithms for undirected graphical model selection
assume that model parameters are independent of each other. This,
however, is not true in FUSENET due to reasons discussed in Section
3.7 that are important to achieve data fusion. Consequently, this
also means that we cannot use off—the—shelf optimization solvers.

We propose to fit our FUSENET by computing cyclical coordinate
descent along the path of regularization parameter 2 (see
Supplementary Section 1). Parameters of FUSENET inference algo-
rithm, i.e. regularization and latent dimensionality, are selected in
data—dependent way via stability selection. Interested reader is
referred to Supplementary Section 1.

4 Experimental setup

We compare the performance of FUSENET to several state—of—the—art
Markov network models in estimating the true underlying network
structure.

4.1 Performance evaluation

The success of network recovery is evaluated by comparison to the
gold standard networks, when they are available, and by functional
enrichment of the inferred networks.

4.1.1 Assessing the accuracy of network recovery

Simulated data come with complete and unambiguous true underly—
ing networks, hence we can assess the performance of the algorithms
as follows. We report receiver operator curves (ROC) computed by
varying the regularization parameter 2, precision recall (PR) curves,
and true and false positive rates for fixed 2 as estimated via stability
selection. The true positive rate is estimated as proportion of
the edges found by a network inference algorithm that are also in
the true network. The false positive rate represents proportion of the
edges in the inferred network that are not present in the true net—
work. An algorithm with a perfect performance achieves an area
under the ROC curve of 1, precision of 1 and recall of 1, a true posi—
tive rate of 1 and a false positive rate of 0.

4.1.2 Quantifying the functional content of inferred networks

We employ two approaches to evaluate the ‘functional correctness’
of the networks inferred from cancer data. First, we use SANTA
(Cornish and Markowetz, 2014) to quantify the strength of associa—
tion between sets of functionally related genes from the Gene
Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000) and the inferred network.
Second, we overlay the inferred network with gene information
from the GO and for every GO term assess how community—like a
subnetwork of genes that belong to a particular GO term is.
Communities are sets of genes with many connections between the
members and few connections to the rest of the network. Four dif—
ferent structural notions of network communities exist in networks
and we report the values of their representative scoring functions
(Yang and Leskovec, 2012). We refer the reader to Supplementary
Section 4 for mathematical details.

4.2 Considered gene network inference algorithms

In the experiments, we consider the Poisson FUSENET (Section 3.3),
the multinomial FUSENET (Section 3.5) and FUSENET with fusion of
Poisson and multinomial data distributions (Section 3.7). We com—
pare our models to the Graphical Lasso (GLASSO) (Friedman et al.,
2007), which is a widely used Markov network model based on a
Gaussian assumption. To see how FUSENET relates to techniques that
perform data preprocessing, we consider the GLASSO after applying
a log transform to the data plus one (e.g. cf. Gallopin et al., 2013)
and the GLASSO with the nonparanormal Gaussian copula trans—
formation (NPN—Copula) (Liu et al., 2009). We also compare
FUSENET with two Markov network models that are designed for
non—Gaussian distributed data: the Local Poisson Graphical Model
(LPGM) (Allen and Liu, 2013), and the Multinomial Markov
Network Model (Mult—GM) (Jalali et al., 2011). The crucial param-
eter of these methods is degree of regularization, which controls
sparsity of the networks. We select the value for regularization via
stability selection (see Supplementary Section 1).

5 Data

Network inference algorithms are evaluated based on simulated
data and large—scale cancer genomic datasets.

5.1 Multivariate data simulation

Four network structures are simulated: (i) the Erdos Rényi random
network, where an edge between each pair of nodes is set with equal
probability and independently of other edges; (ii) a hub network,
where each node is connected to one of three hub nodes; (iii) a scale—
free network, in which node degree distribution follows a power—
law; and (iv) a small—world network, in which most nodes are not

neighbors of each other but most nodes can be reached from every
other by a small number of hops. We refer the reader to
Supplementary Section 2 for detailed description of the procedures
used for data simulation.

5.2 Cancer genomic data

We apply network inference algorithms to two examples of non—
Gaussian high—throughput genomic data to learn (i) an mRNA
expression network, (ii) a somatic mutation network and (iii) a col—
lectively inferred gene network based on both data types.

We download breast cancer (BRCA—US) gene expression data
measured by next generation sequencing and breast cancer (BRCA—
US) simple somatic mutation data from the International Cancer
Genome Consortium (ICGC) (Hudson et al., 2010) portal (release
17). We follow the steps in Allen and Liu (2013) and process RNA—
sequencing data to be approximately Poisson. Data preprocessing,
whose detailed steps are described in Supplementary Section 3,
results in a matrix with rows as the subjects (nexp : 1, 012) and col—
umns as genes (pexp : 657). These genes form the nodes of our
Poisson breast cancer mRNA network.

Breast cancer simple somatic mutation data include single base
substitutions, multiple base substitutions and short indels. Mutation
data are converted into a matrix with rows as subjects (nmut : 954)
and columns as genes containing mutations or variations (500
genes). Each matrix entry is categorized into one of three groups
based on the type of mutation: no mutation, single base substitution,
insertion/deletion of < 200 base pairs.

For the collectively inferred network, we consider both gene
expression profiles and somatic mutation data provided by the
ICGC assuming the Poisson model for the RNA—seq data and the
multinomial model for the mutation data. We refer the reader to
Supplementary Section 3 for more details.

6 Results and discussion

6.1 Network recovery with simulated data
In every simulation, we generated a dataset of observations based on
a simulated network and then applied different network inference
algorithms to determine whether the algorithms successfully recov—
ered complex relationships between data variables.

We simulated four network types, which are known to resemble
the structure of real biological networks (Allen and Liu, 2013;
Costanzo et al., 2010). We report receiver operator curves computed
by varying the regularization parameter 2 in Figure 3 and
Supplementary Figure S4, boxplots of true and false positive rates
for fixed 2 as determined by stability selection in Figure 3,
Supplementary Figures S2 and S4. Further, we evaluated precision
and recall of the networks estimated from different data distribu—
tions in Supplementary Figures S2—S5.

Experimental evidence indicates that FUSENET outperforms
Gaussian—based competitors (GLASSO, Log—GLASSO and NPN—
Copula) as well as existing methods that are designed specifically for
the Poisson and the multinomial data (LPGM in Fig. 2 and Mult—
GM in Fig. 3). The overall good performance of FUSENET is consistent
across the four types of network structure and the two data distribu—
tions that we considered in experiments.

The improved statistical power of FUSENET and LPGM over meth—
ods that during network inference rely heavily on the assumption of
normality is particularly impressive. Results in Figure 3 suggest that
in situations where this assumption is not satisfied, we can expect
reduced prediction performance if we naively apply Gaussian—based

Fig. 2. Application of gene network inference algorithms to multinomial-
distributed simulated data. Simulation studies on four network types were
performed: random (see Supplementary Fig. 82), hub, scale-free and small
world. For each graph type, we generated n=300 observations at a high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with P: 50 variables (nodes) taking values from
an alphabet of size m=3. Boxplots are shown for multinomial FUSENET (pro-
posed here) and the multinomial graphical model (Mult-GM) (Jalali et al.,

methods, (GLASSO) or if we perform insufficient data preprocessing
(Log—GLASSO). However, we note that sophisticated techniques
that replace Gaussian distributed data by the transformed data
obtained, e.g. through a semiparametric Gaussian copula (NPN—
Copula; Liu et al. (2009)), can give substantial gains in accuracy
over the naive analysis. These observations are not surprising as dis—
regarding information about data distribution can adversely affect
performance of prediction models. Our results demonstrate that
employing the ‘correct’ statistical model, in this case FUSENET or
LPGM, can lead to more accurate network inference.

Next, we try to understand which algorithmic component of
FUSENET contributes most to its good performance relative to existing
algorithms for network structure learning. The primary difference
between FUSENET and non—Gaussian—based methods considered here,
LPGM and Mult—GM, is representation of model parameters with
products of latent factors. In LPGM and similarly in Mult-GM, a
prediction model is fitted locally by an algorithm, which performs a
series of independent penalized regressions. This is in contrast with
FUSENET, where different model parameters are not entirely independ—
ent of each other but rather rely on borrowing strength from each
other via factorization. Our results on simulated data suggest that
representation of model parameters through the use of latent factors
is beneficial. Furthermore, latent parameterization can improve per—
formance of network recovery beyond what is possible with models
that do not use latent factors. On the downside, we note that due to
coupling of model parameters, FUSENET is not trivially parallelizable,
which is otherwise true for LPGM and Mult—GM.

Results shown in Figures 2 and 3 are reported for datasets with a
few hundred observations (11) and a few tens of variables (p; see fig—
ure captions). We note that reported results are consistent with
experiments done in various high—dimensional scenarios even when
the number of variables is greater than the number of observations
(p > 11). Results therein reveal the same trend, namely, the overall
strong performance of FUSENET in recovering true networks from
non—Gaussian data.

6.2 Functional content of genomic networks

An important challenge in cancer systems biology is to uncover com—
plex dependencies between genes implicated in cancer. Since our
knowledge about genome—scale gene networks is incomplete and
only a few functional modules are known for higher organisms
(Rolland et al., 2014), our aim is to quantify associations between

Fig. 4. The strength of association between gene sets from the Gene
Ontology (GO) and networks inferred with FUSENET. Inferred networks were
overlaid with G0 terms and subnetworks induced by each GO term were
assessed for how well they corresponded to network communities. Four dif-
ferent scoring functions were used to quantify the presence of different struc-
tural notions of communities (Supplementary Section S4) that can appear in
biological networks: flake-over-median-degree (flake-ODF), cut ratio, triangle
participation ratio (TPR) and conductance. Considering breast cancer RNA-
sequencing (RNA-seq) and somatic mutation data (Mut), these boxplots show
the gains that fusion of data from different distributions (Mut & RNA-seq) can
offer over network inference from any dataset alone, either RNA-seq or Mut.
Poisson FUSENET was used with RNA-sequencing data, multinomial FUSENET
with somatic mutation data and fully-specified FUSENET for joint consideration
of RNA-sequencing and mutation data

the inferred gene networks and known cellular functions and pheno—
types, and to assess the significance of these associations.

6.2.1 Comparison of FUSENET variants with existing methods

To characterize how functionally informative the inferred networks
are, we employ four structural definitions of network communities
(Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs S6 and S7). These represent four pos—
sible notions of association between a given GO term and the
inferred network (Yang and Leskovec, 2012). The triangle participa—
tion ratio quantifies how well genes that are members of a given GO

term are linked to each other in the inferred network. The cut ratio
captures the abundance of external connectivity, i.e. edges between
genes of a GO term and the rest of the network, whereas conduc—
tance and flake—ODF consider both internal and external network
connectivity. Through these four measures we are able to estimate
the overall concordance of inferred gene networks and known func-
tional annotation of genes. For these reasons, networks that score
higher on many measures should be considered more informative
across a wider spectrum of cellular functions.

Figure 4 shows that gene network inferred by FUSENET through
fusion of breast cancer RNA—sequencing data and somatic mutation
data is more concordant with functional annotation data in the GO
than are networks inferred by FUSENET from either RNA-sequencing
or somatic mutation data alone. We note that we used Poisson
FUSENET to infer network from RNA-sequencing data, multinomial
FUSENET to infer network from somatic mutation data and collective
FUSENET for joint network inference from RNA—sequencing and
mutation data. These results demonstrate that combining data
through the use of latent factors can perform better than independ—
ent modeling of each dataset alone.

For each of the four community scoring measures in Figure 4, we
compared score distributions of GO terms across three networks
inferred by FUSENET using Kolmogorov—Smirnov tests. We concluded
that the network inferred by FUSENET through fusion of RNA-
sequencing and mutation data associates with GO significantly
more strongly than the other two networks (P value < 1 x 10—5 on
all four measures from Fig. 4). This experiment shows how cancer
genomic data provide different levels of information about cellular
machinery, highlighting that it is possible to infer a network that
better explains the mechanisms of cancer by combining multiple
datasets in a principled statistical way.

We further compared FUSENET to existing network inference
methods on cancer data. The comparison was made only with
LPGM, as this was the best performing method in our study on
simulated data (Section 6.1) and in the cancer—data study of Allen
and Liu (2013). Supplementary Figure S6 shows the functional con—
tent of the networks inferred from RNA—sequencing data by either
Poisson FUSENET or LPGM. On a related note, Supplementary Figure S7

shows enrichment of the networks inferred from somatic mutation
data by either multinomial FUSENET or Mult—GM. Notice that LPGM
and Mult—GM were designed for data that are approximately
Poisson distributed, such as measurements from RNA—sequencing,
and multinomially distributed, such as various types of gene varia—
tions, respectively. These results demonstrate that networks inferred
by FUSENET can better capture known GO annotations than networks
obtained by methods such as LPGM and Mult—GM, whose predic—
tion models do not have factorized representation. These observa—
tions are consistent across four complementary structural definitions
of GO terms, where every GO term is viewed as a network commun—
ity defined by its member genes.

6.2.2 Networks via breast cancer data

We employ SANTA (Cornish and Markowetz, 2014) to quantify the
functional content of gene networks. SANTA extends the concept of
gene set enrichment analysis to networks. We observed that GO
terms indeed cluster more strongly on Poisson FUSENET’s
networks than on networks inferred by GLASSO and Log—GLASSO
(P value < 1 X 10—6, RNA—seq network), NPN—Copula
(P value < 1 x 10—5, RNA—seq network) and LPGM (P value <
1 x 10—4, RNA—seq network). These results suggest that network
edges inferred by FUSENET might represent more accurate indication
of shared cellular functions than edges inferred by other considered
methods. This effect was independent of the GO term size and was
strongest for specific cellular functions such as ‘centrosome cycle’
(P value< 1 X 10—9), ‘cellular response to DNA damage stimulus’
(P value < 1 X 10—9), ‘apoptotic process’ (P value < 1 x 10—9) and
‘regulation of cytokinesis’ (P value < 1 X 10—8). We observed similar
results when inferring networks from somatic mutation data. Gene
network inferred by multinomial FUSENET was functionally richer
than network inferred by Mult—GM. Here, the functional content of
a network was quantified with SANTA as proportion of evaluated
GO terms whose association strength with the network had
P value < 1 x 10—5.

Interactions that are captured by fusing both cancer related data—
sets recovered many gene—gene associations that have been previ—
ously linked to increased breast cancer predisposition and
metastasis. For example, FUSENET revealed a hypothesized transcrip-
tional regulatory GATA3 module (Wang et al., 2014) consisting of
fully connected GATA3, PTCH1, NFIB and PPARA. GATA3 is an
important transcriptional regulator in breast cancer (Theodorou
et al., 2013), and low expression levels of GATA3 are associated
with a poor prognosis (Albergaria et al., 2009). It has been shown
by Wang et al. (2014) that PTCH 1, PPARA and NFIB exhibit epis-
tatic interactions with GATA3, have negatively correlated expres—
sion levels with GATA3 and that GATA3 binds to gene regions near
NFIB, PTCH1 and PPARA in breast epithelial tumor cell line.

Other interactions identified in our network include ATM and
BRCA1, ATM and BRCA2, and CHEKZ and BRCA2, which are
known gene—gene interactions whose mutations affect breast cancer
susceptibility (Turnbull et al., 2012).

Another transcriptional module that was found by FUSENET con—
sists of FLI 1, ]AK2 and CCNDZ. This module has been only
recently associated with breast cancer patient outcome (Wang et al.,
2014). Interestingly, FLII module has been captured by FUSENET
when fusing RNA—sequencing and mutation data but has been
missed when using FUSENET with any of the two cancer datasets in
isolation, as well as by any other inference algorithm considered in
this study. One possible explanation for the latter result might be
observations made by Wang et al. (2014). Wang et al. examined

The Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer patient survival data and
found that low expression or mutation in one or more members of
the FLII module is associated with reduced overall survival time in
all patients. The illustrative example of FLII module highlights an
advantage of FUSENET over methods considering a single dataset dur—
ing network inference.

7 Conclusion

FUSENET is an approach for automatic inference of gene networks
from data arising from potentially many nonidentical distributions.
It is based on the theory of Markov networks, where the inferred
network edges denote a type of direct dependence that is stronger
than merely correlated measurements. An appealing property of
FUSENET is its ability to estimate network edges by fusing potentially
many datasets. In the case studies, FUSENET’s models outperform sev—
eral state—of—the—art undirected graphical models. We show that
FUSENET’s high performance is attributed to the ability to model non—
Gaussian distributions and fusion of data through sharing of latent
representations. Our work here has broadened the class of off—the—
shelf network inference algorithms for simultaneously considering a
wide range of parametric distributions and has combined Markov
network inference with data fusion.

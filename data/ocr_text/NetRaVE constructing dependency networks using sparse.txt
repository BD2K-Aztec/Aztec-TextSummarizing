ABSTRACT

Summary: NetRaVE is a small suite of R functions for generating
dependency networks using sparse regression methods. Such
networks provide an alternative to interpreting ‘top n lists’ of genes
arising out of an analysis of microarray data, and they provide a
means of organizing and visualizing the resulting information in a
manner that may suggest relationships between genes.
Availability: NetRaVE is freely available for academic use and has
been tested in R 2.10.1 under Windows XP, Linux and Mac OS X.

1 INTRODUCTION

The advent of microarray technology has spawned a plethora of
statistical and machine learning methods to analyze the resulting
expression data. Their ultimate aim is to guide the researcher to some
understanding of how the observed patterns of gene expression are
related to the phenotype being studied and to suggest hypotheses
that merit further exploration.

In this note, we outline NetRaVE, a two-step approach
to analyzing microarray data that combines a fast, sparse
variable selection method, known as GeneRaVE (Kiiveri, 2008),
with dependency networks, an alternative to Bayesian networks
developed by Heckerman et al. (2000). NetRaVE is a descriptive
tool, whose use is facilitated by a small suite of R (R Development
Core Team, 2008) functions that interface with the existing libraries
to Visualize the resulting networks. Its output is a local dependency
network that encapsulates the results of the data analysis in a
form that is easy to Visualize and provides users with additional
information about local relationships between gene transcripts.
These local relationships can then be used to generate hypotheses
that can lead to further experimentation.

2 APPROACH

The basic procedure for generating local dependency networks is
straightforward and consists of two steps. First, we use GeneRaVE
to select genes that ‘best’ discriminate between subtypes present in

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

the data. In the example described below, discrimination is between
two groups of individuals—smokers and never smokers—and we
identify a small subset of genes that discriminates between these two
groups by using the sparse logistic regression. Second, we use these
genes as ‘seed’ genes for building the local dependency networks.
To do so, the individual seed genes become the response variables
in separate sparse linear regressions in which all other genes are
potential explanatory variables. Again we use GeneRaVE, so that
the resulting regression model is sparse and contains only a few
other explanatory genes. After this ﬁrst round of regressions, the
network is deﬁned by edges between the response (seed) genes and
their selected regressor (explanatory or predictor) genes.

To expand the network beyond the ﬁrst round, we simply use
the explanatory genes from the ﬁrst round as response variables in
regressions using all other genes as potential regressors. Though it
is possible to repeat this procedure several times, the resulting large
network will be difﬁcult to Visualize and interpret. In practice, it is
more useful to construct only local networks, which are typically
obtained after two or three rounds. Note that dependency networks
can be constructed around any genes of interest within a dataset.
Furthermore, the R function in NetRaVE that is used for constructing
networks is written so that the user can easily write his/her own
method for generating conditional probability distributions using
alternative regression methods. Further details about NetRaVE and
dependency networks appear in the Supplementary Material, along
with a larger version of Figure 1 and the R script used to generate it.

3 EXAMPLE

We illustrate NetRaVE on the dataset collected by Spira et al.
(2004). It consists of 22 283 gene expression measurements
(Affymetrix HG—U133A array) of epithelial cells taken from
the tracheas of 57 individuals in two groups: smokers (34)
and never smokers (23). The raw data were pre—processed by
RMA background correction, followed by quantile normalization
and ﬁnally summarization by robustly ﬁtting a multi—chip linear
model (Bolstad et al., 2003). GeneRaVE selects only three genes
separating the two classes—CEACAMS, ALDH3AI and CYPIBI.
Plug-in classiﬁcation was perfect, and 10-fold cross-validation
yielded only 2 and 3 misclassiﬁcations out of 34 smokers and 23
never smokers, respectively. Then, prior to constructing a network,
we combined data from probesets mapped to the same gene by
calculating their median value for each individual.

Using NetRaVE and sparse linear regression, we can generate
a dependency network as illustrated in Figure 1. The seed genes
(CEACAM5, ALDH3AI and CYPIBI) are the light red nodes, and
the directed edges pointing towards them from their regressors
(light blue nodes) in the ﬁrst round of regressions (depth 1) are
annotated with the cross-validated R2 of the sparse regression. For
example, ALDH3AI has two regressors (PIR and AKRIBIO), with a
cross-validated R2 of 0.78, whereas CEACAM5 has ﬁve, including
MUC5AC, UPKIB, SCGBIAI, CLDNIO and KRT 13 (R2 20.73).
The regressors, or neighbours, of genes in depth 1 are coloured
green, and, in turn, their neighbours are coloured purple. Note that
genes that appear at early depths can also be explanatory of genes
at later depths [e. g. the directed edge between ALDH3AI (depth 0)
and T FF3 (depth 2)].

4 DISCUSSION

There are a few options for generating and Visualizing dependency
networks that are discussed in the documentation accompanying
NetRaVE and in the Supplementary Material. In our experience in
analyzing this and other datasets, we have found many of the genes
in a local network are also found in top n lists of differentially
expressed genes obtained by, for example, modiﬁed t-tests. Here,
12 of the 32 genes in Figure 1 appear in the top-97 list of Spira
et al. (2004). For example, they found that ALDH3AI (depth 0) and
CYPIBI (depth 0) were highly up-regulated in smokers. However,
the network imposes an additional structure on those lists that
provides the researcher with a means of organizing and Visualizing
that information. The dependency network in Figure 1 shows other

genes that were not comparatively highly up- or down-regulated,
yet that are related to the effects of cigarette smoking. For example,
AKRIBIO is a potential diagnostic marker of non—small cell lung
carcinoma (Penning, 2005), and together with other aldo—keto
reductase genes (AKRI CI, AKRI C2 and AKRI C3) participates in
the metabolism of xenobiotics; the up-regulation of PIR, which
appears at depth 1, represents one mechanism by which cigarette
smoke induces apoptosis in the airway epithelium (Gelbman et al.,
2007); and many other such examples. In molecular toxicology
research, it is well documented that the transcription factor aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR, also called the dioxin receptor) enhances
gene transcription upon activation by polycyclic hydrocarbons such
as those found in cigarette smoke (reviewed in Kitamura and Kasai,
2007). It is tempting to speculate that some gene linkages within
the network in Figure 1 are due to coordinated gene expression in
response to activation of AhR by cigarette smoke toxins, but the
truth is inevitably more complex. Consider the effect of smoking
on epithelial inﬂamation. Linkages between some genes such as
M U C5AC (mucin super family member) and the CEACAM adhesion
molecules could also be due to effects of neutrophils (Fischer
and Voynow, 2007). Whether these mechanisms are behind the
expression patterns observed in the dataset by NetRaVE or not,
the ability to identify linkages between groups of genes provides
an alternative to unstructured data exploration.

We emphasize here that, like all inﬂuence networks, local
dependency networks should not be Viewed as a rigorous means
of uncovering true causal relationships among genes; instead, they
should be Viewed as a very useful tool for organizing complex
information in a manner that is easy to Visualize. The relationships
contained in them can then be used, along with related information
and background knowledge about the biological system being
studied, to guide further experimentation.

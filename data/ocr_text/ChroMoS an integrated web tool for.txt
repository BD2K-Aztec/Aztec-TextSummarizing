ABSTRACT

Summary: Genome-wide association studies and re—sequencing pro-
jects are revealing an increasing number of disease-associated SNPs,
a large fraction of which are non-coding. Although they could have
relevance for disease susceptibility and progression, the lack of infor-
mation about regulatory regions impedes the assessment of their
functionality. Here we present a web server, ChroMoS (Chromatin
Modified SNPs), which combines genetic and epigenetic data with
the goal of facilitating SNPs’ classification, prioritization and prediction
of their functional consequences. ChroMoS uses a large database of
SNPs and chromatin states, but allows a user to provide his/her own
genetic information. Based on the SNP classification and interactive
prioritization, a user can compute the functional impact of multiple
SNPs using two prediction tools, one for differential analysis of tran-
scription factor binding (STRAP) and another for SNPs with potential
impact on binding of miRNAs (MicroSNiPer).

Availability: Web server, ChroMoS, is freely available at http://epicen
ter.immunbio.mpg.de/services/chromos.

1 INTRODUCTION

The majority of SNPs from genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) and resequencing projects are located in non-coding
regions. This impedes the assessment of SNPs’ functional effect
and disease mechanisms. Handling this plethora of data requires
an automated SNP prioritization for initial analysis being fol-
lowed by more focused functional analysis downstream. In con-
current efforts, epigenetics studies have resulted in many publicly
available ChIP-Seq proﬁles. Ernst et al. (2011) designated chro-
matin states deﬁned by combinatorial patterns of marks using
the multivariate hidden Markov model. This allows segmenta-
tion of the genome into six annotated general chromatin cate-
gories, namely, enhancer, promoter, insulator, transcribed,
repressed and inactive states. In turn, these categories are sub-
divided further into strong, weak and poised states based on their
relationship to transcription level of distal and adjacent genes
and transcript positional enrichments.

Here we introduce a web server, ChroMoS, which combines
genetic and epigenetic data and facilitates SNP classiﬁcation and

prioritization. This integration is achieved through a large data-
base of GWAS results and chromatin annotations, or through
direct upload of user-deﬁned data in standardized ﬁle formats.
Using this data, SNPs can be classiﬁed as belonging to various
functional categories, such as enhancer or promoter, and prior-
itized for further analysis. The relationships between SNPs and
epigenetic categories were demonstrated by Ernst and colleagues
showing that disease-associated SNPs were signiﬁcantly more
likely to be positioned within strong enhancer segments than
neutral dbSNP variants. ChroMoS is also integrated with two
prediction algorithms, sTRAP and MicroSNiPer, to assess the
functional consequences of regulatory SNPs for some transcrip-
tional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, respectively.

2 DESCRIPTION OF TOOL

2.1 Integrating genetic and epigenetic data

ChroMoS was developed using Perl, PHP and J avaScript. It has
a PHP-based web interface and MySQL database as the back-
end. Perl CGI module runs on Apache 2 web server. ChroMoS is
platform-independent and compatible with all major web
browsers.

The GWAS data were obtained from National Human
Genome Research Institute GWAS catalog accessed on March
15, 2013 (Hindorff et al., 2009) and were inserted into local
MySQL database. BED ﬁles with liftover coordinates in th9
of the chromatin state assignments were downloaded Via http://
compbio.mit.edu/ENCODE_chromatin_states/ (Ernst et al.,
2011). Assigning of SNPs to one of the 15 chromatin states in
various cell types is carried out by engaging bedtools intersect
(Quinlan and Hall, 2010). Color maps are generated with
matrix2png (PaVlidis and Noble, 2003) software. Users can
also add their own SNP data through standardized variant call
format (VCF).

2.2 Data interpretation: STRAP and MicroSNiPer

A prediction tool, sTRAP (Manke et al., 2010), for differential
analysis of transcription factor binding integrated downstream of
ChroMoS pipeline allows inputting multiple SNPs (currently 60
SNPs) and runs with the initial threshold of one. After the ﬁrst
run, a user can rerun sTRAP with different thresholds.

A web server, MicroSNiPer (Barenboim et al., 2010), another
downstream tool for assessing the differential binding capacity of
annotated miRNAs, was updated with dbSNP ver.137 and hg19,
and is available at http://epicenter.immunbio.mpg.de/services/

microsniper. Large numbers of SNPs can be automatically trans-
ferred to MicroSNiPer in VCF and ﬁltered for SNPs positioned
in 3’UTRs of RefSeq transcripts (Pruitt et al., 2007). At this step,
custom SNPs can be added and ﬁltered before starting a routine
MicroSNiPer workﬂow.

2.3 Workﬂow and usage

A schema of ChroMoS components is presented in Figure 1. At
the entry page, a user can enter a list of any validated dbSNP
entries or select SNP sets from a large database of GWAS, either
by PubMed ID or disease trait, e. g. Crohn’s disease. A user can
provide individual rsID number, which will be linked to its re-
spective PubMed IDs. For example, selecting GWA study of
Franke et al. (2010) by its PMID: 21102463 retrieves 71 SNPs
associated with Chron’s disease from local MySQL database. On
the second page, a user can add her/his speciﬁc SNP dataset in
VCF.

Next, the user chooses cell types for which chromatin state
information is available and stored in ChroMoS. Currently this
includes the 15 states deﬁned by Ernst et al. (2011). The output
page provides a Visualization of the intersection between genetic
and epigenetic data and allows the SNP list to be reﬁned accord-
ing to the chromatin state classes (e.g. enhancer, promoter
states). The results can also be downloaded in ﬂat format for
sorting and downstream analysis.

Finally, the user-deﬁned SNPs can be selected manually or
with customizable ﬁlters. For the above example (PMID:
21102463), rs713875 is assigned to a strong enhancer state, point-
ing to its possible relevance in regulatory mechanism.

After SNP selection, the user can directly run the sTRAP
algorithm (Manke et al., 2010) to predict the impact of the
SNP on transcription factor binding. Transcription factors
with reduced afﬁnity receive a negative log-ratio of P—Values,
and those with increased binding get a positive log-ratio.

If it is suspected that the SNP might be involved in post-tran-
scriptional regulation, the results can be directly transferred to
the MicroSNiPer web server (Barenboim et al., 2010), which
predicts whether a SNP within a 3’UTR target site will dis-
rupt/eliminate or enhance/create a microRNA binding site.

3 UTILITY OF TOOL

To the best of our knowledge, currently there is only one web
server, HaploReg Ward and Kellis, 2012), for exploring anno-
tations of the non-coding genome in conjunction with the
GWAS or dbSNP variants. ChroMos has a number of beneﬁts
in comparison with this tool. First, it allows for easy and ﬂexible
selection of SNPs based on a simple representation of chromatin
state categories. Second, the user is not limited to predeﬁned
rsID SNPs, but can also evaluate new SNPs not yet contained
in the database. Finally, we provide concurrently a direct predic-
tion for the functional outcomes of multiple SNPs.

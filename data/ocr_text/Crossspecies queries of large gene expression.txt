ABSTRACT

Motivation: Expression databases, including the Gene Expression
Omnibus and ArrayExpress, have experienced significant growth
over the past decade and now hold hundreds of thousands of arrays
from multiple species. Since most drugs are initially tested on model
organisms, the ability to compare expression experiments across
species may help identify pathways that are activated in a similar way
in humans and other organisms. However, while several methods
exist for finding co-expressed genes in the same species as a
query gene, looking at co-expression of homologs or arbitrary genes
in other species is challenging. Unlike sequence, which is static,
expression is dynamic and changes between tissues, conditions
and time. Thus, to carry out cross-species analysis using these
databases, we need methods that can match experiments in one
species with experiments in another species.

Results: To facilitate queries in large databases, we developed a
new method for comparing expression experiments from different
species. We define a distance metric between the ranking of
orthologous genes in the two species. We show how to solve an
optimization problem for learning the parameters of this function
using a training dataset of known similar expression experiments
pairs. The function we learn outperforms previous methods and
simpler rank comparison methods that have been used in the past
for single species analysis. We used our method to compare millions
of array pairs from mouse and human expression experiments. The
resulting matches can be used to find functionally related genes, to
hypothesize about biological response mechanisms and to highlight
conditions and diseases that are activating similar pathways in both
species.

1 INTRODUCTION

Advances in sequencing technology have led to a remarkable growth
in the size of sequence databases over the past two decades. This has
allowed researchers to study newly sequenced genes by utilizing
knowledge about their homologs in other species (Lee et al., 2007).
Alignment and search methods, most notably BLAST (Altschul
et al., 1997), have become standard tools and are extensively used
by molecular biologists. Cross—species analysis of sequence data

is now a standard practice. However, similar usage of expression
databases has not materialized. Expression databases, including
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; www.ncbi.nih.gov/geo/) and
ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/Databases/microarrayhtml) hold
hundreds of thousands of arrays from multiple species (Fig. l).
Co—expression is a powerful method for assigning new function to
genes within a single species (Owen et al., 2003). If we are able
to identify a large set of matched expression experiments across
species this method can be extended and used in a cross—species
analysis setting as well. Consider a human gene with unknown
function that is co—expressed (across many different conditions)
with a mouse gene with known function. This information can
provide useful clues about the function of the human gene. This
information is also useful for identifying orthologs. If a gene has
multiple homologs in another species then the homolog with the
highest co—expression similarity in several conditions is likely its
orthologs since they are involved in the same processes in both
species.

While promising, querying expression datasets to identify co—
expressed genes in other species is challenging. Unlike sequence,
which is static, expression is dynamic and changes between tissues,
conditions and time. Thus, a key challenge is to match experiments in
one species with experiments in another species. Almost all studies
that have analyzed expression datasets in multiple species relied on
one of the two methods. They have either carried out experiments
under the same condition in multiple species or have looked at co—
expression within a species and tested whether these relationships
are retained across species. Examples of the former set of methods
include comparison of cell—cycle experiments across species (Jensen
et al., 2006), comparing response programs (Lelandais et al., 2008)
and comparing tissue expression between human and mouse (Su
et al., 2004). Examples of the latter strategy include the metaGene

analysis (Stuart et al., 2003) and cross—species clustering methods
(Lu et al., 2007). See Lu et al. (2009) for a recent review of these
methods.

Although successful, the approaches discussed above are not
appropriate for querying large databases. In almost all cases it is
impossible to ﬁnd a perfect match for a speciﬁc condition in the
database. Even in the rare cases when such matches occur it is not
clear if the same pathways are activated in the different species.
For example, many drugs that work well on animal models fail
when applied to humans, at least in part because of differences in
the pathways involved (Bussiere, 2008). Looking at relationships
within and between species would also not answer the questions
we mentioned above since these require knowledge of orthologs
assignment to begin with. These methods are also less appropriate
for identifying one to one gene matchings because they are focusing
on clusters instead.

The only previous attempt we are aware of to facilitate cross—
species queries of expression data is the non—negative matrix
factorization (NMF) approach presented by Tamayo et al. (2007).
This unsupervised approach discovers a small number of metagenes
(similar to principle components) that capture the invariant
biological features of the dataset. The orthologs of the genes included
in the metagenes are then combined in a similar way in the query
species to identify related expression datasets. While the approach
was successfully used to compare two speciﬁc experiments in
humans and mouse, as we show in Results, the fact that the approach
is unsupervised makes it less appropriate for large scale queries of
expression databases.

In this article, we present a new method for identifying similar
experiments in different species. Instead of relying on the description
of the experiments, we develop a method to determine the similarity
of expression proﬁles by introducing a new distance function and
utilizing a group of known orthologs. Our method uses a training
dataset of known similar pairs to learn the parameters for distance
functions between pairs of experiments based on the rank of
orthologous genes overcoming problems related to difference in
noise and platforms between species. We show that the function
we learn outperforms simpler rank comparison methods that have
been used in the past (Fujibuchi et al., 2007; Hunter et al., 2001). We
next use our method to compare millions of array pairs from mouse
and human experiments. The resulting matches highlight conditions
and diseases that are activating similar pathways in both species and
can also hint at diseases where these pathways seem to differ. Given
the large number of arrays in current databases our methods can
also be used to aid manual annotations of cross—species similarity
by focusing on a small subset of the millions of possible matches.

We note that while the discussion below focuses on microarray
data and we have only tested our methods on such data, our methods
are appropriate for deep sequencing expression data as well. As
long as a partial orthologs list can be obtained, the methods we
present below can be used to compare any expression datasets across
specres.

2 METHODS

2.1 Comparing microarrays across species

Our goal is to obtain a distance function that given two microarray datasets
outputs a small distance between experiments that are very similar and a large

distance for those pairs that study different processes or in which different
pathways are activated in the two species being compared. Since we are
comparing experiments from different platforms and species the ﬁrst decision
we made was to compare the ranking of the genes in each array rather than
their expression levels [previous methods for comparing experiments in the
same species have relied on ranking as well (Fujibuchi et 01., 2007)]. There
are a number of other properties that we seek for such scoring functions. First,
they should of course be able to separate similar pairs from non—similar pairs.
In addition, it would be useful if the function is a metric or a pseudometric
[a pseudometric satisﬁes all properties of a metric except for the identity, i.e.
d(x, y) could be 0 even if x 75 y]. This will guarantee useful distance properties
including symmetry and triangle inequality (see Supporting Methods in
Supplementary Material for the complete list). Finally, we would like to
be able to determine some statistical properties for these scoring methods
in order to determine a P—value for the similarity/difference between the
experiments being compared (Section 2.3.1).

2.1.1 Notations We ﬁrst provide notations that are used in the rest of the
article. As mentioned above our function would be constructed from metrics
on permutations (ordering) of ranks. Each microarray experiment is a vector
in R”, where each dimension is the expression value for a speciﬁc gene. We
consider the problem of comparing a microrarray X of a species A with nA
genes and a microarray 32 of a species B with my genes. There are m orthologs
between the two species. In other words, there is a one—to—one mapping 0
from m species A genes to m species B genes. l,...,m are the orthologs,
X={X,-:l§i§m} and Y={Y,-:l§i§m} are the expression values of the
orthologs in X and 32 , respectively. Let 71,0 be the rank orderings of the
expression values of the orthologs in X and Y. For simplicity, we assume
that there are no ties in rankings. Therefore, 71,0 are two elements of the
permutation group Gm. Recall that 71, 0: {1, . . . , m} —> {1, . . . , m} are bijections:
71(7), 0(7) are the ranks given to the ortholog i, with lowered numbered ranks
given to higher expression values. Also, let [m be the identity permutation in
Gm. Finally, tr(M) is the trace of a matrix M.

Assume we have a metric d on Gm. For our signiﬁcance analysis, we
test the null hypothesis H0 that 71 and 0 are not associated versus the
alternate hypothesis that they are. One way is to ask how large 11 (71, 0) would
be if 0 were chosen uniformly at random. More formally, let Dd be the
distribution of d(71, 0) when 0 is drawn uniformly from Gm. We reject the
null hypothesis H0 if d (71, 0) is signiﬁcantly smaller than E (Dd). This setting
is a standard approach in literature (Diaconis, 1988) (see also Supporting
Fig. l in Supplementary Material).

2.2 Fixed distance function: Spearman’s rank
correlation

Below we discuss distance functions that satisfy the requirements mentioned
above for cross—species analysis. We ﬁrst discuss a method that does not
require any parameter tuning. Such methods have been extensively used for
comparing permutations. However, as we show in Section 3.2 they are less
appropriate for gene expression data due to the unique properties of such
data. In the next section, we discuss modiﬁcation of these methods that are
more appropriate for the expression data we are working with.
The Spearman’s rank correlation R metric is deﬁned as

     

m

2(71(i)—0(i))2

i=1

R(71,0)= (I)

In other words, it is the L2 distance between 71 and 0. Hence, it is a metric.
Moreover, using Hoeffding’s central limit theorem it can be proved that R2
has a limiting normal distribution (Diaconis, 1988). Note that frequently,
R is standardized to have values in [—l, 1]. This yields the widely used
Spearman’s rank correlation ,0.

2.3 Adaptive Metrics

While ﬁxed methods that do not require parameter tuning have proven useful
for many cases they are less appropriate for the expression data. In such data,
the importance of the ranking is not uniform. In other words, genes that are
expressed at very high or very low levels compared to baseline may be
very informative, whereas the exact ranking of genes that are expressed at
baseline levels may be much less important. Thus, rank differences for genes
in the middle of the rankings are more likely due to noise. An appropriate
way to weight the differences between the rankings may lead to a better
distance function between arrays. The key challenge is to determine what
are the important ranks and how they should be weighted. Below we present
a number of adaptive methods that can address this issue. The methods we
present differ in the number of parameters that needs to be learned, and thus
each may be appropriate for different cases depending on the amount of
training data that exists.

2.3.1 Weighted Rank Metric Using a weight vector w of length m, we can
modify the Spearman’s rank correlation and deﬁne the following metric:

 

m

dew): Z(w(ar(i»—w(o(i»)2 (3)

i=1

The vector w deﬁnes the weight of each rank, and thus captures the
signiﬁcance of each rank in measuring the association of two microarrays.
Consider two arrays (l, 2, 3,4) and (l,3,2,4). Their Spearman’s R distance
is J2 while for a weight vector w=( 1,0,0, 1), their distance would be 0.
Such a weight vector places the weight on the top and bottom matches and
disregards middle orderings.

The resulting function is no longer a metric, but rather a pseudometric
in the original 71, 0 space (d(71,0)=0 does not imply 71:0). However,
it is easy to see that it is a metric in the transformed w(.)—space
because it is a L2 distance between the vectors w(71) and w(0), where
w(71): (w(711), ...,w(71m)) and similarly for w(0). In other words, the w—
transformation makes some of the permutations indistinguishable indicating
that the changes made are not signiﬁcant, and so the two permutations
result in the same weighted vector. However, for those permutations that are
still distinguishable following the w—transfonnation the metric properties are
preserved. The distribution Dd of d (71, 0) when 0 is drawn uniformly from
Gm is asymptotically normal. See Supporting Methods in Supplementary
Material for proof. We can calculate the mean and variance of Dd through
exact calculation or random sampling. P—value can then be calculated based
on this normal distribution.

A speciﬁc assignment of weights which is in line with our assumptions
regarding the importance of genes expression ranks is the following modiﬁed
Spearman’s rank correlation.

2.3.2 Top—bottom R For any 0<k<l and r>0, we can deﬁne w as
following:

r(i—km) if I S i <km,
w(i)= r(i—(l—k)m) if(l—k)m<i§m, (4)
0 otherwise.

Note that genes expressed at a high level will have negative weights and
those with low levels positive weights allowing the method to penalize
experiments, in which genes move from one extreme to the other. All middle
ranks [km, (1 —k)m] are assigned the same weight so genes that have ranks
changed within this interval do not affect the distance at all. At the same
time, it scales the high and low ranks r times to a wider range to increase
the granularity of rank difference. Choosing the value of k and r can either
be done using cross—validation or it could be manually speciﬁed.

2.3.3 Learning a complete weight vector w While the above method leads
to different weights for different rankings it speciﬁes a very strict cutoff,
which may not accurately represent the importance of the differences in

ranking. An alternative approach is to assign weights that are continuously
changing based on the ranking by learning a weight vector from the training
data. Here, we assume that we have access to such training data, which is
indeed the case for a number of pairs of species (most notably tissue data for
human and mouse as we use in Section 3). Assume we have M microarrays
of species A and N microarrays of species B and for each microarray, let S
be the set of pairs of similar arrays and D is the set of pairs of dissimilar
arrays. If the dissimilar arrays are not known, we can select D as the set of
all pairs that are not in 8.
Each permutation 71 can be represented as a binary m x m matrix M”.

 

1 if 71(i) =j,
M i, ' = 5
A J) :0 otherwise. ( )
Using this notation, we can deﬁne an L2 metric d as:
6101.0) = ||M71W_M0W||2 (6)
=ij (M, _M.,)T (M, —Ma)w (7)

Our goal is to learn a vector w such that this distance be small for
the positive set and large for the negative set. This leads to the following
optimization problem:

min 2 wT(M,,x—M,,y)T(M,,x—M,,y)w (8)
(xay)€8

s.t Z wT(M,,x—M,,y)T(M,,x—M,,y)w=1 (9)
(xay)€D

Note that the summation is on different groups. The optimization (top) is
summed over the similar pairs, whereas the constraint (bottom) is summed
over the dissimilar pair. The choice of the constant 1 on the right—hand side
of (9) is arbitrary. However, replacing it with any constant c > 0 results only
in w being multiplied by J? that leads to the same order of scores for
microarray pairs and so does not change our results. We can further simplify
the problem to

mianZSW (10)

s.thsz=1 (11)

with Z3 = Zgams (Mm, —M,,y)T (Mm, —M,,y) and Z1) = Emma
(Mm —M,Ty)T (Mm —M,Ty). The matrices Z5 and Z1) are positive
semi—deﬁnite since they are sums of positive semi—deﬁnite matrices
(Mm —M,Ty)T (Mm —M,Ty). Although this optimization is not convex, there
exists global minima based on the reformulation of this problem to ﬁnding
eigenvalues of the Rayleigh quotient. The derivation is similar to Fisher’s
Linear Discriminant Analysis (Hastie et al., 2009).

2.3.4 Relational Weighted Rank Metric A drawback of the weight vector
distance metric discussed above is that it assigns weights to ranks in each
microarray independent of the ranks in the other microarray. To overcome this
problem, we extend the vector weight w into a full matrix W to incorporate
the dependence between ranks in two microarrays. For a pair of microarrays
with ortholog rankings 71 and 0, deﬁne a symmetric m Xm matrix M}: 0,
whose entries (i , j) are non—zeros if and only if there exists a gene g such that
g is ranked i and j in the microarrays, respectively. Formally,

M£.(i,7)=1[n‘1(i)=o—1(7)]+1[n—1(7)=o‘1(i)] (12)

In other words, M}: a is a matrix where an entry of l in location (i , j) indicates
that the gene in location i in the ﬁrst experiment is the same as the gene in
location j in the second or vice versa. By deﬁnition, M}: a is a symmetric
matrix. Note that this deﬁnition implies that if a gene g is ranked i—th in
both 71 and 0 then  =2 and when 71:0, MF =21. Let W be a positive
semi—deﬁnite m x m matrix, with each entry Wl-aj being the weight assigned
to a gene having rank i and j in the two microarrays. The larger the entries

are, the more dependent the two ranks are.

Cross-species queries of large gene expression databases

 

Given these notations, we deﬁne the distance between the two
microarrays as

 

 

 

d(71,0)= ZZ((2I—M§0)0W)w (13)
\ i=1j=1
W.’.+W.,.
: Z 112 J] _Wl_,j) (14)
i,j:71T1(i)=0T1(j)
\ or71T1(j)=0T1(i)
d(71,0)= tr((zl—Mga)w) (15)

where o is the Hadamard, or simply entry—wise product. As mentioned above,
if the two permutations are identical then MF =2] and the distance is 0.
Otherwise, the penalty for a disagreement of a pair (i , j) between the rankings
is (W13,- + I/Vj, j) / 2 — Wl-J. This captures both the importance of the individual
ranks (very high or very low ranking genes maybe more important than
middle genes) as well as the penalty for the disagreement between the pair.
Equation (14) also shows that the entity under the square root is non—negative
since for a positive semi—deﬁnite matrix W, (WU + Wj, j) / 2 Z W), j,Vi, j.
Equation (15) follows from Equation (13) since MF has only one entry
in each column/row. In Supporting Methods (Supplementary Material), we
prove that this distance function is a pseudometric in the original permutation
space and a metric in the W—transformed space.

Learning algorithm: to determine the values of W using the training data,
we solve the following optimization problem:

min 2 tr((2I—M5xﬂy> W) (16)

(xay)€8

subject to Z tr((2l —M,€x,,,y> W) :1 (17)
(xay)€D
W a 0 (18)

Like for the weight vector the constraint (equality to l) is arbitrary
and guarantees that dissimilar arrays are distant from each other. This
optimization is a semi—deﬁnite program (Nocedal and Wright, 2006). The
objective function is a summation of traces of semi—deﬁnite matrices and so
this is a convex optimization problem and there exists a global minimum
solution. However, the matrix W is very large (m by m) and would require
large amounts of training data for learning. Since such data is limited using
a full rank matrix will likely lead to overﬁtting. Instead we seek a low—rank
approximation of W. Let Z be the rank k approximation of W: W %Z = YYT,
where Y eRn’d‘. Given these changes the optimization problem is

min tr (YTZS Y) (19)
subject to tr (1(sz Y) = 1 (20)

Material for a discussion on how to further regularize this optimization

problem and how to solve it using augmented Lagrangian approach.

3 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS

We ﬁrst used a training dataset from human and mouse tissues to
learn parameters for our distance functions and to test the different
methods on a dataset for which the correct answer is known. We next
downloaded a large number of microarray expression datasets from
GEO and applied our distance function to select pairs of experiments
that are similar. For this section, we consider the cross—species
analysis between human (Homosapiens) and mouse (M usmascalas)
biological samples. We obtained the list of 16 376 human and mouse
orthologs from Inparanoid (inparanoid.sbc.su.se).

3.1 Gene variance

Although the methods described above can work for any number of
orthologs, the larger the number the more data we would need to ﬁt
the weight vector and matrix methods. Since all our expression levels
were log ratios to a reference data (see below), we have excluded
from the analysis genes that did not vary much within each species.
We selected the top 500 most varying orthologs for further analysis.
We note two things. First, methods that are not affected by overﬁtting
(in our case Spearman’s correlation and TBR) were also tested using
all orthologs with results very similar to the results obtained from
the 500 gene list. Second, while such a selection favors genes with
high variance across a large number of experiments, at no stage in
the selection have we considered the agreement between the actual
levels of orthologous genes in speciﬁc experiments.

3.2 Testing distance metrics on data from human and
mouse tissues

For evaluation and comparisons of all metrics discussed in this
article, we used an expression dataset, which we call ‘Toronto
dataset’, consisting of expression proﬁles for 26 human tissues and
their corresponding tissues in mice (Chan et al., 2009). These 26
tissues pairs were proﬁled using species—speciﬁc custom arrays.
For each tissue, we had one human and one mouse arrays, which
were processed and normalized by the authors of Chan et al.
(2009). See Supporting Table l in Supplementary Material and
http://sb.cs.cmu.edu/Epr/ for the list of tissues.

We used 2—fold cross—validation with 10 random permutations of
tissues to compare the performance of the NMF method (Tamayo
et al., 2007) and the ﬁve different distance metrics discussed above.
For Pearson’s correlation, we select the varying 500 genes based on
their expression values. For NMF, we used the R code provided by
the authors, which also performs model selection to limit the number
of metagenes (Brunet et al., 2004). The human samples were used to
discover the metagenes and the mouse orthologs of these genes were
used for the mouse metagenes. For training of the methods discussed
in this article, we use the set of similar tissues as the positive set
and all the remaining pairs as negative examples. Using parameters
learned in the training phase, we rank all test pairs by their distance
and plot a Precision—Recall (PR) curve for all methods. Since the
dataset is highly skewed (i.e. there are many more negative than
positive pairs), PR curves provide a more informative picture of
the metrics’ performance than the receiver operator characteristic
(ROC) curves (Davis and Goadrich, 2006).

3 .2. I Comparison ofcross-species comparison metrics As can be
seen in Fig. 2 most methods (except for Spearman’s rank correlation)
achieved a very high precision to begin with (80% and higher).
However, this precision level drops and when reaching 20% recall
only the weight matrix method achieves a precision that is >90%.
Since there are hundreds of thousands of expression experiments in
GEO, precision is more important than recall for our goals. At these
high precision rates, the weight matrix method dominates the other
methods we have considered and thus we used it in all subsequent
analysis.

As for the other methods, we believe that Spearman’s rank
correlation performs worse than Pearson’s correlation because the
test dataset is well normalized so non—parametric methods loose
statistical power. However, in application to large, heterogenous,

datasets the assumption of normalization across the datasets is less
likely. For NMF, the fact that it is unsupervised and does not use
information from the query species to construct the components
likely led to its weaker performance. The results presented in
Figure 2 used an approximation matrix with Rank 3. We have also
tested other ranks (recall that Rank 1 is the weight vector shown
on the ﬁgure as well). We observe that both Ranks 2 and 4 do not
improve the overall success (http://sb.cs.cmu.edu/Epr/), and so we
have focused on Rank 3 matrices for the reminder of this article.

We have repeated the above analysis (comparison of methods)
using another, independent, human—mouse tissue dataset, which we
term the ‘Novartis dataset’, from Su et al. (2004). As we discuss
in Supporting Results in Supplementary Material, this additional
analysis agrees with the results presented above indicating that
our method is robust to the speciﬁc data used and to the different
platforms in these two studies.

Figure 3 presents the residual weights (Wi,l-—l—Vl/j,j) /2— WM,

values indicate that the penalty is smaller. Interestingly, the method
seems to focus more on the repressed genes and puts a higher weight

on genes that move from being repressed to being upregulated or at
a medium expression level.

3.2.2 Eﬂect 0f ortholog assignment on the performance of the
Matrix method Inparanoid contains over 10 000 known orthologs
between human and mouse making them one of the best annotated
pairs of species. As noted above, from this set we select a subset
of 500 genes and use these in our algorithms. To test whether our
methods would be appropriate to other species pairs for which much
fewer orthologs are known, we repeated the analysis discussed above
starting with a smaller set of orthologs. We selected random sets of
2000 orthologs (roughly 12% of all orthologs), and then reran our
method using this initial set (selecting the top 500 varying genes
from this smaller subset and running the matrix algorithm discussed
above). Figure 4 presents results for seven of these random sets.
The solid curve presents the results when starting with the full set
of orthologs. As can be seen our method is robust and is appropriate
for pairs of species with much fewer known orthologs as well.

3.3 Identifying similar experiments in GEO

The previous section shows that our weight matrix performs better
than standard metrics on the Toronto and Novartis datasets, and
moreover can get a very high precision for the recall value of 20%.
Our goal is to apply this new metric for retrieving cross—species
similar pairs of microarray experiments in a large dataset.

3 .3. I Data collection We downloaded 715 human and 769 mouse
datasets from GEO and used GDS data and metadata to identify
control samples for each dataset (http://sb.cs.cmu.edu/Epr/). Such
samples are important for properly normalizing and transforming
the data so that all data used is log 2 ratio of the response sample
to its control. We excluded from the analysis all datasets for which
we could not positively identify the control sample leaving us with
3416 human and 2991 mouse microarrays from 535 human and
641 mouse datasets.

3.3.2 Identiﬁcation of associated pairs of microarrays We used
the weight matrix trained using the full set of human—mouse tissue
pairs. We used the results of Figure 2 to select a similarity cutoff
corresponding to the cutoff that led to 95% precision and 10% recall.

Pearson Correlation

Fig. 5. Solid curve: correlation of orthologs not used for training in a random
sample of 301453 microarray pairs from human and mouse. Dashed curve:
correlation of orthologs not used for training in the set of microarray pairs
selected by our method.

Using this cutoff, we ended up with 301453 pairs of microarrays
whose distances are smaller than the cutoff which is roughly 3%
of all pairs tested. These pairs are from 14 493 dataset pairs (many
array pairs are from the same pair of human and mouse datasets).
We also looked at the distribution of scores under the null
hypothesis (since >95% of microarray pairs are not similar, this
can be done by selecting random human—mouse array pairs) and
determined that the P—value for the null hypothesis is uniformly
distributed, as expected. As a sanity check for our results, we also
computed the Pearson’s correlation across the pairs determined to
be signiﬁcant by our method for all human and mouse orthologs that
were not part of the 500 genes we used for learning the parameters.
Figure 5 shows the histogram of this correlation and the histogram
of the correlation for the same set of genes in a randomly selected set
of 301453 microarray pairs. As can be seen the selected experiments
are indeed more similar for many of the orthologs when compared
to random selected pairs indicating that our method can identify
correlated array pairs without using the experiment description.

3.3.3 Description and dataset analysis The list of pairs derived
by our method allows us to address many questions. We ﬁrst asked
what conditions/organs/tissues are the most similar between human
and mouse in terms of expression. We used the titles provided in
the metadata section of the GDS to identify common words that are
signiﬁcantly over—represented in the microarray pairs we extracted.
For each pair of similar experiments, a word that appears in both
titles could provide information about the relationship between the
pair. For each word, we have also computed the number of times
it appeared in a title for all microarrays used from each species
and the expected number of times it should have appeared in
the pairs we selected. Using the hypergeometric distribution, we
computed the over—representation P—value for each word. Table 1
presents the results of the analysis of over—represented words in
matched titles. As can be seen some organs and tissue types are
much more represented than others. For example, brain, muscles
and blood appear to have similar expression patterns between
the two species. Certain conditions are also over—represented,
most notably immune response. Several words are associated with
experiments related to such response including different types of
cells participating in the response (macrophages, dendritic, cd8).

#Pairs identiﬁed is the number of time this pair was observed. #Pairs expected is the
number of time expected based on single species occurrences. The P-value is computed
using the hypergeometric distribution.

In contrast, cancer, one of the most common words in the human
studies (roughly 10% of human datasets contained cancer in the
title) was not over—represented supporting recent results that most
mice are not an ideal model system for at least some types of cancer
(Sharpless and Depinho, 2006). We repeated this analysis using the
abstracts provided instead of the titles leading to similar results (see
http://sb.cs.cmu.edu/Epr/ for full results).We have also looked
beyond pairwise similarities and identiﬁed entire datasets (GDS
ﬁles) that contained several similar pairs of arrays between human
and mouse. An expert pathologist (Oltvai) manually inspected the
top 100 matched datasets and determined that over 80% of them
make biological sense (see Supporting Table 2 in Supplementary
Material). Many of the datasets identiﬁed as similar contained
experiments for the same tissue (most notably muscle, but also
blood and brain). However, some of the matches were less obvious.
Fibrosis is a chronic progressive and often lethal lung disease. One of
the top 50 matches in our results was between a human dataset titled
non—diseased lung tissue (GDS1673) and the mouse dataset titled
Pulmonary ﬁbrosis (GDS251). However, upon a closer inspection
of the mouse dataset it can be seen that it compares two mouse strains
treated with bleomycin. One is determined to be susceptible to
ﬁbrosis (C57BL6/J), whereas the other is determined to be resistant
(BALB/c). When looking at the similarities computed by our method
it can be seen that the vast majority of the top 100 matches are for the
BALB/c strains. Thus, our cross—species comparisons can be used to
identify cases in which similar pathways are activated even though
the conditions may be different.

3.3.4 Quarrying GEO t0 identijy cycling mouse genes To
demonstrate the utility of our method for quarrying large cross—
species databases like GEO, we used a set of 50 known human
cycling genes extracted from (Whitﬁeld et al., 2002). For each of
these genes we used all 301 453 microarray pairs determined to be
similar to identify the set of similarly expressed mouse genes using
Spearman’s correlations (regardless of their sequence similarity).
We retrieved the top 10 most similar mouse genes for each query

human gene resulting in a set of 206 genes. Note that the database
we used contained a diverse set of experiments and, while a few may
have been focused on cell—cycle studies the vast majority were not.
Importantly, our analysis here did not rely on any speciﬁc cell—cycle
time series dataset.

We used STEM (Ernst and Bar—Joseph, 2006) to determine
signiﬁcant GO categories associated with this list of mouse genes.
As can be seen in Table 2, all top categories that are enriched for
this set are related to cell cycle (including cell cycle itself). The
set of mouse genes contains orthologs of the original set of human
genes including CDC2A, a cell division control protein and CCNB 1,
an essential component of the cell—cycle regulatory machinery. The
list also contains many known mouse cell—cycle genes with no
homologs on the human list. These include members of a highly
conserved complex, which is essential for the initiation of DNA
replication (ORC1L and ORC6L), and PRIM1 and PRIM2 which
are involved in chromosomal replication during cell cycle. See
http://sb.cs.cmu.edu/Epr/ for complete list. These results highlight
the potential use of our method for identifying functionally related
genes across species.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

The growth of microarray databases opens the door to applications
that can simultaneously query sequence and expression databases to
identify both static and dynamic matches. However, these methods
would require a set of matching expression datasets in the species
being queried. Such matches are hard to come by. It is rare to
ﬁnd the exact same experiment (condition, time, tissues, etc.) in
multiple species. To allow the use of these databases, we looked at
several different distance metrics between expression experiments.
We deﬁned a new distance function that utilizes the ranking of
orthologs in both species. Our method uses a training dataset to
learn weights for differences in rankings between the species and
these differences are then summed up to determine the similarity
between the two experiments. Testing this method on a training
dataset of known similar pairs showed that it indeed improves upon
other distance measures and that it can achieve high precision.

We used our new distance function to retrieve similar experiment
pairs from GEO. The set of experiments identiﬁed by our method
allowed us to look at questions regarding the conditions and tissues
that activate similar expression patterns in human and mouse and to
ﬁnd a set of cycling mouse genes based on a set of known human

cycling genes. Many of these mouse genes are known to be cycling
and the rest of the genes identiﬁed are candidates for further study
into their role in the cell cycle.

Our method attempts to learn a new distance function for
permutations based on the training data. There has been recent
work in Machine Learning on trying to learn new distance function
for feature vectors (Bar—Hillel et al., 2005), though we are not
aware of any work so far that attempted to learn such methods
for permutations. A number of the methods developed for feature
vectors were later kernelized allowing for much faster computations.
It would be interesting to see if the Matrix weight method discussed
in this article can also be kernelized. We have primarily relied on one
to one orthology matches for computing the distance between pairs
of experiments. Since many orthology assignments are many to one
or many to many, methods that can utilize such information may be
able to improve upon the results suggested in this article. Our overall
goal is to compile a large set of expression pairs that can be used for
querying human and mouse genes. As we noted in the introduction
our method can also help in distinguishing between orthologs and
homologs by looking for genes with similar sequence that are also
co—expressed in the set of similar experiments. We would also like
to extend this work to other species and we are looking for training
data for these species.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The past several years have seen the development of
methodologies to identify genomic variation within a fetus through
the non-invasive sequencing of maternal blood plasma. These meth-
ods are based on the observation that maternal plasma contains a
fraction of DNA (typically 5—15%) originating from the fetus, and such
methodologies have already been used for the detection of whole-
chromosome events (aneuploidies), and to a more limited extent for
smaller (typically several megabases long) copy number variants
(CNVs).

Results: Here we present a probabilistic method for non-invasive ana-
lysis of de novo CNVs in fetal genome based on maternal plasma
sequencing. Our novel method combines three types of information
within a uniﬁed Hidden Markov Model: the imbalance of allelic ratios at
SNP positions, the use of parental genotypes to phase nearby SNPs
and depth of coverage to better differentiate between various types of
CNVs and improve precision. Our simulation results, based on in silico
introduction of novel CNVs into plasma samples with 13% fetal DNA
concentration, demonstrate a sensitivity of 90% for CNVs >400 kb
(with 13 calls in an unaffected genome), and 40% for 50—400 kb
CNVs (with 108 calls in an unaffected genome).

Availability and implementation: Implementation of our model and
data simulation method is available at http://github.com/compbio-

1 INTRODUCTION

Until recently, the prenatal analysis of a fetal genome required
samples directly obtained from the fetus by invasive procedures
like chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, where amniotic
ﬂuid is sampled from around the developing fetus.
Amniocentesis, however, has several important disadvantages.
Foremost, it carries a non-trivial risk of miscarriage [estimated
procedure-related fetal loss rate is 0.6—1 % (Douglas et al., 2007)],
and hence is refused by a fraction of patients. Secondly, amnio-
centesis cannot be performed too early, as the risk of miscarriage
rises signiﬁcantly, and is typically indicated for the 15th week of
pregnancy, outside of the time-frame for the safest abortion op-
tions (<12 weeks) and leaving only limited time for follow-up
analysis. Finally, amniocentesis is a complex and expensive med-
ical procedure ($1500—$3000). Consequently, amniocentesis is
typically performed only to conﬁrm or reject a diagnosis if a
genetic disease is suspected, e.g. high likelihood of Down syn-
drome based on prenatal ultrasound.

The last several years has seen the initial development of al-
ternative, non-invasive methods for prenatal genetic testing.
Prominent among these are methods that are based on analysis
(arrays or sequencing) of cell-free DNA (chNA) extracted from
maternal blood plasma, which contains an admixture of fetal and
maternal DNA. The fraction of fetal DNA in such an admixture
varies depending on multiple factors, including maternal weight
and size of the fetus, but typically builds up from ~5—7% early in
the pregnancy to 10% at week 10 WVang et al., 2013) to as much
as 50% before delivery (Fan et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). In
experiments conducted by Kitzman et al. (2012) (and utilized in
this article), the estimated admixture in samples obtained at 8
weeks and 18.5 weeks of gestation was 7 and 13%, respectively.

The decreasing cost of DNA sequencing has made it practical
to directly sequence chNA extracted from maternal blood to
identify likely genetic disorders present in the fetus. Non-invasive
methods are becoming more commonly used to directly identify
aneuploidies (abnormal chromosome counts) and are also
enabling preventive screening for heritable genetic diseases, re-
sulting in better prenatal health care (Saunders et al., 2012).
While most non-invasive genetic diagnostics aim to test for a
particular previously known biomarker, Kitzman et al. (2012)
demonstrated the possibility of the reconstruction of the whole
genome of the fetus by combining whole-genome sequencing of
parental genomes with deep sequencing of chNA from mater-
nal plasma (78x coverage). The key intuition in this method is
the comparison of allelic ratios at individual SNP loci, as the
inheritance of a particular paternal allele affects the percentage
of reads with that allele at the particular position in the genome.
This method heavily relies on the availability of phased parental
genotypes, as these allow for the inference of likely co-inherited
SNPs, leading to an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio. It
consequently provides for high accuracy identiﬁcation of in-
herited (98% accuracy) but not de novo single nucleotide variants
(17 correct calls out of 44 true de novo sites, with 3884 called
positions).

While most efforts to detect copy number variants (CNVs)
from chNA sequencing have so far concentrated on whole-
chromosome events [e.g. Chu et al. (2009)], the past year has
seen the ﬁrst few attempts at methods for genome-wide identiﬁ-
cation of sub-chromosomal de novo CNVs. Such methods are
desired to enable non-invasive prenatal screening for diseases
like DiGeorge syndrome (~3 Mb deletion), Prader-Willi syn-
drome (the deletion subtype caused by a ~4 Mb deletion) and
other disorders associated with a mid to large sized CNV. So far
two manuscripts address the problem of detecting sub-chromo-
somal CNVs (Chen et al., 2013; Srinivasan et al., 2013). While
the exact methods used in both of these approaches differ, both
rely on depth of coverage: they map the reads to the genome,

Probabilistic method for detecting CNV

 

divide the genome into bins and identify the CNVs by comparing
the number of reads mapped to each bin. The key idea in these
methods is that deletions/duplications will result in more/fewer
fetal reads within a window, and this difference can be identiﬁed
using statistical methods. Srinivasan et al. (2013) use depth-of-
coverage computed in 1 Mb windows across the genome to iden-
tify CNVs that are typically >1 MB, though they do report dis-
covery of a 300 kb CNV. Nine of the 22 discovered CNVs in 11
patients were concordant with karyotyping results, with most
discrepancies being short (<1 Mb) CNVs. Importantly, they use
extremely short (25 bp) reads, allowing for larger number of frag-
ments at equal coverage depth. Chen et al. (2013) use even larger
10 Mb windows, again considering only the number of fragments
mapped, and are able to successfully identify variants 9—29 Mb
with only one false positive among six true positives in 1311 pa-
tients. Both methods utilize low coverage WGS of the plasma
chNA, while leveraging the large number of samples.

In this manuscript, we introduce a novel model for non-
invasive prenatal identiﬁcation of de novo CNVs with increased
sensitivity compared with methods published so far. Our method
combines three types of information within a uniﬁed probabilis-
tic model. First, our method takes advantage of the imbalance of
allelic ratios at SNP positions that are introduced by various
types of paternally and maternally inherited CNVs. Secondly,
following the work of Kitzman et al. (2012), we use parental
genotypes to phase nearby SNPs, modelling their co-inheritance
(or recombination) and thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio.
Finally, we observed that allelic ratios poorly differentiate be-
tween certain types of CNVs: for example, as further described
below, a duplication of a paternally inherited allele results in
extremely similar allelic ratios to deletion of a maternally in-
herited one. We thus combine the allelic ratios with the depth-
of—coverage signal to better differentiate between such cases. Our
simulation results, based on in silico introduction of novel CNVs
into plasma samples with 13% fetal DNA concentration, dem-
onstrate a sensitivity of 90% for CNVs >400 kb (with 13 calls in
an unaffected genome), and 40% for 50—400 kb CNVs (with 108
calls in an unaffected genome).

2 METHODS

Our method models two types of signal from the data: (i) imbalance of
the allele distributions at SNP loci (discussed in Section 2.1) and (ii)
number of fragments sequenced from ~1kb genomic regions (discussed
in Section 2.2). Though each of these is noisy, the two are (nearly) inde-
pendent (modulo number of reads overlapping the SNP position) vari-
ables and can be combined into a single generative model. For this
purpose, we use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), where we interpret
the allele counts at SNP loci as emissions, while the coverage is used as a
prior probability for each state (see Section 2.3).

For our method, we assume that we have phased haplotypes of both
parents, and deep sequencing data of chNA from maternal plasma. In
practice we used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for the parents,
with phasing based on 1000 Genomes data (see Section 3.1). All de novo
CNVs thus correspond to a particular parental haplotype duplication or
deletion event. Labelling the two maternal and paternal haplotypes as
M A, M B, P ,4, PB. For each inheritance pattern—normal inheritance, ma-
ternal duplication, paternal duplication, maternal deletion, paternal dele-
tion—we introduce a set of phased inheritance patterns that enumerates all
the possible conﬁgurations of fetal haplotypes corresponding to the

respective inheritance pattern. For example a duplication in the maternal
gamete will consist of one (or more) of six phased inheritance patterns:

MAMAPA, MAMBPA, MBMBPA,
MAMAPB, MAMBPB, MBMBPB

There are a total of 20 phased inheritance patterns (PP): six each for
maternal/paternal duplication, two each for maternal/paternal deletion
and four for normal inheritance). We refer to the number of alleles
(copy count) inherited by the fetus as |PP|. We use r to refer to the
percentage of chNA that is fetus-derived; this parameter is estimated
from positions in the genome where the parents are homozygous for
alternate alleles.

2.1 SNP allele distribution

For every SNP locus we observe a distribution of nucleotides in maternal
plasma reads. In this section we focus on calculating the probability of the
observation with respect to a phased inheritance pattern. Formally, we
observe the counts of the four nucleotides {kA, kc, kg, kT} and compute
the probability of observing each of these from a particular phased in-
heritance pattern PP. Ideally, these counts should follow multinomial
distribution with the parameter vector (pA, pc, pg, pT). However we
have found that modelling them as independent Gaussians with variance
equal to the mean (as an approximation of the Poisson), makes the in-
ference of the inheritance pattern more robust to noise.
More formally,

Pr[kx|MA, MB; PA, PB; r; PP]~N(:u’x’ m.) (1)

To compute the expected support ,ux for x e {A, C, G, T}, we ﬁrst
adjust the mixture ratio r based on the expected number of fetal haplo-
types |PP|, as absence/presence of an additional fetal copy in the plasma
sample inﬂuences the local fetal mixture ratio. We accommodate this in-
ﬂuence of |PP| expected fetal haplotypes instead of regular two as follows:

r, = |PP| -r/2 (2)
|PP|-r/2+(1— r)

Then for each nucleotide x we compute the probability 1),, of observing
a read supporting x. Such a read might have originated from multiple
haplotypes, including two maternal haplotypes and |PP| fetal haplotypes.
We can individually evaluate this probability for each haplotype and
subsequently sum them to obtain px:

px = 2 [Mi equals x] - m,(1 — r’)
ie{A,B}

+ 2 [y equals x] -

yePP

(3)

r!

|PP|

 

For reads putatively coming from maternal portion of the chNA
sample, we correct for maternal CNVs by using the allele ratios m,- as
observed in maternal-only sequencing data. Additionally, to mitigate
noise we add pseudocount or (proportional to the genome-wide coverage)
to these counts.

or + #reads supporting M ,- in maternal sample

 

(4)

1 205+ 2 #reads supporting ill]- in maternal sample
J'E{A,B}

We thus obtain the expected probability distribution for each nucleo-
tide observed at this SNP locus.

To obtain the expected number of reads ,ux supporting particular vari-
ant at this SNP locus, we have to multiply 1),, by the number of reads
mapped,

Mx =px - #mapped reads (5)

As we describe later, we use this probability distribution me, ,ux)
that is conditional on phased pattern PP as the emission distribution for
each nucleotide in our HMM.

2.2 CNVs and depth of coverage

Variations in number of fragments sequenced per a region is a standard
measure used for detection of mid- to large-sized CNVs [see Medvedev
et al. (2009) for a review], and has also been used for CNV detection from
maternal plasma (Chen et al., 2013; Srinivasan et al., 2013). However, the
relatively low admixture of fetal DNA in the maternal plasma together
with chNA sequencing biases considerably limit potential of methods
relying on coverage signal from a single sample. Furthermore, the high
variability of the coverage derived from blood plasma (Fig. 1) makes it
difﬁcult to identify shorter CNVs. Thus, methods Chen et al. (2013) and
Srinivasan et al. (2013) use large bins and require multiple datasets to
establish a baseline for CNV calling.

Simultaneously, the coverage forms an important complementary
signal to the allelic distributions described above: certain ratios have
very similar probability under different phased patterns, 6. g. a deletion
of a maternally inherited allele may yield distributions similar to a pater-
nally inherited duplication. Incorporating the coverage signal helps to
discriminate such states. In our method, we use the coverage information
as a noisy predictor to complement the signal we obtain from SNP loci.

As a measure of coverage in a genomic region, we use window ratio
value (WRV) analogous to the bin ratio value measure used by Srinivasan
et al. (2013), which is essentially the number of fragments mapped to the
region and normalized by the number of fragments mapped to other
regions with similar GC content. Note that WRVs are independent of
GC content and depth of sequencing of the sample.

For the purpose of our model, we split the genome to non-overlapping
windows, each containing a single SNP, with breakpoints being in the
middle between two adjacent SNPs. For each SNP i the corresponding
WR V,- for the window W,- containing the i-th SNP position is then com-
puted as the ratio of number of fragments NW, mapped to W, to the sum
of fragments mapped to 200 windows of the same size with GC content
closest to VV,-:

lion fragments (FPKM) in 1 megabase segments for plasma sample (blue)
and maternal sample (red) of the II trio

However, the variable length of the windows makes such computations
expensive as computation of neighé’8( Wi) is linear in number of windows.
To make the WRV computations practical, we scale N W, to correspond
to expected number of fragments as if |W,-|=1kb by multiplying NW1.
by 1000/I Wil (for clarity, not shown in our equations). Then WRVs in
lkb bins can be precomputed, enabling us to ﬁnd neighé’8(W,-) in time
logarithmic from the number of bins. Using lkb bins is a good approxi-
mation as the mean distance between two adjacent SNP loci is expected
to be 1 ~ kb.

Overall, our goal is to estimate the probability of observing WR V? in
the studied plasma sample conditional on the number of fetal haplotypes
(|PP|), which is either three for duplication, one for deletion or two for
normal inheritance. To do so, we use a reference sample to obtain WR V?
for comparison (computed in the same genomic window Wi). Further we
need to compute two more reference WR Vle, each scaled to reﬂect one
CNV type. For duplication, we would expect to see (1 + r /2) times more
fragments while for deletion (1 — r/2) times less fragments, thus the
scaled WRVf’IPP' is estimated as

NW5 -(1+(|PP| — 2) - r/2)

 

R, PP _
WR V, ' ' —

Finally, we can compute the probability of WR V? being generated
from an event with fetal allele copy count |PP| as:

N(WRVZB’IPPI — WRVj-g; ,U/ = 0, O’noise) 

where we model the difference between WR V? and WR V? as a Gaussian
noise with zero mean and empirically estimated variance amiss.

By normalizing the probabilities of WR V? w.r.t. all phased patterns,
we obtain priors for each phased pattern that are used in the HMM
described in the next section.

As a reference plasma sequencing coverage, we use plasma sample of
the G1 trio of Kitzman et al. (2012) dataset, as the overall coverages
observed in corresponding bins between the two samples correlate well
(mean absolute error of WRVs being 0.000347, see Fig. 2A). Because
coverage variation of chNA from plasma has much wider distribution
than standard WGS, a sample from other plasma is more suitable than
the same trio maternal sample (see Fig. 2B) for purpose of coverage
distribution reference in our model. Availability of additional plasma
datasets would enable us to further improve the accuracy of the reference
bins.

Note that compared with previous methods, we use signiﬁcantly smal-
ler windows: ~1kb versus 100 kb—l Mb used previously by Chen et al.
(2013) and Srinivasan et al. (2013). As mentioned earlier, our goal here is
not to detect CNVs immediately, but to rather compute a probability
distribution over the number of haplotypes the fetus has inherited, which
are used as priors in the more complex model. Due to the independence
assumptions inherent in the HMM we want these priors, applied at each
state, to be (approximately) independent, and hence we picked non-over-
lapping windows each containing one SNP locus.

2.3 HMM for CNV Inference

To combine the signals from individual SNP positions, we use an HMM
with 20 states corresponding to modelled phased inheritance patterns
(Fig. 3). That means each sate represents a possible set of parental haplo-
types inherited by the fetus. States representing normal inheritance are
central to the model assuming that two CNVs cannot be immediately
subsequent. Between states of the same inheritance pattern, we allow for
transitions reﬂecting either recombinations or errors in phasing. For each
state, the emissions are the counts of individual alleles in reads mapped to
that particular SNP position. The probability of the observed emission is
the probability of such allele counts in the expected allele distribution

conditional on phased inheritance pattern as described above in
Section 2.1.

To incorporate the coverage information, for each SNP position, we
multiply the transition probabilities into the state by the copy number
priors obtained in Section 2.2. Speciﬁcally, each edge incoming to a state
is multiplied by the corresponding prior of inheriting that many haplo-
types, which are then normalized so that the sum of the probabilities
leaving each state is one.

The transition probabilities within an event type (c. g. maternal dupli-
cation) were set to 0.01, to reﬂect expected haplotype block lengths of
several hundred SNPs. Further, the transition probability for starting a
CNV was set to one in ten thousand SNP loci (0.0001) with length ex-
pected to span approximately one thousand SNPs (i.e. transition prob-
ability back to normal inheritance was set to 0.001).

2.4 CNV Simulation in silico

To evaluate the accuracy of our CNV discovery algorithm, we created
simulated datasets with CNVs of various sizes inserted into the sequenced
plasma. While previous approaches have used simple Poisson modelling
of the coverage of chNA for simulation purposes (Chen et al., 2013), we
propose a more elaborate model to more accurately model the extremely
uneven coverage that we observe in chNA samples (Fig. 1). Our simu-
lation performs the deletion or duplication of a particular fetal allele. We
need to resolve the haplotypes of every individual in the trio, to correctly
add or remove reads originating from a target haplotype of the CNV
event. Similarly to our detection method (described in Results, below), we
used Beagle 4 (Browning and Browning, 2013) with 1000 Genomes
Project reference haplotypes; however, we also use the fetal genome
sequenced after delivery, and utilize pedigree information to phase each
individual in the trio.

To simulate a duplication, of either maternal or paternal origin,
we used the parental DNA sequencing data from the family trio
dataset. First, we ﬁltered for reads mapping to the intended region
of duplication that also match the target haplotype of the parent ac-
cording to the parental phasing. In case of reads not uniquely mapping
to either of the two parental haplotypes, i.e. the read mapped to a
region without any heterozygous SNP locus, the read was selected
randomly with probability 0.5. Subsequently, the ﬁltered reads were
uniformly down-sampled according to fetal DNA mixture ratio and
the original plasma DOC in this region to match the expected number
of reads derived from a single fetal haplotype in plasma sequencing.
Resulting reads were then mixed together with original plasma reads to
create a plasma sample containing the desired duplication in the fetal
genome.

To simulate a deletion, we ﬁrst identiﬁed a fetal haplotype in-
herited from the parent of choice, which was to be deleted. We ﬁltered
the plasma sample removing reads coming from this target fetal haplo-
type. That is, each read mapped to the intended deletion region was
removed with probability of belonging to the fetus and also being
inherited from the intended parent. To ﬁnd this probability, we used
the phasing to check which maternal and fetal haplotypes match the
SNPs in the read. If none of the four haplotypes matched the read, we
removed the read with probability r/2 where r is the fetal DNA ad-
mixture ratio. If the fetal target haplotype matched the read, it was
removed with probability

r/2
NIn - (1 — r)/2+Nf - r/2

 

(9)

where 0<Nf 5 2 and 0 5 NIn 5 2 are respectively the number of fetal
and maternal haplotypes that matched the read.

We also simulated plasma datasets with decreased fetal DNA mixture
ratio. To achieve a desired down-rated admixture ratio r’ in our plasma
sample, we had to remove appropriate number of reads coming from the
fetal DNA. First, we have computed the appropriate fraction of

fetal-origin reads, w.r.t. original admixture ratio r, to be removed from
the plasma as

l—r r’

 

(10)

I‘del = 1 — r ' m

Similarly to simulation of a deletion, we have then ﬁltered the plasma
reads for reads originating from the fetal genome. Since this cannot
be decided without ambiguity, we estimated the corresponding probabil-

ity Pr:

Nf - r/2 .
1ff Nm+N >0
mm: N..-(1— r)/2+N. - r/2 f (11)

r lfme+Nf=0

 

where Nf and Nm, as above, are the number of fetal and maternal haplo-
types that match SNP alleles of the read. Thus a read was then removed
with probability equal to

rdel 'Pf(5861) (12)

3 RESULTS

3.1 Datasets and processing

In our experiments, we used WGS data of two mother—father—
child trios II (Table 1), and G1, published by Kitzman et al.
(2012). In our experiments, we mainly used the ﬁrst trio II
with 13% fetal admixture in obtained plasma. For maternal,
paternal and plasma datasets, the reads were aligned to the
hg19 genome using BWA. We genotyped both the parents
using Samtools and chtools. To improve the precision of geno-
typing, we only consider variants at positions previously identi-
ﬁed as variable within the 1000 Genomes Project. Subsequently
we phased the haplotypes using Beagle 4 (Browning and
Browning, 2013) with reference haplotype panels from 1000
Genomes Project.

3.2 Evaluation

We simulated 360 CNVs in 11 plasma to evaluate our methods
recall, while G1 plasma sample served as a reference in DOC-
based CNV estimation as described in Section 2.2. For each test
case, we picked a random position in chromosome 1, outside
annotated centromere and telomeres regions, to place the simu-
lated CNV. Our simulation methods are described in detail in
Section 2.4. We then ran our algorithm on a genomic window
starting 20 Mb before the simulated CNV and ending 20 Mb
after the CNV. The results are shown in Table 2. We acknow-
ledge a CNV as correctly called if CNV predictions of the same
type span at least 50% of it, while precision is computed as the
fraction of correct CNV calls over all calls of that category. To

Note: The ‘ratios only’ column corresponds to the method that only uses allelic ratios, but not the coverage prior. In such cases both the
precision and recall are mostly dominated by the model combining both signals. (We write ‘NA’ in a precision ﬁeld if no call of such

 

CNV category was predicted by the model).

Note: The same test set composed of 360 in silico simulated CNVs was used as in Table 2. We ran the model with 100, and 300 kb bin
sizes. (We write ‘NA’ in a precision ﬁeld if no call of such CNV category was predicted by the model).

evaluate the effect the admixture has on accuracy, we repeated
this experiment not only with the original plasma dataset, but
also once down-sampled to only contain 10% admixture.

The results indicate that our method can achieve nearly perfect
recall and precision for variants >3 megabases, and promising
results down to CNVs of 400 kb. Maternally inherited events are
typically more difﬁcult to identify than paternally inherited ones,
and deletions more difﬁcult than duplications, possibly due to
complete dropout of fetal alleles due to reduced admixture.

To evaluate power of individual signals utilized by our
uniﬁed model, we also tested models that take into consideration
only either the allelic ratios or coverage information. The al-
lelic ratios only model is as described above in Section 2.3 but
without multiplying of copy number prior in the transition prob-
abilities. Obtained results are shown together with the results of
the uniﬁed model in Table 2.

For predicting fetal CNVs based solely on coverage informa-
tion, we split the sample to bins of uniform size and computed

WRVs for each, following the work of Srinivasan et al. (2013).
We then ran a simple HMM with three states corresponding to
normal inheritance, duplication and deletion, respectively. The
WRVs in bins were interpreted as emissions and the emission
distributions were computed as described in Section 2.2,
Equation (8). We tested the HMM with bin sizes of 100 and
300kb, and the results are summarized in Table 3. Using
larger bins limit resolution of the method, e.g. in case of
300 kb bins the obtained recall on <400 kb CNVs is (close to)
zero. On the other hand for large CNVs >3 Mb using 300 kb bin
size mostly improves upon 100 kb bins in terms of both recall and
precision.

Note, that a direct comparison with the methods by Chen
et al. (2013) and Srinivasan et al. (2013) is not possible, as they
are tailored to low coverage plasma sequencing data and require
a large number of control plasma samples to evaluate signiﬁ-
cance of observed coverage variation in the studied plasma
sample for CNV calling.

Note: For each CNV size, we also show (in parenthesis) the number of calls that are from at least 50% overlapped by
CNVnator (Abyzov et al., 2011) calls on the fetal, maternal and paternal genomes, respectively.

To further test precision of our combined method, we ran our
combined model on the whole plasma dataset (expected to con-
tain no large de novo variants) and observed the number of CNV
calls for each size. These numbers are shown in Table 4, with in
silico accuracy for each length shown for comparison. Notably, a
large fraction of the larger false-positive calls correspond to
CNVs already present in parents (and hence inherited, rather
than de novo).

3.3 Implementation note

Our model is implemented in the Python programming language
with the PyPy interpreter. When ran on a whole genome dataset,
our implementation required up to 20 GB of system memory and
took <4h of single thread CPU time to ﬁnish.

4 DISCUSSION

In this manuscript, we introduce a novel probabilistic method for
the identiﬁcation of de novo CNVs from maternal blood plasma
sequencing with largely increased sensitivity compared with
methods published so far. Our method combines three types of
data: allelic ratios, reﬂecting the changes in the expected obser-
vations of various alleles at SNP positions in the presence of the
CNV; phasing information, allowing for the combining of allelic
ratios across multiple SNP positions, thus improving the signal-
to-noise ratio; and depth of coverage information reﬂecting the
change in expected sequencing depth in the presence of the CNV.
We apply the resulting method to simulated sequencing data,
demonstrating promising results for CNVs >400 kb in length,
and especially for CNVs of paternal origin.

Simultaneously, we believe our method can be further im-
proved in several ways. First, our approach of modelling the
depth of coverage prior using small windows is likely suboptimal.
Especially because the method is searching for larger CNVs,
using larger windows would be advantageous; however, in this
case the observations of coverage at adjacent SNPs would no
longer be independent, and thus not properly modelled as an
HMM. We believe a more expressive model that is able to
model such interactions between coverage terms would improve
on the current results. Secondly, our method does not directly
model potential inherited CNVs in the father (maternally in-
herited CNVs are modelled through the use of maternal priors
at each position). Explicitly pre-computing and utilizing
information about these inherited CNVs is likely to reduce the
false-positive rate of ours and related methods. Thirdly, we
incorporated the coverage signal in our model by comparing

the observed WRV with the corresponding WRV in a reference
plasma sample (G1 in our experiments). Using multiple plasma
references would reduce individual-speciﬁc biases, thus improve
the overall performance.

The main limitation of our method in practice is the need for
deep maternal plasma chNA sequencing to exploit the allelic
ratios signal. Note that the parental genome WGS could be
replaced by genotyping using SNP arrays; however, the need
for a paternal sample is a limitation for broad clinical use.

Abstract

Summary: The do_x3dna package has been developed to analyze the structural fluctuations of
DNA or RNA during molecular dynamics simulations. It extends the capability of the 3DNA package
to GROMACS MD trajectories and includes new methods to calculate the global—helical axis of
DNA and bending fluctuations during simulations. The package also includes a Python module
dnaMD to perform and visualize statistical analyses of complex data obtained from the trajectories.
Availability and Implementation: The source code of the do_x3dna is available at https://github.
com/rjdkmr/do_x3dna under GNU GPLV3 license. A detailed documentation, including tutorials
and required input data, are freely available at http://rjdkmr.github.io/do_x3dna/.

1 Introduction

Interactions of double helical nucleic acids, namely dsDNA and
dsRNA, with proteins are essential for several biological processes
including DNA replication (Masai et 61]., 2010), transcription
(Shandilya and Roberts, 2012), translocation (Crozat and Grainge,
2010) or packaging (Andrews and Luger, 2011; Casjens, 2011). To
understand the functional mechanism of these processes, structural
properties of nucleic acids have been probed using both experimen—
tal and computational studies. In particular, molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations have been widely applied to study the roles of nu—
cleic acids in biological process at atomic resolution (Cheatham and
Case, 2013; Mackerell and Nilsson, 2008; Rohs et 61]., 2009). In this
context, several structural descriptors (Lu and Olson, 2003) fre—
quently need to be calculated from the MD simulations.
GROMACS (Pronk et 61]., 2013), a widely used open—source MD
simulation software package, does not offer tools to calculate such
structural descriptors of the dsDNA or dsRNA. Presently, two soft—
ware tools, 3DNA (Lu and Olson, 2008) and Curves—l—(Lavery
et 61]., 2009), are available to calculate these descriptors of nucleic
acids using a PDB input file. These two packages have been ex—
tended for use with MD trajectory files in either PDB or AMBER

format. However, these packages cannot be used directly with bin—
ary format trajectories (trr/xtc) and topology—parameter (tpr) files
generated by GROMACS.

Therefore, we have developed the do_x3dna package, which dir—
ectly takes GROMACS input files, calculates structural descriptors
frame wise using the 3DNA package, and generates output files in
text format. These files can be further used for statistical analyses.
However, these output files potentially contain large amounts of
data, particularly as microseconds simulations are becoming rou—
tine. Consequently, analyses of raw data obtained from do_x3dna
can be challenging. To address this problem, we additionally de—
veloped the Python module dnaMD, which contains several meth—
ods to extract and analyze raw data that were previously calculated
using the do_x3dna.

2 Implementation

The do_x3dna package consists of two parts: (i) the do_x3dna tool
and (ii) the dnaMD Python module (Fig. 1). The do_x3dna tool is
written in C and links against GROMACS libraries libgmx, libmd
and libgmxcma. It uses external 3DNA tools ‘find_pair’ and

‘analyze’ to calculate structural descriptors for each frame, which
are on the ﬂy dumped as a PDB file from the trajectory. The
do_x3dna tool requires a topology—parameter (tpr), a trajectory (trr/
xtc) file and optionally an atomic index (ndx) file as input. The user
interface of this program is similar to other GROMACS tools.
Additionally, the option for structure alignment is provided to fit
each snapshot on the starting structure.

Currently, do_x3dna can be used to calculate structural descrip—
tors such as base—pair parameters (shear, stretch, stagger, buckle,
propeller and opening), base—step parameters (shift, slide, rise, tilt,
roll and twist) or helical parameters (X—displacement, Y—displace—
ment, helical rise, inclination, tip and helical twist). The option to
calculate their average values over time is provided. In addition,
major and minor grooves of the double helix, backbone (or, ﬂ, 3), (3, 8
and f) and sugar dihedral angles of both strands, helical radii of
both strands and positions of local helical axes can be calculated.
Moreover, it generates hydrogen bond map for each base—pair as a
function of time.

The dnaMD module uses the external Python modules NumPy
(van der Walt et al., 2011) and SciPy (http://www.scipy.org/). A de—
tailed documentation of dnaMD is provided at this website http://
rjdkmr.github.io/do_x3dna/apidoc.html. dnaMD implements a
DNA class containing several variables and methods in an object
oriented approach. An instance of this class can be initialized with
the number of base—pairs present in the dsDNA. Subsequently, the
data can be stored in this object variable by reading input files using
implemented methods. Subsequently, the data can be analyzed using
methods such as time_vs_parameter, parameter_distribution, get_
mean_error, dev_bps_vs_parameter, generate_smooth_axis, calcula—
te_curvature_tangent, etc. (see details in the above website).
Additionally, this module calculates global helical axis by fitting a
smooth curve on coordinates of local helical axis using cubic spline
interpolation (Fig. 1B).

Several tutorials including necessary input files are provided
online at http://rjdkmr.github.io/do_x3dna/tutorial.html, which
describe how to use the dnaMD module for analyses.

3 Discussion

The current implementation was tested with simulation trajectories
of a dsDNA, which was either unbound or bound to the protein
channel of Phi29 bacteriophage in MD simulations. Subsets of these
tests are available online as tutorials at above described website.
The tutorials exemplify the use of dnaMD to characterize the impact
of protein binding on the dsDNA structure.

The do_x3dna package extends the efficient and straightforward
application of the existing 3DNA package to MD simulations. Note
that the Curves—l— package contains a program ‘CANAL’, which was
specifically developed for analyzing data obtained from MD
simulations. However, this package uses AMBER trajectory and
topology files, and generates limited results in text format output
files. do_x3dna can be used directly for GROMACS, and also for
NAMD (Phillips et al., 2005) or AMBER (Case et al., 2005) trajec—
tories after converting them into trr/xtc or PDB format. A PDB file
can be used instead of a GROMACS tpr file.

A major advantage of using the do_x3dna is the availability of the
Python module dnaMD, which provides ample ﬂexibility in direct
analyses of large and complex raw data. The dnaMD module can be
used in a Python script in combination with other mathematical mod—
ules such as NumPy or Scipy, to perform rapid mathematical and stat—
istical calculations. The obtained results can be visualized by using the
Matplotlib module as shown in Figure 1C and D (Hunter, 2007) as
described in the tutorials. Moreover, the dnaMD module offers an
additional feature over other available tools, namely analysis of helical
axis bending by calculating either its curvature (Fig. 1B) or tangent
angles using Frenet—Serret formula (Kreyszig, 1991). Overall, the
do_x3dna package offers an efficient and ﬂexible implementation to
quantify and analyze several structural descriptors of dsDNA or
dsRNA during MD simulations.

4 Conclusion

The do_x3dna package allows one to study biological processes that
are mediated by nucleic acids through explicit solvent atomistic MD
simulations. The application range of the dnaMD module could be
further extended by features, such as to calculate the elastic property
of the dsDNA.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Mathematical modeling and optimization have been used
for detecting enzyme targets in human metabolic disorders. Such
optimal drug design methods are generally differentiated as two
stages, identification and decision-making, to find optimal targets.
We developed a unified method named fuzzy equal metabolic adjust-
ment to formulate an optimal enzyme target design problem for drug
discovery. The optimization framework combines the identiﬁcation of
enzyme targets and a decision-making strategy simultaneously.
The objectives of this algorithm include evaluations of the therapeutic
effect of target enzymes, the adverse effects of drugs and the
minimum effective dose (MED).

Results: An existing generalized mass action system model of human
uric acid (UA) metabolism was used to formulate the fuzzy optimiza-
tion method for detecting two types of enzymopathies: hyperuricemia
caused by phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (PRPPS) over-
activity and Lesch—Nyhan syndrome. The fuzzy objectives were
set so that the concentrations of the metabolites were as close as
possible to the healthy levels. The target design included a diet control
of ribose—5-phospahate (R5P). The diet control of R5P served as an
extra remedy to reduce phosphate uptake entering the purine meta-
bolic pathway, so that we could obtain a more satisfactory treatment
than obtained for those without a diet control. Moreover, enhancing
UA excretion resulted in an effective treatment of hyperuricemia
caused by PRPPS overactivity. This result correlates with using pro-
benecid and benbromazone, which are uricosuric agents present in
current clinical medications. By contrast, the Lesch—Nyhan syndrome
required at least three enzyme targets to cure hyperuricemia.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the most potentially valuable approaches used to accel-
erate the development of new drugs is through the simulation of
human metabolic disorders. Simulations involve the construction
of mathematical models that integrate genomic, proteomic and
metabolic information (Cascante et al., 2002; Kell, 2006; Leung
et al., 2013; Materi and Wishart, 2007; Voit, 2002). In mathem-
atical models, parameters are manipulated to identify biomedical
systems that have defective enzymes, and mathematical

optimization methods are then applied to correct those systems
(Banga, 2008; Sams-Dodd, 2006; Vera et al., 2010).

One of the genetic causes of hyperuricemia is a functional
defect in phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (PRPPS),
which provokes an increase in the activity of this enzyme and
promotes the metabolic ﬂux yielding uric acid (UA; Scriver et al.,
1989). Another instance of hyperuricemia is caused by a deﬁ-
ciency of the activity of hypoxanthine—guanine phosphoribosyl-
transferase (HGPRT), leading to Lesch—Nyhan disease (Lesch
and Nyhan, 1964). Patients with hyperuricemia are at risk of
nephropathy, urinary tract stone disease, gouty arthritis and
tophaceous deposits. In addition, those with the Lesch—Nyhan
disease also exhibit neurological symptoms and self-mutilating
behavior. The oxypurines hypoxanthine and xanthine (XA)
accumulate in HGPRT deﬁciency. These oxypurines are thought
to contribute to the pathogenesis of the neurological symptoms
of Lesch—Nyhan disease because of their cytopathic effects
(Palmour et al., 1989). The current treatment of hyperuricemia
usually includes a symptomatic treatment for joint pain, a
restricted diet in which foods with high purine concentrations
are limited, and the prescription of medications, such as urico-
suric agents and XA oxidase inhibitors, that increase the excre-
tion of UA in the urine and block UA production, respectively
(Schlesinger, 2010).

The development of a new drug is a high-risk and costly
activity involving multi-criteria decision making and trade-offs.
In a model-based approach, systems biological data and
optimization technologies are integrated to surmount these
drawbacks (Guillen—Gosalbez and Sorribas, 2009; Leung et al.,
2013; Li et al., 2011; Materi and Wishart, 2007; Stone et al.,
2010). The optimization program for drug design (OPDD) is a
two-stage procedure used to identify enzyme targets for remedy-
ing hyperuricemia W era et al., 2007), which is caused by PRPPS
overactivity in the purine metabolic pathway. The ﬁrst stage of
the OPDD is to enumerate each enzyme to identify a set of
candidate enzyme targets that minimize the difference between
a high concentration of UA and its healthy levels. The purine
metabolic pathway was originally expressed using a generalized
mass action (GMA) model (Curto et al., 1998). The GMA model
was first transformed into an S-system model, so that the OPDD
can be applied to a linear programming method in solving the
drug target design problem to obtain a set of candidate enzyme
targets. The second stage of the OPDD is a posterior decision-
making determining a satisfactory target from the candidate
enzyme targets. Three objectives, therapeutic effect, adverse
effect and low dose, are considered to make the decision. The
therapeutic effect objective consists of ensuring that each

candidate enzyme target is able to return the concentration
of UA to <105% of the healthy levels. The adverse effect
objective consists of ensuring that the least-square error between
the remedied metabolite concentration and its corresponding
healthy levels is small. Furthermore, the drug dose objective
is based on the fact that higher enzyme activities imply using a
lower dose of drugs, and low drug doses minimize adverse
effects.

In this study, we introduce a fuzzy multi-objective optimiza-
tion approach to formulate the enzyme target design problem
for drug discovery. The design problem is a uniﬁed optimization
framework, in which the identiﬁcation of enzyme targets is
combined with multi-criteria decision-making to identify
enzyme targets for curing hyperuricemia caused by PRPPS
overactivity and HGPRT deﬁciency. In this work, we not only
consider the therapeutic effect and adverse effect objectives, but
also the minimum effective dose (MED) to represent the low
dose objective. The MED is deﬁned as the lowest dose level
of a pharmaceutical product that provides a clinically signiﬁcant
response with average efﬁcacy, and that is also signiﬁcantly
superior to the response provided by the placebo (Fillon,
1995). Although fuzzy multi-objective optimization approaches
have been applied to the enzyme intervention problem metabolic
networks of microbe WV u et al., 2011), almost no literature has
so far discussed the approach for evaluating therapeutic effect,
adverse effect and MED, simultaneously, to combine the detec-
tion of candidate enzyme targets and decision-making to select
satisfactory targets.

2 METHODS
2.1 Kinetic model

The dynamics of a metabolic network can be generically governed by a
set of nonlinear differential equations with the following structure:

dX

— = Nv X, a 1

d, ( ) ( )
where X e R” is a vector of the concentrations of metabolites or pools, a E
R’ is a vector of the enzyme levels corresponding to the enzyme activities,
v e R’ is a vector of reaction rates and N e Rm” is the stoichiometric
matrix describing the interconnecting ﬂuxes. The stoichiometric property
of a network is time invariant. Each reaction rate in this study was
expressed based on the power-law function in Equation (2).

n
vk : aknxtgkl
[=1

2 (W55) Hera/c =1,...,r

[=1

(2)

where ak is the rate constant or enzyme activity for the km reaction rate
and gk, are the kinetic orders. The rate constant ak in Equation (2) was
also expressed as a ratio yk of its healthy state ails to easily modulate the
enzyme activity in the following drug discovery problem.

2.2 Fuzzy equal metabolic adjustment problem

As mentioned in the introduction, the OPDD is a two-stage procedure
used to identify enzyme targets for remedying hyperuricemia W era et al.,
2007). We introduce a fuzzy equal metabolic adjustment (FEMA)
problem, which is a uniﬁed optimization framework that combines
the detection of candidate enzyme targets and decision-making to select

satisfactory targets in one framework. The FEMA framework is
described as the following formulation.

The three fuzzy equals in Equation (3) are applied to evaluate therapeutic
effect, adverse effect and MED, simultaneously, combining the detection
of candidate enzyme targets and decision-making to select satisfactory
targets. Fuzzy equal operation, which is different from traditional opti-
mization problems, is applied as an index for evaluating therapeutic
effect, as well as adverse effect and MED, that is used in identifying
enzyme targets to restore the desired metabolite concentrations to their
corresponding healthy levels as close as possible. The second and third
fuzzy equal objectives in Equation (3) serve as the measures for decision
making. In the second objective, the metabolite concentrations are used
to evaluate adverse effects. However, the therapeutic effect set SZTE is
different from the adverse effect set SZAE. In the MED objective of
fuzzy equal objectives, each enzyme activity (i.e. the rate constant of
the GMA model) is assumed to be as close to its healthy level as possible.
The logarithmic expression 17k = ln(yk) of the rate constant ratio yk is
used in the FEMA formulation to modulate the enzyme activity.

Each rate equation shown in Equation (2) was formulated as the
power-law expression. This expression may result in a computational
failure when a concentration approaches zero. We used the exponential
relationship in Equation (4) to prevent this numerical problem. Here, the
logarithmic expression of the healthy enzyme activity is deﬁned as
6:11:15 2 ln(a,:IS). The ﬁrst inequality constraint in Equation (5) is used
to restrict each metabolite concentration within its corresponding lower
and upper bounds. A binary variable zk is embedded in the second in-
equality constraint to determine whether the enzyme target is modulated
or not. The last inequality is used as a control indicator for enumerating
alternative enzyme targets from the FEMA problem. Here, K is the
allowable number of enzymes that can be selected in the modulated set
SZE’” to be modulated, e.g. K: 2 means that we can select two enzymes
from the modulated set. The last inequality in Equation (5) is 5K— 1,
which is used to enumerate alternate enzyme targets. Therefore, the
selected candidate targets at the current iteration should be at least one
enzyme different from the candidate targets obtained in the previous
iterations. The set S2)?” corresponds to the set of candidate enzyme

targets selected in the previous km iterations. Here, N T is the number of
iterations used to solve the FEMA problem.

2.3 Solving strategy

To solve the FEMA problem, we ﬁrst deﬁne a membership function for
each fuzzy equal objective to quantify each corresponding satisfactory
grade. The membership function is described in Equation (6) as a two-
side function:

LB
0, x,- 5 xi

dicL, xiLB S xi S xgwasal, LB

m(xi) : 1, xéwasal, LB : xéwasal, UB 

B
dj‘R, x?“sal’U 5 x,- 5 xl-UB

UB
0: xi 2 xi

The membership function on the left-hand side is a strictly monoton-
ically increasing function dj‘L. In contrast, the right-hand side is a strictly
monotonically decreasing function aﬁ‘R. Sakawa (1993) proposed ﬁve
types of membership functions: linear, exponential, hyperbolic inverse
and piecewise linear functions, to quantify the behavior of fuzzy object-
ives or constraints. For concise illustration of the FEMA problem, the
linear membership function of each fuzzy equal objective is shown in the
Supplementary Additional File 1. Here, xiLB and inB are the lower and
upper bounds of the ith metabolite concentration or enzyme activity pro-
vided by the user. The satisfactory grade or membership function value is
equal to 1 if the corresponding metabolite concentration or enzyme ac-
tivity is between xfmal’LB andx?ml’ U3, and the small lower and upper
bounds are near the basal value xj’m’. The satisfactory grade is 0 if the
metabolite concentration or enzyme activity is beyond its lower or upper
bounds. The satisfactory grade is between 0 and 1 if the metabolite con-
centration or enzyme activity is within its range.

The FEMA problem is used to ﬁnd the metabolite concentrations,
enzyme activities and selection variables that ensure that the fuzzy
equal objectives are as close to their healthy levels as possible. Having
elicited the membership functions for each fuzzy equal objective, the
FEMA problem is then transferred to the maximizing decision problem,

max min{7h'(xi), 711(99): 71147719}
X, r, , 2,7911

where the crisp feasible domain III consists of the kinetic model in
Equation (4) and inequality constraints in Equation (5). The maximizing
decision problem is used to ﬁnd the maximum intersection of the fuzzy
equal objectives. The intersection of the fuzzy equal objectives is con-
ducted according to the minimization operation, which is a discontinuous
function. Thus, the maximizing decision problem can be rewritten as the
equivalent problem to avoid a discontinuous computation.

ni(xi) Z A, ie QCE (7)

The advantage of this approach is that the optimal membership grade
corresponds to the satisfactory level for each objective, and the optimal
decision A represents the overall satisfactory grade (equivalent to the
lower bound) of the problem.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Design conditions

The kinetic model of the purine metabolic pathway described in
Curto et al. (1998) was expressed based on a GMA formulation
consisting of 16 dependent variables, 1 diet control variable

(ribose-5-phospahate, R5P), 1 constant variable (phosphate, Pi)
and 28 independent variables for modulating enzyme activities.
Detailed information regarding this model is included in
Supplementary Additional File 2. The model equations were
accessed from the BioModels Database (Li et al., 2010a, b; Le
Novere et al., 2006). Generally, human hyperuricemia is caused
by either PRPPS overactivity or HGPRT deﬁciency (which is
related to Lesch—Nyhan disease). These two pathologic cases
were considered in this study. In the ﬁrst case, we assumed
that the activity of PRPPS doubled its healthy level 01 era
et al., 2007). In the second case (HGPRT deﬁciency), we
assumed that both rate constants of guanine phosphoribosyl-
transferase (GPRT) and hypoxantine phosphoribosyltransferase
(HPRT) were 1% of their healthy values (Curto et al., 1998).
Using these pathological states, the abnormal UA concentrations
caused by PRPPS-related hyperuricemiain and Lesch—Nyhan
disease were 131.0 and 145.5 uM, respectively. By contrast, the
UA concentration in the healthy state was 100.3 uM.

Considering the therapeutic effect of target enzyme selection,
the upper limit of UA was set as 105% of the healthy-state value.
To prevent neuronal toxicity, the upper limits of hypoxanthine
and XA were set as 120% of the healthy state value. Other me-
tabolites were allowed to vary between 0.5 and 10 times their
normal values. The combination of diet control was also con-
sidered, and we set a constraint for the concentration of R5P to
be between 0.5 and 1.5 times the normal intake concentrations.
The enzyme activities were restricted to be 0.1—2 times their
normal state values. We used various allowable numbers of
enzymes for the F EMA problem to determine optimal enzyme
targets with or without the prescribed diet control. The F EMA
problem can be used to enumerate alternative optimal enzyme
targets; therefore, we performed 10 iterations for each run to
obtain a set of optimal enzyme targets. All optimization prob-
lems were solved using the BONMIN and KNITRO solvers
accessed from GAMS (version 23.8) on a 3.07GHz Intel Core
i7 CPU with 12 GB of RAM.

3.2 Pathological state caused by PRPPS overactivity

We ﬁrst used the therapeutic effect objective only for UA [i.e. the
ﬁrst fuzzy objective in Equation (3)] to identify candidate enzyme
targets, and make a posterior decision to choose treatment tar-
gets. This computation was similar to the two-stage design of the
OPDD. In the ﬁrst stage, the satisfactory grade of the therapeutic
effect objective for each run was ~100%. The next stage involved
computing the membership grade for each metabolite and
enzyme, and choosing the lowest grade (equivalent to minimum
satisfaction) from the set of corresponding grades as the adverse
effect objective and MED objective to choose treatment targets.
The computational satisfaction values between adverse effects
and MED considered without or with prescription of diet control
are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. The color ﬁgures are
shown in Supplementary Additional File 3. In practice, it was
difﬁcult to simultaneously apply both objectives to make a deci-
sion because some targets had a higher membership grade of the
adverse effect objective but accompanying with a lower grade of
the MED objective, or vice-versa.

For one enzyme target without prescription of diet control,

Circles indicate the results obtained from the triple-objective FEMA
problem considered one, two and three enzyme targets without a diet

indicate the corresponding lowest membership grades for adverse effect
objectives and MED objectives computed by using the optimal solutions
obtained from Vera er al. (2007)

were downregulated from 5.27 and 0.949 to 1.83 and 0.297
umolmin_1 kg_1, respectively, to progressively reduce UA for-
mation. As a result, the therapeutic effect objective concerning
UA was nearly 100% satisfactory. However, the adverse effect
objectives for the enzyme targets {den} and {xd} had satisfactory
grades of 78.85 and 18.8%, respectively, and the MED objectives
were 54.1 and 49.6%, respectively (Fig. 1). In contrast, UA
excretion {ua} was upregulated from 8.74 x 10‘5 to 1.57 x 10—4
umolmin_1 kg‘1 to enhance UA secretion. The membership
grades for adverse effect objective and MED objective were
64.1 and 16%, respectively. We also solved the therapeutic
effect objective F EMA problem considered one and two
enzyme targets with prescription diet of R5P. The optimal results
for 10 iterations could achieve 100% the therapeutic effect ob-
jective. However, adverse effect and MED objectives as shown in
Figure 2 are similar to the results obtained by one enzyme target.
For one enzyme target with prescription of diet, 10 different
enzyme targets could be obtained to achieve 100% therapeutic
effect. However, only three enzyme targets were found for the
case of one enzyme target without prescription of diet. The mem-
bership grades for adverse effect objective and MED objective
had similar situations as observed from Figures 1 and 2.

The optimal enzyme targets obtained by the OPDD W era
et al., 2007) were also applied to evaluate the membership
grades for adverse effect objective and MED objective, which
were listed as stars (single enzyme target) and crosses (two
enzyme targets) in Figures 1 and 2 for comparison. The thera-
peutic effect for UA could be 100% achievable if we considered
the ﬁrst objective only, but the adverse effect and MED were
incapable of fulﬁllment simultaneously. Note that the OPDD is
to transform GMA model to the S-system model so that a linear
programming method can be applied to detect enzyme targets.

Fig. 2. Relationship between the lowest membership grades for adverse
effect objectives and MED objectives. The upward-facing triangles indi-
cate the results obtained from the therapeutic effect objective FEMA
problem considered one and two enzyme targets with the diet control
of R5P. Circles indicate the results obtained from the triple-objective
FEMA problem considered one, two and three enzyme targets with the
diet control of R5P. Stars (single enzyme target) and crosses (two enzyme
targets) indicate the corresponding lowest membership grades for adverse
effect objectives and MED objectives computed by using the optimal
solutions obtained from Vera er al. (2007)

As a result, the OPDD can determine an aggregated enzyme
target {mag-maa} due to this linearization transformation.

The triple-objective F EMA problem was then applied to de-
termine the optimal enzyme targets using various requirements
to fulﬁll these objectives simultaneously. The lowest membership
grades between adverse effects and MED for various pairs of
enzyme targets are shown as circles in Figures 1 and 2. Both
grades were nearly identical to the overall satisfaction, except
for the enzyme targets, {ua}, {xd} and {hxd}, because a trade-
off procedure occurred in the triple-objective F EMA problem
that resulted in a compromise. Figure 3 shows the overall satis-
factory grade attained with or without prescribed diet control.
The F EMA problem can be used to enumerate alternative opti-
mal enzyme targets, so that the top three satisfactory grades
among the solutions are depicted. The enzyme targets with a
prescription diet control of R5P had higher than 86% satisfac-
tory grade, and are more satisfactory than those without the
prescription diet control. When there was no prescription diet
control, pyrimidine synthesis {pyr} was upregulated from 1.295
to 1.592 umolmin_1 kg‘1 for two enzyme targets, and to 1.5
umolmin_1 kg‘1 for three enzyme targets, to detour PRPP syn-
thesis in purine metabolism. This effect is similar to the prescrip-
tion diet control of R5P, in which half of uptake entering the
purine metabolic pathway is reduced. As a result, one enzyme
target with the prescription diet control could achieve a higher
satisfaction than those without the prescription diet control.

There are two kinds of drugs, namely allopurinol and urico-
suric agents, used for the present treatment of hyperuricemia
(Schlesinger, 2010). Allopurinol, which acts as an XA oxidase
{xd} inhibitor, inhibits the production of UA (Shoji et al., 2004).
Uricosuric agents, including Benzbromazone, Probenecid and
Sulﬁnpyrazone, increase the excretion of UA {ua}. According

Fig. 3. The overall satisfactory grades for the treatment of hyperuricemia
caused by PRPPS hyperactivity, which were obtained by applying the
triple-objective FEMA problem with or without diet control

to this case study of one enzyme target, we used the therapeutic
effect objective to obtain the enzyme targets {xd} and {ua},
which the objective concerning UA were ~100% satisfactory.
Without diet control, {xd} was downregulated to 0.297 and
{ua} was upregulated to 1.57 x 10‘4 molmin‘1 kgTI. With diet
control, {xd} was downregulated to 0.429 and {ua} was upregu-
lated to 1.52 x 10‘4 molmin‘1 kgTI. This result is compatible
with the clinical treatment guideline that a diet control is recom-
mended to enhance the effect of drugs for hyperuricemia (Choi
et al., 2004).

3.3 Pathological state caused by HGPRT deﬁciency

The pathological state considered in the second case study is
Lesch—Nyhan syndrome, which is a rare inherited disorder
caused by HGPRT deﬁciency, and is produced by mutations
in the HPRT gene located on X chromosome. In this case
study, HGPRT deﬁciency was assumed by

reducing the activity of the enzymes GPRT and HPRT to 1%
so that the abnormal UA concentrations increased to 145.5 uM,
representing a 45% increase from the normal levels.

Figure 4 shows the overall satisfactory grades and optimal
enzyme targets obtained from various F EMA problems con-
sidering different objectives. Although we used a prescription
diet control of R5P, only one enzyme target was unable to
achieve the goal of curing hyperuricemia caused by the
HGPRT deﬁciency. For the triple-objective F EMA problem

with a diet control of R5P, the overall satisfactory grade was
>50% for three or four enzyme targets. The triple-objective
F EMA problem is a uniﬁed optimization framework in which
enzyme target identiﬁcation is combined with decision-making to
choose satisfactory results. The uniﬁed optimization framework
consists of the simultaneous evaluation of therapeutic effect,
adverse effect and MED, so that a compromise among these
effects can be obtained. Figure 5 shows the lowest membership
grades for adverse effects and MED corresponding to various
pairs of enzyme targets. For various pairs of enzyme targets,
both membership grades (circles in Fig. 5) for adverse effects
and MED were nearly identical to the overall satisfaction (Fig.
4a), excluding the enzyme targets {gnuc, ua}.

We also omitted the adverse effect or MED objective and both
objectives of the F EMA problem to investigate the effectiveness
of the study. Figure 4b—d show the overall satisfactory grades
and optimal enzyme targets obtained by applying the bi-objective
and single F EMA problems. The results shown in Figure 4b
correspond to the therapeutic and adverse effect objectives,
which are the ﬁrst and second objectives in Equation (3). For
the four enzyme targets, the overall satisfactory grade was 98%,
representing a substantial increase compared with the triple-ob-
jective problem (Fig. 4a). However, the lowest membership
grades (upward-facing triangles in Fig. 5) for MED were lower
than those obtained by applying the triple-objective problem,
indicating that the enzyme targets required higher doses. By con-
trast, the other bi-objective problem was used to omit the adverse
effect objective. For the three or four enzyme targets, the overall
satisfactory grades were >66%, which were greater than those
obtained by applying the triple-objective problem. The lowest
membership grades (downward-facing triangles in Fig. 5) for
the adverse effects were lower than those obtained by applying
the triple-objective problem. Both satisfactory grades for adverse
effects and MED were considerably low (crosses in Fig. 5), even
though we could obtain therapeutic results with a grade of
~100% (Fig. 4d) by solving the single objective problem.

Finally, we also considered the extreme pathological state
caused by the combination of PRPPS overactivity and
HGPRT deﬁciency, which resulted in a UA concentration
~71% higher than the normal levels. Following similar proced-
ures, we solved the F EMA problems by considering different
objectives to determine the overall satisfactory grades and opti-
mal enzyme targets. The computational results are shown in
Supplementary Additional File 3, and are similar to those re-
ported in previous case studies. However, we were unable to
identify the optimal solution if two enzyme targets were required
because this case study is conducted on the most serious path-
ology. Our results showed that four enzyme targets had a higher
overall satisfactory grade than did three enzyme targets. The
triple-objective F EMA problem consists of the simultaneous
evaluation of therapeutic effect, adverse effects and MED, so
that a compromise among these objectives can be achieved.
The satisfactory grade for the therapeutic objective can be
improved, if one or both of adverse effect and MED objectives
are sacriﬁced in the F EMA problem.

4 DISCUSSION

Many mathematical formulations are available to express reac-
tion rates. Michaelis—Menten rate law is well known in the ﬁeld
of biological systems. Such a model is derived by making quasi
steady-state assumptions for some components. More complex
rate law expressions, such as Hill model, can be derived using
different versions of the quasi steady-state approximation to de-
scribe more complex protein-catalyzed dynamics, such as allo-
steric processes, competitive inhibition and cooperativity.
However, a recasting method (Pozo et al., 2011) can be applied
to transform Michaelis—Menten—based models as a power-law
expression. As a result, the F EMA formulation becomes a
convex optimization problem, which is capable of obtaining a
global optimal solution.

In the ﬁrst case study, the enzyme target {den} was selected
using F EMA in treating hyperuricemia caused by PRPPS over-
activity if one enzyme target was allowable. This enzyme target
was also included among the six candidate enzymes selected by
the OPDD W era et al., 2007). The advantage of the triple ob-
jective F EMA problem is that we could simultaneously obtain
trade-off satisfactory grades of therapeutic effect, adverse effect
and MED objectives. A set of target candidates with higher
therapeutic grades can be obtained in the ﬁrst stage if a two-
stage design approach, such as omitting one or both of adverse
effects and MED objectives, is used in the FEMA problem.
However, membership grades for adverse effect or MED tend
to be considerably low. As a result, it is difﬁcult to make a
decision based on the candidates suggested.

With a diet control, the treatment of hyperuricemia caused by
PRPPS overactivity was effective, which was reﬂected in
enhanced UA excretion {ua} (Fig. 3). Among the current clinical
medications for hyperuricemia, uricosuric agents increase the
excretion of UA in the urine (Schlesinger, 2010). According to
the simulation, the effect of uricosuric agents may be enhanced
with diet control. We found that XA oxidase inhibitor {xd},
which is another clinical medication for hyperuricemia, had an
overall satisfactory grade of 58% (not shown) for the treatment
of hyperuricemia caused by PRPPS overactivity. Other target

Detecting enzyme targets

 

enzymes selected by using F EMA were not covered by the
current medications for hyperuricemia, but they may be good
candidates for new drugs development.

The concentration of UA, the pool of inosine derivatives (HX)
and XA in the healthy state were 100.3, 9.5 and 5.1 uM, respect-
ively. The concentrations of UA, HX and XA in the hyperur-
icemic state caused by PRPPS overactivity were 131.0, 40.3 and
14.8 uM, respectively. The concentrations of UA, HX and XA in
Lesch—Nyhan disease were 145 .4, 69.8 and 22.5 uM, respectively.
A higher concentration of HX and XA has a higher probability
of causing a cytopathic effect (Palmour et al., 1989). Lesch—
Nyhan disease exhibits a higher concentration of HX and XA,
which may explain the neurological effects of this disease Wisser
et al., 2000). The adjustment of enzyme targets identiﬁed by
using the triple-objective F EMA could not only reduce the con-
centration of UA, but also those of HX and XA.

Allopurinol is currently the main drug for hyperuricemia in
patients with Lesch—Nyhan disease (Jinnah et al., 2010).
However, even with optimal medical care, individuals with
Lesch—Nyhan disease typically live into their third or even
forth decade of life and few patients live beyond 40 years
(Neychev and Jinnah, 2006). According to the computational
results, one enzyme target failed to cure hyperuricemia of
Lesch—Nyhan disease. Nevertheless, diet control with four
enzyme targets, namely {ada, dnaa, gnuc, hxd}, reduced the con-
centration of UA, HX and XA from 145.4, 69.8 and 22.5 uM to
102.9, 11.1 and 5.6 uM, respectively. This result indicates that the
combination of multi-enzyme targets may be beneficial to treat
Lesch—Nyhan disease, and points out a direction to develop new
medications.

5 CONCLUSION

We introduce fuzzy programming in which the detection of can-
didate enzyme targets is combined with decision-making strate-
gies to create a uniﬁed optimization framework for determining
satisfactory targets. This optimal enzyme target design problem
is indeed a multi-criteria decision-making problem. A multi-ob-
jective optimization method can be generally applied to find the
Pareto front for this decision problem, and such Pareto solutions
are provided for the designer using his/her biological knowledge
to decide candidate enzyme targets. Almost no literature has so
far discussed the fuzzy equal operation in the F EMA problem to
simultaneously evaluate therapeutic effect, adverse effect and
MED. Furthermore, the membership function deﬁned in fuzzy
programming can be referred to as an index for determining how
to achieve satisfactory levels in the design.

The FEMA approach can also be applied for drug develop-
ment for other metabolic diseases. Using multiple objectives
enables managing various effects, such as therapeutic effects,
adverse effects and MED, and the weighting factor for each
objective in a uniﬁed optimization framework. The objectives
in the F EMA framework can be compromised to obtain a
satisfactory result. Furthermore, the concentrations of metabol-
ites in the human body are not ﬁxed, but ﬂuctuate within
normal ranges. As a result, boundaries for each objective and
constraint are not sharply deﬁned. Fuzzy programming has the
advantage of enabling the management of these ﬂexible
conditions.

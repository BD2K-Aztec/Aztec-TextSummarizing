Abstract

Motivation: Mutations in human genome are mainly through single nucleotide polymorphism,
some of which can affect stability and function of proteins, causing human diseases. Several meth—
ods have been proposed to predict the effect of mutations on protein stability; but most require fea—
tures from experimental structure. Given the fast progress in protein structure prediction, this work
explores the possibility to improve the mutation—induced stability change prediction using low—
resolution structure modeling.

Results: We developed a new method (STRUM) for predicting stability change caused by single—
point mutations. Starting from wild—type sequences, 3D models are constructed by the iterative
threading assembly refinement (l—TASSER) simulations, where physics— and knowledge—based en—
ergy functions are derived on the l—TASSER models and used to train STRUM models through gra—
dient boosting regression. STRUM was assessed by 5—fold cross validation on 3421 experimentally
determined mutations from 150 proteins. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between pre—
dicted and measured changes of Gibbs free—energy gap, AAG, upon mutation reaches 0.79 with a
root—mean—square error 1.2 kcal/mol in the mutation—based cross—validations. The FCC reduces if
separating training and test mutations from non—homologous proteins, which reflects inherent cor—
relations in the current mutation sample. Nevertheless, the results significantly outperform other
state—of—the—art methods, including those built on experimental protein structures. Detailed ana—
lyses show that the most sensitive features in STRUM are the physics—based energy terms on |—
TASSER models and the conservation scores from multiple—threading template alignments.
However, the AAG prediction accuracy has only a marginal dependence on the accuracy of protein
structure models as long as the global fold is correct. These data demonstrate the feasibility to use
low—resolution structure modeling for high—accuracy stability change prediction upon point
mutations.

1 Introduction

Mutation and evolution in the human genome are mainly through
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). With the developments of
high—throughput array—based genotyping methods and the next gen—
eration sequencing technologies, a large volume of SNP data has
been recently accumulated. It is estimated that around 58% of the
exonic SNPs in the human genome can result in change in protein
amino acid sequences, called ‘non—synonymous’ SNP or nsSNP
(Tennessen et 61]., 2012). In many cases, the nsSNP mutations have
little or no discernible effect on protein functions, but others are
known to be responsible for many human diseases (Yates and
Sternberg, 2013). Experimental measurements showed that nearly
one—third of nsSNP mutations are deleterious to human health
(Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009). Recognizing such deleterious nsSNP
mutations is of critical importance to both protein function annota—
tion and disease diagnosis.

In the viewpoint of thermodynamics, the effects of the mutations
can be assessed through changes on the thermal stability of protein
systems. The stability of proteins can be quantitatively characterized
by a simple two—state model (folded and unfolded, Fig. 1), where the
difference in Gibbs free energy between the unfolded (Gu) and the
folded (Gf) states, AG : Gu — Gf, is used to specify the fold stabil—
ity. The higher and more positive AG is, the more stable the protein
is against denaturation. When a mutation occurs, the free energy
landscape and the stability can change, where the free energy gap
difference between wild type (AGm) and mutant protein (AGW),
AAG : AGm — AGW, is a measure of how mutation affects protein
stability. Figure 1 illustrates an example where the mutation destabi—
lized the protein by reducing the free energy gap between folded and
unfolded states. In general, a AAG below zero means that the muta—
tion causes destabilization; otherwise, it induces stabilization.

Although mutagenesis studies are important approach to experi—
mentally characterizing the thermodynamic and physiological effects
of nsSNPs, it is often too expensive and time—consuming for large-
scale mutation studies. Computational mutation prediction becomes
increasingly important with the rapid accumulation of sequence mu—
tation data. Current computational approaches can be generally
categorized into sequence—based and structure—based methods. One
of the most popularly used sequenced—based methods is SIFT, which
predicts whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function
based on the degree of conservation of amino acid residues in mul-
tiple sequence alignments (MSAs) that are derived from closely
related sequences. A Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.55
was obtained by SIFT between the residue conservation and the
number of experimentally determined deleterious mutations (Kumar
et 61]., 2009; Ng and Henikoff, 2001). INPS (Fariselli et al., 2015) is
another sequence—based method recently developed on SVM regres—
sion. By appropriate combination of evolutionary information, a

PCC of 0.52 was obtained by INSP when tested in the protein—level
cross—validations.

Recent studies have demonstrated considerable advantages in ex—
ploiting information of protein 3D structures in the mutation—induced
stability change prediction. For instance, FoldX used a full atomic de—
scription of protein structure to estimate the importance of the inter—
actions contributing to the stability of proteins and protein
complexes, which generated AAG predictions with a correlation 0.73
to the experimental data for 625 single point mutations (Guerois
et 61]., 2002). FoldX was recently exploited by BindProf (Brender and
Zhang, 2015), which shows that it can improve the prediction accur—
acy of mutation effects on protein binding interactions when com-
bined with structure—based interface profiles. I—Mutant trained the
stability models on the neighboring residue types within a 9  radius
sphere and achieved an increase in the correlation of predicted and
measured AAG by 14% compared with the model based on sequence
features alone (Capriotti et 61]., 2005). PoPMuSiC went further to take
the spatial descriptors from the native structure of the wild—type pro—
tein and had the AAG calculated by a linear combination of 13
knowledge—based terms on the protein structure, which resulted in a
correlation of 0.8 between predicted and measured stability changes
after exclusion of 10% outliers (Dehouck et 61]., 2009, 2011).
ProMaya considered a meta—server approach to combine the structure
features with AAG predicted from different programs, which resulted
in improved correlation of 0.79 on the validation datasets (Wainreb
et 61]., 2011). More recently, NeEMO used residue connection net—
works in 3D structure to assess residue stability, achieving a PCC of
0.77 (Giollo et 61]., 2014). mCSM considered a similar idea of distance
maps of vicinity atoms from the wild—type protein structure, which
was combined with the pharmacophore counts to estimate the impact
of mutations and achieved improved correlation over several compet—
ing methods (Pires et 61]., 2014).

Despite the advantage of the structure—based prediction, the ma—
jority of the methods were trained and benchmarked on the experi—
mental structure of the target proteins. Some methods, e.g. ProMaya
(Wainreb et 61]., 2011), require specifically the X—ray crystal structures
as crystallography features such as B—factor are used. However, ex—
perimental structures are often not available for proteins; in fact, only
<0.2% of proteins in the UniProt have a 3D structure in the PDB
library. The lack of experimental structures renders many of the
structure—based methods unfeasible for the practical application.
Given the fast progress in protein structure prediction as witnessed by
the community—wide CASP experiment (Moult et 61]., 2014), here we
explore the possibility to use low—resolution models from non-
homologous structure prediction to improve the mutation—induced
stability change predictions. A new structure modeling approach,
STRUM, is developed to combine various physics—based and
knowledge—based energy terms, built on the I—TASSER predicted mod—
els, with the various sequence and template—based conversation scores
to generate the stability change predictions. To examine the strength
and weakness of the proposed method, multiple datasets are collected
from experimental mutation databases, which will be used to care—
fully benchmark STRUM with other state of the art methods. The on—
line server and standalone package of STRUM are freely available at
http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/STRUI\/U.

2 Methods

2.1 Dataset construction
ProTherm (Kumar et 61]., 2006) is a protein mutation database that

documents experimentally determined thermodynamic parameters

Structure-based prediction of protein stability changes

 

published in the literature. To facilitate the training and testing of
our methods, as well as the comparison to other methods that are
most trained on experimental protein structures, we collected a rep—
resentative dataset from ProTherm (updated on February 22, 2013).
This set contains records from single—point mutations and having
the protein structure experimentally solved in the PDB; it constitutes
3421 mutations involving 150 proteins, called Q3421 set. The WT
sequences of the 150 proteins are listed at http://zhanglab.ccmb.
med.umich.edu/STRUM/benchmark/Sequence.

Because the stability change AAG can be obtained from multiple
measurements at different experimental conditions, we calculated
the average AAG value for each mutation, using a weight scheme
similar to Dehouck et al (2009), in which a higher weight is given to
the AAG value measured at the pH close to 7, temperature close to
25 OC, and with less additives, i.e.

ment, C),- is the concentration of jth additive in the ith experiment,
and C?“ is the maximum concentration for the jth additive.
Figure 2 shows the histogram distribution of AAG in the Q3421
dataset, where 2618 (or 77%) mutations have AAG < 0 and 763
(or 22%) have AAG > 0, which means that the majority of muta—
tions have destabilized the protein fold.

Two other datasets (Dehouck et 61]., 2009) collected from the old
versions of ProTherm were used as well. The first is S2648 that con—
tains 2648 single—point mutations involved in 131 proteins; the se—
cond one, S350, contains 350 mutations in 67 proteins that is a
randomly selected subset of the S2648 database. These two datasets
have often been used in the previous studies, the use of which can fa—
cilitate comparison with other methods.

Since many studies used S2648 as training set, we constructed a
new set, Q306, for more stringent tests, which contains 306 point
mutations from 32 proteins that have a sequence identity < 60% to
any proteins in the S2648. A detailed list of the Q3421 and Q306
datasets with mutation sites, AAG, temperature, and pH values are

2.2 STRUM pipeline and feature design

STRUM is a machine learning—based mutation stability change pre—
dictor that was trained through gradient boosting regression on
three groups of features (see Fig. 3). The first group of 37 features is
derived from sequence composition and MSAs (called ‘sequence—
based’); the second group of five features is from threading template
alignments (or ‘threading—based’); and the last group of 78 features
is built on the I-TASSER full—length structure prediction (or ‘I—
TASSER—based’). A detailed list of all the 120 features is given in
Supplementary Table S1. We first outline the feature extraction
below.

2.2.1 Sequence-based features

Three types of the sequence—based features were derived. The first
type contains 10 physicochemical properties of the wild type
and mutant residues, including the amino acid identity, volume,
weight, hydrophobicity scale and isoelectric point (Supplementary
Table S1).

The second type of sequence—based features is a position spe—
cific conservation score derived from MSAs. Three tools are used
to collect the MSA matrices. The first is from PSI-BLAST (Altschul
et 61]., 1997) search through the NCBI non—redundant sequence
database with three iterations and E—value cutoff 0.001; the second
is from HHblits (Remmert et 61]., 2012) which generates MSAs by
iterative profile—profile based hidden Markov model alignments
through the UniProt sequence database (Bairoch et 61]., 2008); the
third is from SIFT (Ng and Henikoff, 2001) that first uses PSI—
BLAST to search through UniProt database and then has the MSAs
reconstructed by iteratively adding conserved motifs from consen—
sus sequence pairs.

The three MSAs from PSI-BLAST, HHblits and SIFT are com-
bined into a unified matrix according to their alignment on the
query sequence. A position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) is then
constructed by (Altschul et 61]., 1997; Ng and Henikoff, 2001)

tion profile specifying the mutation probability to different amino acids at each position

pseudo—count B,- is calculated by B,- = exp (23:1 mfg“), where 7,, is
the rank of amino acid a in an ordered list from the highest to lowest
score from the substitution matrix BLOSUM62 for the reference
amino acid with the highest frequency at the ith position.

At each position i, the 20 PSSM scores are used as the training
feature of STRUM. In addition, the overall conservation score

20
R,- = log220 + Z Sialongia (5)

a=1

is also used as the training feature (see Table S1).

The third type of sequence—based features is the local structure
features derived from the target sequence. These include secondary
structure prediction by PSSpred (Yan et al., 2013), specified by three
states of coil, helix and strand; solvent accessibility by MUSTER
(Wu and Zhang, 2008 b), and the backbone torsional angle (d), 1,0)
by ANGLOR (Wu and Zhang, 2008a).

2.2.2 Threading template-based features

Starting from the wild—type sequence, multiple template structures are
identified from the PDB library by LOMETS, a meta—server threading
program that consists of 9 locally installed threading algorithms (Wu
and Zhang, 2007). To filter out homologous contaminations, all tem—
plates with a sequence identity above 30% to the target or detectable
by PSI-BLAST with an E—value below 0.05 are excluded from the tem—
plate library. Based on the LOMET alignments, a set of N top tem—
plates is selected to construct the multiple template alignment (MTA)
by mapping the template residues onto the query sequence. Here,
N: 30 for the Easy targets that have at least one significant template

for each threading program; and N = 50 for the rest of the Hard tar—
gets that have fewer or no significant hits.

Five different features are derived from the LOMETS based on
MTA. The first two features describing residue conservations in
threading alignments (listed as wBLSUM and mBLSUM in
Supplementary Table S1) are calculated by

1 N
 =  >< B(A,‘,A,‘i)
i=1

, 1 N ,
5041-): N 1T1" >< MAI-:42)
,2
where A,- and A;- are the wild—type and mutant amino acids at 1th pos—
ition of the query, respectively; A,,- is the amino acid type at 1th pos—
ition of jth template at MTA; and B (A,, A,,-) is the BLOSUM62
mutation matrix as defined in Equation (4). T,- is the weighting fac-
tor of jth template based on the consensus TM—score by

T,- = f 2 TM(/. 1e) (7)

where TM(j, k) is the TM—score between jth and lath LOMETS tem—
plates that is normalized by the length of the query protein (Zhang
and Skolnick, 2004).

The third to fifth features are derived from the normal mode ana—
lysis (NMA) of the LOMETS template structures with the assump—
tion that the mutations with sensitive stability changes can affect the
motion and fluctuation of the target residues. First, full—length back—
bone models are quickly constructed by MODELLER (Sali and
Blundell, 1993) from each LOMETS template for both wild—type

and mutant sequences. The structure models are submitted to Bio3D
(Skjaerven et al., 2014) for NMA based on a ‘C—alpha force field’
derived from fitting to the Amber94 all—atom potential. Features

normal modes between SI,” and Sin. Tl-w’m is similar to what was
defined by Equation (7) but with TM—score calculated between the
MODELLER models.

2.2.3 I-TASSER model-based features

I-TASSER is a hierarchical approach to protein structure prediction,
which constructs full—length models by iteratively reassembling the
structure fragments excised from the threading templates (Roy
et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2015). We use the I—TASSER program to
generate atomic structure models for the wild—type protein sequence.
The structural model for the mutant sequence is reconstructed by
SCWRL4 (Dunbrack and Cohen, 1997) by replacing the side—chain
rotamers according to the mutated amino acids, followed by
atomic—level FG—MD refinement simulations (Zhang et al., 2011).
Again, all homologous templates with sequence identity >30% to
the target or detectable by PSI—BLAST are excluded from the tem-
plate library to avoid homology contaminates.

Three groups of energy potentials are used to evaluate the atomic
interactions based on the wild—type and mutation I—TASSER models.
The first group of energy potentials is the knowledge—based atomic con—
tact potentials by RW/RWplus (Zhang and Zhang, 2010) and Dfire/
deire (Yang and Zhou, 2008; Zhou and Zhou, 2002). Both potentials
are based on the statistics on the PDB structures but with different refer-
ence states. RW/RWplus derives the non—interaction reference state
from an ensemble of random-walk chain conformations, while Dfire/
deire does it from ideal gas states. Meanwhile, RWplus and deire
consider the orientations of local structures involved in contacts while
RW and Dfire are orientation independent. In addition, deire specified
the interactions between hydrogen—bonded atoms (deire1), polar-
nonpolar atoms (deire2), polar—polar atoms (deire3), and the total
energy (deire) (Yang and Zhou, 2008).

The second group of energy potential is physics—based from
AMBER force field (Duan et al., 2003). It contains 18 energy terms
counting for bond—length, bond—angle, dihedral, van der Waals, elec—
trostatic, 1—4 van der Waals, 1—4 electrostatic, polar solvation, non—
polar solvation, total gas phase free energy, total solvation free en—
ergy, and the total energy.

The third group is an empirical force field from FoldX (Guerois
et al., 2002), which consists of 14 empirical terms from the van der
Waals contribution of all atoms, solvation energy for apolar and
polar groups, water bridge hydrogen bonding between water and
protein, intra—molecule hydrogen—bonding, electrostatic contribution
of interactions between charged groups, entropy costs for fixing

main-chain and side—chain atoms in a particular conformation, and
the penalty from atomic steric overlaps.

Each of the energy terms from the three groups is calculated for
both wild—type and mutant proteins, which are used as training fea—
tures in STRUM. These constitute 78 training features used by
STRUM (see bottom of Supplementary Table S1)

2.2.4 Model training through gradient boosting regression

Given the 120 features describe above, the predictive model in STRUM
is built using the Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT), which has
shown to have the advantage to overcome the over—fitting effect com—
pared with many other machine learning methods (Friedman, 2001).
The Scikit—learn toolkit (Pedregosa et al., 2011) is used to implement
the GBRT training, with the hyper parameters tuned through grid—
based search. To further reduce over—fitting, we control the tree size,
and set both the maximum depth (max_deptlo) and the minimum
required number of samples at a leaf (min_samples_leaf) as 3 for each
tree, with the total number of regression trees (n_estimators) being
3000. When looking for the best split at each stage, the number of ran—
domly selected features to consider is set as equal to the square root of
the total number of training features, which aims to enhance the robust—
ness of training against the overcapacity of the base learner. The least
square function is selected as the loss function of regression due to its su—
perior computational properties.

Training features often do not contribute equally to the predic—
tion of the target response. Since individual decision trees intrinsic-
ally perform feature selection by selecting appropriate split points,
the Scikit—learn program uses the number of times of a specific fea—
ture appearing at the split points as the importance, i.e. the more
often a feature is used at the split points of a tree, the more import—
ant that feature is. For decision tree ensembles, the importance of a
specific feature is calculated by the average of the importance scores
of the feature through all the trees (Pedregosa et al., 2011).

It is worth mentioning that GBRT builds the prediction model in
the form of an ensemble of weak decision trees, in which an interior
node represents one feature with edges to the child nodes corresponding
to the possible values of the input features. This protocol allows
STRUM to specify the energy terms from wild—type or mutant as the in—
put features, where the GBRT training can automatically identify the re-
lationship of the difference between the wild—type and mutant energy
terms. We have examined the training process using the separated en—
ergy terms or energy terms from mutation only. It was found that, based
on the same datasets, the model using separated energy training outper—
forms that trained on the mutant energy, with PCC/root mean sequence
error being 0.54/1.25 and 0.45/1.5 8, respectively, for these two models
(definitions seen below).

represent the predicted and experimental values of AAG for the ith mu—
tation, respectively. 1) and 0' thus measure the FCC and the root mean
square error (RMSE) between the model prediction and experiment.

STRUM is tested mainly through a 5 —fold cross validation pro—
cedure in which the experimental mutation sample is randomly div—
ided into 5 subsets of equal size. Four subsets are used to train the
prediction model by GBRT and the remaining subset is used as val—
idation of the model. For each sample, such test is repeated five
times each with a different selection of the training and testing sub—
sets. Since the results often have small fluctuation between the ran—
dom sample splits, the training/testing process was repeated 50
times, with the average values of y and 0' finally reported.

Three types of sample divisions are conducted: the first divides
the mutations regardless what protein they are from, which is called
‘mutation—level’ cross—validation; the second is called ‘protein—level’
that splits the samples based on proteins; the third is ‘position—level’
that divides the samples based on the position of mutation along the
sequence. One purpose for the multiple—level sample divisions is to
eliminate possible bias caused by the correlation between training
and testing samples. In this study, we have confirmed that identical
proteins with different PDB IDs were filtered out in all the datasets.
For protein—level validation, in particular, a sequence identity cutoff
at 60% was applied on Q306 to filter out possible homologies asso—
ciated with the training set (S2648).

3 Results

3.1 Testing STRUM on the 03421 dataset

STRUM was first tested on the Q3421 dataset that contains 3421
experimental mutations from 150 proteins. In Figure 4, we present
the predicted versus experimental AAG in the testing dataset, which
shows a strong correlation with 1) equal to 0.79. The RMSE of the
prediction is 1.2 kcal/mol.

STRUM has used three groups of 120 individual features to dis—
criminate the stability changes on single—mutations. To examine the
sensitivity of different features to the mutation stability, we listed in
Column 4—7 of Supplementary Table S1 the distributions of the fea—
ture values on mutations that stabilize (AAG > 0) and destabilize
(AAG < 0) protein folds in dataset Q3421. Column 8 lists the P-
value of the difference between stabilizing and destabilizing

mutations in the Mann—Whitney test. It is shown that most of the
features (78 out of 120) have the P—value below 0.05, meaning that
we can safely reject the hypothesis that the distributions of the two
datasets are drawn from the same distribution, partly validated the
efficiency of feature selections.

In Figure 5, we show the average importance of the 120 features
and the standard errors that are inferred from the Scikit-learn gradi-
ent boosting regression program. Here the importance of the indi-
vidual features is defined by the average number of the times that
the features are used in the split points of the regression tree. The
most predictive features are the four AMBER energy items, includ-
ing internal potential (Feature no. 63), van der Waals energy (no.
64), electrostatic energy (no. 65) and the total energy (68), on the I—
TASSER models. Meanwhile, the weighted conservation score from
threading template alignments (no. 39) also achieves a similar im-
portance index. These data demonstrated the relevance of structure
modeling based features on the stability prediction.

The highest importance score in the sequence—based features is
from the volume difference between wild—type and mutant amino
acids (no. 3). All the features have a non—zero contribution to the
final modeling. Interestingly, the importance of the features on the
wild—type amino acids is generally lower than that of the features on
the mutant amino acids. In fact, the average importance score for
the mutant amino acid based features is 0.013, which is 433%
higher than the average importance score of the wild—type amino
acid based features (0.003). The P—value of the difference in the
Student’s t—test is 9.5""10—24, which indicates that the difference is
statistically significant. This observation highlights the importance
for the construction of specific features, including sequence profiles
and structural models, from the mutant sequences.

3.2 Comparison of STRUM with other methods on the
$2648, S350 and 0306 datasets

To examine STRUM in control with other methods in the field, we
compare the performance of STRUM with that by four recently de—
veloped, state—of—the—art programs from I—Mutent3.0 (Capriotti
et al., 2008), PoPMuSiC (Dehouck et al., 2011), mCSM (Pires et al.,
2014) and INPS (Fariselli et al., 2015 ). The test is mainly on three
datasets of S2648, S350 and Q306, in which S2648 and S350 have

Structure-based prediction of protein stability changes

 

been widely used in the literature but Q3 06 is a testing dataset newly
constructed. To generate STRUM prediction, we conducted various
multi—fold cross—validations in each of the datasets. The predictions
on other programs are generated by submitting the sequences and
mutations to the webservers provided by the authors. It should be
mentioned that since the server results are not from cross—validation,
part of the testing data might have been included in training sample
of the server models.

3.2.1 Testing result on 52648

Table 1 presents the average results of FCC (y) and RMSE (0') be—
tween predicted and experimental AAG by different programs
(Columns 3—4). Since some servers failed to generate predictions for
specific mutations, we listed in Columns 6—7 the results on the 2484
common mutations that have data by all programs. The 5 —fold
mutation—level cross—validation with 50 loops by STRUM has the
average correlation coefficient 1» = 0.77, which is the highest among
all the programs. Accordingly, the RMSE value of the AAG by
STRUM (0.92 Kcal/mol) is also lower than other predictions. The
P—values in the Wilcoxon test, when comparing the RMSEs of
STRUM with that by different programs, are all below 10_15, mean—
ing that the difference is statistically significant.

Figure 6 presented the regression result on the S2648 dataset from
the 5—fold mutation—level cross validations, where the majority of the
points (75.4%) have the AAG error with in 1.0 Kcal/mol. However,
there are several mutations that have the AAG error larger than 2 Kcal/
mol. The largest error comes from the mutation of H48N in Lysozyme
of bacteriophage lambda (PDB ID: 1am7A). A closer look at the ex—
amples shows that the I—TASSER model of the target protein has an in-
correct fold with a poor TM—score : 0.28. The structure superposition
shows that the mutated residue is completely mis—located on the 3D
fold. The target residue is buried in the native structure, which results
in the destabilized mutation in the native state (AAG < 0). However,
the I-TASSER model misplaced the residue in the surface, which result
in a stabilized mutation prediction with AAG > 0 (see upper—left panel
of Fig. 6). In this figure (lower—right panel), we also present an example
of I-TASSER model with correct fold (TM—score : 0.83) from the
staphylococcal nuclease (PDB ID: 1eyoA), where the predicted AAG is
almost identical to the experimental value. These examples seem to
imply a correlation of I—TASSER models accuracy on the mutation sta—
bility predictions.

The above tests are based on the mutation—level cross validation
in which mutations in training and test sets can come from the same
protein or even the same residue. To have a more comprehensive
test on the impact of protein and residue separations, we conduct

two additional ‘protein—level’ and ‘position—level’ cross—validations,
in which proteins and mutation positions are exclusively either in
the training or testing set. The results are summarized in Table 2, to—
gether with the data taken from two publications that performed the
same tests. It is shown that although STRUM still outperforms the
control methods in these stringent tests, the overall performance is
generally lower than that from the mutation—level validation experi—
ment. More specifically, PCC/RMSE (0.77/0.94) in mutation—level
cross validation are reduced to 0.64/1.14 and 0.54/1.25, respect—
ively, in the position—level and protein—level validations. This reduc—
tion is probably due to the unique distribution of the current
mutation samples, whereas hundreds of mutations can come from a
single protein and the mutation—level cross validation could result in
some level of bias in the testing results, a phenomenon that was also
noted recently by Pires et al. (2014).

their testing set. Similarly, we trained STRUM on the 2298 (:2648—
350) mutations and use the S35 0 as the testing set. Columns 2—3 of
Table 3 present the y and 0' values that we copied from the original
publications; and Columns 4—9 are that obtained from the on-line
servers. The results from most servers are consistent with (or slightly
worse than) the published data. Again, STRUM outperforms the re—
sults on the S35 0 test set with the Wilcoxon test P—values listed in
Column 10, which indicates that the differences are statistically sig—
nificant. It is notable that the P—value here is generally higher than
that in Table 1, which is mainly due to the reduced sample size that
decreases the degree of freedom and therefore the magnitude of
P-values.

3.2.3 Testing result on Q306

Although mutations in S35 0 were excluded from the training set,
training and testing samples may come from the same proteins. In
Table 4, we report the results on the Q306 that contains 306 muta—
tions from 32 proteins that have a sequence identity < 60% to any
proteins in S2648, which STRUM was trained on.

The results on Q306 become worse than the S35 0 set with aver—
age PCC/RMSE 20.40/1.91 compared with 0.79/0.98, which is
probably due to the fact that the mixture of the training and test mu—
tations from homologous proteins is now filtered out completely.
We also listed the results from web server of the three control meth—
ods (—results from PoPMuSiC were not shown because the server
failed to generate a prediction for nearly half of the mutations in
Q306). Although STRUM is in general worse than the S350 set, it
outperforms the control methods again in this new Q306 dataset.
However, the P—value of the difference between STRUM and the
control methods becomes less significant compared with that in
other datasets. One reason is that the sample is relatively smaller,
which can result in fluctuation in performance. Second, the proteins

3.3 Blind test on p53 protein

Cells in human often face dangers. The normal controls on cell
growth may be blocked and the cell will rapidly multiply and grow
into a tumor when the key regulatory elements are damaged. P53 is
probably the most important tumor suppressor protein that regu—
lates cell growth by binding DNA and activating the expression of a
number of down—stream cell—cycle regulation genes. Mutations on
the p5 3 protein—coding genes can result in unnatural growth, which
contributed to nearly half of the human cancers. Most of these mu—
tations are missense that can result in amino acid substitution on
protein sequence. There are 42 single mutations extracted from the
IARC TP53 Database that have been experimentally determined,
none of which appear in the STRUM training dataset. Since this
dataset was collected after STRUM development, we can consider it
as a blind test of the STRUM algorithm.

Table S2 shows the results of AAG predictions by 5 different
methods where STRUM uses the I—TASSER model and the rest of
the methods use the published crystal structure 20C], except for
INPS that is from sequence. It was shown that the stability changes
by STRUM has the second strongest correlation with the experimen-
tally values (y = 0.69), compared with that of other methods,
including INPS (y = 0.71), mCSM (y = 0.67), I—Mutent3.0
(y = 0.57), and PoPMuSiC (y = 0.56). The RMSE of STRUM is the
lowest with 0' = 1.34 Kcal/mol.

3.4 Further examinations on STRUM

STRUM’s performance is partly attributed to the employment of
protein structure prediction and the large—scale feature design col—
lected from multiple resources. Here we examine several relevant

issues related to these attributes.

3.4.1 Are 120 features all needed?

To answer this question, we classify the 120 features into 3 groups.
The first group is sequence—based containing physicochemical prop—
erties plus MSA and local structure predictions; the second includes
physicochemical properties plus threading template—based features;
and the third consists of physicochemical properties plus I-TASSER
model based features (Supplementary Table S3). A protein—level 5—
fold cross—validation test is then performed on each of the feature
groups. The results show a modest level of variations on the final
performance among different feature groups, where the third group
based on I—TASSER models shows slightly better PCC/RMSE (0.49/
1.31) than the other two groups (0.47/1.34 and 0.41/1.41).

Next, we trained the predictor on the top 5, 10, 20, 50 features
selected from each group based on their importance score listed in
Figure 5. In all the groups, the performance gradually increases
when more features are included, demonstrating the necessity of
including more features. Finally, we tried to merge different number
of top features from the three groups for STRUM training. The re-
sult shows again that the performance increases when including
more features (Supplementary Table S4). With the number of fea—
tures increasing to 86, the PCC/RMSE values increase to 0.51/ 1.27,
which are close but still not equal to the level of using the entire
120—feature set (0.54/1.25), suggesting that the most features used in
STRUM are complementary to each other and the inclusion of a
comprehensive feature set is needed to achieve the optimal

performance.

Structure-based prediction of protein stability changes

 

3.4.2 Impact of protein structure quality on STRUM

Examples in Figure 6 have indicated some correlation between
I-TASSER model accuracy and STRUM performance. To have a
quantitative assessment on the impact of protein structure predic—
tion, we re—trained STRUM on the experimental structure from the
PDB. The data in Supplementary Table 85 shows, however, that the
PCC/RMSE values are only marginally improved, from 0.77/0.94 to
0.78/0.92, compared using I—TASSER models. One reason on the
small difference can be attributed to the overall quality of the
I-TASSER modeling. As shown in Figure S1, although homologous
templates were excluded, the majority of the I—TASSER models
(83%) have the correct fold with a TM—score above 0.5 (Xu and
Zhang, 2010).

If we split the protein sample into two subsets with TM—
score >0.5 (109 proteins) and TM—score <05 (23 proteins) respect—
ively, it is shown that there is almost no difference on the perform-
ance of STRUM between using the native and using the I-TASSER
model in the subset of TM—score >0.5, suggesting that a model ac—
curacy of TM—score >0.5 seems sufficient to provide correct spatial
environments for STRUM prediction. However, for the subset with
TM—score <0.5, the incorrect I—TASSER model reduced 1» by 7.5%
and increase 0' by 6.5%, compared with that using the native struc—
ture (Supplementary Table SS), indicating that further improvement
on structure prediction may help improve the stability predictions
for these targets. For the example of mutation of H48N in the
Lysozyme of bacteriophage lambda, STRUM can correctly classify
the case into the destabilized mutation with predicted
AAG : —0.39, if the native structure is used.

In Supplementary Table S6, we present a comparison of the two
sets of proteins trained on the I—TASSER models, where a ‘good pre—
diction’ is defined as those with predicted and experimental AAG hav—
ing the same sign (i.e. both >0 or both <0) and the difference between
the predicted and experimental AAG below 0.1; and a ‘bad prediction’
as those with AAG having opposite sign and the difference above 1.0.
The portion of good predictions (10%) in the proteins of TM—
score >0.5 is slightly higher than that in the protein set of TM—
score <05 (7%). Meanwhile, the portion of bad prediction in the pro-
tein set of TM—score >05 (6%) is slightly lower than the set of TM—
score < 0.5 (9%). This consensus tendency confirms the observation
seen in Supplementary Tables 85, i.e. protein models of better quality
tends to positively impact the performance of STRUM prediction.

Since all above tests have the training and test on the same set of
structure models (i.e. native or predicted), here we performed a new
experiment, in which we first trained STRUM on the native structures
but then compared the test results on the native and I—TASSER models
separately. The training set contains 2225 mutations from 109 pro-
teins with TM—score >05 in the S2648, while the testing set consists
of the rest of the 423 mutations from the 23 proteins with TM-
score <0.5 . The PCC/RMSE based on the native testing dataset (0.47/
1.22) is only slightly better than that on the I—TASSER testing dataset
(0.43/1.27); but the difference is statistically significant (P—value : 5 E-
12), consistent with the observation that the correctness of the protein
fold can impact the AAG prediction results. Meanwhile, it is observed
again that the separation of training and testing data sets on proteins
in this experiment considerably reduce the performance on the test re—
sults, compared with the cross—validation data shown in Table S5,
which confirms the observation by Pires et al (2014).

3.4.3 Impact of NMA features from threading template variations
In STRUM, three normal mode features, defined by Equation (8),
are derived from multiple LOMET threading templates (i.e. 30 for

Easy and 50 for Hard targets). To examine the effect of the NMA
features on STRUM produced by template variations, we tested five
different template sets, including (i) the first template; (ii) 10th tem—
plate; (iii) the last template; (iv) the first 10 templates; (v) the last 10
templates. Supplementary Table S7 lists the correlation coefficients
between the experimental AAG and the NMA features built from
the different template selections. Although the correlations are all
relatively weak (<0.1), there is however an obvious trend that the
higher-rank templates have a better TM—score and tend to have a
slightly higher correlation.

In Supplementary Table S8, we show the performance of
STRUM when replacing the current NMA features with each of the
five sets of template selections. Due to the weak correlation of indi—
vidual features with the AAG data, there is almost no change on the
overall performance of STRUM. However, they are all slightly
worse than the full version STRUM that exploits the entire set of
LOMETS templates (see Table 2).

3.5 Visualization of mutant stability profile and
application on staphylococcal nuclease

If we consider the protein folding and mutation as a thermodynamic
system, the possibility of the occurrence of the mutations should be
proportional to exp(AAG) (Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009). Here we
define a mutability score F,- that describes the total possibility of mu—
tations of the current residue to all other amino acids by

19
F.- = Z eAAGwz-e’m 1o

a=1

where w,- is the wild—type amino acid at 1th position of the sequence,
ma is one of the 19 possible amino acids mutated from L0,, and
AAGwiAma is the predicted free—energy change on the mutation.
Thus, we can introduce a stability profile against mutation that can
be conveniently used for visualizations.

Figure 7 showed an example of the mutability score F,- calculated
for the staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) that is a widely used model
system for mutant study (Carra and Privalov, 1996). There are cur—
rently in total 553 experimentally determined mutations from this
enzyme. The STRUM model using the I—TASSER model generated A
AG prediction with a correlation y = 0.72 and RMSE a : 1.17
Kcal/mol compared with the experimental measurements.

In this profile, the height of each character is proportional to the
possibility of mutation into a corresponding amino acid type from
wild—type residue. If the height of the amino acid is greater than 1, it
means this mutation is favorable which should stabilize the wild—
type protein. Otherwise, the mutation will destabilize the wild—type

the likelihood of a mutation will be produced. This mutation profile

4 Conclusion

Prediction on the SNP mutation—induced stability changes (AAG) is
of critical importance to protein function annotation and human
disease diagnosis. Recent studies have showed advantage for the
methods that use experimental protein structure information to im-
prove the AAG prediction accuracy over the sequence—based
approaches. However, the experimental structure is often unavail—
able to protein sequences, which compromises the usefulness of the
structure—based prediction methods in practical applications.

We developed a new algorithm, STRUM, to explore the possibil-
ity to improve the AAG prediction based on low—resolution models
from the iterative assembly refinement (I-TASSER) simulations, in
which three groups of features from sequence profile, multiple tem—
plate threading, and I—TASSER atomic models are combined
through the gradient boosting regression tree training. The algo-
rithm was tested on a set of 3421 experimentally characterized mu-
tations from 150 proteins. After homologous templates with
sequence identity >30% to the target or detectable by PSI-BLAST
with E—value<0.05 were excluded, I—TASSER was able to build
structure model of correct fold with a TM—score >0.5 for 109 (83%)
proteins. Using the I—TASSER model, STRUM generated AAG pre—
diction for all proteins with a PCC 0.79 and RMSE 1.2 Kcal/mol in
the mutation—level 5—fold cross—validation, compared with the ex—
perimental mutation data. But the performance can be reduced
when tested on the protein—level cross—validation, probably due to
the correlation among mutation samples that are from the same
proteins.

The detailed data analysis showed that the most predictive fea—
tures are those from the physics—based energy terms on the I—
TASSER structural models and the conservation score based on mul—
tiple threading alignments, demonstrating the importance and use—
fulness of the low—resolution structure predictions in the AAG
predictions. Interestingly, features built on the mutated amino acids
are generally more sensitive to the AAG prediction accuracy than
those on the wild—type amino acids. This is understandable consider—
ing the fact that the wild—type amino acids are usually more stable
and adoptable to the protein environments due to the long—term evo—
lution than the new mutations. Thus, compared with the relatively
uniform stability from the wide—type amino acids, the identity of the
mutated amino acids should provide more information with regard
to the stability changes upon new mutations. This insight that the
wild—type amino acids have a uniformly higher stability than the mu-
tant ones is partly supported by the fact that the majority of the mu—
tations in the database destabilize the protein fold (see Fig. 2).

STRUM was also examined in four other datasets (S2648, S35 0,
Q306 and p35) in control with four state of the art algorithms,
including I—Mutent, INPS, mCSM and PoPMuSiC, which have the
web server available for exacting on—line AAG predictions. The re-
sults showed that STRUM based on predicted structural protein
models are comparable with or outperform most of the methods
that are built on the experimental structures. One reason for the
advanced performance by STRUM is probably due to the combin—
ation of multiple complimentary features extracted from a wide
range of resources. The gradient boosting regression training also

helps to improve the robustness of the training procedure by the re—
duction of the over—fitting effect.

Finally, the data results show that the AAG prediction is not sen—
sitive to the accuracy of protein structural models as long as the glo—
bal fold is correct (i.e. with TM—score >0.5). However, when the
target structure model has an incorrect fold, the structure—based AA
G prediction can be obviously degraded, which highlights the im-
portance of further improvement of protein structure prediction for
mutation change modeling, especially for the targets in the ‘twilight
zone’ where the creation of correct fold remains a challenge to most
structure prediction algorithms (Zhang, 2008).

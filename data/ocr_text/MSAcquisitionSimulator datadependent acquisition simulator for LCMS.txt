Abstract

Summary: Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) is the most common method used to control the ac-
quisition process of shotgun proteomics experiments. While novel DDA approaches have been
proposed, their evaluation is made difficult by the need of programmatic control of a mass spec-
trometer. An alternative is in silico analysis, for which suitable software has been unavailable. To
meet this need, we have developed MSAcquisitionSimulator—a collection of C++ programs for
simulating ground truth LC-MS data and the subsequent application of custom DDA algorithms. It
provides an opportunity for researchers to test, refine and evaluate novel DDA algorithms prior to

implementation on a mass spectrometer.

Availability and implementation: The software is freely available from its Github repository http://

1 Introduction

Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique used in proteomics to
identify and quantify proteins. Many of its applications share the
underlying goal of uncovering the full protein complement in a bio-
logical sample. However, for complex samples this is rarely achieved
partly because the number of ion populations exceeds that which
contemporary instruments can individually target for sequence ana-
lysis with a tandem mass spectrum scan (MS/MS) (Michalski et al.,
2011). Acquisition algorithms are necessary to control the data ac-
quisition process and manage the limited scan speed.
Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) constitutes a major class of
data acquisition methods. DDA methods perform a precursor scan to
determine the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and abundance of ions
currently entering the mass spectrometer, followed by sequence

determining MS/MS scans on ions from a subset of detected peaks.
The standard DDA algorithm, TopN, selects ions for MS/MS scans
that contributed to peaks of greatest signal intensity from the latest
precursor scan. Several other approaches, as well as adjustments to
TopN, have been proposed in order to increase peptide and protein
identifications (Graumann et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012; Rudomin
et al., 2009; Scherl et al., 2004; Zerck et al., 2013). However, TopN
continues to be the dominant choice for acquisition control despite its
bias toward abundant proteins and relatively poor reproducibility.
Currently, evaluation of novel acquisition strategies requires ac-
cess to both a mass spectrometer and its application programming
interface (API). Unfortunately, few instrument vendors provide an
API, and therefore the pool of researchers with the necessary tools to
explore this field is extremely limited. An alternative is to evaluate

methods with in silico simulations. Existing simulator software for
mass spectrometry proteomics has focused on generating ground truth
data and realistic signals for precursor and MS/MS scans (Bielow
et al., 2011; Noyce et al., 2013; Schulz-Trieglaff et al., 2008; Smith
et al., 2015). However, the size of the simulations is limited due to
speed, memory and/or disk space requirements. Most importantly,
the simulated MS/MS spectra lead to nearly perfect peptide-spectrum-
matches (PSMs) when analyzed with existing database search algo-
rithms. The reasons for this include the absence of co-fragmentation
from neighboring ions within an isolation window, the difficulty of
predicting fragmentation patterns, and potentially other not yet
understood phenomena. This limitation makes evaluating any acquisi-
tion strategy impractical as the metrics for success are based on the
number of confident peptide and protein identifications.

Here, we present an acquisition simulator that produces PSMs with
realistic peptide sequence and probability assignments for DDA strat-
egies by foregoing fragmentation simulation and instead directly gener-
ating PSMs based on the precursor ion fractions of MS/MS scans. It
builds upon previous work on LC-MS simulations and scales to larger
datasets due to probabilistic models of ion generation and subsequent
pruning of rare ions. This allows for an increased number of proteins,
peptides and post-translational modifications that can be simulated.

2 Methods

MSAcquisitionSimulator consists of three standalone command-line
programs. The first, FASTASampler, assists users in creating a
FASTA file containing the proteins to be included in the simulation.
Users select a protein FASTA file, the distribution of protein abun-
dance and the number of proteins to be sampled. The output con-
tains a random subset of proteins with each header appended with a
‘#’ followed by the protein’s abundance.

Next, GroundTruthSimulator uses the previously created
FASTA file and a configuration file containing simulation param-
eters to simulate digestion, residue modifications, retention time,
chromatographic elution profiles, ionization efficiency and charge
and isotope distributions. It outputs the tab delimited ground truth
data on the generated ions, which will be used for testing acquisition
algorithms. In contrast to previous simulators, there are no limits on
missed cleavages, enzymatic termini or dynamic modifications. A
probabilistic approach is taken instead and rare peptides below a
user-defined threshold are efficiently pruned. Details on the prob-
ability calculations are in the Supplementary methods.

Finally, the AcquisitionSimulator program takes as input the pre-
viously generated ground truth file and another configuration file.
This program simulates a user-defined DDA algorithm on the ground
truth data. It models ion accumulation, precursor scan spectra, scan
time durations and database search PSMs (Supplementary Fig. 51).
Currently, MS/MS fragmentation spectra are not simulated. Instead,
the PSMs are generated by sampling from the list of precursors
isolated in an MS/MS scan and candidate peptides from a database
search. This approach leads to true positives, false positives and re-
verse decoy matches similar to real experiments (Supplementary Figs.
52—54 ). Ion accumulation is simulated by numerically integrating an
ion’s elution profile. Ion transmission rates are not modeled and are
assumed to be 100%. The elapsed time for a scan is equal to the scan
overhead time plus the larger of either the injection time or the transi-
ent time. This models the scan time for a QExactive-like instrument.
The output includes an szL file and a PSM graph file, which is
used as input for the Fido protein inference algorithm (Serang et al.,
2010). Speed and memory usage comparisons with existing simula-
tion software are provided in Supplementary Figure SS.

3 Case study

To demonstrate the utility of MSAcquisitionSimulator, we evaluated
three simple DDA algorithms—TopN, RandomN and WeightedN.
TopN selects the most abundant precursor peaks for MS/MS scans,
RandomN samples from a uniform random distribution of the
observed peaks and WeightedN samples from a random distribution
weighted by observed peak intensity. Dynamic exclusion was enabled,
and precursor scans were de-isotoped prior to MS/MS selection deci-
sions. FASTASampler was executed on the human proteome provided
by UniProtKB using a lognorrnal abundance distribution and 50% of
the proteins, resulting in 45 809 protein sequences. Default configur-
ation files were used with both GroundTruthSimulator and
AcquisitionSimulator. TopN resulted in the greatest number of confi-
dent protein and peptide identiﬁcations, closely followed by
WeightedN, and RandomN provided far fewer protein identifications
(Fig. 1). RandomN’s poor performance stemmed from the challenges
in targeting low abundant ions. The wide MS/MS isolation window of
2 m/z captured neighboring abundant ions and created spectra domi-
nated by peptides whose monoisotopic mass fell outside the small pre-
cursor mass tolerance used to simulate the database search. In
addition, fewer scans were performed due to increased injection time.

4 Conclusion

DDA simulation will assist in the development and assessment of
novel methods. The next generation of algorithms will likely further
integrate data generation with data analysis, such as real-time pep-
tide sequencing and protein inference. They may also become more
goal-oriented, seeking to identify subsets of proteins, specific modifi-
cations or to improve quantification. Their sophistication may also
come at a computational cost too great for their implementation on
contemporary mass spectrometers. For such a scenario,
MSAcquisitionSimulator will be a great tool for their evaluation.

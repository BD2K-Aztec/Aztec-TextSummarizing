ABSTRACT

Summary: Transcription and chromatin regulators, and histone
modifications play essential roles in gene expression regulation.
We have created CistromeMap as a web server to provide a
comprehensive knowledgebase of all of the publicly available ChlP-
Seq and DNase-Seq data in mouse and human. We have also
manually curated metadata to ensure annotation consistency, and
developed a user-friendly display matrix for quick navigation and
retrieval of data for specific factors, cells and papers. Finally, we
provide users with summary statistics of ChlP-Seq and DNase-Seq
studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcription regulators, chromatin regulators and histone
modiﬁcations play key roles in eukaryotic gene transcription
regulation in normal physiology and diseases (Kouzarides, 2007;
Fan et al. , 2010). Here transcription regulators include transcription
factors, transcription initiation complexes, mediator complex and
transcription co-activators/repressors. Chromatin regulators refer to
chromatin-associated factors such as chromatin remodelers, histone
modifying enzymes and other factors associated with speciﬁc
chromosome or nuclear compartments. Mapping the genome-
wide in vivo locations of these factors and marks is important
to understand the mechanisms of transcriptional and epigenetic
regulation. With the development of high-throughput sequencing,
ChIP-Seq and DNase—Seq have become popular techniques to

capture the genome-wide in vivo locations of regulatory factors,
histone modiﬁcations and chromatin accessible regions.

Several data depositories contain the majority of the publicly
available ChIP—Seq and DNase-Seq data. They include SRA (for
raw data) and GEO (for processed data) at NCBI, ENA at EBI,
ENCODE data at UCSC Genome Browser. In addition, some
published datasets are hosted on the authors’ websites. Most of these
data are accompanied with submitter-supplied metadata for each
experiment (Barrett et al., 2009; Barrett et al., 2011; Fingerman
et al., 2011). However, there are many inconsistencies in the
metadata annotation, such as factor naming, cell types and disease
states discrepancies. These make data search and retrieval inefﬁcient
and create challenges for public data reuse.

Several resources, such as nuclear receptor Cistrome (Lanz et al.,
2006; Tang et al., 2011), NCBI Epigenomics (Fingerman et al.,
2011) and thhIP (Chen et al., 2011), have provided annotated
metadata for some ChIP-Seq studies. However, they focused on
speciﬁc subset of ChIP—Seq experiments, and some of their metadata
annotations are also limited. There is a great need to efﬁciently
query all publicly available ChIP-Seq and DNase—Seq data in mouse
and human, as well as an infrastructure for regular update. With a
well-curated knowledgebase and controlled vocabulary for metadata
annotation, users could very quickly ﬁnd all the ChIP—Seq and
DNase-Seq data for a particular factor, all the factors that have been
proﬁled in a particular cell or from a particular study.

In this study, we created the CistromeMap knowledgebase to
ﬁll this gap. It contains manually curated annotations from all
published studies and publicly available data on ChIP—Seq and
DNase-Seq experiments in mouse and human as of September
2011. CistromeMap also has a user-friendly web interface allowing
researchers to quickly ﬁnd and navigate the data. The resource not
only saves experimental labs the time and money from unnecessarily
duplicating an experiment, but also allows them to analyze their own
data in the context of other related public datasets. It also enables
computational labs to more efﬁciently conduct integrative analysis
of all the publicly available data.

2 METHODS

We collected published or public ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq datasets for
mouse and human experiments from public repositories (i.e. GEO, SRA
and ENA), the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap projects, and the
remaining from authors’ website. In total, CistromeMap contains 6474 ChIP-
Seq and DNaes-Seq samples. We systematically annotated the following
metadata for each sample: cell line/population, cell type, tissue origin,
strain (for mouse), disease state, factor name, PubMed ID (for published
data), data source, reference and last author. Based on the original
literature and online information about ofﬁcial gene symbol, cell line
and tissue origin, we created our own ontology for better annotation and
organization.

The CistromeMap user interface (UI) contains three View tabs. The ﬁrst
is a factor View. Users ﬁrst select the factor(s) of interest, and CistromeMap
searches the database for all the cells where a ChIP-Seq has been conducted
for the factor and displays the results in a data matrix. When users click on
speciﬁc entries in the data matrix, the CistromeMap UI displays a summary
View of the ChIP-Seq factor in a speciﬁc cell, such as reference (link to
PubMed entry for published data), lab, data source (link to data download),
species, cell information and disease state. The second tab is a cell View,
where users can get answers to questions such as ‘what factors have been
proﬁled in HeLa?’ The results are displayed in similar format as the factor
View. The third tab is a paper View, where a user could look at all the ChIP-Seq
or DNase-Seq papers by author, title, publication date and journal. When a
user clicks on a particular paper, it also displays information such as author
list, abstract, data source, species and factors proﬁled. To further support
browse function, we developed a built-in text search engine to help users
reﬁne the contents in View tabs. Help document describing all the functions
is available online.

3 RESULTS

In summary, CistromeMap is a comprehensive and consistently
annotated knowledgebase of all published or public ChIP—Seq
and DNase-Seq data in mouse and human. In total, there are
2711 ChIP-Seq datasets for transcription and chromatin regulators,
2355 for histone modiﬁcations and variants, 412 DNase-Seq
and 996 control datasets. Among transcription and chromatin
regulators, POLR2A, CTCF, ESR1, RELA and EP300 are the most
often proﬁled ChIP—Seq factors. For histone marks, H3K4me3,
H3K27me3, H3K4me1, H3K36me3 and H3K9me3 ChIP-Seq are
the most common, which together accounts for over 70% of
all of the histone ChIP-Seq data. In addition, Bernstein, B.E.,
Stamatoyannopoulos, J .A., Snyder, M., Ren, B., Myers, RM. and
Zhao, K. laboratories have generated the highest number of ChIP—
Seq or DNase—Seq data for the community. Interestingly, Nature
Biotechnology and Nature are the top two journals where the
largest number of mouse and human ChIP-Seq or DNase-Seq
studies were published. More details of the above statistics are

available at http://cistr0me.dfci.harvard.edu/pc/dcstats/, and will be
automatically updated as more ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq data
become available.

As the number of published and public ChIP—Seq and DNase-
Seq increases exponentially, we will continue to improve and
maintain the CistromeMap. In addition, we provide ways for the
community to help us update CistromeMap: users can input the
PubMed ID or GEO ID accession to inform us of newly available
data, so we can quickly update the CistromeMap knowledgebase.
Based on the ID, CistromeMap has a function to automatically
retrieve the related metadata from PubMed or GEO. After manual
curation, the new data will be available for release on CistromeMap.
With the joint effort from our laboratory and the community, we
believe that CistromeMap will be a valuable resource for the greater
scientiﬁc community.

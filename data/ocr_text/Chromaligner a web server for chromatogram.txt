ABSTRACT

Summary: Chromaligner is a tool for chromatogram alignment
to align retention time for chromatographic methods coupled
to spectrophotometers such as high performance liquid
chromatography and capillary electrophoresis for metabolomics
works. Chromaligner resolves peak shifts by a constrained
chromatogram alignment. For a collection of chromatograms and
a set of defined peaks, Chromaligner aligns the chromatograms
on defined peaks using correlation warping (COW). Chromaligner
is faster than the original COW algorithm by k2 times, where k is
the number of defined peaks in a chromatogram. It also provides
alignments based on known component peaks to reach the best
results for further chemometric analysis.

1 BACKGROUND

Chromatography is the most important separation technique. With
the improvement of chromatographic technology and chemometric
analysis, there is a growing interest to use the entire chromatogram
to detect differences between pre—classiﬁed sample sets. Fingerprint
analysis (Cianchino et al., 2007) and metabolomics (Nordstrom
et al., 2006) are two rapid growing research ﬁelds that use the
entire chromatogram for authentication of herbal medicine, clinical
diagnostic and evaluation of drug toxicity or efﬁcacy. Most samples
used for ﬁngerprint analysis and metabolomics are composed of a
large number of diverse components and slight retention time shifts
could result in the incorrect detection of differences between pre—
classiﬁed samples. Retention time shifts in chromatograms may be
originated from variation in ﬂow rate, temperature and column aging
of the chromatographic system (Christin et al., 2008). It is important
to correct the retention time shits before chemometric analysis of a
chromatographic data. For the reasonable chemometric analysis with
chromatograms, speciﬁcally the ﬁngerprint analysis of plant extracts
(Cianchino et al., 2007) or metabolomics analysis (Nordstrom et al.,
2006), certain known peaks, as the key chromatogram features,
should be aligned together before any statistical treatment.

Current publicly available tools for chromatogram alignment
such as ChromA (Hoffmann and Stoye, 2009), VIPER (Monroe
et al., 2007) and Metalign (Lommen, 2009) are designed for
chromatographic technique coupled to mass spectrometers. Due to
the high instrumental cost of mass spectrometry, many laboratories
use UV and ﬂuorescence detectors for signal detection. However,
current alignment tools cannot be applied to such data sets.

The two most commonly used alignment algorithms are
correlation optimized warping (COW) (Nielsen et al., 1998; Tomasi
et al., 2004) and dynamic time warping (DTW) (Tomasi et al.,
2004) that focus only on the comprehensive optimal solution
only, and failed on chromatograms with large peak shifts as
commonly seen in capillary electrophoresis (CE). Most alignment
methods are implemented in MATLAB code that is typically
difﬁcult for a wet lab analytical chemist to use. Several algorithms
are implemented as web servers, for example, Tomasi et al.
(2004) provide one employing the COW and DTW functions for
chromatogram alignments. However, users can only compare two
chromatograms with the exact length and less than 2000 data points
at one time. This restriction makes it difﬁcult to align common
chromatogram of 30 min (more than 3000 points) or longer that
are generated by a HPLC or a capillary electrophoresis. Our goal is
to use a constrained chromatogram alignment algorithm to resolve
those issues. Here, we provide a web interface, Chromaligner, for
chromatogram alignment algorithms with constraints using COW.
It can be used to align retention time for chromatographic methods
coupled to spectrophotometers.

2 METHOD

Among the current alignment methods, COW has the advantage of matching
small and large peaks, while preserving their shape but the processing is
typically slow. Chromaligner uses a constrained chromatogram alignment
based on COW to reduce the complexity and the processing time.

Prior to aligning the chromatogram, Chromaligner corrects the baseline
and selects the peaks. The chromatogram is partitioned into walking windows
of 25 s. To determine whether a point is a peak, that point must ﬁrst be the
maximum in a window. Then, the standard deviation of intensities of each
walking window is ranked and the third quartile of the standard deviation is
selected. If the difference of the maximum intensity and minimum intensity
in this walking window exceeds the third quartile, the point is considered a
peak.

To reduce the processing time and to improve accuracy, Chromaligner
uses either user—deﬁned peaks (Fig. 1a) or it automatically selects peaks by
matching UV spectrum from a diode array detector (DAD). If the Pearson’s
correlation of peaks from the UV spectrum between the test and target
chromatograms is >0.98, within 1min, the corresponding peak(s) will be
selected. Chromaligner further divides the chromatograms into segments,

with respect to these peaks (Fig. lb) and then, performs COW on each
segment (Fig. 10).

For a chromatogram of length L, COW and DTW can resolve the
alignment in 0(L2) time through dynamic programming (DP) (Wang et al.,
2005). For Chromaligner, if the number of deﬁned peaks is k, the segment
length to be aligned is reduced to 0(L/k). Therefore, the time complexity for
each segment is reduced to 0(L2/k2). However, COW requires manual tuning
of the section length and the slack number to achieve better alignment. Our
experience showed that the local optimal solution using COW is generally
obtained, while the section length is between 20 and half of L with the
slack number between 1 and 5. By heuristically tuning a chromatogram,
COW needs to tune 0(L) times to achieve the optimal alignment in 0(L3)
time. To completely align a chromato gram, Chromaligner tunes 0(L/k) times
for each segment and continues to align a total of k+1 segments for a
chromatogram; making the time complexity 0(L3/k2). Thus Chromaligner
aligns chromatograms k2 times faster than COW.

By DP nature, both DTW and COW require 0(L2) in space. However,
the size of the DP table in COW is dependent on the section length (Nielsen
et al., 1998). A section length of m results in a DP table size of Lz/m and
reduces the space complexity to 0(L2/m) for COW which is smaller than the
0(L2) of DTW. The space complexity of Chromaligner is 0(L2/k2m) due to
the fact that each segment length L is reduced to L/k.

3 INPUT AND OUTPUT

Chromaligner requires three sets of ﬁles in plain text (tab delimited
with a .txt extension): an index ﬁle, raw data and parameter ﬁles. The
raw data ﬁle must contain retention time to intensity information.
UV spectrum from a DAD can be provided for auto—picking peaks
for Chromaligner. For additional details on the ﬁle format, please
visit the Chromaligner website.

Chromaligner is able to export results in chromatograms. The
aligned ﬁles are transformed into retention time and intensity data for
further chemomatric analysis. Overlaid chromatograms that depict
shifts between the target and sample are also provided.

4 CASE STUDY

The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested
chromatographic ﬁngerprinting for quality evaluation of the herbal
medicines. We applied Chromaligner to chromatograms obtained
from different instruments and herbal extracts. Chromatograms of

Scutellaria were obtained from an HPLC—DAD instrument. Using
the auto—picking function in Chromaligner to select the peaks
of DAD (which is absent from original COW), the correlation
greatly improved to a great extent after alignment. We also
used Chromaligner to analyze a well—known traditional Chinese
medicine and cooking herb, rhubarb (Table 1). The chromatograms
of rhubarb were obtained from a CE—UV instrument. Compared to
COW, Chromaligner provided better alignments within a shorter
execution time. Thus, Chromaligner is an efﬁcient and accurate
tool for chromatogram alignment.

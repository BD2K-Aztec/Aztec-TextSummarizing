ABSTRACT

Motivation: Advances in sequencing technologies and computational
algorithms have enabled the study of genomic variants to dissect their
functional consequence. Despite this unprecedented progress, cur-
rent tools fail to reliably detect and characterize more complex allelic
variants, such as short tandem repeats (STRs). We developed TSSV
as an efficient and sensitive tool to specifically profile all allelic variants
present in targeted loci. Based on its design, requiring only two short
flanking sequences, TSSV can work without the use of a complete
reference sequence to reliably profile highly polymorphic, repetitive or
uncharacterized regions.

Results: We show that TSSV can accurately determine allelic
STR structures in mixtures with 10% representation of minor alleles
or complex mixtures in which a single STR allele is shared.
Furthermore, we show the universal utility of TSSV in two other inde-
pendent studies: characterizing de novo mutations introduced by tran-
scription activator-like effector nucleases (T ALENs) and profiling the
noise and systematic errors in an IonTorrent sequencing experiment.
TSSV complements the existing tools by aiding the study of highly
polymorphic and complex regions and provides a high-resolution
map that can be used in a wide range of applications, from personal
genomics to forensic analysis and clinical diagnostics.

Availability and implementation: We have implemented TSSV as a
Python package that can be installed through the command-line using
pip install TSSV command. Its source code and documentation are
available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tssv and http://www.lgtc.nl/

1 INTRODUCTION

As a consequence of various mechanisms such as DNA recom-
bination, replication and repair-associated processes, the spec-
trum of human genetic variation ranges from single nucleotide

differences to large chromosomal events. Among the different
types of genetic changes, repetitive DNA sequences show more
polymorphism than single nucleotide variants (Conrad et al.,
2010; Hinds et al., 2006; Iafrate et al., 2004; Kidd et al., 2008;
Redon et al., 2006; Sebat et al., 2004; Tuzun et al., 2005), and
they are important in human diseases (Conrad et al., 2010;
de Cid et al., 2009; Girirajan et al., 2011; Hollox et al., 2008;
McCarroll et al., 2009; Pinto et al., 2010), complex traits and
evolution (Mills et al., 2011; Stephens et al., 2011; Sudmant et al.,
2010). In particular, microsatellite variants, also known as short
tandem repeats (STR), and their expansion/ shortening have been
linked to a variety of human genetic disorders (Mirkin, 2007;
Pearson et al., 2005; Sutherland and Richards, 1995), and have
been used in genotyping (Kimura et al., 2009; Weber and May,
1989) and forensic DNA fingerprinting studies (Kayser and de
Knijff, 2011; Moretti et al., 2001).

Because of the repetitive nature of STRs and often the low
level of complexity of the DNA sequences in which they occur
(Treangen and Salzberg, 2012), characterization of STR variabil-
ity and understanding of their functional consequences are
challenging ONeischenfeldt et al., 2013). So far, sequencing-
based strategies have focused on reads mapped to the reference
genome and subsequent identification of discordant signatures
and classiﬁcation of associated STRs (Medvedev et al., 2009;
Mills et al., 2011). Yet, the mainstream aligners, such as BWA
(Li and Durbin, 2009) or Bowtie (Langmead and Salzberg,
2012), do not tolerate repeats or insertions and deletions
(indels) as a trade-off of run time (Li and Homer, 2010). This
limitation leads to ambiguities in the alignment or assembly of
repeats which, in turn, can obscure the interpretation of results
(Treangen and Salzberg, 2012). Moreover, the current human
genome reference still remains incomplete and provides only
limited information on expected and potentially uncharacterized
STR3 in different individuals (Alkan et al., 2011; Iafrate et al.,
2004; Kidd et al., 2008; Sebat et al., 2004). Consequently, STRs
are not routinely analyzed in whole-genome or whole-exome
sequencing studies, despite their obvious applications and their
role in human diseases, complex traits and evolution.

Here, we present a method for targeted profiling of STRs that
reports a full spectrum of all observed genomic variants along
with their respective abundance. Our tool, TSSV, can accurately

proﬁle and characterize STRs without the use of a complete
reference genome, and therefore minimizes biases introduced
during the alignment and downstream analysis. TSSV scans
sequencing data for reads that fully or partially encompass loci
of interest based on the detection of unique ﬂanking sequences.
Subsequently, TSSV characterizes the sequence between a pair of
non-repetitive ﬂanking regions and reports statistics on known
and novel alleles for each locus of interest. We show the perform-
ance of TSSV on robust characterization of all allelic variants in
a given targeted locus by its application in several case studies:
forensic DNA ﬁngerprinting of mixed samples by STR proﬁling,
characterization of variants introduced by transcription activa-
tor-like effector nucleases (TALENs) in embryonic stem (ES)
cells and detailed characterization of errors derived from a
next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiment.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 TSSV algorithm

The algorithm expects a FASTA ﬁle containing sequencing data and a
library containing a list of loci of interest that are described by two unique
sequences ﬂanking a target locus in the form of a simple regular expres-
sion. The description of targeted loci consists of a series of triplets
(i.e. CTTA 2 5), each containing a sequence followed by two integers
that denote the minimum and maximum number of times the preceding
sequence is expected. The notation of expected alleles is then compiled
into a regular expression that is used to distinguish between known and
new alleles. It is important that a library that contains a description of
loci of interest according to the aforementioned instruction should be
customized and provided. TSSV reports an overview of marker pair
alignments and a detailed description of the identiﬁed alleles and their
respective frequency per strand. TSSV also provides supporting reads of
each locus of interest in separate FASTA ﬁles.

TSSV is an open source Python package that can be easily incorpo-
rated in any standard NGS pipeline. In addition, we have made the
Python package fastools available at htips://pypi.pyth0n.org/pypiﬂastools.
fastools offers a series of functions to manipulate, characterize, sanitize
and convert FASTQ/FASTA ﬁles to other formats. Therefore, it can be
used to convert FASTQ ﬁles to TSSV desired format (FASTA). For
further information on usage and generated data see Supplementary
Table S1.

2.1.] Marker alignment Each pair of markers (unique ﬂanking
sequences) is aligned to the reads by using a semi-global pairwise align-
ment, a modiﬁed version of the Smith—Waterman algorithm (Smith and
Waterman, 1981). The alignment matrix is initialized with penalties only
for the aligned sequence and not for the reference sequence. By using this
approach, we can use the alignment matrix to calculate the edit distance
between the aligned sequence and all substrings of the reference sequence.
Finally, TSSV uses the alignment matrix to select the rightmost alignment
with a minimum edit distance. To guarantee symmetry with regard to
reverse complement sequences, TSSV aligns the reverse complement of
the right marker to the reverse complement of the reference sequence.

2.1.2 Allele identificatiOn Once TSSV successfully aligns a marker
pair to either the forward or the reverse complement of the reference
sequence, the region of interest is selected by extracting the sequence
between the alignment coordinates, which is then converted to the for-
ward orientation. The target variable sequence is then matched to the
regular expression of the corresponding marker pair for classiﬁcation as
either a known or a new allele. In case of partial identiﬁcation of markers
(i.e. only the left or right marker of the pair is identiﬁed), the input

sequence is ﬂagged as having either no beginning or no end. The assess-
ment of required runtime for TSSV to identify alleles in datasets with
different sequencing depth is provided in Supplementary Figure S1. Each
dataset is proﬁled to characterize 16 allelic STR structures. It should be
noted that currently TSSV uses a single processor for the analysis.

2.1.3 AnnotatiOnS Once a list of new alleles is constructed, TSSV uses
a revised version of the Mutalyzer online service (W ildeman et al., 2008;
httpS://mutalyzer.nl) to describe all observed variants compared with the
reference sequence. Mutalyzer provides a description of observed variants
according to the Human Genome Variation Society format for sequence
variant description. This can be used to provide an overview of most
frequent mutations that are observed within each locus of interest.

2.1.4 InterpretatiOn guidelines TSSV provides the frequency in which
each allelic structure is observed on plus and minus strand. Based on the
experimental design, the frequencies of allelic variants and the balance
between supporting reads on the plus and minus strand can aid the iden-
tiﬁcation of potential sequencing biases. Moreover, based on the choice of
sequencing technology, homopolymers are prone to introducing artiﬁcial
allelic structures, so it is advised, when possible, to allow for a tolerance of
a few base difference in the homopolymer length while describing targeted
loci. The estimation of a lower boundary for the identiﬁcation of variant
alleles is subject to the experimental design. Thus, sequencing of control
samples, if possible, can aid a more reliable analysis by ruling out potential
slippage and background noise.

2.1.5 Availability TSSV is available at http://www.lgtc.nl/tssv and
https://pypi.pyth0n.0rg/pypi/tssv. It can also be installed through the com-
mand line: pip install tssv. All original datasets and the analysis results can
be obtained from ﬁgshare (http://wwwﬁgsharecom): detection of STRs,
SNPs and short indels (Anvar, 2013a), determining de novo structural
variations (SVs) in TALEN-treated ES cells (Anvar, 2013b), character-
ization of STRs (Anvar, 2013c) and detection of systematic errors in
PGM (Anvar, 2013c).

2.2 Library preparations and sequencing

STR PCR products for sequencing were generated using the P0werplex®
I 6-kit from Promega (commercial assay designed and optimized for ﬂuor-
escent dye-based fragment analysis of STR loci) and were puriﬁed with
Ampure XP beads according to manufacturer’s protocol. Library prep-
aration was performed using the Rapid Library Preparation Kit (Roche).
Emulsion PCR and sequencing were performed on the FLX Genome
Sequencer (454/Roche) according to the protocol provided by the
manufacturer.

PCR products for sequencing of all other samples on the Personal
Genome Machine (PGM, IonTorrent) were prepared using the Ion
Plus Fragment Library Kit or amplicon fusion primers. Emulsion PCR
was performed using the OneTouch (0T1, IonTorrent). Sequencing was
performed according to LifeTech protocol using the Ion PGMTM 200
Sequencing Kit. PCR reaction was done in 10 ul containing 1X
FastStart High Fidelity reaction buffer (Roche), 1.8 mM MgC12, 2%
DMSO, 200 uM dNTPs, 0.5U FastStart High Fidelity Enzyme Blend
(Roche), 20 ng DNA, 300 nM universal barcoding primer, 300 nM reverse
target primer and 30 nM forward target primer. After 10min of initial
denaturation at 95°C, 30 PCR cycles were performed at 20s 95°C, 30s
60°C and 40s 72°C. Primer sequences are provided in Supplementary
Table S2.

2.3 TALEN design and transfection

The TALENs -pair targeting intron 52 of the human DMD gene (hDMD)
was designed using the TALEN toolbox described by Cermak et a].
(2011). Next, hDMD/mdx ES cells (t Hoen et al., 2008; Veltrop et al.,
2013) were transfected with the TALENs plasmids without any

homologous recombination vector. ES cells were routinely cultured on
murine embryonic ﬁbroblast (MEF) feeder cells in knockout DMEM
supplemented with 2mM L-glutamine, 1mM sodium pyruvate, non-
essential amino acids, 50 units of penicillin as well as streptomycin,
1000 units of leukemia inhibitory factor and 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS Gold, all from Life Technologies Ltd). Per TALEN, total of
750 ng in 1.5 ug of DNA was used to transfect 1000 000 hDMD/mdx
ES cells using Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen). DNA-Lipofectamin
2000 suspension was prepared in serum and antibiotic-free medium ac-
cording to the supplier’s manual Cells were incubated for 30 min in sus-
pension with the DNA-Lipofectamine mixture and then plated in two
9 cm culture dishes coated with MEF in regular ES culture medium. ES
cells were cultured for a week, and DNA was isolated from a pool of 1500
ES clones. This DNA was then prepared for sequencing using IonTorrent
PGM according to the instrument guidelines.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Characterization of STRs

We tested the performance of TSSV in characterizing known
STRs from Roche/454 targeted sequencing data of 16 STR
loci, ampliﬁed in a multiplex reaction. To demonstrate the
added value of TSSV over mainstream aligners, we generated
four sequencing libraries of which two consisted of pure individ-
ual samples and two mixtures in the ratios of 50:50 and 90:10
with comparable depth of coverage (Supplementary Table S3).
A full spectrum of STR structures and their abundance was
generated after a semi-global alignment of the 25 bp ﬂanking
regions adjacent to the STR structure, with tolerance of up to
three mismatches (Fig. 1A). On average, 8% of reads remained
uncharacterized, mostly because the sequences did not cover
both ﬂanking reference sequences or that sequences contained
too many mismatches for regions that are required for identiﬁ-
cation of unique ﬂanking reference sequences (Supplementary
Table S3). The PCR product used for preparing the sequencing
libraries were generated using the Powerplex I6—kit from
Promega, which is an assay designed and optimized for ﬂuores-
cent dye-based fragment analysis of STR loci. This resulted in a
strong imbalance in sequencing yield between STR markers with
different dyes in the fragment analysis (Supplementary Table S3).
Thus, we restricted the analysis to the three markers with highest
coverage (D3Sl358, TH01 and D13S317). Frequencies of the
observed alleles were interpreted to distinguish actual alleles
from slippage artifacts (Supplementary Tables S4—S6).

For D3Sl358 (TCTAITCTGHTCTAQLB), TSSV robustly
identiﬁed the STR structure associated with each of the samples,
with >91% of reads supporting the presence of two STR alleles
(Fig. 1B). In addition, TSSV could pick up a minor frequency
(7.25%) for alternative STR structures, in which the DNA
amplicons show false STR structures because of DNA polymer-
ase slippage during the ampliﬁcation (Ellegren, 2004; Hauge and
Litt, 1993). Despite the presence of PCR ampliﬁcation artifacts,
the major and minor STR structures in balanced and more ex-
treme mixtures (50:50 and 90:10, respectively) could accurately
be identiﬁed by TSSV (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S4).

We next explored whether TSSV can correctly detect alleles
of more complex cases differing based on STR length
(ATCT12ATCA2 and ATCT11ATCA3) or composition (CATT9
and CATT3CAT1CATT6) as well as mixtures that shared one

allelic STR structure (CATT3CAT1CATT6). Markedly, TSSV
could correctly detect, characterize and quantify reads support-
ing all STR alleles, including mixtures with only 10% represen-
tation of the minor alleles (i.e. D3Sl358 markers) and
more complex mixtures (TH01 markers) where a single STR
allele is shared (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Tables S4—S6 and
Supplementary Figs S2—S4). Results of the remaining STR mar-
kers are provided in supplementary materials, Supplementary
Tables S7—S17.

3.2 Determining de novo structural variations in
TALEN-treated cells

TALENs have shown promising potential in site-speciﬁc genome
editing (Boch, 2011; Cermak et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2011;
Zhang et al., 2011). Their modular structure enables simple con-
struction of TALENs that can speciﬁcally recognize virtually any
DNA sequence of interest. On delivery of a TALENs-pair, a
double strand break is introduced that is repaired by non-
homologous end-joining, introducing a large variety of

TALEN-treated (red) and Control ES Cells (black). Kolmogorov—
Smirnov test was performed to assess if two distributions are signiﬁcantly
different

mutations (Supplementary Fig. S5). Because the method lacks a
positive selection procedure, the applicability depends largely on
its efﬁcacy. We used TSSV to estimate the efﬁciency of genome
editing in ES cells from a mouse model with the hDMD, stably
integrated in the mouse genome (t Hoen et al., 2008), and deter-
mine the utility of an assembled TALEN pair (Supplementary
Table S18) in introducing mutations within targeted intron 52 of
the hDMD (Supplementary Fig. S6).

For 100 000 TALENs-transfected and non-transfected (con-
trol) ES cells, a 135 bp fragment encompassing the entire targeted
locus was PCR ampliﬁed and sequenced using the IonTorrent
PGM (Supplementary Table S19). The targeted locus was cov-
ered over 450 000 times, which allows for precise detection and
characterization of any variant present. From the control ES
cells, we determined a background of 3.1% of reads that contain
at least one mismatch, derived from sequencing errors and po-
tential spontaneous mutations (Fig. 2A and Supplementary
Table S19). In TALENs-treated ES cells, the rate of sequencing
reads that contain at least one mismatch was 11.4%, almost
4-fold higher than controls (Fig. 2A). The majority of mutations

introduced by TALENs pair were small insertions and deletions
(75.6%; excluding duplications) (Fig. 2B), which is consistent
with the expected type of variants introduced by TALENs
(Cermak et al., 2011). The frequency in which individual variants
occurred was speciﬁc to TALEN-treated ES cells, even for those
that were observed with very low frequency (Fig. 2C and D).
However, we observed a few mutations that were not speciﬁc to
TALEN-treated ES cells (Fig. 2D). These were mainly duplica-
tions that arose from inaccurate detection of homopolymer
stretches. Overall, TSSV results indicate signiﬁcant enrichment
(P:2.85E-09; Kolmogorov—Smirnov test) of variants in
TALEN-treated ES cells as compared with controls (Fig. 2E).
Furthermore, TSSV reported a list of the most frequent variants
and cleavage sites, majority of which were either exclusive to
TALEN-treated ES cells or with over 3-fold higher frequency
in TALEN-treated ES cells than controls (Supplementary
Fig. S7). The IonTorrent variant caller (version 3.2) did not
report any variant because of the nature and frequency of vari-
ants introduced by TALENs.

3.3 Detection of systematic errors in PGM IonTorrent

During the targeted IonTorrent resequencing of exon 19 of the
DMD gene (X-chromosome) in ﬁve male patients and a female
carrier, we observed a number of shared and unexplained het-
erozygous variants given that male patients have only one
X-chromosome and DMD gene does not locate within pseudo-
autosomal regions. We used TSSV to provide a high-resolution
map of all sequence variants as a way to understand the origin of
these artifacts (Fig. 3A). To assess the reproducibility of our
ﬁndings, we performed two independent IonTorrent PGM

Fig. 4. Comparative analysis of observed mutations. (A) The total
number of occurrences for variants to be observed on plus or minus
strands is compared. Data points are colored based on the variation
type. (B) Zoomed in scatter plot for variants with strand-speciﬁc fre-
quency <500. (C) Sequencing data from the same sequencing run
(PG090) are assessed for frequency of observed variants after the use of
two different versions of base-calling algorithm. (D) Zoomed in scatter
plot for variants with frequency <500 compared between two datasets
generated using different base-caller algorithms

sequencing runs (PG090 and PG109). Two different versions
of the IonTorrent base-calling algorithm were used for PG090
(versions 2.2 and 3.0) while PG109 was only processed by version
3.0 (sequencing run was carried out after the upgrade of the
IonTorrent Suit). The three datasets enabled us to investigate
potential artifacts derived from sequencing and/or different
base-calling algorithms. Our ﬁrst observation indicated a signiﬁ-
cant decrease in the total number of reads (average of 11.3 and
13.3% in respective to different runs and base-calling algorithms)
that were recognized per individual (Supplementary Table S20).
We also noticed a signiﬁcant difference in the fraction of reads
per dataset (44.3, 40.3 and 48.7%) that were reported as new
alleles, having at least one mismatch with the reference sequence
(Fig. 3B).

We observed a signiﬁcant reduction of variants (36.2%) after
adoption of the version 3.0 base-caller, mainly affecting the level
of deletions and duplications calls (Fig. 3C). This prominent
decrease (68.3 and 48.9%) arises from improvement of the algo-
rithm in determining the length of homopolymer stretches.
Notably, the majority of other variants were single nucleotide
insertions (excluding duplications and indels) that remained at
a comparable rate across different datasets (Fig. 3C). Next, we
assessed the strand speciﬁcity of the variants based on the
sequencing direction. Interestingly, while the majority of variants
showed a similar frequency in both directions, the most frequent
variants showed a clear imbalance between forward and reverse
strand (Fig. 4A and B). The observed strand-speciﬁc bias was

reproducible and was not inﬂuenced by the software version, as
it was observed in all three datasets (Fig. 4C and D and
Supplementary Figs S8—Sl 1).

To study the possible nucleotide-speciﬁc biases, we quantiﬁed
the frequency of all calls that predominantly occurred on one
strand. Despite slight variation, substitutions were observed on
both strands at a comparable rate. However, in each dataset, the
majority of substituted bases were ‘A’s (59.2, 61.3 and 64.9%)
and ‘T’s (28.1, 23.0 and 20.5%) that were predominantly sub-
stituted to ‘G’ and ‘C’, respectively (Fig. 5A). Insertions were
primarily observed on the forward strand (94%, on average)
while ‘A’ remained as the most affected base (77.7%, on average)
across all samples (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Figs S9—S1 1).

We also observed a slight enrichment of deletions and dupli-
cations on the reverse strand that were more pronounced in
PG109-02 (Fig. 5C and D). Consistently, the most affected
base was ‘A’, which was mainly the result of under- or over-
calling of ‘A’ homopolymers. We used TSSV to report a list of
most occurring variants across different samples. A single ‘A’
nucleotide insertion at cycle 52 was by far the most predominant
variant that occurred exclusively on the forward strand
(Fig. 6A). In fact, irrespective of co-occurrence of this insertion
with any other variants, the new observed sequence remains
strand speciﬁc (Fig. 6A). This cannot be explained from a bio-
logical standpoint and can only arise from a sequencing error.
Moreover, we did not observe any variation after sequencing the
same library with Sanger sequencing (Fig. 6B), ruling out the
possibility of artifacts introduced by sample preparation and
PCR ampliﬁcation.

3.4 Comparative analysis of TSSV performance

To our knowledge, lobSTR (Gymrek et al., 2012), STRait Razor
(VVarshauer et al., 2013) and RepeatSeq (Highnam et al., 2013)
are currently the most recent and frequently used STR proﬁling
tools. STRait Razor has limited functionality and only provides
an estimated copy number of major STR units. Therefore, we
could only compare the performance of TSSV only with lobSTR
and RepeatSeq. As lobSTR relies on alignment of sequencing
reads to the predeﬁned and indexed STR reference sequences,
lobSTR outperformed TSSV in recognizing partial reads, con-
taining only one of the two ﬂanking sites required by TSSV
(Supplementary Table S21). Concordantly, lobSTR accepted
1288 reads for the D3Sl357 STR locus that were not reported
by TSSV. However, TSSV performed signiﬁcantly better on
more complex STR loci (Supplementary Tables S21—S22).
Across all four datasets, TSSV identiﬁed on average 2471 and
2353 reads in excess of what was recognized by lobSTR for the
D13S317 and TH01 STR loci, respectively. This difference is
mainly derived from increasingly problematic alignments in
lobSTR that is also reﬂected in inaccurate estimation of STR
copy number for TH01 and D13S317 markers in pure samples
(Supplementary Table S22). In addition, lobSTR does not pro-
vide information on allelic STR structure, as it only reports the
copy number of the major and uninterrupted STR unit and ig-
nores the information from other variable elements or variants
outside the STR itself. Consequently, lobSTR failed to accur-
ately detect the presence of mixed simples even in cases in
which samples were mixed 50:50 (Supplementary Table S22).

Although the information on strand speciﬁcity of the aligned
reads is present in the alignment ﬁle, unlike TSSV, lobSTR
does not provide the frequency in which each STR structure is
observed. This is an important measure to detect inconsistencies
and to rule out potential artifacts. RepeatSeq requires aligned
data and uses predeﬁned regions to characterize observed STR
alleles. Thus, reads were mapped to the reference genome (hg19)
using GS mapper, speciﬁcally designed for 454 sequencing data.

RepeatSeq reported results for only one STR locus (D8S1179),
despite sufﬁcient coverage for a number of STR loci in the BAM
ﬁle. After manipulating the region descriptions, we could not
improve the efﬁciency of RepeatSeq in identifying the targeted
STR loci. Thus, the result of RepeatSeq could not be used for a
conclusive comparison with TSSV.

4 DISCUSSION

In the past decade, advances in sequencing technologies as well
as computational analysis tools have enabled the study of gen-
omic variations to dissect the mechanisms by which they exert
their function in the case of human diseases, evolution and other
complex traits. Despite this unprecedented progress, structural

TSSV: characterizing complex allelic variants

 

variations and repetitive DNA sequences (such as STRs) or cou-
pling of de novo mutations present major obstacles for accurate
and reliable allelic analysis (Alkan et al., 2011; Gymrek et al.,
2012; Kidd et al., 2008; Treangen and Salzberg, 2012;
Weischenfeldt et al., 2013). In particular, most computational
tools are not ideal to identify STRs because of biases introduced
during alignment as well as strong reliance of algorithms on
coverage depth or the presence of split-reads. Here, we present
a method (TSSV) that provides a high-resolution map of allele-
specific genomic variants within targeted loci of interest. Our
approach does not rely on the use of a complete reference se-
quence to reliably profile highly polymorphic sequences (such as
STRs) or uncharacterized variants at a single-nucleotide reso-
lution. However, it does require two unique flanking sequences
that harbor the region of interest to identify supporting reads.
We assess the performance of TSSV on profiling known allelic
STR structures across pure samples from a single individual as
well as mixed samples with variable abundance. Of 16 allelic
STR structures that were targeted for sequencing, six STR loci
were sufficiently covered so that the associated allelic STR struc-
tures could be reliably resolved. The strong imbalance between
yield of STR markers is because of the assay (designed and
optimized for fluorescent dye-based fragment analysis of STR
loci) used for preparing the sequencing library. We show that
sensitivity of TSSV in determining allelic STR structures exceeds
mixtures with only 10% representation of minor alleles and more
complex mixtures in which a single STR allele is shared. The
lower boundary of detecting minor allele frequencies is subject
to experimental design and the complexity of the targeted locus
that may result in variable rate of slippage and background
noise. Our detailed analysis of three STR loci provides significant
insights into forensic DNA fingerprinting of mixed samples while
it confirms the feasibility of TSSV to profile causal allelic expan-
sion of triplet, tetranucleotide or more complex repeat structures
in variety of human disorders (Brook et al., 1992; Dere et al.,
2004; Kremer et al., 1991; Mahadevan et al., 1992; Mirkin, 2007;
Pearson et al., 2002; Verkerk et al., 1991).

Second, we sought to profile and annotate the full spectrum of
de novo mutations introduced by TALENs that specifically target
intron 52 of hDMD in mouse ES cells. The applicability of de-
signed TALENs to introduce mutations in a targeted locus lar-
gely depends on its efficacy because this method lacks a selection
procedure. Detected TALEN-specific editing events were almost
exclusively insertions and deletions that fit the expected mutation
profile of TALENs (Cermak et al., 2011). Although it has
recently been reported that TALENs induce insertions at a
much lower frequency than deletions (Kim et al., 2013), we
have observed an extremely balanced rate of insertion and dele-
tion events (37.26% versus 37.20%, respectively). Nevertheless,
TALENs-induced deletions tend to affect more bases than inser-
tions. We show that TSSV can resolve difficult-to-call editing
events that affect the length of homopolymers based on the vari-
ant frequency in TALEN-treated ES cells versus controls.
Moreover, the result of TSSV analysis of TALEN-treated and
control ES cells suggests that observed de novo structural variants
are predominantly caused by initiation of a double-strand break
that is repaired by non-homologous end-joining mechanism and
are not the result of sequencing errors. Notably, the IonTorrent
variant caller failed to identify any of the observed variants

because of their complexity, and therefore does not provide
any information on de novo allelic structures that were
introduced.

As laboratories begin to generate deep coverage sequencing
data to identify low frequent mutations (i.e. cancer genomics),
the robustness and accuracy of NGS technology and library
preparation methods has become vital (Costello et al., 2013).
After running TSSV on a third dataset to identify potential
causal mutations in samples from five DMD patients and one
female carrier, we observed numerous systematic errors intro-
duced by the IonTorrent PGM sequencer or the base-calling al-
gorithms. The number of sequencing reads that support the
presence of a new allele was in excess of 45% while no mutation
was found after Sanger sequencing of the same libraries.
Moreover, the amount of allelic discordant reads were unex-
pected and could not be biologically explained as five out of
six samples were derived from male patients who are expected
to have only one copy of the X-chromosome. Across all samples,
the majority of detected variations were single nucleotide inser-
tions (~62%), excluding duplications, that were mostly the result
of a single ‘A’ insertion (78%). Surprisingly, insertions were pre-
dominantly specific to the plus strand (94%) that can be the
result of flow order in specific sequence contexts. Although the
second base-caller improved the deletions and duplications rates
that were derived from over- or under-calling of homopolymers,
the insertion rates remained unchanged. We further observed a
preference for erroneous substitution events that were more pro-
nounced in the second base-caller. However, we were unable to
identify motifs that may be associated with observed biases. We
argue that the result of TSSV analysis and its ability to provide a
high-resolution map of variants ever more highlights the import-
ance of robust and vigorous assessment of downstream analysis
as we generate volumes of sequencing data to identify rare
mutations and in the advent of NGS in clinical diagnosis.

To demonstrate the added value of TSSV over mainstream
STR profiling tools, we ran lobSTR (Gymrek et al., 2012) and
RepeatSeq (Highnam et al., 2013) on four samples used for
resolving allelic STR structures. Because RepeatSeq hardly re-
ported any STR markers, the performance of TSSV could only
be compared with that of lobSTR. We show that TSSV robustly
and accurately resolved allelic STR structures with differing com-
plexity. TSSV outperformed lobSTR in reporting the accurate
copy number of major STR unit while it provides additional
information on allelic STR structures and their strand-specific
frequencies. Notably, TSSV excelled in resolving complex mix-
tures, whereas lobSTR failed to differentiate STR structures
associated with different samples, and therefore produced unre-
liable and inaccurate estimations. Although lobSTR performs
well on genotyping diploid samples, there is a clear need for
tools to resolve mixtures with differing level of complexity and
abundance.

Currently, the major limitation of TSSV is the sequencing read
length because the detectable allelic structures are restricted to
those that can entirely be covered by a single read. Thus, we
envision that the immediate developmental outlook for TSSV
can be the inference of allelic locus structure by local assembly
of partial reads (reads with only one recognizable ﬂanking
region) combined with the comparative analysis of coverage of
targeted loci and flanking regions. Furthermore, the promise of

novel sequencing technologies (such as Pacific Biosciences RS 11),
and therefore signiﬁcant increase in read length will aid the study
of larger structural variations.

Advances in sequencing technologies and computational ana-
lysis algorithms in unraveling genetic variations from SNPs and
indels to CNVs (Chen et al., 2009; DePristo et al., 2011; Goya
et al., 2010; Koboldt et al., 2009; McKenna et al., 2010; Ye et al.,
2009) have facilitated the study of experimental data on an
unprecedented scale to better understand the functional conse-
quences of genetic variations. TSSV complements the existing
tools by aiding the study of unknown, uncharacterized or
highly polymorphic and repetitive short structural variations
that can be used in a wide range of applications, from personal
genomics to forensic analysis and clinical diagnostics.

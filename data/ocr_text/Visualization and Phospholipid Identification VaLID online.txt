ABSTRACT

Motivation: Establishing phospholipid identities in large lipidomic data-
sets is a labour-intensive process. Where genomics and proteomics
capitalize on sequence-based signatures, glycerophospholipids lack
easily definable molecular fingerprints. Carbon chain length, degree
of unsaturation, linkage, and polar head group identity must be calcu-
lated from mass to charge (m/z) ratios under defined mass spectrom-
etry (MS) conditions. Given increasing MS sensitivity, many m/z values
are not represented in existing prediction engines. To address this
need, Visualization and Phospholipid Identification is a web-based ap-
plication that returns all theoretically possible phospholipids for any m/z
value and MS condition. Visualization algorithms produce multiple
chemical structure files for each species. Curated lipids detected by
the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Training Program in Neu-
rodegenerative Lipidomics are provided as high-resolution structures.
Availability: VaLID is available through the Canadian Institutes of
Health Research Training Program in Neurodegenerative Lipidomics

1 INTRODUCTION

The past 10 years have seen remarkable advances in high perform-
ance liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization mass spectrom-
etry (MS). Coupled with careful biochemistry enabling the separation
of membranes and, in some cases, membrane microdomains, adap-
tation of these technologies to the study of lipids is permitting com-
prehensive phospholipid proﬁling at the molecular level. The
emerging ﬁeld of lipidomics faces three main analytical challenges:
(i) a paucity of bioinformatic tools for spectral analysis; (ii) the need

for accurate lipid prediction algorithms before experimenters can pro-
ceed to empirical validation; (iii) a requirement for Visual tools cap-
able of displaying all theoretically possible lipid conformations in 2D
and 3D. The most comprehensive tool kit has been developed by the
LIPID MAPS Consortium representing >37 000 lipid species. The
majority of their curated MS data has been generated using mouse
leukemic monocyte—macrophage cells and, while extensive, does not
yet represent all biological lipids. To our knowledge, none of the
existing open-access web-based engines have capacity to predict iden-
tity of every m/z value detected in different MS spectra
(Supplementary Table S1). Visualization and Phospholipid Identiﬁ-
cation (V aLID) is a comprehensive, simple to use, resource enabling
rapid prediction of these tissue-speciﬁc lipid ‘unknowns’.

2 TOOL DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONALITY

2.1 Database content

The VaLID database contains exact and average masses (De Laeter
et al., 2003) for all theoretically possible: (i) phosphocholines; (ii)
phosphoserines; (iii) phosphoethanolamines; (iV) glycerophosphates;
(V) glyceropyrophosphates; (Vi) glycerophosphoglycerols; (Vii) glycer-
ophosphoglycerolphosphates; and (viii) cytidine 5’-diphosphate
1,2-diacyl-sn—glycerols. The database includes lyso- and phospho-
lipids with 1 to 30 carbons in each chain and up to six cis unsatur-
ations. Calculations consider ester, alkyl ether and Vinyl ether
linkages. Numerical datasets are in ExcelTM ﬁles.

2.2 Software requirements

VaLID requires a J avaTM-enabled Internet browser.

2.3 Using VaLID to predict lipid identity

The VaLID search engine predicts lipid identity taking into consid-
eration user-speciﬁc MS conditions (Fig. 1). The search engine is
coded in J avaTM. The Excel ﬁles are read with J ExcelApi. Users
choose exact or average mass before inputting their m/z of interest.
Simple pull-down menus restrict carbon chain lengths and linkages
within phospholipid classes while considering appropriate ion type.
Predictions appear in two panels: (i) Possible Lipids Include and (ii)
Possible Isomeric Lipids Include. The ﬁrst panel returns lipid

identities with arbitrarily assigned sn—l and sn-2 carbon chains. The
second panel lists corresponding isomers. List position is ordered by
lipid subclass (polar head group) and sorted by ascending (i) m/z; (ii)
number of carbons (sn-l chain); (iii) degree of unsaturation (sn-l
chain); (iv) number of carbons (sn-2 chain); and (V) degree of unsat-
uration (sn-2 chain). Nomenclature adheres to the LIPID MAPS
classiﬁcation system (Fahy et al., 2011). To assist in decision-making,
a ‘best guess’ feature is available whereby lipids in blue are con-
sidered ‘most likely’ based on the prevalence of constituent fatty
acids in mammalian cells (Miyazaki and Ntambi, 2008). Lipids in
red indicate that (i) the species is part of our Canadian Institutes of
Health Research Training Program in Neurodegenerative
Lipidomics (CTPNL)-curated database of neural lipids for which
(ii) we have generated multiple high-resolution representations.
Lipids in black represent theoretically possible combinations.

2.4 Displaying glycerophospholipid structures

To display all theoretically possible phospholipid conformations,
users can highlight the lipid of interest and click on the ‘Display
All’ button. The VaLID algorithm is conﬁned to drawing cis
double bonds separated by a minimum of two carbons. Using
JExcelApi, VaLID calculates where each atom should be in
2D-space and generates 2D representations displayed using
ChemAxon’s Marvin View 5.5.1.0. Marvin View enables the user
to toggle through structural Views and save each species in a variety
of formats. Chemical structures are drawn in accordance to the
standards developed by the LIPID MAPS consortium (Fahy et al.,
2011). The ‘Best Prediction’ button displays only those lipid species
found in VaLID’s Predicted to be Common database. The ‘Structural
Representations’ button displays lipids that are part of VaLID’s
curated Structural Representations database identiﬁed in neural
tissue by CTPNL researchers. These species can be Viewed in
high-resolution as (i) 2D skeletal models; (ii) 3D ball and stick
models; (iii) space ﬁlling models; or (iv) rendered ‘VaLID View’
models. VaLID View models were assembled in ChemDraw3D®,
translated into a 3D model where each atom was marked by an x,
y and z coordinate and exported into Autodesk® Maya® V2012.
Rigid and dynamic models were derived using Maya® nParticles,
converted into smooth polygonal meshes. These meshes were dir-
ected to the original x, y and z coordinates and imported as points
in space to recapitulate the original molecular structure in an

abstracted, organic, form. Resulting VaLID View models are avail-
able for download as rigid polygons. They are also available on
request ﬁtted with a rig of movable joints between atoms, a process
typically used by graphic artists to animate human or animal char-
acters, to facilitate membrane reconstruction and modelling.

3 CONCLUSION

VaLID is a web-based application linking a convenient search
engine, a phospholipid database and multiple Visualization features
for identiﬁcation and dissemination of large-scale lipidomic datasets.
VaLID returns all theoretically possible species based on m/z and
user-deﬁned MS conditions. The user is cautioned that VaLID in-
cludes lipids (and isomeric bond conﬁgurations) that may not be
biologically relevant. Investigators are encouraged to mine these
lists for species most relevant to their speciﬁc biological system for
subsequent validation. To assist in decision-making, a ‘best guess’
feature is available to focus on lipids predicted to be common based
on the prevalence of the fatty acid chains in mammalian cells. Every
theoretical conformation (in cis conﬁguration) for each species can
be Viewed in 2D and 3D. Curated species can also be downloaded in
multiple high-resolution representations for further Visualization and
model production.

Abstract

Summary: Prioritization of candidate genes emanating from large—scale screens requires inte—
grated analyses at the genomics, molecular, network and structural biology levels. We have
extended the Integrated Genome Browser (IGB) to facilitate these tasks. The graphical user inter—
face greatly simplifies building disease networks and zooming in at atomic resolution to identify
variations in molecular complexes that may affect molecular interactions in the context of genomic
data. All results are summarized in genome tracks and can be visualized and analyzed at the tran—

script level.

Availability and implementation: The MI Bundle is a plugin for the IGB. The plugin, help, video and
tutorial are available at http://cru.genomics.iit.it/igbmibundle/ and https://github.com/CRUiit/igb—mi—
bundle/wiki. The source code is released under the Apache License, Version 2.

1 Introduction

Large—scale genomics initiatives aim at systematically cataloguing
the complete spectrum of genomic changes in diverse biological and
clinical conditions and to elucidate the contribution of those changes
to the pathogenesis of disease. These initiatives routinely produce
long lists of candidate genes that must be prioritized before more de—
tailed functional studies are warranted. Prioritization of candidates
ideally should take advantage of the entire range of available
data and produce an integrated picture that permits evaluating the
contribution of individual genes to the pathogenic process on a
data—driven basis. However, the heterogenic nature of data and bio—
informatics tools to manipulate them places numerous hurdles on
the way, in particular for biologists with limited bioinformatics
skills. We have developed a plug—in for Integrated Genome Browser
(IGB) (Nicol et 61]., 2009) to facilitate candidate prioritization based
on network and structural biology criteria in the context of diverse
genomic data types that can be loaded as browser tracks. The plugin
permits analyzing how genomic variations, in particular missense
mutations, may affect the interaction between gene products and
other molecules as well as their interference with biological

pathways based on the most updated standards and resources avail—
able for network and structural biology.

2 Molecular networks and structures

The MI Bundle interrogates on—line interaction databases to identify
binding molecules. The query benefits from the adoption of the
PSICQUIC (Aranda et 61]., 2011) standard web service implementa—
tion by the major databases. The structures and models for the inter—
actions are obtained either from PDB (Velankar et al., 2011) or
Interactome3D (Mosca et 61]., 2013). PDB provides structures for
species and interactions that are not covered by Interactome3D, as
well as protein—DNA, protein—RNA and protein—ligand inter-
actions. On the other side, Interactome3D increases the coverage of
the network with high quality models. The genomic regions of inter-
est may be associated to one or more transcripts whose sequence is
translated and mapped to the Uniprot (Magrane and Consortium,
2011) sequences of the splicing variants, which are later aligned to
the associated chains in the PDB files. The atoms of each structure
are browsed to eXtract first the residues encoded by any of the

selected genomic regions, and second to identify which of those resi—
dues are at the interface between two chains [residues that lose one
A2 of available surface area upon binding, calculated with the
BioJava library (Prlic et al., 2012)]. Alternatively, it is possible to
use the dSysMap database (Mosca et al., 2015), which relies on a
pre—defined set of missense mutations. The structures and the con—
tact residues can be selected and displayed in a Jmol frame (The
Jmol Team, 2007) (Fig. 1d).

Although the number of available protein structures is consider—
able, coverage is far from complete (Mosca et al., 2013).
Nevertheless, non—structure based molecular interaction networks
represent valuable tools for gleaning insight into the complex rela-
tionships between genotypes, network properties and phenotypes
(Ideker and Sharan, 2008; Vidal et al., 2011). With the MI Bundle,
it is indeed possible to build such networks directly from the gen—
omic data and either display them directly from IGB (Fig. 1c) or ex-
port them in a standard format that can be analyzed using
appropriate software such as Cytoscape (Saito et al., 2012).

3 Contact residues and diseases

Recently, Mosca et al. (2015 ) have shown that disease causing muta—
tions are more likely to affect protein protein interaction interfaces.
We loaded known genomic variations of RUNX1 from ClinVar
(Landrum et al., 2013), a repository of variations and associated
phenotypes, observed principally in patients with acute myelogenous
leukemia (Fig. 1a and b). In the MI—Bundle, a new track can be cre—
ated for each molecular interaction enabling the comparison of the
interfaces of a single molecule with different partners at the genomic
level. In Figure 1b, we compare the interactions that may be affected
by the different variations: two of those (positions K83 and R174)
are identified at the interface with DNA only. Previous studies have
shown that in the presence of mutation at those sites no DNA

variations for RUNX1 are loaded from ClinVar and cBioPortal (purple tracks).

DNA (orange track) and RUNX1 (homodimer, blue track). (c) Network repre-

binding is observed while the homodimerization capability is pre—
served (Michaud et al., 2002). Another mutation at position 107 is
mapped to the interface with CBFB and may, as suggested by
Walker et al. (2002), impair this interaction, destabilizing the bind-
ing of RUNX1 to DNA and leading to RUNX1 degradation. We
loaded additional mutations from cBioPortal (Cerami et al., 2012).
Several of those where identified at the interface with RUNX1 (14,
of which 10 new), CBFB (10/9) and DNA (5/4), suggesting how
those variations may interfere with the molecular network and cause
or predispose to disease. Further description of the mapping of
RUNX1 variations is available in the Supplementary Material

4 Discussion

Based on their observation of the property of disease causing muta—
tions, Mosca et al. developed dSysMap, a web server that allows
mapping mutations (provided as amino acid positions) to the struc—
tures and models of human protein—protein interactions. Structure—
PPI (Vazquez et al., 2015) propose a similar strategy that Mechismo
(Betts et al., 2014) extends to protein—nucleic acid and protein—
ligand interactions and an assessment of the impact of the mutation
on the binding properties of the molecules.

The integration of our plugin into a genome browser provides
genome biologists access to network and structural analysis: The
analyses start from genomic regions, allowing their integration with
sequencing pipelines managed by IGB, and to be independent of any
preliminary mapping to the protein sequences. The possibility to se—
lect the source database extends the range of possible analyses: even
when no structures are available, it helps identifying new connec—
tions and functional relationships between target genes. Moreover,
each new session queries public online databases: each query can be
repeated to benefit from new data released in molecular interaction
and structure databases.

Finally, the bundle benefits from all the features and future de—
velopments of IGB, including the many species available (e.g.
Mouse, A. thaliana and E. coli).

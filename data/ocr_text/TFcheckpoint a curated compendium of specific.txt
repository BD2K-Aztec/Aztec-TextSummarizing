ABSTRACT

Summary: Gene regulatory network assembly and analysis requires
high-quality knowledge sources that cover functional aspects of the
various components of the gene regulatory machinery. A multiplicity of
resources exists with information about mammalian transcription
factors (T Fs); yet, only few of these provide sufficiently accurate clas-
sifications of the functional roles of individual TFs, or standardized
evidence that would justify the information on which these functional
classifications are based. We compiled the list of all putative TFs from
nine different resources, ignored factors such as general TFs, mediator
complexes and chromatin modifiers, and for the remaining factors
checked the available literature for references that support their
function as a true sequence-specific DNA-binding RNA polymerase
II TF (DbTF). The results are available in the TFcheckpoint database,
an exhaustive collection of TFs annotated according to experimental
and other evidence on their function as true DbTFs. TFcheckpoint.org
provides a high-quality and comprehensive knowledge source for
genome-scale regulatory network studies.

Availability: The TFcheckpoint database is freely available at www.
tfcheckpoint.org

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcription factors (TFs) lie at the basis of gene-expression
diversity in different cell types and conditions. TFs constitute
key gene regulatory components that usually participate in
large multiprotein—DNA complexes, where they guide RNA
polymerase (i.e. RNAP I, II and III) activity and regulate the
onset and rate of RNA synthesis. These protein complexes may
include general transcription factors that bind to core-promoter
DNA; general cofactors that bind to general transcription factors
to form a pre-initiation transcription complex; and speciﬁc
DNA-binding transcription factors and factors that lack
DNA-binding domains but exert their regulatory roles through

interaction with other proteins in the transcription complex. This
last class of protein-interacting transcription regulators includes
coactivators, corepressors, histone modiﬁers and chromatin
remodeling proteins (Lee and Young, 2000).

The DNA-binding transcription factors (DbTFs) play a cen-
tral role in specifying which genes are transcribed, as they guide
the transcription machinery to distinct target genes by binding to
speciﬁc gene regulatory elements located in proximal promoters
as well as in distal enhancer regions Kadonaga (2004). The
DbTF proteins that regulate RNAP II enjoy a special focus in
gene regulatory network building because of their strong ability
to explain the protein-coding gene-expression landscape of bio-
logical responses. Access to accurate and genome-scale know-
ledge concerning these DbTFs, therefore, is of key importance.
Multiple resources with knowledge about mammalian TF exist
(Fulton et al., 2009; Harris et al., 2004; Kummerfeld and
Teichmann, 2006; Messina et al., 2004; Ravasi et al., 2010;
Sandelin et al., 2004; Schaefer et al., 2011; Vaquerizas et al.,
2009; Zhang et al., 2012). However, we observed that (i) most
of them do not distinguish well between true DbTFs, protein-
interacting TFs and general TFs and (ii) only in a minority of
cases do they provide standardized evidence for the functional
role of the TFs. Because of this, users of these resources will only
have an obscured view at the domain of DbTFs. Here we present
TFcheckpoint (www.tfcheckpoint.org), a comprehensive reposi-
tory of human, mouse and rat TF candidates. All entries have
been manually checked for literature information pertaining to
their potential biological function as DbTFs. The database serves
as a checkpoint for TF information, is freely available and
supports ID or name searching, browsing and bulk download.

2 RESULTS

2.1 Database content

TFcheckpoint contains the cumulative inventory of nine major
TF information sources (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Material),
and we manually checked each of these entries for literature
describing evidence for RNAP II-regulating DNA-binding tran-
scription factors, for human, mouse or rat. The evidence that we
selected should at least support Gene Ontology (GO) term
‘Sequence—speciflc DNA-binding RNA polymerase II transcrip-
tion factor activity (GO:OOOO981)’, taking this as the minimum
deﬁning term for a true RNAPII-regulating DbTF. In general,

Fig. 1. TF candidate and associated literature references. For each
resource, the total numbers of TF entries (light gray) and TF entries
with literature references (dark gray) are given. For GOC data, all
unique proteins annotated to ‘Sequence—speciﬁc DNA-binding transcrip-
tion factor activity (GO:0003700)’ or any of its children, are listed. The
bar to the far right indicates 3462 unique TF entries in TFcheckpoint; 984
of these (adjacent black bar) were deemed to be true DbTFs.

we selected the ﬁrst PubMed article(s) that showed satisfactory
evidence for a speciﬁc TF (for details see Supplementary
Material).

We assembled a list of 3462 putative TFs from the aforemen-
tioned resources (Fig. 1). We have used orthology mappings
from UniProt to identify corresponding gene Entrez IDs from
human, rat and mouse. For 984 proteins, we could identify one
or more relevant articles with the evidence for a DbTF, yielding
1073 unique PubMed references. Eight hundred twenty-four
DbTFs are supported by literature references with experimental
evidence. Just to be as comprehensive as possible in our coverage
of current knowledge, we included a further 155 DbTFs that are
supported by author statements and a ﬁnal 5 that are supported
by sequence-based analysis. The full list and the literature
reference results are available from the TF checkpoint database.

The availability of high-quality and exhaustive information at
one central place facilitates the access by the global scientiﬁc
community. We are currently working together with the Gene
Ontology Consortium (GOC) to develop and apply general
standards for TF annotation and merge our ﬁndings with the
GO database (Harris et al., 2004). Our efforts should help the
GOC to solve the current backlog in DbTF curation.

2.2 Database user interface

TFcheckpoint is powered by MySQL and accessible through a
web interface created with J oomla (http://www.joomla.org),
implementing HTML and PHP scripts. The database is hosted
on an apache server at the Norwegian data infrastructure
Norstore (http://www.norstore.no) and available at www.
tfcheckpoint.org. The database can be used for simple browsing
of all 3462 candidate TFs as well as the subset of DbTFs with
literature evidence. For each DbTF, the literature reference(s)
and information about the original TF candidate resource that
we obtained it from are provided. All TF entries are linked to
Entrez and UniProt IDs. The NCBI ofﬁcial gene symbol is used
as a primary key, but the data can also be searched for any of the

NCBI provided synonyms, as well as Entrez and UniProt iden-
tiﬁers. All data are also downloadable as a tab-delimited text ﬁle.

3 CONCLUSION

A literature-based exhaustively curated list of transcription fac-
tors is an invaluable resource for researchers working on gene
regulatory mechanisms. The ENCODE project for instance is
targeting the generation of evidence for some 1900 putative
DbTFs (ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2012), as estimated
by one of our sources Waquerizas et al., 2009). TFcheckpoint
provides a reference for both small-scale experiments and
genome-scale studies. Researchers may verify predicted lists
of TFs even before characterizing the role of these regulatory
proteins (Choi et al., 2006; Gray et al., 2004) or they can use
the background knowledge of TFs to infer gene regulatory net-
works OK e et al., 2009). By ensuring that our annotations become
part of the GO database, this knowledge will become available to
all analysis approaches based on GO knowledge.

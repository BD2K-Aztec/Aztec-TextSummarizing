Abstract

Summary: DNA methylation is an important mechanism regulating gene transcription, and its
role in carcinogenesis has been extensively studied. Hyper and hypomethylation of genes is an
alternative mechanism to deregulate gene expression in a wide range of diseases. At the same
time, high-throughput DNA methylation assays have been developed generating vast amounts of
genome wide DNA methylation measurements. Yet, few tools exist that can formally identify hypo
and hypermethylated genes that are predictive of transcription and thus functionally relevant for
a particular disease. To accommodate this lack of tools, we developed MethylMix, an algorithm
implemented in R to identify disease specific hyper and hypomethylated genes. MethylMix is
based on a beta mixture model to identify methylation states and compares them with the normal
DNA methylation state. MethylMix introduces a novel metric, the ’Differential Methylation value’ or
DM-value defined as the difference of a methylation state with the normal methylation state.
Finally, matched gene expression data are used to identify, besides differential, transcriptionally
predictive methylation states by focusing on methylation changes that effect gene expression.

Availability and implementation: MethylMix was implemented as an R package and is available

 

in bioconductor.

1 Introduction

DNA methylation is one of the most studied epigenetic aberrations
underlying oncogenesis. Besides genetic mutations, hyper and hypo-
methylation of genes is an alternative mechanism that is capable of
altering the normal state and driving a Wide range of diseases. Prior
studies have identified hypo or hypermethylation based on heuristic
measures for example in breast cancer (Hill et al., 2011).
Additionally, computational methods have been developed to iden-
tify differentially methylated regions for specific DNA methylation
platforms (Aryee et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2012; Warden et al.,
2013). However, few methods formalize the identification of DNA
methylation driven genes using a model-based approach. We identi-
fied three key criteria that should be addressed to derive key methy-
lation-driven genes. First, the determination of the degree of
methylation cannot hinge on arbitrary thresholds as is commonly
done. Second, the assessment of a gene as hyper or hypomethylated
must be made in comparison to normal tissue. Finally, the

identification of genes that are hyper or hypomethylated should be
transcriptionally predictive effect, thereby implying that their
methylation is functionally relevant. We designed MethylMix to ac-
commodate these three criteria to identify methylation driven genes
in diseases.

2 Algorithm

MethylMix integrates DNA methylation from normal and disease
samples and matched disease gene expression data via a three-step
algorithm:

° Step i: Genes are ﬁltered by identifying transcriptionally predict-
ive methylation. First, each CpG site is associated with its closest
gene. Next, MethylMix requires that the DNA methylation of a
CpG site has a signiﬁcant effect on its corresponding gene expres-
sion in order for the gene to be considered a methylation-driven
gene. We deﬁne such genes as transcriptionally predictive genes.

° Step ii: The methylation states of a gene are identiﬁed using uni-
variate beta mixture modeling to identify subgroups of patients
with similar DNA methylation level for a speciﬁc CpG site. We
use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select the num-
ber of methylation states by iteratively adding a new mixture
component if the BIC score improves. Each beta mixture compo-
nent is referred to as a methylation state and represented by its
mean methylation level.

° Step iii: Hyper and hypomethylated genes are deﬁned relative to
normal by comparing the methylation levels of each methylation
state to the mean of the DNA methylation levels of normal tissue
samples using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Based on this test,
Differential Methylation values or DM-values are created
deﬁned as the difference of a methylation state with the normal
methylation state. Genes with methylation states different from
normal are called differential genes.

The final output of MethylMix is genes that are both transcription-
ally predictive and differential together with the parameters of their
methylation states. Additionally, a matrix of DM-values is part of
the output and can be used in subsequent analysis, for example to
define methylation driven subgroups using clustering algorithms.

3 Functions and examples

MethylMix was implemented in the statistical language R and is
provided as an R package in the supplementary data. MethylMix
contains two key functionalities; the creation of MethylMix models
for a set of genes of any size and the visualization of a MethylMix
plot for each gene. MethylMix needs three datasets: normal DNA
methylation data, disease DNA methylation data and matched dis-
ease gene expression data. The normal DNA methylation data
should ideally be from the same tissue or cell type as the disease
DNA methylation data. We provided example data for 14 genes
from 251 glioblastoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) (McLendon et al., 2008) in the package. The 14 genes were
selected based on their documented differential DNA methylation
status in glioblastoma in the literature (Etcheverry et al., 2010; Hegi
et al., 2004). First, a MethylMix model is created for all genes as
follows:

MethylMix will first investigate for each gene if it is transcrip-
tionally predictive by building a linear regression model that esti-
mates the association between DNA methylation and gene
expression. MethylMix only selects genes with a significant inverse
relationship (P value < 0.01) resulting in nine transcriptionally pre-
dictive genes in this example. Then a MethylMix model is created
for these nine transcriptionally predictive genes and MethylMix re-
ports how many methylation states each gene has. For large datasets
with more genes, MethylMix can be run in parallel mode and take
advantage of multiple cores.

Next, a MethylMix model plot can be created for each gene visu-
alizing the beta mixture model and the methylation states that were
identified for a particular gene. Additional parameters can be passed
to the plot function by adding the normal methylation data and the
matched gene expression data. These additional parameters will
visualize the 95% confidence interval of the normal DNA methyla-
tion data and the relationship with matched gene expression data.

For example, Figure 1 displays the MethylMix model for
MGMT showing two methylation states, whereby the low methyla-
tion state matches the normal methylation and the high methylation
state corresponds to hypermethylation of MGMT, a well-known
case of hypermethylation influencing treatment of glioblastoma pa-
tients (Hegi et al., 2004). Next, Figure 2 shows the inverse correl-
ation between DNA methylation and matched gene expression of
MGMT.

4 Conclusion

MethylMix is an R package that identifies hyper and
hypomethylated genes using a beta mixture modeling approach.
MethylMix also quantifies the effect DNA methylation has on gene
expression, thereby identifying transcriptionally predictive DNA
methylation events. MethylMix can be used both to study single
genes as in the example above or in parallel mode to build
MethylMix models genome wide. MethylMix requires a large

cohort to identify methylation states and capture DNA methylation
heterogeneity present in a particular disease. We used MethylMix
and their associated DM-values to identify driver genes (Gevaert
and Plevritis, 2013; Gevaert et al., 2013, 2014), on dataset sizes of
100 samples ore more, and on more than 4000 TCGA cases across
12 tissues to identify methylation driven subgroups (Gevaert et al.,
2015). In summary, MethylMix offers a new tool to identify methy-
lation-driven genes providing a complimentary source of informa-
tion to copy number and mutation spectra to identify disease driver
genes.

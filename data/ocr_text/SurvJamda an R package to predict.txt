ABSTRACT

Summary: Sueramda (Survival prediction by joint analysis of
microarray data) is an R package that utilizes joint analysis of
microarray gene expression data to predict patients’ survival and risk
assessment. Joint analysis can be performed by merging datasets
or meta-analysis to increase the sample size and to improve survival
prognosis. The prognosis performance derived from the combined
datasets can be assessed to determine which feature selection
approach, joint analysis method and bias estimation provide the most
robust prognosis for a given set of datasets.

Availability: The sueramda package is available at the
Comprehensive R Archive Network, http://cran.r—project.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

The sueramda package was developed for survival prediction
and risk assessment based on microarray data. It allows to jointly
analyze the datasets through data merging and meta-analysis. Data
merging combines the data into one set prior to their analysis,
whereas meta-analysis integrates only the results. In addition to
different joint analysis methods, sueramda contains various
feature selection approaches and bias estimation techniques which
enable the user to determine the combination of which methods
provides the most robust prediction for a given set of datasets.

A few other R packages like ipdmeta (Broeze et al., 2009)
and survc omp (Haibe—Kains et al., 2008) have been created for
joint analysis, that are more speciﬁcally, related to meta-analysis of
censored data with time-to-event outcome.

2 DATA

The functions and algorithms developed in sueramda can be
assessed on the datasets of the sueramda.data package.
Sueramda . data, created by the author, is a data package
of 18 Mb containing three breast cancer datasets, GSE3143,
GSE1992 and GSE4335, which were analyzed in Yasrebi et al.
(2009). Sueramda . data are also available on Comprehensive
R Archive Network.

3 METHODS

3.1 Feature selection

(i) Top-ranking (Yasrebi et al., 2009). The multiple hypothesis testing
correction implemented in the p . adjust function in the R stats
package can also be applied to the top-ranking method.

(ii) User-deﬁned method.

3.2 Joint analysis methods
(i) Merging method:
(a) ComBat (Johnson et al., 2007).

(b) Z-score normalization. This method is applied in two ways:

(1) Z-scorel normalization: in this approach, all datasets
are Z-score normalized (Larsen et al., 2000) prior to
their selection for the training and testing sets and their
combination into one set (Yasrebi et al., 2009).

(2) Z-score2 normalization: in this method, the datasets are
initially selected for the training and testing sets. Then,
the datasets composing the training set are merged together
and Z-score normalized. The testing set is also Z-score
normalized independently and separately from the training
set.

(ii) Meta-analysis. The inverse normal method (Hedges et al., 1985) is
used for meta-analysis.

3.3 Validation frameworks
(i) Cross validation (CV) nested in 10 iterations.

(ii) Independent validation.

(a) Pair-wise mode: two datasets are selected at a time, one of which
is used as the training set and the other as the testing set. This
process is iterated until all datasets are used as the training and
testing sets (Yasrebi et al., 2009).

(b) Leave one dataset out: all datasets except one are merged together
to form the training set and the left-out set is used as the testing
set. Similarly, this process is iterated until all datasets are used as
the training and testing sets (Yasrebi et al., 2009).

3.4 Performance measures

(i) Survival prediction is expressed by time-dependent area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (Heagerty et al., 2000) and
hazard ratio measures risk assessment (Yasrebi et al., 2009).

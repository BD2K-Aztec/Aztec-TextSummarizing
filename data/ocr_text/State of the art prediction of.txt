Abstract

Motivation: Understanding the substrate specificity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—1 pro-
tease is important when designing effective HlV-1 protease inhibitors. Furthermore, characterizing
and predicting the cleavage profile of HIV-1 protease is essential to generate and test hypotheses
of how HIV-1 affects proteins of the human host. Currently available tools for predicting cleavage

by HIV-1 protease can be improved.

Results: The linear support vector machine with orthogonal encoding is shown to be the best pre-
dictor for HIV-1 protease cleavage. It is considerably better than current publicly available predictor
services. It is also found that schemes using physicochemical properties do not improve over the
standard orthogonal encoding scheme. Some issues with the currently available data are discussed.
Availability and implementation: The datasets used, which are the most important part, are avail-
able at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The tools used are all standard and easily available.

1 Introduction

Globally, an estimated 35 million people were living with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at the end of 2012, and
roughly as many have died of HIV-related illnesses since the begin-
ning of the epidemic (World Health Organization, 2014). HIV-1
protease, also known as HIV-1 retropepsin (EC 3.4.23.16), is an
aspartyl protease belonging to the retroviral protease (retropepsin)
family. The protease plays a crucial role in the life cycle of HIV, the
causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); it
cleaves the HIV-1 polyproteins in multiple sites to create mature
protein components of the virions, the infectious HIV particles
(Sundquist and Krausslich, 2012).

Because the formal discovery of HIV in the early 19805 and the
ensuing characterization of HIV-1 protease, successful attempts
have been made to create drugs that inhibit the protease (Hughes
et al., 2011). These slow down or even stop the progression of HIV
infection to AIDS (however, the effectiveness of the treatment can
decrease with time due to mutations in the virus). Today,

combinations of drugs with different mechanisms of action are often
used to achieve high efficacy against the virus but as low toxicity as
possible to the patient. Although HIV therapy is one of the most suc-
cessful pharmacotherapeutical achievements in the history of medi-
cine it is not curative, but rather transforms a deadly infection into a
chronic one, often with a prolonged asymptomatic phase if properly
treated.

A reliable predictor of cleavage by HIV-1 protease can be used
to aid in the identification of novel HIV-1 protease substrates in
human host cells (cf. Devroe et al., 2005) and aid in the understand-
ing of the specificity and the development of even more tightly fit-
ting and more potent HIV-1 protease inhibitors in the future, but
hopefully with less severe side effects, such as metabolic syndrome
and gastrointestinal symptoms. The work may also be of help in pre-
diction and understanding of other viral proteases in the future. The
HIV-1 protease specificity is considered to be both broad and spe-
cific; it cleaves a variety of sequences but also processes the HIV-1
gag and gag-pol polyproteins accurately (Darke et al., 1988).

State of the art prediction of HIV-1 protease cleavage sites

1205

 

There are two different approaches to predicting cleavage by
HIV-1 protease: molecular modeling and sequence analysis. It has
been argued that the HIV-1 protease recognizes shape rather than a
specific amino acid sequence (Prabu-Jeybalan et al., 2002), which
supports aiming for the molecular modeling approach. However,
the method is cumbersome and no large scale study has been done
on the accuracy of molecular modeling approaches so it is very
unclear if the approach is, or will be, competitive with the sequence-
based approach. This article demonstrates the current state-of-the-
art prediction, which uses the sequence-based approach.

Several bioinformatics researchers have attacked this problem dur-
ing the last 20 years, using a diversity of methods (for the most recent
review see Rognvaldsson et al., 2007). It was early on claimed that the
problem required non-linear methods. However, 10 years ago it was
demonstrated that the relatively few experimental data (362 octamers
at the time) did not support a non-linear model (Rognvaldsson and
You, 2004). Five years later, when more experimental data were avail-
able, linear methods [linear support vector machines (LSVMs)] still per-
formed better than non-linear ones (Rognvaldsson et al., 2009). This
was when the methods were evaluated through out-of-sample testing
on a large dataset from human proteins (Schilling and Overall, 2008).
It was therefore speculated (see Rognvaldsson et al., 2007 for the dis-
cussion) that linearity could be a characteristic for the HIV-1 protease
cleavage problem. (Note that linear and non-linear relate to when the
standard orthogonal encoding is used.)

A number of papers have been published on the subject over the
last 5 years. The most common theme in them is to introduce new
features plus a feature selection scheme and show that this yields
slightly better prediction accuracy when evaluated with cross-valid-
ation. Surprisingly few studies have used the experimental data from
the article by Schilling and Overall (2008), which is more than dou-
ble the size of any other available dataset.

Ogul (2009) used variable context Markov chains (Bejerano and
Yona, 2001) to construct a generative model for the HIV-1 cleavage
specificity. He reported the highest ever prediction accuracies with
this method, evaluated with cross-validation.

Nanni and Lumini (2009) created a number of different features
and fused classifiers, among others using genetic programming (GP).
Their proposed classifiers performed better than a non-optimized
LSVM with standard encoding, when evaluated using cross-valid-
ation. Their software is available.

Jaeger and Chen (2010) suggested new biophysical features and
fused several classifiers [neural networks, support vector machines
(SVMs) and decision trees]. They reported that they often achieved
better performance than just using a single classifier from this, when
evaluating with cross-validation.

Kim et al. (2010) suggested a feature selection method where a
multilayer perceptron was trained and then used to compute the effect
of the different inputs so that the best inputs were selected. They re-
ported that this gave a much smaller feature set and better prediction
accuracy. They tested this on a small dataset with cross-validation.

Li et al. (2010) mapped the amino acid sequences to a local ker-
nel space and reduced the dimensionality together with a LSVM
classifier. They reported that this was better than other methods
when evaluated using cross-validation.

Newell (2011) studied the specificity using cascade detection on
two larger datasets and concluded that favorable cooperativity be-
tween sites is weak. Newell used the larger dataset from Schilling
and Overall in his study.

Gok and Ozcerit (2012) studied several encoding schemes and
suggested the OETMAP encoding scheme, based on amino acid fea-
tures, together with a linear classifier. This encoding improved the

prediction performance significantly compared with standard amino
acid encodings when evaluated on two larger datasets using cross-
validation. Gok and Ozcerit used the larger dataset from Schilling
and Overall. Their encoding schemes are available on a web server
(http://yufes.yalova.edu.tr/).

Song et al. (2012) presented a web server for predicting cleavage
by many different proteases, using support vector regression
together with many different features. Features were encoded with
bi-profile Bayesian feature extraction and selected using a Gini
score. They used the larger dataset from Schilling and Overall plus
other published data on cleavage of full proteins. Their methods are
available (https://prosper.erc.monash.edu.au/).

Niu et al. (2013) used a correlation-based feature subset selec-
tion method combined with genetic algorithms to search for the best
subset in a large set of features. This gave better performance than
the standard methods when evaluated with cross-validation.

Ozturk et al. (2013) used a sequence representation and intro-
duced a feature selection method (that removed features). They
reported improved prediction results with this when tested with
cross-validation on a small dataset with only cleaved octamers.
Their software is designed to work with the Waikato Environment
for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) (Hall et al., 2009) and is available
by email.

In summary, many have claimed improvements over the LSVM
using standard orthogonal encoding. However, few have taken the
effort to check if their new features, feature selection method or model
combination method really does better on out-of-sample data or if they
are better than improvements suggested by others. This is a significant
weakness since there is a real risk of being overly optimistic about
one’s own algorithm if one has access to the data that it is tested on.

There are two motivations for mining HIV-1 protease cleavage
data: one is to describe the available experimental data, e.g. with se-
quence motifs or cleavage rules, the other is to design a method for
predicting new cleavage sites. In the latter case, which is by far the
most common motivation, the test data must be different from the
data used to train the algorithm. A correct evaluation of methods
must be done on test data that have not in any way been involved in
the training of the algorithms. This is typically not done.

2 Methods

The HIV-1 cleavage problem is described in detail in (Rognvaldsson
et al., 2007) together with discussions on different encoding
schemes. Only a concise description is given here. The classification
task is to tell whether a given octamer (sequence of eight amino
acids) will be cleaved or not between the fourth and the fifth pos-
ition. The octamer is represented using an orthogonal encoding
where each amino acid is represented by a 20-bit vector with 19 bits
set to zero and one bit set to one (other encodings have been sug-
gested, see later). This maps each octamer to an 8 by 20 binary ma-
trix that is transformed into a 160-dimensional vector. However,
the dimensionality of the problem is 152 since there are eight linear
constraints (each position must be occupied by one amino acid).

The inputs were centered so that the zero bits were set to —1 be-
fore presenting them to the classifier. The outputs were similarly
coded as {—1,1}: minus one for uncleaved octamers and plus one for
cleaved octamers. The OETMAP encoding (Gok and Ozcerit, 2012)
and the GP1 encoding (Nanni and Lumini, 2009) were also tried, in
addition to the standard orthogonal encoding. The OETMAP was
used by calling the web server mentioned earlier. The GP1 encoding
was created by using the scripts provided by the authors, the inputs

were centered to {—1,+1} before presented to the classifier. The soft-
ware and feature selection from Ozturk et al. (2013) was tried but
crashed and is therefore not included in the comparison.

The libsvm 3.18 library (Chang and Lin, 2011) was used, with
the multi-class C-SVC method, to train SVMs and called from
within the MATLAB (MATLAB, 2013) environment. Both linear
and radial basis kernels were tried. The hyperparameters C and y
(the latter for the non-LSVM) were optimized by search and 10-fold
cross-validation. For the LSVM, the C parameter was varied over
the set log(C) = {—5, —4.75, —4.5, —4.25, . . . , 5}. For the non-
LSVM the C parameter was varied over the set log(C) ={0, 0.25,
0.5, 0.75, . . . , 7} and the y parameter was varied over the set
log(y) = {—5, —4.75, —4.5, —4.25, . . . , 0}. The final values were se-
lected by looking at the mean and median area under the receiver
operator characteristic (ROC) curve (this area is called AUC). The
goal was to select them to maximize the cross-validation AUC.
Sometimes the median and mean were not maximal for the same
value(s) of C (and y) and then a subjective choice was made. One
final SVM model was trained with the full training dataset and the
optimal hyperparameter values.

Two predictors on the web were used as comparison: HIVcleave
(Shen and Chou, 2008), at http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/I-IIV/
#, and PROSPER (Song et al., 2012), at https://prosper.erc.monash.
edu.au/. The HIVcleave predictions were done by concatenating the
peptides and octamers in the datasets and submitting them in suit-
able chunks to the web server. This does not present any problem
for the HIVcleave predictor since it cuts up the sequence into
octamers. PROSPER is designed to predict cleavage in full proteins.
The comparison with PROSPER was therefore done on full protein
sequences, which were submitted to the PROSPER server.

Algorithm performances were, when possible, compared using
the full ROC curve and the test with correlated data described in
DeLong et al. (1988).

3 Results
3.1 The HIV-1 PR datasets

Four different datasets were used in our experiments: one with 746
octamers; one with 1625 octamers; one with 3272 octamers and one
with 947 octamers. The 746 dataset was presented in 2005 (You
et al., 2005). The 1625 dataset was presented in 2007 (Kontijevskis
et al., 2007). The third and largest dataset was collected from the
work of Schilling and Overall (2008) on human proteins. It was pre-
sented in 2009 (Rognvaldsson et al., 2009). The details of how the
first three datasets were collected are described in the references.

The three older datasets needed some corrections. The two
datasets with 746 and 1625 octamers were corrected according to
the comment in Rognvaldsson et al. (2009), i.e. the octamer
SQNYAIVQ was labeled as cleaved. Furthermore, we discovered
some errors in the supplementary material of Schilling and Overall
(2008), from which the largest dataset had been created. These are
mostly of the form that a character has been lost compared with the
sequence in the databases. The sequences were corrected so that
they matched the database sequences. The changes are listed in
Table 1. This produced a slightly larger dataset than the one used in
Rognvaldsson et al. (2009). The dataset is denoted as the Schilling
dataset.

The fourth dataset was collected specifically for this study from
four publications: Impens et al. (2012); Gerencer and Burek (2004);
Alvarez et al. (2006) and Nie et al. (2007). The latter contributed
with one cleaved octamer: PKVF'”'FIQA (the asterisk marks

the cleavage site). Furthermore, there are two uncleaved peptides
reported in Nie et al. (2007): RGYCLIINNHNFAK and
KGIIYGTDGQEAPIYELTSQFTGLK. Uncleaved octamers were
created from them by running an eight position long window over,
yielding {RGYCLIIN, GYCLIINN, . . . , INNHNFAK} and
{KGIIYGTD, GIIYGTDG, . . . , TSQFTGLK}. The same process was
applied to all cleavage sites and non-cleaved peptides listed in
Impens et al. (2012). Five octamers (one cleaved and four non-
cleaved) were added from Gerencer and Burek (2004) by taking the
identified cleavage site, shifting two positions toward either side of
the cleavage site and labeling the resulting octamers as non-cleaved.
In a similar fashion, ten octamers (two cleaved and eight non-
cleaved) were added from the publication of Alvarez et al. (2006).
This produced a total of 947 unique octamers, most of which are not
in the other three datasets. We denote this the the Impens dataset.

Some characteristics of the four datasets are summarized in
Table 2. There are a few interesting observations. First, three of the
datasets can be dichotomized by a linear classifier when the standard
orthogonal encoding is used. Second, the rank of the data covariance
matrix, which is the dimension of the subspace occupied by the
data, is equal to the full 152 dimensions for three of the datasets,
but the fourth has less variation. Third, using the OETMAP encod-
ing (Gok and Ozcerit, 2012) does not change the data dimension,
which indicates that the OETMAP encoding (which is binary and
240-dimensional) does not add information compared with the
standard orthogonal encoding.

Some of the datasets overlap and there are some conﬂicts as
listed in Table 3. The 746 and the 1625 datasets overlap a lot since
they were collected from almost the same sources. There are seven
conﬂicts between the 746 and the 1625 dataset. Two of the conflicts
(AEAMSQVT and FRSGVETT) are between inferred cleavage sites
(Poorman et al., 1991) and experimental data (Tozsér et al., 1991).
Three conflicts (GRINVALV, SGVFSVNG and SGVYQLSA) are
different interpretations of weak cleavage (Beck et al., 2001). Two
conﬂicts (AAAMSSAI and ARVLAQAM) originate from conﬂicting

experimental results (Boross et al., 1999; Cameron et al., 1992;
Kadas et al., 2004; Ridky et al., 1998).

The 1625 and Schilling data share 20 octamers, which all come
from vimentin (VIME_HUMAN). There are two conﬂicts: Schilling
and Overall (2008) report two cleavage sites in places where
Shoeman et al. (1990) did not find any cleavage.

The Schilling and Impens datasets overlap a bit. There is one
conﬂict, VEEGIVLG, which is a cleavage site according to Schilling
and Overall (2008) but not according to Impens et al. (2012). The
octamer comes from a heat shock protein (CH60_HUMAN).

3.2 Orthogonal encoding and LSVM
A LSVM was trained on each one of the HIV-1 PR datasets and
tested on the other HIV-1 PR datasets (the training procedure is
described in the Methods section). The results are shown in Table 4.
Table 4 shows that the cross-validation result (underlined) on
the training data is better than the out-of-sample result when the
same data is used as test data, except if there is a large overlap be-
tween the training and test sets. Thus, the cross-validation result is a
poor indicator of out-of-sample test performance. Another observa-
tion is that the two datasets derived from human proteins, the
Schilling and Impens data, seem to be more similar to each other
than to the 746 and 1625 datasets, which contain mostly octamers

The rows show the training data and the columns the test data.
The overlapping sequences (see Table 3) were not removed. The
underlined numbers on the diagonal (i.e. when training and test
data are the same) are the cross-validation AUC values

generated by varying single amino acids in cleaved sequences. The
746 and 1625 datasets have large overlaps. Table 4 also shows that
it is of great importance what data one uses, both for training and
test. The 1625 dataset seems to be the worst to use for training if
one desires to model cleavage in human proteins.

Figure 1 shows the ROC curves for the case when the LSVM
models are tested on the Schilling data and trained on any of the
other three datasets. The differences between the three curves are all
significant with P-values < 0.05. The smallest difference is between
the LSVM trained with the 746 data and the LSVM trained with
the 1625 data. The P-value for this difference is 0.02.

The test datasets were kept the same for all training sets in
Table 4 to be able to compute the P-value for the differences when
the test data are correlated (DeLong et al., 1988). However, there
are overlaps between the dataset (see Table 3), some of which are in
conﬂict, and this can affect the results. The results when the overlap-
ping sequences have been removed from the test data are shown in
Table 5 for reference. Clearly, the overlaps have little or no effect on
the results, except for the 746 and 1625 data that share many
octamers.

3.3 LSVM and Radial Basis Function SVM (RBFSVM)
The Schilling dataset is the only dataset that is not linearly separable
when using the orthogonal encoding. A non-LSVM with radial basis
kernel was therefore trained on this data and the test results
are listed in Table 6, compared with the results with LSVM.
There are no significant differences between the prediction results
achieved with non-LSVM and LSVM (except for the cross-
validation result on the Schilling data itself). This finding is also
confirmed in Section 3.7.

3.4 OETMAP encoding

Gok and Ozcerit (2012) suggested the OETMAP encoding, after
having tried several other encodings, and claimed that it gave
slightly better results. LSVMs (and non-LSVMs) were trained using
this OETMAP encoding instead of the orthogonal encoding. The re-
sults for LSVM are listed in Table 7, which should be compared
with Table 4. There are few significant differences between results
with the orthogonal encoding and the OETMAP encoding, and
none of them are in favor of OETMAP (except the cross-validation
result when the training and test data are the same).

3.5 GP encoding

Nanni and Lumini (2009) try several encodings and also combine
models with different features. Two of their best encodings for single
LSVM models are denoted GP1 and GP2, which were found using
GP. They claim that these new features are better than the standard
orthogonal encoding but the differences are small and most likely

insignificant. For example, the GP1 and GP2 features are identical
when only one LSVM model is used (this is at least how their code
works). However, the performance difference between GP1 and
GP2 with one LSVM are similar to those between GP1/GP2 and the
orthogonal encoding (Nanni and Lumini, 2009), i.e. the difference is
probably due to random ﬂuctuation.

Table 8 lists the AUC results when the GP1 features are used as
encoding. The results are significantly worse than the orthogonal
encoding in five cases and significantly better in one case. The sig-
nificance level is set to 0.05 and it is not unlikely that there are occa-
sional ‘significant’ results when doing several comparisons as in this
case. Hence, there is no evidence that the features selected with GP
are better than the standard orthogonal encoding, rather the
opposite.

It is worth noting that Nanni and Lumini (2009) used LSVMs
‘without any kind of parameter optimization’ (sic), i.e. they used the
same default C value all the time, regardless of input encoding.

3.6 Comparison with HIVcleave

The four HIV-1 PR datasets were submitted to the cleavage server
HIVcleave (Shen and Chou, 2008). The AUC values for the
HIVcleave predictions were: 0.929 (on the 746 data); 0.891 (on the
1625 data); 0.753 (on the Schilling data) and 0.687 (on the Impens
data). These results are not competitive with the best prediction re-
sults for any of the datasets. The 746 dataset overlaps significantly
with the data used to construct the HIVcleave server.

3.7 Combining datasets

The factor that influences the prediction accuracy the most is the
data used for training. The four HIV-1 PR datasets were therefore
combined in the following seven ways:

1. The 746 data and the 1625 data were joined. The conﬂicts
AEAMSQVT and FRSGVETT were set to cleaved. The conﬂicts
GRINVALV, SGVFSVNG, SGVYQLSA, AAAMSSAI and
ARVLAQAM were removed as ‘uncertain’. This gave a dataset
with 1707 unique octamers: 420 cleaved and 1287 non-cleaved.

2. The 1707 dataset (earlier) was joined with the Schilling dataset.
The two conﬂicts EENFAVEA and QEEMLQRE were set to
cleaved. This produced a dataset with 4959 unique octamers:
854 cleaved and 4105 non-cleaved.

3. The 1707 dataset (earlier) was joined with the Impens dataset.
This gave 2654 unique octamers: 569 cleaved and 2085 non-
cleaved.

4. The 746 data were joined with the Impens data. This produced a
dataset with 1693 unique octamers: 551 cleaved and 1142 non-
cleaved.

5. The 746 data were joined with the Schilling data. This gave
4018 unique octamers: 836 cleaved and 3182 non-cleaved.

6. The 1625 data were joined with the Impens data. This gave
2572 unique octamers: 524 cleaved and 2048 non-cleaved.

7. The 1625 data were joined with the Schilling data. The two con-
ﬂicts EENFAVEA and QEEMLQRE were set to cleaved. This
produced a dataset with 4877 unique octamers: 809 cleaved and
4068 non-cleaved.

The test results when training LSVMs and non-LSVMs with
these datasets are listed in Table 9, which should be compared with
Table 4. The results show two things. First, they confirm that there
is no need to use a non-LSVM instead of a LSVM. Secondly, adding
the 746 data to the Schilling or Impens datasets tends to improve the
out-of—sample prediction, whereas adding the 1625 data tends to de-
teriorate the out-of-sample prediction.

The problem with the 1625 dataset is visible also in Table 4 and
Figure 1. The main difference between the 746 and the 1625 data
are the non-cleaved octamers so this is probably where the problem
lies.

3.8 Cleaving human proteins
The cleavage server PROSPER is designed to handle full-length pro-
teins. The majority of the human proteins in Impens et al. (2012) are
not in the Schilling dataset and are not referenced in the PROSPER
publication, these proteins could therefore serve as out-of—sample
test for PROSPER. The proteins listed in Impens et al. (2012) were
submitted, in FASTA format, to the PROSPER cleavage server (in
September 2014). The same proteins were also cut up into octamers
and submitted to the LSVM predictors described earlier: one trained
with the 746 + Schilling data and another trained with the
746 + 1625 + Schilling data. The predictions were then compared.
The PROSPER server is restrictive with predicting cleavage. For
a fair comparison were the LSVM predictors thresholded to yield a
lowest specificity that equaled the PROSPER lowest specificity on
the Impens dataset, i.e. they should have specificities above 0.89.
The results from predicting cleavage in the 148 cleaved peptides
listed in Impens et al. (2012) are shown in Table 10. The LSVM pre-
dictor trained with the 746 + Schilling data is better than the other
two. This model predicts the peptides to be cleaved in 29% of the
cases and gets the cleavage position perfectly right in almost 20% of
the cases; it is also less off than the other methods in those cases
when the cleavage position is not perfectly right. The PROSPER

Impens et al. (2012). The first column shows which model that was
used. The second column, labeled 'Perfectly corr.', shows how
often the peptides were predicted to be cleaved and the predicted
cleavage site matched the experimental location exactly. The third
column, labeled 'Ave. pos. off', shows how many positions off, on
average, the predicted cleavage site was when a peptide was pre-
dicted to be cleaved but the location did not match exactly. The
fourth and rightmost column shows how often no cleavage was
predicted in the peptides

server is second best. Combining the 1625 data with the other data
worsens the performance.

4 Conclusions and discussion

The experiments show that the LSVM with standard orthogonal
encoding is the hitherto best model for predicting cleavage by HIV-1
protease. They also show that the training data is the most import-
ant factor for the performance, and that there seem to be some prob-
lems in the 1625 data published by Kontijevskis et al. (2007). We
also suggest a few corrections to the data published by Schilling and
Overall (2008).

The best training data were those that had been derived from
human proteins, e.g. the data collected by Schilling and Overall
(2008) and Impens et al. (2012). This is not surprising; the earlier
data were to a large extent collected by point mutations in short
peptides, which is a biased and limited sampling of the sample space,
as discussed in Rognvaldsson et al. (2007). Future predictors of
HIV-1 protease cleavage should build on data collected like the
Schilling and the Impens data.

No evidence was found that more advanced feature encoding
and selection schemes yield better out-of-sample results than using
the standard orthogonal encoding without feature selection.
Unfortunately, many published results on this topic are difficult to
reproduce. Software was downloaded or requested in the cases this
was offered but it turned out to be problematic to reproduce the re-
sults also in some of those cases, for various reasons. In two cases,
the OETMAP and the GP1 encodings, the methods were available
for straightforward use. In those cases, using the new feature encod-
ing was not better than the standard orthogonal encoding. The facts
that the feature selection papers build on cross-validation, which is
shown to be a poor indicator of out-of-sample performance in this
case, and the observed differences are small, also supports the con-
clusion that standard orthogonal encoding is at least as good as
other schemes.

There may be significant effects from using different feature
encodings and feature selection methods when evaluated on a par-
ticular dataset. However, these effects are then small and drown in
comparison with the effect of using a different dataset that has been
collected in a different way.

The data used in this study are available at the UCI machine
learning data repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/mll) and re-
searchers are recommended to use this data when doing proper out-
of-sample testing and method development for this problem.

T.Ro'gnvaldsson et al.

 

The prediction from the LSVM with standard orthogonal encod-
ing was compared with the best currently available cleavage servers:
HIVcleave and PROSPER. The LSVM outperformed HIVcleave by
a wide margin. The comparison with PROSPER was done using
only full-length substrates, since this is what it is designed for, but
also in this case was the LSVM better.

The finding that the LSVM is the best predictor is in line with
the discussion in Rognvaldsson et al. (2007). The character of a pro-
tease cleavage problem agrees well with a linear classifier with or-
thogonal encoding. This could also mean that other viral and non-
viral protease cleavage problems are linear (or close to linear) when
orthogonal encoding is used.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Next-generation sequencing is rapidly becoming the
approach of choice for transcriptional analysis experiments.
Substantial advances have been achieved in computational
approaches to support these technologies. These approaches typic-
ally rely on existing transcript annotations, introducing a bias towards
known genes, require specific experimental design and computational
resources, or focus only on identification of splice variants (ignoring
other biologically relevant transcribed features contained within the
data that may be important for downstream analysis). Biologically rele-
vant transcribed features also include large and small non-coding
RNA, new transcription start sites, alternative promoters, RNA editing
and processing of coding transcripts. Also, many existing solutions
lack accessible interfaces required for wide scale adoption. We
present a user-friendly, rapid and computation-efficient feature anno-
tation framework (RNA-eXpress) that enables identification of tran-
scripts and other genomic and transcriptional features independently
of current annotations. RNA-eXpress accepts mapped reads in the
standard binary alignment (BAM) format and produces a
study-specific feature annotation in GTF format, comparison statistics,
sequence extraction and feature counts. The framework is designed to
be easily accessible while allowing advanced users to integrate new
feature-identification algorithms through simple class extension, thus
facilitating expansion to novel feature types or identification of
study-specific feature types.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technol-
ogy have revolutionized many aspects of biology. Applications
range from genomic and metagenomic projects through to wide
scale condition-speciﬁc whole transcriptome sequence Wang
et al., 2009). Within the ﬁeld of whole transcriptome sequencing,
the primary beneﬁt over traditional microarray is the capacity to
read all expressed transcripts, yielding unbiased highly sensitive

measurements, without the dependence on prior knowledge to
specify probes. This capacity facilitates the discovery and quan-
tiﬁcation of novel genes, splice variants and non-coding RNAs in
addition to known features.

The present challenge lies in extracting all biologically mean-
ingful information from the vast amounts of data produced by
NGS in a time- and resource-efﬁcient manner. The assignment of
biological signiﬁcance relies on identiﬁcation of transcriptional
features, their analysis and quantitation of induced changes in
expression. Many NGS studies reveal expressed features that are
not annotated in the reference genomes, either because they
are novel genes, transcripts or splice variants, or because they
are composed of reads from precursor transcripts or intronic
regions. Whole transcriptome analysis initially relies upon
either prior knowledge of the genome for direct mapping or
computationally and sequencing intensive de-novo transcript as-
sembly (using tools such as TranABySS and Cases). Although
comprehensive, these transcript reconstruction techniques are
dependent on speciﬁc experimental designs, thus limiting appli-
cation. Current genome-guided techniques for feature identiﬁca-
tion range from considering only gene annotation databases
through to transcript assembly based on novel gene and splice
variant identiﬁcation directly from read information (such as
performed with Scripture and Cufﬂinks) (Guttman et al., 2010;
Trapnell et al., 2012). Although these features may identify novel
splice variants, other transcribed features such as upstream tran-
scribed regions, introns, downstream UTR regions and unpro-
cessed RNA may not be considered. Although understanding the
transcriptional response of protein-coding genes is critical, iden-
tifying and understanding the additional transcribed features can
also provide signiﬁcant insights into the regulatory controls and
networks induced in the condition of study. Although present
in many NGS datasets, this information is not widely analysed,
thus excluding potentially important biologically relevant
information.

In this light, we developed RNA-eXpress, a user-friendly com-
putationally efﬁcient analysis approach to perform ﬂexible fea-
ture annotation, comparison, sequence extraction and read
counting using NGS data from any experimental condition.

2 APPROACH

Algorithms have been implemented within the RNA-eXpress
framework to enable efﬁcient identiﬁcation of splice variants,
transcription start sites, UTRs, introns and non-coding RNA
features from BAM-formatted next-generation sequencing data.

The analysis process used by RNA-eXpress involves six
phases: data import and conversion, sample merging, algorithm

execution, and optionally external GT F comparison, sequence
extraction and read counting. Comprehensive description of
these stages, parameters required and output ﬁles are available
in the user manual. Results at each stage are produced as inde-
pendent output ﬁles, in standard formats providing ﬂexibility to
commence, complete and repeat analysis at any phase of the
pipeline (Fig. l).

The RNA-eXpress workﬂow is designed to accept input data
in the standard BAM ﬁle format (Stage 1). Alternatively
read-independent coverage information may also be imported
in the WIG or BED formats. Regardless of input format, any
number of samples or experimental conditions may be processed
simultaneously. When identifying features, coverage is taken
additively across samples from the same genome and merged
to yield a maximal set of features (Stage 2). This merged coverage
data structure represents the input for transcribed feature iden-
tiﬁcation in the algorithm execution stage (Stage 3).

The algorithm class responsible for identifying features is
designed to be easily extendable to implement additional feature
identiﬁcation algorithms while leveraging the GUI, threading
and ﬁle workﬂow management capabilities provided by
RNA-eXpress. Developers are encouraged to submit veriﬁed
algorithms to the public algorithm repository. Multiple feature
identiﬁcation algorithms are already implemented with detailed
descriptions of their intended usage available in the user manual.
Brieﬂy, the Transcripts algorithm provides comprehensive tran-
script identiﬁcation even in complex mammalian genomes, the
TSS algorithm predicts transcription start sites and UTR
algorithm speciﬁcally identiﬁes expressed 3’-UTRs to facilitate
downstream miRNA-binding site prediction analysis.

To enable users to incorporate existing annotation informa-
tion, an optional GTF merging stage involves comparison of
identiﬁed features to an externally provided GTF ﬁle (Stage 4).
At the completion of this stage, RNA-eXpress provides summary
statistics, histograms and pie charts to facilitate comparison as-
sessments and novel feature quantiﬁcation. As ﬁnal, optional

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The RNA-eXpress algorithms are implemented in fully
object-oriented Java using the Samtools Java library (Li et al.,
2009). The feature identiﬁcation phase is implemented using the
Java threading model to take full advantage of the available
processors.

Comprehensive testing has yielded excellent results on both
desktop computers and 32 core 100 GB RAM cluster nodes.
A whole transcriptome experiment of nine samples of ~500 mil-
lion reads each can be analysed on the desktop machine in <5 h.
This includes feature comparison and merging with the complete
Ensembl database followed by exon sequence extraction and fea-
ture counting. This time can be reduced to ~3 h in the cluster
environment. This transcript algorithm compares favourably
with existing Cufﬂinks and Scripture algorithms with respect to
memory usage (2 Gb cf. to 6Gb) and feature identiﬁcation
(Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1), with a number of novel
features validated using RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 2). In
addition RNA-eXpress provides signiﬁcant advantages in run
duration (5—10x faster), is capable of running on a desktop ma-
chine and provides greater ﬂexibility and functionality than the
existing solutions (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1).

RNA-eXpress is freely available open source software with
code, JAVA documentation and updates available. Example
datasets with accompanying analysis tutorials are also available
for download from the website. The authors welcome and
encourage contributions to this open source project.

4 CONCLUSIONS

RNA-eXpress provides a method for extraction of the full detail
contained within whole transcriptome next-generation sequen-
cing experiments, thus facilitating comprehensive hypothesis-free
analysis and knowledge extraction from these extensive datasets.
The combination of a user-friendly GUI and low computational
requirements makes RNA-eXpress accessible to the majority of
users. The J ava-based implementation ensures cross platform
support and simple installation. With the growing availability
of NGS datasets in novel conditions and species, RNA-
eXpress provides a computational solution that is unbiased,
usable and extensible.

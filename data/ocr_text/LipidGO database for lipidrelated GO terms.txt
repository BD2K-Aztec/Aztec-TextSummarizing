ABSTRACT

Motivation: Lipid, an essential class of biomolecules, is receiving
increasing attention in the research community, especially with the
development of analytical technique like mass spectrometry. Gene
Ontology (GO) is the de facto standard function annotation scheme
for gene products. Identification of both explicit and implicit lipid-
related GO terms will help lipid research in many ways, e.g. assigning
lipid function in protein function prediction.

Results: We have constructed a Web site ‘LipidGO’ that facilitates
browsing and searching lipid-related GO terms. An expandable hier-
archical GO tree is constructed that allows users to find lipid-related
GO terms easily. To support large-scale analysis, a user is able to
upload a list of gene products or a list of GO terms to find out
which of them is lipid related. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness
of ‘LipidGO’ by two applications: (i) identifying lipid-related gene
products in model organisms and (ii) discovering potential novel
lipid-related molecular functions

Availability and implementation: LipidGO is available at http://comp
bio.ddns.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7elipidgo/index.php.

Supplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Lipid and their metabolites are essential in many processes in
biology like energy homeostasis, signaling, neurobiology, infec-
tious diseases and so forth. The development of analytical tech-
nique like mass spectrometry gives rise to the ﬁeld of lipidomics
ONenk et al., 2005). An important goal in lipidomics research is
to identify genes and proteins involved in lipid synthesis, metab-
olism and other relevant processes. As with other subﬁeld of
biology, lipid researchers are primarily interested in elucidating
functions of gene products. The Gene Ontology (GO)
(Ashburner et al., 2000) is the most widely used control vocabu-
lary in functional annotation of genes products, and it is being
widely used by wet lab researchers and bioinformaticians alike.
Thus, the identiﬁcation of lipid-related GO terms can facilitate
lipid research, either directly or with other bioinformatics tool
involving GO terms. For example, lipid-related GO terms were

used to identify novel lipid-associated complexes involved in
cancer progression (Goh et al., 2013).

GO consists of three independent subontologies: biological
process (BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function
(MF). G0 is a directed acyclic graph with multiple inheritance
property. In GO, there are several relationship types. However,
in the LipidGO project, where the focus is on the lipid-related-
ness property, only ‘is-a’ relationship is considered. More on
term relationship is elaborated in the appendix and in the docu-
mentation section of our Web site

The lipid-related GO terms in LipidGO are discovered by
curation and computational approach. Detailed procedures
and issues are given in Section 3. All the lipid-related GO
terms found are subject to stringent predeﬁned curation rules.
The rules can be found in the documentation at our Web site or
appendix. In our Web site, the following notations are used to
describe class labels of GO terms: ‘BP+’ for lipid-related BP
terms, ‘BP—’ for non—lipid-related BP terms and ‘BP?’ for BP
terms whose lipid relatedness has not been examined by a cur-
ator. Similar notations are deﬁned for CC terms (CC—l—, CC—,
CC?) and MF terms (MF+, MF—, MF?). We will talk about the
unknown class labels in Section 3.

2 DATABASE AND FEATURES

2.1 Browse function

An expandable hierarchical GO tree (Fig. l) is constructed.
It allows users to ﬁnd lipid-related GO terms easily. The struc-
ture of the tree is reﬂected in the indentation, with lower-level
(more speciﬁc) terms indented to the right. By default only the
root node and its children are shown. Users need to click the
expand button () or collapse button (El) to unfold/fold the tree.
Leaf nodes (0) cannot be expanded. As our focus is on lipid-
related terms, we make them easier to be spotted in two ways:
ﬁrst, the term is bold if it is lipid-related; second, for each GO
term, the number of lipid-related terms in the subtree rooted at
that term is indicated inside a square bracket ‘[]’. To help users
obtain more information, internal link (GOzxxxxxxx itself) and
external link (ﬂ) to the ofﬁcial GO browser Amigo (Carbon
et al., 2009) are provided. Furthermore, if a user does not
agree with the class label of a particular term, he or she can
give a comment by clicking the comment balloon ( ). We wel-
come feedbacks so that we can make better classiﬁcation of GO
terms in terms of lipid relatedness. Instead of browsing in

hierarchical format, ﬁat lists of lipid-related GO terms are avail-
able for viewing or downloading. The number of lipid-related
GO terms are relatively small (4674 terms among a total of
37462 terms for the April 2013 version of GO), and they are
usually near the bottom of the GO hierarchy. Therefore, clicking
the expand button at higher level nodes several times are required
to reveal lipid-related terms. For those interested, the number of
lipid-related GO terms for each subontology can also be found
on the browse page of the Web site.

2.2 Search function

Users are able to search in two ways. Searching by key words will
return the list of GO terms whose term or deﬁnition contains
that phrase. Searching by GO accession number will give detailed
information about the term and its related gene products. Users
are able to download the GO subtree rooted at a term and see
which branches are lipid related.

2.3 Batch query function

All the lipid-related gene products can be downloaded on the
batch query page of our Web site. Moreover, users are able to
upload a list of gene products to ﬁnd out which of them is lipid
related and what the associated lipid-related GO terms are. The
users are also able to upload a list of GO terms to identify the
ones that are lipid related.

2.4 Applications

Here, we provide two applications; for more details and down-
load, please visit application page on our Web site. The data
sources for both applications (gene product, annotation informa-
tion) are obtained from the ofﬁcial GO database.

2.4.1 Lipid-related gene products in model organisms In recent
years, lipid research is being carried out extensively in many
model organisms. There are a few questions frequently asked
by lipid researchers: What percentage of gene products in the
studied genome are lipid related, what these gene products are
and so on. Given a comprehensive list of lipid-related GO terms,
the above questions can be answered using GO annotations. We
have calculated the percentage of lipid-related gene products in
several major genomes and prepared lists of lipid-related genes
for users to download.

2.4.2 Discovering novel lipid-related molecular functions Because
a BP is a series of events accomplished by one or more ordered
assemblies of molecular functions, gene products that participate
in a lipid-related BP are likely to have some sort of lipid-related
molecular function. In other words, gene products annotated to
some BP+ terms but not annotated to any MF+ term yet are
likely to have some undiscovered MF+ function. Thus, based on
these gene products and their associated GO terms, a hypothesis

can be formulated by an expert lipid biologist where these gene
products are predicted to have certain lipid-related molecular
functions, which can be validated by wet lab research. We
have predicted such gene products for user to download. For
more information, please check our Web site or appendix.

3 DISCUSSION

Because of the sheer number (~40 000 as of April 2013) and
speciﬁcity of GO terms, giving each GO term a lipid-related or
non-lipid-related label is a non-trivial task, especially if per-
formed manually. To overcome the issue, we adopt the following
incremental expansion strategy. With the help of an expert cur-
ator on lipid, we obtained a list of high-quality manually curated
lipid-related terms and non—lipid-related terms as the initial gold
standard (GO version: June 2009). The observation that GO
terms annotated to similar sets of gene products are likely to
be correlated (Lord et al., 2003) make it possible for us to de-
velop a machine learning method that can be used to expand the
list of lipid-related terms from the gold standard. Those terms
predicted most likely to be lipid related were examined by a
human curator following the curation rules (which is available
at the Web site or in the appendix) so that the class labels could
be conﬁrmed. The procedure was repeated until no more lipid-
related terms were found. The rest of the terms, likely to be non—
lipid-related, were not manually examined and were assigned the
class label ‘unknown’. For those terms with the class label ‘un-
known’, there could be some missed lipid-related terms (i.e. false
negatives). We did sample one hundred terms randomly but no
hit was found (GO version: April 2013).

4 CONCLUSION

LipidGO serves as a platform allowing lipid researchers to get
information about lipid-related GO terms and gene products.
The usefulness of lipid-related GO terms is demonstrated in
the applications given earlier in the text, and we believe there is
much more, especially when used in conjunction with other
bioinformatics tools.

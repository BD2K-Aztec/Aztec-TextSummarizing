ABSTRACT

Summary: Antibodies are rapidly becoming essential tools in the clin-
ical practice, given their ability to recognize their cognate antigens with
high specificity and affinity, and a high yield at reasonable costs in
model animals. Unfortunately, when administered to human patients,
xenogeneic antibodies can elicit unwanted and dangerous immuno-
genic responses. Antibody humanization methods are designed to
produce molecules with a better safety profile still maintaining their
ability to bind the antigen. This can be accomplished by grafting the
non-human regions determining the antigen specificity into a suitable
human template. Unfortunately, this procedure may results in a partial
or complete loss of affinity of the grafted molecule that can be restored
by back-mutating some of the residues of human origin to the corres-
ponding murine ones. This trial-and-error procedure is hard and in-
volves expensive and time-consuming experiments. Here we present
tools for antibody humanization (l'abhu) a web server for antibody
humanization. Tabhu includes tools for human template selection,
grafting, back-mutation evaluation, antibody modelling and structural
analysis, helping the user in all the critical steps of the humanization
experiment protocol.

1 INTRODUCTION

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are an important class of thera-
peutic molecules. The high speciﬁcity and afﬁnity towards their
respective antigens, their modular structure that facilitates their
engineering and the relative low costs for their production in
model animals makes them excellent drug candidates against
several diseases (Chames et al., 2009; Reichert, 2012).

However, together with all these desirable characteristics,
xenogeneic mAbs have drawbacks that limit their therapeutic
beneﬁts and can ultimately endanger the patients’ health
(Hansel et al., 2010; Hwang and Foote, 2005). To overcome
these hurdles, different methods have been developed for increas-
ing the mAbs ‘degree of humanness’ (Abhinandan and Martin,
2007) by replacing parts of the original non-human antibody

with the corresponding human counterparts. This process is
generally referred as ‘humanization’ and takes advantage of the
particular architecture of the antibody molecule (Alrnagro and
F ransson, 2008; Padlan, 1994). The molecules generated by such
humanization procedures may partially or completely lose afﬁn-
ity for their intended antigen; this can be usually restored by re-
introducing speciﬁc and case-dependent native residues in the
humanized molecule through an experimental trial-and-error
procedure going under the name of ‘back-mutation’ phase.
Taking advantage of our experience in antibody sequence and
structure analysis (Chailyan et al., 2011; Ghiotto et al., 2011;
Marcatili et al., 2013), we developed Tools for AntiBody
Humanization (Tabhu), a comprehensive platform meant to
help antibody humanization experiments. Tabhu integrates
different methods to guide researchers through several steps of
the humanization cycle, from the selection of a suitable human
acceptor molecule to the evaluation of the back-mutations effect.

2 DESCRIPTION

The initial input page of Tabhu requires the sequence of the light
and heavy chain variable domains (VL and VH, respectively;
Padlan, 1994) of the xenogeneic antibody to be humanized
(native Ab) and the antigen volume since the latter can be used
to improve the prediction of the residues involved in antigen
recognition (Olimpieri et al., 2013). Tabhu uses two alternative
sources of human sequences to choose the framework donor with
the highest sequence similarity to the xenogeneic V region: a
database consisting of both light and heavy chain sequences
retrieved from the Digit database (Chailyan et al., 2012) or
human germline gene sequences compiled by IMGT (Giudicelli
et al., 2005) from which the user can select the Variable and
Joining genes, that are eventually assembled together with the
mouse complementarity determining regions (CDRs) to form the
initial acceptor molecule. Tabhu lists the possible templates and
shows relevant information for each of them.

Once a receiving framework has been selected, the server starts
an antibody humanization procedure that resembles what is usu-
ally done experimentally and involves four steps: (i) loop graft-
ing, (ii) estimate of the binding mode similarity between the
native and human antibody, (iii) back-mutations and (iv) re-
evaluation of the binding mode similarity between input and
humanized antibody (Supplementary Material, Supplementary
Figure $1).

The ﬁrst step consists of grafting the xenogeneic CDRs into
the human framework. The evaluation of the expected similarity

Tabhu: tools for antibody humanization

 

of the binding mode is based on the proABC method that we
have previously developed (Olimpieri et al., 2013), that predicts
the probability that every single antibody residue is involved in
antigen recognition taking into account the entire sequence of the
variable domains. If the pattern of interaction is very different
between the input and humanized sequence, it can be expected
that the resulting binding mode, and most likely the afﬁnity, will
be different. More details on the formula used to evaluate indi-
vidual back-mutation importance are reported as Supplementary
Material.

Once the user selects which residues to back-mutate and sub-
mits them to the system, a new variant is generated and the
process can be repeated. However, the introduction of mutations
in the human antibody can lead to structural problems, such as
the appearance of clashes or cavities in the modelled humanized
antibody. Taking advantage of our antibody structure prediction
tools (Chailyan et al., 2011; Marcatili et al., 2008), upon user
request, Tabhu builds the three-dimensional models of the mouse
and humanized antibodies, runs the procheck and EDTSurf
tools (Laskowski et al., 1996; Xu and Zhang, 2009) and alerts
the user if the introduction of a back-mutation generates clashes
or cavities, that the user can ignore or use as a guide to remove or
introduce additional back-mutations.

When the desired binding mode similarity between the xeno-
geneic and humanized antibody has been achieved the user can
ﬁnalize the model and retrieve the three-dimensional model of
the parental antibody, the amino acid sequence of the selected
human template, the contact probabilities of the humanized anti-
body, the amino acid sequence of the ﬁnal redesigned antibody
and a back-translated nucleotide sequence optimized for being
expressed in a number of organisms. Supplementary Material,
Supplementary File S1 reports an example of antibody human-
ization with Tabhu.

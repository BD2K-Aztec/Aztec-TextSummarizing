ABSTRACT
Motivation: High-throughput data is providing a comprehensive
view of the molecular changes in cancer tissues. New technologies
allow for the simultaneous genome-wide assay of the state of
genome copy number variation, gene expression, DNA methylation
and epigenetics of tumor samples and cancer cell lines. Analyses of
current data sets find that genetic alterations between patients can
differ but often involve common pathways. It is therefore critical to
identify relevant pathways involved in cancer progression and detect
how they are altered in different patients.
Results: We present a novel method for inferring patient-specific
genetic activities incorporating curated pathway interactions among
genes. A gene is modeled by a factor graph as a set of interconnected
variables encoding the expression and known activity of a gene
and its products, allowing the incorporation of many types of omic
data as evidence. The method predicts the degree to which a
pathway’s activities (e.g. internal gene states, interactions or high-
Ievel ‘outputs’) are altered in the patient using probabilistic inference.
Compared with a competing pathway activity inference approach
called SPIA, our method identifies altered activities in cancer-related
pathways with fewer false-positives in both a glioblastoma multiform
(GBM) and a breast cancer dataset. PARADIGM identified consistent
pathway-level activities for subsets of the GBM patients that are
overlooked when genes are considered in isolation. Further, grouping
GBM patients based on their significant pathway perturbations
divides them into clinically-relevant subgroups having significantly
different survival outcomes. These findings suggest that therapeutics
might be chosen that target genes at critical points in the commonly
perturbed pathway(s) of a group of patients.

1 INTRODUCTION

A central premise in modern cancer treatment is that patient
diagnosis, prognosis, risk assessment and treatment response
prediction can be improved by stratiﬁcation of cancers based on
genomic, transcriptional and epi genomic characteristics of the tumor
alongside relevant clinical information gathered at the time of
diagnosis (e.g. patient history, tumor histology and stage) as well
as subsequent clinical follow—up data (e.g. treatment regimens

and disease recurrence events). While several high—throughput
technologies have been available for probing the molecular details
of cancer, only a handful of successes have been achieved based on
this paradigm. For example, 25 % of breast cancer patients presenting
with a particular ampliﬁcation or overexpression of the ERBB2
growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase can now be treated with
trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the receptor (Vogel
et al., 2001). However, even this success story is clouded by the fact
that <50% of patients with ERBB2—positive breast cancers actually
achieve any therapeutic beneﬁt from trastuzumab, emphasizing our
incomplete understanding of this well—studied oncogenic pathway
and the many therapeutic—resistant mechanisms intrinsic to ERBB2—
positive breast cancers (Park et al., 2008). This overall failure to
translate modern advances in basic cancer biology is in part due to
our inability to comprehensively organize and integrate all of the
omic features now technically acquirable on virtually any type of
cancer. Despite overwhelming evidence that histologically similar
cancers are in reality a composite of many molecular subtypes, each
with signiﬁcantly different clinical behavior, this knowledge is rarely
applied in practice due to the lack of robust signatures that correlate
well with prognosis and treatment options.

Cancer is a disease of the genome that is associated with aberrant
alterations that lead to disregulation of the cellular system. What is
not clear is how genomic changes feed into genetic pathways that
underlie cancer phenotypes. High—throughput functional genomics
investigations have made tremendous progress in the past decade
(Alizadeh et al., 2000; Golub et al., 1999; van de Vijver et al.,
2002). However, the challenges of integrating multiple data sources
to identify reproducible and interpretable molecular signatures of
tumorigenesis and progression remain elusive. Recent pilot studies
by TCGA and others (Parsons et al., 2008; TCGA, 2008) make it
clear that a pathway—level understanding of genomic perturbations
is needed to understand the changes observed in cancer cells.
These ﬁndings demonstrate that even when patients harbor genomic
alterations or aberrant expression in different genes, these genes
often participate in a common pathway. In addition, and even
more striking, is that the alterations observed (e. g. deletions versus
ampliﬁcations) often alter the pathway output in the same direction,
either all increasing or all decreasing the pathway activation.

Approaches for interpreting genome—wide cancer data have
focused on identifying gene expression proﬁles that are highly
correlated with a particular phenotype or disease state, and have
led to promising results (Allison et al., 2006; Dudoit and Fridlyand,
2002; Tusher et al., 2001). Methods using analysis of variance
(Kerr et al., 2000), false—discovery (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003)
and non—parametric methods (Troyanskaya et al., 2002) have been
proposed.

Several pathway—level approaches use statistical tests based on
overrepresentation of genesets to detect whether a pathway is
perturbed in a disease condition. In these approaches, genes are
ranked based on their degree of differential activity, for example, as
detected by either differential expression or copy number alteration.
A probability score is then assigned reﬂecting the degree to which a
pathway’s genes rank near the extreme ends of the sorted list, such
as is used in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian
et al., 2005). Other approaches include using a hypergeometric test—
based method to identify Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000)
or MIPS mammalian protein—protein interaction (Pagel et al., 2005)
categories enriched in differentially expressed genes (Tamayo et al.,
1999).

Overrepresentation analyses are limited in their efﬁcacy because
they do not incorporate known interdependencies among genes in a
pathway that can increase the detection signal for pathway relevance.
In addition, they treat all gene alterations as equal, which is not
expected to be valid for many biological systems. Because of these
factors, overrepresentation analyses often miss functionally—relevant
pathways whose genes have borderline differential activity. They can
also produce many false positives when only a single gene is highly
altered in a small pathway.

Our collective knowledge about the detailed interactions between
genes and their phenotypic consequences is growing rapidly. While
the knowledge was traditionally scattered throughout the literature
and hard to access systematically, new efforts are cataloging pathway
knowledge into publicly available databases. Some of the databases
that include pathway topology are Reactome (Joshi—Tope et al.,
2005), KEGG (Ogata et al., 1999), and the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) Pathway Interaction Database(PID). Updates to these
databases are expected to improve our understanding of biological
systems by explicitly encoding how genes regulate and communicate
with one another. A key hypothesis is that the interaction topology
of these pathways can be exploited for the purpose of interpreting
high—throughput datasets.

Until recently, few computational approaches were available
for incorporating pathway knowledge to interpret high—throughput
datasets. However, several newer approaches (Efroni et al., 2007)
have been proposed that incorporate pathway topology. One
approach, called signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) (Tarca
et al., 2009), uses a method analogous to Google’s PageRank
to determine the inﬂuence of a gene in a pathway. In SPIA,
more inﬂuence is placed on genes that link out to many other
genes. SPIA was successfully applied to different cancer datasets
(lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer) and shown to outperform
overrepresentation analysis and GSEA for identifying pathways
known to be involved in these cancers. While SPIA represents a
major step forward in interpreting cancer datasets using pathway
topology, it is limited to using only a single type of genome—wide
data. New computational approaches are needed to connect multiple
genomic alterations such as copy number, DNA methylation,
somatic mutations, mRNA expression and microRNA expression.
Integrated pathway analysis is expected to increase the precision
and sensitivity of causal interpretations for large sets of observations
since no single data source is likely to provide a complete picture
on its own.

In the past several years, approaches in probabilistic graphical
models (PGMs) have been developed for learning causal networks
compatible with multiple levels of observations. Efﬁcient algorithms

are available to learn pathways automatically from data (Friedman
and Goldszmidt, 1997; Murphy et al., 1999) and are well adapted
to problems in genetic network inference (Friedman, 2004). As an
example, graphical models have been used to identify sets of genes
that form ‘modules’ in cancer biology (Segal et al., 2005). They
have also been applied to elucidate the relationship between tumor
genotype and expression phenotypes (Lee et al., 2006), and infer
protein signal networks (Sachs et al., 2005) and recombinatorial
gene regulatory code (Beer and Tavazoie, 2004). In particular, factor
graphs have been used to model expression data (Gat—Viks and
Shamir, 2007; Gat—Viks et al., 2005, 2006).

We describe a PGM framework based on factor graphs
(Kschischang et al., 2001) that can integrate any number of genomic
and functional genomic datasets to infer the molecular pathways
altered in a patient sample. We tested the model using copy number
variation and gene expression data for both a glioblastoma and
breast cancer dataset. The activities inferred using a structured
pathway model successfully stratify the glioblastoma patients into
clinically—relevant subtypes. The results suggest that the pathway—
informed inferences are more informative than using gene—level
data in isolation. In addition to providing better prognostics and
diagnostics, integrated pathway activations offer important clues
about potential therapeutics that could be used to abrogate disease
progression.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources

Breast cancer copy number data from Chin et al. (2007) was obtained from
NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accessions GPL5737 with
associated array platform annotation from GSE8757. Probe annotations were
converted to BED15 format for display in the UCSC Cancer Genomics
Browser (Zhu et al., 2009) and subsequent analysis. Array data were mapped
to probe annotations via probe ID. Matched expression data from Naderi
et al. (2007) was obtained from MIAMIExpress at EBI using accession
number E—UCon—l. Platform annotation information for HumanlA (V2)
was obtained from the Agilent website. Expression data was probe—level
median—normalized and mapped via probe ID to HUGO gene names. All data
were non—parametrically normalized using a ranking procedure including
all sample—probe values and each gene—sample pair was given a signed P—
value based on the rank. A maximal P—value of 0.05 was used to determine
gene—samples pairs that were signiﬁcantly altered. The glioblastoma data
from TCGA (2008) was obtained from the TCGA data portal providing
gene expression for 230 patient samples and 10 adjacent normal tissues
on the Affymetrix U133A platform. The probes for the patient samples
were normalized to the normal tissue by subtracting the median normal
value of each probe. In addition, CBS segmented (Olshen et al., 2004)
copy number data for the same set of patients were obtained. Both datasets
were non—parametrically normalized using the same procedure as the breast
cancer data.

2.2 Pathway compendium

We collected the set of curated pathways available from the (NCI PID)
(Schaefer et al., 2009). Each pathway represents a set of interactions logically
grouped together around high—level biomolecular processes describing
intrinsic and extrinsic sub—cellular—, cellular—, tissue— or organism—level
events and phenotypes. BioPAX (BioPAX working group, 2004) level 2
formatted pathways were downloaded on September 15, 2009. All entities
and interactions were extracted with Simple Protocol and RDF Query
Language (SPARQL) queries using the Rasan RDF engine.

Correlation

Fig. 1. NCI Pathway interactions in TCGA GBM data. For all (n=462)
pairs where A was found to be an upstream activator of gene B in NCI—
Nature Pathway Database, the Pearson correlation (x—axis) computed from
the TCGA GBM data was calculated in two different ways. The histogram
plots the correlations between the A’s copy number and B’s expression (C2E,
solid red) and between A’s expression and B’s expression (E2E, blue). A
histogram of correlations between randomly paired genes is shown for C2E
(dashed red) and E2E (dashed blue). Arrows point to the enrichment of
positive correlations found for the C2E (red) and E2E (blue) correlation.

We extracted ﬁve different types of biological entities including three
physical entities (protein—coding genes, small molecules and complexes),
gene families and abstract processes. A gene family was created whenever
the cross—reference for a BioPAX protein listed proteins from distinct genes.
Gene families represent collections of genes in which any single gene
is sufﬁcient to perform a speciﬁc function. For example, homologs with
redundant roles and genes found to functionally compensate for one another
are combined into families. The extraction produced a list of every entity and
interaction used in the pathway with annotations describing their different
types. We also extracted abstract processes, such as ‘apoptosis,’ that refer
to general processes that can be found in the NCI collection. For example,
pathways detailing the interactions involving the p53 tumor suppressor gene
include links into apoptosis and senescence that can be leveraged as features
for machine—leaming classiﬁcation.

One hypothesis of pathway—based approaches is that the genetic
interactions found in pathway databases carry information for interpreting
correlations between gene expression changes detected in cancer. For
example, if a cancer—related pathway includes a link from a transcriptional
activator A to a target gene T, we expect the expression of A to be positively
correlated with the expression of T (E2E correlation). Likewise, we also
expect a positive correlation between A’s copy number and T’s expression
(C2E correlation). Further, we expect C2E correlation to be weaker than
E2E correlation because ampliﬁcation in A does not necessarily imply A is
expressed at higher levels, which in turn is necessary to upregulate B. In this
way, each link in a pathway provides an expectation about the data; pathways
with many consistent links may be relevant for further consideration. We
tested these assumptions and found that the NCI pathways contain many
interactions predictive of the recent TCGA GBM data (The TCGA research
network 2008) (Fig. 1). As expected, C2E correlations were moderate,
but had a striking enrichment for positive correlations among activating
interactions than expected by chance (Fig. 1). E2E correlations were even
stronger and similarly enriched. Thus, even in this example of a cancer
that has eluded characterization, a signiﬁcant subset of pathway interactions

connect genomic alterations to modulations in gene expression, supporting
the idea that a pathway—level approach is worth pursuing.

2.3 PARADIGM model

We developed an approach called PARADIGM (PAthway Recognition
Algorithm using Data Integration on Genomic Models) to infer the activities
of genetic pathways from integrated patient data. Figure 2 illustrates the
overview of the approach. Multiple genome—scale measurements on a single
patient sample are combined to infer the activities of genes, products and
abstract process inputs and outputs for a single NCI pathway. PARADIGM
produces a matrix of integrated pathway activities (IPAs) A where Aij
represents the inferred activity of entity i in patient sample j. The matrix
A can then be used in place of the original constituent datasets to identify
associations with clinical outcomes.

We ﬁrst convert each NCI pathway into a distinct probabilistic model. A
toy example of a small fragment of the p53 apoptosis pathway is shown in
Figure 3. A pathway diagram from NCI was converted into a factor graph
that includes both hidden and observed states. The factor graph integrates
observations on gene— and biological process—related state information with
a structure describing known interactions among the entities.

To represent a biological pathway with a factor graph, we use variables
to describe the states of entities in a cell, such as a particular mRNA or
complex, and use factors to represent the interactions and information ﬂow
between these entities. These variables represent the diﬁerential state of each
entity in comparison with a ‘control’ or normal level rather than the direct
concentrations of the molecular entities. This representation allows us to
model many high—throughput datasets, such as gene expression detected with
DNA microarrays, that often either directly measure the differential state of
a gene or convert direct measurements to measurements relative to matched
controls. It also allows for many types of regulatory relationships among
genes. For example, the interaction describing MDM2 mediating ubiquitin—
dependent degradation of p53 can be modeled as activated MDM2 inhibiting
p53’s protein level.

The factor graph encodes the state of a cell using a random variable
for each entity X = {x1 ,x2, ...,xn} and a set of m non—negative functions, or
factors, that constrain the entities to take on biologically meaningful values as
functions of one another. The j—th factor gbj deﬁnes a probability distribution
over a subset of entities X]- CX. The entire graph of entities and factors
encodes the joint probability distribution over all of the entities as:

1 m
P<X>= 21—M- (Xj), (1)
j=1

where Z =l_[j ZSEXJ- ¢j(S) is a normalization constant and SEX denotes
that S is a ‘setting’ of the variables in X.

Fig. 3. Conversion of a genetic pathway diagram into a PARADIGM model.
A. Data on a single patient is integrated for a single gene using a set of
four different biological entities for the gene describing the DNA copies,
mRNA and protein levels, and activity of the protein. B. PARADIGM
models various types of interactions across genes including transcription
factors to targets (upper—left), subunits aggregating in a complex (upper—
right), post—translational modiﬁcation (lower—left) and sets of genes in a
family performing redundant functions (lower—right). C. Toy example of
a small sub—pathway involving P53, an inhibitor MDM2, and the high level
process, apoptosis as represented in the model.

Each entity can take on one of three states corresponding to activated,
nominal or deactivated relative to a control level (e. g. as measured in normal
tissue) and encoded as 1, 0 or —1 respectively. The states may be interpreted
differently depending on the type of entity (e.g. gene, protein, etc). For
example, an activated mRNA entity represents overexpression, while an
activated genomic copy entity represents more than two copies that are
present in the genome. Figure 3 shows the conceptual model of the factor
graph for a single protein—coding gene. For each protein—coding gene G in the
pathway, entities are introduced to represent the copy number of the genome
(GDNA), mRNA expression (GmRNA), protein level (Gprotein) and protein
activity (Gactive) (ovals labeled ‘DNA’, ‘mRNA’, ‘protein’ and ‘active’ in
Fig. 3). For every compound, protein complex, gene family and abstract
process in the pathway, we include a single variable with molecular type
‘active.’ While the example in Figure 3 shows only one process variable

(‘Apoptosis’), in reality pathways can have several, representing various
descriptions of cellular state ranging from inputs (e.g. ‘DNA damage’) to
outputs (e.g. ‘Apoptosis’ and ‘Senescence’) of gene activity.

In order to simplify the construction of factors, we ﬁrst convert the
pathway into a directed graph, with each edge in the graph labeled with
either positive or negative inﬂuence. First, for every protein coding gene G,
we add edges with a label ‘positive’ from GDNA to GmRNA, from GmRNA
to Gprotein and from Gprotein to Gactive to reﬂect the expression of the gene
from its number of copies to the presence of an activated form of its protein
product. Every interaction in the pathway is converted to a single edge in
the directed graph.

Using this directed graph, we then construct a list of factors to specify
the factor graph. For every variable xi, we add a single factor ¢(X,-), where
X,- = {xi}U{Parents(x,-)} and Parents(x,-) refers to all the parents of x,- in the
directed graph. The value of the factor for a setting of all values is dependent
on whether x,- is in agreement with its expected value due to the settings of
Parents(x,-). For this study, the expected value was set to the majority vote of
the parent variables. If a parent is connected by a positive edge it contributes
a vote of +1 times its own state to the value of the factor. Conversely, if the
parent is connected by a negative edge, then the variable votes —1 times its
own state. The variables connected to x,- by an edge labeled ‘minimum’ get
a single vote, and that vote’s value is the minimum value of these variables,
creating an AND—like connection. Similarly the variables connected to x,- by
an edge labeled ‘maximum’ get a single vote, and that vote’s value is the
maximum value of these variables, creating an OR—like connection. Votes
of zero are treated as abstained votes. If there are no votes the expected
state is zero. Otherwise, the majority vote is the expected state, and a tie
between 1 and —1 results in an expected state of —1 to give more importance
to repressors and deletions.

Given this deﬁnition of expected state, gbl-(xi, Parents(x,-)) is speciﬁed as:

—e x,- is the expected state from Parents(x,-)

I
¢i (xi 7 Parentsw )) _ { g otherwise.

For the results shown here, 6 was set to 0.001, but orders of magnitude
differences in the choice of epsilon did not signiﬁcantly affect results.

Finally, we add observation variables and factors to the factor graph
to complete the integration of pathway and multi—dimensional functional
genomics data (Fig. 3). Each discretized functional genomics dataset is
associated with one of the molecular types of a protein—coding gene. Array
CGH/SNP estimates of copy number alteration are associated with the
‘genome’ type. Gene expression data is associated with the ‘mRNA’ type.
Though not presented in the results here, future expansion will include
DNA methylation data with the ‘mRNA’ type, and proteomics and gene—
resequencing data with the ‘protein’ and ‘active’ types. Each observation
variable is also ternary valued. The factors associated with each observed
type of data are shared across all entities and learned from the data, as
described next.

2.4 Inference and parameter estimation

Let the set of assignments D={x1=sl,x2=sz,...,xk =sk} represent a
complete set of data for a patient on the observed variables indexed 1
through k. Let {S EDX} represent the set of all possible assignments to a
set of variables X that are consistent with the assignments in D; i.e. any
observed variable x,- is ﬁxed to its assignment in D while hidden variables
may vary.

Given patient data, we would like to estimate whether a particular hidden
entity x,- is likely to be in state a. For example, how likely TP53’s protein
activity is —1 (inactivated) or ‘Apoptosis’ is +1 (activated). To do this, we
ﬁrst compute the prior probability of the event prior to observing the patient’s
data. If Ai(a) represents the singleton assignment set {xi 2a} and CD is the
fully speciﬁed factor graph, this prior probability is:

1 m
P(xr=al<1>)= 21—1 2 <1),- (s). (2)

1:1 SEAi(a)Xj

where Z is the normalization constant introduced in Equation (1). Similarly,
the probability that x,- is in state a along with all of the observations made
for the patient is:

m
P(x,-=a,D|CI>)=%H Z ¢j(s). (3)
jZISEAi(a)UDXj

For the majority of pathways, we use the junction tree inference algorithm
with HUGIN updates to infer the probabilities in equations. For pathways
that take longer than 3 s of inference per patient, we use Belief Propagation
with sequential updates, a convergence tolerance of 10‘9, and a maximum of
10 000 iterations. All inference was performed in the real domain, as opposed
to the log domain, and was performed with libDAI (Mooij, 2009).

To learn the parameters of the observation factors we use the expectation—
maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et 01., 1977). Brieﬂy, EM learns
parameters in models with hidden variables by iterating between inferring
the probabilities of hidden variables and changing parameters to maximize
the likelihood given the probabilities of the hidden variables. To perform EM,
we extended the libDAI library; the contributed code is now available as part
of the open source distribution. For each pathway, we created a factor graph
for each patient, applied the patient’s data and ran EM until the likelihood
changed <0.1%. We averaged the parameters learned from each pathway,
and then used these parameters to calculate ﬁnal posterior beliefs for each
variable.

After inference, we output an IPA for each variable that has an ‘active’
molecular type. We compute a log—likelihood ratio using the quantities from
equations 2 and 3 that reﬂects the degree to which a patient’s data increases
our belief that entity i ’s activity is up or down:

' _ P(D, r= |<I>) P( i=a|<1>)
L01“) — 10g(P(D,:r-7é:l<1>)> _10g(P(:l-#al<1>)>
_ P(D| i: 51>)
— 10g(P(DI:l-#:,<I>)>'
We then compute a single IPA for gene i based on the log—likelihood
ratio as:

 

(4)

L(i, 1) L(i,1)>L(i,—1) and L(i,1)>L(i,0)
IPA(i) = —L(i, —1) L(i,—1)>L(i,1) and L(i,—1)>L(i,0) (5)
0 otherwise.
Intuitively, the IPA score is a signed analog of the log—likelihood ratio, L.
If the gene is more likely to be activated, the IPA is set to L. Alternatively, if
the gene is more likely to be inactivated, the IPA is set to —L and 0 otherwise.
Because each pathway is analyzed independently of other pathways, a gene
can be associated with multiple inferences, one for each pathway in which it
appears. Differing inferences for the same gene can be viewed as alternative
interpretations of the data as a function of the gene’s pathway context.

2.5 Signiﬁcance assessment

We assess the signiﬁcance of IPA scores by two different permutations of
the data. For the ‘within’ permutation, a permuted data sample is created by
choosing a new tuple of data (i.e. matched gene expression and gene copy
number) ﬁrst by choosing a random real sample, and then by choosing a
random gene from within the same pathway, until tuples have been chosen
for each gene in the pathway. For the ‘any’ permutation, the procedure is the
same, but the random gene selection step could choose a gene from anywhere
in the genome. For both permutation types, 1000 permuted samples are
created, and the perturbation scores for each permuted sample is calculated.
The distribution of perturbation scores from permuted samples is used as a
null distribution to estimate the signiﬁcance of true samples.

2.6 SPIA

SPIA from Tarca et al. (2009) was implemented in C to reduce runtime
and to be compatible with our analysis environment. We also added the
ability to offer more verbose output so that we could directly compare SPIA
and PARADIGM outputs. Our version of SPIA can output the accumulated
perturbation and the perturbation factor for each entity in the pathway. This
code is available upon request.

2.7 Decoy pathways

A set of decoy pathways was created for each cancer dataset. Each NCI
pathway was used to create a decoy pathway which consisted of the same
structure but where every gene in the pathway was substituted for a random
gene in RefGene. All complexes and abstract processes were kept the same
and the signiﬁcance analysis for both PARADIGM and SPIA was run on the
set of pathways containing both real and decoy pathways. The pathways were
ranked within each method and the fraction of real versus total pathways was
computed and visualized.

2.8 Clustering and Kaplan—Meier analysis

Uncentered correlation hierarchical clustering with centroid linkage was
performed on the glioblastoma data using the methods from Eisen et a].
( 1998). Only IPAs with a signal of at least 0.25 across 75 patient samples were
used in the clustering. By visual inspection, four obvious clusters appeared
and were used in the Kaplan—Meier analysis. The Kaplan—Meier curves were
computed using R and P—values were obtained via the log—rank statistic.

3 RESULTS

To assess the quality of the EM training procedure, we compared
the convergence of EM using the actual patient data relative to a
null dataset in which tuples of gene expression and copy number
(E,C) were permuted across the genes and patients. As expected,
PARADIGM converged much more quickly on the true dataset
relative to the null. As an example, we plotted the IPAs for the
gene AKT1 as a function of the EM iteration (Fig. 4). One can see
that the activities quickly converge in the ﬁrst couple of iterations.
EM quickly converged to an activated level when trained with the
actual patient data, whereas it converged to an unchanged activity
when given random data. The convergence suggests that the pathway
structures and inference are able to successfully identify patterns of
activity in the integrated patient data.

We next ran PARADIGM on both breast cancer and GBM cohorts.
We developed a statistical simulation procedure to determine which
IPAs are signiﬁcantly different than what would be expected from
a negative distribution. We constructed the negative distribution by
permuting across all of the patients and across the genes in the
pathway. Empirically, we found that permuting only among genes

Fraction of Total Pathways

Fig. 5. Distinguishing decoy from real pathways with PARADIGM and
SPIA. Decoy pathways were created by assigning a new gene name
to each gene in a pathway. PARADIGM and SPIA were then used to
compute the perturbation of every pathway. Each line shows the receiver—
operator characteristic for distinguishing real from decoy pathways using
the perturbation ranking. In breast cancer, the areas under the curve (AUCs)
are 0.669 and 0.602 for PARADIGM and SPIA, respectively. In GBM, the
AUCs are 0.642 and 0.604, respectively.

in the pathway was necessary to help correct for the fact that each
gene has a different topological context determined by the network.
In the breast cancer dataset, 56172 IPAs (7% of the total) were
found to be signiﬁcantly higher or lower than the matched negative
controls. On average, NCI pathways had 497 signiﬁcant entities per
patient and 103 out of 127 pathways had at least one entity altered
in 20% or more of the patients. In the GBM dataset, 141 682 IPAs
(9% of the total) were found to be signiﬁcantly higher or lower than
the matched negative controls. On average, NCI pathways had 616
signiﬁcant entities per patient and 110 out of 127 pathways had at
least one entity altered in 20% or more of the patients.

As another control, we asked whether the integrated activities
could be obtained from arbitrary genes connected in the same way
as the genes in the NCI pathways. To do this, we estimated the
false discovery rate and compared it with SPIA (Tarca et al., 2009).
Because many genetic networks have been found to be implicated
in cancer, we chose to use simulated ‘decoy’ pathways as a set
of negative controls. For each NCI pathway, we constructed a
decoy pathway by connecting random genes in the genome together
using the same network structure as the NCI pathway. We then ran
PARADIGM and SPIA to derive IPAs for both the NCI and decoy
pathways. For PARADIGM, we ranked each pathway by the number
of IPAs found to be signiﬁcant across the patients after normalizing
by the pathway size. For SPIA, pathways were ranked according to
their computed impact factor.

We found that PARADIGM excludes more decoy pathways from
the top—most activated pathways compared with SPIA (Fig. 5). For
example, in breast cancer, PARADIGM ranks 1 decoy in the top
10, 2 in the top 30 and 4 in the top 50. In comparison, SPIA ranks
3 decoys in the top 10, 12 in the top 30 and 22 in the top 50. The
overall distribution of ranks for NCI IPAs are higher in PARADIGM
than in SPIA, observed by plotting the cumulative distribution of the
ranks (P < 0.009, Kolmogorov—Smirnov test).

We sorted the NCI pathways according to their average number of
signiﬁcant IPAs per entity detected by our permutation analysis and
tabulated the top 15 in breast cancer (Table 1) and GBM (Table 2).

Several pathways among the top 15 have been previously implicated
in their respective cancers. In breast cancer, both SPIA and
PARADIGM were able to detect the estrogen— and ErbB2—related
pathways. In a recent major meta—analysis study, authors from
Wirapati et al. (2008) found that estrogen receptor and ErbB2
status were two of only three key prognostic signatures in breast
cancer. PARADIGM was also able to identify an AKT1—related PI3K
signaling pathway as the top—most pathway with signiﬁcant IPAs in
several samples (Fig. 6). The anti—apoptotic AKT1 serine—threonine
kinase is known to be involved in breast cancer and interacts with the
ERBB2 pathway (J u et al., 2007). In GBM, both FOXMl and HIF—
1—alpha transcription factor networks have been studied extensively
and shown to be overexpressed in high—grade glioblastomas versus
lower—grade gliomas (Liu et al., 2006; Semenza, 2000).

the ErbB2/ErbB3/neuregulin 2 complex node have circles only for ER status
and for IPAs, as there are no direct observations of these entities. Each
patient’s data is displayed along one angle from the circle center to edge.

To visualize the results of PARADIGM inference, we developed
a ‘CircleMap’ visualization to display multiple datasets centered
around each gene in a pathway (Fig. 7). In this display, each gene is
associated with all of its data across the cohort by plotting concentric
rings around the gene, where each ring corresponds to a single type
of measurement or computational inference. Each tick in the ring
corresponds to a single patient sample while the color corresponds
to activated (red), deactivated (blue) or unchanged (white) levels of
activity. We plotted CircleMaps for a subset of the ErbB2 pathway
and included ER status, IPAs, expression and copy number data from
the breast cancer cohort.

Gene expression data have been used successfully to deﬁne
molecular subtypes for various cancers. Cancer subtypes have been
found that correlate with different clinical outcomes such as drug
sensitivity and overall survival. We asked whether we could identify

informative subtypes for GBM using PARADIGM IPAs rather than
the raw expression data. The advantage of using IPAs is that they
provide a summarization of copy number, expression and known
interactions among the genes and may therefore provide more
robust signatures for elucidating meaningful patient subgroups. We
ﬁrst determined all IPAs that were at least moderately recurrently
activated across the GBM samples and found that 1755 entities had
IPAs of 0.25 in at least 75 of the 229 samples. We collected all
of the IPAs for these entities in an activity matrix. The samples
and entities were then clustered using hierarchical clustering with
uncentered Pearson correlation and centroid linkage (Fig. 8). Visual
inspection revealed four obvious subtypes based on the IPAs with
the fourth subtype clearly distinct from the ﬁrst three.

The fourth cluster exhibits clear downregulation of HIF—l—alpha
transcription factor network as well as overexpression of the E2F
transcription factor network. HIF—l—alpha is a master transcription
factor involved in regulation of the response to hypoxic conditions.
In contrast, two of the ﬁrst three clusters have elevated EGFR
signatures and an inactive MAP kinase cascade involving the
GATA interleukin transcriptional cascade. Interestingly, mutations
and ampliﬁcations in EGFR have been associated with high grade
gliomas as well as glioblastomas (Kuan et al., 2001). Ampliﬁcations
and certain mutations can create a constitutively active EGFR
either through self stimulation of the dimer or through ligand—
independent activation. The constitutive activation of EGFR may
promote oncogenesis and progression of solid tumors. Geﬁtinib, a
molecule known to target EGFR, is currently being investigated for
its efﬁcacy in other EGFR—driven cancers. Thus, qualitatively, the
clusters appeared to be honing in on biologically meaningful themes
that can stratify patients.

Time (months)

Fig. 9. Kaplan—Meier survival plots for the clusters from Figure 8.

To quantify these observations, we asked whether the different
GBM subtypes identiﬁed by PARADIGM coincided with different
survival proﬁles. We calculated Kaplan—Meier curves for each of the
four clusters by plotting the proportion of patients surviving versus
the number of months after initial diagnosis. We plotted Kaplan—
Meier survival curves for each of the four clusters to see if any cluster
associated with a distinct IPA signature was predictive of survival
outcome (Fig. 9). The fourth cluster is signiﬁcantly different from
the other clusters (P < 2.11 X 10‘5 ; Cox proportional hazards test).
Half of the patients in the ﬁrst three clusters survive past 18 months;
the survival is signiﬁcantly increased for cluster 4 patients where
half survive past 30 months. In addition, over the range of 20—40
months, patients in cluster 4 are twice as likely to survive as patients
in the other clusters.

The survival analysis revealed that the patients in cluster 4 have
a signiﬁcantly better survival proﬁle. Cluster 4 was found to have
an upregulation of E2F, which acts with the retinoblastoma tumor
suppressor. Upregulation of E2F is therefore consistent with an
active suppression of cell cycle progression in the tumor samples
from the patients in cluster 4. In addition, cluster 4 was associated
with an inactivity of the HIF—l—alpha transcription factor. The
inactivity in the fourth cluster may be a marker that the tumors
are more oxygenated, suggesting that they may be smaller or newer
tumors. Thus, PARADIGM IPAs provide a meaningful set of proﬁles
for delineating subtypes with markedly different survival outcomes.

For comparison, we also attempted to cluster the patients using
only expression data or CNA data to derive patient subtypes. No
obvious groups were found from clustering using either of these
data sources, consistent with the ﬁndings in the original TCGA
analysis of this dataset (TCGA, 2008), (Supplementary Fig. 1).
This suggests that the interactions among genes and resulting
combinatorial outputs of individual gene expression may provide
a better predictor of such a complex phenotype as patient outcome.

4 DISCUSSION

The PARADIGM method integrates diverse high—throughput
genomics information with known signaling pathways to provide
patient—speciﬁc genomic inferences on the state of gene activities,
complexes and cellular processes. The core of the method uses a
factor graph to leverage inference for combining the various data
sources. The use of such inferences in place of, or in conjunction
with, the original high—throughput datasets improves our ability
to classify samples into clinically relevant subtypes. Clustering
the GBM patients based on the PARADIGM—integrated activities
revealed patient subtypes correlated with different survival proﬁles.
In contrast, clustering the samples either using the expression data

or the copy—number data did not reveal any signiﬁcant clusters in
the dataset.

PARADIGM produces pathway inferences of signiﬁcantly altered
gene activities in tumor samples from both GBM and breast cancer.
Compared to a competing pathway activity inference approach
called SPIA, our method identiﬁes altered activities in cancer—related
pathways with fewer false—positives.

For computational efﬁciency, PARADIGM currently uses the NCI
pathways as is. While it infers hidden quantities using EM, it makes
no attempt to infer new interactions not already present in an NCI
pathway. One can imagine expanding the approach to introduce new
interactions that increase the likelihood function. While this problem
is intractable in general, heuristics such as structural EM (Friedman
and Goldszmidt, 1997) can be used to identify interactions using
computational search strategies. Rather than searching for novel
connections de now one could speed up the search signiﬁcantly
by proposing interactions derived from protein—protein interaction
maps or gene pairs correlated in a signiﬁcant number of expression
datasets.

The power of the pathway—based approach is that it may provide
clues about the possible mechanisms underlying the differences in
observed survival. Informative IPAs may be useful for suggesting
therapeutic targets or to select the most appropriate patients for
clinical trials. For example, the ErbB2 ampliﬁcation is a well—
known marker of particular forms of breast cancer that are
treatable by the drug trastuzumab. However, some patients with the
ErbB2 ampliﬁcation have tumors that are refractory to treatment.
Inspection of a CircleMap display could identify patients with
ErbB2 ampliﬁcations but have either inactive or unchanged IPAs as
inferred by PARADIGM. Patients harboring the ErbB2 ampliﬁcation
but without predicted activity could be considered for alternative
treatment. As more multidimensional datasets become available
in the future, it will be interesting to test whether such pathway
inferences provide robust biomarkers that generalize across cohorts.

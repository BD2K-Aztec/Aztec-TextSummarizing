ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput sequencing technologies have made
population-scale studies of human genetic variation possible.
Accurate and comprehensive detection of DNA sequence variants
is crucial for the success of these studies. Small insertions and
deletions represent the second most frequent class of variation in
the human genome after single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
Although several alignment tools for the gapped alignment of
sequence reads to a reference genome are available, computational
methods for discriminating indels from sequencing errors and
genotyping indels directly from sequence reads are needed.
Results: We describe a probabilistic method for the accurate
detection and genotyping of short indels from population-scale
sequence data. In this approach, aligned sequence reads from
a population of individuals are used to automatically account
for context-specific sequencing errors associated with indels. We
applied this approach to population sequence datasets from the
1000 Genomes exon pilot project generated using the Roche 454 and
Illumina sequencing platforms, and were able to detect a significantly
greater number of indels than reported previously. Comparison to
indels identified in the 1000 Genomes pilot project demonstrated
the sensitivity of our method. The consistency in the number of
indels and the fraction of indels whose length is a multiple of three
across different human populations and two different sequencing
platforms indicated that our method has a low false discovery
rate. Finally, the method represents a general approach for the
detection and genotyping of small-scale DNA sequence variants for
population-scale sequencing projects.

1 INTRODUCTION

Small insertions and deletions (1—50 bp) represent the second most
frequent class of variation in the human genome after single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although indels exhibit greater
potential to disrupt functional elements than SNPs, indels have

been characterized to a signiﬁcantly lesser extent, and are greatly
underrepresented in public variation databases. There are two main
reasons for this: (i) SNPs are more abundant in the genome
and are easier to genotype using arrays and (ii) indels are more
difﬁcult to detect reliably using sequencing data. Sequencing of the
ﬁrst individual genome using the Sanger method by Levy et al.
(2007) demonstrated that short indels are frequent in the human
genome. Previously, Bhangale et al. (2005) performed a population—
scale characterization of short indels in the human genome by
resequencing 330 genes in 47 individuals using the Sanger method.
Mills et al. (2006) generated a genome—wide map of indels by
analyzing Sanger resequencing data. In recent years, several high—
throughput DNA sequencing technologies have emerged that are
able to generate gigabases of DNA sequence data in a single
instrument run. These next—generation sequencing (NGS) methods
offer greater potential to detect indels compared with Sanger
sequencing since each allele is sequenced independently multiple
times. Indeed, whole—genome shotgun sequencing of several
individuals using high—throughput platforms has demonstrated the
presence of several hundred thousands of short indel variants per
genome (Bentley et al., 2008; McKernan et al., 2009; Wang et al.,
2008; Wheeler et al., 2008).

Indels can be identiﬁed from sequence reads by performing
gapped alignment of reads to a reference sequence. Several
alignment tools developed for next—generation sequencing data
allow gapped alignments (Homer et al., 2009; Li and Durbin, 2009;
Li et al., 2008; Rumble et al., 2009) [see Li and Homer (2010)
for a survey of sequence alignment algorithms]. After reads have
been aligned, the presence of multiple reads that support the same
insertion/deletion event can be used to call indels. However, it
can often be challenging to identify moderately long indels from
short sequence reads since each read is aligned independently to the
reference genome. Further, reads that span an indel event close to
the ends of a read are difﬁcult to align with gaps and can potentially
be misaligned resulting in false SNPs (Krawitz et al., 2010). The
problem of misaligned reads can be alleviated by locally realigning
reads using information from reads that are informative about the
presence of an indel. Many tools for doing local realignment of short
reads have recently been developed (Albers et al., 2011; Homer and
Nelson, 2010; McKenna et al., 2010).

Once reads have been aligned to a reference sequence as
accurately as possible, the next challenge is to distinguish true
indels from sequencing errors and alignment artifacts. Several
methods have been developed to detect single nucleotide variants
using sequence data generated from individual genomes and

successfully applied to identify millions of SNPs from whole—
genome sequencing projects (Li et al., 2008, 2009; McKenna
et al., 2010). Most of these methods utilize the base quality
values for each individual base—call within a Bayesian framework
to calculate the likelihood of an individual being heterozygous
or homozygous for a variant allele at each site. Distinguishing
true indels from sequencing errors is difﬁcult since there are no
accurate sequencing error models for indel errors. For example,
base qualities for Illumina reads represent the accuracy of each
individual base call but are not informative about indel errors. It is
well known that insertion/deletion errors are dependent on the local
sequence context, e. g. the 454/Roche sequencing platform is prone
to sequencing errors in homopolymer runs (Wheeler et al., 2008).
The Illumina sequencing—by—synthesis technology reads individual
bases in each sequencing cycle and is, therefore, less susceptible to
insertion/deletion errors. However, non—sequencing artifacts such as
polymerase slippage during PCR ampliﬁcation of DNA molecules
can result in insertion/deletion sequencing errors in homopolymer
stretches as well as microsatellites (Shinde et al., 2003). DNA
insertion/deletion polymorphisms are known to be more frequent
in such regions for primarily the same reason. Recently, Albers
et al. (2011) developed a Bayesian method called Dindel to detect
indels from short read sequence data generated using the Illumina
sequencing platform. Dindel uses a probabilistic realignment model
along with estimates of indel error rates from the 1000 Genomes
project to distinguish indels from sequencing errors.

Accurately detecting indels from NGS data while accounting
for indel errors that are dependent on the local sequence context
and the sequencing platform remains difﬁcult. In this article, we
describe a probabilistic method that leverages sequence reads from
a population of diploid individuals (sequenced using the same
sequencing platform) to accurately detect indel variants. High—
throughput sequencing technologies are increasingly being used
for sequencing the genomes of populations of individuals with
the goal of identifying rare and common DNA sequence variants.
The availability of population—scale sequence data not only poses
new challenges for variant detection methods, but also creates
opportunities for the development of new approaches to variant
detection. For indel detection, we reasoned that given aligned
sequence reads from a population of individuals at any given
site: (i) the context—speciﬁc sequencing error rate should be similar
across all individuals; (ii) individuals who are homozygous for the
reference allele should be informative about the average sequencing
error rate; and (iii) for individuals who carry one or two copies
of the variant allele, the fraction of the reads that support the
variant allele should be signiﬁcantly greater than the background
sequencing error rate. We model the unknown sequencing error
rate and the population genotypes at each position and calculate
the likelihood of the population sequence data conditional on the
population genotypes by integrating over the error rate. To quantify
the evidence for the presence of a variant allele at a position, we
compare the likelihood of the most likely genotype conﬁguration in
the presence of a variant allele with the population likelihood in the
absence of a variant allele, i.e. when all individuals are homozygous
for the reference allele. Positions for which this likelihood ratio
is above a threshold are identiﬁed as variant sites. Additionally,
information about the distribution of reads on the forward and
reverse strands is used by modeling the sequencing error rates
independently to further improve the accuracy of detecting variants.

Unlike previous methods for indel detection, our method does not
require prior knowledge of context—speciﬁc indel error rates and is
applicable to population sequence data from different sequencing
platforms. To demonstrate the accuracy of our method, we utilize
population sequencing datasets generated by exon sequencing in the
1000 Genomes project using the Roche 454 and Illumina sequencing
platforms. Across 7 population sequencing datasets, our method
identiﬁed 261 distinct indels, signiﬁcantly greater than the number
of indels reported in the 1000 Genomes project variant calls (Durbin
et al., 2010). Comparison of our indel calls to indels identiﬁed in the
1000 Genomes project demonstrated a high sensitivity of 95—100%
across different populations. Analysis of the distribution of lengths
of indels revealed an excess of indels whose length is a multiple of 3
(3n) across multiple populations and the two sequencing platforms.
This increased frequency of 3n indels and the consistency in the
number of indels detected across multiple populations and two
different sequencing platforms suggest that our method has good
speciﬁcity.

2 METHODS

Short indels can be detected by performing gapped alignments of reads to
a reference sequence and various tools for doing this are available. Most
alignment methods align each read independently to the reference sequence.
The presence of multiple reads supporting the same insertion/deletion variant
can be used to distinguish real indels from sequencing and alignment
artifacts. However, reads that contain an indel (with respect to the reference
sequence) near the beginning or the end of the read are typically aligned
without gaps resulting in alignments with multiple mismatches. To improve
the alignment of reads that span indels, one could use a realignment method
to improve the initial alignment with respect to indels. Realignment of
reads can make a signiﬁcant difference in the subsequent detection of
indels for short read sequence data but is likely to be less important for
longer reads. Our objective is to utilize aligned sequence reads from a
population of individuals to identify sites that harbor an insertion/deletion
variant. Therefore, we assume that the reads for each individual have
been aligned to the corresponding reference sequence as accurately as
possible.

2.1 Probabilistic model for population indel detection

We consider a set of genomic loci that have been resequenced in a population
of n diploid individuals. Our objective is to identify positions in the
sequenced region for which at least one of the 2n haplotypes harbors an
insertion/deletion of one or more bases. For each site, we denote the reference
allele by A0 and the alternate allele A1. If there are multiple potential variant
alleles, we evaluate each allele individually. Given aligned sequence data
from n individuals, we denote the ordered set of population genotypes by
G: [G1,G2, ..., Gn]. Assuming two alleles, A0 and A1, we denote the three
possible genotypes as (AOAO),(A0A1) and (A1A1). In the absence of a variant
allele, Gl- =(A0A0) for all i. Let Go: [(AOAO), (AOAO), ..., (A0A0)] represent
the genotype conﬁguration in which each individual is homozygous for the
allele A0. Similarly, we deﬁne G1 = [(A1A1), (A1A1), ...,(A1A1)]. The aligned
sequence reads for all individuals at each site represent the observed data
D 2 [D1, ...,D,,] where Dl-(l 5 i 5 n) is the set of aligned reads that cover the
given site for individual i.

Given the population sequence data D at each position in the genome, we
can write Pr(D) as

ZPr(D|G)Pr(G)=Pr(D|G0)Pr(G0)+ Z Pr(D|G/)Pr(G/)
G G/#G0

Detection of indels for population-scale sequencing data

 

We deﬁne a likelihood ratio statistic as the ratio of the likelihood in the
presence of a variant to the likelihood in the absence of a variant:
LR ZG/aéGo Pr(D| G/)Pr(G/)

T Pr(D|G0)Pr(G0)

 

(1)

In order to compute the likelihood ratio statistic, we need to deﬁne
the conditional probabilities Pr(D|G/) and the prior probability Pr(G/) for
each genotype conﬁguration G’. If base quality values or sequencing error
probabilities for each base—call are available, we can calculate the conditional
genotype probabilities using these sequencing error probabilities (see e.g.
Bansal et al., 2010; Li et al., 2008). However, for indels, such error rates
are typically not available. In order to compute the conditional likelihoods,
we introduce the parameter e01 which corresponds to the probability of
(incorrectly) reading the reference allele A0 as the alternate allele A1 . One can
think of this parameter as the average context—speciﬁc sequencing error rate
at this particular position. For example, in a homopolymer run of 4 ‘T’s where
the alternate allele is ‘TTT’, this parameter would represent the probability
of reading the reference allele ‘TTTT’ as ‘TTT’ due to sequencing errors.
Similarly, we deﬁne the parameter, em as the probability of reading the allele
A1 as the reference allele A0 due to sequencing errors. If all individuals have
been sequenced using the same sequencing platform, the context—speciﬁc
sequencing error rate is expected to be similar from individual to individual.

To calculate the conditional likelihoods, we integrate over the unknown
sequencing error rates as follows:

Pr(D| G/) = fPr(D| G/, e)7r(e| G/)de (2)

where e: (e01, e10), 71(elG/) is the prior distribution of the sequencing error
rates given the population genotype vector G/ and the integral is a double
integral over the two variables em and em (0 5 em 5 1 and 0 5 em 5 1). Since
the sequencing error rates are independent of the presence of a variant, we
can write 71(elG/) = 71(e) = 71(e01) >< 71(e10). Further, since sequence reads for
each individual only affect the genotypes for that individual, we can write

Pr(DIG/=(Gl,Gz.....Gn).e)=1_[Pr(DiIG.,e) (3)
i=1
Next, we describe how to calculate the conditional likelihood Pr(D,- | Gi, e)
for an individual.

2.2 Conditional likelihoods for an individual

Consider the set of reads D,- covering a site in an individual i. We summarize
the data as no and m, the number of reads that support the two alleles A0
and A1, respectively. For a diploid individual, we consider the likelihoods
for the three genotypes: (AOAO), (AoAl) and (A1A1). Assuming independence
between sequencing errors from multiple reads, we can deﬁne the conditional
probabilities for the three genotypes as:

7701—171

PI’(Di|Gi = (A0140), €01 , €10): ( )(1— €01)r"0(601)r"1 (4)

11
7701—171

10

PI’(Di|Gi :(A0A1)76017610): ( )(h/Y“) (1 —h/)ril (6)

where h is the probability that an aligned read was sampled from the
chromosome with the reference allele and h/ =h(1—e01)+(1—h)e10 is
the probability of observing a read with the A0 allele given the genotype
Gi=(A0A1) . For SNPs, it is reasonable to assume equal probability of
sampling the two chromosomes, i.e. h=0.5. For indels, especially for long
indels, reads that cover the insertion/deletion variant near the start or the end
of the read are likely to be misaligned or not aligned. To account for this
bias in favor of observing the reference allele, we set h=0.5 +6 where e
is estimated using the length of the variant allele and the average length of
sequence reads (see Supplementary Material for details).

2.3 Conditional data likelihoods for population of
individuals

Now that we have deﬁned the conditional likelihoods for each individual,

we can calculate the probability of the population data D conditional on a

population genotype vector. For G: G0, G = (AOAO) for all individuals and

from Equation (3) we have:

PF(D|GO,601,610)=1—[(

i=1

r'0 + r'1 . .
l l )(1 —€01)r‘0 (601)“1
riO
To calculate Pr(D|G0), we need to integrate the above expression as
deﬁned in Equation (2). Since, the expression does not depend on the variable
e10, the integral reduces to

n . . 1

For the error rate e01, we choose a beta prior with parameters or and ﬂ.

Therefore, 71(e01)= and the integral can be written as

 

1 _ _

where B is the ﬁ—function. The integrand in the above equation is the
probability density function of the beta distribution with parameters 05+ C1
and B + C0 scaled by the normalization constant B(oz + C1 , B + C0). Therefore,

we have
n i i B +C , +C
i=1 ’ ’

For G75 G0, the integrand involves both parameters em and em and it is
infeasible to evaluate the integral analytically. Therefore, we approximate
it numerically by summing the value of the integrand over a 2D grid (see
Supplementary material for details of the numerical integration and accuracy
of the approximation).

For a given genotype G, the conditional likelihood Pr(D|G) is calculated
by integrating over the parameters em and em. We also calculate a simple

 

. . / .
estimate for the sequencmg error rate em as C ,Cic , where C0 1s the number
0 l

of reads that support the allele A0 summed over individuals with G = (AOAO)
and Cl/ is the number of reads supporting A1.

2.4 Modeling strand-speciﬁc sequencing errors

Systematic sequencing errors, such as those that depend on the local sequence
context, are likely to be strand speciﬁc, i.e. overrepresented on one of the
two strands. Since the local sequence context on the two strands is different,
we model the sequencing error rates on each strand using independent
parameters. Therefore, we can rewrite Equation (2) as:

Pr(D|G/)= f f Pr(Df ,D’lGCJ ,erma‘ )71(er)dJ de’

where Df represents the sequence reads for the population of individuals
that align to the forward (+) strand and Dr represents the set of sequence
reads aligned to the reverse (—) strand. Also, ef =((e01)f, (e10)f) represents
the sequencing error rates on the forward strand and er represents the error
rates on the reverse strand. Since the sequencing error rates on one strand
do not affect the conditional likelihood for the reads on the other strand, the
above integral can be written as the product of two conditional likelihoods,
one for each strand:

f Pr(Df |G/, ef )71(ef )d(ef ) X f Pr(D’|G/, er)71(er)d(er)

Each of the two stranded conditional likelihoods can be calculated as
before by using the data for the corresponding strand and integrating over the

strand—speciﬁc error rates. Later, we show how the strand—speciﬁc conditional
likelihoods can be used to ﬁlter out false variants for which virtually all the
evidence for the presence of a variant allele is present on the reads from one
strand. Li et al. (2010) have also demonstrated the utility of a strand—based
ﬁlter to substantially reduce the number of false positive variants in analysis
of mitochondrial DNA sequencing data.

2.5 Prior probabilities for population genotypes

Given a genotype conﬁguration G=(G1,G2, ...,G,,) for n individuals, we
want to calculate Pr(G), the prior probability of the genotype conﬁguration.
Let m be the number of A1 alleles in the genotype G and Pr(n1) be the
probability of observing n1 alleles of type A1 in a sample of n diploid
individuals. Let 6 be the population—scaled mutation rate. Using the allele
frequency spectrum of a neutrally evolving population under the standard
coalescent (Fu, 1995), we can write (see also Le and Durbin, 2011):

 

9 1 1
Pr(n1)=—(—+ )(0<n1<2n) (8)

For a genotype conﬁguration G, let mm, mm and mu be the number of
individuals with genotypes (AOAO), (AoAl) and (A1A1) in G. Under the
assumption of Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium, the probability of observing
n01 heterozygotes in a sample of n diploid individuals with m A1 alleles is
[see Equation (1) (Wigginton et al., 2005)]

Pr(n01 hets|n1)=

 

 

for 07500 and 07501.

2.6 Calculating likelihood ratio statistic

For each potential variant site, we want to evaluate the likelihood ratio
deﬁned in Equation (1). Using Equations (9) and (10), we can calculate
the prior probability for any genotype G. The conditional likelihood
Pr(D|G0) for the reference genotype G0 can also be calculated analytically
using Equation (7). However, the numerator involves summing over the
conditional likelihoods for an exponential number of possible genotypes.
Further, calculating the conditional likelihood for an individual genotype
is computationally expensive since it involves a numerical integration over
two variables. To avoid summing over a large number of genotypes, we
assume that the posterior genotype likelihood is concentrated around the
most likely genotype conﬁguration. Therefore, we can approximate the sum
by maxG/ Pr(D| G/)Pr(G/). This is a reasonable approximation if each sample
has sufﬁcient sequence coverage but could reduce the power to detect variants
when coverage is low. In order to determine the genotype conﬁguration G’"‘”‘
for which Pr(D|G/)Pr(G/) is maximum, we use a simple greedy algorithm
where we start from an initial genotype conﬁguration and iteratively update
the genotype conﬁguration until the genotype likelihood can be increased.
Sites for which the likelihood ratio statistic is above a threshold are identiﬁed
as candidate variants.

To ﬁlter out potentially false variants for which the evidence for the
presence of a variant allele is strand speciﬁc, we compute the ratios

Pr(Df jam“) Pr(D’ mm“) .
Pr(Df|G0) and Pr(D,|G0) for the forward and reverse strands. Variants
for which either of the two ratios is less than 1 are likely artifacts of

strand—speciﬁc sequencing errors.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Sequence data from 1000 Genomes project

We assessed the performance of piCALL using population
sequencing data generated by the 1000 Genomes project (exon
sequencing) (Durbin et al., 2010). In this project, 8140 exons from
906 randomly selected genes were captured using multiple target
capture technologies and subsequently sequenced at high coverage
using the Roche 454 and Illumina GA sequencing platforms in
697 individuals. We utilized a subset of the sequence data from
individuals of European (CEU), East Asian (CHB and CHD), and
African (YRI) ancestry. For each individual, we downloaded aligned
sequence reads (in BAM format) from the 1000 Genomes web site
(ftp://ftp—trace.ncbi.nih. gov/ l OOOgenomes/ftp/pilot_data/data/). For
samples sequenced using the 454 technology, we utilized alignments
generated using the SSAHA aligner (Ning et al., 2001), while for
samples sequenced on the Illumina GA, we used the MAQ (Li
et al., 2008) alignments. The Illumina samples were sequenced
using a mix of read lengths (ranging from 35 to 100 bp) and both
single—end and paired—end reads. For samples sequenced using only
single—end reads, we aligned the reads to the reference human
genome using BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) to allow for detection
of indels. Further, to improve the alignment of reads that span
insertion/deletion variants, we utilized the realignment module of
the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (McKenna et al., 2010) to
realign the reads for each individual. The realigned BAM ﬁles for
each sample were used for indel detection.

3.2 Detection of indels using piCALL

To analyze aligned reads from multiple samples using piCALL, we
generated pileup ﬁles (distinct from the samtools pileup format)
that represented the aligned bases covering each position. For indel
detection, we only considered reads with a mapping quality of 20
or more. For each position, we determined candidate indels using
the aligned reads for all samples in a population and evaluated each
candidate indel using the algorithm piCALL as described in the
Methods. For the beta prior on the error probabilities 601 and am, we
used parameters at = l and ,8 = 30. We also ran piCALL with different
values for ,8 (25, 50) and 05:1 and observed only minor changes
in the set of the indels identiﬁed by piCALL. For the log—likelihood
ratio statistic, we used a threshold of four to identify indels. Choosing
a lower cutoff for the statistic is expected to increase the sensitivity
and decrease the speciﬁcity of the indel calls. In the absence of
a dataset with perfect knowledge of the indel variants, we used a
higher threshold to increase speciﬁcity. Candidate indels for which
the log—likelihood ratio statistic was above the threshold value and
for which the evidence from the two strands was not conﬂicting
(strandﬁlter) were retained. The number of indels that were identiﬁed
in each population are reported in Table 1 along with the number
of samples. For the CEU and CHB population samples sequenced
using the Roche 454 platform, the number of identiﬁed indels was
unusually large compared with other populations. Further analysis
of the indels in these populations revealed an excess of lbp indels
in homopolymer runs. For each indel, we calculated the mean
estimate of the sequencing error rates emf and 60f (see Section
2.3) using the ﬁnal genotype conﬁguration. Indels for which the
sequencing error rate 6 (average of the two strand—speciﬁc error
rates) was above a threshold were removed. The number of indels
in each population that passed this additional ﬁlter are also shown
in Table 1 (650.03 and BSODZ). The number of indels detected
for the Illumina sequenced datasets was virtually unaffected by this
ﬁlter while the number of indels for the Roche 454 datasets was
considerably reduced. However, the total number of indels detected
across different populations and sequencing platforms was more
consistent, suggesting that this ﬁlter removed false single base pair
indels called from Roche 454 data.

In total, 408 indels were identiﬁed by piCALL across the seven
population datasets (e <=0.02). In coding regions, short insertions
and deletions that cause a frameshift are likely to affect gene

function. Therefore, coding indels whose length is not a multiple
of 3, i.e. the length of a codon, are expected to be under purifying
selection. The 204/408 (50%) indels had a length that was a multiple
of 3 (see Fig. la for distribution of indel lengths for the two
sequencing platforms). This bias in favor of 311 indels was consistent
with previous studies of coding indels (Bhangale et al., 2005; Ng
et al., 2009) and indicated that the set of indels did not contain
many false positives. Interestingly, the proportion of 311 indels for the
YRI population detected on both the Illumina (57%) and Roche 454
(63%) sequencing platforms was higher than in the CEU and Asian
populations (Fig. lb). The higher proportion of 311 coding indels
in African populations is consistent with the ﬁnding of Lohmueller
et al. (2008) that European populations harbor a greater proportion
of non—synonymous SNPs as compared with African populations.

3.3 Comparison to indel calls in 1000 Genomes project

To assess the sensitivity of our indel calls, we compared our data
with indel calls downloaded from the 1000 Genomes project web
site. Since the 1000 Genomes project calls were made for each
population by combining data across multiple platforms, we merged
the indels identiﬁed by piCALL for each of three populations: CEU,
YRI and Asian (CHB + CHD) across the two platforms. For the CEU
population, 22 of the 24 indels reported by the 1000 Genomes data
were also called by piCALL. Similarly, for the YRI population,
34/38 indels were identiﬁed. For the Asian samples, 33 of 39 indels
were detected. We further examined the 12 indels called in the 1000
Genomes data that were missed by piCALL. Of these, three were
conﬁrmed in validation experiments, four did not validate while the
remaining ﬁve indels were not evaluated (Durbin et al., 2010).

We also compared indels detected from the CEU and YRI
populations sequenced using the Roche 454 platform to indel calls
in the trios sequenced by the 1000 Genomes project. The individuals
in the YRI trio (NA19240, NA19238 and NA19239) and the CEU
trio (NA12878, NA12891 and NA12892) were sequenced using the
Roche 454 platform. For the YRI trio, l7 indels overlapped the
genomic regions targeted in the exon population sequencing. In all,
16 of these were identiﬁed by piCALL in the YRI Roche 454 dataset.
The one indel that was missed was in an exon that had low coverage
in the population sequence data. Similarly, for the CEU trio, all nine
indels that overlapped the sequenced exons were identiﬁed. Overall,
these results demonstrated the high sensitivity of our method.

The number of indels identiﬁed by piCALL for the 1000 Genomes
datasets was signiﬁcantly greater than reported by Durbin et al.
(2010). The 408 indels identiﬁed across the seven population
datasets correspond to 261 distinct insertion/deletion variants. In
all, 62 of these matched indels identiﬁed in the 1000 Genomes
exon project. An additional 24 indels were detected in two or more
populations. While it is difﬁcult to estimate the false discovery
rate without experimental validation, the increased frequency of 311
indels and the consistency in the number of indels detected across
different populations and two different sequencing platforms suggest
that our method has high speciﬁcity.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

Insertions and deletions represent an important class of small—
sequence variation that can be identiﬁed from high—throughput
sequencing data. Hundreds of exomes have been sequenced (Li

et al., 2010) and several thousand exomes are being sequenced
for the comprehensive discovery of coding genetic variation and
to identify rare disease susceptibility variants. In coding regions,
accurate and sensitive detection of indels is important since missed
indels can reduce power to detect the functional mutations while
false indels increase the number of candidate mutations that could be
functional. However, this requires (1) comprehensive identiﬁcation
of candidate indel variants from sequence reads, (ii) accurate
alignment of all reads that support an insertion/deletion event and
(iii) probabilistic method to discriminate true indels from indels that
are artifacts of sequencing or alignment errors. We have presented
a probabilistic method for the accurate detection and genotyping
of indels from aligned population sequence data that automatically
accounts for context—dependent sequencing errors. Application of
this method to population sequence data from the 1000 Genomes
project demonstrated the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of our method.

The method does not realign reads unlike indel callers such as
Dindel which combine realignment with indel detection. Therefore,
the accuracy of our method depends on the quality of the initial
alignments. The read lengths for the Illumina sequencing platform
are increasing and with longer reads, it should be easier to align
reads with gaps and substantially reduce the impact of misaligned
reads. A key feature of our method is that it does not require prior
knowledge of the context—speciﬁc sequencing error rates, although
prior information about the error rates can be easily incorporated in
the model. As new sequencing platforms emerge, methods for indel
detection that can automatically account for the platform—speciﬁc
sequencing error proﬁles will be very useful.

The probabilistic model underlying piCALL uses the number
of reads supporting each allele for calculating the likelihoods. It
is feasible to incorporate information about base quality values
and read mapping quality in the calculation of the conditional
genotype likelihoods. This would further improve the accuracy
of indel detection but would be even more important for calling
single nucleotide variants using the same model. Also, as currently
implemented, the method evaluates each potential variant allele at
each site individually. Although this allows for the detection of
multiallelic variants, a more accurate approach would be able handle
all potential variant alleles simultaneously. In the future, we plan to

extend the model and implementation of piCALL to incorporate base
quality values and analyze multiple variant alleles simultaneously.

We have implemented piCALL in C for computational efﬁciency.
The method is compatible with data from different sequencing
platforms but requires all samples to be sequenced using the same
sequencing platform. In addition, the method requires sequence
data from a sufﬁcient number of samples in order to accurately
estimate the population genotypes. The running time of piCALL
is proportional to the number of individuals and the number of
candidate indels evaluated using the likelihood ratio statistic. To
call indels for the seven population datasets from the 1000 Genomes
project, piCALL took ~4 h on a 8 core linux machine.

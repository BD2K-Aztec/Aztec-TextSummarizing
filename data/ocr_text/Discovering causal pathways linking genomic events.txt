ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identifying the cellular wiring that connects genomic per-
turbations to transcriptional changes in cancer is essential to gain a
mechanistic understanding of disease initiation, progression and
ultimately to predict drug response. We have developed a method
called Tied Diffusion Through Interacting Events (T ieDlE) that uses
a network diffusion approach to connect genomic perturbations to
gene expression changes characteristic of cancer subtypes. The
method computes a subnetwork of protein—protein interactions, pre-
dicted transcription factor-to-target connections and curated inter-
actions from literature that connects genomic and transcriptomic
perturbations.

Results: Application of TieDlE to The Cancer Genome Atlas and a
breast cancer cell line dataset identified key signaling pathways,
with examples impinging on MYC activity. Interlinking genes are pre-
dicted to correspond to essential components of cancer signaling
and may provide a mechanistic explanation of tumor character and
suggest subtype-specific drug targets.

1 INTRODUCTION

To optimize cancer treatment, whole-genome sequencing and
expression data for an individual patient must be synthesized
into a coherent explanation of disease-causing changes. Gene
networks encapsulate our understanding of how genes and
their products interact in the cell to mutually inﬂuence activity
through protein—protein, protein—DNA and coupled metabolic
reactions. However, different tumors usually harbor unique com-
binations of mutations, or other genomic or epigenomic changes.
A key question is how best to infer the structures of gene net-
works important for normal and diseased phenotypes using

high-throughput data and a priori biological knowledge.
Viewing cancer from a gene network perspective is expected to
enhance our understanding of disease initiation, progression and
therapy.

Given genes with functions disrupted in a particular type
of cancer, newly implicated genes can be identiﬁed by searching
for those with known regulatory connections to the input set.
However, this task is complicated by the presence of many
mutations whose functional signiﬁcance in cancer is unclear,
leading to many false-positive discoveries. For example, using
data on copy number alterations, gene mutations and methyla-
tion status, it may be difﬁcult to distinguish the genomic changes
that exert a physiologically meaningful inﬂuence on tumor biol-
ogy from numerous passenger events that result from loss of
genome integrity. One can identify subnetworks that intercon-
nect mutated genes, enriching the set of events for those proteins
participating in common pathways. The assumption underlying
this approach is that such mutations are more likely to be func-
tionally relevant. Approaches such as MEMO (Ciriello et al.,
2012) and Dendrix (Vandin et al., 2012b) have been applied suc-
cessfully in this manner. Several subnetwork enrichment methods
have been developed to identify regions of a network that con-
tain an unexpectedly high number of relevant genes (see
Supplementary Methods for an overview). Importantly, most
methods suffer from the inﬂuence of curation bias in the
network. The ‘hub’ genes that have many connections simply
because of being studied to a greater extent in the literature are
selected at high frequency even given random input genes. One
promising class of approaches that helps mitigate this problem is
the class based on heat diffusion, such as the HotNet algorithm
(Vandin et al., 2012a). Intuitively, a diffusion strategy makes the
a priori relevance of a hub comparable with a sparsely connected
gene because hubs might receive more total heat than a non-hub,
but the hub can also lose the same proportion out of its many
connections.

The Tied Diffusion of Interacting Events (TieDlE) method
described here extends on the heat diffusion strategies by lever-
aging different types of genomic inputs to ﬁnd relevant genes on
a background network with high speciﬁcity, in an attempt to
reduce the false-positive rate of previous approaches. Figure 1
shows a simple schematic of TieDIE applied to two distinct sets

Fig. 1. Schematic of TieDIE. Relevant genes from two distinct sets are
shown as nodes colored by dyes diffusing on a network from a source set
(e.g. mutated genes; red nodes) and target set (e.g. TFs; blue nodes).
‘Linker’ genes (purple nodes) residing between the source and target
sets are revealed through a diffusion process evolved over time; two
time slices are shown as stacked layers of the same network

of genes: a source set (e.g. mutated genes) and a target set
[e.g. transcription factors (TFs)]. Using two diffusion processes,
the method discovers newly implicated genes as linking nodes
residing on paths connecting sources to targets where the diffu-
sion processes overlap. A logically consistent solution can then
be extracted from the resulting network of sources, targets and
linkers (Supplementary Fig. S1).

We demonstrate that using two diffusion processes improves
our ability to recover pathway models. The overlay of genomic
perturbations in a single tumor sample with TieDIE solutions
reveals patient-speciﬁc networks that may provide insights into
therapy.

2 METHODS

TieDIE code is written in Python and is available at https://sysbiowiki.
soe.ucsc.edu/tiedie.

2.1 Tied diffusion

The TieDIE approach searches for relevant interconnecting genes on a
background network using a diffusion strategy. The method is given as
input an interaction network graph G containing N vertices V = {v1..vN}
that represent genes, proteins or other biological pathway features such as
gene products, protein complexes and cellular abstract processes. The
nodes in G are interlinked by I edges E = {e1..e1} representing both dir-
ected interactions as well as undirected relations such as protein—protein
interactions. The interactions can be derived from curated sources such
as the National Cancer Institute’s Pathway Interaction Database
(Schaefer et al., 2009), from functional genomics predictions, such as
undirected high-throughput protein—protein assays, or directed TF to
target interactions such as from genome-wide chromatin-immunoprecipi-
tation experiments, or from a mixture of both sources such as Reactome’s
Functional Interaction Network (J oshi-Tope et al., 2005). The diffusion
approaches used here make use of the adjacency matrix A of G, where
Ail: 1 if node i activates node j, Ail: —1 if node irepresses or inactivates
node j and 0 otherwise.

In addition to the graph, the method is given a set of scores for each
node in G. Let x: [ x1, x2, . . ., xN] be a vector of scores assigned to the
nodes in the graph. Typically, only a limited set of genes (e.g. in the
range 10—50) will have known involvement in the disease process being
studied. For example, this involved set may consist of genes for which a
minimum number of mutations or copy number changes or DNA methy-
lation silencing events have been detected in a given cohort of patient
samples. Nodes corresponding to these involved genes are assigned scores
between —1 and +1 to reﬂect a positive or negative association of activity
with the disease state under study. Nodes associated with genes not

known to be involved in the disease process are assigned a value of 0
to reﬂect an a priori belief in no involvement. The values in x can repre-
sent different types of measurements on the genes. For instance, the
scores might reﬂect how often a gene is mutated in one subtype of
patients compared with another (e.g. from a —log of the P-value com-
puted from a Fisher’s exact test to detect differential mutation frequency).
Alternatively, the scores can reﬂect a gene’s differential expression in
tumor versus normal. Statistical techniques, such as signiﬁcance analysis
of microarrays (SAM) (Tusher et al., 2001), may be used to compute the
signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes and the SAM score (d—statistic)
for each gene normalized to this range. The genomic events may be
preﬁltered with algorithms such as MutSig (Chin et al., 2011) and
MEMo (Ciriello et al., 2012) that use sample statistics to ﬁnd events
that are likely to be ‘driving’ the cancer phenotype. Note here that all
mutations are assumed to lower a gene’s activity (even though a minority,
oncogenic mutations in particular, increases gene activity) and to take
precedence over copy number alterations (e. g. ampliﬁcations) and expres-
sion events (e.g. overexpression), which will inﬂate the false-negative rate
of the algorithms tested here as some true paths will not be counted.
Relaxing this assumption is an important topic discussed in the
Supplementary Text. The input vector of positive scores is scaled to
match an intuition that the scores reﬂect a stationary probability distri-
bution of occupancy on the nodes in the network obtained from a
random walk process, i.e. 1x1. 2 l.

A new vector of scores, x’, can be obtained for all of the genes in G by
diffusing the scores of the involved set onto the rest of the graph. The
diffusion process places high scores on nodes that are near the input set
of genes, which may implicate new genes with roles in the disease state.
Here we consider methods that update the state of all of the nodes in G by
some function computed on the original vector of scores from the known
involved set, i.e. x’= r(x,A) for some relevance function that is a function of
the input set of scores and of the full adjacency matrix. In this work, we
tested three different approaches for use as the relevance functions: HotNet,
which uses an undirected heat diffusion process; Google’s PageRank, which
incorporates direction of the links in a random walk; and signaling pathway
impact analysis (SPIA), which incorporates both directionality and the
excitatory and inhibitory nature of the interactions. These relevance func-
tions are described in more detail in the Supplementary Methods.

In contrast to previous approaches that implicate subnetworks by
running the relevance function with a single input set of genes, our algo-
rithm extends the strategy by using multiple diffusion processes and then
identifying overlapping regions in G, to ﬁnd genes in a network that are
proximal to multiple input sets. We develop the approach here for the
special case of two input sets but the method generalizes to any arbitrary
number of input sets.

Suppose we are given a source set S and target set T where S acts
upstream of T. In the cancer setting, S may correspond to genes involved
in genomic alterations—mutations, deletions and ampliﬁcations—whereas
the target set may correspond to genes involved in transcriptional and
post-transcriptional activation or deactivation. However, any features in
the pathway diagram in addition to proteins can be included in the input
sets including protein complexes, small molecules or metabolites and
cellular processes. In the same spirit as the spanning tree approach
(Huang and Fraenkel, 2009), we are interested in identifying parsimoni-
ous networks that connect S to T. We now let x represent the vector of
scores for the source set and y the scores for the target set.

We can visualize the process for two input sets by imagining the
intermixing of different color dyes, diffusing from two sources through
a lattice representing G. The intensity and hue of the dye reveals whether
a particular node is close to either the source, target or to both sets. To
disambiguate these cases and identify points that reside only between the
sets, we determine a score for all nodes based on the relevance scores
already computed:

Z =f(r(x9A)9r(ysAT))9

where AT is the transpose of the full adjacency matrix, the function f()
is chosen to assign high relevance scores to nodes where both
r(x,A) and r(y,AT) are high and lower scores when either of the two
are low. Note that the transpose of the adjacency matrix is used to
force the diffusion to proceed upward from the targets by supplying a
graph containing reversed edges. When applied to directional diffusion
approaches like PageRank and SPIA, this has the effect of running
the algorithm backward. Of course the transpose makes no differ-
ence for undirected approaches like HotNet’s heat diffusion, as
rHotNe,(y,A)=rH0tNe,(y,AT). We refer to 2,- as the linking score for
node i. This form is attractive because it decomposes over the separate
relevance calculations, which can be ‘plugged in’ to the tied-diffusion
calculation. In this study, we chose f() equal to the min() operator to
extract genes that have intersecting evidence from both input datasets.
A set of linking genes is obtained by thresholding the linking scores
using a chosen value at selected to guarantee a desired level of speciﬁcity
as a ﬁxed multiple of the input set size described in Supplementary
Methods.

The network solutions that interconnect sources and targets can be
large, containing hundreds of genes. In addition, plug-in diffusion
approaches like HotNet and PageRank ignore the logical consistency
of the set of identiﬁed genes identiﬁed. Although it may be advantageous
to maintain such contradictory inﬂuences (e.g. to highlight places of
possible model discrepancy), it is generally difﬁcult and cumbersome to
extract meaningful information from large networks. Therefore, we intro-
duce a ﬁlter to speciﬁcally select for consistent regions of the network,
which focuses attention on better-deﬁned and more interpretable subsets
of the solution space. To this end, we add an edge between each pair of
nodes belonging to the source, target or linker gene sets. This set of edges
and nodes deﬁnes an initial graph G’ that is reduced by ﬁnding the subset
of edges that connect S to T through paths that are logically consistent
with both the input data and the network model (see Supplementary
Methods).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Motivating synthetic example

Consider a toy network in which a predeﬁned ‘core’ subnetwork
is embedded. Alterations to the state of expression of genes in the
core network are assumed to contribute, or ‘drive’, a disease
process, whereas alterations outside of the core are assumed
to have little effect. The scale-free graph simiulator in the
NetworkX library (version 1.7) was used to create a small but
realistic scale-free network (Barabasi and Albert, 1999) (see
Supplementary Methods). A core subnetwork of 12 genes con-
taining 4 ‘source’ genes and 2 ‘target’ genes was then embedded
in the NetworkX network for a total of 125 nodes and 195 edges.
In addition, six linking genes were simulated to connect the
sources to targets. The four sources and two targets are assumed
known, and their scores are provided. However, the scores for
the genes in the remainder of the embedded subnetwork are not
provided, simulating a case in which their involvement in the
disease process is unknown a priori. To identify linker genes,
scores for the core-network nodes were also simulated. For
sources, the scores reﬂect the degree of alteration such as muta-
tion frequency across a cohort or its predicted impact from
sequence-based analyses. For targets, the scores represent the
degree of differential expression observed in the targets of a
TF. We also simulated six false-positive sources representing
genes deleted or ampliﬁed by neutral ‘hitchhiking’ events or

genes with non—disease—speciﬁc tendencies to pick up passenger
mutations.

We assessed the precision of both single-source and tied-
diffusion when applied to ﬁnding a majority (four of six) of the
linking genes in the core subnetwork (Fig. 2). In the case of single-
source diffusion, the algorithm was given the same mixture of
true- and false-positive sources, including the two true-positive
targets. As expected, the single-source approach produced more
high-scoring nodes outside the core network after diffusion com-
pared with the tied-diffusion, which reﬂects a lower precision (Fig.
2A). Note that the several dozen small dark ‘hot’ nodes distal to
the core pathway do not lie between the source and targets, and
thus represent false positives. In comparison, the tied-diffusion
approach produces far fewer off-core dark nodes; the only three
such false positives all reside between a source and target (Fig.
2B). The example demonstrates how the single-source method can
diffuse heat into peripheral regions of the network in situations,
whereas tied-diffusion focuses near the core subnetwork. This
occurs because we expect false positives to occur less frequently
between two sets than proximal to any one set.

We also tested the simple k-nearest—neighbors approach
for predicting new genes based on the fraction of sources and
targets in each gene’s neighborhood. Both the single— and
double-diffusion approaches achieved signiﬁcantly higher preci-
sion on average compared with the k-nearest—neighbors
approach (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, even though the
starting number of known genes is the same for all methods, the
biased diffusion toward the target leads to a higher quantiﬁable
precision in distinguishing between the true- and false-positive
core genes in this sestting.

3.2 Tied-diffusion predicts breast cancer-related genes
with high precision

We next asked whether the tied-diffusion approach maintains
this improvement when applied to actual patient datasets. The
main assumption behind TieDIE is that more accurate pathways
are obtained by directing diffusion processes to connect genes
involved in somatic mutations to observed transcriptional effects.
Therefore, we tested whether this approach could achieve higher
accuracy than the comparable single-source approaches like
HotNet that only consider the genomic perturbations without
regard to the state of the transcriptome. We chose breast

cancer as a test system because many mutations have been iden-
tiﬁed and diverse types of data are available. Lists of implicated
genes were collected from both WikiPathways-WP1984 (Kelder
et al., 2012), a list of frequently mutated breast cancer genes from
the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer version 57
(Forbes et al., 2011) and collections from the breast cancer ana-
lysis working group of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pro-
ject (TCGA Network, 2012). At the time of acquisition, the
breast cancer dataset included patient tumor samples for 533
patients and matched normal samples for a smaller subset,
each with genomic sequencing and microarray expression data.
To incorporate a diverse set of genomic and epigenomic alter-
ations speciﬁc to a subtype, genes within regions of predicted
copy number gain or loss based on the Genomic Identiﬁcation
of Signiﬁcant Targets in Cancer algorithm (GISTIC)
(Beroukhim et al., 2007) were identiﬁed as having at least ﬁve
samples with either high-copy ampliﬁcations or homozygous de-
letions (TCGA Network, 2012). We also included as sources the
frequently mutated genes published by the TCGA Network (i.e.
genes mutated in >10 tumors). Altogether, 110 genes were col-
lected with signiﬁcant numbers of events involving 41 ampliﬁed
genes in 1258 samples, 14 deleted genes in 147 samples and 54
mutated genes in 1115 samples. One gene, BRCAl, was methy-
lated in 15 samples and had gene expression inversely correlated
in these tumors and so was also included. The background net-
work (SuperPathway; see Supplementary Methods) contained a
collection of curated transcriptional, protein-level and complex
interactions for 4737 genes, proteins and abstract concepts, with
101526 interactions (Heiser et al., 2011). To enrich for nodes
with measured data, we removed complexes from the published
SuperPathway after transferring their interactions to the incident
constituent members (see Supplementary Data Sl). All TFs used
in this study were taken as proteins linked by a transcriptional
regulatory interaction to at least one other gene in the
SuperPathway.

Compared with single-source diffusion, the tied-diffusion
approach demonstrated higher precision over an appreciable
range of recall (by varying the or parameter; Supplementary
Methods Sl.5) when used to predict breast cancer-implicated
genes from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer
and WikiPathways gene sets (Supplementary Fig. S3). Because
WikiPathways includes genes related to breast cancer without
any documented mutations, these results imply that the method
may increase our ability to identify cancer essential genes as new
drug targets (see Discussion). In realistic settings with 20% recall,
the tied-diffusion approach approximately doubles the precision
for ﬁnding the genes. At recall levels higher than 30—40%, the
performance of TieDIE relative to single-source diffusion de-
creases but TieDIE is always equal or better than single diffusion
methods. Including more sets may help increase the precision fur-
ther (e. g. proteins with perturbed kinase activity). However, the
linear decline in precision past these levels of recall indicates that
any diffusion process searching sufﬁciently far from the input sets
may be no more effective than randomly drawing candidate genes.

3.3 TieDIE reveals subtype-speciﬁc networks

We used our approach to elucidate breast cancer-related net-
works that distinguish the major breast cancer subtypes—the

so-called basal and luminal A subtypes. We chose to compare
these two because they have a clear transcriptional signature
compared with other subtypes that have a more intermediate
or heterogeneous signature, such as the luminal B and HER2-
ampliﬁed. Basal breast cancer is known to be a more prolifera-
tive form of cancer compared with the luminal type, and the
subtypes are thought to result from mutagenic transformation
of different originating cell types. Because these subtypes respond
differently to both general cytotoxic and targeted therapies, it is
important to identify pathway mechanisms that differentiate the
two subtypes to discover new treatments. The subtypes are easily
identiﬁable from transcriptome signature analysis. However,
different genomic alterations within each subtype can lead to
the same transcriptional proﬁle. For example, PIK3CA muta-
tions or PTEN deletions are both correlated with the luminal A
expression subtype. On the other hand, it is possible that seem-
ingly synonymous genomic alterations can lead to different tran-
scriptional subtypes. For example, whereas TP53 mutations are
enriched in basal cancers, some luminal cancers also harbor
TP53 mutations. Thus, network-diffusion approaches may
reveal how genomic alterations correlate with transcriptional
signatures in a subtype-speciﬁc manner.

To ﬁnd the signiﬁcant pathway differences between these
cancer subtypes, we performed a differential analysis between
99 Basal and 235 luminal A samples from the TCGA dataset.
We used a set of 110 genomic perturbations published by the
TCGA Network (TCGA Network, 2012) and applied a X2 pro-
portions test to ﬁnd those that occur with signiﬁcantly different
frequency in one subtype as compared with the other. These
uncovered 12 genes with mutations signiﬁcantly associated
with either the basal or luminal subtypes at the P=0.05 level,
used as the source gene set S. We used this set for network
search, while also weighting each source gene in proportion to
the absolute log-ratio of its perturbation frequencies in basal-
versus luminal A tumors. A small constant was added to the
frequencies to avoid log transforms of zero. The absolute log-
ratio was normalized to values between 0 and l, by dividing
by the maximum absolute log-ratio.

The target set T was deﬁned similarly. TFs were determined by
inspecting the differential expression of each TF’s predicted
target genes. TFs with activity more associated with basal
tumors should have a set of targets with high and/or low expres-
sion compared with chance expectation. We used a simpliﬁed
version of the Califano laboratory’s MARINa algorithm
(Lim et al., 2009) to ﬁnd TFs with targets differentially expressed
in basals compared with luminals. Predicted target genes were
collected from the SuperPathway. SAM (Tusher et al., 2001) was
run to derive ‘delta’ scores representing the degree of differential
expression in basal tumors compared with luminal A tumors
for each target gene. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
(Subramanian et al., 2005) analysis was then used to identify
TFs having targets with a non-random distribution of SAM
delta scores. Rather than apply a strict multiple-hypothesis
correction at the level of signiﬁcance, we instead retained TFs
with scores at a relaxed cutoff of P: 0.05 and then associated a
relevance score to each retained TF by dividing its absolute
GSEA score by the maximum absolute score. Similarly, source
genes were retained that had a Fisher’s exact of 0.05 and were
assigned relevance scores equal to the normalized absolute

Path Recall

Fig. 3. Precision of single-source (blue points) and tied-diffusion (orange
points) with different relevance scores for identifying pathways in a breast
cancer. Any paths containing even a single randomly injected ‘decoy’ link
were considered false positives. Recall measures the number of logically
consistent paths (X -axis; see Methods) out of the total possible; precision
measures the number of such consistent paths in the total number
returned. Relevance scores tested are heat diffusion (circles), personalized
PageRank (triangles) and SPIA (green circles). For comparison, included
are all-pairs shortest paths (APSP; blue circle) and prize-collecting Steiner
trees (PCST; red dot). Randomly generated networks of various sizes
were obtained to estimate the background distribution (gray dots).

log-transformed P—value. These data were used to test various
relevance measures for use in single-source and tied-diffusion
described next.

3.3.] Evaluation of relevance scores and competing methods We
evaluated the precision of different methods for their ability
to ﬁnd true network paths in the presence of randomly generated
false-positive ‘decoy’ links, which were added to the
SuperPathway to increase its number of interactions by 50%.
Any paths in the ﬁnal solutions that contained even a single
decoy link were considered to be false positive. By computing
the number of such paths that exist in the entire SuperPathway
network, we calculated the total number of true-positive paths
and used this to compute the precision and recall of the solutions
(Fig. 3).

We compared tied-diffusion with its single-source counterpart
and with competing approaches such as prize-collecting Steiner
trees as implemented by Dittrich et al. (2008), and Dijkstra’s all-
pairs-shortest-paths algorithm as a baseline approach. Three
plug-in relevance score functions were included: heat-diffusion,
Google’s personalized PageRank and SPIA (see Methods).
Diffusion strategies performed comparably with the three com-
peting methods at the speciﬁc levels of recall obtained with each
approach (green, blue and red points in Fig. 3). In addition,
we found that tied-diffusion had higher precision over varying
recall compared with the single-source equivalents. Also, the
heat-diffusion relevance function performs comparably with
personalized PageRank over moderate levels of recall, after
which personalized PageRank outperforms the heat-diffusion
kernel. Thus, given the signiﬁcant computational beneﬁts
of using a precomputed kernel (see Methods), we opted to
use the heat-diffusion approach as the principal algorithm for

events, such as TP53, to basal-associated activated TFs, such
as MYC, was found to be signiﬁcant (P<0.002) using a
permutation-based simulation (Supplementary Methods;
Supplementary Fig. S4). As expected, these paths involve sev-
eral DNA damage checkpoint genes such as ATM, retinoblast—
oma (RBl), CCNEl and pl6-ARF (CDKN2A). On the other
hand, the luminal pathways include expected genes such as the
often-targeted estrogen receptor protein (ESRl), the frequently
mutated kinase PIK3CA and E-cadherin (CDHl), a protein
that interacts with PIK3CA in the cell membrane. The two
subtypes also differ in their copy number proﬁles with basal
tumors characterized by ampliﬁcations in MYC and Cyclin E1
and deletions in pl6-ARF (CDKN2A). In contrast, luminal A
tumors tend to have ampliﬁcations in Cyclin D1, which inter-
acts in an opposing fashion on the RBl compared with basal
samples. This suggests that these luminal A tumors may have
either ‘ﬂipped’ or lost the functional interaction between Cyclin
D1 and RBl, or that the increase in transcriptional activity of
RBl can be explained by other upstream nodes such as TP53
or E2F1. Linking genes in the map may represent breast cancer
‘essential’ genes whose functions are required for altered signal-
ing logic in tumors. In support of this idea, inhibitors to PLK3
and HDACl were found to sensitize breast cancer cell lines
(Heiser et al., 2011), and targeting chromatin remodelers,
such as the HDACs, are currently the focus of clinical trial
work. Thus, TieDIE’s breast cancer network represents a
data-driven graphical summary of testable hypotheses that
can explain the simultaneous protein activation, transcriptional
activity and edge interactions found between many of the key
genes involved in breast cancer.

3.3.2 Confirmation of subtype-specific network in cell
lines Studies in immortalized cell lines provide a convenient
method for exploring the biology of various cancer subtypes.
One strategy is to identify perturbations such as drug exposure,
small interfering RNA knock-down or sets of extracellular
ligands that block or induce cell death in cancer cell lines. An
assumption in such studies is that results in cell culture can be
transferred to real tumors in vivo. At a minimum this requires
that the molecular networks in cell lines and primary tumors
have signiﬁcant similarity. Therefore, we tested the ability of
TieDIE to infer basal—luminal networks generated from a com-
pletely independent dataset collected in breast cancer cell lines.

Data for a panel of 36 breast cancer cell lines (17 basal and 19
luminal) were obtained from the Gray laboratory at Oregon
Health Sciences University (Heiser et al., 2011). We used micro-
array gene expression data from these lines to get the target input
scores and repeated the TieDIE analysis, using the same set of
TCGA sample-derived genomic perturbations as the source set.
The resulting network was found to have a high degree of over-
lap with the basal versus luminal A network derived from TCGA
data. Removing either source or target genes used in either the
cell line or tumor input sets from consideration, the linking 416
edges and 77 nodes in the cell line-derived network overlapped
with 213 edges and 52 nodes in the TCGA-derived network.
We found this result to be surprising, given the fact that a
much smaller overlap of 14 nodes (22% of the TCGA and
25% of the cell line target sets, respectively) was found in the
‘downstream’ input sets of each. Also the signiﬁcance of the
overlap was much higher according to the hypergeometric test
for the tied-diffusion result, with a P—value of 4 x 10—73
(Supplementary Fig. S5), compared with 2 x 10‘3 for the down-
stream sets only. Therefore, we conclude that each of the input
sets is close in pathway space despite the low fractional overlap,
allowing TieDIE to ﬁnd a similar set of linker genes that repre-
sent the connecting topology between each pair of input sets.
Interestingly, metabolism and biosynthetic processes were
found only in the tumor-derived networks, reﬂecting the excep-
tional characteristics of cell line growth and their media.

3.3.3 Application to sample-specific networks We next applied
diffusion approaches to characterize the speciﬁc pathways of
individual samples. For each sample, we identiﬁed which of
the TFs in the ‘downstream’ set—identiﬁed by GSEA on the
cohort-wide expression data—had at least one differentially
expressed target for that sample. We then connected these
tumor-speciﬁc active TFs to the genomic perturbations in that
sample present in a scaﬂold network, a background network
derived from a TieDIE solution from the cohort similar to the
one shown in Figure 4 except using a smaller or parameter to
obtain a larger starting network of 106 nodes and 423 edges.
To test if TieDIE provides an accurate scaffold, we performed
a search for sample-speciﬁc networks over TieDIE networks of
multiple sizes as well as the entire SuperPathway. Using the pro-
cedure of adding random decoy links as described earlier, we
measured the ratio of ‘true’ and ‘false’ paths in each sample-
speciﬁc network solution, and plotted them for each choice of
network ‘scaffold’ (Supplementary Fig. S6). The precision of the
sample-speciﬁc networks was plotted, and the mean precision
was signiﬁcantly higher when using the TieDIE summary

networks compared with using the entire SuperPathway. This
precision declines gradually as the TieDIE summary networks
increase in size, which is expected, given that they capture a
larger fraction of the possible edges in the starting network
and in the limit are identical to the SuperPathway. This shows
that the improved precision achieved by the TieDIE summary
networks is transferred to sample-speciﬁc networks, thereby
using data from the entire cancer cohort to inform the network
predictions for individual samples.

We evaluated the ability of TieDIE to connect differentially
expressed genes to at least one of the genomic perturbations
represented in the sample-speciﬁc network. Differentially
expressed genes were collected from those downstream of the
input set of TFs in the cohort’s TieDIE network. For the ma-
jority of samples, these speciﬁc networks explained a signiﬁcant
fraction of differential expression (20—80%), although for a
subset of samples none of the expression could be explained
(Supplementary Fig. S7). This may be because of missing links
in the starting network, which greatly affects the TieDIE solu-
tions, because the method cannot infer missing links. In addition,
genomic perturbations that only occur in a small minority of
samples may not be represented in the TieDIE network, as the
method, by design, will ﬁlter out pathway elements that cannot
be supported by a sufﬁcient amount of sample data. This trade-
off increases the overall quality of the networks, at the expense of
missing potentially novel, but rare, molecular mechanisms that
may drive the cancer phenotype in a small minority of samples.

3.3.4 Mapping the network of an abnormal luminal A tumor A
major goal in cancer systems biology is to infer a speciﬁc network
for each patient’s tumor and, as data become available, each sub-
clone identiﬁed within the tumor. Accurate network models could
be used to explore a large space of potential targets to kill the
tumor in silico. Therefore, we applied TieDIE to identify a path-
way solution for every tumor sample in the TCGA breast cohort.
To illustrate the results, we focus here on the non-canonical tumor
sample TCGA-BH-AOBR, which had an intermediate pathway
state between the classic basal and luminal A subtypes as evi-
denced in its CircleMap plot (Fig. 5). Tumor heterogeneity may
contribute to such ‘mixed’ samples or may reﬂect a tumor evolu-
tion distinct from the classic basal and luminal pattern. The
sample-speciﬁc analysis (Supplementary Methods S2.5) of this
tumor reveals it has a hybrid set of genomic perturbations with
both luminal A-like events, such as an AKTl mutation, and sev-
eral basal-like events, such as a TP53 mutation, and ampliﬁcations
in insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFlR) and PAKl.

Even though the patient sample has a luminal-associated
AKTl mutation, the surrounding network is more consistent
with wild-type AKTl activity. Namely, HIFlA is active, reﬂect-
ing a basal program of hypoxic response and angiogenesis, fur-
ther evidenced by increased EDNl expression. In addition, IRSl
and PIK3CA expression are basal-like, and these network prop-
erties are maintained by a basal-like PAKl ampliﬁcation that, in
this patient, may promote the activity of RACl and MAP2K1.

Interestingly, IGFlR is known to be involved in the control of
breast cancer cell growth. Blocking or reducing the activity of
this receptor has been found to reduce growth in at least one
luminal breast cancer cell line (Guvakova and Surmacz, 1997),
and increased sensitivity in trastuzumab-resistant cells are

The TieDIE network suggests that IGFlR and PAKl ampliﬁ-
cations may be driving the growth signaling pathways of this
tumor in the absence of HER2 ampliﬁcation. Experimental val-
idation of such hypotheses are difﬁcult to perform within patient
samples, but the concordance of TCGA sample-expression-
derived and cell line-expression—derived networks (see above)
suggests that experiments in cell lines could be used to address
such patient-speciﬁc hypotheses in the future.

4 DISCUSSION

We describe a new tied-diffusion method, TieDIE, that is able to
integrate transcriptional and genomic perturbation data with
biological pathway models yielding subnetworks that connect
the two distinct data sources. We demonstrate the ability of
TieDIE to generate better precision than single-source diffusion
methods in recovering both genes and paths across a wide range
of recall, with both a simulated toy example and patient data.
Current limitations of the method are described in the
Supplementary Methods section.

Because many TFs are not conventionally regarded as being
druggable, approaches such as TieDIE that pinpoint inﬂuences
upstream of these factors but still in neighborhoods proximal to
key driving mutations may provide key starting points for iden-
tifying new drug targets. A unique set of genes may be essential
for a speciﬁc tumor to thrive in its transformed environment—
the so-called synthetic-lethal partners to those genes mutated in
the tumor. Essential genes would be less likely to appear among a
list of ‘cancer drivers’ based on frequently mutated genes because
negative selection would eliminate alterations to essential genes.
Thus, methods like TieDIE can aid in ﬁnding these important
genes to potentially inhibit their activity, which can be tested
with speciﬁc inhibitors. In support of these observations, we

found that the TieDIE solutions enrich for genes that are more
sensitive to small interfering RNA targeting in cell lines
(Supplementary Results; Supplementary Fig. S8). Thus, TieDIE
might be used to provide a scaffold for simulation of the effects
of gene knockouts or drug treatments, potentially improving
both computational costs and pathway speciﬁcity, when com-
pared with a simulation performed on the entire starting
network.

The method can be used to characterize individual tumor sam-
ples, which may display unique changes in pathway logic that do
not conform to the canonical clinical subtypes. In such cases,
tumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution may produce a mix-
ture of subtypes. The challenge is to identify which pathways are
signiﬁcantly impacted in complex primary tumors and metas-
tases, and how we can leverage such information to speciﬁcally
target therapy for a particular patient.

Using data from the TCGA breast cancer cohort, we identiﬁed
a core signaling pathway that recapitulates several known aspects
of the biology distinguishing the major basal and luminal A sub-
types that was highly concordant with models derived from
breast cancer cell lines. In addition, the non-overlapping regions
of these pathways lie in areas where we expect to ﬁnd differences
such as tumor metabolism. One exciting possibility would be to
compare a patient-speciﬁc network with a previously recorded
set of networks derived from a bank of stable cell lines grown
under different conditions. Exploring therapeutic options for
that patient would then involve searching the library of cell
lines and growth conditions for those that maximally match
the patient’s network.

TieDIE holds promise for uncovering pathways relating gen-
omic perturbations to downstream transcriptional changes.
Higher precision over single diffusion was obtained both in simu-
lations and in human tumor sample datasets where a large set of
genes involved in oncogenesis are known. Even though we chose
breast cancer as a test case, the approach can be applied to a
wide variety of datasets for both basic molecular biology appli-
cations and human disease applications outside of cancer.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Computational multiscale models help cancer biologists
to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of complex biological systems
and to reveal the underlying mechanism of emergent properties.
Results: To facilitate the construction of such models, we have de-
veloped a next generation modelling platform for cancer systems biol-
ogy, termed ‘ELECANS’ (electronic cancer system). It is equipped with
a graphical user interface-based development environment for multi-
scale modelling along with a software development kit such that hier-
archically complex biological systems can be conveniently modelled
and simulated by using the graphical user interface/software develop-
ment kit combination. Associated software accessories can also help
users to perform post-processing of the simulation data for visualiza-
tion and further analysis. In summary, ELECANS is a new modelling
platform for cancer systems biology and provides a convenient and
flexible modelling and simulation environment that is particularly useful
for those without an intensive programming background.

Availability and implementation: ELECANS, its associated software
accessories, demo examples, documentation and issues database
are freely available at http://sbie.kaist.ac.kr/sub_0204.php

1 INTRODUCTION

The development and integration of complex multiscale biolo-
gical models have been a great challenge in the area of cancer
systems biology (Deisboeck et al., 2011). However, the lack of a
user-friendly and integrative software environment has made it
difficult to develop such multiscale models and derive biological
insights from them. This has been a problem particularly for
experimental scientists and modellers who have a limited soft-
ware development capability. Therefore, we have developed
‘ELECANS’ (electronic cancer system), a next generation mod-
elling and simulation platform for cancer systems biology, to
overcome such hurdles in multiscale modelling and simulation.
ELECANS is equipped with a rich graphical user interface
(GUI) studio coupled with a powerful software development

kit (SDK). This GUI/SDK combination allows users to conveni-
ently design the extra-cellular environment, cellular phenotypes
and tissue models. Cell cycle and sub-cellular components can be
modelled, executed and hot switched during simulations. The 2D
and 3D discrete or hybrid simulation environments can also be
constructed in ELECANS. Lattice types can be selected from
predefined ones or customized Via SDK. Simulation data can
be exported to text or XML files, which can be Visualized with
ELECANS software accessories. Taken together, ELECANS
helps advanced cancer research by providing a powerful and
user-friendly modelling and simulation platform for cancer
systems biology.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

Redundant n-tier architecture was used for the software design
of ELECANS (Fig. 1A). The fully object-oriented Visual C#
4.0 with Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 was used to imple-
ment the multi-agent system core of ELECANS and the
front-end GUIs. OpenTK .NET (http://www.opentk.com),
Steven Fortune’s Voronoi (Fortune et al., 1987) and Lundin’s
Mathparser (http://www.lundin.com/mathparser.aspx) libraries
were used to implement 2D/3D Visualization, off-lattice cell
distribution and cell geometry vertex definition, respectively.
ALGLIB (http://www.alglib.net) was used for matrix functions,
and an in—house partial differential equation (PDE) solver was
developed using the Alternating Directions Implicit (Chang
et al., 1991) method. This PDE solver does not support mesh
partitioning for utilization with multi-core systems, but users
can implement their own mesh-partitioning algorithms and con-
comitant PDE solvers using the ELECANS SDK for compu-
tational scalability.

The resulting software platform embeds a Studio with three
editors: Agents Editor, Environment Editor and Simulation
Editor (see Section 3 for details). The core engine object is
shared and synchronized among these editors. The software
was extensively tested by using black and white box testing
approaches, and the issues list was made available online
(Supplementary Table S1). Release notes and an updated bug
database repository are also available for download
(Supplementary Table S1). Simulation data can be Visualized
and analysed by the accompanying Matlab toolboxes or by
user developed software (Supplementary Table S1).

3 KEY FEATURES OF ELECANS

ELECANS provides a modelling and simulation studio (Fig. 1B)
with a user-friendly GUI (Supplementary Table S1) for cancer
systems biology. The salient features and concepts of ELECANS
are summarized below.

(1) ELECANS SDK—At the core of ELECANS platform,
there is a multi-agent simulation engine for processing
discretely defined cellular agents. To help construct finely
detailed models, ELECANS accommodates user
customization of its core ‘Engine’ Via SDK application
programming interface (API) (‘Elecans_base.dll’).
Modellers can selectively re—program ELECANS engine
by writing wrapper classes over ELECANS SDK.

(2) Rules Editors—The ELECANS Rules Editor helps user to
define two types of rules dynamic link libraries (DLLs):
‘Cell Rules’ and ‘Simulation Rules’. Cell properties includ-
ing cell cycle, signalling pathways and sub-cellular organ-
elles can be programmed in cell rules DLLs. Simulation
parameters and logic can be implemented as a separate
simulation rules DLL. These rules DLLs are called
during simulations where the cell rules DLLs can be hot
switched seamlessly to exhibit cellular phenotypic
evolution.

(3) Tissue Geometry Editor—ELECANS helps users to rap-
idly assemble tissue level models by creating cell assemblies
and geometries in ‘Cell Geometry Editor’. By defining
mathematical equations, users can easily create template
tissue shapes. Selected cells can then be placed at the co-
ordinates defined by the equations. The template tissues
can then be implanted in the environment, at the user-
defined location.

(4) Third Party .NET Bridges (C, Matlab, Python .NET and
R)7Numerous systems biology models have already been

implemented in C, Matlab and Python. ELECANS can
seamlessly access and execute these models Via third
party .NET DLL bridges. The DLL references to these
third party models can be added into the Rules Editors.
Simulation parameters can also be passed, and computed
results can be returned (see Supplementary Table S5 for
exemplars).

4 RESULTS AND CONCLUSION

ELECANS can be used to model diverse multi-scale biological
phenomena. Figure 1C provides an illustration of several simu-
lation examples developed and deployed in ELECANS. These
include oncogenesis by mitochondrial incapacitation during the
cell death process (Chaudhary et al., 2011) (see Supplementary
Data ‘A’ for model details and performance analysis), off-lattice
cellular tissue development, various cell geometries assembled in
ELECANS, hypoxic stress in epithelial tissue, Visualization of a
continuous description of environmental bio-molecules and a
homeostatic cross-section of colon crypt (see Supplementary
Table S3 for a step-by-step implementation). Several other ex-
amples were also provided (Supplementary Table S4) to highlight
specific modelling capabilities and advantages of ELECANS. We
also carried out comparative analysis between ELECANS and
CompuCell3D (Izaguirre et al., 2004) by assembling and simu-
lating example models (see Supplementary Data ‘B’ for details).
In conclusion, ELECANS provides a comprehensive model de-
velopment environment for multi-scale cancer systems biology
and offers a novel and powerful set of conveniently exercisable
features, which empower the computational systems biologists as
well as the experimental biologists.

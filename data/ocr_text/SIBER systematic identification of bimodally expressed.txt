ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identification of bimodally expressed genes is an import-
ant task, as genes with bimodal expression play important roles in
cell differentiation, signalling and disease progression. Several useful
algorithms have been developed to identify bimodal genes from
microarray data. Currently, no method can deal with data from
next-generation sequencing, which is emerging as a replacement
technology for microarrays.

Results: We present SIBER (systematic identification of bimodally ex-
pressed genes using RNAseq data) for effectively identifying bimodally
expressed genes from next-generation RNAseq data. We evaluate
several candidate methods for modelling RNAseq count data and
compare their performance in identifying bimodal genes through
both simulation and real data analysis. We show that the lognormal
mixture model performs best in terms of power and robustness under
various scenarios. We also compare our method with alternative
approaches, including profile analysis using clustering and kurtosis
(PACK) and cancer outlier profile analysis (COPA). Our method is
robust, powerful, invariant to shifting and scaling, has no blind spots
and has a sample-size-free interpretation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene expression at the messenger RNA level frequently operates
in two modes: baseline and underexpression or overexpression.
Although the underlying mechanisms driving these two modes of
expression (bimodal expression hereafter) may be different, [e. g.
cis/ trans regulation, DNA copy number change, microRNA
regulation, DNA methylation, transcription factor activity and
so on (Biggar and Crabtree, 2001; Chen and Widom, 2005; Louis
and Becskei, 2002)], the impact of bimodal expression is critical
to cell functioning. For instance, tissue-specific expression for
certain genes is needed for cell differentiation; the maintenance
and regulation of bimodal expression is essential to cell

signalling; the change of expression mode, especially for onco-
genes and tumour suppressors, can lead to uncontrolled cell pro-
liferation and malignant cancer.

Because of its importance, systematic identification of bimod-
ally expressed genes has received great attention, especially in
cancer research. Various methods have been proposed during
the past decade. Current methods can be put into two categories:
non-parametric and normal mixture models. For example, can-
cer outlier profile analysis (COPA) is a nonparametric method to
search explicitly for genes with ‘outlier’ expression patterns
(Tomlins et al., 2005). Speciﬁcally, the expression of each gene
is standardized by its median and scaled with its median absolute
deviation, and then ranked by a pre—specified quantile (i.e. 75, 90
or 95%) of the transformed data. They applied COPA to 132
datasets studying a variety of cancers and discovered that the
fusion of ERG and ETVl was overexpressed in 57% of prostate
cancer patients (Tomlins et al., 2005).

Methods in the second category postulate a mixture of normal
distributions for gene expression levels. For example, the profile
analysis using clustering and kurtosis (PACK) proposed by
Teschendorff et al. (2006) first filters unimodal genes with BIC
and then ranks bimodal genes using negative kurtosis. Ranking
with positive kurtosis is also possible but could be dominated by
outliers. This method was later applied to identify bimodally ex-
pressed genes with expression status linked to breast cancer prog-
nosis (Teschendorff et al., 2007). Another method, proposed by
Ertel and Tozeren (2008), is based on the likelihood ratio test
(LRT) and uses a X2 distribution with six degrees of freedom as
the null distribution to obtain P—values of LRT statistics. This
method was applied to identify bimodal genes from diverse
tissue types in mouse. More recently, Wang et al. (2009) proposed
a new definition of a bimodality index (BI). This method calcu-
lates the BI for each gene from the estimated parameters of a
two-component normal mixture model and then ranks the genes
by BI. One attractive feature of this method is that BI has an
intuitive interpretation, as it is derived from a sample size calcu-
lation. The BI method was later applied to show that melanoma
antigen family A defined a subset of triple negative breast cancers
that might beneﬁt from immune augmentation (Karn et al., 2012).

Despite their success, all of these methods (with the exception
of COPA) are designed for microarray data under the assump-
tion of normal distributions. With next-generation sequencing
(NGS) emerging as a replacement technology for microarrays,

it is important to develop valid methods for identifying bimod-
ally expressed genes from NGS data. RNAseq data, unlike
microarray data, consists of read counts mapped to each gene.
In practice, some investigators may treat the RNAseq data the
same as microarray data after some transformation (e.g. log or
Box—Cox), but the validity of such an approach has never been
investigated. Special attention may be required because of the
discrete nature of RNAseq data. Current methods for analysing
RNAseq data for differential expression rely on generalized
Poisson or negative binomial distributions rather than normal
distributions. In this article, we propose a class of generalized
bimodality indices in the framework of mixture models, includ-
ing mixtures of negative binomial, generalized Poisson or log
normal distributions. We also formally investigate the perform-
ance of naive methods using COPA and PACK, which treat
RNAseq data as equivalent to microarray data after some
transformation.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows: in Section
2, we describe several discrete models for dealing with RNAseq
data and deﬁne the generalized BI that can be used for various
mixture modelling. We also discuss RNAseq library normaliza-
tion in the context of mixture modelling. We present simulation
results in Section 3.1, where three different models are evaluated
and compared with alternative approaches, including COPA and
PACK. In Section 3.2, we analyse data from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) that further conﬁrms the effectiveness of the
generalized BI in identifying bimodal genes from RNAseq data.

2 METHODS

We propose a two-step procedure to identify bimodally expressed genes.
The ﬁrst step is to ﬁt a two-component mixture model. Speciﬁcally, three
candidate mixture models are considered. Two of these models explicitly
account for the discrete nature of the RNAseq data, whereas the third
model treats the data as continuous after some transformation. The
second step is to calculate the BI corresponding to the assumed mixture
distribution.

2.1 Mixture models for RNAseq count data

We model the observed raw counts using a two-component mixture model,
as in Wang et a]. (2009). Denote the raw count for gene g in sample S by Cg),
and the true expression by 11%“) depending on the component (or cluster)
membership c(S) that sample S belongs to. Here, c(S) = k (for k = 1, 2)
means that sample S belongs to component k with mean expression 11g, k.
To avoid model non-identiﬁability, we require 11g, 1 5 Mg, 2. As each gene is
studied separately, we may suppress the index g for simplicity of notations.
We consider three different mixture models.

Negative binomial mixture: Our ﬁrst model is motivated by the negative
binomial (NB) distribution, which is widely used to model RNAseq
data in differential gene expression analysis (Anders and Huber, 2010;
Di et al., 2011; Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010; Robinson and Smyth, 2007).
Of note, we prefer NB rather than the Poisson distribution to account for
the overdispersion observed in RNAseq data. Speciﬁcally, the probability
of observing count C, can be formulated as:

P1(Cs) = 7TfNB(Cs; M1, <1)) + (1 — JT)fNB(Cs; 1129(1)) (1)
where fNB(-; 1)., <1)) is the probability mass function for the NB distribution

with mean 1). and dispersion <1) (variance 2 M + (1)112):

F(% +3”) 1 i 1
—,<—)¢ (1 —
W + we) «m +1 <1>M +1

 

fNB(y; M9  = )y9

and 11.1 and 11.2 are the true expression levels for the two components. The
parameter <1) affects the within-group variability. Note that we assume
equal dispersion in the two distributions (we do not assume equal
variance because, for NB distribution, the variance depends on the
mean. Assuming equal variance would impose an undesirable constraint
on the component means), similar to the tagwise dispersion mode in
EdgeR (Robinson and Smyth, 2007; Robinson et al., 2010). When the
dispersion parameter <1) 2 0, Equation (1) reduces to a mixture of Poisson
distributions. The parameters (71, 11.1, 11.2, <1)) can be estimated by maximiz-
ing the likelihood function:

LOT, M1, M2,¢IC.) = 1‘1{nfNB<C5; M1,¢)+<1 — macs; Mm}

521

The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm or direct optimization can
be used for this purpose.

Generalized Poisson mixture:The generalized Poisson (GP) distribution
is another model used to describe RNAseq count data (Srivastava and
Chen, 2010). Under the two-component mixture framework, it can be
formulated similarly as:

Pr(CS) = nfGP(Cs; M1, (M) + (1 — 7T)fGP(Cs; M2, <1)) (2)

where fGP(-; 1)., <1)) is the probability density function for the Generalized
Poisson distribution with mean 1). and dispersion <1) (variance 2 <1)/1.)

, _ M M 1 y_1 M 1

pr(y,M9<1>) — wkﬁ + (1 Wm exp{ w (1 w
and 11.1 and 11.2 are the true expression levels for the two components. For
similar reasons to the NB model, we assume equal dispersion between the
two components. Note that the variance of the GP distribution is a linear
function of its mean, whereas the variance of the NB distribution is a
quadratic function of the mean. When <1) 2 1, the GP distribution reduces
to Poisson. As a result, a mixture of Poisson distribution is automatically
included in the GP model.

Normal mixture with Box—Cox transformation: Instead of accounting
for the discrete nature of the RNAseq data as in models (1) and (2), we
could treat the data as normal after some transformation. A wide class of
transformations were proposed by Box and Cox (1964), known as the
Box—Cox transformation or power transformation,

(A)_ 01—0/1 111750
yl’ — log(y,-) 111:0

)y}/y!,

As suggested by the data empirically, the optimal choice of )t for
RNAseq data considered in this article is )t = 0, which corresponds to
the log-transformation (details in Section 3.2.1). This leads to our third
model as a mixture of lognormal (LN) distributions,

Pr(CS) = JTfLN(CS; 11.1, 02) + (1 — IT)fLN(Cs; M2, 02) (3)

where fLN(-; 1)., 02) is the probability density function for LN distribution
with mean 1). and variance (72 at the log scale. The variances of the two
log-transformed distributions are assumed to be equal, similar to the
mixture of normals considered in Wang et al. (2009). We note that the
log transformation has been used previously to analyse RNAseq experi-
ments (Cloonan et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2011; McIntyre et al., 2011).

2.2 Generalized bimodality index
The BI (Wang et al., 2009) is deﬁned as:

B1 2 ml!“ gﬂzl (4)

where <3 2 I111 —1).2|/o is the effect size that measures the distance
between the two-components. The coefﬁcient ,/Jt(1 — It) is maximized
at 71 = 0.5; hence, it penalizes unbalanced allocation into the two com-
ponents. A limitation of the original BI is that it is deﬁned based on a

normal mixture with equal variance. It does not apply to normal mixtures
with unequal variance or to genes whose expressions do not follow
normal distributions (e.g. discrete distributions as in RNAseq data). To
deal with these situations, here we generalize the original BI.

The deﬁnition of BI in Wang et a]. (2009) was motivated by sample
size considerations. For a normal mixture with unequal variances, similar
calculations tell us:

_ no — :er — m2 2 (2.1/2 + Zia?

 

312 _ 5
(1 — aﬂof + 710% N ( )

Hence, the generalized BI can be calculated by:
BI: «71(1 — 71) lm _ MI (6)

11(1— mof + 7103

Formula (6) is similar to formula (4) except the effect size is modiﬁed

as: 3 =|M1—M2|/(/(1—7T)U%+7T02

generalized BI formula reduces to (4).

For other mixture models, deriving the exact BI formula directly from
sample size considerations is a tedious task, and the resulting BI may be
complicated. In general, there is no closed form for BI. However, we can
instead obtain a formula for BI under large sample approximation.
It turns out that, even for a mixture of discrete distributions, we can
obtain the same BI formula as in (6) by using the central limit theorem.
Details are provided in Supplementary Section S2.

The generalized BI for normal mixtures with unequal variance has a
sample size interpretation, as indicated in formula (5) where or and ,8 are
the type I and type II error and N is the sample size. Z0, determines the
quantile for a standard normal distribution that has right tail probability
being or. In a typical microarray or RNAseq experiment, the sample size
N is predetermined, and BI can be computed for each gene. Different
values of B1 then represent different type I and type II error. To reliably
detect useful bimodal genes, BI needs to exceed a certain threshold that is
determined by N.

. Note that when 01: <72, the

2.3 Adjusting for library size and gene length effect

Similar to microarray data, RNAseq data require proper normalization
to make meaningful comparisons between samples. A common practice
is to scale the raw counts by both the gene length Lg for gene g and the
total reads T S in sample S, giving the so-called RPKM value (Mortazavi
et al., 2008). For this reason, we introduce a normalization term, d“, into
our mixture models. This term accounts for technical effects, including
lane, ﬂow-cell and library preparation effects. In the case of RPKM,
d“ = LgTS. Directly scaling the count data by dgﬂ would transform
the data onto continuous scale that cannot be modelled by NB or GP
distributions. Instead, we incorporate d“ through the expected count as:

E[Cg,sldg,59 0(5)] = dg,SMg,c(S)

Hence, we only need to replace the component distribution
f(CS; uc(s),¢) in Section 2.1 with f(CS; d“ 1149,10. The rest of the infer-
ence remains the same.

As pointed out by Bullard et a]. (2010), RPKM normalization per-
forms poorly when there are highly differentially expressed genes. More
robust normalization methods such as TMM (Robinson and Oshlack,
2010) and the method used in DESeq or DEXseq can be applied (Anders
and Huber, 2010; Anders et al., 2012). Inclusion of such normalization
methods to our models is similar, only adding a scaling factor to the
component means.

3 RESULTS

We let NB, GP and LN denote the three models described earlier
in the text. For each model, let BINB, BIGB and BILN be the

generalized BI computed with respect to that model. The funda-
mental question to be addressed is which model yields more
robust and more reliable identiﬁcation of bimodal genes from
RNAseq data. To evaluate the performance of different models,
and to compare with alternative methods, we ﬁrst conduct simu-
lation studies. We generate artiﬁcial RNAseq data from one of
the three models. Regardless of which model is used to generate
the data, we compute BI using all three models. This procedure
allows us to evaluate the performance of BI under misspeciﬁed
models; this step is important because the true underlying model
for RNAseq data is often unknown in practice.

In the second scenario, we look at TCGA data, where both
microarray and RNAseq data are available for the same set of
breast cancer samples. We establish the ‘true’ bimodal status
for a subset of genes by applying the existing methods to the
microarray data, then manually conﬁrming the results by visu-
ally inspecting the distributions. For this subset of genes, the
misclassiﬁcation rates (of genes as bimodal or unimodal) are
expected to be low. We then compute BI from the RNAseq
data using all three models. Because there is a good correspond-
ence between microarray and RNAseq data (Marioni et al.,
2008), we can evaluate the performance of the BI models by
constructing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
that test their ability to correctly match the microarray-based
gene classiﬁcations.

3.1 Simulation study

In this subsection, we consider RNAseq data generated from
one of the three mixture models, which will be referred to as
NB, GP and LN datasets, respectively.

3.1.] NB, GP and LN datasets For each of the NB, GP
and LN datasets, we simulate both bimodal and unimodal genes,
which are generated from two-component and one-component
mixture models, respectively. To cover a spectrum of settings
in practice, we allow the mixture proportion parameter ft, the
effect size 6 and the sample size to vary. As we know the true
status of the generated gene data, we can construct ROC curves
that evaluate the ability of the BI models to correctly predict
the true status. The performance of BINB, BIGP and BILN
will be evaluated using the area under the corresponding ROC
curves (AUC).

Bimodal genes: For the bimodally expressed genes, we choose
different combinations of parameters to represent a wide range
of bimodal shapes. Speciﬁcally, It takes values between 0.1 and
0.5 with a step of 0.1 (7T 2 0.6, . . . , 0.9 are omitted by symmetry).
In practice, 7T 2 0.1 or 0.2 leads to an unbalanced mixture,
whereas 7T 2 0.3, 0.4 or 0.5 leads to more balanced mixture dis-
tribution. We also use a range of effect sizes, 6 = 2.5, 3, 3.5,4.
To simulate genes that have different expression levels, we set
,ul 2 5 for LN model (corresponding mean at exponential scale
is 244.7), ,ul 2 100, 1000, 5000, 10000 for NB model and
,ul 2 100, 1000, 2000,4000 for GP model. For LN, we set
a = 1 because of the equal variance assumption (corresponding
variance at exponential scale is 34.5). We assume equal disper-
sion between the two groups for both NB and GP models. As a
result, we set the dispersion parameter ¢ = 0.1 for NB model and
o = 0.5/1.1 for GP model. This implies that in both NB and GP

models, the variance is a quadratic function of the mean, as
typically seen in RNAseq experiments (see mean-variance rela-
tionship in Supplementary Figure S15). We use Equation (6)

to solve for pa = ,al 4— 6I/(l — we? 4— 7102. All possible
combinations of 71,111 and 6 are considered in each model,
which results in 20 (5 x l x 4) settings in LN datasets and 80
(5 x 4 x 4) settings in NB and GP datasets. The parameters
were chosen to mimic real data. For each setting, we simulate
100 genes, which lead to 2000 bimodal genes in LN datasets and
8000 genes in NB or GP datasets. We choose four different
sample size settings (N: 50, 100, 200 and 300) for each dataset.
Data generated from the LN model is continuous, but is rounded
to the nearest integer.

Unimodal genes: The unimodal genes are simulated from a
one-component model. To match the parameter settings for
the bimodal genes, we generate unimodal genes from the larger
component corresponding to the mixture proportion >0.5. Equal
numbers of unimodal and bimodal genes are simulated and
combined to form LN, NB and GP datasets.

3.1.2 Eﬂect 0f the mixture proportion To examine the
effect of the parameter 71' that describes the proportion of sam-
ples in the smaller group, we prepared box-and-whisker plots of
BI as a function of 71' (Fig. 1). For each of the three datasets (for
N = 300), we ﬁt three mixture models to obtain parameter esti-
mates and calculate BI. The distributions when the data come
from a unimodal distribution are included at 71' = 0. Ideally, we
expect BI to increase as 71' increases from 0 to 0.5. We see this
behaviour when we analyse each dataset using the same model
that was used to simulate it. The NB model, however, exhibits
different behaviour when the model is misspeciﬁed; BI values for
71' = 0.1 are lower than in the unimodal case and peak when
71' = 0.2. The GP model behaves well on the GP and NB datasets,
but behaves poorly when the true model is LN. The LN model,
by contrast, has similar performance regardless of which model
was used to simulate the data.

3.1.3 Performance evaluation metrics A useful measure to
evaluate the performance of BI is the ROC curve. Figure 2
and Supplementary Figure S1 plot the ROC curves for the
three BIs, namely, BINB, BIGP and BILN, in NB, GP and LN
datasets, respectively, for different sample sizes. Speciﬁcally,
Supplementary Figure S1 shows the performance when the
assumed distribution is correct, whereas Figure 2 shows the per-
formance under misspeciﬁed models. Note that the evaluation
using AUC is limited, as it puts the performance under different
false-positive (FP) rates on an equal footing. Hence, to explicitly
control FP, we also evaluate the performance by looking at the
power under predeﬁned FP rates in Tables l—3.

3.1.4 Performance under correctly specified models Supple-
mentary Figure S1 shows that when the model is correctly spe-
ciﬁed, the three methods perform similarly in terms of AUC.
Even when the sample size N = 50, the ROC curve is still satis-
factory. For FP rate and power under the correctly speciﬁed
model, details are given in column BINB in Table 1, column
BIGP in Table 2 and column BILN in Table 3. Note that the
largest power in each row is bolded. We see that under the cor-
rectly speciﬁed model, BINB, BIGP and BILN all perform reason-
ably well. In all three models, increased sample size improves
power by reducing the cut-off of BI when controlling the same
type I error. For the same sample size and type I error, the LN
model has slightly larger power (in average 1.9% larger) than the
NB model. Both the LN and the NB model perform signiﬁcantly
better than the GP model (the power of NB is 8.9% larger than
GP) when FP <0.l. Nevertheless, the GP model has larger
power at larger FP, which makes its AUC better than the NB
model and almost matches that of the LN model (Supplementary
Figure S2). There is a minor decline of AUC in the NB and GP
models. This happens because the BI formula for the NB and GP
models relies on large sample approximation and hence loses
some efﬁciency. Note that the FP rate and power under different
sample sizes for the LN model agrees with the results in Wang
et al. (2009).

(<3 2 2.5,3,3.5,4) and applied all three models to compute BI. Boxplots for 71 = 0 give the distribution of BI when the data are simulated from
a unimodal distribution. Performance under the correctly speciﬁed model is similar for all three methods, with equal splits (71 = 0.5) yielding the largest
BI values. The NB model (grey) performs extremely poorly under misspeciﬁed models, with BI values for 71 = 0.1 clearly less than the unimodal
BI values and peak BI when 71 = 0.2. The GP model (red) performs poorly on data simulated from the LN model. The LN model (green) performs

consistently regardless of how the data are simulated

Fig. 2. Robustness of NB, GP and LN models. ROC curves for the three mixture models ﬁtted on NB, GP and LN datasets are compared under sample
size N = 50, 100, and 200 (N 2300 is omitted because of space limitations). Various bimodal shapes as characterized by different distances
(6 = 2.5,3,3.5,4) and component size (7T 2 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5) are simulated to mimic real data. The LN model is most robust and provides

satisfactory performance even when the model is misspecified

3.1.5 Performance under misspecified models In practice,
the true underlying model is often unknown. It is important to
investigate the robustness of the proposed BIs under a misspeci-
fied model. Here, we compare the performance of the three
models and study the effect of model misspecification. Figure 2
shows the ROC curves under misspecified models. We see that
the performance varies, suggesting different robustness among
the three models.

For the NB datasets, where the true model generating the
simulated data is the NB model, Table 1 shows the smallest BI

needed to achieve a given type I error and corresponding power
to detect bimodal genes for the three mixture models with
N: 50, 100, 200 or 300. BILN provides competitive performance
compared with the true model, whereas BIGP performs much
worse. For the GP datasets, BILN even dominates BIGP at all
FP rate and sample sizes listed in Table 2 (however, not at all
possible FP rates).

For the LN datasets, the power of BINB and BIGP stemming
from misspecified models is much lower than that of BILN under
the same FP rate (Table 3). More importantly, when the sample

size is small or moderate, the power of BINB and BIGP is even
smaller than the FP rate or half of the power achieved by BILN at
best. When the sample size is relatively large, i.e. N 2200, the
performance of BIGP improves and almost matches BILN (AUC:
0.95 versus 0.97, Fig. 2). However, increasing sample size only
improves the power of BINB at low FP rate while decreasing the
power at high FP rate. Overall, the AUC of BINB only increases
slightly with sample size. The reason is that the fitted NB model
fails to detect most bimodal genes with 71' = 0.1 in the GP and
LN datasets (Fig. 1). These results suggest that BINB and BIGP
are highly sensitive to model misspecification. Hence, from the
spectrum of settings considered, BILN outperforms the other two
methods in terms of power under the correctly specified model as
well as robustness under a misspecified model.

3.1.6 Difficulty in identifying the true model In general, it is
desirable to identify the true underlying model (e. g. NB, GP, LN

or other models). However, this task is extremely challenging
(and perhaps impossible) in practice. For example, when BIC
is used as the criterion for model selection, the BICs from NB,
GP and LN models are almost indistinguishable for all three
simulated datasets (Supplementary Figure S4). Compared with
misspecified models, the true model does not show a clear ad-
vantage in terms of BIC. In this sense, each of the three models
provides similar fits for the data, despite the fact that they have
different performance in terms of identifying bimodal genes. This
finding suggests that robustness of BI is important because of the
practical difficulty in identifying the true model.

3.1.7 Robustness to outlier data In practice, microarray
and RNAseq data often contain outliers because of various tech-
nical artifacts such as library preparation and amplification
bias as well as biological variations that make the expression
(RNAseq data after log transformation) deviate from the
assumed normal distribution. Ignoring these outliers might lead
to FF calls. Therefore, in addition to examine the robustness to
model misspecification, we also examine the robustness to outlier
data. We consider two kinds of outlier data, namely, data of
heavy tailed distribution such as t distributions and data contain-
ing extreme values. The detailed summary of our investigation is
in Supplementary Section S3. Extensive simulation studies
suggest that BI is robust to both heavy tailed distributions and
extreme values (Supplementary Figures S5 and S6).

3.1.8 Comparison with alternative approaches Although
there are no existing methods specifically designed to identify
bimodal genes in RNAseq data, it is still meaningful to compare
the performance of BI with naive methods that treat the RNAseq
data as similar to microarray data after some transformation
[‘log(data+l)’]. To this end, we compare BILN with PACK and
COPA (full details are provided in Supplementary Section S4).
When there are no outliers, Supplementary Figure S9 shows the
performance of PACK is better than BILN or COPA in most
cases. However, PACK has difficulty detecting bimodal genes
with 20—80% or 30—70% split, as the kurtosis values in these
cases are near zero (Supplementary Figure S10). The reason

SIBER

 

PACK still achieves a good ROC curve is mostly attributable to
the model selection step. When the data contains outliers, the
performance of BI and COPA is more robust than PACK
(Supplementary Figures S13 and S14). The reason is that
model selection by BIC would ﬁag most unimodal genes with
outliers as bimodal candidates, which make it difﬁcult for PACK
to classify them correctly. In fact, BIC would claim that ~40%
of the genes are bimodal candidates in the breast cancer data in
the section. Supplementary Figure S11 shows that COPA fails to
detect bimodal genes with 50—50% or 10—90% split at the chosen
10% quantile. We have to mention that COPA has a tuning
parameter, which is the quantile used to rank the genes. If this
parameter changes, it is possible to identify a different set of
bimodal genes (Supplementary Figure S12). However, the down-
side of using different quantiles is that it is difﬁcult to obtain a
consensus ranking of the genes as well as evaluate the FP rate.
Based on our simulation studies, we recommend the use of BI in
practice for its ability of detecting a wide variety of bimodal
genes, having no blind spots and being robust to outliers.

3.2 Real data analysis

We applied our methods to the TCGA Breast Cancer Dataset
(BRCA) that contains 341 breast cancer samples for which
both microarray and RNAseq data are available. The micro-
array data can serve as a reference to the RNAseq data in
detecting bimodal genes.

3.2.1 LN model fits best for RNAseq data To examine
which of the three models is most appropriate for real
RNAseq data (and to identify the optimal A in the Box—Cox
power transformation), we need to identify reliable bimodal
and unimodal genes in this dataset with high ﬁdelity. For this
purpose, we use the microarray data to guide our search. As
genes with null expression are usually beyond the detection
limit of microarray technology that may mislead the training
set, we only looked at genes with mean expression >l.5
(Supplementary Figure S16). We then selected 142 candidate
unimodal genes with BI<0.5, which ensures that there is no
apparent bimodality. For candidate bimodal genes, we used
BI> 1.2 as minimum requirement and found 181 candidates.
All these genes passed manual examination. The complete
curated gene list is provided in Supplementary Table S3.

Figure 3a shows an example gene where we used proﬁle like-
lihood to identify the optimal transformation indexed by A.
Figure 3b shows the histogram of optimal A for all genes.
Figure 3c shows that the optimal A for the candidate unimodal
genes is concentrated at 0, suggesting that a log-transformation
is optimal. Figure 3d shows that the LN model recovers almost
all bimodal and unimodal genes in the curated dataset, whereas
the performance of the NB and GP models is limited. This
suggests that the LN model (with log transformation of the
normalized counts) provides a better ﬁt of real RNAseq data
for the purpose of identifying bimodal genes.

data for three genes known to be bimodally expressed in breast
cancer (Fig. 4b—d). Supplementary Table S1 shows the number
of genes identiﬁed at different BI cut-off, with FDR obtained
through simulation. A complete list of BI values for all genes is
listed in Supplementary Table S2.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we have proposed and compared three mixture
models for systematic identiﬁcation of bimodally expressed
genes. All models are designed to deal explicitly with the discrete
nature of RNAseq data. Our method follows the ideas in
Wang et al. (2009) by ﬁrst modelling the data through a two-
component mixture coupled with computing the BI from the
mixture ﬁt that prioritizes bimodally expressed genes, which
have a large distance between the two modes and sufﬁcient
samples in each mode. We extended the previous deﬁnition of
BI, so that it can be applied to a mixture of unequal variance and
mixture of discrete distributions.

Our deﬁnition of BI was motivated by sample size calcula-
tions. The resulting formula is intuitive and easily interpretable:
BI rewards balanced allocation of the samples into two compo-
nents (as it is largest when 71' = 0.5) and large distance between
the two modes as deﬁned by 6. The derivation through sample
size calculations paved the road for computing BI under other
mixture distributions or a mixture with unequal variance. Here,
we proved that the generalized BI applies to mixture of discrete
distributions, such as negative binomial and generalized Poisson.
In such cases, the BI formula is an approximation to the exact
formula, which does not have a closed form. Our simulation
shows there is only minimum power loss in this approximation.
For other mixtures, such as a mixture of t—distributions, the
BI formula still applies. It is also possible to derive a non-
parametric version of BI as done in (Al-watban and Yang,
2012). In all cases, the resulting BI formula is invariant under
shifting and scaling, which is an appealing feature.

Among the three models proposed, the LN model performs
best in both simulation and real data analysis. Under the cor-
rectly speciﬁed model, all three models perform similarly.
However, both the NB and GP models are highly sensitive to
model misspeciﬁcation. In comparison, the LN model is robust.
Our analysis of BRCA RNAseq data further demonstrated the
superior performance of the LN model. Applying the method
of Box—Cox showed that a log transformation is optimal for
the majority of genes. For manually curated unimodal genes,
the optimal transformation was always log transformation.
In terms of recovering unimodal and bimodal genes that had
been manually selected based on available microarray data, the
LN model provided much better performance (AUC: 0.964 ver-
sus 0.686 and 0.666). At ﬁrst, it may be a little surprising that
such a simple transformation performs so well. In practice, how-
ever, all microarray data are already log transformed before any
formal analysis. Inherently, this might be because of the nature
of mRNA abundance level in the cell.

It remains an open question whether the lognormal model
also performs well in other tasks such as differential expression
analysis for RNAseq data. Comparisons with date of methods
for differential expression in RNAseq have focused on the

negative binomial and generalized Poisson models (Bullard
et al., 2010; Kvam et al., 2012). The nature of the two tasks
differs; identifying bimodally expressed genes is unsupervised,
whereas differential expression analysis needs to know the treat-
ment condition and hence is supervised. So, the results obtained
here for bimodality do not generalize directly to differential ex-
pression analysis. The role of normalization complicates matters;
in our LN analysis, we still normalized the count data using the
TMM mode. Further study is required.

For parameter estimation, both the EM algorithm and
Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods can be applied.
From previous work, the results from EM and MCMC are
known to be similar (Wang et al., 2009). The advantage of the
EM algorithm is its computational efﬁciency. This is extremely
useful when there are thousands of genes to be evaluated.
In comparison, MCMC usually takes a much longer time to
converge. However, MCMC provides a posterior distribution
rather than just a point estimate for the parameters. Because
similar results were obtained by both estimation methods, we
focused here on the EM implementation. For the LN mixture
or normal mixture, the MCLUST package can be used with core
functions written in Fortran (Fraley and Raftery, 2002). Our
SIBER package also provides parallel computing capability to
further boost the computation speed.

Although several approaches have been proposed for micro-
array data, it is not easy to apply them to RNAseq data. For
example, LRT relies on simulation to obtain the approximate X2
distribution. The theoretical null distribution is not available, as
the parameter is located on the boundary under the null hypoth-
esis, which violates the regularity conditions of the LRT. The
most serious problem with BIC is oversensitivity (Wang et al.,
2009); it gives too many candidate bimodal genes, with a high-FP
rate. Moreover, BIC is not invariant under shifting, scaling or
changes in sample size. This makes it impossible to rank bimodal
genes based on BIC. After log transformation, both PACK and
COPA can be applied. PACK performs well when the data
satisfy the normality assumption. The performance of PACK
suffers from both heavy tail distribution and extreme values.
COPA instead is robust. However, at a given quantile, COPA
can detect a limited set of bimodal genes and thus have blind
spots. Therefore, it is necessary to ﬁne tune this parameter when
using COPA. Another comparison of these methods and correl-
ation analysis with survival time can be found in Hellwig et al.
(2010). Our approach compares favourably with existing
approaches, and it is the ﬁrst method that can be applied suc-
cessfully to both microarray and RNAseq data.

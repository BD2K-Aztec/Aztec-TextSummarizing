ABSTRACT

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) has opened up a new era for
small RNA (sRNA) exploration. Using HTS data for a global survey
of sRNAs in 26 angiosperms, elevated GC contents were detected
in the monocots, whereas the 5/-terminal compositions were quite
uniform among the angiosperms. Chromosome-wide distribution
patterns of sRNAs were investigated by using scrolling-window
analysis. We performed de novo natural antisense transcript (NAT)
prediction, and found that the overlapping regions of trans-NATs,
but not cis-NATs, were hotspots for sRNA generation. One cis-
NAT generates phased natural antisense short interfering RNAs
(nat-siRNAs) specifically from flowers in Arabidopsis, while one in
rice produces phased nat-siRNAs from grains, suggesting their
organ-specific regulatory roles.

1 INTRODUCTION

In eukaryotes, small RNAs (sRNAs) are essential regulators in
gene expression, heterochromatin formation and virus resistance
(Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009). The plant sRNAs are divided
into two classes: microRNAs (miRNAs) and siRNAs. The ~21—nt
miRNAs exert post—transcriptional regulation on targets mostly
through cleavage. However, the 20—24—nt siRNAs are more diverse.
Two subspecies, natural antisense short interfering RNAs (nat—
siRNAs) (Borsani et al., 2005) and trans—acting siRNAs (Allen
et al., 2005; Williams et al., 2005), have been characterized. Besides
cleavage effect on targets, numerous siRNAs were reported to
mediate DNA or histone methylation (Li et al., 2008; Lister et al.,
2008). The development of sensitive high—throughput sequencing
(HTS) technology has enabled our efﬁcient sRNAs exploration
(Simon et al., 2009), and there are a number of huge HTS datasets
available (Gustafson et al., 2005; Johnson et al., 2007). A few
analytical frameworks have been proposed for analyzing such data
(Fahlgren et al., 2009), but it is clear that these datasets contain a
wealth of information that has not been fully explored.

TThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two authors
should be regarded as joint First authors.

Here we report a large—scale analysis of HTS data for plant sRNAs.
We have surveyed the GC contents, 5’ —terminal compositions and
chromosome—wide distribution patterns of sRNAs. De novo natural
antisense transcript (NAT) prediction unveiled that the overlapping
regions of trans—NATs were hotspots for sRNA generation. We
have identiﬁed novel cis—NATs that produce phase—distributed
nat—siRNAs which are likely involved in organ—speciﬁc regulation.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data resources

The plant sRNA HTS data and the genomic information were retrieved from
public databases. See Supplementary Tables SI and S2 for details.

2.2 Distribution analysis of sRNAs, transposable
elements (TEs) and non-TEs

Scrolling—window analysis was performed as previously described (Kasschau
et al., 2007). The 200 000—nt window and 100 000—nt scroll were used. The
number of sRNA or gene loci located within each window was counted to
produce distribution plots. For sRNA ‘total’ loci, regardless of how repetitive
the loci were, the total number of sRNA loci within each window was
calculated. For ‘unique’ loci, only the sRNAs possessing unique genomic
loci were taken into account. ‘Repeat—normalized’ locus analysis was done
by dividing the locus count of a certain sRNA in a speciﬁc window by the
total locus count of this sRNA in the genome. For non—TE or TE distribution,
the number of annotated non—TEs or TEs (annotations were retrieved form
TAIR 8 and TIGR 6 for Arabidopsis and rice, respectively) in each window
was calculated to generate distribution plots.

2.3 NAT prediction

Prediction was performed as previously described (Wang et al., 2006; Zhou
et al., 2009). Annotated transcription units in each plant were used (see
genomic resources in Supplementary Table S2).

For cis—NATs, if a pair of overlapping transcripts was located on opposite
strands at adjacent genomic loci, and the overlapping region was longer than
30 nt, then they were considered as a cis—NAT pair.

For trans—NATs, BLASTN (release 2.2.20; downloaded from
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/) (Altschul et al., 1990)
with default parameters was used to search for transcript pairs with high
sequence complementarity, and the following criteria were used to classify
the trans—NATs: based on the BLAST results, if the longest overlapping
region of one transcript pair covered more than half the length of either
transcript, this trans—NAT was considered to be ‘high—coverage’ (HC). If
the two transcripts had a continuous complementary region longer than
100 nt, they were classiﬁed as a ‘100nt’ pair. The predicted NATs with
transcripts annotated as transposons or pesudogenes were removed, and

those containing transcripts with alternatively spliced forms were considered
as distinct ones. Furthermore, DINAMelt (Markham and Zuker, 2005) was
used to verify whether the overlapping regions could melt into RNA—RNA
duplexes in silico. All the BLAST—based trans—NATs were subjected to
DINAMelt hybridization validation. The trans—NAT was reserved for
further analyses if it satisﬁed: (i) at least 80% similarity existed between
DINAMelt—based longest pairing region and BLAST—based one and (ii) the
largest bubble predicted by DINAMelt in the longest pairing region should
be no longer than 10% of the region. Owing to the heavy computational
work, the BLAST—based trans—NATs containing transcripts longer than 5 kb
were not subjected to DINAMelt validation. Instead, it was considered as
veriﬁed trans—NAT, if BLAST—based longest pairing region was longer than
10% of its longer transcript.

2.4 Enrichment of sRNA loci in NAT overlapping
regions

The NATs possessing sRNA loci in the overlapping regions were analyzed.
For each NAT: ﬁrst, we counted the number of sRNA loci in the overlapping
region (NW-(1 5 i 5 n), ‘n’ represents the number of the cis— or trans—NATs
analyzed) and that in the whole NAT (Ngi). Subsequently, the length of the
overlapping region (L0,- : 2x the length of the pairing sequence of either
transcript) and the total length of the NAT composed by two transcripts
(Lgi) were measured. Finally, the ratios (no. of sRNA loci per kb), A0,- =
N0,- /L0,- and A g,- = N g,- /Lg,-, were considered as the sRNA locus densities of the
overlapping region and the whole NAT, respectively. The average density of
the overlapping regions (A0 = ELMO,- / n) and that of the whole NATs (Ag 2
ELIAgi/n) were calculated, respectively. Besides, the sRNA enrichment
score (S,- =A0i/Ag,-) of the overlapping region of each NAT was calculated.
Then, the average score (S = 217215,- /n) for all the cis— or trans—NATs was
obtained.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Sequence characteristics

The HTS data of 16 eudicots and 10 monocots were retrieved
from public databases (Supplementary Table S1). All the redundant
sequences and those containing ambiguous nucleotide ‘N’ were
removed. Considering the length range of sequences in the resulting
datasets, the l8—34—nt sRNAs were analyzed. We found that the plant
sRNAs were enriched in 21—24 nt, particularly in 24 nt (Fig. 1A),
which was the typical length of endogenous siRNAs (Voinnet, 2009).

3.1 .1 GC contents Compared to the eudicots, GC contents of the
21—24—nt sRNAs, especially the 23—24—nt ones, were elevated in the
monocots (Fig. 1B). The raw sRNA sequencing data were ﬁltered
through genome—wide mapping. Thus, 16 eudicots and 9 monocots
with available genomic information (Supplementary Table S2)
were further analyzed. The size of ﬁltered dataset was greatly
reduced largely owing to the incomplete genomic information of
most plants investigated. However, after ﬁltering, the 21—24—nt
sRNAs were still the dominant contribution, and the elevated GC
contents could be observed in the 21—24—nt sRNAs in the monocots
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Previous studies proposed that monocots
probably possessed higher genomic GC contents than eudicots (Yu
et al., 2002). Here, we show that the GC contents of the dominant
sRNA portion ranging from 21 to 24 nt are higher in the monocots.
Hence, we suggest that the GC contents of these sRNAs were
discrepant after the eudicot—monocot divergence, and are still under
selective constraint in both plant classes.

For each plant species, the x—axis indicates the length range, and the y—axis
indicates the percentage of the sRNAs in speciﬁc length. (B) GC contents
are higher in the monocots. Seventeen sRNA populations (the x—axis) were
analyzed. The y—axis indicates the average GC content. (C) 5/—terminal
compositions. The 20—25—nt sRNAs were analyzed. For each plant species,
the y—axis indicates the percentage of the sRNAs beginning with a speciﬁc
nucleotide (the x—axis). The total number of sRNAs analyzed in each plant
is listed on the upper right of (A).

3.1.2 5’ -terminal compositions The 20—25—nt sRNAs were
analyzed. Interestingly, the 20—22—nt sRNAs, and especially the
21—nt ones, begin with U predominantly, whereas the 23—25—nt
sRNAs, especially the 24—nt ones, predominantly begin with A. This
phenomenon is quite uniform among the angiosperms (Fig. 1C).
After ﬁltering as mentioned above, similar result was obtained
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, the terminal composition turning
point forms between the 20—22—nt sRNAs beginning with 5’ U and
the 23—25—nt ones beginning with 5’ A, which is quite uniform
among the angiosperms. It has been known that the length and
the 5’ —terminals of plant sRNAs are critical factors involved
in loading sRNAs into ARGONAUTE—associated RNA—induced
silencing complexes (Voinnet, 2009). Based on our result, we
propose that the sRNA loading mechanism is quite conserved among
the angiosperms, and this mechanism was born before the eudicot—
monocot split. Selection pressure on the 5’—terminals of the sRNAs
of different lengths should be maintained to ensure this evolutionary
conservation.

3.2 Chromosome-wide distribution

‘Total’ loci (see Section 2 for the deﬁnition) were highly enriched
in the centromeres/pericentromeres in Arabidopsis, but much less
conspicuous in rice (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3). Consistent
with previous report (Kasschau et al., 2007), the densities of

Fig. 2. sRNA distribution and generation. (A) Chromosome—wide
distribution patterns of sRNAs, TEs and non—TEs in Arabidopsis and rice.
Ovals represent the centromeres. (B) Chromosome—wide distribution patterns
of sRNAs in Medicago, poplar, grapevine and sorghum. For both (A and B),
the x—axis measures the chromosome length (chromosome 1 of each plant
is shown), and the y—axis indicates the number of the loci in each scrolling
window. Note that the maximum values plotted were capped according to
the maximum values on the y—axes. ‘Total’: total sRNA loci. ‘Normalized’:
normalized sRNA loci. ‘Unique’: sRNAs with unique loci. See Section
2 for their detailed deﬁnitions. (C) Phased sRNA loci in the overlapping
region of the cis—NAT in Arabidopsis. Two distinct 24—nt phases are shown.
(D) Phased sRNA loci in the overlapping region of the cis—NAT in rice. For
both (C and D), the phased sRNAs are indicated by square brackets (sRNAs
supported by HTS data are indicated by solid brackets and others by dashed
ones). The sRNAs supported by HTS data were numbered, and those with
unique loci were marked with asterisks. The gray shadows indicate potential
cleavage sites for nat—siRNA initiation. The physical positions of the partial
overlapping regions are indicated. The information of the NAT genes is
shown at the bottom.

‘unique’ (see Section 2) and ‘repeat—normalized’ (see Section 2) loci
were greatly reduced, and peaked in the pericentromeric regions
of Arabidopsis. The reduced locus densities were also observed in
rice, whereas no extensive enrichment was detected surrounding the
centromeres. Instead, many isolated peaks were scattered along the
rice chromosomes. In both Arabidopsis and rice, the ‘total’ locus
distribution was similar to that of the TEs, but complementary
to the non—TEs’, indicating that sRNAs play an essential role in
TE transposition control (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3).
The same analysis of sRNAs was performed in Medicago, poplar,
grapevine and sorghum. Extensive sRNA enrichment was detected
on all the sorghum chromosomes, indicating the positions of its
centromeres approximately (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S4).
No conspicuous density peak of ‘repeat—normalized’ or ‘unique’ loci
was observed in these four plants.

An in—depth analysis of sRNA distribution was performed in
Arabidopsis and rice (Supplementary Table S3). As previously
reported (Lu et al., 2005), a dominant portion of sRNA loci (~80%)
were assigned to intergenic regions. More loci were assigned to
the exons and less to the introns in Arabidopsis compared to rice.
However, this difference may be caused by, at least partially, the
distinct gene structures, as the average length ratio between introns
and exons was lower in Arabidopsis than rice.

Taken together, our results support the previous notion that
a sizable portion of plant sRNAs can be mapped to TEs and
intergenic regions (Llave et al., 2002; Mette et al., 2002). However,
the ‘total’ sRNA loci were reported to distribute evenly along
the rice chromosomes (Nobuta et al., 2007). Here, 20 times
more sRNAs than previously used were included, and our more
representative result showed that the ‘total’ loci were enriched in
the centromeres/pericentromeres in rice, but not as conspicuous as
Arabidopsis. The distribution patterns of ‘total’, ‘repeat—normalized’
and ‘unique’ sRNA loci appear to be species speciﬁc.

3.3 SRNA generation in NATs

NATs formed by complementary transcripts are divided into
two classes: cis— and trans—NATs. Although several groups have
predicted NATs in Arabidopsis and rice (Wang et al., 2006; Zhou
et al., 2009), we carried out de novo prediction using uniform criteria
(see Section 2). All the predicted NATs could serve as a repository
for further analysis (Table l and Supplementary Material S1).

The overlapping regions of both cis— and trans—NATs were
reported to be hotspots for sRNA generation in rice (Zhou et al.,
2009). We extended our survey to eight plants (Table l), and our
results showed that sRNA loci were enriched in the overlapping
regions of trans—NATs (paired t—test, P < 0.0001), except for papaya
(P = 0.2838) when ‘unique’ loci were calculated. However, we found
a less clear—cut description of sRNA loci in cis—NATs. The sRNA loci
were enriched in the overlapping regions of the cis—NATs in papaya
and rice. In Arabidopsis, the ‘total’ loci were enriched (P < 0.0001)
but not the ‘unique’ loci (P = 0.0448). Contrarily, the enrichment of
the ‘unique’ loci was signiﬁcant in maize (P < 0.0001), but not the
‘total’ loci (P = 0.0458). Only three and 84 cis—NATs with sRNA loci
in the overlapping regions were identiﬁed in poplar and sorghum,
respectively, but no signiﬁcant enrichment was detected.

Two cis—NATs with phase—distributed sRNA loci in their
overlapping regions were identiﬁed in Arabidopsis, and one such cis—
NAT in rice. Two distinct 24—nt phases exist in the overlapping region
formed by ATZGOZ795 and ATZGOZ800 (Fig. 2C). In this cis—NAT,
both the phased sRNAs called nat—siRNAs and the ones mediating
ﬁrst cleavage to initiate the phases have unique genomic loci.
More interestingly, all these sRNAs were exclusively cloned from
ﬂoral organs in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Table S4), indicating
their organ—speciﬁc origin and potential involvement in plant
reproduction. The rice cis—NAT was formed by LOC_0s12g10510
and LOC_0s1 2g] 0520 (Fig. 2D). Except for osa—stl, six phased
nat— siRNAs and the ones initiating the phase were exclusively cloned
from rice grains (Supplementary Table S5), indicating their organ—
speciﬁc origin and potential role also in reproduction. Additionally,
four 24—nt phases and three 2l—nt ones were found in the overlapping
region of another cis—NAT in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Most nat—siRNAs in this cis—NAT were also from reproductive
organs, such as inﬂorescences, ﬂower buds and siliques.

Zhu’s group reported that nat—siRNAs generated from the
overlapping region of one cis—NAT in Arabidopsis were involved
in salt tolerance, and suggested that the cis—NAT deﬁned a mode
of siRNA biogenesis and function, which might be applied to other
cis—NATs in eukaryotes (Borsani et al., 2005). Here, additional cis—
NATs producing phased nat—siRNAs in their overlapping regions
have been identiﬁed, and they are potentially involved in organ—
speciﬁc regulation. Similar to the previous work (Borsani et al.,
2005), all the phased nat—siRNAs and the sRNAs mediating ﬁrst
cleavage to initiate the phases are not miRNAs. Hence, the cis—NAT—
deﬁned mode of nat—siRNA generation and function can extend to
the angiosperms.

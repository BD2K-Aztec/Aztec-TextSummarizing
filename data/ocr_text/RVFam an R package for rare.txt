Abstract

Summary: Family-based designs offer unique advantage for identifying rare risk variants in genetic
association studies. There are existing tools for analyzing rare variants in families but lacking
components to handle binary traits properly and survival traits. In this report, we introduce an R
software package RVFam (Rare Variant association analysis with Family data) designed to analyze
continuous, binary and survival traits against rare and common sequencing variants in genome-
wide association studies (GWAS) involving family data. Single and multiple variant association
tests were implemented while accounting for arbitrary family structures. Extensive simulation stud-
ies were performed to evaluate all the approaches implemented in RVFam.

1 Introduction

It was hypothesized that rare variants poorly represented in existing
GWAS may underlie the unexplained heritability by common vari-
ants identified to date. Emerging exome sequencing and whole gen-
ome-sequencing studies are designed to capture rare variants in
human genomes. The regularity condition assumed in many existing
GWAS tools for common variants may become invalid when
applied to rare variants (Chen et al., 2011, Chen et al., 2014).
Family-based designs are advantageous for identifying rare risk vari-
ants such as private or pedigree specific mutations that may only be
enriched with family samples. Ignoring family structure could intro-
duce bias in the results and selecting unrelated sample from family
data reduces power. There are existing tools that can handle rare
variant analysis with family samples, such as rareMetalWorker
(http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/RAREMETALWORKER),

sequta (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sequta), and
EPACTS (http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/EPACTS). The three
packages report test based on score statistic from linear mixed

effects model (LME) for continuous traits measured on family sam-
ples. For binary traits, sequta can only analyze unrelated sample,
and RareMetalWorker and EPACTS use LME and treat binary traits
as continuous, so the effect estimate is not interpretable. None of
the package can handle survival traits. In this report, we introduce
RVFam that is designed to provide tools for family samples for all
three types of traits: continuous, binary and survival. RVFam can
perform single variant and multiple variant pooled analysis for a sin-
gle cohort as well as producing score statistics formatted for meta-
analysis in sequta. We performed extensive simulation studies to
assess the approaches implemented in RVFam.

2 Methods

2.1 Single variant analysis

For continuous traits, we use LME with a fixed effect for geno-
type score, and with person specific random intercepts that are
correlated only within family according to relationship coefficients

(Supplementary Methods). This model is implemented in RVFam by
calling lmekin() in R coxme package (version 2.2-3). Different from
aforementioned packages that report test based on score statistic,
Wald test result is reported in RVFam. For binary traits, we imple-
mented generalized linear mixed effects model (GLMM) with a lo-
gistic link and with same fixed and random effects as LME except
an exchangeable within family correlation structure for random ef-
fects. This model is implemented in RVFam by calling glmer() in R
lme4 package (version 1.1-7). For survival traits, Cox-proportional
hazard with shared frailty (random effect) in each family is imple-
mented by calling coxph() in R survival package (version 2.37-7).
Likelihood ratio (LR) test P-values are reported for binary and survival
traits as inﬂation was observed for Wald test in our simulations
(Supplementary Table 52A, 53A). The methods and tests for all three
types of traits (Supplementary Methods) were chosen based on statis-
tical properties as well as results from our extensive simulation studies.

We also provide interface with sequta so that RVFam results
can be directly meta-analyzed in sequta. The required R object by
sequta for meta-analysis contains the score statistic and its vari-
ance for each SNP that was converted from our Wald or LR test
(Supplementary Methods).

2.2 Gene-based analysis

For gene-based analysis, we implemented two burden tests ((Li and
Leal, 2008) denoted by T, and (Madsen and Browning, 2009) denoted
by MB) that are powerful when the directions of association are the
same across multiple variants, and one direction insensitive test: the
sum of squares (SSQ) test (Pan, 2009). For burden tests, a super variant
is created by summing the weighted genotype score of selected SNPs
within a gene region (weight = 1 for T and (q(1 — q))_1 for MB, where
q is minor allele frequency (MAF)). The super variant is analyzed using
the same method as in single variant analysis. For SSQ, Z-statistics or
signed LR statistics from single variant analysis are squared and
summed up for selected SNPs within a gene or region. Under null hy-
pothesis that none of the SNPs are associated with the outcome, SSQ ~
X201), where n is the degrees of freedom depending on the covariance
matrix among the statistics (Supplementary Methods). We have previ-
ously shown through empirical studies that the SSQ had similar power
as SKAT for unrelated sample (Wang et al., 2012).

3 Input and output

Input to this package are SNP genotype data coded as 0, 1, and 2 for
number of copies of coded allele, phenotype and covariate data, and
pedigree data. It also requires gene annotation for each SNP for form-
ing pooled multi-variant tests, a comma delimited file with MAF
(based on all genotyped sample), and an RData containing genotype
correlation matrix for the defined genes or regions. The output from
RVFam includes: (i) a text file containing single variant test results
including beta, se, and P-value; (ii) text files of gene-based test results;
(iii) an RData containing score statistics that can be directly used by
sequta for meta-analyses. See RVFam Document in Supplementary
information for details of input and output.

4 Simulation studies

We conducted extensive simulation studies to evaluate the validity
and power of the tests implemented in RVFam. The simulations
used the real genotypes of 225 160 nonsynonymous, stop-altering,
and splice variants captured on the Illumina HumanExome
BeadChip, and simulated phenotypes of 3880 Framingham Heart

Study (FHS) Offspring samples from 1147 families. Description of
the genotyping was reported previously (Peloso et al., 2014). In sum-
mary, about 90% of the variants have a MAF 0.05 or less, and 50%
have MAF lower than 0.0001. We used SOLAR (Almasy and
Blangero, 1998) to simulate phenotypes conditional on the observed
family structures in FHS sample. Survival traits were simulated to
follow a Weibull distribution with normal distributed random ef-
fects incorporated in the scale parameter. Binary traits were simu-
lated based on an additive threshold model. To evaluate the validity
of the methods, 100 replicates of phenotypes were generated inde-
pendent of all genetic variants, with a polygenic heritability 0.25 for
the random effects. To evaluate power, we assign various effects to
5 SNPS (pairwise R2 < 0.01, MAF 0.0003, 0.001, 0.004, 0.02, 0.25,
respectively) in the ABO gene that contains a total of 36 SNPs
(Supplementary Table Sl-B). We took the event variable from sur-
vival traits as our binary traits to evaluate power. MAF ranges of (0,
0.01) and (0, 0.05) were used for gene-based analysis.

4.1 Simulation results

The type I error and power for RVFam analysis of continuous traits
are presented in Supplementary Table Sl-A,B,C. We found that the
single variant and gene-based tests (Supplementary Table Sl-A)
yielded valid genome-wide type I error rates (<0.05) as well as SNP-
wise and gene-wise type I error rates (2.22><10_7 and 2.85><10_6,
respectively, by Bonferroni correction). The power simulations
(Table Sl-B,C) show that gene-based tests can achieve higher power
than single variant test, and SSQ test is more powerful than T and
MB especially when QTL of opposite effects are included (SSQ5).

The type I error and power for RVFam analysis of binary traits
are presented in Supplementary Table SZ-A, B. RVFam had valid
type I error rates when prevalence was 5% or higher. Inflation was
reduced significantly by applying a minor allele count filter among
cases when prevalence is 0.01 (Supplementary Table SZ-A). Power
results show similar pattern as described in continuous traits.

The type I error and power for RVFam analysis of survival traits
are presented in Supplementary Table S3-A, B. We observed valid
type I error rates for RVFam single SNP analysis and T but slight in-
ﬂation for MB and SSQ tests in some cases. To explore this further,
we calculated type I error by MAF groups and found inflation only
in SNPs with MAF < 0.001. This explains why MB is inflated be-
cause it weights each SNP by its inverse MAF and highlights ex-
tremely low MAF SNPs. By aggregating single SNP results, inflation
also occurs to SSQ for genes with multiple extremely low MAF
SNPs. We propose a remedy to reduce inflation in low MAF single
SNP results and SSQ that divides the single SNP chi-square statistics
by the genomic control parameter for rare SNPs (e.g. minor allele
counts < 5) and then re-computes SSQ. Power results (S3-C) show
similar pattern as described in continuous and binary traits.

It took RVFam 46, 64 and 19 min for continuous, binary and sur-
vival traits, respectively, to complete all single variant and gene-based
tests for chromosome 21 containing 2671 SNPs and 254 genes for a
sample of 400 three-generation pedigrees each with 10 members on a
linux cluster with 4 16-core 2.3 GHz AMD Opteron 6276 processors
and 256 GB of RAM running CentOS 6 with Sun Grid Engine.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: N-linked glycosylation occurs predominantly at the
N-X-T/S motif, where X is any amino acid except proline. Not all
N-X-T/S sequons are glycosylated, and a number of web servers for
predicting N-Iinked glycan occupancy using sequence and/or residue
pattern information have been developed. None of the currently avail-
able servers, however, utilizes protein structural information for the
prediction of N—glycan occupancy.

Results: Here, we describe a novel classifier algorithm, NGlycPred, for
the prediction of glycan occupancy at the N-X-T/S sequons. The al-
gorithm utilizes both structural as well as residue pattern information
and was trained on a set of glycosylated protein structures using the
Random Forest algorithm. The best predictor achieved a balanced
accuracy of 0.687 under 10-fold cross-validation on a curated dataset
of 479 N-X-T/S sequons and outperformed sequence-based pre-
dictors when evaluated on the same dataset. The incorporation of
structural information, including local contact order, surface accessi-
bility/composition and secondary structure thus improves the predic-
tion accuracy of glycan occupancy at the N-X-T/S consensus sequon.

1 INTRODUCTION

N—linked glycosylation, the attachment of glycan to the amide
nitrogen of asparagine, is an ubiquitous co-/post-translational
modiﬁcation in eukaryotic cells that occurs as the nascent pro-
tein is extruded into the endoplasmic reticulum. Glycosylation
plays an important role in a number of biological processes ran-
ging from protein folding, sorting and degradation (Helenius and
Aebi, 2004) to immune response (Rudd et al., 2001). N—linked
glycosylation occurs predominantly at the sequons N—X-T and
N—X-S, with rare occurrence at N—X-C, where X is any standard
amino acid except proline (Gavel and von Heijne, 1990). Studies
suggest that about half of N—X-T/S sequons might be

glycosylated (Petrescu et al., 2004; Zielinska et al., 2010), and
an accurate algorithm that could predict the glycan occupancy
(the presence or absence of a glycan) at these sequons would be
useful for understanding and utilizing this ubiquitous co-/
post-translational protein modiﬁcation.

A number of algorithms trained with sequence or sequence-
based information have been developed to improve the predic-
tion of N—linked glycosylation (Caragea et al., 2007; Gupta
et al., 2004; Hamby and Hirst, 2008; Sasaki et al., 2009). To
that end, Gupta et al. (2004) trained artiﬁcial neural networks
on the surrounding sequence of the N-X-T/ S sequons; Caragea
et al. (2007) trained ensembles of support vector machine classi-
ﬁers based on sequence neighbors; Hamby and Hirst (2008) used
the random forest (RF) algorithm (Breiman, 2001) with pairwise
patterns; and Sasaki et al. (2009) trained support vector machine
classiﬁers based on surrounding sequence, whole protein se-
quence and sub-cellular localization information. Statistical ana-
lyses, however, have demonstrated that in addition to sequence
differences, there are also structural differences between protein
residues in spatial proximity to glycosylated versus non-
glycosylated sites (Petrescu et al., 2004). Thus, the incorporation
of protein structural information might be expected to improve
the prediction of the glycan occupancy. The incorporation of
structural features in the prediction of N—linked glycan occu-
pancy was previously reported in a conference proceeding
(Karnik et al., 2009); however, the statistical differences between
structure-based and sequence-based predictors were not ana-
lyzed, and no publicly available software or web server was
provided.

In this article, we report the development of, the theoretical
basis for, and the properties of a novel predictor, NGlycPred,
which predicts the glycan occupancy of N—X-T/ S sequons of
eukaryotic proteins. NGlycPred was trained on N—linked glyco-
sylated proteins with structures available in the RCSB PDB data-
base (Berman et al., 2000) using the RF algorithm (Breiman,
2001). In essence, the RF algorithm uses multiple classiﬁcation
trees constructed with different boot strap samples from the ori-
ginal data, with each tree participating in the ﬁnal classiﬁcation.
The algorithm is efﬁcient and can handle numeric and nominal
values simultaneously. The ability to predict N—glycan occupancy
should allow for a better understanding of overall protein struc-
ture as well as the aforementioned biological processes and may
also assist in the design of hyperglycosylated immunogens
(Pantophlet et al., 2003). Statistical analyses showed that

NGlycPred performed signiﬁcantly better than the sequence-
based predictors generated using the same dataset. NGlycPred
is available in the form of a web server and—to our knowledge—
is the ﬁrst publicly available web server to predict N—glycan oc-
cupancy at N-X-T/S sequons that is trained on information
derived from experimental structures.

2 METHODS
2.1 Dataset

2.1.] Structure SelectiOn The pipeline for selecting the proteins
and the N-X—T/S sequons to be used for training and testing is shown
in Figure 1. Potential N-linked glycosylated PDB entries were down-
loaded from RSCB PDB on 29 July 2011 using the advanced search
functionality with the following criteria: (1) Macromolecule Type:
Contains Protein: Yes; (2) Chemical ID: NAG; (3) X-Ray Resolution:
52.5A; and (4) Remove similar sequence at 70% identity, resulting in 525
PDB ﬁles. Structures with missing atoms were removed, resulting in 336
PDB ﬁles. Only the PDB ﬁles with N—X—T/S sequons and at least one
direct asparagine—N—acetylglucosamine (ASN—NAG) linkage were kept,
resulting in 262 PDB ﬁles. Finally, only eukaryotic expressed proteins
(as annotated in the PDB header) were considered, resulting in 154
ﬁnal PDB ﬁles.

2.1.2 SequOn SelectiOn For each PDB ﬁle, N—X—T/S sequons were
extracted from only one chain (with the highest number of NAGs) per
unique protein molecule, resulting in 522 N-X-T/S sequons. Sequons
were kept for further consideration if there were at least 10 residues
ﬂanking upstream and downstream of the sequon ASN residue, resulting
in 479 N—X—T/S sequons. The sequons with ASN—NAG linkage were
considered glycosylated. The sequons without ASN—NAG linkage were
considered potentially non-glycosylated, except for those listed as
N-linked glycosylated (experimentally veriﬁed sites only; potential and
predicted sites were not taken into account) under ‘Sequence annotation
(Features)’ section in UniProt (preiler et al., 2004)—in these cases, the
sequons were also considered glycosylated. The structure factor ﬁles cor-
responding to the PDB ﬁles with potential non-glycosylated residues, if
available, were downloaded from the Electron Density Server (Kleywegt
et al., 2004) and 2FO —FC (S: 1) and F0 — FC (S: 3) maps were Visua-
lized using COOT (Emsley et al., 2010) (F0: structure factor observed; FC:
structure factor calculated). Electron density adjacent to the ASN ND2
was examined to assess whether a NAG group could be modeled. In a
number of cases signiﬁcant electron density was Visible and real-space
reﬁnement of a NAG group into the density resulted in at least 10 out
of the 14 non-H atoms of the NAG group inside either the 2FO — FC or
F0 — FC electron density. Reﬁnement using the deposited structure fac-
tors and PDB ﬁle with the newly introduced NAG groups using
PHENIX (Adams et al., 2010) indicated that the introduction of a
NAG group to these residues was correct. These potential non-
glycosylated ASN residues were then considered as glycosylated. The
ﬁnal dataset consisted of 97 non-glycosylated and 382 glycosylated
N-X-T/S sequons (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). To avoid positive
bias due to the unbalanced dataset, four identical copies of the
non-glycosylated sequons were presented in the dataset to oversample
the minority class.

2.2 Learning properties

A number of structural, sequence and pattern properties were determined
for each sequon to be used as variables for the learning process. All
non-amino acid molecules, including glycans, were stripped off from
the PDB ﬁle for structural property calculations.

2.2.] Structural properties

2.2.1.1 Surface accessibility The surface accessible area of the
sequon ASN side chain was calculated by NACCESS (Hubbard and
Thorton, 1993) using a probe of radius 2 3A (roughly the size of a mono-
saccharide). Surface accessibility (SA) was encoded as a binary variable
with a cutoff of 3.7A2, as the entries with SA under this cutoff were highly
biased toward non-glycosylated.

2.2.1.2 Surface composition Surface composition (SC) was
deﬁned as the amino acid composition of the residues surrounding the
sequon ASN side chain amide nitrogen. Residues were considered if any
of their side chain atoms were within a certain distance r to the the ASN
side chain amide nitrogen. Six different types of encoding for the surface
composition variable were evaluated, given by the combinations of three
different distance thresholds r (4, 4.5 and 5A) and two different length
vectors: (a) a 20—bit integer vector with each bit representing the number
of surrounding residues of each of the 20 standard amino acid types and
(b) an 8-bit integer vector where amino acids with similar properties were
grouped together (PRO, small hydrophobic (GLY, ALA), large hydro-
phobic (LEU, VAL, MET, ILE, CYS), aromatic (TYR, PHE, TRP),
positively charged (ARG, LYS, HIS), negatively charged (ASP, GLU),
polar O (SER, THR) and polar N (ASN, GLN)).

2.2.1.3 Secondary structure The secondary structures (SS) for the
sequon ASN and ﬁve residues prior to/after the ASN were calculated
using DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983). 66 different types of encoding
for the SS variables were evaluated: one bit (11) or two bits (55) encoded
with the DSSP output of either one or two residues from the 11 residues.
Each bit could be eight different values (alpha helix, isolated beta-bridge,
extended strand, 310 helix, pi helix, hydrogen bonded turn, bend and
irregular).

2.2.1.4 Local contact order The local contact order (CO), used as
an estimate of the degree of local protein folding, was deﬁned as the
following:

1 NL
: _. ,., 1
co LNL ZS, ()

where l is the full length of the protein, L is the number of local resi-
dues under consideration (see below), NL is the total number of resi-
due contacts involving at least one of the local residues and SiJ- is the
sequence separation in terms of residue number between contacting
residues 1' and j. Two residues 1' and j were deﬁned as contacting residues

if any atom of one residue ifrom the L local residues was within 6 A of any
atom of the other residue j. Contact order was encoded as a binary vari-
able (gT for local contact order equal to or greater than a threshold T and
IT for local contact order less than T). Different combinations of L
(2w+ 1, where w=0 to 10, centered at the sequon ASN) and T (0.1,
0.15, 0.2, 0.25 and 0.3) were used to calculate the weighted average of
the Gini impurities (IQ) of the two subsets from the dataset split by CO:

N gT 1 NIT 1

1G — m - gen-(1 —ng.-) + m - gain —f1T,.), (2)
where NgT (MT) is the number of entries where local contact order is
greater (less) than the threshold T and ngJ- (flu) is the frequency of entries
in the gT (1T) set of i = 1 (glycosylated) or 0 (non-glycosylated). To reduce
the computational complexity, only the 10 combinations of L and T that
gave the lowest Gini impurity when splitting the dataset were evaluated
during the 10—fold cross-validation step (Supplementary Table S3).

2.2.2 Sequence { SEQ ) w residues immediately prior to and after
the sequon ASN residue. Nine different windows (w=2—10) were eval-
uated. Three different encoding methods were evaluated for the SEQ
variable, resulting in a total of 27 encoding schemes:

0 a K (=2w)—bit vector with each bit encoding the amino acid type at
each position (standard scheme).

0 a 20 K-bit binary-valued vector with each bit encoding the presence or
absence of a speciﬁc amino acid at each position (0/1-based scheme).

0 a 20 K-bit binary-valued vector with each 20 bits encoding the
Blosum62 (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992) string of a speciﬁc amino
acid at each position (Blosum62-based scheme).

2.2.3 Pattern { PA ) The ability for all single-position patterns
within three residues from the sequon ASN to classify glycosylated
from non-glycosylated sites was ﬁrst evaluated in terms of Gini impurity
as described above. The 10 patterns with the lowest Gini impurity are
shown in Supplementary Table S4. The PA variable was implemented as
a binary-valued vector of one to ﬁve bits where each bit represents the
presence or absence of 1 of the top 10 patterns. The total number of
possible encoding schemes for the PA variable was 637.

2.3 Algorithm training

RF (Breiman, 2001) models were generated and tested on our dataset
using the 10—fold cross-validation scheme. We used the RF package im-
plemented in Weka 3.6.5 (Hall et al., 2009), with each model containing
1000 trees (—I 1000). The number of input variables to be used to deter-
mine the decision at a node was equal to logzM + 1, where M is the total
number of input variables (the default setting). The maximum depth of
each tree was set to ‘unlimited’. The models were ranked in terms of
balanced accuracy (BACC), deﬁned as follows:

TP + TN
2-(TP+FN) 2-(TN+FP)’

 

BACC = (3)
where TP is the number of true positives, TN is the number of true
negatives, FF is the number of false positives and FN is the number of
false negatives. AUC (area under the ROC [receiver operating character-
istic] curve) for each of the 10 tests in 10—fold cross-validation was also
calculated by Weka, and the mean and 95% conﬁdence interval (95% CI,
estimated using mean :I: (2.262 - SE/x/I0), assuming a t-distribution with
nine degrees of freedom) of AUC of the 10 tests were calculated (SE:
standard error). Five different classes of RF predictors were generated
and evaluated:

(1) Structural properties only: combinations of 3 or all 4 of SA, SC, SS
and CO: a total of 9036 encoding combinations.

(2) Sequence only: a total of 27 combinations.

(3) Pattern only: a total of 637 combinations.

(4) Structural properties and sequence: top 200 encoding schemes
from (1) (in terms of BACC) combined with all sequence combin-
ations: a total of 5400 encoding combinations.

(5) Structural properties and pattern: top 200 encoding schemes from

(1) combined with top 100 encoding schemes from (3) a total of
20 000 encoding combinations.

2.4 Statistical analysis

Welch’s t—test (Welch, 1947) was used to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the
performance difference between all pairs of the best RF predictors
(ranked by overall balanced accuracy) from each of the ﬁve classes.
The balanced accuracy values from each of the 10-fold experiments
were used for comparison. The calculated P—values were further adjusted
using the false discovery rate approach (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).
To analyze the stability of the performances of the best RF predictors
from each of the ﬁve classes, a total of 200 cross-validation repeats were
performed for each predictor with a shufﬂed dataset and a different
random number seed for RF generation. The mean, standard deviation
and 95 % CI of the balanced accuracy values from the 200 runs
were determined. The calculations were performed with the software R
(R Development Core Team, 2005).

2.5 Comparison with available methods

The sequences of our dataset were submitted to the NetNGlyc (Gupta
et al., 2004), EnsembleGly (Caragea et al., 2007) and GPP (Hamby and
Hirst, 2008) servers to evaluate the prediction accuracies of these servers
on the dataset described here. For each server, the default settings were
used, except for EnsembleGly where the Blosum62 string kernel option
was used as suggested in the original publication.

3 RESULTS

Five classes of RF predictors were deﬁned: predictors trained
on structural properties only, predictors trained on sequence
only, predictors trained on pattern only, predictors trained on
structural properties and sequence, and predictors trained on
structural properties and pattern (see ‘Methods’ section). The per-
formances of these predictors were evaluated based on lO-fold
cross-validation of our dataset. The performances of the best
RF predictors, ranked by balanced accuracy (the average value
of true-positive rate and false-positive rate), from each of the ﬁve
classes are shown in Table l. The adjusted P—values from Welch’s
t—test on the pairwise comparison of these ﬁve predictors are
shown in Supplementary Table S5. The 10 best models from
each class are shown in Tables 2 and 3, Supplementary Tables
S6 and S7. The performance of the best predictors from each of
the ﬁve classes was generally stable, as suggested by the results
from a total of 200 cross-validation calculations performed on
different shufﬂed datasets (Supplementary Table S8).

3.1 Predictors trained on structural properties only

The best predictor from structural properties only, trained on all
four structural properties, achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.663
in the lO-fold cross-validation of our dataset, with true-positive
rate of 0.770 and false-positive rate of 0.443. Six of the top 10
predictors trained on all four structural properties (Table 2);

three trained with surface accessibility, secondary structure and
surface composition and one trained with surface accessibility,
secondary structure and local contact order. For all top 10 pre-
dictors, the secondary structure property was represented by
DSSP values at the sequon ASN position and the ﬁfth residue
position preceding the ASN. In the top 10 list, eight of the nine
predictors that were trained with the surface composition prop-
erty used the eight-bit vector implementation, suggesting that
grouping of residue types for the surface composition attribute
can improve the accuracy.

3.2 Predictors trained on sequence only

The best predictor trained on sequence achieved a balanced ac-
curacy of 0.547 in the lO-fold cross-validation of our dataset,
with true-positive rate of 0.950 and false-positive rate of 0.856.
The balanced accuracy of this predictor was signiﬁcantly lower
than that of the best predictor trained on structural properties
(P<0.005). From the list of the top 10 predictors of the class
(Table 3) it can be seen that 0/1- or Blosum62-based schemes
generated more accurate predictions. Compared with the pre-
dictors trained on structural properties, predictors trained on
sequence had a much higher false-positive rate. The same was

(NetNGlyc, EnsembleGly, GPP) on the dataset described here
(Supplementary Table S10). For all three methods, the
false-positive rates were >0.7.

3.3 Predictors trained on patterns only

The best predictor trained on sequence-based patterns, deﬁned as
the presence of a speciﬁc amino acid type at a speciﬁc position
relative to sequon ASN, achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.623 in
the lO-fold cross-validation of our dataset, with true-positive rate
of 0.607 and false-positive rate of 0.361. The balanced accuracy
of this predictor was lower than that of the best predictor trained
on structural properties but higher than that of the best predictor
trained on sequence. Compared with predictors trained on se-
quence, the predictors trained on pattern had a much lower
false-positive rate. Notably, 9 of the top 10 models (Table 4)
used patterns +2 THR and —1 GLY, emphasizing the import-
ance of these two patterns.

3.4 Predictors trained on structural properties and
sequence

The best predictor trained on structural properties and sequence
achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.574 in the lO-fold
cross-validation of our dataset, with true-positive rate of 0.932
and false-positive rate of 0.784 (Supplementary Table S6). The
balanced accuracy of this predictor was higher than that of the
best predictor trained on sequence but was signiﬁcantly lower
than that of the best predictor trained on structural properties
(P<0.05).

3.5 Predictors trained on structural properties and
patterns

The best predictor trained on structural properties and
sequenced-based patterns achieved a balanced accuracy of
0.687 and an average ROC AUC of 0.703 in the lO-fold
cross-validation of our dataset, with true-positive rate of 0.694
and false-positive rate of 0.320. This predictor was the best pre-
dictor among all ﬁve classes. The balanced accuracy of this pre-
dictor was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the best predictor
trained on sequence (P<0.001) and that of the best predictor
trained on structure and sequence (P<0.05). Of note, this pre-
dictor used only three out of the four structural properties (SA,
SS and CO; Supplementary Table S7).

3.6 NGlycPred server

The best predictor trained on structural properties and
sequenced-based patterns was implemented as the NGlycPred
Server, available to the general public. The server identiﬁes the
N-X-T/ S sequons from the given input PDB ﬁle and predicts the
glycan occupancy of each sequon. The computational time for
each execution depends on the size of the input PDB ﬁle. For an
input PDB ﬁle of <1000 amino acid residues, the predictions
could be generated within <30 s. For an input PDB ﬁle of
>2000 amino acid residues, run-times could take up to a few
minutes.

4 DISCUSSION

Our results indicate that the incorporation of structural informa-
tion can improve the prediction of glycan occupancy of N—X—T/ S
sequons. In our study, the RF predictors generated using struc-
tural information, with or without additional pattern informa-
tion, outperformed the predictors trained on sequence
information with statistical signiﬁcance, as well as a number of
other sequence-based servers that were evaluated on our dataset
(Supplementary Table S10). Overall, a comparison between dif-
ferent predictors and their underlying algorithms is complicated
by the fact that the predictors (and their respective servers) were
developed and optimized on different datasets. Nevertheless,
analyses based on our dataset clearly demonstrated that pre-
dictors generated using structural properties could give better
predictions than those generated solely by sequence information.
Differences in local structural features between glycosylated and
non-glycosylated sequons were not only observed in our dataset
but also in previous studies (Petrescu et al., 2004). Moreover,
recent evidence has shown that speciﬁc amino acid side chains
could directly stabilize the ﬁrst N—acetylglucosamine of the
glycan (Culyba et al., 2011), suggesting that in addition to se-
quence, structural features could directly affect glycan
occupancy.

A comparison of the best predictors built on all four and three
of the four structural properties (Table 5 and Supplementary
Table S9) suggested that the SS property might be the most im-
portant factor in the improvement of the prediction accuracy.
Surface accessibility played a lesser role: although the sequons
with SA less than the 3.7A2 threshold had a much higher ten-
dency to be non-glycosylated (13 of the 97 non-glycosylated
sequons compared with 2 of the 382 glycosylated sequons), SA
of >96% of the entries (464 out of 479) were above the threshold,
and thus the property was less effective for improving prediction
accuracy. The reason for the lesser effect of local contact order
on prediction accuracy could be similar: for example, in the case
of L = 13, non-glycosylated entries were enriched in the set with
CO >03 (4 of the 97 non-glycosylated sequons compared with 4
of the 382 glycosylated sequons); C0 of >98% (471 out of 479),
however, were below the 0.3 threshold.

Several limitations are inherent to our current approach. The
154 protein structures used to generate the dataset only encom-
pass a very small subset of the eukaryotic proteome. Although
we only selected crystal structures with resolution better than
2.5A to generate the dataset, the presence or the conformation
of speciﬁc amino acid or sugar residues could still be ambiguous
in some cases. To increase the reliability of the computational
predictions, the dataset used in our study was extensively
curated. Since the eukaryotic and prokaryotic N-linked glycosy-
lation schemes are different (Kowarik et al., 2006), sequons were
only selected from PDB ﬁles where the proteins were expressed in
eukaryotic systems. To reduce the incidences of false negatives in
the dataset, the sequons without ASN-NAG linkage from the
PDB ﬁles were considered glycosylated if they were annotated as
such in UniProt (preiler et al., 2004). The incidences of false
negatives were further reduced by considering as glycosylated
sequons for which the ASN-NAG linkage could be modeled in
the electron densities from the PDB Structure Factor ﬁle.
Nevertheless, false negative sequons could still be present in
the dataset, in cases where the glycosylation site is occupied
but both the glycan electron densities were absent and the site
was not annotated as glycosylated in UniProt. Furthermore, the
ratio of glycosylated to non-glycosylated entries in the dataset
was adjusted to roughly l:l, while the actual ratio of glycosylated
to non-glycosylated sites in reality is unknown. Additional cur-
ation of the dataset could thus further improve the accuracy of
the predictions. Tuning of some of the RF input parameters,
such as the maximum depth of each tree and the number of
input variables to be randomly selected at each node, could fur-
ther optimize the performance of the different predictors.

The structural features chosen for the NGlycPred algorithm
are less sensitive to the exact coordinates of the protein, and
therefore should be suitable for use with homology models. In
our analysis, we noticed that the knowledge of side chain torsion
angles improved the prediction of N-linked glycan occupancy
(data not shown). However, since side chain torsions are more
difﬁcult to predict for homology models and might differ dra-
matically before/after glycosylation, we chose not to include this
feature in our models so that the NGlycPred algorithm would be
applicable to both crystal structures and homology models.
Nonetheless, it should be noted that the accuracy of the predic-
tions may be affected by the quality of the homology models.
Also, as NGlycPred uses structural properties of the protein as
input, different predictions would be generated for sequons on

sequence-identical domains if the tertiary/quaternary context is
different (for example, sequons on the outer-domain of HIV-1
gpl20 monomer versus sequons on an outer-domain—only
construct).

Finally, we note that differences in glycosylation do occur be-
tween different eukaryotic species (e. g. mammalian versus insect)
as well as in different tissues of the same organism; further
improvements in N—glycan prediction may be needed to incorp-
orate these variables. Furthermore, as the addition of N-linked
glycosylation typically occurs during protein translation, with
the N—X—T/ S sequon recognized by the glycosylation machinery
as the nascent polypeptide is synthesized and extruded into
the endoplasmic reticulum, the theoretical link between struc-
ture-based information and N—glycan prediction is unclear: the
protein is not yet folded when N—glycans are incorporated.
Differences in N—glycan prediction accuracy between artiﬁcially
incorporated sites and naturally evolved sites may provide in-
sight into this conundrum.

The NGlycPred algorithm described here should provide
better prediction of glycan occupancy, and such a prediction is
likely to have a number of applications. For example, the ability
to silence immunodominant epitopes reliably, through targeted
addition of N—glycans, should contribute to immunogen design.
N—glycan can also affect half-life and trafﬁcking of protein thera-
peutics and correct prediction of glycan occupancy would be of
utility. Thus, despite recent advancement in experimental tech-
nology to detect N—linked glycosylation (Kaji et al., 2007;
Zielinska et al., 2010), a computational algorithm that can
quickly identify glycosylation sequons with higher probabilities
of glycan occupancy should be of use.

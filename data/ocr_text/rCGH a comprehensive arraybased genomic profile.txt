ability and facilitates profiles interpretation and decision—making through sharable interactive

visualizations.

1 Introduction

Precision medicine aims at identifying individual cancer patients’ mo—
lecular alterations—such as copy number alterations (CNAs), gene
mutations or fusions and protein expressions—and matching these to
targeted therapies (Andre et 61]., 2014; Tsimberidou et 61]., 2014).
While next—generation sequencing is now widely used for identifying
mutations, array—based comparative genomic hybridization
(aCGH) is a common platform for detecting CNAs (Andre et 61].,
2013; Laurent—Puig et 61]., 2009): the advantages of aCGH over neXt—
generation sequencing technologies include lower cost, rapid turn—
around time and lower computational overhead. In the context of
precision medicine, CNA analysis—alongside somatic mutation ana—
lysis—is critical for identifying clinically actionable genomic aberra—
tions. However, significant technical challenges remain in the
processing of aCGH data. Addressing these challenges requires new
state—of—the—art tools for coordinating analysis and interpreting
results.

2 Methods and implementation

An aCGH analysis can be decomposed into four distinct phases
(Supplementary Fig. S1): (i) logz relative ratios (LRR) calculation
(the sample DNA signals against a normal 2—copy DNA reference),
(ii) profile centralization, (iii) profile segmentation and (iv) genomic
profile interpretation to identify actionable genes affected by a
CNA, to propose a matched therapeutic orientation.

The profile centralization defines a baseline—a neutral 2—copies
level—from which CNA are estimated. We previously discussed the
impact of centralization on aCGH analysis (Commo et 61]., 2015),
and rCGH implements the procedure described in the same article.
Brieﬂy, the vector of LRRs is considered as a mixture of Gaussian
populations, and their respective proportion and parameters are
estimated using an Expectation—Maximization algorithm. By default,
the sub—population with a density peak higher than 50% of the high-
est density is considered as representing a neutral 2—copy state. Its
mean is then used for centralizing the profile.

Fig. 1. Interactive visualization. The genomic profile and the loss of heterozy-
gosity profile (when available) are displayed on the CGH profile tab, while the
gene values are accessible through the Genes table tab. The command panel
(on left) can be used to display a gene of interest, to recenter the entire profile
and to specify several decision parameters (gain/loss threshold, segment
length). Gene values are updated automatically, and profiles and table can be
re-exported after modification

The segmentation step aims at identifying breakpoints in the
LRRs continuity, each delimiting potentially gained or lost DNA seg—
ments. The rCGH segmentation relies on the circular binary segmen-
tation (CBS) (Olshen et 61]., 2004), implemented in the DNAcopy R
package. Although this algorithm is widely used (Willenbrock and
Fridlyand, 2005), it suffers from several parameters to be specified a
priori. In particular, the ‘sdundo’ segmentation method mainly relies
on two parameters: (i) a significance level or for the statistical test to
accept points as breakpoints and (ii) the allowed difference between
two consecutive segment means to keep them distinct (expressed in
DNAcopy as a number of standard deviations,undo.SD). Instead of
using arbitrary values, rCGH introduces a data—driven parameteriza—
tion: given a fixed or, the corresponding optimal ‘undo.SD’ value is
estimated from the median absolute deviation, a widely used noise es—
timator (Supplementary Methods). This optimization greatly facili-
tates the use of this algorithm for routine practice and standardizes
the parameterization through a data—driven rule.

In precision medicine, the decision-making regarding a thera—
peutic orientation relies on the actionable gene’s status, defined with
respect to gain/loss thresholds and alteration lengths. Defining such
thresholds is often arbitrary: (i) there is no consensus on which LRR
values correspond to biologically relevant CNAs, (ii) focal alter-
ations, possibly referring to significantly recurrent alterations within
a cohort (Mermel et 61]., 2011; Yuan et 61]., 2012), are not clearly
defined when transposed to the interpretation of unique profiles.
rCGH provides an interactive visualization tool that allows the user
to visualize and manipulate genomic profiles from within a web
interface (Fig. 1).

Two primary perspectives are provided: visualization of CNAs
along DNA strands or a gene—centric table. The latter includes gene—
specific LRR values and corresponding segment lengths. When
available on microarrays, loss of heterozygosity expressed as the NB
allelic difference is also provided. A command window provides
control over display parameters including re-centering, merging
short segments and gain or loss thresholds (see Supplementary
Methods for a full description). Finally, both the genomic profile
and the genes table can be re—exported, in ready—to—publish quality
and xls format, respectively, including the changes applied on the
profile.

3 Supported files

As input rCGH supports Agilent Human CGH data, from 44K to
400K, and Affymetrix, SNP6 and cytoScanHD. All are provided in
text format by platform—specific softwares: standard Agilent text
files are exported from Agilent Feature Extraction software (FE),
while Affymetrix cychp.txt, cnchp.txt or probeset.txt files are ob—
tained by processing Affymetrix CEL files through ChAS or
Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) softwares: both are freely available
at http://www.affymetrix.com. Custom arrays can also be sup—
ported, provided the data format complies with the requirements
(see Supplementary Methods for details).

4 rCGH outputs

rCGH stores all the original and computed data, as well as the
workﬂow parameters, to ensure traceability. Segmentation tables
are of the same format as standard CBS outputs, completed with the
segment lengths and the within—segment LRR standard deviation.

5 Web server version

Independently of rCGH, we have developed aCGH-viewer: an inter—
active visualization available as a web application. Its implementa—
tion is freely available for installation on a server. As inputs, the
application requires segmentation tables built through either rCGH,
or any other workflow, provided the data are of the same form as
the standard CBS outputs. This application is designed for use by
clinicians and biologists and does not require bioinformatic expert—
ise. It allows individual profiles to be shared, discussed and anno—
tated in tumor board committees and finally saved for traceability
(see Supplementary Methods for details).

6 Conclusion

In this work, we present the R package rCGH: a comprehensive
aCGH analysis workﬂow, with features and functionalities particu—
larly well adapted to precision medicine. rCGH ensures the traceabil—
ity of the entire process of individual samples and provides interactive
visualization tools allowing to better interpret—and potentially repro—
cess—genomic profiles, individually. The web—server application can
assist oncologists in reviewing copy—number alterations in genomic
profiles and identifying matched therapeutic orientations.

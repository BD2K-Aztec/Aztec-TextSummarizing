Abstract

Motivation: Thanks to research spanning nearly 30 years, two major models have emerged that ac—
count for nucleosome organization in chromatin: statistical and sequence specific. The first is
based on elegant, easy to compute, closed—form mathematical formulas that make no assumptions
of the physical and chemical properties of the underlying DNA sequence. Moreover, they need no
training on the data for their computation. The latter is based on some sequence regularities but,
as opposed to the statistical model, it lacks the same type of closed—form formulas that, in this
case, should be based on the DNA sequence only.

Results: We contribute to close this important methodological gap between the two models by pro—
viding three very simple formulas for the sequence specific one. They are all based on well—known
formulas in Computer Science and Bioinformatics, and they give different quantifications of how
complex a sequence is. In view of how remarkably well they perform, it is very surprising that
measures of sequence complexity have not even been considered as candidates to close the men—
tioned gap. We provide experimental evidence that the intrinsic level of combinatorial organization
and information—theoretic content of subsequences within a genome are strongly correlated to the
level of DNA encoded nucleosome organization discovered by Kaplan et al. Our results establish
an important connection between the intrinsic complexity of subsequences in a genome and the in—
trinsic, i.e. DNA encoded, nucleosome organization of eukaryotic genomes. It is a first step towards
a mathematical characterization of this latter ‘encoding’.

art for nucleosome organization, as well as novel results, can be
found in two recent articles (Giancarlo et al., 2015; Minary and
Levitt, 2014). Among the many outstanding results, the two dis—
cussed next are, in our view, both milestones and the most relevant
in order to place the contribution given in this article in the proper
light.

Kornberg and Stryer (1988) proposed a statistical model,
referred to as the Barrier Model and recently generalized by Mobius
and Gerland (2010) that would account for nucleosome organiza—
tion in genomes. Genome—wide experiments have shown its validity
(Mavrich et al., 2008a,b). It has the great virtue of being formalized
by very elegant mathematical formulas, which can be computed
with no training on DNA sequences. Moreover, it had no predeces—
sor of its kind nor has it been the object of controversies after its
proposal.

Consequent remarkable findings by Segal et al. (2006) and
Kaplan et al. (2008) established that nucleosome organization is
DNA—encoded. The authors went also one step further and showed
that, via machine learning techniques, a computer program could
learn those sequence rules and later be used as a predictor of nucleo—
some positioning. That study had been preceded by results that
pointed to specific sequence features as being associated to nucleo—
some depletion or enrichment in genomic regions (see Giancarlo
et al., 2015 ; Minary and Levitt, 2014, for summary and relevant ref-
erences). However, it was the first study that provided an answer to
the sequence—specificity question in general terms and on a genomic
scale, as opposed to the specifics of preceding results, e.g. regular
patterns occurring in DNA or base composition.

Unfortunately, although what is meant by DNA—encoded in that
context is semantically clear, mathematically it is void of meaning
since no code was exhibited. Moreover, large scale investigations
that have tried to identify universal sequence dictated rules, a re—
quirement less stringent than a code, for nucleosome positioning
tended to exclude their existence (Valouev et al., 2008). Simple ‘in—
trinsic’ sequence rules are emerging, but they are very specific and
very few (Peckham et al., 2007; Tillo and Hughes, 2009) and there
is no evidence that they are exhaustive. On the contrary, recent re—
sults indicate that the role of k—mers involved in nucleosome enrich-
ment or depletion may be more complex than what expected
(Giancarlo et al., 2015). In summary, although the lab experiments
show the existence of such an encoding, in terms of rules and prop-
erties of the associated alphanumeric sequences not much progress
has been made. When compared with the Barrier Model, the DNA-
encoded one lacks a rigorous set of mathematical formulas, easy to
compute and requiring no training on the DNA sequences, that
could (even in part) be used to explain the mathematical nature of
that encoding. Finding such an object would be important methodo—
logically in order not to transform sequence—specific nucleosome
positioning into a potentially endless list of specific rules. Prediction
of nucleosome positions based on it, it is perceived as a minor point.

Here we address such a shortcoming by providing three formulas
with the required characteristics. They are either well known, or
variants of well known, formulas in Computer Science and
Bioinformatics. They both quantify the intrinsic complexity of a se—
quence. In particular, we consider (i) empirical entropy, which
measures information—theoretic content of a sequence (ii) two lin—
guistic complexity measures that measure the combinatorial richness
of a sequence as quantified by the number of distinct subsequences
composing it. Following the same experimental set—up as in Kaplan
et al. (2008), we find a quite elegant correspondence between funda—
mental notions in Mathematics and Computer Science and Biology:
there is indeed a relationship between the intrinsic complexity of

subsequences in a genome and the intrinsic, i.e. DNA—encoded, nu—
cleosome organization of eukaryotic genomes. This is new and
unique, as far as the role of sequence specificity in nucleosome pos—
itioning is concerned.

2 Methods

This section is dedicated to the presentation of the methods needed
to perform this research, as follows. Section 2.1 introduces the com—
plexity measures used here. For their study, Kaplan et al. (2008)
devised a methodology to test whether an algorithm could distin-
guish nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs, for short) from nucleo-
some enriched ones (NER). It is outlined in Section 2.2. Section 2.3
is dedicated to the description of a general method that allows con—
structing nucleosome occupancy maps, via a generic algorithm as
the one described in Section 2.2. Finally, Section 2.4 describes a pro—
cedure to assess the level of agreement between two nucleosome oc—
cupancy maps.

2.1 Sequence complexity measures

The complexity of a sequence can be formally defined by resorting
to techniques and ideas coming from the following related areas: se—
quence combinatorics and linguistic complexity (De Luca and
Varricchio, 1999; Trifonov, 1990), Shannon information theory
(Cover and Thomas, 1991), and Kolmogorov-Chaitin algorithmic
complexity (Li and Vitanyi, 1997). In terms of actual numeric evalu—
ations, measures stemming from this latter area are not computable
and can only be heuristically approximated via data compression
programs (see Giancarlo et al., 2009, 2012). However, the corres—
ponding heuristics offer no performance guarantee on how good the
corresponding approximations are. Therefore, for the experiments
in this article, only measures obtained from the first two mentioned
areas are used.

2. 1 . 1 Combinatorial and linguistic

Let 2 be a finite alphabet of symbols. Given a sequence x of length
11, defined over the alphabet Z, and an integer ign, let LCS(i) be the
number of distinct subsequences of length i that are present in x,
normalized by 11. Now, fix an integer 13371 and let:

LC(/e) = :1 LCS(z’).

A few remarks are in order. LC is a normalization of a measure due
to De Luca and Varricchio (1999) and it is related to the linguistic
sequence complexity introduced by Trifonov (1990). Both LC and
LCS measure the complexity of a sequence based on how many dis—
tinct subsequences are present in it. The lower that number, the less
complex the sequence is. In order to illustrate this point, we provide
an example for LCS(3). Consider two sequences x=AAAAAAAT
and y: TTTTAAAA. We have that LCS(3) : é : 0.25 for x since
AAA and AAT are the only distinct 3—mers that occur in it. LCS(3)
: g = 0.5 for 3), since TTT, TTA, TAA and AAA are the only distinct
3-mers in it. The first sequence is less complex than the second.

2. 1 .2 Information theoretic
The empirical entropy H0 of a sequence x is defined as follows:
IEI n1 711'
How = — ,2, glogz ;a
where n,- is the number of occurrences of symbol a,- in x. It is worthy
of mention that there is an important difference between empirical

Combinatorial and theoretic content of a sequence are correlated to the DNA encoded nucleosome organization 837

 

entropy and the entropy defined in a probabilistic setting (Cover
and Thomas, 1991). Indeed, as detailed in (Ferragina et al., 2005),
Shannon entropy is an expected value taken on a probabilistic process
that may emit a possibly infinite ensemble of sequences, while empirical
entropy is defined point—wise for any sequence: it measures the amount
of information needed to optimally encode it, without any reference to
‘a probabilistic model’ generating sequences. That is, it is a punctual
and intrinsic measure of information characterizing a sequence alone,
rather than a measure of uncertainty characterizing a model generating
sequences. As in the domain investigated here no obvious generative
model is available, a punctual measure of information content seems to
be best suited for the experiments performed here. Clearly, the lower
the value of H0 (x), the less complex x is, all other things being equal.
In order to exemplify this, consider again x=AAAAAAAT and
y: TTTTAAAA. H0(x) : 0.535 and H0(y) : 1. Again, x is less
complex than 3).

It is also well known that entropy estimation, in particular for
DNA sequences, is a very rich area of investigation. The interested
reader may find relevant methodologies in (Giancarlo et al., 2009,
2012, 2014). Therefore, it is quite natural to ask whether known
techniques would bring better results with respect to the very simple
empirical entropy used here, in particular when one resorts to com—
pressive estimates of entropy. That is, estimation via the use of data
compression programs. During the preliminary stages of this study,
this possibility has been considered. In particular, experiments (re—
ceiver operating curve (ROC) analysis, described in Section 3.3)
have been performed with the use of higher order empirical entro-
pies and two data compressors: XM (Cao et al., 2007) and
Arithmetic Coding (Witten et al., 1987). The first data compressor
is among the best for DNA sequences. The second is quite effective
and also offer the advantage to have specific parameters that control
how fast the compressor learns statistics about the sequence to be
compressed. Although the results of the experiments were good
(data not shown and available upon request), they were no better
than the ones obtained with the use of H0. Therefore, the full set of
experiments was done with the use of this measure only, which has
also the advantage of being simple and fast to compute.

2.2 An in silico method to distinguish between
nucleosome enriched and depleted genomic regions
Assume one is given two sets of genomic sequences coming from the
same genome. The first is composed of NDR, while the second of
NER. Moreover, assume one is also given an algorithm A that takes
as input a sequence x and assigns a score to x. Intuitively, such a
score is an assessment of how likely it is for x to be a NER or a
NDR. In order to test whether A can distinguish NDR from NER,
one can proceed as follows. All sequences in NDR are assigned a
class label of zero and all sequences in NER are assigned a class label
of one. We anticipate that, in terms of complexity measures, the
meaning of such an assignment is that one expects NDR regions to
be much less complex than NER ones. Then, one uses A to assign a
score to each sequence in NER U NDR. Now, the well known ROC
analysis (Hanley and McNeil, 1982) can be used to establish how
well A distinguishes NDR from NER, based on the produced scores.
Indeed, the resulting Area Under the Curve (AUC) takes values in [0,
1] with the following meaning: (i) a value below 0.5 indicates that in
order to get a correct classification one needs to invert the class
labels; (ii) the further away the AUC is from 0.5, a value indicating
random classification, and close to one, a value indicating a perfect
classification, the better the ability of A to distinguish NDR from
NER.

Such a mode of operation is referred to as full scores, since each
sequence x E NER U NDR is assigned a score obtained by process—
ing the entire sequence. It results convenient to define also a score
that is normalized with respect to the sequence length. This mode of
operation is referred to as normalized scores and it is described next.
Assume that x has length at least 147 bp. A sliding window of
147bp sweeps x from left to right, and a score, as computed by A
with input the subsequence ‘in the window’, is assigned to the left—
most position of x covered by the window. Therefore, one obtains n
— 147 values. In order to assign a score to x, one needs to choose a
representative value based on the n — 147 available ones. Natural
candidates are: the average, the minimum and the median of the
given set of values. It is well known that the median of a set of values
is a statistically robust synoptic value for the entire set and, in fact,
having conducted experiments with all three of them, the median
yields the best results. When n < 147, one computes its score via A
as a whole and that score is assigned to it. The choice of a window
of length 147 is related to the typical sequence length forming a nu—
cleosome core.

2.3 In silico construction of nucleosome occupancy
maps

Intuitively, a nucleosome occupancy map, for a given genome, pro—
vides a value that can be seen as an in silico, in vitro or in vivo esti—
mate of the ‘probability’ that a given genomic position is covered by
a nucleosome, i.e. an occupancy value. For the convenience of the
reader, we point out that a nucleosome positioning map is much
more specific than a corresponding occupancy map, since it provides
an estimate of how likely it is for a given genomic position to be the
initial position (or, in alternative, the center) of a nucleosome.
Methodologically, those terms are made precise by Kaplan et al.
(2010), although pragmatically for nucleosome occupancy maps one
resorts to estimates based on the experimental data rather exact
probability distributions. When no ambiguity arises, we refer to a
nucleosome occupancy map simply as a map. Obviously, the same
genome can have different maps, depending on which occupancy
value estimation method is used. Here we concentrate on how to ob—
tain a map with the use of the generic algorithm A described in
Section 2.2. Assume that the genome of which the map has to be
built is divided into maximal regions of contiguous bases
R = {[51, e1], [52, e2], . . . , (sq, eq]}, where the interval endpoints nat—
urally indicate the start and end genome coordinate of each region,
respectively. Each region in R is swept, from left to right, by a win-
dow of length 147. The corresponding sequence is given in input to
A and the value returned in output is assigned to the genomic pos—
ition aligned with the center of the window, e.g. when [51,e1] is
swept, the result is a map for the genomic positions in
[$1 + 73,61 — 73].

2.4 Statistics on the level of agreement between two
maps via binning

Because maps can be seen as numeric vectors, the degree of agree—
ment between two different maps of the same organism can be as—
sessed by computing standard correlation coefficients. However,
care must be exercised. Indeed, since the comparison is made on a
genome—wide scale, it implies estimating the correlation of a very
large number of points. In those circumstances, some correlation
measures, e.g. Pearson coefficient, may suffer from what is known
as “the most influential point effect”. That is, relatively few points
may be responsible for a good correlation. Such a potential problem
has been specifically mentioned by Stein et al. (2010) as a criticism

9mg ‘09 1sn3nv uo soroﬁuv soq ‘ETUJOJHBQ aIo AliSJQATUn 112 /§.IO'S[BU.IHO[p.IOJXO'SODBIHJOJUTOTQ/ﬁdllq 11101; popeorumoq

to the way in which Kaplan et al. (2008) assessed the correlation be—
tween maps in their study. The approach described below accounts
for this criticism.

Let R1, R2,  ,Rk be a collection of maps, given in the format
of sets of intervals, of the same genome. Each of them can be ob—
tained either via the methods described in Section 2.3 or by other
techniques, even in vivo and in vitro. Assume that we are interested
in establishing the level of relatedness between each pair of maps. In
that case, all of them must refer to the same set of genomic positions,
i.e. genomic areas covered by one map but not present or with an
undefined occupancy value in another must be eliminated.
Intuitively, one needs a simple ‘superimposition’ of all maps, from
which a projection is taken of the genomic coordinates having a
value assigned to them in all maps. From such a projection, deriving
the set of intervals common to all maps is straightforward and left
to the reader.

Now, the level of agreement between R, and Rj is established ac—
cording to the following heuristic procedure in which, intuitively,
each interval is divided in small pieces for comparison. The length
of the pieces should be such that the correlation between two pieces
must be statistically significant, avoid the most influential point ef-
fect and guarantee that the maps are not divided into too many
pieces, resulting in a slowdown of the computational process asso—
ciated to the comparison of maps. In this study, given the data
being used, a length of 1000 seems reasonable. However, we
choose 1029, i.e. the smallest integer greater that 1000 and divisible
by 147, since that would allow to have an ‘integral’ number of nu-
cleosome centers in each piece. More formally, each interval [5, e]
obtained as outlined above is processed with the use of a sliding
window of size 1029. It sweeps the interval from left to right. The
correlation between portions of the maps R, and Rj in the window
is computed and assigned to the corresponding genomic region.
Once that each interval has been processed, the following binning
procedure is used, in order to get a synoptic rendering of the correl-
ation of the entire two maps, assuming that the correlation has
been computed with a method that returns a value in [—1, 1]. That
interval is partitioned into subintervals, referred to as bins, and
each genomic region is assigned to the bin comprising the correl-
ation value computed for that region. If the bins are picked in such
a way to represent qualitatively increasing levels of correlation, i.e.
bad, poor, fair, good, very good, excellent, the end result of this
procedure is the production of accurate statistics of how many rela—
tively short genomic regions fall into the qualitative levels of correl—
ation represented by the bins.

3 Results and discussion

Kaplan et al. (2008) intended to establish to what extent the DNA
sequence determines nucleosome positions in eukaryotes. Towards
that end, the main part of their strategy was to show that an in vitro
nucleosome occupancy map was correlated with an in vivo one.
Here we want to establish that the DNA sequence, considered as a
combinatorial object, has enough information about nucleosome oc—
cupancy in the corresponding genome. Therefore, our strategy is as
in (Kaplan et al., 2008), with the use of the complexity formulas pre—
sented in Section 2.1 that have the role of quantifying the sequence
information. In particular the same maps are used, with the addition
of two (see Section 3.1). Two computational experiments, nearly
verbatim replicas of the ones described in the mentioned article, are
performed: correlation analysis between the map of an organism
and the corresponding one obtained by computational methods (see

Section 3.2) and ROC analysis to assess how well NERs and NDRs
can be classified by a computational method (see Section 3.3).

3.1 Maps

Five nucleosome occupancy maps are used in this study, the first
three common to the study by Kaplan et al. (2008). Namely, the
normalized in vitro and in vivo Saccbaromyces cerez/isiae maps, the
adjusted occupancy Caenorloabditis elegans map by Valouev et al.
(2008) (chromosome 2), and the Drosoploila melanogaster maps by
Mavrich et al. (2008a) (only chromosome 2). In particular, from
this latter map, two have been extracted, one for the left and the se—
cond for the right arm of the chromosome. Individually, they are
referred to as SCvitro, SCvivo, CE, DM—2L and DM—2R, respect-
ively. Additional details regarding them are given in Supplementary
Section S1. The inclusion of a map for D.1nelanogaster is justified by
our interest in checking our hypothesis on a eukaryotic organism
more complex than S.cerez/isiae and C.elegans. It is also worth
pointing out that DM—2R and DM—2L are much more challenging
maps for this study than the ones being used here for the other two
organisms. Indeed, as opposed to them, where each genomic pos—
ition is given an estimate of the chance of that position being cov—
ered by a nucleosome, whereas DM— 2R and DM— 2L are binary maps.
That is, each genomic position is assigned a value of one, when that
position is covered by a nucleosome, or zero, when it is not.

3.2 Correlation between complexity—based maps and
the corresponding experimental ones of S.cerevisiae
and C.elegans

We carry out a set of correlation experiments between maps, via the
approach outlined in Section 2.4, and with the use of the Spearman
rank correlation coefficient. Such a choice is motivated by the fact
that it provides a statistically robust non—parametric estimate of cor—
relation, which is largely immune to the presence of outliers. For
completeness, we also carry out the same experiment with the use of
the Pearson correlation coefficient. As for the measures to be tested,
we use H0, LCS(le), at la : 7, and LC(le), at la : 17, (those are the val—
ues of la that maximise the AUC value of the corresponding measure
in the ROC analysis—see Section 3.3). Moreover, we also use the
probabilistic model devised by (Kaplan et al., 2008), here referred to
as KModel. As opposed to the measures proposed here, that con—
sider a sliding window of 147bp, KModel is allowed to use the en—
tire genome as input for its prediction. Finally, we exclude both DM—
2L and DM—2R because their binary form does not lend itself to
meaningful correlation studies, based on monotonicity or linear re—
lations between numeric vectors.

The results are reported in Tables 1—3 for the Spearman rank
correlation coefficient. The analogous results for the Pearson correl—
ation coefficient are reported in Supplementary Tables S2—S4. As for
the statistical significance of those correlations (both Spearman and
Pearson), since we are in a case of repeated tests of hypothesis, we
have computed a p—value with a standard Bonferroni correction for
the cumulative number of tests performed in the interval [0.3, 1.0].
The remaining intervals are somewhat irrelevant. The significance
level is below 0.80264 x 10—19.

In order to fully highlight the implications of those results, the
discussion of an example is helpful. From the Spearman rank correl-
ation in the interval [0.6, 0.9) between H0 and SCvivo, we have
randomly selected one of the genomic regions of 1029 bp falling into
it. For that region, Figure 1 displays the plots of the occupancy val—
ues of SCvivo and SCvitro. As for the computational methods, it
displays the plots obtained by applying them to that region,

according to the methodology already discussed. We take as refer—
ence the in vivo curve (top of the Figure). As it is evident, the corres—
ponding curve of the in vitro map closely follows the in vivo one. An
analogous observation can be made regarding the curves generated
by the computational procedures. The example seems to suggest
that, given in input a sequence, the output of the mathematical for—
mulas and the computational procedure are able to generate curves
for that sequence that are in agreement with the corresponding ones
obtained from in vivo and in vitro maps. Tables 1——3 here and
Supplementary Tables S2—S4 quantify to what extend such an agree—
ment hold for the maps involved in this study.

With the previous example in mind, an immediate conclusion
that can be drawn from those results is that the good correlation be—
tween SCvivo and SCvitro established by Kaplan et al. (2008) is
also found here, with a method and a correlation coefficient that
does not suffer from the most inﬂuential point effect. The compari-
son between KModel and the formulas proposed here has important
methodological implications, discussed next, regarding the nature of
those formulas and what can be learned from a sequence about its
nucleosome occupancy.

KModel has been trained on SCvitro. Therefore, it is not sur—
prising that it performs better than the methods proposed here on
that particular map and on the strongly related one SCvivo.
However, for CE, such an advantage for KModel disappears and its
performance is in line with that of the measures proposed here.
Those observations seem to suggest that those formulas have a
‘foundational nature’ in quantifying nucleosome occupancy from se—
quence, providing some sort of ‘baseline’ common to at least two or—
ganisms. Machine Learning procedures can certainly profitably
extract relevant features when trained on a specific genome.

However, such training may not always be possible, and in those
cases, they may not do much better than the ‘baseline’ procedures
proposed here. That is, training on one genome in the hope to per—
form well on another does not seem to be so easy, in view of the re—
sults of this Section.

Although numerically different, the experiments with the
Pearson correlation coefficient, reported in the Supplementary
Material, also support the above analysis.

3.3 ROC curve analysis
For conciseness, it results convenient to describe in detail first the
ROC curve analysis for one map only: SCvivo.

For each of the thresholds t = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, the corres—
ponding NER, and NDR, are extracted according to the method
described in Supplementary Section S2. With reference to the pro—
cedure outlined in Section 2.2, NER, U NDR, is processed in full
and normalized score modes of operation, respectively, with
A 2 H0; A : LCS(le), la in [2, 36]; A : LC(le), la in [2, 36], respect—
ively. For the normalized score mode of operation, only the results
obtained by using the median to assign a score to the sequences in
NER, U NDR, are reported (see Section 2.2 again). As for the min-
imum and the average, we limit ourselves to mention that they also
ensure a good classification (data not shown and available upon re—
quest), however inferior with respect to the median.

The same experiments have been performed for all of the other
maps mentioned in Section 3.1. No thresholding has been applied
for DJnelanogaster since it is meaningless for that map. The com—
plete results are reported in Table 4 for H0. As for LC and LCS,
Figure 2 provides the relevant AUC plots, as a function of la, but for
the case of threshold zero. The corresponding plots for all the
thresholds are reported in Supplementary Figures S1—S3. For LCS,
Table 5 provides the value of both the maximum AUC and of the la
for which it is achieved in the mentioned plots. The corresponding
data for LC is reported in Supplementary Table S1. In all Tables, the
analogous results from the study by Kaplan et al. (2008) are also re—
ported for comparison.

As it is evident, all three complexity measures distinguish quite
well NER from NDR for all three organisms studied here. It is also
to be appreciated that the AUC values go up in accordance with the

The legend for the ﬁrst column of the table is as in Table 1. The remaining columns correspond to the four thresholds. The AUC value obtained Via ROC ana-

lysis corresponding to an experiment is reported as a numeric value in the entry summarizing the experiment. For the ﬁrst ﬁve rows, the value refers to the AUC of

that experiment in normalized scores mode, while that in full scores mode is provided in parenthesis. For comparison, the last three rows report the results of the

threshold value. That is, as NER and NDR become more and more
representative, the complexity measures distinguish them better and
better. Moreover, the AUC values obtained with the use of the com—
plexity measures are competitive with respect to the computational
model designed by Kaplan et al. (2008), given the simplicity of those
measures and the total absence of a learning phase on a training set
of sequences. Indeed, the results obtained here confirm, from a dif-
ferent point of view, what has been stated at the end of Section 3.2.
In terms of structural organization of sequence features for nu—
cleosome positioning, we also get brand new insights. When one
considers the ROC analysis curves for LC and LCS, it is evident that
the le—mers organization of the underlying sequences follows the
same trend in favoring/disfavoring nucleosome positioning.
Moreover, the ROC analysis together with the correlation analysis
bring to light that the DNA—encoded organization of eukaryotic gen—
omes is much easier to grasp in S.cerevisiae than in C.elegans. Such
an ‘encoding’ is present in DJnelanogaster but it either has a much
less prominent role with respect to the other two, much simpler, or—
ganisms, or it is more complex to describe by a closed form formula.
Quite remarkably, at least for S.cerevisiae and C.elegans, those re—
sults are in agreement with a recent information—theoretic study by

Giancarlo et al. (2015). Using the same data as here, the study
showed that NER in the mentioned organisms have minor differ-
ences in their information—theoretic content, yet those differences
are statistically very significant. The same holds for NDR. It is also
of interest to note that the best AUC values of the various methods
on the various organisms decrease in accordance with the genetic
density of the latter, supporting the fact that more complex organ—
isms may hide more complex mathematical rules with respect to the
ones proposed here.

3.4 Time performance of our methods

Although not the major objective of this research, the simplicity of
the formulas proposed here has also the remarkable side effect to
provide efficient procedures for the computation of nucleosome
density maps. The algorithmic engineering details, as well as the full
results of an experiment conducted on CE, are reported in
Supplementary Section S3. Here we limit ourselves to report that the
timing for H0, LCS(7) and LC(17) (the values of la for which those
measures perform best), executed in normalized scores mode, are

0.490 x 102, 0.239 X 103 and 0.108 X 104 seconds, respectively.

The ﬁrst column in the table indicates the experiment whose result is reported, in the form (map, predictor). The predictor, i.e. the method used to assign scores
to NER and NDR is either SCvitro or KModel or LC. The remaining columns correspond to the four thresholds. The AUC value obtained Via ROC analysis cor-
responding to an experiment is reported as a numeric value in the entry summarizing the experiment, in the form (AUC, lemax), together with a value of la where it

is maximum. For the ﬁrst three rows, the reported values refer to the experiment in normalized scores mode, while those in full scores mode are provided in paren-

thesis. For comparison, the last three rows report the results of the experiments conducted in Kaplan et al. (2008) (full scores mode only).

For comparison, KModel takes 0.289 X 104 seconds. Therefore, the
measures proposed here are, in their best predictive setting, always
faster than KModel and the best performing one by two orders of
magnitude. It is worth pointing out that in full score mode, the per—
formances of our measures are 0.384 X 10, 0.188 X 102 and
0.650 X 102 seconds, respectively. However, a comparison between
the performance of our measures in that setting and KModel is in—
appropriate because our methods produce a single value for each in—
put sequence while KModel produces a value for each position in an
input sequence.

4 Conclusions

When the findings of Sections 3.2 and 3.3 are placed in the context
of the current state of the art on the identification of what plays a
role in determining nucleosome organization in eukaryotes, we have
the following fundamental advances.

We provide a set of formulas that have the same nice properties
of the ones available for the Barrier Model (Kornberg and Stryer,
1988; Mobius and Gerland, 2010) and that apply to the sequence—
specific model of nucleosome positioning. It is worth recalling that,
prior to this work, the sequence—specific model was populated by a
few sequence rules and Machine Learning procedures and that the
existence of universal sequence dictated rules for nucleosome pos—
itioning was even dismissed (Valouev et al., 2008). The fact that the
formulas, proposed here, are well known in the Literature, and have
not been previously considered in this context, adds value to our
contribution.

The intent of the study by Kaplan et al. (2008) was to show that
the sequence itself has enough ‘information’ to inﬂuence nucleosome
positioning and that such a genomic organization is ‘DNA encoded’
in eukaryotes. The term ‘information’ in that setting has to do with
Biology and the term ‘encoding’ is semantically clear. Our results es—
tablish that the purely information theoretic content and combina—
torial richness of subsequences within a sequence, i.e. two measures

of information and complexity in Computer Science, are both corre—
lated to the biological information alluded to by Kaplan et al.
(2008). Moreover, our formulas are the first that provide an inter-
pretation of the mathematical nature of the ‘encoding’ discovered by
the mentioned authors.

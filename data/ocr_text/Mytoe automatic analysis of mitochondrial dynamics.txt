ABSTRACT

Summary: We present Mytoe, a tool for analyzing mitochondrial
morphology and dynamics from fluorescence microscope images.
The tool provides automated quantitative analysis of mitochondrial
motion by optical flow estimation and of morphology by
segmentation of individual branches of the network-like structure
of the organelles. Mytoe quantifies several features of individual
branches, such as length, tortuosity and speed, and of the
macroscopic structure, such as mitochondrial area and degree of
clustering. We validate the methods and apply them to the analysis of
sequences of images of U208 human cells with fluorescently labeled
mitochondria.

1 INTRODUCTION

Mitochondria play a key role in several cellular processes, from
energy production to apoptosis and ageing. Malfunctioning in
mitochondrial processes has been associated to several diseases
(Westermann, 2010). Due to mitochondrial fusion and ﬁssion,
the organelles form a highly dynamic structure that can change
from fragmented to ﬁlamentous (Koopman et al., 2005). A better
understanding of the dynamics of this structure and its relationship
with complex cellular processes may provide much insight on
mitochondrial functioning and their role on the well—being of cells.

Recent works addressed the problem of segmenting mitochondria
from ﬂuorescence microscope images. (Koopman et al., 2005)
presented a segmentation method along with descriptors for
mitochondrial properties. Another method uses 3D imaging (Song
et al., 2008). Mitochondrial motility has been assessed by the
degree of colocalization between successive images and from the
differences of subsequent image pairs (Koopman et al., 2005;
Yi et al., 2004). These methods detect motion but do not yield
data on directionality. Other methods to study motility include
optical ﬂow (OF) estimation (Gerencser et al., 2008) and distance
transform (Beraud et al., 2009). Tracking methods for motility
analysis exist, but rely heavily on human interaction (Saunter et al.,
2009; Silberberg et al., 2008).

We present an easy—to—use software, Mytoe, for automated
study of mitochondrial structural dynamics from temporal confocal
images. It has a simple graphical user interface and requires only a
few parameters from the user. Mytoe includes a novel segmentation
method which identiﬁes individual branches of the organelles’
structure by thresholding and by morphological image processing.
In contrast to previous methods, this allows quantifying properties
of both single branches and the macroscopic structure formed by
the mitochondria. OF is used for motion analysis. The output can
be examined in Mytoe with branch—level data being visualized by
color—coding individual branches based on the data, and motion
vectors being visualized as quiver plots. The results are saved as
MATLAB MAT—ﬁles and comma—separated values. We ﬁrst describe
the methods in Mytoe and results of the validation procedure.
Finally, we use Mytoe to analyze time—lapse sequences of U208
human osteosarcoma cells.

2 METHODS, APPLICABILITY AND VALIDATION

Mytoe segments the nucleus and cell membrane from ﬂuorescence
microscope images. The outlines can be manually drawn if the automatic
segmentation is unsatisfactory. The mitochondria are segmented in two
steps. The ﬁrst is similar to the method of (Koopman et al., 2005) but uses
morphological top—hat (TH) (Soille, 2003) instead of linear ﬁltering. Each
image of mitochondria is ﬁrst denoised with a median ﬁlter, followed by TH,
which enhances the separation of mitochondria from the background. The
result is median ﬁltered to remove noise enhanced by the TH. Finally, the
denoised image is contrast stretched and binarized by Otsu’s method (Otsu,
1979) to produce a mask. The next step, developed here for our aims, extracts
individual branches of the network by applying to the mask a two—iteration
thinning procedure (Guo et al., 1989) and locating the branch points of the
resulting skeleton.

Motion is analyzed by OF estimation, using a pyramidal implementation
(Bouguet, 2000) of the method proposed in (Lucas et al., 1981). OF yields the
displacements of objects between each pair of subsequent frames in a movie,
enabling the calculation of velocities. Results using this method are provided
in the Supplementary Material. If desired, motion can also be analyzed by
measuring the colocalization of mitochondria between successive images as
proposed in (Koopman et al., 2005).

Mytoe extracts various statistics. From individual branches it computes
properties such as thickness, length and orientation. From the OF, the
average speed and the average direction of each branch are calculated. In
addition, it extracts cell—level quantities such as number of branches and total
mitochondrial area. The list of extracted quantities is shown in Table l. The
methods of computation of each feature and their practical implementation
are described in Supplementary Material.

We apply Mytoe to confocal images of U208 cells. Cells were transfected
with a vector expressing mitoDsRED2, an red ﬂuorescent protein targeting
the mitochondrial matrix. The nuclei and cell membranes are visualized by

Hoechst 33342 and WGA647 ﬂuorescent dyes, respectively. The images
were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse Ti with 100x Apo, a Wallac—Perkin
Elmer Ultraview spinning—disk confocal system, Andor EMCCD camera and
an autofocus system. Each cell was imaged every 3 s for 10 min in 2D. An
example image is shown in Figure 1a. In Figures 1b and lo, we show a
region of the same image, and the structure segmented from that region,
respectively.

The quality of microscope imaging is degraded by noise and saturation,
thus we added noise and increasingly saturated the images (Supplementary
Material). We applied Mytoe and observed how the features changed with
increasing levels of degradation. Visual inspection showed that the methods
are robust to levels of degradation much higher than in real images. In
Supplementary Material we present the results of the analysis of structure
and motion and of the features in Table 1 for a set of images. As an example,
Figure 1d shows time series of mean branch speeds of mitochondria of four
cells, revealing that they differ widely, likely due to differing cell cycle stage.

3 DISCUSSION

Mytoe provides an easy means to study mitochondrial structure
and kinetics by automated image analysis of temporal images of
ﬂuorescently labeled mitochondria. The structure analysis was found
robust to noise and insensitive to saturation. Thus, the method can

be used to obtain reliable measurements from saturated images,
provided that the mitochondrial branches are separable.

So far, we tested Mytoe on one cell type. Its efﬁciency may depend
on the shapes of cell type and mitochondria. Here we showed that
it is accurate enough to, for example, distinguish the kinetics of the
mitochondria structure from one cell to another.

In the future, this framework can be extended by including
additional descriptors and adding other shape analysis techniques
that can be chosen as a function of the cell type. Additionally, we aim
to further develop Mytoe so as to automatically detect abnormalities
in the mitochondria structure, due to chemicals (such as in drug
screening) or disease.

ABSTRACT

Summary: PriSM is a set of algorithms designed to select and match
degenerate primer pairs for the amplification of viral genomes. The
design of panels of hundreds of primer pairs takes just hours using
this program, compared with days using a manual approach. PriSM
allows for rapid in silico optimization of primers for downstream
applications such as sequencing. As a validation, PriSM was used
to create an amplification primer panel for human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) Clade B.

1 INTRODUCTION

Viral populations are dynamic and the strains circulating in an
infected population often vary geographically and temporally. RNA
Viruses, especially those that cause chronic disease such as hepatitis
C Virus (HCV) and human immunodeﬁciency Virus (HIV), exhibit
tremendous sequence diversity (Brumme et al., 2008; Martell
et al., 1992). As such, primers designed from a single reference
genome may limit the number of variants captured from within a
single patient as well as variants isolated from different geographic
regions and time periods. Here, we report on a novel primer design
method that: (i) leverages existing genome sequence information to
design degenerate primers that account for the signiﬁcant diversity
observed in Viral populations, and (ii) maximizes the ability to
successfully amplify and sequence the genomes of Viruses from
different individuals that may differ signiﬁcantly from a single Viral
reference genome.

Previous primer selection algorithms have been designed to
amplify single target regions (Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000), or
optimized for SNP or gene-speciﬁc PCR (Tsai et al., 2007), group-
speciﬁc PCR (J arman, 2004), or for phylogenetically related DNA
sequences (Fredslund et al., 2005). These methods do not, however,
permit push button, full-genome length, primer pair design from
very diverse organisms such as those represented by RNA Viruses.

A comparison of the features of PriSM to those of several other
primer design programs is included in Supplementary Table 1.

PriSM takes advantage of existing sequence information for a
given Viral strain to select the optimal primers, based on user-deﬁned
criteria. The algorithm then suggests pairs of primers to make up a
panel that will generate amplicons of desired length and overlap.
Diversity capture is increased through the use of degenerate base
codes.

2 METHODS

The user interface allows for customization of the primer and amplicon
selection parameters. Once the parameters are designated, the user can
choose to upload either: (i) a multiple alignment of full-length genome
sequences for the Viral species of interest, created using MUSCLE (www
.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/muscle/) or CLUSTALW (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/
clustalw2l), and the multiFASTA used to create the alignment, or
(ii) a multiFASTA ﬁle containing all the genomes used to create the multiple
alignment ﬁle. In the latter case, the alignment is automatically created
using CLUSTALW, with default settings. Finally, the user inputs an email
address to which the output ﬁles will be sent. The process through which
PriSM selects and matches primers has three major steps: make consensus,
primer design and amplicon selection (see Supplementary Material, Fig. 1,
for a detailed workﬂow).

Make consensus: PriSM ﬁrst identiﬁes the start and end positions of the
alignment in the multiple alignment ﬁle. It then calculates the frequency
of each base at each position of the alignment. Additional information
pertaining to the handling of the end regions of the alignment, positions
with missing bases and the ﬁles that are generated at each step can be found
in the Supplementary Material. Primer design: starting with the majority
consensus, primer candidates are chosen through the iterative evaluation
of subsequence windows. Each subsequence window is a primer candidate
that then is assessed for validity (see Supplementary Material for the full
list of criteria used to select valid primers including Tm calculation and
self-complementarity assessment). Amplicon selection: valid primers exist in
two sets—Forward primers and Reverse primers. Starting with the Forward
primer that begins at the most 5’ position of the genome each member of
the set of Reverse primers is interrogated to ﬁnd a partner that has less than
a user-deﬁned amount of complimentary sequence (default is 15 bases) and
produces a product that is larger than the minimum amplicon length (default
500 bases) and smaller than the maximum amplicon length (default 900
bases). Once successfully paired with a Forward primer, a given Reverse
primer is excluded from further pairing. Primer pairs are examined to
evaluate the overlap between adjacent amplicons. Pairs that overlap by less
than the user-deﬁned threshold are removed (default 100 bases). Finally, pairs
are ranked according to the combined conservation score of both members.
A description of the ﬁles sent to the user is included in Supplementary
Material.

PriSM

 

3 RESULTS

We have used PriSM to design successful primers suitable for the
full- genome sequencing of Dengue Virus (DENV), West Nile Virus
(WNV), HIV, HCV and Lassa Virus (data not shown). All of these
Viruses exist natively as single-stranded RNA genomes with genome
lengths in the 9—11 kb range. Here, we report on performance results
from HIV Clade B as this demonstrates the stability of PriSM even
when Viral strain diversity is high.

We downloaded 86 full- genome sequences for HIV Clade B from
the Los Alamos HIV Database (www.hiV.lanl.g0V/) and a multiple
alignment was created using the MUSCLE algorithm with standard
settings. Using default settings of PriSM, 1051 Forward primers
and 1047 Reverse primers were deemed to be valid. From these,
352 amplicons between 500 and 900 bp were identiﬁed. To meet our
coverage target and ﬁt on our plate-based PCR format, a total of 96 of
these were chosen to amplify the HIV genome (See Supplementary
Material for a list of the primer pairs). The computational part of
the process took 2 h 45 min between job submission and receipt of
an email with the ﬁnal results.

In order to test the robustness of the PriSM-designed primers,
HIV RNA was extracted from 10 chronically infected patients
and converted to cDNA as previously described (Brumme et al.,
2008). A single large amplicon spanning nucleotides 623—9639 of
the HIV genome was generated from each cDNA and nested PCR
reactions were set up using the PriSM-designed panel. Eight out
of ten samples had ampliﬁcation success rates (as calculated by
number of successful products out of 82 possible) of >90%, with
another sample yielding >85 % positive bands. Only one sample had
three or more overlapping products fail (see Supplementary Material
for more details). These results compare very favorably with our
observed HIV PCR performance historically (data not shown).

4 CONCLUSIONS

PriSM is the ﬁrst program that we are aware of that is speciﬁcally
designed to create a panel of primer pairs that tile along the entire
length of a Viral genome. PriSM leverages a posteriori information
from Viral sequence databases to build ampliﬁcation primer pairs in

a fraction of the time it would take an individual to do so manually.
PriSM is a highly ﬂexible algorithm that requires only FASTA ﬁles
or alignments as inputs, making it easy to incorporate new data as
they become available.

Our experience using this program on HIV as well as several
other Viruses indicates that PriSM is a useful, timesaVing tool for
researchers who wish to amplify full-length Viral genomes.

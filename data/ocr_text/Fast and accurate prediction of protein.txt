ABSTRACT

Summary: We developed a fast and accurate side-chain modeling
program [Optimized Side Chain Atomic eneng (OSCAR)-star] based
on orientation-dependent energy functions and a rigid rotamer
model. The average computing time was 18s per protein for 218
test proteins with higher prediction accuracy (1.1% increase for
x1 and 0.8% increase for x1+2) than the best performing program
developed by other groups. We show that the energy functions,
which were calibrated to tolerate the discrete errors of rigid rotamers,
are appropriate for protein loop selection, especially for decoys
without extensive structural refinement.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the past two decades, much effort has been spent improving the
accuracy or speed of side-chain modeling methods. Most methods
exploit a limited number of representative conformations, called
rotamers, at each residue position and use efﬁcient search algorithms
to ﬁnd a low-energy rotamer combination for the whole protein. In
spite of their efﬁciency, rigid rotamers are inherently accompanied
by a discrete error and not suited for physics-based force ﬁelds,
which are sensitive to small atomic clashes: the calculated energies
can be quite different for the native conformation and near-native
rotamers. Force ﬁelds thus have to be modiﬁed, by either scaling the
atomic radii (Dahiyat and Mayo, 1997), or using softer Lennard—
J ones repulsive terms (Yanover et al., 2008) to reduce the inﬂuence
of the steric clashes. Alternatively, knowledge-based, coarse— grained
energy functions have been developed that can tolerate rigid
rotamers while achieving high accuracy (Liang and Grishin, 2002).
A third approach is to use extremely detailed rotamer libraries,
or ﬂexible rotamer models, in combination with accurate energy
functions at the cost of speed (Peterson et al., 2004).

Recently, we developed a side-chain modeling program
combining accurate, orientation-dependent, Optimized Side Chain
Atomic eneng (OSCAR-o) with a ﬂexible rotamer model (Liang
et al., 2011a). The prediction accuracy was signiﬁcantly higher

(2.2% for X1 and 4.0% for X1+2) than that of the next-best method,
but the run time was as long as 28 min for a single protein. In this
study, we adopted OSCAR to a rigid rotamer model by modifying
the distance-dependent component for fast side-chain modeling. The
parameters of the orientation-dependent functions were optimized
so that decoy proteins with low RMSD (root mean square deviation)
from native structures could be distinguished from a pool of decoys
(obtained by perturbing the energy functions and then modeling the
entire protein). The proposed methodology (OSCAR-star) is very
fast while maintaining high accuracy.

2 RESULTS

2.1 Parameter optimization

The parameters of the distance-dependent energy functions
(OSCAR-dstar) were initialized to the corresponding values
(OSCAR-d) previously optimized, by maximizing the energy gap
between the native conformation and rotamers at each modeled
position (Liang et al., 2011a). To model a side chain at a given
position, OSCAR-dstar exploited a limited number of rigid rotamers
to ﬁnd the rotamer that had the lowest energy. The original OSCAR—
d parameters were sensitive to discrete errors of rigid rotamers and
the mean RMSD of the lowest energy rotamers was as large as
0.785 A for a training set of 40 000 side chains per residue type (the
rotamer interior energy was calculated the same as OSCAR-d). We
then optimized the parameters to improve the accuracy by Monte
Carlo (MC) simulation. Consequently, the RMSD was dropped to
0.734A and the accuracy (90.9% for X1 and 80.8% for X1+2) for
single residues in 30 test proteins was similar to that of OSCAR-
d with a ﬂexible rotamer model. In the next step, the optimized
OSCAR-dstar potential was multiplied by an orientation-dependent
function to yield OSCAR-star. The parameters of the orientation-
dependent function were optimized by simultaneously minimizing
the RMSD of the lowest energy rotamer at each modeled position
and the RMSD of the lowest energy decoy obtained by perturbing the
energy functions and then modeling the entire protein. As a result,
the prediction accuracy of OSCAR-star increased by 0.6 and 0.7%
for X1 and X1+2, respectively, compared with OSCAR-dstar when
modeling all residues in each of the 218 test proteins.

2.2 Comparison with other methods

We compared the performance of OSCAR-star with other top-
ranked side-chain modeling programs (Table 1) such as CISRR
(Cao et al., 2011), SCWRL4 (Krivov et al., 2009), LGA

bOPUS_Rota was run on one Intel Xeon 3.0 GHz processor and other programs were

0The prediction accuracies of SCWRL4, LGA, NCN, OPUS_Rota, OSCAR-d and
OSCAR-o were obtained from our previous work (Liang et al., 2011a).

(Liang and Grishin, 2002), NCN (Peterson et al., 2004), OPUS_Rota
(Lu et al., 2008), OSCAR—d and OSCAR—o. OSCAR—star had better
prediction accuracies than other programs except OSCAR-o and
was faster than all but three programs: SCWRL4, OPUS_Rota and
OSCAR-dstar. In other words, OSCAR-star was more accurate than
all of the faster side-chain modeling programs. According to a paired
t-test, the X1 accuracy difference between OSCAR— star and the three
programs was statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.0001).

The performance of a side-chain modeling is affected by the
energy function, structural representation and search algorithm.
Efﬁcient search algorithms save time but help little to improve the
prediction accuracy. For rigid-rotamer—based side-chain modeling
programs such as OSCAR-star, the MC simulation time is
less than that used to calculate rotamer—backbone and rotamer—
rotamer interaction energies in the initial stage (see Methods in
Supplementary Material). Orientation-dependent energy functions
are essential for high accuracy. For example, OPUS_Rota, the
most accurate side-chain modeling program after OSCAR methods
(Table 1), uses orientation-dependent statistical energy functions. On
the other hand, ﬂexible rotamer models, which are time consuming,
cannot achieve accurate predictions without high-quality energy
functions. In fact, the three programs using ﬂexible rotamers,
CISRR, SCWRL4 and NCN, have lower accuracies than the rigid-
rotamer—based OPUS_Rota and OSCAR- star. OSCAR-o, which uses
both orientation-dependent energy functions and a ﬂexible roamer
model, is the most accurate and also slower than the other methods.
With a state-of—the-art search algorithm, SCWRL4 is the fastest,
even though a ﬂexible rotamer model is used.

2.3 Protein loop selection with OSCAR-star

We have previously demonstrated that OSCAR-o has higher
accuracy than other energy functions in selecting near native
conformations from loop decoys (Liang et al., 2011b). Here, we
compared the performance of OSCAR-star with OSCAR-o for the
RAPPER decoy set (de Bakker et al., 2003), in which every loop
target contained 1000 decoys optimized by side-chain modeling and
50 top scored decoys further optimized by energy minimization. We
modeled side-chain conformations of loop residues with OSCAR-
o/OSCAR-star before each energy calculation. For the decoys
without energy minimization, OSCAR-star demonstrated better
performance than OSCAR-o in 7 out of 11 loop lengths from 2
to 12 and equal accuracy for ﬁve-residue loops. For the energy-
minimized decoys, OSCAR-star was effective for long loops but
poor for short loops compared with the more accurate OSCAR-o.
The relatively coarse— grained OSCAR— star was superior to OSCAR-
0, which was sensitive to incomplete sampling and atomic clashes,
for decoys without energy minimization. Moreover, it took 5 min
for OSCAR-star to model side-chain conformations of 1000 decoys
for an eight-residue loop target compared with 5 h for OSCAR-
o. OSCAR-star is thus appropriate for the initial stage of loop
modeling. Side-chain conformations can be modeled very fast at
candidate loop backbones, which makes it possible to sample loop
conformations extensively (>1000 decoys). The top ranked decoys
can be then energy minimized and evaluated by more accurate force
ﬁelds such as OSCAR-o.

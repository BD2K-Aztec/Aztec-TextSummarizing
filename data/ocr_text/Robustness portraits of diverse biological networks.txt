ABSTRACT

Motivation: Biological networks are robust to a wide variety of
internal and external perturbations, yet fragile or sensitive to a small
minority of perturbations. Due to this rare sensitivity of networks
to certain perturbations, it is unclear how precisely biochemical
parameters must be experimentally measured in order to accurately
predict network function.

Results: Here, we examined a model of cardiac ﬂ-adrenergic
signaling and found that its robustness portrait, a global measure
of steady-state network function, was well conserved even when all
parameters were rounded to their nearest 1—2 orders of magnitude.
In contrast, ﬂ-adrenergic network kinetics were more sensitive
to parameter precision. This analysis was then extended to 10
additional networks, including Escherichia coli chemotaxis, stem
cell differentiation and cytokine signaling, of which nine exhibited
conserved robustness portraits despite the order-of-magnitude
approximation of their biochemical parameters. Thus, both fragile
and robust aspects of diverse biological networks are largely
shaped by network topology and can be predicted despite order-
of-magnitude uncertainty in biochemical parameters. These findings
suggest an iterative strategy where order-of-magnitude models are
used to prioritize experiments toward the fragile network elements
that require precise measurements, efficiently driving model revision.

1 INTRODUCTION

Robustness is a key emergent property of many biological systems
(Kitano, 2004; Stelling et al., 2004). Systems are considered
robust if they are able to retain core functionality in the face
of external (e. g. temperature, ligand concentration) and internal
(e. g. gene or protein expression) perturbations. Robustness despite
variations in biochemical parameters has been observed in a number
of computational and experimental studies, including bacterial
chemotaxis (Alon et al., 1999; Barkai and Leibler, 1997; Kollmann
et al., 2005), segment polarity in insect development (Meir et al.,
2002; von Dassow et al., 2000), NFKB oscillations (Paszek
et al., 2010; Tay et al., 2010) and osmoregulation (Krantz et al.,
2009; Muzzey et al., 2009; Shinar and Feinberg, 2010). Network
robustness leads to the hypothesis that proper network function

does not require ﬁne—tuning of biochemical parameters (Barkai and
Leibler, 1997).

However, many of these studies have also shown that the same
network can be highly sensitive to certain perturbations, leading
to the qualiﬁcation that complex networks are ‘robust, yet fragile’
(Csete and Doyle, 2002). A fundamental challenge presented by
this alternate View is that, without having measured all biochemical
parameters with high precision a priori, it is uncertain whether one
could accurately predict to which perturbations a network is ‘fragile’
or ‘robust’.

In this study we asked, ‘What is the quantitative precision of
biochemical parameters required to accurately predict the ‘robust
yet fragile’ nature of a biological network?’ Starting with a well—
Validated model of cardiac ,B—adrenergic signaling (Saucerman
et al., 2004), we systematically characterized this network’s steady—
state functional relationships, or robustness portrait, with both the
original, ﬁne—tuned model and a model in with each parameter
was rounded to its nearest order of magnitude. The order—of—
magnitude parameter approximation introduced here is analogous
to techniques widely used in physics and engineering. Robustness
portraits of the original and approximate models were well
correlated, even when parameters were approximated to their nearest
two orders of magnitude. Order—of—magnitude approximate models
also outperformed randomized models of equivalent parameter
variance. We then applied the order—of—magnitude analysis to 10
additional biological networks and found that most networks were
similarly insensitive to order—of—magnitude parameter estimates.
This indicates that quantitative functional relationships are largely
shaped by network topology. The ability to predict the ‘robust yet
fragile’ nature of biological networks despite order—of—magnitude
parameter uncertainty suggests a strategy where order—of—magnitude
models are used to identify the experiments that reveal the most
fragile, information—rich aspects of a biological network, efﬁciently
guiding model reﬁnement.

2 METHODS

2.1 Computational models

All model simulations were performed in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick,
MA, USA) using the stiff ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver
ode15s. We implemented our computational model of cardiac ﬁ—adrenergic
signaling (Saucerman et 611., 2004), excluding connected models of excitation
contraction coupling. In addition, we obtained 10 computational models from
either the BioModels database (Le Novere et 611., 2006) or the database of
quantitative cellular signaling (DOQCS) (Sivakumaran et 611., 2003). Models
from the BioModels database were obtained in SBML format and converted
to MATLAB script using the Systems Biology Workbench’s BioModels

Importer (Sauro et al., 2003). The model from DOQCS was implemented
directly as a MATLAB script.

2.2 Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity matrices for each model were generated by comparing the steady—
state values of all state variables (species) from the unperturbed model
against models in which individual model parameters were altered by a
set percentage. Initial conditions from the original model were retained
for perturbed models. Individual elements of sensitivity matrices were
computed according to the equation Sij=(AYi/APj)(P0,j/YO,,-), where Si]-
is an individual, steady—state sensitivity coefﬁcient for species ‘i’ when
parameter ‘j’ is perturbed. AY, is the steady—state change in species ‘i’
when parameter ‘j’ is altered by APj. These sensitivities are normalized
to the original steady—state value of output ‘i’ (YOJ) and parameter ‘j’ (PW).
For example, if a 5% increase in the value of parameter #2 causes a 4%
decrease in the steady—state level of variable #3, the corresponding sensitivity
coefﬁcient S32 is —0.8. Each column in the sensitivity matrix represents a
single simulation in which a single parameter value was adjusted (typically
by 5%) and the resulting steady—state changes in all model outputs were
computed. Thus, these matrices show a total of ill-*nj predictions from nj
numerical experiments.

2.3 Order of magnitude parameter approximations,
parameter randomization, correlation analysis

Order—of—magnitude approximations were implemented according to the
function:
OOMPA(p0, nOOM) = 10”OOMround(10g10(MD/"00w (1)

where the parameter nOOM describes the roughness of each approximation
and is not restricted to integer values. For example, nOOM 20.5 will round
parameters to their nearest half order—of—magnitude approximation, nOOM = 1
rounds parameters to their nearest one order of magnitude, etc. p0 denotes
the vector of original parameter values. The function r0und(x) rounds its
argument to the nearest integer (fractions with 0.5 are rounded up). A
visualization of this procedure is provided in Figure 1C. For example, based
on Equation (1) and Figure 1C, we see that for an original parameter value
p0 20.2: OOMPA (0.2, nOOM =1) 2 0.1, OOMPA (0.2, nOOM = 2) = 1.0 and
OOMPA (0.2, nOOM = 0.5):10-0.5 2 .3162.

For simulations with randomized parameters, parameter values were
generated from a loglO—normal distribution [similar to Sobie (2009)] using
the equation:
prand Zpo ' IOCV’randn (2)
where p0 and prand are the original and randomized parameter value vectors,
respectively, and randn is a vector with elements sampled from a normal
distribution of mean zero and SD 1. CV is a coefﬁcient of variation that
quantiﬁes the overall magnitude of the parameter change applied by the
OOMPA approximation, calculated by:

CV = StdeVUOg 10 (POOMPA) — 10810 (190)) (3)

Pearson product—moment correlation coefﬁcients (Rodgers and Nicewander,
1988) were computed to compare individual sensitivity coefﬁcients from
the original model with perturbed models (using either order—of—magnitude
parameter approximations or randomized parameters).

events leading to protein kinase A (PKA) activation and substrate
phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). The mechanisms of this signaling
network were modeled previously using systems of algebraic
and ODEs, constrained using biochemical parameters from the
experimental literature (Saucerman et al., 2004). The current model
uses 86 parameters to predict 23 relevant outputs (state variables).
Figure 1B shows example model time course predictions in response
to a transient isoproterenol (ISO) exposure. With ISO, G—proteins
readily activate (Gsa—GTP) and signal to adenylyl cyclase (AC),
catalyzing the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP); cAMP activates
PKA, which phosphorylates a number of downstream targets
[including phospholamban (PLB)], contributing to the enhanced
contractile activity seen in ISO—stimulated cardiac myocytes
(Harding et al., 1988).

Construction and parameterization of the ,B—adrenergic network
model greatly beneﬁted from a wealth of prior experimental data.
However, such data may not be available for newly discovered
or less characterized pathways. Motivated by this challenge, we
asked: are this network’s core functional properties sensitive to
precise biochemical parameter values? To address this question,
we applied a mathematical procedure that generated order—of—
magnitude parameter approximations (OOMPA) for all model
parameters [see Section 2.3, Equation (1)]. This procedure takes
an original parameter value p and rounds it to its nearest order
of magnitude; the ‘roughness’ of the approximation is dictated
by the term nOOM. For 1100le, OOMPA rounds each given
parameter to its nearest one order—of—magnitude. nOOM :2 will
round values to their nearest two orders of magnitude, and so on.

coefﬁcients (rows of the matrix). Thus, the matrix provides a global portrait of the robust and fragile functional relationships in the network. (B) Sensitivity

A visualization of the procedure is provided in Figure 1C. Note
that larger values of nOOM restrict parameters to fewer absolute
values (e. g. nOOM = 2 restricts parameters to only three values over
the depicted range). Figure 1D shows example time courses from
an order—of—magnitude ,B—adrenergic model simulation (nOOM = 1)
with 10 nM ISO stimulation as in Figure 1B. While quantitative
discrepancies are apparent when comparing Figure 1B and D, the
kinetics of the original and OOMPA models were qualitatively
similar, suggesting preserved core network functionality.

3.2 Inﬂuence of order-of-magnitude parameter
approximations 0n the robustness portrait of
,B-adrenergic signaling

Previous analysis of this model focused on a few key aspects of

,B—adrenergic signaling. Here, we sought to more comprehensively

investigate this network’s functional relationships. To do this, we

systematically perturbed each individual biochemical parameter
and plotted the sensitivities of all model outputs as a 2D

matrix of sensitivity coefﬁcients (see Section 2.2), obtaining a

robustness portrait (Fig. 2A). Given a parameter perturbation AP,

individual sensitivity coefﬁcients were calculated according to SU- =

(AYi/APjXPOJ/YOJ), where SU- is the steady—state sensitivity of

output Y ,- to parameter perturbation APj. State variables are ordered

from upstream (receptor level) to downstream (PKA targets) down

the rows of the matrix. Note that the matrix shown in Figure 2A is
a reduced version that focuses only on perturbations of total species
concentrations (28 of the 86 total parameters). Complete sensitivity
matrices are provided in Supplementary Figure S 1. In this particular
example, parameters were increased 5% from their baseline values
(for matrices with varying AP, see Supplementary Fig. S2). For
each ‘perturbation experiment’ (column of the matrix), the model
was run to steady state with the indicated parameter perturbation
and all model outputs (rows) were compared to their steady—state
values from an unperturbed simulation. In all simulations, ligand
concentration (Ltot) was set at a non—saturating dose of 10 nM to
allow for detectable changes in outputs (for matrices with varying
initial Ltot, see Supplementary Fig. S3).

This analysis highlights several key properties of the ,B—adrenergic
signaling network. Note that the robustness portrait is enriched with
a large number of sensitive outputs on its left half, suggesting the
network is globally most sensitive to perturbations of upstream
components. This result is a function of the network’s topology,
where upstream species dictate the level of PKA activation, the main
hub in this system. Also, the robustness portrait highlights the role
of the negative feedback loop from PKA to the ,81 receptor on both
upstream and downstream activity levels (PKAItot and PKAIItot
columns). In addition to these qualitative observations, this analysis
allows for quantitative assessment of the network’s most sensitive
interactions. Note that a 5% perturbation to the amount of present

Biological networks

 

ligand (Ltot) results in slight steady—state changes, while the same
size perturbation to total [AC] (ACtot) produces larger individual
sensitivity coefﬁcients for the same outputs. The network is also very
sensitive to the levels of phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which appear
to be important negative regulators of this cascade’s functionality.
Thus, sensitivity analysis of this form provides a unique platform
from which the robustness portrait of a signaling network can be
explored.

To examine how the precision of biochemical parameters affects
the system’s robustness portrait, we performed sensitivity analysis
on the order—of—magnitude model (Fig. 2B) and compared the results
to those of the original model (Fig. 2C). By inspection, global
patterns of sensitivities are well preserved by the approximate
model. Note that both models are highly sensitive to perturbations
of certain species (e.g. AC and PDEs) but less so for others
(e.g. PKA substrates LCC and RyR). A Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient of 0.82 was computed between the individual sensitivities
of the two models, indicating substantial quantitative agreement.
In addition, all sensitivities were in the 1st or 3rd quadrants
of Figure 2C, indicating no major qualitative discrepancies.
While the focus here is a systematic comparison to the original
validated biochemical model, the predictions of the order—of—
magnitude ,B—adrenergic model are also consistent with a wide
range of published experimental measurements on this pathway
(Supplementary Table Sl). Thus, this network’s steady—state
properties appear to be robust to the precision of biochemical
parameters within an order of magnitude.

Given that predictions from the approximate model with nOOM =
1 were quite similar to the original model, we compared additional
approximate models of varying nOOM (01—4) to determine
how ﬁne—tuned the biochemical parameters must be to obtain
accurate predictions of functional relationships. For the ,B—adrenergic
network, even rounding biochemical parameters to the nearest
two orders of magnitude (nOOM=2) still produced reasonably
informative predictions (r=0.63), but models with nOOM > 2
performed poorly (r<0.2) (Fig. 2D; see Supplementary Fig. S4
for original sensitivity matrices). Thus, the steady—state behavior of
the ,B—adrenergic network is remarkably robust to the precise values
of its biochemical parameters, but knowledge of network topology
alone is insufﬁcient for accurate predictions. In contrast, the kinetic
time courses of the 23 species (shown partially in Fig. 1D) were
more sensitive to parameter precision, yielding a moderate Pearson’s
correlation coefﬁcient of 0.32.

3.3 Order-of-magnitude approximations outperform
randomized models

The above analysis indicates that the steady—state functional
properties of ,B—adrenergic signaling were preserved when
parameters were approximated to their nearest two orders of
magnitude. Given these observations, we next asked whether
or not similar results are obtained when parameter values are
assigned at random. To address this question, we ran additional
simulations in which all model parameters were simultaneously
perturbed by random noise. Individual parameter noise strengths
were randomly drawn from loglO—normal distributions whose
variances were equivalent to those of order—of—magnitude models
(see Section 2). For example, nOOM =1 (rounding to the nearest 1
order of magnitude) had a coefﬁcient of variation (CV) of 0.2991;

this value was used as the variance for parameter noise when
comparing randomized models to nOOM :1 models. More than 50
randomized simulations were run for each CV tested.

The effects of parameter randomization on PLB phosphorylation
dynamics for CV = 0.2991 (equivalent to the parameter changes with
nOOM = 1) are shown in Figure 3A. With parameter randomization,
predicted kinetics can differ considerably from the original model,
similar to the kinetic results from order—of—magnitude models.
But are steady—state network properties similarly preserved in
response to random parameter ﬂuctuations? We found that the
robustness portraits of order—of—magnitude models were statistically
more strongly correlated with the original model than were
those of the randomized models, especially as CV increased

(Fig. 3B). For example, at CV=0.2991, randomized ,B—adrenergic
models had an average correlation coefﬁcient of just 0.58
compared with the original ,B—adrenergic model. Order—of—magnitude
models outperformed randomized models, because all order—of—
magnitude parameter perturbations were generally restricted to
that particular order—of—magnitude, while randomized perturbations
could occasionally be larger.

3.4 Application of order-of-magnitude approximation
to 10 additional biological networks

The above results indicate that the steady—state properties of
the cardiac ,B—adrenergic signaling network are robust to order—
of—magnitude parameter approximations within two orders of
magnitude. We next asked whether this robustness property may be
generalized to other biological networks. We extended this analysis
to 10 additional computational models, 9 of which are curated
models from the BioModels database (Le Novere et al., 2006)
and 1 (Bhalla, 2004) from the DOQCS (Sivakumaran et al., 2003)
(Table 1). These speciﬁc models were chosen in an attempt to
survey a wide range of biological networks of varying size and
function. As done with the ,B—adrenergic signaling network, we
generated order—of—magnitude parameter approximations for each
model (nOOM = 01,05, 1, 2, 3 and 4), performed sensitivity analysis
on each model and computed correlation coefﬁcients between the
robustness portrait of each approximate model and its corresponding
original model’s robustness portrait (Fig. 4 and Supplementary
Fig. SS). Note that nOOM=0 in Figure 4 indicates comparisons

between each default model and itself, which produces r=1 in all
cases.

In general, order—of—magnitude models with nOOM 51 strongly
correlated with their corresponding default models. Nine out of
ten networks produced correlation coefﬁcients >0.75 for nOOM = 1,
though correlation typically dropped dramatically when nOOM was
2 3. Given that one model, the lac operon gene circuit (Yildirim
and Mackey, 2003), performed quite poorly at nOOM Z 1, we
investigated whether there were certain network features that could
explain its weaker overall performance. We ﬁrst hypothesized
that network size could be an important predictive feature for
robustness to order—of—magnitude parameter precision. However,
we observed a weak relationship between model size and network
robustness: correlation coefﬁcients at nOOM :1 for all tested
models only weakly correlated with model size in terms of number
of state variables (r=0.41) or number of parameters (r=0.19)
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Another explanation could be the existence
of multistable states, whereby slight parameter adjustments allow
networks to traverse a bifurcation. Bifurcations, by deﬁnition,
alter the qualitative behavior of a system as a result of small
changes in its underlying parameters (Strogatz, 1994). Indeed, the
lac operon network model contains a bifurcation (Yildirim and
Mackey, 2003), which contributed to its poor overall performance
during our analysis. But not all such models peform poorly: the
CaMKII and stem cell models also exhibit multistability, yet are
globally much more robust to order—of—magnitude approximation.
Thus, the observation of conserved robustness portraits despite
order—of—magnitude parameter uncertainty applies to a wide range
of biological networks.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we computationally explored conservation of global
functional relationships in biological signaling networks in the
face parameter imprecision. Starting with a biochemically detailed
computational model of cardiac ,B—adrenergic signaling (Saucerman
et al., 2004), order—of—magnitude analysis revealed that this network
shows a steady—state ‘robustness portrait’ that is insensitive to
parameter precision within two orders of magnitude. However,
predictive capability was lost when parameter approximations
became very rough (nOOM Z 3) or when parameters were randomly
assigned, suggesting that this network’s function depends on both
network topology and biochemical parameter precision within
1—2 orders of magnitude. We then extended this analysis to
10 additional signaling networks, ﬁnding that key properties of these
networks were also generally preserved when order—of—magnitude
approximations were applied. Thus, the steady—state robustness
portrait of a signaling network can be predicted even when parameter
data are imprecise. This systems insight suggests a rational approach
for prioritizing experiments towardsthe most fragile elements of
a network, driving subsequent model revision and quantitative
understanding.

Fig. 4. Order—of—magnitude parameter approximations retain core functional properties of 10 diverse biological networks. Models of 10 diverse biological
systems were obtained from the BioModels or DOQCS databases (listed in Table 1). Order—of—magnitude approximations were applied to each model with
varying nOOM (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4) and correlations between approximate and original model sensitivities were computed. At nOOM = 1, Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcients were >0.75 for 9 out of 10 models. Beyond two orders of magnitude, predictive power typically dropped dramatically.

of the ,B—adrenergic signaling network has revealed a number of
new speciﬁc insights into its function (Saucerman et al., 2003,
2004), but this study provided a more comprehensive view of how
each of the network’s components affect each other in the network.
We found that this network is globally differentially sensitive to
equivalent quantitative perturbations in some species (e. g. total [AC]
and [PDE]) as opposed to others (e.g. small changes in ligand).
Such information was not readily apparent from our previous
analyses, but is consistent with experimental data (Supplementary
Table Sl).

Development of the original ,B—adrenergic model was largely
facilitated by a wealth of prior experimental work that aided model
parameterization. Given that such data may not be readily available
for newly discovered pathways, we were motivated to assess the
importance of using tightly constrained parameter values in this
model system. We used order—of—magnitude approximations to
determine whether or not rough estimates of biochemical parameter
values would still capture the global functional properties of this
network. Order—of—magnitude approximations are widely used in
engineering and physics, and their use here demonstrates utility for
analysis of complex biological networks. Original and approximate
models were compared based on their robustness portraits rather
than the magnitude of state variables, because identifying sensitive
components is typically more important for prioritizing experimental
studies.

Order—of—magnitude analysis revealed that steady—state functional
relationships in this network are quite robust to the precision of
parameter values, while signaling kinetics are more sensitive. This
ﬁnding is consistent with prior analyses of other systems. In bacterial
chemotaxis, steady—state adaptation is remarkably robust, though the
kinetics of adaptation vary considerably when parameters ﬂuctuate

(Barkai and Leibler, 1997). In the EGF signaling network, accurate
prediction of kinetics required extremely precise direct parameter
measurements, although steady—state functional relationships were
not examined (Gutenkunst et al., 2007). Interestingly, the same
study showed that the kinetics of EGF and many other signaling
pathways could be numerically ﬁt to data by many distinct parameter
combinations due to the high degree of parameter covariance or
‘sloppiness’ (Gutenkunst et al., 2007).

4.2 Generality of results and implications for future
work

To determine the generality of the results obtained from our
analysis of ,B—adrenergic signaling, we applied order—of—magnitude
approximation to 10 additional biological networks. The steady—
state robustness portraits for most of these networks were also
conserved for parameter values within one or two orders of
magnitude. This suggests that the conclusions regarding order—
of—magnitude parameter sensitivities in ,B—adrenergic signaling are
applicable across a wide range of biological processes. However, we
did encounter one network where parameter approximation more
substantially affected its robustness portrait. In particular, the lac
operon model contained a bifurcation that qualitatively affected
the functionality of the network at nOOM = 1. This represents a
speciﬁc case where the underlying network parameters exert a major
inﬂuence over a network’s core functionality. While robustness of
the mono— and multi—stable systems examined here focused on the
steady state, this analysis could be extended to quantify dynamic
features such as decay rates or the period and phase properties
of oscillations as performed for circadian rhythms (Bagheri et al.,
2007).

The results shown here are consistent with previous studies
of network robustness to parameter variation. Von Dassow et al.
examined the segment polarity genetic network in Drosophila
and, using Monte Carlo sampling of the parameter space, showed
that a wide range of parameter combinations could predict the
desired developmental patterning (von Dassow et al., 2000). The
geometry of parameter space for this segment polarity network
was subsequently examined further, ﬁnding that on average the
phenotype was maintained during a random walk in parameter
space for ~2000 steps (Dayarian et al., 2009). Rather than taking
random walks in parameter space, in the current study we identiﬁed
an efﬁcient deterministic approach to quantify the necessary
parameter precision in experimentally relevant units (e. g. 1 order—of—
magnitude). With our analysis, we examined the effects of parameter
precision on the robustness portrait, a global quantitative measure
of functional relationships between all network species, rather than
focusing on a single, qualitative phenotype. Further, this analysis
was performed on 11 biological networks, demonstrating remarkable
similarity across biological systems. Benetele et al. developed a
model of apoptosis signaling in which they generated sensitivity
matrices similar to those shown here (Bentele et al., 2004). While
they also found that most sensitivities were robust to variations in
parameter values in their apoptosis model, the degree of parameter
precision needed to accurately predict the sensitivity matrix was
not quantiﬁed. Instead, the focus there was on using sensitivity
analysis to systematically reduce model complexity and estimate
parameter values (Bentele et al., 2004). Thus, our analysis extends
previous concepts of robustness to parameter variation, quantifying
how parameter precision affects the global network relationships
across a diverse range of biological networks.

Overall, our results indicate that sensitivity analysis can help
reveal critical regulatory patterns within a signaling network, even
with imprecise parameter values. Not only can this analysis help
visualize functional dependencies between network constituents,
it can also reveal critical nodes most sensitive to perturbations.
Such analysis is useful from a modeling perspective, but can also
aid experimentalists by providing a framework from which future
experiments can be prioritized. As an example, we found that the
,B—adrenergic signaling network was very sensitive to active levels
of PDEs. Notably, PDE inhibition is an active area of research for
the treatment of chronic heart failure (Van Tassell et al., 2008). Such
uniﬁcation of computational and experimental studies can facilitate
more comprehensive understanding of global network functionality
and aid in the search for new therapeutic avenues to complex
diseases.

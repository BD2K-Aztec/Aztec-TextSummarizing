ABSTRACT

Motivation: Enormous and constantly increasing quantity of
biological information is represented in metabolic and in protein
interaction network databases. Most of these data are freely
accessible through large public depositories. The robust analysis of
these resources needs novel technologies, being developed today.

Results: Here we demonstrate a technique, originating from the
PageRank computation for the World Wide Web, for analyzing large
interaction networks. The method is fast, scalable and robust, and
its capabilities are demonstrated on metabolic network data of the
tuberculosis bacterium and the proteomics analysis of the blood of
melanoma patients.

Availability: The Perl script for computing the personalized
PageRank in protein networks is available for non-profit research
applications (together with sample input files) at the address:

1 INTRODUCTION

The problem of ﬁnding important nodes in a large network emerged
in several ﬁelds, but the best solutions to date were appeared in
conjunction of the World Wide Web graph. Here the nodes are the
web pages, and directed edges are the hyperlinks between the web
pages. The web search engine techniques gave motivations to this
question, since the important web pages, related to a web search,
need to be returned ﬁrst to the users of the web search service.

The most natural measure of importance of a vertex, the degree
(i.e. the number of connected edges, in the case of an undirected
graph) or the in—degree (i.e. the number of incoming edges, in
the case of directed graphs) is historically well established, and
corresponds, e.g. in scientometry, to the number of citations to a
published article. However, in the case of the web graph, the degree
proved to be easy to manipulate, by simply inserting artiﬁcially a
large number of referring edges into the graph.

Kleinberg’s HITS algorithm assigns quality scores to the nodes,
and the quality of the referring nodes is inherited by the referred
nodes, so low—quality manipulations can be ﬁltered out. It turned out,
however, that the HITS algorithm is also prone to more sophisticated
manipulations, and it is not robust enough (Lee and Borodin, 2003).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The most successful web page ranking algorithm, the PageRank
algorithm, was developed by Erin and Page (1998), and used in
the search engine of Google. The algorithm can be described as
the following random walk on the graph: the walker starts at a
uniformly chosen random vertex of the graph, then with probability
l—c it follows a uniformly selected, random outleading edge from
the vertex, and with probability c it teleports to a uniformly selected,
random vertex of the graph, where 0 < c < l. The PageRank of a node
v, corresponding to a certain sense to its importance, is the stationary
limit probability distribution, that the walker is at the node v.

In applications for biological networks, the stability of the
PageRank is the most attractive property, since the published
protein interaction networks contain numerous false positive and
false negative interaction edges, even for the highest quality of
data gathered for one of the most researched subjects, the yeast
interactome (Gavin et al., 2006; G01] and Uetz, 2006; Krogan et al.,
2006). Therefore, network—ranking algorithms need to be stable in
the case of a moderate number of false positives and false negatives.

The best stability estimation for the PageRank (Lee and Borodin,
2003) is given by the following inequality:

A 2(1—6)
lip—pill: C 2191-,

jeU

 

where i—th coordinate of vector p gives the PageRank of vertex i,
and vector p gives the PageRank of the vertices after edges with
endpoints in set U are deleted or added. In other words, if c is not
too close to 0, and only the edges between less important nodes are
perturbed, then the impact of this perturbation remains low to the
PageRank. It is a remarkable property, since less important protein
interactions are seldom mapped reliably, and the inequality shows
that these errors will not accumulate to inﬂuence much of the overall
PageRank vector.

2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

2.1 PageRank for the analysis of metabolic networks

Protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks are usually represented
by undirected graphs. For undirected graphs, PageRank is
proportional to the degree of the nodes, so it does not help in
choosing more important or less important nodes in the network,
relative to simple degree counting. However, metabolic graphs
are directed graphs, with nodes representing biochemical reactions
and a directed edge connects nodes u and v if reaction M has
a product that is used by reaction v. Therefore, the PageRank
calculations may enlighten deep and robust network properties of
the graph. We computed PageRank for the metabolic network of the

Fig. 1. Two dense subgraphs from the metabolic graph of the M. tuberculosis. On the left panel, large nodes correspond to large degree, but yellowish colors
correspond to low PageRank. On the right panel, the small but orange—colored R066l3 correspond to the KEGG reaction ID, catalyzed by the ThyX enzyme.

(Myllykallio et 61]., 2002).

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Supplementary Fig. S1). In that ﬁgure,
the warmer colors show higher PageRanks, and the size of the nodes
are proportional to their degree.

Consequently, those vertices that are warmer in color than that
were proportional to their degree are of special interest: they
are more ‘important’, more frequently hit by the random walker
than the others with the same local network property, the vertex
degree. It is a remarkable ﬁnding in the metabolic network of the
tuberculosis bacterium, that a recently found important protein, the
FAD—dependent thymidylate synthase [(ThyX); Myllykallio et al.,
2002] has the sixth largest PageRank in the network, much larger
than other nodes with higher degree (Fig. l and Supplementary
Table S2). The high PageRank may be due to the particularities
of the thymidilate biosynthesis pathway in Mycobacteria (Vertessy
and Toth, 2009).

2.2 Personalized PageRank for PPI networks

The personalized PageRank was developed for the prediction of
the personal preferences in the valuation of the content on the
World Wide Web (Page et al., 1999). In computing the personalized
PageRank, the randomized walker teleports with the probability
of c—l—c’ where 0 < c—l—c’ < l; with probability 6’ to some vertices,
corresponding to the personal interest of the WWW surfer, and with
probability 6 to the remaining vertices of ‘no—personal—interest’.

Personalized PageRank seems to be capable to robustly evaluate
the importance of the vertices of a network, relatively to some
already known relevant nodes: if the random walker teleports to
the important nodes with much higher probability than to any other
vertices, then the resulting limit distribution will mark the nodes in
the neighborhood of the relevant nodes with higher personalized
PageRank. Additionally, personalized PageRank computation is
scalable: it can be well approximated even for the largest networks
encountered (Fogaras et al., 2005).

We demonstrate here the applicability of the personalized
PageRank in the evaluation of proteomics data. In proteomical
analysis, low concentration proteins seldom appear reliably in the
results, and therefore the robustness property of the PageRank
computation is more than useful.

We considered the proteomics data of melanoma patients
published in Forgber et al. (2009): 13 proteins were detected with
higher levels in the plasma. We personalized the PageRank to these
nodes in the human PPI graph HPRD (Prasad et al., 2009) (of,
Materials and Methods in the online Supplementary Material for
details). The HPRD human interactome contains 27 801 nodes,
corresponding to human proteins, and 38 806 edges between these
proteins, corresponding to interactions. Supplementary Table S3
contains the list of the largest rank nodes, and Supplementary
Figure S4 contains more than 8700 nodes of the human protein
interactome, situated closer to at least one of the chosen proteins
than three edges.

It is a remarkable result that many proteins of the largest PageRank
vertices are clearly related to melanoma (Table l and in a more
complete form provided in Supplementary Table S5). More exactly,
the 22 topmost ranged nodes, 10 are the nodes we personalized to
(colored by light yellow on Table 1, therefore their high rank is
natural), two have no apparent relation to the melanoma (colored
by light gray on Table l) and the green rows have clear relation to
cancer (literary references are given in Supplementary Table S5).

One should remark that by the UniProt database, 160 human
proteins are related to melanoma (Consortium, 2010). That is, 0.57%
of the proteins in the analyzed 27 800 nodes in HPRD (Prasad et al.,
2009). This fact represents the selectivity and power of personalized
PageRank computation, together with Table l.

3 CONCLUSIONS

We strongly believe that the synthesis of biology and computer
science (Brent and Bruck, 2006) will open up great possibilities
in the exploitation of the enormous amount of biological data. In
particular, ordinary PageRank can help to evaluate important nodes
and pathways in directed networks, such that metabolic networks,
and the personalized PageRank may facilitate the robust analysis of
large proteomics studies. We should also note that the application of
PageRank—like techniques are not enterily novel in biologic context:
the IsoRank algorithm of Singh et al. (2008), for computing global
network alignment between distinct protein interaction networks,
has deﬁnite similarities to the PageRank algorithm.

Abstract

Genome Wide Association Studies between molecular markers and phenotypes are now routinely
run in model and non-model species. However, tools to estimate the probability of association of
functional units (e.g. genes) containing multiple markers are not developed for species other than
humans. Here we introduce MUGBAS (MUlti species Gene-Based Association Suite), software that
estimates the P—value of a gene using information on annotation, single marker GWA results and
genotype. The software is species and annotation independent, fast, highly parallelized and ready

 

for high-density marker studies.

1 Introduction

With the availability of high-density SNP panels, Genome Wide
Association Studies (GWAS) have become a standard for dissecting
the architecture of complex traits (McCarthy et al., 2008). This is
true for humans, and other species. The underlying idea of GWAS
is simple: find marker-trait associations exploiting the linkage
disequilibrium (LD) that exists between causative mutations—
which we ignore—and ﬂanking markers of known chromosomal
position.

A number of well established approaches can be used in a stand-
ard GWAS (Aulchenko et al., 2007; Kang et al., 2010; Purcell et al.,
2007). These generally use many thousand and sometimes millions
of markers. Statistical thresholds are set considering multiple com-
parisons and may exclude a number of moderate or small effects
actually associated with the traits investigated.

Reducing the number of tests while maintaining all the informa-
tion provided by high-density panels would be a clear advantage.

In addition, once significant signals are detected, different strat-
egies are used to tag the candidate causative genes. Sometimes, all
genes lying in the significant SNP(s) flanking region are included in
further analyses, sometimes only the gene closest to the signal is

further investigated. These choices are arbitrary, may end up in
choosing the wrong genes or in including a large number of false
candidate genes.

Methods have recently been proposed to overcome these limita-
tions using a priori knowledge. The ‘candidate pathway’ analysis
(Raven et al., 2013), and ‘gene-based’ association strategies (Akula
et al., 2011; Cantor et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010) restrict GWA stud-
ies to known genes or gene subsets, resizing the multiple testing
problem and increasing the power of the analyses.

Bioinformatics pipelines are generally developed for the analysis
of human and model organisms, and are often not suited to the
analysis of other species. This is the case of the VEGAS software
(Liu et al. 2010), developed for gene-based analyses in humans. In
fact, this PLINK-based software expects data from 22 autosomes
and pre-calculated LD values available for human HapMap phase 2
data.

Here, we introduce MUGBAS, a software based on VEGAS that
uses GWAS data and a given annotation (typically genes but any
region is suitable) to estimate gene-based and region-based associ-
ation P-values. The suite is species and annotation free, ready to
analyze high-density data from any diploid species.

2 Methods

MUGBAS is a suite of scripts built in Bash, R and Python. The suite
requires several pre-requisites (such as GNU Parallel, bedtools and a
few R libraries) that can be easily fulfilled in a Linux/Unix/Mac
environment with a few command lines. Further information on
how to meet these requirements is detailed in the online repository.

MUGBAS can be invoked launching the Bash wrapper that
checks dependencies and stores user choices.

Required input files are: MAP/PED files in PLINK format with
genotype data from at least 200 individuals for a proper LD calcula-
tion, an annotation file in BED format (chromosome, start position,
end position, name and user custom fields) of the desired genome
feature (e.g. a gene or a genomic region) and the GWAS results file
with mandatory headers ‘SNPNAME’ and ‘PVALUE’. Multiple
association results can be tested at the same time, if provided in sep-
arate files in the same directory. A trial dataset is downloadable
along with the software release. Please note that for simplicity we
provide a gene annotation, but any BED file with any desired feature
can be used.

The program starts the analysis assigning SNPs to the feature of
the given annotation using bedtools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010).
This step is customizable by user defined boundaries (up- and down-
stream) to catch regulatory regions in LD with the current gene/
region. To speed up the analysis, the program subsamples 200 indi-
viduals from the input dataset. Two levels of parallelization are
implemented: one for the LD and one for the ‘gene-wise’ or ‘region-
wise’ P-value calculation. The latter is particularly useful when
more than one GWA results is analysed from the same dataset.

Brieﬂy, MUGBAS first splits the LD estimation in n cores (as
defined by the user) using the R packages foreach / doParallel
(Analytics and Weston, 2014a, b) and then distributes traits across
cores using GNU Parallel (Tange, 2011) and foreach / doPamllel.

Since LD calculation is a slow process, VEGAS benefits of
HapMap phase 2 data to speed up the process, while preserving the
option for a user defined (human) population using PLINK. To
expand these analyses to any species, in MUGBAS LD is estimated
with the r2fast() function of the GenABEL package (Aulchenko
et al., 2007), while the gene-wise P-value is calculated as in VEGAS.
Brieﬂy, the gene-wise test statistic is the sum of the n upper tail one
degree of freedom chi-square values of a SNP subset (where n is the
number of SNP mapping in the given gene). In the case of perfect
linkage equilibrium, the gene-wise P-value would be the one-tailed
P-value of a chi-square distribution with n degrees of freedom.
Otherwise P-values have to be calculated by simulation and
weighted by LD values (Liu et al., 2010).

Following gene/region P-value estimation, a False Discovery
Rate (FDR) q-value statistics is calculated with the base R function
p.adjnst(). Results are stored and enriched with ‘Manhattan’ and
‘underground’ plots of the ‘gene-wise’ P-value and the q-value,
respectively, integrating in the suite publicly available code (http://get
tinggeneticsdone.blogspot.com.br/20 1 1/ 04/ annotated-manhattan-
plots-and-qq-plots.html).

3 Results and discussion

Gene- and region-based GWAS are now widely used and accepted
in genomic research (Mooney et al., 2014). However, non
model-species suffer for the lack of specific tools to permit these
approaches and facilitate post GWAS investigation. MUGBAS pro-
vides researchers dealing with species other than human a set of

robust and widely used statistics to conveniently jump from associ-
ated markers to the desired functional units.

MUGBAS output is gene/region-oriented and provides useful in-
formation on: (i) the location of the analyzed feature, the ‘Best SNP’
genomic coordinates and original P-value; (ii) the gene or region
statistics (P-value, number of simulations and q-value); (iii) the cus-
tom annotation of that particular entry; (iv) the position of the SNP
with respect to the feature and (v) the chosen boundaries. All these
information are useful to track the effect of highly significant
markers that map into the region of interest and effectively pinpoint
the most probable location to focus on with data mining approaches
(i.e.pathway analysis).

Benchmarks with medium-density (50K markers) and high-
density (800K markers) panels showed good scalability of MUGBAS
distributed in 10 mid-performance cores (Intel Xeon X5675 @ 3.07
GHz). Computational performances for a complete analysis ranged
from 8 minutes (medium-density with one trait) to 280 min (high
density with three traits). RAM usage peak (16 Gb) was reached for
the three traits/high density analysis, while for low density panels
RAM had its maximum at 2.5 Gb. Further details are available in
the repository.

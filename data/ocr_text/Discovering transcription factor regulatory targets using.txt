ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identifying the target genes regulated by transcription
factors (TFs) is the most basic step in understanding gene regulation.
Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technology,
together with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChlP), enable mapping
TF binding sites genome wide, but it is not possible to infer function
from binding alone. This is especially true in mammalian systems,
where regulation often occurs through long-range enhancers in gene-
rich neighborhoods, rather than proximal promoters, preventing
straightforward assignment of a binding site to a target gene.
Results: We present EMBER (Expectation Maximization of Binding
and Expression pRofiles), a method that integrates high-throughput
binding data (e.g. ChlP-chip or ChlP-seq) with gene expression
data (e.g. DNA microarray) via an unsupervised machine learning
algorithm for inferring the gene targets of sets of TF binding sites.
Genes selected are those that match overrepresented expression
patterns, which can be used to provide information about multiple
TF regulatory modes. We apply the method to genome-wide human
breast cancer data and demonstrate that EMBER confirms a role
for the TFs estrogen receptor alpha, retinoic acid receptors alpha
and gamma in breast cancer development, whereas the conventional
approach of assigning regulatory targets based on proximity does
not. Additionally, we compare several predicted target genes from
EMBER to interactions inferred previously, examine combinatorial
effects of TFs on gene regulation and illustrate the ability of EMBER
to discover multiple modes of regulation.

1 INTRODUCTION

The fundamental step in gene regulation is a transcription factor (TF)
binding DNA. Recent advances in DNA sequencing and microarray
technologies have led to huge increases in the amount of information
that biologists can accumulate about this process (Berger and Bulyk,
2006; Capaldi et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2009;

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Pepke et al., 2009; Robertson et al., 2007). In particular, ChIP—
chip and ChIP— seq experiments have enabled genome—wide mapping
of TF binding sites in a single experiment. Knowledge of these
binding sites is one of the key steps in determining which genes are
regulated by a TF, but the binding sites alone are not sufﬁcient to
infer regulation.

In simple organisms, such as bacteria or yeast, most
transcriptional regulation occurs by a TF binding in a promoter
region, near the transcription start site (T88) of a gene (Capaldi
et al., 2008; Ptashne, 1992). However, as organisms increase in
complexity, more regulation occurs through long—range enhancers,
often spanning many tens of thousands of base pairs (Amosti and
Kulkami, 2005). In fact, these enhancer interactions become the
principal form of gene regulation in more complex species. For
example, in the human ChIP—chip data (Hua et al., 2008, 2009)
that we discuss later in this article, only 5—10% of the binding
sites are in promoters (deﬁned as 2kb from a TSS). In this case,
it is not obvious which gene a particular binding site may be
regulating: enhancer regulation is independent of the binding site
orientation relative to the regulated gene (Banerji et al., 1981), and
even transcription factors bound to a particular gene may regulate a
different gene through an enhancer (Lee et al., 2005). Additionally,
binding sites in gene—rich locations of the genome have a large
number of potential targets nearby. Although we may have some
idea of the maximum range at which an enhancer is likely to function
(Amosti and Kulkami, 2005), any gene within that distance must be
considered a potential target.

A common approach to assigning gene targets to TF binding sites
is simply to use proximity: regulation is inferred by the presence
of a binding site close to a gene, most often by assignment to the
nearest gene (Fujiwara et al., 2009; Gilchrist et al., 2006; Verzi
et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2009). This approach is clearly an over
simpliﬁcation, as it is not clear that a gene 30 kb from a gene is
signiﬁcantly more likely to be regulated than a gene 40 kb away,
for example. More importantly, this approach can miss important
long—range interactions and is unable to distinguish functional from
non—functional binding sites. In situations where enhancer regulation
is predominant, more information is needed to properly pair binding
sites with their regulatory targets.

We propose using gene expression information to assign TF
binding sites to gene targets. Namely, we assume that genes
regulated by a TF should behave in some measurably consistent
manner. That is, there should be some subset of true targets within the
many potential targets surrounding each binding site, and we should

Discovering transcription factor targets

 

be able to distinguish these true targets by their overrepresented
behaviors. Although there may actually be some variations in
regulatory behavior within the TF binding sites, such as when TFs
act combinatorially, this general idea is a useful motivation for a
data—driven target identiﬁcation method.

There have been several studies published that explore the
integration of gene behaviors with TF binding data. One recent study
(McLean et al., 2010) uses gene ontology, assigning gene targets
by looking for ontological classiﬁcations that are overrepresented
among a subset of the potential target genes. Although this approach
does not require any additional experiments, it is limited by the
availability and accuracy of gene ontology databases and lacks the
quantitative aspect that additional experimental data would provide.
A number of other methods use DNA microarray experiments to
quantify gene expression. Many of these methods focus on the
identiﬁcation of TF activity proﬁles, aiming to identify subsets
of binding sites where the regulated genes behave in a highly
correlated fashion, and thus are co—regulated (Bar—Joseph et al.,
2003; Boulesteix and Strimmer, 2005; Gao et al., 2004). Others use
a modeling approach, ﬁtting dynamical networks to the observed
behaviors in order to infer gene regulation (Sanguinetti et al.,
2003, 2006). However, these methods focus on promoter regulation,
primarily whether binding sites are functional or not. In contrast, our
goal is to identify which gene, out of a number of possibilities, is
regulated by an enhancer site.

In this article, we propose a particular integration of TF binding
and gene expression data paired with an expectation maximization
algorithm (Bailey and Elkan, 1994) for unsupervised machine
learning, to simultaneously discover the gene regulatory targets of
a set of TF binding sites and the expression pattern exhibited by
the regulated genes. We call the method expectation maximization
of binding and expression pRoﬁles (EMBER). Since EMBER
quantitatively ranks all potential target genes based on a discovered
expression pattern, it can infer whether binding sites are functional
and, in turn, their regulatory targets. Also, EMBER can search for
more than one expression pattern, allowing for the discovery of
multiple regulatory modes. The combinatorial effect of multiple TFs
can be studied as well by searching for expression patterns among
different overlapping peak sets.

In Section 2, we ﬁrst describe our data integration approach. Then
we motivate and describe the EMBER algorithm. In Section 3,
we apply the method to ChIP—chip and DNA microarray data
(Hua et al., 2008, 2009) probing the role of TFs estrogen receptor
alpha (ERa), retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARoz) and retinoic acid
receptor gamma (RARy) in human breast cancer development. In
our primary result, we ﬁnd a strong bias toward breast cancer—
related genes for the targets of all three of the above TFs, consistent
with their involvement in breast cancer development, and we
observe that the conventional proximity approach does not obtain
this result. Additionally, we compare the results of EMBER to
inferences made in a previous publication of the data (Hua et al.,
2009). Speciﬁcally, we conﬁrm the regulation of F OXAI , F OS
and GATA3 by these TFs, as well as regulation of ESR] by the
RAR factors, although we do not observe regulation of either
RARA or RARG by these TFs, as had been suggested. We also
investigate the combinatorial effects of these TFs, in particular,
noting some different regulatory behaviors by ERoz in combination
with RARy. Finally, we illustrate EMBER’s ability to ﬁnd multiple
regulatory modes for a single set of binding sites, and demonstrate

its robustness with respect to the range over which genes are
considered.

2 METHODS

Before describing the target identiﬁcation algorithm in EMBER, we lay out
the context of the problem and give a general overview of the steps involved.
We start with a series of experiments measuring expression and at least one
experiment measuring binding. DNA microarray data should be normalized
[by any of the standard procedures used for microarrays (Li and Wong, 2003;
Smyth, 2004; Townsend and Hartl, 2002; Wu et 01., 2003)] and curated to
remove control probe sets and ones that are never expressed to a high level.
ChIP—seq or ChIP—chip data should be aligned with peaks called [again,
by standard procedures (Bernstein et al., 2005; Cawley et al., 2004; Pepke
et al., 2009; Valouev et al., 2008)]. Given these data, there are essentially four
steps, which are illustrated in Figure 1. The ﬁrst three steps are preprocessing
and data integration steps, mostly in regards to the DNA microarray data.
These initial analyses are detailed in the next subsection. In brief, the steps
are (i) to deﬁne behavior dimensions from binary comparisons between the
microarray conditions (Fig. 1A); (ii) to classify each gene’s behavior in
each dimension and compile the resulting behavior proﬁles for the entire
microarray (Fig. 1B); and (iii) to integrate the expression data with the TF
binding data by choosing potential regulatory targets for each binding site
(Fig. 1C). The ﬁnal step is to run EMBER and assign targets based on its
results (Fig. 1D). The details of the algorithm are given later in this section
and in Section 1 of the Supplementary Materials, and the outputs of the
method are described and illustrated as well.

2.1 Preparation and integration of data

We focus ﬁrst on the gene expression data, Part I of Figure 1, measured
by DNA microarray. These experiments are typically performed in series
over a variety of cellular conditions, such as a time course over treatment
with some chemical, or in wild—type and mutant cells. In our approach,
we summarize the change in each probe set’s expression over the series of
microarray conditions into a discrete space, taking into account the natural
range in expression levels for each probe set at each condition. In principle,
the expression patterns could be constructed from the behaviors of genes,
rather than probe sets. We choose to work directly with the probe sets to
avoid imposing an arbitrary combination rule when the probe sets for a gene
are divergent. For the breast cancer data that we analyze in the present article,
only one probe set per gene remained after removing low—expressed probes,
so probe sets and genes are equivalent in this case, and we use the terms
interchangeably below.

First, we deﬁne a series of behavior dimensions by considering appropriate
binary comparisons between different DNA microarray conditions. For
example, in Figure 1A if a series of experiments covered a time course after
treatment with some chemical (time 0, time 1, time 2, time 3), then three
behavior dimensions might be time 0 to 1, time 1 to 2 and time 2 to 3. The
choice of the experiments is important because including expression data
from cell states very different from the binding data can obscure the relevant
information. Relative entropy analysis of the EMBER results (Section 3.4)
gives some insight into the expression comparisons that are most relevant, but
it is ultimately the expertise of the researcher that determines the appropriate
match of binding and expression data.

Second, we discretize each probe set’s behavior in each of the above
dimensions, illustrated in Figure 1B. Since we assume that we have several
replicates for each condition, we can calculate a mean (u) and standard
deviation (0) of expression for each probe set at each condition; we denote
the means/standard deviations for the ﬁrst and second conditions of a
comparison as m /01 and Mg /02, respectively. Behaviors are then classiﬁed
in each dimension into one of ﬁve values, ++,+,0, — or ——, denoting
large upregulation, small upregulation, no change, small downregulation or
large downregulation, respectively. These are deﬁned by considering the
differences between the means, relative to the magnitudes of the sum of

Fig. 1. Schematic of the data preparation and integration steps. Part 1: DNA microarray preparation, starting with data normalized by standard procedures, for
a hypothetical series of four microarray experiments. (A) Different conditions lead to the deﬁnition of different binary behavior dimensions. (B) The behavior
of each probe set in each dimension is classiﬁed by considering the difference in mean expression levels, relative to the standard deviations (cartoon depicts
the mean as a dot, with error bars signifying :l:1 SD), as described in the text. Binding sites obtained from standard ChIP—seq or ChIP—chip alignment and
peak calling (Part II) are integrated with the gene expression data (Part III). (C) Peaks are assigned potential targets by considering all genes within 100 kb
of the binding site. In the ﬁgure, this region is given by the brackets around the peak. The orange probe sets, which lie within this region, are assigned as
potential targets, and the green probe sets are not. This results in a new data structure of integrated binding and gene expression data. (D) These data, together
with the background from (B), are used to ( 1) identify overrepresented patterns in EMBER, and the resulting expression patterns are used to (2) score probe

sets and assign regulatory targets.

the standard deviations, s=ol +02. We deﬁne a large upregulation (++)
as 3s< 11.2 —u1 (which implies 11.2 >114 as well, indicating an increase in
expression). A small upregulation (+) is s < 11.2 — m 5 3s. No change (0) is
—s§ 11.2 —u1 5s. Downregulation classiﬁcations (—— and —) are deﬁned
analogously to upregulation classiﬁcations by reversing the order of 11.2 and
11.1. This discretized behavior proﬁle facilitates detection of overrepresented
patterns. We also prefer this approach to the more common analysis of fold
change in that it incorporates our conﬁdence in the change in expression. Note
that our behavior proﬁle deﬁnition is similar in spirit to other approaches to
analyzing DNA microarray data, as this transformation allows for clustering
(Eisen et al., 1998; Gilchrist et al., 2006; MacQueen, 1967) or the deﬁnition
of modules (Bar—Joseph et al., 2003) in behavior.

We now integrate the TF binding data. We deﬁne a ‘potential regulatory
region’ (Fig. 1C) for each binding site of :l:100 kb. Any probe set whose
gene overlaps with this region is assigned as a potential target. This distance
was chosen as a compromise between including as many potential targets
as possible and maximizing signal to noise. We have found the results of
EMBER to be robust to variations in this parameter; see Section 2 and
Figure 1 of the Supplementary Materials for details. The result is a number
of potential regulatory targets for each binding site. Our problem is thus to
identify which of these are actually being regulated by binding of a particular
set of TFs.

2.2 The EMBER method

Our problem of identifying regulatory targets can be mapped onto the
common problem of identifying precise TF binding sites within binding
regions obtained from ChIP—seq or ChIP—chip experiments. In the latter
problem, the experimental method yields TF binding sites to a precision of
a couple of hundred base pairs, but the actual site is expected to be only 10—
20 bp. To identify the actual binding sites, one starts with a large number of
potential binding sites (e. g. all possible DNA 10mers from the ChIP regions)

and searches among those sites for a set of overrepresented DNA sequences
that identiﬁes the putative binding sites. The resulting collection of sequences
is called the binding motif.

Analogously, in identifying regulatory targets we assume that a given TF
regulates genes in some consistent fashion, reﬂected in the gene expression
proﬁles. Starting with a large number of potential targets (i.e. all genes in
the potential regulatory region, :l:100 kb from the peak), we search among
those genes for overrepresented behavior proﬁles. We refer to the resulting
collection of gene behavior proﬁles as the expression pattern.

There are, however, a few important differences between binding motifs
and expression patterns. The backgrounds for the two problems are quite
different: in the TF binding site identiﬁcation problem, the background comes
from the background frequency of each DNA base and is invariant over the
length of the motif. The background frequencies for A, G, T and C fall in the
range 17—33%, depending on the organism. For the gene targeting problem,
the background is much farther from uniform (generally the largest frequency
is at the ‘0’ classiﬁcation, as most genes do not have appreciably different
expression levels under comparison of two conditions). Additionally, in an
expression pattern, each comparison has a different background, based on
all the genes in the microarray.

Gene behavior proﬁles also cannot overlap, in contrast to TF binding
sites. An important consequence of this difference is that the space of possible
expression patterns is more constrained than the space of potential TF binding
sites; we have found that the converged patterns are completely independent
of the initial conditions used, which is not generally true of binding motifs.

There are a number of algorithms available to identify overrepresented
patterns, and in principle many of them could be adapted for our target
identiﬁcation problem. Here, we adapt the MM expectation maximization
algorithm of MEME (Bailey and Elkan, 1994), detailed in Section 1 of the
Supplementary Materials.

In brief, the goals of the method are (i) to separate the potential targets into
target and background genes, and (ii) to determine multinomial probability

models for the target and background genes such that the likelihood of
observing the gene behaviors under the models is maximized. The essential
parameters that are found in an expression pattern are the probabilities in
the models,  and M. Here, j=1 for the target genes and j=2 for the
background genes; 1 indexes the behavior dimensions (e. g. time 0 to time 1),
and m indexes the behavior classiﬁcations (e. g. ++).  is the probability
of observing behavior m in comparison 1 for the j—th model, and )vj is the a
priori probability of a potential target gene belonging to model j.

After the convergence of each expression pattern, targets are assigned
based on a score S(x,-):

L ++

Son-#2 Z logm,l,m/f2,l,m)6m,x,,. (1)

i=1m=——
The score of gene x,- quantiﬁes how much more the gene belongs to the
expression pattern model than the background model. A natural threshold
for assignment is T:10g(Az/Al).

In addition to determining the target genes, it is can be useful to directly
examine the log—odds scoring matrix with elements SW = [log(fl,l,m /f2,l,m)],
hereafter referred to as the score matrix. Positive values in the score matrix
represent behaviors that are overrepresented in the expression pattern, and
negative values represent behaviors that are underrepresented. One can also
compare score matrices to quantify how two expression patterns differ. This
is particularly useful when seeking to elucidate the actions of different
combinations of TFs; even if the sites, and hence the target genes, differ
signiﬁcantly, the score matrices may be quite similar, implying a similar
mode of regulation.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Data used for analysis

We demonstrate EMBER by applying it to the previously published
(Hua et al., 2008, 2009) data for the TFs ERa and RARoz and RARy
in breast cancer MCF—7 cells. ChIP—chip binding data were collected
for these three TFs, and DNA microarray data were collected at
different time points after treatments with estrogen (E2) and different
RA agonists (ATRA, which binds to both RARs; AM580, RARoz
speciﬁc; CD437, RARy speciﬁc; and a combination of AM580 and
CD437, called AM + CD). A summary of the data (including the
behavior dimensions deﬁned) is given in Supplementary Figure 2A
and B, respectively.

We prepared the data as described in Section 2. We separately
applied EMBER for all the binding sites for each TF, as well as
the binding sites in each of the seven coincident binding regions
in the Venn diagram in Supplementary Figure 2A, for a total of
10 EMBER runs (each run takes ~ 1 min; binding sites are called
coincident if the center of two ChIP—chip binding regions are within
1kb). In other applications, it could be of interest to compare the
cistrome of the same TF(s) at different time points to study how
its regulation changed with cell state. Our analysis in this section
focuses primarily on the gene targets obtained in the top expression
pattern in each run.

Using these data, we can also more clearly illustrate the target—
gene ﬁnding problem. For example, only 7.7% of all RARoz peaks
are within a promoter region (deﬁned as 2 kb from a TSS), so most
sites regulate genes through long—range enhancers. Supplementary
Figure 3 looks at the distribution of potential targets (within 100 kb)
per peak: a substantial number of peaks have at least a handful of
nearby genes, and some have as many as 29. Although it is a common
approach in these cases to assign targets by proximity, we will show
that this method can miss important information that is obtained in
EMBER.

3.2 Overrepresentation of breast cancer-related genes
in EMBER-identiﬁed targets

We ﬁrst investigated whether we could link the target genes obtained
from EMBER to the biology of ERor, RARoz and RARy. Estrogen
(E2) is involved in initiation, development and metastasis (Yager
and Davidson, 2006) of breast cancer, and RA can hinder the
proliferation of tumor cells (Liu et al., 1998; Zhou et al., 1997). Both
E2 and RA exert genomic effects through their activation of EROl,
and RARoz and RARy, respectively. Hua et al. (2009) previously
manually curated 1347 genes that are believed to be involved in
breast cancer (Supplementary Table S6 of Hua et al.), referred to
as the BC1000 genes. In all, 1156 of these genes remained after
removing the probe sets that are always expressed at a low level
and/or are without unique coordinates.

To determine whether EMBER was preferentially selecting the
BC1000 genes as targets, we compared the number of genes that
are potential targets (within 100 kb of a peak) to the number of
genes selected as regulatory targets by EMBER. For example, for
the RARoz binding sites, genes from the BC1000 list appear 2936
times as potential targets (many appear more than once, if there are
multiple nearby binding sites) and EMBER selects 1131 of these as
regulatory targets (38%). By comparison, there are 55 036 potential
targets total, of which EMBER selects 10 660 as regulatory targets
(19%). From these results, we calculate the overrepresentation of
BC1000 genes in the EMBER targets as log2(0.38/0.19)= 1.0. To
assess signiﬁcance, we deﬁne a binomial distribution by the number
of BC1000 targets we would get if each had a probability of 0.19 of
being selected as a target by EMBER. This distribution yields a P—
value for the overrepresentation of BC1000 genes of 4.9 X 10‘127.
In other words, EMBER shows a strong preference for the BC1000
genes. The overrepresentation of BC1000 genes for the 10 peak
groups is shown in Figure 2; Supplementary Table S1 reports the
P—values and targeting statistics by EMBER. Every peak set is
overrepresented for BC1000 genes.

In contrast, we consider selecting targets using the more usual
proximity method: the closest gene to each binding site (by distance
to TSS) is chosen as the target. Repeating the above analysis for
this method, we ﬁnd essentially no preference for BC1000 genes in
the targets, in stark contrast to EMBER. Given that these TFs are
widely believed to be involved in the development of breast cancer,
we expect the BC1000 genes to be targeted, as they are by EMBER
but not by proximity alone.

We examine the relationship between EMBER and proximity
in more detail in Section 3 in Supplementary Material and
Supplementary Figure S4. In short, we ﬁnd that a relationship with
proximity arises in the EMBER targets, but this association is not
strong enough to be predictive. Given that EMBER does appear
to be predictive for the BC1000 genes, we can view EMBER as
a method of limiting the false discovery rate (FDR) when looking
beyond the closest genes for targets. Moreover, EMBER provides
a well—deﬁned framework for continuously adjusting the FDR by
raising or lowering the score threshold for assignment as a target;
we discuss the effects of threshold choice further in Section 3.5.

3.3 Veriﬁcation of particular gene targets with EMBER

We also attempt to corroborate some of the key gene targets that were
hypothesized previously. Hua et al. (2009) infer a simple regulatory
network involving cross regulation of ERa with RARoz and RARy,
and regulation of F OXAI , F OS and GATA3 by these TFs. To see if
we could recapitulate these interactions, we looked for these genes
in the potential targets and EMBER targets for each peak group.
Targeting by different peak groups, along with gene scores from
EMBER, are given in Supplementary Table S2.

EMBER conﬁrms targeting of F OXAI , F OS and GATA3 by EROt,
RARoz and RARy. Examination of which genes are targeted by
which sets of TFs, as detailed in Supplementary Table S2, is also
illustrative. For instance, RARoz peaks that target F OXAI are almost
all coincident with RARy, but there are several RARy peaks not
coincident with RARoz, suggesting that RAR regulation of this gene
is primarily through RARy. In contrast, the ERoz sites are split: about
half of those associated with F OXAI , F OS or GATA3 are coincident
with both RARoz and RARy, and half are not.

We also recapitulate the regulation of ESRI by RARoz and RARy.
In this case, the regulation appears to be more RARoz—dependent:
all RARy peaks that target ESRI are coincident with an RARoz
peak. Interestingly, EMBER does not predict that ERoz regulates the
RARs. Although there are ERoz binding sites around these genes,
neither is chosen as a target. There are also RARoz and RARy
sites within 100 kb of their genes, from which one could infer
some auto—regulation, but the EMBER results again do not support
this targeting. While auto—regulation of RARA and RARG, or their
regulation by EROl, may occur in different contexts, from these
data EMBER selects two insulin—like growth factor binding protein
(IGFBP) genes as targets (IGFBP4 instead of RARA and IGBFP6
instead of RARG). Both these genes are on the BC1000 list.

3.4 Combinatorial effects of ERoz and RARoz

As mentioned in Section 2, EMBER produces not only gene targets,
but also a log—odds score matrix, S l,m, that can be used to understand
how targeted genes are behaving. In particular, it can be useful
to see how expression patterns differ for targets of different TF
combinations. For example, although peak groups [e] and [05]
are disjoint by deﬁnition, and so their list of target genes differs
signiﬁcantly, their top expression patterns are quite similar. To
quantify the similarity between two expression patterns S and

512m, we deﬁne their distance as

Fig. 3. Distance matrix between different TF binding site group score
matrices. Distances are deﬁned by Equation (2), and are between 0 and
1 by construction.

We include the denominator to normalize the sum, such that the
distance is always between 0 and 1. A distance of 1 is achieved if
the two score matrices differ in sign for every (I, m) (a distance of 0
means that they are identical).

We plot the distances between the top expression patterns of
the different peak groups in Figure 3. For the most part, the top
expression patterns are quite similar: most distances are <0.15.
However, groups [e,1/] (ERoz and RARy, not RARa) and [e,or] in
particular stand out from the others. This suggests that coincident
binding of ERa and either RARoz or RARy lead to distinct modes of
regulation. Hua et al. (2009) previously observed some differences
in regulatory effects surrounding such coincident sites, such as the
effect of RA and E2 co—treatment: looking at the nine putative target
genes (from a proximity analysis, Supplementary Fig. S6 of above
reference), they observe that the treatments had an antagonistic
effect on co—targeted genes, but not on uniquely targeted genes.
They also observed competition for some binding sites between ERoz
and RARy. Our analysis can provide more details about how those
differences manifest. We focus on the combinatorial effects of ERoz
with RARoz because there are fewer peaks in [e,)/], so the differences
in the elucidated behaviors of [e,1/] are more likely due to chance
(Section 4 in Supplementary Material and Supplementary Fig. S6).

We use the score matrix for group [ERoz] as a reference for
comparison with the score matrix for group [e,a]. A visualization
is presented in Figure 4. In analogy to the usual sequence logo
representation of TF binding motifs, color bars indicating behaviors
are scaled by how overrepresented the gene expression classiﬁcation
is, and then each behavior dimension is scaled by its relative entropy.
The relative entropy (RE) for a given behavior dimension (l) is
deﬁned by

++
REZ = Z f1,z,m10g(fi,l,m/f2,z,m) (3)
m=__

and quantiﬁes how much of the information in the expression pattern
distribution (fl 1m) can be explained by the background distribution
(fl 1, m). Thus, in Figure 4, large bars indicate highly overrepresented
behaviors in highly information—rich behavior dimensions. Note that
among the time course comparisons (ﬁrst 15 behavior dimensions)
in Figure 4, the most information—rich dimensions (tallest overall
columns) are the early time point comparisons: 0—4h for E2
treatment and 0 h (control) to 24 h for RA agonist treatment. Since
the ChIP data were taken at the equivalent of the 0 h/control context,

Fig. 4. Visualization of the score matrices for peak groups [ERoz] and [e,oz].
The values were ﬁrst scaled to be between 0 and 1, then multiplied by
the relative entropy. Down—regulated classiﬁcations (—— and —) are scaled
below the horizontal axis, and up—regulated classiﬁcations (++ and +) are
scaled above. The 0 classiﬁcation is centered around the horizontal axis.
Larger bars are over—represented classiﬁcations, and smaller bars are under—
represented. For example, in the ‘0 to 24 h’ comparison for ATRA treatment
(10th behavior dimension from the left), classiﬁcations ++ and —— are
over—represented for groups [ERoz] and [e,oz], and classiﬁcation 0 is the most
under—represented (bar height is zero, so it does not appear). The behavior
dimensions along the horizontal axis are in the same order as the list of
comparisons in supplementary Fig. 2B.

it is not surprising that these early time comparisons contain the most
useful information for distinguishing target genes.

In the [ERoz] score matrix, almost all the strongly up— and
downregulated behaviors (—— and —l——l—) are overrepresented, and
the no—change behaviors (0) are all underrepresented. The symmetry
between up— and downregulated behaviors here is striking, which
suggests that these binding sites are regulating genes in a mix of
activation and repression. A heat map of the gene behaviors for the
EMBER targets of [ERa] is shown in Supplementary Figure S7,
which provides further perspective on how this mix of up— and
downregulation is manifested among the target genes.

The score matrix for group [e,a] is qualitatively similar. Many
of the aspects that make up the quantitative differences in the
score matrix distance lend themselves to similar interpretations; for
example, the —l——l— behavior in E2: 0—4h is overrepresented by a
factor of 11 in [EROi] but by a factor of 6.6 in [e,a]. The more
substantive changes regarding behavior are in some of the low RE
dimensions. In particular, there is a loss of the symmetric behaviors
in the second two behavior dimensions of E2 treatment (4—12 h and
12—24 h) and the AM5 80 treatment (24—48 h and 48—72 h). In each of
these categories, the downregulated behaviors become dominant in
the [e,a] group. Since AM5 80 only ligates RARoz, it is ﬁtting that the
differences appear in situations where ERa or RARoz are primarily
activated. Finally, note that the expression patterns need not always
be so similar. For example, in a recent study on mouse Pro—B cells
(Mandal et al. , 2011), EMBER ﬁnds remarkably different expression
patterns for STAT5 peaks coincident versus not coincident with
H3k27me3 chromatin modiﬁcations (Fig. 7 of that reference).

Each expression pattern assigns target genes to some subset of the binding sites;
remaining sites are considered ‘non-regulatory’ in the context of that expression pattern.
For each expression pattern, we report the number of peaks and target genes (there are
still some peaks with more than one gene, based on the standard threshold T used), and
the logz bias ratio for BC1000 genes, and the corresponding P-value. For reference,
there are 9115 total ERoz peaks, for which there are 19 864 potential targets. For each
pair of expression patterns, we report the number of ‘regulatory’ peaks in common, the
number gene targets shared and the distance between the score matrices.

3.5 Discovery of multiple regulatory modes

Like the DNA motif—ﬁnding algorithm MEME, EMBER can ﬁnd
multiple expression patterns. Less overrepresented patterns are
found by using an erasing parameter as described in Section 1
of the Supplementary Materials, preventing genes that belong to a
previously found expression pattern from contributing to the model
for a subsequent expression pattern. However, it is still possible
for a previously assigned gene to get re—assigned as a target if its
behaviors match those of the new model by chance.

All the results described above use only the most overrepresented
expression pattern for each group of TF binding sites. To illustrate
the multiple expression pattern—ﬁnding property of EMBER, we
obtained the top three expression patterns from the peaks in group
[ERoz]. Comparisons between the expression patterns are shown in
Table 1, and the expression patterns are shown in Supplementary
Fig. S8. The second and third score matrices are distinctly
asymmetric, in contrast to the balance of up— and downregulation
noted in Section 3.4. The second score matrix is strongly biased
toward upregulated behaviors (mostly red), and the third toward
downregulated behaviors (mostly green).

A more quantitative analysis is provided in Table 1. We look
ﬁrst at the BC1000 log—bias ratio analysis discussed earlier for
each expression pattern. As noted above, BC1000 genes are highly
overrepresented in the targets for the ﬁrst expression pattern. In
contrast, they are highly underrepresented in the targets for the
second expression pattern (log2 ratio is —0.78, and the P—value
is 4.0x10‘23). In the third expression pattern, there is not any
signiﬁcant over— or underrepresentation. We also see the effect
of the erasing parameter on the differences between expression
patterns. Although the expression patterns share around half their
peaks [indeed, some sites may regulate multiple genes (Bresnick
and Felsenfeld, 1994; Pham et al., 1996)], the assigned target genes
are quite different (only ~ 1% shared targets between expression
Patterns 1 and 2, and expression Patterns 2 and 3), and the distance
between the score matrices is close to the maximal value of 1.

Given the differences between these three expression patterns,
the fact that any genes at all are shared may seem strange. However,
shared genes between distinctly different expression patterns tend
to be low scoring in both patterns. That is, they ﬁt the models for
the target genes only moderately well, but still better than they ﬁt
the background, so maximum likelihood comes from assigning those
genes to the target set. To illustrate this effect, we raise the threshold
[originally set at T :10g()\.2/)\.1)] used to determine which genes are
targets. Supplementary Table S4 gives the results when we multiply
the threshold by a factor of 2, 4 or 6 and repeat the analysis in
Table 1. Raising the threshold also results in fewer target genes per
peak, so the overlap of peaks decreases as well.

As the threshold increases, the number of peaks and target genes
associated with each expression pattern decreases, but the overlap
decreases much faster. For example, 58% of the expression Pattern
1 peaks are shared with expression Pattern 2 at 1T in Table 1. This
drops to 14% at a threshold of 6T (Supplementary Table S4). The
number of genes in common drops to zero by 4T. Re—examining
the breast cancer data, we ﬁnd that, as the threshold increases, the
bias ratio becomes more exaggerated but the signiﬁcance drops.
For example, going from 1T to 6T, the expression Pattern 1
bias ratio increases from 1.17 to 1.63 but the P—value increases
(i.e. signiﬁcance decreases) from 4.6 X 10‘60 to 3.0 X 10‘”.

The above examples suggest that the threshold can be used
as a continuous control over how many genes are allowed to be
considered targets. Presumably, raising the threshold corresponds to
reducing the number of false positives at the expense of more false
negatives. For the analyses presented in this work, we have used the
standard threshold T (which maximizes the likelihood) throughout,
but it clearly may be beneﬁcial for researchers to consider higher
thresholds. The choice depends on how the results will be used. For
example, if further statistical analysis is to be performed, it may be
better to use a lower threshold to retain more genes. However, if the
next step is experimental validation or testing of particular targets,
then it makes sense to start with the highest scoring genes ﬁrst. Part
of the utility of EMBER is that it provides a quantitative, systematic
framework for deciding which genes are the strongest targets.

Finally, it should be noted that not all expression patterns returned
by EMBER necessarily represent real regulatory modes, just as not
all DNA motifs discovered by an algorithm like MEME represent
actual binding sites. Given the results for ERoz described here, it is
reasonable to believe that the second expression pattern represents
a secondary regulatory mode of ERoz that is not associated with
breast cancer development. On the other hand, within our limited
analysis there is not strong evidence that the third expression pattern
is representative of an actual regulatory mode.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have presented EMBER, a method for inferring gene regulatory
targets of TF binding sites by integrating gene expression
information from DNA microarray experiments. Using a hand—
annotated set of genes involved in breast cancer, we demonstrated
that EMBER implicates the TFs ERoz, RARoz and RARy in breast
cancer development, and that assigning targets by proximity does
not. However, it is likely that further improvements could be made
to the target selection method in EMBER. For instance, a behavior
dimension selection step could be added to the method, as in
some quantitative structure—activity relationship (QSAR) methods

(So and Karplus, 1996). Alternatively, because gene behaviors will
likely be highly correlated in different behavior dimensions, it
may be helpful to consider joint distributions between behavior
dimensions in EMBER. More importantly, recent advances in
sequencing technology have greatly increased the amount and
variety of data available to researchers, and many of these data
sources are relevant to the problem of inferring TF regulation.
Possible additional sources of data include ChIP—seq of histone
modiﬁcations, which correspond to different types of regulatory
activity (Barski et al., 2007; Bernstein et al., 2005; Birney et al.,
2007; Ernst et al., 2011; Guenther et al., 2007; Heintzman et al.,
2007, 2009; Mikkelsen et al., 2007); chromosome conformation
capture, which measures which segments of DNA are in close
spatial contact with one another (Dekker et al., 2002; Dostie and
Dekker, 2007); and global run—on and sequencing (GRO—seq),
which directly measures transcriptional activity genome—wide (Hah
et al., 2011). Although we have not made use of any of the above
data types, they could be used pre—EMBER to curate the potential
regulatory targets or post—EMBER to conﬁrm the regulatory
predictions. It may be possible to incorporate information from
these methods into EMBER itself by using them analogously
to either the TF binding sites or the expression levels. These
possibilities will be investigated in the future.

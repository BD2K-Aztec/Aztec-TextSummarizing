ABSTRACT

Summary: Finding significant differences between the expression
levels of genes or proteins across diverse biological conditions is
one of the primary goals in the analysis of functional genomics data.
However, existing methods for identifying differentially expressed
genes or sets of genes by comparing measures of the average
expression across predefined sample groups do not detect
differential variance in the expression levels across genes in
cellular pathways. Since corresponding pathway deregulations occur
frequently in microarray gene or protein expression data, we present
a new dedicated web application, PathVar, to analyze these data
sources. The software ranks pathway-representing gene/protein sets
in terms of the differences of the variance in the within-pathway
expression levels across different biological conditions. Apart from
identifying new pathway deregulation patterns, the tool exploits these
patterns by combining different machine learning methods to find
clusters of similar samples and build sample classification models.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the search for new diagnostic biomarkers, one of the ﬁrst
steps is often the identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant differences in the
expression levels of genes or proteins across different biological
conditions. Commonly used statistical methods for this purpose
quantify the extent and signiﬁcance of changes in measures of
the average expression levels of single genes/proteins [see for
example Smyth (2004); Tusher et al. (2001)] or analyze aggregated
data for gene/protein sets representing entire cellular pathways
and processes (Glaab et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2005; Lee et al.,
2008). However, since these approaches compare measures of
averaged expression levels, they cannot study how the variance of
expression levels across the genes/proteins of a cellular pathway
(termed ‘pathway expression variance’ here) changes under different
biological conditions. In this article, we present a web application
for microarray data analysis to identify and prioritize pathways
with changes in the pathway expression variance across samples
(unsupervised setting) or predeﬁned sample groups (supervised

setting). In particular, we show example cases on cancer data in
which signiﬁcant pathway deregulations manifest themselves in
terms of changes in the variance of gene/protein expression levels
in pathways, while no signiﬁcant changes can be detected in the
median pathway expression levels (see section ‘Results on Cancer
Microarray Data’ and Fig. 1). Finally, we discuss how the software
enables automated sample clustering and classiﬁcation using the
extracted pathway expression variances.

2 WORKFLOW AND METHODS

PathVar identiﬁes and analyzes deregulation patterns in pathway expression
using two possible analysis modes, a supervised and an unsupervised mode,
chosen automatically depending on the availability of sample class labels.
In the ﬁrst step, the user uploads a pre—normalized, tab—delimited
microarray dataset and chooses an annotation database to map genes/proteins
onto cellular pathways and processes (see Section 4). Next, in the supervised
analysis mode, the software computes two gene/protein set rankings in
terms of differential pathway expression variance using a parametric
T —test and a non—parametric Mann—Whitney U —test (or respectively, an
F —test and Kruskal—Wallis test for multi—class data). Alternatively, in the
unsupervised analysis mode, three feature rankings are obtained from the
pathway expression variance matrix (rows =pathways, columns 2 samples)
by computing the absolute variances across the columns/samples, the
magnitude of the loadings in a sparse principal component analysis

(Zou and Hastie, 2008) and a recently proposed entropy score (Varshavsky
et al., 2006). These rankings are combined by computing the sum of
ranks across the three methods and normalizing the sum—of—ranks scores by
dividing by the maximum possible score. The resulting sortable ranking table
of pathways contains the test statistics and signiﬁcance scores, the number
and identiﬁers of the mapped genes/proteins, and buttons to generate box
plots for each pathway and forward the genes/proteins to other bioscientiﬁc
web services for further analysis. Moreover, a heat—map visualization of the
expression level variances is provided as output.

In the next step, the user can forward the extracted pathway variance
data to a clustering module, for identifying sample groups with similar
expression variance across multiple pathways, or to a classiﬁcation module
(for labelled data), to build models for sample classiﬁcation. The clustering
module provides a selection of four hierarchical clustering algorithms,
three partition—based approaches and one consensus clustering approach
to combine the results of the individual methods see Glaab et al. (2009)
and Supplementary Material. In order to compare the outcome for different
clustering approaches and identify a number of clusters that is optimal
in terms of cluster compactness and separation between the clusters, ﬁve
validity indices are computed and aggregated by computing the sum of
validity score ranks across all methods and numbers of clusters. Moreover,
the clustering results are visualized using both 2D plots (cluster validity
score plots, principal component plots, dendrograms and silhouette plots)
and interactive 3D visualizations using dimensionality reduction methods
(Supplementary Material).

For a supervised analysis of the data, the classiﬁcation module contains six
diverse feature selection methods and six prediction algorithms, which can
be combined freely by the user [see Glaab et al. (2009) and Supplementary
Material]. To estimate the accuracy of the generated classiﬁcation models,
the available evaluation schemes include an external n—fold cross—validation
as well as user—deﬁned training/test set partitions. In addition to the average
prediction accuracy and SD obtained from these evaluation methods, several
other performance statistics like the sensitivity and speciﬁcity, and Cohen’s
Kappa statistic are computed. Additionally, a Z—score estimate of each gene
set’s utility for sample classiﬁcation is determined from the frequency of its
selection across different cross—validation cycles, and a heat map is generated
to visualize the expression variance for the most informative gene sets. All
machine learning technique implementations stem from a fully automated
data analysis framework Glaab et al. (2009), which has previously been
employed in variety of bioscientiﬁc studies (Bassel et al., 2011; Glaab et al.,
2010; Habashy et al., 2011).

To alleviate statistical limitations resulting from incomplete mappings of
genes/proteins onto pathways and from multiple hypothesis testing, only
pathways with a minimum of 10 mapped identiﬁers are considered in all
analyses and p—values are adjusted according to Benjamini and Hochberg
(1995) (see section on limitations in the Supplementary Material for details
and advice).

3 RESULTS ON CANCER MICROARRAY DATA

The microarray prostate cancer dataset by Singh et al. (2002), containing 52
tumor samples and 50 healthy control samples, is a typical example for a
cancer—related high—throughput dataset with gene expression deregulations
across many cellular pathways. When analyzing this data using both a
comparison of median gene expression levels in KEGG pathways across
the sample classes, and a comparison of the expression level variances
with PathVar, the top—ranked pathway in terms of differential expression
variance, Urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups (hsa00220), showed
a signiﬁcant increase of the variance in the tumor samples (see Fig. 1,
right; adjusted P—value: 2.2e—06). Interestingly, a conventional comparison
of the corresponding median gene expression levels does not identify
statistically signiﬁcant differences between the sample groups (Fig. 1, left).
Similar results were obtained for other cancer—associated KEGG pathways,
including the angiogenesis—related VEGF signaling pathway (hsa04370)
and the inﬂammation—related Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity

(hsa04650) process. Corresponding statistics and box plots are provided in
the Supplementary Material, which also contains results from the clustering
module and the classiﬁcation module, similar outputs for a further microarray
study, as well as details on the used data and normalization procedures. In
summary, PathVar identiﬁes statistically signiﬁcant pathway deregulations,
different from those detected by methods for comparing averaged expression
levels, and provides pathway—based clustering and classiﬁcation models that
enable a new interpretation of microarray data.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

All data analysis procedures were implemented in the R statistical
programming language and made accessible via a web interface written
in PHP on an Apache web server. Gene and protein sets representing
cellular pathways and processes were retrieved from the databases KEGG
(Kanehisa et al., 2008), BioCarta (Nishimura, 2001), Reactome (Joshi—Tope
et al., 2005), NCI Pathway Interaction Database (Schaefer et al., 2009),
WikiPathways (Pico et al., 2008), InterPro (preiler et al., 2001) and Gene
Ontology [GOSlim, Ashbumer et al. (2000)] and will be updated on a regular
basis. A detailed tutorial for the software is provided on the web page.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Admixed populations offer a unique opportunity
for mapping diseases that have large disease allele frequency
differences between ancestral populations. However, association
analysis in such populations is challenging because population
stratification may lead to association with loci unlinked to the disease
locus.

Methods and results: We show that local ancestry at a test
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may confound with the
association signal and ignoring it can lead to spurious association.
We demonstrate theoretically that adjustment for local ancestry at the
test SNP is sufficient to remove the spurious association regardless
of the mechanism of population stratification, whether due to local or
global ancestry differences among study subjects; however, global
ancestry adjustment procedures may not be effective. We further
develop two novel association tests that adjust for local ancestry.
Our first test is based on a conditional likelihood framework which
models the distribution of the test SNP given disease status and
flanking marker genotypes. A key advantage of this test lies in
its ability to incorporate different directions of association in the
ancestral populations. Our second test, which is computationally
simpler, is based on logistic regression, with adjustment for local
ancestry proportion. We conducted extensive simulations and found
that the Type I error rates of our tests are under control; however,
the global adjustment procedures yielded inflated Type I error rates
when stratification is due to local ancestry difference.

1 INTRODUCTION

African Americans and Hispanic Americans represent the two
largest racial minority groups in the USA, comprising ~28% of

the US population. Both groups are recently admixed and have
inherited ancestry from more than one ancestral population. Such
admixed populations offer a unique opportunity for mapping disease
genes that have large allele frequency differences between ancestral
populations. Recently, admixture mapping has become one of the
main approaches for gene mapping studies in admixed populations
(Hoggart et al., 2004; McKeigue, 1998; Montana and Pritchard,
2004; Patterson et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2004).
However, traditional admixture mapping has a substantially lower
resolution than association analysis (Smith et al., 2005; Zhu et al.,
2008). Moreover, admixture mapping cannot identify disease loci
that have similar allele frequencies or disease prevalences in the
ancestral populations.

With the increasing availability of large volumes of high-density
SNP genotyping data generated in genome-wide association studies
(GWAS), the analysis of admixed populations is now moving
toward SNP association. In admixed populations, the proportion of
admixture may vary across individuals. This variation can lead to
associations of the disease with loci unlinked to the disease locus,
a phenomenon well known as ‘population stratiﬁcation’, which can
produce both false-positive and false-negative association signals if
not appropriately controlled.

Over the past decade, various methods have been developed
to deal with this population stratiﬁcation effect (Price et al.,
2010; Sillanpaa, 2010). In general, these methods can be classiﬁed
into three categories: (i) genomic control (Devlin et al., 1999),
(ii) structured association (Pritchard et al., 2000; Satten et al.,
2001) and (iii) principal components-based methods (Epstein et al.,
2007; Li et al., 2010; Price et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2003; Zhu
et al., 2002). The genomic control approach attempts to correct
for population stratiﬁcation by adjusting association statistics with
a single overall inﬂation factor obtained from a set of random
markers that are not associated with the phenotype of interest. In
contrast, structured association methods assign the study subjects to
estimated discrete subpopulations and then aggregates evidence of
association within each subpopulation. The current state-of-the-art
approach is the principal component-based approach implemented
in EIGENSTRAT (Price et al., 2006), which computes coefﬁcients
of principal components using SNPs across the genome to control
for population structure.

Adjustment for local ancestry in genetic association analysis

 

The central idea of all the above-mentioned methods is to use
markers across the genome to capture the global population structure
within the study subjects. Variation in global population structure
is driven mainly by demographic histories such as migration and
genetic random drift. However, for admixed populations, a person’s
genome is a mosaic of ancestral chromosomes. This introduces
considerable amount of variation in local ancestry at certain genomic
regions, and the local ancestry may have little correlation with
global ancestry. Local ancestry has been useful in localizing disease
susceptibility genes in admixture mapping studies (Hoggart et al.,
2004; McKeigue, 1998; Montana and Pritchard, 2004; Patterson
et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2004). In this article, we
show that local ancestry may confound with the association signal
at the test SNP, and if ignored, can lead to spurious association in
genetic association analysis. Methods that adjust for global ancestry
may fail to remove this spurious association because the global
ancestry information obtained from all markers across the genome
may not accurately reﬂect the amount of ancestry variation in local
regions.

There are two types of mechanisms that may lead to population
stratiﬁcation: (i) stratiﬁcation due to local ancestry difference driven
by natural selection at certain genomic regions and (ii) stratiﬁcation
due to global ancestry difference driven by the demographic history
of a population or genetic random drift due to ﬁnite population
size. The existing methods for population stratiﬁcation correction
are appropriate when the stratiﬁcation is due to global ancestry
difference; however, they may be ineffective in removing the
effect of population stratiﬁcation when the stratiﬁcation is induced
by natural selection that occurs only in certain genomic regions.
Population stratiﬁcation due to natural selection is not uncommon.
A well-known example is the lactase gene, which has been shown
to be under recent positive selection (Bersaglieri et al., 2004). Since
both the lactase gene ancestry and height track with northwest versus
southeast European ancestry, nai've association analysis between the
lactase gene and height will lead to a spurious association (Campbell
et al., 2005). Another example of recent natural selection was
reported in admixed Puerto Ricans (Tang et al., 2007). In this study,
three chromosomal regions, including the human leukocyte antigen
region on 6p, 8q and 11q, were reported to exhibit deﬁciencies in the
European-ancestry proportion as compared with the genome-wide
European-ancestry. With the increased evidence of recent positive
selection in many regions of the genome (Pickrell et al., 2009;
Voight et al., 2006), we anticipate that unrecognized population
stratiﬁcation due to natural selection might be present for many
other phenotypes.

In the Appendix (Supplementary Material), we show theoretically
that to remove the confounding effect of local ancestry, it is sufﬁcient
to condition on local ancestry at the test SNP, whereas conditioning
on global ancestry may be ineffective. To our knowledge, it is the
ﬁrst time that local ancestry adjustment is shown to be sufﬁcient
in eliminating spurious association in the analysis of admixed
populations. We further present two novel association tests that
correct for population stratiﬁcation by adjusting for local ancestry
at the test SNP. Our ﬁrst test is a likelihood ratio test (denoted
by LRT), which is based on a conditional likelihood framework
which models the distribution of a test SNP given disease status and
genotypes of ﬂanking markers. This conditional likelihood allows us
to model local ancestry difference among study subjects explicitly
and thus eliminates the effect of population stratiﬁcation at the test

SNP. A key advantage of this test lies in its ability to incorporate
different directions of association in the ancestral populations, a
‘ﬂip—ﬂop’ phenomenon due to either population differences in allele
frequencies, or to multi—locus effects and variation in inter-locus
correlations (Lin et al., 2007). Our second test, denoted as Logistic-
Local, is based on a simple logistic regression in which the test
SNP is a predictor and the estimated local ancestry proportion at
the test SNP is included as a covariate in the analysis. Compared
with the ﬁrst test, this test imposes additional assumptions on the
disease risk model but is computationally simpler. Our procedures
are developed as general tests of genetic association for admixed
populations and can be applied in the GWAS setting. In contrast to a
requirement in admixture mapping, neither of our tests requires the
allele frequencies or the disease prevalences to be different in the
ancestral populations, and thus they can identify disease loci that
may be missed by admixture mapping.

We conducted extensive simulations to evaluate the performance
of the proposed tests. Our results indicate that regardless of the
mechanism of population stratiﬁcation—whether due to local or
global ancestry differences—the Type I error rates of our procedures
were always under control; however, global ancestry adjustment
procedures such as EIGENSTRAT (Price et al., 2006) may fail to
control Type I error rates when population stratiﬁcation is due to
local ancestry differences.

2 METHODS
2.1 Notation

We assume that admixture has occurred between two ancestral populations,
denoted by X and Y, in a recently admixed population. Assume a set of
markers with known genetic locations is available for estimating ancestry.
Consider a test SNP with alleles A and a (with frequencies pX, qX and pY,
qY, in populations X and Y, respectively). Let It be the probability that a
randomly selected allele at the test SNP comes from population X. For each
individual, let Z be the disease status (1 = affected; 0 = unaffected), [SNP (= 0,
1, 2) denote the number of alleles at the test SNP that come from population
X, GSNP (= 0, 1, 2) denote the number of allele A at the test SNP and GANG
denote the ﬂanking marker genotypes that are used to infer the local ancestry
at the test SNP.

2.2 Confounding due to local ancestry

We now show that local ancestry at the test SNP can confound with the
association signal in genetic association analysis. The local ancestry at the
test SNP can be considered as a ‘diallelic marker’ with alleles ‘X’ and
‘Y’. There are four marker-ancestry haplotypes, AX, aX, AY and aY, with
respective frequencies

P(AX)=P(A|X)P(X)=PX7T,
P(aX)=P(aIX)P(X)=qX n,
P(AY)=P(A|Y)P(Y)=PY(1-7r),
P(aY)=P(a|Y)P(Y)=qY(1—7r).

Based on these haplotype frequencies, we can calculate the square of the
correlation coefﬁcient between the test SNP and the local ancestry as

7T(1-7T)(PX —PY)2
[Pxﬂ+py(1—7r)][qX7r+qY(1—7r)] '

Therefore, r2 = 0 when 7r 2 0 or 1, orpX =pY and r2 > 0 when 0 < 7r <1 and
pX #pY. In an admixed population, It is always between 0 and 1. Thus, there
is linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the test SNP and the local ancestry
at the SNP as long as the allele frequencies are different in the two ancestral
populations. In this situation, if the local ancestry is correlated with disease

r2(SNP, ancestry) =

risk, the test SNP will appear to be disease associated, even when the SNP
is not close to the disease locus.

To help understand this phenomenon, consider a typical admixture
mapping scan with unrelated cases and controls. In the traditional admixture
mapping analysis, one may identify a region that shows association evidence
between a local ancestry estimate and disease status; however, due to the
shared ancestry among many markers, this region may extend over several
megabases. For a marker that falls in the region, the local ancestry at the
marker will correlate with both the marker (due to the marker-ancestry
LD described above) and the disease status (due to the admixture mapping
signal). However, most markers in the region will be far from the disease-
causing variant and will not be in LD with the variant in any of the ancestral
populations. Na‘1‘vely testing for association between a marker and disease
status while ignoring the confounding effect due to the local ancestry may
lead to a spurious association. Below we describe statistical procedures
that can remove this confounding effect. In the Appendix (Supplementary
Material), we show that such local ancestry adjustment is sufﬁcient and that
adjustment for global ancestry may not be enough. Our tests do not require
the disease allele frequencies or the disease prevalences to be different in the
ancestral populations.

2.3 Conditional likelihood for unrelated cases and
controls

The conditional likelihood of GSNP, the genotype at the test SNP, given

disease status Z and ﬂanking marker genotypes GANC, is

P(GSNPZIGANC)
P(GSNPIZ, GANG) = —

P(ZIGANC)
1 2
= — P(GSNPZJSNPIGANC) (1)
P (Z | GANC) [SEQ

= — P (Z |GSNPJSNP)P(GSNPIISNP)P(ISNPIGANC),
P (Z | GANC) [SEQ
where

P(ZIGANC)= Z Z P(ZGSNPJSNPIGANC)
ISNP=0GSNP=0

(2)

2 2
= Z Z P (Z IGSNP,ISNP)P(GSNP|ISNP)P(ISNP|GANG)-
ISNP=0GSNP=0

Given a set of unrelated cases and controls, the overall likelihood of
the observed data is L=HP(GSNPIZ,GANC), where the product is taken
over all individuals. To estimate the expression in (1) and (2), we need
to estimate: (i) P(ZIGSNP, ISNP), the probability that an individual is
affected or unaffected given his genotype and ancestry state at the test SNP,
(ii) P(GSNplISNp), the genotype frequency given the ancestry state at the test
SNP and (iii) P(ISNPIGANC), the probability of ancestry state at the test SNP
given ﬂanking marker genotypes. Below we describe how to estimate each
of the three probabilities.

2.4 Model for disease risk

To calculate P(Z IGSNP, ISNP), we need to have a model that relates disease
risk to the SNP genotype and the underlying latent ancestry state. It is
generally believed that disease risks are the same in the ancestral populations
at the true disease locus (Kaplan et al., 1998). However, in genetic association
studies, it is more likely that the test SNP is not the true disease locus but
instead is in LD with it. Since the degrees of LD may differ in the ancestral
populations, the penetrances manifested at the test SNP may be different.
Therefore, two sets of penetrances are needed to reﬂect the fact that the
probability of being affected depends not only on the individual’s genotype
at the test SNP but also on the underlying ancestry state. Taking this into

consideration, we propose to model the penetrances at the test SNP as shown
in Table 1.

Here (fox, fLX, f2,X) and (fay, fly, fly) denote the penetrances of
genotypes aa, Aa and AA in ancestral populations X and Y, respectively.
For individuals carrying one allele from population X and one allele from
population Y, we allow the ancestry risk (deﬁned as the risk of having disease
due to ancestry state at the test SNP) to be additive, recessive or dominant
(Table 1). We note that imposing different penetrances in different ancestral
populations has been previously considered by Pritchard et al. (2000). The
key advantage of using two sets of penetrances is that this allows us to
incorporate different directions of association in the ancestral populations,
a ‘ﬂip-ﬂop’ phenomenon due either to population differences or multi-locus
effects and variation in inter-locus correlations (Lin et al., 2007).

2.5 Genotype frequencies given local ancestry state

Assuming Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in both ancestral
populations, the genotype frequencies at the test SNP can be easily calculated.
For example, when [SNP = 2, i.e. both alleles come from population X, the
frequency for genotype cm is q? Table 2 shows the genotype frequencies for
all three scenarios of [SNP (Table 2).

2.6 Estimation of ancestry state at the test SNP

The conditional probability distribution of the ancestry state at the test
SNP given ﬂanking marker genotypes can be obtained from external
programs. Several software packages are available for estimating local
ancestry, including ANCESTRYMAP (Patterson et al., 2004), MALDSOFT
(Montana and Pritchard, 2004), ADMIXPROGRAM (Zhu et al., 2006),
SABER (Tang et al., 2006), LAMP (Sankararaman et al., 2008), HAPAA
(Sundquist et al., 2008) and HAPMIX (Price et al., 2009). The choice of
which program to use will depend on the nature of the data. For studies
where the ﬂanking markers are not densely spaced, programs such as
ANCESTRYMAP and ADMIXPROGRAM would be sufﬁcient. For markers
from GWAS, programs such as SABER, HAPAA, LAMP and HAPMIX
would be more appropriate. The current state-of—the-art method is HAPMIX,
which for GWAS data can yield an estimated ancestry that has as high as
98% correlation with the true ancestry (Price et al., 2009).

2.7 Tests of association

With the previously developed likelihood framework, we can evaluate
whether the test SNP is associated with the disease of interest. Under the
null hypothesis that the test SNP is not associated with the disease, the

Adjustment for local ancestry in genetic association analysis

 

penetrances at the test SNP should be the same for different SNP genotypes
for both populations X and Y. This indicates that we can test for association
by testing H0: fox =f1,X =f2,X and f0,Y =f1,y =f2,y. Our method requires
parameter estimation, including {pX , pY ,f0,X, f1,X,f2,X, f0,Y,f1,Y, fly }. When
only case—control data are available, these parameters are not all identiﬁable.
To estimate these parameters, we therefore need to add parameter constraints.
We choose to ﬁx the disease prevalences in the ancestral populations, as they
can often be obtained from external sources. Similar strategies have been
employed elsewhere (Zollner et al., 2007). To maximize the likelihood, we
use a simplex algorithm (Nelder et al., 1965), an optimization method that
does not require calculation of derivatives. To address the issue of local
maxima, we try multiple sets of starting values so that the procedure will
converge to the point of maximum likelihood.

To assess the evidence of association, we propose to use a likelihood
ratio test, LRT=2[log(f.1)—log(f.0)], where L1 and L0 are the likelihood
maximized under the general and null models, respectively. Under the null
hypothesis of no association, LRT is asymptotically distributed as a x2 with
four degrees of freedom (d.f.). We could further reduce the d.f. by assuming
a more restrictive risk model (e. g. additive, dominant or recessive) for the
SNP genotype in the two ancestral populations. For example, with an additive
model, we have the constraints 2f1,X =f0,X +f2,X and 2f1,y =f0,y +f2,y on
the parameters, and the corresponding test statistic will have two d.f.

The above procedure explicitly models the ancestry penetrances at the test
SNP. An alternative and simpler approach is to conduct a logistic regression

logit[P(Z =1|GSNP,P"0PSNP)] = ,30 + :31 1{GSNP=1}

+ ,32 1{G5Np=2} + ,33PVOPSNP,

where propSNP = 0.5P(ISNP = 1|GANC) +P(ISNp 2 2| GANC) is the local
ancestry proportion at the test SNP. Association with the SNP can be assessed
by testing H0:,81=,82 :0 using a two d.f. likelihood ratio test. We denote
this test as ‘Logistic-Local’. This approach assumes that the ancestry risk is
additive on the logit scale and the direction of SNP association is the same
irrespective of ancestry, and thus may not be as ﬂexible as the LRT approach
proposed earlier; however, it may be more powerful than the LRT approach
due to its reduced number of d.f.

We note that neither of our tests requires the disease allele frequencies or
disease prevalences to be different in the ancestral populations. Therefore
they are able to identify signals that can be missed by the traditional
admixture mapping approach. In the Appendix (Supplementary Material), we
show that local ancestry adjustment is sufﬁcient for controlling for population
stratiﬁcation in case—control data, whereas spurious association may occur
with an adjustment only for global ancestry.

2.8 Simulation setup

To evaluate the performance of the proposed tests, we conducted extensive
simulations. The allele frequencies of the 2774 ancestry informative markers
(AIMS) in Smith et al. (2004) were used as marker allele frequencies in X
and Y, respectively. We assumed HWE and linkage equilibrium between
adjacent AIMs in each population. Samples were simulated according to the
continuous gene ﬂow model. In brief, in Generation 0, the marker genotypes
for the AIMs of 50 000 unrelated individuals in population X were simulated.
An admixed population was generated by forming inter-population marriages
in subsequent generations. Speciﬁcally, in each generation, we took a
proportion A randomly selected individuals to marry individuals generated
according to the marker allele frequencies in population Y, and let the
remaining proportion, 1— A, mate randomly among themselves. The number
of children in each marriage was assumed to follow a Poisson distribution
with mean size two. The number of crossovers between two adjacent markers
was determined by the genetic distance between them. This process was
repeated six times to reach the current generation. We chose the value of
A such that an average individual in the current generation has ~80% X
ancestry and 20% Y ancestry, similar to that in African Americans.

To evaluate Type I error rates, we considered two mechanisms of
population stratiﬁcation: (i) stratiﬁcation due to local ancestry difference at

the test SNP between cases and controls and (ii) stratiﬁcation due to global
ancestry difference between cases and controls. In the ﬁrst scenario, the true
disease variant and the test SNP may be in the same region with shared
ancestry but they are far from each other. When stratiﬁcation was due to
local ancestry difference, the case—control status was assigned according
to the local ancestry state. Speciﬁcally, for individuals with two copies of
population X alleles, the probability of being affected was 0.3; for individuals
with two copies of population Y alleles, the probability of being affected was
0.1; for individuals with one copy of population X allele and one copy of
population Y allele, the probability of being affected was either 0.2 (additive
ancestry risk), 0.1 (recessive ancestry risk) or 0.3 (dominant ancestry risk).
When stratiﬁcation was due to global ancestry difference, the probability of
being affected was equal to the global ancestry proportion of the individual,
calculated as the average of the ancestry proportions across all markers in
the genome. For power evaluation, we simulated case—control data following
disease models speciﬁed in Table 7. As noted earlier, an advantage of our
tests is that they do not require the disease allele frequencies or disease
prevalences to be different in the ancestral populations. To evaluate the
performance of our tests in this setting, we simulated data assuming the
disease allele frequency was 0.4, disease prevalence was 0.3, and genotype
relative risk (GRR) was 1.2 in both ancestral populations.

Type I error rates were estimated based on 10000 replicate datasets,
and power was estimated based on 1000 replicates. Each replicate dataset
consisted of 1000 unrelated cases and 1000 unrelated controls. We analyzed
each simulated dataset using the following tests: (i) LRT, (ii) Logistic-
Local, (iii) Logistic-Global, a logistic regression procedure with the global
ancestry proportion (calculated as the average of local ancestry proportions
across all markers in the genome) as a covariate and (iv) EIGENSTRAT.
We assumed additive model for the test SNP genotype in all tests. For the
LRT approach, we conducted the test assuming the ancestry risk model is
additive, dominant or recessive. For EIGENSTRAT, we included the ﬁrst 10
principal components in the analysis.

2.9 Simulation of a synthetic GWAS dataset

To test the performance of our tests in GWAS settings, we simulated a
synthetic GWAS dataset based on ancestry characteristics in the Maywood
study (Kang et al., 2010). In this study, 701 unrelated African Americans
were collected from Maywood, IL, USA. All study subjects were genotyped
using Affymetrix 6.0 SNP array. Due to its small sample size and the lack
of disease phenotypes, the Maywood dataset is not appropriate for testing
the performance of different tests. However, we can use it to simulate
GWAS dataset with realistic admixture patterns. Speciﬁcally, we used
ADMIXPROGRAM (Zhu et al., 2006) to infer each individual’s ancestry
using 2606 selected ancestry informative SNPs and obtained the distribution
of ancestry proportion. Based on this distribution, we then simulated
an admixed population with average 20% Caucasian and 80% African
ancestries. For each individual with average ancestry proportion w,- (sampled
from the ancestry distribution estimated from Maywood), we simulated SNP
genotypes for 22 autosomal chromosomes using data generated by HapMap,
which includes 1969 739 SNPs with complete haplotype information for
CEU (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe)
and YRI (Yruba in Ibadan, Nigeria) samples. For each chromosome, we
simulated the number of crossover points s from a Poisson distribution with
mean ,u :1 x gx 10‘7, where l is the length of the chromosome, g is the
generation since the individual began admixture and was randomly sampled
from 1 to 10. We then randomly sampled haplotype segments from CEU
or YRI haplotypes between two crossovers independently according to the
average ancestry proportion. Next, we introduced selection to a 5 Mb region
centered at rs6576848 (87 053 359 bp) on Chromosome 1 by simulating
haplotype segments with 40% Caucasian ancestry and 60% African ancestry.
The size of the selection region is similar to that reported by Tang et al.
(2007). Similar simulation strategies have been employed by Qin et al.
(2010). We assigned disease status according to local ancestry at rs6576848:
the probabilities of being affected are 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, if the

numbers of YRI alleles at rs6576848 are 0, 1 and 2. Applying this simulation
procedure, we simulated 1000 cases and 1000 controls. We then thinned
the data to Affymetrix 6.0 SNP density, leaving ~800 000 autosomal SNPs
in the analysis. In this simulated dataset, there is no allelic association
between any SNPs and the disease status. The association between the
SNPs and disease status is simply induced by shared ancestry due to natural
selection.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Comparison of Type I error rates

Table 3 shows the estimated Type I error rates of different tests
when population stratiﬁcation is due to local ancestry difference at
the test SNP between cases and controls. Not surprisingly, tests that
adjust for global ancestry cannot effectively remove the effect of
population stratiﬁcation. For example, when the allele frequencies
in populations X and Y were 0.4 and 0.2 and the ancestry risk
model was additive, the Type I error rates of Logistic-Global and
EIGENSTRAT were 12.44 and 7.62%, respectively. This Type I
error rate inﬂation increased further when the allele frequency
difference between populations X and Y was increased. In contrast,
the Type I error rates of the LRT and Logistic-Local approaches
were under control. In particular, for the LRT approach, its Type I
error rates were less than the nominal level even when the ancestry
risk model was misspeciﬁed in the analysis. When population
stratiﬁcation was due to global ancestry difference among study
subjects, the Type I error rates of all tests were under control
(Table 4). Our results indicate that regardless of the mechanism

of population stratiﬁcation, whether due to local or global ancestry
differences, it is sufﬁcient to adjust for local ancestry at the test
SNP. This is consistent with the theoretical result in the Appendix
(Supplementary Material). However, global adjustment procedures
such as Logistic-Global and EIGENSTRAT may fail to control Type
I error rates when population stratiﬁcation is due to local ancestry
difference. To investigate this further, we calculated the correlation
coefﬁcient between global ancestry and the local ancestry at the
test SNP, and found the degree of correlation is generally <0.3.
This explains why global ancestry adjustment may fail to control
population stratiﬁcation that is due to local but not global ancestry.

In the above simulations, we assumed the ancestry state at
the test SNP was known. We also assessed the performance
of our tests when there is uncertainty in ancestry probability
estimation. Ideally, one should use programs such as HAPMIX
to estimate ancestry probabilities. However, these programs are
computationally intensive and it is not feasible to run these programs
on all simulated datasets. To circumvent this difﬁculty, we added
uncertainties to the ancestry states according to the error model
speciﬁed in Table 5, which creates similar patterns and magnitude
of uncertainty as those in the estimated ancestry from HAPMIX
and LAMP based on our analysis of testing datasets. In our error
model, we set the uncertainty parameter for population X to be
less than that for population Y. The rationale is that for the data
we simulated (mimicking African Americans), 80% of the genome
came from population X and only 20% came from population Y.
Thus, the effective sample size for population X was larger, and
this led to more accurate ancestry probability estimates than for
population Y. Table 6 shows the Type I error rates of the LRT and
Logistic-Local approaches when there are uncertainties in ancestry
estimation. Our results indicate that the Logistic-Local approach is
robust to uncertainties in ancestry estimation. Its Type I error rates
were below the nominal level under all the settings we considered.
For the LRT approach, its Type I error rates were under control
when assuming additive or dominant model for the ancestry risk,
and slightly inﬂated when the assumed ancestry risk model was
recessive and the degree of uncertainty was high. We note that when
GWAS data are available, with the current state-of—the-art program
such as HAPMIX, ancestry probabilities can be reliably estimated
for an admixed population such as African American population.
Therefore, we anticipate that the amount of uncertainty in practical
GWAS may not be a concern.

3.2 Comparison of power

Next, we compared the power of the LRT and Logistic-Local
approaches using data simulated under disease models speciﬁed
in Table 7. We did not compare with the Logistic-Global and
EIGENSTRAT approaches as they have inﬂated Type I error
rates when local ancestry is the main factor for stratiﬁcation. We
considered three scenarios for power evaluation: (i) the test SNP
was associated with the disease in the same direction in populations
X and Y (GRRX = 1.2, GRRY = 1.1), (ii) the test SNP was associated
with the disease only in population X (GRRX =1.2, GRRY :10)
and (iii) the test SNP was associated with the disease in opposite
directions in populations X and Y (GRRX = 1.2, GRRY = 0.7). Table 7
shows the power comparison results. For the ﬁrst two scenarios,
the power of the Logistic-Local approach was slightly higher than
LRT, especially when the true ancestry risk model was additive
or dominant. However, when the test SNP was associated with
the disease in opposite directions in the ancestral populations, the
power of the Logistic-Local approach can be substantially lower
than LRT. For example, in the third scenario, the power of the LRT
approach assuming recessive ancestry risk was 96.8% when the true
ancestry risk model was recessive, but the power of the Logistic-
Local approach was only 14.8%. The power of the LRT approach can
be higher than Logistic-Local even when the ancestry risk model is

misspeciﬁed. Such a signiﬁcant drop in power for the Logistic-Local
approach is due to: (i) its inherent assumption on the additivity of the
ancestry risk on the logit scale and (ii) its inability to model opposite
directions of association in the ancestral populations. The power of
this test can be greatly attenuated when these assumptions are not
satisﬁed. In contrast, the LRT approach uses two sets of penetrances
to model disease risk for the two ancestral populations, and thus is
more ﬂexible.

For the situation where the disease allele frequency and
disease prevalence are equal in the two ancestral populations, we
compared the power of the LRT and Logistic-Local approaches
with the traditional admixture mapping method, which tests for the
correlation between disease status and local ancestry proportion at
the test SNP. When the disease allele frequency was 0.4, disease
prevalence was 0.3 and GR was 1.2 in both ancestral populations,
the power of the traditional admixture mapping method was close to
the 5% nominal level, whereas the power of the LRT and Logistic-
Local approaches were 82% and 89%, respectively. Therefore, our
tests can identify signals that are missed by the traditional admixture
method and be used as a general tool for genetic association analysis.

3.3 Analysis of the synthetic GWAS dataset

We analyzed the synthetic GWAS dataset simulated based on
the Maywood study (Kang et al., 2010) using ﬁve approaches,
including LRT, Logistic-Local, Logistic-Global, EIGENSTRAT
and unadjusted trend test. For the LRT, we assumed the disease
prevalences in Africans and Caucasians to be 0.3 and 0.1,
respectively, and analyzed the data assuming additive, dominant
and recessive models for ancestry risk. Figure 1 shows the
results from different tests for the region on Chromosome 1 that
undergoes selection. Using local adjustment tests, we did not observe
any evidence of association; however, all the other tests yield
highly signiﬁcant results, with many SNPs reaching genome-wide
signiﬁcance (P-values < 5 X 10‘s). The global ancestry adjustment
procedures such as Logistic-Global and EIGENSTRAT performed
similarly as the unadjusted trend test, suggesting that global ancestry
cannot sufﬁciently capture the local ancestry variation for regions
with natural selection. We note that the signiﬁcant results from
Logistic-Global, EIGENSTRAT and trend tests are not due to allelic
association between the SNPs and disease status, but are rather
driven by the association between the disease status and local

ancestry in the region. Our results demonstrate that global ancestry
adjustment procedures may identify a wrong region if local ancestry
in the region happens to be associated with disease status. As an
example, it has been previously shown that EIGENSTRAT cannot
completely remove the effect of population stratiﬁcation at the
lactase gene (Epstein et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010; Price et al., 2006).
We suspect that this failure is probably because global ancestry
cannot fully reﬂect the ancestry variation at the lactase gene.

We also note that admixture mapping searches for correlation
between local ancestry and disease status. Our results indicate
that even if there is a causal SNP in the region, adjusting for
global ancestry will result in a wide region with association signals
(~5 Mb or even larger depending on the size of the ancestry block)
due to inﬂated signals induced by association with local ancestry.
Therefore, the global ancestry adjustment methods may point to the
right region that harbors causal SNPs, but this region might be too
wide and may lead to following up of wrong SNPs/ genes. In contrast,
the local ancestry adjustment procedures will appropriately control
the background signals induced by association with local ancestry,
and thus can pinpoint the correct SNPs/ genes for follow-up study.
This makes the local adjustments procedures a useful tool for ﬁne
mapping of regions identiﬁed from admixture mapping studies.

4 DISCUSSION

We showed that in genetic association analysis of admixed
populations, local ancestry difference between study subjects can
confound with association signal and lead to spurious associations
if not appropriately controlled. We also showed theoretically that to
remove the confounding effect of local ancestry, it is sufﬁcient to
condition on local ancestry at the test SNP, whereas conditioning
on global ancestry may be ineffective. To remove the spurious
associations due to the confounding effect of local ancestry, we
further proposed two novel association tests that adjust for local
ancestry at the test SNP. We conducted extensive simulations and
evaluated the performance of different tests under various settings.
Our simulation results indicate that regardless of the mechanism of
population stratiﬁcation, whether due to local or global ancestry
difference, it is sufﬁcient to control population stratiﬁcation by
conditioning on local ancestry at the test marker. In contrast,
global ancestry adjustment procedures such as EIGENSTRAT and
Logistic-Global cannot completely remove the effect of population
stratiﬁcation induced by local ancestry difference. The reason is
that global ancestry information as represented by a global ancestry
proportion or a few principal components obtained from all markers
across the genome cannot accurately reﬂect the amount of ancestry
variation in local regions.

We proposed two tests for association analysis in admixed
populations. Our ﬁrst test, LRT, is based on a conditional likelihood
framework which models the distribution of a test SNP given disease
status and ﬂanking marker genotypes. This conditional likelihood
allows us to explicitly model local ancestry differences among study
subjects and thus it eliminates the effect of population stratiﬁcation
at the test SNP. Our second test, Logistic-Local, is based on a logistic
regression model that adjusts for local ancestry proportion at the test
SNP. Although the LRT approach is computationally more involved
than Logistic-Local, it is more ﬂexible and is particularly useful
when the directions of association are different in the ancestral
populations. Another advantage of the LRT approach is that, in

addition to testing the null hypothesis as described in Section 2,
we can test two other hypotheses H0: no disease—SNP association
in population X, and H0: no disease—SNP association in population
Y, separately. This can be achieved by testing H0 :f0,X = fl, X =f2,X
and H0 :f0,Y =fLY =f2,y, respectively. These tests allow a cross-
ethnicity replication since evidence of disease association in the two
ancestral populations can be directly compared (Risch et al., 2006).

Our tests are different from admixture mapping in that we directly
assess the correlation between a phenotype and SNP genotypes.
In contrast, admixture mapping examines the association between
a phenotype and local ancestry without fully using the actual
genotypes at each SNP. Therefore, SNPs falling within the same
ancestry block will share similar admixture mapping signal, which
explains why admixture mapping has substantially lower resolution
than direct SNP association analysis. Since the association tests we
proposed directly compare the allele frequencies between cases and
controls, they can serve as a ﬁne-mapping tool for regions identiﬁed
from admixture mapping studies. As shown in our simulations,
another advantage of our tests is that, unlike admixture mapping,
which may miss disease variants with similar allele frequencies in
the ancestral populations, our tests are able to identify such variants
since the allele frequencies between cases and controls are directly
compared. Therefore, our tests can be used as a general tool for
genetic association analysis.

Our tests rely on the estimates of local ancestry probabilities. It is
computationally intensive to estimate these probabilities for GWAS
datasets. In addition, our LRT test requires the estimation of several
parameters, which is computationally more involved than logistic
regression; for example, with 1000 cases and 1000 controls, it took
the LRT test about 3 days to ﬁnish the analysis of 500 000 SNPs
using a single CPU. However, the computations can be parallelized
across chromosomes, and thus the computation is tractable even for
very large datasets if a computing cluster is available.

Our methods treat estimated ancestry as plug-in estimates in the
likelihood calculation. Although simple, such a two-step procedure
is not as efﬁcient as approaches that estimate ancestry and disease
model parameters simultaneously. Another problem is that the
disease phenotypes are not used when estimating ancestry. However,
near a disease locus, cases are more related in terms of their shared
ancestry than controls. Ignoring disease status essentially assumes
that all individuals are no more related to one another than would
be expected by chance, and thus may lead to ancestry estimates that
are biased towards the null. How to jointly model local ancestry and
disease status would merit further research.

Our methods share similarity with a recent paper published by Qin
et al. (2010), who proposed to correct for population stratiﬁcation
using local principal components (PCs). In principle, this method
can be applied to admixed populations as well. However, local PCs
can only approximate the local ancestry and require a predeﬁned
window size, whereas for admixed populations such as African
Americans, locus-speciﬁc ancestry can be inferred accurately. As
noted by Qin et al. (2010), the local PC-based approach will be
more appropriate for a population whose substructure is subtle, due
to either the lack of information on the ancestral population or when
admixture has occurred within similar populations, for example,
European Americans.

In summary, we have proposed two novel association tests for
admixed populations. We showed that dependence between local
ancestry and disease phenotype can lead to spurious associations.

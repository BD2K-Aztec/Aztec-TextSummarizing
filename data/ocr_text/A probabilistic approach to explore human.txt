ABSTRACT

Motivation: Systematic identification of microRNA (miRNA) targets
remains a challenge. The miRNA overexpression coupled with
genome-wide expression profiling is a promising new approach and
calls for a new method that integrates expression and sequence
information.

Results: We developed a probabilistic scoring method called
targetScore. TargetScore infers miRNA targets as the transformed
fold-changes weighted by the Bayesian posteriors given observed
target features. To this end, we compiled 84 datasets from Gene
Expression Omnibus corresponding to 77 human tissue or cells and
113 distinct transfected miRNAs. Comparing with other methods,
targetScore achieves signiﬁcantly higher accuracy in identifying
known targets in most tests. Moreover, the confidence targets from
targetScore exhibit comparable protein downregulation and are more
significantly enriched for Gene Ontology terms. Using targetScore, we
explored oncomir—oncogenes network and predicted several potential
cancer-related miRNA—messenger RNA interactions.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) repress protein production in animal
species by forming Watson—Crick base pairing to the
3’-untranslated regions of the target messenger RNAs
(mRNAs) (Friedman et al., 2009). The binding primarily
occurs at the 2—7 nt positions from the 5’ end of the miRNA,
which is termed as the ‘seed’ and the binding as the ‘seed match’
(Lewis et al., 2003). MiRNA regulations have been implicated in
numerous developmental and pathogenic processes (Bartel,
2009). Functional characterization of miRNAs depends on pre-
cise identiﬁcation of their targets. However, it has proved difﬁ-
cult to experimentally identify miRNA—mRNA interactions.

To date, according to mirTarBase, only 3565 interactions
between 432 miRNAs and 1959 target genes in human have

been conﬁrmed using high-conﬁdence low-throughput assays
such as Western blot (Hsu et al., 2011). On the other hand,
computational prediction provides a rapid alternative method
to identify putative miRNA targets that can be subsequently
validated. However, accurate prediction of miRNA targets
remains a challenge with the current state-of—the-art algorithms
achieving <50% speciﬁcity and having poor agreement among
them (Alexiou et al., 2009). Most of these prediction programs
are based on sequence complementarity, evolutionary conserva-
tion (Friedman et al., 2009; Lewis et al., 2003), free energy
(Enright et al., 2004; Krek et al., 2005; Lewis et al., 2003) and/
or target site accessibility (Kertesz et al., 2007). Although it is
shown that evolutionary conservation can improve signal-
to-noise ratios, the conservation approach is limited, as not all
of the functional target sites are conserved (e. g. lineage- and
species-speciﬁc target sites) and vice versa. In particular, the per-
formance of conservation-based methods drops drastically when
restricted to only mammalian genomes because of short evolu-
tionary time (Friedman et al., 2009). Similarly, the energy- or
accessibility-based methods rely on secondary structure predic-
tion tools such as RNAfold (Lorenz et al., 2011), which itself
has room for improvements. These limitations also underscore
the historical lack of genome-wide functional data that meas-
ure the in vivo impact of miRNA regulation, which was alleviated
by the recent developments of transcriptomic and proteomic
proﬁling methods (Baek et al., 2008; Lim et al., 2005; Selbach
et al., 2008).

Particularly, overexpression of miRNA coupled with expres-
sion proﬁling of mRNA by either microarray or RNA-seq has
proved to be a promising approach (Arvey et al., 2010; Lim et al.,
2005). Consequently, genome-wide comparison of differential
gene expression holds a new promise to elucidate the global
impact of a speciﬁc miRNA regulation without solely relying
on evolutionary conservation. To improve the prediction of rela-
tive repression of mRNA, several studies have proposed a series
of additional determinants including seed match type (6mer seed,
7mer-tA1, 7mer-m8 and 8mer), number of target sites, site relative
location on the 3’-untranslated region, local AU content,
3’-supplementary paring, seed-pairing stability and target-site
abundance (Arvey et al., 2010; Garcia et al., 2011; Grimson
et al., 2007), which are combined together in a single value
termed as the ‘context score’ made available from targetScan
Web site (Garcia et al., 2011). Accordingly, we hypothesize that
target prediction can be improved by integrating expression
change and sequence information such as context score and

other orthogonal sequence-based features such as conservation
(Friedman et al., 2009) into a probabilistic score.

The proposed model differs from most of the previous expres-
sion-based target prediction methods in three important
aspects. First, our model is speciﬁcally designed for miRNA-
overexpression experiments to interrogate targets of a particular
miRNA in a speciﬁc cell condition. To our knowledge, only a
few methods are suitable for such task (Liu et al., 2010a). Most
existing methods such as GenMiR++ (Huang et al., 2007) and
GroupMiR (Le and Bar-Joseph, 2011) are based on global
miRNA-target expression correlation, which requires a large
set of expression proﬁles of both mRNA and miRNA measured
across various distinct conditions and may miss targets that are
speciﬁc to only a subset of the input samples. Second, the pro-
posed model is unsupervised such that it infers miRNA-targets
solely based on their distinct high-dimensional patterns of
expression fold-changes and sequence features. However, the
existing methods are mostly regression-based frameworks by
treating gene expression as response and miRNA expression as
input variables (Huang et al., 2007; Le and Bar-Joseph, 2011) or
supervised learning by explicitly operating on a training dataset
of conﬁdence positive and negative targets (Liu et al., 2010b;
Sumazin et al., 2011), which are incomplete and difﬁcult to
obtain. Third, our method operates on the entire gene set to
more closely model the overall likelihood rather than only on a
subset of genes preﬁltered by targetScan score (Huang et al.,
2007) or sample variance (Le and Bar-Joseph, 2011).

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview

We describe a novel probabilistic method for miRNA target prediction
problem by integrating miRNA-overexpression data and sequence-based
scores from other prediction methods. Brieﬂy, each score feature is con-
sidered an independent observed variable as input to a variational
Bayesian—Gaussian mixture model WB-GMM). We chose a Bayesian
over a maximum likelihood approach to avoid overﬁtting. Speciﬁcally,
given expression fold-change (due to miRNA transfection), we use a
three-component VB-GMM to infer downregulated targets accounting
for genes with little or positive fold-change [due to off-target effects
(Khan et al., 2009)]. Otherwise, two-component VB-GMM is applied
to unsigned sequence scores. The parameters for the VB-GMM are opti-
mized using variational Bayesian expectation maximization algorithm.
The mixture component with the largest absolute means of observed
negative fold-change or sequence score is associated with miRNA targets
and denoted as ‘target component’. The other components correspond to
the ‘background component’. It follows that inferring miRNA—mRNA
interactions is equivalent to inferring the posterior distribution of the
target component given the observed variables. The targetScore is com-
puted as the sigmoid-transformed fold-change weighted by the averaged
posteriors of target components over all of the features (3).

2.2 Bayesian mixture model

Assuming there are N genes, we denote x = (x1, ...,xN)T as the log
expression fold-change (Xf) or sequence scores (x1). Thus, for L sets of
sequence scores, x e {xf, x1, . . . , XL}. To simplify the following equations,
we use x to represent one of the independent variables without loss of
generality. To infer target genes for a miRNA given x, we need to obtain
the posterior distribution p(z|x) of the latent variable 2 e {21, ...,ZK},
where K: 3 (K :2) for modeling signed (unsigned) scores such as
logarithmic fold-changes (sequence scores).

We follow the standard Bayesian GMM based on Bishop (2006, pp.
474—482) with only minor modiﬁcations. Although univariate GMM
(D = 1) is applied to each variable separately, we implemented and de-
scribe the following formalism as a more general multivariate GMM,
allowing modeling the covariance matrices. Brieﬂy, the latent variables
z are sampled at probabilities 7r (mixing coefﬁcient), that follow a
Dirichlet prior Dir(7r|ao) with hyperparameters a0 2 (050,1, ...,oco, K).
To account for the relative frequency of targets and non-targets for
any miRNA, we set the 050,1 (associated with the target component) to
(IN and other 050,;C = (1 — a) x N/(K— 1), where a = 0.01 (by default).
Assuming x follows a Gaussian distribution N(x|u, A“), where A (pre-
cision matrix) is the inverse covariance matrix, p(,u, A) together follow a
Gaussian—Wishart prior USA/(MAM), (,BOA)_1)W(Ak|Wo, v0), where the
hyperparameters {mo,,80,W0, v0} = {12,1,IDxD,D + 1}.

2.3 Variational Bayesian expectation maximization
Let 0 = {2, 7r, ,u, A}. The marginal log likelihood can be written in terms

of lower bound £(q) (ﬁrst term) and Kullback—Leibler divergence
IC£(q||p) (second term):

19099) 4(9)
4(9) P(9|X)
where q(0) is a proposed distribution for p(0|x), which does not have a

closed form distribution. Because lnp(x) is a constant, maximizing £(q)
implies minimizing IC£(q| Ip). The general optimal solution In qj’l‘ (0]) is the

 

 

1np(x) = f 91(6) 1n + f 91(0) 1n (1)

expectation of variable j with respect to other variables, [E,-¢j[lnp(x, 0)].
In particular, we deﬁne q(z, If, ,u, A) = q(z)q(7r)q(,u, A). The expectations
for the three terms (at log scale), namely, ln q*(z), ln q* (n), In q* (,u), have
the same forms as the initial distributions due to the conjugacy of the
priors. However, they require evaluation of the parameters {2, If, ,u, A},
which in turn all depend on the expectations of z or the posterior of
interest:

max... 0) a [Em] = % (2)

j=1 9111'

where
1n 1% = [Elln 7Tk] +%[E[1n|/1k|] — %1n(2n) — %[E,uk,Ak[(Xn — Mk)TAk(Xn—
,uk)]. The inter-dependence between the expectations and model param-
eters falls naturally into an expectation-maximization (EM) framework,
namely variational Bayesian expectation maximization. Brieﬂy, we ﬁrst
initialize the model parameters based on priors and randomly sample K
data points ,u. At the ith iteration, we evaluate (2) using the model par-
ameters (VB-E step) and update the model parameters using (2) WB-M
step). The EM iteration terminates when £(q) improves by <10‘20 (de-
fault). Please refer to Bishop (2006) for more details.

2.4 TargetScore

We deﬁne the targetScore as an integrative probabilistic score of a gene
being the target t of a miRNA:

1
targetScore = 0(— log FC) K—H Z p(t|x) (3)

xe{xf, x1, ..., XL}

where 0(— log FC) 2 p(t|x) is the posterior in (2).

1+exp(log FC) ’

2.5 miRNA-overexpression data collection

We collected miRNA-overexpression data corresponding to 84 Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) series, 6 platforms, 77 human cells or tissues
and 113 distinct miRNAs (Supplementary Table S1). To our knowledge,
this is by far the largest compendium of miRNA-overexpression data.
To automate data downloading and processing, we developed a pipeline
written in R, making use of the function getGEO from GEOquery
R/Bioconductor package (Davis and Meltzer, 2007). For each dataset,
the pipeline downloads and quantile normalizes (if necessary) the expres-
sion data and calculates (when necessary) the log fold-change (logFC) in

treatment (miRNA transfected) versus (mock) control. For mRNAs
interrogated by multiple probes in a single experiment, we took the aver-
age of the fold-changes. Each of the 286 data vectors contains logFC
values for N 5 18560 RefSeq mRNAs (i.e. with preﬁx NM for known
protein coding mRNA obtained from University of California, Santa
Cruz) due to transfection of one of the 113 miRNAs. For two logFC
vectors associated with the same miRNA transfection (conducted in dif-
ferent studies), we removed mRNAs for which neither of the vectors
contains a logFC value and ﬁlled the remaining missing values in one
vector with the non-missing values in the other. For more than two
logFC vectors for the same miRNA transfection, we removed mRNAs
absent in all of those vectors and performed imputation for the remaining
missing values using impute . knn from impute R package (Troyanskaya
et al., 2001). Finally, we picked one representative logFC vector per
miRNA, which has the highest Pearson correlation with the binary
vector of the validated targets (Hsu et al., 2011) or averaged them if no
validated target was available. As a result, we have 113 logFC data vec-
tors for 113 distinct miRNA transfections.

2.6 Comparison with other prediction methods

We compared targetScore with seven published methods (Table 1).
Among these methods, Expmicro is the only method that also uses
miRNA-overexpression data. The other six methods are sequence-
based, and their predictions are ﬁne-tuned by the authors and the results
provided on their Web site are the most accurate ones. Thus, we only ran
Expmicro locally on the same test data and directly downloaded the
target predictions by the other six programs from their corresponding
Web sites. Speciﬁcally, predictions on all target sites (including conserved
and non-conserved sites) from targetScan 6.1 were obtained for both
context+ scores (CS) and probability of conserved targeting (PCT).
The latest PicTar2 target predictions were obtained from doRiNA
database (database of RNA interactions in post-transcriptional regula-
tion) (Anders et al., 2011). The miRanda predictions for sites with both
good and non-good mirSVR scores were obtained at http://www.micro
rna.org/. For Probability of Interaction by Target Accessibility (PITA)
predictions, the accessibility energy AAG on target sites ﬂanked by
3 /15 nt upstream/downstream (‘3 /15 ﬂank’) was chosen as recommended
by the authors (Kertesz et al., 2007). SVMicro predictions were ob-
tained from http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/svmicro.html. Expmicro was
run on the SVMicro scores and expression fold-changes (Liu et al.,
2010a).

2.7 Evaluation

2. 7.] Gold standard Experimentally validated targets were down-
loaded from mirTarBase (Hsu et al., 2011) (http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.
edu.tw). MirTarBase is one of the most comprehensive databases that
support bulk download and agree with other databases such as TarBase
(V ergoulis et al., 2012) and miRecords Oﬂao et al., 2009). MirTarBase 3.5
contains 3565 validated interactions between 432 human miRNAs
and 1959 target genes. The average (median) number of targets per
miRNA is 8.2 (3).

2.7.2 Methods of comparison We ﬁrst compared the performances
of using logFC and the six methods that use sequence information alone
(Table 1) in discriminating validated targets from the rest. To have a
reliable estimate, we selected the test data corresponding to miRNAs
that have at least three validated targets from mirTarBase and at least
I predicted target from each of the predictors. Based on the results, we
then picked two overall best sequence-based methods. The scores from
those two methods were then integrated along with logFC into the pro-
posed targetScore Equation (3). Next, we modiﬁed our testing set by
including miRNAs that have at least one target predicted from each of
the two best-performing sequence-based methods and at least 10 vali-
dated targets from mirTarBase. Finally, we evaluated the performances
of logFC and sequence-based methods alone in comparison with
Expmicro (Liu et al., 2010a) and the proposed targetScore.

2.7.3 Systematic evaluation For each comparison, the sensitivity and
speciﬁcity of the methods were systematically assessed using receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve and summarized by the area
under the curve (AUC) (Fig. 2). For a given score cutoff, the true- and
false-positive rates (TPR and FPR) are estimated as the respective ratios
of TPR: TP/P and FPR: FP/N, where TP and FF are the numbers of
true and false positives, and P and N are the total numbers of positive
and negative miRNA targets within the test data. Predicted targets outside
of the test data were not counted. ROC is plotted by iteratively evaluating
TPR (y-axis) and FPR (x-axis) while relaxing the scoring cutoff. In add-
ition, we constructed precision-recall (PR) curve (PRC) and assessed the
precision TP/(TP+ FP) of each method at the same recall (or TPR).
Comparing to ROC, PR is more informative in evaluating the perform-
ance at the top predictions. Both ROC and PR statistics were obtained
using ROCR package (Sing et al., 2005).

2.7.4 Evaluation using proteomic data To further evaluate the per-
formance of each method, we used the available protein output data

following overexpression of hsa-miR-l, 124 and 181 (Back et al., 2008;
Liu et al., 2010a). Despite higher cost, protein abundance is a more ac-
curate indicator of miRNA regulation than mRNA level, as miRNA is
known to cause not only mRNA degradation but also translational
repression. Presumably, a better prediction algorithm should rank the
top targets with larger negative protein fold-changes. Thus, we selected
the top 200 target predictions from selected prediction methods and
plotted the cumulative sum of the protein 10 g2 fold-change as a function
of their rankings (Liu et al., 2010a). At the same ranking, a superior
method is expected to reach greater protein downregulation, indicated
by a steeper curve (Fig. 3).

2.7.5 G0 enrichment analysis As an additional metric previously
used by Huang et al. (2007), we examined whether the miRNA targets
predicted by each method are biologically meaningful via Gene ontology
(GO) enrichment analysis. Speciﬁcally, GO terms in biological processes
(BP) (GO-BP) were downloaded using getBM function from R package
biomaRt (Durian et al., 2009), where GO terms with fewer than ﬁve
genes or with evidence codes equal to Inferred from Electronic
Annotation (IEA), Non-traceable Author Statement (NAS) or No bio-
logical Data available (ND) were discarded, giving 1717 GO-BP terms
and 10222 unique genes. Based on ROC analysis (Section 2.7.3), we
chose for each method a speciﬁc scoring cutoff that resulted in FPR
<03 and used such cutoff to select genes with equal or higher scores.
The resulting list of Ensembl gene IDs for each method was then sub-
jected to hypergeometric enrichment test for each GO-BP term using R
built-in function phyper. The corrected P—values or false discovery rate
(FDR) with R function p . adjust was converted to enrichment scores
as — log10(FDR). Cumulative density plot was constructed as a function
of the enrichment scores (Fig. 4B).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Constructing sequence-based predictors

Among the 113 overexpressed miRNAs, 11 of them have at least 3
validated and I predicted target from the 6 sequence-based
methods (Table 1). Using these test data, we established that
the best-overall sequence-based methods are targetScanCS
and targetScanPCT in terms of the AUCs of ROC and PR
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Accordingly, we constructed the pro-
posed targetScore by integrating logF C and sequence scores from
targetScanCS and targetScanPCT into Equation (3). Modifying
the test cases by including all of the overexpressed miRNAs that
have at least one predicted targets in targetScanCS,
targetScanPCT and SVMicro (required as input to Expmicro),
we obtained 35 miRNAs for subsequent comparisons.

3.2 TargetScore

Figure 1 illustrates the intuition behind targetScore. The top 10
interactions in terms of logF C, targetScanCS or PCT from the
real data were plotted for the validated and unvalidated targets.

Fig. 1. Hinton plot (Rumelhart and Hintont, 1986) of target feature
scores. Top 10 interactions in terms of logFC, targetScanCS or PCT for
validated and unvalidated targets are displayed. Gray/white indicates +/—
sign. Rectangle size is proportional to the feature size rescaled to [0, :l:1]

rescaled to [0, :l: 1]. Intuitively, we observe higher targetScores
as the three features scores (logF C, targetScanCS and PCT)
become more negative. In particular, the superior performance
of targetScore is more attributed to the logF C feature than the
other two in silico predictors; this is consistent with our hypoth-
esis that miRNA-overexpression data is valuable in miRNA
target prediction. Among the validated targets (left portion of
the plot), for instance, the top 10 logFC attribute to higher
targetScore than the top 10 scores from targetScanCS/PCT.
On the other hand, targetScanCS and PCT complement
logFC, as some (un)validated targets have (high) low logFC
but (low) high targetScanCS/PCT scores. Thus, targetScore is
a more robust predictor by integrating the three scores.

3.3 Comparisons of target prediction methods

Figure 2 and Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 show that our
targetScore method outperforms other existing methods.
Speciﬁcally, targetScore achieves signiﬁcantly higher AUC of
both ROC and PR than those from other methods (except for
the PR-AUC from targetScanPCT) (P<0.01; one-sided
Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Fig. 2C). Additionally, targetScore
dominates the largest number of tests among the 35 miRNAs:
it has the best ROC and PRC for 22 and 17 miRNAs, respect-
ively (Fig. 2D). It is also worth noting that our method had a
large leading margin ahead of the second best method in several
tests (e.g. hsa—miR—20a/ 192/16 in ROC and hsa-miR-1/124 in
PRC; right panels from Fig. 2A and B). Thus, targetScore is
able to outperform the best individual method by integrating
the complementary information generated from each method.

3.4 Protein downregulation

Because of the potential translational repression by miRNA,
negative logFC of protein outputs due to transfection of hsa—
miR-1/124/181 is a more direct indicator of the true miRNA
targets than mRNA expression. Targets ranked by targetScore
exhibit comparable negative cumulative logF C comparing with
the best among other methods (Fig. 3). Thus, the protein outputs
are mostly consistent with the above ROC/PR statistics, indicat-
ing that the conﬁdence target predictions from targetScore at the
mRNA level translate well to the miRNA effects at the protein
level.

3.5 GO enrichment of predicted targets

The conﬁdence targets ﬁltered by targetScore (at FPR<0.3) are
enriched for more signiﬁcant GO terms at F DR<0.05
than other methods in 19 of the 35 tests (Fig. 4A and
Supplementary Table S2). Overall, targetScore recovers signiﬁ-
cantly higher number of GO terms than other methods (P< 1e-6)
except for Expmicro (P<0.14; one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank
test; Fig. 4A inset table). Moreover, GO terms identiﬁed from
targetScore targets (targetScore-GO) exhibit signiﬁcantly higher
cumulative enrichment scores than those from Expmicro in nine
tests and those from logFC, targetScanCS/PCT in majority of
the tests as indicated by the gray boxes in Figure 4B (P<0.05,
one-sided paired Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test; see
Supplementary Fig. S4 for details). In contrast, Expmicro-GO
is signiﬁcantly more enriched than targetScore-GO in only four

GO Enrichment Score (—log10(FDR))

Fig. 4. Comparison of GO enrichments. For each comparison method, genes with equal or higher score than a cutoff in which FPR < 0.3 were subjected
to GO enrichment tests. (A) At FDR< 0.05, we counted the number of signiﬁcant GO terms for each method across the 35 miRNAs. The miRNAs in
red indicate that the number of GO terms from targetScore is the highest among all. (Inset) the P—values indicate whether the corresponding numbers of
GO terms from targetScore are signiﬁcantly higher than those from other methods based on one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test. 03) The (white) gray
boxes indicate that the cumulative GO enrichment scores from targetScore are (not) signiﬁcantly higher than those from competitors based on one-sided
paired KS-test at P< 0.05. The columns are in the same order as the miRNAs in panel A. The cumulative density function (CDF) plot for the ﬁrst and
last column (i.e. hsa-miR-106b and 27a) was illustrated in the bottom panel. At the same density (y-axis), the enrichment scores (x-axis) are the highest if
the corresponding CDF is on the right side of other CDFs. All of the CDF plots and detailed P—values are presented in Supplementary Figure S4

tests. Thus, targetScore-predicted targets are more likely en-
riched for meaningful BP.

3.6 Oncomir and oncogene targets network

Encouraged by the aforementioned results, we analyzed the
target relationships between oncomirs (Croce, 2009; Spizzo
et al., 2009) and oncogenes downloaded from COSMIC
(Forbes et al., 2011) (Supplementary Table S3). Speciﬁcally, we
identiﬁed 207 oncomir—oncogene interactions, involving 26
oncomirs (yellow node) and 113 oncogenes (white node)
(Fig. 5). Of these interactions, 166 are validated (red solid
edges) and the remaining 41 are predicted with targetScore
2 0.6 (blue dash edges). The scoring cutoff was chosen based
on the differential targetScore distributions for the validated
and non-validated targets (Supplementary Fig. S5). The
constructed oncomir—oncogene network is highly connected. In
particular, the top three oncomirs with the highest out-degree,
namely, hsa-miR-155, 16 and 373 target 27, 19 and 18 oncogenes,
respectively. Interestingly, 12 and all of the 19 targets of
hsa-miR-155 and 16 are, respectively, validated; in contrast, 17
of the 19 targets of hsa—miR—373 are predicted with high conﬁ-
dence, yet call for experimental validation.

4 DISCUSSION

Most of recently developed miRNA target prediction methods
exhibit a paradigm shift from rule-based binary classiﬁcation to a
more context-dependent, quantitative and probabilistic approach
(Huang et al., 2007; Le and Bar-Joseph, 2011). The momentum
of this shift is largely facilitated by the increasing amount
of expression proﬁling data of mRNAs (and miRNAs) across
various experimental conditions. However, most of these expres-
sion-based methods are based on correlation and thus require a

large set of expression proﬁles of mRNAs and miRNAs across
various tissues, cell lines or patients, which limit their applica-
tions to only a general survey of the robust miRNA targets
rather than condition-speciﬁc miRNA targets. On the other
hand, expression proﬁling following speciﬁc miRNA transfec-
tion (knockin) provides the most direct clue to identify in vivo
functional miRNA targets. However, expression data measured
by either microarrays or RNA-seq are noisy, and it is known that
changes in expression can be caused by indirect regulatory effect
by miRNAs (Khan et al., 2009), which is not easily distinguish-
able from direct effects without the aid of sequence-based infor-
mation. To our knowledge, few programs are speciﬁcally
developed for transfection-based miRNA target prediction.
Among them, Sylamer is the earliest work developed to identify
enriched k-mer motifs, which are the seed regions among the top
ranked targets based on P—values obtained from t-test (van
Dongen et al., 2008). Thus, the method does not model the dis-
tribution of fold-changes or sequence features. Instead, Sylamer
is mainly designed to visually inspect the enrichment of k-mer
patterns rather than predicting speciﬁc targets.

In this article, we introduce targetScore, a Bayesian probabil-
istic scoring method taking into account both the fold-change
due to miRNA overexpression and sequence-based information.
The proposed method is similar to Expmicro (Liu et al., 2010a).
However, Expmicro requires training data to calculate the
sequence-based scores using SVMicro and used only a two-
component GMM to model the fold-changes. In contrast,
targetScore models the distributions of multiple sets of precom—
puted or user-supplied sequence-based scores and fold-changes
using respective two- and three-component VB-GMM.

We complied (to our knowledge) the largest set of overexpres-
sion data compendium and demonstrated the utilities of
targetScore in extensive tests. TargetScore achieved superior
ROC and PR performances (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs S2

Fig. 5. Oncomir—oncogene network. The network drawn by Cytoscape 3 (Shannon et al., 2003) comprises 207 oncomir—oncogene interactions, where
166 (41) are validated (predicted with targetScore 2 0.6), involving 26 oncomirs (yellow) and 113 oncogenes (white). The red solid and blue dash edges
are the validated and predicted interactions, respectively. The size of the node is proportional to the connection degree. Edge widths are proportional

to the targetScore

and S3). The cumulative protein outputs for miR-1/124/181 as
a function of the top 200 rankings from targetScore reveals the
(second) deepest protein downregulation comparing with the
top targets from other methods (Fig. 3). Thus, the relative
overall trends at the protein level are consistent with the pre-
dictions at the mRNA level, where targetScore dominates most
of the tests. Moreover, targetScore targets are more enriched
for meaningful BP when compared with targets predicted by
other methods (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S4). Using
targetScore, we constructed an oncomir—oncogene regulatory
network (Fig. 5) and hypothesized that our predicted
oncomir—oncogene interactions may provide further insights
into cancer network.

The success of our method underlines the importance of inte-
grating (preferably independent) informative predictors into a
uniﬁed framework. On the other hand, the absolute PR perform-
ances are generally poor among all tested methods perhaps
because of the limited number of validated targets and/or the

limitations of the methods. Although targetScore compares favor-
ably with the published methods, there are a few issues that
remain to be addressed in future work. Several studies have
shown that the expression fold-change also depends on the initial
abundance and the natural decay or turnover rate of the corres-
ponding mRNA species (Larsson et al., 2010). Presumably, a
future target prediction algorithm will beneﬁt from the use
of this information in a cell-speciﬁc context. Additionally,
targetScore assumes that the mRNA targets are independent of
each other. However, Arvey et al. (2010) have shown that
miRNAs that have a higher number of available target transcripts
will downregulate each individual target gene to a lesser extent
than those with a lower number of targets. Although the context
score from targetScanCS has incorporated the static target abun-
dance information as the total number of target sites that can
be recognized by the same miRNA, it would be more realistic
to consider the underlying expression level of the co-targeted
mRNA to infer the actual available target sites.

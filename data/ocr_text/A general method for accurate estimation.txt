ABSTRACT

Summary: The ‘omic’ data such as genomic data, transcriptomic
data, proteomic data and single nucleotide polymorphism data have
been rapidly growing. The omic data are large-scale and high-through-
put data. Such data challenge traditional statistical methodologies and
require multiple tests. Several multiple-testing procedures such as
Bonferroni procedure, Benjamini—Hochberg (BH) procedure and
Westfall—Young procedure have been developed, among which
some control family-wise error rate and the others control false dis-
covery rate (FDR). These procedures are valid in some cases and
cannot be applied to all types of large-scale data. To address this
statistically challenging problem in the analysis of the omic data, we
propose a general method for generating a set of multiple-testing pro-
cedures. This method is based on the BH theorems. By choosing a
C-value, one can realize a specific multiple-testing procedure. For
example, by setting C: 1.22, our method produces the BH proced-
ure. With C<1.22, our method generates procedures of weakly con-
trolling FDR, and with C>1.22, the procedures strongly control FDR.
Those with C: G (number of genes or tests) and C :0 are, respect-
ively, the Bonferroni procedure and the single-testing procedure.
These are the two extreme procedures in this family. To let one
choose an appropriate multiple-testing procedure in practice, we de-
velop an algorithm by which FDR can be correctly and reliably esti-
mated. Simulated results show that our method works well for an
accurate estimation of FDR in various scenarios, and we illustrate
the applications of our method with three real datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION

The advance of ‘omic’ technologies has led to a great develop-
ment of large-scale data such as microarray data, transcriptomic
data, metabolomic data and proteomic data. These ‘omic’ data
enable us to take a global insight into complex biological pro-
cedures, the interaction between genetic and environmental fac-
tors and pathological mechanisms of complex diseases, such as
diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and various cancers, Via

identiﬁcation of genes differentially expressed and cluster or
classiﬁcation of functional genes, pathway or network. Such
large-scale data or high-throughput data challenge traditional
statistical tests (Efron et al., 2001; Newton et al., 2001; Pan
et al., 2003; Tan et al., 2006; Tusher et al., 2001) because the
traditional statistical tests are single tests. In a single hypothesis
test, the threshold or is meaningful for determining whether a test
is signiﬁcant because at is a probabilistic threshold for the occur-
rence of an event in a population. However, threshold or 20.05
does not remain valid for multiple statistical analyses of omic
data because, for example, in identiﬁcation of 10000 genes, at
least 500 ﬁndings are expected by chance at the signiﬁcance level
of 0.05 (Nichols and Hayaska, 2003; Tusher et al., 2001).
Therefore, threshold or is required to be adjusted for multiple
tests. Currently, several statistical procedures have been de-
veloped for adjusting threshold or or adjusting P—Values in the
multiple tests. Among them, the Bonferroni procedure, the Helm
procedure (Holm, 1979), the Hochberg procedure (Hochberg,
1988), the Westfall and Young procedure ONestfal and Young,
1993), the Sidak procedure (Nichols and Hayasaka, 2003), the
Benjamini—Hochberg (BH) procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg,
1995) and the Benjamini—Liu procedure (Benjamini and Liu,
1999) are typical multiple-testing approaches. Among these pro-
cedures, the BH procedure has been most broadly applied in
practice. But we found that the true false discovery rate (FDR)
does not always remain consistent with the estimated FDR of the
BH procedure, and all existing multiple-testing procedures are
actually special cases of the multiple-testing procedure family
that ranges from the single-testing procedure to the Bonferroni
procedure; in other words, these procedures give different rejec-
tion space (Fig. 1). In practice, our simulation also shows that
true FDR is often signiﬁcantly overestimated or underestimated
by the BH procedure. To accurately estimate FDR in a large-
scale statistical analysis, here we propose a method that is based
on the BH theorems to generate a set of multiple-testing proced-
ures in a range of the single-testing procedures to the Bonferroni
procedure and a simulation algorithm to choose a desirable
procedure.

2 METHODS
2.1 Rejection area for the hypothesis tests

Here we focus on discussing rejection areas of the single-testing procedure
[A(s)], the Bonferroni [A(B)] and the BH multiple-testing procedures
[A(BH)]. As seen in Figure l, for G hypotheses to be tested, a single-

Fig. 1. Area of rejection. Single-testing procedure is a top (solid) line with
(p = or for all genes to be tested. The Bonferroni (Bon—) procedureis bottom
(dash and dot) line with (p = or / G for all genes and its area for reject is area
under (dash and dot) line (=or(l / G) X G = or where (p is an adjusted at. The
BH-procedure is a up-diagonal (dash) line with (p, = 011' / G for gene 1', and its
area of rejection is area under diagonal line (2 ozG/ 2) where (p, is an ad-
justed or

testing procedure has the largest rejection area: A(s) = 01G where or is a
probabilistic threshold, whereas the Bonferroni multiple-testing proced-
ure has the smallest rejection area: A(B) = (or/G)G = at. These are two
extreme rejection areas. In the single-testing procedure, 01G hypotheses
would be rejected by chance, whereas the Bonferroni multiple-testing
procedure would have a chance of or to reject the G hypotheses, which
is called the family-wise error rate. The rejection area of the BH multiple-
testing procedure is area under diagonal line, which is half of that of the
single-testing procedure, A(BH) = fOG oz(i/G)di = aG/ 2 where i is the i—th
hypothesis. But different from the single-testing procedure where or is set
for all hypotheses and the Bonferroni multiple-testing procedure where or/
G is given for all hypotheses, the BH multiple-testing procedure is a
procedure where, from G to l, the adjusted or values are on a diagonal
line, its rejection area is orG/2. So the BH multiple-testing procedure falls
in between the single-testing procedure and the Bonferroni multiple-test-
ing procedure. Therefore, in theory, it is possible to give any multiple-
testing procedure with a rejection area from 01G to or.

2.2 Benjamini—Hochberg theorems

For m null hypotheses H1, H2, ..., Hm, testing them has corresponding
P—Values 171,192, . . . , pm. Let 17(1), 17(2), . . . , pm) be the ordered P—Values and
their corresponding ordered null hypotheses be H“), HQ), . . . , Hon).
Then, we have a BH procedure:

Let k be the largest i for which pg) 5 "110:, then all Ha), Ha), .. . , H(k)
would be rejected.

THEOREM: for independent statistical tests and for any conﬁguration of
false null hypotheses, the above procedure controls the FDR at the sig-
niﬁcance level or (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

This theorem is based on the following lemma:

LEMMA: deﬁne Q = V/(V+ S) as FDR where V and S are, respectively,
numbers of ﬁndings in true and false null hypotheses, for any m0 inde-
pendent P—Values corresponding to true null hypotheses where
0 5 m0 5 m and for any m1 P—Values corresponding to false null hypoth-
eses where m1 = m — mg, the BH procedure satisﬁes inequality

"’1
E(Q|Pm0+1=p19---9Pm=pm1)5%05 

By integrating inequality Equation (1), we obtain
E(Q) : @am (2)
m

and the FDR is controlled (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Because
0 5 m0 5 m, any procedure with function of 1'

m

17(1) S (3)

also satisﬁes inequality Equation (2) and has control of FDR where i is
an ordered number from 1 to m, and f(i) is any function of i and
l 5 f(i) 5 m. From Equation (3), one can see that the aforementioned
multiple-testing procedure becomes the single-testing procedure when
f(i)=m, the Bonferroni procedure when f(i)=l or the BH procedure
when f(i) = i.

2.3 Function f(i)

Suppose we have a set of observed P—Values p1, . . . , pk, . . ., pG for G null
hypotheses H1,H2, ...,Hk, ...,Hg. Let them be ranked as
17(1) 5  5 pa) 5  5 pm) with corresponding ordered null hypotheses
H(1),H(2), ..., Hg), ...,H(G) where i is the i—th position in the ranked
space corresponding to k in the unranked space. We declare all hypoth-
eses HE“) to be interesting when p(,) 5 (p, in a step-up fashion where (p, is
an adjusted or. To realize a general adjustment of or for any control of
FDR across the whole observed P—Values, we need a control sequence. To
this end, let a set of G q-values be a linear-rank sequence
q1<q2<  <qg<  <qG where g: l,.., G and qg =g/G. We then
deﬁne a ratio of difference between two adjacent q-values to the sum
of them as

(Qg _ Qg—l)

4
(qg +Qg—1) ( )

and take the sum of the ratios over subset i,

._ i (Qg _ Qg—l)
5’ _ 1 + 25:2 (qg + qg—l) (5)

where S1 = l, i: 2, 3,. . . , G and in the whole ranked set, we have

_ G (qg _ qg—l)
S _ 1+ Zg=2(61g + qg—1)° (6)

Thus, the control sequence consists of a set of ranked rates with a

power C:
S,- C
R,= — 7
(S) 0

where C is referred to as control value. In the control sequence, we have
R1 e 0 for 51:1 and RG = (Sg/S)C =10 :1 for SG 2 S. With the
control sequence, function of i is found to be

f(i) = GRi (8)
or then is adjusted as

f(i) GRi

(p, — or x F — 0:?

Equation (9) gives a family of multiple procedures from the single-
testing procedure to the Bonferroni procedure. The C-Value is a so-
called control value because it has a control effect on (p,; in other
words, different C-Values have different control levels of false-positive
ﬁndings. For example, when C20, then R, = l and (p, = 01G1 /G = or
for all P-Values, which is the single-testing procedure; when C —> 00,
then Cli—rrgoR, =0 and Cli—rrgorp, =oz/G or C=G>1000, R,- %0 and

(9)

(p, R or/ G for all P—Values, which is just the Bonferroni procedure; and
if C: 1.22, we have (p,- R 0%, which is just the BH procedure (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2. Multiple procedures. These multiple-testing procedures for testing
7129 genes differentially expressed between two conditions are created by
using C: 0.50, .. .1.22, ...3.0 on Equation 9. Compared to the BH-pro-
cedure (dash line) in Figure 1, the procedure with C = 1.22 (deep purple
and solid line) is the BH-procedure. Therefore, procedures with C > 1.22
have stronger control of FDR than the BH-procedure while those with
C< 1.22 have weaker control of FDR than the BH-procedure

Thus, at C > 1.22, Equation (9) generates a set of multiple-testing proced-
ures that have stronger FDR control than the BH procedure, whereas at
C < 1.22, it generates another set of multiple-testing procedures that have
weaker FDR control than the BH procedure (Fig. 2). Therefore, the
method not only can realize the existing multiple-testing procedures but
also can produce a new procedure by choosing an appropriate C-Value
(Fig. 2).

2.4 C-value choice for FDR control

To control FDR, we need to choose a C-Value to generate a multiple-
testing procedure. In theory, one can use a permutation approach (Reiner
et al., 2003) to determine a multiple-testing procedure. But as we will see
in Section 3, the permutation is not a good way because it tends to sig-
niﬁcantly underestimate FDR. Therefore, we here propose an alternative
approach to choose a desirable C-Value for a real dataset. For the con-
venience of discussion, we focus our algorithm on traditional two-
condition (or two-class) t-test methodology.

Our algorithm runs through the following nine steps, among which
Step 2 is to calculate means, variances and distances of each gene, Steps 3
and 4 are to simulate data using parametric bootstrap and Steps 5 and 6
are to estimate FDRs using a set of multiple procedures:

STEP 1: apply a statistical method and a set of multiple procedures to real
data and calculate a real ratio set of ﬁndings by comparing the ordered
P—Values to M sets of adjusted or values: pm 2 Nm / G where m = 1,. . . , M,
and Nm is number of ﬁndings by a statistical method in real data at the
m-th C level.

STEP 2: calculate mean xgk and variance 083k of expression values of gene
g (g: 1,. . . ,G) in condition k (k: 1, 2) from a real dataset, distance dg
between two means for each gene g, dg 2 2g, — ﬁg, and sort d-Values
from the largest to the smallest.

STEP 3: adjust distance value by

d xa, ifa) <6
d:_{g g (10)

dg, otherwise

where 6 is an input value in (0,1], a is also an input parameter value and
cog = mgjﬁggl. Here 6 and a are used to adjust the larger estimated ratios
(ps) of ﬁndings at lower C levels. Here ,5", = Nm/G where Nm is the

 

number of ﬁndings by the same statistical method in a simulated dataset
at the m-th C level.

STEP 4: determine a distribution of the real dataset. For microarray data,
normal distribution is good, and for transcriptomic data, negative bino-
mial distribution or Poisson distribution may be considered. Here, as an
example, we focus on microarray data and use a normal pseudorandom
generator to generate expression noise from gene to gene in each
condition:

wgk, = N_1(0,ogk,r) (11)

where r is the r-th replicate, r = 1,. . . , Rk where Rk is replicate number in
condition k, and ogk is standard deviation for gene g in condition k.
We set ogl 2 egg to generate the same expression noise distribution in
two conditions. Then the adjusted d-Values are randomly assigned to pmG
genes:

xglr = ngr + 

(12a)
xg2r = Wg2r _ bag:
if Ug 3 pm,
xglr = ngr 
xg2r = Wg2r

otherwise, where Ug is the uniform random variable from gene to gene,
and b is a weight value. The b-Value should be smaller if [3M (the smallest
estimated ratio of ﬁndings) is larger than pM (the smallest real ratio of
ﬁndings); the b—Value should be larger, otherwise.

STEP 5: apply the same statistical method to the simulated data and
obtain a set of G P—Values from a given distribution. Apply Equation
(7) and Equation (9) and a set of M C-Values to create M multiple-testing
procedures that have already been used in the real data and do multiple
comparisons.

STEP 6: because differentially expressed genes are given, count false ﬁnd-
ings and calculate FDR.

STEP 7: 6, a and b are determined by ﬁtting the estimated ratio set
of ﬁndings to the real ratio set of ﬁndings. We begin with 6: a=b= 1
and roughly check whether the estimated ratio set of ﬁndings identiﬁed
by M multiple-testing procedures is ﬁtting to the real ratio set. If yes,
go to Step 8; otherwise, reset 6, a and/or 17 values (see Section 4) and
again perform Steps 3—5 until the estimated ratio set is close to the
real one.

STEP 8: repeat Steps 4—6 about 15 times, and calculate means of estimated
ratios of ﬁndings and estimate FDR values at each C level.

STEP 9: smooth the estimated FDRs by using polynomial regression. The
method is to plot M estimated FDRs versus M C-Values (from the smal-
lest to the largest) to yield an observed line, use the polynomial regression
line to ﬁt the observed line, then make solution for regression coefﬁcients
1%, ..., ,8, and use the polynomial regression equation to calculate the
FDR corresponding to each C-Value. The order in polynomial regression
depends on ﬁtting. This is easily done in Excel.

Plot the real and estimated ratio sets of ﬁndings identiﬁed by M
multiple-testing procedures, and ﬁt a linear regression model with inter-
section ,80 and regression coefﬁcient ,81. If |,Bol 5 0.1 and 0.9 5 ,81 5 1.1,
then the estimated ratio set of ﬁndings is almost identical to the real ratio
set across M multiple-testing procedures, and the true FDR set would
also be given with the estimated FDR set; a C-Value would be chosen by
choosing a calibrated FDR. Otherwise, repeat Steps 4—7 by resetting
parameters a, b and <1) until |,Bol 5 0.1 and 0.9 5 ,81 5 1.1.

Multiple procedures for accurate estimation of FDR

 

2.5 Performances of statistical methods
Empirical Bayesian analysis was performed using baySeq package; Fisher
exact tests and a generalized linear model (GLM) were implemented in
edgeR package. Packages baySeq and edgeR were downloaded from
Bioconductor. These two packages use the BH procedure to adjust
P—values (to estimate FDR). Beta t—tests were conducted in Matlab. We
also used the BH procedure to adjust P—values. The q-value approach was
performed using the qvalue package downloaded from Bioconductor.
This package has GUI interface. We loaded P—values from two-sample
t—tests into the qvalue.gui interface and executed q-value computation
and obtained q-values. We chose DE genes at q-value 5 0.05.

Our multiple-procedure approach and the algorithm for the choice of
C-Value were implemented in Matlab.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulation evaluation

We used Tusher et al.’s (2001) microarray data to illustrate this
algorithm. We downloaded the data from the website http://
www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/. The data consist of 7129
genes and eight human lymphoblastoid cell line samples,
among which four were treated with ionizing radiation and the
remainders treated with un-ionizing radiation were used as con-
trols. From the real microarray data, means and variances of
expression values of each gene in two conditions were obtained,
and a normal pseudorandom generator, any one of two means,
any one of two standard deviations for each gene and four rep-
licates were used to create two noise expression datasets of 7129
genes with equal variances. Then, simulated data were generated
by linearly and randomly assigning condition effects ‘17 : 300U
on differential expressions between the two conditions to 30% of
genes in the two noise datasets where U is a uniform variable in
(0,1]. Note that our simulation procedure generates strong de-
pendence among these 30% of genes in assigning their expression
values. We applied a classical two-condition t-test method to this
simulated dataset and set M : 140 C-Values from 0.01 to 1.4 to
create 140 procedures for multiple tests and obtained 140 ratios
of ﬁndings. By applying the aforementioned algorithm and ad-
justing a, b and 6 values, we found that when a : 0.001, b : 5 and
6:0.054, 140 estimated and real ratios of ﬁndings are close to-
gether. Thus, the results were averaged over 15 repeated simula-
tions and displayed in Figure 3. Figure 3A shows that a plot line
of estimated against real ratios of ﬁndings is almost a diagonal
line with intersection ,80 : —0.009 w 0 and regression coefﬁcient
,81 :l.0576~1, so the estimated ratio set of ﬁndings is almost
identical to the real one. From Figure 3B, one also can see that
the plot dots of estimated FDRs versus true FDRs are almost on
a diagonal line, suggesting that the estimated FDR is approxi-
mately identical to its true value at each FDR point.

Next, we simulated transcriptomic data with negative binomial
distribution. Our simulations were conducted by setting 13000
mRNA isoforms, two conditions (control and disease states), six
replicated libraries in each condition, probability : U where U is
random uniform variable, U e [0, l] and size: 1000U for each
isoform. The negative binomial pseudorandom generator and
these setting parameters were used to create two noise transcrip-
tomic datasets with equal variances, and then ‘17 : lOOu for con-
ditional (or treatment) effect values on differential transcription
of mRNA isoforms were randomly and linearly assigned to 10%

against real ratios of ﬁndings. The estimated and real ratios of ﬁndings
were obtained by 140 testing procedures and our algorithm from a simu-
lated dataset based Tusher et al. (2001) microarray data. Solid line is a
regression line and dash line is observed value. (B) Plot of estimated against

solid line is a diagonal line on which estimated FDR is equal to its true
value at each FDR point and the dash line is estimated DFR

of mRNA isoforms in two noise datasets where u:(0,l] is the
uniform variable. Thus, simulated data with 10% differentially
transcribed isoforms, six replicates and two conditions were ob-
tained. There are a batch of existing methods for ﬁnding mRNA
isoforms of being differentially transcribed between two condi-
tions: empirical Bayesian (Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010), Fisher
exact test (Robinson and Smyth, 2008), GLM (McCarthy
et al., 2012) and Beta t-test (Baggerly et al., 2003). These methods
all use the BH procedure to estimate FDR. Similarly to Figure
3B, we here used the simulated transcriptomic datasets to evalu-
ate the BH procedure based on the four statistical methods. We
plotted true FDRs in ﬁndings of these methods against estimated
FDRs using the BH procedure from cutoff: ~ 0 to~0.2l.
Figure 4 shows that the BH-estimated FDR curves in the empir-
ical Bayesian, GLM and Fisher exact test and especially, in the
Beta t-test are much below their theoretical lines (true FDR
versus true FDR), indicating that in these methods the BH pro-
cedure heavily underestimated FDRs.

To fully display statistical properties of our multiple-testing
approach in various microarray experiments, we also generated
simulation datasets in 27 scenarios. Our simulations were based
on Tusher et al.’s (2001) microarray data. We set three levels of
condition (or treatment) effect: A : 100, 200 and 300; three levels
of proportions of differentially expressed genes: P: 10, 20 and
30% and three levels of sample sizes: n : 4, 6 and 18. Condition
effect ‘17 : Au was randomly assigned to P of genes. This assign-
ment generated strong correlation expressions among genes. Our
multiple-procedure approach and algorithm for FDR estimation
were applied to these simulated datasets. Because of lots of the
simulated datasets, we could not display the proﬁles of estimated
and real ratios of ﬁndings and the estimated and true FDRs, as

mated FDRs were averaged over three simulated datasets. (A) Exact tests,

the numbers of ﬁndings obtained by traditional t-test method

chosen with its estimated FDR smaller than but closest to the
cutoff of 0.05. To demonstrate our algorithm, we also applied
permutation (Reiner et al., 2003) and q-value (Storey and
Tibshirani, 2003) approaches to these 27 stimulated datasets.
The results are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.

It can be seen in Supplementary Table S1 that C-Value chosen
varies in the range of 0.9—1.32 including C: 1.22. As seen in
Figures 1 and 2, C: 1.22 produces the BH procedure. Thus,
the BH procedure is just one of our multiple procedures. The
FDR estimated by our method at each C-Value in each given
scenario is close to its true value, except that in scenarios 3 and
17 where the true FDR values are little greater than their esti-
mated values; all the other FDRs were slightly overestimated,
meaning that our estimation of FDR is conservative.
Supplementary Table S1 also gave the results obtained by per-
forming the q-value approach (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003). Our
method and the q-value approach have similar number of ﬁnd-
ings in most of simulated datasets. However, the q-value ap-
proach underestimated FDRs in nine scenarios (33.3%).
Therefore, for conservativeness of FDR estimation, our
method obviously outperforms q-value approach. By using the
permutation algorithm the FDRs were severely underestimated
in all 27 scenarios (Supplementary Table S1), indicating that the
permutation is not a desirable approach for estimation of FDR.

3.2 Application

The ﬁrst example for application of the multiple-procedure ap-
proach is Tusher et al.’s (2001) microarray data. As seen above,

the data consist of 7129 genes. Tusher et al. (2001) tried to ﬁnd
genes differentially expressed between four human lymphoblas-
toid cell line samples treated by ionizing radiation and four
samples without ionizing radiation. We set 140 C-Values from
0.1 to 1.39 to create 140 multiple-testing procedures. Because
C-Value> 0.92 did not produce meaningful results (no ﬁndings),
we obtained a set of 83 real ratios of ﬁndings from the real data
using classical two-condition t-test method. After adjusting, we
found a:0.02, b:2.9 and 6:0.3 and repeated our algorithm
process for 15 times and generated a set of 83 estimated ratios of
ﬁndings and a set of 83 estimated FDRs. We plotted real and
estimated ratios of ﬁndings in Figure 5A1. The regression line is

Fig. 5. Applications of our method to the real data. The real ratio set of
ﬁndings was obtained by using a set of 140 procedures for multiple t-tests
of gene differential expressions between two conditions from a real data-
set. The estimated ratio set of ﬁndings was obtained by using our method
from 15 simulated datasets each similar to real data. The estimated ratio
of ﬁndings is compelled to be identical to its real value across all given
procedures so that the true FDR generated by each of procedures would
be reliably estimated. Column 1: plots of estimated versus real ratios of
ﬁndings. Solid line is a regression line, dash line is observed line. Column
2: plots of estimated FDRs versus C-values (procedures). Row A: The
ionizing irradiation microarray data provided by Tusher et al. (2001).
7129 genes of being expressed in 4 human lymphoblastoid cell line sam-
ples treated by ionizing radiation and in 4 samples without ionizing radia-
tion were detected on human cDNA arrays. Row B: the data are acute
leukemia microarray data that were downloaded from Broad Institute
Cancer Program Data Set. This dataset consists of 12582 genes whose
expression values in 24 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines and
in 28 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines were measured by
oligonucleotide arrays. Row C: Arabidopsis microarray data (Lee et al.
2009). This dataset contains 22810 genes that were detected for differen-
tially expression between the C58 infected and control stalks each with 3
replicates on plant Arabidopsis gene chip

almost a diagonal line with intersection ,80 :0.0008 % 0 and
regression coefﬁcient ,81 :0.9451~l. Hence, the estimated ratio
of ﬁndings is proximately identical to its real ratio at each of
C-Values. Thus, the simulated FDR given in Figure 5A2 can
be used to estimate the true FDR across the 83 C-Values.
Figure 5A2 shows that the smallest FDR is 0.36 at
C-Value:0.92, which is much larger than cutoff of 0.05.
Therefore, at FDR cutoff of 0.05, no gene in this dataset was
found to be differentially expressed between human lymphoblas-
toid cell lines treated with ionizing radiation and control cell
lines. This result is consistent with the report of Tusher et al.
(2001) where the smallest FDR estimated is 0.12 in SAM.

The second example is leukemia microarray data downloaded
from http://www.broadinstitute.org/cgi-bin/cancer/datasets.cgi.
This dataset consists of 12582 genes whose expression values
in 24 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines, 20 myeloid
lymphoid leukemia cell lines and 28 acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML) cell lines were measured by oligonucleotide arrays. Here,
we chose two leukemia cell types ALL and AML for differential
expression tests. This is an example of two conditions with large
and unequal sample sizes. For this dataset, we input 140 C-Values
from 0.1 to 1.39 and generated 140 real ratios from classical
unpaired two-condition t-tests. After adjusting, we obtained
a:0.5, b: 1.5 and 6:0.05 and applied our algorithm to esti-
mate a set of FDRs by the 140 procedures and repeated 15 times.
The results are shown in Figure 5B. As seen in Figure 5B1, the
plot dots of the estimated versus real ratios of ﬁndings almost
fall on a diagonal line with intersection ,80 : 0.0065 % 0 and
regression coefﬁcient ,81 : 0.9824 % 1, suggesting that the esti-
mated ratio of ﬁndings was constrained to be almost identical
to the real one at each C-level. Thus, the true FDR set can be
given by the estimated FDR set. Figure 5B2 shows that at
C: 1.31, FDR:0.049723 is close to 0.05 at which 582 genes
were identiﬁed to be differentially expressed between ALL and
AML cell lines.

The third example is Arabidopsis microarray data. To explore
whether Arabidopsis genes respond to oncogenes encoded by the
transfer-DNA (T-DNA) or to bacterial effector proteins codeliv—
ered by Agrobacteria into the plant cells, Lee et al. (2009) con-
ducted microarray experiments at 3 h and 6 d after inoculating
wounded young Arabidopsis plants with strains C58 and
GV3101, a cognate of strain C58, which only lacks transfer-
DNA, but possesses proteinaceous Virulence (Vir) factors such
as VirD2, VirE2, VirE3 and VirF (Vergunst et al., 2000, 2003).
Wounded, but uninfected, stalks were served as control. As an
example, we just downloaded 6d postinoculation data from GEO
(GEO accession: GSE14106) website (http://www.ncbi.nhn.nih.
gov/geo/). The data consisting of 22810 genes were obtained
from the C58 infected and control stalks each with three repli-
cates. We performed the classical two-condition t-test approach
on this dataset and applied our multiple-procedure approach to
do multiple tests. We set 140 C-Values from 0.01 to 1.4 to create
140 procedures and obtained 140 real ratios of ﬁndings from
two-condition t-tests. After adjusting, we found a: 0.08, b : 15
and 6:0.035. Using these parameters, we obtained 140 esti-
mated ratios of ﬁndings and FDRs by 140 procedures for 15 re-
peats. Figure 5C1 shows that the observed plot line of estimated
versus real ratios of ﬁndings completely overlapped with the pre-
dicted line. Because intersection ,80 : 0.007 w 0 and regression

Fig. 6. Heatmap. Rows are 1427 genes found to be differentially ex-
pressed between young tumor (6d postinoculation), and control stalk
and columns are three control (reference) stalk replicates (right side)
and three young tumor replicates (left side), among which 498 genes
were downregulated in C58 strain relative to control stalk, and 929
were upregulated in C58 strain relative to control stalks. Yellow is the
lowest expression values, and deep red is the highest expression values

coefﬁcient ,81 : 0.985 w l, the observed line of estimated and
real ratios of ﬁndings is a diagonal line, so that the estimated
ratio of ﬁndings is one-to-one identical to the real one at each C-
Value. Thus, the true FDR set can be given by the estimated
FDR set. Figure 5C2 shows that 1427 genes were identiﬁed to
be differentially expressed between the young tumor and control
stalks at C: 1.2 with FDR:0.0497 (Table 1). However, using
the fold change method, Lee et al. (2009) just identiﬁed 196 dif-
ferentially expressed genes at P<0.01. Both have a big differ-
ence. To verify our ﬁndings, we displayed heatmap of the raw
data of the 1427 DE genes selected in Figure 6. Figure 6 shows
that in the downregulation, all the 498 genes clearly had much
lower expression values in young crown gall tumors than in

control (reference) stalks (as shown by deep red and yellow,
respectively), whereas in the upregulation, all the 929 genes
also had clearly much higher expression values in crown gall
tumors than in control stalks. That is, in the 1427 genes,
tumors and controls are explicitly separated by gene expressions.
For the three replicates, the 1427 genes are differentially
expressed.

4 DISCUSSION

The probabilistic threshold or is adjusted as (p : 05¢ where (0 is
called rate for controlling false discoveries. The single-testing
procedure and the Bonferroni procedure are two extreme pro-
cedures. As shown in Figure l, the single-testing procedure is a
top horizontal line with (0:1 for all G tests, whereas the
Bonferroni procedure is a bottom horizontal line with (b: 1 /G
for all G tests. The BH procedure has the rate of controlling false
discoveries (b: i/G where i: l . . ., G, which is a diagonal line.
They all are special cases of our method. Interestingly, if
Equation (9) is changed as

9% = Ot¢k = (13)

“G+1—G&
our multiple-procedures can then switch the step-up procedures
given in Equation (9) to the step-down procedures given in
Equation (13): for R1 :0, we have (p1 : 05/ G, whereas for
RG : l, we have (pg : or. Like step-up procedures, by changing
C-Value, a set of Rk-Values is also altered so that a set of new
multiple-testing procedures is created. If C: 0, then Rk : l and
gok : or for all hypotheses, which is the single-testing procedure.
If C> 1000, then Rk % 0 and gok % a/G for all hypotheses, which
is just Bonferroni procedure. If C : x so that GRi % i, i : l, . . . ,
G, then (,0,- : or/(G — i+ l) is just the Holm procedure. If C : y
so that (p, : 05/ (G — GRi + l) % ai/ G, we get a proximate BH
procedure. These indicate that in our multiple-procedure ap-
proach, the step-down procedures are equivalent to the step-up
procedures.

As seen in Table 1, our method is somewhat similar to SAM
(Tusher et al., 2001) and RAM (Tan et al., 2006) because a set of
C-Values (procedures) is equivalent to a set of thresholds (As)
given for declaring signiﬁcant tests in comparison between the
observed ranked statistics and the estimated ranked null statistics
in SAM and RAM. However, as seen in Figure 3 and in
Supplementary Table S1, our method ensures that estimated
FDR is close to its true value by constraining that the estimated
ratio of ﬁndings is identical or approximate to its real ratio at
each of the given C-Values, whereas the SAM and RAM do not
have any constraint to ensure that estimation of FDR is reliable.
27 simulated datasets show that our method works well for ac-
curate estimation of FDR in different sample sizes, different
conditional effects and different ratios of genes differentially ex-
pressed in different biological systems of study. Three real data-
sets also demonstrated that our method performs well even in the
cases of large and unequal sample sizes or very small sample sizes
but large number of genes detected on arrays.

In microarray and transcriptomic experiments, the extremely
large number of genes (the dimensionality of the feature space
reaches tens or even hundreds of thousands) and extremely small
number of biological conditions lead genes to be highly

correlated in expression. This means that such genome-wide
data are highly dependent data. Our simulated and real results
show that the dependence among expressions of genes did not
impact estimation of FDR even though the multiple procedures
are based on independence of hypotheses (the BH theorems).
This is because the estimation of ratio of ﬁndings is also based
on highly correlative expressions of genes.

In theory, not only our step-up or step-down multiple-
procedure can be applicable for any statistical methods but
also our algorithm for choice of C-Values (procedures) can be
generalized to any other statistical tests or is suitable to any data
by changing distributions. For example, if a real dataset is count
data such as transcriptomic data or serial analysis of gene ex-
pression (SAGE) data, then the simulation in our algorithm can
be conducted by choosing appropriate parameters on the
Poisson, gamma, binomial or negative binomial distribution.
But in practice, our method would not be available for cases in
which distribution of statistics is unclear.

In addition, compared with existing large-scale statistical
methods such as SAM (Tusher et al., 2001), RAM (Tan et al.,
2006), ODP (Storey et al., 2007), Cyber T (Baldi and Long,
2001), Limma (Smyth, 2004; Smyth et al., 2005) and q-value
(Storey and Tibshirani, 2003), our method needs more time to
determine parameter values so that the estimated ratio of ﬁnd-
ings is identical or very close to its real ratio across a set of
chosen C-Values chosen, or say, ,80 is proximate to 0 and ,81 to
1. In effect, 6, a and b values can easily be determined by noting
that, as seen in Equation 10, a larger 6-Value would allow much
larger d-Values to be adjusted and a smaller a-value would make
these d-Values become smaller, then more p-Values near the
M-end would become smaller; according to Equation 12, a
larger b-Value would allow differences in all differential expres-
sions between two conditions to be larger, and as a result, more
p-Values near the l-end would be enlarged. Our experience is that
ﬁrst we glance at the difference between the p—Value set and the
p-Value set with 6:a:b: l and determine b-Value so that at
the l-end the p-Values are close to the p—Values. Then we set
a small a—value and adjust 6 so that differences between the
p—Values and p-Values at the M-ends are smaller than a tolerant
value, e. g. 0.01. Also, one can ﬁrst ﬁx a smaller 6-Value and then
adjust a-value. Nevertheless, the constraint condition is that ,80
is close to 0 and ,81 to l.

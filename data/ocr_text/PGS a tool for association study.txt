ABSTRACT

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short single-stranded non-
coding molecules that usually function as negative regulators to
silence or suppress gene expression. Owning to the dynamic nature
of miRNA and reduced microarray and sequencing costs, a growing
number of researchers are now measuring high-dimensional miRNA
expression data using repeated or multiple measures in which each
individual has more than one sample collected and measured over
time. However, the commonly used univariate association testing or
the site-by—site (SBS) testing may underutilize the longitudinal feature
of the data, leading to underpowered results and less biologically
meaningful results.

Results: We propose a penalized regression model incorporating grid
search method (PGS), for analyzing associations of high-dimensional
miRNA expression data with repeated measures. The development of
this analytical framework was motivated by a real-world miRNA dataset.
Comparisons between PGS and the SBS testing revealed that PGS pro-
vided smaller phenotype prediction errors and higher enrichment of
phenotype-related biological pathways than the SBS testing. Our exten-
sive simulations showed that PGS provided more accurate estimates
and higher sensitivitythan the SBS testing with comparable specificities.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short single-stranded RNAs of
nearly 20—24 nt in length that are transcribed from DNA but

not translated into proteins (Singh et al., 2008). Most miRNAs
inhibit the translation of proteins, destabilize their target mes-
senger RNAs (mRNAs) and control many cellular mechanisms
dynamically (Baek et al., 2008; Selbach et al., 2008). Even small
changes in miRNA expression levels may have profound conse-
quences for the expression levels of target genes (Reinsbach et al.,
2012). The dynamic nature of miRNAs distinguishes it from
genetics. Therefore, owing also to the reduced microarray and
sequencing experiments cost, a growing number of researchers
are conducting investigations that measure high-dimensional
miRNA expression data using repeated or multiple measures in
which each individual has more than one sample collected and
measured over time (Chen et al., 2013; Hecker et al., 2013).
Repeated or multiple measures data allow the researcher to ex-
clude miRNA expression variation between individuals depend-
ing on the outcomes and pinpoint the causal role of miRNA
expressions such as longitudinal study design.

The popular site-by—site (SBS) testing using generalized
estimation equation (GEE) (Zeger et al., 1988) or linear mixed
model (LMM) (Henderson et al., 1959) represents a feasible ap-
proach to accommodate the presence of high-dimensional
miRNA expression data measured at different time points. SBS
testing is a type of analysis that performs univariate tests of as-
sociations for each of the biomarker sites, followed by multiple-
testing adjustments, for example, the Bonferroni’s P—value cor-
rection or the false discovery rate (FDR) q-value (Storey and
Tibshirani, 2003). However, this approach is particularly prob-
lematic in high-dimensional miRNA expression data because it
ignores the underlying dependent structure between miRNAs. In
addition, not like genetics, miRNA expressions are modifiable by
environmental factors including diet, air pollution and other ex-
ternal exposures (Hamm et al., 2010). Hence, for better delinea-
tion of the direct effects of miRNAs, adjusting for these
environment factors in models are recommended (Rakyan
et al., 2011). But issues such as overﬁtting, collinearity and
obscuring biomarkers with small effect sizes are usually encoun-
tered in typical regression approaches, e. g. GEE and LMM.
Therefore, computationally feasible methods are required to
tackle these problems.

PGS

 

We propose to apply a variable selection method with speciﬁc
application in high-dimensional miRNA expression data with
repeated or multiple measures. Wang et al. proposed a novel
penalized GEE (PGEE) Wang et al., 2012) method to select
variables when the number of covariates is moderate in a re-
peated or multiple measures setting. PGEE is able to account
for both within subject correlation and dependencies between
different biomarkers. However, PGEE typically fails in the pres-
ence of high-dimensional biomarkers, i.e. when the number of
biomarkers is larger than the sample size. To tackle this issue,
we develop a prescreening-based PGEE with grid search (PGS)
method. Our method consists of an iterative two-step approach.
Step 1, uses the screening method to downsize the biomarkers,
whereas Step 2 feeds the ‘survived’ biomarkers to the PGEE. We
repeat these two steps in a grid search and perform K-fold cross-
validation to determine tuning parameters.

We test our methods in a miRNA proﬁling dataset generated
from our Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study (BTDAS)
(Baccarelli et al., 2011; Byun et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2014;
Hou et al., 2012; 2013a,b). In BTDAS, we measured air pollution
and health outcomes, including lung functions, twice with 1—2
weeks apart. We also collected blood samples twice for bio-
marker measurements, including miRNA proﬁling.

Based on repeated measures miRNA collected in BTDAS, we
apply PGS to model the lung function levels measured by forced
expiratory volume in one second (FEVl), with the goal of de-
tecting lung function-related miRNAs and uncovering regulatory
pathways. We also compare PGS with GEE/LMM SBS testing
in terms of prediction error of lung function levels and enrich-
ment of lung function-related biological pathways. In addition, a
simulation study is conducted to examine the extensions of PGS.

2 METHODS

2.1 Penalized Generalized Estimating Equations

PGEE Wang et al., 2012) has emerged as a useful method for analyzing
repeatedly measured data with a moderate number of covariates. The
algorithm is able to select non-zero effects among a number of predictors
via adding penalty terms to the traditional GEE. The penalized general-
ized estimating functions U(,B) are deﬁned as below:

U03) = 503) - c1 l(|,3|)8ign(l3)

where S(,B) are the estimating functions deﬁning a GEE; qA(|,8|) are the
penalty functions that introduce penalties to each of non-zero ,8 estimate,
so that if certain true 1% are zero, the algorithm would force the estimates
to be zeroes; sign(,8) is the sign vector for ,8. Tuning parameter A within
the penalty functions qA(|,8|), is the coefﬁcient of penalty terms, and it
determines the amount of shrinkage, i.e. bigger A leads to smaller overall
size of estimated effects. To select the effect size that best ﬁts the data, A
will be tuned among a sequence of candidate values using K-fold cross-
validation.

2.2 PGEE with Grid Search

To enhance the reliability of PGEE selection result, we perform PGEE on
a sequence of subsets of the biomarkers based on the ranking of signiﬁ-
cance (e.g. P-values) obtained by a univariate prescreening analysis ad-
justed for confounders. Each time a certain number of top biomarkers
(denoted as Pm) enter the PGEE model, PIn becomes a tuning parameter
and constitute a searching grid together with PGEE penalty parameter A.
By running PGEE throughout all parameter pairs (Pm, A) in the grid, the

best pair would be achieved in terms of the smallest prediction error
calculated by 20-fold cross-validation. With the best parameter pair set-
ting, biomarkers with absolute coefﬁcient (,8) estimates >0.001 were se-
lected as inﬂuential biomarkers.

2.3 Model comparison between PGS and GEE/LMM

Two evaluation matrices were considered in model comparison: pheno-
type prediction performance and enrichment of phenotype-related biolo-
gical pathway.

2.3.1 Phenotype prediction performance Smaller prediction error
indicates better phenotype prediction performances, and thus higher
value of disease diagnosis using the biomarkers selected from a model.
To obtain comparable prediction errors between PGS and SBS testing,
the 10-fold cross-validation procedure used in PGS was implemented to
SBS testing.

2.3.2 Enrichment of phenotype-related biological pathway A
higher enrichment of biological pathway suggests that the sites selected
from a model is biologically plausible. miRNA pathway enrichment ana-
lysis was conducted using DLANA-mirPath v2.0 Wlachos et al., 2012)
(http://www.microrna.gr/miRPathv2), a Web-based computational tool
incorporating an in silico miRNA target prediction tool using high pre-
diction accuracy algorithm DLANA—microT-CDS (Paraskevopoulou
et al., 2013). Gene union set targeted by at least one selected miRNA
was identiﬁed. miRNA— and pathway-related information was obtained
from miRBase 18 (Kozomara and Grifﬁths-Jones, 2011) and KEGG
v58.1 (Kanehisa et al., 2012), respectively. To deﬁne a reliable miRNA-
gene target prediction, microT score threshold >0.9 was used in DIANA-
microT-CDS such that the miRNA-predicted genes were also predicted
by miRanda (John et al., 2004) and/or TargetScan 5.0 (Friedman et al.,
2009). For enrichment tests, we applied Fisher’s Exact test based on
jackkniﬁng the test’s probability (Hosack et al., 2003), which is more
conservative than Fisher’s Exact test so that pathways with fewer targeted
genes are penalized. The Benjamini and Hochberg FDR (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995) was calculated to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing.
Signaling pathways that have been shown to be associated with lung
function were identiﬁed (Zander et al., 2007). The enrichment score of
lung function-related signaling pathway was quantiﬁed using negative
log10 of the FDR.

2.4 Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study

The BTDAS, conducted between June 15 and July 27, 2008, included
participants with high exposure to air pollution in Beijing. All partici-
pants were examined on two separate examination days with 1—2 weeks
apart. Detailed study design and data measurements were described pre-
viously (Baccarelli et al., 2011). Lung function was quantiﬁed by FEVl
on both examination days. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral
blood collected from each participant on both examination days. For
better delineation of the direct effects of miRNAs, 10 potential confoun-
ders including PM2,5, sex, age, BMI, smoking status, usage of central
heating, commuting time, working hours per day, dew point and tem-
perature were adjusted in lung function in GEE/LMM SBS testing and
PGS.

3 RESULTS

3.1 miRNA proﬁling data

We conducted miRNA analysis on 240 blood samples collected
on two examination days separated by a 1—2 week interval from
n = 120 study subjects. Detailed miRNA extraction and proﬁling
data preprocessing can be found in the Supplementary Material.

After normalization and background correction, 568 miRNAs
with complete zero expression level across all 240 blood samples
were removed, leaving 166 valid miRNAs together with the 10
potential confounders in the ﬁnal dataset.

3.2 Identiﬁcation of lung function-related miRNAs with
GEE/LMM SBS testing

GEE/LMM SBS testing with the adjustment of 10 confounders
were applied to each of the 166 miRNAs. Two widely used P-
value adjustment methods for multiple comparisons, BH-FDR
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) and FDR q-value (Storey,
2002), were calculated to account for multiple testing. Only
one miRNA from LMM SBS testing was signiﬁcant using the
conventional signiﬁcant threshold level of 5% FDR
(Supplementary Table S1).

3.3 Identiﬁcation of lung function-related miRNAs
selection with PGS

Before running PGS, all 166 miRNAs were standardized with
mean of zero and standard deviation of one. The ranking of
miRNA signiﬁcance was from a univariate prescreening model
adjusted for confounders using either GEE or LMM. Starting
from the top 10 miRNAs, we increased the number of top PIn
miRNAs by an increment of 20, resulting in eight subsets of
input miRNAs for PGS (PIn = 10, 30,. .., 150) and one add-
itional set of whole miRNAs (PIn = 166). Penalty parameter A
varied from 0.06 to 0.24 by an increment of 0.02. To evaluate the
reliability of the results, we repeated the above procedure for
eight times. We found LMM-based PGS were more stable, as
six of eight repeats yielded the same 10 selected inﬂuential
miRNAs related to lung function with PIn = 110 and A = 0.14,
while GEE-based PGS selection results showed less consistency
across the eight repeats (Supplementary Table S2). The predic-
tion error grid of LMM-based PGS was represented by a heat
map shown in Figure 1.

Each gray-scale block represents a PGEE prediction error under the cor-
responding parameter pair (Pm, A) in the grid. Best selection results were
achieved when incorporating top 110 miRNAs (PIn = 110) deﬁned by
LMM prescreening model with PGEE penalty parameter A = 0.14

3.4 Model comparison between PGS and GEE/LMM
SBS testing

3.4.1 Lung function prediction performance For the purpose of
model comparison, we selected a sequential number of the top
ranking (top 5, 10, 15 and 20) miRNAs based on P—values as the
identiﬁed miRNAs using SBS testing. Comparing with the lowest
prediction errors of SBS testing that were achieved using the top
10 miRNAs (mean error = 5.4 for GEE and 6.1 for LMM),
paired t-tests showed that PGS yielded a signiﬁcantly lower pre-
diction error (mean error = 5.3) (Table 1).

3.4.2 Enrichment of lung function-related biological
pathways We further evaluated enrichment of phenotype-
related biological pathways of both PGS and SBS testing.
Seven laboratory-proven KEGG signaling pathways related to
lung function were identiﬁed (Zander et al., 2007). The 10 inﬂu-
ential miRNAs selected by LMM-based PGS were used to rep-
resent the PGS approach. We also chose the top 10 miRNAs
from GEE/LMM SBS testing, respectively, so that the three
approaches yielded comparable amount of target genes.
miRNAs identiﬁed by all three approaches were enriched in
mTOR, PI3K-Akt, ErbB, Wnt and MAPK signaling pathways.
In general, enrichment score of the genes targeted by miRNAs
from PGS was higher than that from GEE SBS testing, and
considerably higher than that from LMM SBS testing (Fig. 2),
indicating miRNAs selected by PGS were more biologically
plausible.

3.5 Simulation study

A simulation study was conducted to compare the performance
of PGS and SBS testing in more general settings. Scenario I was
comparable with the BTDAS miRNA dataset we studied with
n = 120 subjects and number of miRNAs p = 200. Scenario II
had a higher number of miRNAs p = 800 but with a smaller
sample size of 60. We assumed that there were 5% of miRNAs
with true non-zero effects (i.e. 10 for Scenario I and 40 for
Scenario II). Corresponding 10 times 10 tuning parameter grids
were set, PIn = (20, 40, . . . , 200) andA = (0.010, 0.025, . . . , 0.145)
in Scenario I and PtH = (10, 20, . . ., 100) and A = (0.010,
0.025,. . ., 0.145) in Scenario II. Pm> 100 in Scenario 11 would
not yield reliable selection results because of the relatively small
sample size. Performance of GEE/LMM SBS testing as well as
GEE-based and LMM-based PGS under Scenario I was shown
in Table 2. Scatterplot of receiver operating characteristic can be
found in Supplementary Figure S1. PGS had >90% chance to
identify effect with size as small as 0.3, whereas SBS testing was
good till effect size was ~0.6. Moreover, PGS provided more
accurate estimates even for small effects. On average, PGS esti-
mates only had 0.01 and 0.03 deviation from the true effects in
GEE-based and LMM-based PGS, respectively. PGS gave a
much higher sensitivity (>0.80) than SBS testing with compar-
able speciﬁcity (>0.95). For Scenario II, owing to the difﬁculties
in detecting 40 non-zero miRNAs with sample size of 80, both
SBS testing and PGS methods did not perform ideally. However,
there was still signiﬁcant gain from PGS over SBS testing
(Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Fig. S1).

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we proposed and applied PGS method to handle
high-dimensional miRNA expression data with repeated meas-
ures. We compared performances of the PGS and the traditional
SBS testing. PGS performed consistently better than GEE/LMM
SBS testing in terms of higher phenotype prediction perfor-
mance, higher enrichment of phenotype-related biological path-
way, more accurate estimates, and higher sensitivity. One of the
regularity conditions for PGEE algorithm is that p = O(n),
which requires the number of predictors (p) in model, should
be comparable with the sample size (n). To ensure the tuning
penalty parameter (A) yields an overall effect size estimation
that best ﬁts the data and avoid exceeded number of input bio-
markers (Pm) for PGEE algorithm, we incorporated the grid
search method. A 20-fold cross-validation was implemented to
determine the best PGEE selection results in terms of the smallest
prediction error among the parameter searching grid (Pm, A).
Though PGS has a relatively high computational intensity, the

Note: Mean estimates were calculated from the 100 simulation runs, respectively.
Number of selections were the number of times each true effect selected by models
out of the 100 runs. Sensitivity and speciﬁcity for each method were the average for
all 100 runs. RMSE is root mean square error between mean estimates and true
effects, which describes mean accuracy of the model estimates.

most common and systematic way, as we have done in current
study, is through the cross-validation, which is well documented
in other established penalized models LASSO and elastic net
(Zou and Hastie, 2005). PGS is a data-driven and self-training
analytical framework that can achieve maximum data utilization
while constraining model complexity simultaneously.

One key merit of PGS is its capacity to handle a multitude of
biomarkers at the same time and select the inﬂuential ones.
Using SBS testing, we only found few ‘signiﬁcant’ results after
having corrected for a high number of multiple testing. While
using PGS, we identiﬁed a set of inﬂuential and meaningful
miRNAs without encountering multiple testing issues, which
offers a novel perspective in analyzing high-dimensional data
with repeated measures. Another distinct advantage of PGS is
that it considers all informative biomarkers as a whole instead of
treating them individually. Using the SBS testing, although some
miRNAs successfully pass the multiple testing, it is possible that
meaningful biological events might not even be detected because
of the correlations and interactions among miRNAs. However,

the effects of these biomarkers could be signiﬁcant when mod-
eled together. PGS is able to capture these complex features
across all input biomarkers and detect inﬂuential ones that
SBS testing would potentially ignore.

It is worth noting that PGS does not provide exact P—values, as
the estimates do not follow normal distribution under the null
hypotheses. Therefore, the criterion for determining inﬂuential
biomarker in PGS is not based on P—value, but on the threshold
for coefﬁcient (,6) estimates of biomarkers. Inﬂuential bio-
markers are selected when the estimates are greater than the
threshold. As suggested in Wang’s paper WVang et al., 2012),
the default threshold is 0.001, which is also proved to be a prac-
tical and robust threshold in our simulation study in terms of
sensitivity and speciﬁcity. To ensure that the threshold of 0.001
works uniformly for any dataset, it is required to standardize
each of the biomarkers with mean of zero and standard deviation
of one as a typical procedure before running penalize model.

Robust selection of biomarkers by PGS relies on the setting of
grid boundary and grid resolution. Too large A would shrink all
,6 estimates to zero, whereas too small A would not shrink the
estimates at all. Our numerical experience in similar settings sug-
gests that a range of A from 0.01 to 0.30 should cover the optimal
A for most of the cases. Within this range, an increment of 0.02 in
A provides a proper grid resolution to capture subtle effect
changes of A on biomarker selection results without much
extra computational burden. On the other hand, a too large
PIn might defy the application of PGS, whereas a too small PIn
might underexploit the data. An optimal PIn could be found
around the sample size, as is the case in our miRNA study ex-
ample, where the optimal PIn = 110. Besides, an increment of 10
or 20 in PIn provides a sufﬁcient resolution for capturing the
effects of increasing PIn on biomarker selection. For all practical
usage, the initiation of A vector can be varied from 0.01 to 0.30,
and the initiation of PIn can be a vector with a few numbers
varied around the sample size minus the number of confounders
(in our case, it is 120— 10 = 110). It is not necessary to initiate a
full vector of Pm, as it adds redundant parameter pairs to the
grid. Extension of A boundary and/ or PIn boundary will be con-
sidered only when the optimal A and/ or PIn hit the initial bound-
aries. In this article, we used different elaborate A ranges (but all
were within the 0.01—0.30 range) for better results representa-
tions, and higher grid resolution (i.e. smaller increment of A)
for more reliable method evaluations in simulation studies.

Insensitive to mis-speciﬁcation of the covariance structure is a
feature that distinguishes GEE from LMM. Inheriting this fea-
ture from GEE, PGS is able to estimate the correlation matrix
regardless of whether the structure is speciﬁed. Based on the
estimation, one could either use LMM-based PGS with a solid
guess of the covariance structure or use GEE-based PGS if there
is no good choice of the structure.

Prescreening step prioritizes potentially inﬂuential biomarkers,
which facilitates PGS to handle the situation in which the
number of biomarkers is considerably larger than the sample
size. GEE and LMM are two handy approaches for prescreen-
ing. However, the potential limitation of prescreening is that
miRNAs with small but true non-zero effects may be excluded
during the prescreening step. Nevertheless, with a given sample
size, the grid search method in PGS ensures that PGEE can
include as many biomarkers as possible.

5 CONCLUSION

The performance of PGS is comparable with the approaches
being benchmarked, i.e. SBS GEE/LMM. However, PGS is
more suitable for high-dimensional miRNA expression data
with repeated measures in that, by exploiting underlying depend-
ent structures, it relies on variable selection in the context of a
multiple regression model, which circumvents multiple testing
issues. PGS is also applicable to other longitudinally collected
high-dimensional quantitative data, such as epigenomics, mRNA
transcriptornics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc. The growing
number of studies conducting high-dimensional proﬁling dataset
using different platforms requires a more comprehensive evalu-
ation of PGS in various study settings.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Signaling networks mediate responses to different stimuli
using a multitude of feed-fonNard, feedback and cross-talk mechan-
isms, and malfunctions in these mechanisms have an important role in
various diseases. To understand a disease and to help discover novel
therapeutic approaches, we have to reveal the molecular mechanisms
underlying signal transduction and use that information to design tar-
geted perturbations.

Results: We have pursued this direction by developing an efficient
computational approach, Sorad, which can estimate the structure of
signal transduction networks and the associated continuous signaling
dynamics from phosphoprotein time-course measurements. Further,
Sorad can identify experimental conditions that modulate the signaling
toward a desired response. We have analyzed comprehensive
phosphoprotein time-course data from a human hepatocellular liver
carcinoma cell line and demonstrate here that Sorad provides more
accurate predictions of phosphoprotein responses to given stimuli
than previously presented methods and, importantly, that Sorad can
estimate experimental conditions to achieve a desired signaling re-
sponse. Because Sorad is data driven, it has a high potential to gen-
erate novel hypotheses for further research. Our analysis of the
hepatocellular liver carcinoma data predict a regulatory connection
where AKT activity is dependent on IKK in TGFoz stimulated cells,
which is supported by the original data but not included in the original
model.

ods will be available at http://research.ics.aalto.fi/csb/software/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Binding of the ligand on the cell surface receptor initiates a sig-
naling cascade that is propagated via several parallel pathways

signaling proteins. Building a mechanistic understanding of sig-
naling pathway dynamics from experimental data has remained
challenging for several reasons. Although mass spectrometry—
based techniques have witnessed considerable progress recently,
it is laborious to measure active forms of proteins in a highly
quantitative and high-throughput manner. Furthermore, un-
raveling functional interactions between phosphoproteins de-
mands a large number of experiments where the key signaling
molecules are perturbed, or even co-perturbed, by using direct
gene knockouts, gene knockdowns, speciﬁc inhibitors or other
external stimuli.

A number of different computational strategies have been
proposed to model signal transduction. A methodology based
on Bayesian networks for describing the interconnections be-
tween signaling proteins has been used to study T cell signaling
(Sachs et al., 2005). Similarly, Aldridge et al. (2009) used an
approach based on fuzzy logic, an extension to the two valued
Boolean algebra, to study the downstream signaling of tumor
necrosis factor, epidermal growth factor and insulin receptors.
While logic-based approaches provide models that are easy to
interpret and analyze computationally, they do not allow bio-
physically motivated mechanistic modeling approaches, which
inevitably require the use of dynamic and continuous models of
signaling networks (reviewed in Aldridge et al., 2006;
Chakraborty and Das, 2010). Ordinary differential equations
(ODE), which represent the average of detailed chemical reac-
tion models in a cell population, have thus become preferable
in studies focusing on signaling dynamics. For example,
Chaudhri et a]. (2010) constructed an ODE model to describe
receptor-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling
based on prior biological knowledge about the network struc-
ture, and also identiﬁed a novel regulatory motif. Reverse en-
gineering of dynamic models of molecular networks has also
been extensively studied in the context of transcriptional regu-
lation, and several ODE modeling methods have been proposed
(Aijo and Lahdesm'aki, 2009; Bansal et al., 2006; Bonneau
et al., 2006; Cantone et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2008; Honkela
et al., 2010; Titsias et al., 2012). Our approach differs from the
previous methods by using continuous non-parametric dy-
namics and, importantly, by providing a way to modulate net-
work’s response as described below.

A far-reaching goal is to use mathematical models and compu-
tational methods to modulate signaling pathway responses in
healthy and diseased conditions. For example, Mitsos et al.
(2009) attempted to detect drug targets from phosphoproteomic
data by identifying changes in a pathway induced by a treatment
relative to an untreated control. Given the complexity of signaling
pathway dynamics, accurate modulation strategies inevitably re-
quire the use of a mechanistic model of network dynamics. Model-
based intervention approaches have been studied in the context of
probabilistic Boolean network models (Shmulevich et al., 2002),
but there is an interest on how the intervention strategies can be
implemented for continuous and dynamical models.

Here, we present a ﬂexible non-parametric ODE model and
propose an efﬁcient and scalable network structure learning
algorithm to identify signaling pathways and their dynamics
from phosphoprotein data. This modeling method, called
Sorad, assumes the standard ODE formulation but alleviates
the detailed parametric model speciﬁcations by using non-
parametric functions. This has important consequences for the
signaling pathway reconstruction as we have to estimate only the
kinetic parameters at and A and the hyperparameters of the co-
variance function, but no parameters directly related to the regu-
latory functions. When applied to previously unseen stimuli,
Sorad provides quantitatively accurate signaling pathway re-
sponses. More importantly, we show how Sorad can be used
to design interventions for the modulation of said pathway’s re-
sponse and dynamics. This novel and unique method enabling
the design of optimal stimuli (e.g. receptor stimuli, drug treat-
ment) encourages the discovery of new methodologies for experi-
mental design, drug discovery and therapeutic applications. To
demonstrate Sorad’s performance, we make use of the DREAM
project, an initiative to foster collaboration between experimen-
tal and computational biologists (Prill et al., 2011), and validate
our predictions on independent experimental data from a human
carcinoma cell line (part of DREAM4) originally published in
(Alexopoulos et al., 2010; Saez-Rodriguez et al., 2009).

2 METHODS

2.1 A non-parametric and probabilistic model for
continuous signaling pathway dynamics

Full description and derivation of the computational methods can be
found from Supplementary Material. We model signaling pathway dy-
namics using ﬁrst-order linear ODEs where the non-linear driving function
for each phosphoprotein x,- is unknown. The time-dependent phosphoryl-
ation level for each phosphoprotein is modeled using three components:

50(1) =fi(t) + 051' — M300) (1)

where x,(t) is level of the ith (i = 1,. . . , N) phosphoprotein at time t, 36,-(1)
denotes the time derivative, 0:, is the basal rate, which captures the con-
stant (non-zero) part of the phosphoprotein data, A,- is the degradation
rate, which models spontaneous decrease or degradation of phosphopro-
tein level, f,- is the non-parametric regulatory function, which generates
the dynamic changes in the phosphoprotein level by time (a.k.a. models
the actual signaling mechanism). We set a Gaussian process prior over
regulatory functions f,- to prefer smooth functions. We assume that in-
active form of the protein is not limiting the rate of phosphorylation.
Traditional ODE modeling approaches typically encounter problems
with parameter estimation and model structure comparison because
neither of those have analytically tractable closed form solutions

(except special cases). As is explained below, the analytical solution,
which is inherited from the Gaussian process formulation, is one of our
main motivations because we can thus avoid problems associated with
parameter estimation steps, have an analytical model selection score and
have a build-in regularization via the Bayesian analysis. Moreover, our
chosen formulation also allows efﬁcient experimental design.

2.2 Deﬁning signaling network dynamics

For a given (ﬁxed) signaling pathway structure, the key challenge is to
deﬁne the non-parametric functions such that the signaling network dy-
namics agree with experimental data. Previously, a similar estimation
problem for non-parametric functions f,- has been solved in the context
of a discrete-time system (Penfold et al., 2012) or using the ﬁrst-order
approximation of the derivative (Aijo and Lahdesmaki, 2009). Here, we
develop a probabilistic estimation method for continuous dynamics using
a two-step approach, as illustrated inside the topmost rounded rectangle
in Supplementary Figure S10. The ﬁrst step is to identify the driving
functions, including basal rate, degradation rate and regulatory function
as a function of time only, f,(t). This step is done independently for each
of the measured phosphoproteins by solving the non-parametric ODE
model in continuous time such that the obtained function x,(t) explain the
measurements as accurately as possible, a step that only requires meas-
urements of the corresponding phosphoprotein. Conceptually, when con-
sidered as a function of time, the non-parametric regulatory function tells
for any time point the instantaneous rate of (de)phosphorylation needed
to obtain the observed dynamics. The phosphorylation level of x,- can be
solved to yield

. l
x,(t) = % + cite—M + / f,(t)e_Ai(’_T)dt (2)
i 0

where c,- depends on the initial condition at t=0. We assume that the
time-dependent driving function f,- is different for each experimental con-
dition but phosphoprotein-speciﬁc kinetic parameters at, and A, (as well as
hyperparameters of the Gaussian process) are shared over different con-
ditions. The linear integral transformation applied to the function f,- in
Equation (2) preserves the Gaussian process property of f,. Thus, the
process x,- is also a Gaussian process, i.e. x,(t) ~ 973(mx,(t),kx,,x,(t, t’)),
where the mean is

mm =  + c.- exp(—x.-t) (3)

and the covariance function kx,,x,(t, t’) is shown in Supplementary
Equation (24). The kinetic parameters at, and A, and hyperparameters
are estimated by optimizing the (log) marginal likelihood of the data,
which can be written as

1
10gp(XilT, 6) = — E (x. — mx,)T(Kx,,x, + as, ,I)—1(x. — m...)
4
l 2 n ( )
— 510g |Kxbxi + omill — 510g 271

where x, contains the phosphoprotein measurements for x,, T is a vector
of measurement time indices, 6 represents the parameters and hyper par-
ameters, mx, is a vector of values of mx, evaluated at T, K9,”, is the
covariance matrix between x,- and x,- evaluated at T, oil. denotes the
measurement noise variance for x,, and n denotes the number of meas-
urement time points. For partial derivatives of Equation (4), see
Supplementary Equations (36—41). Finally, the driving functions f,- are
estimated using the posterior means. In particular, predictive equations
for f,- can be written in the standard form (omitting the phosphoprotein
index i in the following)

f,k |x, T, T.k ~ N(f*, Cov(f*)), where

ik : Kﬁx(T>l<9 T)Kx,x(Ts D—lxs and

Cov(f*) = Kﬁ/(T*, T,) — Kﬁxm, T)K,,,,,(T, T)‘1K,,,/(T, T,)

Quantitative modeling and modulation of signaling pathways

 

where Kﬁx is the covariance matrix between f,- and x,- evaluated at T, f.k
denotes the points to be predicted and f... is our ﬁnal estimate (see deriv-
ations in Supplementary Material and Supplementary Equation (11) for
details). As a result, we get the estimated values for the kinetic parameters
at,- and A,- and the condition-dependent functions f,- for each
phosphoprotein.

The second step ﬁnds a mapping from measured phosphoprotein time-
course proﬁles of a speciﬁc set of regulatory proteins to the inferred time-
dependent regulatory function. This is done with the following regression
model:

19(1) = gi(xf-eg(t)) (5)

where x§6g(t) = (x,1 (t), . . . , x,k(t)) denotes the activities of k phosphopro-
teins at time t regulating the phosphoprotein x,- and g,- is an unknown
non-parametric function with Gaussian process prior. Function g,- is esti-
mated using the Gaussian process regression at measurement time points.
The so. ﬁnal g,- function will be reﬁned during the validation step together
with the construction of the ﬁnal network structure. While f functions
need to be estimated separately for each experiment, for the estimation of
g we use all experiments together and ﬁnd a mapping from regulatory
phosphoproteins to the target protein that explains all the experimental
(training) data. In other words, g functions represent the actual mechan-
isms that propagate signal through the network. A schematic diagram of
the model and its inference is shown in Supplementary Figure S25.

2.3 Unraveling signaling pathway model from data

The above model inference applies for a given ﬁxed signaling pathway
structure, which is completely speciﬁed by the functions g,- and their
inputs xieg. Fortunately, we can iteratively apply the second step to dif-
ferent combinations of regulatory signaling components xieg to assess the
conﬁdence in each network structure. In this study, we use Bayesian and
cross-validation approaches to rank different signaling network struc-
tures. In addition, we use the information included in f functions.

In each of the cross-validation cycles, the alternative models are ﬁtted
to the training data and the corresponding prediction performances are
assessed using the test data. Note that we use only the original training
data for model ﬁtting. For Bayesian analysis, we need the marginal like-
lihoods of different models, which for Gaussian process—based regression
in Equation (5) can be written analytically

— l—T _ — 1 n
logp(f|T,6) = —f Kﬁ/(T,T) lf—Elog‘Kﬁ/(T,T)l —§log2jr

where 6 represents the hyperparameters, and 6 is again optimized by
maximizing the marginal likelihood [see Supplementary Material and
Supplementary Equations (43—46) for partial derivatives]. In addition
to the built-in regularization rising from the use of marginal likelihood,
we noticed a need for penalizing the models, which are composed of
many explanatory variables. We deﬁned a prior distribution for the sig-
naling networks in a similar way as in the Akaike information criterion
that penalizes models based on the number of variables, i.e.
p(M) oc exp(—2k), where k is the number of directed connections in a
network structure M, and kmax is a maximum number of explanatory
variables to be considered. As a result of cross-validation and Bayesian
analysis, we obtain scores for different signaling networks, which can be
summarized to pair-wise relationship between phosphoproteins by sum-
ming the scores of all model structures that contain a speciﬁc directed
interaction. These scores can be used to rank links between proteins.
The estimated functions f are also used to choose the signaling network
structure for two reasons. First, cross-validation and Bayesian
approaches depend on our choice of models of the perturbations (e.g. un-
known dynamics of external cytokine and growth factor perturbations),
whereas the analysis on f functions does not. Second, cross-validation and
Bayesian approaches would fail to identify phosphorylation events that
are active only in a single experiment. The f function represents the

instantaneous rate of change of a phosphoprotein. If our method infers
remarkably different dynamics for f in a single time-series experiment,
that gives evidence for dependencies that are likely observable only under
that particular condition. Thus, hierarchical clustering analysis is done
using average linkage and the Euclidean distance over f functions to
reveal dependencies between f functions and perturbations. Clustering
can be interpret by looking at how different growth factor stimulations
cluster separately if any of the clusters get higher or lower f values, and
whether certain upstream inhibitions cause f functions to cluster into
another cluster with lower/higher values than f functions in an uninhib-
ited case under the same growth factor stimulation.

The ﬁnal dynamical system we obtain by interchanging the functions f,-
in Equation (1) with the functions g,- can be expressed in a vector form as

X(I) = g(X(I)) + 0! — diag(l)X(l) (6)

Wh€f€ X0) = (X1(I),X2(I), ---9XN(I))T9 306(1)) = (g1(X§eg(l)), 32(X36g(l)),
..,gN(x§§g(t)))T and the kinetic parameters at = (011,052, ...,ozN) and
A = (21,22, ...,AN)T. This system can be solved numerically over time

given the perturbations and the initial activity levels of the phosphopro-
teins x(0). Occasionally, predictions can be negative, which in this study
were truncated to zero by biological reasoning.

2.4 Prediction of interventions

Note that given perturbations and initial activity levels of the phospho-
proteins, it is a trivial task to simulate the behavior of the dynamic system
in Equation (5) over time using, for example, Euler’s method. However, a
much harder problem is to estimate the perturbations given the desired
behavior of a system over time. The problem can be stated as follows:
Given a desired time proﬁle of a target protein’s activity level, estimate
the time proﬁles of one or several of its regulatory proteins to achieve the
desired signaling response. We propose a novel method to design inter-
ventions, which consists of two-step solution. First, given the desired
behavior of the target protein )9, estimate the regulatory function j}(t)
as explained above. Second, estimate the initial values of the inputs xjeg to
the function g in such a way that it approximates the ideal phosphoryl-
ation function 13(1) as well as possible. Because the analytically tractable
Gaussian processes properties apply to the system state x,- as well as to the
regulatory functions f,- and g,, our modeling framework is particularly
well suited to design modulation strategies. The task of predicting inter-
ventions can be seen as an inversion of a Gaussian process. For the sake
of simplicity, let us consider situation of a single test point t.k 6 [RP , i.e. the
inputs are p-dimensional, and the training data is composed of the train-
ing inputs T (i.e. phosphorylation time-course data) and outputs g. In
that case, the predictive equation for a single test point is (Rasmussen and
Williams, 2006)

g* = Kg,g(Ts t*)Kg,g(Ts D—lg (7)

where Kg, g(T, t...) e [RIXN holds the covariances between N training points
and the test point t..,. Now, if we turn the traditional situation the other
way around, i.e. we assume that we know the desired output (denoted as
g...) but we do not know the value of the test point t.k (input). From
Equation (7) we notice that the only term that depends on t.k is the
vector Kg,g(T,t*). Each of the elements in the vector Kg,g(T,t*) are
given by the covariance function kgug, e.g. ith element is the covariance
between the ith training input and the test point t..,. Using the mean
square error criterion, we can then write the optimization problem for
perturbations as

arg mm Hg... — Kg,g(T, t*)Kg,g(T9 T)_lg||2 (8)

In other words, the optimal perturbation corresponds to the initial
phosphoprotein levels t..,, which minimize Equation (8). Additionally,
the search for optimal perturbations in Equation (8) can be combined

with the uncertainty of the predictions (see Supplementary Material for
details).

Overall, Sorad’s computational complexity has two major steps. First,
inference of dynamics, network structure and interventions all involve
inversions of covariance matrices, which have no more than cubic asymp-
totic time complexity. Second, for each phosphoprotein, inference for
dynamics and regulatory proteins need to be applied for all 2N combin-
ations of regulatory proteins. Thus, for large signaling networks, an
upper bound on the number of regulatory proteins needs to be set,
hence reducing the exponential term to a polynomial time complexity.
Owing to the design of Sorad, however, the estimation of the f and g
functions is an embarrassingly parallel problem and thus the combina-
torially increasing computational load can be distributed.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Phosphoprotein time course from HepG2 cell line

In our training dataset, previously published in (Alexopoulos
et al., 2010), four cytokines or growth factors (IGFl,
TGFa, ILla and TNFa) were individually used to stimulate
hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. In addition, inhibitors
for MEKl/2, p38, PI3K and IKK proteins were used to dissect
the upstream regulators for the measured proteins, resulting in
altogether (4 + l) x (4 + l) = 25 different conditions. The activ-
ity levels of seven phosphoproteins, namely ERKl/2, HSP27,
JNKl/2, IKB, MEKl/2, p38 and AKT, were monitored in the
25 different conditions in a time-series manner, measurements
being taken at 0, 30 and 180 min. For the test dataset, we use
an independent time-course dataset from (Alexopoulos et al.,
2010), which includes the same set of seven phosphoproteins
with 5 x 4 = 20 different perturbations: the inhibitions were
ﬁve different pairs of individual perturbations, namely
p38 4— MEKl/2, PI3K+MEKl/2, p38 +PI3K, p38 +IKK and
PI3K—I—IKK, and the stimuli were ILla, IGFl, TGFa and the
pair TGFa —I— IGFl.

3.2 Modeling HepG2 phosphoprotein dynamics

We ﬁrst estimated values of the at and A parameters for each of
the seven phosphoproteins (Supplementary Table S1). For ex-
ample, based on the model ﬁtted to the data, HSP27 has the
lowest basal rate. A closer manual inspection on the data sup-
ports this ﬁnding, i.e. the level of HSP27 is low overall and is
only activated when stimulated with ILla (Supplementary Fig.
S7). Similar reasoning can be done for the low basal rates of
ERKl/2, IKB, JNKl/2 and p38.

The estimated regulatory functions f for AKT is visualized in
Figure 1 (for other phosphoproteins see Supplementary Figs
S3—S8). A separate subplot is shown for each of the individual
experimental settings, including the experiment-speciﬁc measure-
ments, f function and the continuous proﬁle of the phosphory-
lated AKT level. It is evident that the estimated functions are
non-linear, and moreover, that they could not be approximated
with linear functions without drastic effects, emphasizing the
suitability of the presented non-parametric methodology.

Recall that g is an approximation for the set of functions f, and
it is a function of activity levels of regulatory phosphoproteins in
contrast to functions f that were functions of time. It was found
out that the behavior of f functions, e.g. for ERKl/2, are best
explained by altogether three variables, TGFa, MEKl/2 and

g for ERKl/2 is shown in Supplementary Figure S9. The top-
most part of the ﬁgure illustrates the estimated outputs of f and g
functions across the 25 different experiments, and the lower part
visualizes the values of the explanatory variables. The initial
boost in the activation of ERKl /2 is explained by the stimulation
of TGFa receptor, and its effect is mediated by MEKl/2.

3.3 Unraveling the cell-type—specific signaling network

Altogether three types of criteria were used to reveal the data-
supported relationships between the phosphoproteins: prediction
performance (cross-validation), ﬁt of the model (marginal likeli-
hood) and effects of individual perturbations (clustering of f
functions). The data-supported conﬁdences of the relationships
for ERKl/2 are shown in Figure 2A and B. The marginal like-
lihood and cross-validation scores suggest that the changes in the
activity level of ERKl/2 are well explained by the activity levels
of ERKl/2, MEKl/2 and TGFa. It is interesting to see that
ERKl /2 is the strongest hit from the cross-validation—based ana-
lysis, i.e. has the lowest negative log-likelihood score among the
possible regulators. As another example, Figure 2C and D shows
the data-supported conﬁdences of the relationships for IKB. In
Figure 2C, both of the analyses suggest that the activation level
of IKB and IKK and the perturbation status of ILla are good
predictors of the activation of IKB. The regulatory role of TNFa
is suggested by the marginal likelihood—based analysis although
it was less evident according to the cross-validation results.
Moreover, the roles of ILla, TNFa and IKK are supported by
the results of the hierarchical clustering of f functions as

wise relationships for the target protein ERK1/2. The relationships with
small scores are more reliable and are preferred. (B) The hierarchical
clustering of f functions of ERK1/2 for all perturbations (indicated on
the left) in the training data. TGFoz-stimulated samples form a separate
cluster with higher f function values, suggesting that TGFoz activates
ERK1/2. However, the f function under TGFoz-stimulated MEK—in-
hibited conditions have lower values and clusters into another cluster,
suggesting that MEKl/2 mediates the activating effects of TGFoz.
According to all the results, TGFoz, MEKl/2 and ERK1/2 itself regulate
ERK1/2 activity. Inhibition is denoted with the character ‘i’ at the end of
the protein names (e.g. MEKi). (C and D) The same analysis when the
target is IKB

illustrated in Figure 2D, as the stimulation of either ILla or
TNFa receptors discriminate f functions but this does not hold
when IKK has been inhibited. Therefore, it can be concluded
that IKB, ILla, TNFa and IKK is the best set of explanatory
variables that are used to predict the activity level of IKB.
Some of the dependencies between the phosphoproteins are
only observable in one condition, e.g. mediating role of p38 in
the activation of HSP27 when ILla is used for stimulation (see
Supplementary Fig. S7). In these cases, the cross-validation fails
because the dependency is only observable in the training data or
test data but not in both. However, the marginal likelihood—
based approach and the clustering of f functions reveal these
unique relationships and are hence used to supplement cross-
validation. The computational method for combining the mar-
ginal likelihood—, cross-validation— and clustering-based infor-
mation is not fully automatic, although such an approach
could be developed. Our view on the approach is such that,
owing to the diversity of interactions between signaling proteins,
it is better to produce useful and orthogonal data for the user
and to allow partial manual control, combined with biological

knowledge, to reason about the signaling events as demonstrated
above.

The data-supported network model of the signal transduction
in the HepG2 cell line is shown in Figure 3 where no biological
prior knowledge was used. In this study, the estimation of g
functions cover all the models from a single explanatory variable
up to the models consisting of six explanatory variables.
Regulatory relationships downstream of proteins that forward
the signal from the receptors to the pathway end points have
been marked by dashed edges. Supplementary Figure S19 has
been modiﬁed from Figure 3 by drawing the arrows coming
from the cytokines or growth factors only to the mediating up-
stream regulators. Most of the inferred interactions are sup-
ported by the literature. For example, the mediating role of
p38 in ILla-induced activation of HSP27 was inferred correctly
(Alexopoulos et al., 2010). Interestingly, our model predicted
donwstream signaling to be dependent on the original growth
factor stimuli, whereas many models predict that signal is pro-
pagated in a similar manner in the network once it is initiated.
However, it is really the case in cellular biology that initial stimuli
can affect the outcome because each growth factor regulates dif-
ferently the receptors and adaptor proteins that mediate the
signal transduction. In principle it is possible to model this, but
all the necessary information is not available at the moment. The
fact that proteins can be regulated from several sites complicates
their behavior even further. In addition, different signaling path-
ways can crosstalk together generating (in)activation effects on
adjacent pathways. This all underlines the importance of model-
ing the signal transduction in stimulus-dependent manner.

3.4 Sorad provides accurate predictions

The ability of Sorad to predict phosphoprotein activity levels in a
signaling pathway is illustrated in Supplementary Figure S10.
First, the optimal model topology is inferred as described
above, and its dynamics are learned from the whole training
data. The model can then be initialized with different phospho-
protein levels and perturbation conﬁgurations, and the response
of the system can be solved numerically. The third challenge in
the DREAM4 was to unravel a signaling network based on ex-
perimental data, and the model ﬁt was assessed by the prediction
performance. The task was to predict the activity levels of the
phosphoproteins at 30 min after the initiation of cytokine stimuli
given the initial activity levels of the phosphoproteins and the
information about the perturbations. The goal of the challenge is
to ﬁnd the best predictive model with the minimal number of
connections in the signal transduction network.

Table 1 lists the results of Sorad and the four best performing
teams from DREAM4. All the attributes listed in Table l are
computed as in DREAM4 and are explained in ‘Performance
metrics’ section in Supplementary Material. Sorad performed
well because it had the best prediction score as well as the smal-
lest number of edges in the network. The best performer in the
DREAM4 challenge used a methodology formulated within a
Boolean logic framework (Eduati et al., 2010). The ﬁrst step in
their method statistically identiﬁes whether a certain perturb-
ation has an effect on the phosphorylation of a given protein
(binary decision) and constructs a Boolean network model.
In the second step, they link these inferred relationships with

the experimental data by combining linearly the observed effects
of the perturbations. The second top best performing team also
developed a two-step approach: a parametric linear ODE model
is ﬁrst used to infer the topology of the signaling pathway and
this model is used as the starting point for a predeﬁned non-
linear ODE model that is ﬁtted to the experimental data (The
New York Academic of Sciences, 2009).

The performance metric p-values show that the activity levels
of AKT are the most challenging to predict. To study this more
closely, we have visualized the test set measurements together
with our predictions for AKT in Figure 4A. The largest differ-
ences between the measurements and the predictions are due to
the underestimated stimulative effect of TGFa and IGFl. As

AKT lies downstream of TGFa, IGFl, PI3K and IKK
(Fig. 3), it is important that cooperative effects of the perturb-
ations are estimated correctly.

Figure 4B shows Sorad’s predictions and the test set measure-
ments for MEKl /2 across the 15 test conditions. The cooperative
effect of TGFa and IGFl receptors is challenging for modeling
because the stimulation of IGFl growth factor alone is not suf-
ﬁcient to activate MEKl/2. However, Sorad can capture this
non-linear co-operativity well. The corresponding predictions
for other ﬁve phosphoproteins are visualized in Supplementary
Figures Sll—S15. Taken together, we conclude that proposed
non-parametric ODE model provides a predictive modeling
framework that is generally quantitatively accurate.

3.5 Upstream regulators of AKT

We identiﬁed AKT as an interesting candidate protein for a
more detailed analysis. We studied the effect of different perturb-
ations on the activity level of AKT based on the training data
(Supplementary Fig. Sl6A). Interestingly, the model suggests
that TGFa or IGFl stimulation induces approximately the
same level of AKT activity. Similarly, we notice that the inhib-
ition of PI3K has a greater negative inﬂuence on the activation of
AKT than the inhibition of IKK, regardless of whether TGFa or
IGFl stimulation is used, which is in accordance with the PI3K-
dependent activation of AKT (Chin and Toker, 2009).
Strikingly, supporting a ﬁnding previously reported in (Eduati
et al., 2010), AKT activation is dependent on IKK inhibition
when TGFa receptor is stimulated (Supplementary Fig. S16).
High speciﬁcity of the inhibitor (Burke et al., 2003) and
TGFa-assiocated regulation suggests that the observed IKK-
AKT interaction is not caused by unspeciﬁc side effects.

Quantitative modeling and modulation of signaling pathways

 

The IKK-dependent activation of AKT on TGFa stimulation
is supported by both the training and the independent test
data. For example, when TGFa receptor is stimulated, AKT
activity decreases only on inhibition of IKK, PI3K or both,
whereas IKK-dependent activation of AKT cannot be observed
in IGF1-stimulated cells (Figs 1 and 4A and Supplementary
Fig. S16).

3.6 Computational design of interventions to generate
desired signaling pathway response

Next we study the suitability of Sorad for predicting experimen-
tal conditions to acquire a desired signaling response, for which
we again use the original partitioning of the training and test
data. We study two different cases where the activation of
AKT is controlled: either the activity level of AKT remains con-
stant or it is strongly increased after the perturbations (150% of
the maximum activity level of AKT in training data). The esti-
mated perturbations that are needed for the desired AKT activity
levels are shown in Figure 5A—D. In each of the cases, we con-
sider ﬁve different initially ﬁxed perturbation conditions: none of
the perturbations are ﬁxed, TGFa stimulation is either manda-
tory or not permitted, or IGF1 stimulation is mandatory or not
permitted. The four regulators are partioned into two groups
based on the experimental setting: TGFa and IGF1 are regula-
tors that can be used to stimulate the respective receptors, and
PI3K and IKK are mediators that can be inhibited. As an

Fig. 5. Predicting the optimal perturbations to control the activation level
of AKT in an unrestricted situation or under different preset conditions
(stimulation with IGF1 or TGFoz is mandatory or not permitted). The
levels of bars in the bar charts reﬂect the suggested levels (concentrations)
of IGF1 and TGFoz growth factors as well as PI3K and IKK inhibitors,
all of which can be used to acquire the desired activation level for AKT.
The dashed lines mark at the levels of perturbations used in the training
data. (A) In this prediction, it is desired that the activity level of AKT
after 30min is same as the initial activity level. (B) The situation is the
same as in (A) but here the uncertainty of the prediction is taken into
account in the optimization. (C) In this prediction, it is desired that AKT
is fully activated after 30 min, i.e. the activity level of AKT is 150% of the
maximum activity level of AKT in the training data. (D) Same situation
as in (C), but here the uncertainty of the prediction is taken into account

example, consider the case where IGF1 receptor has been stimu-
lated and the activity level of AKT is desired to remain constant
(the top-left subﬁgure and the second bar chart group from top).
When IGF1 receptor is stimulated, we get the estimated values
for three free factors: TGFa receptor should not be stimulated
and PI3K and IKK should be inhibited. From the biological
point of view, this ﬁnding is arguable and, in addition, from
Figure 4A (bottom row, the third panel from left), we notice
that the only condition where IGF1 receptor is stimulated and
AKT is not further activated is the one where TGFa receptor is
not stimulated and PI3K and IKK are both inhibited, exactly as
we estimated.

A more sophisticated approach can weigh the predictions by
the amount of uncertainty that is associated with it, which in
principle should bias the estimated stimuli/inhibition levels
from moderate to the ones used in the model construction.
This is also a desired property from the experimental point of
view because it would allow the use of the same experimental
conditions as used already in the experiments to generate the
training data. Figure 5B (corresponding to the case in Fig. 5A)
and Figure 5D (corresponding to the case in Fig. 5C) show the
estimated perturbations when we take into account the uncer-
tainty of the estimations. It is clear that when the uncertainty in
the estimations is taken into account, the estimated perturbations
are closer to the perturbations that have already been used in the
training data. For example, if it is desired to activate AKT
(Fig. 5D) and it is given that either TGFa or IGF1 receptor is
stimulated, then the estimated perturbations are similar to those
in the experiments producing the training data. Another example
includes the case where AKT is not further activated (Fig. 5A
and B) under the stimulation of TGFa receptor: in this case, the
approach that tries to minimize the amount of uncertainty pre-
dicts an experimental condition that requires one perturbation
less than the one that is achieved by minimizing the error be-
tween the desired and predicted behavior. This can again be
validated based on the data shown in Figure 4A, as we notice
that it is enough to silence PI3K (inhibition p38i + PI3Ki) under
the stimulation of TGFa receptor to keep AKT activity at the
basal level. Because the predicted interventions to modulate the
signaling response are validated by independent experimental
data, we conclude that Sorad can be used to identify accurate
modulation strategies.

3.7 Performance evaluation using in silica data

To better demonstrate Sorad’s performance in predicting dy-
namics and perturbations, we set up an in silica signaling scen-
ario similar with the one in the HepG2 cell line. We deﬁne a
hypothetical ODE model (Supplementary Fig. SlA) where two
proteins are responsible for the phosphorylation of a target pro-
tein and generate data from the model with additive Gaussian
noise. Assuming the model structure is known, we ﬁrst learn the
dynamics of the model (functions f and g) together with at and A,
and then apply it to independent test data to predict the re-
sponse. As shown in Supplementary Figure SlB—D, Sorad is
able to learn the unknown regulatory function as well as make
accurate predictions of signaling dynamics over long time inter-
vals. We also tested Sorad on a more challenging in silica prob-
lem where effectively less data are available to learn the

phosphorylation dynamics g. Nevertheless, as shown in Supple-
mentary Figures S2A—D, Sorad still makes relatively accurate
predictions under uncertainty in estimated dynamics. To that
end, we applied the estimated models (Supplementary Figs 1C
and 2C) of phosphorylation dynamics to predict perturbations.
First, we simulate the mathematical model and then, using the
estimated dynamical model, estimated the optimal perturbation
(or input) to obtain the observed model response. Results in
Supplementary Figures SlE and S2E show how the estimated
perturbation closely follows the (unknown) input used to gener-
ate the data, thus demonstrating Sorad’s ability to predict dy-
namic perturbations over long time intervals.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The presented methodology, Sorad, combines dynamic models
with a data-driven non-parametric component, which leads to a
ﬂexible and probabilistic dynamical modeling framework. The
ﬁrst main contribution of this study is the efﬁcient methodology,
which makes the use of ODEs easy in situations where the con-
struction of a parametric network model beforehand is challen-
ging, as is typically the case in practice. The second main
contribution is the scheme for predicting required perturbations
for modulating the pathway response, which we demonstrated
with a proof-of—concept example using real phosphoprotein time-
course data.

To validate Sorad, we carried out a comparison that demon-
strated its applicability for modeling signal propagation even
without prior biological knowledge. This is supported by the
performance assessment of the predictions: Sorad produced the
most accurate predictions with the smallest number of relation-
ships between the phosphoproteins. In addition to modeling sig-
naling pathways, Sorad is also applicable for modeling other
types of biological processes and it can be applied to even
larger networks and datasets because the computation can be
easily parallelized. However, if one is interested in analyzing
larger networks consisting of hundreds or thousands of phospho-
proteins or, for example, transcripts, the manual clustering step
for the search of individual conditions where a target protein or
gene is regulated differentially will become a bottleneck. For
large networks, this step could be automated by using, for ex-
ample, model—based clustering methods, which provide a quan-
titative and probabilistic scoring framework. Also note that the
estimation of f functions is analytically tractable as long as it is
possible to write the solution of the ODE, which only contains
linear operations on f function.

A closer inspection of the pathway model that was inferred
using Sorad pointed out a putative regulatory role for IKK in the
activation of AKT in TGFoz-stimulated cells. AKT has been
generally thought to regulate IKK, thereby suggesting a reverse
regulatory interaction between the proteins (Manning and
Cantley, 2007). Low levels of IKB phosphorylation in TGFa-
stimulated cells imply that NF-ch pathway is unlikely to mediate
IKK-dependent AKT phosphorylation and we could not ﬁnd
any publications reporting IKK-dependent activation of ILK
or mTORC2, the upstream kinases for AKT. Interestingly,
IRSl has potential to regulate AKT in HepG2 cells
(Khamzina et al., 2005): increased IRSl phosphorylation
(Ser636/Ser639) decreases both IRSl-PI3K interaction and

AKT phosphorylation after stimulation through insulin receptor.
Furthermore, IKKs bind to IRSl in a basal state in HepG2 cells
(Gao et al., 2002). On TNFOt stimulation, IKK-IRSl interaction
is disturbed and IRSl gets phosphorylated on Ser3l2, leading to
decreased IRSl activity in insulin-treated cells. IRSl gets phos-
phorylated on Ser636/Ser639 residues after TGFoz (but not after
IGF1) stimulation in the original dataset (Alexopoulos et al.,
2010), which correlates with IKK-dependent AKT activation
only in TGFa-treated cells. Interestingly, MEKl/2 activation is
also dependent on both PI3K and IKK after TGFa stimulation,
suggesting a similar type of upstream regulation. The data sug-
gest that IKK might regulate AKT (and MEKl/2) phosphoryl-
ation through IRSl and PI3K in TGFa-treated cells. This idea
can be addressed in adjacent biological studies. What comes to
the prediction itself, it demonstrates how the data-driven nature
of Sorad provides high potential to generate novel hypotheses for
further experimental research.

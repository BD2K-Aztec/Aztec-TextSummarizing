ABSTRACT

Motivation: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a chromosomal instability
syndrome originated by inherited mutations that impair the Fanconi
Anemia/Breast Cancer (FA/BRCA) pathway, which is committed
to the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs). The disease
displays increased spontaneous chromosomal aberrations and
hypersensitivity to agents that create DNA interstrand cross-links. In
spite of DNA damage, FA/BRCA-deficient cells are able to progress
throughout the cell cycle, probably due to the activity of alternative
DNA repair pathways, or due to defects in the checkpoints that
monitor DNA integrity.

Results: We propose a Boolean network model of the FA/BRCA
pathway, Checkpoint proteins and some alternative DNA repair
pathways. To our knowledge, this is the largest network model
incorporating a DNA repair pathway. Our model is able to simulate the
ICL repair process mediated by the FA/BRCA pathway, the activation
of Checkpoint proteins observed by recurrent DNA damage, as
well as the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and DNA adducts.
We generated a series of simulations for mutants, some of which
have never been reported and thus constitute predictions about
the function of the FA/BRCA pathway. Finally, our model suggests
alternative DNA repair pathways that become active whenever the
FA/BRCA pathway is defective.

1 INTRODUCTION

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a chromosomal instability syndrome
characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital abnormalities and
an increased risk to develop cancer (D’Andrea, 2010; de Winter
and Joenje, 2009). Cells of patients with FA display increased
chromosomal aberrations, and are hypersensitive to agents that
create DNA interstrand cross—links (ICLs) (Auerbach, 2009). The
reported prevalence of FA ranges from 1 to 5 cases per one million
persons, while the heterozygous carrier frequency is about one case
per 300 persons (although the true frequency is probably higher),
with a median age at diagnosis of 6.5—8 years (D’Andrea, 2010). FA

represents a suitable model to study human DNA repair mechanisms
and it is gaining relevance because heterozygous carriers have a
high risk of developing malignancies such as breast cancer (Neveling
et al., 2009).

FA is a genetically heterogeneous disease, caused by mutations
in at least one of the 15 distinct genes, namely: FANCA,
FANCB, FANCC, FANCDl/BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF,
FANCG FANCI, FANCJ/BRIPl/BACHl, FANCL, FANCM,
FANCN/PALB2, FANCO/RAD51C and FANCP/SLX4. These
genes are involved in the so—called Fanconi Anemia/Breast Cancer
(FA/BRCA) pathway, dedicated to the repair of DNA ICLs (de
Winter and Joenje, 2009; Kim et al., 2011; Vaz, 2010). Currently,
there is no consensus regarding the precise nature of the FA/BRCA
pathway, or the network of interactions established with other
genes/proteins involved in FA. We hereby propose the regulatory
network established among 20 protein complexes that include
the aforementioned proteins of the FA/BRCA pathway. Moreover,
this network includes nodes to describe the three types of DNA
damage commonly observed in FA. We thereafter implement the
FA/BRCA network as a discrete dynamical system and study its
behavior.

The modeling of regulatory networks of biological interest as
discrete dynamical systems is a well—established methodology.
Boolean networks, the simplest form of discrete dynamical systems,
have been used to model a wide variety of processes such as the
genetic control of ﬂoral morphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana
(Mendoza et al., 1999), the differentiation process of T—helper
lymphocytes (Mendoza, 2006), the control of the mammalian cell
cycle (Faure et al., 2006) and the surviving process of malignant
cells in large granular lymphocyte leukemia (Zhang et al., 2009a),
to name a few examples. This type of approach is widely used to
study the dynamical behaviour of regulatory networks because of
its straightforwardness, robustness and compatibility with published
qualitative data (Chaves et al., 2005; Christensen et al., 2007;
Davidich and Bornholdt, 2008; Mendoza and Pardo, 2010; Wu et al.,
2009).

There are some mathematical models that describe DNA repair,
see, for example, Crooke and Parl (2010). However, to our
knowledge, the model presented here is the ﬁrst dynamical system
proposed speciﬁcally for the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway. This
model is able to reproduce the ICLs repair process mediated by
the FA/BRCA pathway, and the repair of double—strand breaks
(DSBs) and DNA adducts (ADDs). In order to obtain a dynamical
behavior that reproduces the experimental data, we propose the

FA/BRCA pathway

 

existence of some interactions not reported in the experimental
literature, and therefore they constitute predictions of our model.
Speciﬁcally, we include the generation of DSBs during ICLs repair
by alternative DNA endonucleases, even in FA/BRCA mutants.
Second, we propose a rule that enables MRN to act in the absence of
FA/BRCA and NHEJ pathways during an ICL— generated DSB repair
process. Third, we propose that USPl is regulated by the activity
of FANCM. And fourth, we propose that the Checkpoint Recovery
process (CHKREC) negatively regulates 17 nodes of the FA/BRCA
pathway.

2 METHODS
2.1 Reconstruction of FA/BRCA network

The experimental literature on FA was thoroughly analyzed, so as to
reconstruct the connectivity among key components of the FA/BRCA
pathway. Brieﬂy, a DNA ICL is able to arrest the DNA synthesis process;
the FANCM/FAAP24 protein complex (FANCM) recognizes the damage
and recruits the FA core (FAcore) complex (Gari e1 611., 2008). Then, the
FAcore complex monoubiquitinates the FANCD2I complex (Kim et 611.,
2011), which in turn recruits endonucleases such as FANl (MacKay et 611.,
2010; Smogorzewska 61611., 2010), XPF/ERCCI (Bhagwat 61611., 2009) and
MUS81/EME1 (MUS81) (Hanada et 611., 2006) to generate a DSB and a
DNA adduct. The FA/BRCA proteins funnel the DSB to be repaired by
the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway mediated by Breast
Cancer 1 (BRCAl) (Bekker—Jensen etal., 2006), FANCN (Xia etal., 2007),
FANCDl (San Filippo 61 611., 2006), FANCJ (Gong 61 611., 2010) and the
RAD51 complex (San Filippo e1 611., 2006). The blockage of the DNA
replication by the presence of an ADD can be bypassed with the help of the
proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and translesion synthesis (TLS)
polymerases and then repaired by the nucleotide excision repair (NER)
proteins (Chang and Cimprich, 2009; Garg etal., 2005). As a ﬁnal step, the
ubiquitin—speciﬁc protease 1 (USPl) protein inactivates the FAcore complex
and PCNA proteins by deubiquitination, turning the signaling process off
(Huang and D’Andrea, 2006; Niimi et 611., 2008). Finally, it is important
to note that the FA/BRCA pathway establishes a cross talk with the ataxia
telangiectasia and Rad3—related (ATR) Checkpoint protein and its effector
kinase, Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHKl), which are required for the activation
of the FA/BRCA pathway and cell cycle arrest. The reader may ﬁnd a more
detailed explanation of the whole process in Supplementary Material.

Our proposed network for the FA/BRCA pathway, shown in Figure 1,
Supplementary Figure SI and Supplementary Material (FA_BRCA_
networkpdf), incorporates DNA damage recognition proteins, DNA damage
Checkpoint proteins and DNA repair effector proteins. At least 51, proteins
were found to be relevant for the reconstruction of the network; however,
some of these proteins act as functional complexes, and therefore they were
collapsed into single functional nodes to facilitate the dynamical analysis.
Furthermore, three nodes representing different types of DNA damage were
included into the model, namely ICL, DSB and ADD. As a result, the network
is made up of 28 nodes and 122 regulatory interactions, 80 of them positive
and 42 negative (Fig. 1). The regulatory rules of this network is presented
in Table 1. A detailed description of the information used to reconstruct
the connectivity and the logical rules of such network can be found as
Supplementary Material.

Not all interactions of the FA/BRCA network, as shown in Figure 1,
have been reported in the experimental literature or appear in specialized
databases. Indeed, while our regulatory network includes some of the
elements of the FA/BRCA pathway as included in the KEGG database,
our network incorporates more nodes, speciﬁcally ATM, CHKl CHK2
and some pathways like the non—homologous end joining. Because of this
characteristic, our network is unique in incorporating a cross talk with
alternative DNA repair pathways.

Of the 122 regulatory interactions present in our model, 16 were included
so as to obtain a dynamical behavior that reproduce the experimental
data. These proposed regulatory interactions are divided into four groups.
First, we included a positive interaction of XPF over DSB to ensure the
generation of DSBs during ICL repair by the activity of alternative DNA
endonucleases even in FA/BRCA—deﬁcient cells. Second, we incorporated
negative regulations of MRN from FANCD2I, KU, RAD51 and CHKREC,
so that during the ICL—generated DSB repair process the MRN exonuclease
acts only in the absence of FA/BRCA and NHEJ pathways. Third, we propose
that USPl is under positive control from FANCDlN, and under negative
control from FANCM, to indicate that the USPl deubiquitinating enzyme is
directly or indirectly regulated by the presence of FANCDl/BRCA2, FANCN
and FANCM. And fourth, we propose that CHKREC negatively regulates
11 nodes (see Fig. 1, Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2). The selection of
these 16 unreported interactions was based exclusively in the recovery of the
known attractors for the wild type and the mutants. This was the minimal set
of new interactions that we found consistent with the experimental data.

2.2 The FA/BRCA network as a discrete dynamical
system

We modeled the reconstructed FA/BRCA pathway as a Boolean network,
where each node is described by a variable x that takes the value of 0 or 1 to
represent its inactive or active state of activation, respectively. The activation
state of the whole network is then represented by a vector with the set of
Boolean variables x1,x2, ...,xn, where x,- is the state of activation of the i—th
node. The state of activation of each node changes in discrete time steps
aCCOFding t0 9610+ 1) :Fi(x1(t)ax2(t)a ---,xn(t)), Where 961(1),)620), ~~~axn(t) iS
the state of the regulators of node x,- at time t, and F ,- is a Boolean function,
also called a logical rule, determining the state of node x,- at the next time
step. The speciﬁc Boolean functions for each node are shown in Table 1.
These equations describe a deterministic dynamical system, with a total
of 2282268435456 possible activation states. We exhaustively tested the
dynamical behavior of the FA/BRCA network by starting the simulations
from all possible initial conditions with BoolNet (Miissel et 611., 2010)
under synchronous updating, until the system reached a stationary pattern
of activation, also referred to as an attractor. Finally, to simulate loss— and
gain—of—function mutants, the corresponding variable was ﬁxed to 0 or 1,
respectively. The ﬁle containing the FA/BRCA network in the BoolNet
format is available as the Supplementary Material (FA_for_BoolNet.txt).
Given the large number of possible activation states of the FA/BRCA
network, it is computationally unfeasible to fully analyze its dynamical
behavior using an asynchronous updating. However, it is instructive to
compare certain key results under both synchronous and asynchronous
updating. Therefore, the attractors of the wild type, FAcore null mutant,
and FANCDlN null mutant models, were obtained by using BoolNet with
asynchronous updating starting from 10000 random initial states.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A great proportion of FA cells in culture die when exposed to ICL
inducing agents, such as mitomycin C (MMC) or diepoxybutane
(DEB), due to severe DNA repair deﬁciencies. However, some cells
survive exhibiting unrepaired DSBs and cytogenetic evidence of
erroneous DNA repair such as radial exchange ﬁgures and a normal
rate of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) (Latt 61611., 1975). Our aim
was to understand the mechanism by which FA cells use alternative
DNA repair pathways when exposed to ICL—inducing agents. To
accomplish this, we developed a Boolean network model of the
FA/BRCA pathway, which incorporates the known interactions of
FA proteins with other pathways that participate in the preservation
of genome stability. The network has three nodes that can be used
as input, so as to model different types of DNA damage signals that

activate the DNA repair process, namely ICL, DSB and ADD. The
reason to include these nodes in the network is that FA cells are
highly sensitive to ICLs (D’Andrea, 2010; de Winter and Joenje,
2009), whereas DSBs and ADDs are found during ICLs repair (Kee
and D’Andrea, 2010).

3.1 The FA/BRCA network

The reconstructed FA/BRCA regulatory network (Fig. 1) and its
associated logical functions (Table 1) integrate the vast majority
of experimental knowledge about the FA/BRCA pathway and its
interactions with other genes/proteins involved in FA. The resulting
discrete dynamical system was exhaustively analyzed so as to
obtain the attractors of the system, particularly when starting in
the presence of the three types of DNA damage: ICLs, DSBs and

ADDs, under wild type and mutant conditions. With the inclusion of
some inferred, but not yet reported, interactions the model recovers
the main known features of the wild type FA/BRCA pathway.
Since, to our knowledge, there are no published reports about these
interactions, they constitute veritable predictions of our model that
require additional research in order to be validated.

3.1.] The generation of DSBs daring ICL repair is assured by the
activity of FA/BRCA pathway endonucleases It has been reported
that primary FA—C cells are not defective in the generation of DSBs
during the initial steps of ICL repair (Rothfuss and Grompe, 2004).
Since the generation of DSBs during the processing of ICLs is
not absolutely abolished in FA, then there must exist alternative
endonucleases that become active even when the FA/BRCA pathway

is defective. A likely candidate is XPF/ERCCl with 5’ endonuclease
activity (Kuraoka et a1.,, 2000), which has a similar function to
FAN1 (MacKay et a1., 2010). We hereby propose that the activity
of this alternative endonuclease is promoted by MUS81 proteins,
very probably in concert with the newly described SLX4 (FANCP)
(Crossan et a1., 2011; Kim et a1., 2011). Alternatively, XPF/ERCCl
might be activated by a p53—dependent pathway. Under wild—type
conditions, the activity of this alternative endonuclease must be
inhibited in order to avoid a possible interference with the FA/BRCA
pathway. In our model, this inhibition was accomplished by the
activation of the FANCM or FANCD2I complexes in association
with FAN1 (Supplementary Fig. S3). This is an issue that deserves
additional research because it does not exist information about
any direct or indirect active inhibition of any endonuclease by
the FA/BRCA proteins. Very likely, these alternative endonucleases
are present as a secondary pathway whose effect becomes evident
whenever the FA/BRCA pathway is defective.

3.1.2 During the repair of an ICL-intermediate DSB the MRN
exonuclease activity acts in the absence of FA/BRCA and NHEJ
pathways When a DSB is generated, proteins of different DNA
repair pathways such as HRR and NHEJ surround the region of
DNA damage. The co—localization of these proteins is considered
as evidence of interaction between both DNA repair pathways
(Bekker—Jensen et a1., 2006; Kass and Jasin, 2010). Now, the MRN
complex, a heterotrimeric complex with exonuclease activity, is able

to process DSBs generating DNA overhangs that are funneled to the
HRR process. In normal cells, the presence of the MRN complex
is considered as essential for FANCD2 stability (Roques et a1.,
2009); moreover, recent studies have suggested that FANCD2 also
possesses exonuclease activity (Pace et a1., 2010). Therefore, the
exonuclease activity of the MRN complex may not be necessary
when the FA/BRCA pathway functions properly. The same group
also found that the KU70, a NHEJ protein, corrupts the DNA
repair process and changes the DNA repair choice to the error—
prone NHEJ pathway in FA cells. They also observed that the
FANCA/KU70 double mutant is able to repair the DNA damage
by the HRR pathway. Moreover, a series of reports have shown that
cells deﬁcient in the FA/BRCA pathway generate sister chromatid
exchanges (SCEs) when treated with MMC (Latt et a1., 1975;
Wilson et a1., 2001). Now, as SCEs are considered a result of HRR
with crossing—over, this could mean that FA cells are still able to
perform HRR by a FA/BRCA—independent pathway. Interestingly,
downstream FA/BRCA pathway mutant cells, such as RAD51 and
FANCDl/BRCA2, are not able to generate SCEs when exposed to
ICL—inducing agents (Sonoda et a1., 1999; Takata et a1., 2001).
Taking all the previous information into account, we believe that
the MRN complex is a likely candidate to direct the HRR process in
the absence of FA/BRCA and NHEJ proteins. According to this, the
ﬁrst mechanism to repair an ICL—intermediate DSB would be the
HRR mediated by FA/BRCA and then the NHEJ proteins. If both
these pathways are defective, the candidate to initiate an alternative

HRR and generate SCE would be the MRN complex. Our model
proposes that KU70 in conjunction with the FAN CD2I complex act
inhibiting MRN (Supplementary Fig. S4). Then, when the inhibitors
are absent, the activation of ATM and the presence of a DSB is
enough to activate MRN. This might explain why the DNA repair
is improved in FANCA/KU70 double mutants (Pace et a1., 2010).
Alternatively, a point of inhibition over MRN could be the activation
of RAD51 and CHKREC, which would turn the activity of the MRN
complex off.

The USP] deubiquitinating enzyme is directly or indirectly regulated
by the presence of FANCM To date, it is known that the USPl
deubiquitinating protein is able to inactivate the FANCD2I complex
(Cohn et a1., 2009; Nijman et a1., 2005) and TLS proteins (Huang
and D’Andrea, 2006; Niimi et a1., 2008), although it is not yet clear
which is the mechanism that activates USPl itself. In our model,
the activation of USPl cannot occur unless both the FANCD2I
and FANCDlN complexes or TLS are active (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Also, the activation of USPl is restricted since it does
not occur unless FANCM is turned off. This behavior ensures that
the activity of the FA/BRCA pathway continues until the ICL has
been processed.

3.1.3 The Checkpoint recovery process is critical for the FA/BRCA
pathway regulation We found that negative feedback mediated
by the CHKREC is indispensable to obtain the experimentally
observed behavior of the FA/BRCA network. In our model, we
propose that CHKREC is able to inactivate 10 nodes; namely,
MRN, BRCA, FANCDlN, RAD51, HRR, DNAPK, NHEJ, ATR,
p53 and CHKREC itself. These 10 out of 17 regulatory interactions
of CHKREC are not reported in the experimental literature, they
are predictions of our model. It is important to mention that the
CHKREC process includes several proteins able to inactivate key
DNA repair and Checkpoint proteins allowing the progression of the
cell cycle (Bartek and Lukas, 2007; Carlessi et a1., 2010; Douglas
et a1., 2010; Fiscella et a1., 1997).

3.2 Dynamics of the FA/BRCA boolean model

3.2.] Dynamics of the model in the absence of damage The
FA/BRCA network model has only one attractor, regardless of
the initial state of the network, that we refer to as the cell cycle
progression (CCP) attractor, characterized by a periodic oscillation
between two network states (Fig. 2, speciﬁcally the last two time
periods in Panels A—C). This attractor is reached in an average of
~10 time steps from its initial state (see the distribution of values
in Supplementary Fig. S6). Once in the CCP attractor all nodes are
inactive, except for CHKREC that oscillates between the on and off
states. This period—2 attractor can be interpreted biologically as the
periodical transition in the cell cycle that starts with the activation of
proteins that release the GZIM Checkpoint, which veriﬁes the DNA
integrity and allow the progression of the cell cycle. Once a new
cell cycle starts, the CHKREC proteins turn off, only to be active
again when the cell reaches the 02 phase of a new cell cycle. Hence,
the proteins involved in this cyclic behavior might include Cyclin—
dependent kinases (Cdks), which have an active/inactive transitional
behavior controlling the progression through the eukaryotic cell
cycle (Bloom and Cross, 2007). Importantly, this period—2 attractor
is also obtained if the network is studied with an asynchronous
updating.

DSB and ADD. Time steps in arbitrary units are indicated at the leftmost
column. The period—2 attractor of the network is indicated in gray in the time
column. Nodes are grouped into functional categories by shades of gray, and
also by name at the topmost column.

3.2.2 Dynamics of the model during DSB, ADD and ICL repair
The FA/BRCA network recovers the known order of activations
leading to the repair of DSBs, ADDs and ICLs. Speciﬁcally, when
a DSB is introduced in the model (Fig. 2A), the network is
able to repair it via the MRN—mediated HRR pathway (Kass and
Jasin, 2010). Also, the simulation of an ADD (Fig. 2B) causes
the activation of the PCNATLS pathway (Chang and Cimprich,
2009), which repairs the ADD by the mediation of NER. Finally,
the FA/BRCA network is able to describe the elimination of an ICL
(Fig. 2C) by way of the generation of DSB and ADD intermediates
(de Winter and J oenje, 2009). Moreover, the dynamics shown in
Figure 2C also includes the recently described inhibition of FA
proteins over NHEJ proteins (Bunting et a1., 2010; Pace et a1., 2010),
as well as the activation of the Checkpoint proteins (Bartek and
Lukas, 2007).

The cross talk among pathways generate negative feedback loops
that create an homeostatic process in the recovering of the system
after the DNA damage. In our model, the negative feedback mediated
by CHKREC involves NHEJ, MRN, BRCA1, FANCDlN, RAD51,
HRR, DNAPK, ATR, p53 and CHKREC itself. Once DNA damages
have been eliminated, the network returns to its normal behavior,
as represented by the CCP attractor. However, if by any reason
the damage is constantly generated, for example by the persistent

presence of MMC or DEB, the network reaches attractors different
from the CCP (see further).

3.2.3 Dynamics of mutants of the FA/BRCA network We used
the FA/BRCA to study the effects of turning some nodes on or
off permanently, thus simulating diverse physiological and mutant
conditions. First, we simulated the permanent presence of DNA
damage by leaving the ICL node always on. Such a constitutive
activation pretends to represent the effect observed when there
is a persistent presence of chemicals such as MMC or DEB.
Figure 3 (time steps 11—20) shows that under such circumstances
the network reaches a period-10 attractor characterized by the
persistent activation of Checkpoint, FA/BRCA and HRR pathways.
Biologically, this pattern might represent that the cell is performing
a DNA repair process without progressing on the cell cycle. Because
of this characteristic, we refer to this attractor as the cell cycle arrest
(CCA) attractor. If the source of DNA damage is eliminated, i.e. the
ICL node is permitted to become inactive, the cell cycle progresses
as evidenced by the network reaching the CCP attractor (data not
shown).

Following the simulation of the repair of ICLs, DSBs and
ADDs, we tested all possible single gain— and loss-of-function
mutants and their dynamical behavior (Supplementary Material).
Regarding null mutants on the FA/BRCA pathway, our model
adequately describes the reported cellular phenotypes including
the persistence of unrepaired DSBs, the activation of the NHEJ
pathway, the activation of RAD51 in upstream mutants, the inability
to activate RAD51 in downstream mutants and the correct activation
of Checkpoint proteins that leads to an arrest in CCP. This last
point is of relevance, since it argues in favor of a well-conserved
GZIM Checkpoint function of FA/BRCA pathway in mutant cells
(Neveling et a1., 2009). Interestingly, with the exception of the
CHKREC null mutant, every null mutant recovers the CCP attractor,
although some mutants also have additional attractors with larger
basins (Supplementary Material).

Most FA patients carry an alteration in the FANCA gene
(Auerbach, 2009), hence we hereby show the corresponding
simulation, which is the constitutive null mutant of FAcore (Fig. 4).
The model of the mutant is able to repair the damage simulated
by an ICL pulse, thus reaching the CCP attractor (Fig. 4A, time
steps 14—15). Noteworthy, the same attractor is recovered by using
an asynchronous updating scheme. In this condition, our model

shows that the NHEJ pathway repaired the DSB generated as
an intermediary. Furthermore, when a constant ICL damage was
simulated in the FAcore null mutant, the model reaches a period-10
attractor (Fig. 4B, time steps 23—32) somewhat similar to the CCA
attractor (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the model shows a difference in the
mechanism of repair, depending on the persistence of the damage.
With a single ICL pulse, the NHEJ pathway is the main route to
repair the damage, whereas with a constant ICL stimulus there is a
combined effort among the NHEJ and HRR paths. This is in marked
contrast to the wild-type network, where the HRR—by mediation
of the FA/BRCA proteins—is always the ﬁrst option of repair.
With an intact FA/BRCA pathway, the FAcore collaborates in
the activation of the FAN1 endonuclease to generate the necessary
DSBs to repair an ICL (MacKay et a1., 2010; Smogorzewska et a1.,
2010) (Fig. 2C). However, in FANCA patients the activity of FAcore
does not exist, it is therefore instructive to analyze which DNA
endonucleases are responsible for the generation of DSBs in this
case. According to our model, in the absence of FAcore, the effect
could be achieved by the activation of the FANCM protein and
the MUS81 and XPF endonucleases (Fig. 4), with the subsequent
activation of FANCJBRCAl and Checkpoint proteins, such as ATR
and ATM kinases. At this point, an ADD and a DSB are generated,
a normal TLS/NER process (part of the PCNATLS node) repairs
the ADD, and then the NHEJ pathway or the MRN-mediated HRR
could repair the DSB. Recent data have shown that a completely
functional FA/BRCA pathway will block the NHEJ pathway (Pace

et a1., 2010); therefore in FAcore mutants, the KU proteins have
the possibility to occupy the DSB and direct the DNA lesion to
the NHEJ pathway. Additionally, this mechanism could explain the
radial exchange ﬁgures seen in FA cell metaphases.

The period— 10 attractor observed due to a persistent ICL in FAcore
null mutant includes the activation of the HRR pathway, mediated by
MRN, BRCA1, ssDNARPA and RAD51 (Fig. 4B). This behaviour
could explain the sister chromatid exchanges observed in upstream
FA cells, as these SCEs are considered a result of HRR with crossing—
over (Hirano et a1., 2005). This, in turn, could mean that FA cells
are still able to perform HRR by a FA/BRCA—independent pathway.
Our model points to MRN as a candidate to direct the HRR process
in the absence of some FA proteins.

The simulation in Figure 4B shows that in FAcore null mutant is
possible to observe that the activation of the Checkpoint proteins,
namely ATR, ATM, CHK1, CHK2 and p53, is not impaired. This
implies that the Checkpoint protein activation in the presence of
DNA damage should be normal in FA cells, in concordance with
experimental data (Heinrich et a1., 1998). However, the simulation
shows that the Checkpoint module turns off even when the DNA
damage nodes are still active, which may explain the presence of
unrepaired ICLs, DSBs and ADDs.

We turn now our attention to a different mutant. It has
been demonstrated the involvement of FANCD1/BRCA2 and
FANCN/PALB2 in the development of breast cancer. These are
molecules that act downstream of the FA/BRCA pathway in the
DSB repair mediated by HRR (Xia et a1., 2007; Zhang et al.,
2009b). Patients carrying FA/BRCA downstream null mutations,
such as FANCDl/BRCA2 or FANCN/PALB2, are relatively rare
and develop malignant solid tumors earlier in life than FA patients
carrying FA/BRCA upstream null mutations (Neveling et a1., 2009).
This characteristic might be due to the inability to use alternative
DNA repair pathways; in fact, cells from these patients are unable
to perform sister chromatid exchanges (Sonoda et a1., 1999; Takata
et a1., 2001).

Figure 5 shows the simulations of the null mutation in FANCD 1N.
In Figure 5A, it can be observed that the attractor reached is
characterized by the activation of the Checkpoint proteins with
a concomitant absence of HRR and NHEJ activities. Moreover,
such attractor is obtained with either synchronous or asynchronous
updating schemes. Now, Figure 5B shows the attractor reached under
persistent ICL damage. These activation patterns can be interpreted
as resulting from an arrest in the cell cycle due to a lack of repair of
the DNA damage. If true, this behavior could partially explain the
scarcity of patients with mutations in either FANCDl/BRCA2 or
FANCN/PALB2 genes. Clearly, those surviving patients presenting
these mutations should present alternative mechanisms of DNA
repair allowing them to survive.

The clinical manifestations of FA patients are extremely variable,
therefore it has been difﬁcult to establish a clear genotype—
phenotype correlation. Nonetheless, there are phenotypic differences
when comparing patients with FAcore mutations against those who
carry mutations in the downstream genes, as FANCN or FANCDl.
Specially the later kind of patients die due to the development of
Wilms Tumor or meduloblastome, which typically occur earlier than
pancytopenia, and also have more severe congenital malformations.
In our model, it is possible to ﬁnd a clear difference between null
mutants in upstream and downstream nodes. The upstream null
mutant shows the activation of alternative DNA repair pathways,

eventually leading to the system to the CCP attractor (Fig. 4 and
Supplementary Material). In contrast, the simulations of downstream
null mutant show the limited possibilities of DNA repair, leading the
system principally to the CCA attractor (Fig. 5 and Supplementary
Material). This implies that cells with downstream null mutations
have clearly few possibilities of repair, thus eventually causing cell
death. It is important to mention the scarcity of patients carrying
mutations somewhere in downstream FA/BRCA, probably due to
early cell demise concomitant with an irreversible arrest of CCP, as
implied by the CCA attractor.

We described in the previous paragraphs the simulation of some
variants of the FA/BRCA network that reﬂect the mutations of
certain type of patients, and the response of their cells to certain
type of DNA damage, namely ICLs. The reader may refer to
the Supplementary Material for an exhaustive presentation of the
simulations for all possible single mutants of the FA/BRCA network.

4 CONCLUSION

We presented in this article the reconstruction of the FA/BRCA
network, as well as its implementation as a discrete dynamical
system, and its behavior under a number of simulated mutations and
DNA damages. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst network model
incorporating this DNA repair pathway.

We simulated with the model the dynamical behavior leading
to alternative routes of DNA repair that might help explain the
phenotype of cells obtained from patients with FA. Our simulations
strongly suggest that the use of alternative DNA repair pathways
help to safeguard the integrity of the genome, although the choice
of pathway does not warrant a proper joining of damaged DNA.

While we did not present a formal robustness analysis of the
FA/BRCA network, the results shown here are suggestive of a
robust system. The recovery of a small number of attractors, all
of them with a clear qualitative biological interpretation, even
under the systematic alteration of the network to represent loss—
and gain—of—function mutations imply that the network has a strong
canalizing dynamical behavior. Moreover, 45 out of the possible 56

mutants conserved the wild—type attractor. Now, most simulations
were performed using a synchronous update method, which is
unrealistic from the biological point of view. However, we tested
a number of key network variants, namely the wild type, the
FAcore and the FANCDlN null mutants with both synchronous and
asynchronous update schemes, obtaining exactly the same attractors.
This invariability favors the interpretation that our results are robust,
and are not completely determined by the updating methodology
used. We are aware that these results are only suggestive about the
robustness of the FA/BRCA network, and therefore the issue has to
be further studied properly and systematically.

Our model makes a number of very concrete, testable predictions
in the form of trajectories and attractors reached under different
circumstances. Testing these predictions in the laboratory can help
in the understanding of the mechanisms behind the DNA repair
process as mediated by the FA/BRCA pathway. Such knowledge
has potential implications in the reﬁnement of FA/BRCA and DNA
repair related pathways, with the concomitant improvement in the
treatment of patients with FA, with tumors with a FA phenotype, or
even with chemo—resistant forms of cancer.

The current model will be improved in the future in several
ways. The incorporation of more nodes or interactions may reﬁne
the model so that it would explain the cellular behavior of
rare complementation groups. Also, the analysis of the network
as a stochastic dynamical system could generate information
about the probability of cells to make use of alternative DNA
repair mechanism, and thus improve the chance to survive to
DNA damages. Finally, it is worth exploring the incorporation of
interactions with apoptotic pathways, which are highly related to
the DNA repair process.

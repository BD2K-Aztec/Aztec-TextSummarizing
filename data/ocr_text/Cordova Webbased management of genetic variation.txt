ABSTRACT

Summary: Cordova is an out-of—the—box solution for building and
maintaining an online database of genetic variations integrated with
pathogenicity prediction results from popular algorithms. Our primary
motivation for developing this system is to aid researchers and clin-
ician—scientists in determining the clinical significance of genetic
variations. To achieve this goal, Cordova provides an interface to
review and manually or computationally curate genetic variation data
as well as share it for clinical diagnostics and the advancement of
research.

Availability and implementation: Cordova is open source
under the MIT license and is freely available for download at
https://github.com/clcg/cordova.

1 INTRODUCTION

Curated genetic variation data play a crucial role for researchers,
genetic counselors, clinicians and patients alike. We have created
Cordova (curated online reference database of variation annota-
tions), an out-of-the-box solution for building and maintaining
a curated online database of genetic variations integrated with
pathogenicity prediction results from popular algorithms.
Cordova provides a collection of tools for research and clinical
genetic testing designed to (i) annotate variations from popular
pathogenicity prediction tools; (ii) collect published allele
frequencies; (iii) provide an interface for reviewing and curating
variation, pathogenicity and allele frequency data; and (iv) share
these annotations to inform fellow clinicians and researchers with
up-to-date data. We originally designed this software for dissem-
ination of information on variations in genes causally related to
non-syndromic hearing loss as part of the OtoSCOPE® diagnos-
tic platform (Shearer et al., 2013). We then generalized the
software to be applicable for management, curation and dissem-
ination of any set of variations. The Leiden Open Variation
Database (LOVD) (F okkema et al., 2011) package is currently
the only other software aimed at providing an out-of-the-box

variation database management system. Therefore, we tested
the latest version of the LOVD software (LOVD version 3,
build 9) at the time of this writing and compared it with
Cordova. A general comparison is provided in Table l. LOVD
is a popular and mature tool that stores variation data.
However, we set out to develop a system that aids researchers
and clinicians in the context of genetic testing and provides
pathogenicity prediction results to aid in evaluation and
determination of clinical signiﬁcance of potentially disease-
causing variants.

Cordova is written in PHP, built on the popular CodeIgniter 2
Web application framework and uses a MySQL database.
Because Cordova is built with a popular Web framework, it is
highly conﬁgurable and well-documented for development.
LOVD is not based on a Web application framework. Our
system provides a front-end Web interface for authenticated
users to manage the database and a separate interface for brows-
ing publicly available data. Standard Web security features are
native to the CodeIgniter framework. In addition, Cordova
includes a conﬁgurable Web API for quickly retrieving data in
VCF, CSV, XML, J SON and tab-delimited formats. By
comparison, the LOVD API output is not conﬁgurable and
can only be viewed in Atom format. Current examples of
Cordova installations include the Deafness Variation Database
(DVD—http://deafnessvariationdatabase.org) and the Vision
Variation Database (VVD—http://vvd.eng.uiowa.edu). The
University of Iowa also hosts an internal Renal Disease
Variation Database (RDVD) and a Dense Deposit Disease
Database (DDDD) with plans for a public release in the future.

2 DATA MANAGEMENT

To submit a variation to a Cordova database, the user only needs
to supply its genomic coordinates, reference allele(s) and alter-
nate allele(s) (e.g. chr12:100751192:C>T). When a variation is
ﬁrst submitted, Cordova will attempt to auto-populate data
from deSFP2 (Liu et al., 2013), Exome Variant Server
(2013), The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (2012) and
OtoSCOPE®. Each allele frequency source can be conﬁgured
for inclusion or exclusion. For example, the OtoSCOPE®
source was excluded from the VVD. Auto-populated ﬁelds

include gene symbol, variant locale, HGVS nucleotide change
and amino acid change, functional prediction scores, conserva-
tion prediction scores and allele counts. Additional ﬁelds are
supplied for clinical signiﬁcance, phenotype, PubMed ID and
general comments. Although any ﬁeld can be edited, auto-
populated ﬁelds are locked for editing by default to protect
against submission of accidental misinformation. If a refSNP
ID is supplied, a link to dbSNP will be provided automatically.
Likewise, if a PubMed ID is supplied, a link to the corresponding
PubMed entry will be included automatically.

For quality control, Cordova uses a queuing system, so users
can choose to keep certain variations private while under review.
When a user submits a new variation to the database, it will be
entered into the queue and hidden from the public. If an existing
variation is edited, any new changes will be held in the queue
while older entries remain visible to the public. Variations in the
queue can be released to the public at any time on review.
Options are available to release either all variations in the
queue at once or only those selected by the user. Users may
also schedule a variation for removal from future database
releases. Additionally, the database is robust to data versioning,
so users can maintain copies of previous database releases and
rollback to an earlier version if needed. Users who make queries
via the Web API have the option to specify which version of the
database to query. Data versioning is not supported by LOVD.

Cordova supports six pathogenicity prediction scores available
from deSF P2, including SIFT (Kumar et al., 2009), Polyphen-
2 (Adzhubei et al., 2010), MutationTaster (Schwarz et al., 2010),
LRT (Chun and Fay, 2009), phyloP (Siepel et al., 2006) and
GERP++ (Davydov et al., 2010). Before manual curation, a
variation can automatically be assigned a preliminary clinical
signiﬁcance classiﬁcation based on the sum of these scores. If
at least 60% of the available predictions have a pathogenic im-
plication, a label of ‘possibly pathogenic’ will be assigned to that
variation. Otherwise a label of ‘predicted non-pathogenic’ will be
assigned. For variations with less than ﬁve prediction scores
available, a label of ‘unknown signiﬁcance’ will be assigned.

Users may manually change the clinical signiﬁcance label at
any time. The prediction scores are also accompanied by a
color-coded visual representation to easily understand the signiﬁ-
cance of each report. Red means the variant is predicted to be
pathogenic, green means non-pathogenic and gray means that no
score was provided from that particular algorithm. In compari-
son, LOVD does not offer a comparable feature for automated
pathogenicity prediction, and therefore, users must manually
provide clinical signiﬁcance classiﬁcations.

Cordova comes packaged with an example pipeline to retrieve
the necessary variation annotation data for auto-population. The
pipeline is Ruby-based and can be used as a stand-alone com-
mand-line tool. Its output is conﬁgurable and can be tailored to
local database needs, including customized interpretations of
prediction and conservation scores from deSFP2. It uses
compressed versions of annotation ﬁles to reduce their total foot-
print by one-third, and runs approximately eight times faster
than deSFP2’s native querying application for large sets of
annotations.

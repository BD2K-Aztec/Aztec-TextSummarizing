Abstract

Motivation: The protein—DNA interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and transcription fac—
tor binding sites (TFBSs, also known as DNA motifs) are critical activities in gene transcription. The
identification of the DNA motifs is a vital task for downstream analysis. Unfortunately, the long—
range coupling information between different DNA motifs is still lacking. To fill the void, as the
first—of—its—kind study, we have identified the coupling DNA motif pairs on long—range chromatin
interactions in human.

Results: The coupling DNA motif pairs exhibit substantially higher DNase accessibility than the
background sequences. Half of the DNA motifs involved are matched to the existing motif data—
bases, although nearly all of them are enriched with at least one gene ontology term. Their motif in—
stances are also found statistically enriched on the promoter and enhancer regions. Especially, we
introduce a novel measurement called motif pairing multiplicity which is defined as the number of
motifs that are paired with a given motif on chromatin interactions. Interestingly, we observe
that motif pairing multiplicity is linked to several characteristics such as regulatory region type,
motif sequence degeneracy, DNase accessibility and pairing genomic distance. Taken into account
together, we believe the coupling DNA motif pairs identified in this study can shed lights on the
gene transcription mechanism under long—range chromatin interactions.

Availability and implementation: The identified motif pair data is compressed and available in the
supplementary materials associated with this manuscript.

As one of the major gene regulation mechanisms, transcription fac—
tors (TF) can bind onto regulatory DNA elements in human and
other eukaryotes. Different binding combinations of TFs may result
in a gene being expressed in different tissues or at different develop—
mental stages. To fully understand gene regulation, it is essential to
identify the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) (Wong et 61].,
2013). TFBS are relatively short (5—15bp) and highly degenerate

tationally challenging task. A number of high-throughput eXperi-
mental and computational technologies were developed to
determine TFBSs. Databases have been developed to store the TFBS
(also known as DNA motif) data. Additional introduction can be
found in supplementary materials.

In recent years, thanks to its relatively low costs, neXt generation
sequencing technology is applied to thousands of genomes (Abecasis

et al., 2012). It creates unprecedented opportunities for understand—
ing DNA motifs; for instance, the ChIP—seq data from the ENCODE
consortium has enabled a systematic discovery and characterization
of DNA motifs in human cell lines (Kheradpour and Kellis, 2014).
Combining ChIP-seq and SELEX data, Jolma et al. have also charac—
terized the DNA—binding specificity landscape of human TFs (Jolma
et al., 2013). On the other hand, the Hi—C technology has been de—
veloped and applied to reveal the three dimensional shapes of differ-
ent cell lines by the chromosome conformation capture method
(Belton et al., 2012). In particular, there is increasing evidence that
long-range chromatin interactions are related to gene co—expression
(Babaei et al., 2015) as well as protein—DNA interactions (Mifsud et
al., 2015). Therefore, it is essential to comprehensively identify the
coupling DNA motif pairs on those long-range chromatin inter-
actions for understanding gene transcription.

2 Methods

2.1 Collecting long—range chromatin interactions

We have collected the Hi—C chromatin interaction pairs in the
human K5 62 cell line from Fit-Hi-C (Ay et al., 2014). To accommo—
date the Hi—C data resolution, each interaction region mid-point is
extended to 50 000 bp in both directions (Wong et al., 2015). We set
the q—value threshold to 0.1 to ensure that only highly confident
chromatin interaction pairs are adopted.

2.2 Collecting long—range regulatory region pairs

We have collected the human genome (hg19) segmentation data for
the human K5 62 cell line from ChromHMM and Segway (Hoffman
et al., 2012). To focus on gene regulation, we have limited our study
to the regulatory regions designated by both ChromHMM and
Segway (i.e. WE (Weak Enhancer), E (Enhancer), TSS (Promoter)
and PF (Promoter-Flanking Region)). On the other hand, taking into
account both regulatory region information and Hi-C chromatin
interaction pairing information, we check their overlapping regions
to create datasets of regulatory region pairs which are in close prox-
imity to each other by long—range chromatin interactions. The regu—
latory region pairs with less than 30 nt on either side are discarded
because the maximal DNA motif width is set to 25 nt (Kheradpour
and Kellis, 2014). The resultant 74 552 long—range regulatory region
pairs are listed in supplementary data which are summarized in
Supplementary Figure Sl. On Supplementary Figure Sl, it can be
observed that the number of E—WE (Enhancer—Weak Enhancer)
pairs is the highest, followed by E—E (Enhancer—Enhancer) pairs and
TSS—E (Promoter—Enhancer) pairs. The latter two pair types are ex—
pected to be of high frequency except the top one (E—WE), implying
that E—WE pairs may play a previously uncharacterized but import—
ant role in long-range gene regulation.

2.3 De novo motif discovery

Based on the long—range regulatory region pairs collected, we have
retrieved their corresponding sequences on which DNA motifs can
be discovered. We have run the motif discovery program (MEME
(Bailey and Elkan, 1994)) on the sequences of each side of each type
of long—range regulatory pairs, resulting in 19491 DNA motif pairs
which are composed of 4227 DNA motifs discovered by MEME
(Bailey and Elkan, 1994). The DNA motif pair results are described
and listed in supplementary data and summarized in Supplementary
Figure S2.

2.4 Motif pair type enrichment

To quantify the region pair enrichment, assuming each motif is equally
likely to be coupled with another motif on the same chromosome, we
have applied the binomial test to calculate the P—values (PXYC) for the
enrichment of the occurrence counts of different motif pair types
(X — Y) on each chromosome (C). The mathematical calculations can
be found in supplementary materials. In summary, the resultant en—
richment P—values are visualized in Supplementary Figure S3. It can be
observed that the DNA motif pairs on the promoter and enhancer re-
gion pairs (TSS—TSS, TSS—E and E—E) are significantly enriched and
identified than the other DNA motif pairs. On the other hand, the
DNA motif pairs on the weak enhancer region pairs are also slightly
enriched if the other partner region is either promoter or enhancer
(TSS—WE and E—WE). In contrast, the depletion has also been visual—
ized in Supplementary Figure S4. It can be observed that the motif
pairs involving promoter-ﬂanking (PF) are highly depleted. On the
other hand, it is also intriguing for us to look at the motif pairs under
different genomic distance conditions. Therefore, we have further div—
ided each motif pair type to different genomic distance subclasses
based on their genomic distances. Specifically, for each chromosome,
we observed that the empirical genomic distance distribution for all
the motif pairs follows the normal distribution. Therefore, we define
the following descriptive genomic distance terms ‘near’, ‘mean’ and
‘far’ for the motif pairs with genomic distances under the following
intervals (—00, u — o), [u — o, u + o], (u + 6, +00). The results are
visualized in Supplementary Figure S5. The exact binomial test calcu—
lation procedure can be found in supplementary materials. In sum-
mary, it can be observed that different chromosomes have different
enrichment of motif pair types with different genomic distances.

3 Results
3.1 Matching to annotated DNA motifs using TomTom

After we have found the DNA motifs on those long—range chromatin
interaction regions, we are especially interested in how those motifs
are overlapped with the existing DNA motif data. Therefore, we
have run TomTom (Gupta et al., 2007) to perform database search
with the DNA motifs (under the default parameter setting of
TomTom). The results are visualized in Supplementary Figure S5 . It
can be observed that nearly half of the identified DNA motifs can be
matched to existing DNA motif data.

3.2 Gene ontology enrichment using GOMO

On the other hand, the gene ontology enrichment of those identified
DNA motifs are also important for us to understand their functional
roles. Therefore, we have run GOMO (with its default setting) to cal—
culate the gene ontology enrichment for each of those DNA motifs
(Buske et al., 2010). Brieﬂy, GOMO scans all the human promoters
using each DNA motif and determine if any of them is significantly
associated with genes linked to one or more Gene Ontology (GO)
terms which are valuable to our understanding on the functions of
each DNA motif. The results are visualized in Supplementary Figure
S7. In general, it can be observed that over 90% of the identified
DNA motifs are enriched with at least one GO term (i.e. GO—enriched
on the horizontal axis) by GOMO (details can be found in supplemen—
tary materials). In particular, we observe the DNA—motif—related GO
terms among the top frequent terms (listed in supplementary mater—
ials) such as (GO:0010467 gene expression), (GO:0006139 nucleo—
base—containing compound metabolic process), (GO:003700
sequence—specific DNA binding transcription factor activity) and
(GO:00435 65 sequence—specific DNA binding). In addition, it may be

Identification of coupling DNA motif pairs

interesting for us to study the overlapping functional roles between
the two motifs coupled within each motif pair. Therefore, we have
computed the overlap coefficient (or, Szymkiewicz-Simpson coeffi-
cient) between the enriched GO terms of the first motif and those of
the second motif within each motif pair. The overlap coefficient re-
sults are visualized in Supplementary Figure SS. We can observe that
their overlap coefficients are substantially higher than the expected
one. In particular, the enriched GO terms of those DNA motifs on the
promoter-ﬂanking (PF) regions are very similar to those on the pro—
moter—related (TSS and PF) regions coupled, comparing to the other
motif pair type. It reﬂects that some functional consistency is expected
if a DNA motif pair belongs to the two promoter types.

3.3 Motif pairing multiplicity

Since coupling DNA motif pairs are identified in this study, another
interesting aspect is on the pairing multiplicity of those DNA motifs
(i.e. the number of motifs coupled with a given motif on long-range
regulatory pairs). Therefore, we have plotted the motif pairing
multiplicity against different region types as depicted in Figure 1.
Interestingly, we found that the motif pairing multiplicity distribu-
tion for the DNA motifs on the promoter (TSS) and enhancer (E) re—
gions are quite different from those on the other (PF and WE)
regions, reflecting the long-range coupling motif pairing complexity
involved in the gene transcription initiation process. In addition, we
observe that the multiplicity distribution of the DNA motifs identi-
fied on the weak enhancer (WE) regions are heavily tailed toward
zero. It may indicate that those DNA motifs are rather singular than
the others which are also reﬂected from the functional consistency
within pairs in Supplementary Figure SS.

On motif pair coupling level, we may also wonder if there is any re—
lationship between the first motif multiplicity and the second motif
multiplicity. In other words, if a motif is coupled with many motifs,
how likely its coupled motifs are also coupled with many other motifs.
Interestingly, it can be observed from Supplementary Figure S9 that,
given a motif pair, if the two motifs belong to the same type (i.e. E—E,
TSS—TSS and WE—WE), their multiplicities are positively correlated to
each other except PF—PF which does not have sufficient samples to be
concluded with its confidence interval. We also observe that, given a
motif pair, if the two motifs belong to one of those three classes (i.e.
TSS—E, TSS—WE and E—WE), the positive correlation phenomenon still
holds, although it appears not to be as strong as the previous cases.

3.4 Sequence pattern degeneracy
It is well known that DNA motif sequence degeneracy varies across
different DNA motifs from different species (Jolma et al., 2013) and

different biotechnologies (Orenstein and Shamir, 2014). Therefore,
it is intuitive for us to study the sequence degeneracy of the DNA
motifs identified in this study. In particular, we have adopted the de
facto measure, Shannon information entropy (Schug et al., 2005), to
measure the sequence degeneracy for each DNA motif matrix col-
umn. Since motif sequence degeneracy is linked to the protein—DNA
binding dynamics (Stormo, 2000), it is essential to decipher its rela—
tionship with the others. In this study, we found an interesting rela—
tionship between motif sequence degeneracy and motif multiplicity
as depicted in Figure 2. We observe that the motif sequence degener—
acy gets heavily tailed toward the conserved direction as motif
multiplicity is increased from left to right. One of the possible ex—
planations is that a DNA motif has to be solid in its sequence pattern
to play its functional roles, increasing its motif multiplicity.

3.5 DNase hypersensitivity

In addition to sequence pattern degeneracy, another important consid—
eration is the spatial accessibility of those DNA motifs. Therefore, we
have collected the DNase ChIP—seq peak—calling data in the K5 62 cell
line (ngncodeUWDukeDnaseK562.fdr01peaks.hg19.bb) from the
ENCODE consortium (Consortium, 2012). For each DNA motif, we
count how many of its motif instances overlap with those DNase
hypersensitive sites (peaks) on the reference human genome (hg19), re-
sulting in a measurement called ‘DNase Peak Fraction’ in this study.
The overlapping results are visualized in Supplementary Figure 810. To
quantify the statistical significance on the overlapping fractions, for
each DNA motif instance, we randomly sample 100 positions of the
same motif width on the regulatory regions and the entire regions on
the same chromosome to compute for the regulatory region back—
ground DNase peak fractions and overall background DNase peak
fractions for each chromosome respectively (denoted as regulatory re—
gion background (R) and background (BG) on Supplementary Fig.
810). We have also computed t—tests and Mann—Whitney tests to quan—
tify the statistical significance of the difference between the discovered
motifs and those background regions as listed in supplementary mater—
ials. We observe that all of the P—values are less than 0.01. It supports
our observation that the DNA motifs identified are substantially over—
lapping with the DNase hypersensitive sites (peaks), comparing to the
overall background (BG), although it is less pronounced for the regula—
tory background (R).

Another interesting phenomenon we observed is that the DNase
peak fraction is positively correlated to the number of enriched GO
terms (i.e. GOMO hits). It is depicted in Supplementary Figure S11.
A possible explanation is that a DNA motif has to be spatially ac—
cessible to DNA—binding proteins to carry out its gene regulation

functions (i.e. open chromatin). Similar observation can be made
from the motif pairing multiplicity with DNase peak fraction in
Supplementary Figure 812, in which motif pairing multiplicity is
negatively correlated to DNase peak fraction. It suggests that, if a
DNA motif is highly coupled with other DNA motifs, its spatial ac—
cessibility may be suppressed in cells (i.e. closed chromatin).

3.6 Motif pairing distance
Since those identified motif pairs are found associative to each other
on chromatin interaction regions, the actual genomic distances be—
tween their motif instances are worth for investigation further. In
particular, it is generally believed that some enhancers can act in a
very long range to regulate promoters, and thus gene transcription
(Carter et al., 2002). Therefore, we have grouped the motif pairs by
types and plotted their genomic distances on Figure 3. Interestingly,
we found that the motif pairs involving enhancer (E) or weak enhancer
(WE) regions are more segregated than the others. It is consistent with
the general belief that the regulatory components on enhancer regions
are generally far from their acting partners by large genomic distances.
Next, we investigate how the motif pairing distances of the cou—
pling DNA motif pairs may inﬂuence themselves. Interestingly, we
observe that the more distant a coupled motif pair is separated in gen—
omic distance, the lower its two DNA motifs’ multiplicities are, as
shown in Supplementary Figure 813. Such phenomenon is especially
visible with the motif pairs found on promoter—enhancer (TSS—E) re-
gions which are the core components for gene transcription.

4 Discussion

The DNA motifs on gene regulatory regions are believed to play cen—
tral roles in gene transcription. In particular, their spatial organiza-
tion can determine their functional roles in gene transcription.
Therefore, we have identified thousands of coupling DNA motif
pairs on the human gene regulatory regions under long—range chroma-
tin interactions. Those motif pairs have been characterized at different
levels: region type enrichment, existing motif annotation matching,
gene ontology enrichment and consistency, motif pairing multiplicity
and transitivity, sequence pattern degeneracy, DNase accessibility and
pairing genomic distance. Different relationships have been found be—
tween those attributes. In particular, we observe that motif pairing
multiplicity is an important attribute which is correlated to some of
the aforementioned attributes. In summary, this study provides a valu—
able resource for coupling DNA motif pairing information in human.

In the future, similar coupling DNA motif pairs in other cell lines
from different species can be identified for comparative studies if the
genome segmentation and Hi—C data availability issues can be allevi—
ated. The data integration with ChIA—PET data is another promising
direction (Li et al., 2010), although each ChIA-PET run is limited to
the DNA motifs of a single DNA-binding protein. The DNA motif
pairing information in this study could be adopted for integrative ana—
lysis with the existing ChIP—seq studies, improving our understandings
on protein—DNA binding. Finding the coupling sets of 3 or more
DNA motifs is another interesting future direction.

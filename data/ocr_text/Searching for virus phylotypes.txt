ABSTRACT

Motivation: Large phylogenies are being built today to study virus
evolution, trace the origin of epidemics, establish the mode of trans-
mission and survey the appearance of drug resistance. However, no
tool is available to quickly inspect these phylogenies and combine
them with extrinsic traits (e.g. geographic location, risk group, pres-
ence of a given resistance mutation), seeking to extract strain groups
of specific interest or requiring surveillance.

Results: We propose a new method for obtaining such groups, which
we call phylotypes, from a phylogeny having taxa (strains) annotated
with extrinsic traits. Phylotypes are subsets of taxa with close phylo-
genetic relationships and common trait values. The method combines
ancestral trait reconstruction using parsimony, with combinatorial and
numerical criteria measuring tree shape characteristics and the diver-
sity and separation of the potential phylotypes. A shuffling procedure
is used to assess the statistical significance of phylotypes. All algo-
rithms have linear time complexity. This results in low computing
times, typically a few minutes for the larger data sets with a number
of shuffling steps. Two HIV-1 data sets are analyzed, one of which is
large, containing >3000 strains of HIV-1 subtype C collected world-
wide, where the method shows its ability to recover known clusters
and transmission routes, and to detect new ones.

Availability: This method and companion tools are implemented in
an interactive Web interface (www.phylotype.org), which provides a
wide choice of graphical views and output formats, and allows for
exploratory analyses of large data sets.

1 INTRODUCTION

Phylogenetic tools are commonly used to study virus evolution
(Grenfell et al., 2004), trace the origin of epidemics (Keele et al.,
2006), establish the mode of transmission (Hue et al., 2005),
survey the apparition of drug resistances (Hue et al., 2009) or
determine virus origin in different body compartments (Lamers
et al., 2011). The process involves the construction of phylogen-
etic trees, their visualization (e. g. Zaslavsky et al., 2008) and their

interpretation. Ancestral character reconstruction methods aid
the interpretation, as extrinsic traits and their evolution can be
mapped on the tree. Parsimony has been one of the first
approaches to reconstruct ancestral characters. This method is
remarkably fast, does not require any model assumption and is
implemented in several popular phylogenetic programs (e.g.
MacClade, Maddison and Maddison, 2003). More sophisticated,
model-based, maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods
were developed for reconstructing ancestral characters (e.g.
SIMMAP, Bollback, 2006; Lagrange, Ree and Smith, 2008).
These methods are generally accepted to be more accurate
than parsimony and account for various sources of uncertainty.
However, they are time-consuming with large data sets and
require a realistic evolutionary model to be available for the
trait being considered. This is not an easy step, even with stand-
ard traits such as geographic location or morphological
characters.

Despite the number of methods available for the inference of
ancestral traits, there is little development for the interpretation
of trait-annotated phylogenies. Most of the programs display
the reconstructed ancestral states but do not allow for tests on
ancestry and taxon clustering. For example, MacClade recon-
structs ancestral characters and maps them in the phylogeny,
but the resulting annotated tree needs to be interpreted visually.
Other ML and Bayesian programs, such as BEAST (Drummond
et al., 2012), simultaneously reconstruct ancestral states and the
phylogeny, and allow for testing. However, because of this sim-
ultaneous reconstruction, they need to be re-launched entirely
when new traits are analyzed, which, combined with their
computational heaviness, renders it difficult in the exploratory
stages to select relevant traits for the data at hand. Moreover,
model-based programs are mostly intended to speciﬁc trait types
(e.g. geographical location, Lemey et al., 2009, or molecular
characters with SIMMAP). Finally, most (if not all) of ML
and Bayesian programs are not able to deal with the huge
amount of virus sequences available today, with data sets com-
monly comprising several thousand strains.

There is a need for a fast easy-to-use exploratory tool that
can use phylogenies constructed with any of the most popular
methods, while providing fast inference of ancestral traits and
enabling hypothesis testing and visual data interpretation of evo-
lutionary scenarios. In this article, we use and formally define,
the concept of “viral phylotype”. Commonly, a phylotype is a
biological type that classiﬁes an organism by its phylogenetic

relationship to other organisms. The term phylotype is
taxon-neutral, thus one can choose the phylogenetic level at
which the phylotype is described, depending on the question
being examined. The term is commonly used in microbiology,
and several tools have been developed to infer bacteria phylo-
types (e.g. RAMI, Pommier et al., 2009) or to study them from
an ecological perspective (e.g. Picante, Kembel et al., 2010, for
analyzing the phylogenetic and trait diversity of ecological com-
munities). Here we adopt a more speciﬁc virus view, combining
(ancestral) traits with combinatorial and numerical criteria mea-
suring tree shape characteristics and the diversity and separation
of the phylotypes. Traits of extant and ancestral nodes are used
to assess the relevance of phylotypes for the question being ad-
dressed. Numerical criteria are analogous to those used to deﬁne
and study bacteria phylotypes. This method is implemented in
“PhyloType”, a user-friendly Web interface that uses parsimony
to reconstruct ancestral traits and a number of criteria to select
phylotypes. A shufﬂing procedure is used to assess the signiﬁ-
cance of this selection process. The method is fast, allowing for
the analysis of phylogenies comprising several thousands of taxa
(strains). In the following, we describe the method and the Web
interface, then show its application on two data sets, dealing
with the epidemiological history of HIV-1 subtype A (HIV-1A)
in Albania (Salemi et al., 2008), and the global epidemic of
HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) using a large data set comprising
~3000 strains collected worldwide (Jung et al., 2012).

2 METHODS, CRITERIA AND ALGORITHMS

2.1 Phylotype deﬁnition and interpretation,
method outline

A phylotype is a subset of studied taxa (strains) that share a
common history. This history is 2-fold:

The ﬁrst component is a phylogeny T of all taxa studied,
which is one of the inputs of the method. The quality and rele-
vance of results will, of course, depend on the accuracy of T, but
T is not questioned in the analyses. T must be rooted and, again,
the correctness of root location is essential. T may or may not be
equipped with branch supports (e.g. bootstrap). More relevant
results are obtained when branch supports are available and only
well-supported parts of T are used. Clades (rooted subtrees) are
the standard way to deﬁne subsets of taxa with common history
from a rooted phylogeny. Here, a phylotype must be included in
a clade of T, and the root of this clade must be the most recent
common ancestor (MRCA) of the members of the phylotype.
This MRCA is also called the root of the phylotype. In some
cases (e. g. when studying the geographical origin of an epidemic),
the common clade will be the entire phylogeny T. The common
clade and MRCA property deﬁne the phylogenetic component
of the common history of phylotypes.

The second component of this common history is induced by a
set of traits or annotations attached to each of the taxa. For
example, these annotations may describe the country of origin,
the presence of a given resistance mutation, the risk group, the
mode of transmission and so forth. These annotations are pro-
vided by the user and are the second input of the method.
They are called primary annotations and can be combined in
the Web interface to obtain, for example, secondary annotations

representing regions of the globe by making a logical ‘OR’ of
several countries. Different sets and combinations of annotations
can be quickly explored, thanks to the speed of the method.
Annotations used in a single analysis are mutually exclusive,
but they may not be exhaustive (i.e. each taxon has at most
one annotation).

Beyond phylogeny, the members of a given phylotype share
the same evolutionary history regarding the annotations being
analyzed. The phylotype root must have a unique annotation,
say A, which lasted until extant phylotype members that are
annotated by A. Formally, within a clade with root r, every
taxon x sharing the same annotation A as r, and for which
A is conserved along the path from r to x, belongs to the phy-
lotype deﬁned by r and A (assuming the MRCA condition is
fulﬁlled). As ancestral annotations are unknown, some inference
method must be used. The PhyloType software currently uses
parsimony, but other approaches are possible. Figure 1 presents
examples to illustrate the phylotype concept:

0 Figure 1a displays a phylotype that is as simple as possible.
All taxa of the clade are marked by annotation A as well as
the clade root and all intermediate nodes. Such a phylotype
typically corresponds to the appearance of a new strain in a
given country.

0 Figure 1b shows an “intermediary” A phylotype, included in
a clade that comprises taxa not annotated with A. Some of
these non-A taxa belong to a (simple) B phylotype. Some
others seem to be randomly mixed with the members of
the A phylotype. Such a phylotype is typically seen with
epidemics that start to break out from their country of
origin (A).

o In Figure 10, we see a “complex” or “ancient” phylotype.
The original annotation, A, has become rare. The
phylotype clade contains several nested Clades deﬁning
sub-phylotypes, one of which annotated with A. Such a
phylotype may correspond to ancient epidemics that have
widely diffused among non-A taxa and have returned
back to A.

Phylotypes may thus be simple Clades (Fig. 1a), but they may
also form hierarchical chains showing the succession of founder
events (Fig. 1b and c). The approach differs from that commonly
used for bacteria (e.g. RAMI, Pommier et al., 2009; see also
Zaslavsky et al., 2008, for application to viruses), where Clades
with low genetic diversity are aggregated, producing clusters

similar to our simple phylotypes. Here, a phylotype is a (poten-
tial) founder event associated with a unique annotation, for
example, a country. Consider two phylotypes P A and PB, anno-
tated with A and B respectively, with P A being the origin of PB as
shown in Figure 1b and 10. This means that a strain (not neces-
sarily originating from A) started to spread in A and produced a
number of variants, one of which went to B, resulting in a new
founder event PB. P A may be the origin of several founder events
in B. The link between PA and PB may be direct (A or B belong
to the annotation set of every node in the path from PA to PB
roots) or indirect (some nodes contains annotations that all differ
from A and B).

The method to extract phylotypes can be summarized as
follows (details are provided in the following sub-sections):

o Inference of ancestral annotations using parsimony.

o This ancestral reconstruction induces a set of potential
phylotypes deﬁned by the MRCA and path-conservation
conditions (see above).

0 Combinatorial, numerical and statistical criteria are used to
select a set of relevant phylotypes from among all potential
phylotypes.

2.2 Reconstruction of ancestral annotations

The PhyloType software uses parsimony to reconstruct ancestral
annotations. To deal with incomplete information, we assume
that non-annotated taxa are associated with the set of all possible
annotations; other (informed) taxa must have a unique annota-
tion. Annotations are treated as non-ordered discrete characters.
Moreover, we assume that annotation changes are not oriented
and thus use Fitch parsimony. Two standard options are avail-
able: ACCTRAN and DELTRAN (Swofford and Maddison,
1987). Both perform two tree traversals associating each tree
node with the set of most parsimonious annotations, and requir-
ing 0(nv) computing time to analyze a tree with n taxa and v
annotations. The ﬁrst bottom-up tree traversal is common to
ACCTRAN and DELTRAN; it recursively computes the most
parsimonious annotation sets associated to tree nodes with
respect to their descendants. ACCTRAN and DELTRAN
differ in the second top-down tree traversal to account for the
three neighboring subtrees of a given node and resolve ambigu-
ities: ACCTRAN chooses reversals over parallelisms when the
choice is equally parsimonious, while DELTRAN does the
opposite and favors parallelisms. ACCTRAN is typically used
with morphological characters, while DELTRAN is often used
with geographic annotations (e.g. Wallace et al., 2007). Both
procedures are based on extreme opposite choices to solve ambi-
guities, and it is a good practice to run both and compare the
results to check that they are (nearly) identical. Note, however,
that both ACCTRAN and DELTRAN may be unable to solve
some ambiguities; the corresponding nodes then have “multiple”
annotations. Moreover, the accuracy and relevance of ancestral
annotations (and thus of the whole analysis) may depend on the
representativity of the sample of sequences; if certain annotations
are clearly over-represented, then parsimony (and any ancestral
reconstruction method) will tend to over-predict those annota-
tions, thus producing erroneous results. This phenomenon may
become signiﬁcant if, in addition, the tree contains numerous

phylogenetic errors that spread over-represented annotations
throughout the tree.

The potential phylotypes are deﬁned by the Clades having a
unique annotation at their root. Phylotype members are obtained
by following the paths where this annotation is conserved and
unique, and the MRCA condition is accounted for by using the
Persistence criterion (see below).

2.3 Combinatorial and numerical criteria

Combinatorial and numerical criteria are used to measure the rele-
vance of potential phylotypes. A number of criteria are available in
the Web interface. The choice of criteria and selection thresholds is
left to users, who will test them interactively until a consistent and
statistically supported picture is obtained. However, some min-
imal constraints (see below) are imposed to avoid meaningless
analyses. All criteria are deﬁned recursively and globally com-
puted for all potential phylotypes in O(n) time (see
Supplementary Material for formal deﬁnitions and algorithms).

Size This criterion simply counts the number of taxa (mem-
bers) in the potential phylotypes. Because having a phylotype
containing a single taxon is meaningless, we impose that Size
:2 is always present among phylotype selection criteria.
Moreover, it is possible to express that some taxa correspond
to several strains. We then count the number of strains in the
potential phylotypes, instead of the number of taxa (tree leaves).

Diﬁ‘erent This criterion measures the number of exceptions in
the potential phylotypes. Let P be a potential phylotype deﬁned
by clade C; Diﬁ‘erent counts the number of sub-Clades of C with
annotations differing from P’s annotation. When such a
sub-clade is found, it is counted as one, regardless of the
number of covered taxa. For example, Diﬁ‘erent is equal to 3
for both main A phylotypes in Figure 1b and lo.

Size/Diﬁ‘erent Size and Diﬂerent tend to be correlated. We
expect large values of Size to be associated to relatively large
values of Diﬂerent. To account for both criteria simultaneously,
we use their Size/Diﬁ‘erent ratio. Because having a phylotype
containing many taxa and sub-Clades with different annotations
is meaningless, we impose that Size/Diﬂerent with threshold 20.5
is always present among phylotype selection criteria. Default se-
lection threshold is :1.

Total This criterion counts the total number of taxa (strains) in
the clade deﬁning a potential phylotype, disregarding annota-
tions. This criterion combines Size (to be maximized) and
Diﬁ‘erent (to be minimized). To avoid conﬂicts with these two
criteria, Total cannot be retained to select phylotypes, but its
value may be of interest and is displayed by the software.

Persistence This criterion measures the extent to which the root
annotation A of the phylotype is conserved in its descendants. It
is equal to the minimum depth where A is conserved, among all
lineages starting from phylotype root. Persistence is used to pre-
vent a phylotype from having a direct root descendant with an-
notation different from that of the root. It is easily seen that
requiring Persistence to be >1 implies that the MRCA condition
is fulﬁlled (both direct descendants have A, and thus both direct

sub-Clades contain taxa annotated with A). This :1 constraint is
imposed in the interface, but larger thresholds can be chosen.

Local separation We expect phylotypes to be well separated
from the remaining taxa by a signiﬁcant number of shared mu-
tations. Local separation criterion is intended for this purpose
and is equal to the length (i.e. expected number of substitutions
per site) of the stemming branch of the phylotype. This criterion
is available in community phylogeny software packages (e.g.
RAMI, denoted as Ydepthjnearest).

Global separation For a number of reasons (e.g. reconstruction
errors), the stemming branch of a potential phylotype may be
short, while the other branches separating the phylotype and
phylogeny root are long and indicate a high separation of the
phylotype from the rest of the tree. For example, in Figure 2, we
see a large A phylotype with short stemming branch, but its sister
group contains a single taxon with annotation B, and the clade
joining both has a long stemming branch that should be ac-
counted for when measuring the separation of the A phylotype.
Global separation accounts for the lengths of all branches separ-
ating the phylotype and phylogeny root, but also incorporates
the number of taxa contained in the sister Clades encountered
along the path. With our example of Figure 2, Global separation
of the A phylotype is equal to s (local separation of A) plus s’
(local separation of A’s father) times a/(a + 1), where a is the
number of taxa in A, that is, nearly equal to s + s’. When the
clade with B contains a large number of taxa, Global separation
of the A phylotype is nearly equal to s.

This criterion is related to the Ydepthjdeepes, index provided by
RAMI in that it counts all branches separating the phylotype from
the tree root; however, Ydepth, deepest simply measures the total path
length and does not account for sister group sizes. Global separ-
ation is also related to average distance criteria, for example, mean
pairwise distance (MPD) in Picante, equal to the average distance
between any taxon in the studied cluster and any taxon outside
this cluster. An advantage of Global separation is that it requires
linear computing times, while using average distances between
taxon pairs requires (at least) quadratic computing times.

Diversity This criterion measures the genetic diversity of phy-
lotype members. It is equal to the average path-length distance
between the members of the phylotype and the phylotype root.

 

 

Fig. 2. Global separation and support. The respective sizes of A(= a >> 1)
and B (=1) are used to compute global criterion values (see text and
Supplementary Material for detailed formula and algorithm)

This criterion closely resembles the standard average genetic dis-
tance within the studied set of taxa (e.g. within-cluster MPD,
used Picante), but avoid quadratic-time computations. It is
close to Faith’s (1992) phylogenetic diversity (e.g. implemented
in RAMI and Picante), but does not depend on the number of
taxa.

Local and global separation/diversity Separation and diversity
indices depend on the tree scale. For trees with long branches,
these indices will both tend to be high, and vice versa. To com-
bine both aspects and avoid this scale effect, PhyloType provides
users with these ratios: Local separation/Diversity and Global
separation/Diversity.

Support Any branch support (e.g. bootstrap, Bayesian poster-
ior, aLRT) can be used to select phylotypes using a user-supplied
threshold.

Global support Just as with separation, Support may give a too
local view. For example, in Figure 2, assume that s and s’ refer to
branch supports, then the large A phylotype is well supported,
even if s is low. PhyloType thus uses Global support, which is
deﬁned recursively as Global separation, but turning the summa-
tion of branch lengths into a maximum of branch supports to
keep Global support less than the largest possible support value
(e.g. number of bootstrap replicates). In Figure 2, Global support
for the A phylotype is equal to Max{s, [a/(a + 1) x s’]} w s’.

2.4 Selection of most general phylotypes

Once all potential phylotypes have been evaluated using the cri-
teria and thresholds deﬁned by the user, we perform a top-down
tree traversal to select the most general phylotypes satisfying all
criteria. If an A phylotype satisfying all criteria is included in
another A phylotype satisfying all criteria, then only the most
general one will be selected, unless the path between the two
contains one (or more) node(s) not annotated with A; in that
case, both A phylotypes are selected. For example, in Figure
10, assuming that both A phylotypes satisfy all criteria, then
both are selected. In terms of infections and countries, this cor-
responds to an infection starting in A, diffused in B and then
returning in A. Similarly, we compute whether the origin of phy-
lotypes is direct or indirect (see above and Fig. 4 for examples).
The corresponding Search algorithm runs in 0(n) time and is
provided in Supplementary Material. Lastly, when all phylotypes
have been selected, we compute their values for all non-selection
criteria. These values are displayed by the Web interface to help
users to modify the selection criteria and analyze the results.

2.5 Assessing phylotype signiﬁcance using shufﬂing

Once a set of phylotypes has been selected from the data, an
essential question is whether or not these phylotypes have
some statistical signiﬁcance and clearly depart from a random
selection of taxon subsets within the input phylogeny. For this
purpose, we use a shufﬂing procedure, a common statistical tool
that is used for similar purposes in phylogenetic software pack-
ages (e.g. MacClade) and to study the phylogeography of virus
epidemics (e.g. Wallace et al., 2007). Here, we randomly shufﬂe
leaf annotations and proceed with phylotype selection using the
same procedure and selection criteria used for the original data.

Selection criteria (displayed with bold characters) are Size (Sz 35), Persistence (Ps 31), Size/Different (Sz/Df 31) and Support (Sp 370%). P—values (in italic) are given as
fractions, where the denominator indicates the number of shufﬂes. The analysis was run with ACCTRAN option. Pi, identiﬁer of phylotype root; Anc, phylotype origin; A,
annotation; Cov (%), coverage, i.e. percentage of taxa annotated with A that belongs to the phylotype; Tt, Total; $1, Local separation; Sg, Global separation; Dv, Diversity; Spg,
Global support; AnB, list of ‘Breaking’ annotations when the origin is indirect (see text and examples in Fig. 4).

This shufﬂing procedure is repeated a number of times, typically
100 or 1000, and P-values are computed. The implicit null hy-
pothesis is that the annotations are randomly associated with the
leaves of the tree. The P-value corresponds to the fraction of
shufﬂed data sets in which one ﬁnds a phylotype with the anno-
tation being evaluated and at least as large a criterion value as
the observed phylotype. For example, in Table 1, we see the
analysis performed with the HIV-1A, Albania data set (see
below). One thousand shufﬂes were performed. The ﬁrst Africa
phylotype with Size (Sz) 44 has a P-value equal to 0/1000 re-
garding this criterion, meaning that among the 1000 random
shufﬂes, none has been found with Africa annotation and Size
344; therefore, this phylotype is highly signiﬁcant regarding the
Size criterion. However, it is not signiﬁcant regarding the
Persistence criterion; the P-value is equal to 867/1000 meaning
that 867 shufﬂed data sets were found, with Africa annotation,
all selection criteria (Table 1) and Persistence 32. Globally this
phylotype is statistically signiﬁcant, as it is unlikely that such a
large phylotype can be found by chance. The second Albania
phylotype is statistically signiﬁcant (P-value 31%) for the
three selection criteria.

Size is the most discriminating criterion, and the use of the
shufﬂing procedure is especially relevant with this criterion.
Assume that some annotation is highly represented in the data
set; then we expect relatively large phylotypes having this anno-
tation to be found by chance. On the other hand, rare annota-
tions have a low probability of giving rise to phylotypes by
chance. The shufﬂing procedure quantiﬁes this random effect
and can be used with a user-supplied signiﬁcance level to discard
phylotypes that could be found by chance due to the abundance
of certain annotations. As multiple testing is performed, a low
signiﬁcance level (e. g. 1%) is recommended. Note, however, that
sample size plays a crucial role. With limited sampling, low-sized
non-signiﬁcant phylotypes are to be expected. With additional
samples, some of these phylotypes will become signiﬁcant and
the others will be discarded.

To obtain reliable P-value estimations, the number of shufﬂes
has to be large enough; for example, having a P-value = 0/ 10 (i.e.
with 10 shufﬂes) does not mean that the P-value is equal to 0.
This is why we prefer not to provide the P-value as a percentage.
Thanks to the speed of our selection algorithms, performing

shufﬂing with 1000 iterations still requires low computing
times, for example, ~12 min for the current version of the
Web interface (powered by Intel Xeon X5650 CPUs, without
any parallel implementation) with our large HIV-1C data set
comprising ~3000 taxa and 14 annotation values.

2.6 PhyloType Web interface

The Web interface (www.phylotype.org) divides PhyloType
analyses into the ﬁve steps summarized below. All required
details are provided in the downloadable User Guide. The
Web site includes data set examples showing the input formats
and expected output ﬁles.

Input This step enables to copy/paste or upload a phylogenetic
tree and its annotations. The tree is in Newick format with
branch lengths and branch supports (optional). Annotations
are in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format, possibly with
missing values. A third, optional, input is the number of strains
attached to each taxon (default is 1, see 2.3).

Tree This step is optional. Several methods (e. g. midpoint, out-
group) are available to root the tree, when the user tree is
unrooted. The Tree step enables a visualization of the tree with
the posting of branch lengths and supports.

Annotation This step is also optional. The interface displays the
annotation variables with all their possible values and respective
frequencies among taxa. The Annotation step allows for logical
combinations of annotations. For instance, an ‘OR’ connector
allows for the aggregation of values (e.g. making global ‘regions’
from ‘countries’ annotations). Other operators are available,
such as logical ‘AND’, duplication, deletion, etc. These combin-
ations of annotations can be downloaded for further analyses.

Analysis This step corresponds to the PhyloType analysis
itself. The user selects the criteria to be used for identifying phy-
lotypes. Twelve criteria are available (see 2.3). Each criterion has
a default threshold, which can be modiﬁed to be more or less
stringent. An annotation variable must be selected, and, for this
variable, a set of annotations to study is chosen. The parsimony
option (ACCTRAN or DELTRAN) is selected, as well as the

inclusion (or not) of the outgroup in the analysis. Lastly, the user
can decide to perform shufﬂing, deﬁne the number of iterations
and provide a P-value for phylotype selection using the Size
criterion. PhyloType results are ﬁrst summarized in an overview
table that displays the number of phylotypes for each annota-
tion value and various statistics (Supplementary Table S3).

available, such as phylogenies with color-encoded phylotypes or
phylotype maps (Figs 3 and 4). All the input/output are available
for download: original and rooted trees with node identiﬁers;
annotations (primary and combined); overview and detailed phy-
lotype tables; ready-to-print trees and map graphics in various
formats.

Implementation The PhyloType pipeline is based on Tcl/Tk
CGI scripts. PhyloType will be available soon as a free
stand-alone package for Windows and Unix-like systems, includ-
ing OSX. It will then be possible to integrate this tool in diverse
environments and virus database resources.

3 RESULTS WITH TWO HIV-1 DATA SETS

In this section, we show the application of PhyloType software
on two HIV-1 data sets, the ﬁrst one (HIV-1 subtype A) with
limited size to show the outputs and advantages of the method,
the second one (HIV-1 subtype C) to demonstrate its efﬁciency
to deal with large numbers of taxa and annotations. All input
data and PhyloType results are available from www.phylotype.
org/SupMat/.

3.1 Epidemiological history of HIV-1A in Albania

In this case, we applied PhyloType to a relatively small data set
of pol sequences from 152 HIV-1 subtype A strains. This data
set, the sequences and their alignment were derived from the
study by Salemi et al. (2008) on the origin of subtype A in
Albania, where this subtype is widespread, while the rest of
Europe is mostly affected by subtype B. The sequences used in
this study are from Africa (50) and Europe (102), with 31 se-
quences collected in Albania and 39 in Greece, the suspected
origin of the Albanian epidemic. The isolate HXB2 (HIV-1B)
was used as the outgroup. As in Salemi et al. (2008), the phyl-
ogeny was inferred by ML. We used PhyML (Guindon et al.,
2010) with GTR+I+F4 (following jModelTest, Posada, 2008),
the SPR option to search the tree topology and aLRT SH-like
branch supports.

The primary annotations in this data set are the countries in
which the studied sequences were collected. These annotations
were grouped into ﬁve geographic zones (as in Fig. 1a of Salemi
et al., 2008): Africa, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Greece
and Albania (see Supplementary Table S1 for details). The cri-
teria chosen for the PhyloType analysis were Size 35, Persistence
31, Size/Diﬁ‘erent 31 and Support 30.7. The ACCTRAN par-
simony method was selected and 1000 shufﬂes were performed to
test phylotype signiﬁcance. Only those phylotypes whose P-value
for Size is 31% were retained. These options, selection criteria
and thresholds correspond to PhyloType’s default parameter
settings.

Results are provided in Table 1 and Figure 3, which shows two
types of graphical outputs provided by PhyloType: (a) a phyl-
ogeny in which the selected phylotypes are represented by col-
ored regions; (b) a phylotype map that indicates the succession of
founder and migratory events. DELTRAN results are nearly
identical, the only difference (Supplementary Fig. S1) is that
the large African phylotype includes six additional sequences
due to the removal of some ancestral ambiguities. Moreover,

we checked the robustness of the results regarding selection par-
ameters. We observed high stability (see Supplementary Fig. S2
for details), except when (as expected) we used a low Size thresh-
old of 3 and did not perform any shufﬂing, which resulted in
artifactual phylotypes. This illustrates the interest of the shufﬂing
procedure, which should be used in all analyses to discard
non-signiﬁcant phylotypes.

Four phylotypes are found (Table 1) covering 72% of the
sequences: an ancestral African phylotype (containing 88% of
African strains); a Greek phylotype, clearly supported, with
most of Greek strains (69%); a small East European phylotype
[8 strains out of 10; 4 (out of 5) are Czech]; an Albanian phylo-
type with Greek origin containing almost all Albanian strains
(97%), with strong aLRT support (0.96) and high signiﬁcance.
PhyloType analysis thus reaches the same main conclusions as
Salemi et al. (2008): ‘The ﬁnding that 99% of the HIV-1A
Albanian sequences could be traced back to a unique MRCA
suggests a single major introduction of HIV-1A from Greece
followed by local epidemic spread’. One can also see the import-
ance of allowing exceptions in these analyses, as the large Greek
phylotype includes one Albanian sequence (outside the Albanian
phylotype), whereas the Albanian phylotype includes two Greek
sequences. As noted by Salemi et al. (2008), ‘This could indicate
a limited ongoing viral gene ﬂow between the two neighboring
countries’. One can also observe multiple introductions of
HIV-1A in Europe, including in Greece. Lastly, the analysis
reveals the small East European phylotype, not pointed out by
Salemi et al. (2008), but which is highly signiﬁcant (Table 1). This
phylotype contains most of the East European strains, plus one
Greek exception, and has aLRT support of 1.0. It could corres-
pond to a founder event followed by restricted spreading in
Eastern Bloc countries, before its transformation. Additional
studies and sequences would be necessary to conﬁrm this hypoth-
esis. However, we see here the advantage of a fast method
such as PhyloType, which makes it possible to reveal and quan-
tify (objective selection criteria, statistical signiﬁcance using
shufﬂing) the presence of clusters of interest, a task that is
difﬁcult to achieve using visual inspection, even on such a
small data set.

3.2 Worldwide evolutionary history of HIV-1C

To demonstrate the abilities and efﬁciency of PhyloType, we
applied the software to a large amount of data related to the
HIV-1 subtype C epidemic on a worldwide scale. This subtype
is the cause of nearly half of all HIV-1 infections. It is highly
prevalent in southern and eastern (mainly Burundi and Ethiopia)
Africa, along with irregular distribution throughout the rest of
the world, including some highly contaminated countries such as
India (Hemelaar et al., 2011). We used the pol sequences of (Jung
et al., 2012), corresponding to all subtype C pol data available
in the Los Alamos HIV database at the time of this study,
to which 18 sequences from Senegal were added. We removed
45 sequences indicated as recombinant using the last version of
SCUEAL (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2009), thus obtaining a set of
3036 ingroup sequences collected in 60 countries (Supplementary
Table S2). Moreover, to root the tree, we added 35 reference
outgroup sequences extracted from the Los Alamos HIV data-
base (non-C, subtype A to K). The phylogeny was constructed

using PhyML with GTR+I+F4, SPR option and aLRT SH-like
branch supports. All alignment sites were used to build this tree,
including sites associated to drug resistances, as their deletion
showed little impact (Jung et al., 2012; see this article for details
on data, alignment and phylogeny calculation).

As with the previous study, we grouped countries in major
areas to have enough strains for each group and to be able to ex-
tract synthetic and signiﬁcant information. A total of 14 groups
were used (see Supplementary Table S2 for details and
Supplementary Figs S4 and S5 for other groupings and
corresponding results): Central Africa [644 strains, mostly from
Zambia, plus a few strains collected in the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) near the Zambian border]; South Africa
(including Swaziland, 731 strains); Southern Africa (other south-
ern Africa countries, 328 strains); East Africa (188 strains, mostly
from Burundi and Tanzania); Horn of Africa (118 strains, mostly
from Ethiopia); West Africa (63 strains, mostly from Senegal);
Asia (366, mostly from India); South America (245, mostly from
Brazil); Central America (26, mostly from Cuba); North America
(9, all from the USA); Northern (106), Western (67), Southern
(92) and Eastern (53) Europe.

The selection criteria for PhyloType were Size 310, Persistence
31, Size/Diﬁ‘erent 31 and Support 30.7, that is, the default par-
ameter setting, except for Size (10 instead of 5) because of the
large sample used here. The inﬂuence of these parameters is
studied in the Supplementary Material and discussed below.
We used both ACCTRAN and DELTRAN with 1000 shufﬂes
and a signiﬁcance level for the Size criterion of 1%. The results
with ACCTRAN are reported in Figure 4, Supplementary
Tables S3 and S4. Eighteen phylotypes are found covering
58% of the sequences (results with DELTRAN are similar, see
Supplementary Fig. S3 and further discussion):

Epicenter in Central Africa The analysis suggests (phylotype
no. 1, coverage of 69%) that the epicenter of the HIV-1C epi-
demic is located in southern Central Africa. This annotation in-
cludes strains collected in Zambia and DRC. The latter was
previously identiﬁed as being the epicenter of viruses belonging
to the pandemic group M of HIV-1 (Vidal et al., 2000).
Nonetheless, the root of this phylotype does not correspond to
the root of the phylogeny, and it is possible that the origin of
HIV-1C is located in a different region, just as is the case for
HIV-1M itself (Keele et al., 2006).

Dissemination around the African continent The virus spread
from Central Africa across the entire African continent, that is,
directly into Southern African countries (phylotype no. 4578),
South Africa (nos. 964 and 1455), East Africa (no. 4844), West
Africa (no. 398) and Horn of Africa (no. 183), or indirectly to
the Horn of Africa (nos. 4913, 4974 and 5063) and Southern
African countries (no. 1488), passing through East and South
Africa, respectively. The direct ﬁliation from East Africa to
Horn of Africa is doubtful for two phylotypes (nos. 4913, 4974)
with ACCTRAN, as the links are broken by Northern
Europe annotations (Fig. 4), but this ﬁnding is not observed
with DELTRAN (Supplementary Fig. S3), which infers a direct
origin in both cases. Even if they differ slightly, the two parsimony
options establish a dual geographical (Central and East Africa)
origin of the Horn of Africa epidemic, which could be a plausible

explanation for the observation of the C and C’ sub-clusters in
Ethiopia (Abebe et al., 2000). Thomson and Fernandez-Garcia
(2011) demonstrated that the majority of East and Horn of Africa
strains are grouped within one clade, as our analysis suggests once
again (phylotype no. 4844), with the exception of the small Horn
of Africa phylotype no. 183 (directly descending from Central
Africa). With ACCTRAN, PhyloType ﬁnds a Central Africa phy-
lotype (no. 4179) that is a descendant of the major Central Africa
phylotype (no. 1); the origin is indirect, possibly indicating a sym-
metrical ﬂow and a return of the epidemic to the center from
southern regions, but DELTRAN does not conﬁrm this ﬁnding
and groups the corresponding strains into a single large ancestral
Central Africa phylotype (coverage of 86%). Lastly, we reach the
prediction made in (Jung et al., 2012) on a possible Zambian
origin of the HIV-1C epidemic in Senegal (WestAfrica phylotype
no. 398), especially in the MSM population. However, the African
phylotypes altogether cover only ~50% of the African strains:
some regions are well-covered (>70%, Central Africa, East
Africa, Horn of Africa), some are in between (~50%, South
and West Africa), while the Southern African countries
(Botswana, Mozambique, Malawi...) have a low coverage
(~12%), likely due to their passing position between Central
Africa and South Africa, with numerous introductions and
bi-directional exchanges.

From Central Africa to Asia Our analysis indicates that the two
Asian phylotypes (nos. 2866 and 3321, total coverage of 96%)
originated in southern Central Africa (phylotype no. 1), which
differs from the origin predicted for India (97% of Asian strains)
by (Shen et al., 2011), suggesting South Africa instead. However,
this study used few strains from Zambia (<50) and was based on
the env gene. Moreover, a recent study performed on the three
genes (gag, pol and env) was not able to determine the origin of
the Indian cluster in any of those genes (Neogi et al., 2012).
Their analysis, like our own, suggests that the HIV-1C epidemic
in India was subject to multiple introductions with a major
cluster.

Multiple introductions into Europe The Western Europe phylo-
type (no. 4310, descendant of Central Africa) only includes
strains originating from Belgium, a country with historical and
economic links with DRC. The Eastern Europe phylotype
(no. 789) also contains strains from Romania exclusively.
However, a small fraction (~33%) of the strains from Belgium
and Romania are included in these two phylotypes, and most of
the European strains (93%) are not included in any phylotype.
This conﬁrms multiple introductions and complex transmission
chains of HIV-1C in Europe, as already pointed out in numerous
studies.

From East Africa to South America The analysis suggests that
the HIV-1C epidemic propagated from East Africa (phylotype
no. 4844) towards South America (no. 5204, coverage of 99%), a
link already identiﬁed on several occasions (e.g. Veras et al.,
2011). Let us note that, with this data set containing few strains
(3) collected in England, it is not possible to conﬁrm or inﬁrm the
hypothesis that England played a key role in spreading HIV-1C
in Brazil (de Oliveira et al., 2010).

Searching for virus phylotypes

 

Origin of the epidemic in Cuba The Central America phylotype
(no. 5077, coverage of 65%) contains strains from Cuba exclu-
sively, a country with numerous links to Africa. With
ACCTRAN (Fig. 4), we ﬁnd a transmission chain from East
Africa to Horn of Africa and then Central America, while with
DELTRAN (Supplementary Fig. S3) the intermediary Horn of
Africa step is not found and the ﬁliation from East Africa to
Central America (i.e. Cuba) is direct. Note, however, that 35%
of Central America strains are not covered by any phylotype,
which suggest multiple introductions into Cuba and surrounding
countries.

Discussion, influence of options and selection parameters As
ACCTRAN and DELTRAN are two heuristics performing ex-
treme choices to solve ancestral annotation ambiguities, their
comparison enables us to check the robustness of results regard-
ing parsimony-based ancestral reconstructions. We have already
indicated above certain differences between the two analyses. A
general trend (with this data set and others) is that DELTRAN
returns fewer ancestral ambiguities and fewer indirect origins
than ACCTRAN (none versus ﬁve, Supplementary Fig. S3).
As a consequence, DELTRAN covers more sequences than
ACCTRAN (64% versus 58%) and ﬁnds one more phylotype
(19 versus 18). Moreover, six small phylotypes (<150 sequences
in total) are found by one method but not the other. However,
both methods mostly agree. A number of phylotypes are iden-
tical (8) or nearly indentical (7 with similarity >80%) in both
analyses, and the geographical history is the same for 88% of
the covered sequences (see Supplementary Fig. S3 for more re-
sults and explanations on these measures). Overall, this com-
parison gives us high conﬁdence in most of the results of the
PhyloType analysis and puts some others into perspective (e.g.
origin of the Cuba phylotype, see above).

A good practice is to try alternative annotation groupings
and measure their inﬂuence on the results. Thus, we tested two
other solutions, using the original country annotations and, on
the opposite, grouping countries into continents (Europe, Asia
and America) and subcontinents (Central Southern Africa, Other
Africa). As expected, when using broad (sub)continent annota-
tions (Supplementary Fig. S4), more sequences are covered
(85%) but the phylogenetic map is oversimpliﬁed and not in-
formative: eight original phylotypes (among 18) are recovered,
but nine are included in two large African phylotypes that depict
a coarse (but consistent) history of the epidemic in Africa, from
Central and Southern countries to the rest of the continent.
When using country annotations (Supplementary Fig. S5), the
number of covered sequences remains analogous and the similar-
ity with original analysis is high (89%), but we have more an-
cestral annotation ambiguities and are unable to establish some
of the ﬁliations and results found previously. For example, we do
not ﬁnd any phylotype related to DRC, and that the epicenter of
the epidemic seems to be situated in the DRC-Zambia region.
Altogether, these results indicate that the grouping step must be
conducted with care using additional (geographical, historical. . .)
knowledge and that an exploratory phase is recommended to
evaluate the relevance of different annotation groupings.

Lastly, we checked the robustness of the results regarding
selection parameter values. When lowering the Size threshold
to 5 (instead of 10), the analysis remains highly similar (97%),

but we ﬁnd eight additional small phylotypes (49 sequences in
total); on the opposite, when the Size threshold is equal to 20, the
results are still consistent but seven phylotypes are lost
(Supplementary Fig. S6). The Size/Diﬁ‘erent criterion is more
difﬁcult to tune. Basically, it represents the fraction of exceptions
that one accepts in phylotypes. When too low, some phylotypes
become meaningless and turn out to be non-signiﬁcant using the
shufﬂing procedure; when too high, some relevant phylotypes are
lost. Here, the results do not change much in the 0.5, 2.0 range
(Supplementary Fig. S7); 0.5 is a bit too low; values between 1.0
and 2.0 seem to be convenient and result in similar meaningful
phylotypes. With high threshold values, large phylotypes are lost
and broken into numerous small phylotypes.

4 CONCLUSION

To summarize results regarding the HIV-1 subtype C pandemic:
PhyloType recovers a number of already-identiﬁed transmission
chains (e. g. East Africa to Brazil), contradicts a few others (e. g.
origin of Indian epidemic) and suggests some new routes (e.g.
two different geographical origins of the Ethiopian epidemic).
Note that PhyloType reveals potential founder events, rather
than gene ﬂows as proposed by Slatkin and Maddison (1989)
and used in numerous studies (e.g. Wallace et al., 2007; Véras
et al., 2011). PhyloType results are obtained rapidly, in a matter
of minutes, through a user-friendly Web interface. Therefore, we
believe that PhyloType software has the potential to be extremely
useful for exploring and interpreting the large virus phylogenies,
which are available today and should become the norm in the
near future. The application’s speed should be a major asset in
surveillance tasks. However, for many viruses (e. g. Hepatitis B),
strain annotations (countries, dates. . .) are not yet as easily ob-
tained from the databases as they are with HIV-1, which should
imply the need for some signiﬁcant preliminary work before
launching PhyloType analyses. Moreover, representative samples
are still lacking for several viruses (e. g. Nonovirus), and sampling
efforts will have to be made to use PhyloType (and any other
similar tool) effectively.

Several directions deserve further exploration, most notably
the implementation of simple and computationally efﬁcient
probabilistic models, to be used instead of parsimony to infer
ancestral annotations, and the automatic combination of anno-
tation values, as performed by other methods (e.g. DIVA,
Ronquist, 1997; Lagrange, Ree and Smith, 2008). Moreover,
PhyloType could be used for radically different purposes, such
as exploring large protein families associated with differentiated
or specialized functions.

Abstract

Summary: LigDig is a web server designed to answer questions that previously required several
independent queries to diverse data sources. It also performs basic manipulations and analyses of
the structures of protein—ligand complexes. The LigDig webserver is modular in design and con—
sists of seven tools, which can be used separately, or via linking the output from one tool to the
next, in order to answer more complex questions. Currently, the tools allow a user to: (i) perform a
free—text compound search, (ii) search for suitable ligands, particularly inhibitors, of a protein and
query their interaction network, (iii) search for the likely function of a ligand, (iv) perform a batch
search for compound identifiers, (v) find structures of protein—ligand complexes, (vi) compare
three—dimensional structures of ligand binding sites and (vii) prepare coordinate files of protein—
Iigand complexes for further calculations.

Availability and implementation: LigDig makes use of freely available databases, including
ChEMBL, PubChem and SABIO—RK, and software programs, including cytoscape.js, PDBZPQR,
ProBiS and Fconv. LigDig can be used by non—experts in bio— and chemoinformatics. LigDig is
available at: http://mcm.h—its.org/Iigdig.

1 Introduction

There has been growing discussion of the ‘data deluge’ and the per—
ceived problems surrounding it, namely how to store, process and
visualize data, and how to combine multiple heterogeneous data
sources. For many working in the cross-disciplinary environment of
systems biology research, the challenge of combining these data
sources can be great, but the rewards of doing so can be even
greater. One of the hurdles facing researchers is the wide variety of
data sources available. Therefore, computational tools to assist in
the analysis of this data are essential. Tools to assist the modeling of
biochemical networks, such as SYCAMORE (Weidemann et 61].,
2008) or MetNetMaker (Forth et 61]., 2010), can simplify the con-
struction of metabolic models, although most require knowledge of

database identifiers for the biological entities of interest. Such tools
show the utility of integrating data from several sources and sim—
plifying the handling of multiple database identifiers. LigDig uses
the strategy of accessing multiple data sources and assisting the user
to interpret results that might not be possible by visiting a single
data source alone. Additionally, LigDig assists users in performing
basic manipulations of protein structures that can help researchers
to gain new insights into their system of interest.

LigDig was developed to assist a user with a set of example ques—
tions that might be encountered in a typical systems biology

workﬂow. Aware that new examples could be encountered during
software development, we used a modular design that allows com—
ponent reuse and easy inclusion of new features. An overview of the
workﬂow for the individual tools is given in Supplementary Figure
81. We developed most functionality using Python 2.7, since many
powerful toolkits [Biopython (Cock et al., 2009), Open Babel
(O’Boyle et al., 2011), LibSBML (Bornstein et al., 2008)] are avail—
able. The front—end was developed using Play Framework 2, a
Model—View—Controller framework allowing code to be written in
Java or Scala, with templating of HTML pages using Scala tem—
plates. Long running jobs can be provisioned through the Akka
framework (an actor—based concurrency model), which allows the
website to remain responsive to users. Twitter bootstrap (a front—
end web development framework) was used as a way to provide
user interface elements that can be viewed on mobile and desktop
browsers.

3 Examples

LigDig includes examples for each tool. These provide new users
with an overview of its functionality and usage. Here, we briefly dis—
cuss two examples. When user input to the tools is required, the text
is shown in italic.

3.1 How and where can information be found for the
compound fructose 1,6—bisphosphate?

With the example query ‘fructose 1,6—bisphosphate’, we find no com—
pounds in the ChEMBL database (Gaulton et al., 2012). We do not
believe that this is a deficiency of the ChEMBL database, rather a re—
ﬂection on the typical user of ChEMBL, who is not likely to provide

an InChI (Heller et al., 2013). Re—querying ChEMBL using ‘fructose
1,6—diphosphate’ yields the desired compound (CHEMBL97893);
however, this is a sodium salt of the compound, and the search does
not find (CHEMBL1089962) which is stored in ChEMBL as
‘Fructose—1,6—Diphosphate’. Similarly, searching using ChemHITS
(Golebiewski et al., 2009), a user could find a compound in SABIO-
RK (SABIO—Compound—ID: 20960) (Wittig et al., 2012), but not in
ChEBI (Degtyarenko et al., 2008) or KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto,
2000). Additionally, in the case of the compound found, no 2D chem—
ical structure is provided; thus, it is difficult to check that the correct
compound is found. LigDig provides a solution to the compound
searching problem, by searching the PubChem database using a rela—
tively broad search term. The user inputs text that describes the com-
pound of interest, e.g. fructose 1,6-bisphosphate or similar, LigDig
then returns several possible results. These results are grouped by the
atomic connectivity. The user is then shown a table with the possible
compounds, including their 2D structures, as well as a disambiguation
to other databases, which is provided through the UniChem tool. For
the search ‘fructose 1,6—bisphosphate’, LigDig identifies nine possible
compounds, of which six compounds are classed into two groups of
identical connectivity (size four and two, respectively). The group con—
taining four PubChem chemical identifiers (CIDs: 172313, 10267,
445557, 718) contains links to the two correct ChEMBL compounds:
CHEMBL97893 and CHEMBL1089962. LigDig enables the user
to easily search for their compound of interest. The user can
now choose to follow links in the results table directly to the original
data source, or to continue with further investigations in LigDig
by using checkboxes or buttons to submit to further analysis
tools. LigDig also provides the number of structures in the Protein
Database (PDB; Berman et al., 2002) which contain the compound of
interest.

3.2. Which proteins does my ligand inhibit and why?
Consider the case of the Mitogen—activated protein (MAP) kinase
signaling network. A user interested in the human protein ERK1
(Uniprot P27361), would use the ‘Find inhibitor’ tool. They would
enter the uniprot identifier if already known. Otherwise the user can
do a text search which is autocompleted using a typeahead java-
script. The user also needs to select two cutoff values to define which
compounds are considered to bind to the target and to off-targets;
here, we use 10 nM and 100 000 nM, respectively. The tool identifies
the compound CHEMBL475251, which using the UniChem web
service (Chambers et al., 2013) is disambiguated as the drug
Tamatinib (see Fig. 1). There are currently two protein structures
containing this compound available (PDB: 3piy and 3qu). The cyto—
scape.js (an open—source Javascript graph theory visualization li-
brary) and tabular views of the search show that Tamatinib can also
bind to the FLT3 tyrosine protein kinase receptor. Clicking on the
edge linking CHEMBL475251 and FLT3 shows the binding affinity
of this interaction. LigDig enables the user to investigate the struc-
tural basis for this binding using the ‘Superpose ligand binding sites’
tool by entering the PDB codes provided for ERK1 (Zzoq), FLT3
(1 rib) and a structure containing Tamatinib, here a Bruton’s tyrosine
kinase (3piy). Since there is currently no structure of Tamatinib
bound to FLT3 in the PDB, superposition of the latter two structures
gives a suggestion for the probable binding pose of Tamatinib in the
FLT3 binding site. If the user is interested in the structural basis for
Tamatinib binding to ERK1 and FLT3, the user can also superpose
ERK1 onto the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase structure at the same time.
Comparisons of the binding site to the reference structure, here
FLT3, can be displayed, along with root—mean—square deviation
values, in this case indicating that the binding sites of these protein
kinases are highly conserved.

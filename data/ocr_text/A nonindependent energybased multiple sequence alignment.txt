ABSTRACT

Motivation: Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are usually scored
under the assumption that the sequences being aligned have evolved
by common descent. Consequently, the differences between
sequences reflect the impact of insertions, deletions and mutations.
However, non-coding DNA binding sequences, such as transcription
factor binding sites (T FBSs), are frequently not related by common
descent, and so the existing alignment scoring methods are not well
suited for aligning such sequences.

Results: We present a novel multiple MSA methodology that scores
TFBS DNA sequences by including the interdependence of neigh-
boring bases. We introduced two variants supported by different
underlying null hypotheses, one statistically and the other thermo-
dynamically generated. We assessed the alignments through their per-
formance in TFBS prediction; both methods show considerable
improvements when compared with standard MSA algorithms.
Moreover, the thermodynamically generated null hypothesis outper-
forms the statistical one due to improved stability in the base stacking
free energy of the alignment. The thermodynamically generated null
hypothesis method can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/

1 INTRODUCTION

With the advent of third-generation sequencing technology, the
rate of genome sequencing is likely to continue to outstrip the
capacity for experimental analysis of gene function and regula-
tion. In addition, there is a similar growth in the availability of
transcription factor binding site (TFBS) sequences through
genome-wide ChIP-seq methods. Thus, there is a continued
need for more accurate computational methodologies.
Particularly important are multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
programs, such as ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1999, 2002;) and
Dialign (Morgenstern, 2007), that are widely used to identify
sections of protein or DNA sequences that share similar consen-
sus. These alignment programs generally work under the
assumption that the sequences being aligned are evolutionarily
related and that they have been derived from a common

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

ancestor, undergoing changes because of insertions, deletions
and substitutions. This assumption is then built into scoring
matrices, which are used to ﬁnd the best possible alignment,
such as BLOSUM (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992) and PAM
(Dayhoff, 1978), as well as for gap penalties.

However, non-coding DNA regions, especially TFBSs, are
rather more conserved and not necessarily evolutionarily related
(Mukherjee et al., 2013), and may have converged from non-
common ancestors. Thus, the assumptions used to align protein
sequences and DNA coding regions are inherently different from
those that hold for TFBS sequences. Although it is meaningful to
align DNA coding regions for homologous sequences using
mutation operators, alignment of binding site sequences for the
same transcription factor cannot rely on mutation operators.
Similarly, the evolutionary operator of point mutations can be
used to deﬁne an edit distance for coding sequences, but this has
little meaning for TFBS sequences because any sequence vari-
ation has to maintain a certain level of speciﬁcity for the binding
site to function.

It has been long known that interdependencies between neigh-
boring DNA bases have a signiﬁcant impact on DNA topology.
For example, the thermodynamic properties of base stacking
interactions have been extensively measured and are commonly
used in computational methods for DNA secondary structure
prediction (Mathews et al., 1999). This was illustrated in work
discussing the effect of DNA ﬁexure on the binding site afﬁnity
(Calladine and Drew, 1986). Compensating mutations between
neighboring DNA bases have been long known (Stormo et al.,
1986). Consideration of the codependencies between DNA bases
in a TFBS have been proved to be efﬁcient in modeling binding
site speciﬁcity (Homsi et al., 2009; Stormo and Zhao, 2010), also
suggesting the possibility of coevolution between the DNA bases
(Mukherjee et al., 2013). We have shown in previous work
(Salama and Stekel, 2010) using mutual information analysis
that there are dependencies between neighboring and distant pos-
itions of the TFBSs; many of the distant interactions reﬂect the
palindromic nature of TFBSs.

The issues of effective MSAs for DNA binding sites become
particularly important for supervised TFBS prediction.
Supervised TFBS prediction algorithms take as input a set of
known TFBS sequences, known as a “training set’, and use
these to build an expected model of the TFBS that can be used
to identify further sequences (Hertz and Stormo, 1999; Lee and
Huang, 2012; Pauling et al., 2012; Salama and Stekel, 2010;
Stormo et al., 1986). These can be contrasted with de novo bind-
ing site prediction methods that analyze upstream regions

of genes to ﬁnd overrepresented motifs (Bailey et al., 2006;
Herz and Stormo 1999) and which are not the subject of this
article. We previously demonstrated that the use of a non-
optimal alignment for training can seriously disrupt TFBS pre-
diction efﬁcacy, even as compared with using a block alignment
(Salama and Stekel, 2010). Moreover, effective supervised TFBS
prediction relies on a suitably large training set of known binding
sites, and so predictions can only be made for ‘global’ regulators.
Most transcription factors only regulate a small number of genes,
and supervised prediction of those ‘non-global’ regulators has
been particularly hard. One solution would be to use binding
sites from paralogous or orthologous transcription factors, as
interdependence patterns are similar across related transcription
factors (Mukherjee et al., 2013). To do so, it becomes necessary
to produce MSAs for those binding sites that capture TFBS
speciﬁcity.

In this article, we aim to include the interdependencies in the
MSA to provide a better representation for the DNA binding site
speciﬁcity. We introduce a dinucleotide representation method of
the TFBS sequence that captures the interdependencies. We then
introduce two alignment cost metrics methodologies: the ﬁrst is
using a statistical approach similar to the one used to calculate
BLOSUM (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992); the second makes
use of base stacking thermodynamics. We speciﬁcally used a
Boltzmann distribution centered on the change in base stacking
free energy as the null hypothesis for dinucleotide substitutions.

To validate our work, we compare both methods against
each other, against other commonly used alignment methods
(ClustalW, Dialign) and against our previously published
method using block alignments. There is a good range of bench-
mark alignments to test protein MSA methods including
BAliBASE (Thompson et al., 2005), OXBench (Raghava et al.,
2003), SABmark (Walle et al., 2004) and SMART (Ponting et al.,
1999). For DNA coding regions, Carroll et a]. (2007) have
developed a DNA reference benchmark based on the tertiary
structure of encoded protein. However, no such benchmark
alignments are available for non-coding DNA sequences.
A score is often used to detect the accuracy of the MSA using
the homology in the resulting alignment (Thompson et al., 1999).
The approach we take is to test the alignments for their capacity
to act as a training set for a supervised ﬁrst-order Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) (Salama and Stekel, 2010) to predict
known TFBSS.

2 METHODS

2.1 Dinucleotide substitution matrix

The substitution matrix considered in this case is a 16 X 16 matrix
representing the dinucleotide substitution rates for the TFBS. The
dinucleotides are symbolized using the alphabet A to P to represent al-
phabetically each possible pair of neighboring nucleotides AA through to
TT in alphabetical order. A DNA sequence is translated into our new
alphabet in an overlapping manner. For instance, the sequence ACA
would be represented in our new alphabet by the sequence BE: B for
AC and E for CA. Every sequence in the training set is converted into this
new alphabet for alignment with the other sequences.

The hypothesis behind this conversion is that the sequences are now
forced into an interdependent representation of the binding site rather
than an independent one. This representation captures the heart of the

single nucleotide mutation effect on neighboring base interactions.
For instance, a single point mutation (transition) of the cytosine to
thymine in this sequence ACA => ATA would result in a change of
two neighboring base interactions AC => AT and CA => TA, and so
would be represented as two position mutations in dinucleotide represen-
tation BE => DM. When considering stacking interactions, this can be
used to represent the change in free energy of both interactions.

A substitution matrix is highly speciﬁc for each TFBS set. The substi-
tution matrix is then computed for each TFBS set. A problem is that to
construct such a substitution matrix a valid alignment is required. This is
inherently recursive, as obtaining a correct substitution matrix requires a
valid MSA, and the MSA requires an optimized substitution matrix. This
recursive nature of the problem has led us to devise a simple recursive
algorithm similar to the expectation maximization algorithm devised by
(Cao et al., 2009).

Initially, we deﬁne a random substitution matrix with costs
drawn from independent uniform random variables between 0 and 100
(see Supplementary Methods). This is then used to generate the ﬁrst
alignment. In the maximization step, the resulting alignment is used to
calculate the substitution matrix using the log-odds cost matrix
[Equation (1)]

 

LOdLjZ 111 

1,]

(1)

Where Oijj is the observed probability of aligning dinucleotide i with
dinucleotide j and Eijj is the expected probability (null hypothesis) of
aligning dinucleotide i with dinucleotide j. In the expectation step, the
resulting substitution matrix is then used again to compute a new
sequence alignment with optimum alignment cost. In all our implemen-
tations of this algorithm, it has converged; this is likely to be because of
the analogy with EM algorithms (Wu, 1983). The ﬁnal substitution
matrix is selected through another iterative process optimizing gap penal-
ties, as explained later. The ﬁnal dinucleotide substitution matrix is then
used to align the transcription factor known binding sites.

The observed probability Oijj is constructed using the following
equations

i=1 j=l

Where QiJ is given by Equation (3)

Qi,j= n

x21

(3)

Where N" is the number of dinucleotides of type i at position x. Thus, QU-
represents the number of times each dinucleotide as been aligned to each
other dinucleotide across the whole alignment.

The log odds ratio optimization process is controlled by the null
hypothesis used in the denominator of the equation. The null hypothesis
in the log odd scoring controls the substitution cost as in Equation (1).
Hence, in the algorithm devised, a dinucleotide alignment cost is
rewarded if the observed cost is better than the expected cost and
penalized if it is worse.

Accordingly, we have assessed two different null hypothesis distribu-
tions, statistical and thermodynamical, with associated cost matrices.
These have been denoted as SDNMSA for the statistically generated
null hypothesis and EDNA for the thermodynamically generated null
hypothesis.

2.2 Statistically generated null hypothesis

The ﬁrst null hypothesis is a purely statistical hypothesis representing the
expected independent joint distribution of the dinucleotides, which is

Where Sid- is the statistical cost of substituting dinucleotide i with di-
nucleotide j and K is a scaling constant.

2.3 Thermodynamically generated null hypothesis
(EDNA)

The second null hypothesis is thermodynamical, and it assumes that the
dinucleotide substitutions associated with a TFBS set are distributed
using Boltzmann distributions, and that the joint distribution between
two dinucleotides (e.g. representing a single base substitution) is energet-
ically independent. The parameters for the Boltzmann distributions
are derived from the dinucleotide stacking free energies (Allawi and
SantaLucia, 1997, 1998a, b, c, d; SantaLucia and Turner, 1997). First,
a Boltzmann distribution is constructed for the existing dinucleotides in
the training set:

16
Bi : die—AGi/KBT die—AGi/KBT 
/;< >

Where AG,- is the stacking free energy of the dinulceotide i, T is tempera-
ture (298 K) and KB is the Boltzmann Constant equal to 0.00198721kcal/
mol/K. Next, the expected values for the null hypothesis distribution are
constructed as a joint distribution assuming independence:

E.._ 3131» 171:1
“— 2BiBj»  1'75].

The thermodynamical cost of substituting dinucleotide i with dinucleotide
j can be constructed from Equations 2 and 8:

(8)

TL,- = K(1 — LodLj) (9)

Where K is a scaling constant (set to 100). Reversing the sign of the odd
score function is a pure technicality of the alignment program, which
requires low-cost values for expected substitutions and high cost for un-
expected ones. Hence, reversing the sign would penalize the negative odd
score and reward the positive ones.

2.4 Gap penalties

An afﬁne gap penalty function is used with different sets of penalties for
gaps within the sequence (internal) and for preﬁx and sufﬁx gaps
(Altschul and Erickson, 1986). Thus, the total gap penalty is given by

n 2
G = 2 (y + 130,-) + (y’ + H01) (10)
i=1 :1

J

Where y is the internal gap open penalty, ,8 is the internal gap extension
penalty, D, is the length of internal gap i, y’ is the terminal (external) gap
open penalty, ,8’ is the terminal gap extension penalty and Dj’ the length
of the terminal gap extension j.

The gap penalty has to be tightly optimized with the cost matrix
optimization process. Therefore, the gap penalty constants are optimized

iteratively as fractions of the average of the substitution matrix calculated
as shown in Equation 11

n 2
G = Z (W + 13660.) + Z (me + 61160,) (11)
i=1 1:1
Where uc is the average of the cost matrix previously optimized.
The acceptance function 8 for a chosen penalty is calculated for every
computed G as follows
S2
= — 12
(LA — LB) ( )
Where S2 is the number of columns in the alignment for which the highest
frequency of symbols is greater than ozas given by Equation (13), L A is the
length of the alignment and LB is the initial length of the binding site
block alignment (ungapped)

Pi
S2 = c0unt(ﬁ Z a) (13)

Where Pi is the number of the most frequent symbols in column i, and the
homology percentage 0: is the maximal symbol frequency observed in the

block alignment given by
Pb
= — 14
oz max(N) ( )

The proposed alignment mainly operates by shifting the binding sites
relative to each other, preferring terminal gaps over internal gaps, due to
the steric constraints of protein—DNA interactions. Accordingly, the in-
ternal gap open/extension penalties (y, ,8) are ﬁxed at the high value of 5.
The terminal open/extension gaps, on the other hand, are optimized by
ﬁxing y’ at a 0.1 and increasing the extension terminal gap penalty (,8’)
iteratively until no gaps can be added to the sequence. In other words, the
opening of a terminal gap is always allowed, although the extension is
optimized. The best terminal extension gap penalty is deﬁned as the one
that corresponds to higher S2 (Fig. 1).

2.5 Validation

As a validation, we tested the ability of a supervised ﬁrst-order HMM
(Salama and Stekel, 2010), trained using alignments from each of these
methods, to predict known TFBS. Accordingly, we considered 18 global
transcription factors in Escherichia coli K12 (Supplementary Table S1).
For each factor, we used the RegulonDB 7.0 (Gama-Castro et al., 2011)
known binding sites, as these can be considered as a highly reliable ‘gold
standard’. We aligned the binding sites for each transcription factor using
the four different alignment methods compared in this article. We used
the alignments to build ﬁrst-order HMM for each factor (see
Supplementary Methods). We used a leave-one—out cross-validation to
determine the likelihood of each binding site within the TFBS set. Finally,
we constructed a negative binding set using a moving window of the same
length of the binding site in the intergenic regions in E.coli genome, as

described previously (Salama and Stekel, 2010). The collective predictive
power of each alignment is then assessed using area under receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Zweig and Campbell, 1993).

3 IMPLEMENTATION

EDNA is implemented as an extension of the open source MSA
program, Opal (\Nheeler and Kececioglu, 2007). Our alignment
methodology makes profound changes in the alphabet, substitu-
tion matrix computation and gap penalties optimization. We
have optimized the speciﬁc alignment parameters in Opal.
EDNA is currently available at source forge, which is currently
open for use by the public (http://sourceforge.net/projects/msa—
edna/). Example data, namely, the sequences from the binding
sites used in this manuscript, are included with the code.

4 RESULTS
4.1 EDNA conserves the thermodynamic stability of MSA

This method is intended to primarily optimize the thermo-
dynamic stability of the alignment. In other words, ﬁnd the
correct alignment where a dinucleotide substitution is possible
thermodynamically without disrupting the free energy of neigh-
boring interactions. Hence, we have measured the thermo-
dynamic stability of each of the alignments for each of the
TFBSs considered in the study (Fig. 2). It can be seen that the
thermodynamic stability is greatly improved even for the statis-
tical dinucleotide alignment SDNMSA, with further improve-
ment for the thermodynamically based alignment EDNA.

As an illustrative example, greater detail is shown for the AraC
TFBS alignments (Fig. 3). In general, we noticed that ClustalW
shows better free energy conservation than Dialign. SDNMSA
and EDNA, on the other hand, showed an even better

Fig. 2. The 3D plots of the standard deviations in the AG for each
column in the alignments for every binding site using the four gapped
alignment methods (columns with >90% gaps have been excluded). The
standard deviation vector associated with all of the binding sites in each
alignment has been smoothed using non-parametric Loess regression and
then recalculated over 50 points to deal with variable alignment lengths.
EDNA produces the least variability of the four alignment methods,
indicating that these alignments are the most thermodynamically stable

conservation than ClustalW; however, EDNA showed the
most conserved column count. Dialign produced a highly un-
stable alignment with only a small stable core. Similarly,
ClustalW not only produced an alignment with high stability
in the core columns but also a terminal stability is noticed.
SDNMSA showed, on the other hand, a much better conserva-
tion of the free energy across the alignment, with conservation on
both sides and the core. Finally, EDNA showed a similar but
better conservation to SDNMSA with more columns conserved.

4.2 Dinulecotide—based alignments outperform
independent column alignments for TFBS prediction

Dinucleotide representation of the binding site outperformed in-
dependent position alignments methods, notably Dialign and
ClustalW, as shown in Table 1 and summarized in Figure 4.

The area under ROC curves (AUCs) for EDNA range between
81 and 99% (Table 1); many of the AUCs for Dialign are consid-
erably worse, with the lowest, MetJ, at 28%, and the AUCs for
ClustalW are also considerably worse, with MetJ at 36%. Overall,
EDNA outperforms Dialign (P=0.001 paired Wilcoxon test),
with larger AUCs for 14 of the 18 TFs and equal AUCs for the
other 4 TFs. Notably, these TFs, CRP, GlpR, FNR and LexA all
have highly conserved binding sequences (Supplementary Table
S1), and both methods perform equally well (98 or 99% AUC).
EDNA outperforms ClustalW (P = 0.0008 paired Wilcoxon test),
with greater AUCs for 15 of the 18 TF3. The AUCs for FNR and
LexA are equal; ClustalW outperforms EDNA for TyrR, but the
AUCs for the two methods are 97 and 98%, respectively, so there
is minimal material difference between the two.

EDNA also outperforms our previously published method
using a block alignment, ungapped likelihood under a positional
background (ULPB) (Salama and Stekel, 2010) (P: 0.0005).
The range of AUCs for ULPB is considerably better than
those using Dialign and ClustalW, with the lowest being 67%
for MetJ. EDNA outperforms ULPB for 16 of the 18 TFs. The

5 DISCUSSION

We have developed a new methodology for MSAs of non-coding
DNA sequences that uses an alignment of dinucleotides. Two
variants have been described, using two different null hypotheses,
one statistically driven and the other thermodynamically driven.
These have been compared with other alignment programs,
exempliﬁed by ClustalW and Dialign, which are designed with
a null hypothesis derived from the evolution of peptide
sequences. They have been evaluated by assessing TFBS predic-
tion for 18 global regulators from Ecoli K12. The ROC curves
for the ﬁrst-order supervised HMM prediction using the di-
nucleotide alignment demonstrated better alignment than the
current alignment tools, irrespective of the null hypothesis
used. Between the two variants, the use of thermodynamic-driven
null hypothesis proved to be statistically better.

The Boltzmann distribution derived provides a base stacking
interaction dinucleotide distribution for each TFBS set studied.
An independent thermodynamic joint distribution of dinucleo-
tides represents the random distribution of dinucleotide thermo-
dynamic alignment. The log odd scoring system in this case
would provide a negative or 0 score if the observed dinucleotides
alignment joint probability is less than or equal to the random
joint probability, and positive otherwise. Accordingly, scoring
the observed joint distribution versus this null hypothesis distri-
bution would indicate the odds of randomly aligning any
dinucleotide pair under thermodynamic hypothesis. The higher
these odds are, the less favored they are in the alignment. This
would indicate that the resulting alignment from EDNA would
favor to align dinucleotides that are more thermodynamically
dependent than independent.

5.1 Thermodynamic null hypothesis is not governed by
rarity of the dinucleotide

Another major advantage of using a thermodynamically driven
null hypothesis is that it is not governed by the rarity of the
substitutions in the binding site training set (Eddy, 2004).
Instead, it provides a consistent behavior for all the binding
sites, expecting that the rarity of an alignment event be governed
by unfavorable stacking free energy. Thus, EDNA avoids prob-
lems resulting from under-sampling in a set of TFBS, which may
be particularly valuable when building alignments for non-global
regulators.

5.2 Base stacking interaction-driven convergence

In general, the method provides a good performance for most
binding sites relative to alternative methods. Nevertheless, false
positives are still observed in some binding sites, including Lrp,
SoxS, IHF and MetJ. For well-conserved binding sites, such as
LexA, ArgR, FNR, Fur, GlpR and PhoP, all methods show
good performance; this can be attributed to the small solution
space providing a set of constraint alignment solutions. On
the other hand, the predictions for the less-conserved binding
sites, such as AraC, ArcA, CpxR, FlhDC, TyrR and MetJ,
have been particularly enhanced by our new method
(Supplementary Fig.S2). This may reﬂect the importance of
thermodynamic interactions between neighboring DNA bases,
which have been described well by this method.

5.3 Higher-order matrices

The fact that we have used a ﬁrst-order substitution matrix to
capture the binding site might be on its own providing an
advantage for the alignment, as we account for the substitutions
and aligning blocks of two bases rather one. It could be argued
that higher-order matrices might provide further improvements.
However, a major problem with such matrices is the complexity
involved; a trinucleotide matrix would require a 64 x 64 substi-
tution matrix with >4000 parameters, which would be challen-
ging to compute and optimize, and most MSAs are likely to be
under-sampled in this context. Moreover, the base stacking free
energies used have only been experimentally determined for
ﬁrst-order interactions,and not for higher-order interactions
(Allawi and SantaLucia, 1997, 1998a, b, c, d).

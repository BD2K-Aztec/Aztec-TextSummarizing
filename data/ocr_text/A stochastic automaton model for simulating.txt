ABSTRACT

Motivation: Cellular interactions of kinesin-1, an adenosine triphos-
phate (ATP)-driven motor protein capable of undergoing multiple steps
on a microtubule (MT), affect its mechanical processivity, the number
of steps taken per encounter with MT. Even though the processivity of
kinesin has been widely studied, a detailed study of the factors that
affect the stepping of the motor along MT is still lacking.

Results: We model the cellular interactions of kinesin as a probabilistic
timed automaton and use the model to simulate the mechanical
processivity of the motor. Theoretical analysis suggests: (i) backward
stepping tends to be powered by ATP hydrolysis, rather than ATP
synthesis, (ii) backward stepping powered by ATP synthesis is more
likely to happen with limiting ATP concentration ([ATP]) at high
loads and (iii) with increasing load the frequency of backward
stepping powered by ATP hydrolysis at high [ATP] is greater than
that powered by ATP synthesis at limiting [ATP]. Together, the
higher frequency of backward stepping powered by ATP hydrolysis
than by ATP synthesis is found to be a reason for the more dramatic
falling of kinesin processivity with rising load at high [ATP] compared
with that at low [ATP]. Simulation results further show that the proces-
sivity of kinesin can be determined by the number of ATP hydrolysis
and synthesis kinetic cycles taken by the motor before becoming
inactive. It is also found that the duration of a backward stepping
cycle at high loads is more likely to be less than that of a fonNard
stepping cycle.

1 INTRODUCTION

Kinesin—l is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-driven motor pro-
tein that walks in an asymmetric hand-over-hand fashion (Yildiz
et al., 2004, 2008) on a microtubule (MT) in discrete 8.2 nm steps
(Clancy et al., 2011). Mechanical processivity of kinesin has
revealed that the motor takes multiple steps in the forward dir-
ection (i.e. to the plus end of MT) and occasionally in the back-
ward direction (i.e. to the minus end of MT) (Carter and Cross
2005; Nishiyama et al., 2002; Yildiz et al., 2008) before detaching
from MT in the presence of ATP (Howard at al., 1989; Yajima
et al., 2002), or in the absence of ATP if external load is applied
to the motor (Yildiz et al., 2008). Processivity of kinesin ensures
that cellular cargos are transported reliably over long distances.

nanostructures, which can be exploited in nanorobotics by in-
venting artificial nanomotors and thus, synthetic nanodevices
powered by the motor (Fischer et al., 2009; Goodman et al.,
2012; Hess 2006). This stepping is also manipulated in the con-
trolled propagation architecture of nanonetworks whose infor-
mation molecules are carried by kinesin motors between
transmitter and receiver nanomachines (Nakano et al., 2012;
Pierobon and Akyildiz, 2010). Synthetic nanodevices and nano-
networks are anticipated to contribute in medical diagnostics as
well as engineering applications (Fischer et al., 2009; Goodman
et al., 2012; Nakano et al., 2012). Despite this progress, artiﬁcial
nanomotors still lack the functionality and efﬁciency of their
biological counterparts Wang and Manesh, 2010).

Processivity of kinesin motor and thus, its mean run length
(i.e. the distance that the motor travels before detaching from
MT) is correlated to the cellular interactions of the motor
(Toprak et al., 2009). Yet, little is known about how this
motor can remain attached to MT through the hundreds of
stepping cycles (Toprak et al., 2009). A better understanding of
the cellular interactions of kinesin would provide new insights
into the mechanical processivity of the motor. Recently, we de-
veloped a mathematical model that simulates the behaviour of
kinesin stepping (Khataee and Liew, 2014). We showed that the
model could be used to analyse and predict forward and back-
ward stepping of kinesin motor at different ATP concentrations
([ATP]) and loads. On the basis of our ﬁndings in Khataee and
Liew (2014), here we aim to model the stochastic behaviour of a
single kinesin molecule by constructing a probabilistic timed au-
tomaton based on a discrete stochastic model of the motor at
various [ATP] and loads. The probabilistic timed automata
(PTA) are mathematical models augmented with time and dis-
crete probability distributions for modelling the temporal and
stochastic properties of stochastic discrete-event systems
(Beauquier, 2003; Kwiatkowska et al., 2002, 2004). Our pro-
posed automaton model shows that the mean run length of kine-
sin, at different [ATP] and loads, can be determined by the
number of ATP hydrolysis and synthesis kinetic cycles taken
by the motor before detaching from MT.

where M-K denotes MT-kinesin complex and ADP-P, complex

(ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The d,- (i = l, 2, 3, 4)
represents the substep length for the center of force of kinesin
along MT, where the total step size is d = (d1 + d2 + d3 + d4).
In this four-state stochastic model, kinetic state i may transit to
states 1' + 1 and i— 1 with forward and backward transition rates u,-
and w,- (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), respectively, inﬂuenced by the temperature

where u? and w? are the transition rates at zero load, 6: and 6,.—
are the characteristic distances for the load, d is the step size
(= 8.2 nm) and ICE is the Boltzmann constant (Fisher and
Kolomeisky, 2001; Kolomeisky and Fisher, 2007). The load
distribution factors demonstrate how the external load affects
the individual kinetic rates where it is assumed that
2:1 (61.+ +617) = 1. These factors are related to substep lengths
via d,- = (61.+ + 617+ 1)d (Kolomeisky and Fisher, 2007). The param-
eter values of Equations (1) and (2) summarized in Table 1 as well
as the parameter values of [ATP]-dependent rates presented in
Equations (3) and (4) have been estimated by Fisher and
Kolomeisky (2001) through regression on the experimental data
of Block and colleagues in (Schnitzer et al., 2000; Visscher et al.,
1999) at room temperature:

where k1 = 1.8 uM’lsil, k’l = 0.225 uMils’l, c1 = 16 uM and no
side load has been considered. The discrete stochastic model above
asserts that forward stepping of kinesin motor hydrolyses ATP,
whereas backward stepping could resynthesize ATP (Fisher and
Kim, 2005; Fisher and Kolomeisky, 2001; Kolomeisky and Fisher,
2007). In addition in accordance with several sets of experimental

and theoretical ﬁndings (Carter and Cross, 2005; Clancy et al.,
2011; Hackney, 2005; Liepelt and Lipowsky, 2007; Nishiyama
et al., 2002; Taniguchi et al., 2005; Yildiz et al., 2008), we recently
modelled the probabilities of ATP-driven forward and backward
stepping of kinesin using the four-state discrete stochastic model
and showed that (Khataee and Liew, 2014): (i) the stall force seems
to be ahnost constant and [ATP]-independent and (ii) backward
stepping is related to both ATP hydrolysis and synthesis with rate
limiting factor being ATP synthesis. Although forward and back-
ward steppings of kinesin have been observed by Yildiz et al.
(2008) in the direction of the applied load in the absence of
ATP due to the strain on the motor head generated by the load,
in this work, we focus on the ATP-driven stepping of kinesin
motor based on the four-state discrete stochastic model. [ATP] is
considered as a factor that affects the motor velocity at various
loads (Schnitzer et al., 2000; Visscher et al., 1999) and thus, it is
proposed as a mean for temporal control of synthetic nanodevices
powered by kinesin motor (Dinu et al., 2007; Wang and Manesh,
2010).

In modelling kinesin processivity, Block and colleagues in
Schnitzer et al. (2000) used an energy landscape formalism,
where the kinetic rates followed a Boltzmann-type relationship,
and showed that the mean run length of kinesin, L, exhibits
Michaelis—Menten kinetic behaviour, L = L0[ATP]/
([ATP] + LM), where L0 is the mean run length at zero load
and LM is Michaelis constant. Using a global analysis of kinesin
processivity data carried out from Michaelis—Menten functions
at different [ATP] and loads and then, fitted to kinetic rates, L
was calculated as follows:

_ 8.2 x [ATP] x Aexp(— 

 

_ [ATP] +B(1 + AeXp(_  (5)

where A = 107:l:9 gives the maximum average number of
catalytic cycles before detachment, 6 = 1.3 :l: 0.1 nm is the char-
acteristic distance associated with load dependence and
B = 0.029:l:0.009 uM is a parameter of Michaelis constant. It
was observed that run lengths of kinesin motor are exponentially
distributed under fixed load or [ATP] (Schnitzer et al., 2000;
Yajima et al., 2002). The energy landscape model proposed in
Schnitzer et al. (2000) predicts that kinesin motility should
remain tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis even under load.
Meanwhile, the four-state discrete stochastic model, derived
from this energy model, describes the dynamics of kinesin step-
ping by both the ATP hydrolysis and synthesis kinetic cycles at
various [ATP] and loads (Fisher and Kolomeisky, 2001;
Kolomeisky and Fisher, 2007). Even though Carter and Cross
(2005) stated that backward stepping is unlikely to result in ATP
synthesis, Fisher and Kim (2005) remarked that the experimental
observations in Carter and Cross (2005) rest on a misconception
of the signiﬁcance of dwell times before forward and backward
stepping, and asserted that backward stepping could actually
result in ATP synthesis.

The four-state discrete stochastic model and our modelling of
mechanical kinetics of kinesin stepping in Khataee and Liew
(2014) allow us to simulate the processivity of kinesin motor
by considering both the ATP hydrolysis and synthesis kinetic
cycles at various [ATP] and loads. The four-state discrete

stochastic model can be used to count the net number of steps
taken by the motor before becoming inactive. Therefore, we
simulate the processivity of kinesin by computing the number
of ATP hydrolysis and synthesis kinetic cycles and thus, the
mean number of steps taken by the motor before detachment
from MT at different settings of [ATP] and load. It has been
shown that there is a small probability of detachment per
mechanical stepping cycle (Block et al., 1990; Schliwa, 2003).
As the detachment of kinesin from MT in each stepping cycle
is an independent event and does not depend on any previ-
ous stepping cycles, the distribution of the number of steppings
before detaching of kinesin from MT is a geometric
distribution. Thus, the mean number of forward steps derived
from ATP hydrolysis before the motor becomes inactivated is
given by:

l

(n >=
h Poff

 

(6)

where Poff is the detachment probability of kinesin from MT per
mechanical stepping cycle. Since kinesin dissociates from MT
after each single run, the detachment probability of the motor
from MT per mechanical stepping cycle in relation with the mean
run length is exponentially distributed as follows (Yajima et al.,

2002):
Poff= (1 — €Xp(—8fz)) (7)

where L is the mean run length given by Equation (5). To obtain
the mean number of steps taken by kinesin per encounter with
MT, the mean number of backward steps derived from ATP
synthesis should be deducted from <nh>. We define the mean
number of backward steps derived from ATP synthesis before
detaching of kinesin from MT as follows:

(ms) = 0%) X Ps (8)

where PS is the proportion of ATP synthesis pathway to ATP
hydrolysis pathway defined as follows:

F
W3

PS:—
F F
ziz-l-w3

(9)
where u; and w? are computed by Equations (1) and (2). Thus,
the mean number of steps taken by kinesin per encounter with
MT is defined as follows:

(n) = W) — (HS) (10)

Theoretical predictions for the processivity of kinesin motor at
different [ATP] and loads are obtained from Equation (10)
(Fig. 1). Figure 1A and B shows that the processivity of kinesin
motor dramatically declines with increasing load or decreasing
[ATP], in agreement with previous findings in Liepelt and
Lipowsky (2007) and Schnitzer et al. (2000). Experimental data
in Schnitzer et al. (2000) showed that at low loads and high
[ATP], the mean run length L was ~600 nm. L fell to ~300 nm
when the [ATP] was reduced to 5 ,uM, and to ~80 nm when load
was increased to 5pN. We show that the computed <RL> is
comparable with the experimentally obtained L, where <RL>
is almost equal to: ~601nm at [ATP] = lmM and F = 1.1pN,
~300nm at [ATP] = 5uM and F: 2.4pN and ~80 nm when

load increases to 5pN at [ATP] ~1 uM. Results in Fig. 1A and
B also agree with the findings of Liepelt and Lipowsky (2007) in
which a 7-state kinetic scheme, based on several motor cycles,
was used to calculate the <RL>.

At high [ATP], Figure 1C and D indicates that the mean
backward displacement (<BD>) powered by ATP synthesis
decreases with rising load. This implies that the falling of
<RL> with rising load at high [ATP] observed in Figure 1B
could only be due to the rising frequency of backward step-
ping powered by ATP hydrolysis. This is in agreement with
the experimental observations in Carter and Cross (2005) and
Nishiyama et al. (2002) and theoretical results in Khataee and
Liew (2014) and Liepelt and Lipowsky (2007) that backward
steppings are mainly generated by ATP hydrolysis at high
[ATP]. At limiting [ATP], backward stepping powered by
ATP hydrolysis has low frequency due to low [ATP]. At
low [ATP], Figure 1D shows that <BD> has rising trend,
indicating that ATP is increasingly likely to be synthesized
during backward movement, as reported in Fisher and Kim
(2005), Fisher and Kolomeisky (2001) and Kolomeisky and
Fisher (2007). However, the slower falling rate of <RL> at
limiting [ATP] than at high [ATP] in Figure 1B indicates that
the rate of backward stepping powered by ATP synthesis at
limiting [ATP] is lower than the rate of backward stepping
powered by ATP hydrolysis at high [ATP]. This supports
the observations that backward steppings are more likely to
be generated by ATP hydrolysis than by ATP synthesis when
[ATP] is not limiting, and that the frequency of backward
stepping rises with [ATP] (Carter and Cross, 2005).
Moreover, Figure 1C shows that the rise of <BD> slows
down with increasing [ATP], implying that backward stepping
powered by ATP synthesis is more likely to happen with limit-
ing [ATP]. Together, these theoretical analyses indicate that

Fig. 2. The automaton model, Mkinesin. (A) General representation of
Mkmesin. Mkinesin starts with incoming unlabeled arrow to state Soff with
clock x initialized to 0. As the invariant condition of Soff is true, the
control stays in state Soff until perceiving input E. By sensing input E,
Soff changes to state H/S and clock x is reset to 0. In state H/S, one of
ATP hydrolysis or synthesis pathway is randomly chosen to run or
Mkinesin becomes inactivated with probability Poff. (B) Detailed represen-
tation of Mkinesin. By sensing input E, ATP hydrolysis or synthesis path-
way is chosen to run with probability P), or PS, respectively. Then, the
value of clock x increases uniformly with time. When x is equal to If the
invariant condition x 5 If requires that the action with event T or D must
be taken. Alternatively, if x exceeds If then the action with event label E
may be taken with probability 1. These behaviours correspond to the
attachment of kinesin to MT in the absence of regulatory factors and
the start of stepping initiated with kinetic state changing 1—1>2 or 1—>14.
However, if [ATP] is limiting then the motor detaches from MT due to
long pausing. For clarity of the graph, transitions of a single action are
connected with a dotted line. Also, actions 61,3 (1' = l, 2, 3, 4) are not
shown

the processivity of kinesin can be determined by the number of
ATP hydrolysis and synthesis kinetic cycles taken by the
motor before becoming inactive.

2.2 Automaton model

To simulate how the cellular interactions of kinesin affect its
processivity, we abstract an important set of its cellular inter-
actions as a parametric probabilistic timed automaton (Alur
and Dill, 1994; Alur et al., 1993; Beauquier, 2003;
Kwiatkowska et al., 2002, 2004; Sproston and Troina, 2010),
and construct the automaton model shown in Figure 2 with
Mkinesin = (S, Sinitial, Sfinal, I, C, Iran, iI’ZV, AS,  The model
simulates the ATP hydrolysis and synthesis kinetic pathways that
resulted in the processivity of kinesin at various [ATP] and loads.
The set S = {503, H /S} in Figure 2A denotes the states of Mkinesin
where Soff corresponds to the kinetic state in which kinesin is
detached from MT and state H/S stand for an ATP hydrolysis

(H) or synthesis (S) kinetic cycle. State H/S is composed of H
and S cycles connected by a state so defined to determine which
cycle is randomly chosen to be executed. Each H or S cycle is
composed of states sl—s4, which stand for the kinetic states ‘1’—‘4’
of the four-state discrete stochastic model, respectively (Fig. 2B).
Sinitial = {Soff} C S and Sﬁnal = {Soff} C S are the initial and final
states of Mkinesin, respectively, because, in vivo, kinesin mainly
exists as soluble motor where its activity is switched off and the
motor is autoinhibited from binding to and moving on MTs
(Kaan et al., 2011; Verhey and Rapoport, 2001). The input set
I = {E, T, D, P, E’, T, D’, P’} denotes the events E, T, D and P,
which stand for the presence of enabling condition of kinesin
(e.g. low external loads, the presence of MT and the absence
of regulatory factors), ATP binding, ADP binding and P, bind-
ing, respectively. The complement of an event (i.e. E’, T, D’
or P’) represents the opposite molecular role of that event. To
express the temporal properties of kinesin mechanism, we define
the clock set C = {x}, which contains a non-negative real-valued
variable (i.e. e R+) that increases at the same rate as real time.
Clock x indicates the time elapsed in Mkinesin states, correspond-
ing to the mean waiting time in kinetic states of kinesin. The set
tran of transitions which are tuples of the form es = (s, p, a, C, 3’)
representing a transition from state s to state 5’ with probability
p, event a e I U {a} and set C g C of clocks which are reset to 0
by transition es, where 8 denotes null event. The function inv: S
—> g“ is defined to assign to each state of Mkinesin an invariant
condition from the set 5“ of clock constraints. A state stays in-
variant, i.e., no change, when the constraint is true. The invariant
condition of state Soff is assigned as true because, in vivo, kinesin
mainly stays in the detached state without time constraint. As
state so is defined to determine the kinetic pathway, its invariant
condition is assigned as true to show no time constraint. For
states sl—s4, we assign invariant conditions x g If where clock x
e C and If denotes the mean wait time of kinesin in kinetic states
1' (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). It was shown that the waiting time in each
kinetic state is inversely proportional to the transition rate
from that state (Leibler and Huse, 1993). Therefore, If is calcu-
lated as follows:

where the transition rates  and  are computed using

Equations (1) and (2) and 1': 1, 2, 3, 4 (Khataee and Liew,

defined as the H or S cycle completion time as follows:

such that:

where p(a,-j, e,) is the probability of using the edge e,- from source

staying in detached state of kinesin and the attachment of kinesin

define the proportion of each pathway with probability P, given
by Equation (9) and P), given as follows:

A, = {a,-1, a,2, a,3}: an and cm correspond to the forward and
backward kinetic transitions from kinetic state i and a,3 expresses
the detachment of kinesin from MT in kinetic state i or staying in
kinetic state i. To compute the probability of actions a,3, we
distribute P0,, given by Equation (7) to states sl—s4 according
to the probability of being in each state. Therefore, the inactiva-
tion probabilities of Mkmesm in states sl—s4 per H or S cycle,
corresponding to the detachment probabilities of kinesin from
MT in kinetic states 1' (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) per mechanical cycle, are
defined as follows:

gered. The enabling condition of actions associated with state 50,,
is assigned as true, ECoff: aoffl, aoffz —> true, meaning that these

mechanism of kinesin, which can stay unattached or attached to
MT without time constraint. The enabling condition of action

of (A) [ATP] at various loads and (B) load F at different [ATP]. Mkmesm
also simulates <BD>, computed by the mean number of T (S) tra-
ces X 8.2 nm, against (C) [ATP] at different loads and (D) load F at vari-
ous [ATP]. The 25 and 75 percentile values obtained from the simulation
are shown in A and B panels. For panels C and D, these values are equal
to zero showing that more than 75% of runs of Mkmesm do not execute
T (s) trace

computed using Equation (11). These conditions enable transi-
tions to be triggered when the mean wait times in their corres-
ponding states are met. For the third actions of states sl—s4, dB
(1' = 1, 2, 3, 4), the enabling condition is assigned as true, mean-
ing that the detachment of kinesin from MT in kinetic state i or
staying in kinetic state i has no time constraint.

2.3 Simulations and discussion

To simulate the processivity of kinesin using Mhnesm model at
various [ATP] and loads, the function of Mkmesm is analysed over
its states, according to the principles of PTA, where the
behaviour of a system is modelled as a sequence of system
states (or events) called a trace (Alur and Dill, 1994).
Accordingly, to simulate the processivity of kinesin, we compute
the numbers of the following two traces completed in each run of
Mkinesin:

T(h)IS0—>S1—>S2—>S3—>S4—>S0
T(S)IS0—>S1—>S4—>S3—>S2—>S0

where T (h) and T (s) traces correspond to the stepping cycle
derived from ATP hydrolysis and synthesis kinetic cycle, re-
spectively. In each run, Mkmesm starts in state Soff, transits
stochastically between H or S cycles by executing T (h) and
T (s) traces until it becomes randomly inactivated in state
Soff. This run corresponds to the attachment of kinesin to
MT, hydrolysis or synthesis of ATP, and detachment from
MT. Hence, the mean numbers of T (h) and T (s) traces after
many runs of Mkmesm would represent <nh> and < ns>, re-
spectively. Then, using Equation (10), <RL> is computed by

<n> X 8.2nm. Mkmesm is run for 10000 times and the simula-
tion results of <RL>, shown in Figure 3A and B, indicate
good agreement with experimental observations in Schnitzer
et al. (2000) and theoretical findings in Liepelt and
Lipowsky (2007). Results in Figure 3A and B show that the
processivity of kinesin diminishes with increasing load or
decreasing [ATP], as showed in Liepelt and Lipowsky (2007)
and Schnitzer et a]. (2000). Similar to Figure 1C and D, simu-
lation results in Figure 3C and D show that <BD> is less than
8.2nm, implying that on average kinesin is not likely to step
backward by synthesizing ATP. This supports the observations
that backward steppings are more likely to be generated by
ATP hydrolysis (Carter and Cross, 2005). The low <BD> is
due to the low rate of ATP synthesis, wF, compared with that
of ATP hydrolysis, 115, which leads to low P, in comparison
with Pk. Therefore, the mean number of T (s) trace is below 1.
This low mean number of T (s) trace indicates that very few
T (s) traces are executed by Mkmesm, supporting the theory of
the four-state discrete stochastic model in Fisher and Kim
(2005), Fisher and Kolomeisky (2001) and Kolomeisky and
Fisher (2007) that backward stepping could result in ATP
synthesis. Figure 3A—D also indicates a close agreement be-
tween the simulation results and the results obtained from
theoretical analysis. This agreement of our simulation and

Fig. 5. Duration of a single cycle of Mkmesm and durations of states 51—54.
(A and B) Duration of a single cycle of Mkmesm calculated by Equation
(12) and corresponding to the cycle completion time of kinesin stepping.
(C and D) Durations of states S1— of Mkmesm are calculated by Equation
(11) and correspond to the mean waiting time in kinetic states ‘1’—‘4’
(Khataee and Liew, 2014)

theoretical results indicates that the number of T (h) and T (s)
traces executed by Mkmesm can be used to determine the mean
run length of kinesin.

Temporal analysis of Mkmesm shown in Figure 4 indicates that
the inactivation of Mkmesm executing either the T (h) or T (s) trace
most probably occurs: (i) in state S, at low [ATP] and low loads
and (ii) in states s3 and s4 at high loads or high [ATP]. These
analyses suggest kinetic state ‘1’ to be the most probable kinetic
state for kinesin detachment from MT at low [ATP] and low
loads (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with the detachment of kinesin
from MT due to a long mean waiting time in kinetic state ‘1’ at
limiting [ATP], as observed experimentally in Schnitzer et al.
(2000) and shown theoretically in Khataee and Liew (2014). In
accordance with the findings of Schnitzer et al. (2000) that at
high [ATP] the probability of detachment from kinetic state ‘1’
diminishes, our simulation further shows that at high [ATP] kin-
etic states ‘3’ and ‘4’ are the first and second most probable
kinetic states for the detachment of kinesin from MT due to
their longer durations (Fig. 4B). This is in agreement with the
reported kinetic states for the detachment of kinesin from MT
(Khataee and Liew, 2014; Schliwa, 2003; Seitz and Surrey, 2006).
These results are also consistent with the weak affinity of kinesin
to MT in kinetic states ‘3’ and ‘4’ (Schliwa, 2003; Seitz and
Surrey, 2006). Simulation results in Figure 4 further confirm
the small detachment probability of kinesin from MT in kinetic
state ‘2’, as reported in Seitz and Surrey (2006) due to tight af-
ﬁnity of the motor to MT in this state. In analyzing the temporal
properties of Mkmesm, Equation (12) further indicates that at low
[ATP] and low loads the duration of a stepping cycle is domi-
nated by the duration of kinetic state ‘1’ due to waiting for ATP
binding (Fig. 5), as reported in Schnitzer et al. (2000). With
increasing load, 1’; curve decreases suggesting that the duration
of a backward stepping cycle at high loads is more likely to be
less than that of a forward stepping cycle. In discussing the dur-
ations of kinetic states, it was shown that with an increase in the

rate of ATP synthesis at high loads, the detachment probability
of kinesin from MT would decrease as the duration of being in
kinetic state ‘3’ diminishes (Khataee and Liew, 2014). Hence, the
rise of ATP synthesis rate would lead to a rise in the backward
stepping frequency and thus, lowering <RL>.

In conclusion, our probabilistic timed automaton model con-
structed using the simple four-state discrete stochastic model
could accurately simulate the mechanical processivity of a single
kinesin motor at various [ATP] and loads. We showed that the
mean run length of the motor can be calculated by considering
both the ATP hydrolysis and synthesis kinetic cycles. By simulat-
ing both the ATP hydrolysis and synthesis kinetic pathways, we
could also explain some of the discrepancies between the previ-
ously reported theoretical and experimental findings.

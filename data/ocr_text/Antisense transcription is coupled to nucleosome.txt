ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genome-wide pervasive transcription is widespread in
eukaryotes, revealing an extensive array of antisense transcription
that involves hundreds of previously unknown non-coding RNAs.
Individual cases have shown that antisense transcription influences
sense transcription, however, genome-wide mechanisms of how anti-
sense transcription regulates sense transcription remain to be
elucidated.

Results: Here, we performed a systematic analysis of sense—anti-
sense transcription and nucleosome occupancy in yeast. We found
that antisense transcription is associated with nucleosome occupancy
in sense promoters. Using RNA polymerase II inactivation data as a
reasonable approximation to antisense transcription inactivation data,
we further showed that antisense transcripts increase nucleosome
occupancy in sense promoter regions they overlap, and reduce nu-
cleosome occupancy in sense promoter regions around their tran-
scription termination sites. These results reveal the previously
unappreciated roles of antisense transcription in directing nucleosome
occupancy in sense promoters. Our findings will have implications in
understanding regulatory functions of antisense transcription.

1 INTRODUCTION

Pervasive transcription is widespread in eukaryotic genomes
(David at al., 2006; Kapranov et al., 2007; Katayama et al.,
2005). The pervasive transcription gives rise to many non-coding
(nc) RNAs which are critical for biological processes such as
transcriptional regulation and genome stability (Bernstein and
Allis, 2005; Moazed, 2009). Some ncRNAs overlap protein-
coding genes, leading to the interleaved organization of tran-
scription. Among these overlapping ncRNAs are a class that
are transcribed antisense to the protein-coding sense transcripts.
Experiments on individual genes have shown that antisense
transcripts repress sense transcription through transcriptional
interference (Hongay et al., 2006) and inhibitory histone modi-
ﬁcations (Berretta et al., 2008; Camblong et al., 2007). How anti-
sense transcripts regulate sense transcription across the genome
has so far, however, not been elucidated.

The nucleosome is the basic unit of eukaryotic chromatin.
Nucleosome occupancy in promoter regions is important for
regulation of gene expression (Mavrich et al., 2008; Tirosh and
Barkai, 2008; Yuan et al., 2005). A natural question is whether
antisense transcription regulates sense transcription by influen-
cing nucleosome occupancy in sense promoters.

In this study, we analysed sense—antisense transcription and
investigated into the mechanisms of how antisense transcripts
regulate sense transcription on a genomic scale in yeast. We
found that antisense transcription causes sense transcripts to
show high nucleosome occupancy in promoter regions. We
also found that dynamic change in nucleosome occupancy in
sense promoters is coupled to change in antisense expression.

2 METHODS

Yeast open reading frame (ORF) transcript coordinate data [including
transcription start site (TSS) and transcription termination site (TTS)]
were taken from Xu et a]. (2009). We only used transcripts with conﬁ-
dently mapped 5/ ends and 3’ ends for analyses, a total of 4912 ORF
transcripts. Yeast ncRNA coordinate data (including TSS and TTS) were
taken from van Dijk et a]. (2011), a total of 1658 ncRNAs. We used the
4912 ORF transcripts and the 1658 ncRNAs to identify genome-wide
sense—antisense pairs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. If one ORF overlap
one ncRNA and they are transcribed oppositely, this ORF—ncRNA pair
is identified as sense—antisense pair. In this way, we identified 1163 sense—
antisense pairs (Supplementary Table Sl). We identified ORF transcripts
whose promoters are overlapped by antisense ncRNAs, to analyse the
regulatory effects of antisense transcription on nucleosome occupancy in
sense promoters.

Genome-wide gene transcription activity (transcription rate) data were
taken from Holstege et a]. (1998). Genome-wide RNA polymerase (Pol)
II occupancy data in both strands with nucleotide resolution were taken
from Churchman and Weissman (2011). For each transcript (ORF and
ncRNA), we calculated the average RNA Pol II occupancy across its
transcribed strand. As genome-wide transcription activity data are not
available for ncRNAs, we used the resulting value as a close approxima-
tion to transcriptional activity. For each promoter (600 bp upstream of
the transcript in this study), the RNA Pol II occupancy proﬁle is a vector
of length 600, in which each element is the RNA Pol II occupancy value
in each position. For each antisense-overlapped promoter, we calculated
the Euclidean distance between its RNA Pol II occupancy proﬁle and
that of each promoter without antisense transcript.

Genome-wide nucleosome occupancy data in YPD medium were mea-
sured with 1-bp resolution by Kaplan et a]. (2009), which were measured
by deep sequencing. We also used another independent datasets of
nucleosome occupancy in vivo (Lee et al., 2007), which were measured
by microarrays, to test the robustness to choice of datasets. For each
promoter (600 bp upstream of the transcript in this study), each coding

region, and each interval of [—150, —1], [—300, —1], [—450, —1], [—300,
—150], [—450, —300] and [—600, —450] in each promoter, we calculated
normalized nucleosome occupancy in this region divided by its length. All
data in this study were measured in YPD medium unless indicated.

Genome-wide nucleosome occupancy data before and after inactiva-
tion of RNA Pol II (rpr-I, 2h at 37°C) were taken from Weiner et a].
(2010). Genome-wide nucleosome occupancy data in ethanol and galact-
ose conditions were taken from Kaplan et a]. (2009). Expression level
data for sense transcripts and antisense transcripts in ethanol and galact-
ose conditions were taken from Xu et a]. (2009). We identiﬁed antisense
transcripts that show signiﬁcant down-regulation (<0.5-fold) in ethanol
or galactose conditions relative to YPD medium, and sense transcripts
that are signiﬁcantly up-regulated (>2-fold) in ethanol or galactose con-
ditions relative to YPD medium.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Antisense transcription is correlated with high
nucleosome occupancy in sense promoters

We analysed nucleosome occupancy in sense promoters over-
lapped by antisense transcripts. We found that gene promoters
overlapped by antisense transcripts show signiﬁcantly higher
nucleosome occupancy (Kaplan et al., 2009) within 150 bp up-
stream of their TSSs than the other promoters (P<10_18,
Mann—Whitney U-test, Fig. 1A). Similar result could be repro-
duced when using another dataset of genome-wide nucleosome
occupancy (Lee et al., 2007) (P< 10—40, Mann—Whitney U-test,
Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that this result is robust to
the choice of datasets. We also found that ncRNA promoters
overlapped by ORF transcripts show signiﬁcantly higher nucleo-
some occupancy (Kaplan et al., 2009) within 150 bp upstream of
their TSSs than the other ncRNAs (—0.29 versus —0.59;
P<10_6, Mann—Whitney U-test). Moreover, ORFs whose pro-
moters are overlapped by antisense transcripts show lower tran-
scriptional activities (Churchman and Weissman, 2011) than the
other ORFs (1.68 versus 2.08; P< 10—4, Mann—Whitney U—test),
and ncRNAs whose promoters are overlapped by ORF tran-
scripts also show lower transcriptional activities (Churchman
and Weissman, 2011) than the other ncRNAs (0.95 versus
1.14; P<10_10, Mann—Whitney U-test). These results suggest
that the presence of antisense (sense) transcripts is associated
with high nucleosome occupancy in their overlapped sense (anti-
sense) promoters and low sense (antisense) transcriptional activ-
ity, which is consistent with previous observation that antisense
transcription generally represses sense transcription (Berretta
et al., 2008). We found that antisense transcriptional activity
(Churchman and Weissman, 2011) is not correlated with nucleo-
some occupancy in sense promoters in YPD medium (Pearson
correlation coefﬁcient, R = —0.003, P = 0.95). Nucleosome occu-
pancy is known to be determined by multiple factors, including
DNA sequence, chromatin remodelers and so on. These factors
have been shown to explain most of nucleosome occupancy
in vivo (Segal and Widom, 2009). Even if antisense transcription
inﬂuences nucleosome occupancy in sense promoters, its contri-
bution to nucleosome occupancy should be smaller than the
other nucleosome occupancy determinants. In one cellular
condition, antisense transcriptional activity is thus likely not
to be correlated with nucleosome occupancy that is largely coor-
dinated by the other determinants. Nucleosome occupancy

Fig. 1. Antisense transcription is correlated with high nucleosome occu-
pancy in sense promoters. (A) Average nucleosome proﬁles in promoter
regions are shown for ORFs with antisense-overlapped promoters and
ORFs without antisense transcripts. (B) Average values that correspond
to nucleosome occupancy changes (relative to YPD) in sense promoters
are shown for ORFs whose paired antisense transcripts are signiﬁcantly
down-regulated (<0.5—fold) and ORFs whose paired antisense transcripts
are not, depicted for two conditions: ethanol (YPE) and galactose
(YPGal). Sense promoters whose paired antisense transcripts are signiﬁ-
cantly down-regulated (<0.5—fold) in ethanol or galactose conditions,
show signiﬁcantly reduced nucleosome occupancy than the other sense
promoters. (C) Average values that correspond to nucleosome occupancy
within 150 bp upstream of TSS are shown for ORFs with
antisense-overlapped promoters and ORFs without antisense transcripts,
depicted for ﬁve levels of ORF transcriptional activity. The result dem-
onstrates that the correspondence between antisense transcription and
high nucleosome occupancy within 150 bp upstream of sense TSS could
be reproduced when controlling for sense transcriptional activities. Error
bars in (B) and (C) were calculated by bootstrapping. The statistical
signiﬁcant values calculated from Mann—Whitney U-test are indicated
in (B) and (C)

undergoes small changes among cellular conditions. These
changes in individual promoters might be caused by changes in
fewer nucleosome occupancy determinants, increasing the con-
tribution of antisense transcription. Analysis of the dynamic data
among cellular conditions might reveal the correlation between
antisense transcriptional activity and nucleosome occupancy.
We found that antisense transcriptional activity changes show
signiﬁcant positive correlation with nucleosome occupancy
changes in sense promoters from YPDmedium to ethanol (gal-
actose) condition (Pearson correlation coefﬁcient, R=0.l9,
P<0.01, for ethanol condition; R2015, P<0.01, for galactose
condition; Fig. 1B, and Supplementary Figs S2 and S3). It is the
difference in antisense transcription that correlates more strongly
with difference in nucleosome occupancy.

However, the correlation between antisense transcription and
high nucleosome occupancy in sense promoters may not be
direct but an artifact caused by low transcriptional activities of
sense transcripts, because genes with high nucleosome occupancy
within 150 bp upstream of their TSSs have low transcriptional

activities (Tirosh and Barkai, 2008), and genes with antisense
transcripts also have low transcriptional activities (see above).
We sought to examine whether this correlation could be observed
when controlling for sense transcriptional activities. To this end,
we clustered genes into ﬁve groups according to their transcrip-
tional activities (Holstege et al., 1998), and genes in the same
group have similar transcriptional activities. We found that
genes with antisense-overlapped promoters still show signiﬁ-
cantly higher nucleosome occupancy within 150 bp upstream of
their TSSs than the other promoters when controlling for sense
transcriptional activities (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S4).
This result indicates that the correlation between antisense tran-
scription and high nucleosome occupancy in sense promoters
is not caused by sense transcriptional activities. Considering
that GC content of DNA sequence may bias the sampling
of nucleosome-associated reads (Chung et al., 2010), we con-
trolled for GC content and similar results could be observed
(Supplementary Fig. S5).

We next examined whether ncRNAs increase nucleosome
occupancy in regions that they overlap. We identiﬁed genes
whose promoter regions are overlapped by tandem ncRNAs.
We found that these genes also show higher nucleosome occu-
pancy in promoters than the other genes (<—0.19 versus —0.26;
P<0.05, Mann—Whitney U-test). Genes with antisense
transcripts also show higher nucleosome occupancy in coding
regions than the other genes (0.17 versus 0.05; P<10_13,
Mann—Whitney U-test). We also identiﬁed 103 sense—antisense
pairs between two ncRNAs. We found that ncRNAs with anti-
sense ncRNAs show higher nucleosome occupancy within 150 bp
upstream of their TSSs than the other ncRNAs (—0.37 versus
—0.63), albeit with weak statistical signiﬁcance (P = 0.09, Mann—
Whitney U-test). These results imply that increased nucleosome
occupancy is a general feature for regions overlapped by
ncRNAs.

3.2 Antisense transcription inﬂuences nucleosome
occupancy in sense promoters

We further investigated into nucleosomal organization of sense
promoters overlapped by antisense transcripts. As shown in
Supplementary Figure S6, nucleosome occupancy around anti-
sense TTSs is lower than that in antisense transcripts. We asked
whether this nucleosomal feature of antisense transcripts inﬂu-
ences nucleosome occupancy in antisense-overlapped sense pro-
moters: sense promoter regions overlapped by antisense
transcripts show high nucleosome occupancy and sense promoter
regions around antisense TTSs show low nucleosome occupancy.
As nucleosome occupancy is not uniform throughout ORF pro-
moters (Fig. 1A) and antisense transcripts terminate at different
regions in sense promoters, it might confound the results if we
analyse nucleosome occupancy of all antisense transcripts to-
gether. We thus should analyse antisense transcripts according
to their TTSs respect to sense transcript TSSs, respectively.
We classiﬁed antisense-overlapped sense promoters into three
clusters: those whose paired antisense transcripts terminate
in [—300, —150] (N=101), [—450, —300] (N=50) and [—600,
—450] (N: 29) in sense promoters, respectively. For these three
sense promoter clusters, [—150, —1], [—300, —1] and [—450, —1]
are their respective regions overlapped by antisense transcripts,

and [—300, —150], [—450, —300] and [—600, —450] are their re-
spective regions around antisense TTSs. We found that the three
sense promoter clusters show signiﬁcantly higher nucleosome oc-
cupancy (Kaplan et al., 2009) in regions overlapped by antisense
transcripts, and show signiﬁcantly lower nucleosome occupancy
in regions around antisense TTSs than the promoters without
antisense transcripts (Fig. 2A, and Supplementary Figs S7 and
S8). Similar result could be reproduced when using another data-
set of genome-wide nucleosome occupancy (W einer et al., 2010;
Supplementary Fig. S9).

As nucleosome occupancy in gene promoter is correlated
with gene transcription, we next examined whether the obser-
vation above is an artifact of sense transcription. If this is the
case, the nucleosome occupancy characteristics of antisense-
overlapped sense promoters in Figure 2A should disappear
when controlling for gene transcription. We analysed this poten-
tial artifact in terms of gene transcriptional rates and RNA Pol II
occupancy in gene promoters. First, using genome-wide tran-
scriptional rate data (Holstege et al., 1998), for each gene with
antisense-overlapped promoter, we calculated the difference
value between its transcriptional rate and that of each gene with-
out antisense transcript, and could identify the gene without
antisense transcript whose transcriptional rate is the most similar
to this gene. Compared to these identiﬁed genes with similar
transcriptional rates to antisense-overlapped sense transcripts,
we found that antisense-overlapped sense promoter show signiﬁ-
cantly higher nucleosome occupancy in regions overlapped by
antisense transcripts, and show signiﬁcantly lower nucleosome
occupancy in regions around antisense TTSs (Supplementary
Fig. S10A). Second, using genome-wide RNA Pol II occupancy
data (Churchman and Weissman, 2011), for each antisense-
overlapped promoter, we calculated the Euclidean distance be-
tween its RNA Pol II occupancy proﬁle and that of each pro-
moter without antisense transcript, and could identify the
promoter without antisense transcript whose RNA Pol II occu-
pancy proﬁle is the most similar (i.e. the least Euclidean distance)
to this promoter. Compared to these identiﬁed promoters with
similar RNA Pol II occupancy proﬁles to antisense-overlapped
promoters, we found that antisense-overlapped sense promoter
show signiﬁcantly higher nucleosome occupancy in regions over-
lapped by antisense transcripts, and show signiﬁcantly lower nu-
cleosome occupancy in regions around antisense TTSs
(Supplementary Fig. S10B). Together, the nucleosome occu-
pancy characteristics of antisense-overlapped sense promoters
in Figure 2A could be observed when controlling for gene tran-
scription. These results collectively demonstrate that the nucleo-
somal occupancy difference between antisense-overlapped sense
promoters and the other promoters depicted in Figure 2A is not
associated with sense transcription.

We ﬁnally tested whether antisense transcription inﬂuences
nucleosome occupancy in sense promoters. The results above
are based on correlation analyses, more analyses are thus
needed to examine the causality. If the nucleosomal occupancy
difference between antisense-overlapped sense promoters and
the other promoters is caused by antisense transcription, this
difference should disappear when antisense transcription is inac-
tivated. As genome-wide nucleosome occupancy data are not
available for inactivation of antisense transcription, we used

Fig. 2. Antisense transcription inﬂuences nucleosome occupancy in
sense promoters. (A) Average values that correspond to nucleosome
occupancy in antisense-overlapped regions and regions around antisense
TTSs are shown for antisense-overlapped promoters, depicted for three
types of sense promoters. For comparison, the corresponding regions
are also shown for promoters without antisense transcripts. We
excluded analysis to sense promoters whose paired antisense transcripts
terminate in [—150, —1] because of their small overlap by antisense
transcripts. The antisense-overlapped sense promoters show signiﬁcantly
higher nucleosome occupancy in regions overlapped by antisense tran-
scripts, and show signiﬁcantly lower nucleosome occupancy in regions
around antisense TTSs. (B) Same as (A), but for nucleosome occupancy
after inactivation of RNA Pol II (a close approximation to inactivation
of antisense transcription, see details in main text). Considering that
inactivation of RNA Pol II mainly inﬂuences nucleosome occupancy
in nucleosome-free regions (i.e. [—150, —1] in gene promoters) and in
coding regions, we excluded analysis to nucleosome occupancy in
[—150, —1] in sense promoters, to avoid confounding the inﬂuence of
antisense inactivation on nucleosome occupancy in this region, so the
binning pattern in (B) is different from that in (A). The signiﬁcant
differences in nucleosomal occupancy between antisense-overlapped
sense promoters and the other promoters depicted in (A) disappear in
(B). The statistical signiﬁcant values calculated from Mann—Whitney
U-test are indicated in (A) and (B). Error bars were calculated by
bootstrapping

genome-wide nucleosome occupancy data upon inactivation of
RNA Pol II (\Neiner et al., 2010) as a close approximation.
Although inactivation of RNA Pol II inﬂuences both antisense
transcription and sense transcription, we have shown above
that the nucleosomal occupancy difference between antisense-
overlapped sense promoters and the other promoters is not asso-
ciated with sense transcription, so the approximation above is
reasonable in the analysis of the nucleosomal occupancy differ-
ence between antisense-overlapped sense promoters and the
other promoters. Considering that inactivation of RNA Pol II
inﬂuences nucleosome occupancy in nucleosome-free regions (i.e.
[—150, —1] in gene promoters) and in coding regions (Weiner
et al., 2010), we excluded analysis to nucleosome occupancy in
[—150, —1] in sense promoters, to avoid confounding the inﬂu-
ence of antisense inactivation on nucleosome occupancy in this
region. Upon inactivation of RNA Pol II (a close approximation
to inactivation of antisense transcription), we found that the
nucleosomal occupancy difference between antisense-overlapped
sense promoters and the other promoters depicted in Figure 2A
disappeared (Fig. 2B). This result shows that the nucleosomal
occupancy characteristics in antisense-overlapped sense pro-
moters are caused by antisense transcription. Taken together,
these results demonstrate that antisense transcription inﬂuences
nucleosome occupancy in sense promoters.

4 CONCLUSION

Individual cases have shown that antisense transcription inﬂu-
ences sense transcription through transcriptional interference
and histone modiﬁcations. However, genome-wide mechanisms
of how antisense transcription regulates sense transcription
remain to be determined. Here, we found that antisense
transcripts are associated with high nucleosome occupancy in
their overlapped sense promoter regions and low nucleosome
occupancy in sense promoter regions around their TTSs
(Supplementary Fig. S1 1). Moreover, dynamic antisense expres-
sion change is correlated with nucleosome occupancy change in
sense promoters. These results reveal the mechanisms of how
antisense transcription regulates sense transcription, and also
provide new level of understanding the determinants of nucleo-
some occupancy in gene promoters. As we used RNA polymer-
ase II inactivation data as an approximation to test the inﬂuence
of antisense transcription on nucleosome occupancy, it will
be very interesting to directly examine how antisense transcrip-
tion regulates nucleosome occupancy in sense promoters by
experiments.

Abstract

Motivation: The goal of fine-mapping in genomic regions associated with complex diseases and
traits is to identify causal variants that point to molecular mechanisms behind the associations.
Recent fine-mapping methods using summary data from genome-wide association studies rely on
exhaustive search through all possible causal configurations, which is computationally expensive.

Results: We introduce FINEMAP, a software package to efficiently explore a set of the most import-
ant causal configurations of the region via a shotgun stochastic search algorithm. We show that
FINEMAP produces accurate results in a fraction of processing time of existing approaches and is
therefore a promising tool for analyzing growing amounts of data produced in genome-wide asso-

ciation studies and emerging sequencing projects.

1 Introduction

Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified thou-
sands of genomic regions associated with complex diseases and
traits. Any associated region may contain thousands of genetic vari-
ants with complex correlation structure. Therefore, one of the next
challenges is fine-mapping that aims to pinpoint individual variants
and genes that have a direct effect on the trait. This step is crucial
for fully exploiting the potential of GWAS: to unveil molecular biol-
ogy of complex traits and, eventually, provide targets for therapeutic
interventions. For a recent review on fine-mapping, see Spain and
Barrett (2015).

A standard approach for refining association signals is a step-
wise conditional analysis, an iterative procedure that conditions

P-value of association until no additional SNP reaches the pre-as-
signed P-value threshold. While conditional analysis is informative
about the number of complementary sources of association signals
within the region, it fails to provide probabilistic measures of causal-
ity for individual variants. To overcome this problem, many recent
fine-mapping methods have adopted a Bayesian framework.
Approaches for Bayesian analysis of multi-SNP GWAS data in-
clude exhaustive search as implemented in software BIMBAM
(Servin and Stephens, 2007), MCMC algorithms (Guan and
Stephens, 2011), variational approximations (Carbonetto and
Stephens, 2012) and stochastic search as implemented in software
GUESS (Bottolo and Richardson, 2010, Bottolo et al., 2013) and
GUESSFM (Wallace et al., 2015). Bayesian fine-mapping has also
been conducted under a simplified assumption of a single causal

variant in the region (WTCCC et al., 2012). Common to these
approaches is that they require original genotype-phenotype data as
input, which is becoming impractical or even impossible as the size
of current GWAS meta-analyses rises to several hundreds of thou-
sands of samples (Wood et al., 2014). For this reason, fine-mapping
methods have recently been extended to use only GWAS summary
data together with a SNP correlation estimate from a reference
panel. To our knowledge, the existing fine-mapping implementa-
tions using GWAS summary data are PAINTOR (Kichaev et al.,
2014, Kichaev and Pasaniuc, 2015), CAVIAR (Hormozdiari et al.,
2014) and CAVIARBF (Chen et al., 2015).

PAINTOR is an EM-algorithm to jointly fine-map several associ-
ated regions by utilizing functional annotation information of indi-
vidual variants. As a special case of only a single region without
annotation information, PAINTOR tackles the standard fine-
mapping problem. CAVIAR differs from PAINTOR by modeling
the uncertainty in the observed association statistics. This might be a
reason why CAVIARBF, a more efficient implementation of
CAVIAR, has been reported to be more accurate than PAINTOR in
prioritizing variants when no annotation information is available
(Chen et al., 2015).

Although PAINTOR, CAVIAR and CAVIARBF are very useful
methods for performing fine-mapping on GWAS summary data, we
think that their implementation via an exhaustive search through all
possible causal configurations is likely to hinder their use in several
settings. For example, it becomes computationally slow or even im-
possible to run these methods by allowing more than three causal
variants on dense genotype data with thousands of variants per re-
gion. Thus, these methods are unlikely to make full use of unprece-
dented statistical power to discern complex association patterns
provided by ever increasing GWAS sample sizes and genome
sequencing technologies.

We introduce FINEMAP, a novel software package to improve
the performance of GWAS summary data based fine-mapping. The
statistical model of FINEMAP is similar to CAVIAR and
CAVIARBF while the important difference is the computational al-
gorithm. FINEMAP uses a Shotgun Stochastic Search (SSS) algo-
rithm (Hans et al., 2007) that explores the vast space of causal
configurations by concentrating efforts on the configurations with
non-negligible probability. We compare FINEMAP with the ex-
haustive search algorithm implemented in CAVIARBF. The com-
parisons to two other GWAS summary data based fine-mapping
methods CAVIAR and PAINTOR are not shown in this paper since
CAVIARBF is more efficient but equally accurate as CAVIAR and
more accurate than PAINTOR without annotation information
(Chen et al., 2015 ). In this paper we show that

° FINEMAP is thousands of times faster than CAVIARBF while
still providing similar accuracy in the examples where
CAVIARBF can be applied.

° FINEMAP is more accurate than CAVIARBF when the number
of causal variants in CAVIARBF needs to be restricted for com-
putational reasons.

Our examples are based on genotype and lipid level data of the
Finnish population (Borodulin et al., 2015) as well as summary statistics
from GWAS on Parkinson’s disease (UKPDC and WTCCC2, 2011).

2 Model

We are interested in fine-mapping a genomic region using GWAS
summary data instead of original genotype-phenotype data as input.

The building blocks of our Bayesian approach are the likelihood
function (Section 2.1), priors (Section 2.2), efficient likelihood
evaluation (Section 2.3) and efficient search algorithm (section 3).
At each step we describe how our choices differ from the existing
methods PAINTOR and CAVIARBF.

2.1 Likelihood function

For a quantitative trait, we assume the following linear model
y = X}. + e,

where y is a mean-centered vector of values of a quantitative trait
for 11 individuals, X a column-standardized SNP genotype matrix of
dimension n X m and p(e) = N(e|0, 021,1). The Maximum
Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of the causal SNP effects 2 depends on X
and y only through the SNP correlation matrix R = n‘lXTX and
single-SNP z—scores 2 = (1102) _1/2XTy

2 = (XTX)_1XTy = nTI/20R_12

ya] = 02(XTX)_1 = 11—102R—1.

Thus, it is possible to approximate the likelihood function for Z by
N(2|Z,V[2]) using a SNP correlation estimate from a reference panel
and single-SNP z-scores from a standard GWAS software, as previ-
ously done in GCTA (Yang et al., 2011), PAINTOR and
CAVIARBF. Note that with z-scores for quantitative traits we can
assume that 02 = 1 without any loss of generality. For binary traits,
a similar approximation applies with z-scores originating from logis-
tic regression and 02 z 1 /{(p(1 — (p)}, where (p is the proportion of
cases among the 11 individuals (Pirinen et al., 2013).

When m is large but 2 has only very few non-zero elements, the
MLE alone is not ideal since it does not account for the sparsity as-
sumption (Fig. 1). Thus, we take a Bayesian approach with a prior
distribution that induces sparsity among causal effects.

2.2 Priors for A and y

Let a binary indicator vector 3! determine which SNPs have non-zero
causal effects (ye = 1 if the Zth SNP is causal and 0, otherwise; see
top panel in Fig. 1). For the causal effects, we use the prior

20(10): NMIO, 810210),

where $121 is the user given prior variance for the causal effects in units
of 02, with 02 = 1 for quantitative traits and 02 = 1 /{(p(1 — (p)} for
binary traits, and A3) a diagonal matrix with v on the diagonal. In
our examples for quantitative traits, we have set 5121 = 0.052. This
means that with 95% probability a causal SNP explains less than
1% of the trait variation. When available z-scores originate from lo-
gistic regression, a value of 5,21 = (005 / (7)2 = 0.052(p(1 — (p) means

Fig. 1. The binary indicator vector y determines which SNPs have non-zero
causal effects (m). The corresponding causal (linear) model for a quantitative
trait assumes only few SNPs with a causal effect. The Maximum Likelihood
Estimate (MLE) of the causal SNP effects 2 can be computed by using only
the SNP correlation matrix and single-SNP z-scores. However, the MLE is not
ideal because it does not account for the sparsity assumption

that with 95 % probability the effect of a causal SNP on the odds-
ratio scale is less than 1.15 for common variants (MAF = 0.5) and
less than 2.0 for low-frequency variants (MAF = 0.01), where MAF
is the minor allele frequency. Robustness to the values of 5,1 has been
studied previously by Chen et al. (2015).

To define the prior for each causal configuration, we use a gen-
eral discrete distribution for the number of causal SNPs

pk = Pr(J:I of causal SNPs is k), k = 1, - - - ,K,

where K << m is the maximum number of SNPs in the causal config-
uration. Note that we assume that the region to be fine-mapped in-
cludes at least one causal SNP, i.e. p0 = 0. For a fixed value of k, we
assume the same probability for each configuration with k causal
SNPs. Thus, a priori,

17(7) =Pk/  when in = k.
k 2:1

PAINTOR does not use an explicit prior on k but restricts k S 3
in practice. The default prior used by CAVIARBF builds on that of
CAVIAR and assumes that each SNP is causal with probability 1 / m
and that k S 5. This is a special case of our prior when we set

Pk — k m m
and renormalize for K = 5 except that CAVIARBF assigns non-zero
prior also for the null configuration k = 0.

2.3 Marginal likelihood for y
We now show how the marginal likelihood for the causal configur-
ation y can be computed efficiently.

2.3.1 Integrating out causal effects 2

The likelihood function p(y|Z,X) of the causal SNP effects is (pro-
portional to) a Normal density N(2|Z,02(nR)_1). This enables an
analytic solution for the marginal likelihood of y eliminating the
causal effects

max) = (p(yll,X)p(llv)dl

2 Map, 02(nR)_1 + $021,)
=NQMR+an,

where we defined 2,, E 11512121,. Importantly, an evaluation of the
marginal likelihood requires only single-SNP z-scores and SNP cor-
relations from a reference panel and does not depend on 02. This
elimination of i. is similar to the one used by CAVIAR and
CAVIARBF and differs from PAINTOR that fixes those values
based on the observed z-scores. Next, we describe two implementa-
tions to evaluate N(%|0,R+RZ,R) with high computational
efficiency.

2.3.2 Reducing the complexity from 0(m3) to 0(k3)

Option 1. Let C = {1,...,k} and N: {12+ 1,...,m} be respect-
ively the set of causal and non-causal SNPs. Consider the quadratic
form

Q = £0: + Ram—12 = $0,, + 2,10%

inside the exponential function in N(%|O,R+RE,R), where
a=RT12 can be precomputed. We solve the linear system

(Im + EvR)b = a for b by observing that the m — k elements in 1)
corresponding to non-causal SNPs (1215 = 0) are by 2 (lg and the re-
maining elements result from solving a system of k equations

(1k + nsﬁRCC)bc 2 dc — nsﬁRCNaN,

where RCC is the k X k correlation matrix of the causal SNPs and
RCN the k X (m — k) submatrix of R corresponding to the correl-
ations between the causal and non-causal SNPs. In addition, we ob-
serve that det(Im + EvR) is simply det(Ik + nsﬁRCC) after expanding
with respect to the rows corresponding to non-causal SNPs.
Computationally, these computations require one Cholesky decom-
position with complexity O(k3) and provide thus a considerable sav-
ing compared to the naive way of decomposing the whole m x m
matrix with complexity (9(m3 

This derivation differs from the one used by CAVIARBF that is
similar to our option 2 below. It also differs from PAINTOR that
fixes 2 based on the observed z-scores and performs once a Cholesky
decomposition of the whole m X m SNP correlation matrix that is
used repeatedly in each likelihood evaluation. Note that option 1
cannot be used in case of collinearity among the SNPs, because the
correlation matrix R is not invertible if two SNPs are perfectly corre-
lated and is unstable with nearly perfectly correlated SNPs.

Option 2. We partition the observed z—scores into components 2c
and 2N and permute rows and columns of the SNP correlation ma-
trix and covariance matrix 2,, such that

and Z, = diag{og}with ak+1 = - -- 2 am 2 0. This partitioning en-
tails a block structure in the covariance matrix of N(£|O, R + REVR)

Using properties of the multivariate Normal distribution, the condi-
tional expectation and covariance matrix of 2N given 2c are readily
available

IEI2N|§cl = RNCREéﬁc
VI2N|2CI = RNN — RNCREéRCN

and do not depend on 2,. We rewrite the marginal likelihood
p(y|y,X) =N(2|0,R +RZVR) in terms of the marginal distribution
of 2c and conditional distribution of 2N given %c to obtain the fol-

derivation explicitly shown in Chen et al. (2015 ). Note that the cor-
relation submatrix Rcc is not invertible if there is almost perfect col-
linearity among the SNPs in C. To handle this case, we have
implemented an option in FINEMAP to set the posterior probability
of a causal configuration to zero if it contains at least one SNP pair
with absolute correlation greater or equal to some specified

threshold.

2.4 Posterior for 3;

According to the Bayesian paradigm, we want to base our inference
on the posterior of causal configurations p(y|y,X). The unnormal-
ized posterior can be evaluated by combining the prior with the mar-
ginal likelihood (option 1) as

—1
m
P’l(vly,X) = (k) Dr X P(ylv,X),

where k is the number of causal SNPs in configuration y. In add-
ition, we can compute unnormalized posterior by using the Bayes
factor (option 2)

—1
m
P3<vly,X) = < k) Dr X BF(v = NULL)-

We observed that option 2 was faster than option 1 and therefore
option 2 is used by default in FINEMAP. Ideally, p*(y|y,X) were

normalized over all 25:1 k causal configurations.

Unfortunately, this is computationally intractable already for mod-
est values of K > 5. However, as we show in the results section, typ-
ically a large majority of the causal configurations have negligible
posterior probability and hence a good approximation for the
posterior can be achieved by concentrating on only those with non-
negligible probability. We explore the space of causal configurations
with a Shotgun Stochastic Search (SSS) algorithm (Hans et al., 2007)
that rapidly evaluates many configurations and is designed to dis-
cover especially those with highest posterior probability.

3 Shotgun stochastic search

We use SSS to efficiently evaluate many causal configurations and dis-
cover especially those with highest posterior probability. SSS conducts
a pre-defined number of iterations within the space of causal configur-
ations. In each iteration (Fig. 2), the neighborhood of the current
causal configuration is defined by configurations that result from
deleting, changing or adding a causal SNP from the current configur-
ation. The next iteration starts by sampling a new causal configur-
ation from the neighborhood based on p*(y|y,X) normalized within
the neighborhood. All evaluated causal configurations and their
unnormalized posterior probabilities are saved in a list 1"k for down-
stream analyses. The aim of the algorithm is that 1"k contains all rele-
vant causal configurations, that is, those with non-negligible posterior
probabilities.

The posterior probability that SNPs in configuration 1: are causal
is computed by normalizing over F*

p(vly,X) = p*<v|y.X>/Z p*<v|y,X>.

We compute the marginal posterior probability that the Zth SNP is
causal, also called single-SNP inclusion probability, by averaging
over all evaluated configurations

Fig. 2. Shotgun stochastic search rapidly identifies configurations of causal
SNPs with high posterior probability. In each iteration, the neighborhood of
the current causal configuration is defined by configurations that result from
deleting, changing or adding a causal SNP () from the current configuration.
The next iteration starts by sampling a new causal configuration from the
neighborhood based on the scores normalized within the neighborhood. The
unnormalized posterior probabilities remain fixed throughout the algorithm
and can thus be memorized (V) to avoid recomputation when already-eval-
uated configurations appear in another neighborhood

In addition, we compute a single-SNP Bayes factor for assessing the
evidence that the Zth SNP is causal as

where the prior probability of the Zth SNP being causal is

 

K k

k=1
PAINTOR, CAVIAR and CAVIARBF do not perform a stochas-
tic search but enumerate all causal configurations with k = 1, . . . ,K.

When m is large but there are only few true causal SNPs, the ex-
haustive search is computationally expensive and inefficient since
most configurations make a negligible contribution to the single-
SNP inclusion probabilities.

3.1 Computational implementation
For 1 < k < K, the number of causal configurations to be evaluated
in each iteration is:

° k for deleting,
° k(m — k) for changing,
° m — k for adding a causal SNP

Computing p*(y|y, X) requires a Cholesky decomposition with com-
plexity 0(k3) that is fast when K << m. Importantly, each unnormal-
ized posterior probability remains fixed throughout the algorithm.
This means that we can use a hash table (std::unordered_map in
C ++) to avoid recomputing p*(y|y,X) when already-evaluated con-
figurations appear in another neighborhood. Inserting to and retriev-
ing from the hash table requires constant time on average. Hash table
lookups reduce the dominant computational cost of the algorithm:
exploring the vast space of causal configurations. This renders SSS
computational efficient because it traverses the space of causal

configurations by moving back and forth to configurations with high
posterior probability and overlapping neighborhoods.

4 Test data generation

We obtained real genotype data on 18 834 individuals from the
National FINRISK study (Borodulin et al., 2015). The genotype
data comprise a 500 kilobase region centered on rs11591147 in
PCSK9 gene on chromosome 1 with 1920 polymorphic SNPs with
pairwise absolute correlations less than 0.99. To assess the computa-
tional efficiency and fine-mapping accuracy, we considered the fol-
lowing scenarios:

° Scenario A
Increasing number of SNPs (m = 750, 1000, 1250, 1500) con-
sidering causal conﬁgurations with up to K = 3 or K = 5 SNPs.

° Scenario B
Fixed number of m = 150 SNPs considering causal conﬁgur-
ations with increasing maximum number of SNPs
(K = 1,2,3,4,5).

We generated datasets where causal SNPs had highly correlated
proxies since this is a setting where an in-exhaustive search could
theoretically have problems. Five hundred datasets were generated
under each combination of m and K in scenarios A and B using the
following linear model:

y = 2mg. +N(e10. 021),

56C

where C is the set of causal SNPs, g6 the vector of genotypes at the
cth causal SNP, ﬁg and f6 respectively the effect size and minor allele
frequency of the cth causal SNP and 02 = 1 — 266C 2fc(1 — fJﬁZ.
The number of causal SNPs was five in scenario A and B. In each
dataset, the causal SNPs were randomly chosen among those vari-
ants that had highly correlated proxies (absolute correlation greater
than 0.5 ) among the other variants. The effect sizes of the causal
SNPs were specified so that the statistical power at a significance
level of 5 X 10‘8 was approximately 0.5. Single-SNP testing using a
linear model was performed to compute z—scores. Each set of
z—scores was then analyzed with CAVIARBF (default parameters)
and FINEMAP (100 iterations saving the top 50 000 evaluated
causal configurations). For both methods, the prior standard devi-
ation of the causal effects was set to 0.05 and the prior distribution
of each configuration with k causal SNPs was specified as

k m—k
P(7)O<(l)  ,fork=1,...,K.

m m

This required excluding the null configuration (k = 0) from the out-
put of CAVIARBF.

5 Results

The main difference between FINEMAP and CAVIARBF is the
search strategy to explore the space of causal configurations. We
compare the computational efficiency and fine-mapping accuracy of
FINEMAP with CAVIARBF to assess the impact of replacing ex-
haustive with stochastic search. We also illustrate FINEMAP on
data from 4q22/SN CA region that contains a complex association
pattern with Parkinson’s disease (UKPDC and WTCCC2, 2011) as
well as on data from 15q21/LIPC region associated with HDL-C
(Surakka et al., 2015).

E5-2690v3 processor running at 2.6 GHz

5.1 Computational efficiency

The top panel of Figure 3 shows that FINEMAP is thousands of
times faster than CAVIARBF when considering causal configur-
ations with up to three SNPs in Scenario A. The difference in pro-
cessing time becomes even larger when the maximum number of
possible causal SNPs increases (Scenario B) in the bottom panel of
Figure 3. CAVIARBF slows down quickly due to the exhaustive
search but FINEMAP’s processing time does not increase consider-
ably with increasing K. Importantly, there is no need to restrict the
number of causal SNPs in FINEMAP to small values (K S 5) as is
necessary for CAVIARBF.

5.2 Fine-mapping accuracy
We computed the maximum absolute differences between the single-
SNP inclusion probabilities in each dataset under scenario B to as-
sess the fine-mapping accuracy of FINEMAP and CAVIARBF
(Table 1). The small differences (max < 0.11, median < 6 X 104)
show that for practical purposes FINEMAP achieves similar accur-
acy as CAVIARBF despite concentrating only on a small but rele-
vant subset of all possible causal configurations (see Discussion).
Figure 4 shows details of those SNPs in Scenario B for which the dif-
ference between the methods is larger than 0.01. We see that by
ignoring the large majority of very improbable configurations,
FINEMAP slightly overestimates the largest probabilities, that typic-
ally belong to the truly causal SNPs, and underestimates smaller
probabilities, that most often belong to the non-causal SNPs.

In addition to considering only causal configurations with up to
three SNPs under scenario A, we also ran FINEMAP with K = 5 to
demonstrate the increase in fine-mapping performance in this case

Fig. 4. Single-SNP inclusion probabilities of all SNPs in Scenario B with abso-
lute difference Iargerthan 0.01 between FINEMAP and CAVIARBF

where the true number of causal SNPs was five. We determined the
proportion of causal SNPs that are included when selecting different
numbers of top SNPs on the basis of ranked single-SNP inclusion
probabilities (Fig. 5). FINEMAP and CAVIARBF had the same per-
formance when considering causal configurations with up to three
SNPs in genomic regions with 15 00 SNPs. (Similar performance was
also observed for genomic regions with different numbers of SNPs.)
As expected, FINEMAP showed better fine-mapping performance
when considering causal configurations with up to five SNPs.

5.3 4q22/SNCA association with Parkinson’s disease
Using single-SNP testing, the UKPDC and WTCCC2 (2011) found
evidence for an association with Parkinson’s disease in the 4q22 re-
gion with the lowest P-value at rs35 6220. A conditional analysis on
rs356220 revealed a second SNP rs7687945 with P-value 3 X 10_5
that in the single-SNP testing had only a modest P-value of 0.13.
These two SNPs are in low Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)
(1*2 = 0.168 in the original data) but the LD was sufficient enough to
mask the effect of rs7687945 in single-SNP testing. This complex
pattern of association was replicated in an independent French data-
set (UKPDC and WTCCC2, 201 1).

To test whether FINEMAP is able to pick up this complex asso-
ciation pattern, we extracted a 2 megabase region centered on
rs35 6220 with 363 directly genotyped SNPs from the original geno-
type data. Single-SNP testing using a logistic model implemented in
SNPTEST was performed to compute z-scores. The dataset was then

causal SNPs included is plotted against the number of top SNPs selected on
the basis of ranked single-SNP inclusion probabilities. Proportions are aver-
aged over 500 datasets with 1500 SNPs. Case K: 5 is computationally intract-
able for CAVIARBF

analyzed with FINEMAP using 100 iterations and prior parameter
value of 5,21 = 0.052. Top panel of Figure 6 shows that the evidence
that rs356220 and rs7687945 are causal is the largest among all
SNPs. In addition, the causal configuration that simultaneously con-
tains both rs35 6220 and rs7687945 has the highest posterior prob-
ability (0.132). The second most probable (0.113) causal
configuration contains rs356220 and r52301134. High correlation
between rs7687945 and rs2301134 (1'2 = 0.974) explains why these
two SNPs are difficult to tell apart. We conclude that FINEMAP
was able to identify the complex association pattern at the second
SNP that only became identifiable after the first SNP was included
in the model. As opposed to the standard conditional analysis,
FINEMAP provides posterior probabilities for all SNPs in the region
and is thus able to simultaneously identify many causal variants
without a step-wise procedure.

5.4 15q21/LIPC association with high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol

Using single-SNP testing and conditional analysis, evidence for mul-
tiple independent association signals with high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol was found in the 15q21 region (Holmen et al., 2014;
Surakka et al., 2015 ). A conditional analysis using genotype data on
19 115 individuals from the National FINRISK study (Borodulin
et al., 2015 ) revealed three independent associations at rs2043085,
rs1800588 and rs113298164. We extracted a 6 megabase region
centered on r52043085 with 8612 polymorphic SNPs and pairwise
absolute correlations less than 0.99 from the original genotype data.
Single-SNP testing using a linear model implemented in SNPTEST
was performed to compute z-scores. The dataset was then analyzed
with FINEMAP using 100 iterations allowing for at most five causal
variants and prior parameter value of 5,21 = 0.052. Top panel of
Figure 7 shows that the functional lipid SNPs rs113298164 (mis-
sense variant, Durstenfeld et al., 1994) and rs1800588 (affecting
hepatic lipase activity, Deeb and Peng, 2000) are among the vari-
ants with largest evidence of being causal. R52043085 that had the
lowest P-value in single-SNP testing showed less evidence of being
causal than rs7350789 (r2 = 0.81). Indeed, there is substantial evi-
dence that the configuration from standard conditional analysis
(rs2043085, rs1800588 and rs113298164) is not the causal one; the

top 3 configurations from FINEMAP have between 50 and 190
times higher likelihood values. This demonstrates the importance of
jointly modeling the SNPs in the region. Given that FINEMAP com-
pletes in less than 30 5 (Intel Haswell E5-2690v3 processor running
at 2.6GHz) while the exhaustive search implemented in CAVIARBF
is estimated to run over 300 years on these data, this example dem-
onstrates the utility of FINEMAP as a tool to carry out future fine-
mapping analyses.

6 Discussion

GWAS have linked thousands of genomic regions to complex dis-
eases and traits in humans and in model organisms. Fine-mapping
causal variants in these regions is a high-dimensional variable selec-
tion problem complicated by strong correlations between the vari-
ables. We introduced a software package FINEMAP that
implements an important solution to the problem: a stochastic
search algorithm to circumvent computationally expensive exhaust-
ive search. In all datasets we have tested, FINEMAP achieves similar
accuracy as the exhaustive search but uses only a fraction of process-
ing time. For example, fine-mapping a genomic region with 8612
SNPs allowing for at most five causal variants completes in less than
30 s using FINEMAP while the exhaustive search implemented in

CAVIARBF is estimated to run over 300 years. Computationally ef-
ficient algorithms are a key to handle the ever-increasing amount of
genetic variation captured by emerging sequencing studies as well as
to scale up the analyses to whole chromosomes or even to whole
genomes.

FINEMAP uses a Shotgun Stochastic Search (SSS) algorithm
(Hans et al., 2007). SSS has been inspired by Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that are widely used for Bayesian infer-
ence. For a review on MCMC, see Andrieu et al. (2003). Standard
MCMC methods, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
(Hastings, 1970; Metropolis et al., 1953) and Gibbs sampler
(Geman and Geman, 1984), perform a sequence of steps in the par-
ameter space via a stochastic transition mechanism that ensures a
valid approximation to the target distribution. MCMC can often
quickly reach an interesting region of the parameter space, but, at
each step, it only considers one of the possible neighboring states.
This means that MCMC is often slow to explore a high-dimensional
state space. To improve on this, SSS generates a whole set of neigh-
boring configurations at each iteration and saves them all for further
use in probability calculations. This way a large number of param-
eter configurations with relatively high probability is quickly
explored.

FINEMAP is accurate when the set of causal configurations
explored captures a large majority of the total posterior probability.
Our results show that this is the case in all datasets we have tested:
the maximal error in any single-SNP inclusion probability is smaller
than 0.11 across all 2000 datasets of Scenario B. Using exhaustive
search, we observed in genomic regions with 750 SNPs of which five
were truly causal that on average only the top 123 (median = 14)
causal configurations out of all possible 70.3 X 106 already cover
95 % of the total posterior probability. (Similar results were also
observed for genomic regions with different numbers of SNPs.) This
explains why an efficient stochastic search can achieve accurate re-
sults in a tiny fraction of the processing time of an exhaustive search.
Our datasets were generated by requiring that the causal SNPs had
highly correlated proxies (absolute correlation greater than 0.5 )
among the other variants. The high accuracy of FINEMAP through-
out these tests makes us believe that FINEMAP is accurate in typical
GWAS data with complex correlation structure among the SNPs.

Although we have not encountered any dataset where FINEMAP
would not have performed well, theoretically, it remains possible
that an in-exhaustive search could miss some relevant causal config-
urations. A simple way to assess possible problems is to run many
searches in parallel and compare and combine their outcomes.
Another way is parallel tempering (Geyer, 1991) where several
searches are run in parallel in different ‘temperatures’. Intuitively,
increasing temperature flattens the likelihood function and hence a
search in a higher temperature moves around more freely than one
in a colder temperature. Such an approach, together with complex
global transition mechanisms to escape from local modes, was intro-
duced in an evolutionary stochastic search algorithm by Bottolo and
Richardson (2010) that was later tailored for genetic analyses of
multiple SNPs and multivariate phenotypes in the software package
GUESS (Bottolo et al., 2013). These two papers could give ideas
how FINEMAP could be further modified if trapping into local
modes of the search space were encountered in real data analyses of
GWAS regions.

Summary data based fine-mapping methods require a high-
quality correlation estimate. Ideally, the correlation matrix is com-
puted from the same genotype data from which the z—scores origin-
ate. In that case, for quantitative traits, the equations in Section 2.1
connecting original genotype-phenotype data and GWAS summary
data are exact and hence no information is lost by working with
summary data. For case-control data, a normal approximation to
the logistic likelihood causes some difference between the two
approaches but the difference is expected to be small with current
GWAS sample sizes (Pirinen et al., 2013). For some populations,
sequencing of many thousands of individuals have either already
been carried out or will complete soon. Such reference data allow re-
liable fine-mapping down to low-frequency variants also when the
original genotype data are not available. A more challenging prob-
lem is large meta-analyses that combine individuals from varying
ancestries. Assuming that the causal variants are included in the
data and have the same effect sizes across the ancestral backgrounds,
FINEMAP can be run with the sample size weighted SNP correl-
ation matrix. If these assumptions are not met, then a hierarchical
model allowing separate SNP correlation structures in each ancestry
would perform better (Kichaev and Pasaniuc, 2015 ).

Summary data based fine-mapping methods assume that the
causal variants are included in the data. Recent advances in z-score
imputation (Lee et al., 2013; Pasaniuc et al., 2014) help to satisfy
this requirement also when a causal variant might not be genotyped.
However, some SNPs are difficult to impute because they are not
tagged well by the SNPs in the data. We do not expect to capture

well the association signal from such SNPs either through imput-
ation or indirectly through other SNPs in the data.

The output from FINEMAP is a list of possible causal configur-
ations together with their posterior probabilities and Bayes factors
similar to CAVIARBF. These probabilities contain all the informa-
tion from the model needed for downstream analyses. Examples of
useful derived quantities are the single-SNP inclusion probabilities,
single-SNP Bayes factors, credible sets of causal variants (WTCCC
et al., 2012) and a regional Bayes factor to assess the evidence
against the null model where none of the SNPs are causal (Chen
et al., 2015 ). We believe that FINEMAP, or related future applica-
tions of shotgun stochastic search to GWAS summary data, enables
unprecedented opportunities to reveal valuable information that
could otherwise remain undetected due to computational limitations
of the existing fine-mapping methods.

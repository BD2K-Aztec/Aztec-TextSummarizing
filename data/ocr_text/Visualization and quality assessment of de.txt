ABSTRACT

Summary: Recent technological progress has greatly facilitated de
novo genome sequencing. However, de novo assemblies consist
in many pieces of contiguous sequence (contigs) arranged in
thousands of scaffolds instead of small numbers of chromosomes.
Confirming and improving the quality of such assemblies is critical
for subsequent analysis. We present a method to evaluate genome
scaffolding by aligning independently obtained transcriptome
sequences to the genome and visually summarizing the alignments
using the Cytoscape software. Applying this method to the genome
of the red fire ant Solenopsis invicta allowed us to identify
inconsistencies in 7%, confirm contig order in 20% and extend 16%
of scaffolds.

1 INTRODUCTION

De novo assemblies of eukaryotic genomes consist in many pieces
of contiguous sequence (contigs) arranged in thousands of scaffolds
instead of a few scaffolds corresponding to the chromosomes
(J ackman and Birol, 2010). Evaluating the qualities of such
assemblies is a major challenge, especially in emerging model
organisms that lack reference genomes. Independently obtained
mRNA or protein sequences, or pairs of sequences separated by
known genomic distances can be aligned to a genome assembly
to help assess its quality (Paszkiewicz and Studholme, 2010; Parra
et al., 2008). However, it is difﬁcult to systematically evaluate the
thousands or millions of resulting alignments.

ABySS—Explorer (Nielsen et al., 2009) provides a global view of a
genome assembly, but it displays only the information used to create
that assembly. Other visualization tools often display alignments of

individual sequences, but fail to provide genome—level overviews
(Nielsen et al., 2010; Supplementary Table 81).

We present an approach for genome quality assessment based on a
general visualization tool, Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003), which
is a popular platform to visualize and analyze molecular interaction
networks (Suderman and Hallett, 2007). Comeau et al. (2010)
examined synteny between metagenomic scaffolds using Cytoscape,
thus demonstrating its potential for visualizing genomic alignments.
Here, we show that Cytoscape can be used for visually representing
alignments between independently obtained mRNA sequences,
genome contigs and scaffolds. It allows rapid conﬁrmation of
intrascaffold connections between contigs and detection of possible
scaffold extensions and inconsistencies.

2 VISUALIZING TRANSCRIPT TO GENOME
CONSISTENCY

The exons of a transcript should align sequentially to a single
chromosomal region. However, in a fragmented assembly, different
parts of a transcript may align to multiple contigs or scaffolds. We
provide scripts that summarize such cases into overview ﬁles for
visualization with Cytoscape (Section 81 in Supplementary Material
provides details on how Cytoscape network ﬁles are generated
from genomic FASTA—format sequence and AGP—format scaffolding
information ﬁles). Visual inspection of these overviews can help to
conﬁrm contig order within scaffolds, extend scaffolds and identify
inconsistencies.

2.1 Conﬁrmation of contig connections

During genome assembly, contigs are ordered into scaffolds based
on pairs of sequences separated by known distances. Similarly,
transcripts that align to multiple contigs indicate which contigs
are adjacent. We simultaneously visualize information from both
sources; consistency conﬁrms when scaffolding is likely correct.

We applied this method to 22 685 contigs in 1978 scaffolds of
the recently assembled genome of the red ﬁre ant Solenopsis invicta
(Wurm et al., 2011; Section S2.A in Supplementary Material). We
identiﬁed 966 transcripts (87.7% of transcripts in the network) that
conﬁrmed the adjacencies of 1918 contigs within 399 scaffolds
(Section S2.C in Supplementary Material). Figure 1A illustrates that
the coordinates of alignments between transcripts (preﬁx e_) and
pairs of contigs (preﬁx g_c) are consistent with the adjacency and
orientation of these contigs within the corresponding three genomic
scaffolds (preﬁx g_s).

Fig. 1. Global alignment views in Cytoscape. (A) Contig—level: nodes represent scaffolded contigs, vertical dashes indicate contig adjacency according to
scaffolding information in the order indicated by an arrow, full lines connect nodes with common aligned transcripts. (B) Scaffold—level: nodes represent
scaffolds and unscaffolded contigs, full lines connect nodes with common aligned transcripts, zigzag lines indicate inconsistency between scaffolding and
transcript mapping information, arrows indicate merge (circle) and join cases (triangle, indicates order). In (A) and (B), node sizes are proportional to contig
and scaffold lengths, and line widths are proportional to transcript lengths. Line colors indicate mapping strands. Force—directed layout used in Cytoscape was

manually adjusted to ﬁt printing space constraints. (C) Legend.

2.2 Scaffold extension

Transcripts that align to different genomic scaffolds and/or
unscaffolded contigs suggest that these genomic sequences are
adjacent or that they should be merged because one ﬁlls one or more
gaps in the other. Our scripts determine the most likely solutions and
their feasibility based on sequence and gap lengths and alignment
coordinates. Relationships are then visually inspected.

We processed 1978 scaffolds and 67533 unscaffolded contigs
of the red ﬁre ant genome. We found 572 consistent transcript
alignments (87.6% of transcripts in the network) that connected
374 scaffolds and 577 unscaffolded contigs into 309 super—scaffolds
(Section S2.D in Supplementary Material). Figure 1B shows two
such super—scaffolds: two of the three scaffolds are likely adjacent
(triangle arrowheads) and 10 unscaffolded contigs likely ﬁll gaps
(circle arrowheads) within scaffolds.

2.3 Highlighting inconsistencies

Network topology allows identifying inconsistencies in both contig—
and scaffold—level networks. For example, contig g_c88686 in
Figure 1A is connected to three other contigs. The connections
to two of these contigs were inferred from paired reads during
scaffolding, and an additional link is deduced from transcript
e_i01474 alignment. The latter connection would lead to an
impossible overlap between the two scaffolds. This problem is
highlighted by a zigzag line with triangular arrows in Figure 1B
(more details in Section S2 in Supplementary Material).

3 CONCLUSIONS

This approach allows systematic evaluation of genome assemblies’
quality, and thus could be useful for large—scale sequencing projects
such as the i5K initiative (Robinson et al., 2011).

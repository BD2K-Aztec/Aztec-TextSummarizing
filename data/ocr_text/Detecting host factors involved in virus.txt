ABSTRACT

Motivation: Detecting human proteins that are involved in virus
entry and replication is facilitated by modern high-throughput RNAi
screening technology. However, hit lists from different laboratories
have shown only little consistency. This may be caused by not only
experimental discrepancies, but also not fully explored possibilities of
the data analysis. We wanted to improve reliability of such screens by
combining a population analysis of infected cells with an established
dye intensity readout.

Results: Viral infection is mainly spread by cell—cell contacts and
clustering of infected cells can be observed during spreading of the
infection in situ and in vivo. We employed this clustering feature to
define knockdowns which harm viral infection efficiency of human
Hepatitis C Virus. Images of knocked down cells for 719 human
kinase genes were analyzed with an established point pattern
analysis method (Ripley’s K -function) to detect knockdowns in which
virally infected cells did not show any clustering and therefore were
hindered to spread their infection to their neighboring cells. The
results were compared with a statistical analysis using a common
intensity readout of the GFP-expressing viruses and a luciferase-
based secondary screen yielding five promising host factors which
may suit as potential targets for drug therapy.

Conclusion: We report of an alternative method for high-throughput
imaging methods to detect host factors being relevant for the
infection efficiency of viruses. The method is generic and has the
potential to be used for a large variety of different viruses and
treatments being screened by imaging techniques.

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite many remarkable discoveries in virology, viruses are still
a major cause of severe diseases including Dengue fever, hepatitis,
immune deﬁciency and severe inﬂuenza. Viruses employ speciﬁc
human host proteins (host factors) for each step of their ‘life’ cycle
(Carter and Ehrlich, 2008; Malim and Emerman, 2008; Martin
and Sattentau, 2009). Discovering these host factors may not only
unravel fundamental principals of viral modes of operation, like their
replication, but also, notably, may lead to promising drug therapies

which are not affected by the high mutational variability in viral
populations. Fluorescence microscopy imaging of RNA interference
(RNAi) knockdown screens has become a major method of choice
to identify the function of the proteins corresponding to the silenced
genes and speciﬁcally to detect potential drug targets. Typically,
these screens are based on endpoint assays of transfected cells with
a direct intensity readout (Boutros et al., 2004). More recently,
large—scale imaging has been used to study the transfected cells
(Neumann et al., 2006; Nir et al., 2010). Image analysis software
was developed to segment cells and extract cellular texture features
enabling machine learning methods to identify subcellular location
(Conrad et al., 2004; Peng et al., 2010) and to classify the mitotic
phase of imaged cells (Carpenter et al., 2006; Harder et al., 2006;
Jones et al., 2008; Lamprecht et al., 2007; Neumann et al., 2010;
Vokes and Carpenter, 2008). For HIV, three such genome wide
knock—down studies have been performed (Brass et al., 2008; Konig
et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2008). However, there was only little overlap
in the predicted host factors reducing the infection. This discrepancy
might be due to differences in the experimental conditions like
using different viral strains, investigating different time intervals
or using different silencing sequences. In addition, it may have also
resulted from incomplete data analysis. Therefore, we developed
an alternative approach to detect host factors with such a screening
method.

Viruses can spread within the host by release of cell—free virions or
direct passage between infected and non—infected cells. In general,
direct cell—cell transfer is considerably more efﬁcient than a cell—
free transfer (Timpe et al., 2008) and is supported by ﬁlopodial
bridges (Sherer et al., 2007). As a consequence of such a viral cell—
cell spreading, clusters of infected cells may be formed. It was
reported recently that spatial distribution of cells can inﬂuence
the infection behavior. Snijder and co—workers observed intriguing
relationships between virus species, the spatial distribution of cells
and the infection rate. While the infection efﬁciency of a rotavirus
was considerably increased in sparse populations, Dengue viruses
mainly employed cells located at edges of islets, and murine hepatitis
viruses were preferably found in dense cell populations (Snijder
et al., 2009). To analyze such clustering patterns systematically,
statistical methods for point pattern analysis can be employed.
Ripley’s K—function is an established measure for deﬁning the
degree of clustering. It evaluates all interparticle distances over
the studied area and compares the observed distribution with a
random distribution of spots. Ripley’s K—function has been used
in ecology, epidemiology and geography (Ersboll and Ersboll,
2009). In cell biology, it was applied to study integrin—sensing

extracellular matrix properties (Paszek et al., 2009) and to analyze
lipid rafts by observing clustering of RAS proteins (Prior et al.,
2003).

In our study, we investigated HCV infection in a human hepatoma
cell line to detect human host factors that are necessary for virus
replication. We employed the RNA interference technology and
screened a comprehensive set of 719 kinases expressing genes.
We tracked the infection efﬁciency by ﬂuorescence imaging of
cells infected with GFP—expressing viruses. Three bioinformatics
approaches were applied to yield host factors that signiﬁcantly
reduce infection efﬁciency. We employed (i) a statistical method
described recently using B—score and Z—score normalization of
intensity read—outs of segmented cell images (Brideau et al., 2003),
(ii) intensity read—outs of a luciferase based secondary screen and
(iii) our new application of the point pattern analysis method. The
idea of this approach bases on the observation that reduced virus
replication results in a reduced grouping (clustering) of infected
cells. For each knockdown, we compared the clustering of infected
cells and non—infected cells and estimated a reduction of clustering
of the infected cells. We yielded 30 promising candidates suiting
as potential host factors for therapeutical drug targeting, ﬁve out of
which were found with all three methods comprising CD81, PI4KA,
CSNK2A1, SLAMF6 and FLT4.

2 METHODS

2.1 Experimental setup

The siRNA library used for the primary screen in this study was purchased
from Ambion (Silencer® Human Kinase siRNA Library V3 (AM80010V3)).
Reverse transfection of siRNAs into Huh7.5 cells (Blight et al., 2002)
in a LabTek format was optimized according to a previously described
protocol (Erﬂe et al., 2007). Overall, 2157 siRNAs targeting 719 human
kinase genes plus positive controls targeting the entry receptor CD81 or
the viral genome itself (HCV321 and HCV138) and four different negative
controls (non—silencing siRNA) were spotted in transfection mixture onto
LabTeks. After seeding of Huh7.5 cells we allowed siRNA silencing for
36 h. Cells were infected with a HCV GFP reporter virus, ﬁxed 36h later
and immunostained with a GFP—speciﬁc antibody. Cell arrays were imaged
with a scanning microscope (ScanAR, Olympus Biosystems) using 10X
objective (Olympus, cat. no. UPSLAPO 10x) and images were analyzed
with an image analysis method (see Section 2.2). The primary screen was
conducted in 12 repetitions. All images with less than 125 or more than
500 cells within siRNA spots were excluded from the analysis. As an
additional quality control for staining artefacts all images were analyzed by
eye resulting in an overall exclusion of 15% of the images. Then statistical
analysis was performed to compute a mean z—score and a P—value for
each gene (see Section 2.5). During validation of the 178 gene candidates
selected from the primary screen, three independent siRNAs per gene were
used to minimize the number of potential off—target hits. In addition, the
format of the assay was changed to a statistically more robust 96—well
plate format to increase the number of transfected cells per siRNA and
thus statistical power (about 300 cells in the LabTek format but about
10 000 in this well—based assay). The method of solid phase reverse siRNA
transfection was adapted to the 96—well plate format as described elsewhere
(Erﬂe et al., 2008). This assay format allowed to use a luciferase reporter
virus facilitating the analysis of the screen. To validate effects of kinase
knockdowns on HCV entry and replication 5 x 103 Huh7.5FLuc cells (stably
expressing ﬁreﬂy luciferase) were seeded per siRNA—coated well of a
96—well plate. After 36 h, cells were infected with a HCV renilla luciferase
reporter virus. Forty—eight hours post—infection cells were harvested and the
ﬁreﬂy luciferase and renilla luciferase activities measured. The secondary

screen was performed twice in duplicates and statistically analyzed (see
Section 2.5).

2.2 Image analysis and quality assessment

To analyze the images of the siRNA screen, an automated system was
employed which was described in detail recently (Matula et al., 2009).
Brieﬂy, the inputs of this system consisted of two dye channel images from a
chamber plate with printed siRNA spots. The ﬂuorescence signals originated
from DAPI stained cell nuclei (1St channel) and GFP incorporated into the
viral strain (2nCl channel). In the DAPI channel, single—cell nuclei were
segmented using an edge—based approach based on combining responses
of the gradient magnitude and the Laplacian of Gaussian ﬁlters with
morphological closing and hole ﬁlling operators. Cell nuclei were identiﬁed
among the segmented objects by applying size, intensity and circularity
criteria. The viral protein production level (virus signal) of each cell
was computed by the mean intensity in channel 2 inside the nucleus
neighborhood. Positive and negative controls had been spotted on each
plate. In positive controls, the siRNAs hindered viral protein production
resulting in a low virus signal, whereas in negative controls virus replication
was not altered. According to the virus signal, cells were classiﬁed as
infected and non—infected using a threshold. Cells with a virus signal less
than the threshold were classiﬁed as non—infected, otherwise as infected.
The threshold was deﬁned by maximizing the difference in infection rates
between positive and negative controls. Quality ﬁltering was performed
eliminating out—of—focus images and image artifacts. On the single image
level, images were automatically classiﬁed as low quality if they contained
too few or too many cells or if they were out—of—focus. On the whole plate
level, the percentage of saturated pixels in channel 2 was computed. Plates
which showed over—exposure were scanned again with decreased exposure
times (Matula et 01., 2009).

2.3 Ripley’s K -function

The distribution of cells on ﬂuorescence microscopy images was represented
as a spatial pattern of spots. Spots (cells) were classiﬁed as infected and non—
infected and their respective clustering behavior studied using the K —function
as described elsewhere (Ripley, 1977). K is calculated by

IN N 1 Mall-j)

for a given radius parameter r > 0. N is the number of spots in the observed
area A (whole image), A is the intensity of spots which can be estimated by
N /A, dl‘j is the (Euclidean) distance between spot i and j. Ir(d,-j) equals to
one if dij < r and is zero otherwise. The weighting factor w(x,-, dl-j) copes for
edge effects and is the proportion of the circumference of a circle with center
x,- and distance dl‘j that falls in the studied area. If the circle is entirely inside
the studied area, it equals to one.

Ripley’s K—function is used to compare the observed spot distribution
with a random distribution. The given spot distribution is tested against
the null hypothesis that the spots are randomly distributed. For clustering
distributions, the expected value of K (r) is larger than the value of a random
distribution, for regular patterns it is less than for a random distribution
(examples are given in the Supplementary Material S1). To cope for biases
caused by clustering of proliferating cells, we derived the random distribution
by using the actual positions of the spots of infected and non—infected
cells. The sth simulated null—hypothesis of the K—function was estimated
by randomly drawing NC spots from all spots (infected and non—infected
cells) and applying them to the K —functi0n. The ﬁnal null—hypothesis was
calculated from the mean value of these simulated K —functions (5 = l . . . 100).
Applying Ripley’s K —function to spot distributions with local spatial variation
(independent from their clustering), the inhomogeneous K —function was
deﬁned by Baddeley and co—workers (Baddeley et al., 2000) which we used

|A| denotes the observation area (distance 5 r), eij is the edge—correction
factor calculated by the border method (Ripley, 1981). My) and Myj) are
estimated intensities at spots y,- and yj. They were estimated by a Gaussian
kernel smoother using the intensity surface model (Baddeley et al., 2000).
The maximum ranges of the radius r we investigated were 25%, 30%, 35%
and 40% of the shorter side of the whole image. To get the clustering
score, the area between the curves of the inhomogeneous K —function and
a simulated random distribution was calculated. The score was positive if
the curve for the inhomogeneous K —function was mainly above the curve
of the simulated random distribution (tendency for clustering), and negative
otherwise. This score was calculated for infected and non—infected cells,
respectively, using the function Kinhom from the library Spatstat of the R
package (www.r—project.org, version 2.8.0). To obtain the ﬁnal clustering
score for estimating the infection rate, the score of the infected cells was
subtracted by the score of the non—infected cells.

2.4 Quadrat analysis

Quadrat analysis observes the frequency distribution of cells within a set of
grid squares (quadrat) (Wong and Lee, 2005). The mean number of cells per
quadrat is estimated and its variance computed to obtain the variance—mean
ratio (VMR) as a measure for clustering of points, i.e.

, (3)

m -_—2
5222M, (4)

m is the number of quadrats, x,- is the number of points in quadrat i and 5c is
the mean of the number of points per quadrat. VMR greater than one indicates
a clustered distribution, VMR less than one indicates a random distribution
and VMR = 0 a uniform distribution. To obtain the ﬁnal clustering score, we
subtracted VMR of the non—infected cells from VMR of the infected cells. The
clustering score was calculated for all knocked down genes and the controls
and a z—normalization was performed.

2.5 Identiﬁcation of host siRNA hits

Statistical analysis of processed imaging data was carried out in R using the
Bioconductor packages RNAither (Rieber et al., 2009) and cellHTS (Boutros
et al., 2006). For the primary screen, we excluded wells with less than 125
and more than 500 cells. For the secondary screen, wells showing the lowest
5% and highest 5% of ﬁreﬂy reporter activity (correlated to the number of
viable cells) were excluded. Those wells were excluded to eliminate possible
interference of cytostatic or cytotoxic effects or high variability in cell
number with the readout of viral replication. As well, in some wells, cells may
have grown densely and possible incorrect segmentation of images may have
occurred (Bdmer et al., 2009). Virus—speciﬁc signal intensities per siRNA
were normalized for effects of differing cell counts using locally weighted
scatterplot smoothing (Cleveland, 1979). B—score normalization was used
to remove spatial effects within individual LabTeks (Brideau et al., 2003).
Variability between plates was addressed by subtracting the plate median
from each measurement per siRNA and dividing by the plate median absolute
deviation (10) resulting in one z—score per siRNA per LabTek. Replicates
were summarized using the mean z—score; furthermore, Student’s t—tests were
carried out to determine whether siRNA effects differed signiﬁcantly from
zero. Only hits with negative z—scores were taken. For all three analyses
(primary screen, secondary screen and clustering analysis), hits were selected
if their P—values were <0.05.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Parameter optimization, choice of the most suitable
clustering analysis method and assembling
signiﬁcant hits

We identiﬁed cellular protein kinases involved in HCV replication
by observing replication and clustering of the infected cells upon
silencing of protein kinases (2157 siRNAs targeted 719 human
protein kinase genes). Virus—infected cells were identiﬁed by viral
GFP expression observed with ﬂuorescence microscopy analysis.
Host siRNA hits were identiﬁed by three different approaches,
(i) using viral GFP ﬂuorescence intensity of the primary screen,
(ii) luciferase intensity of the secondary screen and (iii) the clustering
analysis method. For the clustering analysis method, we computed
a z—transformed clustering score for all knockdowns. We analyzed
the clustering of infected cells using the DAPI channel (nucleus
staining) for deﬁning the center of mass and the viral GFP signal
for labeling the cells as infected and non—infected. Low clustering
scores were yielded if the infected cells did not cluster, while
high values resulted if speciﬁcally the infected cells showed a
high clustering. This is demonstrated exemplarin in Figure 1. For
Ripley’s K —function, we optimized the performance by varying
the range of radius. As the objective function, we analyzed the
correlation of the z—scores from Ripley’s K —function for all knocked
down genes with the z—scores from the intensity readout of the
primary screen and secondary screen. Table 1 shows the results.
The best correlation to the primary screen was 0.55 using a radius
range of 35%. We investigated the performance of a well established
clustering analysis method, the Quadrat Analysis (Wong and Lee,
2005). However, the method showed less correlation to the intensity
readouts (Supplementary Table S2 shows the results for several
parameter settings).

Also, the homogeneous K —function was inferior to the
inhomogenous K —function (result with the best range of radius is
given in Table 1). In the following, we report results using the
inhomogenous K —function with the optimized parameter (radius
range = 35 %). Knockdown of gene CD81 (positive control) resulted
in low clustering of the infected cells, while the negative control
(non—silencing siRNAs) showed a comparably high tendency for
infected cells (black dots) to cluster. The clustering scores were
—2.3 and 2.2 for CD81 and the negative control, respectively. For the
primary screen, mean intensities of viral GFP was calculated for each
knockdown and replicate (12 replicates), their z—scores computed in
respect to the bulk of the data, and genes with signiﬁcant low z—scores
selected (P < 0.05). Similarly, signiﬁcant genes were deﬁned from
the secondary screen. The difference of z—score distributions of
the positive control (CD81) and the negative controls is shown
in Figure 2. The separation of distributions shows CD81 as a
signiﬁcant down regulator in all three approaches (primary screen,
secondary screen and clustering analysis method). The numbers of
signiﬁcant hits and their intersections are summarized in Figure 3.
Observing viral signal intensities in the primary screen yielded
85 signiﬁcant genes. A total of 178 genes selected from the
primary screen were observed with the secondary screen yielding 64
signiﬁcant genes. The clustering analysis method yielded 30 genes
(shown in Supplementary Table S3). All three positive controls
showed signiﬁcantly low clustering scores (CD81: P=6.61E—
07; HCV—321: P=1.53E—13; HCV—138: P=1.20E—10). Five genes
were signiﬁcant in all three methods comprising CD81, PI4KA,

Fig. 1. Images of a positive (knockdown of CD81) and a negative control
(non—silencing siRNA). Knocking down CD81 resulted in a rather random
distribution of infected cells (black dots), while infected cells were highly
clustered when no gene was silenced (unhindered viral replication).

CSNK2A1, SLAMF6 and FLT—4 (Table 2). Note that the positive
controls HCV—321 and HCV—138 were not used in the secondary
screen. CD81 was used as a positive control. It is well known as a
viral receptor of HCV (Zhang et al., 2004) and involved in HCV
entry (Randall et al., 2007).

3.2 Functional interpretation of the results

Besides CD81 we detected four host factors being signiﬁcant in
all three analysis approaches (PI4KA, CSNK2A1, SLAMF—6 and
FLT—4). Phosphatidylinositol 4—kinase—or (PI4KA) is well known to
be required for HCV replication (Berger et al., 2009; Borawski
et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Tai et al., 2009; Trotard et al.,
2009; Vaillancourt et al., 2009). It was shown in vitro that Casein
kinase II (CSNK2A1 is coding its subunit alpha) phosphorylates the
non—structural HCV protein NSSA (Kim et al., 1999). Fms—related

tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT—4) is also known as vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR—3). It is a member of the tyrosine
kinase receptor family. Over—expression of the short splice variant of
VEGFR—3 stimulated cell growth in HepG2 cells (Lian et al., 2007)
which may advantage infectious spreading of the virus. Interestingly,
a retrovirus was found to be integrated into an intron of FLT—4 in
the genome which may have resulted in an evolutionary advantage
of this virus (Hughes, 2001). SLAMF—6 belongs to the signaling
lymphocytic activation molecule family and is a transmembrane
receptor mainly expressed in natural killer (NKT) cells. The receptor
serves as a docking site for several signaling molecules (Engel et al.,
2003; Veillette, 2006). It was shown that SLAMF—l and SLAMF—6
critically control the characteristic expansion and differentiation of
NKT cells after thymic selection (Griewank et al., 2007). SLAMF—
6 may suit as an interesting candidate for investigating uptake and
signal propagation of the virus during its entry into the host cell.

3.3 Comparing the clustering behavior of HCV and the
dengue virus infection

The same experimental set—up as for HCV was also applied
to observe cells infected with the dengue virus (DV) (Matula
et al., 2009). It is known that DV infects edges of islets of
cell populations rather than forming clusters of infections (Snijder
et al., 2009). We observed this behavior also in our data which is
shown exemplarily in the Supplementary Material (Supplementary
Fig. S4). We compared the clustering scores for non—silencing siRNA
images of both datasets and observed signiﬁcantly higher clustering
scores for cells with HCV infection (P = 4.8E—4, Wilcoxon test, see
Supplementary Fig. S4 for the distribution of all scores for both data
sets).

4 DISCUSSION

We applied an image processing analysis, a clustering analysis
method and statistical analyses of intensity readouts to detect host
factors involved in HCV infection. Instead of observing knockdowns
of viral components, we focused on speciﬁc proteins in the host
cell. Targeting host factors which are relevant to viral replication
showed distinct lower clustering of the infected cells. Speciﬁcally,
all three positive controls showed signiﬁcantly low clustering
scores. Additionally, we got hits having signiﬁcantly low viral GFP
intensities observed in the primary screen and hits from a secondary

screen based on a luciferase read—out. Computing the intersection of
hits from all three approaches yielded ﬁve genes to be considered
as attractive targets against HCV infection.

Besides two well—known host factors being relevant for HCV
replication (CD81 and PI4KA) and one host factor which has been
described to phosphorylate an HCV protein, we also found two new
challenging candidates (FLT—4 and SLAMF—6). FLT—4 has interesting
characteristics. It was observed that it suited for a retrovirus to
be genomically incorporated (Hughes, 2001). Even though known
virulence principles of HCV and retroviruses are very different,
such a mechanism may have similar advantages for replication
of HCV as for the evolutionary beneﬁts of the retrovirus. To
measure clustering, we used the inhomogeneous Ripley’s K —function
which has been used in a broad variety of scientiﬁc applications
ranging from the clustering behavior of infected habitants in a
country (Ersboll and Ersboll, 2009) to cell biological concerns as
e. g. studying the clustering of integrins when cells sense the extra
cellular matrix (Paszek et al., 2009). We used Ripley’s K —function
now for observing the clustering behavior of individual infected
cells in a cellular in vitro assay. With such a clustering analysis
method we were able to track infection populations in a systematic
way and used it to support ﬁnding crucial host factors for viral
replication. Besides applying Ripley’s K —function to detect relevant
host factors as shown in this study, it additionally may be applied to
systematically investigate the infection behavior of different virus
families. Snijder and co—workers observed principal differences of
virus entities to populate cell samples (Snij der et al., 2009). Ripley’s
K —function may be used to follow up this study by a quantitative
clustering analysis supporting putting up a taxonomy for virus strains
based on their population characteristics in the host. It is known
e.g. that the Dengue virus infects edges of islets in cell colonies
and therefore does not exhibit such a clustering tendency as HCV
(Snijder et al., 2009). In an initial trial, we observed distinct higher
clustering scores for cells infected by HCV in comparison to cells
infected by the Dengue virus.

Applying a clustering analysis method for estimating the virulence
in cellular assays is general and can be used for other screens to
observe infectious propagation in cellular populations. It may also
be used for a quantitative and systematic analysis of the speciﬁc
spreading and populating behavior of distinct virus families which
may also have an impact on the discovery of their speciﬁc use of
host factors.

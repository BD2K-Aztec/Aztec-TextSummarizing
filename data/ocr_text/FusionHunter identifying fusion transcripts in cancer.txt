ABSTRACT

Motivation: Fusion transcripts can be created as a result of genome
rearrangement in cancer. Some of them play important roles in
carcinogenesis, and can serve as diagnostic and therapeutic targets.
With more and more cancer genomes being sequenced by next-
generation sequencing technologies, we believe an efficient tool
for reliably identifying fusion transcripts will be desirable for many
groups.

Results: We designed and implemented an open-source software
tool, called FusionHunter, which reliably identifies fusion transcripts
from transcriptional analysis of paired-end RNA-seq. We show that
FusionHunter can accurately detect fusions that were previously
confirmed by RT-PCR in a publicly available dataset. The purpose of
FusionHunter is to identify potential fusions with high sensitivity and
specificity and to guide further functional validation in the laboratory.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the key features observed when analyzing cancer genomes is
the chromosomal abnormality. Genome arrangements could result
in aberrant fusion genes, and a number of them have been found to
play important roles in carcinogenesis. Different functional fusion
genes have been detected in both hematological malignancies and
solid tumors (Mitelman et al., 2007). Precisely identifying these
fusion genes is important for developing potential diagnostic and
therapeutic targets.

Recently, RNA—seq has proven to be a valuable tool for
transcriptome proﬁling based upon ultra high—throughput next—
generation sequencing technologies. It has been shown that RNA—
seq is a more accurate method to survey the entire transcriptome
in a quantitative and high—throughput fashion than microarray
technology and EST sequencing (Wang et al., 2009). RNA—seq can
provide a great deal of information about genome wide transcription,
including the identiﬁcation of fusion genes in cancer. A number
of novel fusion genes has been identiﬁed using single—end RNA—
seq reads (Maher et al., 2009b) and paired—end RNA—seq reads

(Berger et al., 2010; Maher et al., 2009a). The advantage of paired—
end technology is that it provides a more reliable way to uncover
breakpoints when comparing two genomes.

However, although a computational pipeline that identiﬁes fusion
transcripts using RNA—seq has been mentioned in a number of
recently published cancer transcriptomic studies (Berger et al., 2010;
Maher et al., 2009a,b), there was no publicly accessible, open—
source software available until a recently published tool named
FusionSeq (Sboner et al., 2010). With more and more cancer
transcriptomes being sequenced by next— generation sequencing, we
believe an efﬁcient tool for reliably identifying fusion transcripts
will be desirable for many groups. Here, we describe an open—
source software tool, called FusionHunter, that identiﬁes fusion
transcripts in cancer, using reads from paired—end RNA—seq. This
high—throughput software tool is designed for efﬁcient and precise
detection of fusion transcripts in cancer for further functional
validation in the laboratory.

2 METHODS

(i) Map the RNA—seq reads to the reference genome: currently, the input
of FusionHunter should be paired—end RNA—seq reads. These original reads
(e.g. 50mers) are uniquely mapped to the reference human genome using
Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009). One strength of our tool is that it has the
option to deﬁne transcript fragments without relying on known annotations
in order to ﬁnd novel transcripts [see Fig. 1A]: we ﬁrst identify potential
exons by clustering reads together; and then we further group exons into
potential transcript fragments. However, in our implementation, we include
the annotation from UCSC known genes to make the results more reliable.
(ii) Find candidate fusions: we call a candidate fusion if two transcripts
are both enriched by input RNA—seq reads and the linkage between them
is supported (encompassed) by at least two independent paired—end reads.
However, even though we require unique mapping for the original RNA—
seq reads, there will still be unreliable mappings that may introduce false
positives. This is mainly due to duplications in the human genome. Figure 1B
illustrates such a situation. We have a read pair with reads F and R. The correct
mapping of F and R should be located in A. But R could be mapped to A’s
homolog B, possibly due to sequencing errors on the 3/ end of R. This will
mistakenly link A and B together as a candidate fusion transcript. To resolve
this problem, we look at the self—alignment of the human genome and the
logic is similar to the idea of excluding fusions between homologous regions
in Hu et al. (2010). If a candidate fusion transcript consists of two genes that
share signiﬁcant homology, it will be removed. After this ﬁltering, we create
a ‘pseudo reference’ for each candidate. Brieﬂy, if we have paired—end reads
supporting a fusion between genes A and B, we ﬁrst determine the relative
order of them (i.e. A B or A —B or —A B or —A —B). Then, we make a ‘pseudo
reference’ by concatenating sequences of A and B according to their relative
order (e. g. if the order is A —B, we concatenate the reverse complement of B

to the end of A). We create such a pseudo reference for each candidate. All
the subsequent analysis on these pseudo references can be run in parallel to
make it more efﬁcient.

(iii) Identify fusion junction spanning reads: based on the pseudo reference of
each candidate region, we also want to ﬁnd RNA—seq reads that precisely span
the fusion junction. This serves as another criteria to reduce false positives
from the previous step and the junction spanning reads provide strong support
for fusion events. We implemented a gapped alignment method similar to
the algorithms described by previously published works (Au et al., 2010;
Wang et al., 2010) to detect fusion spanning reads. For a 50 bp read, which
cannot be aligned to the pseudo reference, FusionHunter splits it into two
25 bp segments. One of these segments, which we call the ‘anchor’, would
have an alignment on the pseudo reference if the original read is junction
spanning. Currently, we assume that each read can span two exons at most.
As shown in Figure 1C, FusionHunter then tries to extend the anchor till it
reaches a canonical splicing signal (Burset et al., 2000), and search alignment
for the remainder of the original read on the pseudo reference. Since we will
obtain many candidate regions from the previous step, this gapped alignment
procedure utilizes a multi—core approach to speed up, where the number of
total threads could be conﬁgured by the users. The output of the gapped
alignment is in the SAM format.

(iv) Report fusion transcripts: based on the SAM ﬁle produced in the previous
step, an RNA—seq read is categorized as a fusion spanning read if it is split
(referring to the ‘CIGAR’ column of the SAM ﬁle) into two alignments
to different genes in the candidate region (pseudo reference). A fusion is
reported if at least one read spanning the fusion boundary has been found.
To reduce false positives, we discard junction spanning reads with less than
6 bp matches on either gene. We remove potential PCR artifacts by retaining
only one read for each mapping co—ordinate on the reference, and we require
candidate fusions that are supported by only one junction spanning read
to originate from annotated splice sites. For each detected fusion, names
and co—ordinates of both genes in the human reference (hg18), numbers
of fusion encompassing and spanning paired—end RNA—seq reads, are all
represented in the ﬁnal output. Sequences of reads spanning fusions are
presented with a gap where the fusion junction lies. In addition to reporting
fusions, FusionHunter also reports read—through events, in which two nearby

genes (within 600 kb and separated by at most one gene) are co—transcribed
in the same orientation. Since many of the read—through events have already
annotated by human Expressed Sequence Tags (EST), FusionHunter only
reports novel read—throughs that are not shown in human EST database.

3 RESULTS

Implementation and running time: major components in
FusionHunter were implemented in C and C++. Perl scripts
were used to wrap different parts into a pipeline. In the current
version of FusionHunter, we require the users to install Bowtie
which is freely available. For a sample of 30 million reads, it takes
1—2h to align reads using Bowtie and 0.5—1h for downstream
processes, using computers with 16 cores.

Au et al. (2010) datasets: we ran FusionHunter on the RNA—seq
sample from normal human brain tissue from Au et al. (2010), which
serves as a control. FusionHunter did not report any fusion events.

Berger et al. (2010) datasets: Berger et al. (2010) validated 11
novel gene fusions through RT—PCR from ten melanoma samples.
We downloaded the raw RNA—seq reads of these samples used in
their study from NCBI and ran FusionHunter on these datasets.
FusionHunter predicted 11 fusions and all of them were validated
by Berger et al. (2010). This shows that fusion predictions
of FusionHunter are reliable. Details of the results are in the
Supplement. In addition, we also predicted 13 read—through events
and ﬁve of them overlapped with 12 read—throughs predicted in
Berger et al. (2010). We did not perform detailed comparison for
read—throughs, because Berger et al. (2010) did not validate the
read—through predictions.

4 DISCUSSION

Recently, several works have been published to detect splice
junctions and chimeric transcripts based on RNA—seq, including

FusionSeq, MapSplice (Wang et al., 2010) and SplitSeek (Ameur
et al., 2010). FusionSeq reports fusion events as well as their
quality scores. The methodology of how FusionSeq detects fusion
junctions is different from FusionHunter. FusionSeq splits exonic
sequences from two candidate fusion genes into a large number
of short ‘tiles’ and merges all possible pairs to create a ‘fusion
junction library’. Then, it tries to align candidate fusion junction
reads against the junction library using Bowtie. This process is
less efﬁcient since the fusion junction library is normally quite
large. Also, FusionSeq considers only annotated exons and may
miss events on novel exons. MapSplice and SplitSeek are tools
designed to align RNA—seq reads to splice junctions. They can
potentially be used to identify long—range chimeric splicing events,
although the tools were not designed for efﬁcient and reliable
detection of fusion transcripts. There is also a very recent method
that aims to detect fusions more sensitively utilizing ambiguously
mapping of RNA—seq read pairs (Kinsella et al., 2011). A number of
improvements can be employed to further aid in the identiﬁcation
of true fusion genes. For example, by comparing the breakpoints
identiﬁed from RNA—seq reads and genomic DNA reads, we will be
able to know whether the fusion genes detected in the transcriptome
are caused by rearrangements at the genomic level or by other
mechanisms (e. g. trans—splicing). Future versions of FusionHunter
will accomplish this by incorporating paired—end/mate—pair reads
from whole— genome DNA sequencing.

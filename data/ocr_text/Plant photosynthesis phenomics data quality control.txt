Abstract

Motivation: Plant phenomics, the collection of large—scale plant phenotype data, is growing
exponentially. The resources have become essential component of modern plant science.
Such complex datasets are critical for understanding the mechanisms governing energy intake
and storage in plants, and this is essential for improving crop productivity. However, a major issue
facing these efforts is the determination of the quality of phenotypic data. Automated methods
are needed to identify and characterize alterations caused by system errors, all of which are difficult
to remove in the data collection step and distinguish them from more interesting cases of altered
biological responses.

Results: As a step towards solving this problem, we have developed a coarse—to—refined model
called dynamic filter to identify abnormalities in plant photosynthesis phenotype data by compar—
ing light responses of photosynthesis using a simplified kinetic model of photosynthesis. Dynamic
filter employs an expectation—maximization process to adjust the kinetic model in coarse and
refined regions to identify both abnormalities and biological outliers. The experimental results
show that our algorithm can effectively identify most of the abnormalities in both real and synthetic
datasets.

1 Introduction

Plants capture sunlight to fiX C02 into energy rich molecules, thus
supplying our ecosystem with OZ and essentially all of its biological
energy, including 100% of our food. Recent work has focused on
improving the efficiency of photosynthesis to meet our growing
needs for food and fuel (Bonner, 1962; Kramer and Evans, 2011;
Von Caemmerer and Farquhar, 1981). To develop efficiency—
boosting mechanisms that reduce energy losses or enhance C02
delivery to cells during photosynthesis, advanced technologies in
high-throughput plant photosynthetic phenotyping and pheno—
informatics have been developed (Cruz et 61]., 2014; Houle et 61].,
2010; Tessmer et 61]., 2013; Zhu et 61]., 2010). These technologies

have allowed plant photosynthesis phenotypic variability to be char—
acterized and to be related to putative biological functions, leading
to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control
photosynthetic properties under various environmental conditions.
Plant phenomics is a first—class asset for understanding the mechan—
isms regulating energy intake in plants (Fiorani and Schurr, 2013;
Rascher et 61]., 2011).

Plant phenotyping systems monitor photosynthetic performance
for many plants both continuously and simultaneously. Phenomics
datasets are large and continue to grow as we increase duration
of sampling and resolution. Yet despite the size and richness of the
data, small clusters of erroneous values, which give the appearance

of real differences in biological responses, can skew the analysis
towards an invalid interpretation (Herbert et 61]., 2004). There are
several ways in which a measurement can be in error: errors origi-
nating from instrumentation malfunctions, biased values from mis—
calibrated sensors and inevitable errors of precision. All these issues
compromise the downstream data analysis tasks. Given the value of
clean data for any operation, the ability to improve data quality is
a key requirement for effective knowledge mining from large-scale
phenotype data.

In this article, we focus on data abnormalities detection, which is
a type of measurement errorto demonstrate how clean phenotype
data can be obtained. Similar to sensor data, abnormalities in plant
phenotype data deviate significantly from expected patterns and are
visible outliers in the whole dataset (Shanahan, 2005 ; Subramaniam
et 61]., 2006). The majority of abnormalities in plant phenotyping
originate from instrumentation malfunctions (e.g. loss of sensor
synchronization during measurement) or non—biological statistical
outliers caused by data collection limitations (e.g. deterioration
of signal—to—noise ratio for a sample as it progresses through the
experiment).

Data abnormalities are often viewed as outliers in the whole
dataset. Recent work has shown the effectiveness of applying data
mining techniques, especially outlier detection, for the purpose of
data cleaning (Maletic and Marcus, 2000), making it possible to
automate the cleansing process for a variety of domains (Chu et 61].,
2005; Ebaid et 61]., 2013; Mayfield et 61]., 2010; Pearson, 2002).
In these methods, by detecting the minorities of values that do not
conform to the general characteristics of a given data collection, out—
liers are identified and are considered violations of association rules
or other patterns in the data. However, the existing models are not
suitable for phenotype data cleaning. These methods, while applied
to phenotype data, may remove outliers including both measure—
ment errors and true biological discoveries, since true biological dis—
coveries, to some extent, are outliers as well. Furthermore, detecting
abnormalities from long time—series phenotype data requires han—
dling a high temporal dimension, which increases the model
complexity.

To identify and remove abnormalities in phenotype data and to
minimize the deletion of biological discoveries, we have developed a
coarse—to—refined residual analysis algorithm, called dynamic filter.
Dynamic filter has three key steps: (i) identify abnormal candidates
at the coarse level, (ii) refine abnormality identification in a pro-
jected feature space and (iii) iteratively identify abnormalities at
the refined level. Dynamic filter can speed up the data preparation
process and make it more effective. Such improvements will minim-
ize time—consuming and labour—intensive data preparation and
increase the significance and confidence in biological discoveries.
In summary, our model has the following advantages:

° To our knowledge, dynamic ﬁlter is the ﬁrst work to integrate
biological constraints with time—series phenotype data for data
cleaning.

° Our model can identify both abnormalities and biological
discoveries.

° Dynamic ﬁlter outperforms the existing solutions by optimizing
the ﬁtness between phenotype data and biological constraints.

2 Background

Data cleaning is the process of identifying incorrect or corrupted re—
cords in a dataset. The goal of data cleaning is to ensure an accurate
representation of the real—world constructs to which the data refer.

Removing impurities from data is traditionally an engineering prob-
lem, where ad 1906 tools made up of low—level rules (such as detect—
ing syntax errors) and manually tuned algorithms are designed
for specific tasks (such as the elimination of integrity constraints vio—
lations) (Muller and Freytag, 2005). Detection and elimination
of complex errors representing invalid values, however, go beyond
the checking and enforcement of integrity constraints. They often
involve relationships between two or more attributes that are very
difficult to uncover and describe by integrity constraints. Recent
work has shown the effectiveness of applying techniques from statis—
tical learning for the purpose of data cleaning. In particular, outlier
detection methods have made it possible to automate the cleansing
process for a variety of domains (Chu et 61]., 2013; Ebaid et 61].,
2013; Koh et 61]., 2007; Maletic and Marcus, 2000; Mayfield et 61].,
2010; Pearson, 2002).

However, none of the existing outlier—detection based methods
are suitable for phenotype data cleaning. First, both biological dis—
coveries and errors of detection are difficult to separate from distri—
bution. Second, the cohesiveness rule used in temporal data cleaning
is not applicable for the phenotype data, because (i) a non—cohesive
time—serial could represent an interesting phenotype pattern rather
than an error; (ii) all the observations at the same time point may
be similarly affected by a systematic abnormal event (Muller and
Freytag, 2005).

Alternatively, rather than checking the raw values, residue ana—
lysis can be employed to model the differences between the real val—
ues and the theoretical curve, which is usually derived from
biological constraints such as generalized light reactions (Jassby and
Platt, 1976; MacIntyre et 61]., 2002). This is often called the good-
ness-of—ﬂt model. The goodness—of—fit based data cleaning models
can be classified into two categories. First, statistical distribution
characters such as mean, standard deviation, confidence interval or
range have been used to find unexpected values indicating possible
invalid values (Maletic and Marcus, 2000). Such simple methods
can be efficiently applied to big data. However, these parameters
(such as mean) are inclined to be biased by abnormalities with large
deviations. Since it does not take into account local characteristics
of data, there is a risk of mislabelling a range of normal data as
abnormalities and vice versa. Second, combined data—mining tech—
niques are used to identify patterns that apply to most residual re—
cords. A pattern is defined by a group of residuals that have similar
characteristics (behaviour for certain percentage of the fields in the
dataset). Outliers are then identified as values that do not conform
to the patterns in the data. Among them, the Hampel filter uses the
median of neighbouring observations as a reference value and looks
for local outliers in a streaming data sequence (Pearson, 2002,
2005). While the Hampel filter is suitable for temporal data clean—
ing, it assumes that the data are independent and identically distrib—
uted, which is not valid under dynamic environmental conditions.

It should be noted that while the goodness—of—fit based data
cleaning models focus on the modelling of deviation, they are not
aware that the theoretical curve, which is used as the reference, may
not always be precise. Typically, theoretical curves derived from
biological knowledge are simple compared with the real—world
situation. It is therefore inappropriate to directly use the imperfect
theoretical curve to infer abnormalities.

In this article, we develop a coarse—to—refined residual analysis
model called dynamic filter to effectively identify abnormalities in
plant photosynthesis phenotype data. Our model derives a theoret—
ical curve from the photosynthetic biological constraints; adjusts
the theoretical curve to fit the phenotype data via optimization
and studies the deviations of individual phenotype values from

theoretical curve. The resulting patterns in residuals indicate abnor—
malities, which are types of errors of detection, and the optimized
theoretical curves reveal true biological outliers.

3 Methods

In this section, we first introduce the theoretical curve of time—series
steady—state quantum yield data and then introduce a framework
for abnormality detection.

In this article, the time—series steady—state quantum yield of photo—
systems II (denoted as @H) is chosen for abnormality detection for three
reasons. First, (DH can be readily measured using ﬂuorescence video
imaging making it useful for high-throughput phenotyping. Second, be—
cause it reﬂects light—driven electron transfer, it can be used as an indica—
tor of photosynthetic rates and efficiency, albeit with the caveat that it
reﬂects the sum of C02 fixation, photorespiration and other processes
(Ogren and Evans, 1993). Finally, (DH is a good demonstration of the
approach because it tends to follow, to a reasonable degree, relatively
simple saturation behaviours. Given an adequate model, the cleaning
procedure described in the manuscript may also be applied to other
photosynthetic parameters like non—photochemical quenching (NPQ),
which can display complex behaviours.

3.1 Theoretical photosynthetic curve

An abnormality in residual analysis is an observation exhibiting a
large difference between the theoretical value and the observed value
and may indicate a data entry error from the phenotyping sensors.
To derive the theoretical curve, we model q)” with the photosynthe—
sis—irradiance (PI) curve (see Fig. 1a) (Jassby and Platt, 1976;
MacIntyre et al., 2002).

As a derivation of Michaelis—Menten kinetics, one of the best—
known models of enzyme kinetics in biochemistry (Menten and
Michaelis, 1913), PI is modelled as a hyperbolic curve (see Fig. 1a)
in Equation (1), revealing the empirical relationship between solar
irradiance and photosynthesis (MacIntyre et al., 2002).

Pmax [I]

where P is photosynthetic rate at a given light intensity, Pmax is the
maximum potential photosynthetic rate per individual, [I] is a given
light intensity and i1/2 is half—saturation constant. Figure 1a shows
the generally positive correlation between light intensity and photo—
synthetic rate. The PI curve has already been applied successfully to
explain ocean—dwelling phytoplankton photosynthetic response
to changes in light intensity (Jassby and Platt, 1976) as well as ter—
restrial and marine reactions.

We describe the photosynthetic rate P in terms of linear elec-
tron flow (Kramer and Evans, 2011) and associate both temporal
steady—state quantum yield of photosystems II (DH and temporal light
intensity 1' with time t, as shown in Equation (2):

max ($11)

1+“—t)

ii/z

@1107 1'1/2) = (2)

where t is a time point in a user—defined temporal region T (t E T);
@H(t) and i(t) represent the steady—state quantum yield of photosys—
tems II and light intensity at t; max ($11) is the maximal (DH in T;
and the half—saturation constant i1/2 is the light intensity at
which the photosynthetic rate proceeds at half Pmax. See proof in
Supplementary Section 81.

One may reasonably ask if the NPQ or photoinhibition would
affect the theoretical model for light saturation. In fact, NPQ has
(surprisingly) little effect on the relationship between (DH and light
intensity, as can be readily seen in the fact that the q)” light satur—
ation curves for wild type and the npq4 mutant of Arabidopsis
are essentially identical despite large differences in qE (i.e. rapidly
reversible photoprotection of NPQ) (Li et al., 2000). The reason for
this apparent disconnect is that, at high light, the slowest step in the
light reactions of photosynthesis occurs subsequent to light absorp—
tion at the cytochrome b6f complex and is finely regulated by the
pH of the lumen (Takizawa et al., 2007). Light absorption become
rate limiting only at NPQ levels much higher than those observed
here. The biological role of NPQ under most conditions appears
to be in regulating electron transfer but in preventing the build up
of reactive intermediates within the photosystem II reaction centre
(Muller et al., 2001). Thus, the effects of moderate levels of NPQ
and photoinhibition should have little effect on the behaviour of
the wild—type system. However, under extreme conditions of in mu-
tant lines with altered behaviour producing high levels of NPQ or
photoinhibition, we expect to see behaviour that deviates from that
produced by the model. These instances will be detected as outliers
and flagged for further investigation of possible biological
discoveries.

Consequently, the half—saturation constant i1/2 can be learned
using all Qua) and z'(t) in T with a non—linear regression method
(Seber and Wild, 2003). Note that the half—saturation constant
can be dramatically different between plants and between leaves in
plants. Thus, the general shape of the curve is typically maintained
but not its maximal or half—saturation light intensity.

Finally, given i1/2, the residual value at each time point t is
defined as

rsd(t) = @110) — Q’H(t,z'1/2) (3)

where rsd(t) is the residual value at time t; and @H(t) is the observed
value and Q’HU) is the theoretical value of steady—state quantum
yield at t calculated using Equation (2).

We note that there are multiple models for PI curves, which give
similar responses to light (de Lobo et al., 2013; Govindjee et al.,
2005; Lambers et al., 2008; Long and Hallgren, 1993; Zeinalov).
In this article, we chose the Michaelis—Menten kinetics model
because it is convenient to use and fits plant photosynthesis rate
data well (see Fig. 1b). It should be noted that an important feature
of our approach is that these alternative models can be easily added
or substituted for comparison.

3.2 Framework of dynamic filter
Dynamic filter is a coarse—to—refined residual analysis ap—
proach, which has three major steps as shown in Figure 2. We define

abnormalities using a definition to that proposed in Mayfield
et al. (2010):

DEFINITION 1: Abnormality. Let {@nor} be a set of normal
phenotype data, and {rsdnor} be the corresponding residual set. An
abnormality @abn is a phenotype value whose residual falling off the
or confidence interval of the major normal distribution of {rsdnor}.

Note that confidence interval or = 99% is commonly used in lit-
erature (Mayfield et al., 2010; Sohn et al., 2005), but is adjustable
by users. In this article, by adopting the concept of confidence inter—
val, we assume that (i) the majority of the phenotype values are
correct, and (ii) they form the major distribution in the residual
data, which is also distinctly different from the distribution(s) of the
residual data of the abnormalities.

Step 1. Coarse process to identify abnormal candidates

Given a set of phenotype data @11, we adopt Equation (2) to generate
the theoretical values of steady—state quantum yields for each plant,
denoted as {GYM}, by using the whole time—serial as temporal region T,
aka the coarse level. For the dataset used in Section 4, the smallest
value of time interval is 10 min, and the scale of T in the whole dataset
is 3 days. Consequently, we generate the residual data of all plants
{rsd} using Equation (3), and model them using a Gaussian mixture
model (GMM) (see details in Section 3.3 and example in Fig. 3a).
Finally, we generate the abnormality candidate set {@abn} with
Definition 1. In Figure 3b, solid points are abnormality candidates in
the coarse process. Clearly, because of the simplified PI curve model,
not all the abnormality candidates are correctly identified.

Step 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) process to refine abnormality
identification

Abnormality candidates may have certain intrinsic patterns of distri—
bution highly related to certain ranges of feature space. For example,

accidental dysfunction of data—capturing devices may cause abnor—
malities concentrated around some regions, which form statistical
patterns on the distribution plot of the feature space. From a statis—
tical viewpoint, abnormalities should be away from normal values
in the feature space, and values with similar features tend to have
the same labels. This leads to a refinement process to exploit the
patterns of abnormalities candidates on selected feature space, and
to make use of these patterns to refine abnormality identification, as
described in Algorithm 1.

Specifically, we first select the optimal features from @H, rsd, i, t,
etc., in which abnormalities and normal values are maximally sepa—
rated. To solve this feature reduction problem, linear discriminant
analysis (LDA) is adopted to get the principal components of the op—
timal feature space (Algorithm 1 line 9—20, see details in Section
3.3). Second, we apply K—nearest—neighbour approach on the se—
lected feature space, such that each abnormality candidate will be
relabelled as its majority label of le-nearest—neighbours (Algorithm 1
line 4—7) (Altman, 1992).

Step 3. Refined process to identify abnormalities in local regions
Because the theoretical values {GYM} are learned with the simplified
PI curve model at the coarse level, not all the assignments of the

abnormal candidates are correct. Consequently, we separate the
abnormal candidates {@abn} to temporal checking regions (see
Definition 2) and refine abnormality identification in each region.

DEFINITION 2: Temporal Checking Region. A checking region r
consists of at most m normal values flanking the selected abnormal
candidates, depending on data availability, denoted as {@nor}, and
at most n abnormal candidates such that the last abnormal candi-
date is constrained to be at most l-timepoints away from the first
one, denoted as {@abn}.

In Definition 2, m, n and l are user—defined parameters
that determine the size of a temporal checking region. A check
region has at most m —l— l — n normal values and at most n
abnormities. Note that abnormal candidates can be continuous or

discontinuous, and two checking regions may share common
normal values.

In the refined process, an expectation—maximization (EM) pro-
cess is employed to repeatedly optimize the results in each temporal
region r. Pseudo—code of the EM process is shown in Algorithm 2.
In the E step, using the local normal values {@nor} in checking region
r as inputs, we regenerate the theoretical values {ﬂy} with Equation
(2). Then the residuals {rsd} for both the abnormal candidates
{@abn} and the normal values {@nor} are regenerated using Equation
(3) (Algorithm 2 line 6—8). In the M step, we redefine the abnormal
candidate set {@abn} with the statistical distribution of the new
residual data {rsd} according to Definition 1. Specifically, a value
falls off the confidence interval threshold of the major distribution
of the normal residual values will be moved to {(Dabn}; and if an ab—
normal candidate is within the confidence interval threshold of the
major distribution of the normal residual values, it will be labelled
as normal and be moved to {@nor} (Algorithm 2 line 10 and 11).

The EM process will stop when the label assignment is stable.
Figure 3(c—f) shows the iterative process in a checking region. Since
checking regions may share common values, the results from differ—
ent regions may be conflicted. For example, a phenotype value is
identified as an abnormality in one region but is considered a normal
value in another region. To solve conﬂicts and consequently im—
prove performance, we employ an information sharing process in
the end of the EM process to broadcast all the local results to all
the checking regions. If conﬂict exists, voting results will be used to
redefine abnormal candidates in the selected feature space (Step 2),
and the EM process will rerun on the new checking regions. The
process will repeat till the results converge. Figure 3g and h demon—
strate that all the abnormalities are identified.

GMMs are commonly used as a parametric model of the probability
distribution of continuous features (Reynolds, 2009). The probabil—
ity density function is given by the equation:

M
WM) = Zwigoiiii, 2.) (4)
i=1

where x is a D—dimensional continuous—valued vector, 60,-,
i: 1,  ,M, are the mixture weights, and g(x|u,-, 2)), i = 1,  ,M
are the component Gaussian densities. Each component density is a
D—variate Gaussian function of the form:

1 1 _
g(xliui72i) = Wexp{—i(x — #0531105 — Mil} (5)

(271)

with ii,- be the mean vector and 2,- be the covariance matrix
(i : 1,  ,M). The mixture weights satisfy the constraint that
23,-Ail co,- = 1. GMM parameters are estimated from training data
using the maximum likelihood parameter estimation or maximum
a posteriori estimation (Reynolds, 2009). In this article, residuals are
1D scalar data, we use ii,- and 0',- to represent the mean and variance
of residuals.

chine learning to find a linear combination of features, which

characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events,
such that the inter—class variance is maximized and the intra—class
variance is minimized (Webb, 2002). The resulting combination
may be used as a linear classifier, or more commonly, for dimension-
ality reduction before later classification. In this article, we seek
combination of features, with which normal values (one class) are
centred around one area, while abnormalities (another class) are
centred around a distinctively separated area.

Suppose there are C classes, and each class has n,- points, mean ii,-
and intra—class variance 2,. Then the inter—class variance may be
defined by the sample covariance of the class means:

711'
SB = Zam- — i004.- — MT (6)
i=1
and the intra—class variance of whole dataset is SW =  SW,-
(McLachlan, 2004). The class separation in a direction a in this case
will be given by:

The objective function is to maximize S and it can be shown that
when a is the eigenvector of SWT1SB, S will have maximized value
corresponding to eigenvalue (Rao, 1948).

4 Experiment

We compared dynamic filter on both real and synthetic datasets
with two widely used data cleaning algorithms: (i) a statistical ap—
proach that classifies abnormalities based on standard variance
(Maletic and Marcus, 2000) and (ii) Hampel filter that identifies
abnormalities based on digress from median of trends (Pearson,
2002, 2005). Note that all the three methods were applied on the
same phenotype residual data for a fair comparison.

For performance evaluation, we used both the precision—recall
curve and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) (Baldi et al.,
2000). The MCC that can appropriately represent a confusion
matrix is computed with:

TP >< TN — FP >< FN

MCC : (8)
\/(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP) (TN + FN)

 

4.1 Real phenotype dataset

We first tested the performance of dynamic filter using the plant
photosynthetic phenotype data consisting of 106 Arabidopsis
thaliana plants (confirmed T—DNA insertion mutants and wild
types) sampled at 64 time points under dynamic light conditions
(Ajjawi et al., 2010; Alonso et al., 2003). The photosynthetic pheno—
type values vary dramatically across plants, reflecting potential dif-
ferences in development, stress responses or regulation of processes
such as stomatal conductance, photodamage and storage of photo—
synthate (Kramer and Evans, 2011). Experts went through the data
and manually marked the ground truth of abnormalities, and found
the error rate is 6.5%.

The experimental results shown in Figure 4a indicated that dy—
namic filter is significantly better than the other two approaches in
the precision—recall curve. Specifically, dynamic filter yields Area
Under Curve (AUC) as high as 0.964, higher than the AUC of simple
statistics and Hampel filter (0.147 and 0.543, respectively).
Figure 4b shows our model is also significantly better according to
MCC. Furthermore, it shows that dynamic filter is insensitive to the

selection of the confidence interval threshold, which is distinctly dif-
ferent from the other algorithms that rely on well—picked parameters.

Note that the AUC of dynamic filter without KNN is 0.862
(Fig. 4a), implying that KNN refinement (Step 2) is a key component
of dynamic filter. Specifically, Figure 5 shows how KNN refinement
improved the performance of data cleansing. On the @11 versus
residual plot shown in Figure 5a (detailed visualization on
Figure 5b), some isolated normal values are misclassified as abnor—
malities, and certain abnormalities misclassified as normal values.
Clearly, these values do not conform with the most nearby values.
By applying KNN refinement, this misclassification is effectively
corrected (Fig. 5c and d).

We systematically tested the performance of the different compo-
nents of dynamic filter. Figure 6 shows the performance improve—
ment by comparing dynamic filter with a model without KNN
refinement (v5), iteration of EM (v4), consensus on all regions (v3),
reassignment of normal values and abnormalities in EM (v2) or even
without the whole refined process (v1). It implies that the refined
process, especially the KNN and EM refinement, is the key of per-
formance improvement.

Figures 7 and 8 show case studies on the real data. In Figure 7, the
experiment was run on a wild—type reference plant, Arabidopsis Col—0.

In the coarse process, the residual analysis was applied to identify
the abnormal candidates (Fig. 7a and solid points in Fig. 7b).
Clearly, six solid points on the bottom were incorrectly labelled
as abnormalities, which were gradually corrected in the refined
process (Fig. 7c and d). Figure 8a shows a true biological discov—
ery on the real data. Our screen revealed accession ELY exhibit-
ing photosynthetic characteristics markedly different from the
reference (Col—0). It would however be labelled as abnormal and
subsequently deleted by the existing outlier—detection based data
cleaning methods, resulting in over-clean problem. Dynamic fil-
ter identifies ELY correctly and suggests that the differences in
its quantum yield are caused by the monotone decrease of i1/2 re—
gardless the change of sunlight (see Fig. 8b). The non-negligible
deviation between the observed values and the theoretical curve
learned from the coarse phase of dynamic filter (see Fig. 8c)
implies the theoretical model is simple compared with the real—
world situation. Instead of directly use the PI curve to infer
abnormalities, we optimize the fitting results in the refined phase
of dynamic filter, resulting in almost perfect match between the
observed values and the theoretical curve (see Fig. 8d).
Furthermore, we varied the size of the temporal checking region
and compared the performance in Figure 9. The results in Figure 9a
reveal that dynamic filter achieves the best performance when m is
between 10 and 15. This number allows enough training data for

the refinement process, meanwhile avoiding NPQ variation over
long time interval. Figure 9b shows that performance of dynamic
filter is relatively stable against max number of abnormalities n,
implying that robustness of dynamic filter is high.

4.2 Synthetic dataset

Since the true biological discoveries in the real data are unknown,
we further tested dynamic filter on serials of synthetic datasets.
The synthetic datasets were generated by varying four parameters
systematically: lights and i1/2 being smoothly or abruptly changed,
abnormalities being continuously or discontinuously distributed,
and error ratio being low or high. Furthermore, we added variations
representing abnormalities and biological discoveries (different i1/2
values) in the synthetic datasets. In total, 63 kinds of synthetic data—
sets in nine groups were generated, and for each kind of synthetic
data, we repeatedly generated 100 datasets.

Figure 10 shows the robustness of dynamic filter on different
synthetic datasets generated under nine different settings. The per-
formance is evaluated using MCC on both abnormalities and on
biological outliers. Each figure represents synthetic data generated
under different settings (see details in supplementary section S2).
Each point in Figure 10 represents a MCC score of biological

Fig. 10. The MCC of biological discoveries and abnormalities on synthetic data

discovery identification at x—axis and a MCC score of abnormality
identification at y—axis. The highest possible value is (10,10). The
experimental results show that dynamic filter (red circle) is better
than the other two methods in almost all the synthetic datasets. This
is because dynamic filter can identify and remove abnormalities
while reserving biological discoveries (see supplementary Tables 81
and S2 for performance comparison on MCC and true positive rate,
respectively).

5 Conclusion

With an aim towards identifying targets for improving energy yield,
advanced technologies in high—throughput plant photosynthetic phe—
notyping have been developed (Cruz et al., 2014; Houle et al.,
2010). These systems can be used to quantify photosynthetic behav—
iour in genetically diverse populations and to draw relationships
among genotype, phenotype and biological function, leading to a
better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control the
photosynthetic properties under various environmental conditions
(Fiorani and Schurr, 2013; Rascher et al., 2011). As a consequence
of the long-time high-throughput plant phenotyping, the scale of
plant phenomics data grows exponentially. However, the quality
of phenotype data may be skewed by sources of noise that are diffi—
cult to remove in the data collection step.

The purpose of plant phenotyping is to discover phenotype val—
ues that are significantly different from a reference. But phenotype

values leading to biological discoveries may be obscured by abnor—
mal values caused by errors during detection. To ensure high data
quality, effective data cleaning should be considered a primary task.
However, since advanced data cleaning algorithms are primarily
based on indiscriminate outlier detection, they may remove both
abnormalities and biological discoveries not separable in the data
distribution.

We have developed a new coarse—to—refined model called dy—
namic filter to effectively identify both abnormalities and biological
discoveries by adopting a widely used photosynthetic model.
Specifically, dynamic filter is a residual analysis approach by dynam—
ically tracing statistical distributions of all samples rather than
individuals, and incorporating EM for performance optimization in
refined checking regions.

We note that certain events, such as transient changes in growth
environment, could introduce signals similar to growth lighting
malfunction, which could be wrongly labelled as abnormalities by
dynamic filter. Therefore, instead of automatically deleting all the
predicted abnormalities, we send all of them to domain experts for
confirmation. Meanwhile, all raw data are kept for any rollback
operation.

Experimental results show that our model is significantly better
than the existing data cleaning tools on both real—phenomics data
and synthetic data. Dynamic filter may have a wide impact because
of the rapid increase of large—scale phenotyping technologies.
It should be noted that although we used a photosynthesis—specific

curve, the model itself is independent of actual biological con—
straints. In principle, our approach can be used to clean data for any
number of phenotypes as long as suitable theoretical curves can be
derived for their behaviour. Implementation for new use cases
would involve substituting the appropriate theoretical curve into
the program, calculating the residuals of fits to the datasets and
optimizing the fitting procedure as described in Figure 2.

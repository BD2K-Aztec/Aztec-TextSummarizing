Abstract

Motivation: Pathway enrichment analysis has become a key tool for biomedical researchers to
gain insight into the underlying biology of differentially expressed genes, proteins and metabolites.
It reduces complexity and provides a system-level view of changes in cellular activity in response
to treatments and/or in disease states. Methods that use existing pathway network information
have been shown to outperform simpler methods that only take into account pathway member-
ship. However, despite significant progress in understanding the association amongst members of
biological pathways, and expansion of data bases containing information about interactions of bio-
molecules, the existing network information may be incomplete or inaccurate and is not cell-type
or disease condition-specific.

Results: We propose a constrained network estimation framework that combines network estima-
tion based on cell- and condition-specific high-dimensional Omics data with interaction informa-
tion from existing data bases. The resulting pathway topology information is subsequently used to
provide a framework for simultaneous testing of differences in expression levels of pathway mem-
bers, as well as their interactions. We study the asymptotic properties of the proposed network esti-
mator and the test for pathway enrichment, and investigate its small sample performance in simu-
lated and real data settings.

Availability and Implementation: The proposed method has been implemented in the R-package
netgsa available on CRAN.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

1 Introduction

 

Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have transformed
biomedical research by enabling comprehensive monitoring of com-
plex biological systems. By profiling the activity of different molecu-
lar compartments (genomic, proteomic, metabolomic), one can
delineate complex mechanisms that play key roles in biological
processes or the development of distinct phenotypes. These techno-
logical advances have thus motivated new methodological develop-
ments, most notably the adaptation of systems perspectives to
analyze biological systems. Pathway analysis represents a key

component in the analysis process and has been used successfully in
generating new biological hypotheses, as well as in determining
whether specific pathways are associated with particular pheno-
types. Examples include analysis of pathways involved in initiation
and progression of cancer and other complex diseases (Wilson et al.,
2010), discovering novel transcriptional effects and co-regulated
genes (Green et al., 2011), and understanding the basic biological
processes in model organisms (Gottwein et al., 2007; Houstis et al.,
2006). See Huang et al. (2008) for additional examples of
applications.

Pathway analysis methods have evolved since the seminal work
by Subramanian et al. (2005). As pointed out in the review article by
Khatri et al. (2012), earlier techniques such as over-representation
analysis (Al-Shahrour et al., 2005), and gene set analysis (GSA)
(Efron and Tibshirani, 2007; Subramanian et al., 2005) treat each
pathway as a set of biomolecules. These methods assess whether
members of a given pathway have higher than expected levels of ac-
tivity, either by counting the number of differentially active mem-
bers, or by also accounting for the relative rankings of pathway
members and/or the magnitude of their associations with the pheno-
type. On the other hand, more recent and statistically powerful
methods also account for interactions between biomolecules. These
interactions are increasingly available from carefully curated biolo-
gical databases, such as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG, Kanehisa and Goto, 2000), Reactome (Joshi-Tope et al.,
2003), RegulonDB (Huerta et al., 1998) and BioCarta (Nishimura,
2001)

A network topology-based method that exhibits superior statis-
tical power in identifying differential activity of pathways was pro-
posed in Shojaie and Michailidis (2009, 2010). The Network-based
Gene Set Analysis (NetGSA) method also allows testing for potential
changes in the network structure under different experimental or
disease conditions. However, it requires a priori knowledge of inter-
actions among pathway members, which, despite rapid progress, re-
mains highly incomplete and occasionally unreliable (see e.g. Zaki
et al., 2013 and references therein). Moreover, existing network in-
formation often determine molecular interactions in the normal
state of the cell, and do not provide any insight into condition]
disease-specific alterations in interactions amongst components of
biological systems.

The increased availability of large sets of high-dimensional
Omics data [e.g. from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), http://can
cergenome.nih.govl], coupled with the development of network esti-
mation techniques based on graphical models (Lauritzen, 1996)
offers the possibility to validate and complement existing network
information, and to obtain condition-specific estimates of molecular
interactions. Such an approach for leveraging existing knowledge to
enhance the analysis of low signal-to-noise biological datasets was
advocated in Ideker et al. (201 1).

The first contribution of this article is the development of a
method for constrained network estimation from high-dimensional
data, together with establishing the consistency of the resulting esti-
mate. Estimation of high-dimensional networks subject to hard (or
soft) constraints on conditional dependence relationships amongst
random variables represents a canonical problem in the context of
graphical models, and the proposed method for addressing this
problem is of independent interest. By incorporating the condition-
specific network estimates from the proposed method into the
NetGSA framework, we also provide a rigorous statistical frame-
work for assessing alterations in biological pathways, referred to as
differential network biology (Ideker and Krogan, 2012).

The proposed framework accounts for two sources of uncer-
tainty: the first concerns the reliability of the external information
used for constructing the network estimate from data. The second is
the variability of the network estimate, which can impact the path-
way enrichment testing procedure. We establish that, under certain
regularity conditions, consistent estimates of the network can be ob-
tained, leading, in turn, to an asymptotically most power unbiased
test for pathway enrichment analysis. Our theoretical analysis also
sheds light into the potential improvements in accuracy and power
by directly accounting for the amount of reliable external network
information.

A second objective of this study is to scale up the NetGSA esti-
mation algorithm to very large size networks. The main bottleneck
in applying the NetGSA methodology arises from the estimation of
mixed effects linear parameters—specifically the variance compo-
nents—for thousands of variables. We develop efficient and stable
computational methods for estimation of these parameters based on
a profile likelihood approach. In particular, we employ a Cholesky
factorization of the covariance matrices to speed up matrix inver-
sions, and use it to develop a stable algorithm based on Newton’s
method with backtracking line search (Boyd and Vandenberghe,
2004: 487) for step size selection. To supply reliable starting points
for this algorithm, we further develop an approximate method-of-
moment-type estimator.

The proposed methods are illustrated on both metabolomics and
gene expression data. For mass spectrometry metabolomics profiling
one can obtain good quality measurements for a few hundred me-
tabolites that do not provide complete coverage of the underlying
biochemical pathways. The small number of metabolites in each
pathway and the incomplete coverage of the metabolites particularly
hinder the application of over-representation and GSA methods in
this setting. In our experience, only topology-based pathway enrich-
ment analysis methods, such as NetGSA, are capable of reliably
delineating pathway activity, as illustrated in Section 4. Further, our
investigation of previously analyzed gene expression data set on
lung and breast cancer provides new useful insights.

The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2.1
presents the new method for network estimation under external in-
formation constraints and establishes its consistency. Section 2.2
outlines the new computational algorithm for scaling up NetGSA,
as well as the inference procedure for both pathway enrichment and
differential network analysis. The performance of the developed
methodology is evaluated in Section 3 and is examined on real data
sets in Section 4.

2 Methods

Gaussian graphical models (Lauritzen, 1996, Chapter 5) are widely
used in biological applications to model the interactions among
components of biological systems (Dehmer and Emmert-Streib,
2008, Chapter 6). Specifically, partial correlation networks are com-
monly used to model interactions in molecular networks; these net-
works are represented by an undirected graph G = (V,E) with node
set V and edge set E corresponding to biomolecules interactions
among them, respectively. The edge set E corresponds to the p>< p
precision, or inverse covariance, matrix (2, whose nonzero elements
60,-,7 refer to edges between nodes i and i’, and indicate that i and i’
are conditionally dependent given all other nodes in the network.
The magnitude of the partial correlation A,-,v = —w,-,-: / deter-
mines the strength (positive or negative) of the conditional associ-
ation between the respective nodes. In the sequel, the matrix A will
also be called the weighted adjacency matrix, with A,-,v being the as-
sociation weight between i and i’.

2.1 Network estimation under external information
constraints

As discussed in Section 1, the availability of large collections of sam-
ples for different disease states and biological processes together
with carefully curated information of biomolecular interactions en-
ables the estimation of network structures within the setting of
Gaussian graphical models. However, the availability of external
network information provides a novel and unexplored modification

Network-based pathway enrichment analysis

 

of the corresponding network estimation problem. Denote by EC the
set of node pairs not connected in the network, i.e. 60,-,7 = 0. Then,
the external information can be represented by the following two
subsets

E1 =  E E Z  7E ilawii’ 7E 0})
E0 =  E E6 Z  75 l",0),','l = 

In words, E1 contains known edges, while E0 contains node pairs
where it is known that no interaction exists between them. Note
that E1 g E and E0 g EC. The external information available in E1
does not imply exact knowledge of the magnitude of (0,7 nor AW.

Suppose we observe an m X p data matrix Z = (Z1, . . . ,Zp),
where each row represents one sample from a p-variate Gaussian
distribution N(0,Q_1) for a given biological condition (e.g. cancer
or normal). Our goal is then to estimate the network structure, or
equivalently the precision matrix (2, subject to external information
encoded in E1 and E0. Let D = diag(£2) represent the diagonal ma-
trix whose diagonal entries are the same as Q and 11, be the p-identity
matrix. Then, A :11, — D‘UZQD—l/2 is the partial correlation ma-
trix. When E1 = E and E0 2 E, the problem becomes that of covari-
ance selection (Dempster, 1972), which has been studied extensively
in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, the prob-
lem of estimating Q (and the partial correlation matrix A) when
E1 and E0 only contain partial information (E1QE and E0 QEC) has
not been investigated before.

In this section, we assume that the m observations used for esti-
mating condition-specific networks are separate from those used for
pathway enrichment analysis (highlighted by the use of Zi’s and m
to denote the random variables and sample size, respectively). The
framework introduced in this section reduces the potential bias in
small sample settings, and takes advantage of the additional publicly
available samples, in lieu of reliable network information. With
large enough samples, network estimation and pathway enrichment
can be performed using the same set of samples by incorporating
sample splitting strategies. Although the problem considered in this
section is seemingly similar to matrix completion (Candes and
Recht, 2009), the two problems are fundamentally different in na-
ture. In particular, in this setting, matrix completion corresponds to
completing the remaining entries from the partially observed p X p
matrix A, under some structural assumptions on A, such as low-
rankness. On the other hand, in the setting of graphical models, the
entries of the weighted adjacency matrix are estimated based on
data on the nodes of the graph.

In biological settings, both the structure of the network, as well as
strengths of associations may be condition-specific. Therefore, we
need to accurately estimate the nonzero entries in Q to recover both
the structure of the network and the strength of associations between
nodes. In the absence of any external information, the 31-penalized
negative log-likelihood estimate of Q is obtained by solving

argmin {trace(£2§) — logdetQ + 21||Q||1 }, (1)
(2»0

wherein E = ZTZ / m is the empirical covariance matrix of the data,
||Q||1 = 21%,, |co,-,v| denotes the £1 norm of the parameters, and 2 is
the regularization parameter. In the presence of external informa-
tion, the problem can be cast as the following constrained optimiza-
tion one

In the following, we present a two-step procedure to solve the
constrained optimization problem (2). The proposed approach
combines the neighborhood selection technique (Meinshausen and
Buhlmann, 2006) with constrained maximum likelihood estima-
tion. It exploits the fact that the estimated neighbors of each node
using neighborhood selection coincide with the nonzero entries of
the inverse covariance matrix (Friedman et al., 2008). Specifically,
in neighborhood selection the network structure is estimated by
finding the optimal set of predictors when regressing the random
variable Z,- corresponding to node ie V on all other variables,
using an 11-penalized linear regression. The coefficients for this op-
timal prediction 0’ are closely related to the entries of the inverse
covariance matrix: for all i’ 75 i, 0:, = —co,-,v /co,-,-. The set of nonzero
coefficients of 0’ is thus the same as the set of nonzero entries in
the row vector of 60,-,7 (i’ 75 i), which defines the set of neighbors of
node i.

Let ] and [6 denote the subsets V\i for which external information
is available: ] is the set of nodes which are known to be in the neigh-
borhood of i, and ]f, is the set of nodes which are known to be not con-
nected to i. Let Z_,- denote the submatrix obtained by removing the ith
column of Z. Assume all columns of Z are centered and scaled to have
norm 1. Denote by 8?, the set of all p x p positive definite matrices and
8’]; = {Q 6 IRpo : 60,-,7 = 0, for all (i, i’) ¢ E where i7é i’}. The pro-
posed algorithm proceeds in two steps.

Remark 1. In step (i-b) of the algorithm, the coefficients 0’ for
known edges have not been penalized in (3). In settings where the
external information may be unreliable, we can augment (3) with a
lasso penalty 22,-,Eﬂtil|0,v|, where the penalty weights til (i’ E 
allow for different penalization depending on the reliability of exist-
ing information.

The second step focuses on estimation of the magnitude of non-
zero entries in the precision matrix (2, given the estimated network
topology  The optimization problems in both steps are convex
and can be solved efficiently using existing software (e.g. glmnet and
glasso in R).

The proposed estimator enjoys nice theoretical properties under
certain regularity conditions. Before presenting the main result,
we introduce some additional notations. Let 20 be the true co-
variance matrix and (20 = 251. For i = 1,. . . ,p, denote by ||(il’||0 = #
{i’: 0;, 75 0} the lo norm of 0’. Write s=max,~=1,___,,,7 ||0’||0 and

S0 = 257:1 ||0’||0. For a subset] C {1, . . . ,p}, let Z] be the submatrix
obtained by removing the columns whose indices are not in ]. We
make the following assumptions.

Assumption 1. There exist (pl, 4;, > 0 such that the eigenvalues of
20 are bounded, i.e. 0 < (1)2 S ¢min(20) S qﬁmax(20) g 1/(/)1 < oo.

Assumption 2. There exists K(s) > 0 such that

2 K(s). (6)

Assumption 1 is standard in high-dimensional settings.
Assumption 2 corresponds to the restricted eigenvalue assumption
introduced in Bickel et al. (2009), which is presented here for
completeness.

Denote by  the cardinality of the edge set E. Let r E (|E0| + I
E1|) /{p(p — 1) / 2} represent the percentage of external network in-
formation available. Clearly, 0 S r < 1. We are now ready to state
our first result.

Theorem 1. Suppose Assumption 1 holds and Assumption 2 is sat-
isfied with K(2$). For constants c1 > 4 and 0 < k1 < 1, assume
also that the sample size satisfies

16 2
m2{EE§b5}a—0w%0—mx m

where S0 is the total number of nonzero parameters excluding the di-
agonal. Consider (2 defined in (5). Then, with probability at least
1 — 2p2_Ci/8, under appropriately chosen xi, we have

A A $1 —
In—ewzsmt4mv=o(043¥}lﬂ) <0

Remark 2. In addition to the improved sample complexity (7), the
convergence rate in (8) indicates an improvement of the order of

(/Solog(1 —r)_1/m in the presence of external information. This

improvement is particularly important for our analysis of power
properties of NetGSA in Section 2.2.2, which requires norm consist-
ency of adjacency matrix estimation. Although consistency can be
established using a theoretical analysis similar to graphical lasso
(Rothman et al., 2008), our proofs in the Supplementary Materials
Section A utilize the techniques from Bickel et al. (2009) and Zhou
et al. (201 1) to characterize the improvement in rates resulting from
the external information.

Let A0 be the true partial correlation matrix, i.e.
A0 = II, — D3 1’ 2S2ng 1’ 2, where D0 = diag(£20). The following cor-
ollary is an immediate result of Theorem 1.

Corollary 1. Let assumptions in Theorem 1 be satisfied. Assume
further that S0 = o(m/log(p — rp)). For :2 defined in (5 ), let A be
the corresponding partial correlation matrix. Then, with probability
at least 1 — 2p2_‘i/8, under appropriately chosen xi, we have

||A — A0H2 = 0(1)-

Remark 3. Corollary 1 implies that, under certain regularity con-
ditions, the error in the condition-specific network estimate A is
negligible. This proves essential for establishing power properties of
NetGSA with estimated network information, as shown in the next
section. The proof of Corollary 1 is available in the Supplementary
Materials Section A.

The tuning parameter 2 in the first step of the proposed algo-
rithm is important for selecting the correct structure of the network,
which further affects the magnitude of the network interactions in
the second step. Accurate estimation of these magnitudes is crucial
for topology-based pathway enrichment methods. We propose to se-
lect 2 using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Specifically,
for a given 2, we define

AA A 1 A
BIC(2) = trace(2£2,1) — logdet(§2,1) +¥ |E,1|, (9)
where {2,1 is the estimated precision matrix from the data and E ,1 is
the estimated edge set. The optimal tuning parameter is thus
2* = argmin/(BICUL).

2.2 NetGSA with estimated network information

Next, we discuss how (condition-specific) estimates of bimolecular
interactions from Section 2.1 can be incorporated into the NetGSA
framework to obtain a rigorous inference procedure for both path-
way enrichment and differential network analysis. To this end, we
formally define the NetGSA methodology based on undirected
Gaussian graphical models in Section 2.2.1. In Section 2.2.2, we dis-
cuss how the constrained-network estimation procedure of Section
2.1 can be combined with NetGSA to rigorously infer differential
activities of biological pathways, as well as changes in their network
structures.

2.2.1 The latent variable model
Consider p genes (proteins/metabolites) whose activity levels across
n samples are organized in a p X n matrix D. In the framework of
NetGSA, the effect of genes (proteins/metabolites) in the network is
captured using a latent variable model (Shojaie and Michailidis,
2009, 2010). Denote by Y an arbitrary column of the data matrix
D. Suppose the observed data can be decomposed into signal, X,
plus noise a N Np(0, 031p), i.e. Y = X + s. The latent variable model
assumes that the signal X follows a multivariate normal distribution
with partial correlation matrix A. Based on the connection between
linear recursive equations and covariance selection proposed in
Wermuth (1980), there exists a lower triangular matrix A such that
A_1X = y, where y N Np(u, 031p) and AAT = (II, — A)_1. Note that
the current version of the NetGSA model differs from the original
model in Shojaie and Michailidis (2009, 2010). This difference is
primarily manifested through the definition of A in the two models:
A is defined here based on the undirected partial correlation net-
work A, whereas it was previously defined based on directed (phys-
ical) interactions among genes (proteins/metabolites) in Shojaie and
Michailidis (2009, 2010).

Assuming that y and a are independent, the NetGSA model can
then be summarized as

Y=Ay+a (10)

The NetGSA methodology allows for more complex models,
including time course observations. For expositional clarity, we pre-
sent the methodology in the setting of two experimental conditions
and consider the general case where A0) 75 Am. Details of NetGSA
under multiple conditions can be found in Shojaie and Michailidis
(2010) and are applicable for the undirected networks presented in
this work. Let Yllk)  = 1, . . . ,n; la 2 1,2) be the j—th sample in the
expression data under condition la (ith column of data matrix D),
with the first n1 columns of D corresponding to condition 1 (control)
and the remaining n2 2 n — n1 columns to condition 2 (treatment).

Network-based pathway enrichment analysis

 

Denote by N“ the influence matrix and Mk) the mean vector under
condition la. The NetGSA framework considers a latent variable
model of the form

Here, yl- is the vector of (unknown) random effects, and s,- is the
vector of random errors. They are independent and normally distrib-
uted with mean 0 and variances 0in and 0311,, respectively.

Inference in NetGSA requires estimation of the mean parameters
11(1) and 11(2) and variance components a; and of. The variance com-
ponents can be estimated via maximum likelihood or restricted max-
imum likelihood, which can be computationally demanding for
large networks. To extend the applicability of the NetGSA, we con-
sider using Newton’s method for estimating the variance parameters
based on the profile log-likelihood to improve the computational
stability. See Supplementary Materials Section B for more details.

2.2.2 Joint pathway enrichment and differential network analysis
using NetGSA

To test for enrichment of a pre-specified pathway P, Shojaie and
Michailidis (2009) propose the contrast vector (Searle, 1971)
Z = (—bA(1) G) b,bA(2) G) b), where b is a row binary vector deter-
mining the membership of genes in a pre-specified pathway P and 6)
denotes the Hadamard product. The advantage of this contrast vec-
tor is that it isolates influences from nodes outside the pathways of
interest. Let [i = (u(1)T,y(2)T)
The null hypothesis of no pathway activity vs the alternative of

T be the concatenated vector of means.

pathway activation then becomes
H0:£ﬁ=0, H1sz750. (11)

The significance of individual contrast vectors in (11) can be
tested using the following Wald test statistic

ii

TS = —A, (12)
SEW)

where SEQ/B) represents the standard error of [B and B is the esti-
mate of [3. Both Z and SE(@) depend on the underlying networks,
which are estimated using data from the two experimental condi-
tions. Under the null hypothesis, TS follows approximately a t-dis-
tribution whose degrees of freedom can be estimated using the
Satterthwaite approximation method (Shojaie and Michailidis,
2010).

The above general framework allows for test of pathway enrich-
ment in arbitrary subnetworks, while automatically adjusting for
overlap among pathways. In addition, the above choice of contrast
vector Z accommodates changes in the network structure. Such
changes have been found to play a significant role in development
and initiation of complex diseases (Chuang et al., 2012), and
NetGSA is currently the only method that systematically combines
the changes in expression levels and network structures, when test-
ing for pathway enrichment. However, the applicability of the exist-
ing NetGSA framework (Shojaie and Michailidis, 2009, 2010) is
limited by the assumption of known network structure (namely
N“, k = 1, 2). In the current framework, we estimate A(k) (la 2 1, 2)
from data as discussed in Section 2.1. We next show that NetGSA
with estimated network information provides valid inference for
pathway enrichment and differential network analysis.

For k: 1, 2, let Z(k) of dimension mk X p be the data matrix
used to separately estimate the partial correlation matrix under

condition k. Denote by Sk the number of nonzero off-diagonal
entries in the true partial correlation matrix Age) and by rk the per-
centage of available external information. We obtain the following
result.

Theorem 2. Let assumptions in Theorem 1 be satisfied and Sk = o
(mk/log(p — rkp)) under each kcondition la (la 2 1,2). Consider the
inverse covariance matrices Q estimated from (5 ) of Section 2.1.
Thken the test statistic in (12) based on the corresponding networks
A is an asymptotically most powerful unbiased test for (1 1).

Remark 4. Theorem 2.1 of Shojaie and Michailidis (2010) says
that NetGSA is robust to uncertainty in network information.
Specifically, Shojaie and Michailidis (2010) show that if the error in
network information A Ag.) 2 A — Age) satisfies “AA? “2 2 011(1),
then NetGSA is an asymptotically most powerful unbiased test for
(1 1). The result in Theorem 2 establishes this property for (partially)
estimated networks using the consistency of our proposed network
estimation procedure in Theorem 1 and Corollary 1. A detailed

proof can be found in the Supplementary Materials Section A.

3 Simulation results

We present two simulation studies to assess the performance of the
proposed network estimation procedure, as well as its impact on
NetGSA. We refer readers to the Supplementary Materials Section C
for additional simulation scenarios—including validation of Type I
errors and settings with a large number of variables p—and subse-
quent discussion.

Our first experiment is based on an undirected network of size
p: 100. The network structure is extracted from the DREAM3
challenge (Prill et al., 2010) corresponding to the Ecoli network
(labeled Ecoli 1). The pathways of interest are determined through a
community detection algorithm based on the leading nonnegative
eigenvector of the modularity matrix of the network (Csardi and
Nepusz, 2006). Under the null hypothesis, all nodes have the same
mean expression values of 1. Under the alternative hypothesis, the
mean expression levels of 0%, 30%, 40% and 60% of nodes in sub-
networks 1, 3, 5 and 7 are increased by 0.5, respectively.

Our second experiment considers a network of size p = 160 with
8 subnetworks of equal sizes, all of which are generated from the
same scale-free graph of size 20. To allow for interactions across
subnetworks, there is 20% chance for the hub node in each subnet-
work to connect to the hub node in another subnetwork. Mean ex-
pression values for all nodes are the same under the null hypothesis.
Under the alternative hypothesis, we allow, respectively, 0, 40, 60
and 80% of the nodes to have positive mean changes of magnitude
0.5 for subnetworks 1—4. Subnetworks 5—8 follow the same pattern.

In both experiments, we also allow the structures in four subnet-
works under the alternative hypothesis to differ from their null
equivalent by a small amount, in order to simultaneously test path-
way enrichment and differential networks. Figure 1 shows the net-
work topologies as well as the structural changes for the chosen
subnetworks from the null to the alternative hypothesis in the two
experiments. Further, we study the robustness of NetGSA to model
misspecification by including scenarios where a proportion (50%
for r = 0.2 and 20% for r: 0.8 in experiment 1, and 60% in experi-
ment 2) of the supplied structural information is incorrectly speci-
fied, i.e. they are not present in the true model.

To illustrate how external network information affects the esti-
mation accuracy, we vary the percentage of information r from 0 to
1. When r is less than 1, we estimate the adjacency matrices using

the proposed two-step procedure and fill in the non-zero edges with
the estimated weights. When full knowledge of the network top-
ology is given (r: 1), we only apply the second step to estimate the
edge weights. When there exist misspecified edges in the external in-
formation, we use two tuning parameters for network estimation,
one for controlling the overall sparsity of the network and the other
for correcting the misspecified edges. The optimal tuning parameters
are selected over a grid of values using BIC defined in (9).

Table 1 compares the estimated networks with the true model
under several deviance measures based on 100 simulation replica-
tions; in both experiments, the sample size for both null and alterna-
tive hypotheses is m: 100. The Matthews correlation coefficients
improve significantly as the percentage of external information r in-
creases from 20 to 80%, and the Frobenius norm loss shows a clear
decreasing trend, both indicating the improvement in estimation ac-
curacy when more external information is available. In cases where
the information is misspecified [denoted by 0.2(m) and 0.8(m)], one
can see that the performance of network estimation is not compro-
mised by much after properly selecting the tuning parameters.

Next, we examine the performance of NetGSA in detecting path-
way enrichment by comparing it with GSA (Efron and Tibshirani,
2007). GSA tests a competitive null hypothesis and compares the set
of genes in the pathway with its complement in terms of association
with the phenotype. The underlying model consists of both random-
ization of the genes and permutation of the samples, which are com-
bined into the idea of ‘restandardization’. This method is later
denoted by GSA-c. In addition, we consider GSA with permutation
of the samples only, later denoted by GSA-s, since this version of
GSA compares the set of genes in the pathway with itself.

Tables 2 and 3 present the estimated powers for each subnet-
work in the two experiments from 100 simulation replicates, re-
spectively. Here we use n1 2 n2 2 25 samples for each condition in
experiment 1 and n1 2 n2 2 40 in experiment 2, which are different
from the datasets used for network estimation. The powers are cal-
culated as the proportion of replicates that show differential

changes, based on the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling proced-
ure of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). To facilitate comparison,
different FDR cutoffs are used for GSA and NetGSA to ensure con-
sistent type I error for the first pathway in both experiments. For
NetGSA, we look at scenarios when there is 20 and 80% external
structural information (with and without misspecification) and use
the estimated networks to test enrichment for each subnetwork. We
also include the scenario where the exact networks with correct edge
weights are provided, in which case only the variance components
and mean expression values are estimated from the mixed linear
model. True powers for each subnetwork are calculated by replacing
all unknown parameters with their corresponding known values.
For p = 100, the results from NetGSA with the exact networks
agree with the true powers, indicating low powers for subnetworks
1, 2 and 4, slightly higher powers for 3, 6 and 8, high powers for 5
and 7 due to significant changes in mean expression levels and struc-
tures. When the exact networks are unknown, we see clear improve-
ment in the estimated powers for subnetworks 4, 7 and 8 as the
percentage of external information increases from 20 to 80%. GSA-
s does reasonably well with overestimated powers for subnetwork 8.

cases (r = 0.2 and r = 0.8), the results bear high similarity to those in
the first two columns, which suggests that the proposed framework
is robust to inaccuracy in network information.

For p = 160, the NetGSA estimated powers when 20% external
information is available match the true powers reasonably well,
with a small underestimation of powers for subnetworks 3, 7 and 8.
We note marked improvement in the three corresponding values
when the external information increases to 80%. Moreover,
NetGSA is able to distinguish subnetworks 5—8 that have both
changes in mean values and subnetwork topology from their corres-
ponding counterparts 1—4. When the external information is misspe-
cified, the last two columns indicate that NetGSA still returns valid
powers that are comparable to those obtained with correctly speci-
fied structural information. GSA-s yields a small overestimation of
powers for subnetwork 7.

In both experiments, GSA with randomization of the genes
(GSA-c) fails to identify any of the differential subnetworks.

4 Applications to metabolomics and genomics
data

We apply NetGSA to three Omics data sets to demonstrate its po-
tential in revealing biological insights. In all three studies, the P-val-
ues were corrected for multiple comparisons using the FDR control
procedure proposed in Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001) to account
for the dependency among KEGG pathways.

Our first application is based on the metabolomics data set from
(Putluri et al., 2011) to examine changes in metabolic profiles asso-
ciated with bladder cancer using untargeted mass spectrometry data
acquisition strategy. The data consists of 31 cancer and 27 benign
tissue samples and 63 detected metabolites. Here we focused on esti-
mating the network of metabolic interactions, enhanced by informa-
tion gleaned from KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000). For each
condition, we used the BIC criterion to select the tuning parameter
xi. At the optimal xi, we applied the proposed network estimation
procedure to identify the metabolic network; see Figure 2 for an il-
lustration of the estimated networks for the cancer and benign
classes, respectively. It can be seen that there are numerous inter-
actions between pathways that describe energy metabolism in the
cancer state, due to the greater need of cancer cells for energy.

We tested for differential activity of biochemical pathways
extracted from KEGG using the same set of data. Shown in Table 4

are estimated P-values after FDR correction with a q-value of 0.01
for the significant pathways selected from NetGSA. These identified
pathways include those that describe altered utilization of amino
acids and their aromatic counterparts, as well as metabolism of fatty
acids and intermediates of tricarboxylic acid cycle which were fol-
lowed up for biological insights in the original study by Putluri et al.
(2011). Among the selected pathways, fatty acid biosynthesis is not
identified by GSA-s. Interestingly, GSA-c fails to report any pathway
as being significantly enriched. This again confirms our hypothesis
that incorporating pathway topology information allows sophisti-
cated enrichment methods in detecting important regulatory
pathways.

The second data set (Subramanian et al., 2005 ) consists of gene
expression profiles of 5217 genes for 62 normal and 24 lung cancer
patients. We considered 47 KEGG pathways of size at least 5 that
describe signaling and biochemical mechanisms and excluded genes
that eitrher are not present in the 47 pathways, or without recorded
network information. The number of genes that remain for pathway
enrichment analysis is 303. Based on the external topology informa-
tion from the BioGRID database, we applied the proposed network
estimation procedure coupled with BIC to estimate the underlying
interaction networks for both normal and cancer conditions. We
then explored whether GSA and NetGSA with the estimated net-
works are able to detect enriched pathways using the same data set.
After correcting for multiple comparisons, using a FDR of
q* = 0.01, none of the three methods identifies any pathway as
being significantly differential enriched. The lack of statistical power
in obtaining differential pathways was also noted in the original art-
icle of (Subramanian et al., 2005 ); see Supplementary Table S9 for

NetGSA and a relaxed FDR cutoff threshold of 0.30 (similar to the
strategy adopted in Subramanian et al., 2005), we obtain the follow-
ing top three ranked signaling pathways: Jak-STAT, p53 and Wnt.
All three are implicated in lung cancer, although the latter two are
also implicated in multiple other types of human malignancies.
However, the Jak/STAT pathway has been recently shown to play a
key role in non small cell lung cancer cells (Song et al., 201 1).

Our third and final application is based on a data set from
TCGA (2012). The data set contains RNA-seq measurements for
17 296 genes from 1033 breast cancer specimens, including ER posi-
tive, ER negative and other unevaluated cases. As in the previous
gene microarray study, the external network information is ex-
tracted from the BioGRID database. We focused on a subset of the
genes that have recorded network information and are present in
KEGG pathways with at least 5 members. This leaves for further
consideration 800 genes with 403 samples from the ER positive and
117 from the ER negative classes, spanning over 45 KEGG path-
ways. We then applied the constrained network estimation proced-
ure with the tuning parameter selected via BIC in (9) to obtain the
partial correlation networks for the ER positive and ER negative
classes, respectively. Due to the large number of variables, visualiza-
tion of the estimated networks at the individual gene level is

challenging. Instead, we examine the interactions among pathways
in Figure 3 to gain insight into their co-regulation behavior. The
weighted pathway level network is defined as follows. Let each node
in the network represent one pathway, with size proportional to the
size of the corresponding pathway. A weighted edge between two
pathways P1 and P2 is defined as the number of nonzero partial cor-
relations between genes in P1 and those in P2 (normalized by the
sizes of the two pathways). Links visualized in Figure 3 are the top
5% of the weighted edges, where ranking is based on edge weights.
Table 5 presents the FDR corrected P-values for the selected dif-
ferential pathways using NetGSA based on the estimated partial cor-
relation networks, as well as GSA-c and GSA-s. The complete table
is presented in the Supplementary Materials Section D. At off 2 0.
01, NetGSA reports 25 out of the 45 KEGG pathways as signifi-
cantly enriched, whereas GSA either rejects the null for all pathways
(GSA-c) or fails to reject any pathway (GSA-s). Selected differential
pathways identified by NetGSA are also highlighted in Figure 3. Of
particular interest is the set of connected, enriched pathways cen-
tered around the ErbB pathway in Figure 3(b). This pathway con-
tains receptors that signal through various pathways to regulate cell
proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell motility
and play a key role in breast cancer (Howe and Brown, 2011), al-
though its role in breast carcinogenesis not very well understood.
Note that the Jak-STAT pathway is downstream of the ErbB one
and can be activated by key epidermal growth factor receptors in
the former to create signaling cascades (Henson and Gibson, 2006 ).
Further, the GnRH signaling pathway has been reported to interact
with the ErbB pathway receptors (Morgan et al., 2011). All these

Network-based pathway enrichment analysis

 

interconnected pathways are related to receptors that have been
implicated in various studies with over-expression in the ER nega-
tive class and hence faster tumor growth and poorer clinical
outcomes.

5 Discussion

This article introduces a constrained partial correlation network es-
timation method that seamlessly incorporates externally available
interaction information for genes and other biomolecules. The end
product is a reliable condition-specific estimate of the underlying
networks. The resulting estimated network structures are then used
for network-based pathway enrichment analysis. For the purpose of
constrained network estimation, one might also try the one-step
constrained maximum likelihood estimation (a functionality offered
in the R-package glasso) to recover the underlying partial correl-
ation network. However, this one-step approach requires sophisti-
cated specification of the tuning parameters at positions for which
structural information is available, and can be challenging to imple-
ment in practice.

Two sources of uncertainty can be identified in the proposed
framework: one from the reliability of the external database infor-
mation in the network estimation procedure and the other from the
uncertainty regarding the estimated network itself, as well as how it
propagates into the NetGSA testing procedure. As discussed in
Remark 1, the proposed method can conveniently accommodate the
first source of uncertainty by incorporating a non-zero penalty on
parameters that are uncertain. Further, as shown in Theorem 2, the
proposed test via the extended NetGSA framework is asymptotically
unbiased and most powerful, given the consistency of the estimated
network, and hence accounts for the second source of uncertainty.
Nevertheless, in finite samples as the numerical work in the
Supplementary Materials Section C illustrates, Type I errors may be
slightly off in the presence of numerous errors in the estimated net-
work (either due to misspecification of the external information or
lack of samples for accurate estimation). The topic of dealing with
network estimation errors and possible ways to address it is dis-
cussed in Narayan and Allen (2016).

Finally, the current framework of NetGSA uses the Cholesky de-
composition of the covariance matrix of the underlying network. It
is natural to ask whether the order of the variables affects the result
of enrichment analysis. In simulations and the real data analyses, we
find that the estimated powers/P-values from NetGSA are compar-
able after permutation of the variables.

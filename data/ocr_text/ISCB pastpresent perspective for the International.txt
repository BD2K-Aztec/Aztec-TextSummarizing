ABSTRACT

Since its establishment in 1997, International Society for Computa-
tional Biology (ISCB) has contributed importantly toward advancing
the understanding of living systems through computation. The ISCB
represents nearly 3000 members working in >70 countries. It has
doubled the number of members since 2007. At the same time, the
number of meetings organized by the ISCB has increased from two in
2007 to eight in 2013, and the society has cemented many lasting
alliances with regional societies and specialist groups. ISCB is ready
to grow into a challenging and promising future. The progress over the
past 7 years has resulted from the vision, and possibly more import-
antly, the passion and hard working dedication of many individuals.

BEGINNING

The year 1993: the dawn of the Internet; Gopher with bookmark
lists instead of Google; the ﬁrst public servers for molecular biol-
ogy have popped up (Henikoff, 1993) and with it the dawn of a
new era: the explosion of computational biology and bioinfor-
matics. Larry Hunter, Russ Altman and others shared a vision to
bring biology into computer sciences and vice versa and orga-
nized the ﬁrst Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB)
meeting. The sequencing of entire chromosomes (Goffeau et al.,
1993) and 2 years later of entire organisms (Fleischmann et al.,
1995) drove a demand for experts in their analysis. ISMB grew
exponentially. At the ﬁfth ISMB (Halkidiki, Greece), a few vi-
sionary shapers created the International Society for
Computational Biology (ISCB). Missions for the society have
been as follows: advancing the understanding of living systems
through computation, nurturing the next generation of scientists
and the communication of the importance of the ﬁeld. Another
more mundane goal has been the creation of a home, an organ-
izational support infrastructure for this new ﬁeld that bridges
antipodal cultures and interests.

‘All beginnings are difﬁcult’? This one could hardly have been
simpler: the ﬁeld continued to explode: over 1600 scientists par-
ticipated in the 10th ISMB (2002 Edmonton, Canada, Fig. l).
The 5-year old ISCB had 1500 members (Fig. 1). Many issues,
however, had not been addressed: members joined for 1 year at a
time; membership fees could not be credited toward minor re-
ductions in registration fees; ISMB was run by individual scien-
tists with <12 months of planning and few lessons learned were
passed on; ISCB had some oversight, but little control and role.

On top of those issues, one important leap is challenging for
any enterprise, namely, that from being driven by passionate

visionaries who generously and freely give to being carried by
professionals who earn their living with their job. It requires
hiring staff and contractors and creating an organizational infra-
structure [ofﬁcers, executive committee, board of directors
(BoD), committees and their chairs]. Those who had expected
ISCB to complete this transition within much less than a decade
had been over-optimistic.

CRISIS

At the end of 2006, ISCB had again ~1500 members (Fig. 1).
Two ISMBs had moved outside the geographic base of most
ISCB members (North America and Western Europe): 2003
Brisbane, Australia and 2006 Fortalezza, Brazil. Both had
failed to attract as many participants as needed. Consequently,
ISCB’s assets were so low that one additional ISMB returning
less than needed might have caused a severe ﬁnancial bottleneck.

At the beginning of 2007, ISCB was under immense pressure:
it had to ﬁnally seize control over ISMB and to generate new
revenues at a moment as extreme economic challenges began to
hit. Many of the ﬁrst generation computational scientists who
jumped onto the bandwagon of biology had at that point been
securely seated in biology. This tremendous achievement hit the
society: funding agencies reacted to the economy by reducing
support for meetings. Investigators have since been forced to
choose between the meeting driven by the speciﬁc biological
topic (e.g. genome sequencing) and the generic meeting of the
ﬁeld of computational biology. Many choose the ﬁrst, i.e. com-
puter scientists were immersed in biology. This was a sign of
ISCB’s success in bringing computer scientists into biology.
Unfortunately, the ‘success’ reduced the participation at ISMB,
the revenues of which accounted for most of what kept the so-
ciety aﬂoat in 2006. Furthermore, membership oscillated by
>50% around 1500, depending on ISMB attendance. Reduced
ISMB participation costs ISCB twice (less registration, few mem-
bers). On top, the move into open access publication deprived the
society of an important revenue stream and an important part-
ner. How to attract more members while funding shrinks? How
to raise revenues when the sources have dried up that had created
more income than the membership fees (private donors and
journals)?

Catharsis

How did ISCB rise from the crisis? As one who has most closely
been monitoring the transition from crisis to catharsis, the

author is not sure. The achievements of ISCB over the past 7
years have been amazing. Several teams of individuals have
stepped up to the challenges and have steered the ship into
steady waters. Important have been the staff and contractors,
the executive committee, several committee chairs and commit-
tees, the student council and many individuals who have con-
tributed their goodwill and passion. As a result, ISCB has
succeeded in providing a working template for ISMB; it has
signed a long-term deal guaranteeing ISMB/ECCB meetings
every 2 years; meetings are now planned >3 years in advance
and a semiautomated planning process for ISMB operates under
the oversight of a talented Conference Director (Steven Leard)
and his team.

Having the main annual event ISMB alternate between sites
attractive to and easily reachable by members from North
America and Western Europe implied that ISCB had to make
additional efforts to justify the ‘international’ in its name. One
important step toward this end was the organization of new
meetings with regional focus. These ISCB-x meetings—the
ISCB-Africa co-organized with the African Society for
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (2009 Bamako,
Mali; 2011 Cape Town, South Africa; 2013 Casablanca,
Morocco), the ISCB-Latin America (2010 Montevideo,
Uruguay; 2012 Santiago, Chile; 2014 Sao Paulo, Brazil) and
the ISCB-Asia (2011 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia—co-organized
in conjunction with InCoB and APBioNet; 2012 Shen-Zhen,
China—co-organized with BGI; 2013 Seoul, South Korea—co-
organized in conjunction with the Translational Bioinformatics
Conference). At the same time, ISCB has begun to get involved
with the ISCB-focus meetings (Conference on Semantics and
Healthcare and Life Sciences—CSHALS in Boston from 2007—
2014; 2013 Next N GS challenge Valencia, Spain; others to follow)
and in regional meetings (GLBIO and Rocky). Instead of having
involvement with two meetings, ISCB now runs >8 meetings each
year. What a leap! At the same time the membership base has
more than doubled (nearly 3000), many members have signed up
for multiple years and instead of 80—100 scientists presented at

ISCB meetings in 2006, >500 are going to present at ISCB meet-
ings in 2013. ISMB ran on a single-track from 1992—2002,
increased to 2—3 parallel tracks from 2003—2006 and jumped to
6—9 parallel tracks thereafter. This increased the complexity of
the organization substantially, and it also more than quintupled
the number of scientists who present at the meeting.

ISCB has evolved from being at the fringes to becoming a
thriving hub for the computational biology community. ISCB
meetings are fun and are the place where people want to be, to
network, to communicate the latest science and for the fun! This
has been a big step and has taken an immense amount of effort.
ISCB stands stronger scientiﬁcally and ﬁnancially than ever
before; it has grown into The International Society for
Computational Biology.

What got us there was hard work. There are many important
details the society eventually got right. However, I believe, the
main reason for the success were the people who have driven it.
Many cared, many put in their talents and passion.

To mention just a tiny subset: Reinhard Schneider completely
turned the membership services and the ISCB Web site around
and helped importantly to securing a solid ﬁnancial standing.
Janet Kelso was absolutely crucial for the conferences. Scott
Markel brokered deals with publishers that appeared impossible.
Michal Linial made the association with European Conference
on Computational Biology (ECCB) happen and, like Terry
Gaasterland, added many important advances. Thomas
Lengauer, Scren Brunak and Alfonso Valencia were instrumen-
tal for the identiﬁcation of scientists deserving ISCB’s prestigious
awards. Rick Lathrop found ways to push forward our stance on
open access. Manuel Corpas was instrumental in kicking off
ISCBSC, the student council that became an immensely import-
ant constituent (many supported him and many carried the torch
to greater heights, too many, in fact, to list here). Alex Bateman
brought ISCB closer to Wikipedia. Dietlind Gerloff for many
years helped to ﬁnd the right people for the ISCB BoDs and
ofﬁcers. Mona Singh and Pierre Baldi contributed importantly
to making the fellows concept work out. Fran Lewitter and
Bruno Gaeta have begun to ﬁnd new roles for ISCB’s contribu-
tions toward education. Lonnie Welch and Bruno Gaeta import-
ant advanced the role of afﬁliates. Finally, Olga Troyanskaya
and Lonnie Welch for their role in making the society pages in
our journals, Bioinformatics and PLoS Computational Biology,
more successful. The length of the aforementioned list may fool
readers into assuming it would somehow be complete. May be
those who advanced ISCB the most over the past 7 years are
listed previously, but those few mark only the tip.

Finding the right people has been the tricky part. The more
ISCB succeeds, the more appear who want to get instead of give,
and have to be fended off. Even more complicated is the follow-
ing immanent problem: ‘truly happy and passionate scientists’
typically succeeded more alone in the unknown than in teams.
They often are not best suited for the realities of committees and
infrastructural bodies. Consequently, volunteers for committees
might not always be the ones best connected to their peers and
might not optimally advance scientiﬁc societies. The challenge is
to support exactly those in synch with their peers and who are
willing to give themselves for little return. ISCB succeeded
thanks to many who have done exactly this.

Perspective

The immediate future of ISCB will have to begin with consoli-
dation: the immense expansion of activities that has marked the
past 7 years’ history of ISCB has been achieved on the shoulders
of a small staff and many volunteers. Many of those resources
are stretched to the limit and will have to be replenished. One
important step toward this end is the increase in staff. The rev-
enue for this increased bill has to come from new sources. One
source could be an increase in the number of attendance to
ISMB [more details in Rost et al. (2012)]. Simply put, if we
had 800 participants more for the next 7 years, ISCB might be
able to sustain most of its annual spending from the interest of its
assets in 2020. This would constitute a level of stability of its
existence that 7 years ago, we would not even have dreamed of.

Another important goal would be to once again double the
membership base over the next 7 years. I believe that this will
only be possible if we moved to some variant of a ‘federated
society’ in which ISCB is the roof over a federation of many
national and regional societies, groups and activities.
Approaching such a goal is one big challenge ISCB’s next presi-
dent might dare to take on.

Other challenges for the immediate future revert around
themes that have already begun over the past years. For instance,
we need to invest more into smaller meetings. The ISCB-x meet-
ings have taken off and are a solid value that is there to stay. The
newly launched concept of ISCB-focus meetings now needs to
grow more. Ultimately, all of those small meetings should bring
important scientiﬁc value, ample fun and enough revenue to
become sustainable. A tall order for small events that easily out-
grow the resources planned (Rost et al., 2012).

Science revolutionizes technology, technology changes com-
munication, then science has to adapt to what it tread off.
ISCB has embraced such new possibilities much more than
many of its sister societies in FASEB (Federation of American
Societies for Experimental Biology). For instance, the commit-
ment to open access (Lathrop and Rost, 2011a, b) even at the
expense of loosing 25% of its annual revenue was an unusually
bold and unique stance. We were the ﬁrst society that actively
encouraged blogging at a moment at which other societies cur-
tailed this development (Lister et al., 2010a, b). ISCB has begun
to embrace Wikipedia [open competition for writing Wikipedia
pages (Bateman et al., 2012)]. The videos of ISMB talks are now
available for members to download. Impressive start, now ISCB
needs to spearhead new means of communication in science
(videos, movies, YouTube, Wikipedia, social media). A visionary
ISCB will advance online education and meetings, and it
will actively shape the future of communication in science at
the interface of today’s two most rapidly advancing revolutions:
molecular biology and computers.

ISCB has a unique position determined by the immense rap-
idity of the revolutions in its constituents. We are small, we are
young and we have reinvented and renewed ourselves over and
over again for the past two decades. We have comparably little
resources, and it is mind-boggling what we have been able to
achieve with this. Arguably, computational biology is evolving
more rapidly than any other ﬁeld, and it is doing this under
immense pressures to ‘deliver’ solutions. This reality has
marked ISCB in many unique and positive ways.

The class of ISCB fellows has been the latest addition to our
infrastructure. It will hopefully evolve into another foundation
on which the society can stand (along with the current four: staff /
executive committee, BoD, student council and members). ISCB
fellows are the shining stars in the ﬁeld and/or those who have
brought the society forward. The integration of ISCB fellows in
ways that beneﬁt both the fellows and the society may become
another important hook into an even brighter future.

Computational biology has been established at the level of
institutes and inter-department centers. Now the challenge to
address is evolving this new dynamic ﬁeld onto the level of uni-
versity departments. A related task may be the presence on the
level of panels in funding agencies.

In all of this, ISCB will continue to rely on the support of its
members, and those who take matters in their hands and bring us
forward.

ISCB has contributed importantly toward advancing the
understanding of living systems through computation. It has
succeeded through publications, through seeding the community
and aligning it as well as through creating fun and scientiﬁc
excitement. A dynamic young ﬁeld deﬁned by an outstanding
degree of interdisciplinary courage to grow beyond what we
see today and to do this together as a community of scientists.
No doubt that this community will to grow and ﬂourish over the
coming years.

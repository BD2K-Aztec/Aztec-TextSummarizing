Abstract

Summary: Protein—coding genes with multiple alternative polyadenylation sites can generate
mRNA 3’UTR sequences of different lengths, thereby causing the loss or gain of regulatory elem—
ents, which can affect stability, localization and translation efficiency. 3USS is a web—server de—
veloped with the aim of giving experimentalists the possibility to automatically identify alternative
3’UTRs (shorter or longer with respect to a reference transcriptome), an option that is not available
in standard RNA—seq data analysis procedures. The tool reports as putative novel the 3’UTRs not
annotated in available databases. Furthermore, if data from two related samples are uploaded,
common and specific alternative 3’UTRs are identified and reported by the server.

Availability and implementation: 3USS is freely available at http://MMANbiocomputing.it/3uss_

1 Introduction

The 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTRs) of mRNAs play a crucial
role in post—transcriptional regulation. In fact, they contain
cis-regulatory elements, such as AU—rich elements (ARE), microRNA
binding sites, etc. (Khabar, 2005; Bartel, 2009), which can affect
transcript stability, degradation, subcellular localization and transla—
tion. Through alternative polyadenylation, a widespread mechanism
in eukaryotic organisms, different isoforms of the same gene can
acquire alternative (longer or shorter) 3’ untranslated regions (Elkon
et 61]., 2013). The phenomenon seems to be different in different
tissues (Lianoglou et 61]., 2013), during development (Ji et 61]., 2009)
and, recently, it has also been observed in cancer cells (Mayr
and Bartel 2009). With the emergence of next—generation sequencing
technologies, it is now possible to sequence entire transcriptomes
in one experiment. In standard RNA—seq data analysis protocols
the reconstructed transcripts are compared with an annotated
Reference transcriptome. The most commonly used methods

[e.g. Cuffcompare and Cuffmerge (Trapnell et 61]., 2012)] distinguish
known from putative novel isoforms, but they rely on the compari—
son of the intronic structure of the transcripts, thereby do not take
into account reads that might support the existence of alternative
3’UTRs and therefore the existence of putative novel transcripts
with different 3’UTR is not reported to the user. The great interest
for these important regulatory regions is leading to the development
of more sophisticated RNA sequencing library preparation protocols
(the more powerful will be the possibility to entirely sequence the
untranslated region, the more accurate will the reconstruction of pu—
tative novel 3’UTRs be). At the same time, different computational
tools to capture [Lu et 61]., 2013; Wang et 61]., 2014; github.com/vod—
katad/roar (R—package)] and store (compbio.dundee.ac.uk/
polyADB/, mosas.sysu.edu.cn/utr) the 3’ ends of polyadenylated
transcripts have been recently developed. Nevertheless, the identifi—
cation of 3’UTR alternative regions still remains a challenge. 3USS
(3’ UTR Sequence Seeker) is the only available web—server developed

to automatically identify the assembled transcripts with alternative
3’UTRs with respect to the ones in Reference transcriptomes and
provides the user with their nucleotide sequence together with their
genomic coordinates and other information, such as their difference
in length and the corresponding gene. Furthermore, when data from
two related experiments are provided, the reconstructed 3’UTRs of
each biological sample are identified and compared.

2 Description

The server starts the analysis from a transcriptome assembly file ob—
tained by standard computational methods for RNA—seq transcript
reconstruction, such as Cufﬂinks (Trapnell et al., 2012), Scripture
(Guttman et al., 2010) and others. Indeed, the 3USS procedure is in—
dependent from the transcriptome reconstruction method used to
obtain the RNA—seq assembly file as long as the data have been com—
pared with a Reference annotation [such as UCSC (Rhead et al.
2010), NCBI (Pruitt et al., 2014), Ensembl (Flicek et al., 2010),
Gencode (Harrow et al., 2012), etc.] using Cuffcompare or
Cuffmerge (see the Help page for full information). 3USS also per—
mits to easily retrieve the genomic coordinates and sequences of
transcripts already annotated in public databases.

2.1 Input

For identifying RNA—seq assembled transcripts with alternative
3’UTRs with respect to a Reference, the user needs to provide: the
organism and related genome version; the Reference annotation
transcriptome and one or two RNA—seq transcriptome assembly files
(as above described). An example using public data from GEO data—
base (Barrett et al. 2013) is accessible from the 3USS input page.

2.2 Results

Each assembled transcript is processed by selecting the isoforms
sharing the same intron chain of known protein—coding transcripts
in the Reference. The reconstructed 3’UTRs are consequently identi—
fied as the regions located immediately after the stop—codon and can
be directly compared, detecting possible differences in their 3’ UTR
lengths. The alternative 3’UTRs are then compared with already
annotated ones in other databases [the latest available data from
iGenomes (http://cufﬂinks.cbcb.umd.edu/igenomes.html) and
Gencode (Harrow et al., 2012)] to identify putative novel (not yet
annotated) 3’UTRs. The most informative output files that the 3USS
server produces are: a fasta file with the alternative 3’UTR nucleo—
tide sequences and other information in their headers (gene Id, cod—
ing strand, 3’UTR genomic coordinates and length); a list of the
transcripts with their 3’UTR length difference and a list of the alter—
native not yet annotated 3’UTRs (putative novel) in other databases
as well as the annotated ones. The user can also easily visualize the
transcripts in a graphical environment through the UCSC Genome
browser (Kent et al., 2002; see examples in the Supplementary
Material). If an already annotated transcriptome is uploaded as in—
put, the 3’UTR sequences and genomic coordinates of all the pro—
tein—coding transcripts are returned. If the user submits input files
derived from two different related RNA—seq experiments, the 3USS
server compares the alternative 3’UTRs, reporting how they are dis—
tributed across the two biological samples (Fig. 1).

Each transcript with an alternative 3’UTR is associated to its
assembled transcript id (e.g. TCONS_0000X, for Cufﬂinks tran-
scriptome assembly files), and through it, to all the corresponding
analysis results, so that useful information (read coverage,

3 Conclusion

To the best of our knowledge, 3USS is the only available web—server
that can automatically detect the presence of isoforms with alterna—
tive 3’UTRs in the RNA—seq experiment under investigation and
output their genomic coordinates and nucleotide sequences for fur—
ther analysis. Moreover, we believe that a protocol independent
tool, such as the one described here, is useful and not only to retrieve
information on novel 3’UTRs, but also to easily compare the results
of different methods and approaches. Through an easy to use inter—
face, it also allows the comparison of the 3’UTRs of the sequenced
transcripts in different biological conditions. This allows researchers
to further examine genes affected by 3’UTR shortening or lengthen-
ing and, for example identify their biological relevance using public
tools such as FIDEA (D’Andrea et al., 2013) or others, as well as dir—
ectly analyze the novel 3’UTR nucleotide sequences to detect differ—
ences in the presence or absence of regulatory motifs and/or binding
s1tes.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Elementary qux mode (EFM) is a fundamental concept
as well as a useful tool in metabolic pathway analysis. One important
role of EFMs is that every flux distribution can be decomposed
into a set of EFMs and a number of methods to study flux
distributions originated from it. Yet finding such decompositions
requires the complete set of EFMs, which is intractable in genome-
scale metabolic networks due to combinatorial explosion.

Results: In this article, we proposed an algorithm to decompose
flux distributions into EFMs in genome-scale networks. It is an
iterative scheme of a mixed integer linear program. Unlike previous
optimization models to find pathways, any feasible solutions can
become EFMs in our algorithm. This advantage enables the
algorithm to approximate the EFM of largest contribution to an
objective reaction in a flux distribution. Our algorithm is able to
find EFMs of qux distributions with complex structures, closer to
the realistic case in which a cell is subject to various constraints.
A case of Escherichia coli growth in the Lysogeny broth (LB)
medium containing various carbon sources was studied. Essential
metabolites and their syntheses were located. Information on the
contribution of each carbon source not obvious from the apparent
flux distribution was also revealed. Our work further confirms the
utility of finding EFMs by optimization models in genome-scale
metabolic networks.

1 INTRODUCTION

Immediately after the success in genomics, the next step is to ﬁll
the gap between genotypes and phenotypes to have a full picture of
biological systems. The genome—scale metabolic network has been
playing this role and has been found useful in answering biological
questions (Durot et al., 2009). During the past decade, various
methods have been proposed to analyze metabolic networks and
the constraint—based modeling approach is exceptionally prominent
(Durot et al., 2009; Price et al., 2004; Terzer et al., 2009).

One object of particular importance and increasing interest in
the approach is the elementary ﬂux mode (EFM). EFM is an
important theoretical concept as well as a practical tool in metabolic
pathway analysis. Theoretically, it is the minimal operational unit

at steady state in metabolic networks satisfying the thermodynamic
constraint regarding the reversibility of each reaction (Schuster and
Hilgetag, 1994). Practically, EFMs have been applied in a variety
of studies: investigating network structures like network robustness
(Stelling et al., 2002), dynamic properties of pathways (Steuer et al.,
2007), pathway efﬁciency (Carlson, 2007) and modularity (Yoon
et al., 2007), exploring new pathways (de Figueiredo et al., 2009b;
Schuster et al., 1999) and hence suggesting rational strain design
(Klamt and Gilles, 2004; Trinh and Srienc, 2009; Trinh et al., 2008),
predicting mutants’ behavior (Zhao and Kurata, 2009a), identifying
interactions with other networks (Klamt et al., 2006), etc. (reviewed
in Durot et al., 2009; Trinh et al., 2009).

An important interpretation of EFMs is that every ﬂux distribution
V=[V1...Vn]T can be decomposed as a positive sum of a subset
of EFMs {ej} with the ‘no cancelation’ property that all ej have a
particular component being zero wherever v has that component
being zero (Schuster et al., 2002). That is,

v = ijej, wj > 0 and Z(v) CZ(ej) for all j
j

where Z(v)= {ilvi :0} is the index set for the zero components
of V. The ‘no cancelation’ property is unique compared to other
generating sets of the ﬂux space like extreme pathways (EPs)
(Llaneras and Pico, 2010). In many studies, ﬂux distributions are
analyzed by similar decompositions. The ﬁrst attempt is the or—
spectrum to determine the range of attainable weights for each
EP (Wiback et al., 2003). This approach is also applicable to
EFMs. Later, decomposing ﬂux distributions with minimum sum
of weights has been proposed (Schwartz and Kanehisa, 2005)
and applied to study yeast glycolysis (Schwartz and Kanehisa,
2006). Decompositions with respect to other objectives have
also been adopted to investigate particular cases, for instances,
maximum number of active EFMs (Nookaew et al., 2007), minimum
relative error (Wang et al., 2007), maximum yield rate (Song
and Ramkrishna, 2009) and maximum entropy (Zhao and Kurata,
2009b). There are also other studies analyzing ﬂux distributions by
decompositions into EFMs (e. g. Carlson, 2009; Kurata et al., 2007).

These approaches based on decomposing ﬂux distributions,
despite the insights they have provided, have their capabilities
limited because the calculation always requires the complete set
of EFMs in prior given a metabolic network, whose computation
is notoriously hard due to the combinatorial explosion when the
network size grows. This drawback was ﬁrst studied in Klamt and
Stelling (2002) and has been mentioned in many literatures (e.g.
Durot et al., 2009; Trinh et al., 2009; Yeung et al., 2007).

Elementary flux mode

 

To overcome the difﬁculty, efforts have been put to improve the
computational speed and memory demand for computing EFMs. The
ﬁrst algorithm was presented in Schuster et al. (1996). Improvements
have then been made continuously by introducing the nullspace
approach to reduce computational cost (Urbanczik and Wagner,
2005; Wagner, 2004); the binary approach to save a great deal of
memory and allow bit operations (Gagneur and Klamt, 2004); the
elementary testing by matrix rank to accelerate computations (Klamt
et al., 2005); the bit pattern trees to hasten elementary testing (Terzer
and Stelling, 2006) and the latest recursive enumeration approach
based on bit pattern trees (Terzer and Stelling, 2008). Software
implementing these approaches has also been engineered, including
METATOOL (Pfeiffer et al., 1999; von Kamp and Schuster,
2006), F luzAnalyzer (Klamt et al., 2003), CellNetAnalyzer (Klamt
et al., 2007), EFMtool (Terzer and Stelling, 2008). Despite these
improvements, these algorithms still cannot cope with genome—scale
metabolic networks reconstructed recently, usually consisting of at
least a thousand of reactions and metabolites (e.g. Duarte et al.,
2007; Feist et al., 2007).

One characteristic in common of the mentioned approaches to
calculate EFMs is that they all compute the complete set of EFMs
given the network stoichiometry and this is the major reason of
the computational infeasibility in genome—scale networks, because
the size of the full set grows extremely fast (Klamt and Stelling,
2002). As an alternative, recently there have been attempts to
ﬁnd speciﬁc metabolic pathways from stoichiometric information
by optimization modeling. They are able to cope with the scale
and furthermore to identify pathways with speciﬁc requirements.
Beasley and Planes (2007) found pathways matched with literature
by balancing ‘low presence’ compounds and minimizing the
number of reactions involved and ATP consumed. Later by further
considering connectivity of compounds, linear pathways were
located (Planes and Beasley, 2009). Also, the K —shortest EFMs in
genome—scale networks have been calculated successfully by an
optimization model (de Figueiredo et al., 2009a). More recently,
the K —shortest generating ﬂux modes, a subset of EFMs, have also
been investigated by a similar model (Rezola et al., 2010).

In this article, we present an algorithm to ﬁnd a set of EFMs that
decomposes a given ﬂux distribution in a genome—scale metabolic
network without ﬁnding the complete set of EFMs in prior. The
algorithm solves optimization models recursively with data stored
in a stack structure. Its implementation is highly dynamic. By editing
the model being solved, a set of EFMs with certain properties can
be found. In addition to the basic decomposition, the algorithm
can approximate the EFM with largest contribution to a particular
objective reaction in a given ﬂux distribution.

2 METHODS

Given the network stoichiometric matrix S, a ﬂux distribution or equivalently
a ﬂux mode, is a vector v satisfying the steady—state assumption with its
irreversible reactions having non—negative ﬂuxes, i.e.

ve {v|Sv=0,virr :0}.

An EFM by deﬁnition is a ﬂux mode unable to be decomposed as the
sum of two other ﬂux modes, whose active reactions are proper subsets
of those of that ﬂux mode (Schuster and Hilgetag, 1994). This is called non—
decomposability, elementarity or genetic independence. Mathematically, a

ﬂux mode e is an EFM if there are no ﬂux modes v1, vz such that

e=v1+vz with Z(e);Z(v1) and Z(e)§Z(vz).

In this article, if for a ﬂux mode e, such v1, V2 exist, they are said to
be bounded by e. The algorithm proposed exploits this decomposability. In
what follows, ﬁrst, an optimization model to check the decomposability of
a given ﬂux mode is formulated, followed by the algorithm integrating the
model to decompose ﬂux distributions. Then, modiﬁcations of the algorithm
to approximate EFMs of largest contributions are presented.

2.1 Decomposability check

Suppose there is a metabolic network consisting of m metabolites and n
reactions with stoichiometric matrix S = [Sl‘j]. All reactions are assumed
irreversible. This can be done in reality by replacing a reversible reaction by
two irreversible reactions with stoichiometry negative to each other.

The decomposability of a given ﬂux mode v = [v1 mvn]T is determined by
examining whether a ﬂux mode p = [p1 pn]T bounded by v can be found.
First, p must satisfy the usual steady—state condition:

ngpj=0 fori=1,...,m (1)
j=1

Each reaction is assigned with a binary integer variable Clj specifying the
on/off condition by the following constraints:

ajgpj f0rj=1,...,n (2)
ijMSJ-aj forj=1,...,n 

where M is a large positive number and (Sj =1 if vj > 0 and (Sj =0 otherwise.
If aj =0, from (3), we have pj =0 and thus reaction j is not involved, else
if aj= 1, from (2) we have pj :1 and reaction j must has a positive ﬂux.
Constraints similar to (2) and (3) have been employed to ﬁnd pathways
before (Beasley and Planes, 2007; de Figueiredo et al., 2009a; Rezola et al.,
2010). The difference of our approach lies in the introduction of (Sj. If (Sj = 0,
aj and pj are forced to be zero by (2) and (3). In other words, if vj = 0, pj =0.
This implies Z (v) CZ (p), necessary for p to be bounded by v. For the large
number M, it can be interpreted as the greatest stoichiometric ratio allowed
within the ﬂux mode p, so it should be sufﬁciently large to allow all ﬂux
modes bounded by v to satisfy (2) and (3).
To ensure p is non—trivial, i.e. has at least one non—zero ﬂux, we have:

j=1

For p to be properly bounded by v, the number of non—zero ﬂuxes in p must
be less than the number of non—zero ﬂuxes in v, so we have:

ZajSZSj—l (5)
j=1 j=1

Finally, since all reactions are irreversible, all ﬂuxes must be positive:
pj20forj=1,...,n (6)

Constraints (1—6) sufﬁce to deﬁne p as a ﬂux mode bounded by v. Hence,
every objective can work. We simply choose maximizing zero:

max0 (7)

Equations (1)—(7) form a mixed integer linear program, called
Decomposability Check (DC). Given a ﬂux mode v, if any feasible solution
can be found, then v is decomposable. Otherwise, we conclude that v is an
EFM.

Different from de Figueiredo et al. (2009a), p is not required to be
integers though this may lengthen computational time because in some of
our investigations, fractional stoichiometric coefﬁcients are involved, like

the biomass composition, and turning these coefﬁcients into integers will
make them too large in magnitude and inconvenient for computation.

2.2 Decomposition of ﬂux distributions

The algorithm to decompose ﬂux distributions is an iterative scheme of DC.
Flux modes involved are stored in a stack structure. The decomposability of
the given ﬂux distribution is ﬁrst examined by DC. If it is decomposable,
the ﬂux mode bounded by it that is returned by DC will be stacked up and
become the current ﬂux mode. Else if it is non—decomposable, an EFM is
reached and it leaves the stack. The EFM found is then used to update each
intermediate ﬂux mode by subtracting a scalar multiple of the EFM. After
updating, intermediate ﬂux modes unable to contribute to the ﬁrst ﬂux mode
are removed. This procedure is repeated until all ﬂux modes leave the stack.
A set of EFMs decomposing the ﬂux distribution is then obtained.

Let N be the number of ﬂux modes in the stack, K be the number of
EFMs found. The s—th ﬂux mode in the stack is denoted as fms with the ﬂux
of the j—th reaction being ﬁnsj. efmk and efmkj are similarly deﬁned for the
k—th EFM. The steps of the algorithm can be summarized as follows:

Step 0. Initialize with N = 1, K =0 and fml =v. Go to Step 1.

Step 1. Solve DC with me as input. If there is a feasible solution p, go
to Step 2. Otherwise, go to Step 3.

Step 2. Update N by N+ 1. Set me =p. Go to Step 1.

Step 3. Update K by K+ 1. Set eme =me.
If N =1, terminate the algorithm, else go to Step 4.

Step 4. For 5: 1, ...,N— 1, update fms by fms —rSK xeme

where rK =min{ fmsj/emeJ-‘emej > 0}. Go to Step 5.
J

S

Step 5. Remove me from the stack. If N > 2, for S: 2, ...,N — 1, check
if Z (fm1)§Z(fms). If no, remove fms from the stack. Set N to be the

current size of the stack. Go to Step 1.

The algorithm can be interpreted as decomposing fml repeatedly until
fml becomes an EFM. Step 1 checks the decomposability of the current ﬂux
mode me. If a feasible solution exists, the ﬂux mode is not an EFM and
it is replaced by a new ﬂux mode bounded by it which is found by DC as
indicated in Step 2. The procedure is repeated until an EFM is reached.

Once an EFM is found, in Step 3, ﬁrst we check whether it is the only ﬂux
mode in the stack. If it is, this means it is the last EFM and the algorithm is
terminated. Otherwise, it will be used to update all ﬂux modes in the stack as
in Step 4. Note that after each updating step, fml is the ﬂux mode remaining
to be further decomposed. This updating process serves to eliminate the
largest possible ﬂuxes that are able to be contributed by the EFM found in
each preceding ﬂux mode. The number of non—zero entries in each ﬂux mode
is diminished. This step can accelerate computations because there are less
non—zero entries needed to be dealt with in each ﬂux mode. In practice, Step 4
can be efﬁciently performed by matrix multiplications.

After updating ﬂux modes, some intermediate ﬂux modes may have
positive entries that have become zero in fml. The ‘no cancellation’ property
states that these ﬂux modes cannot contribute to fml anymore, so they are
removed from the stack in Step 5, which is carried out by bit operations. In
fact, they can still contribute to v, but it turns out that Steps 4 and 5, besides
saving memory and computational cost, guarantee that the ﬁnally resulting
set of EFMs has the following four nice properties.

The ﬁrst two properties are the ‘denseness’ and ‘uniqueness’ of the
solution. No EFM found is redundant and each EFM has a unique positive
weight in the decomposition. The other two properties of greater theoretical
interest are the linear independence and systemic independence of the
solution set, i.e. the set of solution EFMs forms a linear basis as well as
a convex basis for the ﬂux distribution. These four properties, which follow
from the fact that our algorithm decomposes a ﬂux distribution by stepwise
ﬁnding an EFM and reducing the ﬂux mode, also hold in the original ﬂux
space in which a reversible reaction is not transformed into two irreversible
reactions. They together give an exact role for each EFM in the solution. The
cooperation between different pathways can be clearly revealed. This brings

more exact biological interpretations. These properties are proved and
explained with an example in detail in the Supplementary Material.

There are two major differences of the proposed algorithm compared with
previous optimization models to ﬁnd pathways. First, it is an iterative scheme
to solve optimization models instead of solving a single optimization model.
Second, any feasible solution can ﬁnally become an EFM and optimality is
not necessarily needed. Every optimization objective works. In what follows,
we propose one for a speciﬁc application.

2.3 Approximation of EFMs of largest contributions

In ﬂux balance analysis (FBA), cellular metabolism is assumed to achieve
an optimal state with respect to an objective like the maximum growth rate
(Feist et al., 2007) and ATP production (reviewed in Schuetz et al., 2007).

Conversely, for a ﬂux distribution (maybe experimentally measured, or
simulated by methods other than FBA), if a biologically reasonable objective
of the cell can be assumed, it will be insightful to decompose the ﬂux
distribution into EFMs that have considerable contributions to that objective.
By ‘contribution’, we mean the ﬂux of the objective reaction provided by
an EFM in the ﬂux distribution. Finding largest contributing EFMs can
reveal principal operational modes in cells. We applied our algorithm to
approximate such decompositions with only two modiﬁcations required. The
ﬁrst is the replacement of objective (7) by:

max pjo (70

where jo is the objective reaction that we are interested. The resulting
solution ﬂux mode then has the greatest ﬂux at reaction jo. Nonetheless, the
ﬂux mode can possibly contribute little to fml. This comes to the second
modiﬁcation which replaces constraint (3) by:

ijM/fmljaj f0fj=1,...,l’l 

Here (Sj is replaced by ﬁm j. This takes the ﬂux values of fml into account.
Intuitively, the solution ﬂux mode should have a better contribution because
upper bounds for ﬂuxes are not the same but proportional to the ﬂuxes of fml.
In fact, the stepwise solution has the maximum contribution to the objective
reaction ﬂux in fml among all ﬂux modes bounded by fml. This also forms
the rationale of applying the algorithm to approximate EFMs with largest
contributions: in each step, the best ﬂux mode bounded by the current ﬂux
mode is found until an EFM is reached. Hence, it is a greedy approach. For
the large number M / , it should be chosen large enough to properly scale fml
to allow all feasible ﬂux modes.

2.4 Implementations

Both versions of the optimization model DC [Version 1: objective (7) subject
to constraints (1—6); Version 2: objective (7’) subject to constraints (1—2),
(3’), (4—6)] were solved by ILOG CPLEX®. As for the algorithm, all the
data and operations other than solving optimization models were processed
in MATLAB®. For hardware, all computations were performed in a desktop
computer with a 2.67 GHz CPU and 24 GB of RAM.

3 RESULTS

We applied our algorithm to three metabolic networks of different
sizes. The ﬁrst is the sample network used to demonstrate regulatory
FBA (Covert et al., 2001) and study oz—spectrum (Wiback et al.,
2003). The second is the core metabolic network of E.coli K—12
MG1655 iAF1260 (Feist et al., 2007). It is more realistic with a size
considerably larger than the ﬁrst one. The two networks were used
as benchmarks to validate our algorithm.

To highlight the usefulness of our algorithm complementary to
existing methods, a computational experiment was then conducted.

network (Feist et al., 2007) were used to compare the performance
of our algorithm and EFMtool (Terzer and Stelling, 2008), which
should be the most efﬁcient algorithm to ﬁnd full sets of EFMs up to
the best of our understanding. Finally, a ﬂux distribution simulating
the growth of E. coli in the LB medium (Baev et al., 2006a, b) was
studied.

3.1 Benchmarks

For each of the two networks for benchmarks, we ﬁrst randomly
sampled 2000 ﬂux modes (Almaas et al., 2004), implemented with
the COBRA Toolbox (Becker et al., 2007) and decomposed them
by our algorithm. We then checked whether the solutions were true
EFMs able to be located by EFMtool. For the approximation of
EFMs of largest contributions, we chose the biomass production
or equivalently growth rate as the objective reaction. We checked
the rankings of the EFMs found among the full set of EFMs. The
detailed test procedure can be found in the Supplementary Material.

3.1.] Sample metabolic network There are 20 reactions and 19
metabolites in the sample network. The number of EFMs found by
EFMtool was 82, the same as in Wiback et al. (2003). In their paper,
an algorithm for EPs was used, but since each reversible reaction
was treated as two irreversible reactions, the result coincides with
the set of EFMs (Llaneras and Pico, 2010).

In average, Version 1 of the algorithm took 5 s to decompose a ﬂux
distribution and Version 2 took 6 s. It was veriﬁed that all solutions
belong to the set of EFMs computed by EFMtool.

For Version 2, in 98% of the 2000 samples, EFMs of maximum
contributions to the growth rate in the ﬂux distributions are the ﬁrst
EFMs found. The corresponding percentage for Version 1 is only
~15%. All other solutions by Version 2 except one contain EFMs
of the second or third largest contributions.

3.1.2 Core E.coli K—IZ M01655 iAF1260 metabolic network
The core E. coli metabolic network contains 95 reactions and
72 metabolites. By restricting substrates for uptake of glucose,
phosphate, C02, H+, H20, NH4 and 02 only, over 100 000 EFMs
were found by EFMtool. The number is comparable to previous
studies with similar conﬁgurations (Klamt and Stelling, 2002). One
issue complicating the computation is the fractional stoichiometry in
the biomass reaction estimated from molecular content (Feist et al.,
2007). Magnitudes of coefﬁcients in the reaction highly vary. The
ratio of the greatest to the smallest is 840.

In average, Version 1 of the algorithm took 12s to ﬁnish and
Version 2 took 18 s. All solutions were veriﬁed to be true EFMs.

For Version 2, the greatest contributing EFMs were ﬁrst found in
97% of the 2000 trials. Among all, 80% of the remaining solutions
contain EFMs whose contributions rank top 10%. The success rate
is signiﬁcant in view of the number of different contributions by all
EFMs in each sample, which is over 7000 in average.

The benchmark results for the two networks different in size
show that our algorithm can decompose ﬂux distributions into sets
of EFMs. Furthermore, it is capable of approximating the best
contributing EFM in a ﬂux distribution with respect to a reaction.

are reversible. After compartmentalization and transformation, there
are 1668 metabolites and 3234 irreversible reactions in total.

3.2.] Computational experiment In cell culture experiments,
minimal media containing one carbon source and necessary
inorganic compounds only are often preferred due to the ease in
analysis. Correspondingly, ﬂux distributions of optimal growth rate
simulating these cases consist of only few EFMs regardless of the
network complexity. In this case, existing tools are able to ﬁnd the
set of EFMs that contributes to a ﬂux mode by considering
the subnetwork formed by the active reactions in the ﬂux distribution
(called subnetwork of a ﬂux distribution). Realistic metabolic
ﬂuxes are, however, shaped by factors like gene regulation and in
particular heterogeneous nutrients (Zamboni, 2010). Structures of
ﬂux distributions are thus more complicated and existing tools may
not cope with them. To test the capability of our algorithm to analyze
these cases, we performed a computational experiment.

In the E. coli MG1655 iAF1260 metabolic network, there are 299
possible uptake substrates. In each trial, in addition to inorganic
compounds necessary for growth, a random set of carbon sources,
whose uptake rates 5 1mmol gDW‘1 h‘l, was available and a
ﬂux distribution of optimal growth rate was determined. It was then
decomposed by Version 2 of our algorithm with growth rate as the
objective. Meanwhile, we tried to ﬁnd the full set of EFMs of the
subnetwork of the ﬂux distribution by EFMtool.

In the computational experiment, the number of active reactions
Nr, partially reﬂecting the complexity of a ﬂux distribution,
increases with the number of carbon sources consumed NC linearly.
In general, when NC 2 30, EFMtool was unable to ﬁnd the full set
of EFMs of the subnetwork of the ﬂux distribution. In contrast, our
algorithm succeeded to decompose every test ﬂux distribution.

In certain cases with large Nr in the ﬂux distributions but a
small number of contributing EFMs in the solution found, Neﬁn
(<50), EFMtool was unable to ﬁnd the sets of EFMs of the
subnetworks while our algorithm could ﬁnd EFMs decomposing
the ﬂux distributions in relatively short time (Fig. 1, ‘+’s with small
Nefm). This corresponds to the situation in which a ﬂux distribution

having an enormous number of contributing EFMs can actually be
represented as a convex sum of only a few of those EFMs. Our
algorithm is very useful and efﬁcient in this case. Moreover, the
memory demand is not expensive as the most complicated cases in
the computational experiment can also be solved by our algorithm
in a computer with 2 GB memory only.

The complexity of our algorithm was also examined. The
computational time increases with Neﬁn as well as Nr (Fig. 1).
Regression indicates a satisfactory linear relationship between the
computational time and the product Neﬁn X Nr (R2 =0.97).

The computational experiment showed that our algorithm is more
advantageous than existing methods in analyzing ﬂux distributions
with complex structures, which are closer to realistic cases in which
a cell is subject to complicated factors. Details of the test and test
results are provided in the Supplementary Material.

3.2.2 A case of growth in the LB medium The LB medium, or
usually called Luria—Bertani medium, is one of the most common
complex media used in bacterial growth. It is composed of tryptone,
yeast extract and NaCl. In their studies, Baev et al. monitored
the utilization of sugars, alcohols, organic acids (Baev et al.,
2006a) and amino acids, peptides, nucleotides (Baev et al., 2006b)
indirectly by transcriptional microarrays during the growth of E. coli
MG1655 in the LB medium. Interestingly, during about 3—5h of
fermentation, simultaneous assimilation of a set of carbon sources
was observed (Baev et al., 2006a). Combining the result in Baev
et al. (2006b), a large number of sugars, amino acid and other
carbon sources were absorbed during the time period. We simulated
a ﬂux distribution describing the metabolism of E. coli under such
conditions by optimizing the growth rate in FBA and allowing the
list of carbon sources in Table 1 and some inorganic compounds
for uptake. Maximum oxygen uptake rate (18.5 mmol gDW/h) and
ATP maintenance (ATPM) cost (8.39 mmol gDW/h) under growth
condition determined experimentally in Feist et al. (2007) were
adopted. All maximum uptake rates of carbon sources were set to
be 0.5 mmol gDW/h for simplicity because information on enzyme
capacities was not given. We denote the simulated ﬂux distribution
by f0 to avoid confusion in the following discussion.

f0 consists of 493 reactions and consumes all 25 carbon sources.
To understand the complexity and the difference of f0 due to
multiple sources, we found the maximum ﬂux contribution of each
individual carbon source to f0 by maximizing the sum of ﬂuxes,
setting f0 as the upper bound and allowing only that source for

uptake (Supplementary Material for details). Surprisingly, only three
non—zero ﬂux modes consuming L—fucose, D—lactate and L—lactate,
respectively, were resulted, each veriﬁed to be EFMs by EFMtool.
They together provide the whole ATPM ﬂux in f0 and no single
carbon source is independently consumed for growth.

Meanwhile, we tested whether each carbon source can be
metabolized into biomass by maximizing the growth rate and
allowing the uptake of one source only. All carbon sources except
L—histidine and L—methionine can generate growth independently.

From these two results, we concluded that ﬁrst, more efﬁcient
growth can be achieved by the simultaneous assimilation of the
carbon sources in Table 1 if they are the only sources available.
This may suggest a possible reason for the switch of the mode of
assimilation from a sequential one to a simultaneous one as observed
in Baev et al. (2006a). Second, f0 cannot be simply decomposed into
ﬂux modes of individual carbon sources.

f0 was then simpliﬁed into f1 by subtracting the three EFMs
found. We tried to ﬁnd the set of EFMs of the subnetwork of f1
by EFMtool but it was unsuccessful due to insufﬁcient memory. We
then decomposed f1 by Version 2 of our algorithm. In all, 22 EFMs
were found, all veriﬁed to be true EFMs by EFMtool. The ﬁrst EFM
found, also the one with the largest growth rate in the solution,
accounts for 19% of the growth rate.

All EFMs of growth consume multiple sources simultaneously,
at least 12. The EFMs consist of quite similar sets of reactions.
In fact, among the 482 active reactions in f1, 376 reactions were
found to be shared by all EFMs, called the ‘backbone’ reactions
(Fig. 2). They can be important reactions for optimal growth on
the medium. The structures are complicated, as expected from the
detailed biomass composition containing 63 metabolites. Various
biochemical pathways are involved: glycolysis, pentose phosphate
pathway, non—mevalonate pathway, cell envelope biosynthesis,
glycerophospholipid metabolism, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis,
biosynthesis of different amino acids, cofactor and prosthetic
group, etc. They are connected by branch point metabolites like
pyruvate and chorismate. Interestingly, in the backbone, besides
the uptake of eight extracellular carbon sources, some cytosolic
metabolites are always synthesized in each EFM and then enter
into the backbone acting as source nodes, including L—aspartate,
L—serine, D—glucosamine 6—phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3—phosphate,
D—glucose 6—phosphate, pyruvate, alpha—D—ribose 1—phosphate,
uridine, D—xylulose 5—phosphate. Meanwhile, outside the backbone,
no single extracellular carbon source is used by all EFMs.

Fig. 2. ‘Backbone’ reactions for f1. Sources entering the backbone are in
squares. Metabolites involved in many pathways are in parallelograms.
Metabolites comprising biomass are in bold and italic text. Independent
intersecting edges are bolded for clarity. Small molecules, cofactors and
their reactions are not shown for simplicity. Abbreviations are the same as
in Feist et al. (2007).

This means that these cytosolic sources of the backbone must be
ﬁrst synthesized regardless of the carbon sources. Hence, the ability
to synthesize them may reﬂect the efﬁciency of the cell’s growth.
Of the ﬁve EFMs with the largest growth rate (accounting for 80%
of the growth rate in total), the reactions outside the backbone are
shown in Figure 3, from which different pathways to synthesize
those necessary cytosolic metabolites entering the backbone can
be seen. All EFMs are in general different arrangements of these
pathways to strike delicate balance to produce biomass.

We further looked into the contribution of each carbon source.
The ‘marginal relative contribution’ of each carbon source was
calculated by summing up the relative contribution by that source in
each EFM (Supplementary Material). The carbon source with largest
relative contribution to biomass is N -acetyl-glucosamine with over
5.4% and L-histidine has the lowest contribution with only 0.9%.
The information cannot be obtained from f0 or f1 alone in which
nearly all uptake ﬂuxes of carbon sources are equal. The value of
the marginal relative contribution, however, seems to change with
the non-unique decomposition by EFMs. A further analysis will be
needed to formally address this issue.

Fig. 3. Reactions outside the backbone of the top ﬁve EFMs contributing
to growth. Extracellular sources are in squares. ‘BF’ stands for ‘backbone
ﬂuxes’. Legend for EFMs (source to sink is from left to right): ﬁrst:
connecting lines vertically; second: connecting lines with open circle; third:
connecting lines with arrow; fourth: reaction name bold and italic; ﬁfth:
reaction name underscored. Independent intersecting edges are bolded for
clarity. Small molecules, cofactors and their reactions are not shown for
simplicity. Abbreviations are the same as in Feist et al. (2007).

It is remarked that the above analysis focuses on f0 and f1. In-
depth studies are required to prove the claims from it. For example,
alternative optimal ﬂux distributions and different maximum uptake
rates chosen may alter the results on the dependence of carbon
sources and the necessity of certain metabolites. Still, the resolution
brought by the present decomposition has revealed some information
not observed from the apparent ﬂux distribution.

4 CONCLUSION

In this article, we presented an algorithm which solves MILPs
iteratively to decompose a ﬂux distribution into EFMs in genome—
scale metabolic networks. One advantage of the algorithm is the
elementarity of solutions independent of the optimality of MILPs.
The objective function can then be used for other purposes and
we suggested approximating the largest contributing EFMs in ﬂux
distributions.

We demonstrated the ability of the algorithm to decompose
ﬂux distributions into EFMs and approximate EFMs with largest

contributions to ﬂux distributions in genome—scale metabolic
networks. In particular, complementary to existing methods, it can
ﬁnd EFMs of ﬂux distributions with complex structures. The case
of growth of E.coli on the LB medium gives an exemplary ﬂux
distribution with a complex structure in which a simultaneous mode
of assimilation of carbon sources is seen. By our algorithm, essential
reactions and metabolites, contribution of carbon sources of the ﬂux
distribution were studied under the resolution of the decomposition
by EFMs. We conclude that the algorithm can facilitate metabolic
pathway analysis in genome—scale metabolic networks. It provides
an analytic method that prepares for the future breakthrough in
experimental techniques to measure in viva ﬂuxes in a huge scale.

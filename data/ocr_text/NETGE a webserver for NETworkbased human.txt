Abstract

Motivation: Gene enrichment is a requisite for the interpretation of biological complexity related to
specific molecular pathways and biological processes. Furthermore, when interpreting NGS data
and human variations, including those related to pathologies, gene enrichment allows the inclu-
sion of other genes that in the human interactome space may also play important key roles in the
emergency of the phenotype. Here, we describe NET-GE, a web server for associating biological
processes and pathways to sets of human proteins involved in the same phenotype

Results: NET-GE is based on protein—protein interaction networks, following the notion that for a
set of proteins, the context of their specific interactions can better define their function and the
processes they can be related to in the biological complexity of the cell. Our method is suited to ex-
tract statistically validated enriched terms from Gene Ontology, KEGG and REACTOME annotation
databases. Furthermore, NET-GE is effective even when the number of input proteins is small.
Availability and Implementation: NET-GE web server is publicly available and accessible at http://
net-ge.biocomp.unibo.it/enrich.

1 Introduction

Big Data production in biomedicine is rapidly changing the way in
which molecular knowledge is translated into health care (Bender,
2015). The spread and establishment of High Throughput Sequencing
(HTS) technologies allows retrieving lists of interesting variations
characterizing the investigated phenotype. In the context of functional
genomics, each phenotype needs annotations for reconciling vari-
ations with known and putatively common biological processes and
pathways, such as Gene Ontology (GO Consortium, 2015), KEGG
(Kanehisa et al., 2016), REACTOME (Fabregat et al., 2016). At this
level of biological complexity, a set of genes and their variations can
acquire biological meaning and feature annotation only with an

enrichment procedure (Laukens et al., 2015). Enrichment helps in
identifying within a set of genes some statistically significant and
over-represented annotation features. Standard enrichment methods
rely on the statistical over representation of the annotations that
characterize the genes in the input set. Alternatively, network-based
approaches extract graph properties from different interaction net-
works and pathways for modelling the complexity of the processes
occurring in the cell and exploit this information for accomplishing
the annotation enrichment in the context of protein functional inter-
action. Lists of web sites are available (Huang et al., 2009; Laukens
et al., 2015; Mooney and Wilmot, 2015 ). Here, we introduce NET-
GE, a web server that implements our method (Di Lena et al.,

2015 ), based on the extraction of subnetworks connecting proteins
that share the same functional terms from a protein—protein inter-
action (PPI) network (Szklarczyk et al., 2015 ). Differently from
other methods also based on networks, our approach extracts mod-
ules that are function-specific by constructions and include all the
seeds (proteins annotated with the same term) that in the PPI net-
work are related to a specific functional annotation. One peculiarity
of NET-GE is the possibility to enrich terms that are not present in
the annotation of the starting protein set (and thus not detectable
through a standard enrichment). When tested on the OMIM-derived
benchmark sets, NET-GE is able to enrich sets of genes related to
the same disease with biologically meaningful terms neglected by
other methods (Di Lena et al., 2015). The server, in addition, allows
annotation based on KEGG and REACTOME pathways and a com-
parison between standard and network based enrichment.

2 NET-GE

NET-GE includes precomputed subsets of proteins associated to
each functional terms of interest (Di Lena et al., 2015). Subnetwork
construction is based on the human interactome map downloaded
from STRING (release 10.0, http://string-db.org/), or from a filtered
version that retains only links with a score 2 0.9. Presently STRING
includes 15,632 nodes (mapping 18 721 HGNC gene names, http://
www.genenames.org/ and 89 085 UniProtKB identifiers) and
307 413 links (in the high quality STRING 0.9 version nodes and
links are 9422 and 80 112, respectively).

In the present implementation of NET-GE, annotations are how-
ever available for all the 104 569 UniProtKB identifiers (release
2016_01), corresponding to 22 390 genes. The databases for anno-
tating features are GENE ONTOLOGY (from UniProt-GOA human
145 resource, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA); KEGG PATHWAY
(release 77.0, http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html); REACTOME
PATHWAY (release 53, http://www.reactome.org/). Redundancy
among terms is not taken into consideration.

When generating the annotating subnetworks, for each annota-
tion term we collect the seeds and evaluate the quality of the con-
necting nodes among seeds (for more details, see Supplementary Fig.
15). After constraining seed distance, we determine the subset asso-
ciated to a specific annotation term by retaining the minimal con-
necting subnetwork (Di Lena et al., 2015 ). Considering STRING,
NET-GE presently includes 20 391 annotation subsets (see http://
net-ge.biocomp.unibo.it/enrich/statistics), 14 845 of which contain
from two to 10 700 genes. The number of genes per subset is inversely
proportional to the information content and the most informative
terms correspond to small networks (Fig. 1).

The server implements both a standard and a network-based gene
enrichment. Given a gene/protein list, each gene/protein is located in
the different subsets of the annotation database. With a Fisher’s exact
test, the method estimates the overrepresentation significance of input
genes/proteins in each precomputed subset for the corresponding an-
notation term. Standard enrichment includes only annotations of seed
nodes; network-based enrichment includes seeds and their connecting
nodes. For multiple testing correction, we use both the Bonferroni and
the Benjamini-Hochberg (False Discovery Rate, FDR) procedures and
evaluate a corrected p-value (Noble, 2009). Updating of the system,
including human interactome and annotation databases is planned
once a year, following the major releases.

notation (GO terms, KEGG, REACTOME); (iii) the multiple testing
correction methods (Bonferroni or the Benjamini-Hochberg correc-
tion); (iv) the significance threshold.

The output lists two enrichment tables: one for the standard and
one for the network-based method (see the online tutorial for more
details). Each table contains the annotation term identifier, linked to
the corresponding database; the number and the list of input genes/
proteins associated to the term; the P-value of the association; the
description of the term and for the network based enrichment a visu-
alization of the subnetwork. Enriched terms not included in the an-
notations of the input gene/protein are highlighted with a double
star (see on line tutorial). It is also possible to access the complete
set of annotations (for both the enrichment modes) of the submitted
genes/proteins through the link provided at the bottom of the page.
The front-end for the Web server follows the Model-View-
Controller (MVC) paradigm, thanks to the web2py framework
(http://www.web2py.com/), and it is optimized to work with all
common web browsers. The analysis runs asynchronously: after
submitting the query, the server displays a bookmarkable page re-
porting the status of the job. This page is periodically updated. A
link to the results, accessible as soon as the job is completed, is given
to the user. The final visualization of the results exploits the
Graphviz library (http://www.graphviz.org/) and the JavaScript

address used to alert her/him as soon as results are ready. Running
time depends on size of the input set (from two up to 200 genes) and
ranges about 1—5 min.

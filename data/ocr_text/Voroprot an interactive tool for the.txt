ABSTRACT

Summary: We present Voroprot, an interactive cross-platform
software tool that provides a unique set of capabilities for
exploring geometric features of protein structure. Voroprot allows
the construction and visualization of the Apollonius diagram (also
known as the additiver weighted Voronoi diagram), the Apollonius
graph, protein alpha shapes, interatomic contact surfaces, solvent
accessible surfaces, pockets and cavities inside protein structure.
Availability: Voroprot is available for Windows, Linux and
Mac OS X operating systems and can be downloaded from
http://www.ibt.It/bioinformatics/voroprot/.

1 INTRODUCTION

The ability to analyze and visualize geometric features of 3D protein
structure is fundamental for studies of protein folding, residue
packing, docking, protein—protein interactions, etc. Considering
protein structure to be a set of points, each point corresponding
to an atom, the use of the Voronoi diagram (Voronoi, 1908) and
its dual, the Delaunay triangulation (Delaunay, 1934), offers a
powerful approach in such analysis (Poupon, 2004). However, a
more realistic representation of an atom is not a point, but the sphere
of a Van der Waals radius. Considering protein structure to be a set
of spheres, the more appropriate geometric data structures are the
Apollonius diagram (also known as additively weighted Voronoi
diagram) (Emiris and Karavelas, 2006) and its dual, Apollonius
graph. Yet, so far both have been exploited for protein structure
analysis only to a limited extent.

One of the few available tools, Voronoia (Rother et al., 2009),
uses the additively weighted Voronoi diagram to investigate protein
structure packing. It is mainly a console tool, which provides a
simpliﬁed drawing of inner cavities through a PyMOL plug—in, but
does not allow a more advanced visualization. We are aware of
two other reports describing the use of the Apollonius diagram for
the visualization and analysis of protein structure (Kim et al., 2005;
Will, 1998), but the corresponding software is not publicly available.
Other reported tools do not exploit the Apollonius diagram. For
example, Voro3D (Dupuis et al., 2005) uses an extension of the
Voronoi tessellation of points. Its main drawback is that it represents
each residue by a single point. Another program, PROVAT (Gore
et al., 2005), integrates Qhull (a tool used to compute Voronoi
diagram of points) and PyMOL into a pipeline. Unfortunately, it

seems to be no longer publicly available. PyDeT (Ordog, 2008) also
uses Qhull and PyMOL, but it only provides visualization of the
Delaunay triangulation of protein structure.

Thus, although the Apollonius diagram and the Apollonius graph
are powerful geometric constructs, their potential in studies of
protein structure is far from being fully utilized. To remedy this
situation, we developed Voroprot, a versatile protein structure
analysis and visualization tool.

2 METHODS

Protein atoms are represented as spheres of Van der Waals radii. Accordingly,
protein 3D structure is a geometric object formed by such spheres. We
subdivide this object into quadruples of spheres, making sure that no tangent
sphere of any quadruple overlaps any atom sphere. The subdivision is similar
to the Delaunay triangulation, except that spheres are used instead of points
and tangent spheres are used instead of circumspheres. We then construct a
graph with atoms as vertices, where atoms are linked if they share at least
one quadruple. This graph is known as the Apollonius graph (Emiris and
Karavelas, 2006). It unequivocally deﬁnes a set of neighbors for each atom.

For each pair of neighboring atoms, we can deﬁne a hyperboloid, such
that any point belonging to it is equidistant from both atoms. For each atom
at, intersection of all the hyperboloids between at and its neighbors deﬁnes
a space area, called the Voronoi cell (Goede et al., 1997), consisting of all
points closer to 05 than to any other atom. Such a tessellation, known as the
additively weighted Voronoi diagram or the Apollonius diagram (Emiris and
Karavelas, 2006), is similar to the Voronoi tessellation, except that spheres
are used instead of points and hyperboloids are used instead of planes.
Notably, the vertexes of each Voronoi cell are the centers of tangent spheres
of quadruples from the previously described subdivision. For atoms at the
protein surface, tangent spheres can be very large and Voronoi cells can be
unbounded extending away from the protein surface.

We use the Apollonius graph and the Apollonius diagram to construct
interatomic contact surfaces and a solvent—accessible surface. Having a
protein structure subdivided into quadruples of atoms, we can also ﬁnd
internal cavities and pockets. A quadruple is a part of a cavity only if its
tangent sphere cannot be accessed from the outside by a probe of the size of
the solvent molecule (a larger probe can be used to ﬁnd pockets). We also use
a concept of Alpha Shape (Edelsbrunner and Mijcke, 1994) in combination
with the Apollonius graph to construct a triangulated representation of 3D
protein structure. This representation is useful in the analysis of the curvature
of protein structure surface.

In Voroprot, every constructed geometric object can be visualized.
Voroprot is also capable of producing publication—quality images. The
software is a stand—alone application written in C++ using Qt framework;
3D rendering is implemented using OpenGL.

3 USAGE EXAMPLES

Let us explore the 3D structure of recombinant human muscle fatty
acid—binding protein (PDB id: 2HMB) with Voroprot. We load the

structure ﬁle directly from PDB and construct an Apollonius diagram
for it. We then select the ligand and display the Voronoi cells of
its atoms colored in several ways (Fig. 1A—C). By clicking on
the faces of Voronoi cells, we can identify the atoms that are the
ligand neighbors. We also construct and display interatomic contact
surfaces (Fig. 1D). We select and display two amino acids, Phel6
and Ala75, which have relatively large contact areas with the ligand
(Fig. 1E). Additionally, we display the unoccupied space around the
ligand using tangent spheres representation (yellow, Fig. 1F). Now
let us load the same structure without the ligand. We construct the
Apollonius diagram and display the Voronoi cells for Phel6 and
Ala75 to see how the space is distributed between them (Fig. 1G).

Then we construct inner cavities and pockets with rolling probes of
various sizes to ﬁnd possible ligand binding sites. As expected, we
ﬁnd a big cavity, whose shape resembles the ligand and which is
located in the place of the ligand (Fig. 1H).

Another example illustrates the level of detail that can be analyzed
with Voroprot. Let us compare the cavities of the two crystal
structures of prokaryotic phospholipase A2, 1FAZ and 1LWB,
solved correspondingly at 1.4 and 1.05 A resolution. The structures
are very similar, producing the backbone root mean square deviation
(RMSD) of 0.09 A and the all—atom RMSD of 0.40 A. We use
Voroprot to ﬁnd cavities inside these structures with a rolling probe
of 0.8 A radius (smaller than the radius of a water molecule, 1.4 A).
The identiﬁed cavities of lLWB (Fig. 11) differ signiﬁcantly from the
cavities of 1FAZ (Fig. 1]). Voroprot allows us to explain the observed
differences. For example, if we select the residues surrounding the
largest cavity in lLWB and compare their side chain conformations
with the conformations of the same residues in 1FAZ, we discover
that the residue Ile84 acts as a gate. In 1LWB, its side chain blocks
the rolling probe of 0.8 A radius from entering the inter-residue
space, which is thus treated as a cavity, while in 1FAZ a different
rotamer of Ile84 does not hinder the probe from entering.

4 CONCLUSION

The Apollonius graph and the Apollonius diagram extensively
exploited by Voroprot not only enable various representations of
protein structure but also provide powerful analytical methods of
solving complex computational geometry problems such as the
detection of inner cavities, the delineation of interatomic contact
areas and the surface curvature analysis.

Abstract

Summary: We present Cas—Designer, a user—friendly program to aid researchers in choosing appro—
priate target sites in a gene of interest for type II CRISPR/Cas—derived RNA—guided endonucleases,
which are now widely used for biomedical research and biotechnology. Cas—Designer rapidly pro—
vides the list of all possible guide RNA sequences in a given input DNA sequence and their poten—
tial off—target sites including bulge—type sites in a genome of choice. In addition, the program
assigns an out—of—frame score to each target site to help users choose appropriate sites for gene
knockout. Cas—Designer shows the results in an interactive table and provides user—friendly filter

functions.

1 Introduction

Targeted genome editing based on the type II clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and
CRISPR—associated (Cas) protein system from the prokaryotic adap—
tive immune response is now widely used for biomedical research
and biotechnology (Kim and Kim, 2014). CRISPR RNA-guided
endonucleases (RGENs) consist of the Cas9 protein and guide
RNAs (gRNAs), which are provided as two small RNAs [sequence—
variable chNA and invariable trans—activating CRISPR RNA
(trachNA)] or as single—chain gRNAs in which essential portions of
chNA and trachNA are linked. RGENs cleave target DNA in a
sequence—dependent manner; the repair of the resulting double—
strand breaks (DSBs) by endogenous mechanisms gives rise to
targeted genome modifications in cells and whole organisms. In add—
ition to the base pairing between gRNAs and target DNA, Cas9 also
contributes to RGEN specificity by recognizing a protospacer—
adjacent motif (PAM) downstream of the gRNA target sequence.
Cas9 proteins derived from different organisms recognize distinct
PAM sequences. However, RGENs can also cleave off—target DNA
sites with several mismatches (Cho et 61]., 2014; Fu et 61]., 2013) or

with missing or additional nucleotides (Lin et 61]., 2014), compared
to gRNA sequences.

We and others have presented computer programs that help
researchers choose appropriate target sites for Cas9 nucleases (Aach
et 61]., 2014; Cradick et 61]., 2014; Doench et 61]., 2014; Bae et 61]., 2014a;
Heigwer et 61]., 2014; Hsu et 61]., 2013; Lei et 61]., 2014; Montague et 61].,
2014; O’Brien and Bailey, 2014; Naito et 61]., 2014; Sander et 61]., 2010;
Upadhyay and Sharma, 2014; Xie et 61]., 2014; Zhu et 61]., 2014). To the
best of our knowledge, however, there is no web—based tool for provid—
ing the list of all possible gRNAs in a given input DNA sequence with
their potential off—target sites with a DNA or RNA bulge in a genome of
choice and with customizable PAM sequences appropriate for Cas9
derived from species other than S. pyogenes.

Here we present Cas—Designer, a quick gRNA designing tool for
various type II Cas9 nucleases, which lists all possible gRNA se—
quences from a given input DNA sequence along with their potential
off—target sites in a genome of interest. Notably, Cas—Designer rap—
idly searches for potential off—target sites with a DNA or RNA bulge
(Fig. 1A). Furthermore, Cas—Designer provides an out—of—frame
score (Bae et 61]., 2014b) for each gRNA to help choose appropriate

ample of an output table. Cas-Designer shows all possible gRNAs from input sequences along with useful information (top). If a user clicks on a blue colored
number, word, or phrase, more detailed information, such as DNA (middle) or RNA (bottom) bulge targets, is provided. In addition, a user can obtain the relevant
genomic information via the Ensembl genome browser (Flicek et al., 2011), by clicking on the ‘lnfo at Ensembl' button

sites for gene knockout. Cas—Designer is available as a command—
line program or at our website.

2 Implementation
2.1 gRNA selection

First, Cas—Designer finds possible target sites with a user—defined
PAM sequence [5’ —NGG—3’ or 5’—NRG—3’ for SpCas9, 5’—
NNAGAAW-3’ for StCas9 (Cong et al., 2013), 5’-NNNNGMTT-3’
for NmCas9 (Hou et al., 2013) and 5’—NNGRRT—3’ for SaCas9
(Ran et al., 2015)] in a given DNA sequence. Second, Cas—Designer
rapidly calculates the microhomology—associated out—of—frame score
that is positively correlated with the frequency of frame—shift muta—
tions (Bae et al., 2014b). Cas—Designer shows cleavage positions,
GC content and out—of—frame scores in this step. The tool also shows
target sequences that contain more than four thymidine nucleotides
in tandem in gray to indicate that these sequences are often recog—
nized by RNA polymerase III as transcription termination signals
(Braglia et al., 2005).

2.2 Searching for potential off—target sites

Next, Cas—Designer invokes Cas—OFFinder (Bae et al., 2014a) to
rapidly identify potential off—target sites in a user—defined genome.
To find potential off—target sites with a DNA or RNA bulge, we
used a simple brute—force approach as shown in Figure 1B. Briefly,
the program inserts up to three additional ‘N’ nucleotides or deletes
up to 3 nucleotides in the target sequence to identify potential off—
target sites with a DNA bulge or an RNA bulge, respectively. To
this end, we developed a lightweight wrapper script of Cas—
OFFinder written in Python, which can be separately downloaded at
our website.

Because this step is the most time—consuming, we focused on im—
proving Cas—OFFinder to achieve faster analysis. First, a new version
now supports a 2 bit sequence format, which is smaller in size than
is a FASTA format. Second, the internal OpenCL (Open Computing
Language) kernels now use the local memory of the graphic card ra—
ther than the global memory. Third, the new version now uses
atomic operation in OpenCL kernels and OpenMP (Open Multi—
Processing) in the CPU operating part. These changes reduced the

average analysis time per target by a factor of about 30
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

2.3 Output tables and filter options

Cas—Designer shows the results in an interactive table as shown in
Figure 1C. A user can click on a blue—colored number or a ‘Show’
button to access the genomic loci of potential off—target sites.

In addition, we implemented a user-friendly filter function on
the results page for convenience. Output data can be filtered accord—
ing to GC content, out—of—frame scores, or mismatch numbers. The
filtered results are shown immediately, without whole—page refresh—
ing, by using the AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and Extensible
Markup Language) web development technique.

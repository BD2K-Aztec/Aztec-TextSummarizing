Abstract

Motivation: Macromolecular structures and interactions are intrinsically heterogeneous, temporally
adopting a range of configurations that can confound the analysis of data from bulk experiments. To
obtain quantitative insights into heterogeneous systems, an ensemble—based approach can be em—
ployed, in which predicted data computed from a collection of models is compared to the observed
experimental results. By simultaneously fitting orthogonal structural data (e.g. small—angle X—ray
scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance residual dipolar couplings, dipolar electron—electron reson—
ance spectra), the range and population of accessible macromolecule structures can be probed.
Results: We have developed MESMER, software that enables the user to identify ensembles that can
recapitulate experimental data by refining thousands of component collections selected from an in—
put pool of potential structures. The MESMER suite includes a powerful graphical user interface
(GUI) to streamline usage of the command—line tools, calculate data from structure libraries and per—
form analyses of conformational and structural heterogeneity. To allow for incorporation of other
data types, modular Python plugins enable users to compute and fit data from nearly any type of
quantitative experimental data.

Results: Conformational heterogeneity in three macromolecular systems was analyzed with
MESMER, demonstrating the utility of the streamlined, user—friendly software.

1 Introduction

 

Changes in macromolecular structure over a range of timescales are
intrinsic to many biological processes, and by definition produce
structural heterogeneity Within a defined timeframe (Henzler-
Wildman and Kern, 2007). Such structural heterogeneity plays a
role in functions as diverse as molecular recognition (Boehr et 61].,
2009; Lange et 61]., 2008), catalysis (Clare et 61]., 2008; Eisenmesser
et 61]., 2005), transport (Rout and Aitchison, 2001), regulation
(Tang et 61]., 2007) and allostery (McElroy et 61]., 2002). This hetero—
geneity presents unique challenges for structural characterization, as
analytical tools that probe molecular structure involve measure—
ments over defined time Windows, thereby providing at the extremes

either snapshots reflecting the uniqueness of the populations, or a
weighted average of the eXisting configurations. A further complica-
tion is that many functionally important states are short—lived
or lowly populated, eXisting amidst a diverse background of
other states and intermediates (Andersson et 61]., 2009; Henzler—
Wildmanet 61]., 2007; Krukenberg et 61]., 2008). Therefore, in order
to understand the mechanistic details of biological processes, it is
often necessary to appreciate the range of structural configurations
adopted by the system.

One approach to describing these configurations and their abun—
dance is to fit experimental structural data against the predicted values
obtained from ensembles of possible structures. Ensemble—based

techniques identify one or more pools of structures, typically gener—
ated by sampling potential conformations that are able to recapitulate
experimental data (Bernado et 61]., 2007; Bertini et 61]., 2010; Boura
et 61]., 2011; Pelikan et 61]., 2009). This approach has been applied to a
range of structural problems using one of several publically available
software packages, such as BILBOMD (Pelikan et 61]., 2009), EOM
(Bernado et 61]., 2007) and BSS—SAXS (Yang et 61]., 2010), all of which
were developed for analyzing small—angle X—ray scattering (SAXS) or
neutron scattering data. Due to the intrinsic limitations in temporal
and spatial resolution of structural methods, improved accuracy in
modeling can often be obtained by simultaneous fitting of data ob—
tained from orthogonal experimental techniques. Globally fitting such
data plays an important role in increasing sensitivity, removing tech-
nique—specific bias and cross validation (Beechem, 1992; Marsh and
Forman—Kay, 2012). Global-fit ensemble modeling has been imple—
mented in a number of command line—driven software packages,
including EROS (Rozycki et 61]., 2011) and SES (Berlin et 61]., 2013),
and some with user—friendly interfaces such as ﬂexible—meccano
(Ozenne et 61]., 2012) and ENSEMBLE (Marsh and Forman-Kay,
2012), which are specifically designed for incorporation of nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) restraints to characterize intrinsically
disordered proteins.

We describe MESMER, a software package for identifying
and analyzing ensembles that fit bulk—average experimental data
obtained from a range of experimental techniques such as SAXS,
NMR (residual dipolar couplings, RDCs; pseudocontact shifts,
PCS) and dipolar electron—electron resonance (DEER) spectra.
Because fitting is handled through modular plugins, MESMER
can be readily extended to incorporate nearly any kind of experi-
mental structural data, provided that a quantitative comparison
can be made between the experimental and predicted data gener—
ated from components of an ensemble. The MESMER package
also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that streamlines the
process of generating necessary input data, running calculations
and interpreting results.

2 Methodology

MESMER facilitates the analysis of heterogeneous experimental
data and interpretation by:

° Calculation of all predicted data from input structures without
signiﬁcant user intervention

° Simultaneous ﬁtting of multiple data types and experimental
conditions

° Selection of multiple ensemble solutions

° Visualization of structural attributes and relationships

MESMER takes as input a collection of protein data bank
(PDB) files from which predicted experimental data are computed
and saved as ‘component’ files, one per candidate structure.
These precomputed data are rapidly accessed from memory as
necessary during fitting. The overall workflow is illustrated in
Figure 1. MESMER simultaneously fits experimental data ob—
tained from one or more experimental conditions by collecting
the datasets into ‘target’ files that are to be recapitulated from
the provided component structures. This enables users to investi—
gate the effects of experimental variables, such as temperature or
ligand concentration, on the prevalence of ensemble components.
During fitting, the predicted observable of the ensemble <Ypred>
for each type of data is computed from the predicted observa—
tions <Y,~> of each component present in the ensemble using the

Fig. 1. Schematic overview of MESMER workflow. From each of a starting
pool of Zstructural candidates, the predicted counterpart data for available
experiments is calculated and compiled into component files as input. A total
of N ensembles, each containing M components are then assembled, initially
randomly, from the pool of available components. The ability of each ensem-
ble to recapitulate the available experimental data dictates its relative fitness
for the cyclic genetic algorithm, ensuring components that contribute to ac-
curate fits persist for future iterations (Color version of this figure is available
at Bioinformatics online.)

coefficient 6,- to describe the relative contribution (i.e. concentra—
tion) of each component (1):

M
<Ypred> = Z Ci<Yi> (1)

In practice, the number of independent degrees of freedom is
increased by expanding the ensemble size M until additional compo—
nents no longer result in a significant improvement to fit quality.
An implicit assumption of the minimal ensemble method is that ex—
change between states that contribute to the observed signal occurs
at a rate slower than the time resolution of the experimental meas-
urement; otherwise, a single population—weighted average structure
would generate acceptable fits to the experimental data.

If more than one target (i.e. collection of datasets corresponding
to a unique set of conditions) is provided, these are fit using the
same ensembles, but the relative concentrations of components in
each ensemble are optimized separately. During development and
testing, we found that a Newtonian conjugate—gradient type opti—
mization (Nash, 1984) of c,- rapidly converges to acceptable solu—
tions for small ensembles (M<10), while stochastic optimizers

Minimal ensemble solutions to multiple experimental restraints

1953

 

(Gentle et 61]., 2004) provide rapid yet acceptable results for larger
ensembles. These and several additional minimization algorithms
are available in MESMER. The overall score of each ensemble,
Stow], is obtained by summing the goodness—of—fit metrics that quan—
tify the agreement between the predicted and experimental data
acquired at T different experimental conditions for each of the K
data types, for example (2):

T K
Stotal : Z Zwkl<YeXp >jk _ (Ypred>jkl (2)
i k

The weighting factor wk is used to avoid overemphasis of one
data type at the expense of the others, except for cross—validation
purposes. Because various structural techniques have different in-
trinsic resolving power, weights are best assigned according to a pri-
ori knowledge of the precision of the measurement or rigorous cross
validation. In practice, we have found it valuable to initially fit each
dataset individually, thereby determining the quality of fits to the
unweighted experimental data, as well inspect the resulting features
of the selected ensemble components.

3 Algorithms

MESMER implements a genetic algorithm in order to iteratively re—
fine ensembles via their predicted agreement with experimental
data. Before fitting begins, MESMER generates N ensembles of M
components drawn at random from the available pool of compo—
nents (Fig. 1). Selecting an appropriate total number of ensembles
(N) is important, as a small ensemble population may converge too
quickly, while an excessively large population will demand excessive
computer resources. In practice, this parameter is adjusted according
to the population heterogeneity upon convergence, which is
described later. Once the component concentrations of each ensem—
ble in the ‘parent’ generation have been optimized and the resulting
fitness score for each ensemble has been obtained, the pool is dupli—
cated to form a ‘child’ generation. The child generation is diversified
through two mechanisms: Crossing, in which a percentage of an en—
semble’s components are exchanged with the components of another
ensemble and mutation, in which a single component of an ensemble
is replaced with a different component, either from components
existing in the ensemble pool, or from the pool of unused compo—
nents. This process is illustrated in Supplementary Figure S1. The
frequency of mutation and crossing are handled stochastically, with
a user—specifiable rate for each process. After crossing and mutation
are complete, the component concentrations for each of the child en-
sembles are optimized to minimize their respective scores, and the N
best fitting ensembles from the 2 N combined parent and child pools
are used as the parent population for the next generation
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

3.1 Convergence

For an oversampled and structurally diverse pool of starting compo—
nents, there may be hundreds or even thousands of component combin—
ations that provide fits of comparable quality to the experimental data.
Rather than allowing the genetic algorithm in MESMER to drive to a
single solution that is not justified by the limited precision of the input
data, a pool of comparable ensembles, each containing M components,
are retained by stopping the algorithm when either the poorest—fitting en-
semble has a total score Stow) within the certainty in the experimental
data (e.g. if a priori knowledge is available about what value constitutes
an accurate fit), or when the residual standard deviation (RSD) of scores
for the ensembles in the pool is below a specified value. We have found

a 1% RSD to provide ensembles with practically indistinguishable fits to
the experimental data. In fact, the number of unique solutions may pro—
vide valuable information about the sampling of conformation space, as
poor diversity in the final ensemble pool can be diagnostic for poor di—
versity in the starting structural library. In practice, oversampling of con-
formation space may be difficult, especially in the case of molecules with
multiple ﬂexible domains or large unstructured loops, thus, assessment
of the diversity of the input structural pool should be assessed before in—
terpreting the results of any ensemble refinement.

Although the genetic algorithm can rapidly identify solutions
from a large number of possibilities, it can also lead to an underesti—
mation of structural diversity, as the prevalence of ensembles that fit
the data well, and the components that comprise those ensembles,
will become greater as the algorithm progresses. This may be ad—
dressed by either increasing the total number of ensembles being im-
proved by the algorithm, or by executing MESMER repeatedly and
comparing the most prevalent components upon convergence.

3.2 Analysis

The MESMER GUI includes tools to analyze the input and resulting
ensembles, by generating plots of ensemble scores, component cor—
relations, shared attributes and fits to experimental data
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Optionally, MESMER can also perform
bootstrapped error analysis to estimate the confidence intervals of
the best—fitting ensemble component concentrations; this is typically
performed for only the best—fit ensemble, due to its computational
expense (Efron and Tibshirani, 1986). Components can be selected
from the original coordinate library and saved to a multi—model
PDB along with attribute lists for UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et 61].,
2004) or scripts for PyMol (http://www.pymol.org/) that provide
options for visualizing average component concentrations and their
prevalence in the ensemble pool. More advanced options for these
analytical tools and others are provided by a collection of com—
mand-line utilities.

4 Results

To test and validate MESMER, we analyzed a range of experimental
data types obtained from three biological systems selected for their
known or suspected structural heterogeneity. For each system,
MESMER analysis indicated that ensemble representation is appro—
priate, identifying ensembles with greatly improved agreement to the
experimental data over that of any single structure or configuration.

4.1 ESCRT—l complex

Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport-I (ESCRT-I)
is a multiprotein complex required for sorting and trafficking of cell
receptors and other proteins (McDonald and Martin-Serrano,
2009). The binding domains of the various proteins comprising this
complex are connected to the central ‘stalk’ and ‘head—piece’ of the
complex core by flexible linkers ranging from 60 to 13 residues in
length (Fig. 2A). Because these linkers permit structural variability
that could allow for concerted opening or closing of the complex by
the ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV), C-terminal (CTD) or N-terminal
predicted helix domains, ESCRT—I is an attractive test system for en—
semble—based analysis of macromolecules that are conformationally
restricted, but structurally variable. Previously (Boura et 61]., 2011),
SAXS and double electron—electron resonance (DEER) experiments
between spin—probe pairs were used to restrain describe the variable

structure of this complex, and in this work formed the basis for test—
ing the utility of MESMER.

First, we generated 50 000 structural models (conformers) of the
ESCRT-I complex using Xplor—NIH (Schwieters et 61]., 2003) by
treating the UEV, CTD, NTH and core domains as rigid bodies,
while the linkers and unstructured C—terminal residues of the
va12 protein in the complex core were subjected to Monte Carlo
randomization of backbone torsion angles (Supplementary Fig.
S4B). Linkers were defined as previously described (Boura et 61].,
2011): residues 159—217 of VPS23, residues 118—147 of VPS28 and
residues 33—46 of VPS37. Geometric violations and steric clashes
were removed through a brief energy minimization. SAXS data for
the structural models were calculated with FoXS (Schneidman-
Duhovny et 61]., 2013), which in comparison with profiles calculated
by CRYSOL, provided more accurate fits to the experimental data.

Because the MTSL spin labels used to collect the DEER data ex—
perience a significant amount of motion about their tethers (Galiano
et 61]., 2009), the program MMM (Polyhach et 61]., 2011) was used
to sample conformation space around the tether for each labeled do—
main. The resulting spin—probe labeled domains were then superim—
posed onto the matching unlabeled domains for each of the Monte
Carlo models, resulting in structures of the complex decorated with
possible configurations of the spin probe (Fig. 2A). The predicted
DEER spectrum for each label—label pair was then calculated as pre—
viously described (Boura et 61]., 2011). The modulation depth 2 was
optimized for DEER data and a consistent scaling factor was applied
to the SAXS Ypred to minimize the reduced X2 score for each ensem—
ble to their respective experimental observations (3):

1 Q Y(q)ex — Y(¢1) red 2
5 z X2 z _ P—P 3
SAXS,DEER Q Eq < 0(q)exp > ( )

Relative weighting between the SAXS and each of the three
DEER restraints was obtained by fitting each restraint separately,
and assigning a weight to the restraint that would provide a final
best—fit fitness score of 1.0 upon convergence (Supplementary Table
S2). When each set of DEER data was fit independently, ensembles
with two components contributing roughly equal proportion were
necessary in order to fit each set of experimental data. This result is
consistent with the bimodal distribution of interlabel distances for
each pair previously observed, possessing interlabel distance distri—
butions centered at 25.9 and 48.4  for VPS23, 21.9 and 40.7A for
VPS28, 24.7 and 42.7A for VPS37 (Boura et 61]., 2011)
(Supplementary Fig. S4C, Table S1). However, when the three sets
of DEER data were fit simultaneously, two—component ensembles
could no longer accurately recapitulate the experimental data,
requiring that the ensemble size be increased to six—the same num—
ber reported by Boura et al. (2011). This result implied that our li-
brary was deficient in pairs of models in which all fours sets of
constraints could be simultaneously satisfied. This could in principle
reﬂect the requisite diversity of the structures, or alternatively, due
to inadequate sampling of the variable domain positions. Indeed, in-
spection of the conformational properties of the randomly generated
library revealed that the majority of conformations in the library
possessed interprobe distances far from those consistent with the ex—
perimental DEER data (Supplementary Fig. S4B,C).

To better sample conformations with the potential to satisfy the
experimental data, a second library of 10000 ESCRT—I structures
were generated by Monte—Carlo randomization of linker torsions, but
with the added condition that VPS23, VPS28 and VPS37 inter—label
distances were independently restrained to those observed in the indi—
vidual DEER fits (Supplementary Table S1, Fig. S4D). Using this
enhanced library, a converged fit (total fitness score RSD <1%) iden—
tified 19 unique two—component ensembles, which exhibited satisfac—
tory global fits to the combined DEER and SAXS data (Fig. 2B—E,
Supplementary Table S2). A modest deviation of the ensemble fit to
the SAXS data at high scattering angles may be due to incomplete
modeling of solvation around unstructured regions (Schneidman—
Duhovny et 61]., 2013) or because of the partial structuring of one or
more linkers; ensembles of three or more components resulted in
minor improvement to SAXS fit quality (Supplementary Fig. S5), but
did not improve fits to the DEER data or change conclusions about
positioning of the variable domains. The structural attributes of
model components present in the selected ensembles were consistent
with previous findings (Boura et 61]., 2011) that featured the UEV do—
main of VPS23 close to the core, despite its 59—residue long linker
(Fig. 2F; Supplementary Figs S3, S4E). The configuration of the

Minimal ensemble solutions to multiple experimental restraints

 

VPS28 CTD domain displayed a slightly greater variability, but it was
typically localized around the core’s headpiece domain. Such variabil—
ity implies a larger extent of motion for this domain, possibly reﬂect—
ing equilibrium between an open and a closed state. We found a
preponderance of structures with the NTH domain of VPS37 adopt—
ing two roughly collinear poses, which are typically oriented away
from the VPS23 UEV. While the hypothesis of cooperative or con—
certed positioning of the ECRT—I domains is consistent with the find-
ing that the experimental data can be fit with minimal ensembles
containing only two, equally—contributing poses of each domain, the
data cannot rule out a more complex model. Moreover, the variabil—
ity in the orientations of the VPS23 and VPS28 ﬂexible domains with
respect to the complex’s core indicate that the SAXS data lack the
precision required to unambiguously position these domains (Fig. 2F;
Supplementary Figs S3, S4E). These findings demonstrate the utility
of MESMER for diagnosing and revealing structural features from
highly variable systems restrained by a collection of experimental
data. The iterative approach described here also demonstrates how
the selective fitting of individual restraints in MESMER can be used
to rationally design component libraries, enhancing sampling of rea-
sonable conformations.

4.2 Calmodulin

The calmodulin calcium-binding family of signal messenger proteins
consists of two rigid domains separated by a ﬂexible linker of seven
amino acids, which in some crystallographic studies has been shown
to form a long, uninterrupted alpha helix (Chattopadhyaya et 61].,
1992; Grabarek 2005). NMR experiments have indicated that this
linker is largely unstructured in solution (Zhang et 61]., 1995), per—
mitting significant reorientation of the two domains with respect to
one another (Anthis et 61]., 2011; Bertini et 61]., 2004) (Fig. 3A). This
dynamic behavior, and the potential for populating one or more
favored conformational states makes Calmodulin an attractive can—
didate for ensemble—based analysis of conformational heterogeneity.
The N60D mutant of calmodulin has been shown to preferentially
bind lanthanide metal ions in the N-terminal domain, allowing the
collection of paramagnetic pseudocontact shifts (PCS) and RDCs
by NMR (Bertini et 61]., 2004). These observations provide a bulk—
average measure of the relative orientation between the two do—
mains. In addition to paramagnetic restraints, SAXS data for the
protein is also available (Bertini et 61]., 2010).

The program RanCh (Bernado et 61]., 2007), which treats two do—
mains as rigid bodies and randomizes the connecting linker
backbone Phi and Psi angles, was used to generate a library of
50 000 model structures from the atomic coordinates of the N— and
C-terminal domains in the Maximum Occurrence example dataset
(Bertini et 61]., 2010); we used RanCh in this case instead of XPLOR
because of lower computational cost and enhanced sampling. As
CRYSOL resulted in superior fits to the SAXS data than FoXs for
calmodulin, it was used to calculate the predicted SAXS profiles for
each structure, with 128 points per simulated profile to a maximum
scattering angle of 0.35 41tsin(0) (1/A). Solvent electron density was
set to 0.334 e/A3, and a hydration shell contrast of 0.03 e/A3 was
used. The magnetic susceptibility tensor orientation and anisotropies
for terbium and thulium were obtained by fitting the N—terminal do—
main PCS values using the program Numbat (Schmitz et 61]., 2008)
and matched previously published values (Bertini et 61]., 2004).
These tensors were subsequently used to calculate predicted PCS
and RDCs for the model structures using a MESMER plugin based
on the PyParaTools python library (M. Stanton—Cook, X.—C. Su, G.
Otting, T. Huber, http://comp—bio.anu.edu.au/mscook/PPT/).

Superimposition of the eight components of the best-fitting ensemble to

ing to its contribution to the fitted ensemble (Color version of this figure is

The agreement score between the predicted PCS and RDC values
and the experimental results was obtained from the quality score Q,
as previously defined (Cornilescu et 61]., 1998) (4):

SRDC’FCS = Q = rms(A5me"S — Aépred)/rms(A5meas) (4)

Relative weighting of the SAXS, PCS and RDC restraints was
determined in the same manner as described for the ESCRT—I system
restraint types (Supplementary Table S3). As RDC values are sensi—
tive to small structural perturbations (Zweckstetter and Bax, 2002),
initial fits were made with only the SAXS and PCS data (Fig. 3A—C).
An ensemble size of six components was found to provide accurate

domain, consistent with previous reports (Fig. 3D and E), while cer-
tain configurations with otherwise sterically permitted geometries
(gray dots in Fig. 3D) were not observed in the final pool of selected
ensembles (blue dots in Fig. 3D), although they were present in the
component pool and starting ensembles. Because of the single, sig—
nificantly shorter linker, and the fairly uniform coverage of interdo—
main distances and alignments (Fig. 3D) undersampling was judged
to be significantly less problematic than with the larger ESCRT-I
complex.

However, when RDC data were included as a restraint, the en—
semble size M necessary to generate reasonable fits increased to at
least eight components (Supplementary Fig. S9), and significantly
narrowed the diversity of structures that populate converged ensem—
bles (Fig. 3D, red dots), typically resulting in a single unique ensem-
ble of eight structures (Fig. 3F; Supplementary Fig. S10). As multiple
independent MESMER runs selected different ensembles upon con—
vergence (yet all with similar scores), this was judged to be a side ef—
fect of the number of ensembles used during the fitting, which is
limited by computer memory, and not inadequate sampling of struc—
tural variability in the starting structure library. This is consistent
with the increased resolution of RDC restraints compared to PCS
and SAXS data, and is supported by cross—validation plots of PCS
and RDC restraints indicating that structures obtained by fitting
RDC data alone can be used to accurately recapitulate PCS data, but
not vice versa (Supplementary Fig. 811A and B). Overall, these re—
sults are consistent with the present understanding of the structural
plasticity of calmodulin, including the presence of favored configur—
ations and the absence of disfavored ones (Anthis et 61]., 2011;
Barbato et 61]., 1992; Bertini et 61]., 2004). Such observations confirm
the utility of MESMER in the ensemble analysis of protein structural
variability.

4.3 TRAP and AT hetero—oligomerization
The homo-oligomeric TRAP and Anti-TRAP (AT) proteins partici-
pate in a polydentate condensation process that leads to the
formation of heterogeneous chains or clusters of the components
(Ihms et 61]., 2014). Thermodynamic and structural analysis of the
chaining process indicates that multiple AT trimers (AT3) bind to
sites on the surface of the ring—shaped TRAP undecamer (TRAP11).
Thus, at limiting AT3 ratios, clusters are formed as increasing num—
bers of TRAP11 rings bind to AT3. However, as the AT3:TRAP11
ratio increases, additional AT3s bind to TRAP11, resulting
in smaller, AT—saturated clusters. This condition—dependent modula—
tion of hetero—complex abundance offers a unique opportunity to
examine the utility of MESMER to detect the configuration and
relative abundance of species present in a heterogeneous solution.
As previously described (Ihms et 61]., 2014), bead models of
AT3—l—TRAP11 clusters were assembled from models of the compo—
nents obtained from ab initio shape reconstruction. The SAXS profiles
for the models were calculated by CRYSOL with 256 points per simu—
lated profile to a maximum scattering angle of 0.32 47tsin(0) (1/A).
Solvent electron density was set to 0.334 e/A3, and a hydration shell
contrast of 0.03 e/A3 was used. Nine separate SAXS curves from sam—
ples at three AT3:TRAP11 ratios (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5) and three TRAP
concentrations (3, 5 and 10mg/ml) were obtained at pH 8 (Ihms
et 61]., 2014). Under basic conditions, complexes exist in rapid equilib-
rium with each other and the free components, resulting in an average
complex size smaller than those present at neutral pH (E. Ihms, un-
published results). The SAXS curves for each condition were simultan—
eously constrained with an additional, equally weighted stoichiometry
restraint Sratio to ensure agreement between the AT3:TRAP11 ratios in
the ensembles and in the experimental sample (5):

Ensembles with four components were sufficient to fit each of

size beyond six components provided little additional reduction in
chi—square (Supplementary Fig. 812). A preponderance of extended
configurations, with multiple TRAP11 rings stitched together by AT3
(Fig. 4D) were required to fit the data. The only component present
in all of the selected ensembles was free TRAP11, although its contri—
bution to the ensemble did not exceed 5% at the lowest concentra—
tion of TRAP and AT (Fig. 4E). Examination of the ensemble
component contributions as a function of the AT3:TRAP11 ratio re-
veals several interesting trends. The free TRAP11 component did not
significantly contribute in ensemble fits to either the 1 or 1.5
AT3:TRAP11 data, and the contribution of the AT3-2TRAP11

component also decreases dramatically in fits to data obtained at
higher ratios. The 1AT3-1TRAP11 component only significantly con-
tributes in fits to data with 21 AT3:TRAP11 ratios, suggesting that
multiple TRAPs cooperatively bind AT, but not necessarily vice
versa (Fig. 4E).

The relatively small concentration range tested has little appar—
ent effect on the relative contributions of the components, consistent
with the fact that the affinity of TRAP11 for AT3 is well above the
concentrations tested. However, the contribution of the most AT—
saturated complex is directly proportional to both AT3:TRAP11
and increasing component concentration, while the contribution of
the less saturated AT3—TRAP11 complexes concomitantly decrease
(Fig. 4E).

These results demonstrate the utility of MESMER for describing
the structure and population of species present in heterogeneous solu—
tions, and how these properties vary under experimental conditions.
This utility may find value in investigating how ligands or other vari—
ables modulate conformational or oligomerization equilibria.

5 Discussion

Obtaining meaningful results from ensemble—based approaches is con—
tingent upon various factors. These include the discriminating power
of the input data, the proper sampling of conformational space and
the selection of an appropriate ensemble size. If the ensemble size is
too small, insufficient structural variability will typically result in poor
fits, while overly large ensembles run the risk of over-fitting the experi-
mental data and potentially including unreasonable components.
Indeed, the ensemble size embodies the difference between ‘minimal
ensemble’ and other ensemble—based techniques. Some methods that
employ larger ensembles and thus greater computational require—
ments, such as EROS (Rozycki et al., 201 1) typically avoid over—fitting
by using statistical methods, such as maximum entropy which restricts
excessive optimization of ensemble component concentrations/contri—
butions. However, even these approaches are subject to significant pit—
falls, most notably that insufficient or inaccurate sampling of
conformational space may result in unnecessarily large ensembles. In
the other extreme, it is possible that an artificially small set of compo—
nent structures may provide acceptable fits to experimental data while
insufficiently describing the system’s true heterogeneity. Both concerns
may be partially addressed by cross validation with different types of
experimental data, and examination of the variability present in mul-
tiple converged solutions.

MESMER facilitates the process of finding structural ensembles
that can recapitulate data obtained from heterogeneous solutions. We
have validated MESMER by investigating a variety of case studies pre—
viously shown to exhibit structural heterogeneity. Despite this hetero—
geneity, the averaged experimental data available from these systems
were sufficient to report on specific structural characteristics, providing
new insights into the systems’ function. MESMER introduces several
innovations that may find utility in similar ensemble—based methods,
streamlining much of the necessary workﬂow while retaining ﬂexibil-
ity. MESMER’S GUI is intended to enable a wide user base to readily
and intuitively investigate complicated structural heterogeneity, while
its extensible and modular nature enables advanced users to incorpor—
ate new experiments and analytical techniques.

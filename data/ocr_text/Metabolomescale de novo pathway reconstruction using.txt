Abstract

Motivation: Recent advances in mass spectrometry and related metabolomics technologies have
enabled the rapid and comprehensive analysis of numerous metabolites. However, biosynthetic
and biodegradation pathways are only known for a small portion of metabolites, with most meta—
bolic pathways remaining uncharacterized.

Results: In this study, we developed a novel method for supervised de novo metabolic pathway re—
construction with an improved graph alignment—based approach in the reaction—filling framework.
We proposed a novel chemical graph alignment algorithm, which we called PACHA (Pairwise
Chemical Aligner), to detect the regioisomer—sensitive connectivities between the aligned substruc—
tures of two compounds. Unlike other existing graph alignment methods, PACHA can efficiently
detect only one common subgraph between two compounds. Our results show that the proposed
method outperforms previous descriptor—based methods or existing graph alignment—based meth—
ods in the enzymatic reaction—likeness prediction for isomer—enriched reactions. It is also useful for
reaction annotation that assigns potential reaction characteristics such as EC (Enzyme
Commission) numbers and PIERO (Enzymatic Reaction Ontology for Partial Information) terms to
substrate—product pairs. Finally, we conducted a comprehensive enzymatic reaction—likeness pre—
diction for all possible uncharacterized compound pairs, suggesting potential metabolic pathways

 

for newly predicted substrate—product pairs.

1 Introduction

Understanding cell metabolism is essential in a wide range of fields,
e.g. metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, drug discovery and
clinical treatments of metabolic disorders (Toya and Shimizu, 2013;
Newman and Cragg, 2012; Ramautar et 61]., 2013). Recent advances
in mass spectrometry and related metabolomics technologies have
enabled the rapid and comprehensive analysis of numerous metabol—
ites. However, biosynthetic and biodegradation pathways are only
known for a small portion of metabolites, with the majority of path—
ways remaining uncharacterized (Sreekumar et 61]., 2009). For eX—
ample, it is estimated that at least 1 060 000 metabolites are
produced within all plants, for which most chemical transform-
ations remain to be identified (Afendi et 61]., 2012). Elucidation of

potential metabolic pathways in plants would provide a significant
benefit for environmental, agricultural, pharmaceutical and public
health matters. Experimental determination of metabolic pathways
is difficult, expensive and time consuming (Nakabayashi and Saito,
2013); thus automatic pathway reconstruction on a metabolome
scale is a challenging issue in current computational biology.

The traditional in silico method for metabolic pathway recon—
struction is the predefined pathway approach, where enzyme—coding
genes are mapped onto appropriate positions in the predefined path—
way diagrams based on gene—gene sequence similarities (Bono et 61].,
1998). This method has been used for analyzing metabolic pathways
in fully sequenced organisms or in specific conditions of cellular
processes (Kanehisa et 61]., 2014). Another method in the predefined

pathway approach is to consider chemical structures for finding
pathways that conserve atoms from start to the target compounds in
predefined pathway diagrams (Boyer and Viari, 2003; Heath et al.,
2010). However, these methods are not applicable to the identifica—
tion of previously unknown pathways (absent from predefined path—
way maps).

Conversely, various de novo pathway reconstruction methods
have been developed to elucidate novel reactions based on metabol—
ite chemical structures, known enzymatic reactions and possible
chemical transformations. The overall problem resembles that of
synthetic organic chemistry (Faulon and Sault, 2001), but few
studies have tackled this problem for enzymatic reactions.
Previously developed de novo methods can be categorized into ei—
ther the compound-filling framework (Darvas, 1988; Ellis et al.,
2008; Greene et al., 1999; Moriya et al., 2010; Talafous
et al., 1994) or the reaction—filling framework (Hatzimanikatis
et al., 2005; Nakamura et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2009). However,
previous methods in both frameworks are not applicable to metabo—
lome—scale compound sets because of prohibitive computational
burden.

Recently, de novo pathway reconstruction in the reaction-filling
framework has been formulated as a problem of enzymatic reaction—
likeness, and an efficient supervised method has been proposed to
predict whether the given pairs of metabolites can be chemically
interconverted by single enzymatic reactions (Kotera et al., 2013b).
With this method, the use of chemical descriptors—binary/integer
vectors representing compound chemical characteristics (e.g.
chemical substructures) (Steinbeck et al., 2003)—is key for compu—
tational efficiency, which enables metabolome—scale application for
tens of thousands of metabolites at a time. However, chemical
descriptors cannot handle connectivities among substructures in a
compound; thus, in theory, it is difficult to distinguish regioisomers
(positional isomers), resulting in many false positive predictions in
practice. Regioisomers are a group of compounds with the
same compositional formula (numbers of respective elements)
but are different in connectivity among the substructures. Proper
distinction of isomers is required for appropriate interpretation of
metabolome data (Mitchell et al., 2014). Thus, there is a
strong need to develop an efficient approach that can deal with
regioisomers, thus strengthening the de novo pathway reconstruc—
tion study.

In this study, we developed a novel method for supervised de
novo metabolic pathway reconstruction with an improved graph
alignment—based approach in the reaction—filling framework. We
propose a novel chemical graph alignment algorithm, which we
called PACHA (Pairwise Chemical Aligner), in order to detect
regioisomer—sensitive connectivities between the aligned substruc—
tures of two compounds. Unlike other existing graph alignment
methods [such as SIMCOMP (Hattori et al., 2003)], PACHA can
efficiently detect only one common subgraph between two com—
pounds. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms
previous descriptor—based methods or existing graph alignment-
based methods in the enzymatic reaction—likeness prediction for iso-
mer—enriched reactions. It is also useful for reaction annotation
that assigns potential reaction characteristics such as EC (Enzyme
Commission) numbers (McDonald and Tipton, 2014) and PIERO
(Enzymatic Reaction Ontology for Partial Information) terms
(Kotera et al., 2014) to substrate—product pairs. Finally, we
conducted a comprehensive enzymatic reaction—likeness prediction
for all possible uncharacterized compound pairs, suggesting poten—
tial metabolic pathways for newly predicted substrate—product
pairs.

2 Materials

2.1 Chemical structures of compounds

Chemical structures of metabolic compounds were retrieved from
the KEGG LIGAND database (Kanehisa et al., 2014). MDL mol—
files, which are the de facto standard of chemical structure format
files, were converted to the KEGG Chemical Function (KCF) format
(Hattori et al., 2003). In KCF, atoms (with the exception of hydro—
gen atoms) and bonds were represented as vertices and edges, re—
spectively. Each vertex was given three labels representing the
different levels of physicochemical properties, e.g. ‘C’ for a carbon
atom, ‘C1’ for an sp3 carbon and ‘Cla’ for a methyl carbon (CH3—).
Hydrogen atoms were not explicitly represented as vertices but were
implicitly represented in the attached atoms (see http://www.genome.
jp/kegg/reaction/KCF.html). In this study, the one—letter label (e.g.
C), two—letter label (e.g. C1) and three—letter label (e.g. C161) were
referred to as the primary, secondary and tertiary labels,
respectively.

2.2 Substrate—product pair datasets

Substrate—product relationships were retrieved from KEGG RPAIR
and used as the positive examples of enzymatic reaction likeness.
Different reaction directions were dealt as different pairs (e.g. ‘L-
Arginine — L-Omit/oine’ and ‘L-Ornitkine - L-Arginine’) in order to
not miss the similarity between the forward direction of a reaction
and the reverse of another reaction.

Known substrate—product pairs were regarded as positive ex—
amples, whereas the remaining compound pairs were regarded as
negative examples. To a certain extent, substrate—product pairs
share common structures, therefore, chemical similarity is one of the
efficient measures to distinguish positive and negative examples. In
this study, we focused on dealing with similar pairs (Jaccard coeffi-
cient > 0.5), which are more difficult and realistic condition. The
numbers of positive examples and negative examples are 10 852
and 518 854, respectively, which is referred to as the ‘all’ dataset.

From the all dataset, the positive and negative pairs were
grouped by the same compositional formulas (i.e. the compound on
one side of a pair is a regioisomer of the compound on the same side
of another pair). The groups were then removed if there were less
than four positive or negative pairs within a group. The set of the re—
maining compound pairs was referred to as the ‘isomer—enricbed’
dataset. The numbers of positives and negatives in the isomer—
enriched dataset were 1632 and 53 046, respectively. Note that the
isomer—enriched dataset is more difficult than the ‘all’ dataset in
terms of enzymatic reaction—likeness prediction because of the issue
of regioisomers.

2.3 Chemical descriptors

Chemical structures of compounds were represented by high—
dimensional chemical descriptors, which are the binary/integer
vectors representing the chemical structural characteristics of metab—
olites. We tested CDK Extended fingerprint, CDK GraphOnly fin-
gerprint, CDK Hybridization fingerprint (Steinbeck et al., 2003),
EState fingerprint (Hall and Kier, 1995), KlekotaRoth fingerprint
(Klekota and Roth, 2008), MACCS fingerprint (Durant et al.,
2002), PubChem fingerprint (Chen et al., 2009), the atomic environ—
ment (AE) descriptor (Nakamura et al., 2012) and KCF—S descriptor
(Kotera et al., 2013a). For example, KCF—S descriptors represent the
number of biochemical substructures, e.g. methyl, n—butyl, benzene
and adenine residue. AE and KCF—S descriptors were calculated by
our in—house program, whereas the other descriptors were generated
using the Chemistry Development Kit (Steinbeck et al., 2003).

2.4 Manually curated reaction annotations

EC numbers and PIERO terms were retrieved from KEGG and
GenomeNet, respectively. EC numbers represent the hierarchical en-
zyme classification based on the full reaction equation (McDonald
and Tipton, 2014). EC sub—subclasses (upto the third digit of the EC
numbers) were used as the reaction annotation by EC. PIERO is a
collection of terminology annotating substrate—product relation—
ships in enzymatic reactions (Kotera et al., 2014).

3 Methods

3.1 Chemical graph alignment problem

We address the problem of chemical graph alignment using a simple
example. Figure 1 shows two compounds of n—butylamine (com—
pound A) and methyl—n—propylamine (compound B) that are
regioisomers (positional isomers). Figure 1(a) shows the atom—atom
mapping by the chemical graph alignment of the two compounds,
which detects the preserved substructure in a putative reaction and
the changed chemical bonds. In this example, four vertices are pre—
served, two of which changed labels; an edge labeled ‘C1a—C1b’ is
eliminated and an edge labeled ‘C1a—N1b’ is generated. To charac—
terize reactions and distinguish regioisomers, it is crucial to detect
type of bond that has changed and the position where it has
changed.

Since the two compounds are regioisomers, no differences would
be detected by counting the elements (C, H and N). Figure 1(b)
shows a feature vector representation of the compound pairs, such
as, using KCF—S descriptors representing the number of substruc—
tures, e.g. methyl (C1a—), ethyl (C1a—C1b—) and n—propyl (C1a—C1b-
C1b—), etc. The feature vector detects preserved (common) and
changed (decreased and increased) chemical characteristics.
However, the descriptor—based feature vector does not necessarily
reﬂect the exact chemical changes that actually occur in the reaction.
For example, although the feature vector indicates that vertex C1a is
preserved in two compounds, the C1a vertices do not form an
atom—atom pair in the graph alignment. Thus, it is very difficult for
descriptor—based methods to capture the chemically important char-
acteristics of reactions.

In this study, we propose a novel method for chemical graph
alignment that can handle the issue of regioisomers and show
the potential of the proposed method for applications to the enzym—
atic reaction likeness prediction and reaction annotation on a
metabolome—scale. The details of the proposed method are ex—
plained below.

3.2 Pairwise chemical aligner (PACHA)
We propose a novel, efficient algorithm named PACHA for chemical
graph alignments. We represent each compound chemical structure
G by a labeled graph defined as G = (V, E, L), where V is the set of
vertices (i.e. atoms in this study), E is the set of undirected edges (i.e.
bonds in this study) and L : V —> Z is a function that assigns labels
from an alphabet Z to vertices (i.e. primary, secondary or tertiary
labels in this study). Let s : V X V —> R be a similarity function be—
tween a vertex pair (i.e. an atom—atom pair in this study) and re—
turns —00 if the vertex pair is unmatched. The function 5 will be
detailed in the next subsection.

Suppose we are given two chemical graphs G : (V,E,L) and
G’ : (V’,E’, L’ We formulate the graph alignment as the problem
of finding a set of matching vertex pairs M Q V x V’ that maximizes
the summation of vertex similarities 5(12, 12’) for (12,12’) E M as follows:

Subsequently, the number of atom—atom pairs in the alignment (e.g. the col-
umn labeled ‘a:C1a= C1a’ in the white boxes on the left), the number of elimi-
nated bonds (e.g. the column labeled ‘e:C1a-C1b’ in the gray boxes in the
middle) and the number of generated bonds (e.g. column labeled ‘g:C1a-N1b’
in the gray boxes on the right) were represented as a vector. The symbols ‘2’
and ‘—’ represent the atom—atom mapping and the chemical bond, respect-
ively. (b) Descriptor-based vectors in the previous studies (e.g. KCF-S). Each

middle) and right compound (in the gray boxes on the right)

under the following two constraints:

(i) If (12,12’) E M, then (12, z) E M for all z E V’ and (z, 12’) E M for
all z E V, i.e. a vertex in V can be matched to at most one ver—
tex in V’.

(ii) The matching vertices in M of G (respectively, G’) and edges E’
(respectively, E’) form connected subgraphs, i.e. there is a pass
from any vertex to the other vertices in G (respectively, G’).

Note that constraint (ii) is absent from existing graph alignment
methods such as SIMCOMP (Hattori et al., 2003), which causes the
generation of many (possibly small) subgraph matches, thus prevent—
ing the sensitive detection of regioisomers.

Because computing the exact solution for the graph alignment is
intractable, we solved it using a greedy strategy. To efficiently select
vertex pairs with the highest similarity in order, we propose to use
the priority queue PQUEUE that stores vertex pairs (12,12’) E V X V’
and their similarities S(12, 12’ PQUEUE supports the following
operations:

° Insert: insert a vertex pair (12, 12’) E V X V and its similarity s(12,
12’) into PQUEUE.

° Get: get the vertex pair (12, 12’) with the highest similarity in
PQUEUE.

° Pop: delete the vertex pair (12, 12’) with the highest similarity from
PQUEUE.

We propose the following algorithm. We initialize PQUEUE as a
vertex pair (12, 12’) E V X V’ with the highest similarity and its simi-
larity s(12, 12’ The algorithm iterates as follows. We first get the ver—
tex pair (12, 12’) with the highest similarity in PQUEUE and delete it
from PQUEUE. We then insert the vertex pair (12, 12’) into a set MC.
Let N (12) be a set of vertices adjacent to 12 E V. We next insert all
combinations of vertex pairs adjacent to 12 and 12’, i.e.
(x,x’) E N (12) X N (12’ ), into PQUEUE, which is necessary to satisfy
constraint (ii) in the graph alignment. Considering constraint (i), we
insert only vertex pairs (x,x’) E N (12) X N (12’ ) into PQUEUE such
that (x,z) E M5 for all z E V’ and (z,x’) E M5 for all z E V. When
PQUEUE is empty, the algorithm stops. For accurate alignments,
the algorithm restarts from each vertex pair chosen among
those with top—k highest similarities, where k is a user defined
parameter; k is set to 10 in this study. The algorithm finally returns
the set of vertex pairs with the highest summation of similarities in
MC. The pseudocode of the algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1.

 

Algorithm 1 Chemical graph alignment for two compounds.

Suppose we are given a chemical graph G : (V, E, L). The first
fingerprint of a vertex 12 E V is obtained by collecting vertex labels
from N(12), adjacent vertices of 12, to create a string. The string is
then converted into a unique integer using a hash function, and it is
added to the fingerprint as a new element. The integer is also as—
signed to a new vertex label for 12. The same procedure is repeated T
times. As a consequence, we obtain a fingerprint of T elements per
vertex. The pseudocode of the WL procedure is presented in
Algorithm 2.

3.3 Vertex similarity function based on fingerprints

We propose to evaluate the similarity of each vertex pair in a graph
by computing the similarity between two fingerprints of the vertices
using the Weisfeiler—Lehman (WL) procedure (Shervashidze et al.,
2011). A fingerprint defined as a binary vector is conceptually
equivalent to the set that contains elements 1' if the ith bit of the fin-
gerprint is 1, thus we use the set representation of fingerprints in this

paper.

10: return {IX/(12); 12 E V}

 

Each vertex in the chemical graph has three types of labels: pri—
mary, secondary and tertiary labels in this study. We apply the WL
procedure to each label. Figure 2 shows an illustration of the WL
procedure. The fingerprint for a vertex 12 is defined as W(12), which is
the union of the resulting fingerprints for three labels.

Given two compound chemical graphs G = (V, E, L) and
G’ = (V’, E’, L’), we propose the following similarity function 5 : V
><V’ —> R for a vertex pair (12, 12’) using the corresponding finger-
prints W(12) and W(12’) generated by the WL procedure:

WW (1 W(v’)|
|W(v) U W(v’)|

if 12’s primary label is identical to

I .—
s(v’ v ) '_ 12’s primary label,

—00 otherwise.

The vertex similarity is computed by the Tanimoto (also known as
Jaccard) coefficient of fingerprints W(12) and W(12’) if 12’s primary label
is identical to 12’ ’s primary label. Otherwise, the vertex similarity is set
to —00, which forces atom pairs with different primary labels to be
unmatched in the graph alignment between two compounds.

3.4 Graph alignment—based feature vector
The PACHA-based graph alignment enables us to assign one of
three alignment states: ‘aligned’, ‘generated’ and ‘eliminated’ to each
vertex pair, defined as follows: (i) aligned: 12 is aligned to 12’ if
(12, 12’) E M; (ii) generated: z is generated from 12’ if Hz, 12’ E V’ s.t. z
E N (12’ ), (12, 12’) E M for any 12 E V; (iii) eliminated: z is eliminated
from 12 if Hz, 12 E V s.t. z E N(12), (12, 12’) E M for any 12’ E V’. Figure
1(a) shows an example of the three alignment states.

We represent a compound pair (G,G’) as a D—dimensional
non—negative integer vector @pacha(G, G’) E ND using matching
vertex pairs in M. Considering the three alignment states, we define

The aligned sub—vector @“(G, G’) counts the number of vertices
12 aligned to vertices 12’ for each pair of labels L(12) and L’(12’ Let

The aligned sub—vector is defined as q)“ (G, G’) : Emmewv, F"(12, 12’

The generated sub—vector @g (G’) counts the number of vertices z
generated from vertices 12’ for each pair of labels L’ (z) and L’ Let

the following indicator function:

The eliminated sub—vector is defined as CD"(G) = ZQWEWV Fe(z,12).

Finally, Qpacha(G, G’) is constructed as @pacha(G, G’) :
(@“(G,G’)T,Q>g(G’)T,Q>e(G)T)T, which is referred to as ‘PACHA
descriptor’ in this study. We built the PACHA descriptors using 68
tertiary labels, resulting in 3567—dimensional integer vectors.
Figure 1a represents an example of the PACHA descriptor.

3.5 Predictive models for metabolic pathway
reconstruction

We propose to apply the above PACHA descriptor to the enzymatic
reaction—likeness prediction and reaction annotation, which are im-
portant applications for metabolic pathway reconstruction.

Given two compound chemical graphs G and G’, we consider a
predictive model defined as the linear function f (G, G’) :
WTQPacha(G, G’), where w E RD is a weight vector. In the case of en—
zymatic reaction—likeness prediction, the weight vector w is esti—
mated such that it can correctly predict the enzymatic reaction—
likeness of compound—compound pairs. In the case of reaction

annotation, the weight vector w is estimated such that it can cor—
rectly predict a specific reaction annotation class (i.e. EC sub—sub—
class or PIERO term in this study) of the compound—compound
pairs.
Given a collection of compound—compound pairs and their
labels (@pacha(G,-, G,-),y,-,-), where 31,-,- E {+1, —1}(i : 1,  ,n,j : 1,

we optimize the weight vector w by L1—regularized linear support
vector machine (LlSVM) formulated as

where P),- : max {1 — yiinQPacha(G,-, G,-), 0]»2, C is a hyper—
parameter and  - H1 is L1 norm (the sum of absolute values in the
vector). L1—regularization has an effect of making the weights of unin-
formative features zeros without loss of classification accuracy, which
enables to extract important features characteristic of each task.

4 Results

4.1 Performance evaluation ofthe enzymatic reaction—
Iikeness prediction

We tested the proposed PACHA descriptor for its ability to predict
enzymatic reaction—likeness of compound—compound pairs from
their chemical structure data. We compared this with previously
developed chemical descriptors and graph alignment methods:
CDK Extended fingerprint, CDK GraphOnly fingerprint, CDK
Hybridization fingerprint, EState fingerprint, KlekotaRoth finger-
print, MACCS fingerprint, PubChem fingerprint, AE descriptor,
KCF—S descriptor and SIMCOMP alignment (see Section 2 for more
details). First, we focused on analysis of the isomer—enriched reac—
tion data to validate the ability of PACHA to solve the issue of
regioisomers.

We performed the following five—fold cross—validation. First, we
randomly split the compound—compound pairs in the gold standard
reaction data into five subsets of roughly equal sizes, where known
substrate—product pairs were regarded as positive examples and the
other compound—compound pairs were regarded as negative ex—
amples. Second, we took each subset as a test set and the remaining
four subsets as a training set. Third, we learned a predictive model
based only on the training set. Finally, we evaluated the prediction
accuracy based on the prediction scores of compound—compound
pairs in the test set over the 5 —folds.

We evaluated the prediction performance using the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is a plot of true—positive
rates as a function of false—positive rates, and the precision—recall
(PR) curve, which is a plot of precision (positive predictive value) as
a function of recall (sensitivity). We summarized the performance by
the area under the ROC curve (AUC) score, where 1 is perfect infer-
ence and 0.5 is random inference, and the area under the PR curve
(AUPR) score, where 1 is perfect inference and the ratio of positive
examples in the gold standard data is random inference.

The third column of Table 1 shows the resulting AUC and AUPR
scores and their standard deviations (SDs) in performing 5 -fold
cross—validation experiments for the isomer—enriched reaction data.
It was observed that PACHA worked best among the graph align-
ment—based methods and KCF—S worked the best among the descrip—
tor—based methods. In total, PACHA outperformed the previously
developed methods in terms of higher AUC and AUPR scores. These
results suggest that PACHA can capture the important features of

isomer—related chemical changes in reactions, while other methods
can not capture isomer—specific chemical changes.

Next, we tested the PACHA descriptor on its ability to predict
enzymatic reaction—likeness using the ‘all’ reaction data that con—
tains not only isomer—enriched reactions but also other enzymatic re—
actions. We performed Five—fold cross—validation experiments in a
similar manner as the previous experiments.

The fourth column of Table 1 shows the resulting AUC and
AUPR scores and their SDs in performing the Five—fold cross—valid—
ation experiments of the enzymatic reaction—likeness prediction for
all reactant pair data. It was also observed that PACHA worked the
best among graph alignment—based methods and KCF—S worked the
best among the descriptor—based methods. Thus, we attempted to
combine PACHA and KCF—S by vector concatenation, which we call
‘PACHA —l— KCF-S’. As a result, PACHA—l— KCFS worked much bet—
ter than other individual methods, implying that descriptor— and
graph alignment—based methods are complementary to each other
and the integration of both approaches is useful in practice.

4.2 Analysis of chemical changes in isomer—related
reactions

We examined the detailed prediction results of the cross—validation
experiments and analyzed the relationship with chemical changes in
isomer—related reactions. We then compared PACHA (the best
among graph alignment—based methods) and KCF—S (the best among
descriptor—based methods).

Figure 3 shows some examples of the predicted chemical trans—
formations grouped by isomeric compounds. Most positive ex—
amples (a1, b1 and c1) were predicted correctly by KCF—S and
PACHA, whereas some negative examples (a2, a3, b2, b3, c2 and
c3) were predicted differently. Pairs a2, b2 and c2 were predicted as
negative by KCF—S and positive by PACHA. Although these pairs
were not known substrate—product pairs, these chemical changes
were already known in other compounds, which occurs only once in
each pair. Therefore, we can conclude that these pairs represent po—
tential reactions that are likely to occur.

Conversely, pairs a3, b3 and c3 were predicted negative by
PACHA and positive by KCF—S. If these chemical conversions were
to occur, at least two reactions would be needed for each pair. Pair
a3, representing the chemical change from pinocarveol (C11941) to
myrtenal (C11939), would require dehydroxylation and hydroxyl-
ation reactions and the isomerization of the pi—conjugated system.

Pair b3, genistein (C06563) and vitexin (C01460), would require
not only C—glycosylation but also in the rearrangement of the ring
attachment. Pair c3, benzo[e]pyrene (C14435) and benzo[a]pyrene—
7,8—epoxide (C1485 0), would also require at least two reactions, not
only an epoxydation but also the rearrangement of the ring struc—
ture. Thus, we can conclude that these pairs do not represent single
reactions.

4.3 Performance evaluation of reaction annotation and
extraction of reaction class—specific features

We investigated the usefulness of the proposed PACHA descriptor
for reaction annotation. As enzymatic reaction characteristics, we
used EC sub—subclasses and PIERO terms. Reaction annotation is
generally performed by predicting potential EC sub—subclasses or
PIERO terms directly from differential chemical structures of com—
pound—compound pairs, which is referred to as ‘direct approach’.
Here, we proposed a two—step approach that first performs enzym-
atic reaction—likeness prediction for compound—compound pairs,
followed by the reaction annotation for only the predicted sub—
strate—product pairs, which is referred to as the ‘filtering approach’.
Because PACHA—l—KCF—S worked the best in the cross—validation
experiments for enzymatic reaction—likeness prediction, we focused
on the use of PACHA —l— KCF—S and made a performance comparison
between the previous direct approach and our proposed filtering
approach.

We performed the following Five—fold cross—validation. First, we
randomly split compound—compound pairs in the gold standard re—
action data with an EC sub—subclass (respectively, PIERO term) into
five subsets of roughly equal sizes, where compound—compound
pairs with the EC sub—subclass (respectively, PIERO term) were re—
garded as positive examples and other compound—compound pairs
were regarded as negative examples. Second, we took each subset as
a test set and the remaining four subsets as a training set. Third, we
learned an EC—specific (respectively, PIERO—specific) predictive
model based only on the training set. Fourth, we evaluated the
prediction accuracy based on the prediction scores of compound—
compound pairs in the test set over the Five—folds. Finally, we re—
peated the above processes for all EC sub—subclasses (respectively,
all PIERO terms).

Figures 4 and 5 show the resulting AUC and AUPR scores for EC
sub—subclasses and PIERO terms, respectively. In both cases, our pro—
posed filtering approach outperformed the previous direct approach

in terms of higher AUC and AUPR scores. These results suggest that,
in practice, comprehensive filtering of compound—compound pairs by
enzymatic reaction—likeness is useful for more accurate reaction
annotation.

Table 2 shows the examples of respective reaction annotations
predicted by the direct and filtering approaches. The filtering ap-
proach worked better than the direct approach in terms of AUC and
AUPR. The best performance was achieved for EC1.3.5 ‘oxidore—
ductase reactions acting on the CH—CH group of donors with a
quinone or related compound as an acceptor’ as EC sub—subclasses
and ‘diesterification’ as PIERO. Regardless of AUC or AUPR, the
predictive values were generally higher in PIERO than in EC. This
result reflects the fact that EC numbers were given to full reaction
equations, whereas PIERO terms were given to substrate—product
pairs.

Table 3 shows several examples of the extracted vector features
in PACHA and KCF-S that are significant to EC and PIERO. Note
that the predictive model used in this study (i.e. LlSVM) has the
ability of feature extraction. Interestingly, the extracted PACHA
features correspond to the chemical changes that occurred in the
preserved atoms. For example, the feature ‘a:02x:O7x’ repre—
sents the preserved oxygen atom that changes from a cyclic ether to
a cyclic ester, which is one of the typical EC1.1.1 reactions that
causes dehydrogenation of sugars to yield lactone sugars. This
feature was a reasonably important and characteristic feature of
EC1.1.1 and ‘dehydrogenation’. Conversely, the extracted fea—
tures from descriptors—based methods (e.g. KCF—S) were generally
difficult to interpret because descriptor—based methods cannot dis—
tinguish the relationships between preserved atoms and their
chemical changes. All results can be found at http://www.bioreg.
kyushu—u.ac.jp/labo/systemcohort/pacha/.

4.4 Novel prediction

Finally, we conducted a comprehensive prediction of enzymatic reac—
tion—likeness for all possible compound pairs, with the exception of
known substrate—product pairs. We trained a predictive model using
all known substrate—product pairs in the gold standard data (10 852
pairs retrieved from KEGG as of December 2012) and applied the
model to all possible uncharacterized compound—compound pairs (30
719 540 pairs) for which pathways and reaction characteristics were
not known. PACHA and PACHA—I—KCFS predicted 54 919 and 28

brassinosteroids, important steroid hormones that regulate plant de—
velopment and physiology (Ohnishi et al., 2006). This pathway was
successfully reconstructed by our proposed methods but was not re—
constructed by previous methods.

5 Discussion

We developed a novel method for supervised de n0120 metabolic
pathway reconstruction with an improved graph alignment algo-
rithm called PACHA. Our proposed PACHA enabled us to detect
regioisomer—sensitive connectivities between aligned substructures
of two compounds. The novelty of our proposed method lies in the
detection of a unique graph alignment, scalability for analyzing a
vast amount of compounds on a metabolome—scale and applicability
to many tasks in metabolic pathway reconstruction. We showed the
usefulness of the PACHA descriptors for enzymatic reaction—likeness
prediction and reaction annotation with a sparsity—induced
classifier.

This study addressed the importance of the distinction of
regioisomers for metabolic pathway analysis. Although a popular
approach for representing compounds is to use chemical descriptors
that deal with many small chemical substructures, they cannot cor—
rectly consider the substructure connectivity. Thus, the comparison
of two chemical descriptors is insufficient to generate atom—atom
mapping, which makes it impossible for all descriptor—based meth—
ods to describe sensitive chemical changes in a single enzymatic reac-
tion, as illustrated in Figure 1.

SIMCOMP (Hattori et al., 2003), the most related previous
graph—based method, was designed for searching similar compounds
in databases by allowing some small common substructures. The
common procedure in SIMCOMP and PACHA is to generate an as—
sociation graph, where the vertices (association nodes) represent the
atom—atom pairs of two compounds and obtain common sub—
graph(s) considering adjacency. The difference between SIMCOMP
and PACHA lies in the definition of ‘adjacency’ in the association
graph. PACHA defines the association nodes as being adjacent to
each other only when the corresponding atoms are adjacent in both
compounds; therefore, only one common subgraph occurs and the
second common subgraph is not allowed. SIMCOMP defines the as—
sociation nodes to be adjacent either when the corresponding atoms
are adjacent in both compounds or when they are not adjacent in
both compounds. The adjacency in the SIMCOMP association
graph often generates multiple common subgraphs, which are inte—
grated afterwards; however, in some cases, the integrated subgraph
contains many gaps.

Having such gaps is not an issue when finding similar com-
pounds, e.g. for pharmaceutical purposes. However, it is of crucial
importance for metabolic pathway analysis, because most reactions
generate or eliminate only a few chemical bonds. Therefore, the
number of gaps affects the prediction accuracy of enzymatic reac—
tion—likeness. Our proposed PACHA algorithm solved this problem
successfully as demonstrated by significant improvement of the de
n0120 pathway reconstruction, especially in the analysis of isomer-
enriched data. Future extensions would involve the detection of fre—
quent substructure changes and stereoinversions, which requires
more sophisticated tuning of PACHA.

ABSTRACT

Summary: We present a new web server called TAPIR, designed
for the prediction of plant microRNA targets. The server offers the
possibility to search for plant miRNA targets using a fast and a
precise algorithm. The precise option is much slower but guarantees
to find less perfectly paired miRNA-target duplexes. Furthermore,
the precise option allows the prediction of target mimics, which are
characterized by a miRNA-target duplex having a large loop, making
them undetectable by traditional tools.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a prominent class of small
non—coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post—
transcriptional level. In plants, miRNAs are the key regulators
involved in various developmental, stress and cellular responses
(Voinnet, 2009). With the rise of next—generation sequencing data,
new miRNAs are uncovered in various plant genomes at a rapid
pace. One of the major challenges is then to determine their
function, and a crucial step towards this goal is the identiﬁcation
of the miRNAs targets. Candidate targets can be identiﬁed through
base pair complementarity of the miRNA sequence to mRNA
sequences (Rhoades et al., 2002). The miRNA—mRNA duplexes
were originally thought to have few mismatches, G—U pairs and
bulges, but there is now increasing evidence that less perfect
hybridizations might also be functional, leading in some cases to
translational repression rather than cleavage of the target mRNA
(Brodersen et al., 2008; Brodersen and Voinnet, 2009; Dugas and
Bartel, 2008). Recent reports have also revealed the existence
in plants of a phenomenon called miRNA target mimicry, where
miRNA—mRNA duplexes with a large bulge around the cleavage
site actually sequester miRNAs, resulting in an inhibition of the
miRNA activity (Franco—Zorilla et al., 2007). We have designed and
implemented TAPIR, a novel web server dedicated to the prediction
of plant miRNAs, including miRNA target mimics.

2 METHODS

For the detection of miRNA—mRNA duplexes, we use two different
previously published algorithms. The ﬁrst is the classical FASTA local
alignment program, which is very fast but cannot detect the duplexes having
a lot of bulges and/or mismatches (Pearson, 2004). The second algorithm
is RNAhybrid, an algorithm for a precise detection of the miRNA—mRNA
duplexes (Rehmsmeier et al., 2004).

2.1 FASTA search engine

For the FASTA program, the sequences are reverse complemented and
submitted as queries, while the mRNA sequences are submitted as targets. To
maximize the sensitivity, the program is launched with a k—tuple subword size
of l and an e—value cutoff set to 150. The results of the FASTA search are then
parsed to calculate the score of each duplex. Previous work has shown that
the miRNA—mRNA duplex free energy ratio is also an important parameter
to deﬁne valid plant miRNA targets. This parameter is deﬁned by the ratio
of the free energy of the duplex to the free energy of the same duplex having
only perfect matches (Allen et 01., 2005; Schwab et 01., 2005). To calculate
this parameter, the miRNA and the mRNA sequences of the duplexes are
linked by a short sequence forming a loop structure. The free energy of the
structure is then calculated using the ViennaRNA package (Hofacker et al.,
1994).

2.2 RNAhybrid search engine

RNAhybrid is an extension of the classical RNA secondary structure
prediction algorithm (Rehmsmeier et al., 2004). Using a dynamic
programming algorithm, the program calculates the minimum free energy
hybridizations of all possible start positions of the miRNA within the target
sequence, with a restriction on the length of internal bulges and loops.
Furthermore, the free energy of the duplex is precisely calculated and is not
sensitive to artifacts of miRNA—mRNA concatenation (Rehmsmeier et al.,
2004). RNAhybrid has been successfully used to predict novel plant miRNAs
(Alves et al., 2009). The disadvantage of using this algorithm is that it is
considerably slower compared to heuristic local alignment programs like
FASTA. The program is used with default values, except that we request 10
hits per target (option—b 10) and limit the size of gaps to 5 nt on each side
of the duplex (option—u 5). The search results are further parsed to calculate
the target score or to look for miRNA target mimicry pattern.

2.3 miRNA target score

The score calculated for each miRNA—mRNA duplex is the same as the
one used by Allen and colleagues (Allen et al., 2005), which was derived
from previous studies (Rhoades et al., 2002; Schwab et al., 2005). The
score is taking into account the number of mismatches, the number of
gaps (introduced by bulges and loop structures) and the number of G—U
pairs. Moreover, several studies have shown the importance of a ‘seed’ or
‘core’ region of the duplex, in the 5/ region of the miRNA. This region is
signiﬁcantly depleted in mismatches and bulges for valid miRNA targets.

TAPIR

 

The score is taking this fact into account by applying a penalization factor
to mismatches, gaps and G—U pairs located between positions 2 and 12 of
the miRNA sequence

S=Nm+Ng+(0.5'Nu)+(2'Nsm)+(2-ng)+Nsu (l)
where Nm, Ng and Nu are the number of mismatches, gaps and G—U pairs
outside the ‘seed’ region and Nsm, ng and Nsu are the same parameters
within the ‘seed’ region.

2.4 miRNA target mimicry search

MiRNA target mimicry miRNA—mRNA duplexes are characterized by the
presence of a large bulge located within the typical cleavage site for plant
miRNAs, i.e. between the nucleotides 10 and 11 of the miRNA sequence
(Franco—Zorilla et al., 2007). Of course, such patterns cannot be detected by
local alignment programs like FASTA, but the sensitivity of the RNAhybrid
program allow to detect such weak hybridizations. We used the duplex
between miR399 and its target mimic IPSI (Franco—Zorilla et al., 2007)
as a template to deﬁne miRNA target mimic parameters. We retain duplexes
having a bulge of 3 nt between the nucleotides 10 and 11 of the miRNA, for
which the nucleotides 10 and 11 are engaged in a Watson—Crick base pair or
a G—U pair and for which the free energy ratio of the duplex is higher than
a certain cutoff value (by default 0.7).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To test and compare the TAPIR web server algorithms to existing
web tools, we have compiled a reference set of 102 miRNA—target
pairs that have been validated experimentally (the complete list is
available as Supplementary Table 81; Addo—Quaye et al., 2008;
Allen et al., 2005; German et al., 2008). The sensitivity is deﬁned as
the number of pairs that each program can recover from the reference
set. The speciﬁcity is deﬁned by the fraction of predicted pairs that do
not belong to the reference set to the total number of pairs predicted,
assuming that the reference set covers all the true miRNA—target
pairs. Of course, it is very likely that current efforts to validate
predicted targets may have missed a true positive, even for high—
throughput approaches. A true target might be missed because the
choice of the experimental conditions does not match the conditions
in which the miRNA or the target is active, such as speciﬁc biotic
or abiotic stresses. Plant miRNAs have indeed been shown to be
involved in several stress responses (Sunkar and Zhu, 2004). All
the validation methods for plant miRNAs so far are looking for
traces of cleavage products, so one cannot rule out that the target
might be repressed at the translational level rather than cleaved.
Recent studies have shown that translational repression mediated
by miRNAs is more frequent than previously thought in plants
(Brodersen et al., 2008; Brodersen and Voinnet, 2009; Dugas and
Bartel, 2008). As a consequence, the speciﬁcity values calculated
in this study might be biased towards high numbers, because some
false negatives might in fact be true positives. However, by looking
at the difference between two values rather than the absolute values
themselves, we can estimate the fraction of false positives between
two different methods or between different parameters values for the
same method. We performed the sensitivity and speciﬁcity tests for
the TAPIR fast and precise methods using various parameter values,
and we also included in this test two other web tools designed for
the prediction of plant miRNA targets, miRU (Zhang, 2005) and
sRNA target (Moxon et al., 2008). All the results from those tests
are compiled in the Table 1.

The sRNA interface does not allow the user to modify any search
parameter, so we just used the default parameters. For miRU, the

expectation score can be adjusted between different discrete values
and we ran the program with the values 3, 4 and 5 (the latter being
the maximum value allowed). We ran the TAPIR web tool with
the score cutoff values 4, 5 and 7 and free energy ratio cutoff
0.7, 0.7 and 0.6, respectively, for both the fast (FASTA) and the
precise (RNAhybrid) methods. As expected, the fraction of true
positive as well as the false positives is increasing when the cutoff
parameters are lowered for miRU and both the TAPIR methods.
The default (and ﬁxed) parameters of the sRNA target tool are
performing better than the miRU search (score cutoff 3, 4 and 5),
having a higher percentage of true positives (82.4 versus 75.5) and
a lower percentage of false positives (68.3 versus 71.6). The TAPIR
with the FASTA search engine (score cutoff 4) has a higher rate
of true positive (89.2), while keeping the false positives (70.0) to
values that are similar to those of sRNA (68.3) and miRU (71.6).
The TAPIR search with the RNAhybrid engine (score cutoff 4) has
the same value of true positives as with the FASTA engine (89.2)
but the rate of false positives is higher (78.3), due likely to its
increased capability to detect weaker miRNA—mRNA duplexes. If
we compare the TAPIR FASTA and RNAhybrid search engines,
we can see that the latter is giving equal or higher values for true
positives for all score cutoff considered (although the absolute value
increase is not dramatic), but this higher accuracy is coming at the
cost of higher false positive rates. The RNAhybrid search engine is
eventually capable of recovering 100% of the reference set, but with
an extremely high number of false positives (data not shown).

We also benchmarked the TAPIR FASTA and RNAhybrid search
engines on a set of 5000 miRNA—target pairs to determine the
average time for one miRNA—target comparison. The average time
for the FASTA search is 6 X 10‘4 s, while the RNAhybrid search is
0.144 s. This makes the FASTA search about 240 times faster.

We have seen that the sensitivity of the RNAhybrid search over
the FASTA is only slightly better, with a signiﬁcant increase in the
proportion of false positives. Furthermore, we have also seen that
the RNAhybrid search is considerably slower, we can thus conclude
that the FASTA search engine is better suited for rapid, genome wide
searches of plant miRNA targets, while the RNAhybrid search might
be useful for extensive searches for a particular miRNA sequence,
when an increased sensitivity is desirable. Of course, the added value
of the RNAhybrid precision is evident with its capacity to predict the

weak interactions corresponding to target mimics (Franco—Zorilla
et al., 2007), prediction that is absolutely impossible with the FASTA
search engine.

The TAPIR web server is implemented as a user friendly web
interface (no login or E—mail is required), with one tab for the FASTA
(‘Fast’) and one for the RNAhybrid (‘Precise’) search engines. Users
can paste or upload FASTA ﬁles corresponding to the miRNA and
target sequences. Users can also set two parameters for the search,
the score cutoff value (default 4) and the free energy ratio cutoff
value (default 0.7).

By comparison, the sRNA (http://srna—tools.cmp.uea.ac.uk/plant/
cgi—bin/sma—tools.cgi?rm=input_form&tool=target) interface does
not allow any parameter to be changed and only allow to upload
the miRNA sequences. The target database has to be chosen from
a pre—deﬁned list of more than 15 plant species. Furthermore, the
interface does not allow an ‘anonymous’ search and requires the
user to enter a valid E—mail. The search will be started only when
the user will click on the link send to his E—mail address. With the
miRU enhanced interface (http://bioinfo3.noble.org/psRNATarget/),
the user can leave his E—mail as an option and can choose to
either upload both miRNA and target sequences, upload the miRNA
sequences and search a set of pre—deﬁned target sequences (more
than 15 plant genomes) or even upload the target sequences and
use a set of pre—deﬁned plant miRNA sequences. The user can also
set two parameters, the expectation score (threshold corresponding
to the scoring scheme applied to the miRNA—mRNA duplex) and
the maximum circles (iterations of the underlying Smith—Waterman
algorithm to search for multiple hits on the same target sequence).
The miRU results do not report the free energy value or ratio of the
miRNA—mRNA duplexes.

For the TAPIR web interface, once the search is submitted, the
user is redirected to a temporary web page indicating the duration of
the search until it is completed. The page can be bookmarked by the
user for a later check or retrieval of the result. All results are kept for
24h on the server. All the miRNA—target pairs for which the score
is less than or equal to the cutoff value and the free energy ratio is
greater than or equal to the cutoff value are displayed in the results
page. Several parameter values are indicated (names, free energy
ratio, start position of the duplex on the mRNA, seed and non—seed
mismatches, gaps and G—U pairs), plus a full representation of the
miRNA—mRNA duplex with an alignment string (Fig. 1A).

With the ‘Precise’ search comes the ability to look for target
mimics. The user only has to check the corresponding box and set the
free energy ratio cutoff to proceed. The results are displayed in the
same way as for target search (Fig. 1B). The RNAhybrid algorithm
being quite slow, we have pre—computed searches for 10 different

plant genomes and their corresponding miRNAs (the complete list
of genomes is available on the website, within the ‘manual’ pages).
The plant miRNAs were downloaded from miRB ase (Grifﬁths—J ones
et al., 2008). As plant miRNAs can sometimes bind in the UTR
regions, we have used cDNA sequences when available. The users
can use pre—computed data by simply selecting the organism and the
miRNA they are interested in. The raw data is then parsed according
to the parameters selected by the user.

The TAPIR web server is bringing new features compared to
existing solutions (Moxon et al., 2008; Zhang, 2005). The ability
to use two different search engines, the rich output results featuring
a precise calculation of the free energy and free energy ratio,
the possibility to look for target mimics and to use pre—computed
results should make TAPIR a useful resource for the plant research
community.

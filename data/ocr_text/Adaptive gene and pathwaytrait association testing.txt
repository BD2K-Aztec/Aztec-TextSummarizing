Abstract

Background: Gene- and pathway-based analyses offer a useful alternative and complement to the
usual single SNP-based analysis for GWAS. On the other hand, most existing gene- and pathway-
based tests are not highly adaptive, and/or require the availability of individual-level genotype and
phenotype data. It would be desirable to have highly adaptive tests applicable to summary
statistics for single SNPs. This has become increasingly important given the popularity of large-
scale meta-analyses of multiple GWASs and the practical availability of either single GWAS or
meta-analyzed GWAS summary statistics for single SNPs.

Results: We extend two adaptive tests for gene- and pathway-level association with a univariate trait
to the case with GWAS summary statistics without individual-level genotype and phenotype data.
We use the WTCCC GWAS data to evaluate and compare the proposed methods and several existing
methods. We further illustrate their applications to a meta-analyzed dataset to identify genes and
pathways associated with blood pressure, demonstrating the potential usefulness of the proposed

 

methods. The methods are implemented in R package aSPU, freely and publicly available.

1 Introduction

In spite of the tremendous success of genome-wide association stud-
ies (GWASS), due to modest to small effect sizes of the majority of
causal SNPs for complex and common disease, large sample sizes
and more powerful statistical tests are always needed. Furthermore,
even when some associated SNPs or loci are identified by the most
popular single SNP-based analysis, it is often extremely difficult to
offer a functional interpretation that can shed light on the underly-
ing biology. As alternatives, gene- and pathway-based analyses have
been proposed and applied for single traits, demonstrating their use-
ful and complementary roles (Fan et al., 2015; Pan, 2009; Schaid
et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2007, 2010; Wu et al., 2010). A statistical
challenge is that, due to unknown true association patterns, there is
no uniformly most powerful test to detect multiple SNP-single trait
associations; an association test may perform well for one dataset,
but not necessarily for another. For example, the presence of

non-associated SNPs will largely diminish the power of a standard
test if no effective SNP selection or weighting is adopted (Petersen
et al., 2013). Pan et al. (2014) proposed a data-adaptive (aSPU) ap-
proach based on estimating and selecting the most powerful test
among a class of so-called sum of powered score (SPU) tests, which
cover several popular tests as special cases, such as the burden test, a
variance component test and a univariate test. The main idea is to
use various values of a parameter to construct data-driven and vary-
ing weights for the SNPs, thus adaptive to unknown signal sparsity
and association directions among the multiple SNPs being tested.
Furthermore, Pan et al. (2015) extended the methodology to path-
way analysis (aSPUpath). In particular, two parameters are intro-
duced such that the test is adaptive at both the SNP and gene
levels. As demonstrated therein, due to their high data-adaptivity,
the two adaptive tests remained powerful across a wide range of
scenarios.

Adaptive gene- and pathway-trait association testing

However, the two adaptive tests for gene- and pathway-single
trait associations are only applicable to the case with individual-
level genotype and phenotype data. Due to various reasons, it is
often difficult for many researchers to obtain access to individual-
level data. At the same time, it is easier to obtain access to some
summary statistics, e.g. P-values, of individual SNPs in a GWAS. In
addition, use of some summary statistics is often necessary for prac-
tical meta analyses, which have become increasingly popular and
important for complex disease and traits (de Bakker et al., 2008).
Here we propose extending the two highly adaptive tests to the case
with only summary statistics for individual SNPs, demonstrating
their applications to a meta-analyzed GWAS dataset for blood pres-
sure (Ehret et al., 2011).

In numerical examples we compared our methods with gene-
based GATES (Li et al., 2011) and three pathway-based approaches,
GATES-Simes (Gui et al., 2011), HYST (Li et al., 2012) and
MAGMA (de Leeuw et al., 2015). All methods are for a single (uni-
variate) trait. GATES adopts an extended Simes procedure to correct
multiple testing while calculating the P-value quickly based on SNP
summary statistics. GATES-Simes extends the main idea of GATES
to extract the most significant gene-level P-value for a pathway,
whereas HYST uses Fisher’s method to combine multiple genes’
P-values. MAGMA is based on multiple regression. We also con-
sidered one gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method,
i-GSEAGWAS (Zhang et al., 2013), an extension of GSEA
(Subramanian et al., 2005) to GWAS summary statistics. Note that
here our goal is global association testing in the category of ‘self—
contained tests’ with a null hypothesis H0 that none of any genes in
a pathway is associated with disease, in contrast to enrichment or
competitive testing with a null hypothesis H0,E that the proportion
of associated genes in a pathway is no more than that in the rest of
the genes; since rejecting H0,E implies rejecting H0, a global testing
is often more powerful than an enrichment analysis (Goeman et al.,
2007)

The proposed methods are available in R package aSPU, which
is downloadable from CRAN.

2 Methods

We first assume that individual genotype and phenotype data are
available, facilitating the derivation of our proposed methods later.
Suppose for individual i = 1, - - - ,n, we have a quantitative or binary
trait Y,, and a vector of the genotype scores for k SNPs
X,- = (X,1,- - - ,Xik)', possibly drawn from either a single gene or a
pathway with multiple genes. As usual we use the additive coding
for each SNP: Xi,- = 0, 1 or 2 is the count of an allele at SNP j for
subject 1'. We also assume a vector of covariates Wi. We adopt a gen-
eralized linear model (GLM):

k
glE(Yi)l = [30 + ZXijﬁj + (XIV/i,
i=1

where g() is the link function (i.e. the identity function for a quanti-
tative trait, or a logit function for a binary trait). We would like to
test the null hypothesis H0 : [f = (ﬁ1,---,ﬁk)' = 0; that is, there is no
association between any SNP and the trait under H0. The score vec-
tor U = (U1,---,Uk)' forﬁis

U = 2(2- — maxi,
i=1

where 110,,- = E(Y,—|H0) = g_1(Bo + 6c'W,-) is the estimated mean of Y,-
in the null model (under H0). The covariance matrix of U can be
estimated as

(Emma) = Z") (Y.- — 00,0200- — Xxx,- — 70'
i=1

with its mean under H0 as

El<$72<UlHo>l = iatzx, <1)
i=1

where 01-2 = Var(Y,-|H0) and 2X = Cor/(X).

2.1 A gene-based adaptive test with summary statistics
Now, suppose that we do not have individual-level data (Yi, X,)’s
but only single SNP-based summary statistics, say Z-scores
z = (21,...,zk)’ with z,- = ﬁi/semi) z Ui/se(U,-) for j = 1,---,k;
the approximation is based on the asymptotic equivalence between
the Wald test and the score test. A key observation is that

Cov(Z,-,Z1) = Corr(Z,-,Z1)
z Corr(U,-, U1) % COTT(XiiaXil)a

where the last approximation is based on Eq. (1). Note that Corr(X)
can be easily estimated from some reference panel, e.g. the CEU
sample in the Hapmap data or 1000 Genome data, for a similar tar-
get population. Accordingly, we obtain an estimate of Corr(Z,-, Z1),
say R.

Mimicking the SPU and aSPU tests for individual genotype and
phenotype data, we can now define the corresponding tests with
only summary statistics Z:

k
SPUs(y) = SPUs(y; Z) = 22),
i=1
aSPUS(Z) = v€11E1PSPUs(y;Z)a (2)

where PspUs(,;Z) is the P-value of the SPUs ()2; Z) test, and F = {1, 2, . . . ,
8,00} is often used. Note that since SPUs(y; Z) oc ||Z||y —> maxi|Z,-| as
an even integer y —> 00, we deﬁne SPUs(oo; Z) = maxi|Z,-|.

An optimal choice of )2 depends on the unknown SNP-trait asso-
ciation patterns. For example, if most SNPs are (almost) equally
associated with the trait in the same direction, then the burden test
SPUs(1) will be (nearly) most powerful; if only one or few SNPs are
associated with the trait, then using a larger )2, e.g. SPUs(8) or
SPUs(oo), is expected to be more powerful; on the other hand, if the
truth is between the above two extremes, then using an intermediate
1 < y < 8, e.g. SPUs(2) that is similar to a variance-component test
like KMR or SKAT (Liu et al., 2007; Pan, 2011; Wu et al., 2010),
may have higher power. Note that SPUs(oo) is exactly the same as
the univariate minimum P-value method most often used in GWAS.
Since we do not know the optimal value of y, we try multiple ones in
F and then estimate and select the best one by aSPUs. Note that, in
our experience, often SPUs(8) and SPUs(oo) give almost identical re-
sults, hence we do not try any )2 values between 8 and 00 in F.

By the asymptotic distribution of U, we know that for a large 11,
under H0, Z follows a multivariate normal distribution N(0, R),
where R is the correlation matrix of X,- that can be estimated from
some reference panel as discussed. Based on this known null distri-
bution of Z, we use Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the P-values
of the SPUs and aSPUs tests. Specifically, (i) we generate

independent ZU’) N N (0,R) for b = 1, - - - ,B; (ii) calculate the null
SPU test statistics SPUs(y;Z(b)); (iii) the P-value for SPUs(y;Z) is
25:1[I(|SPUs(y;Z(b))| 2 |SPUs(y;Z)|) + 1]/(B + 1), and that for
SPUs(v;Z(”)) is P)” = 2191749 1(ISPUs(v;Z(”1’)| 2 ISPUs(v;Z(”))l)/
(B — 1); (iv) calculate aSPUs(Z(b)) = minverPg’); (v) finally the
P-value for the aSPUs test is PaspUs 2 25:1 [I (aSPUs(Z(b)) S
aSPUs(Z)) + 1] /(B + 1).

Sometimes only the P-values for individual SNPs are available
while we do not know the association direction for each SNP. In this
case, we calculate |Z,-| = (I)_1(1 — 1),/2), where p,- is the P-value for
SNP j and (I)() is the CDF of the standard normal distribution
N (0, 1). Then we will replace Zi’s by |Z,-|’ s in the above formula (2)
(and do so similarly for the null statistics too).

2.2 A pathway-based adaptive test with

summary statistics

The idea of substituting a Score vector with Z-scores can be simi-
larly extended to an adaptive pathway-level test (Pan et al., 2015).
Given a pathway S with |S| genes, we partition its Z-scores as
Z = (Z’1_,---,Z(Sl_)' with subvector Zg_ : (Zg1,Zg2,---,ngg)' for
gene g (with kg SNPs). Then we define the gene- and pathway-based
SPU tests as

kg 1/1’
SPU(v;g) = IIZg.II. = (Z 2.2/kg) ’
i=1

PathSPU(v, VG; S) = Z 5PU(v; g)“,
gES

where two integers y > 0 and yG > 0 are used to adaptively weight
the SNPs and genes respectively. For example, a larger 32G (or y) is
more effective when there are a smaller number of genes (or SNPs)
associated with the trait. Since the optimal values of (y, m) are un-
known, to adaptively choose (y, m), we propose
aSPUSPath(S) = veggérg PPathSPU(y,yG;S)7

aiming to select the most powerful one from multiple PathSPU tests.
We used F = {1,2,...,8,oo} and Pg 2 {1,2,4,8} as in Pan et al.
(2015). A Monte Carlo simulation scheme as described for the SPUs
and aSPUs tests is used to obtain the P-values. However, now the di-
mension of Z is possibly larger, leading to a much larger correlation
matrix R. For computational efficiency, we assume that any SNPs in
different chromosomes are independent, leading to a block-diagonal R.

Given that most genes and pathways will not be significant in
most applications, we employ a stage-wise strategy to gradually in-
crease the simulation number B to save computing time for aSPUs
and aSPUsPath. In the later applications, we first performed B =
5000 simulations for all genes and pathways, and then increased
B to 106 or 107 for those genes (or 105 for pathways) with a
P-value < 0.003.

3 Applications
3.1 WTCCC data

To demonstrate the validity and performance of our proposed
method, we designed a ‘Control—Control’ experiment and a usual
Case—Control experiment using Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium (WTCCC) GWAS data for Crohn’s disease (CD)

(Consortium, 2007). CD is an autoimmune disease with a strong
genetic component. The WTCCC GWAS dataset contains about
2000 CD-affected cases and about 3000 controls with a total of 500
568 SNPs. Following the WTCCC’s quality control (QC) recom-
mendations, we removed subjects and SNPs that did not pass the
QC criteria, resulting in 469 612 SNPs in 1748 case subjects and
2938 control subjects. We further removed SNPs with MAF <5 %
since we would use a small reference panel to infer the LD structure
for a set of SNPs.

In a Control—Control experiment, we randomly divided the con-
trols into two groups, each with 1469 samples, then tested for pos-
sible association between the group indicator and a gene or a
pathway. Since no association was expected, the goal was to investi-
gate how well a method could control type I errors or false positives.
In a Case—Control analysis, the two groups contained 1748 cases
and 2938 controls respectively, and we’d like to see the power of a
method to detect possible associations. We calculated the Z-score
for each SNP based on individual-level data, then used only the
Z-scores in subsequent analyses for any summary statistics-based
method. We analyzed 4572 genes mapped to 186 KEGG pathways.
The significance threshold after the Bonferroni correction was
0.05/4572 = 1.09 X 10_5 for gene-based analysis, or 005/186 2
0.000268 for pathway-based analysis. The simulation number of
B = 106 was used as a default, though we also used B = 105 for
comparison in aSPUs and aSPUsPath.

3.1.1 Choice of the reference panels

We first investigated how the choice of the reference panels in esti-
mating LD among SNPs might inﬂuence the performance. We con-
sidered three ways to estimate a correlation matrix R among the
SNPs: using (i) 90 Hapmap CEU samples, (ii) 100 randomly chosen
WTCCC control samples and (iii) the whole 2938 WTCCC
controls.

Figure 1 shows the QQ plots of the aSPUs P-values based on
each of the three ways to estimate the correlation matrix for the
Control—Control experiment (upper row) and Case—Control experi-
ment (lower row). Based on the Control—Control analysis, we con-
clude that using the Hapmap samples seemed to give a bit inflated
type I errors while the other two performed well. The less desirable
performance of using the Hapmap samples could be due to the small
sample size, leading to unstable estimates. However, by comparison
with that of using 100 WTCCC controls, it was more likely due to
some inherent differences between the two panels.

Treating using the whole WTCCC controls as the gold standard,
we compared in more details about the estimated P-values in
Figure 2. Most points are on the identity line. However some points
are above the line, implying that using the Hapmap panel over-esti-
mated the significance levels of several genes (i.e. with smaller P-
values). Nevertheless, the agreement of the aSPUs P-values based on
the reference panels was high: their correlation coefficients in both
experiments were 0.98. In summary, the performance using any ref-
erence panel was mostly satisfactory with an estimated inﬂation fac-
tor 2 close to 1 (e.g. 2 = 1.07 for the Hapmap panel for the
Control—Control experiment of the WTCCC data).

For comparison, we also included the QQ-plots for GATES in
Supplementary Figure S1. Since GATES uses a few most significant
P-values to reach a gene-level P-value, it is more robust to estima-
tion errors of the LD structure among SNPs, giving less inflated sig-
nificance levels in the extreme. However, due to its numerical

approximations in P-value calculations, it had slightly higher infla-

3.1.2 Choice of simulation number

Next we investigated the effects of the simulation number B on the
P-value of the aSPUs test. Figure 3 compares the results with B
= 105 versus B = 106; we used either the 100 Hapmap samples or
the whole WTCCC controls to estimate the correlation matrices in
the Control—Control or Case—Control analysis. Overall there was
barely any difference between using B = 105 and B = 106. As ex-
pected, the more significant a P-value, a larger B is required. In par-
ticular, B = 106 would be sufficient to estimate P-values 2 0.00001
for most genes.

3.1.3 Pathway analysis

We first investigated how the choice of the reference panel might in-
ﬂuence the performance of a pathway-level test. Again we used ei-
ther the 90 Hapmap samples or all WTCCC controls to estimate the
correlation matrices. Figure 4 compares the results for each of the
three methods, aSPUsPath, GATES-Simes and HYST. Perhaps due
to more SNPs in a gene set (pathway), aSPUsPath appeared to be
more robust than aSPUs to estimation errors using a small reference
panel. Again GATES-Simes was very robust due to its use of only a

few top SNPs and genes to construct its test statistic. GATES-Simes
identified the same 5 pathways with any choice of the reference pan-
els based on the threshold of P < 0.00025. HYST seemed to be
more inﬂuenced by incorrectly estimated correlation matrices (due
to its using Fisher’s method to combine the P-values of all the genes
in a pathway). HYST identified the same 3 pathways using either
the Hapmap panel or 100 WTCCC controls. However, it identified
12 pathways using all WTCCC controls as the reference panel. This
indicates that the accuracy of estimating the correlation matrix is
critical to HYST. In comparison, aSPUsPath identified 17 significant
pathways using either the 100 or all WTCCC controls as the refer-
ence panel, among which 15 pathways were common; the Pearson
correlation between the two sets of the P-values was 0.998. Using
the Hapmap panel, aSPUsPath identified 16 significant pathways,
among which 11 pathways were common with those identified by
using the whole WTCCC control as the reference panel.

Table 1 shows 17 highly significant KEGG pathways with P-
values less than 0.00001 by any of the three methods. The
aSPUsPath identified nine such highly significant pathways using ei-
ther all or 100 WTCCC controls as the reference panel, a much
larger number than those of the other two methods, suggesting pos-
sibly higher power of aSPUsPath for the WTCCC data.
Furthermore, the close performance between using the two sets of
the WTCCC controls as reference panels suggested that using 100
samples from the corresponding population worked well enough in
identifying significant pathways.

The five KEGG pathways that have been confirmed to be associ-
ated with susceptibility to CD by meta-analysis and replication stud-
ies (Franke et al., 2010; Jostins et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2010) are
all among the 17 significant pathways.

We also performed analysis with one GSEA method,
i-GSEA4GWAS, but it did not find any significant pathway.

3.2 ICBP data

We illustrate the application of the methods to the summary statis-
tics of a meta analysis by the International Consortium for Blood
Pressure Genome-Wide Association Studies (ICBP GWAS) (Ehret
et al., 2011). The data include the P-values of 2.6 million SNPs for
the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) based on the discovery sample of
29 studies with 69 395 individuals of European ancestry. We ob-
tained the genomic coordinates of the SNPs and genes according to
the human reference genome hg19, and assigned SNPs within 2kb
upstream or downstream a gene to the gene using software
MAGMA (de Leeuw et al., 2015). About 1 095 843 (41.04%) SNPs
were mapped into at least one of 17543 genes. We set the gene-level
significance threshold at 0.05/17543 = 2.85 X 10_6 based on the
Bonferroni correction. We used the Hapmap CEU reference panel to
estimate the correlations among the SNPs, downloaded from the
Plink website (Purcell et al., 2007).

3.2.1 Gene-based analysis
Figure 5 shows the significant genes identified by aSPUs, GATES (Li
et al., 2011), VEGAS (Liu et al., 2010) and MAGMA (de Leeuw
et al., 2015). We implemented the first two methods but used the
original software for the latter two. In total 49 significant genes
were identified by at least one method, in which 14 were common
across all the methods. In comparison with a single SNP-based ana-
lysis, Ehret et al. (2011) identified 29 significant independent SNPs
in 28 loci/genes for SBP and/or diastolic BP (DBP) based on a much
larger sample combining both the discovery and validation samples
with up to 133 661 additional individuals; even so, if only SBP was
considered, 4 of the 29 SNPs were no longer significant. In contrast,
as shown in Figure 5, 12 genes out of the 28 loci were detected by
gene-based testing with a much smaller sample size of the discovery
sample. In fact, based on single SNP analysis of only the discovery
sample as used here, only 8 of the 29 independent SNPs/loci in
Table 1 of Ehret et al. (2011) were significant. The Manhattan plots
for the various methods are shown in Supplementary Figure S5.
Since GATES is essentially a univariate method with a modified
Simes procedure for multiple testing adjustment, as expected, its re-
sults were similar to that of SPUs(oo), which is the univariate min-
imum P-value method: SPUs(oo) detected 32 associated genes,
among which 28 genes overlapped with those of GATES; in com-
parison, SPUs(1) and SPUs(2) identified 25 and 28 significant genes,
among which only 17 and 20 genes were common to those of
GATES. On the other hand, the test statistic of VEGAS is
2:1 Z/-2 = SPUs(2), though VEGAS was implemented differently in

Fig. 6. The significant gene ULK4 that was uniquely identified by aSPUs. The
locus was also one of 28 loci identified by Ehret et al. (2011) by single SNP
analysis with a much larger sample size

SNP/gene mapping and covariance estimation (Liu et al., 2010), we
would still expect that VEGAS and SPUs(2) performed similarly: it
was confirmed that 21 of the 28 genes identified by SPUs(2) over-
lapped with that of VEGAS.

The gene ULK4 was uniquely identified by aSPUs. As shown in
Figure 6, gene ULK4 contains many nearly significant SNPs and
many non-significant SNPs, requiring an adaptive test like aSPUs
with effective SNP weighting (or selection) to detect it. For gene
HIST1H4C that was identified by GATES but not by other meth-
ods, it contained 11 SNPs; only one of the SNPs had a P-value
around 2e-7 while those for other SNPs were all around 0.1 or 0.01.
The P-values of aSPUs, GATES, MAGMA and VEGAS were 4.70e-
6, 1.29e-6, 0.0015 and 0.00023 respectively. Due to the sparse sig-
nal with only one significant SNP, it favored a univariate method

like GATES; nevertheless, due to the inclusion of SPU(oo) (with a P-
value of 2.0e-6), the P-value of the aSPUs test was almost signifi-
cant. Now consider another gene BRAP that was identified by
aSPUs, VEGAS and MAGMA but not by GATES. It contained 10
SNPs, 6 of which were with a P-value around 2e-6 while other SNPs
were much less significant. The P-values of aSPUs, GATES,
MAGMA and VEGAS were 1.3e-6, 5.06e-6, 2.065e-7 and 1e-7 re-
spectively, confirming an advantage of aSPUs in accumulating non-
sparse and weak signals with multiple moderately associated SNPs.

3.2.2 Pathway-based analysis
Finally we conducted a pathway-level analysis. We used the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways (Kanehisa
et al., 2010) downloaded from MSigDB (Subramanian et al., 2005 ).
There were 186 pathways with 4874 genes and 309 347 SNPs
mapped for trait DBP. We restricted the analysis to SNPs with MAF
25%. We randomly removed some adjacent SNPs within 50kb
in high LD with r > 0.9 based on the genotype data of the
Hapmap CEU sample (release 2). We set the significance threshold
at 0.05 / 186 = 0.000268 based on the Bonferroni correction.

In total 42 pathways were identified to be significant, including
24 by aSPUsPath, 38 by GATES-Simes, 34 by Hyst and 7 by
MAGMA, as shown in Figure 7. Here GATES-Simes and Hyst iden-
tified more pathways than aSPUsPath and MAGMA. Nevertheless,
aSPUsPath uniquely identified ‘hsa04010 MAPK signaling path-
way’, which contains 254 genes, including 4 known BP-related genes
in Table 1 of Ehret et al. (2011); out of a total of 16503 SNPs in this
pathway, 55, 21 and 6 SNPs were significant at P < 1e-5, 1e-6 and
1e-7 respectively, demonstrating multiple moderate associations (in
multiple genes) and thus lower power of a univariate test like
GATES-Simes.

4 Discussion

We have proposed two adaptive tests, aSPUs and aSPUsPath, re-
spectively for gene- and pathway-level association analyses of a uni-
variate trait with the availability of only summary statistics, such as
Z-statistics or P-values, for individual SNPs. With only summary
statistics like Z-statistics or P-values, one has to recourse to some
reference panel to estimate LD or correlations among SNPs, which

might influence the performance of subsequent association testing.
Overall, the P-values calculated from using different panels were
similar as shown in our analysis of the WTCCC data. However, de-
pending on the reference panels being used, the results for a small
number of the genes or pathways could be different. Hence, caution
must be taken, and an independent validation on any detected asso-
ciations based on summary statistics becomes more important.

We have further illustrated the application of the proposed meth-
ods to a meta-analyzed GWAS data, demonstrating their usefulness
as compared to the popular single SNP-based analysis. In addition,
we have compared their performance with several other existing
tests. Since there is no uniformly most powerful test for multiple
SNPs, it would be desirable to have an adaptive test that can ro-
bustly maintain high, not necessarily highest, power across various
scenarios, which motivated our proposed two tests (Pan et al., 2014,
2015). Our proposed tests offer an alternative and complement to
existing gene- and pathway-level association testing. We have de-
veloped an R package aSPU to facilitate their use.

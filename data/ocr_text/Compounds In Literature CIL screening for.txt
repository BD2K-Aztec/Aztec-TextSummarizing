ABSTRACT

Summary: Searching for certain compounds in literature can be
an elaborate task, with many compounds having several different
synonyms. Often, only the structure is known but not its name.
Furthermore, rarely investigated compounds may not be described
in the available literature at all. In such cases, preceding searches for
described similar compounds facilitate literature mining. Highlighted
names of proteins in selected texts may further accelerate the time-
consuming process of literary research. Compounds ln Literature
(CIL) provides a web interface to automatically find names,
structures, and similar structures in over 28 million compounds of
PubChem and more than 18 million citations provided by the PubMed
service. ClL’s pre-calculated database contains more than 56 million
parent compound—abstract relations. Found compounds, relatives
and abstracts are related to proteins in a concise ‘heat map’-like
overview. Compounds and proteins are highlighted in their respective
abstracts, and are provided with links to PubChem and UniProt.
Availability: An easy-to-use web interface with detailed
descriptions, help and statistics is available from
http://cil.pharmaceutical-bioinformatics.de.

1 INTRODUCTION

The search for certain compounds in PubMed (http://www.ncbi
.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) as the largest repository of biomedical
citations is an elaborate task for several reasons: (i) the vast
and rapidly growing number of citations leads to time—consuming
searches, particularly if researchers do not want to solely rely on
MeSH (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh) indexing and author—given
keywords. Furthermore, information on compounds may be hidden
in the context because the authors did not mention them exclusively
as key words. (ii) Compounds can have a variety of different
synonyms (more than 4 in 6.5% of all PubChem compounds), and
each synonym should be searched to achieve a comprehensive result.
(iii) If researchers do not know the exact name, a structure search
has to be conducted ﬁrst. (iv) A compound is newly—discovered or

developed and therefore not or only rarely described in literature.
Thus, preceding similarity searches can ﬁnd compounds giving hints
on potential biological actions. (V) To assess the biological context
of the compound (i.e. interacting proteins), large parts of the texts
have to be read. (vi) Considering such points, the problem of search
duration arises but the result is desired instantly.

Several published approaches exist for text mining and
information retrieval for compounds (Hettne et al., 2009),
proteins (Hur et al., 2009; Rebholz—Schuhmann et al., 2008) and
combinations (Kuhn et al., 2010; Rebholz—Schuhmann et al., 2007;
Zhu et al., 2010). The publicly available compound resource
PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) contains options for
2D similarity searches. Some of the existing tools cannot be
seamlessly integrated in the desired workﬂow, while others lack
a concise and comprehensive result overview. Thus, Compounds
In Literature (CIL) was developed, a webserver that combines
the related tasks of compound and literature screening. An
extended computer infrastructure, specialized algorithms and data
structures were used to provide a user—friendly tool for compound—
related research. CIL—results provide a ‘heat map’—like overview,
comprising compounds, similar compounds, proteins and citations
with highlighted found entities. Using this kind of structured and
comprehensible information, CIL allows for analyses of obvious
and hidden potential biological functions of compounds.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

All PubMed citations and abstracts beginning with 1975 up to 2010 were
downloaded and are available in CIL (more than 18 million citations, about 10
million abstracts). Additionally, titles, abstracts, keywords, substance terms
and MeSH terms were stored in a full—text index. The 28 million PubChem
compounds with 55 million synonyms were downloaded and are locally
available in database structures allowing for fast SMILES and InChI key
searches and 2D similarity comparisons. For quick and efﬁcient compound
searches, CIL has a pre—built database using the ﬁrst ﬁve synonyms of
each compound for searches in every citation and abstract. Searches were
conducted using the pre—processing steps described by Hettne et al. (2009).
Additionally, we applied a self—generated stop word list for compound
synonyms (‘Background’ page —> Drug speciﬁc stop words). Furthermore,
CIL allows for searches using the index and stop word lists with individually
composed compound synonym sets. Proteins in all PubMed articles were
retrieved via the text processing system Whatizit, which is able to ﬁnd
protein synonyms contained in UniProt (Rebholz—Schuhmann et 01., 2008).
An additional protein stop word list was generated to enhance speciﬁcity
( ‘Background’ page —> Protein—speciﬁc stop words). Thus, co—occurrences

of compounds and proteins could be retrieved from the CIL database. Updates
take place every 6 months.

3 RESULTS

The pre—calculated database contains more than 56 million parent
compound—abstract and more than 133 million protein—abstract
relationships. Detailed statistics are provided on the ‘Statistics’
page. CIL achieved a higher F —score (60%, precision: 52%, recall:
72%) compared to the results based on PubChem synonyms of
Hettne et al. (2009, F —score: 47%, precision: 73%, recall: 35%).
The CIL workﬂow is shown in Figure l. CIL can be queried with
compound synonyms, SMILES, InChI keys or drawn structures.
Results can be obtained (i) with one click using the carefully pre—
selected parameters and pre—calculated database, or (ii) by using
the free text search and adjusting proteins’ source organisms, noise
ﬁlter, tanimoto coefﬁcient for similarity searches and including
or excluding certain compound synonyms. Results can be further
reﬁned by user—deﬁned parameter settings. Search duration using
the pre—calculated database primarily depends on the number of
found similar compounds and limitations of the browser to quickly
display large tables. Using the free text search, data retrieval
from the text—index causes additional delay, thus CIL provides
the possibility for the user to estimate search times. The resulting
coloured table (Fig. lb) displays the queried compound and relatives
in columns. The header contains synonyms, structures and respective
tanimoto coefﬁcients as well as links to the PubChem database.
Row headers contain proteins and associated synonyms and direct
links to the UniProt database (http://www.uniprot.org). Table cells
denote the number of found citations containing corresponding
compounds and proteins. Furthermore, numbers are indicated by
gradient colour shades. Cells are linked to the corresponding
citations with highlighted compound and protein synonyms, which
are also linked to their respective PubChem and UniProt entries
(Fig. 1c). Further links to the PubMed literature service are also
speciﬁed. Each component of the workﬂow is extensively provided
with ‘quick helps’, providing background and additional information
for each step. The CIL web site contains comprehensive help

and FAQs—with detailed explanations of each step of the search,
including how to use the different options. Abackground information
section provides details on data sources, the building process and
supplies e. g. utilized stop word lists.

4 CONCLUSION

CIL combines several tasks in one workﬂow—offering a one—click
solution for otherwise elaborate, separated and time—consuming
tasks. Initially searching with compound names, SMILES, InChI
keys or structures, query compounds as well as similar compounds
are identiﬁed in biomedical literature and are related to proteins
named in the same context. Results are displayed in a concise
table. CIL combines the three large datasets of PubMed, PubChem
and UniProt. Given the vast number of compounds, proteins
and biomedical literature, searching for information on biological
functions of the query compound can be conducted in a
shorter time.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: A typical genome-wide association study searches for
associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a
univariate phenotype. However, there is a growing interest to investi-
gate associations between genomics data and multivariate pheno-
types, for example, in gene expression or metabolomics studies. A
common approach is to perform a univariate test between each geno-
type—phenotype pair, and then to apply a stringent significance cutoff
to account for the large number of tests performed. However, this
approach has limited ability to uncover dependencies involving mul-
tiple variables. Another trend in the current genetics is the investigation
of the impact of rare variants on the phenotype, where the standard
methods often fail owing to lack of power when the minor allele is
present in only a limited number of individuals.

Results: We propose a new statistical approach based on Bayesian
reduced rank regression to assess the impact of multiple SNPs on a
high-dimensional phenotype. Because of the method’s ability to com-
bine information over multiple SNPs and phenotypes, it is particularly
suitable for detecting associations involving rare variants. We demon-
strate the potential of our method and compare it with alternatives
using the Northern Finland Birth Cohort with 4702 individuals, for

1 INTRODUCTION

Concentrations of human metabolites are associated with risk of
many common diseases; for example, low— and high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol (LDL and HDL) levels are associated with
coronary artery disease. For this reason, human metabolism has
been under intensive investigation and over the past few years
several genome-wide association studies have successfully un-
covered a part of its genetic basis (Kettunen et al., 2012;

Gene-metabolome associations

 

Sabatti et al., 2008; Suhre et al., 2011; Teslovich et al., 2010). For
example, a large meta-analysis (Teslovich et al., 2010) identiﬁed
95 loci inﬂuencing the levels of total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and
triglycerides. More recent studies used ﬁner subclassiﬁcations of
metabolites and discovered dozens of novel loci (Kettunen et al.,
2012; Suhre et al., 2011). Despite these advances, the variance
explained by all reported single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) falls far below the suggested heritability of the common
metabolites, as estimated either from twin studies (Kettunen
et al., 2012) or from more distantly related individuals
(Vattikuti et al., 2012). This motivates us to develop new
approaches for association testing that could better use all infor-
mation available to us.

The present-day cohort studies often come with a rich set of
phenotypic features. Examples in addition to metabolomics
(Kettunen et al., 2012; Soininen et al., 2009; Suhre et al., 2011)
include studies of gene expression (Ackermann et al., 2013) and
3D-facial imaging (Hammond and Suttie, 2012). As a conse-
quence, we need statistical methods that increase the power to
uncover genotype—phenotype dependencies by combining infor-
mation over several related phenotypes (Ferreira and Purcell,
2009; Inouye et al., 2012; O’Reilly et al., 2012). The underlying
idea is that if a genetic variant affects a trait, then it is likely to
affect other traits that are related to the first one and, by testing
for association with the two traits jointly, power may be
increased. This reasoning can be taken a step further by testing
all traits in high-dimensional omics data simultaneously, for ex-
ample, all metabolites in comprehensive metabolomic proﬁles. A
comparison of different statistical methods available for joint
testing of complete metabolomics proﬁles was recently con-
ducted (Marttinen et al., 2013).

Besides testing several phenotypes simultaneously, the ability
to detect certain kinds of associations may be boosted by com-
bining statistical evidence over several SNPs. Usually this is done
in a supervised manner, such that SNPS related by location or
function, for example, are tested simultaneously. Combining
information over multiple SNPs is particularly crucial with rare
variants, i.e. SNPs where the minor allele is present in a small
proportion of the population. Testing such SNPs individually is
unlikely to yield signiﬁcant ﬁndings because of limited power.
Most approaches for handling rare variants are based on collap-
sing several rare SNPs into a single variable (Bansal et al., 2010).
For example, one can simply collapse several rare variants into a
single indicator, telling whether any of the rare variants is present
in the individual (Morgenthaler and Thilly, 2007) or to count the
number of rare variants present in the individual (Morris and
Zeggini, 2010). The problem with the collapsing methods is the
implicit assumption that the effects are in the same (or a prede-
ﬁned) direction. A more sophisticated variance component
method avoiding this assumption is able to investigate the
impact of several rare variants on a univariate trait (Wu et al.,
2011).

Even if there exists a large number of methods for analyzing
rare variants, none of those has been tailored for multivariate
phenotypes. On the other hand, standard methods for multivari-
ate phenotypes (Ferreira and Purcell, 2009) have not been thor-
oughly investigated in the context of rare variants, and we will
see later in the text that severe overﬁtting may occur.

In summary, methods for dealing with rare variants in the con-
text of multivariate phenotypes are clearly lacking.

In this article, we derive a novel formulation of the Bayesian
reduced rank regression model (Geweke, 1996) to detect multi-
variate associations between predeﬁned groups of SNPs and a
high-dimensional phenotype. In particular, our approach is suit-
able for analyzing both common and rare variants. Our formu-
lation incorporates prior knowledge about effect sizes to increase
the power to detect associations. Furthermore, it is capable of
correcting for the number of SNPs considered, which is import-
ant when testing a large number of SNP groups of different sizes.
We validate our method by assessing associations between SNPs
in all human genes, one gene at a time, and metabolic proﬁles
comprising ﬁne-scale lipoprotein measurements for 4702 individ-
uals from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (Rantakallio,
1969; Sabatti et al., 2008). Among the top-scoring genes without
known associations to the traits studied, two genes (X RCC4 and
M T HFD2L) replicated in a combined analysis of 2390 individ-
uals from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study (YFS;
Raitakari et al., 2008) and 3659 individuals from the FINRISK
study (Vartiainen et al., 2010). Additional analyses of the same
data conﬁrmed that alternative methods discovered only one of
these associations and did not identify any further associations
that were not known before.

2 METHODS

2.1 Model

To build our model, we assume that the phenotypes may be affected by
three kinds of variables, (i) known factors, such as age, sex or population
structure, (ii) unknown factors, such as experimental conditions and other
batch effects, and (iii) SNPs under consideration, as schematically pre-
sented in Figure 1. In contrast to standard regression, where each SNP—
phenotype pair has a parameter representing the effect of the SNP on the
phenotype, here we assume that a combination of several SNPs is inﬂu-
encing several phenotypes through some unknown factors. This assump-
tion is compactly expressed in terms of the reduced rank regression,
where the SNPs are ﬁrst projected onto a low-dimensional subspace,
and the projections are then used as regressors when predicting the
phenotypes. The reduced rank regression formulation immediately
implies some structural assumptions deemed sensible in the current set-
ting: ﬁrst, if a SNP has an effect on a phenotype, then the SNP is likely to
have an effect on other phenotypes; second, if a phenotype is affected by a
SNP, then the phenotype is more likely to be affected by other related
SNPs as well.

Let N denote the number of individuals, S the number of SNPs, P the
number of phenotypes and C the number of other covariates. Formally,
we consider the Bayesian reduced rank regression model

Y=XIIJF+ZA+HAT+E (1)

where YNX p contains the phenotypes, X ng contains the SNPs, 111ng1
and PK, Xp represent a low-rank approximation for the regression coefﬁ-
cient matrix 8 = 1H“, Z Nxc represents other covariates with the corres-
ponding coefﬁcient matrix ACX p, H NX K2 contains hidden confounding
factors with the corresponding coefﬁcient matrix A pX K2 and
Epr = [61, ...,eN]T, with 6, ~ N(0, E), where E = diag(of, ...,0120).
Note that by integrating over the hidden factors H, the model is equiva-
lent to

y,- ~ N(®Tx,- + ATzi, AAT + 2), i: 1, ...,N (2)

dencies between them. The phenotypes Y are assumed to be affected by
known factors, such as age or sex, unknown factors, such as batch effects
caused by varying experimental conditions, and the SNPs. The inﬂuence
of the SNPs is mediated by unknown combinations of the original SNPs,
represented by black squares. (B) The same model using matrix notation.
Matrices containing the observed variables, Y (the phenotypes), X (the
SNPs) and Z (known factors), are blue. The regression coefﬁcient matri-
ces are red. Note that the coefﬁcient matrix for the SNP effects is written
as a product of two matrices, III and I“, corresponding to a low-rank
approximation to an unconstrained coefﬁcient matrix. The brown matri-
ces comprise unobserved variables, H (unknown factors) and E (noise
terms)

where it is assumed that the factors have independent standard normal
prior distributions. Therefore, we see that having the latent variable part
HAT in the model corresponds to assuming a low-rank approximation to
the full covariance matrix, which is important when analyzing high-
dimensional datasets.

For computational reasons, we restrict the rank of the regression
model, K1, to unity in our genome-wide analysis (w.l.o.g. in the detection
task, see below) and show results with K1 2 1, 2, 3 for a few representa-
tive examples. However, here we present a general inﬁnite-dimensional
framework available in our implementation, which does not necessitate
the selection of a ﬁxed rank. In general, to use the Bayesian reduced rank
regression model, the rank of the model, K1, and the rank of the low-rank
approximation for the covariance matrix, K2, must be selected. A recent
Bayesian inﬁnite sparse factor analysis model (Bhattacharya and
Dunson, 2011) circumvents the selection of a ﬁxed rank for K2 by assum-
ing in principle an inﬁnite number of columns in the A matrix; however,
the columns shrink progressively such that only the ﬁrst ranks are inﬂu-
ential in practice. We assume this prior formulation for our noise model
HAT + E. We exploit the idea further by allowing also the rank K1 to be
inﬁnite in principle, and enforcing the low-rank nature by shrinking the
columns of III and the rows of I“ increasingly as the column/row index
grows. In practice, one needs to specify upper bounds for K1 and [(2. We
select the upper bound for K2 using the adaptive procedure of
Bhattacharya and Dunson (2011), and we have implemented an analo-
gous method for learning the upper bound for K1. In practice, we wanted
to minimize the model complexity to maximize the power to detect asso-
ciations and speed up the computations. Therefore, we decided to run the
genome-wide analysis (see Section 3.1) using a ﬁxed rank K1 2 1. The
model with K1 2 1 is sufﬁcient for our purposes of detecting whether a
gene is unrelated to the phenotypes (in which case, rank zero would
already be sufﬁcient), although for prediction a higher rank might be

more suitable. We experimented with a selected set of known genes
with upper bounds 2 and 3 (see below) and noticed that the effect of
increasing the upper bound from unity had only a small impact on the
amount of variation that is explained by the model. From the biological
perspective, this means that the inﬂuence of a gene on the phenotypes can
mostly be described in terms of a single latent factor mediating the effect.
A detailed model description is given in Supplementary Section 1.

The model is related to many published methods, and a thorough
comparison can be found in Supplementary Section 2. Correction for
unknown factors has recently been considered with the standard regres-
sion model, typically for just one SNP at a time (Fusi et al., 2012; Stegle
et al., 2010). The difference to the original Bayesian reduced rank regres-
sion formulation (Geweke, 1996) is that our model uses low-rank ap-
proximation to the covariance matrix, making it more suitable for
high-dimensional phenotypes, and informative prior distributions accom-
modating problem-speciﬁc knowledge. Furthermore, we use the model in
a new way, as described in the subsequent sections. The Bayesian inﬁnite
sparse factor analysis model has been used for high-dimensional data
(Bhattacharya and Dunson, 2011); here, we use it to represent the multi-
variate noise. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a classical tool for
modeling multivariate dependencies that have recently been introduced in
the association study context (Ferreira and Purcell, 2009; Hotelling,
1936). Sparse CCA (Parkhomenko et al., 2009; Waaijenborg et al.,
2008; Witten and Tibshirani, 2009) is more suitable to high-dimensional
datasets; however, introducing prior distributions for CCA that would be
intuitive in the association study context does not seem straightforward.

2.2 Proportion of total variation explained

A commonly used measure of the impact of multiple SNPs, say
x1, .. . , XS, on a univariate trait y is the proportion of variance explained
(PVE) by the SNPs:

Var(y —  ciixi)
Var(y)

_ Var(Z;:1 éixi)

_ Var(y) '

Here, 1 éix, is a linear prediction for the phenotype )2, given the SNPs.
Analogously, as a measure of the overall impact of multiple SNPs on a
high-dimensional phenotype, we propose to use the proportion of total
variation of the phenotypes explained (PTVE) by the model, namely

_ Tr(Cov(Y))
_ Tr(COV( Y))

PVE=l—

PTVE (3)
where Y is a prediction for a high-dimensional phenotype Y from the
model and Tr denotes the trace, i.e. the sum of the diagonal elements of
the matrix. In (3) and in general, the total variation of a multivariate
random variable is deﬁned as the trace of the covariance matrix, i.e.the
sum of the variances of the individual variables. Therefore, PTVE meas-
ures the joint impact of the SNPs on several phenotypes and hence
is expected to yield high scores to such dependencies in which many
phenotypes are affected by the SNPs, even if none of the effects is large
by itself.

In the Bayesian statistical framework, the inferences are based on pos-
terior probability distributions of the quantities of interest (Gelman et al.,
2004). With the Bayesian reduced rank regression model, samples from
the posterior distribution of the PTVE can be obtained from

Tr (Cov (X1110) PU)»
Tr(Cov( Y))

where 111“) and F“) are samples from the posterior distribution of the
parameters 111 and I“. It is similarly straightforward to estimate the pos-
terior distribution for the proportion of variation explained by the rare

PTVE“) = (4)

variants, by dividing the variation of the prediction into two components,
one corresponding to the rare variants, the other to the common variants.
The score obtained in this way is referred to as PTVE-rare in the sequel
and its exact deﬁnition is given in Supplementary Section 3. In practice,
we approximate the posterior distribution by using a mode-based point
estimate for one of the parameters, 1‘, and estimating the joint distribu-
tion of the other parameters using an Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithm, as described thoroughly in Supplementary
Sections 4 and 5.

2.3 Informative prior

In the Bayesian analysis, external background knowledge may be incor-
porated in the statistical analysis through prior probability distributions.
As our analysis is focused on estimating the posterior distribution of
PTVE, a sensible prior is obtained by making the prior distribution of
the PTVE represent our true beliefs about this quantity. The prior distri-
bution of the PTVE appears not to be available in a closed form; how-
ever, in Supplementary Section 6, we derive results that show how the
distribution of the mean of the PTVE, upTVE, depends on model hyper-
parameters. Using these results, we set the prior distributions to satisfy
the following properties:

Median(p.pTVE) = 10-6 (5)
and

Equation (5) means that the prior median of uPTVE is close to zero, as
we expect most of the genes to be unrelated to the phenotypes. Equation
(6) says that with a small probability, here equal to 0.01, the gene may
explain >0.1% of the total variation, a value deemed resonable based on
the background knowledge. The resulting prior distribution for the PTVE
is obtained by integrating over the distribtion of upTVE, and we used
Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the distribution. Figure 2 shows

Fig. 2. Prior and posterior distributions for the proportion of total vari-
ation explained (PTVE) by the model. The panel on the left shows the
prior distribution imposed on the proportion of total variation of the
phenotypes explained by the SNPs under consideration (here, the SNPs
from the LIPC gene). The median of the prior distribution is located at
~4e-6. The characteristic features of the prior distribution include the
peak at values close to zero, effectively removing noise unless there is
strong evidence about a possible association, and the long tail allowing a
small percentage of genes to explain larger proportions of the phenotype
variation. The rightmost bin on the x-axis contains the total probability
of values exceeding the maximum value on the axis. The panel on the
right shows the posterior distribution of the PTVE for the same SNPs.
Two posterior densities are shown, one showing the distribution for the
original data, the other showing the distribution for data in which the
rows of the phenotype matrix have been permuted. Notice the differing
scales on the x-axes of the two panels

PTVE values sampled from the prior distribution. The following desirable
characteristics can be seen: ﬁrst, a peak close to zero, shrinking the coef-
ﬁcients when no effect is present; second, a long tail, corresponding to the
genes with a non-negligible impact on the phenotypes, without imposing
strong beliefs about the actual size of these non-zero effects.

Another important property that follows from using the informative
prior is that the number of SNPs under consideration can be accounted
for. Detailed examination of Corollary 1 in Supplementary Section 6
reveals that with ﬁxed hyperparameters, the expected PTVE is propor-
tional to 1 Var(x,-), i.e. the total variation of the SNPs. Roughly, this
means that if the number of SNPs doubles, the expected PTVE doubles as
well, if the hyperparameters are kept ﬁxed. Using the Corollaries 1 and 2
in Supplementary Section 6, it is straightforward to modify the hyper-
parameter distributions to assert the prior conditions (5) and (6), implying
in our setting that all genes are expected to explain the same amount of
the variation of the phenotypes, regardless of how many SNPs they
contain.

2.4 Data

As a dataset for detecting associations, we consider a sample of 4702
individuals from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966
(NFBC1966), a birth cohort study of children born in 1966 in the two
northernmost provinces of Finland (Rantakallio, 1969). The blood sam-
ples for the DNA extraction and phenotype data were collected at a
follow-up Visit when the participants were 31 years of age. For replica-
tion, we consider two cohorts. The YFS is a population-based prospective
cohort study (Raitakari et al., 2008) conducted in Finland, the purpose of
which was to investigate the levels of cardiovascular risk factors in chil-
dren and adolescents in different parts of the country. The FINRISK
study comprises cross-sectional population surveys that have been carried
out every 5 years since 1972, to assess the risk factors of chronic diseases,
with emphasis on cardiovascular risk factors (V artiainen et al., 2010). The
individuals analyzed in this study belong to the sample from the year
1997. The blood samples for the two replication cohorts were collected
when the participants were 30—45 and 25—71 years of age, respectively.
The study protocols of all datasets have been approved by the local ethics
committees.

The samples were genotyped with Illumina arrays (Illumina, Inc. San
Diego, CA, USA) and imputed with IMPUTE 2 (Howie et al., 2009,
2011) using a 1000 Genomes Project reference panel (The 1000
Genomes Project Consortium, 2012). Of the resulting good-quality auto-
somal SNPs (info >0.4), we extracted SNPs in 24025 human genes by
adding 50 kb ﬂanking regions on both sides of the endpoints of the genes
given in NCBI gene database (genome assembly GRCh37.p10, NCBI
annotation 104, November 2012). As a preprocessing step, we reduced
the genotype space within each gene to the most promising 200 SNPs (at
most) that had the highest canonical correlation test score (Ferreira and
Purcell, 2009) with the metabolites; however, to prevent overﬁtting, the
priors were speciﬁed as described above using the unpruned SNP set. In
preliminary experiments, decreasing the number of SNPs in this way from
800 to 200 had no Visible effect on the results. Finally, the SNPs were
scaled to have unit variance.

Phenotype data came from the serum NMR metabolomics platform
described earlier (Soininen et al., 2009). As a preprocessing step, the traits
were quantile-normalized to have standard normal distribution.
Individuals with 20% missing values were removed and the remaining
missing values were imputed by sampling them from the multivariate
normal distribution. In this work, we analyzed a subset of 74 lipoprotein
subclass measures (Supplementary Table S3). The empirical correlation
matrix of the traits is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Linear regres-
sion was used to correct the phenotypes for age, sex and population
structure using 10 principal components (Price et al., 2006).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Genome-wide analysis of NFBC1966 data

We computed the PTVE and PTVE-rare scores for each of the
24025 human genes in the NFBC1966 data, one gene at a time,
using the Bayesian reduced rank regression. Table 1(a) shows the
top ﬁve genes with the highest PTVE scores, all of which are
well-known lipid-associated loci. More generally, all 43 top-scor-
ing genes were located within 1Mb from previously reported
genome-wide signiﬁcant lipid associations (Kettunen et al.,
2012; Teslovich et al., 2010; The Global Lipids Genetics
Consortium, 2013), and detailed listing of the top genes is
given in Supplementary Table S4. Furthermore, of the top 100
genes, which correspond to ~02 false discovery rate (FDR) (see
the next section), 73 genes had known associations. Together,
these ﬁndings serve as a validation of the method and its
implementation.

To illustrate the effect of the model rank on the results, we
carried out a detailed analysis for three known lipid genes: LIPC,
APOB and PLT P, with rank K1 = 1,2, 3. The genes were se-
lected such that they were located in different chromosomes
and had dissimilar association proﬁles [APOB associated most
strongly to VLDL, IDL and LDL, PLT P to HDL and LIPC to
VLDL, IDL and HDL (Tukiainen et al., 2012)]. In addition to
considering the genes separately, we repeated a joint analysis for
all three possible pairwise gene combinations. The results are
shown in Supplementary Figure S2 and are summarized as fol-
lows: (i) the rank of the model had a minor effect on the results
for a single gene, (ii) increasing the rank from K1 = l to K1 = 2
increased the variance explained in all joint pairwise analyses,
and the increase was signiﬁcant in two of the three cases, (iii) a
combination of two genes always had a larger effect than either
gene individually; however, the sum of the individual effects was

Table 1. Summary of results from the genome-wide analysis of the real data

slightly larger than the effect of the combination. We attribute
this difference mainly to the stronger shrinkage in the second
than the ﬁrst genotype component. (iv) The ﬁrst component of
a joint model was always strongly correlated with the single-gene
model with the larger effect, the second component with the
single-gene model with the smaller effect. This is as expected,
as the prior distribution was designed to identify the strongest
associations using the ﬁrst genotype component.

To check whether novel associations could be detected by any
method, we carried out a replication experiment with the YFS
and FINRISK datasets for the most promising genes, after
excluding genes located within 1Mb from previously reported
associations. We considered from each method all genes with
FDR <0.4 as promising. For the PTVE-rare score, six genes
were tested, none of which had previously reported associations
to lipids. For the PTVE score, 305 genes had FDR <0.4; how-
ever, only 167 were not located close to known associations, and
these 167 genes were selected for replication.

For the purposes of replication, the multivariate dependency
between the multiple SNPs and phenotypes was reduced into a
univariate test by using parameters estimated in the NFBC1966
data to construct univariate genotype and phenotype combin-
ations (see Supplementary Section 7 for further details). Then,
the standard linear model was used to test for positive correlation
between the genotype and phenotype combinations. A pooled
linear regression coefﬁcient combining YFS and FINRISK
datasets was formed using a ﬁxed effect model over the two
datasets (Thompson et al., 2011), and the P-Value was obtained
by relating the pooled estimate to its SD. A one-tailed test was
used,as we were only interested in ﬁndings in which the effects
were in the same direction in the replication datasets as in the
NFBC1966 data. Bonferroni correction was used to account for
the number of genes tested with each method, such that corrected

Gene-metabolome associations

 

P-Value threshold corresponding to the nominal 0.05 level of
signiﬁcance was equal to P<0.0083 for the six putative novel
genes from PTVE-rare score and P < 0.00030 for the 167 putative
genes from PTVE score.

We considered a replication signiﬁcant if the test was nomin-
ally signiﬁcant (P<0.05) in both replication datasets, and the
P-Value for the pooled estimate was signiﬁcant after correcting
for the multiple tests. Information about genes that replicated
signiﬁcantly is provided in Table 1(b) and (c) and in Figure 3.
One gene with PTVE-rare and six genes with PTVE were de-
tected, corresponding to two independent genes: XRCC4 and
M T HFD2L. M T HFD2L is located within 1Mb from two
SNPs (rs2168889 and rsl6850360) associated with ‘metabolic
networks’ containing some lipoprotein traits from our data
(Inouye et al., 2012). However, the top metabolite in the associ-
ations was Albumin, and when we repeated the multivariate test
with the lipoprotein traits considered here, these associations
were no longer genome-wide signiﬁcant (P=2.5e-4 and
P=6.4e-7). In addition, two genes, SPIRE2 and DT NB, repli-
cated signiﬁcantly (after the multiple testing correction) in one,
but not in the other replication dataset. Table 1 also presents the
rankings of these genes by alternative methods (see below). We
see that X RCC4, SPIRE2 and DT NB were completely missed by
the other methods. Supplementary Table S1 shows the SNPs
contributing to the reported associations. We see that with
XRCC4, SPIRE2 and DT NB, many SNPs, some of which are

 

rare, are required to represent the overall association. This ex-
plains why these genes did not receive any signal from the stand-
ard testing with the pairwise linear model. Supplementary Figure
S3 shows graphically how the phenotypes are affected by the
signiﬁcant genes and the known LIPC gene. We see that in nei-
ther of the new genes is the effect focused on any single trait, but
rather a small effect is seen on many lipoprotein measures. This is
not surprising, as the PTVE score is expected to give high scores
to precisely this kind of association. Supplementary Figure S4
shows the estimated SNP coefﬁcients for the genes and demon-
strates the usefulness of analyzing all SNPs in a gene simultan-
eously to reduce noise resulting from the correlation between the
SNPs. Further background information on these genes is pre-
sented in Supplementary Table S2; however, a more thorough
biological interpretation of the genes remains for future work.
Finally, we repeated a similar analysis with three alternative
methods: (i) exhaustive pairwise search with a linear model,
where the minus logarithm of the smallest pairwise P-Value
over all SNPs in the gene and metabolites was taken as the test
score for the gene, (ii) CCA, applied to a single SNP versus all
metabolites at a time as by Ferreira and Purcell (2009) and
Inouye et al. (2012) and (iii) sparse CCA, which was used to
compute the canonical correlation between all SNPs in a gene
and all phenotypes (Parkhomenko et al., 2009). The methods (ii)
and (iii) were found to be the most powerful in a recent com-
parison of approaches for a multivariate metabolomics

phenotype (Marttinen et al., 2013); however, here the SNPs were
not pruned using the minor allele frequency before applying the
methods as by Marttinen et al. (2013) because here the focus is in
the rare variant setting. Similarly to PTVE and PTVE-rare meth-
ods, we tried to replicate the top-scoring genes up to FDR = 0.4.
The last column in Table 2 shows the numbers of genes included
in the replication with detailed listings given in Supplementary
Tables S4—S8. The association in M T HFD2L was confirmed to
be genome-wide significant using the standard pairwise linear
regression (SNP rs185567543, trait S.LDL.P, P: 2.5e-15,
where the P—value is pooled over all three datasets). All other
replicated associations were located within 1Mb of this or pre-
viously known associations, thus yielding no additional novel
detections.

3.2 Power comparison

To investigate the power of the introduced method and compare
it with alternative methods, we estimated FDR corresponding to
different thresholds d for declaring a gene as detected. FDR es-
timates were obtained by permuting the rows of the phenotype
matrix and analyzing the permuted data in exactly the same way
as the original data (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Storey and
Tibshirani, 2003; Xie et al., 2005). In detail, we computed the
average number of genes in the permuted datasets with scores
exceeding a given threshold d (false-positive rates, FP(d)), the
number of genes in the original data with scores exceeding
the same threshold d (total positive rates, TP(d)) and considered
the ratio of the two

FP(d)
T P(d)

Because of computational burden, only one permutation was
used with the Bayesian reduced rank regression. With the other
methods, three permutations were used. Therefore, the FDR es-
timates are approximate, which we consider to be sufficient for
our purposes, especially because the most extreme quantiles are
not considered.

The numbers of genes declared detected with different FDR
thresholds are presented in Table 2, and the overall concordance
of the scores from different methods is shown in Supplementary
Figure S5. In summary, the results show that the method with
which most associations were found was exhaustive pairwise

FDR(d) =

search and the second-most powerful method was the Bayesian
reduced rank regression with PTVE as the test score. These two
methods also had the highest agreement in scoring genes. CCA
applied to test for association between individual SNPs and the
multivariate phenotype performed badly. These results are some-
what different from what has been reported before by us and
others (Inouye et al., 2012; Marttinen et al., 2013). In particular,
the CCA applied to individual SNPs performed much worse that
the pairwise testing, although previously it has been reported to
have clearly higher power. The explanation is that here we
applied the methods to all SNPs, including the rare variants.
Specifically, the single-SNP-CCA starts to overfit when applied
to rare variants. For example, when we investigated the results
more carefully, we discovered SNPs in which the minor allele was
present in few individuals, and such individuals could be almost
perfectly identified by a seemingly random combination of
phenotypes, leading to a large spurious canonical correlation
test score (or, equivalently, a highly signiﬁcant P—value).
Bayesian reduced rank regression and sparse CCA were less af-
fected by the overfitting because they exploit ways to control the
complexity of the model, the former using the informative priors,
the latter using the cross-validation.

Combining information over several SNPs using CCA or
related methods has recently been demonstrated to improve
power to detect associations under certain conditions
(Marttinen et al., 2013; Tang and Ferreira, 2012; Zhang et al.,
2011). Here we see that the sparse CCA and also the Bayesian
reduced rank regression, which use multi-SNP information, have
lower power in the genome-wide analysis than the simple pair-
wise testing. The difference from the earlier experiments is that
here the methods are applied to genotype data with a much
higher SNP density, as obtained through careful imputation.
The conclusion is that if the multi-SNP information has already
been used within the imputation protocol, the power to detect
associations cannot, in general, be expected to improve by using
multi-SNP models.

For a more detailed comparison between the Bayesian reduced
rank regression and the exhaustive pairwise testing,
Supplementary Figure S6 shows a Q-Q plot of the scores (both
PTVE and PTVE-rare) against the expected scores that have
been obtained by permutation. The Supplementary Figure S6
also shows genes detectable by the simple exhaustive pairwise
search. Both Q-Q plots, but PTVE in particular, indicate an
excess of large test scores, reﬂecting the fact that at least some
true associations are detected by the model. We further see that
although with PTVE-rare score fewer genes can be detected than
with PTVE, none of the top-scoring genes from PTVE-rare are
ﬂagged by the pairwise approach, making PTVE-rare an attract-
ive score for mining associations that might be missed by the
standard method.

4 DISCUSSION

We have presented a new statistical method for investigating
associations in Genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets
with multivariate phenotypes. The method can combine infor-
mation over multiple SNPs, making it particularly suitable for
studying rare variants in the high-dimensional phenotype setting.
For this setup, no methods known to the authors have been

Gene-metabolome associations

 

presented before. Our method is based on estimating the propor-
tion of total variance of the phenotypes that is explained by the
SNPs under consideration. For this purpose, we have derived a
Bayesian formulation of the reduced rank regression model,
which enables us to incorporate our knowledge of the expected
effects sizes in the analysis.

We used the new method to analyze a real GWAS dataset with
a multivariate lipoprotein phenotype. Two novel loci not previ-
ously associated with the phenotype were discovered and repli-
cated in an analysis combining two additional datasets.
Furthermore, two more loci were found that replicated signiﬁ-
cantly in one but not in the other test dataset. Possible reasons
for the lack of success in replicating the ﬁndings in both the
datasets include the following: (i) the associations were false posi-
tive in the ﬁrst place, (ii) the associations involved rare variants
that were not present in sufﬁcient numbers to see the effects, (iii)
the imputation accuracy of the rare variants was not sufﬁcient in
all datasets, (iv) the phenotype data, although preprocessed in
exactly the same way with all the datasets, have not been fully
equivalent. For example, the scaling of the phenotypes during
preprocessing has been done using factors not exactly equal, and
the parameters learned in one data may thus not represent the
effects adequately in another data. Only further studies will help
to distinguish between the alternative explanations.

For doing inference with the model, the current implementa-
tion uses MCMC sampling, the computation time of which is
approximately half an hour per gene on a 2.3 GHz processor.
Thus, analyzing all human genes requires a cluster computer to
parallelize the computations over the genes. Analytical approxi-
mations, such as the variational or Laplace approximations,
e.g. Bishop (2006), could be used to speed up the computations
and, based on our experiments with the current method, are
worth doing in the future. Alternative ways to use the model
might also be considered. For example, focusing the analysis
on variants with a predicted function could improve power to
detect associations and lessen the computational burden. As an-
other example, we have used 0.01 as the threshold for deﬁning
the rare variants when computing their impact on the pheno-
types. Results based on different thresholds could readily be ex-
tracted from the output of a single MCMC run and are likely to
highlight different sets of genes.

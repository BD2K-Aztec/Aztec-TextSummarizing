Abstract

Summary: Pleiotropy is common in the genetic architectures of complex diseases. To the best of our
knowledge, no analysis tool has been developed for identifying pleiotropic pathways using multiple
genome-wide association study (GWAS) summaries by now. Here, we present PAPA, a flexible tool
for pleiotropic pathway analysis utilizing GWAS summary results. The performance of PAPA was
validated using publicly available GWAS summaries of body mass index and waist-hip ratio of the
GIANT datasets. PAPA identified a set of pleiotropic pathways, which have been demonstrated to be

involved in the development of obesity.

1 Introduction

Pleiotropy describes the genetic phenomenon of a single gene affecting
multiple phenotypes. It can be explained by single gene product having
various biological functions, or acting as a signal factor implicated in
the development of different phenotypes. Pleiotropy is common in the
genetic architectures of complex diseases (Sivakumaran et al., 2011). A
total of 16.9% of genes recorded in the NHGRI Catalog of published
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have pleiotropic effects
(Sivakumaran et al., 2011). Clarifying the molecular mechanism of
pleiotropy is helpful for pathogenetic studies and drug development of
human complex diseases.

Recent achievements in GWAS provide a good opportunity for
systematical pleiotropy studies of complex diseases. A simple ap-
proach is to analyse disease phenotypes separately using univariate
approaches. The study results of different disease phenotypes are
compared, which may result in low statistical power. To address
this issue, multiple pleiotropy analysis approaches and tools have
been proposed (Lee et al., 2012; Nyholt, 2014). A group of genes

with pleiotropic effects were identified for complex diseases (Elliott
et al., 2013; International Schizophrenia et al., 2009). However, cur-
rent pleiotropic mechanism studies of complex diseases mostly focus
on individual pleiotropic genes, which are sometimes functionally
independent. Some individual pleiotropic genes participate in mul-
tiple cellular processes. The biological functions of a part of genes
remain elusive now. Therefore, identifying individual pleiotropic
genes often provides limited information for genetic studies of com-
plex diseases.

Inspired by the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of microarray
data (Subramanian et al., 2005), pathway-based GWAS were proposed
(Wang et al., 2007) and successfully applied in the genetic studies
of complex diseases (Zhang et al., 2010). However, to the best of
our knowledge, no analysis tool has been developed for identifying
pleiotropic pathways using GWAS summary results by now.

In this study, we extended the pathway analysis algorithm proposed
by Wang et al. (2007), and developed a pleiotropic pathway analysis
tool PAPA. We applied PAPA to public available GWAS summaries of

body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) of the Genetic
Investigation of ANthropometric Traits datasets (Speliotes et al., 2010;
Heid et al., 2010).

2 Methods

2.1. Implementation

Step 1 — Assigning association testing statistics to genes

We suppose that GWAS summaries of M genes and N phenotypes
were available. Let Si,- denote the association testing statistic (for in-
stance, chi-square values for qualitative traits) of jth SNP for 2th
phenotype (i: 1,2,...,N). SNPs are assigned to genes by distance.
A physical distance of 500 kb is used to connect a SNP to a gene in
this study. For ith phenotype and mth gene (m = 1,2, . . . ,M), we select
the largest S,,- from the SNPs assigned to the gene as the score of the
gene, denoted as Sim. All genes are ranked by sorting their scores Sim
from largest to smallest ( 521%}... QM), which is denoted as
Si 2 [531,532, ----SfMl-

Step 2 — Calculating enrichment scores

For a given pathway P consisting of Mp genes, let G1, denote the vth
gene (12 = 1,2, . . . ,Mp) of pathway P. Let ES? denote the enrichment
score (ES) of pathway P for 2th phenotype. ES? is calculated by
Kolmogorov—Smirnov-like running sum statistic (Wang et al.,
2007b

Step 3 — Permutation and centralization

To obtain the null distribution of ES? , permutations were conducted
through circular genome permutation (Cabrera et al., 2012). For lath
permutation, let ESE?” denote the ES value of pathway P for 2th
phenotype, calculating from permutated data. After K times permu-
tations, we can obtain the null distribution of BS), denoted as
ES? ""11 = [ESE”“”,ESZ”“”, ...,ESSQWI] . For pathway P, we calculate
the centered ES (CES) of observed data (denote as CESP) and permu-
tated data (denote as CESP ""11 = [CESf”“”,CES12)”“”,..., CESE’WID of

N phenotypes, defined by

Where la (la 2 1,2, . . . ,K) denotes lath permutation. w,- is the weight
parameter of 2th phenotype. For instance, w,- can be assigned as the
proportion of GWAS samples of ill) phenotype in total samples.

Step 4 — Calculating normalized CES
The normalized CES (NCES) of pathway P is defined by

CESP — mean(CESP"“”)

NCESP = P U
SD(CES n“ )

 

The null distribution of N CESP , which is denoted as N CESP ""11
= [NCESf”“ll,NCES§”“ll,...,NCESEWU], can be calculated from K
permutations using the following formula,

CES)?“ll — mean(CESP"“”)
SD(CESPnull)

 

NCES)?“ll =

where la (la 2 1,2, . . . ,K) denotes lath permutation. After normaliza-
tion, the NCES values of pathways with different sizes can be dir-
ectly compared with each other (Wang et al., 2007).

Step 5 — Calculating P values

Statistical testing P value of each pathway is calculated as the pro-
portion of N CESP being smaller than N CESP ""11 in K times
permutations.

2.2. Application to GWAS summaries of BMI and WHR
GWAS summaries of BMI were obtained from Speliotes et al.
(2010), containing 123 865 study subjects of European ancestry.
GWAS summaries of WHR were collected from Heid et al. (2010),
including 77 167 study subjects of European ancestry. 3269 path-
ways or gene ontology categories collecting from the Molecular
Signatures Database of GSEA were analyzed (Subramanian et al.,
2005). The weighting parameters of BMI and WHR were 0.62 and
0.38, respectively. 1000 permutations were conducted by PAPA to
calculate the empirical P value of each pathway.

3 Results and discussion

As shown by Supplementary Table S1, the top three significant path-
ways functionally involved in adipocyte differentiation, Wnt signal-
ling and synthesis of bile acids and bile salts, which have been
demonstrated to be involved in the development of obesity (Mori
et al., 2012; Prinz et al., 2015). The computational cost of PAPA
program is affordable. The GWAS datasets of BMI and WHR were
analyzed (1000 permutations) on a Dell computer with Intel Xeon
CPU E5620 (2.4 GHz) and 4 GB memory. PAPA spent 98 h to com-
plete data analysis.

In this study, we extended the GSEA algorithm (Subramanian
et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007), and developed a pleiotropic pathway
analysis tool PAPA. Because of integrating GWAS results and prior
knowledge of biological pathways, PAPA may provide novel clues for
clarifying the pleiotropic mechanisms of human complex diseases. It
should be noted that the definition of biological pathways may affect
the performance of PAPA. In PAPA package, we provided two path-
way gene annotation files, which were collected from public pathway
database, including KEGG Pathway Database, Reactome Pathway
Database, BioCarta, Ambion GeneAssist Pathway Atlas, Gene
Ontology and GSEA Molecular Signatures Database.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Electrostatic calculations are an important tool for
deciphering many functional mechanisms in proteins. Generalized
Born (GB) models offer a fast and convenient computational
approximation over other implicit solvent-based electrostatic
models. Here we present a novel GB-based web server, using
the program Bluues, to calculate numerous electrostatic features
including pKa-values and surface potentials. The output is organized
allowing both experts and beginners to rapidly sift the data. A
novel feature of the Bluues server is that it explicitly allows to find
electrostatic differences between wild-type and mutant structures.
Availability: The Bluues server, examples and extensive help files
are available for non-commercial use at URL: http://protein.bio.

1 INTRODUCTION

The structure, function (Fersht et al., 1985), stability (Strickler
et al., 2006), protein—protein interaction (Sheinerman et al., 2000)
and small molecule binding (Szabo et al., 1972) of a protein is
largely dependent on its electrostatics. Electrostatics calculations are
computationally impractical when modeling the solvent explicitly,
e.g. by analyzing trajectories of a large number of solvent molecules
in molecular dynamics simulations. Continuum solvent implicit
models based on the Poisson—Boltzmann (PB) equation have been
widely used (Davis and Mccammon, 1990; Fogolari et al., 2002;
Honig and Nicholls, 1995) and calculations are computationally
achievable but are often very slow, especially for large molecules.
When self— and interaction energies and forces are desired, the
most widely used approach is based on the Generalized Born (GB)
model (Bashford and Case, 2000; Koehl, 2006). GB approaches
are a further approximation to PB methods but are considerably
faster with calculations available in reasonable time, even for large
molecules. Often the GB approach is benchmarked compared with
PB methods due to the improved accuracy of the latter.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Here, we present the Bluues server, a server that uses the
program Bluues to perform electrostatic calculations for single—
atomic structures with options for point mutations. The tool was
conceived to yield accurate yet efﬁcient models. Bluues, which is
based on the GB model, was recently proven sufﬁciently accurate
with respect to PB—based solvers (Fogolari et al., 2012)). Bluues
currently models: (i) GB radius of each atom; (ii) electrostatic
solvation free energy; (iii) pH—dependent properties; (iv) pKa of
all titratable groups; and (v) electrostatic potential at the surface of
the molecule all in the order of minutes. Upon point mutation, delta
values are calculated for the points listed above between the wild—
type and mutant structures. It is implemented as a user—friendly web
server with output such as downloadable ﬁles, molecular graphics
and tables sorted by interesting characteristics.

2 SERVER OVERVIEW

Bluues requires as input a valid PDB identiﬁer or a user—speciﬁed
PDB ﬁle, from which it calculates a valid PQR protonation state
ﬁle. Self made PQR ﬁles are also supported. The server contains two
interfaces. One for analyzing a single—protein structure and the other
for mutational analyses of the electrostatic features of two structures.
The mutant protein can be derived from the server by point mutation
of surface residues. For completeness the user can also supply their
own wild type and mutant. All details about the methodologies used
by the program Bluues are described in the reference paper (Fogolari
et al., 2012). By default the server executes the GB radii and surface
potential calculations. The user has the option of altering the default
parameters and executing surface area and pKa shifts calculations.
These latter options will increase the computational return time.

The output consists of PDB, graph and text ﬁles which are
described in more detail online. In summary, the radii and
electrostatic potential for each atom are supplied by default. The
pKa option gives data for titration curves on ionizable residues, pH—
dependence on total charge and contribution to the free energy of
folding data. The surface area option provides the solvent accessible
surface area for the system in all chains, residues and atoms. The
surface potential is displayed using the JMOL molecular Viewer
(Figure 1).

The Bluues server simply models point mutations using SCRWL
(Krivov et al., 2009) which uses a backbone—dependent rotamer
library followed by a branch—and—bound search to remove steric
clashes. This simple side chain replacement has been proven

Fig. 1. Cold shock protein (BC—CspB, PDB code 2ES2) mutation E3R is
known to increase stability in mesophiles (Arginine in tennophiles; Perl and
Schmid, 2001). The Bluues server produces graphical and downloadable
ﬁles, described online. The image above only shows the graphical aspects
of Bluues. Both wild—type and mutated protein are shown in JMOL with
the residue under mutation highlighted in black and actions implemented as
buttons. Tables producing sorted ApKa and Apotential are provided with
corresponding distance to mutation (e.g. the E66 carboxylic group has the
greatest positive pKa shift of 0.49). The corresponding titration curve can be
examined for each pKa shift. Charge and pH—dependent folding free energy
as a function of pH are also provided

successful for mutation (Wang et al., 2008). Only residues in the
PDB ﬁle which have a relative solvent accessibility, calculated
by DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983), above 40% are allowed to
be mutated. This restriction was chosen because mutating buried
residues may lead to unfolding (Wang et al., 2008).

The server can analyze the effect of a particular mutation of
interest with a very good accuracy, compared with more approximate
methods (Fogolari et al., 2012). After mutation both wild—type and
mutant structures are converted to PQR format using the program
PDB2PQR using CHARMM forceﬁeld (Dolinsky et al., 2007) and
then processed with the Bluues algorithm. The output ﬁles are similar
to those mentioned previously, except they are provided for both wild
type and mutant. In addition, user—deﬁned wild type and mutant can
be uploaded to the server (PDB or PQR). This type of input could
be useful, for example, in a setting where the user would prefer
to perform a more comprehensive self—made mutant and wild—type
model [e.g. homology modeling (Leonardi et al., 2011)].

An important characteristic of the mutation output interface are
the delta values provided between the wild type and mutant. These
simply subtract the wild—type electrostatic features from the mutant
ones. They are sorted in order of largest positive difference and
may provide clues as to the most relevant electrostatic changes
due to the mutation relative to the wild type. Examples of delta
values include ApKa—values for ionizable groups and Asurface
potential. Moreover, atom distance from the mutation C—,B atom
is incorporated since long—range effects from the mutation may
indicate important residues (Rajagopalan et al., 2002), especially
if they can be found to be conserved. In other words effects nearby
the mutation site are expected while distant shifts may indicate an
‘Electrostatic domino’ effect highlighting distantly coupled residues.

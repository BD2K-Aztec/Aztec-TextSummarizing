ABSTRACT

Motivation: Systems Genetics approaches, in particular those relying
on genetical genomics data, put forward a new paradigm of
large-scale genome and network analysis. These methods use natur-
ally occurring multi-factorial perturbations (e.g. polymorphisms) in
properly controlled and screened genetic crosses to elucidate
causal relationships in biological networks. However, although genet-
ical genomics data contain rich information, a clear dissection of
causes and effects as required for reconstructing gene regulatory
networks is not easily possible.

Results: We present a framework for reconstructing gene regulatory
networks from genetical genomics data where genotype and pheno-
type correlation measures are used to derive an initial graph which is
subsequently reduced by pruning strategies to minimize false positive
predictions. Applied to realistic simulated genetic data from a recent
DREAM challenge, we demonstrate that our approach is simple yet
effective and outperforms more complex methods (including the best
performer) with respect to (i) reconstruction quality (especially for small
sample sizes) and (ii) applicability to large data sets due to relatively
low computational costs. We also present reconstruction results from
real genetical genomics data of yeast.

Availability: A MATLAB implementation (script) of the reconstruction
framework is available at www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/

1 INTRODUCTION

Systems genetics seeks to reveal complex genetic interactions in
biological systems by relating genetic variations to various
phenotypic data from high-throughput measurements (Jansen
and Nap, 2001; Jansen, 2003; Rockman and Kruglyak, 2006).
In contrast to the classical “one gene perturbation at a time’
approach, systems genetics interprets naturally occurring mul-
tiple genetic variations [e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNP)] as multi-factorial perturbations from which causalities
can be unraveled more efficiently (Jansen and Nap, 2001;
Jansen, 2003). Systems genetics methods use properly controlled
genetic crosses (segregating populations) such as recombinant
congenic strains (RCS), recombinant inbred lines (RIL),
advanced intercross lines (AIL) or chromosome substitution

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

strains (CSS) to causally link genetic or chromosomal regions
to observed phenotypic trait data (Jansen, 2003; Rockmann,
2008). Identifying a chromosomal region [the Quantitative
Trait Locus (QTL)] that influences a certain phenotypic trait is
known as QTL mapping.

In genetical genomics, a particular subclass of systems gen-
etics, gene-expression levels are considered as phenotypic traits
(called etraits), and identified QTLs (comprising single genes or
gene regions) are referred to as expression-QTLs (eQTLs). One
application of eQTL maps obtained from genetical genomics
approaches is the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks
(GRN). In the latter, nodes represent genes and edges represent
interactions or dependencies between genes. GRN provide the
basis for systems-level understanding of interacting genes and
phenotype formation in living systems. They condense different
types of molecular interactions on the signaling, metabolic and
genetic level to a network representation of causalities.
Therefore, GRN represent a causal projection of gene activities,
neglecting detailed molecular mechanisms (Brazhnik et al., 2002;
de la Fuente, 2010). Reconstructed gene regulatory networks can
be used to narrow down genetic analysis by massively reducing
the number of potential molecular interactions or locations of
interaction sites. In the same way, GRN can be used to identify
putative intervention points by relating genetic spots to patho-
logic phenotypes (Schadt et al., 2005).

According to Liu et al. (2010), the general GRN reconstruc-
tion pipeline for genetical genomics data consists of three major
steps: (i) eQTL mapping, (ii) candidate regulator selection and
(iii) network refinement. For step (i), there eXist several eQTL
mapping strategies: single-etrait-single-eQTL, multiple-etrait-
single-eQTL, multiple-etrait-multiple—eQTL. A detailed review
on the pipeline of eQTL mapping is, for instance, given by
Michaelson et al. (2009). In step (ii), the eQTL map in combin-
ation with a genetic map is used to select single candidate (regu-
lator) genes from the eQTLs as the latter often represent
chromosomal regions due to genetic linkage. Methods used in-
clude conditional correlation (Bing and Hoeschele, 2005;
Keurentjes et al., 2007), local regression (Liu et al., 2008) or
analysis of between-strains SNPs (Li et al., 2005). In the third
step (iii), network refinement methods are used to the topology
obtained in step (ii), e.g., with the goal to identify and eliminate
(false positive) edges arising from indirect effects. Here, Bayesian
network approaches (Zhu et al., 2007) and structural equation
modeling, SEM, (Liu et al., 2008) have been used. One disad-
vantage of the former is, that Bayesian networks cannot handle
cycles if no time dimension is included (Friedman et al., 1998).

Network Reconstruction from Genetical Genomics Data

 

Further, inferred dependencies in Bayesian networks do not ne-
cessarily represent causalities, as there may exist several alterna-
tive dependencies having the same joint probability (Pearl, 2000).
As one approach for structural equation modeling, Liu et a].
(2008) construct ﬁrst an encompassing directed network from
the eQTL analysis which is afterwards further reﬁned by SEM.
Similar as Baysian network inference, SEM is computationally
expensive, which restricts the applicability to medium-sized
networks.

In this work, we propose a novel strategy for reconstructing
GRN from genetical genomics data. The workﬁow (Fig. 1; ex-
plained in detail in Section 2) encompasses implicitly the three
major steps mentioned above but uses different techniques than
used so far. The chosen methods were intentionally kept simple;
realistic datasets show that they are nevertheless effective
(Section 3). The initial GRN is constructed based on geno-
type—phenotype and phenotype—phenotype correlation analysis.
Owing to genetic linkage, there are often groups of genetically
adjacent regulator candidates that target the same gene resulting
into eQTLs. To avoid a lot of false positive interactions, single
candidate regulators are therefore identiﬁed from the eQTLs.
Finally, as a method for network reﬁnement, indirect path effects
are removed by TRANSWESD, a recently introduced transitive
reduction approach (Klamt et al., 2010). Originally,
TRANSWESD has been developed to prune perturbation
graphs derived from single knock-out data. Here we show that
TRANSWESD can also be used to prune perturbation graphs
obtained from genetical genomics data, thus complementing
Bayesian networks and SEM.

Overall, our framework constitutes simple modules with a
total number of just two threshold parameters. We tested it on
in silico recombinant inbred line data that have been provided
by the DREAM initiative (DREAMS, Systems Genetics chal-
lenge 3A; http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/dream/index.php/
D503; Prill et al., 2010, 2011; Stolovitzky et al., 2009; Vignes
et al., 2011). We ﬁnd that the proposed modular reconstruc-
tion approach outperforms the best performer (Vignes et al.,
2011). We also present and discuss reconstruction results from
real genetical genomics data of yeast (Brem and Kruglyak,
2005).

2 METHODS

2.1 Workflow overview

Figure 1 shows the general workﬂow of our reconstruction framework
together with a simple illustrative example. Starting from a typical set of
genetical genomics data that include genotyped markers, phenotyped
genes and gene-to-marker association, marker linkage analysis and geno-
type assignment for each gene is performed in a preprocessing step. From
these data an unweighted and unsigned perturbation graph G1 is derived
using genotype—phenotype correlation in combination with an appro-
priated thresholding strategy. The nodes in the graph directly correspond
to genes while linkage information is kept to allow later eQTL assignment
for each gene. The perturbation graph G1 is reﬁned to G2 by quantifying
each identiﬁed edge with respect to edge sign and weight, which indicate
activation/repression and interaction strength, respectively. Owing to gen-
etic linkage, true regulators may be masked by other genes, e.g., on ad-
jacent positions on the genetic map, resulting into eQTLs. The eQTLs of
a given target gene t can be identiﬁed on the basis of all potential regu-
lator genes of t and the marker linkage map. These relationships are

captured in graph G3. Graph G4 is subsequently obtained by selecting
one candidate regulator per eQTL based on the maximum of the edge
weights. We call G4 the ﬁnal perturbation graph, whose edges reﬂect
direct and indirect effects between genes induced by genetic variations.
To remove indirect edges that can be explained by the operation of
sequences of edges (paths), we apply the transitive reduction method
TRANSWESD resulting in the ﬁnal graph G5. Optionally, if one is left
to verify the interactions experimentally, it is desirable to have a list of
edges sorted with respect to edge conﬁdences. Such a list is also used by
the DREAMS evaluation procedures to assess the quality of a recon-
structed network (Section 3.1). We generate such a sorted list based on
the edge weights.

2.2 Preprocessing genetical genomics data

A genetical genomics dataset typically consists of the following mea-
sured/determined information (see Fig. 1): From a segregating popu-
lation such as RILs, each segregant is genotyped for a set of
polymorphic genetic markers that cover the genome or at least part
of it. The genotype of each marker in each RIL is captured in a
matrix P [e.g. two-valued (0/1) in the case of haploidic genomes].
Additionally, genes are expression proﬁled in each RIL (stored in a
matrix T). In the typical case that several genes are associated to one
marker, genes can be associated to a speciﬁc marker based on their
position on the genome map (yielding the list A in Fig. 1). From this
information, we extract by simple preprocessing steps, two additional
matrices needed before the actual reconstruction process is started.
First, the gene-to-marker association A is used to assign, for each
RIL, an (approximated) genotype Q to each gene, which is taken
from its associated marker genotype P. This genotype assignment is
based on the assumption of genetic linkage between markers and
genes. Further, genetic linkage of the markers needs to be taken
into account to identify potential eQTLs in G3 at a later reconstruc-
tion step. If genetic linkage of the markers is unknown, a linkage
analysis can be performed based on genotype—genotype Pearson cor-
relation r1)in of the markers m,- and mj- (P,- and PJ- denoting their
genotype). With a given threshold dmme[0,1], if r1)in Z dmin then
mj e u, with it, being the set of markers linked to marker mi. By
this procedure we obtain a linkage map L. The parameter dmm repre-
sents the minimal genotypic correlation at which two markers are
considered to be linked. The threshold can be derived from (i) testing
for signiﬁcance of deviation from zero by a t-test (cf. Appendix of
Bing and Hoeschele, 2005), whereas empirical signiﬁcant levels can be
derived from permutation tests (Churchill and Doerge, 1994; Carlborg
et al., 2005), (ii) the typical separation of candidate regulators in the
eQTL map based on rQiTJ' (see Fig. 1 right, panel of G1). Speciﬁcally,
one may analyse the average number of eQTLs over the genome as a
function of dmm. Regions of dmm, where the average number of eQTLs
does not change much, indicate an optimal value. A similar threshold-
ing strategy could be applied if the genetic distances (given in
centiMorgan) between the markers are known a priori.

2.3 Generating the raw perturbation graph from genetical
genomics data

The next step is the generation of the perturbation graphs G1 and G2
from the (preprocessed) genetical genomics data. The idea for detecting a
potential regulator—target interaction is that a variation in a regulator
gene’s genotype causes a variation in the phenotype of the target gene.
We use T]- to indicate the expression phenotype (etrait) of a gene j and Q,-
for the genotype of a gene 1' (obtained from the marker genotype as
described above). Based on the genotype—phenotype Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient rQiTJ' (see Fig. 2), we assume an edge 1' —> j to exist, if it exceeds
a threshold value IQT:

erile : tQT. (1)

Fig. 2. Illustration for low (left) and high (right) correlation between the
genotype Q,- of a gene 1' (with two genotypes; Q,- e {0, 1}) and the expres-
sion phenotype  of a gene j. The example on the right-hand side indi-
cates that gene 1' may regulate (directly or indirectly) gene j

The derived candidate edges reﬂect regulation of gene j by gene 1' by
either cis, cis—trans or trans effects. In the case of i: j, it is most likely a
cis effect, otherwise one has to condition on i: if gene ihas a cis effect then
gene j is cis—trans regulated else it is trans regulated. All three effects will
result in increased correlations and Equation (1) can thus be used to
derive the candidate edges for the GRN. The threshold tQT 6 [0,1] can
be selected based on a combination of several criteria, including (i) similar
to the marker linkage analysis by P—values for rejecting irQl‘Tji >0 based
on a t-test, (ii) minimal/maximal edge numbers one expects to ﬁnd in the
GRN and (iii) existing data. In the case of small sample size, Spearman
correlation might be more appropriate. For diploidic genomes, where Q,-
is three-valued, one may apply the same procedure for each pairwise
combination of genotypes and merge the resulting networks to G1.

Importantly, the nodes in the obtained graph G1 directly correspond
to genes (as required to eventually reconstruct gene regulatory networks);
the eQTL (regions) will be assigned later in graph G3 based on the link-
age map L. Beforehand, we assign an edge sign and edge weight to each
detected candidate edge i—> j in G1 resulting in G2 (Fig. 1). The edge sign
5,,- is derived from sgn(rTin), i.e., the correlation coefﬁcient between ex-
pression levels of genes 1' and j. The strength wij of an edge is quantiﬁed by

W = (lrQile + erile)/2- (2)

The edge weight accounts for genotype—phenotype (Q T -) and pheno-
type—phenotype (T T -) correlations by averaging both. This is especially
important for (cis—)trans—regulated targets, as these are affected by both,
geno- and phenotype of the potential regulator. We have also tested
either QT - or T T -correlation alone, which both led to reconstructed
GRN of signiﬁcant lower quality (at least when applied to the
DREAMS/3 A data). We also found that substituting the QT correlation
coefﬁcient in Equation (1) by the average T T - and QT -correlations as
used in Equation (2) is not favourable, probably because then many high
T T -correlation wrongly indicate a directed relationship (e.g., due to
common upstream regulators).

2.4 Identiﬁcation of eQTLs and candidate
regulator selection

Owing to genetic linkage (correlated genotypes), a gene j that is found to
be targeted by a gene 1' (i.e., an edge from i to j exists in G2) is typically
also targeted by several other genes genetically adjacent to iresulting into
an eQTL. An eQTL with respect to a given target gene j is identiﬁed by
the set of all those genes that are potential regulators of j in G2 and that
are genetically linked via their markers (see Fig. 1, G3: target gene g3 has
one eQTL formed by {g2, g4, g5}). Importantly, two potential regulators
gX and gy can be in the same eQTL, even in the case where their associated
markers mX and my are not linked in the linkage map L. This happens if
there is another candidate regulator gZ whose marker mZ is linked to mX

and my in L. Note also that for each target gene, there may exist several
eQTLs: in Fig. 1, gene g6 has two eQTLs formed by genes {g4, g5} and
{g1, g3}. Once we have identiﬁed all eQTL(s) for each target gene, we
arrive at the eQTL graph G3 (Fig. 1) in which the edges connect eQTLs
with their target genes. G3 would represent the ﬁnal result of classical
eQTL mapping. If eQTL mapping was the envisioned goal, one could
stop the procedure at this point.

However, if the reconstruction of a gene regulatory network is the
ultimate goal then we need to select single candidate genes from each
eQTL. Since there is a high probability that only a few or even only one
of all the potential regulators of an eQTL are truely connected with the
target gene, keeping all interactions in G2 that emanate from one and the
same eQTL (the eQTLs being captured in G3) would result in many false
positive predictions in the reconstructed network. We therefore select
from each eQTL the candidate regulator with the maximal edge weight
to be the ‘true’ regulator of the target gene, i.e., for each eQTL C we
identify i—> j with Wij = max(wkj), k e C, as the true edge and all other
edges are removed from the eQTL C. We arrive then at the ﬁnal perturb-
ation graph G4 in Fig. 1 in which the nodes represent again genes.

2.5 Identifying and removing indirect effects
(TRANSWESD)

Candidate regulator selection in the previous section leads to the reduced
graph G4 where genetic linkage effects have been removed. We can now
assume that the edges in G4 reﬂect true causalities. However, an edge
may still represent an indirect effect induced by a chain of interactions
[e.g. the effect of gene g4 on gene g6 in G5 of Fig. 1 is likely to be induced
by the double-negative (thus positive) path g4—lg3 —|g6]. The goal of this
ﬁnal step is therefore to identify and eliminate edges that arise from
indirect effects. To this end we use our recently introduced algorithm
TRANSWESD, a TRANSitive reduction method for WEighted Signed
Digraph, which is brieﬂy described in the following (for further details see
Klamt et al., 2010). For TRANSWESD, we need association weights 2,]-
between nodes of the graph, which we directly derive from the edge
weight via 2,]: 1 — wij, i.e., a low 2,]- indicates a high association between
i and j. An edge 1' —> j with sign 5,,- and weight wij is removed, if there is an
alternative path Pi]- (i => j) connecting i and j with the following properties:
(a) Pi]- is simple, i.e., it does not contain a cycle; (b) Pi]- does not involve
edge 1' —> j; (c) the overall sign of Pi]- (obtained by multiplying the signs of
all its edges) is the same as Si]; ((1) the maximum weight of all edges on
path PU, zmaX(P,-j), fulﬁlls zmaX(P,-j)<oz 2,]. The conﬁdence factor or is typ-
ically chosen close (but smaller) than unity, we use here 0.95 as in Klamt
et al. (2010). If such a path Pi]- exists, then it is considered as an explan-
ation for the observed (indirect) effect of 1' upon j and the edge i—> j is
removed. If the graph is acyclic, the transitive reduction is unique and can
easily be found. To deal with cyclic graphs, TRANSWESD uses some
reasonable rules to resolve non-uniqueness [e.g., by removing edges with
highest weight (lowest association) ﬁrst] and also provides approximation
variants for large networks (cf. Klamt et al., 2010). For the computations
made herein, we used the TRANSWESD implementation of
CellNetAnalyzer (Klamt et al., 2007). After applying TRANSWESD,
we obtain the ﬁnal reconstructed graph G5.

2.6 Sorted edge list

Optionally, a sorted list (ranking) of regulator—target interactions can be
generated from the ﬁnal graph G5, e.g., for prioritizing edges for experi-
mental validation. We propose a sorted edge list which is made up of two
parts. The ﬁrst part of the sorted edge list contains all edges from the ﬁnal
graph, sorted according to edge weights with highest weights (2 most
signiﬁcant) ﬁrst. To also account for edges that have maybe wrongly
been dropped during thresholding (not contained in G1), cluster removal,
or by TRANSWESD, the second part contains all of these removed

edges, also sorted according to their edge weights [Equation (2)] in
descending order.

3 RESULTS

We applied the proposed method to (i) synthetic genetical gen-
omics data that were provided for a recent Systems Genetics
challenge of the DREAM initiative (DREAM 5, Challenge
3A; http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/dream/index.php/D503), and
(ii) real genetical genomics data from yeast, which were originally
published in Brem and Kruglyak (2005).

3.1 In silico genetical genomics data

The task of the Systems Genetics challenge of DREAM was to
infer causal gene regulatory networks from phenotype expression
data of a genotyped segregated population. Owing to lack of
reliable experimental datasets for benchmarking different recon-
struction algorithms, participants were given realistic in silico
data which were generated by the SysGenSIM software (Pinna
et al., 2011). The provided simulated data represent (noisy) data
from homozygous RILs, whereas the genome of each individual
consists of 1000 genes and is made up of 20 chromosomes with
50 genes each. Five different networks of modular scale-free
topology had to be reconstructed for three different sample
sizes (populations of 100, 300 and 999 RILs) eventually resulting
in 15 reconstructed GRN. The haploidic genotype for all genes in
all RILs was given as a binary vector (simulating the ideal situ-
ation of one marker per gene). The genotypes of adjacent genes
were correlated mimicking genetic linkage. Each gene was
assumed to have one functional genetic variant, either in the
promotor (cis effect on the gene’s expression rate) or coding
region (trans effect on the target gene) of the gene. One motiv-
ation of the challenge was to analyse the reconstruction quality
of participating methods when the population size becomes very
small in comparison to the number of genes (e. g., 100 RILs/1000
genes). For each sample size, the reconstructed networks in form
of a sorted edge list (last step in Fig. l) are passed to the evalu-
ation script of DREAM (for details see Stolovitzky et al., 2009
and www.the-dream—project.org). Since self-regulation was
excluded by the challenge, we removed edges i—> j where i: j.
The evaluation script quantiﬁes the reconstruction quality by
comparing the reconstructed GRN to the gold standard resulting
in AUROC and AUPR values. The resulting overall score is
based on empirical P—values relatively computed to all submitted
reconstructed GRNs (Stolovitzky et al., 2009). Applying our
method to the described DREAMS/3 A data is straightforward
and yields the results presented in Table l. The preprocessing
(Fig. l) is reduced to generating the marker/gene linkage map
L, since each gene had its own associated marker. When applying
our framework, we need to specify the parameters tQT and dmin.
Two scenarios were considered for the threshold tQT. First, based
on the gold standards, we determined for each of the three RIL
population sizes the optimal value (delivering the highest overall
score for all networks of this size), which is then used for all ﬁve
networks. It turns out that smaller population sizes require larger
threshold values: 0.23 for 100 RILs; 0.15 for 300 and 0.09 for
999. These optimal values correspond to P—values smaller than
0.01, when assuming simple t—statistic. In addition, for an

unbiased scenario, we sampled tQT uniformly in the range of
0.05 . . . 0.6, which deﬁne a plausible range of maximal and min-
imal edge numbers contained in G1, and computed the average
result over all networks (column G5* in Table 1). Regarding the
parameter dmin required for identifying eQTLs, we chose
dm,,,,=0.5 after inspecting geno—phenotype relationships in the
data (see Fig. 1, panel G2). However, we found that the results
are extremely robust w.r.t. changes of dmin. For example, the
overall scores varied <l% when varying dmm in a large range
of 0.3—0.8. In contrast, disregarding genetic linkage between mar-
kers by setting dmin = 1 leads to much lower reconstruction qual-
ity (see Table 1 overall scores of G2 versus G4). This also holds
for the other extreme case aim-"=0, which would result in one
large eQTL for all identiﬁed regulator candidates.

Several key observations can be made. Moving from the initial
perturbation graph G2 to G4 by our candidate regulator selec-
tion approach, we see a clear improvement with respect to FP
reduction at minimal loss of TPs by one order of magnitude. For
example, for the 999 RIL individual scenario, when transforming
G2 to G4, the number of false positive edges (FP) reduces on
average from 51 644 down to 3368, whereas the number of true
positives (TPs) reduces only from 2371 to 1844. Undesired re-
moval of TPs may occur by selecting the wrong regulator gene of
an eQTL or because several genes from an eQTL target the same
gene concurrently. In the second pruning step from G4 to G5,
TRANSWESD removes many indirect edges due to alternative
paths found in G4, improving in almost all cases the AUPR
value. As the precision [TP/(TP + FP)] of the reconstructed net-
work increases signiﬁcantly in all cases upon applying
TRANSWESD, one could expect an even better relative im-
provement of the AUPR value. However, there is only a mod-
erate increase of the AUPR because TRANSWESD removes
mainly edges with lower edge weight and thus with lower conﬁ-
dence (and ranking position) in the edge list. Generally,
TRANSWESD works better for networks with lower connectiv-
ity (in DREAM5/ 3 A, the edge density increases with increasing
network index from approximately 2000 up to 5000 edges) and
with larger sample size.

The made observations also hold for averaged scores from
uniformly sampled (non-optimal) threshold parameters tQT (see
G5* in Table l), i.e., the method is robust against threshold
selection. Comparing the results of the proposed framework to
the best performer of the DREAMS/3 A challenge for each RIL
sample size and different network topologies (last column in
Table l), we see a clear improvement also for randomly chosen
threshold parameters (G5* in Table 1). Even without applying
any FP reduction, G2 is almost always better than the best per-
former, although it was constructed based on a simple eQTL
mapping approach alone. G4/G5 obtained after pruning are
always better than the best performer [this also holds for an
improved version of the best performer method; cf. Vignes
et al. (2011)]. Further, moving from large to small sample
sizes, we see a clear relative improvement, i.e., increase of the
overall score (e.g. of G5* averaged over the ﬁve different net-
works) with respect to all DREAM participant submissions.
Consequently, our proposed method performs especially well
for small sample sizes. At a given sample size, our method has
averaged AUPR values which are up to three times larger than
the best performer in the case of 100 samples (G5* versus best

performer averaged over the ﬁve networks). This shows, that for
small sample sizes, a rather simple method based on pure correl-
ation measures in combination with FP reduction methods seems
to be the best choice, keeping in mind that many different meth-
ods have been used by the 16 participants. However, even for the
largest RIL populations provided in the DREAM5 / 3 A chal-
lenge, our method still achieves signiﬁcantly higher scores.

3.2 Realistic genetical genomics data of yeast

To test our approach with real data, we use genotypic and
expression data from 112 segregants obtained from a yeast
cross between BY and RM strains of Saccharamyces cerevisiae
(Brem and Kruglyak, 2005). The dataset was kindly provided in
preprocessed form by Alberto de la Fuente (CRS4, Sardinia).
Only 1573 of all 2956 markers were associated to at least one
of the 5736 expression-proﬁled genes. Further, a gene-to-marker
association list A was available. In contrast to the DREAM5 / 3 A
data, there were thus much fewer markers than genes. We
describe some of the steps in the workﬂow in more details:
After preprocessing the data by computing the linkage map
L from the marker genotypes in the RILs with dm,,,,=0.5
(we chose the same value as for the in silica data), we apply
the reconstruction framework to the matrices T and Q to
obtain G2. The correlation threshold has been set to
tQT= 0.23, corresponding to the determined optimal threshold
for the in silica data with 100 RILs (as this is closest to the 112
RILs available in this study). The two parameters were thus un-
biased and not speciﬁcally optimized for this dataset. Using the
linkage map L, the eQTL graph G3 is obtained, which is used to
derive the ﬁnal perturbation graph G4 by selecting from each
eQTL the gene—target interaction in G2 that has the highest edge
weight.

In the literature and in some databases, one can ﬁnd published
(most likely sub-networks) of the yeast gene regulatory network,
whose interactions have been identiﬁed from different sources,
including ChIP—chip and motif ﬁnding studies (Lee et al., 2002,
Reimand et al., 2010). However, a rigorous evaluation of our
inferred network is not trivial, as the reliability of the gold stand-
ards from the sources mentioned above is unclear. We therefore
pursue the following strategy to evaluate our reconstructed net-
work. In another challenge of DREAM5 (challenge 4.4; not to
be confused with the Systems Genetics challenge 3 A analysed in
Section 3.1), the goal was to infer a subpart of the yeast GRN
focusing on 333 candidate transcription factors (TF) and their
interactions with 5950 (potential target) genes based on 536
microarrays each containing expression proﬁles for a given

perturbation (e.g., speciﬁed gene knock-out or overexpression,
including partial replicates). The evaluation in this challenge was
based on a given gold standard containing interactions con-
sidered to exist between the genes of the given transcription
factors and all other genes (it is not known to the authors how
this gold standard was compiled), whereas self-regulation has
been excluded. Most genes (5451) of the data from Brem and
Kruglyak (2005) are present in the DREAMS/challenge 4.4 yeast
gold standard. To compare our absolute performance with
respect to this gold standard and relatively to the other 29 par-
ticipants of this challenge, we evaluated a subgraph of our
reconstructed yeast GRN, which was restricted to potential inter-
actions between the 333 TFs as regulators and the 5451 target
genes present in DREAMS/4.4. We used the speciﬁc DREAM5
evaluation script, which computes the AUPR and AUROC
(and their P—values) of an inferred network with respect to the
provided gold standard. The results are presented in Table 2.
We ﬁrst observe that even though our reconstruction is based
on only 112 RILs (compared with the large number of 536
microarray experiments available to the participants of this chal-
lenge), the reconstruction belongs to the very best of the submis-
sions (rank 1 / 3 for AUROC/AUPR). Therefore, as observed also
for the in silica data (Section 3.1), the performance of our recon-
struction framework proves again its suitability for small sample
sizes. In Table 2 we also see that, when moving from G2 to G5
via G4, our applied FP-pruning strategies always improve the
precision-recall and associated P—values. The same holds for the
AUROC score, except that in G5 a minor reduction of the P-
value can be observed due to the loss of some TPs during FP
reduction.

Regarding the absolute quality of our reconstructed network,
we notice that it does not meet the high scores of the in silica
challenge DREAMS/3A. There are several possible reasons for
this behaviour. First, the amount and resolution of the in silica
data quality is much better, in particular, there was one marker
per gene (whereas only 1573 markers for 5736 genes are avail-
able in the yeast data). Although noise has been added to the in
silica data, it might be much higher under realistic conditions
or/and other sources of uncertainty might also hamper the visi-
bility of true interactions. Furthermore, the given gold standard
for the yeast transcriptional network cannot automatically be
considered to be the full truth. The similar low or even worse
quality of reconstructed networks submitted by the other par-
ticipants for DREAMS/4.4, may, at least partially, point to
missing or false edges in the gold standard itself. To test the
relevance of the inferred networks, it would therefore be

Network Reconstruction from Genetical Genomics Data

 

interesting whether the top-ranked interactions of the recon-
structions (not present in the gold standard) could be validated
in experiments.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this article, we presented a simple, yet effective, modular
framework for gene regulatory network reconstruction from gen-
etical genomics data. We showed that in the case of the
DREAM5/ 3A in silica data, our method (even in the non-tuned
case) outperforms the best performers which applied a combin-
ation of Bayesian network analysis, LASSO and the Dantzig
selector (Vignes et al., 2011). In the case of real data, we used
the DREAMS/4.4 yeast GRN gold standard to assess the quality
of the yeast GRN inferred by our method (and genetical gen-
omics data) relatively to networks inferred by classical perturb-
ation experiments and microarray data. The performance of our
network reconstruction compares to the very best of the submis-
sions, although we used just 112 RILs in contrast to
DREAMS/4.4 submissions, which were based on 536 micro-
arrays with well-deﬁned perturbations. Our analysis indicates
that simple correlation methods paired with subsequent FP-
pruning strategies outperform complex methods, especially for
small sample sizes (experimentally still most relevant). This is
most likely due to a larger noise sensitivity of multi-locus
method in contrast to univariate correlation analysis. Since
correlation-based eQTL mapping yields many true positive, but
also many false positive interactions, a local pruning based on
linkage information and a global pruning based on path know-
ledge is important (see Table 1 best performer of DREAM5/ 3 A
versus G2 and G4/5).

In view of our results, the proposed framework performs best
on data with one marker per gene, which might be realistic for
future ultra-high—throughput sequencing methods. As illustrated
in Section 3.2, the framework can be readily applied to the gen-
eral case where markers cover several genes and it can also be
adapted easily to cases with more than two different genotypes.
The presented local pruning approach for genetic linkage as-
sumes that only one regulator gene is selected per eQTL, which
therefore cannot account for the case that a target has several
regulators within one eQTL. A relaxed selection strategy can be
used based on partial correlation to potentially select more than
one candidate regulator per eQTL, cf. Bing and Hoeschele
(2005). In the case of complex traits, i.e., a trait is inﬂuenced
by several eQTLs, the univariate approach to generate G1
based on correlating one Q,- with one T]- at a time possibly
misses combinatorial effects and could therefore potentially
result in a higher number of false-negative regulator—target inter-
actions. Alternatively, a multi-locus method as the Lasso
(Tibshirani, 1996), the elastic net (Zou and Hastie, 2005) or the
random forests (Breitman, 2001) might be used. However, as has
been pointed out by Michaelson et al. (2010), for very large data
sets (millions of dense markers and phenotyped genes),
multi-locus methods cannot be used due to computational over-
load. Here, the presented approach provides a computationally
feasible and effective framework for ﬁltering the most important
interaction sites (on which multi-locus approaches can be
applied) as it does not use any optimization algorithm.

In its presented form the framework has only two threshold
parameters, which can be determined from the data in an opti-
mal way by a combination of several approaches (as outlined in
Section 2). The framework also allows an adjustment to other
reconstruction methods, i.e., modules in the workﬂow (Fig. 1)
may be replaced. For instance the candidate regulator selection
based on the eQTL map G3 may be exchanged by other
approaches, e.g., partial correlation or local regression.

Although our framework is based on a univariate analysis, it
can provide reconstructed GRN at higher precision-recall level
than advanced multi-locus methods, even with smaller sample
sizes. This might not hold in the case when combinatorial or
epigenetic effects (Brazhnik et al., 2002) are present, where
multi-locus approaches may become advantageous (Michaelson
et al., 2010). Therefore, in line with the key result of the DREAM
initiative stating that community efforts based on many different
reconstruction methods produce best results (Prill et al., 2011),
we conclude that meta-methods, e.g., as proposed by Vignes
et al. (2011), should combine both simple and complex methods.

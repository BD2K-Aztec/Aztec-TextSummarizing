ABSTRACT

Summary: We present GOssTo, the Gene Ontology semantic similar-
ity Tool, a user-friendly software system for calculating semantic simi-
larities between gene products according to the Gene Ontology.
GOssTo is bundled with six semantic similarity measures, including
both term- and graph-based measures, and has extension capabilities
to allow the user to add new similarities. Importantly, for any measure,
GOssTo can also calculate the Random Walk Contribution that has
been shown to greatly improve the accuracy of similarity measures.
GOssTo is very fast, easy to use, and it allows the calculation of
similarities on a genomic scale in a few minutes on a regular desktop
machine.

Availability: GOssTo is available both as a stand-alone application
running on GNU/Linux, Windows and MacOS from www.paccanaro-
lab.org/gossto and as a web application from www.paccanarolab.org/
gosstoweb. The stand-alone application features a simple and concise
command line interface for easy integration into high-throughput data
processing pipelines.

1 INTRODUCTION

Semantic similarity measures have become important in bioinfor-
matics as they provide a way of quantifying the functional re-
latedness between genes that is complementary to both
experimental information and sequence-based approaches. This
is done by annotating genes to the terms of a chosen ontology
and then quantifying the similarity between these terms. Among
the ontologies, the Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000)
has become a standard and is the focus of this work.

Several semantic similarity measures have been proposed. For
example, those by Resnik (1999), Jiang and Conrath (1997) and
Lin (1998) are based on the information content of the lowest
common ancestor of pairs of terms, and are often referred to as

‘term-based’; simUI and simGIC (Pesquita et al., 2008) and
GraSM (Couto and Silva, 2005) compare sets of terms rather
than single terms using graph comparison approaches and are
often referred to as ‘graph-based’.

An important recent development has been the introduction of
the Random Walk Contribution which greatly improves seman-
tic similarity measures Wang et al., 2012). In their paper, the
authors argued that existing measures have two important
deﬁciencies: ﬁrst, they do not take into account the descendants
of the terms; second, they do not model the inherent uncer-
tainty in the current annotations and ontology structure.
The Random Walk Contribution is a kind of ‘add on’ for exist-
ing similarity measures that enhances them to correct these
two issues.

Few software tools have been proposed for calculating seman-
tic similarities, including ProteinOn (F aria et al., 2007) IT—GOM
(Mazandu and Mulder, 2013) and G-SESAME (Du et al., 2007).
However, none of them can combine the Random Walk
Contribution proposed by Yang et al. (2012). Moreover, tools
provided as stand-alone applications are not readily extendable
with new semantic similarity measures, or are available only as
packages running within environments such as R or MATLAB.
Other tools are exclusively available online and their use is im-
practical for high-throughput analysis on large bodies of data.
Most tools do not allow for a straightforward calculation of
semantic similarities for a whole genome, or an easy updating
of the GO annotations.

In this article, we present GOssTo (Gene Ontology semantic
similarity Tool), a new tool for calculating semantic similarities
that overcomes all of the above limitations. GOssTo includes the
Random Walk Contribution by Yang et al. (2012) and it sup-
ports both term- and graph-based similarity measures.

GOssTo is available in downloadable binary form, with the
entire source code released under GPLv3. GOssTo is easy to use
and very fast—Table 1 shows the time required for calculating
the Resnik semantic similarity including the Random Walk
Contribution for a few model organisms. GOssTo features a
simple and concise command line interface and an application
programming interface (API) for easy integration into high-
throughput data-processing pipelines. GOssTo’s design allows
for user provided similarity measures to be independently

developed, compiled and linked at runtime. These features make
GOssTo a practical environment for both the development of
novel semantic similarity measures as well as for the calculation
of semantic similarities on a genomic scale.

GOssTo is also available online, through a clean web interface
from our server at www.paccanarolab.org/gosstoweb.
GOssToWeb provides access to the same functionalities of the
stand-alone application, allowing extensive conﬁguration of the
experiments through a user-friendly web form. The user can
select GO evidence code, GO relationships and a genome from
the list of organisms available in UniProt-GOA. GOssToWeb
automatically fetches the most recent version of the functional
annotation from UniProt-GOA and of the GO from its ofﬁcial
repository, thus ensuring that the most up-to-date data are used.
Results are provided by redirecting the user to a page from which
they can be downloaded. The system can notify the user with an
email containing a link to the result download page.

2 METHODS

The downloadable version of GOssTo is bundled with six commonly used
semantic similarity measures: the term-based measures by Resnik (1999),
Lin (1998), Jiang and Conrath (1997) and GraSM (Couto and Silva,
2005); the graph-based measures simUI and simGIC (Pesquita et al.,
2008). All these measures are extended with Yang et al. (2012)
Random Walk based procedure.

The guiding principles for GOssTo’s design aimed at producing a fast
and ﬂexible software package. This resulted in a highly modularized
architecture with very low coupling between individual modules. These
modules can be readily removed or replaced without affecting the overall
behaviour of the system.

The user can interact with GOssTo either through a command-line
interface or an API. The command-line interface provides UNIX-like
console parameter options as well as an interactive menu; the API

offers access to all the functionalities in the different modules through
a set of well-defmed functions. Thus, GOssTo can be used in three
different ways: as a part of a larger data-processing pipeline; as a
stand-alone application; as a static library for existing software.
For easy processing of the results, all output is presented in structured
plain text ﬁles.

GOssTo includes a powerful extension mechanism to add new seman-
tic similarity measures. A well-deﬁned interface grants the user access to
the data structures upon which new measures can be developed. After a
new measure is independently compiled, it can be dynamically linked to
GOssTo’s application core. The new measure can then be used in the
same way as the ones bundled with GOssTo. The current version of
GOssTo focuses on traditional semantic similarity measures which rely
mostly on the GO structure. Future versions will include the possibility of
handling Description Logic axioms which are being added to existing
ontologies (Ferreira et al., 2013).

GOssTo was developed using the Java programming language. The
JAMA package provides the internal data types and the required math-
ematical routines. GOssTo’s source code is freely available from GitHub
at https://github.com/pwac092/gossto and is released under the GPLv3
license. GOssTo runs on multiple platforms, and we have extensively
tested in on both GNU/Linux and Windows. More information
about GOssTo including a comprehensive manual is available from
www.paccanarolab.org/gossto

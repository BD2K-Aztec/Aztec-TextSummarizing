Abstract

Summary: FILTUS is a stand-alone tool for working with annotated variant files, e.g. when search-
ing for variants causing Mendelian disease. Very flexible in terms of input file formats, FILTUS
offers efficient filtering and a range of downstream utilities, including statistical analysis of gene
sharing patterns, detection of de novo mutations in trios, quality control plots and autozygosity
mapping. The autozygosity mapping is based on a hidden Markov model and enables accurate de-
tection of autozygous regions directly from exome-scale variant files.

Availability and implementation: FILTUS is written in Python and runs on Windows, Mac and
Linux. Binaries and source code are freely available at http://folk.uio.no/magnusv/filtus.html and on
GitHub: https://github.com/magnusdv/filtus. Automatic installation is available via PyPl (e.g. pip in-

stall filtus).

1 Introduction

Recent years have seen a revolution in Mendelian disease gene iden-
tification thanks to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods, in
particular whole-exome sequencing (WES). Most of the released
software for downstream analysis is aimed at bioinformatically
trained users, thus posing a challenge for many medical researchers
wanting to do hands-on analysis of HTS data. To accommodate
this, we introduce a program (FILTUS) offering advanced tools for
identifying disease-causing variants in an easy-to-use graphical
environment.

Several programs for manipulating variant files have been pub-
lished, including VarSifter (Teer et al., 2012) and the web-based
EVA (Coutant et al., 2012). In addition to efficient browsing and fil-
tering, FILTUS offers several specialized analysis tools aimed at
Mendelian disease projects. These include statistical evaluation of
variant sharing among patients, de novo detection in trios and auto-

zygosity mapping.

FILTUS accepts virtually any variant files, in contrast to most
existing programs which are limited to Variant Call Format (VCF)
or other specific input formats. Typical examples of non-standard
formats are VCF files with additional columns, and files produced
by Annovar (Wang et al., 2010). Although FILTUS is primarily in-
tended for WES-scale data, whole-genome data can be analyzed by
using the built-in prefiltering functionality.

Some countries have strict regulations requiring ofﬂine handling
of all human sequencing data, thus making it impossible to use web-
based tools or to download information during analysis. FILTUS is
ideal for such working conditions, requiring no installation, being
completely self-contained and offline.

In summary, the main features of FILTUS include:

° Stand-alone, ofﬂine desktop tool with user-friendly GUI
° Very ﬂexible in terms of input ﬁle formats

° Simultaneous analysis of up to several hundred exomes
° Fast, versatile ﬁltering, including summary table

2 Methods and results

2.1 Statistical evaluation of gene sharing

A common strategy for Mendelian disease gene identification is to
compare WES data from unrelated patients with the same pheno-
type. The basic idea is to apply strict filters, leaving only potentially
disease-causing variants compatible with the inheritance model, and
then look for genes where these variants are enriched among the pa-
tients. In many cases this method produces a long list of genes with
no obvious ranking. FILTUS implements a statistical model (Zhi
and Chen, 2012) for evaluating the significance of each gene in the
output (Supplementary Material S 1).

2.2 Detection of de novo mutations

There is an emerging understanding that de novo mutations are a
major cause of Mendelian disorders. As a result, trio sequencing
has become a popular design when faced with an isolated patient
with healthy parents (Chong et al., 2015). To overcome the prac-
tical challenge of false positives and negatives, Bayesian methods
are typically used, as in DeNovoGear (Ramu et al., 2013). FILTUS
implements a similar approach, computing posterior de novo
probabilities from the genotype likelihoods provided by the vari-
ant caller (Supplementary Material S2). We compared FILTUS
with DeNovoGear by applying both to a publically available trio
data set. The results were very similar, particularly when using fil-
ters typical in clinical settings (Supplementary Material S3). In
addition to posterior probabilities, FILTUS computes ALT allele
percentages for each trio member, facilitating ranking and
filtering.

2.3 Autozygosity mapping: the AutEx algorithm
Autozygosity (or homozygosity) mapping (Lander and Botstein,
1987) is a powerful method for mapping recessive disorders.
Traditional sliding-window approaches as offered by PLINK
(Purcell et al., 2007) are designed for dense, evenly distributed SNPs
and are not optimal for exome data. Better methods have recently
been proposed, e.g. H3M2 (Magi et al., 2014), and the -roh com-
mand of BCFtools (Li et al., 2009), but these require skillful bio-
informatic handling of sequence data.

As an alternative, we introduce the AutEx algorithm for detect-
ing autozygous regions directly from variant files. Our approach is
based on a hidden Markov model (Leutenegger et al., 2003)
described in Supplementary Material S4. The user specifies an ap-
proximate parental relationship and a column with allele frequen-
cies (if available). The output provides details of each estimated
autozygous segment, and can be directly used for filtering.
Zoomable plots show the detected regions with surrounding vari-
ants. An example of a disease gene identification aided by AutEx is
given in Supplementary Material S5.

We compared AutEx with traditional homozygosity mapping to
validate its performance, using data from a child of first cousin par-
ents for which both dense SNP genotypes and WES data were avail-
able. Taking the SNP-based homozygous segments (as detected by
PLINK) as the true segments, AutEx applied to the WES variants

exceeded 95% for both true positive and true negative rates
(Supplementary Material S6).

2.4 Visualizations

FILTUS offers various plots to aid QC of the variant files: gender esti-
mation (based on X-chromosomal heterozygosity levels), private vari-
ants (compared with the other samples) and autosomal heterozygosity
level (examples given in Supplementary Material S7). In addition histo-
grams and scatter plots can be made from any numerical columns.

3 Discussion

FILTUS has been used in many successful disease gene identifica-
tions, some of which are published (Baroy et al., 2015 ; Fjaer et al.,
2015 ; Hansen et al., 2015 ; Pedurupillay et al., 2015) and others cur-
rently in preparation. FILTUS runs on Windows, Mac and Linux
(see Supplementary Material SS for supported versions) and is ac-
tively maintained and developed. We believe it to be a valuable con-
tribution to the computer toolset of researchers and clinicians
working with HTS variant data, especially those without access to
specialized bioinformatics resources.

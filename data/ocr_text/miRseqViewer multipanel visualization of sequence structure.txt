ABSTRACT

Summary: Deep sequencing of small RNAs has become a routine
process in recent years, but no dedicated viewer is as yet available
to explore the sequence features simultaneously along with secondary
structure and gene expression of microRNA (miRNA). We present a
highly interactive application that visualizes the sequence alignment,
secondary structure and normalized read counts in synchronous multi-
panel windows. This helps users to easily examine the relationships
between the structure of precursor and the sequences and abundance
of final products and thereby will facilitate the studies on miRNA bio-
genesis and regulation. The project manager handles multiple samples
of multiple groups. The read alignment is imported in BAM file format.
Implemented features comprise sorting, zooming, highlighting, editing,
filtering, saving, exporting, etc. Currently, miRsquiewer supports 84
organisms whose annotation is available at miRBase.

Availability and implementation: miRsquiewer, implemented in
Java, is available at https://github.com/insooO78/mirseqviewer or at
http://msv.kobic.re.kr.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNA sequencing (miR—seq) is a powerful method to study
virtually all aspects of miRNA biology, including biogenesis,
molecular function and expression of miRNAs. With the ad-
vances in deep sequencing technologies, more laboratories are
adopting miRNA sequencing instead of microarrays or quanti-
tative PCR for such analyses (Cho et al., 2013). Typical proced-
ure of analyzing miR—seq data consists of preprocessing,
mapping, quantiﬁcation and identification of novel and/or dif-
ferentially expressed miRNAs, as implemented in recent integra-
tive platforms of MAGI (Kim et al., 2014) and CAP-miRSeq
(Sun et al., 2014). Even though the sequence variations such as
uridylation, iso-miRs and RNA editing are known to be import-
ant in biogenesis and function of miRNAs (Kim et al., 2009), we
still lack a dedicated alignment viewer to examine the details of

sequence features interactively and simultaneously with other
features such as secondary structure and read abundance. To
our knowledge, miRspring (Humphreys et al., 2013) is the only
software to support analysis of sequence variations, but its visu-
alization lacks interactive features.

Here, we present miRsquiewer, a J ava-based standalone plat-
form for visualizing miR-seq data. The read alignment is con-
currently displayed with the secondary structure as well as the
read count table that indicates miRNA expression in multiple
samples of multiple groups. Diverse features are implemented to
enhance user convenience.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

miRsquiewer is designed to be an OS—independent standalone
program to support individual laboratories to analyze their own
miR-seq data without uploading or transferring sequencing data
to other computers. Main program was developed using Java
Swing and JavaFX, thus requiring JDK 1.6 or higher version.
The program requires minimal dependency on other software for
easy installation. For example, no database system is required in
spite of its extensive use of miRNA information extracted from
the miRBase (Kozomara and Griffiths-J ones, 2014) since SQLJet
(TMate Software), compatible with SQLite 3.6, is implemented
as the backend database system. Basic GUI is based on docking
windows framework under the General Public License
(InfoNode Docking Windows from NNL Technology, 2009)
that allows users to move, dock and undock windows dynamic-
ally. We have tested the program in multiple operating systems
including Mac OS X, Windows and Linux.

Read alignment information is imported into
miRsquiewer in BAM file format produced by other align-
ment programs. In principle, BAM files need to be pre-sorted
and indexed using SAM tools (Li et al., 2009) or Picard
(http://picard.sourceforge.net). If not, miRsquiewer will use
Picard to create sorted and indexed BAM files during the
importing step.

We support all miRNAs in the miRBase database from ver-
sion 15 to version 21, covering 84 organisms in total. To avoid
unnecessary dump of huge genome sequence data of 84 organ-
isms to the user’s computer, the genomic sequence of selected
miRNAs to view are fetched in real time from our server via
HTTP protocol. The computer should be thus on-line during

Fig. 1. Screenshot of miRsquiewer. Mouse actions are synchronized among multiple windows, including the nucleotide position (vertical bar within the
alignment window and the red dot in secondary structure) and the read (horizontal bars within the alignment and read count windows) of interest. Note
that the mismatched nucleotides are colored in the alignment. Most color schemes can be customized

the analysis. In addition, it is important to use the identical ref-
erence genome for read alignment and for visualization. We rec-
ommend using the genome assemblies as speciﬁed in the
miRBase in the alignment process.

For novel miRNAs not included in the miRBase database,
users should identify novel miRNAs in advance by running a
program such as miRDeep2 (Friedlander et al., 2012), and pre-
pare a BED file containing the genomic information on miRNAs
of interest.

3 RESULTS

The GUI of miRsquiewer consists of project manager, align-
ment window, secondary structure window and read count table
as illustrated in Figure 1.

Defining a project is the starting point of every analysis. We
provide two wizards to define projects. Standard wizard allows
users to specify organism, groups of samples for comparison and
alignment BAM files, BED files for novel miRNAs of interest.
Quick wizard is useful for simple examination of sample data for
known miRNAs when no comparison between groups is neces-
sary. BAM file should be pre-sorted and indexed in quick wizard
mode.

The alignment window consists of navigation part, alignment
header and read alignment parts. Users select a miRNA or gen-
omic region to display. The depth profile of read alignment,
reference genome sequence, pre-miRNA sequence from
miRBase, and secondary structure segments are shown in the
alignment header. Reads in the alignment window can be
sorted in various ways, moved by drag-and-drop and edited.

Secondary structure of pre—miRNA is calculated using
ViennaRNA package in real time (Lorenz et al., 2011). The
color code and cursor position are coincident with those in the

alignment window. This helps users to explore sequence features
along with secondary structure information readily.

Read count table shows the normalized read counts of each
read for samples and groups as defined in the project. The back-
ground color indicates relative abundance. We implemented four
normalization methods (RPM, TMM, Lowess and quantile) as
well as diverse sorting and display options. Highlighted row in
the table is synchronized with the selected read in the alignment
window.

Several other features are implemented as well for user con-
venience. Filtering by read count, read length or mismatches is
supported. Exporting projects saves all alignment data and visu-
alization parameters into a local file (*msv), which can be shared
with colleagues or imported at a later time. The exported msv file
contains all information for miRsquiewer function including
read alignment, but the file size is much smaller because only
mapped reads are stored. In fact, the original BAM file is no
longer used in miRsquiewer once the project is created. We
further provide a summary window that reports nucleotide pro-
pensity, distribution of mismatches, read length, etc.

In conclusion, miRsquiewer provides a unique visualization
platform optimized for interactive analysis of miRNA deep
sequencing data, supporting 84 organisms in the miRBase
database.

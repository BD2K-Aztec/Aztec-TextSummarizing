ABSTRACT

Summary: Comparative genomics remains a pivotal strategy to
study the evolution of gene organization, and this primacy is
reinforced by the growing number of full genome sequences available
in public repositories. Despite this growth, bioinformatic tools
available to visualize and compare genomes and to infer evolutionary
events remain restricted to two or three genomes at a time, thus
limiting the breadth and the nature of the question that can be
investigated. Here we present Genomicus, a new synteny browser
that can represent and compare unlimited numbers of genomes
in a broad phylogenetic view. In addition, Genomicus includes
reconstructed ancestral gene organization, thus greatly facilitating
the interpretation of the data.

Availability: Genomicus is freely available for online use at
http://www.dyogen.ens.fr/genomicus while data can be downloaded

1 INTRODUCTION

From less than 20 fully sequenced metazoan genomes 4 years ago,
nearly 80 species are now represented in a variety of centralized
databases. This abundance of sequence data has reinforced the
role of comparative genomics as the primary approach to gain
insight in the organization of a genome. Comparing sequences from
different species serves several purposes: (i) to outline conserved
regions, a powerful guide to rapidly focus on functional regions;
(ii) to document differences among these functional sequences as a
ﬁrst step to understand broader biological differences (metabolic,
developmental, etc.) between organisms; and (iii) to identify
evolutionary events that have interrupted the gene colinearity
between the genomes of two species since their last common
ancestor.

To document and study the latter, the inference of ancestral gene
orders starting from extant species provides important reference
points; yet no visualization tool currently allows comparisons
between an ancestral genome to one or more of its modern
descendant. Existing software still limit the comparison to two or
three extant genomes at a time, and are restricted to a limited range
of species (Byrne and Wolfe, 2005; Courcelle et al., 2008; Derrien

at al., 2007; Dong et al., 2009; Jensen et al., 2009; Lyons et al.,
2008; Pan et al., 2005; Sinha and Meller, 2007).

To address these issues, we have developed Genomicus, a browser
dedicated to the study of synteny and the conservation of gene
order among multiple genomes (currently 52 metazoan genomes
and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Importantly, Genomicus
also integrates reconstructed ancestral synteny blocks at 44 ancestral
nodes.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data integration

Most of the genome data displayed in Genomicus is already stored, integrated
and publicly available from the Ensembl database (Hubbard et 01., 2009)
but without extensive synteny visualization tools. The two main types of
information that are required by Genomicus are gene positional information
in their respective genomes and phylogenetic relationships (orthology,
paralogy) between genes. Genomicus then edits Ensembl phylogenetic
trees (Vilella et al., 2009) in three ways. First, duplication nodes with a
Duplication Consistency Score (Vilella et al., 2009) below a threshold, that
is optimized to increase the synteny between extant genomes, are selected.
In such cases, duplication nodes are shifted towards terminal branches unless
stopped by an intermediate, strong, duplication node. Second, we have
added Boreoeutheria, Euarchontoglires and Atlantogenata ancestral nodes
in existing trees of placental mammals (Prasad et al., 2008). Third, we have
added some extant species that are not currently referenced in Ensembl
(Branchiostoma ﬂoridae, Nematostella vectensis and Oikopleura dioica),
together with their respective ancestral nodes. For each of these new species,
best reciprocal blast comparisons [best reciprocal hit (BRH)] are performed
between predicted proteins and the proteins from a set of key species already
referenced in Genomicus. Comparisons that are internally consistent (mutual
orthology relationships are respected) allow a given protein to be added in
the same phylogenetic tree as that of its BRH. In rare cases, a new protein
may act as outgroup to two existing trees and fuse them through a new
duplication node.

2.2 Reconstruction method

Ancestral syntenic blocks are reconstructed by a complex procedure that
will be described in details elsewhere (M.Muffato et al., manuscript in
preparation). Brieﬂy, parsimonious scenarios are estimated based on pairwise
comparisons of gene order between all available sequenced genomes (1378
comparisons in Genomicus v56.01). For a given ancestor, all ancestral genes
that are identiﬁed as conserved neighbours in at least one such comparison
become linked nodes in a graph. A weight (with values comprised between 1
and 1378) reﬂecting the number of times this situation was observed in all
the comparisons is then applied to each link.

At this stage, inconsistencies may appear in the form of ancestral genes
connected to more than two neighbours. To resolve these, the weighted graph

Fig. 1. PhyloView (A) and AlignView (B) of the horse PHOX2B gene as reference. In both views, the horse PHOX2B gene and its orthologs is shown in
light green over a thin vertical line. In (A), the right part of dog chromosome 13 is not syntenic with the horse and cow chromosomes (and therefore neither
with their ancestral one in Laurasiatheria). In (B), AlignView shows that this region underwent a dog—speciﬁc translocation onto chromosome 3. Furthermore,
the pig locus can be analysed with (B) but not in (A), because PhyloView is based on the phylogenetic tree of PHOX2B, which is not annotated in the pig
genome, whereas AlignView shows genes that are orthologous to genes across the locus of reference species, not just the reference gene. Coloured circles

between genes represent conserved CNEs.

is processed using a top—down greedy algorithm where the links of highest
weight are selected ﬁrst and are used to select the most likely gene—to—gene
connection in case of multiple choice.

This produces a set of linear paths in the graph connecting ancestral genes
based on the number of times their respective descendants are observed as
extant neighbours. We performed extensive simulations and benchmarked
our methods against several alternative methods: MGR (Bourque and
Pevzner, 2002), MGRA (Alekseyev and Pevzner, 2009) and InferCars
(Ma et al., 2006). Our method is the only approach able to satisfactorily
analyse data with the volume (53 species and 888217 extant genes) and
complexity (duplications, deletions) found in the complete set of sequenced
vertebrate genomes. The reconstructed gene order is correct in >95% of
the cases (speciﬁcity), and includes between 70% and 95% of the expected
ancestral gene pairs (sensitivity).

2.3 Systems and technical aspects

Genomicus is composed of Perl scripts and modules, executed with mod_perl
on an Apache2 server and querying an MySQL database. The pages embed
inline—SVG drawings in XHTML while the J avaScript usage is limited to an
information panel retrieved with AJAX calls. Users with browsers that are
not yet compliant with open web technologies require the Google Chrome
Frame extension (http://www.google.com/chromeframe).

3 USAGE AND ‘VIEWS’

The home page invites the user to enter its gene of interest and will by default
show a graphical representation in PhyloView.

° PhyloView shows the chosen reference gene in the centre of the display
with 15 neighbouring genes on both side, as well as orthologs and
paralogs of the query gene in their own respective genomic regions,
also with 15 neighbouring genes. When these neighbouring genes are
orthologs or paralogs of genes in the reference species, they are shown
with matching colours. Some species may appear twice if a copy of the
reference gene underwent a duplication (shown as a red square) within
the evolutionary range presented on the display.

0 AlignView shows an alignment between (i) the genes contained within
the genomic region of the reference gene and (ii) all their respective
orthologs in other species. Here also, the ‘query’ gene is centred and the
colour code is used to indicate orthologs between different genomes.
A species spanning multiple lines means that the reference gene content
is distributed over multiple chromosomes (or scaffolds; see the case of
dog in Fig. 1B).

In both views, the tree can be edited (by expanding, collapsing, hiding,
showing chosen nodes) to clarify the view. Genomicus also displays
orthologous conserved non—coding elements (CNEs) at three levels of
conservation. Finally, gene and loci information can be reached with links
to other browsers such as Ensembl, UCSC and NCBI.

4 FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

The main perspectives are to extend the functionalities and
the breadth of species displayed in Genomicus. In particular,
a ‘chromosome painting’ view showing extant and ancestral
karyotypes that are colour coded according to a species of interest is
currently in development. Genomicus will also follow the ‘Ensembl
Genomes’ project and will therefore extend its scope to include plant
and fungal genomes.

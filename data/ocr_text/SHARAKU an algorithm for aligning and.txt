Abstract

Motivation: Deep sequencing of the transcripts of regulatory non—coding RNA generates footprints
of post—transcriptional processes. After obtaining sequence reads, the short reads are mapped to a
reference genome, and specific mapping patterns can be detected called read mapping profiles,
which are distinct from random non—functional degradation patterns. These patterns reflect the
maturation processes that lead to the production of shorter RNA sequences. Recent next—
generation sequencing studies have revealed not only the typical maturation process of miRNAs
but also the various processing mechanisms of small RNAs derived from tRNAs and snoRNAs.
Results: We developed an algorithm termed SHARAKU to align two read mapping profiles of next—
generation sequencing outputs for non—coding RNAs. In contrast with previous work, SHARAKU in—
corporates the primary and secondary sequence structures into an alignment of read mapping
profiles to allow for the detection of common processing patterns. Using a benchmark simulated
dataset, SHARAKU exhibited superior performance to previous methods for correctly clustering
the read mapping profiles with respect to 5’—end processing and 3’—end processing from degrad—
ation patterns and in detecting similar processing patterns in deriving the shorter RNAs. Further,
using experimental data of small RNA sequencing for the common marmoset brain, SHARAKU
succeeded in identifying the significant clusters of read mapping profiles for similar processing pat—
terns of small derived RNA families expressed in the brain.

Availability and Implementation: The source code of our program SHARAKU is available at http://

1 Introduction

Since high—throughput sequencing allows for deep sequencing With
high sensitivity, RNA sequencing With a next—generation sequencer
(RNA—seq) can detect not only the complete expression patterns of
transcribed RNAs but also fragments derived due to the splicing,
maturation processing, or non—functional degradation of the RNAs.
RNA—seq studies targeting microRNAs (miRNAs) have revealed the
existence of many different RNA fragments derived from small
RNA species other than microRNA, providing further proof that

derived RNA fragments are not simply random degradation prod—
ucts but are rather stable entities, which might have functional activ-
ity (Martens—Uzunova et 61]., 2013). The evidence accumulating
about shorter sequences or fragments derived from non-coding
RNAs indicates that post—transcriptional processes are relatively
common mechanisms to derive functional smaller molecules from
various RNA families such as tRNAs and snoRNAs. For example,
the so—called tRNA—derived RNA fragments (tRFs) are derived from
processing at the 5’ or 3’—end of mature or precursor tRNAs (Lee

et al., 2009). These sequences constitute a class of short RNAs that
are the second most abundant type of RNA after miRNAs. Since the
discovery of small RNAs derived from tRNAs, a variety of names
have been used to refer to similar entities, such as tRNA—derived
RNA fragments (tRFs) (Lee et al., 2009), stress—induced small RNAs
(tiRNAs) (Yamasaki et al., 2009) and tRNA—derived small RNAs
(tsRNAs) (Haussecker et al., 2010). Their uniform start and stop
sites of cleavage in tRNA, together with their nonrandom size prop-
erty, strongly suggest that tRFs are derived from tRNA cleavage in a
specific and regulated manner (Lee et al., 2009). In addition, several
studies have identified a class of small fragments derived from
snoRNAs (called stNAs), some of which may regulate splicing or
translation (Chen and Heard, 2013; Taft et al., 2009).

The biological roles of such sno—derived RNA and tRNA—derived
small RNAs have primarily been investigated in cancer cells
(Martens—Uzunova et al., 2013). tRNA—derived fragments partici—
pate in several types of biological processes, including as signal mol-
ecules in a stress—induced response and as regulators of gene
expression. stNAs can function as miRNAs, regulators of alterna—
tive splicing, and tumor suppressors and oncogenes.

The reads for such short derived RNAs are relatively abundant,
i.e. greater than background levels, in small RNA—seq datasets.
Chen and Heard (2013) pointed out that ‘these reads are precisely
mapped to specific regions of primary or secondary structures, and
might contain special motifs or base biases, reﬂecting the involve—
ment of special enzymes involved in their generation’. Hence, map—
ping a large amount of sequence reads onto a reference sequence can
reveal specific forms of mapping patterns for the maturation process
or random patterns for non—functional degradations (see Fig. 1(a)).
These mapping patterns of RNA—seq short reads constitute the so—
called read mapping proﬁles (see Fig. 1(b)) (Pundhir et al., 2015).
Chen and Heard (2013) also pointed out that the non—specific deg—
radation products include RNA fragments that are rapidly digested
by the surveillance machinery from RNA molecules, which are de—
fective in processing, folding and functions. Thus, it is crucial to reli—
ably distinguish the true shorter RNAs from their non-functional
degradation products to clearly identify derived and functional small
RNAs and fragments. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to
develop a computational tool for the comprehensive analysis and
rapid identification of the post—transcriptional processing patterns of
non—coding RNAs based on high—throughput RNA—seq data. The al—
gorithm developed in this study was designed to capture specific
forms of read mapping patterns mapped to specific regions of pri—
mary or secondary structures reﬂecting the functional activities of
enzymes, and to distinguish them from non—functional degradation
products.

There are only a few existing tools (Erhard and Zimmer, 2010;
Hoogstrate et al., 2015; Langenberger et al., 2012; Videm et al.,
2014) to analyze such read mapping profiles of RNA—seq data and
detect footprints of the post—transcriptional processes or degrad—
ations of RNAs. FlaiMapper (Hoogstrate et al., 2015) predicts and
annotates non—coding RNA—derived fragments by determining the
start and stop positions from read mapping profiles. FlaiMapper can
predict miRNA boundaries with high accuracy. deepBlockAlign
(Langenberger et al., 2012), which our present study takes quite a
similar approach to, is an alignment—based method for alignments of
read mapping profiles to find non—coding derived RNAs that share
similar post—transcriptional processing. ALPS (Erhard and Zimmer,
2010) is also alignment—based, but is not designed for the purpose of
identification of short derived RNA fragments. BlockClust (Videm
et al., 2014) computes a similarity score between read mapping pro—
files to detect similar processing patterns and cluster read mapping

ages of SNORD14, and the dashed line represents the read coverages of

tion to encode read mapping profiles and calculates the similarity
scores based on a graph kernel. Therefore, BlockClust does not rely
on alignment—based techniques and is not designed for the purpose
of calculating the alignment of read profiles. However, all of these
methods are computed based only on the information of read map—
ping profiles and do not take the RNA sequence and secondary
structure information into account. Further, those methods did not
address the reliable distinguishability of processing patterns from
the random degradation.

Constructing an alignment for a pair of biological sequences
such as DNA, RNA and protein sequences is a fundamental and r0—
bust method of sequence analysis (Durbin et al., 1998). The pairwise
alignment of biological sequences is achieved according to inser—
tions, deletions and match operations so that the two sequences are
aligned with the same column length. The similarity score of an
alignment is calculated according to the predefined scores for inser—
tions, deletions and matches. Similarly, one can define the alignment
between a pair of read mapping profiles (see Fig. 1(c)).

In previous work with the deepBlockAlign algorithm
(Langenberger et al., 2012), the alignment program was designed to
compare and align any read mapping profiles regardless of the RNA
family to which they belong. The alignment program was also
applied to the comparison of read mapping profiles of the same
RNA gene across different samples that might be expected to induce
different read mapping profiles (Pundhir and Gorodkin, 2015). This
method is effective for the differential processing analysis of read
mapping profiles of each non—coding RNA gene. In contrast with
previous work, our primary goal was to detect specific forms among
similar read mapping patterns mapped to specific regions of primary
or secondary structures reﬂecting the functional activities of en—
zymes by alignments of read mapping profiles, and to distinguish
these from non—functional degradation products. We developed a
new read mapping profile alignment program named SHARAKU,
which incorporates the primary and secondary structures of RNA
sequences into an alignment of read mapping profiles. This is ac-
complished in combination with DAFS, a program for the simultan-
eous aligning and folding of RNA sequences (Sato et al., 2012). As a
result, the most advanced feature of SHARAKU is that it simultan-
eously aligns the read mapping profiles and RNA sequences with the
folding RNA secondary structures. Since each type of derived RNA
fragments is cleaved from its precursor with a specific context of pri—
mary sequence and secondary structure, we can expect that the sim—
ultaneous alignment of read mapping profiles with the primary and
secondary structures contributes to precise identifications of the
type of derived RNAs. Thus, application of SHARAKU to the mix-
ture of different RNA families would enable the accurate clustering
of read mapping profiles with respect to 5’—end processing or 3’—end
processing of each RNA family, and facilitate the detection of com—
mon processing patterns shared among different RNA families (see
Fig. 1(d)). Note that SHARAKU was not designed for classification
of RNA sequences into different RNA families. Further, SHARAKU
produces an alignment of read mapping profiles at the nucleotide—
level resolution, as Figure 1(c) displays. In contrast, deepBlockAlign
uses blockbuster (Langenberger et al., 2009) to generate block
groups and aligns any read mapping profiles at the level of individ-
ual blocks and block groups, including those in unannotated regions
or unknown RNA genes. On the other hand, the current version of
SHARAKU can only be applied to the annotated non—coding RNA
regions.

Several previous studies (Ono et al., 2011; Scott and Ono, 2011)
have explored the similarities and evolutionary relationships be—
tween snoRNAs and miRNA precursors. These similarity features
represent molecules involved in the same processing pathways with
a similar set of processing enzymes and the same RNAi targets.
These similarity features are often confirmed based on the conserva—
tion of their primary and secondary structures, such as structural
characteristics of typical H/ACA or C/D boxes. We hypothesized
that in addition to sequence structure conservation, determining the
similarity among read mapping profiles might help to identify the
functional or processing similarities between snoRNAs and miRNA

precursors.

2 Methods

When read mapping profiles for a pair of non—coding RNAs are ob—
tained, SHARAKU fundamentally aligns two read mapping profiles
by inserting gaps so that the sum of the differences of coverages at
all positions between the two profiles is minimized. Simultaneously,
SHARAKU takes information on the sequence and secondary

structures of RNAs into account when aligning read mapping pro-
files by integration with DAFS, which calculates reliable structural
alignments that maximize the expected accuracy of a predicted com—
mon secondary structure and its sequence alignment. The algorithm
can be efficiently implemented by using dynamic programming.
Second, SHARAKU calculates a similarity score (correlation coeffi-
cient) between two read mapping profiles based on the alignment.
Third, SHARAKU produces a similarity score matrix for all pairs of
read mapping profiles of non—coding RNAs in the target reference
genome. Subsequently, the agglomerative hierarchical clustering is
constructed based on the similarity score matrix.

2.1 Construction of read mapping profiles
Let Z = {A, C, G,U} denotes the four nucleotides and 2* denotes
the set of all finite RNA sequences consisting of bases in Z.

A set of sequence reads generated by RNA—seq data for non—
coding RNAs are mapped against the reference genome using stand—
ard mapping tools such as BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) (i.e. align-
ment programs) for a huge number of short reads. The read
coverage, i.e. the number (count) of mapped reads, at each position
in an annotated RNA gene—coding region is calculated from the out—
put of the mapping tool in BAM format. In an RNA gene-coding re-
gion, the read coverage 6,- at each position i is normalized so that
every normalized value of read coverage is between 0 and 1. For an
RNA sequence, denoted a = a1, . . . , am, of an annotated RNA gene—
coding sequence, we refer to the sequence of normalized coverages,
c“ : c‘f, . . . , 6;” as the read mapping profile of the RNA sequence
(see Fig. 1(a)). Note that SHARAKU only deals with the read map—
ping profile within the annotated RNA—gene sequence and calculates
the secondary structure within the annotated RNA—gene sequence.

2.2 Alignment algorithm for a pair of read mapping

profiles
Let 4:41,...,am and b:b1,...,bn denote a pair of RNA se—
quences, c“ : c‘f, . . . , a; and cb : elf, . . . , cf; denote the normalized

read mapping profiles. The optimal alignment of a pair of two nor—
malized read mapping profiles 6“ and Cb is calculated by the follow—
ing recursive formula to minimize the sum of the differences of
coverages at all positions. The mismatch score at a position of an
alignment between c“ and Cb is simply defined as the absolute differ—
ence of the two coverage values cf and 65’. To define the gap score,
first, the coverage value at a gap inserted between j and j—1—1 is
defined as  —1— cf+1)/2 (i.e. the average of cf and of“). Second, the
gap score between position i of c“ and the gap inserted between j
and j +1 of Cb is defined as the absolute difference of cf and

In order to avoid an unnecessary number of gaps inserted, which
could cause artificial alignments, the number of gaps inserted into
the alignment is restricted by the predefined parameter 3). This can
be implemented by dynamic programming to control the number of
inserted gaps.

2.3 Alignment of read mapping profiles incorporating
sequence structures

Previously, we developed DAFS (Sato et al., 2012), an algorithm
that simultaneously aligns and folds RNA sequences on the basis of
maximizing the expected accuracy (MEA) of a predicted common
secondary structure and its alignment. That is, DAFS calculates the
maximization of the expected accuracy over all possible structural
alignments of a pair of RNA sequences. Then, DAFS finds one opti—
mal structural alignment, i.e. the most accurate structural alignment
with the most plausible secondary structure of each input RNA se—
quence. Here, we combine the alignment algorithm for read map-
ping profiles with DAFS according to the same MEA principle in
order to incorporate the primary and secondary sequence structures
into the alignment of read mapping profiles.

For an RNA sequence a = 611612 - --a,,, E 2*, let |a| denote the
number of bases appearing in a, which is called the length of 61.
Given two RNA sequences a, b E 2*, let A(a, b) denote the set of all
possible alignments of a and b, that is, RNA sequence alignments
without considering the secondary structures. Let 8(a) and 8(b) de—
note the set of all possible secondary structures of a and the set of all
possible secondary structures of b, respectively. An alignment
t E A(a, b) is represented as a |a| >< |b| binary—valued matrix
t : (tik), where tik : 1 if and only if the base a,- is aligned (matched)
with bk. A secondary structure x E 8(a) is represented as a |a| >< |a|
binary—valued triangular matrix x : (x,,-),-<l-, where x,,-1 : if and
only if bases 61,- and a,- form a base pair. Let As(a, b) denote a set of
all possible structural alignments of a and b, that is, simultaneous
alignment of RNA sequences and their secondary structures.
We write 0 = (x, y, t), which means that a structural alignment
0 E As(a, b) consists of an alignment t E A(a, b), and two secondary
structures x E 8(a) and y E 8(b).

First, in DAFS, a gain function G(0,0) of a structural alignment
0 = (2?, i?) with regard to the correct structural alignment 0
= (x, y, t) is defined as the weighted sum of gain functions GSS (x, x)
and G550),  of the respective secondary structures and a gain func—
tion Ga1n(t, ?) of the alignment:

GM) = acme?) + Gay. m} + Gama <1)

where or > 0 is a parameter that controls the weight of the secondary
structures and the sequence alignment. Intuitively, the gain function
G(v,f?) can be regarded as a kind of ‘accuracy’ that represents the
weighted sum of the number of true positive predictions and true
negative predictions in 17, which is correlated to balanced accuracy
measures such as Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and
F—measure. In the case of the gain function GSS (x, x) for the second—
ary structure, a true prediction in x is a pair of bases 61,- and a,- such

that 2?,- : xii. In the case of Gamma for the sequence alignment, a
true prediction in fis a pair of bases 61,- and bk such that Eye : tik.
Second, when we calculate a structural alignment for a pair of
RNA sequences, their correct structural alignment is unknown. In
such case, we compute the expectation of a gain function under the
distribution over all possible structural alignments of the pair of
RNA sequences. The expectation E9|a7b[G(0,/H\)] of the gain function
G(0,0) under a given probability distribution over the space
As(a, b) of structural alignments is maximized to find a structural

alignment 0:

Eel.,bic<e.5>1 = Z Mela. acme) <2)
0EA5(a,b)

where P(0|a, b) is a probability distribution of the RNA structural
alignments. To reduce the computational complexity of Equation
(2), the probability distribution P(0|a, b) of the structural alignments
is factorized as follows by assuming the independence of the struc—

tures and alignment:

Held: 19) % P(x|d)P(3/|b)P(t|da 19),
where P(x|a) and P(y|b) are the probability distributions of RNA
secondary structures over 8(a) and 8(b), respectively, and P(t|a, b)

is a probability distribution of alignments over A(a,b). The ex-
pected gain function (2) can then be approximated as follows:

E9..,bic<e.6>1= Z P<ela.b>c<e.5>

% Z [19)?“ — are

i<i k<l

where pg?) denotes a base—pairing posterior probability, [9)?“ de—
notes an alignment—matching posterior probability, 0' and t (0 g a,
t g 1) are balancing parameters between true positives and true
negatives, and C is a constant independent of 0 (see Sato et al., 2012
and its Supplementary Material for the derivation).

In order to incorporate the DAFS framework of the simultaneous
aligning and folding of RNA sequences into the alignment of read
mapping profiles on the basis of the MEA principle, we need to de—
fine the expectation of the gain function for alignments of read map—
ping profiles. First, we define the partition function (McCaskill,
1990) for alignments of read mapping profiles. The partition func-
tion is equal to the alignment kernel K(a, b) (Morita et al., 2009;
Saigo et al., 2004) that measures the similarity between two se—
quences a and b by summing the scores obtained from all possible
alignments with the gaps of the sequences. The partition function
Z(c“,cb) for alignments of read mapping profiles 6“ and Cb are
defined as follows:

Z(c“, Cb) = eTﬁ‘S(Ca’Cb’t)

tEArmlD (ca ,cb)

where Armp(c“, Cb) denotes the set of all possible alignments between
a pair of read mapping profiles 6“ and Cb, and 5(6“, cb , t) denotes the
score of an alignment t E Armp(c“, Cb) between c“ and Cb:

The ‘forward’ algorithm to compute the partition function
Z(c“, Cb) for read mapping profiles can be implemented by the fol—
lowing recursive formula:

F(z‘.i. rg. lg) = e—ﬁ'm‘i” Fa — 1.) — 1. rg. lg)
+ e—ﬁ'tgr‘i” F(i — 1.1; rg — 1.1g)
+ e—ﬁ"-g“"<"="> F(i,i — 1. rg. lg — 1)

where two variables rg and lg are used for controlling the number of
inserted gaps. The ‘backward’ algorithm to compute B (i, j, rg, lg)
can also be defined in a similar manner.

Now, we can define a posterior probability of positions 1' and j to
be aligned in the alignments of read mapping profiles:

Pp, j, rg, lg) B0. 1', rg, lg)

The expectation Eelaabﬂacb[G(0,0)] of the gain function C(03)
for the correct alignment of read mapping profiles, correct sequence
alignments and correct secondary structures under a given probabil—
ity distribution over the space Assrmp(a,b,c“,cb) of simultaneous
alignments of read mapping profiles, RNA primary sequences and
secondary structures is defined and approximated as follows:

where Assrmp(a,b,c“,cb) denotes the set of all possible alignments
between a pair of read mapping profiles 6“ and Cb, taking the pri-
mary and secondary sequence structures between a pair of RNA se—
quences a and b into account, and wrmp (0 g wrmp g 1) is a
parameter that controls the weight of the read mapping profile
alignment and the sequence alignment.

The ‘optimal’ alignment 0 can be obtained by maximizing the
expected gain function Eelaabacajcb [G(0,0)] on the basis of the MEA
principle. Further, the maximization of the expected gain function
can be efficiently implemented using the techniques such as ‘dual de—
composition’, ‘subgradient optimization’ and ‘dynamic pro-
gramming’ (see Sato et al., 2012 for more details).

2.4 Similarity score calculation between read mapping
profiles

Let 0 be the alignment for a pair of read mapping profiles, 6“ and Cb,
obtained by maximizing the expected gain function
Eelaabacaacb[G(0,’é)]. We define the similarity score function denoted
Sm(c“, cb ) between c“ and Cb based on the alignment 0 as follows:

[2 [2

Sm(c“,cb) :  cf—cf’ —1— 2 cf 2

The similarity score Sm(c“, Cb) is exactly equal to the normalized

inner product (cosine coefficient) of two gap—inserted read mapping
profiles in the alignment  Therefore, Sm(c“, Cb) represents the cor—
relation coefficient between two read mapping profiles 6“ and Cb
based on the alignment 

3 Results
3.1 Datasets

In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we generated
simulated read data in the form of typical next—generation sequenc—
ing output (based on an Illumina—type of short sequence reads). To
evaluate the clustering ability to detect similar processing patterns,
the labeled data of various classes of different processing patterns
are required, such as 5’—end processing, 3’—end processing and non—
processing. However, comprehensive annotations of such labels for
all small non-coding RNAs are not available in existing real data
such as the sequence read archive. The only exception is the miRNA
family, for which the mature miRNA annotations are accessible in
the NCBI Reference Sequence Database.

First, we obtained the small RNA annotation and sequence data
for miRNAs (24 genes), snoRNAs (37 genes) and tRNAs (41 genes)
with a length less than 120 nt from the Ensembl genome browser for
the mouse genome (GRCm38). Second, according to the results of
previous studies that analyzed and identified the existence of various
types of small RNA—derived fragments (Chen and Heard, 2013;
Kawaji et al., 2008; Ono et al., 2011; Scott et al., 2012), we deter—
mined the start or end sites of derived fragments that simulated 5’—
end processing or 3’—end processing in snoRNAs and tRNAs to be
within a few bases from the 5’—end or 3’—end, respectively. Further,
we set the length of the derived fragments to 20 nt for snoRNAs and
to 30 nt for tRNAs. For miRNAs, we used the annotations for ma—
ture miRNAs in the NCBI Reference Sequence Database. Third, we
generated 88324 simulated sequence reads that contain the full—
length transcripts of snoRNAs and tRNAs (that is, the complete se—
quence reads exactly identical to the annotated snoRNA and tRNA
sequences), mature miRNAs and their derived fragments. In add—
ition, the set of ‘degradation reads’ was artificially constructed from
the simulated complete reads of snoRNAs and tRNAs. In general,
there are three major classes of RNA—degrading enzymes (Houseley
and Tollervey, 2009): endonucleases that cut RNA internally, 5’
exonucleases that hydrolyze RNA from the 5’—end and 3’ exonucle—
ases that degrade RNA from the 3’—end. In our study, we only con—
sidered the degradation of RNA from the 3’—end, which is more
reﬂective of non—functional degradation for unstable RNAs. Thus,
the set of degradation reads was obtained by eliminating 40—60% of
the nucleotides from the 3’—end in order to simulate the degradation
process. The degradation reads constituted 20% of the set of simu—
lated complete reads. In total, the simulated read dataset consisted
of the complete reads of snoRNAs and tRNAs, the derived fragment
reads for 5’—end processing of miRNAs, snoRNAs and tRNAs, the
derived fragment reads for 3’—end processing of miRNAs, snoRNAs
and tRNAs, and the degradation reads. Each of the 102 small RNAs

used for the simulated data was labeled according to one of the
above—mentioned classes as follows: (i) 5’—end processing of
miRNAs, (ii) 3’ -end processing of miRNAs, (iii) 5’—end processing of
snoRNAs, (iv) 3’—end processing of snoRNAs, (v) 5’—end processing
of tRNAs, (vi) 3’—end processing of tRNAs, (vii) degradation of
snoRNAs and tRNAs. These class labels were used for experimental
evaluation of the clustering performance. (See also Supplemental
Figure S1 that displays all read mapping profiles obtained by map—
ping the simulated read data to the 102 annotated small RNA
sequences.)

To demonstrate the practical usefulness of SHARAKU, we used
a real dataset obtained from an RNA—seq experiment of the hippo-
campus of the left brain of a 2—year—old male common marmoset
that was being bred at the Central Institute for Experimental
Animals (CIEA). The total RNA was extracted and was subject to
removal of rRNA and 5’ Cap, and then the cDNA library of small
RNA was prepared using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kit
(Illumina). The small RNA transcripts were sequenced with the
next—generation sequencer MiSeq (Illumina) for a sequence read
length of 270 bp, which enabled generating the complete sequences
of most small RNA families. The short reads were subject to cutting
adapters and quality filtering. The qualified reads were then mapped
to the common marmoset (Callitlorz'x jacclous) draft genome caljac—
3.2 (MGSAC, 2014) by BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009). The tRNA an-
notation was predicted by tRNAscan—SE (Lowe and Eddy, 1997). In
total, the annotation and sequence data for 619 non—coding small
RNAs were obtained (194 miRNAs, 316 snoRNAs, 109 tRNAs)
from the Ensembl genome browser (Ensembl 73 version;
‘Callithrix_jacchus.C_jacchus3.2.1.73.gtf’ file) for the common
marmoset genome (C_jacchus3.2.1).

3.2 Validation of clustering accuracy with the simulated
dataset

We validated the clustering performance based on our alignment method
for all pairs of read mapping profiles using the simulated dataset. First,
the similarity score matrix for all pairs of read mapping profiles was cal—
culated by SHARAKU. We used empirically determined parameters:
ﬂ = —3.0, wrmp : 1.0, L0,, = 4.0, 0' = 0.0, t = 0.2. Second, the (ag—
glomerative) hierarchical clustering method with group averaging was
applied based on the similarity matrix. The agglomerative method of
hierarchical clustering hclust implemented in the R—package was used for
subsequent analysis. We evaluated how well each processing pattern and
RNA family in the simulated dataset was separated into a distinct cluster
according to the hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, we compared the
clustering performance based on SHARAKU with that of the alignment-
based method deepBlockAlign (Langenberger et al., 2012) using the de—
fault parameters. As the input to deepBlockAlign, the output of block—
buster executed on the input of the simulated dataset was given together
with the sequence annotation information. In the case of the simulated
dataset, this does not affect the result of performance evaluation, because
the sequence reads (except for shorter derived RNAs) in the simulated
dataset are identical to the complete RNA sequences annotated in the
Ensembl genome browser, so that every block that is output by blockbus—
ter with the input of the simulated dataset is identical to one of the anno—
tated RNA sequences. Note that since another alignment—based scoring
system ALPS (Erhard and Zimmer, 2010) was not publicly available, we
did not compare the performance with ALPS.

In the validation experiment using the simulated read dataset,
the simulated reads were mapped to the mouse genome (GRCm38)
by BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) with the default parameters, except
that —a bwtsw was set as the bwa index. From the output in BAM

format, the normalized read mapping profiles for non-coding RNAs
were obtained and fed to the alignment programs.

We evaluated the overall quality of the clustering tree using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis proposed in (Will
et al., 2007). (Note that we can obtain different resultant clusters
from a clustering tree depending on a distance threshold to cut the
branches.) Given a distance threshold, the number of true positives
(TP) was defined as the number of read mapping profile pairs that
have the same class label and are correctly assigned to the same re—
sultant cluster. In the same manner, the numbers of false positives
(FP), true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) are defined by
counting the pairs from different class labels but the same resultant
cluster, the pairs from different class labels and different resultant
clusters, and the pairs from the same class label but different result—
ant clusters, respectively. The ROC analysis was performed by plot—
ting the true positive rates TP/(TP—i—FN) versus the false positive
rates FP/(TN—i— FP) for different distance thresholds. The quality of
the clustering was measured by the area under the ROC curve
(AUC).

Table 1 shows the results of AUC scores obtained with the three
methods, and Figure 2 (left) shows the ROC curves generated by
SHARAKU and deepBlockAlign. The AUC scores to indicate the
clustering abilities of three methods were calculated for the dataset
of all read mapping profiles (the mixture of read mapping profiles of
miRNAs, snoRNAs and tRNAs) and for the dataset of read mapping
profiles of each family, tRNA, snoRNA and miRNA. For the dataset
of all read mapping profiles, SHARAKU achieved an almost perfect
AUC score, and hence an almost perfect clustering result, and ex—
hibited higher accuracy than deepBlockAlign. SHARAKU also suc—
ceeded in completely discriminating the degradation pattern from
post—transcriptional processing such as 5’ or 3’—end processing. The
alignment obtained by SHARAKU without considering the primary
and secondary sequence structures (‘SHARAKU without DAFS’)
presented lower AUC scores, which implied that incorporation of
the sequence structure information is required to achieve high

clustering accuracy. On the other hand, for the dataset of read map—
ping profiles of each family, both SHARAKU and deepBlockAlign
achieved an AUC score of 1.0, which indicates a perfect clustering
result. This result, together with that obtained for all read mapping
profiles, clearly indicates that the alignment incorporating the sec—
ondary structures is indispensable for the accurate clustering of read
mapping profiles generated from the mixture of different RNA fami-
lies. Figure 2 (right) shows an alignment produced by SHARAKU
for a pair of RNAs (Mir92—1 and SNORD63) in the simulated data—
set that could be successfully separated into two different clusters by
SHARAKU, but were clustered together by deepBlockAlign, thereby
highlighting the importance of taking the secondary structures into
account for alignments of read mapping profiles. (More alignments
are also shown in Supplemental Figs S2 and S3.)

Table 2 shows the computational times required by the three
methods for each simulated dataset. Table 2 indicates that
SHARAKU needs a large amount of additional computational time
compared with deepBlockAlign and SHARAKU without DAFS to
simultaneously align the read mapping profiles and RNA sequences
and calculate the secondary structures.

3.3 Clustering a real dataset of RNA transcripts in the
marmoset brain

A total of 33.8 million (M) sequence reads with a length of 270 bp
for small non—coding RNAs was generated using an Illumina MiSeq
sequencer. After quality filtering, 30.5 M reads were mapped to the
common marmoset (Callitlorz'x jacclous) draft genome caljac—3.2
using BWA. From the output in BAM format, the normalized read
mapping profiles for 619 non—coding RNAs were obtained and fed
to the alignment programs.

The dendrogram of clustering tree of hierarchical clustering
based on the SHARAKU alignments of read mapping profiles of the
619 non-coding RNAs is shown in Figure 4. Most of the read map—
ping profiles were clustered and well separated into five major clus—
ters, representing (1) 3’—end processing of miRNAs (containing 80
miRNAs); (2) 5’—end processing of snoRNAs and tRNAs (containing
25 snoRNAs, 62 tRNAs and 5 miRNAs); (3) non—processing and
non—degradation of snoRNAs and tRNAs (containing 210
snoRNAs, 10 tRNAs and 1 miRNA); (4) degradation of snoRNAs
and tRNAs (containing 42 snoRNAs, 20 tRNAs and 1 miRNA);
and (5) 5’—end processing of miRNAs (containing 81 miRNAs and 2
tRNAs). In addition, the read mapping profiles representing 3’—end
processing of snoRNAs and tRNAs (containing 26 snoRNAs,
3 tRNAs and 3miRNAs) were scattered into four different clusters
(6—1), (6—2), (6—3) and (6—4). These 4 clusters could be defined as the
complement of the clusters (3) and (4), which might provide a clear
interpretation.

A representative read mapping profile in each cluster is shown
below the clustering tree. Interestingly, 60% of the tRNAs were pro—
cessed for deriving shorter fragments mostly at the 5’—ends, whereas

80% of the snoRNAs were non—processed. A few other interesting
small clusters were obtained and will be discussed below.

In addition to confirming the utility of the new algorithm, this
experiment revealed the post—transcriptional processing and the ex—
pression patterns of small derived RNAs in the marmoset brain. To
the best of our knowledge, this represents the first identification of
the processing patterns of derived RNAs expressed in the brain. The
result of hierarchical clustering based on the deepBlockAlign align-
ments is shown in Supplemental Figure S4.

3.4 Verification of small derived RNA transcripts by
northern blotting

In order to verify that a derived RNA fragment predicted by the
clustering method based on SHARAKU is truly derived and ex—
pressed and not an experimental artifact, we performed northern
blotting analysis with a sample of the marmoset spleen. A small
RNA—seq analysis for the total RNAs extracted from the marmoset
spleen was executed and northern blotting for Leu—CAA—tRNA was
performed. The read mapping profile of this Leu—CAA—tRNA be—
longed to a cluster representing 5’—end processing of tRNAs in the
hierarchical clustering tree generated by SHARAKU. Figure 3 shows
the read mapping profile for Leu—CAA—tRNA obtained from the
RNA—seq reads (left), as well as the northern blots for Leu—CAA-
tRNA (lenght: 105 nt) and the derived fragment (expected length:
35 nt) from the tRNA (right). The results clearly proved the actual
presence of the derived RNA fragment.

4 Discussion

Several previous studies (Ono et al., 2011; Scott and Ono, 2011)
have explored the similarities and evolutionary relationships be—
tween snoRNAs and miRNA precursors. As a result, various rela—
tionships between snoRNAs and miRNAs have been identified,
from ‘snoRNAs with miRNA features’ to ‘dual function sno—
miRNAs’ and ‘miRNAs with snoRNA features’. These similarity
features represent molecules involved in the same processing path—
ways with a similar set of processing enzymes and the same RNAi
targets. These similarity features are often confirmed based on the
conservation of their primary and secondary structures, such as
structural characteristics of typical H/ACA or C/D boxes. We
hypothesized that in addition to sequence structure conservation,
determining the similarity among read mapping profiles might help

brane was then exposed to a phosphoimager and scanned. The largest band
appearing at a distance just short of the 100-nt marker indicates the expres-
sion of the origin tRNA from which the short fragment RNA was derived

Fig. 4. Dendrogram of hierarchical clustering based on SHARAKU alignments for the read mapping profiles of 619 non-coding RNAs. Annotations of 5 major clus-
ters plus 4 scattered clusters and a representative read mapping profile in each cluster are shown below the clustering tree

to identify the functional or processing similarities between
snoRNAs and miRNA precursors. An interesting small cluster in the
clustering tree shown in Figure 4 (highlighted with an arrow and as—
terisk) consisted of a mixture of snoRNAs, miRNAs and tRNAs. In
particular, we found that the snoRNA ‘HBII-52’ and the miRNA
‘let—7a’ have quite similar features in their secondary structures and
read mapping profiles, indicating a similar processing mechanism to
produce the derived shorter fragments at 3’—ends. Figure 5 shows
these features.

Indeed, small derived RNAs from HBII—52 were previously re—
ported to resemble miRNAs (Chen and Heard, 2013).

Another interesting cluster is cluster (6) of the 5’—end processing
of miRNAs. The cluster contained two tRNAs. ‘Pro—TGG—tRNA’
has the typical miRNA—like secondary structure and miRNN
miRNA“' duplex, shown in Figure 6. Supporting this result, previous
work has indicated possible cross—talk between tRNA—derived RNA
fragments and the canonical pathway of miRNAs (Sobala and
Hutvagner, 2011).

Thus, the alignments and clustering of read mapping profiles
using SHARAKU can give insight into revealing the common pro—
cessing patterns in different families of non-coding RNAs and their
derived fragments, which could help to clarify the processing path—
ways and biological functions of derived RNA fragments.

One of the merits of SHARAKU is to calculate the optimal align—
ment based on not only the pattern of read mapping profiles, but
also primary and secondary structures of RNA sequences. Since
each type of derived RNA fragments is cleaved from its precursor
with a specific context of primary sequence and secondary structure,
we can expect that the simultaneous alignment of read mapping pro-
files with the primary and secondary structures contributes to pre—
cise identifications of the type of derived RNAs. To combine the
pattern of read mapping profiles and the primary and secondary
structures of RNAs, a Sankoff—type algorithm is required to be im-
plemented. We implemented SHARAKU with DAFS framework,
which enabled to efficiently combine the pattern of read mapping

In the present study, we have only dealt with annotated non—
coding RNAs. However, SHARAKU can also be applied to the
alignment and clustering of novel and unannotated regions by em—
ploying tools such as blockbuster (Langenberger et al., 2009) in
order to determine the expressed block regions on the reference gen—
ome that are obtained from RNA—seq reads. As non—functional deg—
radation products, we only considered the degradation of RNA
from the 3’—end in the simulated dataset. Therefore, performance
evaluations of SHARAKU to determine the tolerance for the other
two classes of RNA—degradations, endonucleases and 5’ exonucle—
ases, are required. These issues will be addressed in our future work.

5 Conclusion

With the aim of offering computational tools for comprehensively
analyzing the post—transcriptional processing patterns of non—coding
RNAs and detecting their common processing patterns, based on
RNA—seq, we developed a new algorithm called SHARAKU to align
two read mapping profiles of next—generation sequencing data for
non-coding RNAs. SHARAKU incorporates the primary and sec—
ondary structures of RNA sequences into an alignment of read map-
ping profiles by combining with DAFS, which constructs reliable
structural alignments that maximize the expected accuracy of a pre—
dicted common secondary structure and its sequence alignment.
SHARAKU could simultaneously align the read mapping profiles
and RNA sequences with information of the folded RNA secondary
structures. In an experiment using a simulated dataset, SHARAKU
achieved an almost perfect clustering result, and exhibited higher ac-
curacy than deepBlockAlign. In an experiment with real data of
small RNA sequencing for the common marmoset brain,
SHARAKU succeeded in identifying the five major clusters plus four
scattered clusters representing typical processing patterns. This
method also revealed some interesting clusters consisting of mix-
tures of several RNA families that predicted common processing
patterns among different RNA families. These results demonstrate
that SHARAKU can be an indispensable tool for analyses of the pro—
cessing patterns and functions of regulatory non—coding RNAs with
deep—sequencing data.

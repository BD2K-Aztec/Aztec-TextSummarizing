ABSTRACT

Summary: Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. Screening
anticancer candidates from tens of millions of chemical compounds is
expensive and time-consuming. A rapid and user-friendly web server,
known as CDRUG, is described here to predict the anticancer activity
of chemical compounds. In CDRUG, a hybrid score was developed to
measure the similarity of different compounds. The performance ana-
lysis shows that CDRUG has the area under curve of 0.878, indicating
that CDRUG is effective to distinguish active and inactive compounds.
Availability: The CDRUG web server and the standard-alone version
are freely available at http://bsb.kiz.ac.cn/CDRUG/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cancer causes millions of deaths per year. Screening candidates
from natural or synthetic compounds is an efﬁcient way for
cancer drug discovery (Shoemaker, 2006). In the past decades,
tens of millions of chemical compounds have been deposited in
the public database (Wang et al., 2012). Discovering anticancer
compounds from this huge database through experimental meth-
ods is expensive and time-consuming (Chabner and Roberts,
2005). Although the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has been
screening the anticancer compounds for tens of years, only 1%
(~70 000) compounds were tested for screening anticancer com-
pounds (Shoemaker, 2006). Therefore, a rapid and effectively
computational method is required for prediction of anticancer
activity of chemical compounds.

Here, we constructed a web server, termed Cancer Drug
(CDRUG), to predict the anticancer activity of given com-
pound(s). CDRUG uses a novel molecular description method
(relative frequency-weighted ﬁngerprint) to implement the com-
pound ‘ﬁngerprints’. Then, a hybrid score was calculated to
measure the similarity between the query and the active com-
pounds. Finally, a conﬁdence level (P-value) is calculated to pre-
dict whether the query compound(s) have, or do not have, the
activity of anticancer.

2 METHODS

To predict the anticancer activity of chemical compounds, we ﬁrst con-
structed a benchmark dataset, which contains two subsets, active and
inactive dataset. The active dataset consists of 8565 anticancer com-
pounds, whereas the inactive dataset includes 9804 compounds. All of
the datasets are from NCI—60 Developmental Therapeutics Program
(DTP) project (Shoemaker, 2006). The detailed method of constructing
benchmark dataset can be found in Part I of Supplementary Material.

Second, we used a novel molecular description method, termed as
relative frequency-weighted ﬁngerprint (RF W_FP), to calculate the com-
pound ‘ﬁngerprints’. RF W_FP was calculated as follows:

RFW_FP(i) = Bit(i) >< (—Fa°“ve(l)_)
Finactiveo)

where i represents ith Daylight pattern or ﬁngerprint. In Daylight theory,
each compound contains more than one and less than 1024 patterns or
ﬁngerprints. RFW_FP(1') is 1th relative frequency-weighted ﬁngerprint.
Bitﬁ) is calculated by Pybel (O’Boyle et al., 2008), a python wrapper of
Openbabel (O’Boyle et al., 2011); if the compound has ith ﬁngerprint,
Bitﬁ) = 1, else Bitﬁ) =0. Factiveﬁ) and Finactiveﬁ) are the frequency of
1th ﬁngerprint in the active and inactive compounds, respectively. at is the
amplifying factor. In this study, at was optimized as 4.0 (Supplementary
Fig. S2).

Third, the relative frequency-weighted Tanimoto coefﬁcient
(RF W_T C) between two compounds was calculated as follows:

Smn

(1)

where RF W_T C ( m,n ) is the relative frequency-weighted Tanimoto coef-
ﬁcient between two compounds (m and n). Sm and 5,, are the sum of
relative frequency-weighted ﬁngerprints in compound m and n, respect-
ively. Sm is the sum of the common relative frequency-weighted ﬁnger-
prints between two compounds.

Fourth, a hybrid score (HSCORE), based on both the RF W_T C and
the MinMax Kernel (KMM) (Swamidass et al., 2005), was calculated to
measure the similarity between two chemical compounds. H SCORE was
calculated as follows:

HSCORE(m,n) = RFW_TC(m,n) X KMM(m, n) (3)

where HSCORE(m,n) is the hybrid score between two compounds (m
and n). KMM(m,n) is the MinMax kernel (Swamidass et al., 2005) be-
tween two compounds and is calculated by jCompoundMapper
(Hinselmann et al., 2011), a Java API for molecular kernel theory
(Swamidass et al., 2005).

Finally, for each query chemical compounds, the maximum HSCORE
between the query and the active dataset (8565 compounds) was calcu-
lated. Then the P-value, based on the maximum HSCORE, was calcu-
lated. Because the maximum HSCORE is not >10, and because the

maximum HSCORE of the inactive compounds have a generalized
extreme value distribution (Supplementary Fig. S3), we can calculate
the P—value as follows:

P(X) = F(1.0; M, 0, S) — F(x; M, 0, S) (4)

where p(x) is the P—value at the maximum HSCORE of x; F ( x;u,a,$ ) is
the cumulative function of generalized extreme value distribution. Using
the maximum likelihood method (‘fgev’ function in R ‘evd’ package), we
estimated the location parameter u of 0.094, the scale parameter a of
0.063 and the shape parameter S of 0.302.

To implement the performance of CDRUG, 20 runs of 5-fold
cross-validation method (Part II in Supplementary Material) were used
to calculate the area under the curve (AUC). Four non-hybrid methods
(including Daylight Tanimoto coefﬁcient, RF W_T C, Tanimoto Kernel
and MinMax kernel) and six hybrid methods were used to test the per-
formance of the CDRUG (Part V of Supplementary Material).

3 DESCRIPTION OF CDRUG

CDRUG uses a novel weighted method (RF W_FP) to imple-
ment the molecular ﬁngerprints, and it then uses a hybrid
score to measure the compound similarity. The result shows
that CDRUG outperforms other methods (P<10_13, t-test)
(Fig. 1A and Supplementary Figs S4 and S5). When non-hybrid
methods were used, MinMax kernel obtained the best perform-
ance with the AUC of 0.865. But when the hybrid methods were
used, the AUC of CDRUG increased to 0.878. CDRUG can hit
~65% positive results at the false-positive rate of 0.05
(Supplementary Figs S4 and S5). These results indicated that
the CDRUG is effective to predict anticancer activity of the
chemical compounds.

CDRUG is rapid. It accepts one or more compounds to im-
plement a prediction. A query with 1—20 compounds requires
~35 s, whereas a query with 1000 compounds only requires
~4 min. Therefore, CDRUG can be applied to both case-study
and large-scale prediction.

CDRUG is user-friendly. The only requirement of CDRUG
is the SMILE(s) (\Neininger, 1988) of the query compound(s).

The result contains the query compound(s), the matched com-
pound(s), average G150 value of the matched compound(s), the
maximum HSCORE and the P—value. CDRUG also predicts
whether the query compound(s) have or do not have the activity
of anticancer. The results are categorized as highly possible, pos-
sible and less possible depending on the P—value, and they are
coloured by green, black and grey, respectively (Fig. 1B).

4 CONCLUSION

CDRUG web server provides an effective, rapid and
user-friendly interface to predict anticancer activity of chemical
compounds.

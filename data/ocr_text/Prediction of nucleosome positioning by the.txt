Abstract

Motivation: Nucleosome positioning plays important roles in many eukaryotic intranuclear
processes, such as transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure formation. The investigations of
nucleosome positioning rules provide a deeper understanding of these intracellular processes.
Results: Nucleosome positioning prediction was performed using a model consisting of 3 types of
variables characterizing a DNA sequence—the number of 5-nucleotide sequences, the number of 3-
nucleotide combinations in 1 period of a helix, and mono— and di-nucleotide distributions in DNA
fragments. Using recently proposed stringent benchmark datasets with low biases for
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster,
the present model was shown to have a better prediction performance than the recently proposed
predictors. This model was able to display the common and organism-dependent factors that affect
nucleosome forming and inhibiting sequences as well. Therefore, the predictors developed here can
accurately predict nucleosome positioning and help determine the key factors influencing this
process.

1 Introduction

Nucleosomes are the basic units of eukaryotic chromatin, and each
one is formed by 147 DNA base pair (bp) sequences wrapped tightly
around a histone octamer. The precise nucleosome formation and its
inhibitory effects on promoters (Tirosh et al., 2008; Choi et al., 2009;
Jiang et al., 2009), enhancers (McPherson et al., 1996; He et al., 2010;
Andreu—Vieyra et al., 2011; Maston et al., 2012), and insulators (Bi et al.,
2004; Takagi et al., 2012) play crucial roles in the precise regulation of
transcription (West et al., 2014). The precise nucleosome positioning

facilitates DNA replication, DNA repair, and RNA splicing (Yasuda et al.,
2005; Schwartz et al., 2009; Berbenetz et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2010;
Chen et al., 2014a). Therefore, the elucidation of nucleosome
positioning steps may allow an in—depth understanding of various
biological processes.

Recently, high—resolution genome—wide nucleosome maps were
obtained for several model organisms (Segal et al., 2006; Lee et al.,
2007, Schones et al., 2008, Mavrich et al., 2008a; Mavrich et al., 2008b).
In contrast to this, the determinant factors of the nucleosome
positioning remained unclear. However, with the increase in the
availability of high—quality experimental datasets, various computational

methods and tools for the prediction of nucleosome positioning were
proposed (reviewed in Teif, 2015), providing valuable insights and
allowing the mechanisms determining nucleosome positioning to be
unveiled. Furthermore, the construction of the accurate predictors can
lead to the possibility of the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) and gene mutation effects on this process.

Many of these predictors were constructed based on the information
about the frequencies and distributions of the combinations of
polynucleotide sequences as feature vectors (Segal et al., 2006;
loshikhes et al., 2006; Kaplan et al., 2009; Field et al., 2008; Peckham et
al., 2007; Ogawa et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012; Yi et al., 2012; Struhl et
al., 2013). Sequence—dependent mechanical properties, such as
sequence—dependent geometry and DNA fragment flexibility, were also
considered for the characterization of nucleosome forming and
inhibiting sequences (Goﬁi et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2008; Tolstorukov et
al., 2008; Nikolaou et al., 2010; Stolz et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2012a;
Guo et al., 2014, Freeman et al., 2014; lsami et al., 2015; Chen et al.,
2015; Tahir et al., 2016). Furthermore, a powerful web—server called Pse—
in—One (Liu et al., 2015a) was developed, where all existing feature
vectors for DNA/RNA and protein/peptide sequences can be generated
(see references cited in Chen et al., 2015), together with the generation
of the feature vectors for the sequences defined by users themselves.

For human (Homo sapiens), worm (Caenorhabditis elegans), and fly
(Drosophila melanogaster) genomes, Guo et aI. (Guo et al., 2014)
constructed the stringent benchmark datasets of nucleosome forming
and inhibiting sequences with low similarities, in order to examine the
performance of nucleosome position predictors. Additionally, predictors
iNuc—PseKNC and iNuc—PseSTNC (we call iNuc—Pse predictors) were
proposed, and they were shown to have better success rates in the
prediction of nucleosome positioning than any of the previously
developed predictors (Guo et al., 2014; Tahir et al., 2016). Furthermore,
for yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genomes, Chen et 0/. (Chen et al.,
2015) constructed a stringent benchmark dataset using the same
methodology as Guo et aI. (Guo et al., 2014), and predicted the
nucleosome positioning in yeast genome based on the deformation
energies of DNA fragments.

In order for iNuc—Pse predictors to show the best prediction
performance for nucleosome positioning in different organisms,
different sets of parameter values must be used (Guo et al., 2014; Tahir
et al., 2016). The sequence predicted as the nucleosome forming
sequence in one organism may be predicted as the nucleosome
inhibiting sequence in another organism. This shows that the function of
any given DNA sequence in assisting or inhibiting nucleosome formation
depends on the investigated organism. However, no key factors and
criteria affecting this process could be elucidated using this predictor,
because iNuc—Pse predictors are based on Support Vector Machine
(SVM). Additionally, based on these datasets, some common short motif
nucleosome forming and inhibiting sequences were found (Giancarlo et
al., 2015). However, the nucleosome positioning cannot be predicted
sufficiently well using only these motives.

In this study, a novel nucleosome positioning predictor was developed
based on the linear regression model, consisting of 3 types of variables
with different fragment length scales—the number of 5—nucleotide
sequences, the number of 3—nucleotide combinations in 1 period of
helix, and mono— and di—nucleotides distributions in whole DNA
fragments. This predictor exhibited better prediction performance than
the recently developed iNuc—Pse predictors for the same benchmark
datasets of human and fly genomes and displayed common and
organism—dependent key factors of nucleosome positioning explicitly.

A series of recent publications (Lin et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2014; Liu et
al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2015; Jia et al., 2015; Jia et al., 2016; Qiu et al.,
2016a) demonstrated, in compliance with Chou’s 5—step rule (Chou,
2011), that, in order to establish a useful sequence—based statistical
predictor for a biological system, the following five guidelines should be
observed: (a) how to construct or select a valid benchmark dataset to
train and test the predictor; (b) how to represent the biological
sequence samples by catching their key features associated with the
target to be predicted; (c) how to introduce or develop a powerful
algorithm to operate the prediction; (d) how to properly perform cross—
validation tests to objectively evaluate the anticipated accuracy; and (e)
how to establish a user—friendly web—server for the predictor that is
accessible to the public. Below, these steps are further explained.

2 MATERIAL AND METHODS

2.1 Benchmark datasets of nucleosome forming and inhibiting
sequences

The stringent benchmark datasets of nucleosome forming and
inhibiting sequences with low biases constructed by Guo et al. (Guo et
al., 2014) and Chen et 0/. (Chen et al., 2015) were used for the
evaluation of the performance of the proposed predictor. These
datasets involved human (H. sapiens: 2273 forming sequences and 2300
inhibiting sequences of 147 bp), worm (C. elegans: 2567 forming
sequences and 2608 inhibiting sequences of 147 bp), fly (D.
melanogaster: 2900 forming sequences and 2850 inhibiting sequences
of 147 bp) (Guo et al., 2014), and yeast (S. cerevisiae: 1880 forming
sequences and 1740 inhibiting sequences of 150 bp) (Chen et al., 2015).

In these datasets, none of the sequences has > 80% pairwise sequence
identity with any other sequence. Note that the benchmark datasets
used in previous studies were expected to contain many redundant,
highly similar sequences, and these biased datasets lacked statistical
representativeness (Chou, 2011), and the predictors may have yielded
misleading results if trained and tested using these biased datasets.
Therefore, only the low—biased datasets, proposed by Guo et al. (Guo et
al., 2014) and Chen et 0/. (Chen et al., 2015) were employed in this
study.

2.2 Model predicting nucleosome positioning 1: 3-length scales model

In order to predict whether a given 147—bp DNA sequence of human,
worm, and fly genomes is involved in the formation or the inhibition of
formation of nucleosome, the model included 3 types of variables: i) the
number of 5—nucleotide sequences, ii) the number of 3—nucleotide
combinations in one period of a double helix, and iii) mono— and di—
nucleotide distributions in DNA fragments. The model was named 3
length scales (3LS), and it belongs to a class of general PseKNC based
predictors (Guo et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015a).

The model is described by the following equations:

Qseq = 00 + M M(i | A or T) slsequ | A or T)
+ 2m D(i | Di—seq or Di—seq*) steq(i | Di—seq or Di—seq*) }
+ ZTriZo<j<k<11T(0, j, k, = 3—nuc or 0, k —j, k, = 3—nuc*)
x S3seq(0, j, k, = 3—nuc or 0, k —j, k, = 3—nuc*)
+ Zpent P(5—seq or 5—seq*) Ssseq(5—seq or 5—seq*), (1)

Slseq(i | A or T) = log2(N15eq( i | A or T) +1), (2)
steq(i’ | Di—seq or Di—seq*) = log2(N25eq(i’ | Di—seq or Di—seq* ) +1), (3)
S3seq(0, j, k, = 3—nuc or 0, k — j, k, = 3—nuc*)

= log2(N3seq(0, j, k, = 3—nuc or 0, k — j, k, = 3—nuc*) +1), (4)
and

112 [310'$11211an[plOJXO'SODBIIIJOJIIiOiQ/[Zdinq IIIOJJ papeolumoq

910K ‘09 isnﬁnV no :2

Ssseq(5—seq or 5—seq*) = log2(N55eq(5—seq or 5—seq*) +1). (5)

Here, O,seq is defined as a value of a given sequence, and when Q > O, =
0.5, this sequence was considered a nucleosome forming sequence,
while it was predicted as an inhibiting sequence otherwise. leeq, steq,
N3seq, and N5seq are defined as follows:

leeq(i | A or T) defines the number of adenine (A) or thymine (T)
nucleotides in i—th region of the given DNA sequence. Here, region 1
occupies the central 11 bp fragment of the given 147—bp DNA, the
regions for 1 < i < 8 occupy 2 10—bp fragments (20 bp) at (i—1)—th nearest
neighbor of first region, and 8—th region occupies the remaining 16—bp
fragment (Fig. 1(a)).

steq(i’ | Di—seq or Di—seq*) defines the sum of the number of each
type of successive dinucleotide sequence and its complementary
sequence, named Di—seq and Di—seq*, in the i’—th group of the
dinucleotide series of a given DNA sequence. Here, first group consists
of 10 dinucleotides at the central region of a given 146—dinucleotide
series, i’—th groups for 1 < i’ < 8 consist of 20 dinucleotides between
(5i(10x(i’—2)+1))—th to (5i10x(i’—1))—th dinucleotide from the center of a
given 146 dinucleotide series, and 8—th group contains the remaining 16
dinucleotides (Fig. 1(b)).

N3seq(0, j, k, = 3—nuc or 0, k — j, k, = 3—nuc*) defines the sum of the
number of each type of combination of 3—nucleotide set (3—nuc) that
consists of a nucleotide, the second nucleotide located downstream at
the distance j, and the third nucleotide located at the distance k in
downstream sequence (j < k), together with the number of the
complementary nucleotide combinations (3—nuc*) in the given DNA
sequence. Here, 5 < k <11 cases were considered.

Nsseq(5—seq or 5—seq*) defines the sum of the number of each type of
successive 5—nucleotide sequence (5—seq) and that of the
complementary sequence (5—seq*) in the given DNA sequence.

The coefficients M( ), D( ), T( ), and P( ) provide the weight of the
contributions of Slseq( ), steq( ), S3seq( ), and Ssseq( )to O,seq and Qo as a
constant value. They are organism—dependent values, which reveal the
common and organism—specific characteristics of nucleosome forming
and inhibiting sequences.

2.3 Variable selection in 3LS model

In order to obtain high prediction performances, the 3LS model should
contain only the appropriate variables of Slseq( ), steq( ), S3seq( ), and S
55eq( ). The coefficients M( ), D( ), T( ), and P( ) of the appropriate
variables should be given as finite values, while the values of redundant
variables should be given as zero. The appropriate variables were
chosen by the stepwise forward selection method (Efroymson, 1960).
Here, in order to avoid multicollinearity (Farrar et al., 1967), the
variance inflation factors of all chosen variables were kept below 10
(10.5 for fly genomes, since the prediction performance of the model
increased drastically in comparison with the case when 10.0 was used)
(O’brien, 2007). The model consists of the linear combination of Slseq( ),
525.4 ), $35.4 ), and $55.4 ), instead of that of leeq( ), steq( ), N3seq( ), and
Nsseq( ), since this allows a better prediction performance.

2.4 Model predicting nucleosome positioning 2: Tri-nucleotide
sequence model

For the prediction of nucleosome positioning, a simpler model than
3LS, named Tri—nucleotide sequence (TNS) model was introduced:

Qseq = Q0 +Zm R(3—seq or 3—seq*) NTseq(3—seq or 3—seq*),

where NTseq(3—seq or 3—seq*) is defined by the sum of the number of
each type of successive 3—nucleotide sequence and that of the
complementary sequence in a given DNA sequence. The coefficient R( )
provide the weight of the contributions of NTseq( )to O,seq and Q0 as a
constant value. This simple model allows a very high accuracy of the
nucleosome positioning prediction for yeast genome.

2.5 Evaluations of the quality of prediction

The prediction quality of the present model was evaluated using the
jackknife test (Lachenbruch et al., 1968) and Relative Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curve. These methods were generally employed for
the evaluation of the quality of several previously developed predictors
(Chen et al., 2012b; Chen et al., 2013; Chen and Li, 2013, Chou et al.,
2012; Esmaeili et al., 2010; Gupta et al., 2013; Mei, 2012, Mohabatkar
et al., 2012; Mohabatkar et al., 2013) and iNuc—Pse predictors (Guo et
al., 2014; Tahir et al., 2016).

Here, N“, N', N+-, and N3. were defined as the total number of
nucleosome forming sequences, nucleosome inhibiting sequences,
nucleosome forming sequences incorrectly predicted as nucleosome
inhibiting sequences, and nucleosome inhibiting sequences incorrectly
predicted as nucleosome forming sequences. Using the jackknife test,
the following metrics were obtained:

Sn = 1 — N+_/N+

Sp = 1 — N'+/N'

Acc = 1 — (N+_+ N3.)/(N+ + N')

we =11 — (Ni/N: + N'./N')}/{(1 + (N'. - N*-)/N*)(1 + (N*. - N'+)/N')}1’Z

where Sn, Sp, Acc, and MCC stand for sensitivity, specificity, accuracy,
and Mathew’s correlation coefficient, respectively. Note that Sn and (1 —
Sp) represent true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR),
respectively. The conventional formulations of the four metrics are not
quite intuitive and it may be difficult for many experimental scientists to
understand them, particularly MCC. Fortunately, the more intuitive
expressions, presented in this paper, can be derived using the symbols

112 /810's112umo[pJOJXO'sor112u1101urorq//2d11q 111011 papeolumoq

defined in a signal peptide study (Chou, 2001), and elaborated in other
studies (Chen et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013).

The ROC curve can be obtained as the trajectory of TPR—FPR two—
dimensional surface for the change in (1,. The area surrounded by TPR =
0, FPR = 0, and ROC curve, called AUROC, was used to estimate the
performances of predictors, where AUROC = 0.5 is equivalent to a
random prediction, and AUROC = 1 indicates perfect prediction.

Note that the following three cross—validation methods are often used
to examine the effectiveness of a predictor in practical applications:
independent dataset test, subsampling test, and jackknife test (Chou et
al., 1995). However, of the three, the jackknife test is deemed the least
arbitrary one (most objective) that can always yield a unique result for a
given benchmark dataset (Chou, 2011), and therefore, it has been
increasingly used for the investigations of the accuracy of various
predictors (e.g., Dehzangi et al., 2015; Kabir et al., 2016; and references
cited in Chou, 2011). Accordingly, the jackknife test was also adopted
here for the examination of the quality of the present predictor.

2.6 Construction of nucleosome positioning predictor

Based on the 3LS and TNS models, the nucleosome positioning
predictors for each organism were constructed. The predictors for
human, worm, and fly genomes were assumed to consist of the
appropriately chosen variables. The coefficients of these chosen
variables were determined by the multiple regression analysis, using
benchmark datasets for each organism, and the explanatory variables
were given by the chosen Slseq( ), steq( ), S3seq( ), and Ssseq( ) for 3LS
model, and NTseq( ) for TNS model, and the objective variables were
given as 1 for nucleosome forming sequences and 0 otherwise.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Variable selection for 3LS model using human, worm, and fly
sequences

Variables Slseq( ), steq( ), S3seq( ), and Ssseq( ), involved in the
construction of the nucleosome positioning predictors in 3LS model
were chosen by stepwise forward selection method. Here, 403, 392, and
325 variables were chosen for human, worm, and fly genomes,
respectively (Supplementary Table 51).

3.2 Prediction quality for human, worm, and fly genomes

Using the jackknife cross—validation tests, Sn, Sp, ACC, and MCC of 3LS
model based predictor were evaluated for human, worm, and fly
genome benchmark datasets (Table 1). The obtained ACCs of the
investigated predictor for these datasets (z 0.9001, z 0.8786, and z

0.8341, respectively) were shown to be higher than those obtained by
iNuc—PseKNC (Guo et al., 2014) for all organisms, and higher than those
obtained by iNuc—PseSTNC (Tahir et al., 2016) for human and fly
genomes. The higher AUROC values were obtained as well (z 0.9588, z
0.9505, and z 0.9147 for human, worm, and fly datasets, respectively),
compared with those obtained by iNuc—PseKNC (z 0.925, z 0.935, and z
0.874) (Guo et al., 2014) (Fig. 2). Thus, we expected that 3LS model—
based predictor with appropriate coefficients (Supplementary Table
SZ(a)) can predict the nucleosome positioning more accurately than the
recent iNuc—Pse predictors for human and fly genomes.

3.3 TNS model for yeast genome

The quality of TNS model—based predictor was expected to be lower
than that of 3LS model based. ACCs of TNS model were shown to be z
0.8167, z 0.8394, and z 0.7082 for human, worm, and fly genomes,
respectively. However, TNS model based predictor exhibited perfect
nucleosome positioning prediction (ACC = 1.0) for the benchmark yeast
genome dataset, presented in Chen et 0]. (Chen et al., 2015). For the
same benchmark dataset, the predictor based on DNA deformation
energy (Chen et al., 2015) had ACC of z 0.981. Moreover, we confirmed
that the predictor based on the nearest neighbor algorithm (Yi et al.,
2012) had ACC of z 0.9906 for the same benchmark dataset. These
predictors can perform sufficiently well in predicting nucleosome
positioning for yeast genome. However, we expected that TNS model—
based predictor with appropriate coefficients (Supplementary Table
SZ(b)) is able to predict the nucleosome positioning more precisely than
these recent predictors.

4 DISCUSSION

3LS model—based predictor can predict nucleosome positioning in
human and fly genomes more accurately than the recently proposed
nucleosome position predictors can. Additionally, the predictor defined
here can display the details of organism—dependent key factors for the
determination of nucleosome forming and inhibiting sequences.

The chosen Slseq( ), steq( ), S3seq( ), and Ssseq( ) in 3LS model differed
greatly between human, worm, and fly genomes (Supplementary Table
51). This indicates there are many organism—dependent differences in
the features contributing to the nucleosome formation. The coefficients
of these variables, M( ), D( ), T( ), and P( ), and constant value Q0,

obtained by multiple regression analysis, clearly showed organism—
dependent specificities (Supplementary Table 52). These differences are
presented in the following examples:
I) In 3LS models of these genomes that contained common variables,
their coefficients’ signs often differed between the organisms.
II) There were only 6 variables with the same signs of their coefficients
between these organisms, and these were:
T(0, 1, 6, = CTT or 0, 5, 6, = AAG) > 0,
T(0, 1, 10, = 'I'I'G or 0, 9, 10, = CAA) > 0,
P(‘I'I'TI'T or AAAAA) < 0,
P(GC'I'I'C or GAAGC) > 0,
P(GTGTC or GACAC) > 0, and
P(GGATC or GATCC) >0

Poly(dA—dT) sequences, such as AAAAA sequence, are known as
physically rigid sequences (Nelson et al., 1987; Brunkner et al., 1995;
Packer et al., 2000). Therefore, the sequences containing these motives
inhibit the nucleosome formation in the genomes of several organisms,
which was confirmed by experimental evidence and the use of different
nucleosome positioning predictors (Kunkel et al., 1981; Bi et al., 2004; Yi
et al., 2012; Giancarlo et al., 2015), which is consistent with the results
presented here. The sequences with high GC content were reported to
have a nucleosome—forming tendency (Tillo et al., 2009). However,
considering the results of the recent studies, 30—50% nucleotides found
in the nucleosome forming sequences are A or T nucleotides located at
the appropriate positions (Satchwell et al., 1986; Ohyama 2001;
loshikhes et al., 2006; Segal et al., 2006; Ogawa et al., 2010; Giancarlo et
al., 2015), which seems to agree with the results obtained in this study.
III) When only the 6 variables described above were chosen in 3LS
model based predictor, ACCs for human, worm, and fly genomes were
ACC z 0.7525, z 0.7716, and 0.6438, respectively, which is much lower
than the values obtained using the model with suitable variables.
However, even when these variables were removed from the 3LS model
based predictor with suitable variables, the decrease in ACCs for human,
worm, and fly genomes was not considerable, and the obtained ACC
values were z 0.8974, z 0.8730, and z 0.8290, respectively. This
indicates that the organism—specific sequence patterns dominantly
contribute to the determination of nucleosome forming abilities.
IV) The weight of the contribution of the set S3seq (0, j, k, = 3—nuc or 0, k —
j, k, = 3—nuc*) for each k is defined as Wk= [Number of chosen S3seq (0, j,
k, = 3—nuc or 0, k — j, k, = 3—nuc*)]/[Number of chosen variables] (Table 2).
The obtained Wk values were different for different organisms, for
example W5 ~ 0.074, 0.112, 0.080 (k = 5 as the smallest k) and W10 ~
0.159, 0.115, 0.151 (k = 10 as the largest k) were obtained for human,
worm, and fly genomes, respectively. This indicates that the length scale
of nucleotide combinations required for the characterization of
nucleosome forming sequences depends on the organism analyzed.
V) The weight of the contribution of the set steq (i’ | Di—seq or Di—seq*)
near and far from the center of sequence (dyad position) was defined as
Wnear= [Number of chosen steq(i’ =1 ~ 5| Di—seq or Di—seq*)]/[Number of
chosen variables] and Wm: [Number of chosen steq(i’ =6 ~ 8| Di—seq or
Di—seq*)]/[Number of chosen variables] (Table 2). Wnear values were
similar values in the datasets for the 3 investigated organisms. The
values of Wfar, z 0.027, 0.015, and 0.006, were obtained for human,
worm, and fly genomes, respectively, where Wfa, for fly was shown to be
~1/2 of that for worm and ~1/4 for human. This suggests that the
contribution of the sequences far from the dyad position to the
nucleosome formation depends on the organism type.

Using the TNS model—based predictor, the obtained ACC values of
nucleosome position predictions for human, worm, and fly genomes

were much lower than those obtained using 3LS model—based predictor.
while ACC = 1 was obtained for yeast genome. This clearly demonstrates
organism—dependent characteristics of nucleosome forming and
inhibiting sequences, showing that the nucleosome positioning is much
more easily predicted in yeast than in higher organisms.

Table 2. Weights of the contributions of S3seq (0, j, k, = 3—nuc or 0, k — j,
k, = 3—nuc*) for each k (Wk) and 525..., (i’ | Di—seq or Di—seq*) for the
positions near and far from the dyad position (Wnear and Wear).

The predictors developed here can predict nucleosome positioning in
human, fly, and yeast genomes with higher accuracy than the recently
proposed predictors and can determine the key factors influencing this
positioning in human, worm, fly, and yeast genomes. In contrast to the
recently proposed iNuc—Pse predictors, 3LS model—based predictor
developed in this study is based on the following sequence properties as
well: i) Combinations of nucleotides located further away than those
considered by iNuc—Pse predictors; ii) More detailed distributions of A, T,
and dinucleotide sequences in a DNA fragment than those in iNuc—Pse
predictors. These properties most likely contribute to the exhibited
improved performance of the predictor proposed here in comparison
with the iNuc—Pse predictors.

However, the variable selections and the formalization of the model
can be improved, and further modifications are needed for this
predictor to perform better than the recent ones. Recent studies
suggested that sequence—dependent geometry and flexibility of each
DNA fragment may play important roles in the determination of its
nucleosome forming ability (Goﬁi et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2008;
Tolstorukov et al., 2008; Nikolaou et al., 2010; Stolz et al., 2010; Chen et
al., 2012a; Guo et al., 2014, Freeman et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015;
lsami et al., 2015). Furthermore, the nucleosome forming ability of each
sequence may change with intracellular and environmental conditions
(McPherson et al., 1996; He et al., 2010; Andreu—Vieyra et al., 2011;
Maston et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012; Struhl et al., 2013). Because of
this, the predictors should be modified in the future by considering
these physical and chemical influences.

Additionally, as demonstrated in a series of recent publications (e.g.,
Chen et al., 2014b; Lin et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015b;
Chen, et al., 2016; Qiu et al., 2016b), during the development of new
prediction methods, user—friendly and publicly accessible web—servers
can significantly enhance the impacts of these tools (Chou, 2015).
Therefore, the future efforts will include providing a web—server for the
use of the prediction method presented here.

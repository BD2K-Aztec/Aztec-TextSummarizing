ABSTRACT

Motivation: X-ray crystallography-based protein structure
determination, which accounts for majority of solved structures, is
characterized by relatively low success rates. One solution is to
build tools which support selection of targets that are more likely
to crystallize. Several in silico methods that predict propensity of
diffraction-quality crystallization from protein chains were developed.
We show that the quality of their predictions drops when applied
to more recent crystallization trails, which calls for new solutions.
We propose a novel approach that alleviates drawbacks of the
existing methods by using a recent dataset and improved protocol
to annotate progress along the crystallization process, by predicting
the success of the entire process and steps which result in the
failed attempts, and by utilizing a compact and comprehensive set
of sequence-derived inputs to generate accurate predictions.
Results: The proposed PPCpred (predictor of protein Production,
Purification and Crystallization) predict propensity for production of
diffraction-quality crystals, production of crystals, purification and
production of the protein material. PPCpred utilizes comprehensive
set of inputs based on energy and hydrophobicity indices,
composition of certain amino acid types, predicted disorder,
secondary structure and solvent accessibility, and content of certain
buried and exposed residues. Our method significantly outperforms
alignment-based predictions and several modern crystallization
propensity predictors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves show that PPCpred is particularly useful for users who
desire high true positive (TP) rates, i.e. low rate of mispredictions
for solvable chains. Our model reveals several intuitive factors
that influence the success of individual steps and the entire
crystallization process, including the content of Cys, buried His and
Ser, hydrophobic/hydrophilic segments and the number of predicted
disordered segments.

1 INTRODUCTION

Structural genomics (SG) is an international initiative that aims
at solving 3D shapes of important biological macro—molecules,
primarily focusing on proteins, and which signiﬁcantly contributes
to the overall protein structure determination efforts (Chandonia and
Brenner, 2006). This initiative shifts the focus from one—by—one
determination of individual protein structures to protein family—
directed structure analyses where a group of proteins is targeted and
structure(s) of representative members are determined (Terwilliger

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

et al., 1998). The process of choosing the representative proteins,
which is known as target selection, encompasses restricting the
candidate proteins to those that are tractable and of unknown
structure and prioritizing them according to the expected interest
and accessibility (Brenner, 2000). For instance, in case of the
protein structure initiative (PSI), target selection concentrates on
representatives from large, structurally uncharacterized protein
domain families, and from structurally uncharacterized subfamilies
in very large and diverse families with incomplete structural
coverage (Dessailly et al., 2009). The most recent PSI:Biology phase
(PSI—Nature Structural Biology Knowledgebase, 2011), includes
four major SG centers that will continue high—throughput structure
determination deﬁned through community nomination process.
Importantly, these approaches allow for ﬂexibility in the selection of
the targets and would beneﬁt from tools that support target selection.
Protein structures are solved using X—ray crystallography, NMR
spectroscopy, electron microscopy and (recently) by application of
computational approaches, such as homology modeling. The most
popular method, which accounts for about 87% of the structures
deposited into the Protein Data Bank (PDB), is the X—ray
crystallography (Berman et al., 2000). One of the main challenges
the SG faces is that only about 2—10% of protein targets pursued
yield high—resolution protein structures (Service, 2005). A more
recent analysis shows that about 4.6% of targets produce the
diffraction—quality crystals (Kurgan and Mizianty, 2009). Moreover,
estimates show that >60% of the cost of structure determination
is consumed by the failed attempts (Slabinski et al., 2007a), while
crystallization is characterized by a signiﬁcant rate of attrition and
is among the most complex and the least understood problems
in the structural biology (Hui and Edwards, 2003). This provides
motivation for further research in this area. Several strategies have
been proposed to improve the success rates including obtaining
one representative structure per protein family and working with
multiple orthologs (Brenner, 2000; Chandonia and Brenner, 2005;
Hui and Edwards, 2003). In spite of the advances made in the
context of protein crystallization (McPherson, 2004), the production
of high—quality crystals is one of the major bottlenecks in the
structure determination pipelines (Biertumpfel et al., 2005; Chayen,
2004; Puesy et al., 2005). This problem is usually tackled using
an empirical trial and error approach, where a large number
of experiments is brute—forced to ﬁnd a suitable setup, and
through understanding of the fundamental principles that govern
crystallization (Chayen, 2004). The latter is used to design new and
improved methodologies that produce the high—quality crystals.
One of the steps taken to alleviate difﬁculties in solving the
structures via the X—ray crystallography was to create databases that
record information concerning both successful and failed attempts
to produce the structures (Rodrigues and Hubbard, 2003). The
largest and most comprehensive database, TargetDB (Chen et al.,

Crystallization propensity prediction

 

2004), which was launched July 2001, builds upon the work on the
PRESAGE database (Brenner et al., 1999). TargetDB consolidates
data from 28 SG centers in USA, Canada, Germany, Isreal,
Japan, France and UK, including nine PSI centers. The PepcDB
(Protein Expression Puriﬁcation and Crystallization DataBase) was
established around 2004 as an extension to the TargetDB to collect
more detailed status information and experimental details for each
step in the protein structure production pipelines (Kouranov et al.,
2006). This database stores a complete history of the status of the
experimental steps in each production trial, the current status and
stop conditions, which are collected from 15 SG centers in USA.

The availability of the databases motivated the development of
analytical and predictive models that either support or directly
predict protein crystallization (Rupp and Wang, 2004). Initial work
concentrated on ﬁnding sequence—derived factors that are useful to
determine crystallization propensity. For instance, using the data
from the TargetDB, Goh et al. (2004) found that conservation of
the sequence across organisms, composition of charged residues,
occurrence of hydrophobic patches in the sequence, number of
binding partners and chain length inﬂuence the feasibility for
the high—throughput structure determination. The isoelectric point
calculated from the sequence was used to suggests optimal pH ranges
for the crystallization screening (Kantardjieff and Rupp, 2004;
Kantardjieff et al., 2004). The Berkeley’s SG center utilized several
protein features including chain length and predicted transmembrane
helices, coiled coils and low—complexity regions to eliminate the
intractable targets (Chandonia et al., 2006). Arecent study shows that
the crystallization propensity can be computed from the knowledge
of predicted disordered residues, side—chain entropy of predicted
exposed residues and the amount of Phe and predicted buried Gly in
the input sequence (Price et al., 2009). These works demonstrate that
the crystallization propensity can be successfully predicted from the
protein chain. However, these studies usually concern data from a
single SG center, and propose simple predictive models (that could
be outperformed by more advanced models) that are rarely made
available, e. g. via web servers, to the community.

To this end, several computational sequence—based crystallization
propensity predictors which utilize the data that span multiple SG
centers and more advanced predictive models were proposed in the
recent years. They include SECRET (Smialowski et al., 2006), OB—
Score (Overton and Barton, 2006), CRYSTALP (Chen et al., 2007),
XtalPred (Slabinski et al., 2007a, b), ParCrys (Overton et al., 2008),
CRYSTALP2 (Kurgan et al., 2009), MetaPPCP (Mizianty and
Kurgan, 2009), PXS (Price et al., 2009), SVMCrys (Kandaswamy
et al., 2010) and MCSG—Z score (Babnigg and Joachimiak, 2010).
Some of them, including the OB—score and XtalPred, were already
used by the SG centers. Details concerning these methods can be
found in a recent review (Kurgan and Mizianty, 2009). The above
predictors have a few drawbacks, which motivate this work. They
are built and tested using outdated data, which results in a relatively
poor performance for recent data (we demonstrate that in Fig. 2
in Section 3), the annotation of the chains used in their training
database (crystallizable versus crystallization resistant) is based on
an incomplete/inaccurate protocol, and they address the prediction
of the success of the entire crystallization process without pointing
out which of the steps is responsible for the failure. Our objective is
to alleviate these drawbacks by proposing a novel predictor that (i) is
built using a recent and large dataset, (ii) uses improved annotation
protocol, (iii) targets prediction of the success of the entire

crystallization process and also predicts which of the steps results
in the failed attempts and (iv) uses a compact and comprehensive
range of sequence—derived inputs to generate accurate predictions. In
collaboration with the TargetDB and PepcDB curators, we formulate
a more precise and comprehensive protocol to annotate proteins.
Also, our method can be used to predict propensity of a given
chain for (i) production of diffraction quality crystals, (ii) production
of crystals, (iii) puriﬁcation and (iv) production of the protein
material; the existing methods target only one of these outcomes. The
proposed method, called PPCpred (predictor of protein Production,
Puriﬁcation and Crystallization) provides individual predictions for
each the four steps, and it also provides an integrated output that
predicts whether the chain would produce the diffraction quality
crystals, and if not then it predicts which of the steps is most likely
to cause the failure.

2 METHODS

2.1 Current annotation protocols

The existing sequence—based crystallization propensity predictors assign one
of the two labels, crystallizable or non—crystallizable, to each protein chain.
The only exception is the XtalPred which deﬁnes ﬁve classes that range
between ‘easy to crystallize’ and ‘hard to crystallize’. However, the ﬁve
classes are equivalent to the probabilities/scores generated by the other
methods. The annotations used in SECRET are primarily based on the data
from the PDB and they were improved by the subsequent works. Most
of the subsequent predictors, including CRYSTALP, OB—Score, ParCrys,
CRYSTALP2, MetaPPCP and SVMCrys, utilize data extracted from PepcDB
and TargetDB databases using approach described in Overton and Barton
(2006) to annotate proteins as crystallizable and non—crystallizable and to
derive their training and test datasets. As it was pointed out in Overton and
Barton (2006), this annotation protocol has a few shortcomings. The authors
of XtalPred use a different approach in terms of how the crystallizable
samples were extracted. In XtalPred (Slabinski et al., 2007b) only trials
deposited in PDB were marked as the crystallizable trials, whereas in Overton
et al. (2008) those trials were excluded. The two remaining predictors use
data from only one SG center; PXS is based on data from the Northeast SG
Consortium and MCSG—Z score from the Midwest Center for SG.

Our aim is to deliver more comprehensive and precise annotations of
the crystallization propensity (and the other steps in the crystallization
process). First, we consider only the proteins with the known outcome of the
experiment, i.e. completed stop status, as opposed to the previous approaches
in which the experiment was considered as ﬁnished if there was no update
for the speciﬁc amount of time or it was annotated as work stopped. We note
that there are instances where work on a given target was discontinued for
unspeciﬁed reasons, not necessarily related to the crystallization protocol,
e. g. the targets were re—prioritized and administratively abandoned. This is
often done without evaluating/reporting the success or failure at the trial
level, and thus it is difﬁcult to associate an interpretation to an unqualiﬁed
‘work—stopped’ status. Although the authors of Overton and Barton (2006)
were aware of this, a small number of trials with the completed stop status at
the time when they developed their method did not allow them to utilize
a more accurate annotation protocol. Secondly, we ﬁlter our dataset to
further improve the quality of annotations for the selected samples; details
are explained in Section 2.2. Thirdly, we divide the chains annotated as
the non—crystallizable to indicate the reason for the crystallization failure.
We hypothesize that success/failure in each of the crystallization process
steps may be associated with different protein properties. Fourthly, previous
methods used the training and test datasets with substantially reduced
sequence similarity (<25%). This removes hard to predict samples, as
sometimes even relatively minor changes in the protein sequence (e. g. point
mutations and usage of C— and N—terminus tag to ease puriﬁcation) may

change the ﬁnal outcome of the crystallization. In contrast, we remove similar
sequences only within each class (e. g. similar crystallizable chains), but we
do not reduce the sequence similarity between the classes (e. g. between
crystallizable and non—crystallizable chains). Finally, we use new data (from
between 2006 and 2009) to address recent changes in the crystallization
protocols; the prior predictors were built on older data from before 2006.

2.2 Annotations and datasets

The protein chains were extracted from the PepcDB (Kouranov et al.,
2006). We used PepcDB downloaded on November 17, 2010, which includes
261 572 targets. A target deﬁnes the objective of the crystallization attempt
for either a single protein or a collection of proteins. Targets in PepcDB can
have either one or multiple trials, each trial representing a set of procedures
used to crystallize a target. There are 817 099 trials in our PepcDB dataset.
Each trial has information about its current status and, in case if work was
ﬁnished, the stop status, see Table 1. The stop statuses indicate the step at
which the work on a given trial was stopped and the reason of the failure
(which divides the work covered in the current status into substeps) or the fact
that the trial produced a proper outcome. The majority of trials have the stop
status ﬁeld empty, which makes it impossible to deduct the ﬁnal outcome of
the trial; we cannot be sure whether the experiment was ﬁnished, abandon or
is still in progress. Therefore, we selected trials with the completed stop status
ﬁeld, with the exception for trials with the current status ‘in PDB’ or ‘crystal
structure’, as they clearly indicate the successful crystallization attempts.
Since each trial may concern more than one sequence, we considered each
sequence from each trial as a separate trial.

For the set of the non—crystallizable proteins (NCDB), we considered
45 924 trials with the completed stop status ﬁeld, which includes any of
the following: ‘sequencing failed’, ‘cloning failed’, ‘expression failed’,
‘puriﬁcation failed’, ‘crystallization failed’ or ‘poor diffraction’.

The set of the crystallizable protein (CDB) was developed using 15 412
trials with the stop status equal to ‘structure successful’, ‘TargetDB duplicate
target found’ or ‘PDB duplicate found’ and the trials with the current status
‘crystal structure’ or ‘in PDB’.

We did not use trials corresponding to the NMR structures and we
disregarded the trials with the ‘other’ or ‘duplicate target found’ stop status.

We ﬁltered both sets to remove the trials with duplicate sequences, i.e.
so far we collected all trials with the complete stop (or current) status
irrespective of the sequence. Given two trials with the same sequence, we
removed the trial with an earlier stop status (Table 1), e.g. given two trials
with the same sequence marked with ‘sequencing failed’ and ‘puriﬁcation
failed’ stop statuses, we removed the former one since another attempt has
succeeded with the sequencing step for the same chain. In case of two trials
with the same stop status, we removed the older trial.

Next, we ﬁltered all chains in the NCDB set against the CDB set and the
chains in the PDB, i.e. we remove a given chain from the NCDB set in case
if this sequence occurs in the CDB set or in the PDB.

In the next step, we ﬁltered the chains in the NCDB set against all trials
in the PepcDB based on their current status ﬁeld. We removed each non—
crystallizable trial for which there is a trial with the same sequence and the
current status further along the crystallization process (Table 1). In this case,
the current status indicates that the trial succeeded with the step (stop status)
which was used to enter it into the NCDB set.

Next, we removed all trials from before January 1, 2006 and after
December 31, 2009. We removed the older samples to accommodate for the
latest advances in the crystallization protocols. For example, our analysis of
the PepcDB shows that before 2006, i.e. in the ﬁrst PSI phase, a large number
of failures corresponded to problems with cloning, whereas after 2005 the
problems with cloning subsided. The samples from 2010 could not be used
since some of them may not be yet completed or updated in the database.

We assigned the following classes to the remaining trials: (i) production
of the protein material failed (MF) (for all trials with stop status ‘sequencing
failed’, ‘cloning failed’ and ‘expression failed’); (ii) puriﬁcation failed (PF)
(for the ‘puriﬁcation failed’ stop status); (iii) crystallization failed (CF) (for

The statuses are sorted top-down from steps earlier to further in the crystallization
procedure. The current status indicates the current, rather than the completed activity,
e.g. for the ‘cloning failed’ stop status, the current status ‘cloned’ does not mean
that cloning was successful, but if the current status is ‘expressed’ then cloning can
be assumed successful. We disregarded ‘other’, ‘poor NMR’, ‘mass spec failed’ and
‘duplicate target found’ stop statuses and ‘other’, ‘test target’, ‘work stopped’, ‘selected’,
‘mass spec veriﬁed’, ‘NMR assigned’, ‘HSQC’, ‘NMR structure’ current statuses.

the ‘crystallization failed’ and ‘poor diffraction’); and (iv) CRYStallizable
(CRYS) (for the stop statuses ‘structure successful’, ‘TargetDB duplicate
target found’ and ‘PDB duplicate found’; or the current statuses ‘crystal
structure’ and ‘in PDB’).

Finally, using BLASTCLUST we reduced the sequence identity among
chains within the same class, i.e. for each class we kept only the sequences
below 25% sequence identity threshold. This is consistent with the threshold
used in the prior studies (Overton and Barton, 2006), but we did not reduce
the sequence identity between trials from different classes.

We created three datasets to build predictors for each of the non—
crystallizable classes (MF, PF and CF). Each of these datasets includes trials
which failed to proceed through a given step (as the samples in the negative
set), and trails which passed this step (as the positive set). In the dataset
for the prediction of the production of the protein material (DB_MF), the
negative set contains all trials labeled as MF and the positive set contains
the remaining proteins; for the puriﬁcation dataset (DB_PF), the negative
set contains trials marked as PF and the positive set includes trails from the
CF and CRYS classes; for the crystallization dataset (DB_CF), the negative
set contains trials with the CF class, and the positive set includes trials from
the CRYS class. For the DB_PF and DB_CF datasets, we did not include
trials from the MF, and the MF and PF classes, respectively, due to the fact
that we do not known whether these trials would pass the puriﬁcation or
crystallization steps since they did not pass the previous steps, e.g. we do
not know whether the MF trials would purify if they pass the production
of the protein material step. We also created the DB_CRYS dataset with
the class labels similar with the previous predictors, which indicate the
success of the entire process, i.e. production of the diffraction—quality
crystals. The DB_CRYS dataset includes two labels, non—crystallizable
chains (MF, PF and CF) versus crystallizable chains (CRYS). The chains in

the DB_CRYS dataset were annotated with the four class labels, i.e. the non—
crystallizable chains were annotated as MF, PF or CF, to create the DB_4CL
dataset. The number of trials in each dataset is shown in Supplementary
Table 1.

We randomly divided the MF, PF, CF and CRYS sets into two equal sized
subsets, the training and the test sets. We used the training subsets to create the
corresponding training DB_MF, DB_PF, DB_CF and DB_CRYS datasets,
and the tests subsets to create the independent test datasets. We designed
our predictor based on the training datasets (using 5—fold cross—validation
protocol) and then we performed evaluation and comparison with the existing
methods on the independent test datasets. We note that the sequence identity
between chains from the same class in the training and test sets is <25%.

2.3 Architecture of the proposed predictor

The prediction is performed in two steps: (i) the input sequences are
converted into a set of numerical features that describe certain, relevant
characteristics of the protein chain; and (ii) the feature values are fed
into four predictive models that output the predicted propensity for
material production, puriﬁcation, crystallization and diffraction quality
crystallization, respectively; we use a support vector machine (SVM), which
was previously shown to provide high—quality predictions in this area
(Kandaswamy et al., 2010; Smialowski et al. 2006), to implement these
four models and their outputs are aggregated together to provide a four—class
prediction. The architecture of the PPCpred method is shown in Figure 1.

2.3.] Quality measures and evaluation protocols The assessment of the
predictions uses the same criteria that were used to evaluate prior work
in this area (Chen et al., 2007; Kandaswamy et al., 2010; Kurgan et al.,
2009; Mizianty and Kurgan, 2009; Overton and Barton, 2006; Overton et al.,
2008; Slabinski et al., 2007b; Smialowski et al., 2006). The evaluation was
performed per—protein at two levels: (i) the binary values that deﬁne whether
a given trial/sequence is positive (passes a given step) or negative (fails
to pass the step) are evaluated using the Matthews correlation coefﬁcient
(MCC), accuracy (ACC), Sensitivity and Speciﬁcity measures; and (ii) the
real values that quantify the probability of prediction which corresponds to
the propensity of the chain to pass the test, i.e. to produce the protein material,
to purify, and to produce crystals, are evaluated with the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) measures.
Detailed explanation of the above—mentioned quality measures is given in
the Supplementary Material. The aggregated predictions of four classes are
assessed based on the overall accuracy (number of correctly predicted trials
over all trials) and mean MCC (over the four MCC values computed for each
class label).

We analyze statistical signiﬁcance of the differences between PPCpred
and the other methods. For each test set, we compared 100 paired results
for MCC and ACC obtained using the bootstrapping with 25% of randomly
selected trials. Since the measurements follow normal distribution, as tested

using Shapiro—Wilk test at the 0.05 signiﬁcance, we use paired t—test and we
measure signiﬁcance of the differences at the 0.01 level.

We designed the proposed predictor, which includes ﬁltration of the
considered features, parameterization of the SVM—based classiﬁers, feature
selection and selection of the thresholds for the aggregation of the four
predictors (which are described below), using 5—fold cross—validation on the
training datasets. In this test, we randomly divide the training dataset into
ﬁve equal—sized subsets of protein chains. We use four of these subsets to
form a training fold that is utilized to compute the model and the ﬁfth subset
constitutes the testing fold that is used to perform the evaluation. This is
repeated ﬁve times, each time choosing a different subset to be the test fold.
The tests on the independent test datasets was performed using the model
trained on the corresponding training dataset using the parameters and feature
sets that were established based on the cross—validation.

2.3.2 Features Our method considers a comprehensive set of features
generated using several information sources including the sequence and
the sequence—derived isoelectric point, the encoding of amino acids in
the sequence with several property—based indices (e.g. hydrophobicity
and energy) from the AAIndex database (Kawashima et al., 2008),
solvent accessibility predicted using Real—SPINE3 (Faraggi et al., 2009),
disorder predicted using DISOPRED2 (Ward et al., 2004), and secondary
structure predicted with PSIPRED 3.2 (Jones, 1999). The importance
of the information derived directly from the protein chain, including
the composition of certain amino acids, the isoelectric point, etc., for
prediction of the crystallization success was demonstrated in numerous
studies (Chandonia et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007; Goh et al., 2004;
Kandaswamy et al., 2010; Kantardjieff and Rupp, 2004; Kantardjieff et al.,
2004; Kurgan et al., 2009; Overton and Barton, 2006; Overton et al., 2008;
Price et al., 2009; Slabinski et al., 2007b; Smialowski et al., 2006). The usage
of the energy and hydrophobicity of the constituent residues is motivated by
the work in (Babnigg and Joachimiak, 2010; Chen et al., 2007; Goh et al.,
2004; Kandaswamy et al., 2010; Kurgan et al., 2009; Overton and Barton,
2006; Overton et al., 2008; Price et al., 2009). The predicted secondary
structure, disorder and solvent accessibility were found to be useful to predict
propensity of the crystallization in (Chandonia et al., 2006; Kandaswamy
et al., 2010; Mizianty and Kurgan, 2009; Price et al., 2009; Slabinski et al.,
2007a, b). We note that we also use the above information to predict the
propensity of the material production and puriﬁcation, which is one of the
novel aspects of this study. We considered 64 hydrophobicity— and energy—
based indices from the AAIndexl database, see Supplementary Table 2, and
the side—chain entropy (Creamer, 2000) that was found useful in (Price et al.,
2009); we disregarded amino acid indices related to the solvent accessibility
and secondary structure, as we already include these predictions.

We combine information based on the amino acids indices, predicted
secondary structure and disorder with the predicted solvent accessibility
by computing the values separately for the exposed and buried residues;
we deﬁne buried residues as the residues for which the predicted relative

solvent accessibility is <25%; otherwise a given residue is assumed to be
solvent exposed. In total, we generated 828 features, which include:

- AA_{AA,-} Composition of the 20 standard amino acid (AA) types, i.e.
the count divided by the sequence length, where AA,- stands for one of
20 AAs (20 features).

0 AA_{exp,bur}_{AA,-} Composition of the exposed/buried AAs (count
of the exposed/buried AA,- divided by the number of all exposed/buried
residues in a given chain) (40 features).

- p] The isoelectric point (1 feature).

0 {AAIndex} The average value of a given amino acids index AAIndex
over the whole sequence (65 features).

0 {AAIndex}_{min,max}_{5,10,15,20} The minimal/maximal average
value of the amino acid index AAIndex among all sliding windows
of sizes 5, 10, 15 and 20. For chains shorter than a given window
size, we use the window size equal the length of the sequence. These
features are motivated by the work in (Babnigg and J oachimiak, 2010)
(65 x 4 x 2 = 520 features).

For segments with at least 1 residue, these features represent content
of the exposed/buried residues. We note that there were no predicted

exposed segments with over 15 residues, and thus the corresponding
two features were removed (8 features).

2.3.3 Filtration of the considered features We note that some of the
considered features may be correlated with each other and may not be useful
to differentiate between the considered class labels (i.e. the annotation of
the protein production, puriﬁcation, crystallization and diffraction—quality
crystallization, respectively). We performed ﬁltration to remove the highly
correlated and low—quality features. The training dataset was divided at
random into ﬁve training and test fold (as in the 5—fold cross—validation)
and we ranked the features according to their average, over the ﬁve training
folds, biserial correlation with the class labels. We selected the feature
with the highest average biserial correlation, and we added the next ranked
feature into the set of the selected features only if the Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient of this feature with every feature in the selected feature set
was <07. This step removed the highly correlated features. Next, we
computed the average value of the average (over the 5—folds) absolute
biserial correlations (with the class labels) for the selected features, and
we removed the features with the correlations below the average. The latter
step removes the low—quality features. At the end, we selected 86, 100, 115
and 95 features for the DB_MF (material production), DB_PF (puriﬁcation),
DB_CF (crystallization) and DB_CRYS (diffraction—quality crystallization)
training datasets, respectively.

2.3.4 Parameterization and feature selection For each dataset we built
three SVM models, implemented with the LibSVM package (Chang and Lin,
2001), that are based on the three available kernels including the radial basis
function (RBF), polynomial (POLY), which also includes the linear kernel,
and sigmoid (SIG). We computed total of 12 models (three different kernels
for four datasets: DB_MF, DB_PF, DB_CF and DB_CRYS). Each model
was built using the same procedure. First, the model for a given dataset was
parameterized using 10 features with the highest average biserial correlation
from the features selected in Section 2.3.3. Using 5—fold cross—validation on
the training set, we performed grid search to ﬁnd parameters that maximize
the MCC. For each parameter, except the degree of the polynomial, we
considered consecutive powers of 2. In case when the selected parameter
values were at the border of the search grid, we extended the search to the
next consecutive power of 2. The selected parameters were used to perform
the wrapper—based feature selection (Hall and Smith, 1999) using the best
ﬁrst search strategy. Supplementary Material provides detailed description
of the considered parameters and feature search procedure. After the feature
selection is completed, we parameterized the SVMs using the selected feature
set and the same grid search as above. Finally, we select the SVM that
provides the highest MCC (among the three kernel types) for each dataset,
see Supplementary Table 3, i.e. we use the POLY kernels for the prediction of
diffraction—quality crystallization, puriﬁcation and crystallization, and RBF
kernel for the prediction of the material production.

2.3.5 The 4-class prediction We aggregate outputs from the best four
SVM models developed in Section 2.3.4 to perform the 4—class prediction.
We investigated two approaches to aggregate predictions: (i) by selecting
the class with the maximal predicted probability (max-based); and (ii) by
choosing the class based on the order of the steps in the crystallization
protocol (order-based). In the latter case, we select the class by checking
the outputs of the SVMs in the order deﬁned in Table 1, from MF, to
PF, to CF and to CRYS. We predict the corresponding outcome if the
predicted probability is above a cut—off threshold, e.g. we predict that the
material production fails if the output from the corresponding SVM, which
quantiﬁes the probability of the material production failure, is greater that
the threshold. If none of the probabilities are above the threshold then we
select the outcome with the highest probability. We tried the cut—off values
from between 0.01 and 1 with step 0.01 and selected the value=0.43 that
maximizes the mean MCC (over the four classes) on the DB_4CL training
dataset. The max—based aggregation obtains the mean MCC and accuracy
equal 0.293 and 49.0%, respectively, while the order—based method obtains

Crystallization propensity prediction

 

0.345 and 54.8%, respectively. Supplementary Table 3 also shows that the
order—based aggregation also performs better, when compared with the max—
based aggregation, for the prediction of the individual outcomes for the
material production, puriﬁcation and crystallization. Consequently, we use
the order—based aggregation to implement the proposed PPCpred method.

2.3.6 BLAST-based predictor The existing predictors address only the
prediction of the diffraction—quality crystallization; they do not predict the
other three classes considered in this work. Therefore, we consider a baseline
score implemented using sequence alignment to comparatively evaluate the
predictive quality of our method. Each test trial/chain was aligned against the
sequences in the corresponding training dataset using PSI—BLAST (Altschul
et al., 1997) and we use the class label of the most similar chain as the
prediction. In the case when no alignments are found, the test chain is
predicted with the label of the most populated, i.e. more probable, class.
This is repeated for each of the ﬁve training and test dataset pairs, DB_MF,
DB_PF, DB_CF, DB_CRYS and DB_4CL.

3 RESULTS

The proposed PPCpred method, which utilizes the order—based
aggregation of the propensities predicted by the four SVM models,
was evaluated on the test datasets for the predictions of each of the
four outcomes, i.e. prediction of material production, puriﬁcation,
crystallization and diffraction—quality crystallization, as well as
for the 4—class prediction. We compare the results generated by
the PPCpred with the existing methods for the prediction of the
crystallization propensity, with the BLAST—based solution, and with
the maximum—based aggregation scheme.

3.1 Comparison of the diffraction-quality
crystallization propensity predictions

The PPCpred is compared with the recent predictors of the
crystallization propensity including OBScore (Overton and Barton,
2006), XtalPred (Slabinski et al., 2007b), ParCrys (Overton et al.,
2008), CRYSTALP2 (Kurgan et al., 2009), MetaPPCP (Mizianty
and Kurgan, 2009) and SVMCrys (Kandaswamy et al., 2010), with
the BLAST—based method, and with our SVM predictor of the
diffraction—quality crystallization (SVM_POLY), see the results on
the DB_CRYS dataset in Table 2. The PPCpred outperforms the
existing solutions in both the binary prediction (based on the MCC
and ACC scores) and the real—valued propensities (based on the AUC
values). The best, existing predictor is XtalPred, which is likely
due to the usage of the sequence alignment against the PDB and
nr databases, followed by SMVCrys and MetaPPCP. The PPCpred
improves over the SVM_POLY method, which demonstrates that
aggregation of the results from the four SVMs is helpful. Also, the
maximum—based aggregation is shown to be inferior to the order—
based aggregation used in the PPCpred for the binary predictions,
but the magnitude of this difference is relatively small. Table 2
shows that the improvements in MCC and ACC offered by PPCpred
are statistically signiﬁcant. The binary predictions from PPCpred
are characterized by high speciﬁcity (high success rate among the
native non—crystallizable proteins) at about 85%. This means that we
relatively rarely mispredict these chains to be crystallizable, which
would save resources to solve other chains.

The ROC curves of the considered predictors, except for the
BLAST and SVMCrys that provide only the binary predictions, are
shown in Supplementary Figure 1. PPCpred outperforms the other
solutions for true positive (TP) rates >0.85 and false positive (FP)

The proposed PPCpred is compared against results on the OB Score, XtalPred, ParCrys,
CRYSTALP2, MetaPPCP and SVMCrys on the DB_CRYS dataset, and against the
maximum-based aggregation method (max-based), the best performing SVM classiﬁer
(SVM_POLY or SVM_RBF), and the BLAST-based predictor on the four datasets. The
methods are sorted in the ascending order based on their MCC scores, and the highest
values for each quality index and dataset are shown in bold. The BLAST and SVMCrys
provide only binary prediction and thus we could not compute their AUC. Results of
tests of signiﬁcance of the differences in MCC and ACC between PPCpred and the other
methods are given in the ‘sig’ columns. The tests compare values over 100 bootstrapping
repetitions. The ‘+’ and ‘—’ mean that PPCpred is statistically signiﬁcantly better/worse
with P < 0.01, and ‘2’ means that results are not signiﬁcantly different.

rates>0.38, while the maximum—based aggregation works better
for smaller TP and FP rates. This demonstrates that PPCpred is
particularly useful when the user requires high TP rates, i.e. the
number of false negatives (crystallizable chains predicted are non—
crystallizable) is low. In this case, PPCpred would relatively rarely
mispredict chains that can be successfully solved, which would
protect against abandoning solvable targets. The high TP rate comes
as a trade—off for the higher FP rate (higher rate of predicting the non—
crystalizable chains as crystallizable), which means that PPCpred
would more often mistakenly advise to crystallize a difﬁcult target,
which consequently would waste resources.

We note that although the existing predictors achieve positive
MCC values, they are generally lower than the values reported in the
original publications on their test datasets. A possible explanation
for that is that our annotation is somehow different and that the
existing models were trained on relatively old, from before 2006,
trials. To test the latter hypothesis, we sorted the trials based on

their date of the last activity to investigate whether the predictive
quality varies with this timestamp, see Figure 2. The values of both
MCC and AUC are lower for the more recent trials for majority
of the methods, except for the PPCpred, XtalPred and the BLAST—
based predictor. This conﬁrms that the likely reason for the overall
relatively low performance of the ParCrys, OB Score, CRYSTALP2,
MetaPPCP and SVMCrys is the fact that they utilize older training
data. We note that XtalPred was updated in mid—2007 and it uses
sequence alignment against recent contents of the PDB and nr
databases, which helps to keep its predictions more up—to—date. This
ﬁnding suggests that the advances in the crystallization protocols
may render older predictors absolute, which motivates development
of new up—to—date methods.

3.2 Comparison of the prediction of the propensity of
material production, puriﬁcation, crystallization
and diffraction-quality crystallization

The results for each individual target outcome of the PPCpred,
BLAST—based predictors, our four SVM—based predictors of the
material production, puriﬁcation, crystallization and diffraction—
quality crystallization (SVM_POLY and SVM_RBF), and the
maximum—based method for combining the four SVMs predictors
are summarized in Table 2. Using the MCC measure, PPCpred
signiﬁcantly outperforms the other methods for the binary prediction
of the material production, puriﬁcation and diffraction—quality
crystallization, and it provides comparable predictive quality
with the maximum—based aggregator for the prediction of the
crystallization, i.e. the maximum—based aggregator provides an
improvement with small magnitude that is statistically signiﬁcant.

The proposed PPCpred is compared against the maximum-based aggregation method
(max-based), and the BLAST-based predictor. The methods are sorted in the ascending
order based on their MCC scores, and the highest values for each quality index and
dataset are shown in bold. Results of tests of signiﬁcance of the differences in mean
MCC and ACC between PPCpred and the other methods are given in the ‘sig’ columns.
The tests compare values over 100 bootstrapping repetitions. The ‘+’ an ‘—’ mean
that PPCpred is statistically signiﬁcantly better/worse with P < 0.01, and ‘2’ means that
results are not signiﬁcantly different.

PPCpred also provides well—balanced values of the sensitivity and
speciﬁcity. Our method provides reasonably high values of MCC,
between 0.32 and 0.47, which indicate that it provides useful outputs.

The evaluation for the 4—class predictions on the DB_4CL test
dataset is shown in Table 3. The output of the predictor indicates
whether a given chain will provide high—quality crystal, will fail to
crystallize, or whether the puriﬁcation or material production will
fail. The methods are evaluated using the overall accuracy (fraction
of the correctly predicted chains) and mean MCC (over the four
MCC values computed for each class/outcome). Only the PPCpred,
the alignment based predictor, and the maximum—based aggregation
method can be compared—the other methods predict only one of the
outcomes. The overall accuracy of PPCpred equals 55.6%, which is
higher by 5 and 21% than the accuracy of the other two solutions.
The improvements are statistically signiﬁcant. We believe that this
level of predictive quality should be acceptable for the potential
users given the current crystallization success rates, which are at
about 4.6% (Kurgan and Mizianty, 2009).

3.3 Factors related to prediction of crystallization,
puriﬁcation and material production propensity

Table 4 summarizes the features that were used in PPCpred. These
features utilize all considered information sources, including the
energy and hydrophobicity—based indices, composition of certain
amino acid types, the predicted disorder, secondary structure and
solvent accessibility, and content of certain buried and exposed
residues; Supplementary Table 4 lists the selected features. This
shows that the success/failure in the considered steps of the
crystallization process depends on a combination of multiple factors.
We observe the strong presence of information derived from the
hydrophobicity indices, which agrees with the observations in Goh
et al. (2004), Overton and Barton (2006), Chen et al. (2007), Overton
et al. (2008), Kurgan et al. (2009) and Babnigg and Joachimiak
(2010). Importantly, our features demonstrate the importance of
the inﬂuence of the hydrophobic or hydrophilic segments in the
protein chain on the success/failure on all considered steps in the
crystallization protocol, i.e. several selected features for prediction
of each of the four considered steps are based on the minimal
or maximal hydrophobicity in a sliding window. Our features

also suggest the importance of Cys residues for the prediction of
the material production and diffraction—quality crystallization, and
buried Cys for the prediction of puriﬁcation. This agrees with the
observations in (Overton et al., 2008; Slabinski et al., 2007b), but
these studies investigated only the propensity for the diffraction—
quality crystallization and did not consider the inﬂuence of the
solvent accessibility. Another factor related to the crystallization
success is the content of the buried His. This agrees with results in
Overton et al. (2008) and Kurgan et al. (2009), but these studies
again considered the overall content of His, without the inﬂuence of
the solvent accessibility.

Figure 3 shows scatter plots of three pairs of features that
were selected for the prediction of the crystallization, diffraction—
quality crystallization and puriﬁcation, respectively. The two
features used to predict crystallization, GOLD730101_min_10 and
WERD780103_min_5 (Fig. 3A), and based on the minimal average
values of the hydrophobicity (Goldsack and Chalifoux, 1973) and
energy (speciﬁcally the energy of transfer in water of an isolated
residue from a non—regular structure to the helical conformation)
(Wertz and Scheraga, 1978) indices in the sliding windows of sizes
10 and 5, respectively. This means that the sequence segments with
low hydrophobicity and transfer energy values are characteristic
to chains that are difﬁcult to crystallize. Importantly, combining
these two features allows for improved separation between the
successful and unsuccessful crystallization trials, i.e. trials for a
given range of values of one index are further separated by the
values of the other index. The diffraction—quality crystallization is
impacted by the DIS_SEG and AA_bur_S features (Fig. 3B), which
quantify the number of the predicted disorder segments and the
content of the predicted buried Ser, respectively. The content of
Ser was shown to be important for the prediction of crystallization
propensity in Overton et al. (2008) and Kurgan et al. (2009), but
these studies investigated the overall Ser content, while we show

that the (predicted) buried Ser provides strong discriminatory power.
Similarly, while the content of the predicted disordered residues
was used in several related studies (Slabinski et al., 2007b; Price
et al., 2009), our analysis reveals the strong inﬂuence of the number
of disordered segments. The plot shows that chains with larger
number of disordered segments and larger number of buried Ser are
more difﬁcult to crystallize. Finally, Figure 3C shows that chains
with larger amount of buried Ser (AA_bur_S feature) and high
hydrophobicity in a long—sliding window (GOLD730101_max_20
feature) are more challenging to purify.

Overall, the factors that we identiﬁed are intuitive, physically
reasonable and they are well aligned with the existing ‘rules of
thumb’. Our main contributions are in providing additional details
(e.g. related to solvent accessibility of selected residues types) and
the fact that our model provides a novel way of balancing these
factors to obtain good predictive performance.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We developed a ﬁrst—of—its—kind in silico method, PPCpred,
which predicts the success/failure for four main steps in the
protein crystallization protocols, including the material production,
puriﬁcation, crystallization and diffraction—quality crystallization.
PPCpred signiﬁcantly outperforms the alignment—based predictor
as well as the several modern crystallization propensity predictors.
Our method provides the overall accuracy at 56% and average MCC
at 0.35, which given current low success rates in the experimental
protocols should provide useful input for the SG centers and
crystallographers/biologists who are interested in participation in
the PSI:Biology phase. We also developed an improved protocol
to annotate progress of protein chains along the crystallization
process using the PepcDB, and we shows/conﬁrm several interesting
markers (based on the features included in our predictors) that
inﬂuence the success/failure of the above—mentioned steps.

The predictions generated by PPCpred could be used to guide
crystallographers to select more feasible alternative targets or, in
case when the target is already selected, to rank different constructs
of the same target. The former application is evaluated in our
work, while the evaluation of the latter one will be performed in
a feature study when large enough amount of suitable data becomes
available. Users of PPCpred could also ﬁnd out which of the
crystallization steps is the most likely obstacle in the crystallization
process, and try to modify the target to increase chances to pass that
step, e. g. the user may introduce tags at sequence termini to ease
puriﬁcation when the puriﬁcation failure is predicted. The success
of crystallization also depends on the crystallization protocols.
Our method was designed using data from several SG centers,
which allows us to generalize over multiple protocols. At the same
time, our model takes into account only the intra—molecular factors
that are encoded in the protein chain. Therefore, the PPCpred
as well as the other crystallization propensity predictors may not
provide reliable predictions when the inter—molecular factors such
as the speciﬁc characteristics of the expression systems, protein—
protein and/or protein—precipitant interactions, buffer composition,
precipitant diffusion method, gravity, etc., must be considered.

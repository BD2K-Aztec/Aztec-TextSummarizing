ABSTRACT

Summary: Palindromic sequences, or inverted repeats (IRs), in
DNA sequences involve important biological processes such as
DNA—protein binding, DNA replication and DNA transposition.
Development of bioinformatics tools that are capable of accurately
detecting perfect IRs can enable genome-wide studies of IR patterns
in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Different from conventional
string-comparison approaches, we propose a novel algorithm that
uses a cumulative score system based on a prime number represen-
tation of nucleotide bases. We then implemented this algorithm as a
MATLAB-based program for perfect IR detection. In comparison with
other existing tools, our program demonstrates a high accuracy in
detecting nested and overlapping IRs.

1 INTRODUCTION

Palindromic sequences, or inverted repeats (IRs), are sequences
that can form complementary pairing with themselves. Found in
abundance throughout both eukaryotic and prokaryotic gen-
omes, the ability of IRs to self-pair allows for the formation of
DNA secondary structures that serve as intermediates in biolo-
gical reactions such as DNA replication and transposition (Berg
et al., 1982; Lu et al., 2007; Rice, 2005): cruciforms can initiate
DNA replication by changing the supercoiling level or chromatin
structure, affecting the binding of DNA replication regulatory
factors (Cozzarelli and Wang, 1990; Pearson et al., 1996; White
and Bauer, 1987); DNA hairpins are a result of the palindromic
nature of perfect and imperfect IRs, allowing them to act as the
binding sites of dimeric regulatory factors (LeBlanc et al., 2000;
Lonskaya et al., 2005) and aid in the transposition process
(Kuang et al., 2009; Linheiro and Bergman, 2008, 2012; Pray,
2008). Both perfect and imperfect IRs also have an impact on
genomic structure: transposons prefer palindromic insertion sites
(Linheiro and Bergman, 2012). Transposons can be present in
eukaryotic genomes in a nested manner by occurring within

other transposons (Gao et al., 2012). Hence, analysis of nested
and overlapping perfecths can aid in a variety of research areas
including the study of regulatory factor binding sites and of
nested transposons.

Currently available tools in the detection of palindromes do
not perform well in terms of result quality (Gupta et al., 2006).
To make genome-wide studies of palindromic sequences feasible,
we need to develop efﬁcient and accurate tools for detecting both
perfect and quasi-palindromic sequences (palindromes contain
mismatches and/or non-palindromic spacers). Here we describe
a novel algorithm for a tool detecting perfect IRs, implemented
as a MATLAB function, capable of running on genome-scale
inputs.

2 ALGORITHM

Different from conventional string comparison algorithms
adopted in existing tools for palindrome detection, the major
steps of our algorithm are shown in Figure 1 (see the graphic
representation and pseudo-code of our algorithm in
Supplementary Figs SI and S2).

The algorithm detects the boarder positions of perfect IRs
using a cumulative scoring system. The scoring system is based
on assigning prime number scores to nucleotides such that the
scores of complimentary bases cancel each other out. A perfect
IR is deﬁned as a DNA sequence that satisﬁes the following two
conditions: (i) the numbers of complementary nucleotide bases
are equal and (ii) the number of nested palindromes within the
sequence, which share the same center as with the sequence, is
equal to half the number of the total bases present.

Our detection scheme is based around the assignment of scores
to each nucleotide: A and C are each assigned different prime
number scores, whereas T and G are each assigned a score equal
to the negative of the score of their complementary base, as
shown in Supplementary Figure 51. We then scan the sequence
and keep a running cumulative score, noting that if a score re-
peats itself at two positions, the intervening section must have a
balanced number of complementary bases (a result following
from our choice of prime number score values), and hence is
potentially a perfect IR. We ﬁlter out all substrings larger than
1000 bp, as doing so signiﬁcantly increases the efﬁciency of our
algorithm, and our data testing using chromosome one of
human, Arabidopsis and maize genome indicates that the pres-
ence of palindromes larger than 1000 bp are exceedingly rare. We

3 IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION

The proposed algorithm was implemented as a MATLAB func-
tion (using MATLAB R2012a) and was compared for accuracy
against existing IR detection tools including EMBOSS (Rice
et al., 2000), BioPHP (http://www.biophp.org/minitools/ﬁnd_
palindromes) and the MATLAB built-in function palindromes
on several simple test cases (Supplementary Table S1). The
tool IRF (Inverted Repeat Finder) WVarburton et al., 2004)
was excluded from the comparison because it cannot detect over-
lapping IRs. Our MATLAB tool was able to detect all nested
and overlapping IRs, whereas the other competing tools were
unable to function with 100% accuracy in many cases. As indi-
cated in the Supplementary Table S1, MATLAB’s and
EMBOSS’s algorithms were unable to detect some perfect IR
instances of TATA sequences, whereas BioPHP’s algorithm
missed overlapping perfect IRs starting in same position.
Guglietta et al. (2010) used BioPHP in their analysis of IRs in
HIV-1 gp120 sequences. In their analysis in the C3 region on
patient number three, they missed the detection of perfect IRs:
ATAT and TATA, whereas our tool was able to detect them (see
T estcase_HI V.fa in our supplementary data).

For validation on real data, our MATLAB program was run
on the HIV-1 genome (NC_001802.1) to search for all perfect
IRs, including the nested and overlapping patterns, of lengths
4—1000 nt. Consequently, we detected 649 perfect IRs in 0.1339 s.
Moreover, our tool proves to be well-suited for the detection of
perfect IRs in larger genome data sets like chromosome 1 of
Arabidopsis thaliana, Homo sapiens and Zea mays: we detected
17 030043 perfect IRs in H.sapiens, 25181675 in Z.mays and
2788106 in A.thaliana, using 1.035 h, 1.050h and 7.943 min,
respectively.

Although our tool has considerably higher accuracy than
other tools, that accuracy comes with some cost in runtime. To
determine whether the program was still practical to use on large
sequence inputs, we looked at the average execution time over
100 randomly generated sequences at sequence length ranging
from 4 to 1000 bp and found it to increase linearly with input
size (Supplementary Fig. S3).

4 CONCLUSION

Different from conventional string-comparison approaches
adopted in the existing tools, our MATLAB program uses a
novel prime number-based algorithm and can accurately detect
nested and overlapping IRs of lengths ranging from 4 to 1000 nt.
This tool is practically feasible for perfect IR detection in large
DNA sequences. Hence, this tool will assist in the effective and
accurate detection of perfect IRs in a genome-wide scale.

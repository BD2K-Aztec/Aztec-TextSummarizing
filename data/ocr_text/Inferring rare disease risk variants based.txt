ABSTRACT

Motivation: Family-based designs are regaining popularity for gen-
omic sequencing studies because they provide a way to test co-
segregation with disease of variants that are too rare in the
population to be tested individually in a conventional case—control
study.

Results: Where only a few affected subjects per family are
sequenced, the probability that any variant would be shared by all
affected relatives—given it occurred in any one family member—pro-
vides evidence against the null hypothesis of a complete absence of
linkage and association. A P—value can be obtained as the sum of the
probabilities of sharing events as (or more) extreme in one or more
families. We generalize an existing closed-form expression for exact
sharing probabilities to more than two relatives per family. When pedi-
gree founders are related, we show that an approximation of sharing
probabilities based on empirical estimates of kinship among founders
obtained from genome-wide marker data is accurate for low levels of
kinship. We also propose a more generally applicable approach based
on Monte Carlo simulations. We applied this method to a study of 55
multiplex families with apparent non-syndromic forms of oral clefts
from four distinct populations, with whole exome sequences available
for two or three affected members per family. The rare single nucleo-
tide variant rs149253049 in ADAMTSQ shared by affected relatives in
three Indian families achieved significance after correcting for multiple
comparisons (p = 2 x 10“”).

1 INTRODUCTION

The advent of high-throughput sequencing of whole exomes and
even whole genomes opens the possibility of detecting rare var-
iants (RVs, including those unique to a family, and alleles up to a
frequency of 1% in a population) impacting human health. The
ﬁrst successful applications of exome sequencing have been with
rare Mendelian traits (Gilissen et al., 2012). A common study
design to discover highly penetrant causal variants that are rare
in families where previous genotyping has not been performed is
to sequence the exome (or increasingly, the whole genome) of
two or three affected subjects, and focus on novel variants pre-
dicted to be functional and shared by all sequenced family mem-
bers as likely causal variants (Gilissen et al., 2012).

Contrary to monogenic Mendelian traits, considerable genetic
heterogeneity must be expected with complex diseases. Familial
forms of numerous common complex diseases are caused by
RVs, supporting the hypothesis that RVs may explain a part
of the so-called ‘missing heritability’ of these diseases, although
the extent of the contribution of RVs to complex disease herit-
ability is an ongoing debate (Gibson, 2012). In a family where
cases cluster, there is a high probability that multiple affected
members carry the same rare disease predisposing variant if such
a variant exists and its penetrance is high (Cirulli and Goldstein,
2010; Wijsman, 2012). This gives an advantage to family samples
over the samples of unrelated individuals, where disease-causing
RVs may be seen only once or twice among tens of thousands of
subjects.

As with Mendelian disorders, it has initially been proposed to
use the RV sharing information to ﬁlter out RVs not shared in at
least one family (F eng et al., 2011). For variants sufﬁciently rare
so copies in the sequenced relatives are almost certainly identical
by descent (IBD), the probability that an RV independent of the
disease and detected in at least one sequenced subject would not
be shared by other sequenced relatives who are affected was
computed by Feng et al. (2011) to quantify the effectiveness of
what they call the ‘concordance ﬁlter’ in discarding irrelevant
RVs. We adopt the View that the probability that an RV would

be shared by all affected relatives in a family—given it occurs
in any one of them—computed disregarding the disease pheno-
type can be used to quantify evidence against the null hypothesis
of absence of linkage and association to the disease and, there-
fore, establish that the RV may predispose to disease. We em-
phasize that RV sharing probabilities are not the same as IBD
sharing probabilities. A parent—offspring pair carries DNA from
three distinct chromosomes at any locus: one the parent and
offspring share IBD, one in the parent and one in the offspring.
The probability they share one allele IBD is hence equal to 1.
However, a RV seen in one of the two relatives is present on only
one of the three chromosomes. The probability that this chromo-
some is the one shared IBD is  So, parent—offspring pairs are
informative for RV sharing analysis, whereas they are unin-
formative for IBD sharing-based linkage analysis. For more dis-
tant relationships, RV sharing probabilities remain smaller than
IBD sharing probabilities as explained in Section 4. This infor-
mation can be combined across all the families where the RV is
seen, if more than one occurs. Mathematical expressions general-
izing sharing probabilities to more than two relatives per family
are given in the Section 2. This approach for calculating sharing
probabilities does not require knowledge of the actual variant
allele frequency in the population, and only assumes there is no
identity by state (IBS) without IBD among sequenced family
members. We illustrate that these calculated sharing probabilities
are good approximations of the true IBS sharing probabilities for
allele frequencies up to ~1%, and also explore the power of the
test based on these probabilities to detect disease susceptibility
RVs using relative pairs under genetic heterogeneity models.

In addition to variant rarity, the known pedigree must be cor-
rect (in particular, all founders are unrelated) to insure a variant
is introduced only once in the family. Cryptic relatedness can
often be detected from dense marker genotype data. When foun-
ders of a known pedigree are related, an RV may be introduced
more than once, leading to greater actual sharing probabilities
than the value computed based on the known pedigree, and to an
overstatement of the evidence against the null. We examine the
impact of unknown relationships and propose to approximate
the sharing probability using kinship coefﬁcients among foun-
ders, estimated empirically from genome-wide marker data on
family members. The validity of the approximation is evaluated
in a simulation of small populations.

We then apply the RV sharing probability computation to a
whole exome sequencing study of 55 multiplex families with
apparent non-syndromic forms of oral clefts from four distinct
populations. Oral clefts are the most common craniofacial mal-
formations, representing a good example of a genetically hetero-
geneous disorder with at least a dozen different genes previously
identiﬁed as genetic risk factors Via genome-wide association
studies (Beaty et al., 2013; Ludwig et al., 2012).

2 METHODS

Our goal is to compute the probability that a set of related subjects suf-
fering from the same disease, whose DNA sequence has been obtained
through sequencing (sequenced subjects), share an RV given that an RV
has been observed at a site in the sequence in one of them, under the null
hypothesis of no linkage and no association to any observed or unob-
served disease susceptibility variant for the disease. In the basic setting, all

founders are unrelated and we assume the variant is rare enough that a
single copy exists among all the alleles present among the nf founders of
the pedigree linking the sequenced subjects. In a generalization, we allow
founders to be related, and allow for up to two copies of the RV to be
introduced into the pedigree by related founders. We ﬁnally demonstrate
how RV sharing probabilities computed in a single family can be com-
bined across multiple families where the same variant is seen, and how to
derive the P-Value for the hypothesis test.

2.1 Rare variant sharing probability assuming unrelated
founders

We deﬁne the following random variables:

C,- Number of copies of the RV received by sequenced subject i,
F]- Indicator variable that founder j introduced one copy of the RV into
the pedigree,
Di]- Number of generations (meioses) between subject i and his or her
ancestor j.

For a set of n sequenced subjects, we want to compute the probability
P[RV shared] =P[C1 =  = C, =1|C1+...+C,, Z 1]

where the expression on the third line results from our assumption of a
single copy of that RV among all alleles present in the nf founders. The
probabilities P[Fj] = "if cancel from the numerator and denominator. For
the other terms, we ﬁrst derive expressions for the special case where all
the sequenced subjects descend from every founder among their ancestors
through independent lines of descent. In that case,

where Dj = Z,- Dij and d(i) is the subset of sequenced subjects who des-

We note that this equation covers pedigrees with individuals marrying
multiple times and marriage loops as in the family depicted in Figure 1B,
provided all lines of descent are independent and there is no inbreeding.
This is a generalization of the RV sharing probability for two relatives,
P[RVshared] = W (Feng et al., 2011) where D is the degree of rela-
tionship deﬁned such that the expected proportion of alleles shared IBD

where f is any of the two founders forming the ancestral couple.

When the lineages of sequenced individuals ‘coalesce’ at a branching
individual k who descended from founders of the pedigree (such as sub-
ject 6 in Fig. 1A), recursive computations described in the Supplementary
Section A, and implemented in the RVsharing R package, are required.

The above approach for calculating sharing probabilities does not re-
quire knowledge of the actual variant frequency in the population, a
distinct advantage when only few subjects are sequenced, possibly all of
whom are affected. However, the variant has to be sufﬁciently rare so the
probability of ﬁnding two copies IBS but not IBD among sequenced
family members is negligible. For a ﬁxed variant frequency, and assuming
unrelated founders and Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium, exact IBS sharing
probabilities for pedigree members can simply be derived using condi-
tional probabilities under Mendel’s laws. We compare these true sharing
probabilities with the sharing probabilities calculated under the ‘no IBS
without IBD’ assumption for variant frequencies ranging from 0.001 to
0.05 in a variety of pedigrees, to assess when the above sharing probabil-
ities are good approximations of the truth (see Section 3.1).

 

2.2 Computation allowing for relatedness among founders

We generalize our computation to the setting where founders are related,
while still excluding the possibility the founders are themselves inbred
(only their children will be). When the relatedness between speciﬁc
pairs of founders is completely unknown and marker genotype data re-
veal IBD sharing in excess of the expectation based on the pedigree struc-
ture, we propose to approximate RV sharing probabilities between
sequenced subjects using either a numerical approximation or Monte
Carlo simulation, and show that either of the approaches gives a good
approximation.

We assume all founders are related to the same extent, i.e. the kinship
coefﬁcient ¢jk between all pairs of founders j and k is a (low, but positive)

constant denoted «V, with the superscript f for ‘founders’. This assump-
tion is required because there is a considerable variation in estimated
kinship coefﬁcients for pairs of subjects with the same degree of related-
ness, even with perfect information on IBD sharing between subjects,
because of variation in the length of genome shared from pair to pair
(Manichaikul et al., 2010). Reliable inferences can thus only be obtained
for the mean or another central tendency parameter. We also assume at
most two founders introduced a copy of the RV considered in the
computation.

Two situations can occur with respect to the marker genotype data
available to estimate kinship among founders:

1. Polymorphic markers have been genotyped on the pedigree foun-
ders, typically from a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) array. Then ¢jk can be estimated for each founder pair j and

k, and a global estimate (if obtained by averaging the (jbjk over all
founder pairs from the same population.

2. Genotype data are only available on the sequenced subjects (either
from the sequencing data itself or from other genotyping). The
common 1% is estimated based on estimated kinship coefﬁcients be-
tween sequenced subjects and the degrees of relationship between
the sequenced subjects and all founders as described in the
Supplementary Section B.

The numerical approximation consists in obtaining the probability
P[Fj, Fk] = P2 (Vj, k) every founder pair introduces the RV, and the prob-
ability P[FjU] = PU(Vj) every founder alone introduces the RV. Assuming
only one or two founders introduce the RV, anU + %nﬂnf — 1)P2 = 1,
and we only need to obtain PU. We obtain an approximation of PU from
115 by expressing PU as an expectation over the distribution of the number
A of alleles distinct by descent among founders. We show in the
Supplementary Section C that

an
PU=;P[A =a](n3—%) (1)

1 f

Among the a distinct alleles present, we then assume neither is present
more than twice; 2nf — a of them are present twice; and the remaining 2
(a — nf) are present only once. We further assume A only takes the values
2nf — d, . . ., 2nf with positive probability, where d is a tuning parameter
representing the maximum number of alleles present twice. We param-
eterize the probabilities P[A] to be proportional to

2nf— d  2nf—1 2nf

inspired from a truncated Poisson distribution. In the Supplementary
Section C we explain in detail how 0 is obtained from ([5 . We ﬁnally
obtain the approximate RV sharing probability using the estimated
value of PU:

tion of the RV by two of the founders P[C1 =  = C” = 1|Fj, Fk] and

P[C1 + . . . + C, 2 HF}, Fk] are computed exactly using the formulas in
the Supplementary Section D.

When Monte Carlo sampling is used to approximate the RV sharing
probability, we repeat the following steps for a large number R of repli-
cates. We ﬁrst sample an indicator variable of whether one or two copies
of the RV were introduced into the family, with probability w and 1 — w,
respectively. In practice this is done by sampling the number of distinct
alleles a from distribution (2), then sampling the RV among the a alleles.
The RV is introduced twice if it is one of the ﬁrst 2nf — a alleles, and
introduced once otherwise. If it is introduced twice, the pair of founders
introducing the RV is sampled with equal probability for all pairs. If it is
introduced once, the sole founder introducing it is sampled instead. Then
the transmission of the RV down the pedigree from the one or two foun-
ders introducing it is simulated according to Mendel’s laws. The events
that the variant was observed in any of the sequenced subjects
(C1 + . .. + C, 2 1) and in all ofthem (C1 =  = C, = 1) are recorded.
The proportions of these two events computed over R replicates estimate
the numerator and denominator of Equation (3), respectively. The Monte
Carlo approach is implemented in our R package RVsharing.

Monte Carlo simulation of transmission of an RV is also straightfor-
ward in pedigrees containing inbreeding loops. The simulation can be
performed assuming pedigree founders are unrelated by forcing the intro-
duction of only one copy of the RV (i.e. w = 1) or allowing for relatedness
among founders as described earlier. Assuming unrelated founders, a
method providing exact sharing probabilities with a single inbreeding
loop and an approximation with two or more inbreeding loops is also
presented in the Supplementary Section E.

2.3 Combining RV sharing probabilities across multiple
families

For variants seen in only one family, the RV sharing probability can be
interpreted directly as a P-value from a Bernoulli trial. For variants seen
in M families and shared by affected relatives in a subset S0 of them, the
P-value can be obtained as the sum of the probability of events as (or
more) extreme as the observed sharing in the family subset So. If we
denote pm as the sharing probability between the subjects in family m,
the P-value is

M
p = Z Hpiimes”(1 _pm)I(m¢SV)

where V is the subset of family sets S, such that

m=1

2.4 Deﬁning the set of rare variants tested

The lowest possible P-value for an RV seen in one or more families
depends on family structure. The sharing probabilities between sequenced
subjects in small or densely inbred families are high, and so is the poten-
tial P-value of an RV seen only in one such family (for instance, it is % for
an avuncular pair). We propose to test the null hypothesis of absence of
linkage and association only among those variants with frequency less
than a prespeciﬁed threshold (typically 1%) that could achieve a P-value
below the level controlling the family-wise error rate, if shared by all
affected subjects in the family (or families) in which they occur (i.e. po-
tential P-value). These potential P-values are independent of the actual
sharing pattern among affected subjects and, therefore, of the subsequent
testing of RV sharing. We obtain this subset of RVs by ordering the
potential P-values of RVs in decreasing order, stopping at the last poten-
tial P-value lower than the family-wise Type I error level 01 divided by the
rank 1 of the P-value, yielding a threshold of

3 RESULTS
3.1 Validation of the assumption that RVs are IBD

When all founders are unrelated, the assumption that only a
single copy of the variant exists among the founders’ alleles
(no IBS without IBD) provides good approximations of the
true IBS sharing probabilities for a variety of relationship
types between pairs and triplets of sequenced subjects (Fig. 2).
The deviation from the actual IBS sharing probability remains
<20% up to a frequency in the population slightly >1 % for ﬁrst
cousin pairs and triples, and a frequency of about 0.5% for
second cousin pairs and triples.

3.2 Validation of the approximation of the sharing
probabilities with related founders

We simulated small populations as described in the
Supplementary Section F from which we sampled founders of
a pedigree to validate the quality of the approximation of sharing
probabilities in presence of relatedness among founders. We used
the pedigree for three second cousins shown in Supplementary
Figure S1, with an RV sharing probability of % = 0.0013 when
the founders are unrelated, as shown in Figure 2. This family
structure was encountered in our oral cleft sample and was
chosen for its three sequenced subjects with symmetric relation-
ships. The simulation was repeated 100 times for each population
size. Supplementary Table S1 shows the mean and SD of the
mean kinship coefﬁcient between pairs of subjects from the gen-
eration of the founders and of the mean number of copies of an
RV in the eight subjects sampled to be the founders of the pedi-
gree. With a population of 100 founders, the probability that the
RV is introduced by more than two founders (given that it was
seen in at least one founder) is too high to obtain a good ap-
proximation of the RV sharing probability when assuming the

is equal to 22:1 ((12, — 129/12,) with R = 100.

RV can only be introduced once or twice. The approximation
was therefore computed only with 200 and 400 founders.

The ﬁrst step in applying the approximation method was to
estimate the parameter 0 of the distribution of the number of
distinct alleles among all founders. We used two different values
for (if: the mean kinship coefﬁcient among the eight sampled
subjects and the mean kinship coefﬁcient in the population.
The former is a best case scenario, where a pedigree-speciﬁc (if
is estimated without error, which is not possible in practice,
whereas the latter can be approached with a sufﬁciently large
sample from the population. Supplementary Figure S2 illustrates
the approximations of the number of distinct alleles among foun-
ders are good, although the unlikely events of observing only
8—10 distinct alleles among the pedigree founders from the 200
founder population were not captured by the approximate
distributions.

We approximated the RV sharing probability using formulas
(1) and (3), plus those in the Supplementary Section D, and also
alternatively by Monte Carlo, sampling 100 000 realizations of
RV transmission down the pedigree of Supplementary Figure S1
in each replicate. The approximation of the probability P[Fj, Fk]
that two founders introduced an RV was on average slightly
lower than the value in the simulated populations, in particular
when the number of founders was low (Supplementary Table
S1). To evaluate the actual quality of the RV sharing approxi-
mation, we estimated the root mean squared error (RMSE) and
bias over the simulation replicates, and observed that the RV
sharing approximation was accurate and precise unless the
number of population founders was low (Table 1). The RV shar-
ing probability approximation was accurate for the population

with 400 founders (negligible bias), where the mean kinship co-
efﬁcient was approximately equal to second cousins once
removed (ﬁg). The RV sharing probability was on average under-
estimated (negative bias) for the population with 200 founders,
where the mean kinship is between ﬁrst cousins once removed
(é) and second cousins (6—14), suggesting limits for approximation
methods restricted to two founders introducing an RV. The loss
of precision and accuracy from using the population average (1]
instead of the average of the sampled subjects was smaller in the
population with 400 founders than in the population with 200
founders, both in absolute and relative terms. Sampling 100 000
realizations of RV transmission in the Monte Carlo simulation
was sufﬁcient to achieve the same level of error as the numerical
approximation with a relatively larger RV sharing probability in
populations of 200 founders, but the Monte Carlo error re-
mained slightly higher when approximating the smaller RV shar-
ing probability in populations with 400 founders.

3.3 Power study

We assessed the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when
testing a causal RV (statistical power) using the proposed ap-
proach with parent—offspring, as well as ﬁrst and second cousin
pairs. We ﬁrst determined with 4 and 10 pairs where the RV
occurs, the number of pairs sharing an RV needed to reject the
null at signiﬁcance level 2.1 x 10‘s, the level in our exome
sequencing study of oral clefts. We then computed the power
as the probability of equaling or exceeding these numbers of
sharing pairs under alternative hypotheses where the probability
of RV sharing given the event (A1, A2) the two relatives are af-
fected P1 = P[RVsharedlAl, A2] = P[C1 = C2 =l|A1, A2, C1 -]-
C2 2 1] was computed assuming an RV had an effect on disease
risk. For a dominant RV, the relationship between P1 and P0
= P[RV shared] is well approximated by the expression 12,1 2 r
153,0 where r is the marginal relative risk of the RV, for the classes
of multilocus additive and genetic heterogeneity models [Risch
(1990); the expression is exact when the RV is the single genetic
cause of disease]. Under these model classes, the marginal rela-
tive risk of an RV is approximately the ratio of penetrance over
disease prevalence. Figure 3 shows power as a function of pene-
trance and marginal relative risk of the RV for a genetic hetero-
geneity model detailed in the legend. For a ﬁxed marginal
relative risk, the power is roughly constant with respect to disease
prevalence (results not shown). The penetrance required to keep
the marginal relative risk ﬁxed, however, varies and is obviously
bounded above by one.

 

 

3.4 Whole exome sequencing study of non-syndromic oral
clefts

We computed the sharing probability for all rare single nucleo-

Marginal relative risk

Fig. 3. Power of the test based on sharing probabilities. Power was com-
puted for a dominant RV with frequency of 1 x 104. The disease had a
population prevalence of 1% and a recurrence risk to offspring of 5, to
ﬁrst cousins of 2 and to second cousins of 1.25. The signiﬁcance level of
2.1 x 10‘5 was achieved when 10/10 parent—offspring pairs, 4/4 or 6/10
ﬁrst cousins pairs and 3/4 or 4/ 10 second cousin pairs shared the
RV (4 parent—offspring pairs are insufﬁcient to achieve the signiﬁcance
level)

composed of 51 families providing two affected subjects and 3
families providing three affected subjects for a total of 111
sequenced subjects. There were 60038 exonic and splice site
SNVs with frequency <0.01 in the autosomal genome of these
111 sequenced subjects. Further details on the sequencing study
are given in the Supplementary Section G.

We computed the RV sharing probabilities based on the
known pedigree structures exactly in the 50 non-inbred families
and using Monte Carlo simulation in the 4 inbred families.
We then computed potential P-values of the rare SNVs (see
Section 2.3) and obtained 2355 values below the threshold %
= 2.1 x 10‘5 for a family-wise Type I error rate of 0.05.
Supplementary Figure S3 shows the distribution of P-values
for the selected SNVs. The SNV rs149253049 in ADAMT S9
had a P = 2.1 x 10‘6. The G allele, the rarest of the three nu-
cleotides A, C and G at this SNV, was shared by affected rela-
tives in three families from India (Supplementary Table S2) and
was not seen in any other family, neither in the ESP nor in the
1000 Genomes databases. For the Indian families, kinship esti-
mates between affected subjects from genome-wide SNP geno-
types based on the estimator of Manichaikul et al. (2010) did not
produce any evidence of excess IBD sharing given the known
degree of relatedness, nor of relatedness between subjects from
distinct Indian families.

In addition to rs149253049, another SNV, rs117883393 in
0R2A2, had a P-value below the Bonferroni—corrected signiﬁ-
cance threshold (P = 5.6 x 10‘6). The T allele at this SNV was
shared in a heterozygous state by all sequenced subjects from
three families (the two Syrian families depicted in Figure 1 and

an avuncular German pair) and was present in a heterozygous
state in one of two sequenced ﬁrst cousins once removed from
another German family. Its frequency in the ESP database is
0.0063 for the whole sample, and 0.0081 for the European—
American subsample. We suspected sharing probabilities may
be underestimated in the Syrian families, where cultural and
demographic factors make relationships between founders
more likely. We obtained (if = 0.013, close to the kinship coef-
ﬁcient of second cousins (a. Application of the approximation
method to the two Syrian families whose sequenced members,
shared the rare allele at rs117883393 using that value of q)
reduced the evidence against the null hypothesis. A sensitivity
analysis further revealed that allele frequencies as low as 0.5%
in the Syrian population would render this ﬁnding non-signiﬁ-
cant. Additional details on the detected signals are presented in
the Supplementary Section G, where we also report that the
standard ﬁltering consisting in keeping novel non-synonymous
or truncating RVs predicted to be damaging and shared by af-
fected relatives left us with a much greater number of variants to
follow-up (656).

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we propose using the probability of sharing of an
RV by affected subjects under the null hypothesis of complete
absence of linkage and association between an RV and disease
status to build evidence against this null hypothesis in the context
of exome sequencing studies of complex diseases in family sam-
ples. This approach will be successful at ﬁnding RVs with high
penetrance for diseases where such variants are involved. We
have presented formulas to compute exact probabilities of shar-
ing of an RV by any number of affected subjects in arbitrary
non-inbred pedigrees under the assumption the variant is sufﬁ-
ciently rare to be introduced only once in the pedigree, general-
izing a previous formula applicable to two affected subjects.

It is important to stress that more information is extracted in
this approach from each family than in the case of testing for
linkage alone because we require the RV in question, and not any
allele, to be shared. This is most easily illustrated with two rela-
tives of degree D, for which the probability of sharing an allele
IBD is 21%, while the RV sharing probability is  The ratio
P[RV shared]/P[IBD] will tend to 2 as D tends to inﬁnity so RV
sharing is more informative for making inference on a particular
RV in families where the RV is seen. Our power study indicated
moderate to good power to detect highly penetrant variants with
a small number of families where the variant is observed. Power
declines as the relative risk decreases, but if several RVs are
involved in a heterogeneous disease, the probability of ﬁnding
at least one would remain good even if power is low. First cousin
pairs provided more power than second cousin and parent—off-
spring pairs under genetic heterogeneity and dominant effect of
the variant, the model most compatible with RVs causing disease
in unilineally related subjects.

The assumption that a RV is sufﬁciently rare for being almost
certainly IBD among relatives is crucial to the validity of the RV
sharing probabilities. We recommend performing an analysis of
sensitivity to this assumption for any potential ﬁnding, as we
have done for the two hits in the oral clefts study.

Rare variant sharing by relatives

 

A potential pitfall with RV sharing probabilities based on a
known pedigree structure is the possibility of cryptic relatedness
among founders that would make the actual null sharing prob-
ability greater than the one computed here. We have developed
an adjustment to RV sharing probabilities based on estimates of
the kinship coefﬁcients among founders of known pedigrees
under the assumption of equal kinship coefﬁcients for all pairs
of founders. Our simulation study on a pedigree whose founders
were drawn from larger pedigrees representing small populations
showed the approximation is accurate when the mean kinship
coefﬁcient among founders of the known pedigree is no greater
than the kinship coefﬁcient of second cousins once removed (3%),
but will underestimate RV sharing probabilities with closer rela-
tionships. The simulation study also revealed an accurate ap-
proximation can be achieved using Monte Carlo sampling with
a reasonable number of draws for sharing probabilities of the
order of 10‘3.

An important aspect of our adjustment for unknown relation-
ships is to be based solely on estimated kinship between foun-
ders, and not require an estimate of the RV frequency in the
population from which the pedigree founders were drawn. We
have proposed a formula to estimate mean kinship among foun-
ders based on the kinship estimates between sequenced subjects.
A number of methods can be used to estimate kinship coefﬁ-
cients from genome-wide genotype data (Manichaikul et al.,
2010; Speed et al., 2012; Thornton et al., 2012; Yang et al.,
2011), and an appraisal of these methods is beyond the scope
of this article. Because our approximation method requires only
a mean kinship coefﬁcient between founders, variation in the
length of genome shared by pairs of subjects is smoothed by
averaging. Using a population average instead of the true aver-
age over the founder pairs of the pedigree had a moderate impact
on the error in our simulation study.

For this work, we have implemented the formulas to compute
our numerical approximation of the RV sharing probability
allowing for relatedness among founders and assess the sensitiv-
ity to allele frequency speciﬁcally for the family structures shown
in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1 and reported in
Supplementary Table S2. Developing an implementation of
these formulas to general pedigree structures remains challen-
ging. However, these checks of the analysis assumptions can
also be performed by Monte Carlo simulation, implemented in
the RVsharing R package.

In our extension of the RV sharing probability to more than
two subjects, we considered only the probability that all affected
sequenced subjects share the RV. This is appropriate for three
affected subjects sequenced in a pedigree as in the oral cleft
study, where causal RVs not shared by all sequenced subjects
are indistinguishable from benign RVs. However, it is too strin-
gent a requirement when larger numbers of affected subjects
from large multiplex families are sequenced, given the intrafamil-
ial heterogeneity in disease causes typical of complex traits (F eng
et al., 2011). At the same time, with n > 3 sequenced subjects in a
family, the event that n — 1 or n — 2 affected subjects out of n
share an RV is itself evidence against the null hypothesis. The
computation of the probability of such events in pedigrees of
arbitrary structure will require further work.

Non-affected family members may also be included in future
sequencing studies. While sequencing non-affected family

members has been used to exclude private benign variation in
studies of Mendelian traits (Gilissen et al., 2012), this risks
excluding causal variants showing incomplete penetrance in stu-
dies of complex traits. An affected only analysis of RV sharing
protects against unaffected carriers reducing evidence for a vari-
ant in the same way as it does in linkage analysis (McPeek, 1999).
Sequence data on non-affected family members, in particular
subjects marrying into the pedigree, will still be useful in narrow-
ing down the number of founders that could have introduced
a given RV in the pedigree and reﬁne these RV sharing
probabilities.

The methods and analyses presented are limited to considering
a single RV at a time. Our results illustrate how with a
few families it is possible to obtain substantial evidence of co-
segregation between a RV and disease. Yet, rare causal variants
found in a single family were not considered in our analysis of
these multiplex cleft families because individual families provide
limited information. A combined analysis of multiple RVs from
the same functional unit, typically the same gene, will be needed
to detect signiﬁcant RV sharing at that level. Various issues still
need to be resolved to implement such analysis, in particular,
dealing with multiple RVs within the same family. This will be
the object of future work.

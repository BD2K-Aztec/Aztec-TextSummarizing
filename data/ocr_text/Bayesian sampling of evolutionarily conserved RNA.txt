ABSTRACT

Motivation: Today many non-coding RNAs are known to play an
active role in various important biological processes. Since RNA’s
functionality is correlated with specific structural motifs that are
often conserved in phylogenetically related molecules, computational
prediction of RNA structure should ideally be based on a set of
homologous primary structures. But many available RNA secondary
structure prediction programs that use sequence alignments do
not consider pseudoknots or their estimations consist on a single
structure without information on uncertainty.

Results: In this article we present a method that takes advantage
of the evolutionary history of a group of aligned RNA sequences for
sampling consensus secondary structures, including pseudoknots,
according to their approximate posterior probability. We investigate
the benefit of using evolutionary history and demonstrate the
competitiveness of our method compared with similar methods
based on RNase P RNA sequences and simulated data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since the ﬁrst discovery of catalytic RNA activity in the early
1980s a great number of structural and enzymatic RNAs have been
found, which are involved in a large variety of tasks concerning
highly topical ﬁelds of research including gene regulation (Roth and
Breaker, 2009), tumor biology (Poliseno et al., 2010) and epigenetic
phenomena (Bonasio et al., 2010). A fundamental condition for the
biological function of RNA is the ability to adopt complex tertiary
structures. These molecule comformations are encoded to some
extent by the sequence of the molecule’s nucleotides, i.e. the primary
structure (Onoa and Tinoco, 2004). Since structure determination
by experimental techniques like X—ray crystallography and NMR
spectroscopy are time consuming and costly (Fiirtig et al., 2003),

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

researchers are interested in computational methods to predict the
molecule’s conformation based on its primary structure.

In cases when several similar functional RNA sequences of
evolutionarily related organisms are available, their structure can
be inferred by comparative sequence analysis. Since the biological
function of ncRNAs is determined by their molecular structure,
RNA sequence evolution is constrained by the secondary structure.
Changes in the molecules primary structure have less inﬂuence on
selection pressure as long as the secondary and tertiary structure
is maintained. This is the case when compensatory mutations
conserve complementarity between base pairings (Durbin et al.,
1999; Wheeler and Honeycutt, 1988). Thus, in a multiple sequence
alignment where structurally similar parts are grouped together, pairs
of columns can be found that provide these co—varying signals.
Comparative structure prediction methods use information like this
to predict the structure that a group of related RNA sequences
share (i.e. the consensus secondary structure). If a structurally
correct or at least a high quality alignment is given, methods of
this category, e. g. Pfold (Knudsen and Hein, 2003) and RNAalifold
(Hofacker et al., 2002), achieve very good results (Gardner and
Giegerich, 2004). (Knudsen and Hein, 2003) describe the algorithms
implemented in Pfold in terms of Stochastic Context—Free Grammars
(SCFGs), which generate secondary structures with nested base
pairings. This means that if position i is paired with position i’ > i,
andj is paired with j’ >j, then either i<j <j’ <i’ orj<i<i’<j’
must hold. Also many other RNA secondary structure reconstruction
methods, including RNAalifold, focus on secondary structures that
fulﬁll this assumption.

An remaining problem is given by structural elements called
pseudoknots, which contain non—nested base pairings. Even if they
occur rather rarely, pseudoknotted RNAs are known to be essential
for a large variety of functional processes in the cell (Staple and
Butcher, 2005). Several methods have been proposed to reconstruct
secondary structures with pseudoknots (see, for example, Chen
et al., 2008; Reeder and Giegerich, 2004; Rivas and Eddy, 1999;
Ruan et al., 2004). The program IPKnot of (Sato et al., 2011)
reconstructs pseudoknotted consensus structures from homologous
RNA sequences. Benchmarks like CompaRNA (Puton et al., 2011)
reveal that we cannot expect to ﬁnd for every primary structure
the correct secondary structure with any of the available prediction
approaches, even if pseudoknots are neglected. For this reason, it is
important to assess the reliability of a prediction. One possibility
is to use Bayesian sampling, see (Eddy, 2004) for a primer.

PhyloQFoId

 

Following this strategy, (Metzler and Nebel, 2008) presented the
RNA secondary structure prediction program McQFold. Instead of
computing only the most likely folding of a given RNA primary
structure, it samples possible secondary structures according to their
approximate posterior probability, which makes the uncertainty of
the predictions explicitly assessable. They developed an extended
grammar model, permitting pseudoknots of arbitrary type, and a
Metropolis Hastings strategy for a Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) method to sample possible pseudoknot conﬁgurations. In
the program SimulFold (Meyer and Miklés, 2007) implemented an
MCMC method for the simultaneous Bayesian sampling of multiple
sequence alignments, phylogenies and RNA secondary structures.
The latter are ﬁrst sampled without pseudoknots, but the consensus
structures that are subsequently computed from the samples are so—
called bi—secondary structures, which can contain a certain type of
pseudoknots.

Here we present PhyloQFold, a new version of McQFold that
makes use of the evolutionary history of a set of homologous
RNA sequences. PhyloQFold is able to accept a multiple sequence
alignment and a phylogenetic tree as an input and beneﬁts from
comparative sequence analysis. We suggest an extended model
and show how the information that is contained in the alignment
is weighted by the phylogeny of the sequences and how this
information is integrated into the algorithms. We exemplify the
potential of our method and investigate the improvement introduced
by the new functionality. Furthermore, we compare the performance
of our method to that of similar approaches on RNase P RNA
sequence alignments and on data simulated according to our model.

2 MODEL

To deﬁne a prior probability distribution on the set of folded
alignments we combine the SCFG model of (Knudsen and Hein,
2003), which emits alignment columns, with the capability of the
model underlying McQFold to generate pseudoknots (Metzler and
Nebel, 2008). This means, we assume that the ﬁrst step to generate a
set of aligned RNA sequences is to generates a secondary structure,
which may contain pseudoknots, according to the extended SCFG
model of (Metzler and Nebel, 2008), which is based on the grammar
of (Knudsen and Hein, 1999) (see online Supplementary Material 1).
Compared with the SCFG of (Knudsen and Hein, 2003), our
grammar has an additional terminal symbol q, which can generate
pseudoknots after the SCFG has generated the sequence of terminal
symbols. For this, the q symbols occuring in the SCFG output are
randomly arranged into pairs that generate stem regions, so—called
‘q—stems’. The q symbols are then replaced by the corresponding
sequence sections that are matched in the q—stem. The q—stems are
usually not nested with the paired regions (‘stems’) generated by the
SCFG

After the grammar has generated the secondary structure,
positions of the structure that are not paired emit unpaired alignment
columns, whereas position pairs involved in stems emit pairs
of alignment columns. For a given alignment, let pT(i) be the
probability of the i—th column, given that it is emitted from an
unpaired position, and let pT(j,k) be the probability of columns
j and k, given that they are emitted as a pair of columns. These
probabilities depend on the given phylogenetic tree T along which
the sequences have evolved. For the emission probability pT(i)
of unpaired alignment columns we assume that all unpaired sites

evolve independently of each other along the phylogeny. Given
a substitution rate matrix for loop regions, we compute pT(i) by
Felsenstein’s pruning algorithm (Felsenstein, 1981). We account
for the stochastically dependent evolution of alignment columns
pairs by modelling the substitution process of doublets (Schdniger
and von Haeseler, 1994), which in our case are nucleotides at
opposite positions of a stem. Thus, the underlying transition dynamic
Pf_)h(t) deﬁnes the probability of the observed change of doublet

f E {a,g, c, u}2 into doublet h E {a,g, c, u}2 after time t. We compute
the emission probabilities pT(i,k) of paired alignment columns
with Felsenstein’s pruning algorithm, in which we use the 16X 16
substitution model of (Knudsen and Hein, 1999).

3 ALGORITHMS AND IMPLEMENTATION

The general ﬂow of our new program PhyloQFold is similar to that
of McQFold (Metzler and Nebel, 2008). The program generates a
set of candidates for the q—stems, i.e. segment pairs of the alignment
which may be involved in pseudoknots. From this pool of candidates,
conﬁgurations of q—stems are proposed in each step of the MCMC
sampling process. To decide whether a q—stem conﬁguration is
accepted as the next state of the Markov chain, it is rated by the
probability of the sequence alignment conditioned on the q—stem
conﬁguration, which is computed by the inside algorithm (Lari and
Young, January 1990). After a bum—in phase of 100 Metropolis
Hastings steps, every 50th state of the following 1000 steps is
used to sample one consensus structure and to approximate the
pairing probabilities (these default values can be changed by the
user). Each structure is computed by the inside algorithm with
randomized backtracking. For each possible pair of positions, the
posterior pairing probabilities are calculated with a variant of the
inside—outside algorithm and averaged over 20 sampled q—stem
conﬁgurations (Lari and Young, January 1990; Metzler and Nebel,
2008). The search for the most probable folding is based on
simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983). In the ﬁrst 1000 steps
of this heuristic, the proposal chain is optimized using the inside
algorithm to rate the states of the proposal chain, whereas in the
second phase (also 1000 steps) the CYK algorithm (Cocke, 1969;
Kasami, 1965; Younger, 1967) is used to rate each state. Finally, the
most probable parse tree together with the q—stem conﬁguration of
the last state of the Markov chain is assumed as the most probable
consensus secondary structure of the alignment.

In PhyloQFold, the SCFG algorithms (inside, outside, CYK) use
the emission probabilities pT(i) and pT (i , j) of alignment columns
and of pairs of alignment columns. Thus, PhleFold uses, like
PFold, the phylogenetic information contained in pT(.) and pT(., .).
This is the main difference to McQFold, which uses only emission
probabilities of single nucleotides and pairs of nucleotides.

The runtime of the SCFG algorithms is cubic in the length 5 of
the input alignment. The number n of sequences only affects the
runtime of the Felsenstein pruning algorithm, which is linear in n
and is performed only once for each of the E alignment columns
and £2 pairs of alignment columns, see also online Supplementary
Material 4.1 and Table 1.

The current C—l——l— implementation of PhyloQFold takes as input
a multiple sequence alignment in FASTA format and a phylogeny in
rooted Newick tree format. The program is based on the prerequisite
that each header line of the FASTA ﬁle corresponds to one leaf label

of the Newick tree ﬁle. The output is given by three result ﬁles. One
ﬁle consists of 20 sampled consensus secondary structures, another
ﬁle contains the pairing probabilities for all position pairs and the
third ﬁle contains the most probable consensus folding.

3.1 Detecting q-stem candidates

For a given alignment, the pool of q—stem candidates is a set
ofinterval pairs E={(i,i+1,...,i—i—k),(j—k,...,j—1,j)}. To decide
during the MCMC procedure which ii are proposed to be involved
in a pseudokont, we apply two criteria. First, a q—stem candidate
if should provide complementary nucleotides in the corresponding
alignment columns. Second, ii are preferred if they have a small
probability to form a regular non—pseudoknot stem.

To ﬁnd segment pairs if that comply with the ﬁrst criterion, we
search for high-scoring segment-pairs (HSP; Altschul et al., 1990)
between the input alignment and its complement, which means that
the order of positions is inverted and nucleotides match if they
are complementary. As alignment score for a pair of alignment
columns, we use a log—scaled likelihood ratio, here deﬁned as the
ratio of the probability pT(i , j) of the two columns i and j, under the
assumption that they are paired, to the probability pT(i)-pT(j) of
the two columns, under the assumption that they are independent,
where both probabilities are conditioned on the phylogenetic tree T.
We deﬁne the score 05 of a segment pair if as given above by

k . .
k, —k
(,5 = 21,,  .
15:0 PT(l+k)‘PT(I—k)
To test if a detected if is in accordance with the second criterion,
the SCFG inside—outside algorithm is applied and both criteria are
used to rate q—stem candidates as described by (Metzler and Nebel,

2008).

3.2 Treatment of gaps

In the current implementation, gaps are treated as missing data,
which means that the likelihood of a tree, given one column with
gaps, is the same as the likelihood of the pruned tree, given the
pruned column. This strategy is straightforward for the calculation
of the probabilities pT(i) of unpaired alignment columns, but during
the calculation of the probability pT(i , j) of column pairs situations
may occur in which only one of the two doublet positions is a gap
symbol. In such cases the corresponding branch is not pruned, but
the remaining doublets that are still possible are assumed to have
a probability of 1. This procedure can cause high probabilities for
column pairs with many gaps, resulting in a prediction where gaps
are paired with nucleotides. To avoid this, we penalize gaps by
multiplying pT(i, j) with a factor (1—6-,u./n)< 1, where n is the
number of aligned sequences, ,u. is the number of column positions
at which one of the two columns provides a gap symbol, and the
parameter 6 can be chosen by the user. In the analyses reported
below we used 6 = 0.7. Simulations indicate, however, that changing
6 to a different value between 0.5 and 1.0 has little effect on the
performance of our method (data not shown).

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Though PhyloQFold is primarily designed for sampling secondary
structures in accordance with their posterior probability, the

following evaluation relies on the most probable folding that
the heuristic optimization process attempts to ﬁnd. Thereby a
comparison to other approaches, which mostly produce one
optimized folding, became possible. The production rules of the
extended SCFG are those as given by (Metzler and Nebel, 2008),
see also online Supplementary Material 1, while the rate matrices
of the evolutionary model are those of (Knudsen and Hein, 1999).
Although there does not exist a perfect method to describe a
confusion matrix of a classiﬁer by a single value, a measure well
established in bioinformatics is Matthews correlation coeﬁicient
(MCC; Matthews, 1975). It can be approximated by the geometric
mean of sensitivity and selectivity (Gorodkin et al., 2001): MCCW

1/1Ti—I13N ~%. Here, sensitivity is the fraction of predicted

position pairs among all pairs of positions given in the reference
folding, whereas selectivity is the fraction of correctly predicted
position pairs among all pairs of positions that are predicted to be
paired with each other. To obtain these frequencies, we compare
the predicted consensus structure to the correct consensus structure,
neglecting all alignment positions that contain gaps (see online
Supplementary Material 2).

4.1 Example for Illustration: RNase P RNA

The RNase P Database by (Brown, 1999) provides a high quality
structural alignment of archaeal RNase P RNAs, which is examined
by extensive comparative analyses (Harris et al., 2001). We
extracted the structural alignment of the four sequences of Acidianus
ambivalens (Sequence 1), Acidianus brierleyi (Sequence 2),
Sulfolobus shibatae (Sequence 3) and Sulfolobus solfataricus
(Sequence 4). We estimated the corresponding phylogenetic tree by
a maximum—likelihood (ML) approach applying a standard 4 X 4
DNA substitution model. Results of applying PhyloQFold to an
alignment of all 41 available archaeal RNase P RNA sequences are
shown in online Supplementary Material 4.1.

Bayesian Sampling: The 20 consensus secondary structures
produced by the Bayesian Sampling procedure of PhyloQFold
indicate that many different consensus structures are possible for
this set of molecules (see online Supplementary Fig. S4).

Posterior pairing probabilities: Figure 1 shows that all of the
column pairs predicted as highly probable (0.8 — 1) are indeed also
given in the database structure, while most of the stems predicted
as unlikely (0.05 —0.4) are not existent.

Most probable folding: the predicted consensus structure obtained
by the simulated annealing procedure together with the correct
structure were put into graphs with the help of the program VARNA
(Darty et al., 2009). Figure 2 reveals a strong similarity between
both foldings, where most of the base pairs were correctly predicted.
In fact all of the predicted stems are also present in the reference
structure including the stem (positions 20—25 and 220—225) that
is responsible for the pseudoknot. Yet some of the base pairs of
the correct structure were not predicted. Since the applied grammar
model only allows for stems consisting of at least three base pairs, the
stems of length two in the reference structure are not provided by the
predicted structure. The performance evaluation of this prediction
led to an MCC value of 0.905.

quality was evaluated with the same sequences as in Section 4.1.
The single lengths of the four sequences range between 259 and
267 nucleotides and their pairwise sequence identities range from
56.3% to 94.6%.

We extracted the structural alignments from the RNase P
Database. With the present analysis we want to treat the case that
a reliable phylogeny is given, but in fact we had to reconstruct
the phylogeny from the given data. To keep the risk of using an
erroneous phylogeny as small as possible, we took the structural
information given in RNase P Database into account in the
phylogeny reconstruction. For this we used the software MrBayes
(version 3.1.2; Huelsenbeck et al., 2001), which allowed us to
apply the standard 4—state nucleotide substitution model for the
loop regions and a 16—state doublet model for the stem regions.
Corresponding to the F 81 model (Felsenstein, 1981) each partition
model assumes the same rate for all of its substitutions. Convergence
of the MCMC processes was examined with the program tracer
(Rambaut A, 2007). Consensus trees were derived from sampled
phylogenies, describing the evolutionary relationship of the subsets
of the RNase P RNA molecules. This dataset made it possible to
investigate the performance, provided that the correct alignment and
phylogeny are known.

The prediction results for this scenario are given in Table 1.
We observed a performance improvement, which correlates with
the amount of employed sequences. The ﬁrst row shows the
results examined by McQFold, whereas the other rows show the
results determined by PhyloQFold. The performances, achieved by
using only single sequences, differ between MCC values of 0.599
and 0.786 with arithmetic mean 0.707. Predictions based on two
sequences achieved an arithmetic mean of 0.809, while the range
is rather large with 0.226. In this category the lowest prediction

result is 0.699, which is still 33.22% superior to the worst single—
sequence prediction. When three sequences were used, the lowest
prediction result is given by a MCC value of 0.778, which is nearly as
good as the best single—sequence prediction. The arithmetic mean is
0. 848. The performance evaluation of the prediction based on all four
sequences led to a MCC value of 0.905, which is an improvement
of 28% compared with the arithmetic mean of the single—sequence
prediction performances.

Fig. 3. MCC values reached by RNAalifold, Pfold, KNetfoId, SimulFold and
IPKnot, each compared with the MCC value that PhyloQFold achieved for
the same test instance. Points below the X = Y line represent test instances
for which PhyloQFold achieved poorer prediction quality, whereas points
above this line indicate greater prediction quality reached by PhyloQFold

ﬁeld of approaches following this strategy, RNAalifold (version with
RIBOSUM scoring; Bernhart et al., 2008; Hofacker et al., 2002)
and Pfold (Knudsen and Hein, 2003) are widely used programs.
The program Pfold applies a SCFG model for secondary structures
combined with an evolutionary model of RNA sequences, whereas
RNAalifold implements a variant of the well—established dynamic—
programming algorithm from (Zuker and Stiegler, 1981). As these
two programs are not able to deal with pseudoknots we also chose
KNetfold (Bindewald and Shapiro, 2006) because it can also predict
base pairs that violate the nested structure of other pairings. It uses
k—nearest neighbor classiﬁers, mutual information and the fraction
of complementary nucleotides of column pairs in a machine learning
framework. The newest program in our comparison is IPKnot
(version 1.2.1; Sato et al., 2011). Moreover, we included SimulFold
(Meyer and Miklés, 2007) because, like PhyloQFold, it follows a
Bayesian MCMC approach.

This comparison is based on the archaeal structure alignment from
the RNase P Database by Brown (1999). The available 41 sequences
were divided into 10 disjunct groups of size 4, while 1 sequence
remained unaffected. For each group the corresponding structural
alignment was extracted. Nine of these structural alignments form
the test set, while one of them was not used, as it possesses 677
columns and is therefore too large for the current version of Pfold.
Since PhyloQFold requires in addition a phylogenetic tree as input
data, for each of these nine alignments the program RAxML was
employed to estimate the phylogeny (Stamatakis et al., 2008). In
SimulFold we chose the options —S —T to sample structures together
with phylogenies while keeping the given alignment ﬁxed. Up to this
exception, all programs were applied with their default parameter
settings. It should be noted that all the caveats mentioned by
(Gardner and Giegerich, 2004) also hold for this comparison.

Figure 3 displays a direct performance comparison between
PhyloQFold and the other programs for each test instance. In 40
out of the 45 comparisons PhyloQFold reached a higher prediction

quality. Pfold supports for three test instances slightly better MCC
values than those reached by PhyloQFold, whereas RNAalifold and
SimulFold achieved for only one test instance a better MCC value.
For all nine test instances KNetfold’s and IPKnot’s predictions are
poorer compared with those of PhyloQFold.

We also compared the performance of the different programs on
alignments of RNAs whose secondary structures (according to the
public databases) do not contain pseudoknots. For 35 alignments
of nuclear yeast RNA sequences from the RNase P database,
PhyloQFold achieved the best average MCC values. On four RNA P
and tRNA alignments that had been used in the study of (Gardner and
Giegerich, 2004) only PFold and RNAalifold, which both assume
the absence of pseudoknots, achieved better MCMC values than
PhyloQFold, and for seven alignments of SPR RNA sequences
(Rosenblad et al., 2009) only RNAalifold and KNetfold showed
a better average performance than PhyloQFold. Details on these
comparisons are given in Section 5.2 of the online Supplementary
Material.

4.4 Simulation study

We performed a simulation study to investigate the qualiﬁcation
of our model and the applied model parameters. By using the
same model parameters for data generation as for the analysis of
the prediction results, an impression of the performance potential
of our method was provided. Furthermore, we applied the same
programs used in Section 4.3 on the simulated data and compared
their prediction results.

For this purpose we simulated 50—folded alignments based on 6
arbitrary trees (see online Supplementary Fig. 815). Although each
phylogeny compasses ﬁve sequences, they vary in their pairwise taxa
distances from 0.006 to 1.8 time units. The length of the simulated
alignments differ between 68 and 410 columns. Since the applied
substitution models do not cover insertion—deletion modelling, the
alignments were generated devoid of gap symbols. To take the ability
of handling gaps into consideration, gaps were included in a post—
simulation process where different probabilities (0.1 and 0.02) were
applied to loop and stem regions in order to change each nucleotide
into a gap symbol. We employed PhyloQFold, RNAalifold, Pfold,
KNetFold SimulFold and IPKnot to the simulated alignments and
compared the quality of their predictions. Again, the phylogenetic
trees for PhyloQFold were estimated with RAxML and SimulFold
was allowed to sample the phylogeny together with the secondary
structures. We also applied PhyloQFold and SimulFold with the
phylogeny ﬁxed to the true tree used in the sequence simulation,
and the results were only marginally different from those obtained
with estimated trees (data not shown).

Figure 4 shows for PhyloQFold, RNAalifold, PFold, KNetFold,
SimulFold and IPKnot the MCC distribution based on simulated
data. PhyloQFold reached the highest median (0.739) which is 11.8—
28.7% greater than the medians of the other programs and showed
the least standard deviation in this value (0.112). The mean MCC
value of PhyloQFold (0.712) is signiﬁcantly higher than those of
RNAalifold (0.603), PFold (0.624), KNetFold (0.562), SimulFold
(0.6) and IPKnot (0.528) (all p—values below 10‘5, one—tailed paired
t—tests with df = 49).

5 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We have presented a method to sample consensus RNA secondary
structures with pseudoknots according to their posterior probability.
PhyloQFold, the implementation of our method, is able to
incorporate the information given by the evolutionary history of
a set of homologous RNA primary structures. We combined an
extended SCFG with an explicit evolutionary model to deﬁne the
prior probability distribution of structures.

The results of the performance comparison for RNase P RNA
data are very encouraging and suggest that PhyloQFold is indeed
competitive with widely used approaches. But even MCC values
around 0.9, which we observed in some of our analyses, imply
that there is still some uncertainty in the inferred secondary
structures. On synthetic data PhyloQFold performed signiﬁcantly
better than the other programs, which may partly be due to
the fact that we generated the folded alignments according to
our model. The mean of PhyloQFold’s MCC values (0.712)
together with the standard deviation in these values (0.112) indicate
the need to assess the uncertainty of each prediction. For this
purpose, PhyloQFold’s Bayesian Sampling procedure calculates
posterior pairing probabilities which give vital information about
the reliability of the structure predictions.

In Section 4.1 we have shown examples where PhyloQFold
was capable of predicting pseudoknots (Fig. 2). This example
has also shown, however, that the minimum length of stems of
three, which is dictated by our grammar rules, can be obstructive.
This issue could be avoided by using a reﬁned grammar model.
Moreover, as all our results were obtained without any parameter
adjustment, there may be some potential for improvement by ﬁtting
the grammar parameters to available data. For SCFG models it
is possible to compute ML estimators for model parameters from
RNA sequences of unknown secondary structure by combining
expectation—maximization with inside—outside algorithms (Eddy
and Durbin, 1994). For our grammar, ML estimation is more difﬁcult
even if trusted secondary structures are given. The reason for this
is the ambiguity of our grammar. Each stem in a structure could
either be a q—stem or a stem generated by the SCFG One possibility

to compute (and then numerically optimize) the likelihood of the
grammar parameters would be to apply MCMC for sampling the
contributions of many possible q—stem conﬁgurations. However, the
fact that the grammar used in McQFold and PhyloQFold has only
four free parameters makes it possible to estimate the parameters
from summary statistics, as for example the numbers and lengths of
loops, stems and pseudoknots in trusted secondary structures. We
provide an example of such a summary—statistic—based parameter
estimation procedure using Approximate Bayesian Computation
(Beaumont et al., 2002; Csillery et al., 2010) on the PhypoFold
homepage. However, given the good performance of PhyloQFold
on RNase P RNA data, it may surprise in the simulation study in
Section 4.4 that PhyloQFold was only slightly better than the other
programs even though it was the only program that ‘knew’ the model
and parameters underlying the simulated data. This indicates that the
beneﬁt of ﬁtting the grammar parameters to data may be limited.

As observed in Section 4.2, the information contained in the
alignment and weighted by the phylogeny of the sequences seems to
improve the quality of our structure estimations. But the alignment
is of crucial importance and the dependency of the alignment
quality implies the conceptual problem shared by all comparative
approaches that are based on a ﬁxed input alignment. In an
application—orientated scenario, where no structural alignment is
at hand, the use of structure—enhanced alignment programs like
R—coffee (Wilm et al., 2008) may be a good choice to estimate the
input alignment. However, a more general solution to this problem
would be to combine PhyloQFold with the Gibbs algorithm (Geman
and Geman, 1984) of SimulFold (Meyer and Miklés, 2007) to
sample from the joint distribution of alignments and secondary
structures.

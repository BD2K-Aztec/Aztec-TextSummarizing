1 BACKGROUND

The discovery of phosphorylation motifs helps to understand the
underlying regulation mechanism and to facilitate the prediction
of unknown phosphorylation sites. Several methods have been
proposed to detect phosphorylation motifs from phosphoproteomics
datasets. A recent article (Wang et al. 2012) published in
Bioinformatics developed a new method MMFPh (Maximal Motif
Finder for Phosphoproteomics Datasets), which aims at identifying
all statistically signiﬁcant motifs and returns the maximal ones
(those not subsumed by motifs with more ﬁxed amino acids). The
empirical comparison with Motif-X (Schwartz and Gygi, 2005) and
Motif—All (He et al. 2011) showed that MMFPh is able to ﬁnd
more important motifs than Motif-X and return less false positives
than Motif—All. Both Motif—All and MMFPh claimed that they can
identify all statistically signiﬁcant motifs. However, the lack of a
precise problem deﬁnition and the ‘completeness’ deﬁnition may
bring some confusions for users to select the appropriate method
for their tasks. In this letter, we like to clarify the difference
of these two methods and show that MMFPh cannot ﬁnd all
(maximal) statistically signiﬁcant motifs even with respect to their
own completeness deﬁnition.

2 PROBLEM DEFINITION

Fundamental to any algorithmic problem, the ﬁrst step is to
provide a precise problem deﬁnition with clearly stated input and
output.

2.1 P1: signiﬁcant and frequent motif discovery

The problem P1 is deﬁned and investigated in Motif-All, with the
following input and output.

0 Input: a set of phosphorylated peptides F (foreground data), a
set of unphosphorylated peptides B (background data), the
signiﬁcance threshold Gsig and the support threshold 9311p.
Suppose we use sig(m) to denote the statistical signiﬁcance
evaluation function and use sup(m) to denote the support
calculation function for each motif m.

0 Output: a set of motifs G, where each meG satisﬁes: (1)
Sig(m) fesig; (2) sup(m) Zesup-

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In the input of problem P1, it is assumed that sig(m) returns a
probability value like p-value for each motif m: the smaller sig(m) is,
the more signiﬁcant the motif m is. Intuitively, sig(m) measures the
over-expressiveness of m in F against B. For instance, the binomial
probability model is used in MMFPh for this purpose. The support
for a motif m is deﬁned as the percentage of phosphorylated peptides
that can match this motif, i.e. sup(m)=occ(m)/ |F|, where occ(m)
is the number of peptides from F that match m and |F | denotes the
size of the set F.

Now we prove the following lemma:

Lemma 1: Motif—All is complete for the P1 problem formulation.
In other words, this algorithm ﬁnds all motifs that have support
values larger than or equal to 9311p and signiﬁcance values smaller
than or equal to 931g.

Proof: the completeness of Motif-All can be shown by the
following two facts. The ﬁrst is that the Apriori algorithm (Agrawal
and Srikant 1994) is complete; that is, all frequent motifs are
enumerated in the 1st step of Motif-All. The second fact is that the
2nd step of Motif-all only prunes motifs whose signiﬁcance values
are larger than asig.

In contrast, the MMFPh algorithm is unable to achieve such a
completeness property for problem P1. Suppose m is a motif that
has k ﬁxed positions. We use m(_1), m(2_1),..., and mig_1) to denote
the motifs that are subsumed by m, and each of them has exactly
k—l ﬁxed positions. That is, the only difference between m and
mé_1) is that the i-th ﬁxed position in m is non—ﬁxed in mé_1). If
all mé_1)s are not signiﬁcant, MMFPh’s motif growing algorithm
(Algorithm 1 in the supplementary document of their paper) will
not check m since each mé_1) has no chance to enter the queue
for possible extension. However, it is possible that m is statistically
signiﬁcant even though all mé_1)s are not signiﬁcant at all. As a
result, MMFPh may miss some motifs that are both frequent and
signiﬁcant, although all its constituent motifs are not signiﬁcant.
Here, we use a simple example to show this fact.

Example 1. Suppose we have the foreground and background data
set as shown in Figure 1. We set the signiﬁcance threshold Gsig = 0.1
and the support threshold 9311p = 0.5 (i.e. the occurrence threshold is
5 in MMFPh). Under such a parameter setting, three frequent motifs
are listed in Table 1 together with their support values, signiﬁcance
values and overall scores. The signiﬁcance value and overall score
are calculated according to Equations (1) and (2) in (Wang et al.
2012), respectively.

According to MMFPh’s motif growing algorithm, it is obvious
that motif (I.....S .... ..) and (.K....S .... ..) will be pruned because their

signiﬁcance values are too large when extending to motifs with only
one ﬁxed residue. Therefore, the motif (IK....S .... ..) cannot even be
constructed to have a test since both (I.....S .... ..) and (.K....S .... ..)
cannot enter the queue. However, from Table 1, motif (IK....S .... ..)
is both signiﬁcant and frequent, either according to Equation (1) or
Equation (2) in (Wang et al. 2012). Clearly, MMFPh misses at least
one motif which is both statistically signiﬁcant and frequent in this
simple example.

Since the objective of MMFPh is to return all maximal,
statistically signiﬁcant and sufﬁciently frequent motifs, which has a
different output from problem P1. Here, we use P2 to denote this
new problem and check if MMFPh can achieve completeness with
respect to P2.

2.2 P2: Maximal, signiﬁcant and frequent motif
discovery

If one motif m is subsumed by another motif n with more ﬁxed
animo acids, we use m g n to denote such relationship. According
to Wang et al. (2012), the problem P2 has the following input and
output.

0 Input: a set of phosphorylated peptides F (foreground data), a
set of unphosphorylated peptides B (background data), the
signiﬁcance threshold 931g and the support threshold 9311p
(MMFPh uses 90cc, where 90cc =93up - |F |).

0 Output: a set of motifs G, where each meG satisﬁes: (1)
sig(m) 5 asig; (2) sup(m) 3 9311p; (3) for any motif n, if m g n,
then sig(n) > QSig or sup(n) < 9311p.

To claim the completeness of MMFPh with respect to P2, one
has to show that it will not miss any motif that satisﬁes all three
requirements in the output. Unfortunately, this is also not true. As
shown in Example 1, (IK....S .... ..) is such a maximal, signiﬁcant
and frequent motif that cannot be reported by MIVIFPh. This fact
illustrates the reason that MMFPh is faster than Motif—All since it
reduces the search space at the cost of missing some signiﬁcant and
frequent motifs.

From the viewpoint of solving P2, the current implementation
of MMFPh should be regarded as a fast algorithm that can
approximately identify most of target motifs. To identify all
maximal, statistically signiﬁcant and sufﬁciently frequent motifs
with MIVIFPh, one has to use a new signiﬁcance evaluation function
that has the so-called ‘downward-closure property’ (Agrawal and
Srikant, 1994). In other words, it can be proved that MMFPh is
able to guarantee the completeness if and only if its signiﬁcance
evaluation function sig(m) has the following property: if sig(m) >
asig, then sig(n) > 931g for any m g n. Unfortunately, most statistical
signiﬁcance evaluation functions do not have such a property.

Alternatively, one general solution is to post-process the output of
Motif—All. More precisely, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the set of all frequent motifs
R using the Apriori—like algorithm. Then, the signiﬁcance value of
each frequent motif in R is calculated to derive a new set of frequent
and signiﬁcant motifs RS. Finally, each motif in RS is returned if it
is not subsumed by any other motif from the same set.

2.3 Summary

Although the MMFPh method is useful, it may miss some (maximal)
statistically signiﬁcant and frequent motifs. Users should be aware
of such risk in selecting the appropriate method for their tasks.

Meanwhile, the complete search of Motif-All may generate
many false positive motifs. To distinguish truly meaningful
phosphorylation motifs from false ones, one needs to perform more
rigorous statistical validation such as permutation test (Gong and He,
2012). However, the problem of accurately and efﬁciently assessing
the statistical signiﬁcance of phosphorylation motifs still remains
unsolved. More research efforts should be devoted to this direction
in future research.

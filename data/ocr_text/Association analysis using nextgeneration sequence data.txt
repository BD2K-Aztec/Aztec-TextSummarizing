ABSTRACT

Motivation: Sufficiently powered case—control studies with next-
generation sequence (NGS) data remain prohibitively expensive for
many investigators. If feasible, a more efficient strategy would be to
include publicly available sequenced controls. However, these studies
can be confounded by differences in sequencing platform; alignment,
single nucleotide polymorphism and variant calling algorithms; read
depth; and selection thresholds. Assuming one can match cases
and controls on the basis of ethnicity and other potential confounding
factors, and one has access to the aligned reads in both groups, we
investigate the effect of systematic differences in read depth and
selection threshold when comparing allele frequencies between
cases and controls. We propose a novel likelihood-based method,
the robust variance score (RVS), that substitutes genotype calls by
their expected values given observed sequence data.

Results: We show theoretically that the RVS eliminates read depth
bias in the estimation of minor allele frequency. We also demonstrate
that, using simulated and real NGS data, the RVS method controls
Type I error and has comparable power to the ‘gold standard’ analysis
with the true underlying genotypes for both common and rare variants.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide case—control association studies with single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can incorporate publicly
available genome-wide control data for comparison to disease
group allele frequencies (The Wellcome Trust Case Control

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Consortium, 2007). This convenient strategy not only increases
statistical power by using larger numbers of controls but also
allows precious resources to be focused on data collection
from diseased individuals. Publicly available genome-wide next-
generation sequence (NGS) data exist [e.g. 1000 Genomes
Project (Abecasis et al., 2012)]; however, it has generally been
used as a tool to identify novel or rare variants in individual
studies, rather than as a control group for association analysis.
One explanation for this underutilization of NGS genotypes for
association may be the bias that results from sequencing cases
and controls with different genomic platforms and protocols;
these biases tend to be less of a concern when using microarray
data if properly accounted for (Sebastiani et al., 2011).

A more commonly implemented design for association with
NGS data is to use sequenced cases for variant discovery and
then genotype the identiﬁed variants in a larger sample of cases
and controls (Liu and Leal, 2012; Longmate et al., 2010; Sanna
et al., 2011). Such two-step sampling designs can be cost effective
and can ensure there is no Type I error inflation. However, this
approach cannot detect protective variants that are present only
in the discovery sample and in general are overly conservative.
Here we develop statistical methodology for a design in which
publicly available sequenced controls are used for association
studies with ‘in-study’ NGS sequenced cases to prioritize variants
for further investigation. Public controls could augment ‘in-
study’ sequenced controls or, in the case that we consider here,
public controls could be the only control group used for analysis.

Possible confounders that could influence findings when using
an external NGS control group in genetic association studies can
be divided into two general categories: (i) those that can be con-
trolled by design considerations such as appropriately matched
control groups on ethnicity (i.e. basic epidemiologic principles
unrelated to the type and production of genetic data); and (ii)
factors directly related to the sequencing and variant calling tech-
nology (Nielsen et al., 2011): base calling procedures (e. g. various
sequencing platforms), alignment (e.g. algorithm and reference
genome), read depth, SNP detection and genotype calling
algorithms (DePristo et al., 2011; Li et al., 2009; McKenna

et al., 2010). For example, large publicly available datasets that
were sequenced at low read depth (LRD) can result in biased
estimation of allele frequencies. This bias diminishes with
increasing read depth (Kim et al., 2011). However, if allele fre-
quencies are compared from variants sequenced with different
read depth in case and control cohorts, false associations may be
generated and true ones masked. Even when average read depth
is similar coverage could vary in individual regions across plat-
forms, samples and experiments. This would likewise bias results
in regions with low coverage in one group by chance, and pre-
clude comparison between cases and controls in regions com-
pletely lacking sequence in one group or the other. Lastly,
differences in SNP discovery and variant calling algorithms can
also lead to spurious association findings. As a consequence of
these shortcomings, statistical methodology designed to assess
association in sequence data has generally required both cases
and controls to be sequenced together using a common platform,
depth and design.

Here, we focus on the technical aspects of comparing allele
frequencies between cases and controls that were sequenced as
part of different projects with different experimental designs.
When the matched case and control groups with their aligned
NGS data (e.g. binary version of Sequence Alignment/MAP
(BAM) files) are available, we can apply the variant calling al-
gorithm to the combined data so that the resulting case and
control data would be well-matched with the exception
of design parameters such as enrichment strategy, sequencing
platform, read depth and resulting coverage (Fig. 1).

It is well-documented that differences in read depth between
cases and controls have large effects on estimation of minor allele
frequency (MAF) and can lead to inﬂated Type I error in asso-
ciation studies (Kim et al., 2011). Less attention has been paid to
the selection threshold used in genotype calling algorithms (gen-
otypers) such as those implemented in Samtools and Genome
Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (DePristo et al., 2011; Li et al.,
2009; McKenna, et al., 2010). These genotypers provide confi-
dence/quality scores for a genotype call (e.g. GQ scores) and
based on these scores and a predetermined threshold, low
confidence/quality calls are filtered out.

To address variant call differences that can occur even within a
study design that sequences cases and controls, one could incorp-
orate read depth or quality score differences into the association
analysis by using a logistic regression analysis with read depth
as a covariate or by weighting each variant call by quality score
(Daye et al., 2012; Garner, 2011). However, in the setting where
cases and controls are distinguishable by read depth, these
approaches are not applicable because they would be con-
founded by case—control status, and the corresponding param-
eters would not be estimable. Another approach to account for
differential read depth is implemented in the GATK toolkit
(http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/gatkdocs/org_broadinstitute_
sting _gatk_walkers_PrintReads.html), which randomly down-
samples BAM files for the higher read depth group. This ap-
proach is a less powerful strategy in comparison with
methodology that incorporates all observed data, as we show
in Section 3.2.

When cases and controls are sequenced as part of the same
experimental design, Skotte et a] (2012) suggest substituting
genotype calls by their expected values given the observed

Fig. 1. Workﬂow proposed for the NGS association analysis when
external NGS control data are used. We assume both case and control
NGS data have passed standard quality control metrics. Asterisk indi-
cates that ideally cases and controls would also be matched on sequencing
platform and enrichment strategy. However, our results in Section 3 in-
dicates that this is not necessary. &Different alignment algorithms are
implicitly accounted for by the RVS because the unit of analysis is geno-
type probability rather than the genotype calls in the association analysis

sequence data. This can result in higher power and better control
of Type I error than methods based on called genotypes, while
taking into account uncertainty in the calls without requiring
filtering by arbitrary quality score thresholds. This approach in-
corporates read depth by constructing the joint likelihood of
observed phenotypes and observed sequence data, and signifi-
cance testing is conducted using a score statistic. This approach,
however, would not control Type I error when there are case—
control differences in read depth because these differences may
produce inflated estimates of the score statistic variance, espe-
cially for rare variants.

In Section 2, we propose the robust variance score (RVS),
which repurposes and extends the approach by Skotte et al.
(2012). In Section 3.1, we illustrate analytically and by simulation
how differences in read depth and variant screening parameters
affect Type I error in association studies using called genotypes.
We then present simulation results under the null and alternative
models for association with single and multiple variants using the
RVS method. In Section 3.2, we show that analysis using the
RVS has comparable power to an analysis with the true geno-
types. In Section 3.3, we apply the RVS to analysis of several
studies using NGS technology, and we compare our findings
with those from association studies using genotype calls with
quality score thresholds.

2 METHODS
2.1 Deﬁning the RVS method

We use a score statistic derived from the joint likelihood of observed
phenotypes and observed sequence data. We assume that for individual
i, the phenotype Y,- depends on the observed sequencing data Dij, through

unobserved genotype GU- (Gl'j is coded 0, 1 and 2) at locus j. The corres-
ponding joint likelihood can be written as

P(Y = (Yl,..., Yn): D = (Dlj,..., 

n 2
= H (2 Pom-1G2- : g)P(G.-j = g, Di»).

i=1 g=0
With logit(P(Y,-|G,-j = g)) = ,80 + ,81 g, the score statistic for ,81 is
S]- = 2:10”, —T’)E(G,le,]-) and the corresponding score test statistic

J- =  is constructed. Calculation of the expected value of genotype
Gy- given the
 = 2:20 gP(G,-j = ngy), which requires estimation of the con-

ditional probability P(G,-j = ngij) 2 W. This probability is

calculated from genotype likelihood probabilities P(D,-J-|G,j= g) and geno-

sequence data Di]- is given by

type frequencies. The conditional probabilities P(D,J-|G,j= g) are provided
in the output of standard genotype calling packages (DePristo et al., 2011;
Li et al., 2009), such as the variant calling format (VCF) ﬁles. They can
also be calculated from the aligned reads by applying the simple Bayesian
genotyper (McKenna et al., 2010). Genotype frequencies P(G,-j = g) are
calculated from the full sample by the EM algorithm (McKenna et al.,
2010; Skotte et al., 2012).

To calculate the test statistics, we also need to calculate the variance of
S]- and, therefore, the variance of E(G,-J-|D,-j). The expected value of the
score statistic is 0 under the null hypothesis because the mean of
E(G,-J-|D,-j) is equal for cases and controls when trait Y,- and genotype
G]- are independent. The law of total variance is deﬁned as
Var(G,-j) = Var(E(G,-J-|D,-j)) + E(Var(G,-J-|D,-j)). The conditional expected
value E(G,j|D,-j) = 2:20 gP(G,j = giDij) converges to the true value of
genotype G]- with high read depth (HRD) because P(G,-j = ngij) goes
to 1 for true GU. Therefore, Var(E(G,j|D,J-)) is converging to the Var(G,-j).
This can also be seen from E( Var(G,j|Dy-)) where, in HRD data, it con-
verges to 0 by the mathematical properties of consistency and conditional
expectation (see Supplementary Fig. S1). When read depth is not sufﬁ-
ciently high, the second term E(Var(G,j|Dy-)) is >0 and the ﬁrst term
Var(E(G,-J-|D,-j)) is smaller than Var(G,-j). Therefore, Var(E(G,-J-|D,-j)) is
read depth-dependent and in low read depth data, variance of
E(G,le,-j) is smaller than the variance of the true genotype.

If cases and controls do not have systematic differences in the read
depth at a given locus, the usual estimate of the variance for S], derived
from logistic regression, can be used. However, if there is a difference in
the variances of E(G,-J-|D,-j) between two groups because of differences
in read depth, the variance estimate of S]- is biased. The bias depends
on the number of samples in the LRD and HRD groups and the
difference in variances between the two groups. For example, for
Ncommg> >Nwse, the variance of the score statistic is underestimated,
whereas if Nwse> >Nwmmg, the variance of the score statistic is over-
estimated. As a consequence, variance estimation of the score statistics
must distinguish between the two groups.

We propose to estimate variance of the conditional expectation for
cases and controls separately, as we derive in Appendix A. Brieﬂy, to
achieve the variance robustness when the number of cases is smaller than
the number of controls, we propose to estimate Varmse(E(G,-J-|D,-j)) by
Var(G,'J-) with estimated genotype frequencies P(G,-j = g), and we estimate
the variance of the conditional expectation for controls by the sample
variance of E(G,-J-|D,-j) in the controls (see details in Appendix A).

Similarly, we use the score statistic SJ- : Z?21(Y,—T7)E(GU|D,J-) to
construct the test statistics for jointly analyzing several rare variants
using standard published approaches (Basu and Pan, 2011; Lee et al.,
2012; Madsen and Browning, 2009; Morgenthaler and Thilly, 2007; Neale
et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2011), which are in general comparable (Derkach
et al., 2012). Similar to the single variant analysis, we can estimate the
variance of S:(S1,m_,SJ), deﬁned as the score statistic for J rare

variants. In this case, we combine the covariance matrices estimated sep-
arately for cases and controls by the same principle as in single variant
analysis.

For common variants, P-Values can be computed using the asymptotic
distribution of the score test statistic, which is chi-square with 1 degree of
freedom. For rare variants, the asymptotic chi-square approximation to
the distribution of the score statistic T]- =  is often inadequate, and a
permutation procedure is preferred (Basu and Pan, 2011; Derkach et al.,
2012). However, permutation cannot be used when the observed data
consist of an external control group because the distribution of
E(G,le,-j) will then depend on read depth (Appendix A). Instead, we

could calculate P-Values using the bootstrap, where we sample centered
values E(G,-J-|D,-j) — E(G,-J-|D,-j) with replacement, separately for cases and
controls. For joint rare variant analysis, instead of sampling E(G,-J-1D,-j) for
a single variant, we sample with replacement a centered vector of values
(E(G,-11D,-1) —E(G,-1lDil),...,E(G,11D,J) —E(G,J-1D,J)) for the case and
control groups separately. P-Value computation is based on 10 000 repli-
cates. This non-parametric approach is also used to test the equality
of two sample means without assuming equality of the distributions
(Hall and Hart, 1990).

2.2 Simulation methodology

We simulated sequence reads based on the simple Bayesian genotyper as
described in Appendix B. We assume all cases are sequenced at HRD and
all controls are sequenced at LRD. In cases, read depth is simulated using
a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and an SD of 10. In the control
group, read depth is normally distributed with a mean of 4 and an SD of
1 (minimum read depth is set to 1). For each individual’s locus, we gen-
erate a ‘true’ genotype, and then for that genotype, we generate sequence
reads. The distribution of the reads given the genotype is described in
Appendix B. Measurement error is present in the reads with the kth error
ek following a normal distribution with a mean of 0.01 and an SD of
0.025. Then, from the generated sequenced reads, the simple Bayesian
genotyper is used to call the genotype. The likelihood equations are also
constructed from these sequence reads, and then we implement the RVS
to evaluate Type I error and power.

For the simulations under the null model, we generate geno-
types for each individual’s locus based on the same MAF regardless
of case or control status. For the simulations under the alterna-
tive model, we calculate MAF at the speciﬁc locus for the case and
control groups separately. Speciﬁcally, we assume that
P(Y1 = 1|X,-,~) = exp(,80+,BlX,-j)/(1 + exp(,80 + elm-,1), where, for ex-
ample, ,80 = log(0.1/(1 — 0.1)) and ,81 = log(1.5), and these values cor-
respond to P( Y,- = 11X ,1- = 0) equal to 0.1 and the odds ratio (OR) for a
causal variant equal to 1.5.

2.2.] Simulation parameters and association analysis Simulations
vary as a function of sample size, case control ratios and MAF. Speciﬁc
scenarios are provided in Table 1. To understand the effect of differential
read depth for ﬁxed MAF using genotype calls, we simulate 1000 variants
to have the same MAF, and genotype calling is done with various selec-
tion thresholds (e. g. R = 0, 0.5 or 1, see Appendix B). Association analysis
using the genotype calls is conducted using the conventional score statistic
(Arrnitage, 1955).

Single variant association analysis of the simulated data is conducted
using (i) a score statistic with the true genotypes, (ii) the RVS method and
(iii) a genotype likelihood approach that does not implement the robust
variance estimate (Skotte et al., 2012). We calculate P-Values from the
RVS using bootstrap. The corresponding P-Values from analysis with
true genotypes and the genotype likelihood approach are calculated Via
permutation. P-Value computations are based on 10000 replicates. We
assess the performance of the RVS as a function of sample size (Table 1).

rare variant analysis

 

Note: All cases are simulated to be sequenced at HRD and all controls at LRD.

In joint rare variant analysis, we collapse ﬁve rare variants with MAF
ranging from 0.001 to 0.05 and performance is evaluated across 10000
replicates. We use the cohort allelic sums test (CAST) (Morgenthaler and
Thilly, 2007) as an example of a linear statistic and C-alpha (Neale et al.,
2011) as an example of a quadratic statistic. We compare results from an
analysis that uses the true genotypes with the RVS test that use the
genotype likelihood-derived score statistic with the robust variance, as
described in Section 2.1.

To assess power and Type I error, we use 1000 and 10 000 simulated
replicates, respectively. For simulations under the null model, we assess
the deviation of P-Values from a uniform distribution in quantile—quantile
(QQ) plots. In the analysis with genotype calls, we also assess the effect on
Type I error when variants with low conﬁdence/quality scores are ﬁltered
based on a selection threshold (see detailed description of conﬁdence
scores and selection thresholds in Appendix B). We evaluate power to
detect association under various scenarios using the RVS method and
compare our ﬁndings with the power we obtain using the true genotypes
as the gold standard (Table 1).

2.3 NGS study data

2.3.] Data from the 1000 Genomes Project To make comparisons
between two independently sequenced samples with different enrichment
strategies under the null hypothesis, we consider data from the 1000
Genomes Project using samples of European descent (CEU+GBR).
Aligned reads from chromosome 11 are downloaded from the Phase 3
release [20130502]. One sample consists of exome data from 56 individ-
uals (average read depth ~50), and the other sample includes 113 indi-
viduals who were sequenced at LRD (~6.5). A multisample VCF ﬁle was
generated using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, version 2.4-9)

(DePristo et al., 2011; McKenna et al., 2010) on the combined set of
the aligned reads to identify SNPs and Indels in the samples. We excluded
variants satisfying any of the following criteria: variants with phred scaled
probability <30 (Qual<30), with phred-scale strand bias P-Value by
Fisher’s exact test >60 (FS> 60) and low quality depth QD<2.
Additional ﬁltering parameters are presented in Supplementary Table
S8. From the VCF ﬁles, we extract the individual genotype calls and
their corresponding genotype likelihoods. To study the effect of ﬁltering
on Type I error inﬂation, we also analyzed datasets removing genotype
calls with a quality score <5 and 10 (GQ< 5, 10). The GQ value is the
phred quality score —10[og10P(genetype call is wronglvariant). Therefore,
GQ=5 and GQ= 10 correspond to R=0.5 and R: 1, as deﬁned in
Appendix B. Here we restrict analysis to biallelic loci and variants that
have 520% missing calls, and compare association results using the geno-
type calls and the RVS constructed from the likelihoods supplied in the
VCF ﬁle. In Supplementary Table S8, we provide the number of variants
analyzed in each dataset.

2.3.2 NGS Sequencing in a Rolandic epilepsy-associated
region Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is a childhood-onset epilepsy, and its
electroencephalography (EEG) endophenotype is linked and associated
with a 600 kb chromosomal region of 11p13 from 31 243 672 to 31 893 146
using NCBI Human Reference Assembly build 37 (Strug et al., 2009). To
evaluate the reliability of using the RVS with an external control group in
an associated region, we compare 27 HRD RE cases with 113 LRD NGS
controls from the 1000 Genomes Project.

We obtained targeted resequencing data on 27 RE patients of
European descent, ascertained in the northeastern USA. The 600 kb
region of chromosome 11p13 was enriched using long-range PCR. The
multiplex samples were then resequenced on the Illumina GAIIX

platform with an average read depth of 197x by deCODE Scientiﬁc
Services (Iceland). Thirty-six base-pair end reads were aligned to a
700 kb region of 11p13 using the Novoalign algorithm within the
GATK analysis pipeline (DePristo et al., 2011; McKenna et al., 2010).
Here we compare the RE cases with the 113 controls of European descent
from the 1000 Genomes Project, Phase 3 release [20130502]. A multisam-
ple VCF ﬁle was produced using GATK’s Uniﬁed Genotyper module on
the combined set of aligned reads to identify variant sites in the samples.
Only biallelic variants are analyzed here. Additional ﬁltering parameters
and the number of variants categorized by MAF threshold 0.05 are in
Supplementary Table S9. Given there are only 27 RE cases sequenced, we
focus on variants with MAF >0.05. We then selected the 491 SNPs that
have 520% missing calls and have estimated MAF >0.05. Likelihood
information from the VCF ﬁle was used to implement the RVS method
to compare the two groups.

For comparison, we assess the association evidence using genotype
calls from the 27 epilepsy cases and an independent sample of 200 colo-
rectal cancer cases from the UK, whole-genome sequenced by Complete
Genomics. Sequencing was performed at high coverage (70% of the
genome with an average 35 X) using unchained combinatorial probe
anchor ligation chemistry on arrays of self-assembling SNA nanoballs
(Drrnanac et al., 2010). In this case we did not have access to locus-
speciﬁc coverage information. We investigate the variant call set in a
sample spanning the 600 kb region of interest at 11p13. In this dataset
we have 453 variant sites with 520% missing calls and estimated MAF
>0.05 available for analysis.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Theoretical and empirical investigations of the effect
of read depth and selection threshold differences

To guide our theoretical investigations, without loss of generality,
we assign A and C to be major and minor alleles, respectively. For
simplicity assume that all reads are sequenced without errors
(ek = 0 for k = 1, ...,r,]~). Under this setting, if rij reads consist
of minor and major allele calls, then the genotype call is always
set to AC. We assume that the true genotype at the locus is CC
and all rij reads consist of the minor allele C. From Appendix B,
the likelihoods for the genotypes AA, AC and CC are
L(D,)~|AA) = 0, L(D,]~|AC) = (1 /2)’1 and L(D,-,~|CC) = 1, where
Di]- consists of rij reads all equal to C. The posterior probabilities
are equal to P(AA|D,]~) = 0, P(AC|D,-j) = (1 /2)’v' - P(AC)/P(D,j)
and P(C C |D,-j) = P(CC)/P(D,-j). By ignoring P(Dy) and assuming
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) with P(C) = pj and
P(A) = qj, we rewrite the posterior probabilities as
P(AA|D,]~) = 0, P(AC|D,-j) = (1 /2)r’72quj and P(CC‘DU) :19}.
The genotype call is chosen to be CC if
P(CCjDij) =p12>P(AC|D,-j) = 2quj(1/2)"7, and it is miscalled
as A otherwise. This implies that for a variant with read depth

rij and a speciﬁc MAF p]. < H+

,ij_,, the rare homozygous genotype
can be misclassiﬁed as a heterozygote. Naturally, this kind of
misclassiﬁcation leads to underestimated MAFs, and the degree
of bias decreases with MAF as the number of rare homozygous
genotypes decreases. For a given read depth, Table 2 provides the
MAF threshold below which rare homozygous genotypes are
misclassiﬁed.

The degree of bias in the estimation of MAF is also related to
the selection threshold R, which screens out calls with low con-
ﬁdence scores. With a selection threshold R=0, estimation of
MAF is affected mainly by misclassiﬁed rare homozygous calls.

Fig. 2. QQ plot for P-values from an association study with 50 HRD
cases and 150 LRD controls, as a function of MAF. P-values are calcu-
lated by the score statistic on 1000 variants using called genotypes. R is
the selection threshold

However, with R>0, those misclassiﬁed calls are often ﬁltered
out because of low conﬁdence/quality scores. This suggests the
estimated MAF would be further underestimated because of
screening out some misclassiﬁed calls and some weak true
calls. Similarly, sequencing error, which is not modeled in this
theoretical investigation, would further affect estimation of
MAF because posterior probabilities for genotypes with rare al-
leles are affected. Our empirical investigations do incorporate
sequencing error (Section 3.2).

These theoretical ﬁndings have particular implications when
case and control samples differ systematically: (i) If cases and
controls are sequenced with the same read depth but two differ-
ent selection thresholds are applied, spurious results can occur
for some MAFs. (ii) If both cases and controls are sequenced
with different read depths but the same selection threshold,
R>0, is applied, spurious results can also occur for some
MAFs. (With R = 0, for variants with MAF larger than the crit-
ical MAF provided in Table 2, the analysis is unlikely to produce
spurious results.) (iii) For a given read depth, at variants with
MAF below the threshold (Table 2), spurious association results
are more likely for all R because of bias in MAF estimation.

Our simulation study conﬁrms our theoretical conclusions and
further investigates the relationship between read depth rij, selec-
tion threshold R and Type I error. As the theoretical derivations

predicted, deviation in QQ plots or the extent of bias in the esti-
mation of a given variant’s MAF depends largely on the MAF
(Fig. 2). The main contributor to the deviation in the QQ plots is
that the rare homozygotes are in most cases screened out (R: l
and 0.5) or miscalled (R: 0) in the LRD control sample. A de-
viation of P-Values from the expected uniform distribution is less
apparent when MAF is large (e.g. Fig. 2; MAF:0.4); this is
because of less misspeciﬁcation/ﬁltering for large MAF (as
seen in Table 2).

To conﬁrm that a deviation in P-Values from uniform exists in
the absence of ﬁltering (R: 0), we considered analysis in larger
samples. Analysis of simulated replicates with 500 HRD cases
and 1500 LRD controls conﬁrms our theoretical prediction
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Larger deviations from expected are
observed in larger sample sizes where the differences in estimated
MAF between cases and controls are ampliﬁed and the greatest
bias occurs when the MAF is ~0.2.

3.2 Empirical investigation of RVS

We begin our empirical investigation of the properties of the
RVS approach by showing that it controls Type I error under
a variety of settings. As predicted, the P-Values from the geno-
type likelihood approach (Skotte et al., 2012) are inﬂated when
the number of LRD controls is larger than the number of cases
(Fig. 3B and D). This inﬂation increases as the case control ratio
decreases. In contrast, P-Values from the RVS using the boot-
strap are not affected because it uses the robust variance estimate
(Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S1).
For example, for a test size of 0.01, the empirical Type 1 error for
RVS is 0.0094. The Type I error is slightly conservative for the
analysis of single rare variants using RVS, but this is as expected
and remains the case even when the true genotypes are analyzed
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and Supplementary Table S2). This

indicates that both permutation and bootstrap approaches are
conservative when there is sparsity in the data. A similar result is
observed when asymptotic distributions are used to compute
P-Values (Supplementary Fig. S4). In contrast to single rare vari-
ant analysis, when ﬁve rare variants are grouped for analysis,
Type I errors resulting from the bootstrap and permutation
approaches are well controlled (Fig. 4 and Supplementary
Tables S3 and S4). Investigations with smaller sample sizes mag-
nify these observations (Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6 and
Supplementary Table S5).

For common variants, the RVS method is comparable in
power with the score test applied to the true genotypes
(Table 3). When a single rare variant is considered, both the
score test applied to the true genotypes and the RVS have
substantially less power than joint analysis (Supplementary
Table S6). When we jointly analyze ﬁve rare variants by CAST

and the quadratic test C-alpha, a noticeable improvement in
power is apparent (Table 4). Not surprisingly, results from
single and joint rare variant analysis indicate that analysis
using the RVS is not as powerful as the score statistic with the
true genotypes, when the number of controls is larger than the
number of cases. This is because genotype frequencies used in the
posterior are estimated from the observed case control data, and
the accuracy of these estimates is affected when read depth is
low. We also note that the RVS method, in most cases, has
similar power to an analysis with the true genotypes with test
sizes between 0.05 and 0.0001.

We also consider an empirical power comparison between
the RVS method with HRD cases and LRD controls, and con-
ventional logistic regression where both groups have the same
average LRD (4x). We consider this analysis to illustrate that
downsampling HRD cases to the same average read depth as
controls reduces power. Results in Table 5 (500 cases and
500/1500 controls at MAF:0.l) and Supplementary Table S7
(500 cases and 500/1500 controls at MAF:0.01) indicate that

licates. We use 10269 SNPs that have MAF >0.05, missing rate smaller
than 20% and are present in both datasets

using RVS in studies with HRD cases is a more powerful strategy
than using logistic regression in studies with LRD in both case
and control groups.

3.3 Application of the RVS method

3.3.] 1000 Genomes Project data We used two publicly avail-
able datasets from the 1000 Genomes Project: 56 HRD exome
sequencing and 113 LRD whole genome sequencing at llpl3 to
assess the Type I error inﬂation using RVS under the null
hypothesis. We compare results for single SNP analysis of
common variants (MAF>0.05) and rare variant analysis using
groups of ﬁve rare variants (MAF<0.05).

A comparison of P-Values from common variants using the
RVS method with those from the score statistic using genotype
calls that are not ﬁltered (R : 0) indicates that the RVS controls
Type I error well (Fig. 5). Results from these two analyses are
similar, although analysis with unﬁltered genotype calls results in
several false-positive variants. These spuriously associated vari-
ants would have been ﬁltered out had genotype quality ﬁlters
been applied. However, as we observed in our simulations and
our theoretical ﬁndings, ﬁltering also results in increasing Type I
error inﬂation, as a function of more stringent quality thresholds.
Filtering can also signiﬁcantly reduce the number of variants
for analysis, which would reduce power. For example, with
GQ:10 (R:l), we analyze only 1760 common SNPs (see
Supplementary Fig. S7). The RVS does not require any ﬁltering
and analyzes the observed data as is.

It should be noted that the inﬂation in Type I error is only
marginal in Figure 5, consistent with our theoretical predictions.
There is a reasonably high average read depth for the 10 269
variants analyzed in the ‘LRD’ control group (7.5x versus
71x for the HRD control group; Supplementary Fig. S8 and
Supplementary Table S8). With a read depth of 8, the theoretical

calculations indicate that it is unlikely to have a biased estimate
of MAF for variants with MAF >0.007. Individual variants
within these 10 269 that are sequenced with lower read depth
than 7x contribute to the slightly inﬂated Type I error, high-
lighting the important point that average read depth is not suf-
ﬁcient to assume unbiased estimation of MAF at all loci when
using genotype calls for analysis.

Figure 6 compares the results for joint rare variant analysis
using the linear statistic (CAST) between (i) the RVS method and
(ii) the score statistic using genotype calls with ﬁltering thresh-
olds as R:0, R:0.5 and R: l. The RVS approach controls
the Type I error well, while P-Values are inﬂated in all three

scenarios with genotype calls. The ﬁltering reduces the overall
inﬂation in Type I error, at the expense, however, of signiﬁcantly
reducing the number of rare variants that can be analyzed, from
14850 for RVS and R:0, to 11285 and 2585 for R=0.5, 1,
respectively, suggesting ﬁltering can negatively impact power.
Results from analysis with quadratic statistics are similar
(Supplementary Fig. S9).

3.3.2 Association in targeted resequencing of individuals with
Rolandic epilepsy Last, we are interested in how the RVS per-
forms in a region of association with the RE EEG endopheno-
type. We identify variants from the aligned reads of our 27 RE
cases and 113 LRD whole genome-sequenced individuals from
the 1000 Genomes Project. In addition, we have access to geno-
type calls in 200 HRD controls sequenced by Complete
Genomics. A summary of the number of variants analyzed
with our cases and each control group indicates similar identiﬁ-
cation of variants with MAF >0.05 (Supplementary Table S9).
We compare the top-ranked variants by the RVS method using
the 1000 Genomes Project LRD control group, with the top
rankings based on an analysis that implements the conventional
score statistic using genotype calls with the 200 HRD controls
sequenced by Complete Genomics. Table 6 indicates that the
top-ranked variants are similar across the two analyses; that is,
using the RVS with LRD controls indicates similar prioritization
of variants for follow-up to an analysis with genotype calls from
two HRD sequenced samples in an associated region. The LRD
group is smaller than the HRD control group, which may
explain why the P-Values from the RVS are slightly larger.

4 DISCUSSION

Publicly available genome-wide microarray datasets have been
widely used as controls in genome-wide association studies (The
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007). Here we pro-
vide a new method, the RVS, to test for association in studies
that use NGS from external control groups. Confounding factors
associated with NGS data processing, such as SNP and genotype
calling algorithms, read depth and selection parameters can all
contribute to spurious or masked ﬁndings. Here we focus on
statistical adjustment for the bias in MAF estimation (and con-
sequently Type I error) introduced by differential read depth
between cases and controls, and the selection threshold. In the
absence of a uniﬁed study design for sequencing cases and con-
trols, using theoretical and empirical investigations, we show that
the RVS is a useful tool to incorporate external control groups in
genetic association studies with NGS data, in an effort to priori-
tize sequence variants for follow-up.

The RVS can be used for single variant or joint rare variant
analysis, and does not require arbitrary selection of parameter
values for ﬁltering but rather analyzes all observed data. The
Type I error associated with the RVS is well controlled by the
use of robust variance estimates, and the power is comparable to
analyses using genotypes called without error.

Our theoretical and simulation results indicate that systematic
differences between cases and controls lead to spurious results in
association analysis using genotype calls from NGS technology.
The degree of deviation in P-Value distribution from expected
under the null hypothesis depends on MAF, difference in read

depth and the applied selection threshold. Particularly, when
R:0, genotype call-based association analyses can be applied
for some variants even when there is a signiﬁcant difference in
read depth between cases and controls (Fig. 2 and Table 2).
Table 2 provides lower bounds on MAF at which point MAF
estimates from low read depth data remain close to the true
value. However, using these theoretical predictions to justify ana-
lysis at certain MAFs would perforce preclude analysis at the
remaining variants because the biased allele frequency estimation
for the remaining data would remain unaccounted for. A HRD
control group with ample coverage to allow a selection threshold
(i.e. R> 0) can be used to avoid this bias; however, this does not
ensure that there is ample read depth in cases and controls at
every locus.

To address systematic difference in read depth, the GATK
toolkit (http: //www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/gatkdocs/org_broad
institute_sting_gatk_walkers_PrintReads.html) proposes to ran-
domly downsample BAM ﬁles for the higher read depth group.
This approach is a less powerful strategy in comparison to meth-
odology that incorporates all observed data as we show in
Section 3.2. Other methods that use logistic regression analysis
with read depth as a covariate, or by weighting each variant call
by quality score (Daye et al., 2012; Garner, 2011), as well as
methods that substitute genotype calls by their expected values
(Skotte et al., 2012) are only applicable if both groups are not
distinguishable by read depth and sequencing error.

We implement the RVS in a case—control study with 27 HRD
cases and 113 LRD controls. The top-ranked variants are in
agreement with an association study based on genotype calls
from the 27 HRD cases and 200 HRD controls. However, as
was the case in the present study, if one has access only to geno-
type calls, as opposed to the aligned BAM ﬁles or the raw data,
only variants with genotype calls present in both datasets can be
analyzed; this could potentially be restrictive. For example,
rs603202 in Table 6 was sequenced in the 1000 Genomes
Project controls and epilepsy cases, but calls at this SNP in
the Complete Genomics control group are absent. Without
additional information about locus-speciﬁc coverage in the
Complete Genomics control set, we are not able to determine
whether the missing variant is monomorphic in the sample or
there was simply no sequencing coverage. Coverage information
is integrated into the RVS analysis of the aligned reads.

Currently the RVS cannot accommodate covariate adjust-
ment, and this will be an area of future development. The RVS
is easily extendable to accommodate a design in which a subset of
controls is sequenced alongside the cases in addition to incorpor-
ating an external control group. This type of study design may
prove preferable to assess the comparability of the external con-
trol group; this more costly approach, however, requires a formal
evaluation. Ensuring the comparability of the case and control
groups on the basis of epidemiologic principles is paramount.
This assumption requires careful consideration before moving
forward with any statistical analysis.

Ideally, cases and controls would also be matched on sequen-
cing platform and enrichment strategy; however, our results
indicate that this is not necessary because the RVS adjusts for
differences in variability and missing rates because of platform/
enrichment differences. We suggest that when cases and con-
trols are sequenced using different technologies, conducting

association analysis with a second control group can provide
conﬁdence that systematic bias due to platform/enrichment dif-
ferences is not driving the observed signals. Different alignment
algorithms are implicitly accounted for by the RVS because
the unit of analysis is the genotype probability rather than the
genotype calls in the association analysis.

Whole genome sequencing of large samples remains cost pro-
hibitive for many investigators. Using external control groups in
NGS association studies, to augment a smaller set of sequenced
controls or as the only control set for comparison, can reserve
precious resources for the sequencing of cases. Therefore, if NGS
service providers (or other public initiatives) make control sam-
ples available to customers (or the public), then the RVS makes it
feasible to use external control groups in association studies with
NGS data.

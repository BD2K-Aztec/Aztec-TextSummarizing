Abstract

Motivation: The de novo identification of the initiation and termination zones—regions that replicate
earlier or later than their upstream and downstream neighbours, respectively—remains a key chal—
lenge in DNA replication.

Results: Building on advances in deep learning, we developed a novel hybrid architecture
combining a pre—trained, deep neural network and a hidden Markov model (DNN—HMM) for
the de novo identification of replication domains using replication timing profiles. Our results dem—
onstrate that DNN—HMM can significantly outperform strong, discriminatively trained Gaussian
mixture model—HMM (GMM—HMM) systems and other six reported methods that can be applied to
this challenge. We applied our trained DNN—HMM to identify distinct replication domain types,
namely the early replication domain (ERD), the down transition zone (DTZ), the late replication do—
main (LRD) and the up transition zone (UTZ), using newly replicated DNA sequencing (Repli—Seq)
data across 15 human cells. A subsequent integrative analysis revealed that these replication do—
mains harbour unique genomic and epigenetic patterns, transcriptional activity and higher—order
chromosomal structure. Our findings support the ‘replication—domain’ model, which states (1)
that ERDs and LRDs, connected by UTZs and DTZs, are spatially compartmentalized structural and
functional units of higher—order chromosomal structure, (2) that the adjacent DTZ—UTZ pairs form
chromatin loops and (3) that intra—interactions within ERDs and LRDs tend to be short—range and
long—range, respectively. Our model reveals an important chromatin organizational principle of the
human genome and represents a critical step towards understanding the mechanisms regulating
replication timing.

delay genomic replication, resulting in various diseases (Bicknell
et al., 2011a, b; Guernsey et al., 2011; Letessier et al., 2011) and
even cancer (Suzuki and Takahashi, 2013; Woo and Li, 2012).

The initiation and termination zones may be identified from the
replication timing profiles as regions that replicate earlier or later,
respectively, than their upstream and downstream neighbours
(Schwaiger et al., 2009). The timing of the replication of a given
DNA sequence is determined by its distance from the local active
replication origin and by the timing of the firing of that origin dur-
ing the S phase (Schwaiger et al., 2009). Genome—wide replication
timing profiles have been used to identify replication origins
throughout Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Raghuraman et al., 2001)
and in higher eukaryotes, including Drosophila (MacAlpine et al.,
2004; Schubeler et al., 2002; Schwaiger et al., 2009), mice (Farkash—
Amar et al., 2008) and human (Audit et al., 2007; Karnani et al.,
2007; Lucas et al., 2007; Woodfine et al., 2005). These studies re—
vealed that the timing of DNA replication is associated with tran—
scriptional activity, epigenetic patterns and higher—order nuclear
structures. However, the genomic, epigenetic and transcriptional
signatures that define the early late replication domain (ERDs) and
late replication domain (LRD) in the human genome have not been
fully elucidated. In particular, the strengths of the correlations be—
tween replication timing and the chromatin status within ERD and
LRD across diverse human cell types remain unclear. Furthermore,
the molecular mechanisms through which the chromatin patterns
are established and maintained within the ERD and LRD in the
human genome remain poorly understood. Resolving these ques—
tions completely depends on the precise identification of the ERD
and LRD in the human genome, which remains one of the greatest
challenges in bioinformatics research. To date, very few bioinfor—
matics methods have been proposed for the de novo identification of
replication domains using replication timing profiles.

Recently, deep learning approaches have surpassed the state—
of—the—art performance of previous methods for many tasks (Bengio
et al., 2013), due to their powerful capacity to automatically learn
features at multiple levels of abstraction directly from data without
using human—crafted features or rules (Bengio, 2009). The Deep
Neural Network (DNN) was developed from the Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) with the advent of the deep learning algorithm
(Bengio, 2009; Bengio et al., 2013). Compared with a shallow—
learning model that included an ANN and Gaussian mixture model
(GMM), the deep learning model, i.e. DNN, consists of multiple
hidden layers showing significantly greater power to representation
data than the shallow model and is widely applied in computer vi—
sion, dimensionality reduction and speech recognition. In addition,
hidden Markov models (HMMs) are well known for their effective—
ness in the modelling of sequential patterns of data and have been
extensively applied in computational biology, specifically in biolo-
gical sequence analysis, Copy Number Variation detection, motif
finding, breakpoints identification and chromatin state discovery.
These advances triggered our interest in developing a novel hybrid
architecture between a pre—trained DNN and an HMM for the de
novo identification of replication domains using replication timing
profiles.

In this study, we present the first DNN—HMM hybrid model,
which combines the representational power of DNNs and the sequen—
tial modelling capacity of HMMs to successfully resolve the challenge
of the de novo identification of replication domains using newly repli-
cated DNA sequencing (Repli—Seq) data. We demonstrate that DNN—
HMMs can significantly outperform strong discriminatively trained
GMM—HMM systems and other six reported methods that can be
applied to this challenge. We applied our trained DNN—HMM to the

identification of distinct types of replication domains, including
the ERD, the down transition zone (DTZ), the LRD, and the up tran-
sition zone (UTZ), using Repli—Seq data across 15 human cell types.
A subsequent integrative analysis based on ENCODE data revealed
that the replication domains of distinct types harbour unique genomic
and epigenetic patterns, transcriptional activity and higher-order
chromosomal structure. Our findings support the ‘replication—
domain’ model, which states that ERDs and LRDs, connected by UTZs
and DTZs, are spatially compartmentalized structural and functional
units of higher—order chromosomal structure. In our model, the adjacent
DTZ—UTZ pairs form a chromatin loop, and intra—interactions within
ERDs and LRDs tend to be short— and long—range, respectively. Our
model reveals an important chromatin organizational principle of the
human genome and represents a critical step towards increasing our
understanding of the mechanisms regulating replication timing.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Deep belief networks

In contrast to the discriminative nature of traditional neutral nets,
deep belief networks (DBNs), initially introduced by Hinton et al.
(2006), are probabilistic generative models. DBNs consist of several
layers of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) (Hinton, 2009),
which are a type of undirected bipartite graph constructed from a
bottom layer of binary stochastic hidden units h and a top layer of
stochastic visible units V. For an RBM, an energy function is as-
signed to the configurations of V and h, and this function is of the
following form

E(v, h) = —bTv — cTh — vTWh, (1 )

where W is the symmetrical matrix of visible/hidden connection
weights and b and c are the biases of the visible and hidden units, re—
spectively. Thus, the probability distribution of any particular set—
ting of v and h is

e—E(V,h)
Z 7

 

P (V, 11) = (2)

_E(V=h) is known as the

where the normalization factor Z : th e
partition function. The bipartite and binary natures of RBMs enable

us to derive simple exact expressions for P(v|h) and P(h|v) as
P(h = 1|v) = 0 (c + vTW) (3)
and
P(v = 1|h) = a (b + hTWT), (4)

respectively, where 0' denotes the (elementwise) logistic sigmoid
and equals 0'  = (1 —I— e_x)_1.

In our algorithm, RBMs were trained in a greedy layer—wise
manner with one—step contrastive divergence (CD—1). We used the
DBN weights resulting from RBMs to initialize DNNs generatively
in a purely unsupervised way and used the outputs of DBN as the in—
puts to train the Softmax output layer in a supervised manner. After
pre—training, we used a backpropagation algorithm to fine—tune all
of the weights in a supervised manner to improve the discriminative
performance of the entire network. Pre—training followed by sto—
chastic gradient descent is used to train DNN because it often out—
performs random initialization for the deeper architectures and
provides robust results to the initial random seed. Studies have illus—
trated that using DBN pre—training to initialize the weights of a
DNN helps prevent overfitting and can aid in subsequent

optimization and can reduce generalization error (Erhan et al.,
2010; Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006). This semi—supervised ap—
proach using deep models has proved effective in a number of appli-
cations, including coding and classification for speech, audio, text
and image data.

2.2 DNN—HMM architecture

An HMM is a generative model in which the system is assumed to
be generated from a Markov process that transitions between states
S = [$1, ... ,SK]. An HMM is a triple (TC, A, B), where TC is the initial
state probability distribution, A is the state transition probability
distribution and B is the observation probability distribution. For an
HMM, B is defined as

bI-(Ot) = Ho. | q. = 5,.) z 

7 léiéN, (5)
where O, is the observation at location t, qt is the state at location t
and S,- is the j th state of the N states in total, p(qt : S,- | 0,) is the
state posterior probability and p(qt : Si) is the prior probability of
each state.

Figure 1A shows the architecture of our proposed DNN—HMMs,
which is trained using the embedded Viterbi algorithm. The main
steps involved are summarized in Figure 1B. The key difference be-
tween the DNN—HMM architecture and earlier ANN—HMM hybrid

In our hybrid model, p(qt : S,- | 0,) is estimated from the DNN, p(qt
: 5,) can be easily estimated from the training set, and [)(Ot) is inde-
pendent of the state and can thus be ignored without any inﬂuence on
the result when using the Viterbi algorithm to find the optimal state.
Notably, we found that the prior probability p(qt : Si) is very import-
ant in alleviating the label bias problem.

2.3 Identification of replication domains using
DNN—HMM

We used Repli—Seq data to derive four different types of replication
domains, including the ERD, the DTZ, the LRD and the UTZ.
Inspired by the strategy used in the speech recognition field (Dahl
et al., 2012), we refined each of the four domain types into three
sub—domains. For example, we subdivided ERD into pre-ERD, mid-
ERD and post—ERD. In addition, we added two additional domain
types, the biphasic replication domain (BRD) and the dead zone
(DZ). The BRD is the genomic region associated with simultaneous
early and late replication, and the DZ is the zone without any Repli-
Seq signals of six cell cycle fractions and is mainly located near the
centromere. In total, we defined 14 states for replication domains.

According to the visualization of the Repli—Seq data through
UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/), we independ—
ently constructed the training and test sets by manually labelling the
14 states on chr1 and chr20 of B] cell line of Replicate 1, respect—
ively (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1). Considering the rare—
ness of BRD on chr1 and chr20, we added several chromatin
fragments manually labelled as BRD on other chromosomes to the
training and test sets.

With the preparation of the training and test sets complete, we
used the percentage—normalized signals of Repli—Seq data from six
cell cycle fractions in B] cells (Replicate 1) as input features to train
our DNN—HMM algorithm, which consists of an input layer with
six units, two hidden layers, both with 500 hidden units and an out—
put layer with 14 units. The DNN—HMM outputs both the learned
261 014 model parameters and the predicted replication states of the
training data. The learned model parameters were then used to as—
sess the performance of our DNN—HMM algorithm in the analysis
of the independent test data and in the prediction of the states of un—
labelled data. The training and test accuracies were calculated for
the training and test sets, respectively.

After assessing our DNN—HMM method, we merged the initially
identified 14 sub—states into six types of replication domains: the
ERD, the DTZ, the LRD, the UTZ, the BRD and the DZ. In the sub—
sequent analysis, we focus on the first four types of replication
domains.

2.4 Performance evaluation of the DNN—HMM

Although few bioinformatics methods have been specifically pro—
posed for the de novo identification of replication domains using
replication timing profiles, we identified six methods that have been
developed in similar fields. In a previous study, Hansen et al. (2010)
defined very ERD s with the G1 profile from Repli—Seq data. In an—
other study, Ryba et al. (2010) identified replication domains by cir-
cular binary segmentation (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007) using
HD2 microarray data and identified timing transition regions
(TTRs) from loess-smoothed replication timing profiles. These
TTRs can be viewed similarly to our DTZs and UTZs, which con-
nect early and LRDs. In a recent study, Pope at al. (2014) subdivided
IMR90 topologically associated domains (TADs) into three classes
(‘early’, ‘TTR’ and ‘late’) depending on both the means and standard

deviations of the IMR90 replication timing within each TAD. We
extended the TADs to the whole human genome and identified the
early, TTR, and late domains strictly according to their definition.
During the pilot phase of the ENCODE project, Thurman et al.
combined an HMM with wavelet smoothing to produce a two—label
segmentation of the ENCODE pilot regions into ‘active’ and ‘re—
pressed’ regions (Birney et al., 2007; Thurman et al., 2007). This
method was later developed into a tool named HMMSeg (Day at al.,
2007). In the second phase of the ENCODE project, two research
groups within the consortium independently developed algorithms
for the annotation of the chromatin state, ChromHMM (Ernst and
Kellis, 2010, 2012) and Segway (Hoffman et al., 2012). For these
three unsupervised learning methods, we annotated the three states
with ‘ERD’, ‘LRD’ and ‘TTR’ with replication timing profiles.

Based on these six reported methods, we computed the following
performance indicators to compare the performance of these meth—
ods with that of our DNN—HMM.

Accuracy : (TP —1— TN) / (TP —l— TN —l— FN —l— FP) (6)
GM : sqrt(Sensitivity >l< Specificity), (7)

where GM is the geometric mean of sensitivity and specificity,
Sensitivity : TP/(TP —1— FN) and Specificity : TN/(TN —I— FP), and

 

F1 —score:2/( 1 ;>7 (8)

where Recall : Sensitivity and Precision : TP/(TP —l— FP).

2.5 Integrative analysis of distinct types of replication
domains

Detailed descriptions of the integrative analysis of distinct types of
replication domains, including genomic annotations, statistical ana—
lysis by genome structure correction, motif enrichment analysis,
density profiles surrounding the replication domains, enrichment
analysis of TFs and Hi—C data analysis can be found in the
Supplementary Methods.

3 Results

3.1 Development and performance assessment of the
DNN—HMM

To identify the replication domains with Repli—Seq data de novo, we
developed a hybrid architecture (DNN—HMM), integrating a DNN
and a multivariate HMM (Fig. 1A and B). In the DNN—HMM
architecture, the HMM models the sequential patterns of Repli—Seq
data, and the DNN models the observation probability distribution.
This approach combines the advantages of both HMM and DNN
and has excellent potential for de novo discovery of ‘chromatin
states’. To assess the performance of our DNN—HMM algorithm,
we additionally developed a basic DNN algorithm and two classical
GMM—HMM methods, including K—means GMM—HMM and EM
GMM—HMM, independently.

To train and assess these four algorithms, we first constructed
the training and test sets independently using UW Repli—Seq data in
B] cells (Hansen et al., 2010) (see ‘Methods’ section). For the train—
ing and test process, we used six—dimensional normalized Repli-Seq
data in the training and test sets as input features and the manually
annotated 14 sub—states of replication domains as input labels to
train and test the four approaches. All of these algorithms were run
on a computer with four CPU cores, Intel Core i7—4770 3.4GHz,
and 32 GB RAM. We repeated the training and test procedure 10

times with random initiation, independently. For each training and
test, we recorded the computing time and calculated the prediction
accuracies of the training set and test set (Fig. 1C—E, denoted by
‘n = 0’). As expected, the computing time of the two GMM—HMM
algorithms were much faster than those of the two DNN algorithms.
K—means GMM—HMM and EM GMM—HMM achieved much
higher training accuracy (83.1 and 86.9%); however, they obtained
much lower test accuracy (78.1 and 78.1%). These findings indicate
that both GMM—HMMs are likely to encounter over—fitting prob—
lems. In contrast, both basic DNN and DNN—HMM achieved con—
sistent training and test accuracies, suggesting that DNNs can
efficiently resolve the over—fitting problem. Importantly, compared
with the basic DNN algorithm, our DNN—HMM algorithm
achieved the second—highest training accuracy (85.1%) and the high-
est test accuracy (84.6%).

To further assess the performance of these four methods in deal—
ing with high-dimensional data, we increased the dimensionality of
the input data by concatenating five sets of neighbour data on both
sides of the original data. Thus, we used the (2 X 5 —I— 1) X 6:66—
dimensional data as input data to train and test the four algorithms
(Fig. 1C—E, denoted by ‘n = 5’). We found that the training and test
accuracies of the two GMM—HMMs decreased rapidly and were
<5 0%. In contrast, the increase of the dimensionality of the input
data had almost no effect on both DNN algorithms, which have the
highest training and test accuracies. In addition, consistent results
were obtained when increasing the dimensionality of the input data
to (2 x 10 —l— 1) X 6 = 126 by concatenating 10 neighbour data on
both sides of the original (Fig. 1C—E, denoted by ‘n = 10’).

To evaluate the reproducibility of these methods, we repeated
the de novo discoveries of distinct types of replication domains
for two biological replicates of Repli-Seq data (BR1 and BR2) in B]
cells (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Table S2). Plotting distributions of
replication timing profiles across the genomes of two B] replicates
shows a high correlation for these two replicates (Supplementary Fig.
S2, )02 = 0.8983, P—value : 0). For distinct replication domains identi-
fied using DNN—HMM and another three approaches with Repli—Seq
data of BR1 and BR2 in B] cells, we found that the latter three cannot
recover the de novo discoveries of replication domains from another
independent replicate of B] cells very well. In contrast, our DNN—
HMM algorithm can recover the de novo discoveries of distinct types
of replication domains well. In total, over 82% of replication do—
mains of each type identified with DNN—HMM are shared and com—
mon between the two independent replicates in B] cells.
Such a significant degree of overlap (empirical P—value < 1.0 X 10‘6)
indicates that the distinct replication domains identified using DNN—
HMM algorithms are reliable and robust. These performance assess—
ments demonstrated that our DNN—HMM algorithm illustrates its
superior robustness and greater representational power of data and
achieves substantial improvements over discriminatively trained

GMM—HMMs.

3.2 Comparison of the performance of the DNN—HMM
with that of existing methods

We compared our DNN—HMM with the six above—mentioned meth—
ods based on four performance indicators: accuracy, GM, F1—score
and reproducibility. Table 1 summarizes the comparative analysis
of the performance of our method with that of the existing methods.
For the identification of ERDs, our DNN—HMM method always per—
formed better than all of the other methods, as determined based
on the four performance indicators. For the identification of LRDs,
DNN—HMM and Segway shared the best results, followed by

TTR is the union set of DTZ and UTZ. In the last line, we illustrate the relative ranking order of the method based on the results for the four performance indi-

cators analysed in our comparison study.

ChromHMM, the method proposed by Pope et al., HMMSeg, the
method proposed by Hansen et al. and the method proposed by Ryba
et al. For the identification of TTRs, DNN—HMM was ranked first
based on the GM, F1—score and reproducibility indicators and was
ranked second based on the accuracy indicator.

Because the different performance indicators demonstrate the dis—
tinct advantages and disadvantages of these studied methods, we
ranked their performance according to the four metrics. In total, we
performed 12 different tests, including seven methods, three types of
identification domains and four performance indicators. Based on the
ideas proposed by Bajic (2000), we obtained the average of the
ranked positions of each of the seven methods in all of the 12 tests.
Table 2 illustrates the overall score and average rank position of each
of the methods. A lower average rank indicates a better performance.
The analysis revealed that across the different performance tests, the
DNN—HMM was ranked first, followed by Segway, ChromHMM,

the method proposed by Pope et al., HMMSeg, the method proposed
by Ryba et al. and the method proposed by Hansen et al. This result
convincingly demonstrates that DNN—HMM performs well relative
to the existing methods for the identification of replication domains.

3.3 Identification and characterization of distinct
replication domains

We applied our trained DNN—HMM to the de novo identification of
genome—wide replication domains across 15 human cell types using
UW Repli—Seq data (Hansen et al., 2010) in the ENCODE project.
The four types of replication domains differ substantially in their gen-
ome coverage, genome location, numbers of domains, numbers of
genes, evolutionary conservation, cell type—specificity and replication
timing features (see Supplementary Material; Supplementary Fig. S3
and Table S3).

To investigate the occupancy signatures of TFs within each type
of replication domain, we identified sequence features that charac—
terize distinct replication domains. We used a collection of in vitro
motifs that represent the binding preferences of 492 human TFs and
determined the relative enrichment significance of TF-binding elem-
ents within diverse replication domains (Supplementary Fig. S4 and
Table S4). We noticed that a vast majority of these TF-binding
motifs (469 of 492, 95.3%) were significantly enriched in at least
one type of replication domain. Among the 192 of 469 TFs (40.9%)
enriched within the ERDs, KLF4, MYC, SMAD3, TP53, E2F1,
EGR1, SP1 and YY1 have been explicitly reported to play important
roles in the control of the G1/S—phase transition of the cell cycle, and
others, such as MAZ and E4F1, have been reported to be closely
associated with cell cycle activity (Supplementary Table S5). Two
hundred and two (43.1%) TFs, including TBX18, CUX1, GATA6,
HNF1A, IK2F2, MSX2, POU5F1, SOX2, CDC5L, ALX1 and
ESX1, were specifically enriched within LRDs. It has been reported
that CDC5L, ESX1 and GATA6 play important roles in the control
of the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle and that CUX1 and ALX1
play important roles in cell cycle progression (Supplementary Table
S5). DTZs and UTZs demonstrate similar enrichment of TFs, which
are enriched in either ERDs or LRDs. We found that a small fraction
of TFs (75 of 469, 16.0%) were significantly enriched in all of these
types of replication domains. These factors include DDIT3,
NANOG and STAT1, which have also been reported to play im—
portant roles in the cell cycle (Supplementary Table S5 ).

To further quantify the occupancy relationship between distinct
replication domains and the regulatory factors, we compiled ChIP—Seq
data from ENCODE of 8, 13 and 5 different TFs and cofactors in
IMR90, GM12878 and K562 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). We com—
pared their accumulated normalized intensities with those from regions
immediately outside the domains (to the left and to the right) and with
those determined from randomly shufﬂed domains. This analysis
showed that all of the examined TFs and cofactors, with the exception
of ZNF274, were significantly enriched in ERDs and differentially
depleted in LRDs, whereas ZNF274 were significantly enriched in
LRDs and differentially depleted in ERDs (Supplementary Fig. S6).
A further enrichment analysis of the TF and cofactor peaks with differ—
ent replication domains confirmed the enrichment and depletion pat—
terns of TFs and cofactors within each type of replication domain
(Supplementary Fig. S7). Among the TFs and cofactors enriched in
ERDs, studies have explicitly reported that RAD21, E2F4, BRCA1,
CJUN, GATA1, STAT3, CMYC, TP53, EGR1, SP1, YY1 and BACH1
play important roles in G1/S cell cycle progression (Supplementary
Table S5 ). In addition, a recent study has demonstrated that the zinc—
finger protein ZNF274 associates with the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)
methyltransferase SETDB1, which is recruited by MDB1 to CAF—1 to
form an S phase—specific CAF-1/MDB1/SETDB1 complex during DNA
replication (Supplementary Table S5 ). Notably, we found that within
each type of replication domain, the enrichment and depletion patterns
obtained with motif scanning agree well with those obtained from
ChIP—Seq data for the TFs that have in vitro motifs (Supplementary
Fig. S4 and Table S4). These TFs include CTCF, EP300, MAZ,
CEBPB, TP53, YY1, BHLHE40, NRF1, MAX, ELK1, STAT3, USFZ,
SP1, EGR1, BACH1, CMYC and ZNF263, which play essential roles
in the cell cycle. Furthermore, we found that CTCF and CEBPB were
both enriched in DTZs and UTZs (Supplementary Fig. S7 and Table
S4). Together, these findings suggest that distinct replication domains
possess unique sequence features.

To delineate the nature of each type of replication domain, we ana—
lysed the chromatin signatures in distinct replication domains. We
examined 10 histone modifications (H3K4me1/me2/me3, H3K36me3,

H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K79me2, H4K20me1, H3K9ac and
H3K27ac), one histone variant (H2A.Z), DNA methylation, RNA
polymerase II, RNA signals, DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and
nuclear lamina (see Supplementary Fig. S8). These data represent differ—
ent types of chromatin activities from human IMR90 cells. We com—
pared the aggregate normalized density profiles between distinct types
of replication domains as we did for TFs and cofactors. We found that
ERDs and LRDs showed unique enrichment and depletion patterns
within the replication domains and at the boundaries for each chroma—
tin marker, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S9). This finding is consist—
ent with those obtained in previous studies. A further colocalization
analysis and correlation analysis between ERDs and LRDs and chro—
matin markers demonstrated that the unique enrichment and depletion
patterns specifically dependent on the cell type (Supplementary Figs.
S10 and S11). Together, our findings demonstrate that early and late
replication are linked to active and repressive chromatin markers in a
cell type—specific manner, respectively. Notably, early—replicating re—
gions are more highly methylated than late—replicating regions.

3.4 Chromatin architecture of distinct replication
domains

Recent studies have revealed the association between replication tim—
ing and higher-order chromosomal structure (Pope at al., 2014; Ryba
et al., 2010). Our analysis further strengthens these tight associations
in distinct types of replication domains (see Supplementary Fig. S12).
We then investigated the chromatin interactions between intra— and
inter-replication domains (Supplementary Fig. S13A—C), and found
that interactions within each type of replication domain were en—
riched but that interactions between different types of replication do—
mains are depleted (Supplementary Figs. S13A—C). This finding
indicates that the entire genome can be partitioned into different types
of replication domains such that greater interaction occurs within
each type of replication domain rather than across distinct types of
replication domains. Furthermore, domains within each type of repli-
cation domain are more densely packed internally, with LRD being
the densest and ERD the loosest (Supplementary Fig. S13A). Notably,
we found that inter—interaction between DTZs and UTZs was higher
than the inter-interaction within DTZs and UTZs (Supplementary
Figs. 813B and C, P—value< 1.0 x 10—19), implying that DTZs and
UTZs tend to colocalize. Thus, we hypothesized that the adjacent
DTZ—UTZ pairs separated by ERDs and LRDs contact much more
closely and may form a chromatin loop. To test this hypothesis, we
examined the interactions between adjacent DTZ—UTZ pairs on both
sides of ERDs or LRDs (Supplementary Fig. S13D). We found that
the inter—interactions between adjacent DTZ—UTZ pairs separated by
LRDs were significantly stronger than the inter—interaction between
adjacent DTZ—UTZ pairs separated by an ERD. Furthermore, the
interactions between adjacent DTZ—UTZ pairs separated by ERDs
were markedly stronger than the intra-interaction within ERDs, and
the interactions between adjacent DTZ—UTZ pairs separated by
LRDs were also comparable with the intra—interaction within LRDs
(Supplementary Fig. 813A and D), although the genomic distance be—
tween adjacent DTZ—UTZ pairs was much larger than those of in-
ternal loci within ERDs or LRDs. To further demonstrate our
hypothesis, we fixed one side of the adjacent DTZ—UTZ pairs and
examined the inter—interactions between this side with another side
and its flanking regions (Fig. 2A and B). We found that the inter—
actions of adjacent DTZ—UTZ pairs were substantially stronger than
those of flanking regions. Furthermore, we explored the interactions
between the adjacent DTZ—UTZ pairs and their flanking regions
by keeping the distance of the adjacent DTZ—UTZ pairs constant

(Fig. 2C). The interactions of the adjacent DTZ—UTZ pairs were
highest in the interaction profiles. These findings suggest that adjacent
DTZ—UTZ pairs separated by ERDs and LRDs closely colocalize and
provide compelling evidence that the adjacent DTZ—UTZ pairs form
a chromatin loop.

We then closely examined the chromatin interactions in the vicin-
ity of the centre of each type of replication domain (Supplementary
Fig. S13E—H). Strikingly, we found that a locus within ERDs mainly
interacts with a close intra—locus, whereas a locus within LRDs
mainly interacts with a far intra—locus (Supplementary Fig. 813E and
G). Based on this observation, we hypothesize that intra—interactions
within each ERD tend to be short—range, where intra—interactions
within each LRD prefer to be long—range. To test this hypothesis, we
calculated the average intra—interaction I(s) for pairs of loci separated
by a genomic distance s within ERDs and LRDs (Fig. 2D). We found
that as the genomic distance s increased, the average intra—interaction
I(s) within ERDs increased over a very short genomic distance and
then decreased markedly, whereas the average intra—interaction I(s)
within LRDs decreased over a very short genomic distance and then
increased substantially. To further assess the short— and long—range
interactions, we measured the distributions of genomic distance s at
the threshold of interaction I (s) 2 0 within ERDs and LRDs, respect—
ively (Fig. 2E). We observed that the median interaction distance
within ERDs was markedly smaller than that within LRDs. We ex-
tended this analysis for any given threshold of interaction 1(5), and
plotted the curves of the median interaction distances within ERDs
and LRDs (Fig. 2F). The median interaction distance within the LRDs
was always markedly larger than the median interaction distance
within the ERDs. These results support the hypothesis that intra—inter—
actions within ERDs tend to be short—range and that intra—inter—
actions within LRDs are likely to be long—range.

4 Discussion

In this study, we propose a pre—trained DNN—HMM hybrid model
and present its first successful application for de novo identification

of replication domains with replication timing profiles from Repli-
Seq data. Our approach has two key characteristics that distinguish
it from earlier methods. First, we adopted a deeper, more expressive
DNN—HMM hybrid architecture and thus employed the unsuper—
vised DBN pre—training and subsequent supervised fine—tuning strat—
egy, which made the training more effective. Second, we used
posterior probabilities of states as the output of DNN, which made
the training more informative. Subsequent performance assessments
demonstrated that our DNN—HMM approach achieves substantial
improvements in identification accuracy and robustness over dis—
criminatively trained pure GMM—HMM systems, generatively
trained traditional DNN algorithms and other six reported
methods.

Despite these promising results, there are many aspects of using
DNN—HMM for practical scalability in computational biology that
require further study. These aspects include investigation of the par—
allelization of DNN training, which may require a better theoretical
understanding of deep learning, and the exploration of more opti-
mal algorithms to training DNN—HMM rather than the embedded
suboptimal Viterbi algorithm. There is also a need to explore
the vast improvement space in the DNN—HMM hybrid model,
including adopting a full—sequence training of the DBN, using the
mean—covariance REM, and even absorbing the insights gained
from generative modelling research in both neural networks and
speech and phone recognition.

Recently, Brendan ]. Frey and his colleagues applied a DNN to
investigate the human and mouse splicing codes and demonstrated
the superior advantages of this deep architecture over the previous
Bayesian method for predicting the patterns of alternative splicing
(Leung et al., 2014; Xiong et al., 2015). Compared with their DNN
structure of a two—layer neural network with only 30 hidden units,
our DNN—HMM hybrid architecture is much more complex and
ﬂexible. Regardless, their work and ours represent a critical process
of applying deep learning in computational biology. In particular,
with the exponentially rapid growth in the volume of multi-omic
data, such as genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics
and chromatin interactomics, our hybrid architecture employing
DNN and HMM has the potential to produce meaningful and hier-
archical representations that can be efficiently used to describe com—
plex biological phenomena. For example, DNN—HMMs may be
useful for modelling multiple stages of a regulatory network at the
sequence level and at higher levels of abstraction. In addition,
DNN—HMM can be applied to the identification of functional elem-
ents and regions, such as enhancers, insulators and promoters, and
the identification of chromatin states.

We applied our DNN—HMM algorithm to de novo identification
of distinct types of replication domains, including ERD, DTZ, LRD
and UTZ, using Repli—Seq data across 15 human cell types. We per—
formed a systematic and integrative analysis of these domains using
diverse ENCODE data and unravelled the replication domains of dis—
tinct types that harbour unique genomic and epigenetic patterns, tran—
scriptional activity and higher—order chromosomal structure. Our
results support a unifying model in which the human genome is gener-
ally organized into large replication domains of distinct types that
constitute stable regulatory units of replication timing. In our ‘replica-
tion—domain model’ (Fig. 3), DNA replicates early within ERDs that
acquire permissive chromatin signatures and active regulators.
Meanwhile, replication gradually moves forward into adjacent LRDs
that contain repressive chromatin features and repressive regulators.
This gradual progression forms DTZs or UTZs that connect the
boundaries of ERDs and LRDs. DTZs were characterized by the
sharp decrease/increase of active/repressive chromatin markers,

Fig. 3. The replication domain model. Model of chromosome organization
during DNA replication. This model was obtained by summarizing the main
results presented in this study. Large, discrete replication domains (ERDs and
LRDs) demarcated by DTZs and UTZs are spatially compartmentalized struc-
tural and functional units of higher-order chromosomal structure and are dy-
namically associated with the nuclear lamina. In this model, the ERD is an
open, loosely packed, transcriptionally active chromatin domain located far
from the nuclear membrane and occupied by active epigenetic markers and
active regulators, whereas the LRD is a closed, densely packed, transcription-
ally inactive chromatin domain located near the nuclear membrane and occu-
pied by repressive epigenetic markers and repressive regulators. The ERD
and LRD are spatially separated by the DTZ and UTZ, which are transition
zones enriched with H3k27me3 and occupied by CTCF. The adjacent DTZ—
UTZ pairs form chromatin loops, and intra-interactions within ERDs and LRDs
tend to be short- and long-range, respectively

whereas UTZs were characterized by the sharp increase/decrease of
active/repressive chromatin markers.

Our replication—domain model agrees well with the previously
presented fractal globule, a knot—free, polymer conformation
(Lieberman—Aiden et al., 2009). In our model, spatially separated
fractal globules are equivalent to temporally separated ERDs and
LRDs that are connected by UTZs and DTZs. The adjacent DTZ—
UTZ pairs separated by an ERD or LRD form a chromatin loop for
each ERD and LRD through the acquisition of much stronger con—
tacts. Most importantly, we found that in the chromatin loops formed
by adjacent DTZ—UTZ pairs, LRDs prefer to be more densely packed
and in long-range intra-interactions, whereas ERDs tend to be more
loosely packed and in short—range intra—interactions.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Determining genetic factors underlying various phenotypes
is hindered by the involvement of multiple genes acting cooperatively.
Over the past years, disease—gene prioritization has been central to
identify genes implicated in human disorders. Special attention has
been paid on using physical interactions between the proteins
encoded by the genes to link them with diseases. Such methods
exploit the guilt-by-association principle in the protein interaction net-
work to uncover novel disease—gene associations. These methods rely
on the proximity of a gene in the network to the genes associated with
a phenotype and require a set of initial associations. Here, we present
GUILDify, an easy-to-use web server for the phenotypic characteriza-
tion of genes. GUILDify offers a prioritization approach based on the
protein—protein interaction network where the initial phenotype—gene
associations are retrieved via free text search on biological databases.
GUILDify web server does not restrict the prioritization to any
predefined phenotype, supports multiple species and accepts user-
specified genes. It also prioritizes drugs based on the ranking of their
targets, unleashing opportunities for repurposing drugs for novel
therapies.

1 INTRODUCTION

During the past decade, disease—gene prioritization has been
central to research efforts in the field of human genetics. The
promise of suggesting novel associations for genetic disorders
with implications to therapeutical improvements has yielded a
broad spectrum of computational tools (Kann, 2010;
Tranchevent et al., 2011). Special attention has been paid on
using physical interactions between the products of these genes
to associate them with diseases (Barabasi et al., 2011; Ideker and
Sharan, 2008).

Methods using protein—protein interactions (PPIs) exploit the
‘guilt-by-association’ principle over the network topology to un-
cover new disease—gene associations. The guilt-by-association
principle suggests that the genes whose products (proteins) inter-
act with the products of known disease genes are more likely to
be disease genes (Aerts et al., 2006; Lage et al., 2007). Recently,
we proposed three novel algorithms for genome-wide prioritiza-
tion of disease genes using PPI networks and showed that a
consensus method combining these algorithms improved the pri-
oritization (Guney and Oliva, 2012) when using the disease—gene
associations in Online Mendalian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)
database (Hamosh et al., 2005). Combined with genomics and
proteomics data, the method has been successfully used to iden-
tify a gene driving metastasis to bone in breast cancer (Santana-
Codina et al., 2013).

Available network-based prioritization tools use either disease—
gene annotations from OMIM database (Gottlieb et al., 2011;
Kohler et al., 2008) or a set of genes provided by the user (Chen
et al., 2009; Kacprowski et al., 2013; Warde—Farley et al., 2010) as
initial associations (seed genes). These tools typically output the
prioritization for a set of candidate genes; genes lying under a
given genomic interval, a set ofuser-provided genes or top ranking
genes (several hundred at most). Furthermore, some of these tools
are accessible only through Cytoscape (Saito et al., 2012) as a
plugin (Gottlieb et al., 2011; Kacprowski et al., 2013).

Publicly available biological data repositories can also be used
for mining initial phenotype—gene associations required by net-
work-based prioritization methods without restricting to any
predefined phenotype or candidates. Considering the limited
availability of convenient interfaces that bridge network-based
prioritization algorithms, we present GUILDify, an interactome-
based prioritization server for phenotype-based characterization.
GUILDify retrieves initial phenotype—gene associations (seeds)
via free text search on biological databases and ranks the pro-
teins in the interaction network for their relevance to the pheno-
type. When the queried species is Homo sapiens, GUILDify
provides a ranking of the drugs related to the phenotype based
on the ranking of their targets.

UniProt, OMIM and GO databases (see Supplementary Material on the
data sources used). Matching proteins are displayed to the user. The
proteins selected in this page are used as the initial phenotype—protein
associations (seeds). The user also selects the prioritization method(s) to
be used in the prioritization step. GUILDify maps the seeds (selected
proteins) onto a genome-wide PPI network and runs the global
topology-based prioritization algorithm selected by the user. The spe-
cies-speciﬁc PPI network is generated using the interaction databases
integrated in BIANA (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2010). GUILDify uses
three algorithms (NetScore, Nethore and NetShort) available to priori-
tize genes potentially involved in diseases using a priori disease—gene as-
sociations and PPIs. The user can modify the default parameters of the
prioritization algorithms. Default values were tested on a large dataset of
disease phenotypes using GUILD framework (Guney and Oliva, 2012). If
more than one algorithm is selected, GUILDify uses a consensus that
combines the scores of the selected algorithms (see Supplementary
Material for details).

GUILDify outputs a likelihood score (GUILD score) associating the
gene product with the phenotype provided by the user for each gene
product in the PPI network. It outputs the rank and descriptive informa-
tion of the gene products. The ﬁles containing this information and the
seed proteins used in the prioritization can be downloaded from the web
page displaying the results (results page).

The results page includes an interactive visualization panel where top-
ranking proteins (at top 1 or 5%) and their interactions are displayed
(Fig. l). Nodes of the subnetwork in this panel can be selected, providing
information on their description in BIANA integrated database. If the
species is H. sapiens, GUILDify fetches the drugs (if any) targeting these
top-ranking proteins from DrugBank (Knox et al., 2011) and displays
them in the visualization panel. The score for each drug targeting a pro-
tein in the high-scoring subnetwork is calculated as the geometric distance
to the protein(s) t targeted by the drug in the highest scoring subnetwork,
using their individual scores as length. Further details on the materials
and methods can be found in the Supplementary Material.

3 CONCLUSION

Phenotypic characterization of genes plays a crucial role in ex-
plaining the mechanisms behind biological processes. We have
developed GUILDify, a free and easy-to-use web server for pri-
oritization of genes using PPI networks. For a given phenotype,
GUILDify uses descriptive fields in several proteomics and gen-
omics databases in combination with network-based prioritiza-
tion methods and provides an interactome-wide ranking. The
ranking represents the relevance to the phenotype of interest
and can be used to short-list the set of candidate genes that
need to be further validated or to repurpose drugs (e. g. through
common high-ranking targets).

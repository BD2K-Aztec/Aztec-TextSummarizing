ABSTRACT

Summary: The signaling Petri net (SPN) simulator, designed to pro-
vide insights into the trends of molecules’ activity levels in response to
an external stimulus, contributes to the systems biology necessity of
analyzing the dynamics of large-scale cellular networks. Implemented
into the freely available software, BioLayout Express3D, the simulator is
publicly available and easy to use, provided the input files are pre-
pared in the GraphML format, typically using the network editing soft-
ware, yEd, and standards specific to the software. However, analysis
of complex networks represented using other systems biology format-
ting Ianguages (on which popular software, such as CellDesigner and
Cytoscape, are based) requires manual manipulation, a step that is
prone to error and limits the use of the SPN simulator in BioLayout
Express”. To overcome this, we present a Cytoscape plug-in that
enables users to automatically convert networks for analysis with
the SPN simulator from the standard systems biology markup lan-
guage. The automation of this step opens the SPN simulator to a far
larger user group than has previously been possible.

1 INTRODUCTION

There are typically two approaches with respect to the analysis of
biological networks: the ﬁrst is to analyze the network in its static
form, determining key features of the network; the second
concerns analysis of the network dynamics which, due to the
computationally heavy process involved in quantifying kinetic
parameters, is typically restricted to small-scale networks.
However, Petri nets (PNs) (Petri and Reisig, 2008) allow for
the study of dynamics without the need to have detailed infor-
mation on the kinetics. In this direction, the signaling Petri net
(SPN) simulator, ﬁrst described in Ruths et al. (2008), overcomes
the aforementioned problem by adapting PNs to biological simu-
lations, characterizing the dynamics of signal ﬂow through a
signaling network, using token distribution and sampling.

SPNs allow one to analyze the dynamics of large-scale networks
by providing insights into the trends of molecules’ activity levels
in response to an external stimulus. By representing a complex
network as a PN, the SPN method models signal ﬂow as the
pattern of token accumulation at places (proteins), over time.
Transitions in the network represent directed protein inter-
actions, where each transition models the effect of a source pro-
tein on a target protein. By allowing tokens to pass through
transition gates, the number of tokens assigned to the target,
called token-count, varies, thus modeling the way that signals
propagate through protein interactions in cellular signaling net-
works (Ruths et al., 2008).

The described SPN simulator has since been adopted, and
adapted, for use in BioLayout Express”), a powerful tool for
the visualization and analysis of network graphs (Freeman
et al., 2007). Within BioLayout Express“), the user has the
option to run the SPN simulator over biological networks,
strictly input in .graphML format (Brandes et al., 2002) and
drawn as bipartite graphs comprising places, transitions and
edges. Currently, the network editing software, ‘yEd’ (http://
www.yworks.com), is one of the few that recognizes graphs in
standard formats (.xml/.xls, .gml and .xgml), compatible with
‘SBML—friendly’ (Hucka et al., 2003) software such as
Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) and thus CellDesigner
(Funahashi et al., 2003). However, this preparation stage re-
quires manual insertion of transition gates between molecules,
a step that, particularly for the large maps that SPN is designed
to run on, is both cumbersome and prone to error. To overcome
this limitation, we have developed SPNConverter, a new appli-
cation for Cytoscape, which prepares molecular networks for
analysis in the SPN simulator in BioLayout Express“). As the
Cytoscape plug-in BiNoM (Zinovyev et al., 2008) transforms
CellDesigner networks into Cytoscape ones, SPNConverter can
be efﬁciently used on both widespread standards, ﬁlling in the
missing link between analysis of complex networks in their static
form and analysis of the dynamics of large-scale networks.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

SPNConverter is a platform-independent Java application
for Cytoscape, an open source software platform for visualizing
and analyzing complex networks. Available at www.picb.ac.cn/
ClinicalGenomicNTW/SPNConverter.html, SPNConverter
allows users to prepare complex networks for the SPN simulator
in BioLayout Express3D by conversion of graphs from

Fig. 1. Graphical representation of a simple network converted from
(A) CellDesigner to (B) Cytoscape and (C) .graphML. Transition gates
are added to graph C by SPNConverter and tokens allocated to ‘edge’ nodes

(Cytoscape and) CellDesigner, which follows already well-
designed and established nodes, reactions and edge types.

After installation of SPNConverter as a plug-in in Cytoscape,
and on importing a complex network from CellDesigner into
Cytoscape (see also BiNoM), the user is able to export the se-
lected network as a PN. First, the user must deﬁne the attributes
to which the network has been built. A network will be asso-
ciated with three attribute ﬁles, describing the characteristics of
the nodes, reactions and edges. Although users can deﬁne the
attribute ﬁles themselves, it is highly recommended that the de-
fault attribute ﬁles created by BiNoM during importation from
CellDesigner are used. To reﬁne the simulation, the user can
change the default number of tokens that are assigned to edge
nodes (during the export process or independently, see Readme
ﬁle, section 3). Here, it is assumed that edge nodes are input
nodes of pathways in the network, labeled ‘EDGE’ in Figure 1C.

Alternatively, the user can specify input nodes to allow one to
investigate the effect of an external stimulus on up to 20 speciﬁc,
user-deﬁned, points in the network. Should the network be
completely closed (i.e. there are no edge nodes), the user is
requested to deﬁne a stimulation target, thus deﬁning a set of
target molecules in the SPN simulation that the biological stimu-
lus would activate. The plug-in, implemented in Java, adds tran-
sition gates to the network and converts the network from
systems biology markup language (SBML) into modiﬁed
Edinburgh Pathway Notation, the formatting language used by
BioLayout Express3D. The network is then saved as a .graphML
ﬁle, making it immediately recognizable by BioLayout Express3D
as an SPN simulation input network.

With the plug-in, we provide samples of simple reactions to
demonstrate how SPNConverter converts reactions from the
SBML format used in CellDesigner into SPN input graphs, as
well as a larger example to demonstrate the ability of the plug-in
to work efﬁciently on complex networks that are already in the
public domain. The simple reactions are arbitrary, whereas the

larger example is a published network of rheumatoid arthritis
(Wu et al., 2010).

Both sets of sample ﬁles have been imported into BioLayout
Express3D and the SPN simulator has been run. For the simple
interactions, the ‘expression proﬁles’ were validated against
sample networks provided by the authors of BioLayout
Express3D. The SPN simulator was also run on the complex
network example, and output data were successfully compared
with the results published in Dent and Nardini (2013), where the
conversion was manual.

3 CONCLUSION

The ability to simulate the effects of a biological stimulus in the
absence of detailed information on the kinetics of each reaction
can be overcome in the PN frame. However, key to being able to
fully beneﬁt from the SPN is the ability for easy and safe conver-
sion of biological networks from the most powerful visualization
software into powerful analysis software. Until now, it has not
been possible to link the former with the latter, without manual
manipulation of networks, greatly restricting the availability of the
SPN simulator to researchers. This missing link has been ﬁlled by
SPNConverter, allowing researchers to investigate the effect of a
drug, e. g. on a network in silico and with great ease. The results of
previous work (with manual conversion) have led to recommen-
dations on unsuitable interactions for rheumatoid arthritis drugs
tested in clinical trials (Dent and Nardini, 2013), highlighting
the power of the SPN simulator in complex network analysis
and the importance of making it more widely accessible with
SPNConverter. Future versions may be improved with the use
of other standard such as Systems Biology Ontology (Courtot
et al., 2011).

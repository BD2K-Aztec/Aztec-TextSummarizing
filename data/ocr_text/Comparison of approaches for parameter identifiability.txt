ABSTRACT

Motivation: Modeling of dynamical systems using ordinary differential
equations is a popular approach in the field of Systems Biology. The
amount of experimental data that are used to build and calibrate these
models is often limited. In this setting, the model parameters may not
be uniquely determinable. Structural or a priori identifiability is a prop-
erty of the system equations that indicates whether, in principle, the
unknown model parameters can be determined from the available
data.

Results: We performed a case study using three current approaches
for structural identifiability analysis for an application from cell biology.
The approaches are conceptually different and are developed inde-
pendently. The results of the three approaches are in agreement. We
discuss strength and weaknesses of each of them and illustrate how
they can be applied to real world problems.

Availability and implementation: For application of the approaches
to further applications, code representations (DAISY, Mathematica
and MATLAB) for benchmark model and data are provided on the
authors webpage.

1 INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of cellular processes such as signal transduction
pathways can be described by models consisting of ordinary dif-
ferential equations (ODEs). We used a model of IL13-induced
JAK/STAT signaling (Raia et al., 2011) to present a comprehen-
sive comparison of three approaches for structural identiﬁability
analysis. Mathematically, such dynamical models can be charac-
terized by the ODE

5((t) = f(X(t), u(t), 0) with X(0) = x0 = g(0) (1)

In this case, the vector of state variables x(t) describes
the dynamics of 15 molecular components involved in the
JAK/STAT signaling pathway (for details see equation (3)).
The function u(t) represents possibly time-dependent

experimental treatments; in this case it represents a constant
treatment with the cytokine 1L13. The vector 0 contains all par-
ameters of the dynamical model, such as the reaction rate con-
stants. For a speciﬁc cell type or biological context, the
parameters 0 are often not available from literature and have
to be estimated from experimental data. The initial concentra-
tions x0 can be known or unknown; in the latter case they have
to be estimated from experimental data as well. Each possible
measurement is mathematically represented by a functional

mapping
y(t) = h(X(t), “(0, 0) (2)

that might include additional parameters and thus increase the
dimension of 0, such as scaling parameter for relative data
obtained by immunoblotting in our case.

The inference problem of concern is the determination of the
model parameters 0 from the measurements y and inputs u
described by Equation (2). In general, this may not be possible.
Structural or a priori identifiability (Bellman and Astrém, 1970) is
a property of the systems (1) and (2) that guarantees that the
unknown model parameters can, in principle, be determined
from generic input and output functions of the model,
provided they satisfy certain minimal conditions called ‘persist-
ence of excitation’ [for a broad introduction and classical
approaches Walter (1987)]. Structural identiﬁability is a
prerequisite and necessary condition for any estimation procedure
to render the recovery of 0 from input—output measurements as a
well-posed problem and to return meaningful results about 0.
Well-known approaches to structural identiﬁability analysis
often have problems with the realistically sized models
(Karlsson et al., 2012; Sedoglavic, 2002), but there are approaches
that can handle them.

Let us consider a simple model for the illustration of structural
identiﬁability. The model describes a transition between two
components

561(1‘) 2 —91x1
5620) = +91X1

We assume that x1(0) = 92 and x2(0) = 0, and only the measure-
ment y1(t) = 93 x2 (t), are available. In this case, we can solve for

The result

y1(t) = 93 92 CXp(—91 t) - (exp(91 t) — 1)

shows that 93 and 92 are structurally non-identifiable. 91 and only
the product of 93 and 92 are structurally identiﬁable. Such redun-
dant parameterization can be detected directly for very simple
examples. For analysis of realistic models, one has to resort to
more sophisticated approaches.

We compared three current conceptually different approaches
for identiﬁability analysis using the model and data of Raia et al.
(2011) as case study. In particular, we compared the Differential
Algebra ldentiﬁability of Systems (DAISY) approach proposed
by Saccomani et al. (2003), the Exact Arithmetic Rank (EAR)
approach implemented by Karlsson et al. (2012) and the Proﬁle
Likelihood (PL) approach proposed by Raue et al. (2009). The
results of all three approaches are in good agreement; however,
each approach has speciﬁc strength and weaknesses that will be
discussed.

2 METHODS

Approaches for identiﬁability analysis can be classiﬁed according to sev-
eral criteria. The main difference is between a priori versus data-based
type approaches. A priori approaches can be applied irrespective of which
input functions are used and before the availability of experimental data.
Data-based type approaches can be applied if actual experimental
data are available or can be simulated under reasonable assumptions.
Some a priori approaches allow to test global identiﬁability, a property
holding for all possible parameter values, i.e. independently of the
actual parameter value. Other approaches allow to test local identiﬁabil-
ity, holding around a point in the parameter space. Some data-based
approaches also allow for conclusions about practical non-identiﬁability
(Raue et al., 2009) that is caused by limited quality of experimental
data. The classiﬁcation of the three approaches investigated is shown in
Table 1.

2.1 DAISY approach

This approach implements a differential algebra algorithm to perform a
global parameter identiﬁability analysis for dynamic models described by
polynomial or rational equations (Bellu et al., 2007). The basic idea is that
of manipulating algebraic differential equations as polynomials depend-
ing also on derivatives of the variable. Ritt’s algorithm permits to elim-
inate the non-observed state variables x from the system of equations
and to ﬁnd the input—output relation of the system: a set of polynomial
differential equations involving only the variables a and y, thus
describing all input—output pairs satisfying (1) and (2). The input—
output relation is linearly parameterized by certain algebraic functions
of the unknown parameters called the exhaustive summary, which can be

easily extracted. These functions lead to a system of algebraic non-
linear equations in the unknown 9. By applying a computer algebra al-
gorithm, i.e. the Buchberger algorithm, it is possible to check whether
there is one or multiple solutions and hence distinguish between global, or
local identiﬁability or non-identiﬁability of the original dynamic system.
An additional advantage of using this computer algebra tool is that
it does not require expertise on mathematical modeling by the
experimenter.

2.2 EAR approach

This approach is based on applying the inverse function theorem to the
system of algebraic equations relating higher order derivatives of the
output y with respect to time at the initial time with the initial state
and parameters (Pohjanpalo (1978). Using a differential algebra ap-
proach, an upper bound of the order of differentiation can be given,
resulting in a non-linear algebraic system of equations in the parameters.
The rank of the J acobian matrix for this system of equations gives infor-
mation about its solvability, and in case of a rank-deﬁcient matrix, a
more detailed analysis of the J acobian provides information about
which parameters are involved in relations rendering the system non-
identiﬁable. The EAR method provides means to efﬁciently compute
the generic rank of the Jacobian matrix to return a conclusive result if
the system is structurally identiﬁable. It considers local identiﬁability but
around a generic point, i.e. the computations are carried out for a
random specialization of the unknown parameters, and initial state to
integer values and a random input in terms of a truncated integer coef-
ﬁcient power series. Local structural identiﬁability is an almost every-
where property by deﬁnition, i.e. it holds everywhere apart from
possibly on a set of measure zero. The EAR approach is based on a
method for local algebraic observability (Sedoglavic, 2002). The EAR
analysis is implemented as a fully automatic Mathematica function.
The user simply inputs the equations and gets the answer. Based on the
EAR identiﬁability analysis, it is also possible to ﬁnd minimal sets of
outputs giving identiﬁability (Anguelova et al., 2012).

2.3 PL approach

This approach checks for non-identiﬁability by posing a parameter esti-
mation problem using real or simulated data. The central idea is that non-
identiﬁability manifests as a ﬂat manifold in the parameter space of the
estimation problem, e.g. the likelihood function. A proﬁle can be calcu-
lated for each parameter 9,- individually by repeated optimization of all
parameters {9jl‘v’j 75 i} for a series of ﬁxed values of the parameter 9,-. A
ﬂat proﬁle indicates a structurally non-identiﬁable parameter. For detect-
ing structural non-identiﬁability, simulated data are sufﬁcient. In case
real experimental data are available, practical non-identiﬁability can
also be detected and conﬁdence intervals for the parameter estimates
can be calculated. The traces in parameter space that correspond to the
proﬁles can be used to analyze the reason for non-identiﬁability and point
to missing experimental information and interrelated parameters. It was
demonstrated in a study by Raue et al. (2010) that the approach facilitates
an iterative experimental design strategy and Kreutz et al. (2012)

extended the approach to detect non-observability of the dynamics dir-
ectly. The approach was applied to biological data in Bachmann et al.
(2011) and Becker et al. (2010).

2.4 Equations of benchmark model

In the following, we describe the equations of the IL13-Induced JAK/
STAT signaling model (Raia et al., 2011) that correspond to Equations
(1) and (2). These equations determine the structural identiﬁability of the
model parameters. The ODE system determining the time evolution of
the state variables is given by

' 561(1) = —9161u1X1 — 95x1 + 96362
562(1) = +95X1 — 96962
563(1) = +9161 711 X1 — 92363367
564(1) = +92X3X7 — 93364
565(1) = +93X4 — 94365
566(1) = —97X3X6/(1 + 913x14)—
—97X4X6/(1 + 9133614) + 62 98x7
4 567(1) = +97X3X6/(1 + 913X14)+ (3)
+97X4X6/(1 + 9139614) — 62 98367
568(1) = —99X8X7 + 62 910369
569(1) = +99X8X7 — 62 910369
5610(1) = +911X9
5611(1) = —91261 7119611
5612(1) = +912€1 ul X11
5613(1) = +914x10/(915 + X10) — 9163613
. 5614(1) = +917X9

 

where X is the 14D state vector, the dot denotes the time derivative, ul is
an input functions and C12 are constants. The initial conditions of the
state variables are

x(0) = [13,923, 0, 0, 0, 28,0, 165,0, 0, 034,0, 0, 0] (4)

the values are given in units of molecules per cell (x1000). The set of
measurement equations is deﬁned by the following equation

0’10) = X1+X3 +X4

y3(t) = 919054 + X5)

4 ysU) = 9213610 (5)
MO) = 922x14
y7(1) = X13
J80) = X9-

 

The components X, u and c of Equation (3) and y of Equation (5) are
described in Table 2. The model Equations (3—5) contain 23 unknown
parameters 9 that are described in Table 3. They need to be determined
from the available measurements given in Equation (5).

3 RESULTS

We present results on the identiﬁability for the benchmark
model (Raia et al., 2011) using the three approaches described
in the Section 2: the Differential Algebra ldentiﬁability of
Systems (DAISY) approach proposed by Bellu et al. (2007);
EAR approach implemented by Karlsson et al. (2012) and the
PL approach proposed by Raue et al. (2009). For the last
approach, we also use the original data of Raia et al. (2011).
The application of the three approaches for identiﬁability
analysis will be described in detail. In summary, all three
approaches consistently classify ﬁve parameters as structurally
non-identiﬁable: 911, 915, 917, 921, 922.

3.1 DAISY approach

The differential-algebra-based approach provides a direct check
of global identiﬁability of the above model, showing the non-
identiﬁability of some model parameters. The approach suggests
a reduction of the model to minimal form so that fundamental
system theoretic properties, such as accessibility, hold and the
model is more suitable for further mathematical investigations.
Thus, before checking model identiﬁability from the designed
experiment, it is convenient to check its minimality. In this
case, just by visual inspection, it is easy to see that some of the
14 model equations deﬁning the model are redundant.

In particular, the equations for x6, x8, x11 are the same as those
for x7,x9,x12 with the opposite sign. For example, from the
eighth and ninth equations, one obtains x9 = —x8. By integrat-
ing and using the known initial conditions, one arrives at
x9 = —x8 + 165, thus eliminating one differential equation.
Same procedure is followed for x7,x12. Finally, x14 can be ex-
pressed as x14 2 x10917/911, and the last equation is also redun-
dant. The model can then be rewritten in a simpliﬁed form
involving only 10 state variables. This is done not only for the
sake of mathematical simpliﬁcation, but also to satisfy some
important structural property, such as minimality and accessibil-
ity (Saccomani et al., 2003). This is important, because the
lack of minimality of the model may lead to spurious non-
identiﬁability results for some parameters that may not occur
in a minimal model. Also, if the model has two or more differ-
ential equations dependent on each other, as in this case, the
model would not be accessible, making more difﬁcult the iden-
tiﬁability check of the model from the given initial conditions.

One thus arrives at the following simpliﬁed 10D model:

 

' 561(1) = —91X1C1u1 — 95361 + 96362
5620) = 95361 — 96362
563(1‘) 2 91 C1 u1x1 — 92x3(—x6 + 2.8)
564(1) = 92X3(—X6 + 2-8) — 93364
565(1‘) 2 93364 — 94365

4 5660) = —97X3X6/(1 + 913x13)— (6)
97x4x6/(1 + 913x13) + 98(—x6 + 2.8)02

568(1) = —99X8(—X6 + 2-8) + 910(—X8 + 165)02
56100) = 911(—X8 + 165)
56110) = —91201 M13611

. 56130) = X10914/(915 + X10) — 9163613

with the corresponding initial conditions given in Equation (4).

To check global identiﬁability of this simpliﬁed 10D model
with DAISY, the user has to write in the input ﬁle the ordered
list of the output and state variables, the list of the unknown
parameters, the model equations and the known initial condi-
tions. Later in the text, the results will be illustrated. For explan-
ations of the technical terms, one may consult Bellu et al. (2007).

DAISY automatically ranks the input, output, state variables
and their derivatives, starts the pseudodivision algorithm, i.e. the
Ritt algorithm, and calculates the characteristic set of the model.
This is a minimal set of differential polynomials, which provides
an equivalent description of the model. The subset made of the
ﬁrst eight (i.e. the number of model outputs) differential polyno-
mials does not depend on the state variable x and provides the
so-called input—output relation of the model. In particular, these
involve higher derivatives of the input and output signals.

To speed up the algorithm, it may be advisable to add derivatives
of the actual output functions to the system equations. This is
legitimate, as Ritt algorithm is based on differentiation, besides
the usual algebraic operations.

After a suitable normalization, the input—output polynomials
can be rendered monic, and their coefﬁcients provide a set of
rational functions of the unknown parameter 9, which form the
so-called exhaustive summary of the model.

Identiﬁability is tested by checking injectivity of the exhaustive
summary with respect to the parameter 9. We should, in prin-
ciple, calculate the range set of these functions. This could be
done in symbolic language evaluating them at a symbolic par-
ameter value. In practice, but only to speed up the process, in-
stead of choosing a symbolic parameter value, we can use a set
of randomly chosen numerical points in the range set. Solution
of these algebraic equations is done by computing a Grobner
basis, by applying the Buchberger algorithm. The results show
that all the parameters are uniquely identiﬁable except for
911, 915, 917, 921 and 922, which have an inﬁnite number of solu-
tions. Thus, the model is non-identiﬁable.

The analysis actually provides some hint on how to simplify
the model to make it globally identiﬁable. For example, by as-
signing known values to parameters 921 and 922, the model would
become globally identiﬁable.

3.2 EAR approach

The identiﬁability of a dynamic model is closely related to the
properties of the Jacobian matrix containing the derivatives of
signals assumed to be measured (i.e. model outputs) and their
time derivatives, with respect to the parameters. Furthermore,
structural identiﬁability is a generic property of the symbolic
form of the system and measurement equations, and hence it is
sufﬁcient to analyze this property for a speciﬁc (generic) point in
parameter space. In the EAR approach, this is utilized using
exact modular integer arithmetics for fast computations, i.e.
the specialization of parameter values to random integers only
serves the purpose of fast computation of structural properties
and has nothing to do with biological feasibility. The direct ap-
proach of ﬁrst deriving the entries of the J acobian matrix in
symbolic form, inserting integer values and then computing the
matrix rank is not feasible for anything but very small systems,
because of extensive swell of the size of symbolic expressions.
Instead, it can be shown that the numerical values of the entries
of the J acobian matrix can be computed efﬁciently by computing
power series solutions to the original ODEs augmented by their
corresponding parametric sensitivity differential equations, fol-
lowed by insertion into the output sensitivity expressions the
obtained truncated power series solutions of the state and state
sensitivities. To prevent the need for computation with rational
numbers and the inherent swell in size of numerators and de-
nominators, all computations are carried out modulo a large
prime. To summarize, the above approach is based on exact
(modular) arithmetics for obtaining the entries in the J acobian
as well as for the subsequent rank computation; hence, the name
EAR. It is implemented in terms of a fully documented

Mathematica application and is completely automatic once a
speciﬁc system description has been provided.
Here is an outline of the steps of the algorithm

(1) ldentiﬁability is a generic property of the symbolic form of
the system and measurement equations. Therefore, any
generic point can be analyzed. First, specializations of par-
ameters and initial conditions are generated.

(2) Specialize inputs to truncated random integer coefﬁcient
power series.

(3) Truncated power series solutions of x, ﬁg) and {3% are com-

puted, using the system and sensitivity system equations.

(4) The power series are inserted in the expressions for the
derivatives of the outputs with respect to the initial state
and with respect to the parameters

 

d _ d _% 3x (7)
dx(0)y _ dx(0) _ ax 9x(0)
d d ahax ah
ay=ah=aa+a (8)

resulting in power series representations of the output sen-
sitivity derivatives.

(5) Identiﬁcation of the coefﬁcients of the truncated power
series of the output derivatives with the coefﬁcients of a
general Taylor expansion of the output sensitivity deriva-
tives gives the higher order time-derivatives of the output
sensitivity derivatives, i.e. the entries of the specialized
J acobian matrix.

(6) Calculate the rank.

(7) If the matrix is rank-deﬁcient, the non-identiﬁable param-
eters are found using the fact that removing the corres-
ponding columns from the matrix do not change the rank.

The analysis using the Mathematica package is fully auto-
matic. Further information about the package and instructions
on how to obtain it can be found at: http://www.fcc.chalmers.se/
sys/products/identiﬁabilityanalysis.

Included in the package is, apart from the identiﬁability test
demonstrated above, also functionality for automatically ﬁnding
minimal sets of output expressions that guarantee a structurally
identiﬁable model. This functionality is described in Anguelova
et al. (2012).

3.3 PL approach

The PL approach determines the identiﬁability of the model par-
ameters by posing a parameter estimation problem. Here, we use the
original data of Raia et al. (201 1) and investigate both the structural
and practical identiﬁability of the model parameters. For parameter
estimation, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is applied. The
likelihood L(9) describes the probability of the data given certain
parameter values 9. The MLE ﬁt of the dynamic model to the ex-
perimental data for MedB-l cell is shown in Figure 1, and the MLE
parameter values are given in Table 3. Likelihood proﬁles were
calculated as described in Raue et al. (2009) by

Fig. 1. Fit of the dynamic model given in Section 2.4 to the original data of Raia et al. (2011) for lymphoma-derived MedB-l cells. The cells were treated
with four different doses of IL-13. The data were obtained by Immunoblot and qRT-PCR measurements. Some measurements are on a relative
concentration scale given in arbitrary units [au] and some on an absolute concentration scale [abs] that corresponds to molecules per cell (x1000)

where for each ﬁxed value of parameter 9,, all other parameters
91- 75 9,- are reoptimized. Figure 2 shows the results of the analysis.
A perfectly ﬂat proﬁle indicates a structural non-identiﬁable
parameter. Perfectly ﬁat proﬁles reveal the ﬁve structural non-
identiﬁable parameters. The change of the parameters 91- along a
proﬁle of a structurally non-identiﬁable parameter 9,- can be used
to determine functionally related groups between the structurally
non-identiﬁable parameters (Fig. 3). Here, the ﬁve structurally
non-identiﬁable parameters are functionally related in two
groups. In the ﬁrst group,
1
917 922

indicates that the concentration scale of CD274 mRNA (x14) is
not ﬁxed by measurements. In the second group,

915 N i and 915 N 911
21
indicates that the concentration scale of SOCS3 mRNA (x10) is
not ﬁxed by measurements. Using this information, two new
experiments that determine the respective concentration scales
can be used to resolve these structural non-identiﬁabilities.

The likelihood proﬁles can also be used to assess practical
identiﬁability and to calculate conﬁdence intervals of the
model parameters. A threshold in the likelihood, measured
from the MLE point, can be used to compute likelihood-based
conﬁdence intervals [for details on the statistics, see in Raue et al.
(2009)]. Proﬁles that have a unique minimum, but do not cross
the conﬁdence threshold, reveal six practically non-identiﬁable
parameters: 93, 94, 912, 914, 916 and 919. The likelihood proﬁles

can also be used to design experiment that resolve practical non-
identiﬁabilities [for an illustrative example, see Raue et al.
(2010)]. The remaining parameters are both structurally and
practically identiﬁable, and have ﬁnite conﬁdence intervals; see
Table 3 for values.

The PL approach is implemented in the freely available
MATLAB software packages Data2Dynamics (Raue et al.,
2013) and PottersWheel (Maiwald and Timmer, 2008). For the
Data2Dynamics software packages, the Raia et al. (2011) model
and data are included in the software as an example application.
The software package is open source and freely available on the
Web site: https://bitbucket.org/d2d-development/d2d-software.

4 DISCUSSION

The results of all three approaches are in good agreement for the
benchmark application considered here. Five of 23 parameters
are consistently classiﬁed as structurally non-identiﬁable. The
procedure to reproduce and interpret the results obtained by
each of the three approaches was presented and can serve as
reference for further application.

The strength of the DAISY approach is to check for global
identiﬁability, i.e. it checks the uniqueness of the parameter so-
lution. Thus, it is able to distinguish between global and local
identiﬁability. Being based on differential algebra methods,
DAISY can directly deal only with polynomial or rational func-
tions f and b. However, the method can be generalized to deal
with some non-polynomial functions, e. g. exponential functions.
Although the program is usually very fast, in the order of few
seconds, for complex models the algorithm may not successfully

Fig. 2. Likelihood proﬁles for all 23 model parameters. The parameters are allowed to vary between —5 and +3 on a loglo-scale. The MLE point is
indicated by asterisks. The red dashed line corresponds to a threshold that indicates a 95% conﬁdence level. The points of pass-over of proﬁle and
threshold determine likelihood-based conﬁdence intervals. Perfectly ﬂat proﬁles reveal ﬁve structural non-identiﬁable parameters:
CD274mRNA_production, SOCS3_accumulation, SOCS3mRNA_production, scale_CD274mRNA_obs and scale_SOCS3mRNA_obs. In addition,
proﬁles that have a unique minimum but do not cross the conﬁdence threshold reveal six practically non-identiﬁable parameters: DecoyR_binding,
SOCS3_degradation, SOCS3_translation, pRec_degradation, pRec_intern and scale _pIL4Ra_obs. The remaining parameters are both structurally and

practically identiﬁable and have ﬁnite conﬁdence intervals

terminate because of a lack of memory of the system. In most
cases, however, it is possible to simplify the calculations required
by the algorithm by eliminating redundant model equations by
hand. This was done for the benchmark application considered
here.

The main advantage of the EAR approach is that it is fast and
can handle large and complex systems. The system analyzed in
this article is considered small and simple for this approach.
Systems on the scale of 100 states and 100 parameters can be
handled. One limitation of the EAR approach is that it requires
the vector valued functions f, g and h to be rational functions of
their arguments. This limitation is not as restrictive as it may ﬁrst
sound, however, as it can be shown that any function, which in
itself is the solution to an equation such as (1), can be handled
through an extended state space approach (Lindskog 1996).

Even if-statements can be closely approximated using rational
functions.

The strength of the PL approach is that it does not pose any
restrictions on the algebraic form of the model equations. Even
non-algebraic constructs such as if-statements or constraints on
the parameters or model dynamics can be handled. It also allows
for statements on practical identiﬁability and conﬁdence inter-
vals. Besides the structurally non-identiﬁable parameters, six par-
ameters are practically non-identiﬁable considering the data
available from Raia et al. (2011). However, owing to the under-
lying parameter estimation problem, issues such as local minima
have to be handled with care. In such case, it might be necessary
to repeat proﬁle calculations for multiple minima detected in the
objective function to enhance robustness of the results (Raue
et al., 2013).

Fig. 3. Likelihood proﬁles and corresponding loglo-change of the related parameters along the proﬁle for structurally non-identiﬁable
parameters CD274mRNA_production (left) and SOCS3_accumulation (right). The lower panels reveal that the ﬁve structurally non-identiﬁable
parameters are functionally related in two groups. In the ﬁrst group, CD274mRNA_production ~ 1/ scale_CD274mRNA_obs indicates that the con-
centration scale of CD274 mRNA is not ﬁxed by measurements. In the second group, SOCS3_accumulation ~ l/scale_SOCS3mRNA_obs and
SOCS3_accumulation ~ SOCS3mRNA_production indicate that the concentration scale of SOCS3 mRNA is not ﬁxed by measurements

5 CONCLUSION

The presented approaches allow for comparable and reliable
conclusions about structural identiﬁability and can readily be
used in Systems Biology applications. Software implementation
of all approaches is freely available. It is important and good
practice to double check results with different, but comparable,
approaches. Here, we provide a case study that can serve as
reference and hand-on guide to apply and interpret the results
of three current approaches to structural identiﬁability analysis.
The results of identiﬁability analysis can be helpful to provide
guidelines on how to simplify the model structure or design
additional experiments that enhance the predictive power of a
mathematical model.

All three approaches examined in this paper are useful for real
application examples. in many cases, all three approaches work
equally well, but in some cases one of the three is preferred. If the
system is very large and/ or if the analysis must be fast, then EAR
is the preferred approach. If it is of importance to get truly global
identiﬁability, DAISY is the preferred approach. If practical
identiﬁability is important, or if the equations include nonra-
tional expressions like if-statements, then PL should be used.
Using combinations of approaches can sometimes give the
strengths of all approaches to the analysis.

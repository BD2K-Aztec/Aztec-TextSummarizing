ABSTRACT

Motivation: The understanding of the molecular sources for
diseases like cancer can be significantly improved by computational
models. Recently, Boolean networks have become very popular
for modeling signaling and regulatory networks. However, such
models rely on a set of Boolean functions that are in general not
known. Unfortunately, while detailed information on the molecular
interactions becomes available in large scale through electronic
databases, the information on the Boolean functions does not
become available simultaneously and has to be included manually
into the models, if at all known.

Results: We propose a new Boolean approach which can directly
utilize the mechanistic network information available through modern
databases. The Boolean function is implicitly defined by the reaction
mechanisms. Special care has been taken for the treatment of kinetic
features like inhibition. The method has been applied to a signaling
model combining the Wnt and MAPK pathway.

1 INTRODUCTION

An important focus in systems biology are emergent properties
of biological systems, properties which arise from the system as
a whole and which cannot be explained by looking at individual
components alone. A common theme in this evolving ﬁeld are
biological networks, which describe complex relations between
biological entities. Modeling these networks uncovers the systems
behavior as a whole based on the properties and interactions of the
contained compounds.

An important subset of such networks describes mechanistic
processes among biochemical species. Such processes play an
important role in cellular metabolism, signal transductions and gene
regulation. Computational models of these networks have been
investigated for a long time. A ﬁrst category of models concentrate
on single pathways, i.e. functionally related parts of the networks,
with the use of differential equations (Heinrich et al., 2002; Kofahl
and Wolf, 2010; Rapoport et al., 1974; Rizzi et al., 1997; Schoeberl

et al., 2002; Teusink et al., 2000; Wolf and Heinrich, 2000; Zi and
Klipp, 2007). Such models usually yield high-quality predictions of
the system dynamics with quantitative information on the molecule
concentrations. Those models, however, require accurate kinetic
parameters.

The emergence of large-scale electronic databases like KEGG
(Kanehisa et al., 2010), Reactome (Matthews et al., 2009) or the
Pathway Interaction Database (PID)(Schaefer et al., 2009) opened
new directions in modeling biological networks. For large models, it
is often unfeasible to obtain all the necessary kinetic parameters. In
such cases, so-called structural methods are applied. These include
elementary ﬂux modes (Schuster and Hilgetag, 1994; Schuster et al. ,
2000), ﬂux balance analysis (Bonarius et al., 1997; Edwards and
Palsson, 2000) and Petri nets (Genrich et al., 2001; Reddy et al.,
1996).

A further structural method that became very popular in particular
for signaling and gene regulatory networks are Boolean networks
(de Jong, 2002; Fisher and Henzinger, 2007; Handorf et al., 2005;
Kauffman, 1969, 1986; Saez—Rodriguez et al., 2009; Samaga et al.,
2009). In a Boolean network, each compound is represented by
a network node and has an associated Boolean value. This value
either represents the existence of a compound, i.e. it is TRUE if the
compound is present in a signiﬁcant concentration and FALSE if not,
or it represents the activity. In the network, nodes are connected by
edges that represent biochemical interactions. The Boolean value of
a node is calculated in each step of the algorithm through a Boolean
function, which depends on the Boolean values of all inbound
nodes.

Usually, while the topology of the network is known (e.g. from
interaction databases or qualitative interaction studies), the Boolean
function is unclear. One approach is to estimate this function by
adapting the model to experimental data as shown in Saez—Rodriguez
et al. (2009). In Handorf et al. (2005), we introduced a different
Boolean approach for metabolic networks, the concept of Scopes,
which circumvents this problem. Here, a (metabolic) reaction is
active if all of its substrates are present (i.e. TRUE). Subsequently,
all compounds become TRUE for which at least one producing
reaction is active. Hence, the Boolean function is clearly deﬁned
by the topology and is represented by the conjunction (AND) of all
substrates of a reaction.

In signaling and gene regulatory networks, the situation is more
complex. In fact, there exist different Views on these networks. A
phenomenological View (Fig. 1a) represents experimental ﬁndings,
like A and C activate and B and D inactivate protein B. This View,
which is similar to the SBGN1 Activity Flow (Novre et al., 2009),

is used for classical Boolean models as indicated above and requires
a Boolean function, which converts the states of the proteins A to D
into the state of protein B.

Clearly, there exist molecular mechanisms behind the
experimental observations, which can be described by biochemical
reactions. A View which is particularly popular in differential
equation models is shown in Figure 1b, where reactions have
substrates and products as in metabolic network and can also be
inﬂuenced by a set of activators or inhibitors.

However, this View is still not fully mechanistic. Reactions are
never directly activated or inhibited by a compound. The only agent
that effects the reaction rate is the catalyst. Other modiﬁcations are
indirect by inﬂuencing the activities of the substrates or the catalyst
(Fig. 1c). Within this fully mechanistic View, which is similar to the
SBGN Process Description, the Boolean function is again clear: its
a conjunction (AND) of all substrates and the catalyst.

This type of mechanistic network information can be retrieved
from modern databases like Reactome or PID. With the present
method, we are able to automatically create a functional Boolean
network model including the Boolean function for signaling or gene
regulatory pathways.

Simulation of the resulting Boolean model allows to explore
potential qualitative behavior of the network upon stimulation.
Obviously, such a Boolean network cannot reproduce behavior that
results from the kinetics of the participating biochemical reactions.
This holds in particular for inhibition which in the fully mechanistic
View is only indirectly included (inhibition occurs due to competition
for the same substrate, see Section 3).

This is in contrast to manually built classical Boolean networks,
which are derived from experimental observations and therefore

naturally include inhibitory effects. By including phenomenological
data, the classical Boolean networks are actually not purely
topological anymore. Including an inhibitory interaction already
assumes that the compound concentrations or the kinetic properties
of the participating reactions are in certain suitable ranges. The
fully mechanistic View, however, does not contain implicit kinetic
information. Hence, this type of information has to be added to the
automatically created network as discussed in Section 2.

The proposed Boolean approach has been applied to a signaling
and gene regulatory network describing the interaction between
the Wnt pathway and the MAP kinase cascade. The targets of
the two pathways, ,B-catenin and ERK, are known initiators for
differentiation and proliferation and are also of great interest in
diseases like cancer. In Kim et al. (2007), a model of these two
interacting pathways has been published. It includes crosstalk at the
signaling and gene regulatory level.

Our model could reproduce their ﬁndings. We also manually
implemented a classical Boolean network using CellNetAnalyzer
(Klamt et al., 2007) and compared it to our model.

2 APPROACH

We implemented the network model of crosstalk between the Wnt
and MAPK pathways presented in Kim et al. (2007), as shown in
Figure 2. To this end, we imported the reactions from the Reactome
database (see Section S4 in Supplementary Material). The imported
network was further reﬁned to match the model of Kim et al. as not
all utilized reactions are in the database, yet. It should be noted that
this is not a mandatory step in general. The method described here
is able to directly use the data from the database if the contained
information already sufﬁciently describes the analyzed system.

Furthermore, kinetic features of the system, like inhibition, have
been identiﬁed and included into the model as described in the
Section 3.

In the reﬁned model, the crosstalk between the Wnt and MAPK
pathways is represented through, ﬁrst, an unknown protein X which
is transcribed in response to the transcription factor ,B-catenin
and which activates cRaf upstream of ERK, second, an inhibition
of GSK3,B by active ERK which in turn inhibits the destruction
complex of ,B-catenin in the Wnt pathway and third, a direct
stimulation of RAS by the Wnt signal. The known inhibitory
interactions in the pathways were incorporated as mentioned before.
The Supplementary Figure S6 shows the complete network.

In order to compare the result of our scopes method to the result
of the classical Boolean approach, we manually built an activity
ﬂow model of the participating species. This model (shown in Fig.
3) is much less complex than the model created from the databases
since it omits many mechanistic details and requires the manual
deﬁnition of the network logic. Model simulations were performed
using synchronous Boolean simulation in the ‘odefy’ module of
CellNetAnalyzer.

In a ﬁrst step, we investigated the effect of the Wnt stimulus
on the two target proteins ERK and ,B-catenin for the MAPK and
the Wnt pathway. Figure 4 shows similar behavior for our method
and the classical Boolean approach as provided by CellNetAnalyzer.
Before the Wnt stimulus is applied, the system is usually assumed
to be off in the absence of crosstalk. The positive feedback loop
introduced with the crosstalk, however, leads to a periodic activity
of the two target proteins in both models. Once the Wnt stimulus

is applied, both, ERK and ,B-catenin become continuously active.
If the Wnt stimulus is removed (not shown for CellNetAnalyzer),
both proteins stay active which is again due to the positive feedback
loop.

We performed an attractor analysis for both models, which yielded
results consistent with the above observations. Please see Section S3
in the Supplementary Material for further details.

Kim et al. reported similar results using a model of differential
equations. The effect of the feedback loop is actually dependent
on the kinetic parameters and in particular on whether the signal
through the crosstalk is strong enough for sustained activation. For a
standard parameter set, they reported that the activity stayed in a low
state without the stimulus, switched to active with the stimulus and
returned to the low state after the removal of the stimulus. However,
by varying the synthesis rate of ,B-catenin or the phosphatase activity
for ERK, the system showed an increased activity already before
the stimulus and a sustained activity after stimulus removal. This
parameter-dependent distinction cannot be made with the Boolean
approaches.

Fig. 4. Response of ,8-catenin and ERK to WNT stimulus: (a) results for
the scope method; (b) results for CellNetAnalyzer. Here, time denotes the
step number of the Boolean simulation, which is an abstract time that can be
roughly considered as a monotonous function of the real time.

At that point, it should be noted that the oscillations in the off-
state observed in the Boolean systems are artifacts of the Boolean
formalism. In fact, in a differential equation model they would
not correspond to a stable limit cycle. It is a mere expression
of that an initial activation in the cycle is passed around without
being attenuated or ampliﬁed. Differential equation models could
show oscillations of this type transiently, in particular if the initial
activation time is shorter than the round-trip time.

Kim et al. argued that the activating potential of the reported
feedback loop may be important in particular in cancer, indicating
that a slight variation of the kinetic rates may result in a
persistent activation of the proliferation related Wnt and MAPK
pathways even in the absences of the corresponding stimuli. They
further examined their model by a set of interference experiments,
which they experimentally validated. First, ,B-catenin has been
overexpressed (+,B-cat), second, active ERK levels have been
increased by phosphatase inhibition using okadaic acid (OA) , third,
GSK3,B has been inhibited by SB216763 (SB) and fourth, the effect
of ERK activation and GSK3,B inhibition has been studied in
combination (SB + OA).

and both ( SB + OA)]. The (upper) graph shows the results for the scope
method, the (lower) for CellNetAnalyzer. The different curves have been
shifted slightly to avoid overlap.

We repeated the experiments using our method and compared
it with the results from the classical Boolean approach (Fig. 5).
The results from the two Boolean methods are similar and actually
identical with respect to the temporal order of the responses to
the different interferences when allowing that two effects reported
at different times with one method may occur at the same time
in the other method. One exception is the short initial activation
of ,6—catenin for CA in CellNetAnalyzer, which is due to the
unstimulated oscillation discussed earlier.

The observed temporal order is in line with the results from Kim
et al. With ,B-catenin overexpression, ,B-catenin comes up ﬁrst while
ERK activation shows a long delay. OA treatment shows fast ERK
response and a delayed ,B-catenin activation. SB has a similar effect
as ,B-catenin overexpression, whereas the combination SB + 0A
shows the fastest effect compared to the two single interferences.

3 METHOD

The purpose of the proposed method is to model mechanistic reaction
networks as provided by modern electronic database using a novel Boolean
approach. The method is based on the previously published concept of
scopes. Scopes have been developed for metabolic reaction networks. It is
a step-wise algorithm. Initially, a set of seed compounds is deﬁned, which
is the set of initially available compounds. In each following step, all active
reactions are determined by testing whether all substrates of an reaction are
available. Then, all products of the active reactions are added to the set of
available compounds. This process yields a set of compounds (the scope)
that are synthesizable from the seed compounds.

Here we adapt the concept to signaling networks. The challenge is to
include the effects of catalysts, activators and inhibitors. As discussed before,
in the fully mechanistic View, toward which modern databases evolve,
actually only catalysts remain. This can be included in the method by simply
requiring the availability of all substrates and the catalyst for the execution
of a reaction. We call this the static mode of our method, which is equivalent
to the previously deﬁned scopes.

Clearly, in signaling and gene regulatory networks, dynamical effects, and
in particular inhibition, are especially important for the cellular functions of
these networks. As argued before, in the fully mechanistic View, inhibition is

indirect. It occurs due to reactions where an inhibitor catalyzes a modiﬁcation
of a compound, thereby leading to a depletion of the active form of the
compound. To distinguish inhibiting reactions from other non-inhibiting
reactions which use the same compound as substrate, an inhibitory ﬂag has
to be set to mark that the reaction is inhibitory to a speciﬁc substrate.

As an example, we consider the reaction A* +B* —> AIB* from Figure 1c,
which depletes A* and thereby inactivates it. This effect is described by an
‘inhibition ﬂag’ to these reactions, which is Visualized by tee-shaped arrows
in Figures 1c and Section S6 in Supplementary Material. This ﬂag essentially
describes kinetic information. It means that for example in case of Michaelis—
Menten kinetics, the Km-Value is sufﬁciently low and the VmaX-Value is high
enough to cause a low enough concentration of A* such that other reactions
depending on A* are not signiﬁcantly activated.

For the dynamic mode of the method, this ﬂag is used to include inhibitory
effects into the Boolean network approach. Therefore, we assign to each
compound node two Boolean variables, one indicating the presence of
the compound (as in the classical approach) and the second indicating its
depletion.

We further support the second paradigm of inhibition, the direct inhibition
of a reaction by an inhibitor (cf Fig. 1b). Although databases like Reactome
encourage their curators to use the fully mechanistic View, if known, this
paradigm will still be around for the next time. The activity ﬂow scheme
(cf Fig. 1a) is not supported as this is perfectly covered by classic Boolean
approaches.

A part from inhibition, there are also other dynamical features, which may
inﬂuence the qualitative behavior of the automatically generated Boolean
model. In particular, depending on the actual implementation in the database,
a simple phosphorylation may become an amplifying feedback loop. For
example in our test case, phosphorylated MEK (a kinase) binds to its
target ERK, phosphorylates it and dissociates. Once activated, phospho-
MEK will continuously activate ERK as it is recycled. In biology, such
an ampliﬁcation may of course happen, but its quantitative effect strongly
depends on the kinetic parameters, in particular, on how fast phospho-MEK
is dephosphorylated and, hence, deactivated.

For our example network, we use an instantaneous deactivation of
phospho-MEK after ERK activation. This is implemented by connecting the
dissociation reaction to a new compound, which cannot be used for further
target activation.

Fig. 7. Module ‘step’: calculate a single iteration. The algorithm iterates over
all inhibiting reaction (irea), propagating reaction (prea) and all reactions
(rea). Iterating over ‘irea’ and ‘prea’ create a new array ‘deplete’ containing
compounds, which become depleted in the current step. When iterating over
all reactions, products of active reactions are set in the new array ‘new’.
‘New’ and ‘depleted’ are set to ‘present’ and ‘depleted’, respectively. This
ensures synchronous operation. Please note that the ﬁgure oversimpliﬁes the
algorithm a bit. To be exact: when iterating over ‘irea’ and ‘prea’ depleted
substrates are only allowed if they are the ‘inhibiting’ substrates. Further,
in the loop over ‘rea’, inhibiting reactions can be active if their inhibiting
substrates are depleted and hence the products are activated. This is the
desired behavior.

The method is implemented as follows: the second inhibitory paradigm is
dealt with by requiring all reaction inhibitors to be absent. Admittedly, this
is not the only Boolean function possible here. However, as the inclusion of
this type of inhibition is only a concession to the current data situation and
the usage of this type is already very sparse in e.g. the Reactome database
we assume this to be a practical solution.

The ﬁrst inhibition paradigm, the depletion inhibition, is more
complicated. As mentioned, an additional Boolean variable is introduced
representing the depletion state of a compound. This variable is set to TRUE if
at least one outgoing inhibitory reaction is active. All non-inhibitory reactions
are only active if all of their substrates and the catalyst are available and
none of these is depleted. The algorithm is summarized in Figure 6. The
implementation of a single iteration step is shown in Figure 7.

The algorithm also features depletion propagation. This is important for
example if two forms of a protein can be considered in quasi steady state, i.e.
they can be fast and reversibly converted into one another. If, for example,
the second form is depleted then also the ﬁrst form needs to be depleted and,
hence, inactivated even if form two is originally produced from form one.
This information is included into the reaction converting form one into form
two by indicating that the depletion state of the product is passed on to the
substrate.

Nodes initially set (TRUE) in the Wnt/MAPK pathway for our approach and in
CellNetAnalyzer. These nodes will be held TRUE during the complete simulation. All
other compounds are initially FALSE but may change during simulation.

A step by step walk-through of the algorithm on an example network is
provided in the Section 81 in Supplementary Material. The method can be
reformulated as a classical Boolean network by introducing further ‘Virtual’
nodes. This is discussed in the Section S2 in Supplementary Material.

As for models in general, initial conditions are important. Setting only the
stimulants (i.e. Wnt and EGF in the test case) to TRUE will not be sufﬁcient.
In fact, there are a lot of proteins in signaling pathways, which are present
either in their inactive or active forms. In that respect, the two approaches
differ, as for our method inactive forms need to be initially provided (e.g.
unphosphorylated MEK must be present), while for the classical approach
the inactive forms are ignored. There is also a number of active forms, which
are assumed to be present in the beginning. Table 1 shows the initially present
nodes for the two Boolean approaches for discussed Wnt/MAPK model.

In principle, the information on initial presence or activity of compounds
depends on prior biological knowledge. However, for larger networks,
deﬁning the initial conditions manually may be tedious. As proposed in
Handorf et al. (2008), reasonable sets of initial conditions can be inferred
automatically from the network topology. For this method in particular, the
above-deﬁned static mode will be important.

4 DISCUSSION

We proposed a new method for the automated generation of Boolean
network models from curated mechanistic network databases. Here,
the Boolean functions are implicitly deﬁned. Kinetic properties of
the biological system, such as inhibitions or ampliﬁcations may
inﬂuence the system behavior but are not automatically included
when importing from these databases. This requires an additional
review of the model and may require further reﬁnements.

In fact, one should refrain from perceiving Boolean networks as
purely topological. They contain indeed kinetic information as they
are generally inferred from the observed dynamical system behavior,
even if the exact kinetic parameters are not known and, hence, are
not part of the network deﬁnitions. However, kinetic features will
enter the Boolean network in terms of inhibitory or activatory edges.

As discussed, inhibition in mechanistic reaction networks, as
available through the mentioned electronic databases, occurs
through competition of different reactions for the same substrate
or catalysts. Depending on the kinetic parameters, one reaction may
deplete the substrate concentration signiﬁcantly, thereby leading to
an inactivation of other reactions. If such inhibitions are observed
in a particular pathway, they can be added to the network in a
subsequent functional curation step and considered by our proposed
Boolean method.

We tested our method on an example network describing the
crosstalk of the Wnt and MAPK pathways. This network model
contains several cases of the mentioned substrate depletion, for
example the inhibition of ,B-catenin by binding to the destruction
complex. We compared our method to the classical Boolean
approach as well as to the results of Kim et al. (2007) who did
a differential equation model with experimental validation.

The two Boolean approaches show similar results, as expected.
Also, the Boolean approaches could reproduce many features shown
by Kim et al. In fact, the temporal order of the events was the same as
in the more sophisticated differential equation model. Quantitative
effects like concentrations or the strength of the feedback are of
course beyond the reach of the Boolean approaches.

Clearly, the main advantage of the proposed method over the
classical approach is the straightforward model deﬁnition using
curated reaction network databases. This gain is even more important
in the context of the fast growing amount of interactions available
through these databases. In fact, while it was possible to create the
Boolean logic of our sample network by hand, such a task will be
tedious when talking about databases containing several thousand
reactions.

Still, our method comes with a number of drawbacks that
are common to all Boolean approaches. Concentrations and
interaction strengths cannot be fully covered by TRUE and FALSE
values. The usage of two Boolean variables per compound,
i.e. inactive, active and activated but depleted allows us to
model some concentration-dependent kinetic effects like indirect
inhibition by depletion. However, the general problem of the very
crude representation of reality remains. For example, antagonistic
effects like phosphorylation and dephosphorylation will lead to
intermediate compound activity, which has to be mapped to either
TRUE or FALSE in a biologically meaningful way.

Treatment of such effects is, however, still possible in Boolean
approaches by choosing the right network wiring. For the above-
mentioned phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles that are a
common motif in signaling networks, the one or the other step
is usually more important for the signal transduction. In case of
unspeciﬁc phosphatases, it can be assumed that their regulation
occurs external to the pathway under investigation. Hence, removing
the dephosphorylation step will mostly yield the desired result.
Furthermore, the function of the phosphatases especially in MAP
kinase cascades is rather not to deactivate proteins but to keep the
activity at a certain operation point, which is optimal for the pathway
function. Clearly, this kind of model reﬁnement cannot be done in
an automated fashion.

For future improvements of the automatic import of Boolean
networks from databases, the curation of mechanistic databases
should become sensitive for the interplay of topology and kinetics.
The databases may indicate the kinetic mode a reaction usually
operates in, e. g. when it is known that a reaction depletes the active
form of a compound this could be marked by a ‘inhibition’ ﬂag.

With the size of the network also the number of errors can
be expected to increase in the data. While our method assumes
correct network data in ﬁrst place, this can be used to actually
verify the network information by comparing the simulation results
to experimental results. With methods for model extension and
prediction of initial conditions (Christian et al. , 2009; Handorf et al.,
2008) which are based on the concept of scopes, deﬁcits of those
networks may be identiﬁed and corrections can be proposed.

To summarize, the presented method facilitates usage of
mechanistic electronic databases by deﬁning large parts of the
network logic from the topology. The difﬁculties of predicting
the exact dynamical behavior of the biological system due to its
kinetic parameters has been discussed and possible means of model
reﬁnement have been proposed. Hence, mechanistic databases and
automatic import of these has the potential to push the development
of Boolean network models of signaling and regulatory networks,
although further review of the network data, in terms of a functional
curation, may be necessary.

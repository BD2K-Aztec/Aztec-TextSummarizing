Abstract

Motivation: Nowadays, knowledge extraction methods from Next Generation Sequencing data are
highly requested. In this work, we focus on RNA-seq gene expression analysis and specifically on
case—control studies with rule-based supervised classification algorithms that build a model able to
discriminate cases from controls. State of the art algorithms compute a single classification model
that contains few features (genes). On the contrary, our goal is to elicit a higher amount of know-
ledge by computing many classification models, and therefore to identify most of the genes related
to the predicted class.

Results: We propose CAMUR, a new method that extracts multiple and equivalent classification
models. CAMUR iteratively computes a rule-based classification model, calculates the power set of
the genes present in the rules, iteratively eliminates those combinations from the data set, and per-
forms again the classification procedure until a stopping criterion is verified. CAMUR includes an
ad—hoc knowledge repository (database) and a querying tool.

We analyze three different types of RNA-seq data sets (Breast, Head and Neck, and Stomach
Cancer) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and we validate CAMUR and its models also on non-
TCGA data. Our experimental results show the efficacy of CAMUR: we obtain several reliable equiva-
lent classification models, from which the most frequent genes, their relationships, and the relation
with a particular cancer are deduced.

1 Introduction

Among next generation sequencing experiments, RNA-seq gene
expression profiling stands out as the process of quantifying the
transcriptome abundance by counting the RNA fragments (reads)
that are aligned on a reference genome (Wang et al., 2009).

In this work, we propose a new method for classifying RNA-seq
case—control samples, which is able to compute multiple human
readable classification models. We call this method and its software
implementation CAMUR — Classifier with Alternative and MUltiple
Rule-based models. Although RNA-seq data analysis tools (Howe

et al., 2011; Kuehn et al., 2008) are widely used in case—control
studies, the novelty of CAMUR consists in the extraction of several al-
ternative and equivalent rule-based models, which represent relevant
sets of genes related to the case and control samples. CAMUR extracts
multiple classification models by adopting a feature elimination
technique and by iterating the classification procedure.

CAMUR is based on the supervised learning approach (also called
classiﬁcation (Mehta et al., 1996)), the task of inferring a function
from labeled training data (Tan et al., 2005b). Two data sets are
required: (i) the training set, which consists of a group of training
labeled samples, and hence each sample is a pair consisting of an in-
put object — that can be a vector of features (attributes) — and its
associated class label; (ii) the test set, which is used to classify new
samples, after the inferred function is built; the test data may con-
sists of a set of samples, whose class is known, but hidden and used
only for verification purpose. Starting from the training set, a
supervised machine learning algorithm builds the classification
model based on the general hypotheses inferred from the features.
Then, through this model, the classifier is able either to evaluate the
model reliability on the test set, or to make predictions on new
data. In other words, we can describe the classification problem as
the process through which a system learns a mapping function (also
called model) that assigns a sample to a class (Tan et al., 2005b). A
classifier is the output of a supervised machine learning algorithm.
There are many different state of the art classification algorithms:
decision trees (Quinlan, 1993), rule-based (Boros et al., 2005;
Cohen, 1995; Felici and Truemper, 2002; Frank and Witten, 1998;
Gaines and Compton, 1995), ensembles (Bagging, Boosting,
Random forest) (Dietterich, 2000), k-Nearest Neighbour
(Dasarathy, 1990), linear regression (Seber and Lee, 2012), Naive
Bayes (McCallum et al., 1998), neural networks (Haykin et al.,
2009), Perceptrons (Riedmiller, 1994), Support Vector Machines
(SVM) (Vapnik, 1998) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM)
(Tipping, 2001). For further details about the supervised learning
paradigm and the algorithms the reader may refer to (Weitschek et
al., 2014). Classification algorithms are frequently used in gene ex-
pression profiles analysis (Golub et al., 1999; Li et al., 2004;
Nogueira et al., 2003; Park et al., 2014; Pirooznia et al., 2008;
Shaik and Ramakrishna, 2014; Shipp et al., 2002; Tan and Gilbert,
2003; Tothill et al., 2015), in particular for experimental samples
classification, i.e. the automatic assignment of each sample to its
belonging class (e.g. case—control) after examining its profile. Rule-
based classification algorithms are widespread for analyzing gene
expression profiles (Dennis and Muthukrishnan, 2014; Geman et
al., 2004; Hvidsten et al., 2003; Tan et al., 2005a; Weitschek et al.,
2015; Zhou et al., 2003). These types of algorithms produce a
classification model composed of logic formulas that provide an im-
mediate relationship between the class and one or more fea-
tures (genes). The assignment of a given class to each sample is
performed by taking into account the satisfiability of the rules. In
particular, the classifier uses logic propositional formulas in dis-
junctive (or conjunctive) normal form (‘if then rules’) for classifying
the given records. Each classification rule (r) can be represented as:
r,-: Antecedent —> Consequent (e.g. feature1 > 0.7 /\ featurez < 0.4
V feature3 > 0.9 => control). The antecedent contains a conjunction
of attribute tests, each one known as literal (e.g. feature1 > 0.7),
the consequent represents the covered class (e.g. control). Examples
of rule-based classifiers are RIPPER (Cohen, 1995 ), LSQUARE
(Felici and Truemper, 2002), LAD (Boros et al., 2005), RIDOR
(Gaines and Compton, 1995) and PART (Frank and Witten, 1998).

We chose to analyze RNA-seq data with rule-based algorithms,
because of their human readability, i.e. the investigator is provided

with a list of meaningful features (genes) that appear in the rules.
Specifically, among the state of the art classifiers we implement our
method relying on the Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce
Error Reduction — RIPPER algorithm, because it is a robust and ef-
fective rule-based approach that provides reliable case—control mod-
els in terms of classification rates and computational performances
(Lehr et al., 2011). In RNA-seq, rule-based algorithms may provide
a low number of features (genes) into the resulting rules. For ex-
ample, in a binary classification problem the classifier can build a
model made of only two rules, with two or three features (e.g.
genel > 0.7 /\ genez < 0.4 V gene3 > 0.9 => control). Although this
fact does not affect the classification performances, many other fea-
tures that have discriminant power may not be present in the classi-
fication model. Therefore, our aim is to extract a comprehensive
amount of knowledge from the analyzed data composed of equiva-
lent and alternative classification models (i.e. rules). For example, to
maximize the knowledge extraction in RNA-seq samples classifica-
tion, we aim to detect all the genes that are implied with the ana-
lyzed disease, i.e. the discriminant genes that appear in alternative
classification models. For extracting multiple classification solu-
tions, one approach is presented in (Deb and Reddy, 2003), where
the authors found 352 different three-gene combinations providing
a 100% correct classification to the Leukemia gene expression pro-
file data available at (Golub et al., 1999), by extending a genetic al-
gorithm (Deb et al., 2002) into a multi-objectives evolutionary one
that finds multiple and multimodal solutions in one single run
(Miettinen, 1999). Those are defined as solutions that have identical
objective values, but they differ in their format. Furthermore, an-
other classification approach is presented in (Gholami et al., 2012)
and relies on a feature elimination method, which consists of choos-
ing features and then, removing those that do not match an assump-
tion criteria. The deletion is performed in order to obtain a smaller
set of features that can perform as well as the larger one, and hence
the computational overhead is reduced. However, the authors aim is
not to extract alternative and equivalent classification models.
Conversely, we aim to obtain more than one reliable classification
model by performing an iterative feature elimination without imple-
menting an optimization method.

2 Materials and methods

First, the terminology adopted in the paper is introduced. We collect
n samples, each one described by its m features (gene expression pro-
files) and labeled with a class (condition), e.g. normal — tumoral (We
adopt The Cancer Genome Atlas terminology (i.e. normal — tumoral),
where normal corresponds to a healthy sample (control) and tumoral
to a diseased one (case).). The ith sample of the data set is represented

2.1 CAMUR: classifier with alternative and multiple rule-
based models

In this section, we describe CAMUR, a method and a software de-
signed to find alternative and equivalent solutions for a classification
problem. CAMUR is based on:

a rule-based classiﬁer (i.e. in this work RIPPER);
an iterative feature elimination technique;
a repeated classiﬁcation procedure;

PEPE"?

an ad-hoc storage structure for the classiﬁcation rules (CAMUR
database).

In brief, the method iteratively computes a rule-based classification
model through the supervised RIPPER algorithm, calculates the
power set (or a partial combination) of the features present in the
rules, iteratively eliminates those combinations from the data set,
and performs again the classification procedure until a stopping cri-
terion is verified.

In greater details, CAMUR executes at first the RIPPER algorithm,
which extracts from a training set the classification model that con-
tains rules with a number of features (i.e. genes) and their values (i.e.
quantification levels). Accuracy and F — measure (see Eq. 1) are used
on a test set to evaluate the extracted classification model. Then,
CAMUR stores the classification model and the results into a database
and extracts the features from the generated model. We call this set
of features S, (where t is the current iteration) and we define the list
where those features are memorized as FL. After that, CAMUR com-
putes the power set of the features P, by storing all the combinations
into the main memory. In the following, we refer to the Original
Data Set of features as ODS. Starting from Pt, the software performs
a feature elimination by deleting from ODS one combination of fea-
tures at time (i.e. an item of the power set) and executes the RIPPER
classification algorithm on the new data set (ODS — pti) with pt,-
6 Pt (pt,- is the ith element of Pt and j = 1,. . . , |Pt|). All the results of
the elimination and classification steps are memorized in the CAMUR
database. These operations are iterated on the new generated data
sets (ODS — pti) with ptl- 7E pk] where la <t and l: 1,. . . , |Pk|,
updating FL at each iteration. We highlight that the power set (PtH)
generation on the new feature sets St+1 is performed by not taking
into account duplicate combinations that occurred in previous
power sets Pk with la 6 [1,t + 1). CAMUR terminates the execution
when one of the following conditions is satisfied:

1. the reliability of the classiﬁcation models is below a given thresh-
old, e.g. F — measure (see Eq. 1) lower than 0.85;

2. the list of features FL has been completely processed;

3. the maximum number of iterations has been reached.

At the end of this procedure, we have a collection of alternative clas-
sification models composed of several features that are able to dis-
tinguish the samples with high reliability. For evaluating the
classification models and consequently to terminate the procedure,
we adopt the accuracy and the F — measure (refer to Eq. 1). Given
True Positives (TP), objects of that class recognized in the same
class; False Positives (FP), objects not belonging to that class recog-
nized in that class; True Negatives (TN), objects not belonging to
that class and not recognized in that class; False Negatives (FN),

objects belonging to that class and not recognized in that class, the
measures are defined as follows:

 

F measure — 2P ' R 'Accurac — TP + TN (1)
_P+R’ y_TP+TN+FP+FN
where P = $ is the Precision and R = %I is the Recall.

In the following, we provide an execution example of the algo-
rithm. Given a data set composed of 10 features (genes) and 10 sam-
ples — 5 tumoral and 5 normal —, CAMUR extracts through the first
execution of RIPPER a classification model composed of a set of
rules (e.g. gene1 > 0.7 Agenez < 0.4 V gene3 > 0.9 => normal).
The rules contain a set of three features S1 = {gene1, genez, gene3}
which is stored in the features list FL. Starting from S1 the
power set (except the empty set) P1 is computed: P1 = {{gene1},
{genez},{gene3}, {gene1,gene2}, {gene1,gene3}, {gene2,gene3},
{gene1,gene2, gene3}}. The first item of the power set is elimi-
nated from the data set and the classification procedure is per-
formed, which provides a new set of features, e.g.
S2 = {gene3, gene4}. The first power set P1 is completely pro-
cessed, generating a number of feature sets S, which are stored in
FL. After the processing of P1, the power set P2 from S2 is com-
puted and the classification is performed. The algorithm con-
tinues until one of the stopping criteria is verified. To speed up
the procedure, it is worth noting that the next power set is com-
puted and processed only when the current power set has been
completely examined.

The computational time depends on: (i) the size of the power sets,
which are related to the size of the feature sets S,- — if the cardinality of
the feature set is equal to m (m = |S,-|), then the power set generation
requires in the worst-case O(2m); (ii) the worst-case complexity of
RIPPER, i.e. O(nlog2n) with n number of samples in the training set.
Therefore, the total complexity of CAMUR is O(2mnlog2n). We high-
light that usually the number of features present in rule-based classifi-
cation models is limited, especially when dealing with two-class
classification problems, as case—control studies.

Additionally, we investigate the possibility to iterate the feature
elimination in different ways, and hence our algorithm can be exe-
cuted as follows: loose mode, strict mode, double mode.

In the loose feature elimination mode, the algorithm performs
a combined iterative feature elimination. As above-mentioned, this
execution mode takes the model and the results from the first
classification and builds the power set of the found features, whose
combinations are iteratively eliminated from the data set. A classifi-
cation step follows each elimination of the feature combinations.
The new extracted features that are present in the current model are
added to the features list FL and are going to be processed in the
next iterations.

In the strict feature elimination mode, the algorithm performs
a single iterative feature elimination. First, a classification with the
RIPPER algorithm is performed, the features that appear into the
rules are extracted, and then eliminated one by one. The classifica-
tion is iterated after each elimination on the resulting data set. In
contrast to the loose mode, once a feature is eliminated, it is never
inserted again into the data set. Referring to the example given
above, in the strict mode the execution is straightforward.
Starting from the above-mentioned feature set S1, CAMUR proceeds
with the elimination of genel from the original data set ODS and
performs the classification on the new data set, obtaining
S2 = {gene3, gene4}. Then, it eliminates genez from ODS — {genel}
and performs the classification again, obtaining S3. It finishes to pro-
cess S1, and then all the other ones contained in FL if a proper stop-
ping criteria is satisfied.

The strict mode is faster than the loose mode, this can be ex-
plained by the two main differences: (i) the strict mode does not
compute the power set, so there are less classification procedures to
run; (ii) on each classification run one discriminating feature is elimi-
nated from the original data matrix. Therefore, the accuracy of the
models may decrease faster. Conversely, the loose mode extracts
more knowledge but is slower, because the computed power set has a
2’” sets and for each one CAMUR runs the classification algorithm
again.

Finally, it is possible to execute both the strict and the loose
mode through the double mode. This execution mode performs
first the strict and then the loose mode, storing all the models
and results into the CAMUR database.

2.2 The CAMUR software package
The CAMUR software package is composed of two distinct parts:

° Multiple Solutions Extractor (MSE);
° Multiple Solutions Analyzer (MSA).

The MSE corresponds to the implementation of the CAMUR algo-
rithm described in Section 2.1. In brief, it performs the iterative clas-
sification and feature elimination procedures and fills the database
with the results and models.

The MSE is organized in following modules:

° InputManager, which manages the user interactions and the
input;

° CamurLauncher, which executes the iterative CAMUR classiﬁca-
tion algorithm;

° DataElaborator, which is responsible for the data set to clas-
sify and performs feature elimination;

° Feature sManager, which manages the feature lists and power
sets;

° Re sultsElaborator, which processes the classiﬁcation results
and models;

° DataAccessObj ect (DAO) , which has the responsibility to
communicate with the database.

The component diagram of the software is shown in Figure 1.

The workﬂow of the software is as follows: the InputManager
processes the user input data (data matrix) and the parameters (e.g.
maximum number of iterations, execution mode), input data are
taken by the CamurLauncher and managed through the
DataElaborator. Then, CamurLauncher performs the iterative
classification by managing the feature eliminations and combinations
through the FeaturesManager. The ResultsElaborator stores
the classification models and results in the database with the aid of
the DataAccessObj ect (DAO) .

On the other hand, the MSA is a support tool dedicated to the
analysis and interpretation of the obtained results, it extracts know-
ledge from the database by running predefined queries. The follow-
ing queries have been included in the software:

Q1 Genes list: Which are all the genes that are able to distinguish
tumoral samples from normal ones in a given RNA-seq experi-
ment? And how many times do they occur in all the obtained
classiﬁcation models?

In this query, we extract the list of genes and their occurrences
in all the extracted rule-based classiﬁcation models.

Q2 Literals and conjunctions list: Which are the most relevant lit-
erals (e.g. gene1 > 0.7) and conjunctions (e.g. gene1 > 0.7/\
gene2 < 0.4) and their related correctly classiﬁed instances?
Through this query, we identify the conjunctions of one or
more rule literals (e.g. gene1 > 0.7) optionally linked with a
logic A. For each conjunction, we report: (i) the number of cor-
rectly (incorrectly) classiﬁed instances; (ii) the percentage of cor-
rectly (incorrectly) classiﬁed instances.

Q3 Rules list: Which are the classiﬁcation rules and how is their
reliability?

In this query, we extract the rule disjunctions (i.e. conjunc-
tions linked with a logic V), their measures of reliability, i.e.
F — measure, accuracy (refer to Eq. 1 of Section 2.1).

Q4 Literals statistic: Which are the literals (e.g. gene1 > 0.7) that

more frequently occur within a speciﬁc range?
Such a query provides the gene name, the literal operator (e.g.
<, >), its minimum and maximum value, the values average (ﬂ)
and their standard deviation (0), the number of occurrences of
each literal with the same operator, and ﬁnally the coefﬁcient of
variation measure deﬁned as: 

Q5 Gene pairs: Which are all the pairs of genes that appear within a
same rule and how many are their occurrences?

This query extracts all the couples of genes that are present in a
same rule and counts how many times these two genes appear
together.

The MSA is organized in the following modules:

° GraphicUserInterface, which is responsible for user inter-
actions and for showing the results of the queries;

° QueryManager, which executes the query and collects the
results;

° QueryBui lder, which builds a query according to the user input;

° QueryProcessor, which processes the query by retrieving all
the information from the database;

° DataAccessObj ect(DAO), which has the responsibility to
communicate with the database.

The MSA software is released with a graphic interface, which en-
ables to choose a predefined query and to set additional parameters.
It provides the real knowledge in terms of gene lists, gene inter-
actions, expression thresholds, classification results and models. A
screenshot of the graphic interface is depicted in Figure 2. The
CAMUR software package composed of the MSE and the MSA and
described above is implemented in JAVA for linux, windows and
mac-os operating systems under a GPL license and is available at
dmb.iasi.cnr.it/camur.php. A comprehensive user guide is provided
as supplementary data S1.

CAMUR database
CAMUR stores the classification models and the results of the proced-
ure into an ad-hoc storage structure, called CAMUR database. It

permits the execution of the MSA queries for knowledge extraction.
This database has a total of 16 relationships and 13 entities, the
main ones are described below:

° Run, which contains information about the execution of the
MSE;

° Experiment, which represents an execution of the classiﬁcation
procedure and stores its results;

° Rule, which consists of the whole set of disjunctions that predict
a class;

° LiteralSet that is a set of conjunctions;

° Literal that is composed by a feature, an operator (i.e. >, <,
2, S, =, 75) and a value;

° FoundFeaturesSet that represents the set of features ex-
tracted from the rules;

° RemovedFeaturesSet that is the set of features eliminated be-
fore an experiment execution.

CAMUR database is implemented with the open source software
MySql (www.mysql.com).

2.3 Experimental data
In this work, we test our method on RNA-seq experimental data ex-
tracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Weinstein et al.,
2013). Additionally, we validate our method on non-TCGA data.
The Cancer Genome Atlas is a project that aims to offer a com-
prehensive overview of genomic changes involved in human cancer.
A data portal available at www.tcga.org offers access to a large
number of genomic and clinical experiments related to more than
10 000 patients affected by 33 different tumor types. In addition, it
provides a collection of diverse metadata (e.g. clinical health

records) associated to the patients. The TCGA portal contains clin-
ical information, genomic characterization data, and high level se-
quence analysis of the tumor genomes.

We extract RNA-seq experiment data related to Breast (BRCA),
Head and Neck (HNSC) and Stomach (STAD) Cancers. The data
set characteristics are summarized in Table 2. For each data set, we
take into account the Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads
(RPKM) value of each gene expression measure (Mortazavi et al.,
2008), which normalizes the gene raw counts by considering the
length of the gene and the total number of the fragments:

RPKM = - 109 (2)

 

Nr-L

where R is the number of mapped reads onto the gene exons, N, is
the total number of mapped reads, and L is the feature length that
corresponds to the number of nucleotides of the exonic region of the
gene. For each tumor, we build a unique matrix of RPKM values,
where the rows correspond to the samples, the columns to genes,
and the cells to the RPKM values. The matrix given as input to
CAMUR is similar to that one depicted in Table 1 of Section 2. An ad-
hoc software ‘Tcga2Camur’ that converts the TCGA RNA-seq data
sets into the CAMUR data matrix has been developed and is avail-
able at dmb.iasi.cnr.it/camur.php.

It is worth noting that CAMUR can be applied also to gene ex-
pression data processed by other normalization methods, such as
RSEM (RNA-seq by Expectation Maximixation) (Li and Dewey,
2011). RSEM guesses how many ambiguously mapping reads be-
long to a transcript/gene (i.e. raw count value of the TCGA data)
and estimates the frequency of the gene/transcript among the
sequenced transcripts (i.e. scaled estimate value of the TCGA
data). RSEM provides an accurate transcript quantification with-
out requiring a reference genome. In particular, we test CAMUR on
RNA-seq data of BRCA extracted from TCGA and normalized
with the RSEM method.

Moreover, we validate CAMUR on a non-TCGA data set: the
Wilms Tumor (WT) (Walz et al., 2015) among the Kidney Tumors
of the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective
Treatments (TARGET) project.

Finally, we evaluate CAMUR classification models on non-TCGA
BRCA data sets downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) with accession numbers GSE5 6022 and GSM1308330.

The three data sets are extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The
numbers refer to the sequenced tissues, belonging to tumoral and normal
classes (ﬁrst three columns). It is worth noting that for each data set the num-
ber of analyzed samples corresponds to the number of tumoral tissues (third
column). The last two columns refer to the number of genes and the size of
the three data sets.

We analyzed the TCGA data sets of Breast, Head and Neck, and
Stomach Cancers with both the loose and the strict mode of
CAMUR. CAMUR ran a total of 1486 classification procedures with a
percentage split sampling schema (80% training, 20% test) (Tan et
al., 2005b). The classification procedures stopped either for the
decreasing of the classification performances, or because the max-
imum number of iterations was reached. On average, the obtained
precision, recall and F — measure values are greater than 99%.
Within the generated rules CAMUR found 904 different genes, each
gene is found on average 23.34 times (the occurrences of each gene
range from 1 to 900). CAMUR computed 8182 sets of combinations
(736 in strict mode and 7446 in loosemode), each one com-
posed of 1—7 genes (average 2.57). The amount of removed sets is
1480 (364 in strict mode, 1116 in loose mode), which represent
the removed genes from a data set. The number of genes within
these sets is on average 2.025 and the values range from 1 to 6.

The CAMUR analysis (strict and loose mode) on the Breast,
the Head and Neck and the Stomach Cancer data set provides 513,
218 and 272 different genes, respectively. The corresponding gene
expressions allow the scientist to distinguish normal samples from
tumoral ones and they are potential markers for the diseases.

The total amount of gene pairs identified in all rule sets are
20139, 610 and 272, for the Breast, the Head and Neck and the
Stomach Cancer, respectively. Among those genes pairs, 2212 for
Breast, 256 for Head and Neck, 137 for Stomach Cancer have been
found into rule sets containing exactly a pair of genes.

We show the execution times of CAMUR in Table 3. It is worth not-
ing that the processing of the Breast Cancer data set requires longer
time, because of the large number of samples and of the rules size.

In the following, we report the extracted knowledge related to
the Breast cancer by discussing the obtained results of each query
described in Section 2.1. The results related to the other data sets
can be found in supplementary data 52.

With query 1 (features list), we extract 383 genes and their oc-
currences found by CAMUR during the classification experiments. We
show in Table 4 an example of the results of this query.

The extracted genes are sorted by their occurrences, which may
point to a relation with the disease. In Table 5, we provide a list of
the most frequent 12 genes extracted during the execution of
CAMUR.

With query 2 (conjunctions list), we extract 1708 conjunctions
and the values of the correctly (incorrectly) classified samples. For
example, we extracted ‘(SDPR|8436 2 11.6) /\ (ANXA1|301
2 161.3) => Normal’ that classified correctly all the 87 instances of
the test set. Query 3 (disjunctions list) extracts 1564 classification
rules, e.g. ‘(SPRY2|10253214.4) /\ (C200rf160l14070621.8) V
(COL10A1l13OOSO.7) /\ (AASSl10157Z 1.6) => Normal’, which
provides an accuracy of 100%. Through query 4 (literal statistics),
we extract 397 most frequent genes and we may capture if they
show comparable expression values. An interesting example for the
output interpretation of query 3 in Breast Cancer is: gene
TMEM220|388335 occurs 33 times, and its attribute value is
22.6 i 0.007, and hence provides a strong and stable signal. Query 5
(pairs of features) displays 2212 pairs of genes and a counter of how
many times they appear together. The pairs that appear mostly are
depicted in Table 6. Additionally, it is worth noting that the user
can define personalized queries and run them directly on the
database.

Furthermore, among the gene lists extracted by CAMUR, we
found 3 genes (i.e. ACOT7|11332, ADAR|103 and
GLT25D1|79709) shared by Breast, Head and Neck and Stomach
Cancer set: in panel a of Figure 3 we show all the overlaps among
the three sets of genes through an Eulero-Venn diagram. A prelim-
inary functional analysis on the human protein atlas (Uhlén et al.,
2015) confirms the relation of those genes with the three above-
mentioned cancer types.

In order to strengthen CAMUR, we performed the following tests.
Since we have not found other state of the art classification algo-
rithms that implement multiple models extraction, a direct compari-
son of our method is not feasible. Therefore, we compared CAMUR
with respect to a standard wide-spread technique that relies on the
differential expression analysis (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003)

and that provides a list of statistically significant genes related to
case—control samples, by applying Benjamini-Hochberg correction
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 ) to estimate a False Discovery Rate
(FDR)-adjusted p-value. We extracted a list of 1851, 787, 1296
genes with a P-value $0.001 for BRCA, HNSC and STAD, respect-
ively. The above-mentioned lists were compared with those ex-
tracted by CAMUR. We found 36 for BRCA, 11 for HNSC, 99 for
STAD genes that are shared in both lists (panel b of Fig. 3). The lists
of shared genes are available as supplementary data S3. It is worth
noting that the size of the lists extracted by CAMUR is smaller, and
hence our approach allows to focus on few core genes related to the
investigated disease. Additionally, most of those genes are not se-
lected by the differential expression analysis enhancing the novelty
of our approach.

Additionally, we ran several tests to validate CAMUR, its classifi-
cation models, and its performances. The detailed results are avail-
able as supplementary data S4. First, we randomly selected ten
BRCA rules extracted by CAMUR and verified them on two external
breast cancer RNA-seq data sets of GEO (GSE56022 and
GSM1308330). Most of the rules succeed in the identification of
the diseased samples confirming the validity of our method: 9 out
of 10 correctly cover the GSM1308330 samples, 7 out of 10 the
GSE56022 ones (but we remark that 2 of the not successful rules
cannot be applied because a gene is not present in the data set).
Second, we tested CAMUR on a non-TCGA data set: the Wilms
Tumor (WT) (Walz et al., 2015) of the (TARGET) project. It con-
sists of 94 tissues (82 tumoral, 12 normal) and 58450 mRNA gene
expression values normalized with the RPKM method. CAMUR per-
formed 320 runs (212 loose and 108 in strict mode) finding
231 different genes with an average F-measure of 0.98. Third, we
validated CAMUR on RNA-seq data of BRCA normalized with the
RSEM method. CAMUR executed 2048 classification experiments
(1895 loose and 153 in strict mode) and extracted 986 differ-
ent genes with an average F-measure of 0.99. Finally, we per-
formed a comparative analysis of CAMUR with respect to the SVM
classifier by computing the same number of classification runs:
both methods reached high reliable results (average F-measure of
0.97 for SVM, 0.99 for CAMUR) on all data sets. We remark that
SVM outputs just a single classification model that cannot be easily
interpreted by human experts.

4 Conclusion

In this work, we presented CAMUR, a new method for multiple solu-
tions extraction in rule-based classification problems. We showed
that the amount of knowledge extracted by our algorithm is higher
than a standard supervised classification. We described the two
parts of CAMUR software package: MSE that performs the classifi-
cation procedure and MSA that analyzes the obtained results.
Additionally, we designed and developed a database for an effect-
ive and comprehensive knowledge extraction. We proved the effi-
cacy of our algorithm on large sets of RNA-seq data, focusing on
Breast, Head and Neck and Stomach Cancer from TCGA, and vali-
dating it on external data sets from TARGET and GEO. To con-
clude, CAMUR results as a reliable technique for solving
classification problems by extracting many alternative and equally
accurate solutions.

In future, we intend to test our method on other RNA-seq data
sets in order to build a large knowledge repository of classification
models related to a particular disease. The extracted genes may then
be analyzed by domain experts with functional and enrichment ana-
lyses (D’Andrea et al., 2013). It would be also interesting to perform

a simulation study for evaluating the performance of CAMUR under
different scenarios in a quantitative manner. Additionally, we plan
to integrate in our software other rule-based classifiers, as well as to
enrich the software with new functions and higher performances.
Finally, we plan to extend the analysis to other biological data sets
as sequences classification, e.g. DNA-Barcoding.

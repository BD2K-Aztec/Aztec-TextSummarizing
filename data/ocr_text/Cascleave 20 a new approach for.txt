ABSTRACT

Motivation: Caspases and granzyme B (GrB) are important proteases
involved in fundamental cellular processes and play essential roles in
programmed cell death, necrosis and inflammation. Although a number
of substrates for both types have been experimentally identified, the
complete repertoire of caspases and granzyme B substrates remained
to be fully characterized. Accordingly, systematic bioinformatics studies
of known cleavage sites may provide important insights into their sub-
strate specificity and facilitate the discovery of novel substrates.
Results: We develop a new bioinformatics tool, termed Cascleave
2.0, which builds on previous success of the Cascleave tool for pre-
dicting generic caspase cleavage sites. It can be efficiently used to
predict potential caspase-specific cleavage sites for the human cas-
pase-1, 3, 6, 7, 8 and GrB. In particular, we integrate heterogeneous
sequence and protein functional information from various sources to
improve the prediction accuracy of Cascleave 2.0. During classifica-
tion, we use both maximum relevance minimum redundancy and for-
ward feature selection techniques to quantify the relative contribution
of each feature to prediction and thus remove redundant as well as
irrelevant features. A systematic evaluation of Cascleave 2.0 using the
benchmark data and comparison with other state-of-the-art tools
using independent test data indicate that Cascleave 2.0 outperforms
other tools on protease-specific cleavage site prediction of caspase-1,
3, 6, 7 and GrB. Cascleave 2.0 is anticipated to be used as a powerful
tool for identifying novel substrates and cleavage sites of caspases
and GrB and help understand the functional roles of these important
proteases in human proteolytic cascades.

1 INTRODUCTION

Proteases are proteolytic enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of
protein or peptide substrates by hydrolysis of peptide bonds.
They represent ~2% (at least 500—600 proteases) of all gene
products in human and are involved in the functional regulation
of a large number of important physiological processes such as
cell cycle, cell proliferation, programmed cell death, DNA repli-
cation, tissue remodeling and immune response (Rawlings et al.,
2008; Turk, 2006). Most proteases carry out either highly or
moderately selective cleavage of the scissile bonds within the
cleavage site of their substrates, with the substrate speciﬁcity
ranging from preferences for a number of speciﬁc amino acids
at deﬁned positions to more generic sites with limited or no dis-
crimination at one position (Chen et al., 2008; Song et al., 2011,
2012).

We are particularly interested in bioinformatic studies of the
substrate speciﬁcity of human caspases and the proapoptotic
protease granzyme B (GrB), a family of cysteine and serine pro-
teases that are key regulators of apoptosis initiation and execu-
tion (DiX et al., 2008). Both types are involved in a number of
fundamental cellular processes and play a key role in apoptotic
cell death. They also are involved in other cellular processes,
including cell cycle, cell proliferation, development, cell migra-
tion and receptor internalization (DiX et al., 2008; Los et al.,
2001). Caspases are known to have restricted substrate speciﬁcity
for an aspartic acid residue (D) at position P1 of the target sub-
strate. This primary speciﬁcity is similar with that of the serine
protease GrB, which is delivered by natural killer cells into virally
infected and tumor cells (Pardo et al., 2009; Russell and Ley,
2002).

To date, at least 15 mammalian caspases have been identiﬁed
(Chowdhury et al., 2008) and they can be categorized into three
groups based on their substrate speciﬁcities: group I caspases
(caspase-1, 4, 5 and 13) prefer bulky hydrophobic amino acids
at the P4 site and cleave the peptide sequence (W/L)EHD, group
II caspases (capspase—2, 3 and 7) preferentially cleave the se-
quence motif DEXD, whereas group III (caspase-6, 8, 9 and
10) cleaves the motif (I/V/L)E(H/T)D. In contrast to the cas-
pases, GrB prefers to cleave the sequence motif IEXD.

Identiﬁcation of native substrates of caspases and GrB is the
key to understanding of their physiological roles that have been
implicated in the pathological processes including cancer, neuro-
degenerative and immunological diseases, contributing to our
improved knowledge of proteolytic cascades lead to apoptotic
cell death and which potential substrates can serve as potent
therapeutic targets. Although the application of advanced
large-scale high-throughput proteomic techniques has signiﬁ-
cantly increased the number of experimentally veriﬁed caspase
and GrB substrates (Bredemeyer et al., 2005; Turk et al., 2001),
the complete repertoire of the native substrates remains to be
discovered, and furthermore, many other cleavage sites within
the known substrates are not fully experimentally identiﬁed
(Fischer et al., 2003). Moreover, experimental identiﬁcation
and characterization of protease substrates are often time-con-
suming, expensive and difﬁcult (Enoksson and Salvesen, 2008;
Enoksson et al., 2007; Schilling and Overall, 2008). Therefore,
bioinformatic prediction of caspase and GrB substrates may pro-
vide valuable and experimentally testable information regarding
novel potential cleavage sites or putative substrates.

A number of bioinformatic approaches have been developed
to address the difﬁcult task of predicting caspase and GrB cleav-
age sites [see (duVerle and Mamitsuka, 2012; Song et al., 2011)
for a review]. For example, PeptideCutter used a limited experi-
mental dataset to predict the substrate cleavage sites for a variety
of proteases including several caspases (Backes et al., 2005;
Gasteiger et al., 2005) developed GraBCas to provide position-
speciﬁc scoring prediction of the potential cleavage sites of cas-
pases 1—9 and GrB. Garay-Malpartida et a]. built CasPredictor
to predict caspase cleavage sites by using position-dependent
amino acid matrices together with a PEST-like sequence index
(Garay-Malpartida et al., 2005). Wee et a]. developed CASVM
based on support vector machine (SVM) to achieve a prediction
accuracy ranging from 81.2 to 97.9% (Wee et al., 2007). POPS is
a systematic computational tool that supports the creation of
speciﬁcity models of any protease given the knowledge of its
substrate speciﬁcity data (Boyd et al., 2005). Verspurten et a].
developed a scoring tool SitePrediction, which incorporated
predicted secondary structure, solvent accessibility and PEST
sequence occurrence (Verspurten et al., 2009). Song et a]. pro-
posed the ﬁrst version of Cascleave predictor based on amino
acid sequence, predicted secondary structure, solvent accessibility
and natively disordered regions as the input features to the sup-
port vector regression (SVR) models (Song et al., 2010). Piippo
et a]. built Pripper using four different classiﬁers including SVM,
J48, Random Forest and Vote (Piippo et al., 2010). CAT3 is a
tool based on scoring matrices, however, it can predict substrate
cleavage sites of caspase-3 only, which has limited its practical
application (Ayyash et al., 2012). Barkan et a]. developed an
SVM-based approach, termed PCSS, which used characteristic
sequence and structure features important for substrate recogni-
tion to predict novel substrates of caspases and GrB (Barkan
et al., 2010). These tools can be generally divided into two cate-
gories: scoring function— or machine learning-based.
PeptideCutter, PoPS and SitePrediction belong to the ﬁrst cat-
egory, whereas Cascleave 1.0, PCSS, CASVM and Pripper
belong to the second category. In terms of machine learning al-
gorithms used for model training, Cascleave 1.0, PCSS, CASVM

and Pripper are developed using SVM, whereas Pripper com-
bines random forest, J48 and vote predictions.

In this study, we present a novel approach termed Cascleave
2.0 to predict caspase— and GrB-speciﬁc cleavage sites by inte-
grating heterogeneous information from various sources. We
ﬁrst constructed non-redundant substrate datasets from
MEROPS (Rawlings et al., 2008) and then selected useful se-
quence and protein functional features as the input our SVR
models. To this end, we performed extensive feature selection
by using a two-stage feature selection procedure to comprehen-
sively investigate and characterize features arising from different
levels that are important for determining protease-speciﬁc sub-
strate. Independent tests indicate that Cascleave 2.0 outperforms
other existing methods and can be used as a powerful tool for
high-throughput in silico screening of novel putative substrates of
human caspase-1, 3, 6, 7, 8 and GrB and their respective cleavage
sites.

2 METHODS

2.1 Benchmark and independent test datasets

We curated substrate datasets for human caspase-l, 3, 6, 7, 8 and GrB
from the MEROPS database (version 9.6) (Rawlings et al., 2008). All the
annotated substrate cleavage sites in the datasets were experimentally
determined. The number of experimentally veriﬁed substrates and cleav-
age sites for different enzymes, after removing redundancies, is shown in
Supplementary Table S1. Moreover, a background dataset containing all
human proteins was retrieved from UniProt (version released in August
2012) (Bairoch et al., 2005). Given a protease, its positive (cleavage site
peptide) and negative (non-cleavage site peptide) samples were generated
and used as training/testing data. In particular, it would be difﬁcult to
prove deﬁnitely that a particular peptide bond is not cleaved under any
conditions. Accordingly, it is hard to collect a set of protein sequences
that can be safely regarded as non-cleavable. In this work, the negative
samples were selected from the background protein sets that excluded the
experimentally veriﬁed substrates. A sliding window approach commonly
used to extract sequence features was adopted here for both positive and
negative samples. For positive samples, the ﬂanking sequences around
each cleavage site were considered (Song et al., 2010, 2012; Zhao et al.,
2005). For negative samples, the same number of sites not known as
cleavage sites was randomly selected from the background proteins
(Zhao et al., 2008). The schematic ﬂowchart of Cascleave 2.0 can be
found in Figure 1.

Sequence identity for the initial datasets was reduced using CD-HIT
(Huang et al., 2010) in such a way that the sequence identity between any
two protein sequences should be no larger than 30%. This step is essential
for eliminating sequence redundancy and avoiding overestimation of the
performance of machine learning predictors. To objectively evaluate the
performance, the ﬁnal substrate datasets after removing redundancies
were randomly divided into two subsets: a benchmark dataset and an
independent dataset (~20% of the size of the benchmark dataset). The
performance of the models was comprehensively evaluated using 5-fold
cross-validation on the benchmark dataset and further validated on the
independent test set. In 5-fold cross-validation, the substrate sequences
were randomly divided into ﬁve subsets of roughly equal size, four of
which were used as the training set, whereas the rest one was left as the
test set. This procedure was repeated ﬁve times such that each subset was
used as the test set once. Using the independent dataset, we performed the
independent test by training the model based on the benchmark dataset
so that the performance of the model can be objectively evaluated.

2.2 Feature extraction

To improve prediction accuracy, we considered both sequence and func-
tional features to identify potential cleavage sites for each protease. These
features include (i) secondary structures predicted by SABLE (Wagner
et al., 2005); (ii) solvent accessibility predicted by SABLE (Wagner et al.,
2005); (iii) disordered region predicted by DISOPRED2 (Ward et al.,
2004); (iv) amino acid index (AAindex) representing various physico-
chemical and biochemical properties of amino acids (Kawashima et al.,
1999); (v) position-speciﬁc scoring matrix generated by PSI-BLAST
(Altschul et al., 1997); (vi) isoelectric point (pI) calculated by BioPerl
(Stajich et al., 2002); (vi) residue conservation score; (vii) amino acid
mass weight; (ix) biological process (BP) feature from Gene Ontology
(Ashburner et al., 2000); (x) cellular component (CC) feature from
Gene Ontology; (xi) molecular function (MF) feature from Gene
Ontology; (xii) functional domain information from InterPro (Hunter
61 al., 2012); (xiii) pathway information from KEGG (Kanehisa and
Goto, 2000); (xiv) functional domains from Pfam (Punta et al., 2012);
and (xv) protein—protein interaction (PPI) from STRING (Jensen et al.,
2009). Details of how to extract the features are provided in the
Supplementary File (Supplementary Table S2).

2.3 Over- and underrepresented feature analysis

For each protein substrate, the set of various heterogeneous features
generated above are highly dimensional, heterogeneous, noisy and redun-
dant. This will lead to a time-consuming practice to train classiﬁers using
these noisy features, thereby resulting in possible biased model training
and prediction (Zhao et al., 2010). To address this, a two-sided hypergeo-
metric test was used to identify over- or underrepresented terms for the
protein substrates of each protease as opposed to the background protein
set. Given a certain feature, the hypergeometric test was performed using
the R Stats package (Team, 2011):

p = thpergeom(qs m: n:  

where q is the number of samples annotated with the feature term in the
‘set’ of interest (here, we refer to the benchmark dataset excluding the
independent test dataset), m is the number of samples annotated with
the feature in the background set, 11 is the number of samples without the
feature, whereas k is the number of samples in the set of interest. P—values

derived from hypergeometric test were corrected by Bonferroni correction
for testing on multiple terms. Features with P<0.01 were taken as sig-
niﬁcant. We then scored potential substrate proteins based on the
overrepresented features, as described in previous work (Li et al., 2010).

2.4 SVR implementation

We used SVR to build the models to estimate the cleavage probability of
substrates for each protease (Song et al., 2007). SVR is the regression
mode of SVM (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995), which is a supervised machine
learning approach (Burges, 1998). Therefore, SVR allows us to build
models that provide quantitative evaluation of the cleavage probability.
We used the LIBSVM package (Chang and Lin, 2011) for SVR imple-
mentation, where the radial basis kernel function with default parameters
was selected. The radial basis kernel function function is deﬁned as
follows:

N
3’06) = Z Wi¢(x — Xi) (2)
i=1

where the approximating function y(x) is represented as a sum of N
radial basis functions [¢(x — xi) means the distance from x to x,], each
associated with a center x,- and weighted by an appropriate coefﬁcient wi.
All the input feature values were normalized as follows:
1

X norm 2 H7 
where x is the real value of each feature, and Xnorm is the value after
normalization.

2.5 Two-step feature selection

Because it is likely that many of the derived features contain redundant
information, we performed feature selection to ﬁlter those features that
do not contribute to the predictive performance. In this work, a two-step
feature selection approach, composed of the maximum relevance min-
imum redundancy (mRMR) (Peng et al., 2005) and forward feature se-
lection (FFS) (Wang et al., 2012) was used to select the most informative
features for predicting substrate cleavage sites.

The ﬁrst step is to evaluate the relative importance of each feature
using mRMR that is able to rank the features according to both their
relevance to the response variables and the redundancy between the fea-
tures themselves. Features assigned with higher rankings are thought to
have better trade-off between the maximum relevance and minimum re-
dundancy. We selected the top 100 features as our optimal feature can-
didates (OFCs).

The second step involves use of the FFS method to select a condensed
subset of optimal features from the above 100 OFCs. FFS is a feature
selection method that examines each feature from the candidate feature
set sequentially and results in a feature set that achieves the highest ac-
curacy (using AUC as described later in the text). Brieﬂy, FFS starts
with the feature that is ranked as the best feature with mRMR, and
then more features are added to the preselected feature set that can
lead to higher prediction accuracy. This procedure continues until no
more features can be added to the selected feature set to improve predic-
tion accuracy. The resulted feature set will be used as the ﬁnal feature set
for further analysis.

2.6 Performance evaluation

The prediction performance was evaluated using the following measures:

(1) Sensitivity (SEN) or true-positive rate (percentage of correctly pre-
dicted cleavage sites):

Sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN) (4)

(2) Speciﬁcity (SPE, percentage of correctly predicted non-cleavage
sites):

Specificity = TN/(TN+ FF) (5)

(3) False-positive rate (percentage of not correctly predicted non-
cleavage sites):

FPR = 1 — Specificity = FP/(TN+ FF) (6)

(4) Precision (PRE) is deﬁned as:
Precision = T P/ (T P + FF) (7)

(5) Accuracy (ACC, percentage of correct predictions of both cleavage
and non-cleavage sites):
T P + TN

A = —
“WW TP + TN + FP + FN

(8)

(6) Mathew’s correlation coefﬁcient (MCC), a measure of the quality
of binary classiﬁcations (Matthews, 1975), is deﬁned as:
T P T — FP F
M C C = x N X N
X/(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)

 

 

(9)

where T P, TN, FF and FN denote the number of true positives, true
negatives, false positives and false negatives, respectively.

In addition, we also used the AUC measure, the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (ROC), to evaluate the performance of
classiﬁers. Moreover, the performance was comprehensively evaluated
using the six measures based on 5-fold cross-validation and independent
tests.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Analysis of sequence-level determinants of the pro-
tease substrate speciﬁcity

Supplementary Table S1 lists the number of cleavage sites and
sequences clustered at the two sequence identity levels. Because
we are more interested in analyzing the substrate speciﬁcity of
human proteases, only human substrates were retained in our
ﬁnal datasets. We then calculated the frequencies of amino
acid residue types appearing at each position of Pl6-Pl6’
(upstream and downstream 16 sites) sites surrounding the cleav-
age sites.

Using the human proteome as the reference set, sequence logo
representations (Supplementary Fig. S1) were generated by using
IceLogo (Colaert et al., 2009), allowing us to identify conserved
sequence motifs or distinct patterns that differentiate between
different proteases, as shown in Supplementary Figure S1. It
can be seen that a primary feature of the substrate speciﬁcity
of caspases is the requirement of Asp at P1 position, whereas a
lesser selectivity of Asp residue was also observed on the P4
position, constituting the canonical DXXD motif (Nicholson,
1999). GrB is known to have similar substrate speciﬁcity as the
caspases, e.g. it primarily cleaves after Asp at P1 position.
Nonetheless, we noted that there exist subtle, yet important dif-
ferences between the substrate speciﬁcities of different proteases.
For example, caspase-3 and 7 strongly disfavor Leu at P4 pos-
ition, whereas other proteases do not. On the other hand, cas-
pase-6 and GrB prefer to have ‘V’ at P4 position, which is not the
case for other proteases. In addition, more subtle differences
between different proteases were also observed at the prime-

side positions, especially P1’ and P2’ positions. For example,
caspase-1, 3, 7 and 8 prefer to have ‘G/S’ at P1’ position, whereas
caspase-6 and GrB favor ‘D/E’ and ‘S/T’, respectively.
Moreover, caspase-1 and 8 prefer to have ‘P’ at P2’ position,
whereas others do not have such preference. All together, these
results highlight the need and importance to address this problem
by developing protease-speciﬁc predictors that might allow more
precise recognition of its substrate cleavage sites.

3.2 Characterization of functional features

In this section, we investigated functional features that are sig-
niﬁcantly enriched for substrate cleavage. First, we identiﬁed
overrepresented functional features by performing two-sided
hypergeometric tests based on the benchmark dataset. The sig-
niﬁcantly enriched KEGG, GO and STRING features for each
protease are shown in Supplementary Tables S3—S9 (only top ten
features are listed). Taking caspase-3 as an example, in terms of
the PPI features, there are 836 enriched protein interaction part-
ners of caspase-3. In terms of the KEGG pathway features,
caspase-3 substrates are enriched in signaling pathway terms,
such as ‘Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway’, ‘ErbB signaling path-
way’, ‘toll-like receptor signaling pathway’, ‘transcriptional
misregulation in cancer’ and ‘GnRH signaling pathway’. In add-
ition, caspase-3 substrates are also found to be enriched in cer-
tain cancer-related pathways, including ‘Small cell lung cancer’,
‘Transcriptional misregulation in cancer’, ‘Endometrial cancer’
and ‘Prostate cancer’ (Supplementary Table S4). These results
suggest that cleavage of caspase-3 substrates is implicated in cel-
lular processes related to signaling or cancer pathways.

In terms of BP terms, again, we found that caspase substrates
are enriched in ‘platelet activation’, ‘cell proliferation’, ‘mRNA
splicing’, ‘phosphorylation’ and ‘signaling pathways’ (Supple-
mentary Table S4). In terms of MF, caspase-3 substrates
are enriched in functions related to binding, such as ‘protein
C-terminus binding’, ‘p53 binding’, ‘enzyme binding’ and ‘pro-
tein phosphatase binding’. It is also noteworthy that some en-
riched terms are related to protein post-translational
modiﬁcations, such as ‘protein autophosphorylation’, ‘protein
phosphatase binding’ and ‘ubiquitin—protein ligase activity’.
This ﬁnding recapitulates our refreshed knowledge about the
presence and extent of functional cross-talks between caspase
cleavage, phosphorylation and other types of post-translational
modiﬁcations (Dix et al., 2012; Kurokawa and Kornbluth,
2009). On the other hand, although there are certain functional
terms shared in common by different proteases, such as ‘Alzhei-
mer’s disease’, most of the enriched terms are different and indi-
cate protease-speciﬁc preferences of the target substrates. These
results again highlight the needs to develop speciﬁc models for
each protease to better understand their substrate speciﬁcity and
facilitate the discovery of their native substrates.

Next, we wanted to ﬁnd out whether substrate proteins can be
discriminated from the background protein set by considering
the cohort of the signiﬁcantly enriched functional features.
Using a simple log-odd approach (Li et al., 2010), we calculated
the function scores for each protein (See the Supplementary File
for its deﬁnition). The distributions of the functional scores are
shown in Figure 2. The majority of the proteins in the back-
ground set have scores <0, which is in sharp contrast to those

can be discriminated from the background protein set and our
selected characteristic functional features might be informative
for improving the substrate prediction (results discussed in
Section 3.3).

3.3 Performance improvement based on a two-step feature
selection using mRMR and FFS

Owing to the heterogeneous nature of the complex features ex-
tracted from various sources in this study, we are motivated to
apply feature selection techniques (Saeys et al., 2007; Wang et al.,
2012), to select more relevant features that are critical for cleav-
age site prediction. As identifying the most informative features
is necessary for minimizing the classiﬁcation error (Peng et al.,
2005) and shedding light on the important determinants of the
protease substrate speciﬁcity, we used both mRMR and FFS
methods to select the most informative feature subset in a two-
step fashion. In the ﬁrst step, we used mRMR to rank all the
initial features and generate the top 100 features list, respectively,
for the six proteases. The mRMR can output two different
feature lists: the MaxRel list that provides the rank of features
according to their relevance to the target and the mRMR list that
provides the ﬁnal mRMR rank after considering both max-
relevance and min-redundancy. We used the mRMR list as the
ﬁnal selected features.

After the ﬁrst step feature selection using mRMR, we selected
the top 100 features for each protease, and then compared the
performance of the three types of models based on three different
groups of features when using the AUC scores as the metric for
predictive power, as shown in Figure 3. The ﬁnal optimal fea-
tures set is provided in Supplementary Table S11. This ﬁgure

Fig. 3. Predictive performance of models for six proteases using the total
features, the top 100 OFCs and the ﬁnal optimal features, respectively, as
evaluated by the AUC scores

indicates expected results, i.e. that by training models using the
selected top 100 OFCs, we can achieve a signiﬁcantly better per-
formance. Taking caspase-1 as an example, we observe a 17%
improvement of the overall AUC score obtained by the model
based on the top 100 features (AUC=0.645), when compared
with the AUC score obtained by the model based on all the total
features (AUC=0.552). We observe a performance improve-
ment across all the six proteases under investigation, ranging
from 17 to 78%. These ﬁndings suggest that the mRMR feature
selection can substantially improve the prediction performance
with the selection of a compact subset of more informative and
relevant features.

Next, we wanted to ascertain if it is possible to further select a
subset of optimal features that could lead to the overall best
performance. To answer this question, we focused on the selected
100 top OFCs and performed a second-step feature selection by
iteratively adding/removing each of the features and examining
the subsequent performance change. The performance changes
during the course of feature selection were reﬂected by the FFS
curves in Supplementary Figure S2, from which we could identify
the corresponding subset of optimal features for each protease
that achieved the best AUC score (i.e. the highest peaks in
Supplementary Fig. S2). It can be seen from Figure 3 that the
performance was consistently improved after the second-step fea-
ture selection. Compared to the models based on the top 100
features, the models based on the ﬁnal optimal have further im-
proved the predictions, with an improvement between 2 and
48%, depending on the protease type. In summary, these results
suggest that this two-step feature selection is critical for improv-
ing the performance of the models. To our knowledge, this study
represent the ﬁrst systematic effort to scrutinize and select more
relevant features that make a signiﬁcant contribution to the pre-
diction of caspase and GrB cleavage sites based on feature selec-
tion, in contrast to previous studies few of which have used
feature selection methods to address this important task.

Supplementary Table S10 shows the number of the ﬁnal se-
lected features for the six proteases and their categorization. It
can be seen that the total numbers of ﬁnal features for each
protease vary, ranging from 6 to 73. In addition, the number
of ﬁnal features is not correlated with the model’s performance,

i.e. a model with less number of ﬁnal features may achieve a
better performance, such as caspase-1, 7 and 6 (all with 315
ﬁnal features), whereas the reverse is also true, namely, a
model may require more ﬁnal features to achieve a better per-
formance, such as caspase-3 and GrB (both with >50 ﬁnal fea-
tures). On the other hand, we also observe some common
features included in all the ﬁnal feature sets across the six pro-
teases, such as the STRING, GO and KEGG functional fea-
tures. Inclusion of these common functional features may
indicate the commonality of the substrate functions of these pro-
teases. Models of caspase-3 and granzyme B also include Pfam
and Interpro functional features, suggesting that that they are
important for cleavage site prediction of these two enzymes.

We evaluated the relative importance of each class of func-
tional features to the predictive power of the models, based on
the mRMR scores, as shown in Supplementary Table S11. The
analysis shows that functional features are highly abundant, ac-
counting for almost 50% of the ﬁnal selected features, and are
generally assigned with higher rankings. For example, STRING
and GO CC features are ranked as the top ﬁve features for most
proteases. To further quantitatively evaluate their contribution
to the performance, we measured the performance loss using the
AUC score by removing a feature group from the model
(Supplementary Table S12). The results show that STRING
functional features are the most important feature group for all
the six proteases except caspase-1 because removal of this group
resulted in the largest performance loss.

Finally, using the mRMR scores, we characterized the relative
importance of each individual optimal feature. Taking caspase-6
as an example, the most important feature type is the STRING
feature, followed by GO CC, AA_index_subst.V1872 and GO
BP (see the Supplementary File for explanation of the features)
(Supplementary Fig. S3). More than half of the features (7 out of
13) belong to functional features, indicating that they can inter-
act cooperatively with other complementary features to achieve a
better performance. A complete list of the ﬁnal selected features
for all the six proteases and the respective mRMR scores is
provided in Supplementary Table S11.

3.4 Prediction performance of Cascleave 2.0 based on the
benchmark datasets

In this section, we assessed the prediction performance of the
SVR models of Cascleave 2.0 using the ﬁnal optimal features
by the 5-fold cross-validation tests based on the benchmark data-
sets. The performance was assessed using six different measures,
including MCC, ACC, SEN, SPE, PRE and AUC. The results
are shown in Table 1. One can see that the models of all the six
proteases achieved relatively high performance, with MCC and
AUC ranging from 0.744 to 0.978 and 0.922 to 0.997, respect-
ively. In contrast, the performance of Granzyme B is the worst
predicted with an MCC of only 0.744, whereas the performance
of caspase-8 is the best with MCC and AUC scores close to 1.
Our work distinguished itself from previous studies in that
previous studies mostly used sequence or sequence-derived struc-
tural features to build the models, failing to consider and include
informative functional features. As previously discussed, in this
study, we found that there were a number of functional features
that signiﬁcantly contribute to the substrate cleavage site

prediction, such as GO BP, MF, CC, KEGG and PPI features
(Supplementary Table S11). These ﬁndings actually make sense,
because protease and its substrates have to be co-localized in the
same cellular compartments or function in the related pathways
or interaction networks to satisfy its physiological role to cleave
target substrates in viv0(Gromiha et al., 2010). As a result, global
functional features help predict potential target substrates.

On the other hand, sequence features also prove useful for
predicting substrate cleavage sites. The selected optimal sequence
features include AA index, amino acid properties, predicted sec-
ondary structure, predicted disorder region, pI, etc (Supplemen-
tary Table S11). Because these sequence features has been well
established in previous studies (Ayyash et al., 2012; Barkan et al.,
2010; Garay-Malpartida et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2006; Li
et al., 2012; Mizianty et al., 2010; Song et al., 2010; Verspurten
et al., 2009), we did not focus on the analysis of these features in
this section. One important issue is that with the application of
powerful feature selection techniques, like the ones used in this
study, enables us to quantify the relative importance and contri-
bution of each of the selected feature types to substrate cleavage
site prediction, providing important insights into various deter-
minants of the substrate speciﬁcities of the proteases arising from
different levels.

We further investigated the contribution of the selected func-
tional features to the classiﬁers’ performance by comparing the
AUC measures between models trained with and without func-
tional features (Fig. 4). The results indicate that the selected
functional features are critical for the performance improvement,
especially for caspase-1, 6 and 7, for which the AUC scores
increased from 0.575 to 0.958, 0.602 to 0.969 and 0.737 to
0.976, respectively. Taken together, these results again highlight
the complementarity and importance of the selected functional
features to the predictive power of the SVR models.

3.5 Comparison with other existing tools based on the
independent test datasets

In this section, we compared the performance of Cascleave 2.0
with other state-of—the-art tools including PoPS (Boyd et al.,
2005), SitePrediction (Verspurten et al., 2009), PCSS (Barkan
et al., 2010), Pripper (Piippo et al., 2010), PeptideCutter
(\Nilkins et al., 1999), CASVM (\Nee et al., 2007), Cascleave
1.0 (Song et al., 2010) and CAT3 (Ayyash et al., 2012), based
on the independent test datasets. In addition, we also compared
with BLAST prediction, which is one of the most readily

Fig. 4. Performance comparison using the AUC scores between models
that incorporated selected functional features and that did not

available sequence analysis tools using sequence similarity.
Although CaSPredictor and GraBCas are previously developed
as useful tools, they are currently unavailable. Therefore, we did
not include them in the comparison. It should be noted that
while Cascleave 2.0 is able to predict protease-speciﬁc substrate
cleavage sites for all the six proteases under investigation, some
tools could only be used to predict cleavage sites for one or more,
but not for all the proteases. For example, CAT3 can be applied
to predict cleavage sites of caspase-3 only. Therefore, we com-
pared with the tools that could provide valid predictions for a
protease of interest. In Figure 5, some ROC curves are not
smooth because the sizes of corresponding independent datasets
are small.

For most of the proteases, we found that SVM was better than
RF, J 48 and Vote for Pripper except caspase-3. The performance
of CASVM showed that the local window size of P16-P10’ better
than P4—P2’ and P4—Pl, except for caspase-6. The performance
comparison was made using the ROC curves (Fig. 5) and meas-
ures such as MCC and ACC (Supplementary Tables S13 and
S14). These results clearly show that Cascleave 2.0 outperformed
other tools for ﬁve proteases, i.e. caspase-1, 3, 6, 7 and granzyme
B, but slightly worse than SitePrediction in the case of caspase-8,
for which Cascleave 2.0 achieved an AUC of 0.938, slightly lower
than that of SitePrediction (AUC = 0.979). To examine the stat-
istical signiﬁcance, we further performed pairwise t—test and
showed that the performance differences between Cascleave 2
and other methods were, in most cases, statistically signiﬁcant
(Supplementary Table S16). The performance improvement of
Cascleave 2.0 compared with other tools might be attributed to
the incorporation of informative functional features and the
deployment of an efﬁcient two-step feature selection in an
integrated framework.

SitePrediction is an empirical scoring tool for protease cleav-
age site prediction (Verspurten et al., 2009) by combining amino
acid frequency score with amino acid substitution matrix. It is
especially effective for predicting potential cleavage sites that are
similar to known cleavage sites. Our studies conﬁrm the predict-
ive power of SitePrediction. Similarly, PoPS, CAT3 and
PeptideCutter are also frequency-based scoring tools and

performed worse than SitePrediction. On the other hand, ma-
chine learning—based tools such as PCSS, CASVM and Cascleave
1.0, also achieved varying prediction performance, depending on
the protease type. PCSS is an SVM-based tool that is developed
using sequence and structural features important for recognition
of substrate peptides. It also achieved a prediction performance
comparable or better than other tools, particularly for caspase-3,
7, 8 and granzyme B. Finally, we would like to point out that it is
practically difﬁcult to perform an unbiased comparison, as we
are faced with a situation where the knowledge of the training
substrate data used by other tools is not available and re—training
of the models of other tools based on the same independent
datasets is often not possible.

In addition, we observed the prediction performance of
granzyme B substrate cleavage sites is relatively worse, across
all the compared tools, as opposed to the caspases. The under-
lying reason behind this result is unclear. One possibility is that
extended substrate speciﬁcity (including for example the contri-
bution of exosites) may be less well captured by sequence-derived
models.

In summary, our analysis indicates that Cascleave 2.0 has out-
performed other tools for most proteases, through the integra-
tion of informative sequence and functional features. Cascleave
2.0 can be used as a powerful tool for predicting difﬁcult cleav-
age sites that cannot be readily identiﬁed by tools based on
sequence information only.

3.6 Application of Cascleave 2.0 to human proteome

After showing the predictive ability of Cascleave 2.0 to predict
substrate cleavage sites using both the benchmark and independ-
ent tests, we further applied it to screen the human proteome
(with a total of 86 728 proteins) for novel substrates and their
cleavage sites. Models were trained using the ﬁnal optimal fea-
tures based on the complete training dataset. Substrates contain-
ing predicted cleavage sites at the 99% speciﬁcity level were
considered as high-conﬁdence putative targets of the protease.
A complete list of the predicted substrates and cleavage sites is
given at the Web site (http://www.structbioinfor.org/cascleave2),
along with the implemented Java Applet and user instructions.
An attractive advantage of the Java implementation is that it
provides a user-friendly interface and allows for a proteome-
wide screening analysis (see Supplementary Fig. S5 for screen-
shots). The statistics of predicted cleavage sites of caspase-1, 3, 7,
6, 8 and granzyme B are shown in Supplementary Table S15. In
contrast, caspase-1 has the lowest number of predicted substrates
and cleavage sites (509 substrates/9591 sites). On the other hand,
granzyme B substrates have on average the smallest number of
predicted cleavage sites (~2.2 sites per substrate). In addition,
scalability of our algorithm is also important, as it will hinder a
wider adoption if it takes hours to process some of the results.
We performed proteome-wide substrate screening of the mouse
proteome and this process took about 24h to ﬁnish. Owing to
limited availability of experimentally veriﬁed substrate data for
the murine caspases, we only trained the model for the murine
caspase-1 and applied the trained model to identify a number of
high-conﬁdence substrates. All proteome-wide prediction results
can be downloaded from our Web site. In addition, as more
experimentally veriﬁed substrate data become available, we will

3.7 Case study

To further demonstrate the predictive power of Cascleave 2.0,
we performed a case study of two different substrates for

which the cleavage sites have been experimentally validated.

Cascleave 2.0

 

Sequence-scanning results and the predicted cleavage sites with
respect to the protein domain are displayed in Figure 6.

The ﬁrst example is the proteasome activator complex subunit
3 (REG-gamma UniProt ID: P61289), which activates the tryp-
sin-like catalytic subunit of the proteasome but inhibits the
chymotrypsin-like and postglutamyl—preferring subunits
(Realini et al., 1997; Wilk et al., 2000). Site-directed mutagenesis
indicates that REG-gamma has one cleavage site of caspase-3:
DGLD|GPTY (‘|’ denotes the cleavage site) (Araya et al., 2002).
Cascleave 2.0 correctly predicted this cleavage site, with a cleav-
age probability score of 0.804. The second example is the
Annexin A5 (UniProt ID: P08758) (Bogdanova et al., 2007),
an anticoagulant protein that acts as an indirect inhibitor of
the thromboplastin—speciﬁc complex (Grundmann et al., 1988).
Annexin A5 has four experimentally determined cleavage sites of
caspase-6 (Klaiman et al., 2008). Cascleave 2.0 successfully
predicted three of them: LEDD|VVGD, VEQDlAQAL and
SEID|LFNI, failing to identify the fourth cleavage site:
VVGDITSGY, when assigning a higher cutoff threshold of
0.65. Nevertheless, if a lower cutoff of 0.49 was used,
RDPD|AGID site would have been included as a cleavage site,
with a ranking of fourth place, among the ﬁve predicted sites.
These results suggest that Cascleave 2.0 can be used as a useful
tool for in silica cleavage site prediction.

4 CONCLUSION

In summary, we provided a novel approach, termed Cascleave
2.0, which has signiﬁcantly improved the prediction of protease-
speciﬁc substrate cleavage sites for caspase-1, 3, 6, 7, 8 and gran-
zyme B, by integrating heterogeneous sequence and functional
features from multiple sources. It uses a two-step integrative
framework to characterize protein sequence and functional fea-
tures that are important for determining the substrate speciﬁcity
of different proteases. Benchmarking experiments indicate that
Cascleave 2.0 is able to provide a performance that is better than
or competitive with other existing tools. Prioritization and dis-
section of novel protease-substrate interactions will likely beneﬁt
from the development of caspase-speciﬁc bioinformatic tools
such as Cascleave 2.0. To the best of our knowledge, this study
represents the ﬁrst systematic effort to scrutinize and select more
relevant features that make a signiﬁcant contribution to the pre-
diction of caspase and GrB cleavage sites based on feature selec-
tion, in contrast to previous studies few of which have used
feature selection methods to address this important task.
Moreover, the high-conﬁdence predicted substrates and their
cleavage sites produced in this study also provide a rich know-
ledge base for follow-up hypothesis-driven experiments in the
ﬁeld of protease biology.

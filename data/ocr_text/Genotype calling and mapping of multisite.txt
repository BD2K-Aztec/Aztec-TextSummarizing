ABSTRACT

Motivation: Due to a genome duplication event in the recent
history of salmonids, modern Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) have
a mosaic genome with roughly one-third being tetraploid. This is
a complicating factor in genotyping and genetic mapping since
polymorphisms within duplicated regions (multisite variants; MSVs)
are challenging to call and to assign to the correct paralogue.
Standard genotyping software offered by Illumina has not been
written to interpret MSVs and will either fail or miscall these
polymorphisms. For the purpose of mapping, linkage or association
studies in non-diploid species, there is a pressing need for software
that includes analysis of MSVs in addition to regular single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) markers.

Results: A software package is presented for the analysis of partially
tetraploid genomes genotyped using Illumina Infinium BeadArrays
(Illumina Inc.) that includes pre-processing, clustering, plotting and
validation routines. More than 3000 salmon from an aquacultural
strain in Norway, distributed among 266 full-sib families, were
genotyped on a 15K BeadArray including both SNP- and MSV-
markers. A total of 4268 SNPs and 1471 MSVs were identified,
with average call accuracies of 0.97 and 0.86, respectively. A total
of 150 MSVs polymorphic in both paralogs were dissected and
mapped to their respective chromosomes, yielding insights about the
salmon genome reversion to diploidy and improving marker genome
coverage. Several retained homologies were found and are reported.

1 INTRODUCTION

Salmonid ﬁshes have experienced several whole genome duplication
(WGD) events in their evolutionary history (Danzmann et al.,
2008). The 2R hypothesis states there have been two early WGD
events (common for all jawed vertebrates), which were followed
by subsequent 3R (common for all ray—ﬁnned ﬁshes) and 4R
duplications (unique for the salmonid lineage). Usually, WGD

is followed by extensive modiﬁcations of both the genome and
transcriptome, with a gradual return to diploidy occurring over
time (Semon and Wolfe, 2007; Wolfe, 2001). The key event
during reversion to diploidy is the switch from tetrasomic to
disomic inheritance, i.e. from having four chromosomes forming
a quadrivalent to having two pairs each forming a bivalent during
meiosis. Salmon is still in the process of returning to diploidy after
the latest WGD, and the genome displays substantial evidence of
retained homologies (Danzmann et al., 2008).

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers have proven
useful in linkage and association studies, and next—generation
sequencing technologies have created exciting opportunities for
genome sequencing and SNP discovery. The process of SNP
discovery is not straightforward, however, and duplicated genomes
in particular contain paralogous sequence variants (PSVs), which
are readily mistaken for SNPs (Fredman et al., 2004). A PSV is
created when there is a base pair difference between the sequences
of two paralogs, but the substitution does not segregate within either
paralogue. Another source of variation in polyploid genomes are
multisite variants (MSV) which, in contrast to PSVs, segregate for
a base substitution in one or both of the paralogous loci (Fredman
et al., 2004). MSVs are polymorphic and potentially informative;
however, lack of designated software for polyploid genomes makes
analysis difﬁcult. In Atlantic salmon and other salmonids, the large
numbers of MSVs and PSVs have complicated the use of SNP
arrays in genome—wide association (GWAS) and population genetics
studies. This is also true for polyploid species of major agronomic
importance such as wheat and potato.

Illumina’s Inﬁnium® technology (Illumina Inc) is one of the most
widely used SNP array technologies, which allows simultaneous
genotyping of thousands to millions of SNPs in samples run in
parallel on a single silicon slide (Shen et al., 2005; Steemers and
Gunderson, 2007). The assay chemistry translates the sample allele
composition into red and green ﬂuorophores [see Steemers and
Gunderson (2007) for more detail].

Illumina’s proprietary GenomeStudio Genotyping Analysis
Module (v1.6.3 or an earlier relative) converts red and green signals
for each SNP into A and B signals whose values reﬂect the relative
abundance of arbitrarily assigned A and B alleles. Signal is converted
into polar coordinates, using the Manhattan distance metric for
the intensity R, and with Theme [0,1] representing angle 6 [0,90]
degrees. Each marker is clustered in Cartesian coordinates, and the
genotypes {AA, AB, BB} are assigned to samples in clusters close
to Theta = {0, %,1 }. An example of a typical diploid SNP with well
separated clusters is given in Figure 1a.

and the red and green clusters contain homozygoteAAs and BBs, respectively.

respectively. ((1) An MSV—S containing all ﬁve combinations in which the
two segregating paralogs can vary. The colours of the clusters reﬂect the
B—allele ratios as above.

MSVs differ from diploid SNPs in that the measured signal results
from a mixture of four alleles rather than two. These four alleles
give rise to a maximum of ﬁve different genotype combinations
{AAAA, AAAB, AABB, ABBB, BBBB}, which would be identiﬁed
by Theta values close to {0, 41¢, %, ET, 1}, respectively. In instances
where markers segregate in one of the paralogs with the other being
ﬁxed, up to three cluster positions can be recognized. A ﬁxed AA
paralogue will result in clusters around Theta: {0, g, é}, whereas a

ﬁxed BB paralogue will generate clusters around Theta={é, 3,1}.
Examples of such markers, which we term MSV—a and MSV—b,
respectively, are given in Figure lb and 0, although they may be
collectively referred to as MSV—3. A less frequent, but nevertheless
highly informative MSV, is one which segregates at both paralogous
loci simultaneously producing up to ﬁve clusters. These are called
MSV—S’s and display the Theta values given above and illustrated
in Figure 1d. Though MSVs would be useful in both linkage and
association studies, Illumina’s GenomeStudio Genotyping Analysis
Module does not recognize such variants, and MSVs would typically
be discarded or genotypes incorrectly assigned. This is undesirable in
Atlantic salmon and indeed other mosaic tetraploids, since it means
a signiﬁcant part of the genome cannot be integrated in GWAS.
Genotypes from MSV—S’s are especially desirable since they impart
information about two paralogous loci resulting from the latest WGD
event.

Our aim was to develop algorithms and software to identify
and call genotypes from SNPs, PSVs and MSVs in polyploid
genomes. Detailed mathematical justiﬁcations of the different steps
in the analysis are outside the scope of the paper but details of
the algorithms are found in the documentation of the published
software package (see below). This article outlines the theory and
offers empirical evidence that illustrates the functionality of the
program. We emphasize that when different pre—processing and
analysis schemes are used in this work, this is motivated by the
need to highlight strengths and weaknesses of the available methods

rather than to ﬁnd a single best procedure. This enables users to
decide on the best options for their own experimental setup and
data, as these are expected to vary, for example depending on the
extent of polyploidy. The efﬁcacy of the software is demonstrated by
the successful mapping of MSVs in Atlantic salmon, which enabled
us to determine the extent of polyploidy in this genome.

A new R—package, beadarrayMSV, is presented here that
(i) provides extensions to existing classes speciﬁcally tailored to
work with Inﬁnium data, (ii) introduces options for pre—processing
of the raw data including transformation, (iii) is able to cluster
and automatically call genotypes such as PSVs and MSVs and
(iv) contains functionality to split the signal of MSV—S’s into
two individual paralogs. Quality control (QC) is performed using
pedigree information combined with visual inspection of markers
scoring poorly on a set of QC parameters. Interactive clustering of
problematic markers is also possible. The ability to resolve and map
MSVs to chromosomes enables subsequent ﬁne—mapping of markers
in areas of the genome which would be otherwise poorly covered.
The technique may also be used to verify suggested homologies or
propose new ones. To make processing of large datasets possible,
data are sequentially read and written from and to ﬁles when
necessary. The package beadarrayMSV is freely available from the
CRAN repository (http://cran.r—proj ect.orgl) under the GNU General
Public License.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS
2.1 Genotyping

Atlantic salmon genomic DNA was extracted from ﬁn clips provided by the
Norwegian breeding company Aqua Gen. A total of 3230 ﬁsh (offspring and
parents) distributed among 266 full—sib families were genotyped using an
Atlantic salmon custom design iSelect SNP array containing 15 225 markers
following standard protocols (Kent et al., 2009). In total 2648 of the markers
were Inﬁnium I, with the remainder being Inﬁnium II. Bead arrays were
scanned on an iScan reader, and the standard Inﬁnium II scan settings
protocol had been modiﬁed to record bead level intensity data in .txt format.

2.2 R-package beadarrayMSV

2.2.1 Data import and classes Two new R classes, ‘BeadSetIllumina’
and ‘AlleleSetIllumina’, are deﬁned for the analysis of Inﬁnium data. Both
extend the Bioconductor—class ‘eSet’ and inherit all its methods for subsetting
and working with genomic data (Gentleman et al., 2004). Functionality was
adapted from the beadarray package (Dunning et al., 2007) in order to load
bead summary data from a repository of scanned arrays and arrange them
in an instance of the BeadSetIllumina—class. A number of normalization and
transformation routines take these data structures as input.

As Inﬁnium I markers are represented by two bead types, these must
be combined to a single marker before genotype calling. The class
AlleleSetIllumina is introduced to hold (marker >< samples) data tables
such as intensity and theta, containing the polar coordinates signal. A11
genotype calling procedures use instances of this class. As many genotyping
experiments produce too much data for a single R—session, functions for
reading and writing marker— and sample—information from and to ﬁles are
provided.

We refer to the beadarray package if there is a need to analyze the scanned
image ﬁles directly. Alternatively, binary summary ﬁles (idat—ﬁles) may be
loaded and processed using the crlmm package (Ritchie et al., 2009). A third
package beadarraySNP contains additional methods for normalization and
analysis of genotype data (Oosting et al., 2007). These packages all have their
unique strengths, and some methods can be used in combination with the
beadarrayMSV package since they extend the Bioconductor classes. Note,

green versus red signal for all markers on an arbitrary array is shown, after
the data have been initially sheared and rotated. Estimated new axes after
transformation are indicated. The two clouds along the axes correspond
to monomorphs, and the cloud protruding 45 degrees from the origin
corresponds to polymorphic markers. (3) No transformation, (b) fourth root
transformation with offset and (c) log transformation with offset. The range of
the green signal (y—axis) is smaller than the range of the red signal (x—axis).
There is also an observed curvature in the polymorphic cloud. ((1) After
quantile normalization of the non—transformed data, the intensities of the
channels are comparable and the polymorphic cloud appears straighter.

however, that the normalization and genotyping facilities implemented in
beadarrayMSV depend on certain required elements such as bead standard
errors being available.

2.2.2 Pre-processing The initial shearing and rotation of the red and green
signals performed in the GenomeStudio Genotyping Module (Peiffer et al.,
2006) is mimicked in the package.

Fluorescence data, such as those produced by the Inﬁnium technology,
are generally heteroscedastic, i.e. the error variance increases with signal
strength. Use of heteroscedastic data in analysis affects the distribution
of clusters in the plot of intensity versus theta for a marker, as the
clusters tend to segregate towards theta = 0 and theta = I . In GenomeStudio,
diploid SNPs often appear with tightly clustered homozygote samples,
whereas the heterozygote samples are more widely spread along the
theta axis. This is a direct consequence of the signal in both channels
being heteroscedastic and should not be mistaken for higher precision of
homozygotes compared with heterozygotes. The same effect is also observed
in the pooled analysis of Macgregor et al. (2008), where they regard
and correct for theta as binomially distributed frequency estimates with
variance theta(1 —theta). The heteroscedasticity is of little or no practical
consequence for calling regular SNPs, however MSVs, which by deﬁnition
have more closely positioned clusters, may be more difﬁcult to detect
using non—transformed data. Log transformations are often used to reduce
heteroscedasticity; however, these also alter the axes around zero in a manner
which may be too drastic for our purposes. We have found that a fourth
root transformation (or equivalent) provides a good compromise between
reducing heteroscedasticity and maintaining a low uncertainty for points
close to zero. Both these transformations require positive values, and an
offset may be added if needed. The red and green signals after different
transformations are plotted for an arbitrary array in Figure 2a—c. After
transformation, a new origin in the scatter plots of green (G) versus red
(R) for each array needs to be found, which is equivalent to removing the
background signal. The background can be deduced using the Inﬁnium I—
beads since a single colour is used to detect [A/T] and [C/G] alleles, the
colour is arbitrary since it is generated by the base following the marker and
not the marker itself. This means that for each Inﬁnium I—bead, one channel

will detect nothing but background noise. The distribution of this noise can
be parameterized, giving not only an origin but also the expected noise level
for each array. The noise levels are subsequently used to ﬁnd a detection
limit below which no genotypes are called.

The average intensity of the red channel for any given array is not equal to
the intensity of its green counterpart, and the Illumina software linearly scales
both channels such that the centroids of candidate AA and BB homozygotes
get a value of ~1 (Peiffer et al., 2006). A similar scaling is implemented
in beadarrayMSV using a quantile of all markers. Another linear option
is to scale the red channel such that the median red allele frequency
[medianAF; R / (R+G)] is 0.5 for each array. This is a modiﬁed version of
the scaling suggested by Macgregor et al. (2008). The data from the red and
green channels have systematically different distributions, which results in
a pronounced curvature in the cloud of polymorphic markers when G versus
R is plotted for an array (Fig. 2a—c) (Staaf et al., 2008). To account for
such non—linear effects, quantile normalization is made available through the
limma—package (Smyth and Speed, 2003). An example of non—transformed
data after quantile normalization is given in Figure 2d.

2.2.3 Polar representation After pre—processing, the BeadSetIllumina
object is converted into an instance of the class AlleleSetIllumina by merging
the Inﬁnium I—beads such that one marker is represented by a single feature
rather than two bead types. After ﬁrst converting the ‘bead—type’ intensities
R and G to ‘marker’ intensities A and B, these are next transformed to
polar coordinates intensity and theta, where theta: {0, 1} correspond to
angles {0,90} degrees. A distance measure is chosen depending on the
transformation used. The best distance measure is one which ensures that the
mean signals of the homozygote and heterozygote clusters are similar. This
implies that the ﬁrst quadrant unit circle should resemble the geometrical
shape formed by the extent of the three clusters in each of Figure 2a—c.
The Manhattan distance used in GenomeStudio is ideal for non—transformed
data as the ﬁrst quadrant semicircle corresponds to a straight line in
Euclidean space. Drawing a straight line between the homozygote clusters
after transformation would, however, lead to relatively higher intensities of
the heterozygote samples (compare Fig. 2a with 2b and c). This is avoided by
using a Minkowski (p—norm) distance instead, the norm p being larger than
two, as the unit circle of such a distance resembles a square with rounded
comers in Euclidean geometry.

As suggested in Figures 1 and 2, the clusters of homozygotes are centred
around theta = {0, 1} rather than being conﬁned within these limits. This is
to allow clusters to be centred on the expected cluster positions, which is a
better criterion after transformation. If B versus A were plotted in Cartesian
coordinates, the arc length of the ﬁrst quadrant of a p—nonn circle with radius
given by intensity would increase with the radius depending on the value of
p. When intensity versus theta on the other hand is plotted in Cartesian
coordinates, the corresponding arc length is always one, as it is deﬁned by
the distance between theta =0 and theta =1. For the standard errors to be
representative also in this plot, they need to be scaled with the intensity—
dependent arc length. The standard errors are pooled between the channels
and divided with the p—nonn arc length found by numerical integration. One
can imagine a low—intensity point whose uncertainty spans the origin in a
B versus A scatter plot, this point would be given a large uncertainty in the
intensity versus theta plot. Similarly, a point with high intensity would be
given a low uncertainty.

2.2.4 Clustering and calling of genotypes Genotype calling for each
marker is based on k—means clustering in the two dimensions deﬁned by
intensity and theta. The clustering is simpliﬁed by recognizing that only a
few more cluster combinations are allowed when we extend the analysis to
account also for tetraploid loci. Still, the utility of k—means depends on the
existence of clearly deﬁned clusters, and sparsely populated and widespread
overlapping clusters may yield inaccurate results. We identify seven genotype
classes in which to place all the markers; these are MONO—a, MONO—b, SNP,
PSV, MSV—a, MSV—b and MSV—5. The ﬁrst two denote monomorphicAA and
BB, respectively, the remainder were deﬁned earlier. Only those data points
exceeding the estimated noise level are analyzed. Further, samples with

the largest standard error may be eliminated from the clustering to provide
more accurate clusters. This is useful when many, redundant data points are
available to represent each cluster. Removed samples are reintroduced once
cluster patterns have been deﬁned.

Based on a histogram of theta values and knowledge about the seven
allowed cluster combinations, a ranked list of the most likely genotype
classes is suggested. This approach improves the probability of detecting very
small clusters, and it ensures reproducible clustering as the starting conditions
will be the same in every analysis. The suggested cluster combinations are in
turn subjected to a series of tests until one is found which ﬁts the following
criteria: (i) the maximum deviation of a cluster centre from its theoretical
theta position cannot exceed devCentLim, (ii) the maximum within cluster
spread cannot exceed wSpreadLim, (iii) the probability of Hardy—Weinberg
(HW) equilibrium must exceed thlpha, (iv) the clusters cannot overlap
as deﬁned by their previously calculated centres and spread in the theta
direction. Markers passing the quality control are subjected to a Hotelling’s
Tz—test (Gidskehaug et al., 2007), which effectively superimposes an ellipse
on each cluster and discards all data points falling outside its boundaries or
within overlapping ellipses. The extents of the clusters are controlled by the
signiﬁcance level clAlpha 0f the TZ—tests in such a way that small clAlpha
levels yield large ellipses. The call rate is then required to be larger than a
predeﬁned threshold detectLim. Finally, if the within cluster spread in the
theta direction compared to the intensity direction is too large, the algorithm
moves on to the next most likely cluster combination. If a marker passes
all the tests for one of the candidate cluster combinations, the genotype is
called, otherwise the marker is failed.

A key difﬁculty with assessing MSV—5’s is that the allele frequencies in the
individual paralogs are not directly measured. Rather, it is the mean B allele
frequency (BAF) across both paralogs that is inferred from the clustering.
The most likely individual BAFs are, however, estimated and reported in the
HW test. The quality of these estimates depends on the probability of HW
equilibrium.

When parental genotypes are available for the sampled animals, tracking
the inherited alleles from parents to offspring is the best method for
determining the quality of the clustering and genotype calls. Pedigree
checking is included for both SNPs and MSVs, and an overview of
the informative meioses and pedigree errors for MSV—5’s is provided in
Supplementary Material S1. Discrepancies may sometimes be detected
close to the cluster borders, and if a large number of pedigree errors are
found it may be due to erroneous clustering. Functions for interactive
reassignments of clusters, or in extreme cases a manual reclustering, are
implemented. These make use of the package rggobi, an R—interface to
the dynamic graphics package GGobi (www.ggobi.org/rgg0bi/). The ability
to interactively visualize and modify clustering results is an important
quality control step also in Illumina’s software, and automatic clustering
results should always be validated by the researcher. This subjective, ﬁnal
assessment is the best guarantee that the estimated genotypes are as accurate
as possible.

Several genotype calling and testing metrics are returned that collectively
indicate the clustering quality for each marker. These include the maximum
deviation from expected cluster positions, the maximum within cluster
spread, the probability of HW equilibrium and the call rate. If pedigree
validation has been performed, the number of pedigree errors for each marker
may also be found. No overall probability is returned, as this would have to
depend on many factors and the estimate would likely be uncertain. Rather,
the markers may be ranked using the different quality estimates in order to
plot or interactively recluster any questionable markers.

With a little added functionality, the genotype calling algorithm could
in theory be utilized for analysing higher ploidy species as well. It would,
however, require very accurate data to reliably detect clusters that are closer
together than the tetraploid MSVs in the current dataset.

2.2.5 MSV-5 mapping Initially, all calls are identiﬁed by the B—allele
ratios of the markers. For instance, call 2% means genotype AB or AABB

depending on whether the marker is a SNP or an MSV/PSV, respectively.
For all genotype classes except MSV—5, these calls can be directly translated
into genotypes once the relevant marker— and strand—information is known.

The mapping of MSV—5’s in beadarrayMSV is a three—step process which
involves: (i) splitting of markers into two paralogs for all informative
meioses within half—sib families, (ii) naming the individual paralogs with
unique names reﬂecting their chromosome numbers and (iii) merging the
linkage information across families for both parents and supplementing with
additional, remaining meioses. The mapping of MSV—5 paralogs starts by
creating individual markers with names referring to paralogue 1 and 2.
These names are arbitrarily chosen and therefore unique only within the
half—sib families. Those calls that can be split according to the tables in
Supplementary Material S1 are then ﬁlled in for each half—sib family. This
results in two sparsely populated data tables, one for the fathers and one
for the mothers. Step two of the analysis involves associating the individual
paralogs with several markers of known positions in the genetic map (S.
Lien et al., manuscript in preparation, a dense SNP—based linkage map
for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar): recombination patterns and chromosome
homeologies enlightening the extent of diploidization in the salmon genome).
If a matching offspring is registered each time an informative allele in
a paralogue corresponds with an informative allele in a mapped marker,
the degree of association between the two is determined by counting the
number of matches. Associations supported by too few informative meioses
are ﬁltered away. The total number of matches across markers within each
chromosome is then divided by the number of tested markers, such that the
chromosomes with the highest average number of matches can be found. For
each MSV—5, up to two chromosomes are identiﬁed if the number of matches
per marker exceeds some threshold. The individual paralogs are given names
reﬂecting the chromosome they map to, and the merged linkage information
from both parents can be used in a single analysis across families. Tentative
chromosome positions are also provided by beadarrayMSV; however, its
main utility in this setting is to provide the split MSV—5’s for linkage mapping
using other software.

2.3 Data analysis

Two analyses, ‘run 1’ and ‘run 2’, were performed with different pre—
processing of the data. For both runs, the raw data for each channel were
initially sheared and rotated. In run 1, an offset of 200 was then added to
the data before fourth root transformation. The channels were subsequently
medianAF—normalized, and the genotype of each marker was called using
the default settings. In run 2, no additional transformation of the data was
performed, but the channels were quantile normalized. Default genotype—
settings were used except for the parameters devCentLim and wSpreadLim,
controlling the maximum allowed cluster centre deviation and within—cluster
spread. These were in run 2 set to 0.4 and 0.15, respectively, to account for
the uneven separation and spread of clusters resulting from heteroscedastic
data. All settings were considered optimal for each transformation.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Genotype calling

A summary of the results is given in Table 1. From the total number
of around 15K markers on the array, more than 50% were classiﬁed
as MONO, PSV or FAIL. This reﬂects challenges related to SNP
discovery in polyploid species (Moen et al., 2008; Sanchez et al.,
2009), but it is important to note that many of the monomorphic
markers in this population are polymorphic in other populations
(Kent et al., 2009).

Some quality scores are also presented in Table 1 to give an overall
impression of the accuracy of the calls. These scores alone should
not be used to infer which pre—processing is universally best as the
results depend heavily on the data quality, input parameters and

The variable ‘Sum’ gives the total number of called markers, ‘Acc’ is the estimated
fraction of correct calls based on visual inspection of up to 220 markers in each class,
‘Ped’ is an alternative accuracy estimated as the fraction of calls with 15 offspring
pedigree errors or less and ‘nP’ is the average number of pedigree errors per marker
(from the full set of 2915 offspring). The genotype categories ‘MON O-a’, ‘MON O-b’,
‘PSV’, ‘SNP’, ‘MSV—a’, ‘MSV—b’ and ‘MSV—5’ are deﬁned above, and non-assigned
markers are denoted ‘FAIL’.

aBased on the full set of MSV—5 markers.

the subjective assessment of which calls are correct. The accuracy
(‘Acc’) of the calls, deﬁned as the fraction of correct calls among
all markers assigned to a category, was assessed through visual
inspection. The ﬁrst 220 markers within each category were selected
for inspection, except for MSV—5 where all were included. The
selection of the ﬁrst 220 markers is expected to be unbiased as there
is no theoretical or discernible trend between marker performance
and their alphabetical order. The accuracy was high in both runs,
though more PSVs and MSVs (and less monomorphics and SNPs)
were found in run 1 than in run 2. With a notable exception for
PSVs, there was a strong tendency that more calls within a category
implied both more correct assignments and more false positives.
A more objective quality criterion than visual inspection (though
not necessarily more accurate) is to declare all markers with more
than 15 offspring pedigree errors as false calls. This gave rise to the
alternative accuracy ‘Ped’ in Table 1, which is based on the full set
of markers. The two estimates of accuracy are similar in both runs,
except ‘Acc’ is higher for the MSV—a and —b in run 2. The average
number of pedigree errors per marker (‘nP’) was less for SNPs than
for MSVs, and the median number of pedigree errors was zero in
all cases. Error rates were well within what is expected given the
genotyping error rate.

The above accuracies are not exact, as the true genotypes were
not known. However, when a large sample is used, it is usually
clear from visual inspection whether the clustering successfully
distributes the data into genotype groups. In addition, information
about sample pedigree is very effective at highlighting instances of
poor clustering. In some instances, it was difﬁcult to distinguish
between an MSV—3 and a SNP; however, such errors do not
inﬂuence the subsequent mapping. Based on markers that were
unambiguously called we estimated that the percentage of incorrect
calls was at most 4—5% for SNPs and 8—10% for MSVs. Signiﬁcant
improvements to these accuracies are unlikely since some assays
fail to work correctly, possibly due to secondary mutations in SNP
ﬂanking regions.

Some selected markers are plotted in Figure 3, with run 1 in
the ﬁrst row and run 2 in the second row. The SNP to the left

was correctly called in both instances, but the blue cluster of
heterozygotes was far to the right from its ideal position. Combined
with elongated clusters in the intensity direction, this led to wrong
assignments of some heterozygotes to the green cluster in run 2. The
yellow cross indicates one such offspring that failed the pedigree
check, and its parents are identiﬁed by yellow circles.

A subset of heterozygous samples deviated from the main cluster
for the second marker in Figure 3. Possible reasons for this deviation
could be differences in DNA quality, sample preparation or lab
processing. Both runs correctly called this marker a SNP; however,
incorrect assignment of the deviating cluster in run 2 gave rise
to pedigree errors. The MSV—b (third example from the left) was
not identiﬁed in the second run at all, as three clusters could not
be distinguished by the algorithm. The last example (to the far
right) is an MSV—5 which was correctly called in both runs, but
where run 2 performed much better in terms of both interpretation
and assignments of samples close to the cluster borders. Due to
overlapping clusters in run 1, many of the samples were called
incorrectly, while the quantile normalization in run 2 contributed to
the clusters being upright and well deﬁned. Overall, run 1 performed
better for these data in terms of more identiﬁed MSVs and a higher
occurrence of compact clusters. For the rest of the article, we will
therefore use and refer to the results of run 1.

3.2 Mapping of MSV-S’s

The set of 132 detected MSV—5’s (Table 1) was supplemented with
61 initially failed markers visually found to resemble MSV—5’s. The
full set was subjected to quality control using the interactive plotting
tools in beadarrayMSV, and manual clustering or re—assignments
of clusters were performed where needed. A small number of the
ambiguous markers were included in the set as we wanted to identify
as many homeologies as possible. Pedigree validation and visual
inspection resulted in a list of 150 MSV—5’s which were split into
paralogs, in the majority of cases these were successfully mapped to
chromosomes. An example is given in Figure 4, which reveals that
the paralogs of marker ‘ESTNV_29659_1478’ are likely found on
chromosomes 7 and 17. Phillips et al. (2009) conﬁrm that the q—arm
of chromosome 7 is homeologous to a segment of chromosome 17
as result of the recent genome duplication event in salmonids. The
full set of suggested homeologies or single marker duplications is
given in Table 2. Note that this method is not able to distinguish
true homeologies from smaller scale duplications; however, it is
an indication of previous genome duplication if a large number of
MSV—5’s are found that map to the same pairs of chromosomes. In
that sense, these data conﬁrmed the ‘2/5’—, ‘7/17’—, ‘4/8’— and ‘3/6’—
homeologies. The ‘11/26’—homeology was supported by only two
markers in this study; however, this is still more than the previously
reported numbers.

Five suggested homologies were supported by a single MSV—5
marker only. Of these, two corresponded to veriﬁed homeologies;
however, three remained uncertain. The ‘1/6’—pair had a small peak
for chromosome 1 that might be a false positive (data not shown).
The ‘13/15’—pair had a peak for chromosome 13 supported by
the fathers only. A single duplication on these chromosomes is,
however, reported by Danzmann et al. (2005,2008). The ‘19/29’—
pair had two signiﬁcant peaks based on the linkage information
from the mothers only. In addition to the pairs presented in Table 2,

Fig. 3. Comparison of genotype calling results based on four example markers after two different pre—processing settings. For run 1 (upper row), the default
fourth root transformation and medianAF channel normalization were performed. For run 2 (bottom row), no transformation was performed, but the channels
were quantile normalized. In general, the heteroscedasticity of the data in run 2 leads to smaller spread in theta for the homozygote compared with the
heterozygote clusters. Still, the classiﬁcations of the markers are identical between the runs, except for ‘ESTNV_16766_113’, which is failed in run 2. Also,
there are apparently non—systematic differences in the number of pedigree errors between the runs. The lower variance of points close to theta = {0, 1} in run
2 seems to complicate the clustering of ‘ESTNV_16766_113’, which is an MSV—3.

Fig. 4. The total number of matches between MSV—5 paralogs and the
linkage map markers for each chromosome, divided by the number of
markers representing that chromosome. The example shows an MSV—5
marker whose paralogs map to the homeologous regions of chromosomes 7
and 17.

42 markers were mapped to 19 single chromosomes. These may
represent repeated elements on the same chromosomes, but many
are likely due to an insufﬁcient number of informative meioses for
the second chromosome. This may happen when the minor allele
frequency for one of the paralogs is low. For eight of the 150 markers,
no signiﬁcant peaks could be found. This is likely due to limited
meiotic information or false positive MSV—5 calls.

The 242 resolved paralogs were included in the linkage map using
CRI—MAP (Green et al., 1990) and are reported in Supplementary
Material S2. Representations of chromosomes 2 and 5, including the
mapped MSV—5 paralogs, are plotted in Figure 5. The approximate
shapes and relative sizes of the chromosomes were adapted from
Phillips et al. (2009). The relevant parts of the (female) genetic map
were superimposed on the illustrations in Figure 5. The illustration
shows that all 39 ‘2/5’ pairs from Table 2 are located on the p—arm
of chromosome 2 and the q—arm of chromosome 5. In addition, the
q—arm of chromosome 2 holds one of the paralogs of the ‘2/ 12’ pair.

aHighly supported homeologous chromosome arms (Phillips et al., 2009). The number
of supporting markers is compared to those of bPhillips et al. (2009), CDanzmann et al.
(2008) and dDanzmann et al. (2005).

These results verify two of the homeologies reported by Phillips et al.
(2009). Paths have been drawn between corresponding paralogs for
a few selected markers. Though a degree of imprecision due to
small genetic distances in the relevant regions is expected, there
are indications that the homeologous segment of chromosome 5 is
ﬂipped compared with chromosome 2.

4 CONCLUSIONS

SNP array genotyping software (such as that supplied by Illumina)
typically call genotypes at diploid SNP markers very accurately;
however, it is unreliable when markers are in duplicated genome
regions. While MSV—3 ’s can be called correctly, this requires manual
inspection and is a daunting task when thousands of markers are

genotyped, in contrast to MSV-5’s that cannot be called at all.
Consequently, an automated routine for analyzing such data is highly
desirable.

The main objective for developing beadarrayMSV was to
enable analysis of Illumina BeadArrays in the partly tetraploid
Atlantic salmon. This has resulted in a ﬂexible R-package with
demonstrated merit for duplicated genomes. The methods should
also be useful for genomes typically characterized as diploid
to identify duplicated regions. The data structures provided are
useful for any data genotyped on the Inﬁnium platform, and the
tools developed for normalization, transformation and plotting have
general applicability.

The work towards a complete reference genome for Atlantic
salmon is still in progress; however, the mosaic tetraploid nature
of the salmon genome complicates assembly. Tools which enable
calling and mapping of markers of duplicated regions will represent
a valuable contribution towards this activity. From a more practical
point of view, prior to designing a new SNP-chip it is very hard
to tell whether a putative marker is a SNP or an MSV, especially
when no reference genome is available. Having tools that enable
us to utilize MSV markers on chips means that available resources
for SNP discovery and genotyping can be expanded to a greater
proportion of the genome. By identifying MSV—markers on the
salmon Illumina SNP array, we were able to increase the number

of useable polymorphic markers by 35% compared to using the
SNP markers only. Subsequent GWAS and genomic selection
(Meuwissen et al., 2001) studies in Atlantic salmon are likely to
beneﬁt from these improvements. Lastly, the MSVs and MSV—5’s
in particular hold important clues to how the genome of salmon has
evolved since the last duplication event. Further studies using this
information may shed additional light on the processes involved in
diploidization and speciation in general.

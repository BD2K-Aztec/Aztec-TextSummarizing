ABSTRACT

Summary: Biogem provides a software development environment
for the Ruby programming language, which encourages community-
based software development for bioinformatics while lowering the
barrier to entry and encouraging best practices.

Biogem, with its targeted modular and decentralized approach,
software generator, tools and tight web integration, is an improved
general model for scaling up collaborative open source software
development in bioinformatics.

Availability: Biogem and modules are free and are OSS.
Biogem runs on all systems that support recent versions
of Ruby, including Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. Further
information at http://www.biogems.info. A tutorial is available at
http://www.biogems.info/howto.html

1 INTRODUCTION

In biomedical science, new technologies, data formats and methods
emerge continuously. Scientists want to take advantage of these
developments as soon as possible, which requires bioinformatics

software to keep up with new requirements. We support the notion
of the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) that development
of collaborative open source software (088) is essential for
bioinformatics. The OBF represents a number of important projects,
such as BioPerl (Stajich et al., 2002), Biopython (Cock et al., 2009),
BioRuby (Goto et al., 2010) and BioJava (Holland et al., 2008).
These Bio—star (Bio*) projects effectively function as community
centres and share a centralized approach in software development
with large source code repositories. Bio>l< projects, generally, aim
for consolidated tools, a stable application programming interface
(API), and backwards compatibility.

Within the BioRuby project we experienced the drive for stability
easily overwhelmed and discouraged developers. Not only because
of the complexity of the existing code base, but also because coding
standards are enforced, and extensive tests and documentation are
required. Furthermore, newly contributed code may be subject
to community scrutiny, and in many cases further demands for
improving the code follow. The full process introduces a signiﬁcant
delay between initial idea and ﬁnal acceptance of the code in the
main project. Months, even years, may pass between stable releases
of main Bio>l< projects. It may take a long time before a new feature
is publicly released.

To scale up collaborative software development in BioRuby, we
recognized existing and new developers need to be encouraged
to contribute more code. To achieve this, we created Biogem a
Ruby application framework for rapid creation of decentralized,
intemet published software modules written to lower the barrier
to entry. Biogem was initially inspired by the R/Bioconductor

Fig. 1. Biogem eases publication of new bioinformatics Ruby software modules on the Internet, in a few steps. (1) The software generator creates the directory
layout and ﬁles for a new software module named ’foo’. (2) The developer writes 0r modiﬁes source code and (3) quickly and easily publishes the source
code and module online, for others to read, install and use. Collaboration (4) is facilitated by publishing source code and changes to navigationable websites.
Then the workﬂow continues again at (2). The http://bi0gems.inf0 website tracks published modules. Popularity of each published module is tracked, as well
as source code changes, updates, bugs and issues. Unlike with the practise of publishing scientiﬁc papers, collaboration on software often comes postfactum,
i.e. after original publishing of a software module. Therefore, it pays to publish software modules early and often. This is reﬂected in the Biogem workﬂow.

packaging system (Gentleman et al., 2004), which encourages
software developers to publish software modules independently
using simple rules; and Ruby on Rails plugins (Thomas et al., 2006),
which provides a software generator and modular software plugin
system.

2 FEATURES

For Biogem, we created speciﬁc tools to support the creation of
bioinformatics software functionalities and to support development
‘best practises’, i.e. infrastructure for software speciﬁcation,
documentation and tests. We also provide tight web integration
based on public websites and services. These websites publish and
distribute software modules and give web—based access to source
code, complete with revision history (see Fig. l). Biogem exposes
Ruby bioinformatics modules, and makes developer productivity
and module popularity visible.

The primary tool of the Biogem framework is a software
generator consisting of templates for bioinformatics scripts, source

code, software speciﬁcation, documentation and tests. With the
generator, required directories and ﬁles are automatically created
from templates for a new software module. Templates are included
for commonly encountered tasks, such as command line parameter
handling, error handling, make ﬁles etc.

Another Biogem tool publishes the versioned module with its
dependencies on the internet. The published module is immediately
available for download and installation to bioinformatics users in
the form of a Ruby gem (i.e. an archive of modular Ruby code
with all the supporting ﬁles and information needed for installation
by ‘package manager’ software). We refer to a Biogem module as
a ‘BioRuby plugin’ if the module extends the BioRuby project.
Published software modules are easily repackaged by software
distributions, e.g. Debian Bio Med (Meller et al., 2010) and
BioLinux (Field at al., 2006).

The Biogem website (see Availability) makes it easy to ﬁnd and
install software modules. The website also allows people to track
releases, software dependencies, development activity, outstanding
issues, integration test results, documentation and popularity of

published modules. A map shows the location of Biogem developers
to help foster a sense of international community.

Biogem encourages software development best practices by
providing templates for documentation and multiple test driven
development strategies; such as unit tests, behaviour driven
development and a natural language parser for software speciﬁcation
(e. g. Chelimsky et al., 2010). A notable difference to the traditional
code contribution procedures of the Bio"< projects is that best
practices are encouraged, rather than enforced.

Templates are also included for certain types of functionality, e.g.
to generate portable SQL database handlers, and to build a dynamic
website. With Biogem it is possible to create a functional web
application, or service, in just a few steps. Generating the different
features is handled through work ﬂows (Fig. 1).

We added tutorials for Biogem, which explain the software
generators, templates and software publishing. These tutorials are
part of the software distribution and available online.

We created ‘collections’ that bundle important modules together
as speciﬁc releases. For example, ‘bio—core’ contains stable modules,
and ‘bio—core—ext’ contains stable modules with bindings to C
libraries. Special purpose collections exist such as ‘bio—biolinux’,
which is distributed by the Cloud Biolinux project and merged with
the Galaxy CloudMan project (Afgan et al., 2010).

In the ﬁrst 8 months of the Biogem functionality becoming
available, over 20 new modules have been published through
Biogem, showing a wide variety of subjects. These modules,

for example, target big data handling, next generation sequencing
and parsing of bioinformatics data formats (Table 1).

3 CONCLUSION

Biogem provides an environment for rapid bioinformatics software
development with a low barrier to entry. Biogem frees potential
contributors from code maturity expectations that can be deterring,
and encourages Ruby developers to contribute experimental source
code early to the BioRuby community. Through Biogem software
is published in a modular way, and best practises are encouraged
through infrastructure for software speciﬁcation and testing. All this
results in better utilization of existing and new software development
manpower, thereby scaling up OSS development in bioinformatics.

We suggest Biogem can serve as a generic model; not by
replacing existing Bio"< projects, but by supplementing them with
a decentralized and evolutionary model for collaborative software
development.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identification of conserved motifs in biological
sequences is crucial to unveil common shared functions. Many tools
exist for motif identification, including some that allow degenerate
positions with multiple possible nucleotides or amino acids. Most
efficient methods available today search conserved motifs in a set of
sequences, but do not check for their specificity regarding to a set
of negative sequences.

Results: We present a tool to identify degenerate motifs, based
on a given classification of amino acids according to their physico-
chemical properties. It returns the top K motifs that are most frequent
in a positive set of sequences involved in a biological process of
interest, and absent from a negative set. Thus, our method discovers
discriminative motifs in biological sequences that may be used to
identify new sequences involved in the same process. We used
this tool to identify candidate effector proteins secreted into plant
tissues by the root knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. Our
tool identified a series of motifs specifically present in a positive
set of known effectors while totally absent from a negative set
of evolutionarily conserved housekeeping proteins. Scanning the
proteome of M.incognita, we detected 2579 proteins that contain
these specific motifs and can be considered as new putative
effectors.

1 INTRODUCTION

Conserved motifs in biological sequences reﬂect functionally
important shared features. In genome sequences, conserved motifs
can point to promoters or regulatory elements, regions of splice
junctions between protein-coding exons or regions affecting the
shape of the chromatin. In protein sequences, such conserved motifs
can highlight signals that are important for controlling the cellular
localization (e.g. nucleus, cytoplasm, extracellular compartment),

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

regions shared between proteins that interact with a same partner or
regions important for the biochemical function itself.

Physico-chemical properties and 3D structures of proteins are
more conserved than the suite of amino acids itself. Thus, at a
given position in a protein sequence, different amino acids may
have similar structural or physico-chemical roles. Degenerate motifs
allowing multiple possible amino acids at one position are necessary
to comply with this variability. Several methods allow for discovery
of degenerate motifs (Bailey and Elkan, 1994; Ji and Bailey, 2007),
but few of them take into account similarity in terms of physico—
chemical properties of amino acids at a given position (Jonassen,
1997; Rigoutsos and Floratos, 1998).

When the purpose of the obtained motifs is to scan large datasets
(e. g. genomes, proteomes) in order to ﬁnd new sequences potentially
involved in the same biological process, another relevant point in the
motif discovery is the speciﬁcity of the identiﬁed motifs regarding
the biological process. Some systems make use of statistics to
attach a measure of signiﬁcance to each of the discovered patterns,
as deduced from a model based on the input sequences or a
public sequence database (Bailey and Elkan, 1994; Jonassen, 1997;
Rigoutsos and Floratos, 1998). For many biological applications,
however, a negative set of sequences not involved in the process of
interest can be compiled, and this set can be used as a more direct
way to evaluate the relevance of the motifs. While several motif
discovery processes take into consideration a negative sequence set
(Bailey et al., 2010; Redhead and Bailey, 2007), this set is often used
to guide the search toward motifs overrepresented in the positive
sequences, rather than discriminating motifs.

In this article, we propose a method that identiﬁes motifs
consisting of speciﬁc amino acids and physico-chemical properties,
that can be used as discriminators to identify new sequences involved
in a biological process of interest. To our knowledge, no motif
discovery method eXists that combines these two features. Our
method outputs the top K motifs that are most frequent in a positive
set of proteins and are absent from a negative set of proteins.

We applied this method to ﬁnd motifs in root-knot nematode
effectors. Root-knot nematodes are the most damaging plant-
parasitic animals to the agriculture worldwide, causing billions of
euro losses every year (Agrios, 1997). They have sophisticated
interactions with plants that include penetration of root tissue and
establishment of a feeding site. A set of effector proteins that are
secreted by the nematode into plant tissue is believed to be crucial
for these processes. Most known effectors to date are expressed in
nematode secretory glands and delivered to plant tissue through a

syringe—like stylet. With the availability of two annotated genome
sequences for root-knot nematodes (Abad et al., 2008; Opperman
et al., 2008), identifying the whole set of candidate secreted
effectors can now be envisioned. Although many effectors possess
a signal peptide for secretion, others clearly present in secretory
glands and/or nematode secretions have no predicted signal peptide
(Bellaﬁore et al., 2008; Jaubert et al., 2002). Similarly, many root-
knot nematode proteins bearing a signal peptide are not delivered to
the plant but have conserved functions in different species. Hence,
the presence of a signal peptide cannot be used as a discriminator to
identify new effectors, and no reliable motif to predict secretion of a
nematode protein in plants is currently available. We constructed a
positive set of proteins known to be secreted by root-knot nematodes
into plant tissue and a negative set of evolutionarily conserved
proteins, in order to identify speciﬁc motifs in positive proteins.
Using these datasets, our method identiﬁed a set of effector-speciﬁc
motifs at the N-terminal region of the positive proteins.

2 METHODS

2.1 Classiﬁcation schemes

Several amino acid classiﬁcations group amino acids according to their
physico-chemical properties. In this work, we consider two classiﬁcation
schemes. The ﬁrst one was proposed by Koolman and Rohm (1996). It
contains seven non-overlapping properties, see Table 1. The second one
is RasMol’s classiﬁcation (Sayle and Milner-White, 1995), which is much
larger, see Table 2. It contains 15 classes,1 with a lot of overlap.

We can View the classiﬁcation schemes as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
representing the superclass relationship. In its simplest way, the DAG
contains two levels: the classes and the amino acids. However, a closer look
at the latter classiﬁcation scheme can introduce more structure and levels.
For instance, all basic amino acids are charged and large, and all charged
amino acids are polar and surface.

2.2 Formal task description

We deﬁne the task of identifying the top K discriminative protein motifs with
amino acid properties as follows:

Given: (i) a set of positive proteins P and a set of negative proteins N, (ii) a
parameter K, and (iii) a set of amino acid properties C and a partial order j
(structured as a DAG) deﬁned on the union of C and the amino acid alphabet
A. For all c1,c2 e CUA: c1 j c2 if and only if there is a directed path from
c1 to c2 in the DAG

Find: the set of K motifs, using symbols in C UA, that are maximally frequent
in P and are absent from (or infrequent in, see Section 2.3.2) N.

 

1We have discarded the classes positive and negative, since they are
equivalent to acidic and basic. We also changed the classiﬁcation of H:
we only classify it as basic, instead of both as basic and neutral.

2.3 Algorithm

The algorithm we propose is based on the well-known candidate generation
principle, introduced in sequential pattern mining by the AprioriAll algorithm
(Agrawal and Srikant, 1995). At each iteration, a set of candidate patterns is
generated, whose frequency is tested. In order to search for discriminative
patterns, we change the basic algorithm, such that it essentially looks for those
patterns that are frequent in the positive sequences, and meanwhile tests if
they are absent from the negative sequences. In order to include physico-
chemical properties of the amino acid residues, we extend the candidate
generation step. In the next sections, we describe the different steps of the
algorithm.

2.3.] Candidate generation In order to perform a complete and efﬁcient
search, it is important that each relevant candidate is generated, and that
no candidate is generated more than once. To achieve this, most candidate
generation algorithms structure the search space as a lattice representing
a general-to-speciﬁc structure. Generating candidates then comes down to
traversing the lattice, thereby pruning as much as possible.

We follow the same approach and consider a pattern <p1, p2, p3, ..., pn>
more general than another pattern <q1,q2,q3, ...,qm>, if and only if n 5m
and for each pair (pl-,qi) it holds that pijqi. Our candidate generation
method traverses the lattice from general to speciﬁc, which is done by
starting with an artiﬁcial root element that denotes the empty pattern,
and at each step performing two basic operations to generate minimally
specialized new candidates given a pattern: (i) add a top-level element of
the DAG (extension), and (ii) minimally specialize an element of the pattern
(specialization).

In order to ensure that no pattern is considered more than once, we only
add elements to the end of the pattern, and only specialize the last element
in the pattern. We transform the DAG into a tree in a preprocessing step,
such that only one path leads to each amino acid. This is trivially fulﬁlled
for the Koolman and Rohm classiﬁcation. A possible spanning tree for the
hierarchy by Sayle and Milner-White is shown in Figure 1. The specialization
operator is performed by replacing the last element in the pattern by each
of its children in this tree. The candidate generation process is illustrated in
Figure 2.

2.3.2 Finding the top K motifs We introduce two parameters, F p and F N,
which denote the minimal frequency threshold for the positive sequences, and
the maximal frequency threshold for the negative sequences, respectively.
By default, F N is set to zero, and motifs are searched that are absent from
the negative set. However, since for some applications, constructing a pure

negative set can be difﬁcult, setting F N to a higher value can be useful. The
parameter F p deﬁnes the threshold above which motifs are retained. Initially,
it is set to one or to a user-deﬁned value, and it increases throughout the
execution of the algorithm:

0 Initially, after ﬁnding K motifs, F p is updated to the minimum of the
frequencies of those K motifs in the positive sequences.

0 In later stages, if a valid motif is found, it is inserted into the current list
of motifs, which is sorted according to their frequency in the positive
sequences. If the ﬁrst K motifs have a frequency higher than F p, then
F p is updated to the minimum of these K frequencies.

It is possible that more than K motifs have a frequency above F p at the end.
In this case, one can either randomly pick motifs with frequency F p until K
motifs are obtained, or one can output all of them. We opted for the latter
approach, so that the user has maximal control over the output.

2.3.3 Candidate pruning and testing In order to conduct the search
efﬁciently, the algorithm exploits the antimonotonicity properties of the
frequency constraints. This results in the following rules (freq(X, Y) returns
the number of proteins in set Y that contain the motif X):

0 If a pattern M has freq(M,P) SFP, then we should not consider new
candidates C that are more speciﬁc than M, since they will have
freq(C, P) 5 F p, and thus can be discarded.

- If a pattern M has freq(M,N) 5 F N, then all new candidates C that are
more speciﬁc than M will have freq(C ,N ) 5 F N, hence we do not need
to count their frequency in the negative set.

When checking a candidate’s frequency in the positive set, we make the
following two observations. First, we only have to check the frequency of
a candidate in case all the candidate’s parents in the lattice have passed the
minimal frequency threshold F p. Secondly, it is not necessary to check the
complete set of positive sequences, it sufﬁces to check the sequences in
which the parents are present. Therefore, we adopt a vertical ID-list dataset
format (Zaki, 1998), where we associate to each pattern a list of (positive)
sequence IDs in which it occurs. Before testing the frequency of a candidate,
we check whether its parents are frequent, and if yes, intersect their sequence
ID lists. Only the sequences in the intersection are checked for the presence
of the pattern. If the pattern passes the minimal frequency constraint, we
store it together with the sequences in which it occurs.

When a candidate has been found frequent in the positive set, we test its
frequency in the negative set. As mentioned above, if a candidate’s parent
was infrequent in the negative set, we can output this candidate as a valid
motif without any testing. In the other case, we iterate over the negatives,
counting hits and stop searching if the maximal frequency F N is reached.
Note that, if the maximal frequency condition is not met, we still have to
keep the candidate for further processing, because the maximal frequency
condition can become true for any of the new candidates generated from it.

2.3.4 Organization of the search The search space lattice can be traversed
using several search strategies, a.o. depth-ﬁrst and breadth-ﬁrst search. We
opt for the former, since it requires less main memory: it only needs to
keep sequence ID lists for candidates along a single path.2 This implies that
pruning (checking whether the parents are frequent and intersecting their
sequence ID lists) cannot be performed using all parents of a candidate.
Therefore, we perform pruning only using the minimal generalizations of
the last element of the pattern as parents (removing the last element if it
corresponds to the highest level in the DAG).

In order to perform pruning correctly, we have to make sure that all
considered parents have been tested before a pattern is tested, i.e. the
spanning tree of the amino acids and their properties has to be constructed
in a way that, in depth-ﬁrst traversal, all DAG parents of a node are Visited
before the node itself. The tree shown in Figure 1 fulﬁlls this constraint.

2.3.5 Implementation We provide a Perl implementation of the
proposed algorithm, called MERCI (Motif—EmeRging and with Classes—
Identiﬁcation), at http://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/ml/systems/merci. Pseudo code
is given in Supplementary Table S1. Counting frequencies is done by Perl’s
pattern matching operator, using regular expressions to represent classes.
The implementation provides the following additional features:

0 The user is not restricted to use one of the classiﬁcations discussed here,
but can deﬁne his own classiﬁcation scheme of amino acid properties.

0 There is an option to ﬁnd gapped motifs. The algorithm is easily
extended to include gaps by splitting the extension operator into two
basic operations: (i) add a top-level candidate to the end of the pattern,
and (ii) add a gap followed by a top-level candidate to the end of the
pattern. The program supports gaps of variable length, i.e. the user
provides a maximal gap length L, and a gap symbol then denotes any
number of amino acids between 0 and L. The maximal number of gap
symbols is also set by the user.

0 The program includes a searching tool, which can be used to locate the
discovered motifs’ occurrences in any set of sequences.

2.4 Meloidogyne incognita dataset

We ﬁrst describe how the positive and negative protein sets were constructed.
Statistics about the resulting sets are given in Table 3. Then we explain how
the resulting motifs are evaluated.

2.4.1 Positive set We constructed a positive set with proteins that are
known to be secreted or likely to be secreted by the nematode into plant
root tissue (Bellaﬁore et al., 2008; Ding et al., 2000; Dubreuil et al., 2007;
Huang et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2007). The data consists of 59 proteins
whose expression in subventral and/or dorsal secretory glands has been
shown, 38 proteins that have been identiﬁed in the secretome of root-knot
nematodes, and 3 translated EST contigs identiﬁed by mass spectrometry in
nematode secretions. The resulting 100 sequences were scanned with SignalP
3.0 (Emanuelsson et al., 2007) for the presence of a potential signal peptide.
The criterion used was detection of a signal peptide with either one of the two

 

2The number of motifs that are frequent in the positive set can be very
large, especially when using amino acid properties. Therefore, memory
requirements can be an issue in breadth-ﬁrst search.

methods (artiﬁcial neural networks or hidden Markov models) integrated in
SignalP. In total, 57 sequences have a predicted signal peptide.

2.4.2 Negative set As negative set, we used a series of proteins encoded by
single-copy genes widely conserved throughout evolution. Such proteins are
very unlikely to be secreted by plant-parasitic nematodes in plants as they
are highly conserved in non-parasitic species. To identify these proteins,
we ran an all versus all comparison of seven proteomes (M.incognita,
M.hapla, Brugia malayi, Pristionchus paciﬁcus, Caenorhabditis elegans,
Caenorhabditis briggsae, and Drosophila melanogaster) using OrthoMCL
(Li et al., 2003). We identiﬁed 459 groups of conserved proteins present
as a single copy in all of the seven different proteomes. We retrieved the
corresponding proteins in M.incognita and checked for the presence of a
signal peptide using SignalP. We found that 43 out of these 459 proteins
bear a predicted signal peptide. Presence of proteins with a signal peptide in
the negative set avoids biasing for motifs indicating the presence of a signal
peptide.

2.4.3 Evaluating motifs The identiﬁed motifs were scanned against the
proteome of M. incognita (Abad et al., 2008), consisting of 20 359 proteins.
Moreover, the genome of M. incognita is known to encode a repertoire of plant
cell wall-degrading proteins. Among these proteins, cellulases (Béra—Maillet
et al., 2000; Ledger et al., 2006; Rosso et al., 1999), xylanases (Mitreva—
Dautova et al., 2006), polygalacturonases (J aubert et al., 2002) and pectate
lyases (Huang et al., 2005) have been shown to be expressed in M. incognita
secretory glands. A total of 16 full-length proteins bearing a signal peptide
and corresponding to these cell wall-degrading enzymes were identiﬁed from
the genome annotation and from the literature. Half of them were initially
included in the positive set, the rest can be used as a positive control.

3 DISCUSSION

3.1 Finding proteins secreted into plant tissues by
M.incognita

Using the datasets described in Section 2.4, we have identiﬁed motifs
that are speciﬁc to the positive proteins, i.e. we searched for motifs
that are absent from the negative set by setting F N to zero.3

In a ﬁrst set of experiments, we searched for the top ﬁve motifs,
without considering physico-chemical properties. Disabling the use
of gaps resulted in the motifs shown in Table 4 (top). We can make
two observations from this result. First, the result contains more than
ﬁve motifs, since there are multiple motifs with the cut-off frequency
of 5 (see Section 2.3.2). Secondly, we notice several motifs that are
very similar. More precisely, motif <TLLIIS> is present together
with its two parent motifs <TLLII> and <LLIIS>, the latter
being the most frequent motif in the result. Many pattern discovery
algorithms restrict their output to a set of closed patterns, i.e. patterns
that do not have any specializations with the same frequency, and

would thus discard <TLLII>. Instead, in this work we output the
complete set of top K motifs. The reason is that our motifs can
be used as discriminators to identify unknown positive sequences.
Depending on the application, one might be more interested in
maximizing precision (the proportion of positive predictions that
are correct), in which case one would prefer to use the most speciﬁc
motifs, or in maximizing recall (also called sensitivity, the proportion
of positive sequences that are correctly predicted), in which case one
would use the most general motifs.

When enabling the use of a gap position (see Table 4, middle),
with a maximal gap length of 5, we see that the <LLIIS> motif,
which was the most frequent pattern in the previous experiment,
can be extended to the left and to the right without decreasing the
frequency. Note that the F p threshold has changed from 5 to 7.

In a second set of experiments, we allowed physico-chemical
properties in the motifs, starting with the simple Koolman and Rohm
(1996) classiﬁcation. Table 4 (lower part) shows the results, only the
results without gaps are shown. Again, we see the <LLIIS> motif,
this time together with a number of degenerate variants.

Closer inspection of the <LLIIS> motif and its variants showed
that they always occur near the start of the protein sequences. This
is consistent with most reported cases in the literature, which state
that the signals that control compartment of destination of proteins
are often positioned at their N—terminal region. Therefore, in the
next experiment, we searched for motifs speciﬁcally in this region.
We only considered the 30 ﬁrst positions in this analysis, both
for positive and negative sequences. As motifs controlling protein
localization are usually short, we set a maximal motif length of
15, and disabled gaps. Without classiﬁcation, the motif with the
maximal frequency is <LIIS> (note the slight difference with the
previous <LLIIS>), which occurs in 10 positive sequences. When
using the more complex RasMol (Sayle and Milner—White, 1995)
classiﬁcation, the maximal motif frequency obtained is 38 (see
Table 5 for an example). When reporting the top 100 motifs, 97
motifs have a frequency of at least 35, with a total coverage of 68
positive proteins. Taking a closer look at the coverage, we observed

several things. First, some sequences are covered by almost all
motifs, meaning that there is a lot of overlap between the motifs.
Secondly, we see that the identiﬁed motifs are preferentially found
in positive proteins bearing a signal peptide (SP). Since SPs are
present in the negative set, and none of the negatives is covered,
these motifs do not indicate the SP itself, but a pattern within the SP
that is probably related to secretion in plants. We, therefore, focused
our analysis on the subset of motifs that cover as many as possible of
the 57 SP-bearing positive proteins and none of the non-SP-bearing
positives. This subset still contains 66 motifs, covering all but one
of the SP-bearing positives. To reduce this number, we applied a
heuristic set covering algorithm4 to ﬁnd a small subset of motifs
with the same coverage as the 66 motifs. This procedure resulted in
a subset of four motifs, shown in Table 5.

Scanning the complete proteome of M. incognita, we found that
the 4 motifs cover 2579 proteins (12% of the genome). A total of
2073 of these proteins (80.3%) are predicted to have an SP, while
only 17% (3487 out of 20359) of the M. incognita proteins have a
predicted SP. Interestingly, if we only consider the proteins that are
covered by at least 2 motifs, then 1106 out of 1162 (95%) have an
SP. The 4 motifs cover 7 out of the 8 cell wall-degrading proteins
from the evaluation set. Additionally, using the OrthoMCL analysis
performed to construct the set of negatives (see Section 2.4.2), we
noticed that 1817 of the 2579 proteins are parasite speciﬁc, i.e. they
do not have orthologs in C.elegans, C.briggsae, D.melan0gaster
and Ppaciﬁcus. Given that the complete proteome contains 12 234
such proteins, the identiﬁcation of this subset forms an important
contribution to the pipeline of experiments necessary to identify the
whole set of candidate effectors. It also introduces the open question
of how these motifs in the signal peptide regulate secretion in plants.

3.2 Related work

A large body of literature in the area of motif discovery exists. Here,
we focus on systems that learn discriminative and/or degenerate
motifs among biological or other sequences.

A lot of research has been carried out in frequent or discriminative
substring mining. Most string mining approaches make use of
efﬁcient data structures to represent the string dataset (Fischer et al.,
2006; Weese and Schulz, 2008) and avoid the candidate generation
approach. However, these techniques are limited to ﬁnding motifs

 

4Initially none of the sequences is covered, and we iteratively add a motif
with maximal score, until the maximal coverage is obtained. The score of
a motif is deﬁned as the sum of the sequence scores of the not-yet—covered
sequences it covers, where each sequence is scored by the inverse of the
number of motifs present in the sequence. This ensures that sequences that
are covered by few motifs have a high score. In case of multiple motifs with
the highest score, the one with the shortest length is taken.

deﬁned over the same alphabet as the sequences. Some form
of degenerate motifs can be obtained by searching for so-called
approximate frequent motifs (J i and Bailey, 2007; Zhu et al. , 2007),
meaning that some mismatches are allowed when counting the
frequency of a motif.

In the area of mining frequent sequential patterns, often used
in marketing applications where patterns are searched in ordered
lists of transactions, an algorithm is proposed that can integrate
user-deﬁned taxonomies in the patterns. GSP (Srikant and Agrawal,
1996) is a candidate generation algorithm, where candidates are
generated by joining frequent sequences of the previous level,
pruning away sequences that have a non-frequent subsequence. In
order to incorporate taxonomies, each data sequence is replaced
by an extended sequence, by adding all ancestor items to each
transaction. It does not exploit the generalization structure inherent
to the search space and does not ﬁnd discriminative patterns.

Two other pattern discovery approaches allow the user to provide
sets of amino acids, which are considered equivalent. However, they
do not search for discriminative motifs. Teiresias (Rigoutsos and
Floratos, 1998) uses a convolution technique to generate new motifs
from two smaller motifs. It returns the set of closed patterns that
are frequent in a (positive) set of sequences. The amino acid sets
are introduced without any modiﬁcation to the algorithm, i.e. no
generalization relation is exploited. The Pratt algorithm (Jonassen,
1997) uses the concept of a pattern graph to guide the search, and
uses a mix of specialization and generalization operators to generate
candidates. In a ﬁrst stage, it searches motifs consisting of speciﬁc
amino acids, and in an optional reﬁnement stage, these motifs are
made more general by replacing amino acids by the amino acid sets.
However, it can operate in an exhaustive manner as well.

Another set of related systems is based on probabilistic models.
These systems return the discovered motifs as position-speciﬁc
weight matrices, which specify a score for each residue/position
pair. This results in degenerate motifs by enumerating possible
alternative residues for each position, in contrast to describing
possible alternatives, as in our approach. The enumeration does
not take into account any classiﬁcation. Example systems that ﬁnd
discriminative motifs are DEME (Redhead and Bailey, 2007), which
uses a combination of global and local search to ﬁnd a single best
motif, and the widely used MEME software (Bailey and Elkan,
1994), which uses an expectation maximization algorithm, and
was recently extended to incorporate negative sequences as input
(Bailey et al., 2010). However, these algorithms ﬁnd motifs that are
overrepresented in the positive and underrepresented in the negative
set; it is not possible to require total absence from the negatives.

Finally, we mention two logic-based methods. Warmr (King et al. ,
2001) is an inductive logic programming system searching frequent
patterns. It can take background knowledge as input, that could

be used to represent the DAG. However, the system does not ﬁnd
discriminative patterns and, since it was not speciﬁcally designed
for sequences, requires complex data formatting and language bias
descriptions from the user. MineSeqlog (Lee and De Raedt, 2004)
is a system for mining discriminative logical sequences. It ﬁnds
motifs by applying a frequent subsequence mining algorithm twice:
once to ﬁnd the set of most speciﬁc patterns that are frequent in the
positive sequences, and once to ﬁnd the most speciﬁc patterns that
are frequent in the negative sequences. The resulting patterns are
those that are more general than the former set and more speciﬁc
than the latter set. The double application of the frequent pattern
miner results in a less efﬁcient approach.

3.3 Comparison

We have compared the output of MERCI to four methods from the
related work section, that also output degenerate motifs. We applied
each method to identify motifs corresponding as much as possible
to a common setup: we used the amino acid properties based on
the Koolman and Rohm (1996) classiﬁcation, allowed at the most
1 gap of maximal length 2, requiring a minimal occurrence in the
positives of 10% and absence from the negative set. We looked
for the 10 best motifs with these constraints. Parameters that are not
discussed were left to their default value. The systems MERCI, Pratt
and DEME were installed and run locally, thus we can also compare
their running times (run on an Intel Q9400 2.66 GHz processor).

3.3.] MERCI Using MERCI with the above settings, we found
three motifs, see Table 6. These are the only motifs (with a single
gap) that occur in at least 10 positive sequences, and do not occur
in any negatives, and hence can be used as a reference. The running
time of MERCI was 119 s.

3.3.2 Teiresias As Teiresias cannot take a negative set as input,
we only used the positive sequences. The maximum gap length of
2 was simulated by setting parameters L=2 and W=4. We used
the seq version, and applied equivalence-based pattern discovery,
with the equivalence sets based on the (Koolman and Rohm, 1996)
classiﬁcation. Even though Teiresias only reports closed patterns,
the result set contains 328 135 motifs. Many of the reported motifs
are overly general, e.g. <aliphatic x(1) x(1) aliphatic> (where x(1)
denotes a ﬁxed gap of one position), which not only occurs in all
positive sequences, but also in all negative sequences. Calculating a
signiﬁcance score could not be performed within the execution time
limit that comes with the web version of Teiresias. Surprisingly, the
three motifs found by MERCI are not in Teiresias’s output list. The
reason is that MERCI uses variable length gaps, while Teiresias does
not. For instance, the second MERCI motif occurs three times with
a gap length of 0, ﬁve times with a gap length of 1 and two times
with a gap length of 2. Thus, Teiresias would need three motifs to

<L L aliph x(1) neutr aliph aliph x(0,2) aliph x(1) neutr E> 10
<L aliph aliph aliph x(1) aliph I x(0,2) aliph x(1) neutr E> 10

 

FFFFF‘.

represent this motif, and these motifs would have a frequency of 3,
5 and 2.

3.3.3 Pratt Pratt also has a single input set of proteins. We set the
maximal gap length to 2 and allowed a single variable length gap.
We required Pratt to perform exhaustive search, in order to maximize
the output similarity to MERCI, which also performs an exhaustive
search. Pratt scores patterns based on the information content. We
considered the 10 best patterns, and counted their frequency in the
negative sequences. Only half of the patterns are absent from the
negative sequences, they are shown in Table 7, and are very similar
to the patterns found by MERCI. The reason why there are more
patterns and they have a larger frequency is that Pratt also introduces
ﬁxed length gaps, e.g. x(2), and their number cannot be restricted
by the user. The running time required by Pratt was 2566 s, which
is more than 20 times slower than MERCI.

3.3.4 MEME The web version of the MEME software does allow
to give a negative sequence set as input. However, in contrast to the
previous systems, MEME neither does allow the use of a speciﬁc
classiﬁcation scheme nor does it use gaps. We used the zoops (zero
or one per sequence) motif distribution, set the motif width between
2 and 50 and let MEME search for 10 motifs. In the result, three
motifs have an E-Value less than 1. The top scoring motif is very
similar to our LLIIS-type motifs. The corresponding motif logo
is shown in Figure 3. This motif was input to the corresponding
motif occurrence locator program FIMO to search for occurrences
in both positive and negative sequence sets. Using the default
signiﬁcance threshold, the motif was found in 32 positive sequences
and also in 36 negative sequences. We conclude that, while MEME
allows negative sequences, it should not be used to search for
discriminating motifs. In fact, MEME and MERCI have different
target applications. While MERCI searches for motifs that can be
used directly as a discriminator when classifying new sequences,
MEME searches for motifs that describe a set of sequences. For
instance, if the application is to ﬁnd motifs shared by orthologous
proteins, then it can help to include a negative set to guide the search

toward signiﬁcant motifs, while it is allowed that some negative
sequences also contain the motif.

3.3.5 DEME DEME reports a single motif, with a width given
by the user. Again, gaps are not supported, and no classiﬁcation
scheme can be speciﬁed. We have searched for a motif of length
6, 8 and 10, respectively. The consensus sequences, together with
their frequencies [as calculated by applying a threshold of 0.5 on the
resulting probabilities, see Redhead and Bailey (2007)], are given in
Table 8. The running times required to obtain these motifs were 972,
1032 and 1069 s, respectively, resulting in a total running time that is
25 times as high as MERCI’s running time. DEME ﬁnds motifs that
are highly frequent in the positive set, and infrequent in the negative
set, and therefore gives more useful results for our task than MEME.
However, the motifs are still present in the negative sequences, and
we believe the ﬁxed motif width is an important drawback.

4 CONCLUSION

We propose an algorithm for the de novo identiﬁcation of protein
motifs speciﬁc to a set of proteins. The motifs are not restricted to a
sequence of speciﬁc amino acids, but can involve physico-chemical
amino acid properties. The algorithm combines a variety of existing
and new algorithmic contributions into a practical tool, that is freely
available, and is able to include user-deﬁned amino acid properties.
We provide additional software to scan sequence databases for the
occurrence of the identiﬁed motifs. To our knowledge, no method
is currently available to identify discriminative motifs that are
degenerated according to a classiﬁcation scheme.

Our tool was used to discover motifs speciﬁc to root-knot
nematode proteins that are secreted into plant tissues. We showed
that by allowing properties in the motifs, we are able to ﬁnd motifs
with a higher frequency in a positive set of proteins, while still being
absent from a negative set. Using a set of four identiﬁed motifs as
discriminators, we detected a total of 2579 proteins in the proteome
of M. incognita that can be considered as new putative effectors.

We have compared the motifs discovered by our tool to the result
of four other tools that ﬁnd degenerate motifs. We conclude that our
tool is the only one that ﬁnds a set of motifs using predeﬁned amino
acid classes, that is completely absent from the negative set.

While we have focused on ﬁnding protein motifs, the tool can
be used on any kind of sequence dataset, with any kind of research
question for which a positive and negative set can be deﬁned.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: An effective docking algorithm for antibody—protein anti-
gen complex prediction is an important first step toward design of
biologics and vaccines. We have recently developed a new class of
knowledge-based interaction potentials called Decoys as the
Reference State (DARS) and incorporated DARS into the docking pro-
gram PIPER based on the fast Fourier transform correlation approach.
Although PIPER was the best performer in the latest rounds of the
CAPRI protein docking experiment, it is much less accurate for dock-
ing antibody—protein antigen pairs than other types of complexes, in
spite of incorporating sequence-based information on the location of
the paratope. Analysis of antibody—protein antigen complexes has re-
vealed an inherent asymmetry within these interfaces. Specifically,
phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine residues highly populate the
paratope of the antibody but not the epitope of the antigen.

Results: Since this asymmetry cannot be adequately modeled using a
symmetric pairwise potential, we have removed the usual assumption
of symmetry. Interaction statistics were extracted from antibody—pro-
tein complexes under the assumption that a particular atom on the
antibody is different from the same atom on the antigen protein.
The use of the new potential significantly improves the performance
of docking for antibody—protein antigen complexes, even without any
sequence information on the location of the paratope. We note that the
asymmetric potential captures the effects of the multi-body inter-
actions inherent to the complex environment in the antibody—protein
antigen interface.

Availability: The method is implemented in the ClusPro protein dock-
ing server, available at http://cluspro.bu.edu.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein docking methods have signiﬁcantly improved in
the last few years. According to the last round of the blind pro-
tein docking experiment CAPRI (Lensink and Wodak, 2010),
automated protein docking servers performed comparably well

with the top human predictor groups, without the use of biolo-
gical information. In particular, our protein docking server
ClusPro was the top protein docking server, as well as within
the top 10 of all predictors. Despite these improvements, the
docking of an antibody to its protein antigen, an important
ﬁrst step toward computational design of biologics and vaccines,
remains particularly challenging for both ClusPro and other
methods (Ponomarenko and Bourne, 2007; Vajda, 2005). We
note that although we focus on interactions between antibodies
and proteins, for simplicity we deﬁne the problem as antibody—
antigen docking. It is no doubt that the relatively weak perform-
ance represents the state of art in protein docking. In fact,
Ponomarenko and Bourne (2007) found ClusPro to better pre-
dict epitopes than methods that have been speciﬁcally developed
for such predictions, although they used an earlier and less ac-
curate version of the server. It is easy to see why docking anti-
gen—antibody pairs is much more difﬁcult than docking
inhibitors to enzymes. Enzyme—inhibitor complexes generally ex-
hibit excellent surface complementarity, with the convex inhibi-
tor matching the concave binding site of the enzyme (Vajda,
2005). Most of the native enzyme—inhibitor interfaces also have
favorable hydrophobic and polar interactions, which facilitate
docking and scoring (Vajda, 2005). In contrast, the interfaces
in antibody—antigen complexes are mostly ﬂat and less hydro-
phobic (Lo Conte et al., 1999). The ﬂat interface implies that
searching for surface complementarity provides little help in
docking. In addition, the polar interactions are more sensitive
to atomic positions than the hydrophobic ones, and hence scor-
ing based on molecular mechanics energy functions including
electrostatics becomes less reliable due to the inevitable conform-
ational differences between free and bound protein structures.
Thus, it is very important to develop scoring functions that ac-
count for these speciﬁc properties of the interface and can help
ﬁnding near-native complex structures.

It was shown by several groups that the inclusion of
structure-based potentials in the energy function used for the
docking can signiﬁcantly improve performance (Chen et al.,
2003; Kozakov et al., 2006; RaVikant and Elber, 2010). Here,
we describe the development and testing of an accurate pairwise
interaction potential speciﬁc to antibody—antigen complexes.
Based on statistical mechanics, structure-based potentials are
traditionally derived from the “inverse Boltzmann’ principle
(Sippl, 1993), assuming that frequently observed structural
states are low energy states. In the ﬁrst-order approximation,

where k is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, p21,” the
probability of interactions between atoms of types I and J in an
observed set (e.g. crystal structures) and pff is the probability of
atoms of types I and J being within the interaction distance, in a
state without any atom-type-speciﬁc interactions, the “reference
state’. We have recently reported a pairwise interaction potential
called Decoys as the Reference State (DARS) (Chuang et al.,
2008). The idea of DARS is generating a large set of docked
conformations with good shape complementarity but without
accounting for atom types, and using the frequency of inter-
actions extracted from these DARS. In principle, the resulting
potential is ideal for ﬁnding near-native conformations among
structures obtained by docking and can be combined with other
energy terms to be used directly in docking calculations.
Accordingly, we incorporated DARS into the energy function
used by our docking program PIPER (Kozakov et al., 2006).
Based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) correlation approach,
PIPER can perform global docking of unbound protein struc-
tures without any a priori information on the structure of the
complex and was the best performing method in the latest round
of the CAPRI protein docking experiment (Lensink and Wodak,
2010). DARS improved the docking results for all classes of
complexes. For enzyme—inhibitor pairs, DARS provides both
excellent discrimination and docking results, even with very
small decoy sets. With a few exceptions, the DARS docking re-
sults are also good for complexes that occur in signal transduc-
tion pathways. However, for antibody—antigen pairs, results were
substantially worse than for other types of complexes, although
DARS performed slightly better than some earlier interaction
potentials. The results were poor even when the location of the
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) on the antibody
was determined based on sequence information and the search
was constrained to include the CDRs in the interface.

Analyzing the potential sources of poor performance for anti-
body—antigen pairs, we arrived at the conclusions that the main
problem is the inherent asymmetry of the interface in these types
of complexes (Chuang et al., 2008). We recall that the pairwise
structure-based potentials to model protein—protein interactions
automatically assume the symmetry of interactions between
atoms on the two sides of the interface, i.e. that

SII‘CCJlig : 8Jrecllig9

where Irec, Jrec are atom types on the receptor and 111g, Jug are
atom types on the ligand. However, it is easy to show that the
assumption of symmetry limits the performance of the potential
in antibody—antigen docking. As shown in Figure 1, there is
usually a large, hydrophobic region on the paratope of the anti-
body, containing a large number of tyrosines, tryptophans and
phenylalanines, thus these three residues occur with high fre-
quency in the interface. This is supported by residue interaction
statistics gathered on the antibody—protein interaction dataset, as
shown in Supplementary Table Sl. Based on these statistics,

 

Fig. 1. Patches of maximum hydrophobicity in an antibody—antigen
complex. The structure is Jel42 Fab fragment complexed with HPr
(PDB code 2jel). The antibody fragment is shown as the white solid
model, with magenta patches representing the regions with maximum
hydrophobicity. The HPr antigen is shown as a gray cartoon, with
dark red patches as regions of maximum hydrophobicity. In the ﬁgure,
the antibody CDR is oriented upward, showing that the CDR region
includes strongly hydrophobic patches, but these do not interact with
regions of maximum hydrophobicity on the HPr antigen

interactions between the atoms of these residues and any other
atom on the other side of the interface appear to be favorable,
resulting in a large negative pairwise energy term. Addition of
this term will improve the location of the interface and thus the
near-native conformation if these residues are on the paratope of
the antibody. However, the tyrosines, tryptophans and phenyl-
alanines on the antigen side are not found in the epitope with any
higher frequency than on any other part of the protein. Thus, a
favorable interaction term for these residues on the antigen leads
to false positives, incorrectly predicting that any region of the
antigen rich in these residues is likely to be part of the epitope,
which is generally not the case.

The concept of symmetry is generally accepted for pairwise
potentials because interaction forces between two isolated
atoms or molecules are symmetric. Most structure-based poten-
tials have been derived from folded protein structures (Lu and
Skolnick, 2001; Miyazawa and Jernigan, 1985; Rojnuckarin and
Subramaniam, 1999; Skolnick et al., 1997) where the symmetric
pairwise assumption, ignoring multi-body interaction terms, was
the natural ﬁrst choice. These potentials proved to be successful
for folding and, later on, for docking, so the assumption of sym-
metry has not been questioned. As discussed, antibody—antigen
interactions clearly do not ﬁt this framework. Although the de-
viation from symmetry may be surprising, it is important to note
that interactions between atoms are not pairwise, and the latter
assumption is just a convenient approximation. Thus, the

pairwise energy terms, extracted from the frequency of speciﬁc
interactions observed in protein structures or complexes, repre-
sent an empirical measure of interaction strength rather than real
physical forces. Developing multi-body interaction potentials
would be a more rigorous approach than restricting consider-
ation to pairwise interaction, but we have far from enough
data for the parameterization of such potentials.

Here, we suggest an alternative approach, simply removing the
requirement of interaction symmetry. The resulting potential pre-
serves the general form and computational simplicity of statis-
tical potentials, but to a certain degree accounts for the local
environment of an atom and thus introduces some elements of
multi-body potentials. To our knowledge, no asymmetric poten-
tials have been previously reported for predicting protein—protein
interactions. We describe the development of the asymmetric
DARS-type potential, called ADARS, based on a non-
redundant dataset of antibody—antigen complexes extracted
from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). ADARS has been integrated
into the energy function used in the docking program PIPER,
and tested on an antibody—antigen docking benchmark. We
demonstrate signiﬁcant improvements in the docking results,
when compared with earlier symmetric potentials. The resulting
antibody—antigen docking protocol is included in our ClusPro
protein docking server, which is freely available.

2 METHODS
2.1 Potential development

2.1.] Selection of non-redundant antibody—antigen dataset A
DARS potential requires deﬁning the native training set and the reference
set from which to extract the atom-type contacts. For training our ori-
ginal DARS potential, we used the non-redundant database of native
protein—protein complexes from Glaser et al. (2001). This set includes
621 protein interfaces from 492 PDB entries. As previously noted
(Chuang et al., 2008), the set was biased toward homodimers and
enzyme—inhibitor complexes that tend to have excellent pairing of hydro-
phobic regions on the two sides of the interface, which is not the case in
antibody—antigen interactions.

For the antibody—antigen-speciﬁc DARS, we have extracted all the
records containing antibodies from the PDB that were solved by either
X-ray crystallography (with resolution up to 4A) or nuclear magnetic
resonance. After removing unbound antibody structures, we ended up
with 199 antibody—protein complexes. We assign the antibody chains as
the receptor. We clustered all the ligands with over 30% sequence iden-
tity. The resulting clusters were manually inspected for redundancy in
terms of different binding modes [>9 A ligand root mean square deviation
(RMSD)] or different antibody sequence (>30% sequence difference at
the interface). We have also retained some antibody—antibody complexes,
such as anti-idiotype complexes, which mimic antibody—antigen com-
plexes. We then removed from our training set all complexes in the pro-
tein—protein docking benchmark (Hwang et al., 2008) set and the ones
similar to them, based on redundancy criteria described above. What
remained was a set of 99 non-redundant complexes, a training set appro-
priate for our purpose. All heteroatoms and water molecules were
removed prior to analysis. The ﬁnal list of complexes is provided as
Supplementary Material (Table S2).

2.1.2 Atom-type selection Such a small training set provides lim-
ited statistics of interactions between atoms on the two sides of the inter-
face. In order to avoid an underdetermined statistical problem when
estimating the atom pair interactions energies, we reduced the number

of atom types. As already mentioned, hydrophobicity is major driving
force in antibody/antigen interactions, and tyrosine, tryptophan and
phenylalanine occur with high frequency in the paratope (Halperin
et al., 2002); hence, from the 18 atom types of DARS, we selected
FC5, YC§ and LC‘3 that represent the atom types mainly involved in
these interactions. As deﬁned by Zhang et al. (1997), FC§ includes all
the ring carbon atoms in Phe and Trp, as well as the three proximal
phenolic ring atoms in Tyr (CV, C‘31 and C52). YC§ denotes the three
distal phenolic ring atoms in Tyr that appear to be inﬂuenced by the
terminal hydroxyl group and thus need to be treated separately. The
terminal carbon atoms in Ile, Leu, Met and Val constitute the third
group, LC‘S. All other atoms are placed into a single ‘other’ atom type.
Using just four types ensures that all training data bins will be well
populated. The choice of atom types is based on our understanding of
antibody—antigen interactions and the statistics of interactions observed
in the training set (shown in Supplementary Tables S1 and S3). Although
the decision is supported by the results described below—it is by no
means optimized. For example, it was observed that there is high fre-
quency of Ser on antibody interfaces (Clark et al., 2006). Thus, adding
speciﬁc serine atom types would be a natural choice once more antibody—
antigen complexes are available for constructing the potential.

2.1.3 Reference set The main feature of DARS is the selection of a
set of complexes as the reference set. From each of these, a set of docked
structures is generated, using shape complementarity as the docking
energy function. For our reference set, we have randomly selected 15 of
these 100 antibody—antigen complexes. During docking, only the Fv
region of the antibody (antigen-binding fragment of the antibody that
includes variable domains of the heavy and light chains) is considered.
For each complex, we use the van der Waals energy function of PIPER to
generate 5000 shape complementarity decoys. (PIPER is described in
more detail below.) We then determined the reference state probability
based on the frequencies of atom—atom interactions in the decoy set
(Chuang et al., 2008):

where vﬁﬁf is the number of contacts between atoms of types I on the

receptor and J on the ligand in the decoy ensemble. The other properties
of the antibody—antigen-speciﬁc DARS, the contact cutoff distance and
the atom-type deﬁnitions, were chosen identically to the original DARS.
For the contact cutoff distance, atom i of the receptor (the antibody) is
considered to interact with atom j of the ligand (the antigen) if their
distance rij is <6 A.

2.1.4 Description of the potentials compared To better illustrate
the effect of introducing asymmetry to pairwise potential, and the role of
antibody—antigen-speciﬁc training data, we have compared three poten-
tials in this article. The ﬁrst is the previously developed general DARS
(Chuang et al., 2008). The second potential, symmetric antibody—antigen
DARS (aDARS), uses four atom types (YCg, F C; , LC‘3 and ‘other’) and
is trained on the antibody—antigen training set, but retains the symmetry
constraint 8]] = 8 J]. Finally, the symmetry constraint is removed in the
antibody—antigen-speciﬁc asymmetric DARS (aADARS), and thus we
effectively have four antibody atom types (antibody YCg, FC5, LC;
and ‘other’), interacting with four antigen atom types (antigen
YCQ FC5, LC; and ‘other’).

2.2 Antibody—antigen docking benchmark

To test our antibody—antigen—speciﬁc DARS potential, we use the anti-
body—antigen complexes from protein—protein docking benchmark
(Hwang et al., 2008). Some complexes were excluded as follows.
The complex 2hmi was removed because the bound complex contains

DNA. The complex 1e4k was removed because it is not an antibody—anti-
gen complex: the ‘antigen’ is actually an Fc receptor, binding the Fc
region of the antibody. Finally, three complexes (1i9r, 1k4c and 2vis)
were removed as they are complexes of antigen multimers with multiple
antibodies, and thus beyond the scope of pairwise docking considered in
this article. The remaining 20 cases were used as our test set. As noted
above, we have removed all complexes of this benchmark from our train-
ing set to prevent biasing our results.

2.3 Docking

For docking, we used our previously developed protein—protein docking
program PIPER (Kozakov et al., 2006). PIPER is an FFT-based docking
program that uses a structure-based pairwise potential as one component
of its energy function. The total energy is the sum of terms representing
shape complementarity, electrostatic and desolvation contributions, the
last described by the pairwise potential (Kozakov et al., 2006; Chuang
et al., 2008):

where N, and N; denote the numbers of atoms in the receptor and the
ligand, respectively. The Evdw term is a stepwise implementation of the
van der Waals energy, with Eam and Erep representing its attractive and
repulsive components, respectively. Eelec is the Coulombic electrostatic
energy and Epair denotes the pairwise potential described above. ego-MU)
is the potential energy between two atoms of types I = a(i) and J = a(j).
That is, a(x) is the atom-type mapping of atom number x. rij is the dis-
tance between atom i and j in the protein. D = max,(r}’dw), where rde is
Van der Waals radii of atom i. PIPER (Kozakov et al., 2006) is able to
incorporate symmetric pairwise potentials within its energy function.
Approximating the interaction matrix by its eigenvectors corresponding
to the few dominant eigenvalues results in an energy expression written as
the sum of a few correlation functions, which can be solved by repeated
FFT calculations. Unfortunately, it is not possible to perform eigenvalue
decomposition of the N X N asymmetric matrix Masym. However, we can
create an equivalent symmetric potential of the size 2N X 2N as shown
below. In this representation, the ﬁrst N types correspond to the atoms of
the antibody, and the subsequent N to the atoms of the antigen. It is
easily seen that the interaction energy from the asymmetric matrix is
equivalent to the proposed symmetric form. This makes it possible to
use ADARS within PIPER.

0 Masym
 o 1

The translational space of the receptor and ligand energy functions is
sampled at a step size of 1.0A and the rotational space is sampled ap-
proximately every 5°, resulting in 70000 rotations of the ligand. To pre-
vent bias of the grid placement, each structure is randomly rotated and
translated prior to docking.

For each complex, the best scoring 1000 structures are clustered
(Kozakov et al., 2005) to produce a number of predictions. We also
tested the potentials in conjunction with the commonly used method of
‘masking’ the non-CDR (i.e. not CDR) parts of the antibody. This ef-
fectively limits the docking results to complexes in which the interface
includes the CDRs. The residues to mask were determined by Kabat’s
deﬁnition of the CDR (see http://www.bioinf.org.uk/abs/), with three
additional residues in each direction remaining unmasked (Kozakov

et al., 2006; Chuang et al., 2008).The weighting coefﬁcients W1, W2, W3
are selected based on calorimetric considerations (Chuang et al., 2008).
The W4 coefﬁcient in the energy expression is optimally selected for the
particular potential, and hence is different for DARS, aADARS and
aDARS (Chuang et al., 2008).

2.4 Assessment of the results

For result assessment, we consider the model a hit if ligand atoms within
10 A of the receptor in the crystal are within 10 A RMSD in the model (to
ignore the motion of that part of the ligand which is not participating in
the interaction). Although 10A RMSD may appear to be very large, one
has to keep in mind that the prime aim of the FFT sampling and clus-
tering steps is to determine the region of interest in the conformational
space, and the structures in this region can be further reﬁned by methods
that account at least for side chain and possibly for some backbone
ﬂexibility. In a recent paper describing our results in the CAPRI experi-
ment (Kozakov et al., 2010), we showed that such models can indeed be
further reﬁned to obtain structures of high quality.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 ADARS potential

The antibody—aADARS potential is shown in Table 1. The
strongest signal in this potential is from the antibody YC‘; type
(i.e. the distal ring atoms of Tyr), interacting atom types
FC4, LC‘3 and other on the antigen. This shows that it is ener-
getically favorable for the YC‘; type to be in the paratope regard-
less of what is in the epitope. The only interaction of YC‘; atoms
that are not very favorable are with another atom of the same
type. Also strong is the F Cé—FCé interaction between Tyr rings.
The strongest repulsive potentials are coming from the antibody
hydrophobic LC‘S atoms interacting with almost any of the anti-
gen atoms. Thus, the potential illustrates that the somewhat
hydrophobic YC‘; atoms of Tyr and the more hydrophobic
FC‘; atoms of Phe, Trp and Tyr have a high probability of
being at the antibody interface regardless of the residues at the
antigen interface, in good agreement with the high frequency of
these residues in the CDR regions.

3.2 Docking results

To demonstrate the effects of the asymmetric potential and anti-
body—antigen—speciﬁc training data, we have compared three po-
tentials. The ﬁrst is the generic DARS potential, which compares
favorably to a number of other potentials (Chuang et al., 2008),
and used with PIPER for docking helped us to be the best

performing predictor group in the latest rounds of CAPRI
(Lensink and Wodak, 2010). The second potential is the sym-
metric DARS, but restricted to the four atoms types discussed,
and trained on antibody—antigen data (aDARS). Finally, the
third potential, referred to as aADARS, is the asymmetric
DARS, with four atom types, and trained on the same anti-
body—antigen data. To evaluate their performance, each of
these three potentials was incorporated as the pairwise compo-
nent of the energy function used in PIPER for docking (see
Section 2) (Kozakov et al., 2006), followed by clustering of the
top 1000 results (Kozakov et al., 2005), as implemented in our
protein—protein docking server ClusPro (Comeau et al., 2004).
The potentials were tested on the antibody—antigen complexes of
the protein docking benchmark (Hwang et al., 2008). In addition
to complexes, the benchmark also includes an unbound structure
for at least one of the component proteins. The unbound/un-
bound or unbound/bound complexes have been used as provided
in the benchmark (Hwang et al., 2008). We note that complexes
close to the ones in the benchmark set were removed from the
training set, following the rules described in Section 2.

In Table 2, the rank of the ﬁrst cluster with <10 A CD, RMSD
between the bound and predicted ligand structures is reported
along with the RMSD of that cluster representative. The absence
of a number indicates that no cluster with <10A Co, RMSD is
predicted. The ﬁrst column of Table 2 shows the PDB ID of the
bound complex. The second column shows whether the case is
bound/unbound or unbound/unbound. The third column
(DARS) shows the results of docking using the original DARS
potential. The fourth column (DARS*) is the same as the third,

but with the non-CDR regions of the antibody masked, making
them unavailable for the interface. The ﬁfth column (aDARS)
shows the results of docking using the antibody—antigen-speciﬁc
symmetric DARS potential. The sixth column (ADARS*) is the
same as the ﬁfth, but with the non-CDR regions of the antibody
masked. Analogously, the seventh column (aADARS) shows the
results of docking using the aADARS potential and the eights
column (aADARS*) is the same as the seventh, but with the
non-CDR of the antibody masked. It is clear from Table 2 that
aADARS performs better than the other potentials that all are
unable to ﬁnd near-native structures for a number of complexes,
whereas using aADARS or aADARS*, this occurs only once.

A11 methods fail to generate any near-native structure for the
complex 1ng. In principle, docking in this case should not be
more difﬁcult than in many others, as the backbone conform-
ational change between the bound and unbound structures is
moderate (1.48A interface Co, RMSD). Although there are a
few large side-chain clashes, these are not expected to lead to
major problems as the energy function in PIPER is ‘soft’
enough to account for potential overlaps. However, the most
signiﬁcant feature of this case is the large size of the antigen
(T aq DNA Polymerase). FFT-based methods generally provide
better performance when the ligand is the smaller molecule. Due
to limitations of the current implementation of PIPER with
asymmetric potentials, the antibody is required to be the recep-
tor, which is appropriate in the majority of the benchmark cases
as antibodies are relatively large. Since in docking the complex,
we translate and rotate a large molecule using a predeﬁned grid,

the failure may be attributed to insufﬁcient sampling rather than
to problems with the scoring function.

The performance of the methods is summarized in Table 3. To
understand these results, note that PIPER retains the 1000 lowest
energy conformations from the FFT-based search, clusters the
retained structures using the pairwise RMSD as the distance
measure and selects a number of the largest clusters for reﬁne-
ment and further analysis. Table 3 shows the success rates for
retaining 1, 10 or 30 clusters, ranked based on cluster size. Here,
success is deﬁned as having a structure with <10A Co, RMSD.
Note that retaining the top 10 clusters is aligned to the CAPRI
rules that allow 10 models to be submitted for each docking
target. The case of retaining 30 clusters is considered, because
this is the maximum number of clusters that are feasible to pro-
cess by more detailed reﬁnement methods (Kozakov et al., 2008).
According to the results in Table 3, using the original
DARS potential PIPER fails to generate near-native structures
in the top 30 clusters for 60% of the complexes in the
benchmark, and thus is not suited for antibody—antigen docking.
Masking the non-CDR regions of the antibody (see DARSa)
improves the results by decreasing the number of failures to
15%. A symmetric potential trained on antigen—antibody
complex data (i.e. aDARS) improves the results relative to the
original DARS, however the number of missed targets stays
high, and masking is still required to reduce the number of
failures. As the last two columns of Table 3 show, the asym-
metric potential trained on antibody—antigen complexes
(aADARSa) yields substantial improvement. In summary, the
new potential is a substantial improvement over the original
DARS potential.

Considering the CAPRI success criterion (at least one accept-
able model among the 10 best predictions), using the bound
structure of the antibody does not substantially change perform-
ance. The success rates are 89% and 80% for the bound/un-
bound and unbound/unbound docking problems, respectively,
(in the latter case ignoring the problematic 1ng case discussed
above).

It should be noted that the steps described above do not
include high-resolution reﬁnement, due to time constraints.
However, such reﬁnement can usually improve the quality
of the model, as we have repeatedly shown in the CAPRI
experiment (Kozakov et al., 2010). We have recently
demonstrated (Kozakov et al., 2008) that an initial global
FFT-based search is highly complementary to a subsequent
local reﬁnement using Monte Carlo-based approaches, as

implemented in Rosetta (Gray et al., 2003; Sircar and Gray,
2010).

4 CONCLUSION

Antibody—antigen complexes present a challenge for protein—
protein docking due to their less favorable desolvation free ener-
gies and more planar interfaces when compared with enzyme—
inhibitor complexes. The less favorable desolvation free energies
are due in part to their less hydrophobic interfaces. Interestingly,
there are a number of hydrophobic atoms in the interface, but
mostly on the antibody side, whereas the epitope on the antigen
may be less hydrophobic. In fact, this should be the case, as
antibodies can be developed against almost any surface of a
given protein, in spite of some of these surfaces being fairly
polar. To take advantage of these properties, we have developed
an aADARS potential. This potential shows that the atom types
YC‘; and FC‘; from Tyr, Trp and Phe residues (Zhang et al.,
1997) have a high probability of being in the paratope and fa-
vorably contribute to the interaction energy, regardless of the
type of the atoms of the epitope they interact with.

To test our newly developed potential, we have performed a
docking test on the antibody—antigen complexes of the protein—
protein docking benchmark (Hwang et al., 2008). Our results
demonstrate that this potential is generally quite successful in
discriminating near-native structures of antibody—antigen com-
plexes. In fact, the potential is able to discriminate the paratope
of the antibody using only biophysical methods, i.e. adding a
priori information on the location of the CDR regions did not
improve the docking results. We believe that more data (i.e. more
resolved crystal structures of antibody—antigen complexes)
would improve the potential even further. As we noted, there
were relatively few contacts for a number of the atom types.
More structures would ameliorate this problem, possibly allow-
ing for the introduction of additional atom types and thus
enabling the development of more detailed antibody—antigen po-
tentials. We note that the asymmetric properties of interfaces are
not constrained to antibody—antigen complexes. In particular,
many signal transduction complexes of the docking benchmark
set exhibit similar features. This is a topic of our current research.

Another direction of research in docking antibodies which
needs improvement is the ability to work with the models
rather than experimental structures. Despite the fact that anti-
body models are usually extremely precise, the quality of docking
results tends to drop drastically when using models rather than
real structures. Accordingly, CAPRI targets that involve docking
based on homology models (Lensink and Wodak, 2010) are not
modeled well. The reason for this drop in performance can be
explained by the fact that standards for modeling proteins and
the quality of the structures needed for docking are very differ-
ent. For example, we know that side-chains placement is ex-
tremely important for protein docking and it is totally ignored
in assessment of quality for protein models. Also side-chain
placement strongly depends on the backbone and slight deviation
of the backbone, which will be unnoticeable in the protein model
quality, will strongly affect side-chain distribution, and hence the
docking results.

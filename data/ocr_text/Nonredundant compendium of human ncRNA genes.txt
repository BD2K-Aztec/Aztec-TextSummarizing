ABSTRACT

Motivation: Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes are increasingly
acknowledged for their importance in the human genome. However,
there is no comprehensive non-redundant database for all such
human genes.

Results: We leveraged the effective platform of GeneCards, the
human gene compendium, together with the power of fRNAdb and
additional primary sources, to judiciously unify all ncRNA gene entries
obtainable from 15 different primary sources. Overlapping entries were
clustered to unified locations based on an algorithm employing
genomic coordinates. This allowed GeneCards’ gamut of relevant
entries to rise ~5-fold, resulting in ~80000 human non-redundant
ncRNAs, belonging to 14 classes. Such ‘grand unification’ within a
regularly updated data structure will assist future ncRNA research.
Availability and implementation: All of these non-coding RNAs are
included among the ~122 500 entries in GeneCards V3.09, along with
pertinent annotation, automatically mined by its built-in pipeline from
100 data sources. This information is available at www.genecards.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, there has been a massive expansion of knowledge
regarding the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) gene universe.
Following the Encode project (Birney et al., 2007), it is now
accepted that while ~80% of the genome is transcribed, only
~2% of the genome is protein coding. Whereas an increasing
body of evidence (Cawley et al., 2004; Ponjavic et al., 2007) sup-
ports the existence of purifying selection as well as binding of
transcription factors to regulate the expression of ncRNA genes
and lends strength to some ncRNA entries, it is still unclear what
fraction of this immense molecular repertoire is functional
(Carninci et al., 2005; Cawley et al., 2004; Ponjavic et al., 2007;
Struhl, 2007). Furthermore, well-documented ncRNA genes do
not exceed 1% of all transcripts. Obviously, this state of affairs

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

points to a potential of tremendous future augmentation of
ncRNA gene counts.

Some classes of ncRNA genes (e.g. rRNA and tRNA) have
been known for a very long time (Holley et al., 1965; Spencer
et al., 1969), while the discovery of the diversity and magnitude
of ncRNA genes has been accelerated in the past few years,
reviewed in Mattick and Makunin (2006). Unlike protein-coding
genes, which have been extensively studied in structure, ortholo-
gue identification and single-nucleotide polymorphism annota-
tion, the study of ncRNA genes lags behind.

There exist more than a dozen ncRNA gene databases. Some
are dedicated to particular ncRNA classes, such as miRBase
(Kozomara and Grifﬁths-Jones, 2011), snoRNA-LBME-db
(Lestrade and Weber, 2006) and piRNABank (Sai Lakshmi
and Agrawal, 2008), while others such as Rfam (Gardner
et al., 2009), RNAdb (Pang et al., 2007) and fRNAdb
(Mituyama et al., 2009) include a variety of ncRNA classes.
Many ncRNA genes are also included in the conventional gene
databases—Ensembl (Flicek et al., 2012), NCBI’s Entrez Gene
(Maglott et al., 2011), HGNC (Seal et al., 2011) and GeneCards
(Safran et al., 2010; Stelzer et al., 2011). Interestingly, these data-
bases vary greatly in their human ncRNA gene counts, partly be-
cause of the use of different sources and integration mechanisms.
Grand unification is thus urgently needed (Bateman et al., 2011).

We have initiated some steps towards this ambitious goal
based on the integration capacities within GeneCards.
GeneCards is an integrated human gene compendium, which
strives to consolidate information about all human genes
(Safran et al., 2010; Stelzer et al., 2011). Its previous V3.07
included 15 118 RNA genes, mined from a limited number of
sources: Ensembl, Entrez Gene and HGNC (Flicek et al., 2012;
Maglott et al., 2011; Seal et al., 2011). We have launched an
expansion and integration protocol, based chieﬂy on the use of
fRNAdb (Mituyama et al., 2009), which in turn is mined from
seven sources currently untapped by GeneCards. Using judicious
uniﬁcation protocols, we report here the augmentation of the
ncRNA gene count to 79 344 in V3.09. While this 5-fold en-
hancement is in large part due to the addition of 21812
non-redundant piRNA genes (Sai Lakshmi and Agrawal,
2008), our pipeline has also resulted in the addition of 36151
genes belonging to other classes, yielding a comprehensive, up-
gradable compendium of ncRNA genes.

2 SYSTEM, METHODS AND ALGORITHM

2.1 A genome location-based algorithm

The realm of ncRNA gene databases is a complex network of mutually
linked data structures (Fig. 1). The integration effort described herein
(Supplementary Fig. S1) makes use of the hierarchical position of two
databases, fRNAdb and GeneCards, each with a set of mined sources
and with complementary data coverage. We use fRNAdb as a major
source, as it is the most comprehensive among ncRNA-exclusive data-
base, containing data from many primary and derived sources. Further,
the uniform data structures provided by fRNAdb for all its sources
reduce the complexity of handling many different data sources. As
RNAdb and some of its primary sources (such as piRNA, Antisense,
Evofold, RNAz and ncRNAsearch) are not expected to be updated,
mining of fRNAdb poses no risk. In distinction, primary sources for
which mining fRNAdb might compromise periodical updates are in par-
allel mined directly at the most updated version (miRBase 19.0, Rfam
V11.0 Hinvdb 8.0 and NONCODE V3.0 for the presently described
GeneCards V3.09). Our main pipeline thus involves the content merger
of these databases into a widely expanded ncRNA category within
GeneCards. For this, we have opted for a genome location-based algo-
rithm for ncRNA gene integration, as described below.

2.2. Mapping t0 the genome

All the mined human ncRNA sequences were downloaded from the rele-
vant sources (Fig. 1) and analysed (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1).
Mapping to multiple locations for the same gene was allowed when an
ncRNA received exactly the same score in such locations. Entries from
fRNAdb annotated as IRES, SECIS and UTR were not considered as
genes and thus disregarded.

2.3. Clustering overlapping entries

We strived to overcome the problem of having several entries that map to
appreciably overlapping positions. To cope with such redundant ncRNA
entries, and to unite presumed parallel versions of the same gene, a clus-
tering algorithm was applied to join entries with overlaps >70% of the
genomic territory of the smaller partner, when occurring on the same
strand. This uniﬁcation process was applied judiciously, based on the
class afﬁliations available in the mined sources, reﬂecting biological evi-
dence. Only entries reported as belonging to the same ncRNA class were
united. In 102 940 cases where an entry was not annotated as belonging to
a speciﬁc ncRNA class (class 2 ‘other;’ Fig. 3), such entry was joined to
another class, with a small minority (220 genes) joined to two to three
relevant classes. Notably, neither RNAdb nor fRNAdb performed a

Fig. 2. For genome mapping of ncRNAs, a BLAT search was run for
each source entry against the human genome build hg19 with non-default
parameters: minimum score: 12, minimum match: 1, minimum iden-
tity = 95% (applied to the matched segment). The former two parameters
allow more accurate detection of short ncRNAs and the latter was per-
missive to allow running this initial lengthy procedure only once, with
liberty to select different stringencies 295% in subsequent steps. For
searching lncRNAs from NONCODE V3.0, we used the non-default
parameters: minimum score: 50, tile size=18, allowing better efﬁcacy
for such lengthy sequences. Sequences that did not obtain a 100% BLAT
match were subjected to a BLASTN search with e-value 510—4. Only
sequences >50 nt were allowed to be interrupted by introns, based on the
knowledge that short ncRNA classes (e.g. piRNAs ~30 nt and miRNAs
~20 nt) are intronless. The better of the BLAT and BLAST results was
used to infer a tentative genomic location. Final ﬁltering and determin-
ation of exact genomic coordinates were done by reanalysing the BLAT/
BLAST outputs, applying a full-length identity cutoff of 297% or :2
mismatches for sequences <67 nt

similar integration process for the data obtained from the primary
sources. Moreover, both allow for clear identiﬁcation of the origin of
the entry and provide the sequences as obtained from primary sources,
without manipulation.

2.4. Uniﬁcation of ncRNA clusters with GeneCards
entries

Uniﬁcation of ncRNA clusters with pre—existing GeneCards entries was
performed with respect to all GeneCards genes, including protein coding
as well as non-protein coding. For pre—existing ncRNA GeneCards
entries, we used the same joining criterion as for the clustering algorithm,
with the exception of not clustering piRNAs with piRNA clusters
(PIRCs; see Section 4). For other GeneCards entries, joining was per-
formed if the GeneCards entry’s endpoint (start/end) is within 10nt of the
matched entry’s endpoint, and the length of the shorter gene is 250% of
the long one. Uniﬁcation was actually performed on the individual
ncRNA entries, and subsequently employed for the cluster as a whole.
In the case that a cluster matched more than one GeneCards entry (1342
instances), multiple uniﬁcation pointers were instituted. Protein-coding
genes were not uniﬁed with their corresponding antisense ncRNA,
since they reside on opposite strands and represent distinct functional
entities. This results in an integrated GeneCards list, including all
ncRNA clusters, whether joined or unjoined to existing GeneCards genes.

piwi-interacting RNAs, ~30 nt long RNAs derived from human testes
which guide silencing of repetitive elements in germ cells (Girard et al.,
2006); linCRNA—in GeneCards, these are long intergenic ncRNA mined
from Ensembl, identiﬁed according to methylation patterns (Flicek et al.,
2012; Guttman et al., 2009), while in fRNAdb they are long ncRNA
based on length >200 and sequence ontology (Ponting et al., 2009); anti-
sense RNA—involved in regulation of transcription (Morris and Vogt,
2010); snRNA—small nuclear RNA—including spliceosomal RNAs es-
sential for splicing (McKeown, 1993); snoRNAs—small nucleolar RNA
guide chemical modiﬁcations on other ncRNA genes (Kiss, 2001); Y

(Christov et al., 2006; Stein et al., 2005); miRNAs—micro RNAs, ~20 nt
long mediators of transcript silencing (Bushati and Cohen, 2007);
tRNA—adaptors between codons and the coded amino acid (Kubli,
1981); rRNA—RNA components of the ribosome (Moore and Steitz,
2002) and 7SK RNA—inhibitors of RNA polymerase II (Blencowe,
2002)

2.5. Removal of certain predicted ncRNA singletons

Finally, candidate GeneCards entries stemming from a single prediction
in the purely predictive ncRNA gene sources (Evofold, RNAZ and
ncRNAsearch), and seen in no other source, were excluded. This is to
diminish the probability of false entries, stemming the estimated high
false-discovery rate (50—70%; Gorodkin et al., 2010; Washietl et al.,
2007). Singleton predictions from the semi-predictive sources Rfam and
NONCODE were however maintained, as they are supported by add-
itional information within the same source.

By the end of this four-stage process (Supplementary Fig. S1),
ncRNAs not merged to existing GeneCards genes are added to the com-
pendium as novel entries. As such, these genes do not have
HGNC-approved symbols, and we opted to use the GeneCards id
(Rosen et al., 2003) as a newly assigned GeneCards symbol. For
piRNAs, the symbol is taken from RNAdb (e.g. PIR61598). For
piRNA multi-membered clusters, we use the identiﬁer of one of the mem-
bers; other members are included as aliases. In the future, every ncRNA
gene assigned an HGNC ofﬁcial symbol will be changed accordingly.

2.6. Expression evidence and quality score

An important issue is how the accuracy and consistency of the catalogued
genes can be ensured. We thus provide a quality score for each ncRNA
gene, which appears along with the list of relevant identiﬁers in the
Aliases and Descriptions section (see Section 3.5). The quality score Q
is computed as the sum Q=10SF+ 5SE+0.2SP+0.5SN, where S, de-
notes the count of data sources of the following kind: SF, showing func-
tional annotation; SE, showing expression; Sp, reporting prediction and

SN, none of the above. In this respect, GeneCards does not simply unify
information about ncRNAs from other resources but also attempts to
convey evidence parameters. GeneCards version 3.09 provides expression
information for ~60% of its ncRNAs, as derived from four sources,
miRBase (1706 GeneCards), NONCODE (7729 GeneCards), H-invDB
(16151 GeneCards) and fRNAdb (21812 piRNA GeneCards). Of the
remaining entries, 2506 ncRNAs are purely predicted as reported by
Evofold, RNAz and ncRNAsearch. Expression evidence annotation
from additional sources will be provided in upcoming versions.

2.7 Functional annotation

In terms of functional annotation, the ncRNA gene universe is still in its
infancy. When it comes to protein-coding genes, GeneCards has an elab-
orate set of sections that provide functional information about genes.
This includes Function, Pathways/Interactions, Drugs/Compounds,
Expression, Genomic Variants and Disorders/Diseases (Safran et al.,
2010). Some of these sections provide links to laboratory products such
as inhibitory RNAs, in situ assays, clones, SAGE tags and PCR assays. A
recently established companion database, MalaCards (http://malacards.
org/, cf. https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismb2012/latebrea-
kingresearch.php#LBR17), provides a disease-centric view with extensive
gene-related links. This infrastructure will sub-serve the mining, dissem-
ination and web display of pertinent information also for ncRNA genes.
Currently implemented is miRTarBase (Hsu et al., 2011) providing ex-
perimentally validated miRNA targets.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

3.1 Pre-integration status

To obtain an integrated compendium of ncRNA genes, we aimed
to bring together such genes from two major derived sources,
each representing a number of primary sources (Fig. l) as well as
several more updated primary sources (see Section 2). The ﬁrst is
fRNAdb with 126 406 human ncRNA entries and the second is
GeneCards with 21451 human ncRNAs, with the additional
sources Rfam, miRBase, HinvDB and lncRNAs from
NONCODE with respective counts of 2838, 3446, 23 407 and
33 829. Figure 3 shows the current numerical breakdown of dif-
ferent ncRNA gene classes in newly added ncRNA entries versus
pre-existing GeneCards. We note that fRNAdb has 84192
entries purely based on computational algorithm predictions
(based on sequence conservation and secondary structure), as
derived from three primary sources: Evofold, RNAz and
ncRNAsearch. These were completely absent in GeneCards.
Another large group of fRNAdb genes belongs to the piRNA
class, constituting 32148 entries. These were previously repre-
sented in GeneCards by a mere 114 entries with a PIRC*
symbol, which are reported PIRCs (Seal et al., 2011) that con-
stitute piRNA precursor transcripts (Lin, 2007; Zamore, 2010).
In a previous version of GeneCards (V3.07), there were only
15 118 entries categorized as RNA genes. This count is partially
based on a restrictive deﬁnition which relies on the appearance of
the string ‘RNA’ in several ﬁelds in the data sources mined. In
preparation for the ncRNA uniﬁcation effort, we employed a
more consistent method of categorization relying more on the
sources’ own category deﬁnition in the three datasets used
(Ensembl, HGNC and NCBI’s Entrez Gene). This resulted in
the addition of 6333 entries, previously annotated as
‘uncategorized’, to the ncRNA GeneCards roster used for uniﬁ-
cation, totaling 21 451ncRNAs.

3.2 Mapping of fRNAdb and other source entries
to the genome

Out of the total of 126406 fRNAdb entries, we determined the
genomic location for 124676 by employing the BLAST and
BLAT routines. The 1730 sequences for which the genomic lo-
cation could not be determined based on our mapping criteria
(Supplementary Fig. S1) were not considered further. Similarly,
we were able to map 2294 (Rfam), 3444 (miRBase), 17098
(HinvDB) and 33 712 (NONCODE) from the additional sources.
Our genome mapping is very similar to the reported mapping via
fRNAdb (after conversion from hg18 to hgl9)—78% of the
entries were mapped to the exact same set of locations per
entry. However, we also determined genome mapping for 12%
of the entries for which the genome mapping was either not
reported by fRNAdb due to mapping suppression of multiple
locations or due to inability to convert between genome builds.

3.3 Clusters of fRNAdb and other source entries

We applied the algorithm for generating clusters of overlapping
RNA genes with uniﬁed location to all sequence-mapped
fRNAdb entries and additional sources. This process identiﬁed
149 863 clusters, of which 135 779 were singleton ncRNA entries
and 14084 had 2—143 members (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig.
S2). The latter encompass a total of 45 445 (30%) of the mapped
ncRNA entries. Many of these overlapping entries are not
unique to fRNAdb and appear also within the individual data-
bases, as exempliﬁed in Fig. 4 and available in GeneCards V3.09.

It is worth noting that the overlap between the predictive
methods is relatively low (only ~6% purely predicted clusters
were kept). The overlap between RNAz and Evofold was previ-
ously found to be only 7.2%, which is attributed to the higher
sensitivity of Evofold to AU rich regions, while RNAz is more
sensitive to GC rich regions, despite the fact that both were
trained using the Rfam database (W ashietl et al., 2007).

3.4 Unifying fRNAdb and GeneCards

The 149 863 clusters of ncRNA genes were compared with all
GeneCards entries. Only 17 648 of these were found to match at
least one GeneCards entry, and 86% of these showed an overlap
to targets included among GeneCards’ 21 451 ncRNAs. Notably,
we found that 7801 pre—existing ncRNA genes in GeneCards do
not match any cluster of the newly added ncRNA entries. In
turn, 57 636 clusters had no match in GeneCards, including
21812 piRNAs and 33 318 non-computationally predicted
RNA genes. These genes have now been added to GeneCards
version 3.09. After this uniﬁcation process, GeneCards includes
almost 80 000 human ncRNA genes (Fig. 5), now the largest
category within this compendium, quadruple the number of
recorded protein-coding genes.

3.5 Annotation

The ncRNA GeneCards entries, both originally present and inte-
grated from fRNAdb and additional sources are annotated by
the same procedures used throughout this database (Safran et al.,
2010). A crucial facet is the alias section, in which, when relevant,
fRNAdb identiﬁers, as well as primary and derived database
identiﬁers, with deep links to the relevant source data facilities.

4 DISCUSSION

The ﬁeld of ncRNA genes is a dynamic one; new genes and even
new classes are continuously discovered. We have strived to gen-
erate a comprehensive integrated list of human ncRNA genes
within GeneCards, thereby placing them in the context of a com-
plete human gene compendium. For that, two large and mutually
complementary sources of human ncRNA genes were put to use,
conveying the content of 15 more restricted databases. This re-
sulted in the inclusion of 79 344 GeneCards for ncRNAs, when
compared with 15 118 in GeneCards V3.07, and to 21451 after
the reclassiﬁcation of 6333 previously ‘uncategorized’ entries as
ncRNAs, respectively, ~5-fold and ~3.5-fold increases. The
~58 000 ncRNAs added in this uniﬁcation process were derived
from ~l80 000 genome-mapped fRNAdb and other source
entries. The latter were pruned to ~75 500 unique, more reliable
ncRNAs (i.e. after clustering and removal of purely predicted
singletons), candidates for integration into GeneCards. There
was a surprisingly small overlap of ~13 900 entries between the
pruned ncRNAs and the past GeneCards embodiment, probably
stemming from the existence of partially orthogonal worldwide
pipelines for ncRNA discovery, and the almost mutually exclu-
sive source lists for fRNAdb and GeneCards (Fig. l). GeneCards

V3.09 thus contains 101004 molecularly identiﬁed functional
gene entries (protein coding and ncRNAs). In addition, this ver-
sion has 21409 entries for pseudogenes, gene clusters, genetic
disease loci and ‘uncategorized’, providing a grand total of
122413.

A major step in the fRNAdb pruning process was clustering of
ncRNA entries with extensive genome overlaps, greatly extend-
ing the removal of redundant entries already performed within
fRNAdb (Mituyama et al., 2009). The arguably arbitrary clus-
tering cutoff we have used is not much different from that
employed by others, as exempliﬁed by the case of piRNABank
(Sai Lakshmi and Agrawal, 2008), whereby the 32148 entries
represented in fRNAdb have undergone local removal of redun-
dancies to 23 439, quite similar to our procedure. Our method
further eliminated sequences that were predicted only once as
ncRNAs on the basis of sequence conservation and/or secondary
structure alone. This is because such predictions were reported to
comprise a high fraction of false positives, up to 50—70%
(Gorodkin et al., 2010; Washietl et al., 2007). We believe that
the resulting list of ~79 300 ncRNAs represents an adequately
comprehensive compendium, in which purely predicted entries
are only minimally presented (~3 %), allowing effective future
scrutiny.

GeneCards V3.07 already included ll4piRNA-related entries
(with symbols PIRC*). These were mined from HGNC (and
originally from piRNABank) and constitute clusters of
~40—4000 (Sai Lakshmi and Agrawal, 2008) individual
piRNAs. We have decided that GeneCards will have a card for
each individual piRNA, with annotation indicating cluster afﬁli-
ation in GeneCards’ Aliases and Descriptions section. For

continuity and comprehensive consistency with HGNC, the
PIRC entries are included as well. This decision is inspired by
the fact that PIRC coordinates are computationally predicted
with limited hard evidence for the existence of the 114 PIRCs
as transcripts (Zamore, 2010). Another reason is not omitting
piRNAs that are not included in PIRC clusters. Finally, recent
studies have found a link between individual piRNAs and
tumour development (Cheng et al., 2012, 2011), emphasizing
the importance of regarding each piRNA as an individual
gene. In the future, we also intend to add annotations for
PIRCs according to several algorithms that provide cluster
boundaries often differing from one another (Girard et al.,
2006; Rosenkranz and Zischler, 2012; Sai Lakshmi and
Agrawal, 2008).

Some of the criteria applied in our clustering procedure are
somewhat arbitrary, such as the use of 70% positional overlap.
However, we veriﬁed that this criterion does not impact much
the number of multi-membered clusters created (Supplementary
Fig. S3).

When comparing the original GeneCards (version 3.07) to the
newly added ncRNA sources (Fig. 5), we found that only
~13 900 ncRNA entries were shared, while ~7800 entries were
unique to GeneCards and ~57 600 were seen only in the added
sources. This is surprising, since our expectation from the much
larger size of newly introduced ncRNA collection was that it
would include most or all of the original GeneCards ncRNA
entries (~21500). However, many of the non-overlap cases are
easily explainable; ~21 800 of these fRNAdb-unique entries are
piRNAs and ~2500 are ncRNA predictions from Evofold,
RNAz and ncRNAsearch, both not included in GeneCards
V3.07, leaving ~33 500 (~58%) to be accounted for.
Conversely, ~72% of the GeneCards-unique entries come from
Ensembl (Flicek et al., 2012), a data source not mined by
fRNAdb, which addresses only ncRNA-speciﬁc databases.
Thus, such mutual omissions may not be suspected as erroneous.

The foregoing underline the fact that our uniﬁcation process
results in the most comprehensive dataset of human ncRNA
genes, containing 7801 entries absent in the newly added sources.
These are ncRNA genes uniquely found in the ‘general’ gene
databases Entrez Gene and Ensembl, but not in ncRNA-speciﬁc
compendia. Further, fRNAdb and the other added sources con-
tain a considerable number (~45 500) of redundant entries,
which in our procedure are judiciously uniﬁed into ~14 000 clus-
ters based on genomic location. Finally, the reduced compen-
dium of ncRNA genes within GeneCards V3.09 is based on
the notion that genes predicted by only one source are less
likely to be valid. In the current version such genes are removed;
in the future, they will be presented with a prediction score prob-
ability indicator (see below).

We make a distinction between two sets of predicted ncRNAs.
The ﬁrst set is predicted purely by computational algorithms, as
exempliﬁed by RNAz and Evofold entries in fRNAdb. The
second set includes Rfam entries, predicted based on known
ncRNA seeds, and in turn serving (along with miRBase entries)
as prediction templates for Ensembl ncRNAs (Flicek et al.,
2012). Similarly, Ensembl relies on lincRNA discovery that in-
cludes identiﬁcation of chromatin methylation outside
protein-coding genes (Flicek et al., 2012). Therefore, we included
all Ensembl ncRNA predictions while the fRNAdb predictions

were further ﬁltered. In the future, other ﬁltration methods will
be considered, e.g. based on the reported prediction scores
(Pedersen et al., 2006; Torarinsson et al., 2006; Washietl,
2007). In addition, we will make the predictive arsenal more
comprehensive, including the use of additional algorithms such
as Alifole (W ashietl and Hofacker, 2004), or improved versions
of presently utilized algorithms such as RNAz 2.0 (Gruber et al.,
2010). While at present GeneCards policy is to mine existing
repositories of prediction outputs, we will consider also perform-
ing prediction runs on our own when needed.

We provide here a status description for GeneCards version
3.09. Notably, GeneCards is a dynamic data structure, with three
version updates each year. The mining of ncRNA genes from all
sources (Fig. 1) has now become part of the standard GeneCards
generation process. Thus, all inclusion and annotation aspects
would be frequently revised. fRNAdb released a minor update in
March 2012 and is expected to undergo a major update in
December 2012, followed by subsequent releases about every
half year. GeneCards in turn will retrieve new fRNAdb content
at each of its own updates (three times a year) and add directly
primary sources not updated by fRNAdb.

The Encode project predicts that ~80% of all genomic terri-
tories are transcribed in one fashion or another. Using integrated
GeneCards information, and disregarding overlaps, we estimate
that 56% of the 3.1Gb of the genome is occupied by genes,
taking into account cumulative lengths of all preprocessed
mRNA, including introns. The cumulative gene territories of
all ncRNA genes in our GeneCards integration effort is 25%,
of which the newly added 57636 clusters add ~15%. The total
genome territory thus covered amounts to 71% of the human
genome. Such difference between ENCODE and GeneCards
may simply be due to dataset input and computation discrepan-
cies. However, at least some of this difference may represent
genes (mainly ncRNAs) still awaiting identiﬁcation and
characterization.

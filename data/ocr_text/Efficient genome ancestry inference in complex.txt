ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-density SNP data of model animal resources
provides opportunities for fine-resolution genetic variation studies.
These genetic resources are generated through a variety of breeding
schemes that involve multiple generations of matings derived from a
set of founder animals. In this article, we investigate the problem
of inferring the most probable ancestry of resulting genotypes,
given a set of founder genotypes. Due to computational difficulty,
existing methods either handle only small pedigree data or disregard
the pedigree structure. However, large pedigrees of model animal
resources often contain repetitive substructures that can be utilized
in accelerating computation.

Results: We present an accurate and efficient method that can
accept complex pedigrees with inbreeding in inferring genome
ancestry. Inbreeding is a commonly used process in generating
genetically diverse and reproducible animals. It is often carried out
for many generations and can account for most of the computational
complexity in real-world model animal pedigrees. Our method builds
a hidden Markov model that derives the ancestry probabilities
through inbreeding process without explicit modeling in every
generation. The ancestry inference is accurate and fast, independent
of the number of generations, for model animal resources such as
the Collaborative Cross (CC). Experiments on both simulated and real
CC data demonstrate that our method offers comparable accuracy
to those methods that build an explicit model of the entire pedigree,
but much better scalability with respect to the pedigree size.

1 INTRODUCTION

Model organisms, such as laboratory mice, are frequently bred or
crossed in order to study genetic inﬂuences (Chia et al., 2005;
Churchill et al., 2002; Valdar et al., 2006). Often, such animal
resources are generated using prescribed breeding system to ensure
diversity and reproducibility, which leads to complex pedigree
structure consisting of many generations. Through recombination,
the DNA sequences of founder organisms are intermixed in each
generation. A DNA sequence of any descendant organism is a mosaic
of its founders’ DNA segments. As recombinations at each breeding
stage cannot be observed directly, it is of great interest to infer the
ancestry of resulting DNA sequences. In other words, which part of
a resulting DNA sequence is inherited from which founder.

The vast majority of the sequence variations are attributed
to single base pair mutations known as single nucleotide

polymorphism (SNPs), thus making SNPs ideal for resolving the
genome ancestry problem. The set of SNPs on the same chromosome
constitutes a haplotype. While any of the four nucleotides (A,T,C,G)
is possible, in practice nearly all SNPs appear in only two variations.
This results from the fact that SNPs originate as mutations, which
are rare events within a vast genome. It is therefore convenient to
encode a SNP allele as a binary value and represent haplotypes as
binary sequences. Modern high—throughput genotyping technologies
are unable to distinguish between the two haplotypes of a diploid
organism. Instead, a genotype sequence is measured where, at each
SNP site, one of three possibilities is observed ({00,01,11}, since
10 cannot be distinguished from 01).

Using the genotype representation for DNA sequences, the
genome ancestry problem estimates the origin of each genotype
from a descendant’s sequence given the genotype sequences of its
distant founders. To achieve high resolution, dense SNP markers
are used (tens of thousands on each chromosome). Knowledge of
genotype’s ancestry is particularly useful in many problems such
as studying the structure and history of haplotype blocks (Gabriel
et al., 2002; Schwartz et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2002), and mapping
quantitative trait loci (QTLs; Mott et al., 2000; Valdar et al., 2006). In
these studies, a probabilistic interpretation is favored over discrete
solutions, due to the prevalence of ambiguities and measurement
errors.

The genome ancestry problem is closely related to haplotype
inference with pedigree data. Inferring haplotypes in a pedigree often
involves solving the inheritance ﬂow of alleles at each generation.
On the other hand, given the genome ancestry information, it
is straightforward to reconstruct the descendant haplotypes. As
pedigree analysis is Non—deterministic Polynomial—time (NP) hard
(Piccolboni and Gusﬁeld, 2003), existing algorithms are either
approximate or suffer exponential running times. Among the
maximum likelihood approaches, methods (Abecasis et al., 2002;
Gudbjartsson et al., 2005; Kruglyak et al., 1996) based on the
Lander—Green algorithm (Lander and Green, 1987) are often
favored because their running time is linear to the number of
markers. MERLIN (Abecasis et al., 2002), an implementation based
on sparse binary trees, is one of the most successful pedigree
analysis programs. Unfortunately, methods based on Lander—Green
algorithms are limited to pedigrees of moderate size since the
running time grows exponentially with pedigree size. MCMC
sampling methods (Jensen and Kong, 1999; Sobel and Lange, 1996)
have been proposed to address larger pedigrees. But their computing
time can be substantial when applied to a large number of tightly
linked markers. Other efforts include rule—based methods (Li and
Jiang, 2005; Qian and Beckmann, 2002), which approximates a
solution by minimizing recombinations in the pedigree (MRHC).

PedPhase (Li and Jiang, 2005), which employs an effective integer
linear programming (ILP) formulation, has been widely used in
solving the MRHC.

Current haplotyping methods for pedigrees are incapable of
solving the genome ancestry problem in animal resources for
the following reasons: (i) Pedigrees of model animal resources
often contain large number of generations to ensure diversity and
reproducibility. (ii) None or few of the intermediate generations is
genotyped due to the size of the resources. (iii) A large number
of dense markers are genotyped to achieve ﬁne resolution. As a
concrete example, more than 1000 lines have been started in the
Collaborative Cross (CC) project (Churchill et al., 2002). Each line
is expected to undergo at least 23 generations before reaching 99%
inbred. Hundreds of mice of various generations were genotyped, but
on average only few are from the same line. The missing genotypes
make the search space extraordinarily large.

Other computationally efﬁcient approaches for solving the
genome ancestry problem have largely ignored the breeding
scheme. While breeding design does not determine the locations of
recombination, it often places constraints on the possible ancestry
choices at a single site and at neighboring sites. The genome ancestry
problem was modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem
in Zhang et al. (2008). By minimizing recombinations, discrete
solutions are generated. Mott and coworker (Mott et al., 2000; Valdar
et al., 2006) has proposed an approach using hidden Markov model
(HMM) for ancestry inference in HAPPY, a QTL mapping tool
suite for association studies. All founder pairs are considered as
possible hidden states for emitting the observed genotype at each
site. Besides founder genotypes, no pedigree data are used in these
two approaches.

There have also been many efforts to analyze pedigree by
identifying symmetries in HMM state space (Browning and
Browning, 2002; Donnelly, 1983; Geiger et al., 2009; McPeek,
2002). The states are then grouped to accelerate the calculation.
However, ﬁnding the maximal grouping is non—trivial. In real—world
problems, only obvious symmetries such as founder phase and chain
structure in pedigree can be best utilized.

Besides model organisms, the genetic ancestry problem has been
studied for human individuals that have recently been admixed from
a set of isolated populations, instead of a set of founders (Pasaniuc
et al., 2009; Sankararaman et al., 2008; Sundquist et al., 2008;
Tang et al., 2006). In this problem, pedigree structure is usually
not present. Efﬁcient methods have been developed to handle large—
scale datasets (Sankararaman et al., 2008; Sundquist et al., 2008;
Tang et al., 2006).

Leveraging the observation that large animal resource pedigrees
often contain repetitive substructures, we propose a method that can
efﬁciently handle complex pedigrees with inbreeding which is an
important process in generating animal resources. Using a pair of
dependent quaternary indicators to capture all recombinations in the
inbreeding history, our method achieves accurate ancestry inference
without explicit modeling in every generation. By encoding the
inbreeding model into the inheritance vectors, we design a Lander—
Green—like algorithm whose running time remains constant with
respect to the number of inbreeding generations. Our method is
implemented and evaluated on the CC breeding design (Churchill
et al., 2002) with dense SNP data. Experiments show that, our
approach generates accurate results efﬁciently on data that cannot
be handled by existing pedigree haplotyping software. Compared

with HAPPY, which does not consider pedigree structure, our
approach signiﬁcantly reduces ambiguities and errors in ancestry
inference.

2 THE GENOME ANCESTRY PROBLEM

Given a pair of chromosomes, we consider L SNP markers ordered
by their chromosomal locations. For each SNP site, we use 0 and 1
to encode the two possible values. The genotype at each site
is the unordered combination of corresponding alleles from both
chromosomes, which can assume one of three values: 00, 01, 11. A
genotype sequence is a genome—ordered set of genotypes denoted
as: G=g1...gl...gL,(gl€{00,01,11}). A haplotype H=h1...hl...hL
consists of alleles from one of the chromosomes where h; E {0, 1}.
Consider a pedigree containing a set of founders F S = {F 1, ...,F N}
and a descendant of interest. We denote the set of founder genotype
sequences by {031, ...,GFN}, all of which are given. Given the
genotype sequence, GD, of the descendant generated through the
pedigree structure, its genome ancestry is to be determined. Every
genotype g; in G3 inherits its alleles from two founders, say F A
and F3. We refer to the founder pair (F A,F 3) as the genome
ancestry at site I of genotype sequence GD. We want to estimate,
for every SNP site I, the probability P(Ancestry(gl) = (F A,F 3)) for
every founder pair (F A,F 3)€FS><FS. Note that founder pairs are
unordered ((F A , F 3) = (F 3 , F A)), and it is possible that F A =F 3.

3 MODELING INHERITANCE IN PEDIGREE

We start from the standard Lander—Green approach to model a
pedigree: at each SNP site, an inheritance indicator is used to indicate
the outcome of each meiosis. These inheritance indicators together
form the inheritance vector. Since a child haplotype inherits its
allele from either the paternal or maternal sequence, an inheritance
indicator is a binary variable. For a pedigree with n non—founder
animals, there are 2 X n inheritance indicators at each site. Hence,
the inheritance vector at site l, v], can be deﬁned as a binary sequence
of length 2 X n. An instance of v; speciﬁes a possible conﬁguration
of inheritance ﬂow at site I of all animals in the pedigree. When SNP
markers are dense enough, we can assume at most one recombination
between two sites in generating one haplotype. If a recombination
happens between site I and l—l—1, the corresponding inheritance
indicator will have different states for the two sites. Hence, to
measure the number of recombinations between I and l—l—1 in the
whole pedigree, we can count the difference in bits between V; and
vl+1. The probability of having d recombinations between I and
1 +1 is 6d(1—6)2”_d, where 6 is the recombination fraction.

The length of inheritance vector grows linearly with the number
of animals in the pedigree and this causes exponential growth in the
number of possible inheritance patterns. Considering the fact that
full pedigree analysis is computationally intractable, we overcome
the issue by modeling important substructure in breeding systems
as a shortcut to efﬁcient computation. Our ﬁrst natural choice of
substructure is inbreeding: (i) Inbreeding is often used in model
animal resources to generate genetically diverse and/or reproducible
descendants. (ii) Inbreeding is often carried out for many generations
and each generation elongates the inheritance vectors by 4 bits.
Hence, if a pedigree involves inbreeding, the inbreeding generations
often account for most of the computational complexity. We seek an
aggregated inheritance indicator to replace the collection of many

inheritance indicators in the inbreeding process. Such an aggregated
indicator can be encoded in much shorter length and incorporated
into the inheritance vector. If the state and transition probability of
the aggregated indicator can be modeled efﬁciently, full pedigree
analysis will become feasible on these animal resources. In the next
section, we explain how inheritance in inbreeding generations can
be modeled as an aggregated indicator.

3.1 Modeling inbreeding generations

During inbreeding, offspring are produced by sibling matings for
many generations. At each generation, four new haplotypes are
formed by recombining the four haplotypes from the previous
generation. The inbreeding process at a single site is shown in
Figure 1a. We denote the beginning generation of inbreeding as
generation 10. Observe that, at each site, because of the symmetry
of inbreeding structure, the four alleles at generation 10 have equal
probabilities to be passed down to any haplotypes after 11. Thus,
for a descendant haplotype at generation [k (k > 2), we can simply

inheritance pattern of an inbreeding process at a single site. (b) An equivalent
quaternary indicator representation.

Table 1. All possible transitions of S(a),S(b)

replace the lattice of binary inheritance indicators by a single
quaternary indicator. Each choice of the quaternary indicator has
1 / 4 probability. Two quaternary indicators are needed for the two
haplotypes of a 1k descendant (Fig. 1b). However, the two quaternary
indicators are not independent as the two haplotypes share the
same inbreeding history until Ik_1. To model this dependency
between the two quaternary indicators, we ﬁnd out the transition
events and probabilities of the pair of indicators. The grouped pair
is then used as an aggregated inheritance indicator as discussed
above.

We label the four 10 haplotypes as 1,2, 3,4. We then denote by
61,19 the two 1k descendant haplotypes and 5(a)),S(bl) are their 10
sources at site I, i.e., 5(a)),S(bl) 6 {1,2, 3, 4}. Their 10 sources along
the chromosome is denoted by S (a), S(b) 6 {1,2, 3, 4}L. A transition
happens in 5(a) between site I and l+1 if S(al)7éS(al+1). We
consider, between two adjacent sites, I and l—l—1, all the possible
transitions from 5(a)),S(bl) to S(al+1),S(bl+1) (Table 1).

Note that:

PEEO +PEN1+PEE2 +PEN2 =P(S(az)=5(bz)) =
PEEO +PEE2 +PNE1+PNE2 =P(S(az+1) =S(bz+1))

and

PNE1+PNN0 +PNN1+PNN2 +PNE2 =P(S(az)755(bz))=
PEN1+PEN2 +PNN0 +PNN1+PNN2 =P(S(az+1)#5(bz+1))

The prior probability P(S(al)=S(bl)) at any site I is called the
inbreeding coeﬁicient (Wright, 1922). To calculate the probability,
let [Ck denote the inbreeding coefﬁcient at generation 1k. [Ck can
_ _ k—2 1 k—j
be computed recurs1vely us1ng [Ck = ZjZO E X (1 —l—ICJ-).
Next, we derive the probabilities in Table 1. Consider that any
transition in 5(a) or S(b) is caused by one or more recombinations
in the inbreeding process (Fig. 1a ). Our calculation is based on the
assumption that the recombination fraction, 6, is reasonably small.
Hence, for any haplotype c at generation  (1 fjfk), we assume that
any single transition in S(c) is solely caused by one recombination
in generating c or its ancestor haplotypes. In other words, a single
transition in S(c) is not the result of multiple recombinations in the
pedigree. Our assumption is generally true for dense SNP markers
where 6 is usually well below 0.001. Under the assumption, if a

transition in S (c) is caused by a recombination in generating c itself,
we deﬁne this to be a lead transition. Intuitively, a lead transition
is one not inherited from its ancestors. A lead transition in c will
change the 10 source of c and all descendant haplotypes inheriting
the transition. A lead transition is only possible when the two parental
haplotypes of c have different 10 sources. Hence, between two sites,
a haplotype at generation j has a lead transition with probability
6 x (1 —ICJ-_1).

With the inbreeding coefﬁcients calculated, we can derive the
marginal probability of observing transition in one of the 1k
haplotypes, PIT =P(S(al);éS(al+1))=P(S(bl);éS(bl+1)). Without
loss of generality, we consider P(S(al);éS(al+1)) for haplotype a.
5(a) will transition if a itself or any of its ancestor haplotypes
has a lead transition. At generation k, the lead transition happens
with probability 6 X (1 —ICk_1). For generation k — 1, there are two
possible ancestor haplotypes, each with %6 X (1 —ICk_2) chance
of causing a transition in 5(a). For each generation j from 1 to
k—2, there are four possible ancestor haplotypes with probability
%6 X (1 —ICJ-_1). Consider that, at one site, any two haplotypes from
the same generation cannot both be the ancestor of a. Thus, for any
generation j, the expected probability of causing transition in S (a)
is 6 X (1 —ICJ~_1). Under our assumption, P(S(al);éS(al+1)) can be
expressed by 1— Hf=1(1—6 X (1 —ICJ-_1)).

We then derive the probability P332 that 5(a) and S(b) have
equal state at site I, and both transition to another state at site
1+ 1. This event happens only if a haplotype c at some previous
generation is the common ancestor of 61,19 and c has a lead
transition. The probability of c at generation j being the common
ancestor of a and b is AllICk_j. The probability that c has a lead
transition is 6 X (1 —ICJ-_1). Again, consider the fact that, at
one site, any two haplotypes from the same generation cannot
both be the common ancestor of a and 19. Thus, the probability
of EE2 event caused by lead transition at  (lfjfk—2) is
6 X (1 —ICj_1)ICk_J-. Assuming a small 6, P332 can be calculated

by 1—1‘1f;12(1—9x(1—1Cj_1)ICk_j).

Lastly we consider the probability PNNI. To simplify our
discussion, assume that the transition happens in 5(a) [i.e.
S(al)7éS(al+1)] and it inherits a lead transition in haplotype c of
generation j. Since S(al), S(al+1) and S(bl) all have different 10
ancestry, alleles from at least three distinct IO haplotypes should be
observed at generation j — 1. Let PDistinct(m, j) be the probability of
observing exactly m distinct IO alleles at generation j. PDistinct(3, j)
and PDistinct(4, j) can be computed recursively using:

. 1 .
P Distinct(4a] ) = 1P Distinct(4a] _ 1)

. 1 . 1 .
PDistinct(3a]) = EPDistinctBa] _ 1)+ EPDistinct(4a] _ 1)

Then, PNNI is the probability that (i) at least three distinct IO alleles
are present at generation j —1 and (ii) a’s ancestor c at generation j
has a lead transition between sites I and 1+ 1 which is inherited by a
(iii) before and after transition, the 10 source of c is different from
that of 19. Due to space limitation, we omit the detailed discussion
of c at different generations.

Under our assumption of a small 6, PNN2,PN32,P3N2 are
all sufﬁciently small and can be ignored in calculating other
probabilities. The intuition is as follows: if k is small, there are

multiple transitions is rare; when k becomes larger, the probability
P(S(al)7éS(bl)) approaches 0 rapidly and PNN2,PN32,P3N2 are
much smaller than P(S(al)7éS(bl)). With PIT, P332 and PNNI
derived, we can easily solve all the rest probabilities in Table 1:

P N31 XPNEI . We use simulation to validate the probabilities derived
above. The results are shown in Figure 2. For 6 around 0.01, our
method gives reasonably close approximation. For 6 below 0.001,
our method is very accurate. The recombination fraction between
dense SNP markers is usually well below 0.001.

So far we have derived all event probabilities in Table 1. The

3.2 Integrating the inbreeding model

We have argued that each inbreeding process can be modeled by
two quaternary indicators and their transition probabilities can be
accurately approximated when 6 is small. It is then straightforward
to integrate the inbreeding model into the original Lander—Green
model. We encode the two quaternary indicators using 4 binary bits
in the inheritance vector. Consider a pedigree containing i inbreeding
processes and n’ other members not involved in inbreeding. The
inheritance vector v; at every site I now has length 2 X n’ —l— 4 X i. Each
possible realization of v; is a hidden state in HMM. The transition
probability from v; to vl+1 is the product of transition probabilities
of all binary indicators and pairs of quaternary indicators. We can
then solve the HMM using standard routine:

Note that, if we place the bits of quaternary indicators at the end
of inheritance vector, the recursive calculation of oz and ,8 can still
greatly beneﬁt from the Elston—Idury algorithm (Idury and Elston,
1997).

4 MODELING THE CO

The CC is a large panel of reproducible, recombinant—inbred mouse
lines proposed by the Complex Trait Consortium (Churchill et al.,
2002). Over a thousand of mouse lines have been started among
which several hundred lines are kept inbreeding. All mouse lines
are generated using eight genetically diverse founders via a common
breeding scheme designed to randomize the genomic contribution of
each founder. It provides an ideal platform for testing our approach.

4.1 The breeding scheme

CC mice are derived from eight fully inbred founders using the eight—
way funnel breeding scheme shown in Figure 3a. The chromosomes
of the eight founders (shown in different colors) are combined by
two generations of crosses (labeled Gl and G210), followed by at
least 20 inbreeding generations (G211 to 02100).

The positions of the eight founders are not ﬁxed. Permutations
of the founders are used to randomize the genomes and balance
the founder contributions to the resulting CC lines. This variation
in initial positions imposes different ancestry constraints on each
line. Without loss of generality, we assume a founder order of
F1F2F3F4F5F6F7F8 as shown in Figure 3a.

4.2 Modeling the genome of G2Ik generation

In a CC pedigree, any recombination in the formation of Gl
haplotypes can be virtually ignored since all founders are fully

inbred. Hence, at each SNP site, we only need four inheritance
indicators for G210 haplotypes and two quaternary indicators for
the two haplotypes in a resulting G21 k descendant. The structure of
the inheritance indicators is shown in Figure 3b.

G211 mice are an exception which only involve one generation
of inbreeding. For a G211 mouse, we simply let the two quaternary
indicators revert back to binary indicators. This becomes a standard
Lander—Green model and it can be seen that the two G211 haplotypes
are restricted to be from the left and right half of the funnel,
respectively.

5 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we evaluate the proposed model on both simulated
data and real CC genotype data. We implement our model GAIN
(Genome Ancestry with INbreeding) for CC using C++. GAIN is
compared with MERLIN (Abecasis et al., 2002) and HAPPY (Mott
et al., 2000). MERLIN is a widely used pedigree analysis software
based on Lander—Green algorithm and can handle large number
of markers. HAPPY is a QTL mapping tool suite and can analyze
genome ancestry based on only founder and descendant genotype
data, i.e it ignores pedigree structure. Both softwares estimate the
genome ancestry directly or indirectly.

5.1 Experiments on simulated data

As ground truth is generally unavailable for real data, we evaluate
the accuracy of genome ancestry analysis using simulated data. We
simulate the genotype of a G2Ik mouse by recombining real CC
founder haplotypes according to the CC pedigree structure. Given
the founder genotypes, the founder haplotypes can be obtained
trivially since all founders are fully inbred. At each generation we
choose recombination position randomly. To simulate genotyping
errors, we also introduce random errors to the resulting genotype
sequence. When a site is selected to represent an error, we ﬂip
its value to heterozygous if it is homozygous originally. If a
heterozygous site is selected, we change it to one of the homozygous
state randomly. This resembles the fact that most genotyping
errors are between heterozygous and homozygous states, instead
of between the two homozygous states.

We simulate 20 test cases for each generation from G211 to G2I20.
The number of markers ranges from 6000 to 10000. As MERLIN
does not output probability distribution for each inheritance vector,
we ﬁrst compare the best founder ancestry pair estimated by each
method against the true answer. The error rate is measured by the
percentage of sites where the estimated best founder ancestry does
not match the ground truth. Figure 4 shows the error rate of all three
methods in the simulated data with and without errors. Results of
MERLIN are only available for the ﬁrst four generations as the
running time grows exponentially with the size of pedigree. No
results can be generated within reasonable running time (3 h) for
generations beyond G214. By incorporating pedigree information,
both GAIN and MERLIN infer accurate estimates (error rate <2%).
In contrast, HAPPY has much higher error rates and is more sensitive
to noise.

As mentioned previously, an accurate solution to the genome
ancestry problem is important to subsequent studies such as QTL
analysis. In such studies, not only the most likely genome ancestry
is desired, but also the probabilities of each founder pair are wanted.

Hence, it is also important to evaluate the probability distribution
generated by each method. Both GAIN and HAPPY compute a
probability distribution of each founder pair being the ancestry at
a SNP site. We investigate the proportion of probabilities assigned
to wrong founder ancestry. The result in Figure 5 shows that the
knowledge of pedigree structure is indispensable in solving the
genome ancestry problem. While HAPPY infers the most probable
ancestry correctly for >80% of the markers, it assigns near 60% of
the total probabilities to wrong ancestry choices. The misassigned
probabilities could hamper further studies. With pedigree structure
modeled, GAIN can resolve most ambiguities and assigns only <4%
of the total probabilities to wrong ancestry.

5.2 Experiments on real CC data

Our dataset consists of genotypes of all autosomes from 96 mice
of generation G215 to G2112. The number of SNP markers on each
chromosome ranges from 4122 to 35 172. Due to the running time
constraint of MERLIN, we only compare GAIN with HAPPY which
does not consider pedigree structure. Since the true genome ancestry
is unknown, we investigate the difference between the results of the
two approaches.

We compare both the best ancestry estimated and the full
probability distribution of each possible ancestry. The ﬁrst
comparison (Fig. 6a) shows the percentage of sites of which the best
ancestry estimated by the two methods do not agree. The difference
in best ancestry choice is very similar to that of our experiments on
simulated data with random error: the results from the two methods
differ by 20%. We further measure the difference in probability
distributions quantitatively using Jensen—Shannon divergence (J SD,
Lin, 1991) which is a smoothed and bounded divergence based

A low I SD indicates high similarity between p1 and p2. The J SD
ranges between 0 and 2. Figure 6b compares the mean and SD of
the J SD between HAPPY’s results and ours over all markers and all
96 mice, grouped by chromosomes.

Though we cannot compare the results against the ground truth
for real CC data, the source of difference are further investigated.
Consider again the CC pedigree in Figure 3a. The initial four
founder—mating pairs (F1,F2),(F3,F4), (F5,F6), (F7,F8) cannot
serve as ancestry for any genotypes of G2Ik descendants. This is
because any genetic material passed from a founder mating pair
is carried by a single haplotype in the G210 generation. These
four founder pairs are thus invalid ancestry choices if the pedigree
structure is considered. As an example to show the improved
inference due to incorporating pedigree knowledge, the ancestry of
chromosome 7 of a G216 mouse inferred by GAIN and HAPPY
are shown in Figure 7a and b respectively. The most probable
founder pair inferred by HAPPY agrees with our result at most
sites. But their actual probabilities are often different. To quantify
the extent to which HAPPY assigns positive probabilities to invalid
ancestry, at each site I, we aggregate the probabilities of invalid
ancestry and plot this ‘pedigree inconsistency’ measure in Figure 70.
We can see that, the difference between Figure 7a and b is
largely inﬂuenced by the ‘pedigree inconsistency’. Moreover, the
probability distributions of ancestry choices at neighboring sites
are not independent. Probabilities assigned to pedigree—inconsistent
ancestry can substantially inﬂuence the, choice of ancestry at
neighboring sites. Such ‘propagated error’ is sometimes the main
cause of the J SD between HAPPY’s results and ours. As an example,
Figure 7d shows a region in chromosome 1 from another G216 mouse
where the propagated error is the main cause of divergence. In this
region, HAPPY does not assign signiﬁcant probabilities to invalid
ancestry choice, except for a few sites at both ends of this region.
But, in the middle part, HAPPY favors ancestry choices that are one
recombination away from these invalid ancestry choices.

To sum up, even partial pedigree knowledge causes a big
difference in analyzing genome ancestry. Though HAPPY can
conduct analysis rapidly, its results on complex pedigrees can be
biased. On the other hand, our method can provide a pedigree
consistent inference in comparable running time.

5.3 Running time performance

For a pedigree containing i inbreeding processes and n’ members not
involved in inbreeding, the time complexity of GAIN is 0(an’ x
22’1/ X 28’) where L is the number of SNP markers. For any G2Ik
animal in CC pedigree, the time complexity remains the same.
The running time does not depend on the error rate of genotype
data either. Figure 8 shows the running time comparison of GAIN,
MERLIN and HAPPY

6 DISCUSSION

The development of high—density SNP technology makes model
animal resources a powerful tool for studying genetic variations.
It also makes any analysis on such resources computationally
challenging. In this article, we demonstrate that modeling repetitive
substructure of a pedigree can provide signiﬁcant improvement
in efﬁciency without compromising accuracy. We introduce a

novel method for modeling the inbreeding process. Integrated into
the HMM framework originally introduced by the Lander—Green
algorithm, our method can handle large pedigrees such as CC
efﬁciently. The inbreeding substructure model alone does not speed
up the ancestry inference for all types of pedigrees, but, as we have
shown with the CC, the computational beneﬁt can be crucial for
analyzing many model animal resources. In analyzing such data,
our method outperforms previous methods in terms of accuracy and
efﬁciency. We believe that substructure modeling is a promising
approach for large pedigree analysis, especially when speciﬁc types
of pedigree are of interest. In the future, we plan to investigate other
common substructures and build a more general framework to allow
efﬁcient computation on more types of pedigrees.

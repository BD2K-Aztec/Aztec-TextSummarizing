ABSTRACT

Summary: The affordability of high-throughput sequencing has
created an unprecedented surge in the use of genomic data in basic,
translational and clinical research. The rapid evolution of sequencing
technology, coupled with its broad adoption across biology
and medicine, necessitates fast, collaborative interdisciplinary
discussion. SEQanswers provides a real-time knowledge-sharing
resource to address this need, covering experimental and
computational aspects of sequencing and sequence analysis.
Developers of popular analysis tools are among the >4000 active
members, and ~40 peer-reviewed publications have referenced
SEQanswers.

Availability: The SEQanswers community is freely accessible at
http://SEQanswers.com/

Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Human Genome Project represents one of the greatest concerted
achievements of the life sciences. This massive global effort
jump-started the genomics era and enabled more ambitious and
collaborative projects such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (Cancer
Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008), 1000 Genome Project
(1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010) and Human Microbiome
Project (The NIH HMP Working Group et al., 2009). These large
population-scale studies, powered by high-throughput sequencing
(HTS) technologies, have generated massive amounts of genomic
data with the potential to revolutionize genetics and medicine.

The translation of these data to actionable medicine, however, is
complicated by the challenges of extracting meaningful information
from HTS data (Mardis, 2010). The challenge is not purely
computational, as bioinformatics is bound by the experimental
methods employed to produce genomic data (Alkan et al., 2011).
A successful experiment minimizes false positives and depends on

the optimization of an entire pipeline, from sample preparation to
computational analysis.

As HTS begins to transform nearly all aspects of biological
and medical science, more labs will incorporate the production
and analysis of genomic data into their studies. However, these
experimental and computational methods are evolving at an
incredible pace and it is increasingly challenging for smaller research
groups outside of major genome centers to stay current. Real-time,
interdisciplinary collaboration helps large genome centers optimize
analysis pipelines and methods, and allows smaller groups to exploit
them, even if they did not have resources to facilitate the initial
development.

2 THE SEQANSWERS COMMUNITY

SEQanswers was launched in 2007 as an open forum to enable
scientists across disciplines to collaboratively advance genomics
and, particularly, HTS technologies. To date, there are >4000
active users Visiting the online community each month. There
is a rapidly growing number of discussion threads (currently
>10 000) that span topics from sequencing platforms, experimental
design, data analysis and biological interpretation (Fig. 1A).
The SEQanswers community is truly global (Supplementary
Fig. 81) and includes members from major genome centers
and individual groups, as well as key developers of popular
data analysis tools and methods. The community currently hosts
>300 new questions, and 1800 new responses per month. This
incredibly high rate of participation has led to rapid responses
to questions, shortening initial response time from a week in
early 2008 to less than a day in 2011 (Fig. 1B). Collaborative
and transparent discussion on SEQanswers has triggered the
development of new experimental techniques, data analysis methods
and pipelines, as well as collaborative assessment of analysis
standards (Supplementary Table S1). This innovation is captured in
part by >30 peer-reviewed publications that cite SEQanswers so far
(http://seqanswers.com/wiki/Papers_Referencing_SEQanswers).
SEQanswers is not the only online resource for knowledge sharing
and collaboration: major sequencing technology companies have
platform-centric user communities, but these are often restricted
to customers and exclude the greater scientiﬁc community. In
contrast, BioStar (Parnell et al., 2011), an open, community-driven

SEQanswers

 

bioinformatics resource, currently hosts >2300 threads, which far
exceeds the sum of discussions found on communities operated
by sequencing companies (Supplementary Table S2). BioStar’s
principle feature is to enable researchers to ask questions and obtain
brief answers, ranked by community vote, to bioinformatics-related
problems. BioStar’s success can be attributed to its well-deﬁned
scope and focus on a simple question and answer format for
bioinformatics. However, this format precludes other forms of
collaboration, discussion and debate.

SEQanswers differs from BioStar both in format and scope. In
an almost complementary capacity, SEQanswers eschews the Q&A
format in favor of a more traditional forum format to facilitate
collective discussion of technologies, methods and standards of
practice. The traditional forum format emphasizes the chronology
and evolution of collective thought, rather than focusing on
identifying a single, best answer. The scope of SEQanswers
differs from BioStar’s exclusive bioinformatics focus, including all
aspects of genomics, experimental and computational. Finally, in
recognition of the sometimes lengthy and tediously detailed threads
that can emerge from sequential discussion, we have developed
a manually curated database, SEQwiki (Li et al., 2012), that
consists of frequently asked questions, analysis methods, tutorials
and sequencing service providers.

3 CONCLUSION

The massive amounts of data and rapid pace of genome technology
development necessitates innovations in scientiﬁc communication.
The current standard for scientiﬁc communication between disparate
research groups focuses on peer-reviewed research published in
traditional scientiﬁc journals. These journals have evolved for the
Internet age, especially with the new emphasis on open access and
fast publishing from both new, exclusively open access journals
to traditional journals that have created new outlets for open
access publication. While scientiﬁc journals will continue to have
important roles as curators of research and referees for the peer-
reView process, there is an opportunity for open, internet—based
platforms to supplement traditional journals by enabling the rapid
exchange of results, techniques and data, the latter two being
crucial for advancing research,1 but notoriously difﬁcult to access.
SEQanswers was designed to address this need for genomics. The
community has since developed into a thriving community that
offers a wealth of information, including discussions that have
facilitated the construction of analysis pipelines and consensus on
standards in the genomics community.

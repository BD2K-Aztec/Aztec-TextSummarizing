Abstract

Summary: PPDMs is a resource that maps small molecule bioactivities to protein domains from
the Pfam-A collection of protein families. Small molecule bioactivities mapped to protein domains
add important precision to approaches that use protein sequence searches alignments to assist ap-
plications in computational drug discovery and systems and chemical biology. We have previously
proposed a mapping heuristic for a subset of bioactivities stored in ChEMBL with the Pfam-A
domain most likely to mediate small molecule binding. We have since refined this mapping using a
manual procedure. Here, we present a resource that provides up-to-date mappings and the possi-
bility to review assigned mappings as well as to participate in their assignment and curation. We
also describe how mappings provided through the PPDMs resource are made accessible through
the main schema of the ChEMBL database.

Availability and implementation: The PPDMs resource and curation interface is available at https://
www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/research/ppdms/pfam_maps. The source-code for PPDMs is available under
the Apache license at https://github.com/chembl/pfam_maps. Source code is available at https://
github.com/chembl/pfam_map_loader to demonstrate the integration process with the main
schema of ChEMBL.

1 Introduction

 

Systematic analyses of bioactive small molecules and their molecular
targets and homologues form the basis of a number of novel applica-
tions in computational drug discovery and systems and chemical
biology, including methods of target prediction (Martinez-Jimenez
et al., 2013), and for the establishment of functional relationships
between proteins (Kruger and Overington, 2012; Lin et al., 2013;
van der Horst et al., 2010). To add precision to these methods, we
have previously proposed a simple mapping heuristic of small mol-
ecule bioactivities to protein domains (Kruger et al., 2012). Here,
we present a full implementation of the mapping to a relevant subset

of biological assays stored in the current version of the ChEMBL
database (Bento et al., 2014). This implementation also accommo-
dates edge cases that were unaddressed in the original implementa-
tion—specifically cases where more than one Pfam-A domain could
mediate small molecule binding. In the refined implementation, such
cases were resolved manually. The PPDMs server provides a plat-
form to review and contribute manual assignments.

Previous computational approaches exist that link small mol-
ecule binding to specific protein domains, but these approaches use
information extracted from crystal structures of protein-ligand com-
plexes to transfer binding annotations between homologous proteins

Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of homology-based transfer of binding domain
annotation. The schematic shows how a catalogue of Pfam-A domains with
known small molecule interactions was mapped to protein sequences in the
ChEMBL target dictionary

(Davis and Sali, 2010; Finn et al., 2014; Snyder et al., 2006). More
recently, such approaches have been used to associate protein do-
mains based on ligands shared between them (Li et al., 2012; Moya-
Garcia and Ranea, 2013). PPDMs provides an alternative approach
that associates small molecule binding and protein domains based
on empirical evidence from literature reported measurements in bio-
logical assays. PPDMs has generated binding-domain annotations
for N770 k small molecule bioactivities which can be obtained from
the main schema of the ChEMBL database.

2 PPDMs enables improved mapping of ligand-
binding domains

The objective of the mapping heuristic is to annotate biological
assays reported in ChEMBL with the protein domain that medi-
ates small molecule binding. The heuristic is based on protein do-
main annotations provided through the Pfam-A collection of
sequence-based protein domains (Punta et al., 2012). As a first
step in the heuristic, a catalogue of Pfam-A domains capable of
small molecule binding was constructed from small molecule bio-
activities measured against single domain proteins from ChEMBL.
PPDMs offers a facility to refine the original catalogue by adding
Pfam-A domains that are known from other sources to interact
with small molecules but which are missing from the catalogue in
the original implementation. Vice-versa, Pfam-A domains can be
removed from the catalogue if evidence for small molecule binding
is deemed insufficient. For example, we adjusted the previously
applied potency threshold of 50 uM to a more stringent threshold
of 10 uM, corresponding to a pChEMBL value of 5, where
pChEMBL is defined as —log10(molar IC50, XC50, EC50, AC50,
Ki, Kd or Potency), see Bento et al. (2014). As a consequence, we
removed a number of domains associated with weak and poten-
tially non-specific binding. The catalogue and associated evidence
for small molecule binding can be reviewed in the ‘Evidence’
section of the PPDMs resource. In a second step, this catalogue
was mapped to proteins that are defined as targets in binding or
functional assays where the target is either a single protein or a
protein complex (defined through a relationship of type ‘D’) and
a pChEMBL value is assigned. This resulted in three possible
categories of outcomes (see also Fig. 1):

i. A successful mapping if exactly one of the Pfam-A domain mod-
els from the catalogue matches the sequence.
ii. No mapping if none of the Pfam-A domain models from the
catalogue match the sequence;
iii. A conﬂicting mapping if multiple domain models from the cata-
logue match the sequence.

Table 1. The table below summarizes how activities in the current
release distribute over the three possible outcomes

 

 

Outcome # All % All # Active % Active
i) Successful map 750 653 53.5 269 128 76.2
ii) Not mapped 625 135 44.5 63 010 17.9
iii) Conﬂicting map 28 327 2.0 20 839 5.9
Total 1404115 100 352 977 100

 

Columns headed ‘all’ represent all activities, whereas columns headed ‘ac-
tive’ represent activities from binding assays where pChEMBL is >5. %, per-
centage relative to total.

alTotal count.

Table 1 summarizes the distribution of measured activities across
these three categories. Despite their relatively small contribution to
the total of measured activities, protein architectures associated with
category iii-type outcomes form a subset of high relevance to drug
discovery, for example, many tyrosine kinases and ligand-gated ion
channels. In the ‘Conﬂicts’ section, PPDMs provides a facility to
manually assign mappings for such architectures on a per-assay
basis. For each assay, PPDMs provides an overview of the assay de-
tails, domain architecture of the associated target and a form to sub-
mit a manual assignment. Assignments can be reviewed in the ‘Logs’
section, with an option of revoking a previous curation decision.
User profiles ensure that accidental or deliberate assignment errors
can be rolled back on a per-user basis if necessary.

3 Integration with the ChEMBL database

The PPDMs workﬂow is decoupled from the release cycle of the
ChEMBL database. Assigned mappings can be exported from
PPDMs, by downloading the pfam_maps table using a link in the
logs section. Equally, an up-to-date version of the catalogue (table
name: valid_domains) can be downloaded from the evidence sec-
tion. For integration of mappings assigned using PPDMs into the
main schema of the ChEMBL database, a standardized procedure
exists. Prior to each ChEMBL release, the most recent version of the
catalogue is obtained from PPDMs. In a second step, it is applied to
proteins that are defined as targets in assays meeting the required
criteria. Finally, the set of manually assigned mappings is obtained
from the PPDMs resource and used to override mappings that have
been assigned by the default procedure.

4 Outlook

PPDMs provides a richer, domain-level perspective of small molecule
binding and enriches annotation of small molecule bioactivities stored
in the ChEMBL database. We anticipate that this type of annotation
will improve the precision of target prediction and efficacy modelling
approaches, and interpretation of the effects of natural genetic vari-
ation. PPDMs enables the refinement of domain-level annotation of
small molecule bioactivities in a facile and transparent manner. The
curation of conﬂicting mappings in PPDMs is ongoing and we are
hopeful that PPDMs can engage the community in reviewing and im-
proving domain-level annotations of small molecule bioactivities.

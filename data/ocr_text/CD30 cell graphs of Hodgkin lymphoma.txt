Abstract

Motivation: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a type of B—cell lymphoma. To diagnose the subtypes, biop—
sies are taken and immunostained. The slides are scanned to produce high—resolution digital whole
slide images (WSI). Pathologists manually inspect the spatial distribution of cells, but little is known
on the statistical properties of cell distributions in WSls. Such properties would give valuable infor—
mation for the construction of theoretical models that describe the invasion of malignant cells in
the lymph node and the intercellular interactions.

Results: In this work, we define and discuss HL cell graphs. We identify CD30+ cells in HL WSls,
bringing together the fields of digital imaging and network analysis. We define special graphs
based on the positions of the immunostained cells. We present an automatic analysis of complete
WSls to determine significant morphological and immunohistochemical features of HL cells and
their spatial distribution in the lymph node tissue under three different medical conditions: lymph—
adenitis (LA) and two types of HL. We analyze the vertex degree distributions of CD30 cell graphs
and compare them to a null model. CD30 cell graphs show higher vertex degrees than expected by
a random unit disk graph, suggesting clustering of the cells. We found that a gamma distribution is
suitable to model the vertex degree distributions of CD30 cell graphs, meaning that they are not
scale—free. Moreover, we compare the graphs for LA and two subtypes of HL. LA and classical HL
showed different vertex degree distributions. The vertex degree distributions of the two HL sub—
types NScHL and mixed cellularity HL (MXcHL) were similar.

CD30 cell graphs of HL are not scale-free

1 Introduction

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is one of the most common types of
lymphoid malignancies and one of the most common cancer types in
adolescents and younger adults (Liu et al., 2014). HL can be divided
into classical HL (cHL) and the rare nodular lymphocyte predomin-
ant HL forms.

In cHL, the tumor cells are called Hodgkin and Reed—Sternberg
(HRS) cells. HRS cells are often large and multinucleated with a
diameter of up to 100 pm. The mononucleated forms are smaller
with a diameter of about 20—30 pm (Drexler et al., 1986; Rengstl et
al., 2013). HRS cells usually originate from B cells (Kuppers et al.,
1994, 1995). In HL, tumor cells are distributed in the lymphoid tis—
sue and make up about 1% of the infiltrating cells in a background
of reactive bystander cells such as T—cells, B—cells, histiocytes and
others. The HRS cells are known to express CD30 and usually
CD15 (Falini et al., 1987). They also produce various chemokines
and cytokines which shape the microenvironment according to their
needs (Liu et al., 2014). A review of HL biology can be found in
Kuppers et al. (2012).

HRS cells can easily be detected by an antibody which is specific
for CD30. It is used for diagnosis of the subtypes. CD30 (Stein et al.,
1985) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family
(Durkop et al., 1992) and a marker for HL (Al-Shamkhani, 2004;
Chiarle et al., 1999). Malignant lymphomas are diagnostically
defined by morphology. Histological samples are visualized by light
microscopy and are interpreted by a trained pathologist according
to the rules of the World Health Organization (Swerdlow et al.,
2008) in the context of experience in the diagnostic field. NScHL
and MXcHL are differentiated by the presence of sclerotic bands in
NScHL, which confine at least one nodular compartment containing
typical HRS cells. In the absence of these sclerotic hands, a case is
assigned to the MXcHL category. CD30 is present not only in
lymphoid neoplasms but also on virus—infected lymphocytes and spe—
cial types of activated T cells (Horie and Watanabe, 1998). Thus,
the HRS cells form a subset of the CD307L cells. This explains that
CD30+ cells are also found in lymphadenitis (LA). LA with abun-
dant CD3 07L blasts and HL can be hard to distinguish.

Because of the spread of digital pathology, public databases of
HL whole slide images (WSIs) like the Cancer Digital Slide Archive
(Gutman et al., 2013), as well as internal databases at hospitals and
institutes like the Dr. Senckenbergisches Institut fur Pathologie, are
currently emerging. For some example WSIs, see Supplementary
Figures S2—S4 in the Supplementary Material. Here, we were inter—
ested in the distribution of CD30+ cells in WSIs of HL biopsies to
detect significant patterns of HRS cells in the tissue. We wanted to
explore the biological behavior of CD30+ cells under neoplastic
(HL) and reactive (LA) conditions. We focused on HL because the
clinical co—authors provided the data and have more than 30 years
of experience with HL.

We defined CD30 cell graphs based on CD307L cell positions
(See Section 3.5 for the exact definition of a cell’s position.) Many
biological phenomena can be represented as graphs, and graphs
have also been applied to model cell distributions and cancer. In
Gunduz et al. (2004), the authors have considered graphs based on
all cells in low—resolution brain tissue samples and have applied
them to classify the samples into tumor, inﬂammatory and healthy
tissue. For automated cancer diagnosis, an augmented version of the
method, using weighted graphs, has been published, representing
cell clusters instead of single cells (Demir and Yener, 2005 ; Demir et
al., 2005a, b). In Oztan et al. (2012), features extracted from nuclei—
and cytoplasm—based cell graphs have been used in combination

with other descriptors to grade follicular lymphoma. Texture—based
methods have been used to describe clinically relevant characteristics
of tissue (Ergen and Baykara, 2014; Fatima et al., 2014; Lessmann
et al., 2007). Texture—based methods do not explicitly determine cell
positions.

While cell detection is a very common task in biology, only a few
studies have tried to detect all cells in WSIs (Huang et al., 2011). In
Kong et al. (2009) and Sertel et al. (2009), neuroblastomas have
been classified based on WSIs. To the best of our knowledge, no sys—
tematic analysis of WSIs exists for HL.

Our approach uses cell positions to create cell graphs of CD307L
cells in WSIs. We use individual cells due to the low density of
CD307L cells in HL. In contrast to other graph—based methods, we
analyzed high-resolution images and did not rely on pre—selected re—
gions. This gave us the opportunity to gather data on the whole
lymph node in contrast to restrict the analysis to a specific region.

For reasons of clarity and comprehensibility, we divided the
Section 3 into five parts. A definition of cell graphs is given in
Section 3.1. Section 3.2 considers scale—freeness. Afterward, we de—
scribe a null model in Section 3.3. Section 3.4 introduces the image
format and the three image sets we analyzed. We brieﬂy describe
our imaging pipeline and its implementation in Section 3.5. Section
4 presents a validation of the imaging pipeline and the analysis of
the vertex degree distributions of the cell graphs.

2 Approach

We apply the concept of network theory to the spatial distribution
of CD307L cells in tissue. Our contribution includes the development
and validation of a new imaging pipeline, the definition and compu-
tation of cell graphs, the formulation and simulation of an appropri-
ate null model and the analysis of the vertex degree distributions of
the cell graphs.

We applied our imaging pipeline to WSIs of HL biopsies to de—
tect CD30+ cells. On the basis of the two—dimensional cell coordin-
ates, we constructed cell graphs for a selection of exemplary images
of two subtypes of HL and LA. First, we investigated whether the
distribution of CD30+ cells in the tissue differed from randomly dis-
tributed cells. We simulated an appropriate null model for each WSI
and compared it to the observed cell distribution. Second, we com—
pared the vertex degree distributions for two subtypes of HL and
LA. Third, we discussed the functional form of the vertex degree dis—
tributions and evaluated the compatibility of the distributions, using
standard models of network construction as, e.g. the scale—free
Barabasi—Alberts model (Albert and Barabasi, 2002).

3 Methods
3.1 Cell graphs

A cell graph represents the spatial distribution of one or several cell
types within the tissue. In this work, we considered the special case
of CD30L cells in images of HL. We thus called the resulting cell
graph the CD3 0 cell graph of an image. In a cell graph, G = (V, E),
each vertex 11 represents a cell at a position in space and an edge e
= (14,12) is created between a vertex pair 14, v, if the Euclidian dis-
tance between 14 and z/ is less than an edge threshold t. We set the
threshold, t, to 700 pixels, i.e. to 175 pm or, about 10 times the
diameters of an average cell. Figure 1 depicts an example cell graph
of an NScHL image. Here, we can clearly see the sclerotic regions of
the lymph node that dissect the cell graph into several connected
components.

The graph consists of several connected components, which are often sepa-
rated by sclerotic lymph node regions indicated by the arrows. A larger color
version of this image is available in the Supplementary Figure 812

Our definition of CD30 cell graphs applies the well—known
rules of unit disk graphs to connect vertices according to their
Euclidian distances. Unit disk graphs are intersection graphs of
equally sized circles in the plane (Clark et al., 1990) and have been
applied to model, e.g. broadcast networks (Kammerlander, 1984).
A generalization of unit disk graphs are geographical threshold
graphs that consider, beside the distances, the sum of weights
(Masuda et al., 2005). A similar approach would be possible for an
alternative definition of cell graphs because each vertex has prop—
erties like size and volume which could be interpreted as the weight
of the vertex. Topological properties like the small—world property
(Watts and Strogatz, 1998) and the scale—freeness (Barabasi and
Albert, 1999) have been demonstrated for geographical threshold
graphs even for vertices that are uniformly distributed in space
(Masuda et al., 2005 ). The strong influence of the construction
rules on topological structures of geographical threshold graphs
makes an interpretation of topological structures complicated for
non—homogeneously distributed cells in the tissue. The simplicity
of the statistical properties of unit disk graphs motivates our defin—
ition of CD30 cell graphs.

3.2 Vertex degree distribution and scale—freeness

Vertex degree distribution and scale—freeness are significant proper-
ties to describe large networks. The degree distribution of all vertices
of a network is denoted by [)(le) and gives the probability that a ran—
domly chosen vertex has the degree la. For randomly connected
Erdos—Rényi networks (Erdos and Rényi, 1959), [9(12) follows a
Poisson distribution.

Scale—free networks show highly inhomogeneous vertex degree
distributions, which follow a power law p(le) N le‘l, where y is
called the degree exponent (Barabasi and Albert, 1999). A model for
these graphs based on preferential attachment has been described by
Albert and Barabasi (2002). Biochemical networks have been found
to be scale—free, e.g. please refer to the work of Jeong et al. (2000)
and Guelzim et al. (2002). For most of the networks, the degree ex—
ponent lies between 2 and 3 (Steuer and Zamora—Lopez, 2008).

3.3 Null model and statistical analysis
A significant deviation from randomness is a prerequisite for the
statistical analysis and biological interpretation. Randomness would
mean that the WSI would give a snapshot of cells at random loca—
tions and any pattern would not be significant.

In first approximation, the positions of cells can be seen as a pla—
nar point pattern that results from a homogeneous Poisson point
process (Diggle, 1983). The position of each cell is chosen randomly,
each position is equally probable and the location of other cells is
ignored for the placement of a cell. Unit disk graphs (Clark et al.,
1990; Kammerlander, 1984; Yeh et al., 1984) are equivalents to cell
graphs of such random planar point patterns. The probability to
find la neighbors in a unit disk is given by a Poisson distribution

k
P0is(le, u) = e_“% (1)
where u is the mean number of neighbors in the disc. Networks with
Poisson distributed vertex degrees are not scale—free because m0—
ments of arbitrary order are defined for the Poisson distribution.

For a WSI with a mean density p of CD30+ cells at random pos—
itions, a Poisson distribution with parameter u = p 71: t2 would com—
pletely describe the vertex degree distribution of the cell graph.
Distortions from the Poisson distribution can be expected only from
the volume exclusion effect and effect of the border of the finite tis—
sue area.

The volume exclusion effect prevents an infinite growth of the
number of cells in the neighborhood. In the cell graph, the neighbor-
hood area of a cell has the size A : ml with t = 175 um, while the
area of the profile of a CD30+ cell in a WSI is typically
a = 349 umz. Consequently, a rough estimate for the maximal num-
ber of cells that may populate the neighborhood is A / a m 276. Since
u<<276 is true for all WSIs in our dataset, we can neglect the effect
of this theoretical upper bound on the expected Poisson distribution.

Cells located closer than 175 pm to the tissue border have a
reduced neighborhood area and contribute with a lower parameter
)1 < u to a superposition of Poisson distributions. They deform the
vertex degree distribution P0is(le, u) towards smaller degrees. To es—
timate this deformation, we performed 10 simulations of the homo—
genous Poisson point process for each WSI. We counted the number
of tiles that contained tissue in the WSI and computed the total size
of these tiles. For each cell in the WSI, we chose a new random pos—
ition in a rectangular area of identical size and computed a random
cell graph of the randomly generated spatial distribution of cells.
The gamma distribution

Ba lea—1 e—kB

g( $1713) ma) ( )
with vertex degree, la, rate parameter, or, and shape parameter, 8, is
a generalization of the exponential distribution which has been used
to model populations in biology (Dennis and Patil, 1984; Engen and

Lande, 1996).

3.4 Image data

The Dr. Senckenbergisches Institut ﬂir Pathologie provided the in—
put images for our study. The lymph node sections were double—
stained with hematoxylin and a fuchsine immunostaining, targeting
CD30. This is a standard procedure used in the diagnosis of HL.
The tissue samples were digitized using an Aperio ScanScope device
(LeicaBiosystems, 2011). The output image format was a pyramidal
format containing several resolution levels of the same field of view,
see Supplementary Figure S1 1a. At level 0, the WSIs had a resolution
of 0.25 pm per pixel and dimensions of up to 100 000 X 100 000
pixels. Performing a cell detection in the complete WSI requires a
very high image quality. In contrast, for the diagnosis, only a few
cells are inspected in detail by pathologists. We pre—selected and

analyzed 35 WSIs of good quality. Pathologists diagnosed and
labeled each image, resulting in three separate image sets, each of
which consists of at least 11 images. Two sets represent the most
common subtypes of cHL, MXcHL and NScHL. The third set con—
tains LA cases. The latter can be seen as control group, as LA is an
inﬂammation of the lymph node and the typical immune response
for many diseases, e.g. bacterial and viral infections.

3.5 Imaging pipeline

To detect all CD307L cells in the WSI, we developed a software solu—
tion in Java, using the Openslide library in combination with the
Java Advanced Imaging API (Goode and Satyanarayanan, 2008)
and an interface to CellProfiler2 (Lamprecht et al., 2007). The soft—
ware ran on a Linux cluster (10 nodes, 80 cores, up to 128 GB
RAM/node, OpenSuSE 13.1 64 bit) to process large images in paral—
lel. It performed preprocessing, split the large WSI into tiles and de—
tected cells in those tiles. The positions of all cells were stored in a
database. Runtimes were in the range of a few hours for the analysis
of an image.

3.5.1 Generation of image tiles from the WSI

A WSI of highest resolution may exceed a size of 30 GB and is too
large to fit into the memory of today’s standard computers.
Therefore, we covered the image by smaller tiles, which we exported
to standard TIFF files. We used these files as input images for the
cell detection step. We generated tiles with a core area of
1024 x 1024 pixels, i.e. 236 x 236 umz, plus a border of 100 pixels,
i.e. 25 pm at highest resolution. Supplementary Figure S11b sketches
the cover of an image by tiles. The overlapping borders ensured that
we did not ignore cells that were cut by a border. Cells in the over—
lapping area could lead to duplicate entries for a cell. If several cells
shared the same position, we kept only one of them. The processing
of the tiles did not have any effect on the resulting graphs or detected
cells. The splitting of the image was required for parallelization and
to reduce the memory needed to open a single image.

3.5.2 Preprocessing

The input images contained stained tissue in front of a bright back—
ground. Many of them showed artifacts like air bubbles, small tissue
fragments and stain residues. We identified the region of interest
(ROI), i.e. the tissue sections, in the image on the second resolution
level. The ROI was defined using a minimal distance to mean ap—
proach based on brightness and saturation pixel descriptors (Schafer
et al., 2013). The image was segmented into tissue and brighter, less
saturated background. For each tile, we checked whether it con—
tained enough tissue pixels. Only tiles with at least 100 tissue pixels
were considered to be part of the ROI. In the next step, we applied a
region growth algorithm (Gonzalez and Woods, 2008) to combine
adjacent tissue tiles into a single object, representing a tissue section.
All tissue sections smaller than 4 mm2 were considered as artifacts
and filtered.

3.5.3 Cell detection

For the image tiles of the WSI, we initially applied a color deconvo—
lution to split the image into the three channels hematoxylin, new
fuchsine and non—specific background. We saved the new fuchsine
channel as a CD30 gray—scale image.

Because of differences in the degree of staining and exposure,
the thresholds used for segmentation were adapted for each WSI.
We tried several methods to determine the thresholds: the MoG
Global method, adaptive threshold and manual determination. The

MoG Global method and the adaptive threshold method, both pro—
vided by CellProfiler2, did not perform well. Because of the inhomo—
geneous staining of the images and the high differences of cell
counts within the image tiles, the two algorithms failed to calculate
a suitable threshold. Thus, we used manual thresholds applied by
the first authors (HS. and TS.) independently. For each pixel that
had an intensity above the threshold, we applied a region growth al—
gorithm based on a four—connected neighborhood to identify the
profile of a CD30+ cell.

The identified connected areas of high intensity included frag—
ments that were too small to represent a cell. We filtered them by
discarding small objects with an area of <1750 pixels (about 110
umz). All remaining objects were considered cells in the image. For
each cell, we computed the x and y coordinates of its center of grav—
ity and call them the cell’s position. Supplementary Figures S6—S11
illustrate the steps of the pipeline.

We manually marked all cells in a set of randomly chosen image
tiles. For validation purposes, we compared the cells detected by our
pipeline to the results of manual cell labeling. We counted the num—
ber of true positives, TP, false positives, FP, and false negatives, FN.
As quality criteria for our automated cell detection, we determined
values of precision and sensitivity according to

. . _ TP d .t. .t _ TP
prec1s10n — TP + FP an sens1 1v1 y — TP + FN.

4 Results and discussion

4.1 Image properties

The total number of cells varied in the range of a few hundred cells
up to more than 90 000 CD30+ cells per image. The average size of
the CD30+ cells was 294 umz. Besides the total number of cells, the
cell density also fluctuated significantly within our set of 35 images.
The cell density was measured as number of cells per cm2 in the ROI
(see Supplementary Fig. S1). Table 1 gives values averaged over all
images of the two HL subtypes, MXcHL and NScHL, and LA, re-
spectively. The highest mean value of 104.3 cells per cm2 was meas—
ured for MXcHL, whereas the lowest value of 28.8 cells per cm2
was observed for LA. The mean value of 74.7 cells per cm2 for
NScHL laid between the values for MXcHL and LA. Within each
subgroup of disease, the cell density varied significantly from image
to image. Standard deviations of 72%, 70% and 105% were meas—
ured for the mean cell densities of MXcHL, NScHL and LA,
respectively.

There are a number of effects which may be responsible for the
high variety of cell densities. First, the staining quality of the images
varies significantly and inﬂuences the outcome of the cell detec—
tion pipeline. Second, our input data are an arbitrarily chosen

2D cross—section and planar view on a spatial distribution of cells in
the complex 3D structure of a lymph node. Third, the progression of
disease is unknown. Since we work with human data, each image
represents the state when HL or LA was diagnosed for the patient.
Information on the duration and progression of the disease is lack—
ing. Fourth, each image shows the distribution of CD30+ cells in a
single lymph node only.

The high variety of the cell densities may have an impact on the
results. The number of high—quality images available for the study
does not allow a further separation of the images into groups of
similar cell density.

4.2 Validation of the imaging pipeline
We validated the image processing outcome for three images, one
of each image set. Table 2 lists the overall values for cell counts,
precision and sensitivity, respectively. For all three images, the
total precision is 0.84 and the total sensitivity is 0.95. These
values are satisfactorily high when compared with benchmark val-
ues of 61% for precision and sensitivity in the AMIDA13 challenge
where the harder task has been to detect mitosis events (Veta et al.,
2015

Figure 2 illustrates the results for the image of the medical sub—
type NscHL. Each column in Figure 2 shows the fraction of FN, FP
and TP separately for various tiles of the image. For each randomly
chosen tile, its relative coordinates in the WSI are encoded on the x—
axes. The results are very heterogeneous. The fraction of TP is high,
i.e. about 80%, for some tiles, but drops to 15—30% for other tiles.
By visual inspection of the tiles with low fraction of TP, we observed
a low degree of staining (see Supplementary Fig. S5). The pipeline
applied an overall intensity threshold for a WSI and thus failed to
detect cells with very low staining. It is worth mentioning that de-
tecting all cells in a WSI is much more complex than detecting cells
in small, preselected image regions. Apart from technical challenges
due to the image size and differences in staining between the WSIs,
the varying degree of staining within a single image in combination
with the large differences in cell counts made it difficult to find
thresholds for segmenting the images automatically. The CD307L
cells we are interested in are also very variable in shape and size, and
they cluster very tightly in some areas. This makes object—based de—
tection difficult, as previously reported for macrophages in breast
cancer (Kruger et al., 2013). Using manually selected thresholds, our
pipeline was able to reach good precision and sensitivity for the ma—
jority of image tiles.

4.3 CD30 cell graph properties

The number of edges in the graphs ranged from some hundreds to
several millions of edges. For all images, the mean cluster coefficient
was 0.67, with a standard deviation of 0.05. The mean distance of a
cell to its closest neighbor differed for the medical subtypes. The
mean distances were 61:10 pm, 43:12 pm and 38:6 pm for LA,
MXcHL and NScHL, respectively.

NScHL 686 155 81 0.81 0.89
LA 921 137 18 0.87 0.98
All 2559 481 111 0.84 0.95

 

4.4 CD30 cell graphs are not random

Figure 3 shows exemplary vertex degree distributions [)(le) for the
cell graph of an image of LA (part a), NScHL (part b) and MXcHL
(part c). Each of these distributions deviates significantly from the
Poisson distribution P0is(le, u) with parameter ,u chosen according to
the mean density of CD30+ cells. The error bars in Figure 3 show
the effect of the finite tissue area on the Poisson distribution. The
simulated vertex degree distributions turn out to be indistinguish—
able from the Poisson distribution. A sufficient proof for the non-
randomness of a cell graph is the significant deviation of the vertex
degree distribution from the corresponding Poisson distribution that
we observed for all images.

4.5 CD30+ cells cluster in the tissue

For each WSI, the average vertex degree of the CD30 cell graphs is
higher than expected from a homogeneous density of CD3 0+ cells in
the tissue (Fig. 3). The high vertex degree suggests that CD30+ cells
form clusters in the tissue. A spatial clustering is in accordance with
our expectation from the visual inspection of the images. Looking at
the distribution of CD307L cells in different subtypes, cells in images
of NScHL showed a pronounced spatial clustering, while they were
more homogeneously distributed in images of LA. For MXcHL, the
cells appeared to be significantly clustered for some images but more
evenly distributed for other images.

Several possible causes for the clustering of the cell came to
mind. First, clustering could be related to cell division in combin—
ation with relatively immobile cells: a few CD307L cells appear at or
migrate into a lymph node. Once in place, they become immobile.
When the CD30+ cells divide, the resulting daughter cells stay close
to each other, leading to a clustering in the area. Second, another
possibility would be attraction between mobile cells or attraction of
mobile cells to certain areas in the lymph node: the CD30+ cells
move through the lymph node tissue and form clusters in regions
they are attracted to. Further investigations, targeting the mobility
of the malignant cells and cell—cell communication, are necessary to
understand the underlying process.

In the case of NScHL, the high degree of clustering could also be
inﬂuenced by the sclerotic bands that are typical for this subtype of
HL. The overall cell density is very low in the sclerotic regions,
which are devoid of CD30+ cells, and these cells cluster even more

Fig. 3. Exemplary vertex degree distributions p(k) for the cell graph of an
image of lymphadenitis (a), nodular sclerosis (b) and mixed cellularity (c).
The filled circles depict the observed degree distribution. The distribution
deviates significantly from the corresponding Poisson distribution (null
model, dotted line) but is much better described by the gamma distribution
(solid line). We simulated unit disk graphs according to the null model. The
error bars illustrate the mean and standard deviation of 10 simulations

in the rest of the tissue. For further investigations, mitosis markers
like Ki—67 (Gerdes et al., 1983) could be used.

4.6 CD30 cell graphs are not scale—free

We found that a gamma distribution best describes the vertex degree
distributions, see e.g. Fig. 3. Moments of arbitrary degrees exist for
this two—parameter exponential family and hence, the CD30 cell
graphs are not scale—free. In contrast to biochemical networks which
are scale—free, cell graph do not exhibit that property.

between the disease types

In CD30 cell graphs, high probabilities for a large vertex degree are
typical for NScHL, while low values are typical for LA. This is not a
surprising result because most LA images show a considerably lower
density of CD30+ cells than NScHL and MXcHL. It is, however,
notable that NScHL graphs often exhibited high vertex degrees even
though their mean cell density is comparably low. This could be
related to the inhomogeneous distribution of CD30+ cells in NScHL
with dense cell clusters, see e.g. Fig. 1.

In Figure 4, the rate and shape parameters of the gamma distri—
bution are plotted for all images. Shape parameter values between 0
and 2 are typical for LA cases. The rate parameter lies below 0.21
for all NScHL cases. Note that LA could be separated from the cHL
cases quite well.

5 Conclusion

In this article, we describe the first systematic, graph—based explor—
ation of stained cancer tissue, here, of CD30—stained tissues of HL.
Our contributions are (i) the automated analysis of WSIs, using an
own image pipeline, (ii) the definition of a graph—based data struc—
ture, the CD30 cell graphs, to abstract from images, which enables
for computational analysis, (iii) the statistical analysis of the cell
graphs which shows that they differ significantly from randomly
generated cell graphs, (iv) the analysis of vertex degree distributions
in the cell graphs which follow a gamma distribution and are thus
not scale—free, which is unusual for biological networks and (v) the
application to HL subtypes which shows unexpected results.

We performed an image analysis on a dataset of HL images to
detect CD30+ cells. MXcHL cases had the highest average cell dens—
ity, followed by NScHL. The LA cases showed considerably lower
CD30+ cell densities than the two forms of cHL.

We defined a new data structure, the cell graph, which describes
the spatial neighborhood of cells. We analyzed the vertex degree dis—
tributions of CD30 cell graphs. The comparisons with Poisson distri—
butions indicate that the distributions in cell graphs differ
significantly from those of simulated unit disk graphs. The vertex
degree distributions of cell graphs follow a gamma distribution for
which moments of arbitrary degree exist. This finding rules out the
hypothesis of scale—free cell graph networks.

Scale—free network models, e.g. the Barabasi—Albert model, are
not suitable to describe the complex, cooperative system of cells in
the HL tissue. This means that no key regulators exist in the net—
work of HL cells. The lack of key regulators could mean that the dis—
tribution of CD30 cells is mainly influenced by external factors, e.g.
the lymph node structure or the microenvironment. If the CD30 cells
shape the network topology, they all show a similar behavior.

We found that the CD30+ cells cluster in the tissue, and the clus—
tering is usually high for NScHL and low for LA. The reason is un—
known. We discuss several possible scenarios: high proliferation and
rather immobile cells, or mobile cells which are attracted to each
other or to certain lymph node regions. For NScHL, the sclerotic
bands may increase the clustering of CD30+ cells in the non-
sclerotic lymph node tissue.

We demonstrate that cell graphs enable the analysis of HL tissue
properties. The investigation of the vertex degree distributions in
cell graphs already gave new insights. The cell graph concept can be
extended by data on locations of other cell types from the tumor
micro—environment and blood vessels to help in better understanding
how tumor cells spread through the lymph system.

Findings of this investigation provide objective parameters
for CD30+ cells in HL. The method can be extended for differ—
ent immuno cell types, their shapes and localizations as well as
their interactions. These data can be used for a deeper understand—
ing of the biological meaning of interactions between CD30+
tumor cells and possibly also in the future to assess the impact of
antitumor drugs, help with the prognosis and develop new
therapies.

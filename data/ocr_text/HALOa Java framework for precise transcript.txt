ABSTRACT

Summary: Recent improvements in experimental technologies now
allow measurements of de novo transcription and/or RNA decay at
whole transcriptome level and determination of precise transcript
half-lives. Such transcript half-lives provide important insights into
the regulation of biological processes and the relative contributions of
RNA decay and de novo transcription to differential gene expression.
In this article, we present HALO (Half-life Organizer), the first
software for the precise determination of transcript half-lives from
measurements of RNA de novo transcription or decay determined
with microarrays or RNA-seq. In addition, methods for quality control,
filtering and normalization are supplied. HALO provides a graphical
user interface, command-line tools and a well-documented Java
application programming interface (API). Thus, it can be used both
by biologists to determine transcript half-lives fast and reliably
with the provided user interfaces as well as software developers
integrating transcript half-life analysis into other gene expression
profiling pipelines.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcript levels in a cell are determined by a constant turnover
driven by de nava synthesis by polymerases and degradation by
nucleases. While constant transcript levels are due to an equilibrium
between RNA synthesis and decay, changes in transcript levels
reﬂect alterations in either of them (Ross, 1995). While standard
gene expression proﬁling methods now allow measurements of
total RNA levels on a genome—wide scale, they cannot distinguish
whether changes in total RNA levels are due to changes in de nava
transcription or RNA decay.

Previously, RNA decay rates have been determined by arresting
transcription and subsequently monitoring ongoing RNA decay over
time (Bernstein et al., 2002; Narsai et al., 2007; Raghavan et al.,
2002; Redon et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2003).
This is based on the assumption that RNA decay is not affected

by transcription inhibition. However, it has been shown that a
stress response, such as, e.g. induced by transcriptional arrest, can
lead to a substantial stabilization of individual transcripts (Blattner
et al., 2000; Gorospe et al., 1998). Alternatively, nuclear run—on
assays have been used to measure de nava transcription and the
relative contributions of transcription rate and mRNA decay to
steady—state mRNA levels (Fan et al., 2002; Garcia—Martinez et al.,
2004; Molina—Navarro et al., 2008). Recently, new methods have
been introduced for the non—disruptive quantiﬁcation of de nava
transcription based on biosynthetic labeling (RNA tagging) of newly
transcribed RNA with 4—thiouracil (4tU; Cleary et al., 2005) or
4—thiouridine (4sU; Dblken et al., 2008; Kenzelmann et al., 2007).
After labeling newly transcribed RNA, total RNA can be separated
into the labeled newly transcribed RNA and the unlabeled pre—
existing RNA and de nava transcription and decay can be quantiﬁed
in a single experimental setting.

Using any of these methods, transcript half—lives, i.e. the speed
of RNA turnover, can be determined for individual genes and the
relative contributions of transcription rate and RNA decay to gene
expression regulation can be evaluated. In this way, alterations
of RNA decay have been conﬁrmed as an important regulatory
mechanism for many genes (Fan et al., 2002; Molina—Navarro et al.,
2008). Moreover, as transcript half—lives are correlated to gene
function and regulation (Friedel et al., 2009; Narsai et al., 2007;
Redon et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2003), they can provide interesting
insights into differential regulatory mechanisms for closely related
genes (Friedel et al., 2009) and the regulation of protein complexes
(Friedel et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2002).

In this article, we present HALO (Half—life Organizer), a
software environment for the calculation of transcript half—lives
from measurements of total RNA levels, de nava transcription or
RNA decay obtained with any of the above described methods. As
it is independent of the quantiﬁcation method used in the process,
it can be applied both to microarray and RNA—seq measurements.
In addition, it provides methods for ﬁltering and normalization of
data and quality control of the microarray or RNA—seq experiments.
Moreover, these algorithms are not restricted to RNA half—lives.
Recent improvements in proteomics technologies, particularly stable
isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC; Mann,
2006; Ong et al., 2002) will soon be suitable to measure protein
half—lives based on newly synthesized to total protein ratios. To
support these developments, HALO has been designed to be easily
extendable to new methods. Thus, it will prove valuable for further
studies on the role of half—lives in the regulation of many biological
processes.

2 METHODS

HALO takes as input whole transcriptome data of total, newly transcribed
and/or pre—existing RNA either from microarray experiments or RNA—Seq
which have been preprocessed using standard methods. For microarray data,
preprocessing includes background correction, a ﬁrst normalization and
probe—level summarization, e. g. with GC—RMA (Wu and Irizarry, 2004). For
RNA—seq data, this requires read mapping and calculation of RNA levels
from read counts. Since the input to HALO are the ﬁnal quantiﬁed RNA
levels for either genes, individual exons or probe sets, it is independent of
the experimental method used to obtain these levels. As transcript half—lives
can be calculated from either newly transcribed to total RNA ratios, newly
transcribed to pre—existing RNA ratios or pre—existing to total RNA ratios,
measurements of any two of the three RNA fractions are sufﬁcient. However,
to fully exploit the quality control and normalization methods of HALO, all
three RNA fractions have to be measured. See Figure l for an outline of the
individual steps involved in half—life calculation.

In the ﬁrst step, a quality control can be applied to check for an
experimental bias in measuring newly transcribed or pre—existing RNA
[Quality control (1)]. For RNA tagging, for instance, capture of newly
transcribed RNA depends on sufﬁcient incorporation of 4tU or 4sU. Thus,
insufﬁcient labeling of short transcripts with low uracil content may lead to
reduced capture rates for these transcripts and a bias in calculating transcript
half—lives. To check for this kind of bias, the number of uracils for each
transcript calculated from transcript sequences can be compared against
newly transcribed to total RNA ratios. A potential bias can then be corrected
with HALO using the regression method proposed by Miller et al. (2009).
Another quality control can be applied based on the relationship between
newly transcribed, pre—existing and total RNA if all three RNA fractions have
been measured. Since newly transcribed and pre—existing RNA should sum
up to total RNA, a negative linear correlation should be observed between
newly transcribed/total RNA and pre—existing/total RNA ratios.

Using this negative correlation, ratios of newly transcribed/total RNA
and pre—existing/total RNA can be easily normalized using linear regression
analysis (Dolken et al. , 2008) [Normalization (2)]. This second normalization
step is necessary as amounts of template RNA differ between newly
transcribed RNA, pre—existing RNA and total RNA samples. If only two
of the RNA fractions have been measured (e. g. newly transcribed and total
RNA), ratios can be normalized based on median transcript half—life.

Before normalization, unreliable measurements for individual genes,
exons or probe sets can be ﬁltered based on absent calls and/or low
expression values [Filtering (3)]. In addition, ﬁltering can be performed
after normalization using a quality score calculated for each gene, exon or

probe set based on the distance of the corresponding ratios from the linear
regression line. The smaller the distance, the higher the quality score. Again,
this requires measurements for all three RNA fractions. Both ﬁltering and
normalization steps can be easily extended by new methods.

In the ﬁnal step, transcript half—lives are calculated from the normalized
ratios using an exponential decay model [Half—life calculation (4)]. Half—lives
can be calculated either from pre—existing to total RNA, newly transcribed to
total RNA or newly transcribed to pre—existing RNA ratios. The latter method
combines the overall high precision of the newly transcribed to total RNA
ratios with the higher precision for short transcript half—lives of pre—existing
to total RNA ratios which otherwise are unreliable for medium—to—long—lived
transcripts (Friedel and Dolken, 2009). Normalization and transcript half—life
calculation can be performed individually for each replicate or for average
measurements.

To analyze the results, plots can be created for quality control, the
normalization with linear regression analysis and the distribution of quality
scores and ﬁnal transcript half—lives [Visualization (5)].

HALO is implemented in Java and provides several user interfaces to
perform all of these steps in a straightforward way. The graphical user
interface (GUI) is also available as a Java webstart version that can be started
directly from the web—browser without installing the package. Furthermore,
a set of command—line tools are included for script and batch usage and all
methods of HALO are accessible via a well—documented Java application
programming interface (API).

3 CONCLUSION

HALO is an extensible Java framework providing state—of—the—
art methods for transcript half—life calculation as well as quality
control, ﬁltering and normalization. It can be used as a stand—
alone tool or can be integrated into other gene expression proﬁling
frameworks. The intuitive GUI makes it accessible for users without
programming skills aiming to calculate transcript half—lives in a
fast and straightforward way from new measurements of de nava
synthesis and/or decay both for microarrays or RNA— seq. In addition,
researchers developing new software programs and methods can
easily incorporate and extend the available methods of HALO in
their own programs. Thus, HALO will be a valuable tool for the
analysis of transcript half—lives and, thus, an important prerequisite
for the analysis of the regulation of biological systems.

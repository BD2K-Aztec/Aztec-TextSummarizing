ABSTRACT

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulatory
molecules. A critical step in elucidating miRNA function is identifying
potential miRNA targets. However, few reliable tools have been
developed for identifying miRNA targets in plants.

Results: Here, we developed a Smith—Waterman-like alignment tool
in order to accurately predict miRNA targets. Dynamic programming
was used to build a score matrix based on the complementarity
of nucleotides in order to trace the optimal local alignments.
Important parameters, such as maximum mismatches and maximum
consecutive mismatches between miRNAs and their targets, were
also used for filtering the optimal local alignments. Almost all of
the parameters in this alignment tool can be adjusted by users.
Compared to other target prediction tools, Target-align exhibits
strong sensitivity and accuracy for identifying miRNA targets. More
importantly, Target-align can identify multi-target sites as well
potential for non-cleaved targets sites by change the default settings.
Windows, web and command-line versions were developed to better
serve different users.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an extensive class of small regulatory
molecules that post—transcriptionally regulate gene expression
by either cleaving mRNA transcripts or by repressing protein
translation. Currently, a total of 16 978 miRNAs have been deposited
in the miRNA database, miRBase (Grifﬁths—Jones et al., 2008). Of
these, 2600 are from plants. Although increasing evidences have
demonstrated that miRNAs play important roles in plant growth
and development, the functions of the majority of these miRNAs
remains unknown mainly due to a lack of knowledge of miRNA
targets.

Although many computational tools have been developed for
predicting animal miRNA targets, few tools are available for
identifying plant miRNA targets (Zhang et al., 2006). There are
currently three tools [miRU (Zhang, 2005), Helper tools (Moxon
et al., 2008) and TAPIR (Bonnet et al., 2010)] available for
predicting plant miRNA targets; however, these programs have
a limited set of options that allow the user to adjust the search
criteria. Previous studies demonstrated that most plant miRNAs

cleave targets by perfectly or near—perfectly binding to their target
(Rhoades et al., 2002; Schwab et al., 2005). Thus, all the three
currently available tools predict plant miRNA targets based on
very strictly limited criteria. However, recent studies show that
some miRNAs may inhibit translation by non—perfectly binding to
target mRNAs with more potential target sites (Brodersen et al.,
2008; Montgomery et al., 2008; Yu and Wang, 2010). Thus, a new
computational program needs to be developed for identifying plant
miRNAs with more ﬂexible criteria. In this study, we developed an
alignment tool named Target—align to integrate all potential factors
inﬂuencing plant miRNA target prediction. Target—align is user—
friendly and allows users to set a variety of parameters including
alignment score setting, maximum score, number of consecutive
mismatches, base site restrictions, number of G:U wobbles and
number of gaps.

2 METHODS

The Target—align algorithm is similar to the Smith—Waterman algorithm
(Smith and Waterman, 1981). Brieﬂy, the algorithm ﬁrst calculates a score
for a speciﬁc miRNA and their potential targets (please refer details in the
Supplementary Material). Then, the speciﬁc criteria are used to identify
potential plant miRNA targets. When determining the optimal alignments
and ﬁltering the results, following special characteristics for plant miRNAs
and their targets were considered according to previously established
methods: :4 mismatches between the miRNA and its targets, :2 consecutive
mismatches in the alignment region, no mismatches between bases 10—11;
51 mismatch from bases 1—9, 56 G:U wobbles, and :4—nt gaps. A G:U
wobble is only considered to be a 0.5 mismatch when calculating the total
number of mismatches. In order to allow variance on the analysis of target
genes, all of the above parameters were created so that they can be set by
individual users.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Features of Target-align

Target—align was developed in C#, based on the .NET framework
3.0 of Microsoft (www.microsoft.com). The program should be run
under the .NET framework 3.0 or on a higher .NET framework
version. The interface of Target—align is very user—friendly. All of
the parameters can be adjusted by individual users. Users can input
both miRNA and mRNA sequences in order to do single target
prediction, or they can upload ﬁles of miRNA and mRNA sequences
and perform target prediction in batch form. However, all of the
sequences in the ﬁles are required to be in FASTA format. Depending
on the user’s preference for considering G:U wobble base—pairing,
Target—align allows users to turn on or turn off the G:U wobble
calculation. Once G:U wobble base—pairing is canceled, the G:U
wobble score, maximum number of G:U wobbles, and mismatch

Target—align is available as a web version and command—line version.
Users can open the tool in their program with a command—line as
long as related parameters are assigned.

3.2 Output of alignment results

The output report includes the length of the miRNA and query
sequence, total score, number of mismatches, number of gaps,
number of G:U wobbles, and alignment results (Fig. 1). For
traditional alignment tools like BLAST, WATER and FASTA, target
sequences are often viewed incompletely due to end mismatches
that are not considered. This leads to difﬁculty in calculating the
exact number of mismatches between the miRNA and its potential
target genes. Target—align prints the full query (miRNA) sequence
and the target site sequence is extended to match the ends of the
query sequence if there are mismatches at the ends.

3.3 Validation of Target-align

To test and compare the Target—align program to existing tools
for plant miRNA target prediction, we tested Target—align with
102 validated miRNA—target pairs, as reported in TAPIR (Bonnet
et al., 2010). When Target—align was used to search against the

whole Arabidopsis transcriptome (TAIR annotation version 9,
http://www.arabidopsis.org/), 95 of the 102 miRNA—target pairs
(93.14%) from the reference set were detected with a false positive
rate of 57.8%. By adjusting the maximum number of mismatches
allowed (from 1 to 2) between bases 1 and 9, four additional miRNA—
target pairs were detected; however, this change also increased the
false positive rate from 57.8% to 84.0%. Finally, only three miRNA—
target pairs were missed. According to TAPIR statistic results for
sensitivity and speciﬁcity, the average amount of true positives
obtained for FASTA and RNAhybrid were 91.83% and 93.14%,
respectively, whereas the average amount of false positives for
FASTA and RNAhybrid were 81.47% and 88.97%, respectively.
Srn target and miRU were also tested by Bonnet and his co—
workers (Bonnet et al., 2010). One independent study showed that
the average rate of true positives for miRU was 78.1% with a
corresponding average false positive rate of 83.23% (Zhang, 2005).
Another study determined that the average rate of true positives
obtained by Srna target was 82.4 % with a 68.3% report of false
positives (Moxon et al., 2008). For Target—align, however, the
true positive rate is 93.14% with a 57.8% false positive report.
Therefore, Target—align exhibits better sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
This is because more factors are considered by Target—align. By
placing restrictions and parameters on the miRNA binding site, many
false positive miRNA—target pairs were avoided.

Target—align can also identify multi—target sites (one miRNA
may have multiple binding locations in a single target mRNA) as
well potential for non—cleaved targets sites by changing the default
settings, which are usually missed using other tools.

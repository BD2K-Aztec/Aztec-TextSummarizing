ABSTRACT

Summary: High-throughput genome-wide studies of alternatively
spliced mRNA transcripts have become increasingly important in
clinical research. Consequently, easy-to-use software tools are
required to process data from these studies, for example, using
exon and junction arrays. Here, we introduce JE'I'I'A, an integrated
software package for the calculation of gene expression indices
as well as the identification and visualization of alternative splicing
events. We demonstrate the software using data of human liver and
muscle samples hybridized on an exon—junction array.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent developments of high—throughput technologies, such as
exon—junction arrays (Clark et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2011) and
RNA—Seq (Wang et al., 2008), have extended transcriptome studies
in biomedical research beyond the scope of gene expression.
These genomic platforms enable the genome—wide measurements
of alternative splicing (AS), the process by which individual exons
of the same gene are spliced to produce different isoforms of mRNA
transcripts, in clinical samples and animal disease models. This, in
turn, requires computational algorithms and software tools for data
analyses and visualization.

We have developed an integrated software package, JETTA, that
provides a one—stop solution for gene expression and AS analyses of
microarray data, from raw data ﬁles to visualization. The software
provides many options for array normalization, probe selection,
background correction, expression index computation, AS detection
and data visualization. It can also be potentially utilized for AS
detections from RNA—Seq data. Here, we describe JETTA in an
analysis of human liver and muscle tissues assayed on a custom
exon—junction GG—H array (Xu et al., 2011).

2 SOFTWARE OVERVIEW

JETTA consists of two major modules: array calculator and AS
analyzer (Fig. 1A). The array calculator supports commercial and
custom exon and exon—junction arrays compatible with Affymetrix

oligonucleotide array design. It calculates the expression indices
of genes, exons and junctions from raw probe intensities. The AS
analyzer detects and visualizes AS events between conditions. In
addition, JETTA takes as input pre—calculated expression indices
of individual samples measured by RNA—Seq and performs AS
analyses between study groups.

The array calculator computes the expression indices through the
steps of background correction, normalization and summarization.
For background modeling, GCBIN (Clark et al., 2007) and MAT
(Kapur et al., 2007) are included, both of which use linear
models based on probe sequences to estimate the background
level. Similarly, quantile (Irizarry et al., 2003) and median—
scaling normalization (Kapur et al., 2007) are the two options for
normalization. The processed probe signals are then summarized
to gene—, exon— or junction—level expression levels using either Li—
Wing ﬁtting (Li and Wong, 2001), probe selection (Xing et al., 2006)
or median—polish algorithms (Irizarry et al., 2003).

The AS analyzer takes in expression indices from either the
output of the array calculator for microarray data or similar
results calculated by other tools for RNA—Seq data such as rSeq
(Jiang and Wong, 2009). The analyzer estimates AS signals that
include Splicing Index, i.e. fold changes of each exon and junction
normalized to the gene expression level (Clark et al., 2002, 2007),
and the corresponding P—values using the algorithms of detection
above background (DABG), microarray analysis of differential
splicing (MADS) or microarray detection of alternative splicing
(MIDAS). DABG calculates the probability of the presence of each
probe set based on the non—parametric distribution of background
probe intensities (Clark et al., 2007), and MADS (Xing et al.,
2008) and MIDAS (Affymetrix white paper: Alternative Transcript
Analysis Methods for Exon Arrays v1.1) calculate the P—value of
differential expression for each exon and junction relative to the
corresponding gene expression levels between two conditions. For
RNA—Seq data, Splicing Index and MIDAS are calculated, as DABG
and MADS are speciﬁc to arrays.

The analyzer then detects AS events by allowing custom ﬁltering
on one or a combination of the provided AS signals. For example, to
reduce false positive detections, it is helpful to require each detected
event being supported by the signal of the exon as well as at least
one of its connecting junctions when analyzing exon—j unction arrays
(Xu et al., 2011).

JETTA also provides the visualization of AS signals (Fig. 1B). In
addition, it is integrated with cisGenome Brower (Ji et al., 2008)
to allow the examination of raw signals of exons and junctions.
The software is implemented as an R—package as well as standalone
software with graphical user interface.

Fig. 1. (A) Modules of JETTA. (B) Visualization of AS events. Gene SLK is shown as an example. Exons are represented as blocks, and junctions are
represented between exons or by bridging exons. Probeset IDs of exons (solid bars) and junctions (dotted bars) are labeled on the x—axis, and on the y—axis the
corresponding logged fold changes are shown as upward and downward bars, respectively, so that the upward bars represent signals increased in liver and
downward bars signals increased in muscle. The highlighted shows an AS, as supported by the increase of the exon and its two ‘inclusion’ junctions as well

as a decrease of its ‘skipping’ junction in liver compared with muscle.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

JETTA is demonstrated using exon—junction array data of quad—
ruplicates of human liver and muscle samples (Xu et al., 2011). Low—
level data processing was performed through GCBIN correction,
median—scaling normalization and median—polish summarization.

Alternatively, spliced exons between liver and muscle were then
identiﬁed through the following steps. First, exon probe sets were
selected with MIDAS P—values <0.01 and DABG P—values <0.01
(in at least one tissue), resulting in 13 150 candidate exons. Second,
signiﬁcant junction probe sets were identiﬁed that satisﬁed the same
criteria of MIDAS and DABG P—values as above. Third, since
exon probes alone sometimes are not sufﬁcient for reliable analysis
of splicing (Xing et al., 2008), to increase the conﬁdence of the
ﬁndings, we determined among candidate exons those supported by
at least one signiﬁcant connecting junction that corroborated the AS
signal of the exon. This gave a ﬁnal result of 6461 exons in 2999
genes as alternatively spliced. As an example, Figure 1B shows the
result of gene SLK.

To help experimental validations, we looked at ‘skipped’ exons
present in one condition but absent in the other. Here, we considered
only genes expressed higher than the overall median expression
level and changed <2—fold between the conditions. Further, ﬁltering
by DABG P—values (>01 in the condition where the exon is less—
expressed) and MADS P—values (<0.01) yielded 145 exons in 122
genes. Among them, GRANLl, VPS39 and SLK were tested with
RT—PCR, and all were veriﬁed with large fold changes.

Similarly, we applied JETTA to an RNA—Seq dataset of the same
tissue types (GSE26109) and detected 996 AS events, among which
52% were also identiﬁed by the array analysis (details described
on JETTA webpage). JETTA detects alternatively spliced exons
without decomposing the expression levels of previously known
or reconstructed de novo transcript isoforms ( Jiang et al., 2009;
Roberts et al., 2011; Trapnell et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2003). It
provides a complementary option for analysis of RNA—Seq data,
especially for cross—comparing alternative spliced exons detected
with results from the arrays.

In summary, JETTA is an integrated software package for
expression and AS analyses and visualization. The software has been
applied as a primary tool for the analyses of exon and junction arrays
in an ongoing multicenter clinical study of severe trauma patients

(Xu et al., 2011). As high—throughput AS studies become prevalent
in clinical research; we anticipate that J ETTA will also be useful for
the data analysis.

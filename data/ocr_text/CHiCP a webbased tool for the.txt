Abstract

Summary: Promoter capture Hi—C (PCHi—C) allows the genome—wide interrogation of physical inter—
actions between distal DNA regulatory elements and gene promoters in multiple tissue contexts.
Visual integration of the resultant chromosome interaction maps with other sources of genomic an—
notations can provide insight into underlying regulatory mechanisms. We have developed Capture
HiC Plotter (CHiCP), a web—based tool that allows interactive exploration of PCHi—C interaction
maps and integration with both public and user—defined genomic datasets.

Availability and Implementation: CHiCP is freely accessible from WWW.Cthp.OI‘g and supports
most major HTML5 compliant web browsers. Full source code and installation instructions are

 

available from http://github.com/D—I—L/django—chicp.

1 Introduction

A large majority of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) associated
with human disease lie outside of known coding regions and are en—
riched in DNase I hypersensitive regions (Maurano et 61]., 2012).
Promoter capture Hi—C enables the detection of physical chromatin
interactions between gene promoter regions and distal DNA gene
expression regulatory elements, globally and at high resolution
(Belton et 61]., 2012; Sahlen et 61]., 2015; Schoenfelder et 61]., 2015).
By integrating with genome—wide association data, it may be pos—
sible to gain further insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying
a particular trait or disease (Mifsud et 61]., 2015). However, owing
to a dependence on restriction enzymes in the underlying method,
defined interactions are based on specific restriction fragment inter-
vals. The resultant genomic interaction maps are therefore complex,
as a single promoter fragment can interact with multiple distal re—
striction fragments of heterogeneous size, and interactions may vary
across different tissue contexts. Current genome browsers with

capabilities for the visualization of these interactions, such as
WashU Epigenome Browser (Zhou et 61]., 2013) and Ensembl
(Cunningham et 61]., 2015), provide a linear view which can limit a
user’s ability to resolve these complex interaction patterns and how
they relate to other genomic features of interest. A circular represen—
tation can be helpful in this context, but existing circular viewers,
such as J—Circos (An et 61]., 2015), CircOS (Krzywinski et 61]., 2009),
GView (Petkau et 61]., 2010) and GenomeD3Plot (Laird et 61]., 2015),
are not specifically designed and optimized to allow interactive and
integrative visualization of human PCHi—C datasets.

CHiCP employs a hybrid approach: users see a circular overview
for all interactions for a given SNV, gene or region, with the option
to highlight a particular interaction of interest that results in a stand—
ard linear view. We demonstrate its functionality by integrating a re—
cent promoter capture Hi—C dataset (Mifsud et 61]., 2015) with
publically available GWAS summary statistics (http://www.immuno
base.org), Ensembl gene annotations (Cunningham et 61]., 2015 ) and

2 Methods

We obtained PCHi—C data for GM12878 and CD34+ cells (Mifsud
et al., 2015 ), detected interactions in these data using the
CHiCAGO pipeline (Cairns et al., 2015 ) and converted the WashU
Browser formatted output files into tab—delimited format using a
custom Perl script. We downloaded chromatin segmentation states
from the Epigenomic Roadmap web portal (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo/roadmap/epigenomicsl), Gene annotations from
Ensembl v75 (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release—75/gtf/homo_sapi
ens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf.gz) and autoimmune disease
summary association statistics from ImmunoBase v1.11 (http://
www.immunobase.org). We processed all datasets using
Elasticsearch (http://www.elastic.co) to obtain indexed object stores
and developed a RESTful web application using the Django (v1.8)
framework (https://djangoproject.com) to facilitate querying and
data integration. We developed a browser—based interactive visual—
ization using D3.js (http://d3js.org[) and jQuery JavaScript (http://
jquery.com[) libraries to provide an asynchronous visual interface to
the underlying Django web application.

3 Results

The user interface and visualization of CHiCP consists of a search
toolbox on the left—hand side of the browser window (Fig. 1A) that
allows searching of the configured PCHi—C and association statistics
datasets by gene name, Ensembl gene id, Reference SNP (rs) ID or a
genomic region (e.g. chr21:16165420—16959712). Tissue context
can be altered by using radio buttons labeled with available tissue
types followed, in brackets, by the number of significant interactions

for that type. Finally, the ‘Association Study’ drop—down menu
allows users to integrate either public or private genetic association
summary statistics. The data visualization is split into three panels, a
central navigation panel showing a circularized overview of inter—
actions and annotations for current search term and two right—hand
‘detail’ panels. From the centre of the circular plot, matching inter-
actions from the selected tissue context are shown as coloured arcs
connecting restriction fragments (Fig. 1B). Moving outwards, associ—
ation summary statistics are shown in a circularized Manhattan
plot, by default genome—wide significant associations (P < 5 X 10—8)
are shown in green (Fig. 1D). Genes are coloured according to bio—
type (Fig. 1E). Finally, a genomic scale is displayed with red tick
marks detailing the positions of restriction enzyme fragments (Fig.
1F). Clicking on an interaction opens a linear representation of the
bait and target regions in separate panels on the right—hand side (Fig.
1G, H), with genes shown in canonical format, and outlined exons
ﬂagging transcription start sites (Fig. 11). Where data are available,
extra tracks showing epigenetic states of the cells are shown (Fig.
1]). Buttons in the top bar allow snapshotting of the current view
for the purposes of sharing and figure generation.

We used CHiCP to not only validate the findings of Misfud et al.
that NRIPI is a likely causal gene in ulcerative colitis (UC), but add—
itionally, that UC genome—wide significant variants from Franke
et al. (2010) overlap CD34+ specific enhancer regions (Fig. 1).

4 Discussion

We present CHiCP as an innovative and powerful web—based tool
for the interactive and integrative visualization of human PCHi-C
data with other genomic and genetic datasets. We provide a demon—
stration of its utility by focusing on the integration of a set of auto—
immune disease genetic association summary statistics with a
published PCHi—C dataset of relevant cell types. As more PCHi—C

datasets across multiple tissue types enter the public domain, visual—
ization tools such as ours will have increasing utility in making these
results accessible in the context of other relevant genomic annota—
tions. It might also provide a platform for creating a browsable
PCHi—C compendium that has the possibility to facilitate the under—
standing of the role of regulatory variation in human disease in spe—
cific tissue contexts. Indeed, future work will examine the feasibility
of adding functionality for users to add their own public and private
interaction datasets as well as further modifications to allow the
general visualization of other sources of high resolution Hi—C data
(e.g. enhancer capture). Future user interface improvements might
allow for a more exploratory approach at the genome—wide scale.
The software is freely available, is implemented using standard open
source web components, and thus can be modified to support di—
verse use cases and datasets both publicly and privately.

ABSTRACT

Summary: MOST (metabolic optimization and simulation tool) is a
software package that implements GDBB (genetic design through
branch and bound) in an intuitive user-friendly interface with excel-
like editing functionality, as well as implementing FBA (flux balance
analysis), and supporting systems biology markup language and
comma-separated values files. GDBB is currently the fastest algorithm
for finding gene knockouts predicted by FBA to increase production of
desired products, but GDBB has only been available on a command
line interface, which is difficult to use for those without programming
knowledge, until the release of MOST.

Availability and implementation: MOST is distributed for free on the
GNU General Public License. The software and full documentation are
available at http://most.ccib.rutgers.edu/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many software packages are currently available to create con-
straint-based models of metabolism, load existing models, export
models and run analyses on these models (Lakshmanan et al.,
2014) to predict the production of desired compounds by
microbes under genetic manipulations (Egen and Lun, 2012).
This software differs in data input type and display of results,
where input type ranges from command line to spreadsheet, and
results display as text or in spreadsheet form. Many packages can
load the commonly used systems biology markup language
(SBML) (Hucka et al., 2003) format, and some can load text
ﬁles, microsoft excel ﬁles or other formats (Lakshmanan et al.,
2014). Many packages also export SBML or other formats
(Lakshmanan et al., 2014). In general all the software packages
implement F BA (Orth et al., 2010), and some implement
OptKnock (Burgard et al., 2003), evolutionary algorithms
(Patil et al., 2005), GDLS (genetic design through local search)
(Lun et al., 2009) or other analyses.

Much of this software is command line, which requires
programming knowledge, deterring potential users. Because
very few software packages exist that implement an editable

spreadsheet type interface, Excel is commonly used to build
models. Excel can be used to run analyses on models, but it
requires programming knowledge to do so. In addition, the
solver used in Excel may not be able to handle large models
(Lakshmanan et al., 2014). There clearly exists a need for a
program that allows models to be built in a user-friendly intuitive
Excel-like interface, and that can run analyses on these models
without requiring programming knowledge.

Genetic design through branch and bound (GDBB) is
currently the fastest technique for ﬁnding a set of gene knockouts
that gives the best production ﬂux of a particular compound as
predicted by F BA (Egen and Lun, 2012). A synthetic objective
vector, the vector g in Equation 2 from Egen and Lun (2012) and
Equation 3 from Lun et al., (2009), is used by GDBB to deﬁne
the substance for which production is to be maximized. Because
GDBB is only available as an implementation in MATLAB,
which is command line and difﬁcult to use for those without
programming knowledge, there is a need for GDBB to be imple-
mented in a more user-friendly software package. MOST (meta-
bolic optimization and simulation tool) provides an intuitive,
user-friendly interface that can be used for creating, loading
and exporting models, and running analyses on these models.
MOST implements GDBB, FBA, E-Flux2 and simpliﬁed
Pearson correlation with transcriptomic data (SPOT), and
supports SBML and CSV ﬁles. E-Flux2 and SPOT are methods
for integration of transcriptomic data into constraint-based
models (M. Kim et al., submitted for publication).

MOST stands out for its Excel-like spreadsheet editing func-
tionality that includes functions that are specialized for model
building and editing such as a Reaction Editor, which can be
used to construct reaction equations from an existing table of
metabolites.

2 DESCRIPTION OF TOOL

MOST is a standalone software package where constraint-based
models of metabolism can be created, and existing models can be
loaded, edited and saved. The main portion of the interface con-
sists of two spreadsheets: the Reactions table and the Metabolites
table. MOST has a tree where links to the original loaded model
and analyses run on the model are located, and a console where
results are displayed (see Fig. 1). The results of analyses in
spreadsheets and in the console can be saved. MOST has been

Fig. 1. MOST user interface with title bar, menu bar, toolbar, formula
bar, tables, and console (from upper left to lower left), and tree on right

extensively tested on Windows XP, 7 and 8. Linux and
Macintosh releases are also available. MOST requires a Mixed
Integer Linear Program solver to run F BA, E-Flux2 and GDBB.
MOST offers a choice of solvers, either Gurobi solver (Gurobi
Optimization, Houston, TX, USA), which is free for academic
use, or GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit; http://www.gnu.
org/software/glpk/), a free solver. MOST also requires a
Quadratic Solver for E-Flux2, either Gurobi or Ipopt (Interior
Point OPTimizer; http://openopt.org/IPOPT), and a Nonlinear
solver for SPOT, Ipopt.

2.1 Ease of use

MOST provides an intuitive user interface, and extensive
documentation on its website describing software requirements,
installation, model building and editing, loading and saving of
models, and running analyses. The Reaction Editor makes it easy
to create new reactions from a table of existing metabolites, since
entering text generates selectable suggestions. Using the Reaction
Editor ensures correct spacing and syntax. If a metabolite exists
in a reaction equation but is not present in the metabolites table,
it will be automatically added. It is easy to ‘clean up’ a model, i.e.
remove metabolites that do not participate in any reactions, by
using the ‘delete all unused metabolites’ menu item. Unused me-
tabolites or participating reactions can be highlighted. MOST
provides error checking and helps the user to ﬁx errors.

2.2 Genetic design through branch and bound

GDBB can be run from the analysis menu by selecting the
GDBB item. There must be a non-zero entry in the synthetic
objective column to get meaningful results. A dialog will be
displayed allowing a user to select number of knockouts, indef-
inite or ﬁnite time and start analysis. Each solution generated
will add an entry to the GDBB folder in the tree, and a new entry
to the console. MOST is distributed with the test ﬁles that run
through the test cases mentioned by Egen and Lun (2012).

2.3 Model exchange

MOST has been extensively tested for loading SBML ﬁles,
having successfully loaded approximately 100 different SBML
models. MOST writes SBML ﬁles and these SBML ﬁles are
read correctly by OptFlux (Rocha, 2010) and ﬂux analysis and
modeling environment (Boele, 2010). MOST can also export
to CSV ﬁles, which are Excel readable. MOST has dialogs
that help the user to match CSV ﬁle columns to the correspond-
ing columns in reactions and metabolites tables. MOST
auto-matches columns, but selected columns can be changed.
MOST can also correct the syntax of a model so that it conforms
to SBML speciﬁcations, and write the corrected model as an
SBML ﬁle.

3 SUMMARY

MOST separates itself from other software packages for con-
straint-based modeling because it is that it is the only software
package that implements GDBB, the fastest method for ﬁnding
gene knockouts predicted by F BA to have high output ﬂux of
desired products, E-Flux2, and SPOT in an intuitive, easy to use
interface with Excel-like editing functionality. MOST provides a
Reaction Editor, which prevents syntax errors when editing
reaction equations. In addition, MOST implements FBA and
has the ability to load and save SBML and CSV ﬁles.

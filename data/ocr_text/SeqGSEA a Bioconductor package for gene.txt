ABSTRACT

Summary: SquSEA is an open-source Bioconductor package for
the functional integration of differential expression and splicing ana-
lysis in RNA-Seq data. SquSEA implements an analysis pipeline,
which first computes differential splicing and differential expression
scores, followed by integrating them into a per-gene score that quan-
tifies each gene’s association with a phenotype of interest, and finally
executes gene set enrichment analysis in a cutoff-free manner to
achieve biological insights. SquSEA accounts for biological variabil-
ity and determines the statistical significance of gene pathways and
networks using subject permutation, and thus requires at least five
samples per group. Real applications show that SquSEA detects
more biologically meaningful gene sets without biases toward long
or highly expressed genes. SquSEA can be set up to run in parallel
to reduce the analysis time.

Availability and implementation: The SquSEA package with a vi-
gnette is available at http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/

1 INTRODUCTION

By enabling simultaneous quantiﬁcation of abnormal expression
and aberrant splicing, high-throughput transcriptome sequencing
or RNA-Seq is providing unprecedented insight into disease and
condition-associated transcriptome alterations. Although these
complex patterns of transcriptional activity have a profound in-
ﬂuence in the pathophysiology of disease, we need tools that are
capable of integrating their biological inﬂuences to determine
their functional signiﬁcance. Functional annotation of independ-
ently differentially expressed genes and their pathway analysis is
ideal for investigating highly controlled interventions in clonal or
syngeneic systems with no underlying heterogeneity. However,
when comparing conditions in outbred populations, particularly
for complex phenotypes or diseases, biologically signiﬁcant ef-
fects are often distributed in pathways or networks such that the
inﬂuence of individual genes is redundant and untraceable.

Arguably the best alternative in thi+situation is to consider
related gene sets using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to
identify disturbances at the pathway and network levels that
have biologically associated function (Goeman and Buhlmann,
2007).

Although there are existing tools for performing GSEA on
conventional gene expression data, there are currently no tools
for implementing GSEA with RNA-Seq data that can efficiently
incorporate gene expression and alternative splicing (AS). For
example, GOSeq Woung et al., 2010) cannot account for AS in
its enrichment analysis. In higher primates, the majority of genes
undergo AS; especially, in humans more than 90% genes are
alternatively spliced WVang et al., 2008). Recent evidence sug-
gests that splicing and transcription largely take place almost
simultaneously (Djebali et al., 2012), and both result in the al-
teration of mRNA composition, stability, localization and trans-
lation. In this Applications Note, we introduce a new software
system for implementing a recently proposed enrichment analysis
approach for RNA-Seq data, combining both overall differential
expression (DE) and differential splicing (DS) (Wang and Cairns,
2013). We also demonstrate the utility of this approach-
designated SquSEA, to maximize the yield of biological insight
from RNA-Seq data without any biases toward long or highly
expressed genes, in a number of data sets.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

In well-annotated organisms, such as the human and mouse, the ﬁrst step
of RNA-Seq analysis is usually to map short reads to the reference
genome with splice-tolerant mappers, such as Tophat, to yield BAM/
SAM-formatted outputs. Given a set of gene annotation, SquSEA
uses a Python script based on the HTSeq package (http://www-huber.
embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq) to count reads mapped to individual exons
of each gene. Based on the read counts, SquSEA uses the DSGseq
method Wang et al., 2013) to quantify transcript-level differences result-
ing from AS between samples of different phenotypes. Similarly, based on
read counts summed up for each gene, SquSEA imports DESeq method
(Anders and Huber, 2010) to quantify overall expression differences for
each gene. As the statistical metrics given by DSGseq and DESeq for
differential expression and differential splicing are not necessarily
comparable, SquSEA uses a normalization step to aid integration.
The normalization is performed against background metric distributions
achieved by a number (say, 1000) of permutated datasets. We call the
normalized metrics the DE and DS scores. To integrate DE and DS
scores, two strategies can be selected, including a weighted linear

combination and a rank-based integration. The rank-based strategy has a
tendency to generate slightly more overrepresented gene sets than the
linear combination. (See Supplementary Note S1 for more details on
DE and DS integration.) We term the integrated scores as gene scores,
representing each gene’s association with the phenotype studied. Finally,
SquSEA uses the state-of—the-art GSEA method (Subramanian et al.,
2005) for functional enrichment analysis. The GSEA method then com-
putes normalized enrichment scores (NESs) for each gene set against the
permutation background, and calls statistical signiﬁcance based on the
observed NESs compared with those on the permutated datasets.
SquSEA ignores the direction of gene expression changes in its analysis,
as the signiﬁcance of direction in DS is ambiguous, and the signiﬁcance of
direction in DE can also be variable, as interacting gene pairs are often
inversely regulated. An overview of SquSEA’s analysis workﬂow is
shown in Supplementary Figure S1.

The SquSEA package includes a built-in capacity to generate well-
designed ﬁgures for users to easily present the results of analysis, and
well-formatted output text ﬁles to archive analysis outcomes with relevant
information. For example, Supplementary Figure S2a shows the distri-
bution of NESs compared with those on the permutated datasets, from
which it is clear that a few gene sets are signiﬁcantly overrepresented in
the studied dataset. Another example in Supplementary Figure S2b shows
the relationship between NESs and P—values, false discovery rates and
family-wise error rates, providing a quick and direct overview of
SquSEA’s analysis results. For each signiﬁcantly overrepresented gene
set, functions are also available to generate detailed gene set-speciﬁc plots
(Supplementary Fig. S3).

SquSEA is implemented in R, and has been deposited in
Bioconductor. With a regular update cycle, SquSEA will keep updating
by taking users’ comments and implementing new functions that make
the package more comprehensive. To reduce analysis running time,
SquSEA was made multi-thread compatible so that users can easily
run SquSEA with a speciﬁed number of multiple cores.

3 APPLICATION EXAMPLES

We applied the SquSEA package to a prostate cancer RNA-
Seq dataset, downloaded from the NCBI SRA database with
accession number SRP002628. The data were generated from
20 prostate cancer samples and 10 matched benign samples by
Illumina GAII, ~22.2 million reads on average per sample. We
mapped the reads to the human reference genome using Tophat,
resulting in BAM ﬁles. Read counts at the exon level were com-
puted using Python scripts based on HTSeq released with the
package. DE and DS analyses were then conducted, followed by
DE and DS score integration and gene set analysis with the
GSEA algorithm. The analysis scripts are exempliﬁed in the
package vignette (released with the Bioconductor package; sec-
tion “An analysis example”) and provided in Supplementary
Note S2 with corresponding mathematical explanation. With
linear combination of DE and DS equally contributed,
SquSEA resulted in 16 overrepresented gene sets at false dis-
covery rate 0.05 (Supplementary Fig. S2b).

Comparison with alternative methods. We have compared
SquSEA with alternative analysis pipelines, which can only
account for DE and DS separately, on the prostate cancer
dataset as well as two schizophrenia transcriptome sequencing
datasets and shown that more gene sets with high biological
relevancy can be detected by SquSEA WVang and Cairns,
2013). A brief summary of this comparison study is provided
in Supplementary Note S3. Moreover, while the existing
GOSeq strategy compensates for biased selection of long and

highly expressed genes Woung et al., 2010), we have not
observed any bias in SquSEA’s gene scores against gene
length or read counts (Supplementary Note S4).

Typical running time. We have recorded the running time with
the cancer data on the MsigDB collection 5 (05, 1454 gene sets).
Using eight cores of Intel Sandy Bridge E5-2600 CPUs, it took
<16 h to ﬁnish. If a gene set collection contains more gene sets, it
takes slightly more time for the whole procedure. We summar-
ized running time of the cancer data and two schizophrenia
datasets across two gene set collections in Supplementary
Table S1.

4 DISCUSSION

SquSEA provides an RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline for func-
tional integration of DE and DS, gathering multiple analysis
steps together into a Bioconductor package, which enables bioin—
formaticians and biologists to interpret their own RNA-Seq data
into biological insight, quickly and easily. The advantage of
SquSEA over existing functional analysis pipelines includes
(i) taking into account sequencing bias and biological variation
with negative binomial models in DESeq and DSGseq, (ii) efﬁ-
ciently accounting of both differential expression and splicing,
(iii) permutation-based gene scores securing enrichment analysis
without bias toward gene sets of long and highly expressed genes
and (iv) cutoff-free property that facilitates detection of subtle
accumulating alteration in gene activity.

This package can also be used for DE— or DS-only GSEA by
setting the weighting parameter in DE/DS score combination to
1 or 0. DE-only GSEA is particularly useful for organisms with
few or none AS, such as prokaryotes. Therefore, SquSEA can
be applied to any organisms and not just higher eukaryotes.

SquSEA performs statistical signiﬁcance assessment based
on subject permutation, and thus requires a moderate samples
size. Greater than ﬁve samples per group meets the least require-
ment for running SquSEA. More importantly, enough sample
size is critical to secure accurate analysis results because of the
sample heterogeneity, particularly when studying human sam-
ples, which are generally subject to much larger biological vari-
ation than cell lines or model organisms (Oberg et al., 2012).

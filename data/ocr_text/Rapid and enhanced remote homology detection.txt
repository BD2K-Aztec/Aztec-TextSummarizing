Abstract

Motivation: In the post—genomic era, automatic annotation of protein sequences using computational
homology—based methods is highly desirable. However, often protein sequences diverge to an extent
where detection of homology and automatic annotation transfer is not straightforward. Sophisticated
approaches to detect such distant relationships are needed. We propose a new approach to identify
deep evolutionary relationships of proteins to overcome shortcomings of the available methods.
Results: We have developed a method to identify remote homologues more effectively from any
protein sequence database by using several cascading events with Hidden Markov Models (C—
HMM). We have implemented clustering of hits and profile generation of hit clusters to effectively
reduce the computational timings of the cascaded sequence searches. Our C—HMM approach could
cover 94, 83 and 40% coverage at family, superfamily and fold levels, respectively, when applied
on diverse protein folds. We have compared C—HMM with various remote homology detection
methods and discuss the trade—offs between coverage and false positives.

1 Introduction

 

OXFORD

Rapid increase in genome sequencing initiatives has led to the accu—
mulation of a huge amount of sequence information that needs de—
tailed annotation. Structural and functional characterization of new
proteins is a critical task and it is often based on the sequence simi—
larity with proteins of known structure and function. But in some
cases, proteins diverge to an eXtent where relationships between

them cannot be easily established using direct sequence search based
approaches. Such evolutionary distant proteins are called as remote
homologues, and detection of such remote relationships is still a
challenging task. Accurate detection of remote homologues can fa—
cilitate the assignment of putative functions to uncharacterized pro—
teins improving genomic function annotations. In many cases,
functional annotation can be achieved using protein structures, as

structural divergence is much slower than sequence divergence.
However, protein structural information is limited and the growth
of structure databases is also relatively very slow (Levitt, 2007).
With the continuous expansion of sequence databases, there is a
growing need for a protocol to identify such distant homologues by
exploiting mere sequence information.

Many methods based on position—specific scoring matrices
(PSSM) and profile Hidden Markov Models (HMM) have been de—
veloped to detect distant relationships between protein sequences
(Altschul et 61]., 1997; Eddy, 1998, 2011). For example, position—
specific iterated BLAST derives a PSSM from multiple sequences
identified by BLAST searches, which are further used to search se—
quence database to identify newer hits in an iterative manner
(Altschul et 61]., 1997). The drawback of PSI—BLAST is that it can
converge before finding all the true positive hits. On the other hand,
probabilistic model based profile HMMs (Eddy, 1998, 2011) are
more sensitive and efficient in remote homolog detection (Birney,
2001; Karplus et 61]., 1998). HMMER utility provides one such
package named Jackhmmer, which iterates profile—HMMs till con-
vergence, to detect distant relationships of proteins (Eddy, 2011;
Finn et al., 2011). Profile HMMs are similar to sequence profiles,
but in addition to the amino acid frequencies in the columns of a
multiple sequence alignment, they also contain position—specific
probabilities for insertions and deletions along the
alignment. Profile HMMs are more sensitive than BLAST PSSMs,
since position—specific gap penalties penalize chance hits more, as
compared with true positives. HMM—HMM comparison, as
implemented in HHsearch and HHblits, is also an effective method
to identify remote homologues (Remmert et 61]., 2012; Soding,
2005).

In principle, these methods extract information from intermedi-
ate sequences that share sequence properties of multiple remotely
related proteins to detect remote homologues (Park et 61]., 1997;
Salamov et 61]., 1999). When the relation between two remote homo—
logues is not evident, these intermediate sequences serve as stepping—
stones for hopping through sequence space. For example, hits from
the first ‘generation’ serve as intermediate sequences to detect homo—
logues in the second generation of PSI—BLAST. We have shown ear—
lier that the intermediate sequence approach can be utilized more
effectively by cascading through PSI—BLAST over various gener—
ations to cover more distant relationships at family, superfamily and
fold levels (Kaushik et 61]., 2013; Sandhya et 61]., 2005). Yet, a major
drawback of using PSI—BLAST in cascade searches is the computa—
tional time, which increases considerably with the size and complex—
ity of the databases, lending it almost impossible to apply on large
sequence databases.

In this study, we have proposed a new protocol called Cascade—
HMM (C—HMM) that can be used to identify remote homologues
from protein sequence databases. The primary motivation of de—
veloping C—HMM is to permit effective remote homology detection
against any available sequence database, irrespective of its size. C—
HMM involves cascading of HMMs through various generations to
detect true distant homologues even at superfamily and fold levels.
We also show that, clustering of protein sequences, followed by pro—
file generation helps in effective detection of remote homologues.
In addition, we have compared different remote homology detec—
tion methods to provide insights about proper usage of
different approaches prior to initiating sequence searches. Our ana—
lysis highlighted that BLAST—based methods perform more
adequately at the family and superfamily levels, while HMM—based
methods are overall more efficient for sequence searches even at the

fold level.

2 Methods

2.1 C—HMM protocol
C—HMM protocol is divided into three modules, as described below:

2.1.1 Module 1: C-HMM

The first module of C—HMM involves rigorous sequence searches
for many generations (Fig. 1). We implemented cascaded sequence
searches by performing five generations of Jackhmmer (Finn et al.,
2011). Each generation involves multiple rounds of Jackhmmer
searches against a user—defined protein sequence database. In the
first generation, the query is scanned against a database with
Jackhmmer and the resulting hits are filtered using expectation (E)
and inclusion (h) thresholds in order to recognize ‘true’ hits. Since
short alignments with good E—values can lead to wrong connections,
a length filter is also considered in addition to the E—value criteria.
The length filter only permits hits that are >75 % of the query
length. All the collected homologues that pass the above criteria are
defined as ‘true hits’.

All the ‘true hits’ of the first generation are considered as seeds
(query sequences) to initiate a second generation of C—HMM. The
second generation involves multiple rounds of Jackhmmer, which
are initiated with the seed sequences as one query at a time. All the
collected hits, obtained through Jackhmmer in the second gener-
ation, from each seed sequence are again scanned for the minimum
E-value and length filter criteria. Unique hits that pass these criteria
and those, which are not identified in the first generation are
counted as ‘true hits’ from the second generation. Similarly, third
generation of C—HMM is initiated with only filtered unique hits
from the previous generations. For each generation, only aligned re—
gions of the query and hits are considered. These generations can be
continued until no new hits are obtained.

2.1.2 Module 2: Cluster-HMM

Sequence searches against ever—growing sequence databases, such as
the non—redundant (NR) protein sequence database, require a proto—
col that can process a large number of sequences effectively.

C—HMM protocol also offers an option of clustering of the collected
homologues (hits), within Cluster—HMM module, while searching
against such huge databases. In this module, all the collected true
hits obtained after each generation, are clustered using Cd—hit (Li
and Godzik, 2006). Only representative sequences of the clusters are
employed to initiate subsequent generations. This clustering criter-
ion (Module 2) has been introduced to remove very similar se—
quences so that sequence searches can be performed in less
computational time but with little trade—off on sequence coverage.

2.1.3 Module 3: Custom-HMM

To further enhance the performance of C—HMM, we implemented
another module called custom—HMM. Here, similar to Module—2,
the filtered hits obtained from the first generation are clustered at a
particular sequence identity cut—off using Cd—hit. However, instead
of using only representative sequences, entire set of hits within the
cluster is considered to create an HMM profile, which is then con-
sidered as seed to initiate the next generation. This approach further
reduces the search duration without significant loss in sequence in-
formation as compared with the other two modules.

2.2. Assessment of C—HMM and dataset creation

For the assessment of the C—HMM protocol, we used
PALI—l—(Phylogeny and Alignment of homologues protein structures)
database (Balaji et al., 2001), which is a SCOP—derived (Murzin
et al., 1995) protein sequence database of known 3D structures and
their sequence homologues. In PALI—(—, each member in a family has
been structurally aligned with every other member in the same fam-
ily (Gowri et al., 2003). Each sequence of PALI—I— is annotated with
the respective SCOP fold, thereby permitting the identification of
true positive sequences easily. Hence, the total numbers of true con—
nections are known a priori. To assess the performance of C—HMM
at different levels of sequence similarity, we analyzed all the col—
lected hits at protein family, superfamily and fold levels. We as—
sessed the performance of C—HMM on 16 superfamilies, belonging
to different classes of SCOP database, at different E—values (10_3,
10_4 and 10_6) for five generations (Supplementary Table S1).
These superfamilies belong to 30 most populated metafolds, repre—
senting the folds for approximately half of the non—redundant subset
of Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000; Day et al., 2003).
We also performed sequence searches against the Swiss—Prot data—
base (Bairoch and preiler, 2000). In addition, we examined the ef—
fect of different E—values on the performance of C—HMM during
different generations.

2.3 Available parameters and selection

C—HMM provides certain user—defined parameters (E—value, h—value,
length filter and clustering threshold) to perform variations in sequence
searches. Maximum number of hits to be considered for the next gen—
eration runs can be decided before initiating sequence searches. This
parameter is useful for highly dispersed protein families.

2.4. Comparison of C—HMM with other methods

We compared the performance of C—HMM with other available re—
mote homology detection methods. We chose four methods:
Jackhmmer, PSI-BLAST, HHblits and Cascade PSI—BLAST (Sandhya
et al., 2005), to compare C—HMM against PALI database. For this
comparison we used a dataset of 18 large superfamilies covering dif-
ferent classes of SCOP database (Supplementary Table S2). Next,
we also compared the performance of C—HMM with protein 3D
structure comparison method Dali (Holm et al., 2006; Holm and

Rosenstrom, 2010). These searches were performed using larger
SCOP folds (Triose phosphate isomerase (TIM), Ferredoxin and
Immunoglobulin folds) with many superfamilies against PDB.
Additionally, we also assessed the performance of C—HMM, against
SwissProt, with a protein domain alignment based method PSI—
Search (Li et al., 2012), which can avoid homologues over exten—
sions (HOE) in the sequence alignments (Gonzalez and Pearson,
2010). We employed SUPERFAMILY database (Gough et al., 2001;
Gough and Chothia, 2002) as a benchmarking dataset to classify the
hits as true positives or false positives, while performing sequence
searches against PDB (Dali) and Swiss—Prot (PSI—search) databases.

2.5 Performance measures

We assessed the performance of C—HMM using coverage and preci—
sion scores. Coverage was defined as the true associations (true posi—
tives) identified using a sequence search method by the total number
of true associations present in PALI—I— database at family, superfam-
ily and fold levels.

TP (family / superfamily / fold)
No. of sequences in database (family / superfamily / fold)

 

Coverage :

Any hit that did not belong to the same fold as query sequence was
considered as a false positive. Precision scores were also calculated to
identify the fraction of hits that are relevant to the sequence search.

where, TP and FP are the number of true positives and false positives
identified during sequence searches.

3 Results

3.1 Performance of C—HMM at family, superfamily and
fold levels

3.1.1 Detection of homologues within family

Proteins at family level are structurally related and share high se—
quence similarity. Therefore, relationships at the family level can be
identified more easily by pairwise or profile—based methods. Using C—
HMM, when we performed sequence searches at E—values of 10—3
and 104’, most of the trusted homologues could be obtained with
high coverage scores as shown in Figure 2A. For most of the families,
C—HMM could cover 90% of the homologues within family, while
for some of them (including Chromo—domain like, Galactose—binding
domain and P—loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases),
C—HMM could obtain ~80% of the members. On an average, C—
HMM could cover ~94, ~91 and ~82% of homologues within fam-
ily level at different E—values of 10_3, 10_4 and 10_6, respectively.
Overall coverage scores of the families were improved during subse—
quent generations as shown in Supplementary Figure S1.

We noticed that it is very important to propagate sequence
searches to many generations to identify remote relationships even
at the family level (Fig. 2C). For example, in chromo-domain family,
only 10% of homologues were obtained in the first generation,
while coverage was increased to 85% when cascaded searches were
performed till third generation. For 0t/[3 plait and Ferredoxin-like
families, continuation of sequence searches till fifth generation also
enabled in identifying distant family members that were not cap—
tured in the first generation. For five families, however, a single gen—
eration was sufficient to identify all the homologues of the
respective families.

Supplementary Table 82)

3.1.2 Detection of homologues within superfamily

Protein sequences related by structure and function are commonly
grouped together to form a superfamily. Distantly related domains
share poor sequence identity and could still be related at the super—
family level by means of similar structure and biological function.
Hence, the application of cascaded sequence searches becomes more
meaningful at that level. Moreover, different protein domain fami-
lies are differentially represented within a superfamily in terms of se—
quence dispersion. Our analysis showed that the C—HMM coverage
at the superfamily level varied from 90% for a few superfamilies to
only 25% (as in Galactose—binding domain superfamily). We also
observed variations in coverage score at different E—values, as
observed at the family level. For example, in Homeodomain-
like superfamily, high coverage (N5 8%) was captured at a relaxed
E—value of 10‘3, while at very stringent E—value of 10‘6 only 30%
coverage was obtained. However, for some of the superfamilies,
coverage scores remained the same, even when sequence searches
were performed at different E—values (Supplementary Figure S2).
Propagation of sequence searches till fifth generation could capture
many more homologues at the superfamily level too, except in TGS—
like superfamily where 100% coverage could be obtained even
within the first generation (Supplementary Figure S3).

3.1.3 Detection of homologues within fold
Detection of fold—level relationships is the most challenging since func-
tions and sequences are far more diverged and share poor similarities

even at the structural level. Therefore, obtaining higher coverage is
more difficult without increasing false positives due to very distant re—
lationships (Sandhya et al., 2005 ), and most of the sequence search
methods fail to find fold—level relationships in the sequence databases.
Interestingly, we observed that for three of the superfamilies, C—
HMM could achieve >80% of the coverage at fold—level. This in-
cludes superfolds like Rossman fold, PLP—dependent transferase and
P—loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases (Fig. 2B) show—
ing the remarkable power of C—HMM approach. On an average,
42% coverage was captured using C—HMM at the E—value of 10_3,
while coverage was reduced to 23% at the E—value of 10‘6. Overall,
contribution of each generation in accumulating true homologues was
improved at fold level as well (Fig. 2C). In 10 out of 16 superfamilies,
fifth generation contributed to ~30% increase in coverage as com—
pared with previous generations.

We also calculated precision scores to observe the performance
of C—HMM at different E—values. As expected, we obtained higher
precision score of ~90% at stringent E—value of 10_6, while at the
relaxed E—value of 10‘3, precision at the fold level was reduced to
50%.

3.2 Comparison of performance of Jackhmmer and C—
HMM

C—HMM involves cascaded sequence searches using Jackhmmer. To
test if cascaded searches improve the performance of a simple
Jackhmmer, we compared C—HMM with simple Jackhmmer with re-
spect to true homologues captured at different E—values. When
examined at the family level, C—HMM performed very well in some
of the families, while Jackhmmer outperformed C—HMM in other
families. For example, for queries within the Rossman fold, C—
HMM could identify 70% more homologues at the family level, as
compared with simple Jackhmmer searches (Supplementary Figure
S4). Most likely, due to our stringent length—filter criteria, some true
homologues are also filtered out in C—HMM searches, leading to less
coverage for some families. However, detection of homologues at
the superfamily level was 19% higher for C—HMM searches as com—
pared with Jackhmmer, which could cover 64.5% of sequence space
(Supplementary Figure S5). Similarly, comparison of the two meth—
ods at fold level depicted 20% more true homologues with cascade
searches (Supplementary Figure S6). These collected homologues are
highly distributed all over the sequence space (Supplementary
Figure S7).

When we applied different E—values to perform sequence
searches, we noticed a clear trade—off between precision and cover—
age. For example, at E—value of 10_3, coverage score of C—HMM
was 20% higher, but precision was dropped by 40% than
Jackhmmer. Similarly, at 10_4, coverage was 13% higher, but preci—
sion was decreased by 30%, while at 10_6 there was 7% increase in
coverage, but precision was reduced to 9%.

Comparison of the families identified by Jackhmmer and C-
HMM was also carried out by mapping number of families obtained
by each method in selected superfolds. For example, in clustering
diagram of P-loop family members, Jackhmmer could cover 18 out
of 24 families of this superfamily, while 6 other families were not
identified with single generation sequence searches of Jackhmmer.
However, cascaded searches (E—value:10_3) could identify four
additional families. Still, two of the families named Atu3015—like
(c.37.1.13) and Bacterial cell division inhibitor (c.37.1.22) could not
be identified using both search methods, suggesting the need for fur—
ther improvement in such sequence search strategies (Supplementary
Figure 88A). The same scheme was also employed to detect how

many superfamilies are obtained by these methods (Supplementary
Figure S8B).

3.3 C—HMM searches against Swiss—Prot database
Performance of C—HMM was also tested against Swiss—Prot data—
base, which is one of the highly annotated protein sequence data—
bases. During C—HMM searches, some of the classical examples of
distant homologues were captured, where Jackhmmer failed. For ex-
ample, cupredoxin superfamily (SCOP id: b.6.1) consists of seven
families, one of which is Plastocyanin/azurin-like family. Azurin and
plastocyanin proteins of this family share only 16% sequence iden—
tity, but similar protein fold reﬂecting a common evolutionary ori-
gin. When simple Jackhmmer searches were carried out at E—value
of 10‘4 (till convergence), azurin (PDB id: 2CCW) could not identify
plastocyanin (PDB id: 1PLC) as a hit, whereas with C—HMM
searches this relationship could be established after three gener—
ations. This was enabled using two intermediate sequences (bacterial
copper containing proteins, auracyanin and rusticyanin, involved in
electron transfer reactions), identified during first and second gener—
ations, respectively (Fig. 3). This sequence search could also identify
186 other plastocyanin proteins from diverse set of organisms.
Another classical example, which we could capture, was of TIM and
aldolase folds, which are a pair of analogous folds (Supplementary
Figure S9).

3.4 Comparison of available remote homologue
detection methods

3.4.1 Comparison with BLAST and HMM based methods

We next compared the performance of C—HMM with other popular
methods of remote homology detection. To this end, we applied PSI—
BLAST, Jackhmmer, HHblits and Cascade PSI—BLAST on 18 diverse
families of SCOP database (Fig. 4). These methods were selected,
since they can be applied on any available sequence database.
Comparative analysis of coverage at the fold level revealed better per—
formance of C—HMM, as compared with the four other methods. C—
HMM could cover more true relationships as compared with direct
sequence search methods such as PSI—BLAST and Jackhmmer.
Cascade PSI—BLAST outperformed C—HMM in three of the families
(Fibronectin—type-III, Concanavalin like lectins and PDZ—domain-
like), where only 1.8, 3 and 12% more homologues were captured

than C—HMM, respectively. HHblits could capture 12% more homo—
logues as compared with C—HMM in Concanavalin-like lectin family.
On an average, however, PSI—BLAST, Cascade PSI-BLAST,
Jackhmmer, HHblits and C—HMM could cover 12.5, 37.4, 36.2, 31.6
and 50.5% true distant homologues at fold level, respectively (Fig. 4).

Similarly, C—HMM could cover more homologues as compared
with other methods at the superfamily level. HHblits and Cascade
PSI-BLAST performed better than C-HMM for four families of [3-rich
folds, i.e. Fibronectin—type—III, PDZ—domain-like, Concanavalin-like
lectins, RNA—binding domains and E—set domains, (Supplementary
Figure S10). However, on an average, C—HMM could identify 14%
more homologues than Cascade PSI—BLAST, 17% more homologues
than Jackhmmer, 17% more homologues than HHblits and 48%
more true relationships than PSI-BLAST. For one of the families (peri-
plasmic-binding protein of the doubly wound fold type), 60% in—
crease in coverage was observed with C—HMM searches.

Performance of the selected programs varied at the family level
(Supplementary Figure S11). For some of the families, BLAST—based
methods performed better than HMM—based approaches. On an
average, PSI—BLAST, Cascade PSI—BLAST, Jackhmmer, HHblits and
C—HMM could cover 61, 75 67, 70 and 74%, respectively. For
Immunoglobulin-like family, all the members within the same family
were not captured by Jackhmmer and C—HMM searches, but homo—
logues were covered from other families of the same superfamily.

Precision scores were also calculated at the fold level for all the
methods. It was noticed that high precision values (99.89%) were
obtained for direct sequence search based methods (e.g. PSI—
BLAST), while when sequence searches were cascaded, precision
values were dropped (C—HMM:43%). Highest precision scores
were incurred from PSI-BLAST, followed by Jackhmmer (97.72%)
and HHblits (94.96%) searches, representing the expected trade—off
between coverage and precision score. This showed that BLAST-
based approaches performed better for finding direct relationships
i.e. finding members of same family, while HMM—based approaches
could cover more distant members, including superfamily and fold
level relationships more effectively along with family members.

3.4.2 Comparison with protein structure-based methods

We also compared the performance of C—HMM with protein struc—
ture comparison—based method, Dali, to identify if C—HMM can re-
late two superfamilies comparably to Dali. We performed this
analysis on SCOP folds with many superfamilies (TIM,
Immunoglobulin and Ferredoxin folds). We found that Dali can effi—
ciently make cross—superfamily connections using 3D structures of
proteins. Yet, C—HMM is comparable even with mere sequence in—
formation. For example, in TIM fold, Dali could identify 16 superfa—
milies, while C—HMM could connect 12 superfamilies (Fig. 5). Both
Jackhmmer and Cascade PSI—BLAST could not identify any cross
superfamily connections. In Ferredoxin fold, Dali and C—HMM
could cover 25 and 22 superfamilies, respectively (Supplementary
Figure S12), while in Immunoglobulin fold, Dali searches could not
identify any cross superfamily connections but both Jackhmmer and
C—HMM could capture sequence neighbors from Fibronection type
III superfamily (Supplementary Figure S13).

3.4.3 Comparison with protein domain alignment based methods

In iterative sequence searches, misleading alignments such as exten—
sion of alignments in unrelated proteins domains can lead to con—
tamination of PSSM resulting in higher number of false connections.
PSI—Search is a method which masks errors caused by HOE.
Therefore, we also compared the performance of C—HMM with

Fig. 5. Comparison of cross-superfamily connections (in TIM fold) identified
by various methods

PSI—Search on ten superfamilies. We found that PSI—Search is a
highly selective method and it did not identify any false connections,
while C-HMM could identify higher number of hits but was not as
selective as PSI—Search for four superfamilies (Fig. 6). We also found
that C—HMM was more advantageous in connecting different super-
families as compared with PSI—Search. For example, when we

performed C—HMM searches we could also identify many cross
superfamily connections among Immunoglobulin, Fibronectin type
III and PKD domain superfamilies, all of which belongs to
Immunoglobulin fold.

3.5 Comparison of performance of C—HMM with
Custom—HMM

We then compared the performance of C—HMM and Custom—HMM
with respect to time required for each sequence search. When cover—
age was compared at the fold level, we noticed better or equal per—
formance of Custom—HMM in comparatively lesser time as shown
in Supplementary Figure 814. In Ferredoxin and P-loop containing
nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases families, we could gather equal
coverage scores by both the modules of C—HMM, but the time taken
by Custom—HMM was relatively very less. However, for B—grasp
and galactose—binding families, we also captured higher coverage
scores in comparatively lesser time. This shows that implementing
Custom—HMM module can effectively reduce the computational
timings for the sequence searches without compromising much on
coverage.

4 Conclusions

We have addressed the classical problem of remote homology detec—
tion and proposed a generalized protocol that can be used against
any protein sequence database to identify distant evolutionary
relationships. Our approach also highlights the importance of inter-
mediate sequences to understand difficult protein relationships.
C—HMM approach, described in this article, has been demonstrated
to be powerful in identifying connections across protein domains
that share the same fold but are structurally and functionally very di-
verse. It is possible to search the large non—redundant sequence data—
bases using this approach to achieve maximum coverage.

Fig 6. Comparison of performance of C-HMM and PSI-search

showed the universal applicability of this protocol. Hence, it can
be used on growing genomic databases to assign probable func—
tions to putative and uncharacterized sequences in the sequenced
genomes. Development of such algorithms is also important for
protein fold assignment and can further facilitate genome annota—
tion process. However, a clear trade—off between coverage and pre—
cision score was observed, suggesting that prior selection of
sequence search algorithm could lead to efficient remote homology
detection. For instance, PSI—BLAST or HHblits can be used to rec—
ognize close homologues, since these methods can find direct rela—
tionships more easily and accurately as compared with any other
available methods. On the other hand, if we are interested in find-
ing relationships within superfamily/fold level, cascaded sequence
searches are more promising.

Although C—HMM approach can effectively scan large sequence
space, there is need for further improvement, since a complete cover—
age was not captured for all families. Inclusion of other protein par-
ameters, such as secondary structures and sequence motifs, can also
be implemented in available algorithms to scan the sequence data—
bases. By reducing the number of hits to be used as queries for the
next generation, a significant reduction in the search time against
large databases (e.g. NCBI nr database) could be achieved by our
custom—HMM module. Nevertheless, time required for the Cascade
searches are higher than other methods (Supplementary Table S3).
Inclusion of structural parameters, along with mapping domain
boundaries and masking of HOE, will also help in the reduction of
cross—connections among other members of same classes of SCOP
database thereby reducing false positives. Another source of limita-
tion is lack of intermediate sequences available in protein sequence
databases, which could lead to lesser coverage. Alternate
approaches, such as generation of artificial sequences, appear to be
highly attractive to fill sequence space, especially when combined
with cascaded sequence searches (Mudgal et al., 2014). We believe
that the C—HMM protocol makes significant advance in the area of
remote homology detection, and will be very useful approach to as—
sign putative functions and folds to protein sequences. We recom—
mend its usage for genome annotation pipelines due to its speed,
reliability, efficiency and database independency.

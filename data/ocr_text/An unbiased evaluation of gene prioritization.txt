ABSTRACT

Motivation: Gene prioritization aims at identifying the most promising
candidate genes among a large pool of candidates—so as to
maximize the yield and biological relevance of further downstream
validation experiments and functional studies. During the past few
years, several gene prioritization tools have been defined, and
some of them have been implemented and made available through
freely available web tools. In this study, we aim at comparing
the predictive performance of eight publicly available prioritization
tools on novel data. We have performed an analysis in which 42
recently reported disease-gene associations from literature are used
to benchmark these tools before the underlying databases are
updated.

Results: Cross-validation on retrospective data provides performance
estimate likely to be overoptimistic because some of the data sources
are contaminated with knowledge from disease-gene association. Our
approach mimics a novel discovery more closely and thus provides
more realistic performance estimates. There are, however, marked
differences, and tools that rely on more advanced data integration
schemes appear more powerful.

1 INTRODUCTION

A major challenge in human genetics is to discover novel disease-
causing genes, both for Mendelian and complex disorders. Iden-
tifying disease genes is a crucial ﬁrst step in unraveling molecular
networks underlying diseases, and thus understanding disease
mechanisms, also toward the development of effective therapies.
The discovery of a novel disease gene often starts with a cyto-
genetic study, a linkage analysis, a high-throughput omics experi-
ment or a genome-wide association study (GWAS). However,
these studies do not always pinpoint the disease gene uniquely,
but often result in large lists of candidate genes that are poten-
tially relevant (Hardy and Singleton, 2009). Moreover, recent

advances in next-generation sequencing offer promising
opportunities to explore the genomic alterations of patients
(Schuster, 2008). However, thousands of mutations in hundreds
of genes are often detected, among which only a few are in fact
linked to the genetic condition of interest (Lupski et al., 2010).
The experimental validation of these candidate genes, for in-
stance, through resequencing, pathway or expression analysis,
is still expensive and time consuming. An efﬁcient way to
reduce the validation cost is to narrow down the large list of
candidate genes to a small and manageable set of highly promis-
ing genes, a process called gene prioritization. Prioritization in
the past was achieved manually by geneticists and biologists and
was mainly based on their own expertise. Nowadays, biologists
and geneticists can use computational approaches that can
handle and analyze the large amount of genomic data currently
available.

In the past few years, many gene prioritization methods have
been proposed, some of which have been implemented into pub-
licly available tools that users can freely access and use
(Doncheva et al., 2012; Moreau et al., 2012; Oti, 2011; Piro
et al., 2012; Tifﬁn, 2011, Tranchevent et al., 2010). Information
about these tools is summarized in our Gene Prioritization Portal
(http://www.esat.ku1euven.be/gpp) that currently describes 33
prioritization tools. This web site has been designed to help re-
searchers to carefully select the tools that best correspond to their
needs. For instance, only few tools can prioritize the whole
genome, which can be necessary when no positive regions can
be identiﬁed beforehand, or when selecting candidates for a
medium-throughput screen (instead of low-throughput valid-
ation). Another example is the study of a poorly characterized
disorder for which a prioritization tool not relying on a set of
known disease genes might be more suited. Recently, several
studies have demonstrated that gene prioritization tools can
help geneticists to discover novel disease genes (Calvo et al.,
2006; Thienpont et al., 2010). For instance, a KIFIA mutation
was discovered in hereditary spastic paraparesis patients after
KIFIA was predicted to be the best candidate gene from the
locus using multiple prioritization tools (Erlich et al., 2011).
Another study discovered homozygous mutations in the
PT RF—CA VIN gene in patients with congenital generalized
lipodystrophy with muscle rippling after PT RF— CA VIN was pre-
dicted as the most probable candidate gene for high expression in
muscle and adipose tissue (Rajab et al., 2010). A third
study identiﬁed the HHEX gene to be associated with Type

2 diabetes (T2D) in a Dutch cohort after investigating the T2D-
susceptibility loci using candidate gene prioritization
(Vliet-Ostaptchouk et al., 2008).

However, beyond these conceptual differences, one essential
parameter to consider when selecting gene prioritization tools is
their respective performance—that is, their ability to identify the
true positive genes as promising candidate genes to maximize the
yield of the follow-up experimental validation. A common standard
in bioinformatics is to estimate the performance with a bench-
mark analysis. Several publications that introduce a novel pri-
oritization approach also describe a comparative benchmark
with several existing methods (Hutz et al., 2008; Kohler et al.,
2008; Thornblad et al., 2007). However, these benchmarks are
most of the time cross-validations of gold-standard disease data-
sets (e.g. known data). Therefore, the estimation of the
performance is likely an overestimate of the real performance
(i.e. on novel data). Because different types of data are depend-
ent on each other (e. g. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway mem-
bership and MEDLINE® abstracts), it becomes impossible to
remove all cross-talk effects between data sources (e. g. removing
MEDLINE data does not remove all information from the bio-
medical literature since much of it is present in GO and KEGG)
to prevent contamination of the prediction of the disease gene by
actual retrospective knowledge of this association. This makes it
challenging to create benchmarks on retrospective data that are
indicative of the performance of the method in an actual research
setting. Next to benchmarking, some studies use several
prioritization methods to analyze disease-associated loci,
mostly for Type 2 diabetes and obesity (Elbers et al., 2007;
Teber et al., 2009; Tifﬁn et al., 2006). However, the results
have not been experimentally validated, which means that it is
not possible to identify which methods made better predictions.
Also, a few studies combine computational and experimental
analysis: in silico-generated hypothesis are then validated
in vivo. We have, for instance, performed a computationally sup-
ported genetic screen in Drosophila that led to the identiﬁcation
of 12 novel atonal genetic interactors (Aerts et al., 2009).
Although useful, such studies often rely on the use of a single
tool and therefore cannot be used to compare different
approaches. They also give no indication of the performance
of the method in general, but only illustrate it on a single
well-validated case.

In this study, we aim at comparing the performance of several
freely accessible web-based gene prioritization tools on novel
data, which, to our knowledge, has never been performed
before. To this aim, we selected recently reported disease-gene
associations from literature and use several gene prioritization
tools to make predictions immediately after publication (typically
within 2 days). Our approach relies on the fact that, when the
prioritization tools are used, the novel disease-gene association of
interest is not yet included in the databases that underlie these
tools. As a consequence, our approach mimics a novel discovery,
and therefore, the estimation of the performance is more
accurate. It has to be mentioned that we compare tools and
not the underlying algorithms (we see a tool as an algorithm
plus some data sources), because this is what is most relevant
to geneticists.

2 METHODS

2.1 Gene prioritization tools

We aim at comparing the gene prioritization tools that can easily be used,
and therefore, only select the tools for which a free web-based implemen-
tation is available. The main objective is to assess the ability of the gene
prioritization tools to predict potential novel disease genes that can then
be experimentally validated. We have therefore not selected the tools
whose ranking strategies exclusively depend on text as they would most
likely work only when the novel disease gene was already considered a
good candidate gene before discovery. One exception is Candid, which
also uses other data sources beside MEDLINE (e.g. protein domains,
interactions and expression data). In total, we have selected eight tools:
Suspects (Adie et al., 2006), ToppGene (Chen et al., 2007), GeneDistiller
(Seelow et al., 2008), GeneWanderer (Kohler et al., 2008), Posmed
(Yoshida et al., 2009), Candid (Hutz et al., 2008), Endeavour (Aerts
et al., 2006) and Pinta (Nitsch et al., 2010). The tools are run with the
settings recommended by the developers. When applicable, multiple con-
ﬁgurations are deﬁned to explore several possibilities (for instance, several
ranking algorithms within one tool). Originally, Pinta was developed to
use expression data as input data, but here, we replace the continuous
data (coming from expression data) with binary data using training genes:
a I is inputted for each training gene, and a 0 is associated to the other
genes. For an overview of the tools, please see Supplementary Table S1.
All tools except Candid are used to prioritize a set of candidate genes
(from a chromosomal region), and Candid is used to prioritize the whole
genome. Pinta and Endeavour support both genome-wide and candidate
set based prioritizations, and are used for both in this study
(Endeavour-GW and Pinta-GW for genome-wide prioritization and
Endeavour-CS and Pinta-CS for candidate set prioritization). In addition,
GeneWanderer can be run with up to four different ranking strategies
(random walk, diffusion kernel, shortest path and direct interaction). We
present the results for the ﬁrst two strategies (GeneWanderer-RW for
random walk, GeneWanderer-DK for diffusion kernel) because they
have been showed to outperform the other two, simpler, approaches
(Kohler et al., 2008) and since they can be efﬁciently used with many
training genes. The performance of Posmed shows a strong dependency
on the set of keywords used as an input, and we ran it twice with different
inputs. In the ﬁrst run, we use the complete keyword set (Posmed-KS),
and in the second, we only use the name of the disease (Posmed-DN).
GeneDistiller is trained with both genes and keywords. These keywords
are then used to ﬁnd additional genes through the mining of Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), which, in our case, has less
inﬂuence since OMIM is already used to derive the training genes. We
therefore consider that GeneDistiller is trained with genes only. Candid is
the only tool that can also be trained with disease-speciﬁc tissues, and
when available, tissues relevant to the disease under study are used.
Notice that suspects went ofﬂine during our study after the 27th associ-
ation and is not supported anymore (E.Adie, personal communication);
therefore, Suspects results are based on 27 associations over 42.

2.2 Validation dataset

The validation dataset is built by mining the scientiﬁc literature to iden-
tify the recently discovered disease-gene associations. This is achieved
manually to avoid false-positive associations. We select six journals
that frequently publish papers that describe such associations: Nature
Genetics, American Journal of Medical Genetics ( Part A/Part B ),
Human Genetics, Human Molecular Genetics, and Human Mutation. We
select all novel disease-gene associations regardless of the disease under
study, of the methodology used, and of whether the ﬁndings are con-
ﬁrmed or not. Novelty is assessed by using OMIM (McKusick, 1998), the
Genetic Association Database (Becker et al., 2004), GoPubmed (Doms
and Schroeder, 2005) and GeneCards (Safran et al., 2010). More pre-
cisely, we assess novelty at the gene level, and therefore, novel mutations

within already known genes are not considered. This process was kept
active for 6 months (May 15—November 15, 2010) and led to a collection
of 42 associations (see Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). For each
association, the tools are run as soon as the association is identiﬁed fol-
lowing the deﬁned workﬂow (see later). By doing this, we simulate as
much as possible the prediction of a novel disease gene, since the under-
lying databases are still unaware of the association. Once an association is
identiﬁed, the exact inputs for the different tools have to be deﬁned. For
instance, ToppGene, GeneDistiller, GeneWanderer, Pinta and Endeavour
require training genes (genes already known to be associated to the disease
under study), whereas Suspects, Posmed, GeneDistiller and Candid re-
quire keywords that describe the disease. Training genes and keywords
are collected from the corresponding OMIM pages, Genetic Association
Database (GAD) pages and from recently published reviews when pos-
sible. BioMart (Haider et al., 2009) is used to map between gene symbols

and tool-speciﬁc gene identiﬁers (e. g. EntrezGene or Ensembl identiﬁers).
As mentioned earlier, most of the tools in addition require a set of candi-
date genes (from the whole genome). Several tools accept chromosomal
coordinates, whereas some prefer cytogenetics bands. For each associ-
ation, we select the cytogenetics bands that cover ~10Mb around the
novel disease gene and derive the chromosomal coordinates. We choose
10 Mb to obtain on average at least 100 candidate genes. Once again,
BioMart is used to retrieve speciﬁc gene identiﬁers. For an overview of
the inputs for the 42 associations, please see Supplementary Table S3.

The resulting 42 novel disease-gene associations do not represent a
homogeneous set. Therefore, we have divided them into conﬁrmed
(for monogenic diseases, the mutation is found in at least two unrelated
patients; for multifactorial diseases, a GWAS is replicated in a separate
cohort), intermediate (a single study, but additional functional evidence is
provided) and unconﬁrmed (a single study) associations.

2.3 Performance measures

For each tool, we then assess its ability to identify the novel disease genes
as promising genes using several statistical measures. We ﬁrst compute
the median of the rank ratio over all associations. We preferably use rank
ratio over rank because tools do not necessarily return the same number
of candidate genes even when fed with the same inputs. In addition, we
also draw the boxplots of these rank ratios to give a more comprehensive
view of tool performance. Another method to compare the tools is to
build the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and to compute
the area under the curve (AUC) as an estimate of the global performance.
To compare the tools even further, we computed the true-positive rates
when setting the threshold for validation at the top 5% (True Positive
Rate (TPR) in top 5% of candidates), 10% (TPR in top 10%) and 30%
(TPR in top 30%). This is motivated by the fact that, in a real situation,
the number of candidate genes to assay often needs to be limited because
of ﬁnancial and time constraints. We have selected three thresholds that
represent reasonable biological hypotheses, as we previously illustrated in
a genetic screen (Aerts et al., 2009). The corresponding TPR measures are
used to estimate how efﬁcient the tools are if only the top 5, 10 or 30%
candidate genes would be assayed. Notice that these values correspond to
the shape of the lower end of the ROC curve (the sharper the curve, the
higher the TPR). There are cases for which some tools are unable to
identify the novel disease gene at all; therefore, we include a response
rate. It is deﬁned as the percentage of associations for which each tool
does return a prioritization result for the novel disease gene (in some cases,
a tool will not return any result, for example, because it could not correctly
map the gene identiﬁer or some candidates are otherwise ﬁltered out). For
example, if one of the 42 disease genes could not be ranked (i.e. gene is
missing), the response rate drops down to ~98% (41/42).

Lastly, we also derive a heat map to detect any correlation
between tools by computing the pairwise cosine similarity of the rankings
pre-sented in Table 2 (see Supplementary Fig. S1).

2.4 Integration of predictions

To get an estimate of the usefulness of a meta-predictor, the results of the
different tools are combined using the order statistics as within
Endeavour. Integration happens separately for the genome-wide tools
and candidate set based tools, and tools that return only few rankings
(Suspects and Posmed) were not included. For each experiment, the gene
identiﬁers of the different tools are mapped using Biomart. To avoid
getting artiﬁcially favorable rankings, the size of the merged ranking is
set to the maximum size of the underlying rankings.

3 RESULTS

The overall ranking results of all gene prioritization tools are
summarized in Table 2, the complete results are presented in
Supplementary Tables S9 and S10. These results have also
been added to the Gene Prioritization Portal (http://www.esat.
kuleuven.be/gpp).

3.1 Performance measures

When considering the median of the rank ratios, GeneDistiller,
Endeavour-CS and Suspects are the tools that perform the best
on this benchmark (11.11, 11.16 and 12.77, respectively). They
are followed by Endeavour-GW (15.49), ToppGene (16.8),
Candid (18.1), Pinta-CS (18.87), Pinta-GW (19.03), GeneWan-
derer-RW (22.11), GeneWanderer-DK (22.97), Posmed-KS
(31.44) and Posmed-DN (45.45). The boxplots presented in
Figure 1 illustrate that both GeneDistiller and Endeavour-CS
perform better than the other candidate set based prioritization

GW performs slightly better than Pinta-GW and Candid

When considering the response rate, Endeavour (both modes),
Candid and Pinta (both modes) performed the best study with
100% closely followed by ToppGene, GeneDistiller and
GeneWanderer-RW with more than 95% (meaning that only
one or two associations are missing). At the other hand of the
spectrum, Posmed-KS and Posmed-DN only work for about half
of the experiments in our benchmark (47.6% and 50%,
respectively).

When we compare the tools based on the global AUC (see

that none of the approaches is clearly performing better than the
other. However, we postulate that, in our case, the most import-
ant section of the ROC curve is the beginning and therefore use

three other measures, the true-positive rates at 5, 10 and 30%,
respectively. These measures indicate how efﬁcient the tools
would be if only the top candidate genes would be assayed.

Considering the TPR in top 10 and 30%, we can observe a
similar trend. Indeed, at 10%, GeneDistiller is ﬁrst with a rate of
47.6% (20 associations found over 42), followed by both
ToppGene and Endeavour-CS with 42.9% (18 associations).
However, at 30%, the best tool is Endeavour-CS (90.5%, 38
associations), followed by GeneDistiller (78.6%, 33 associ-
ations). The other tools show smaller TPR at both levels:
Pinta-CS (31%, 71.4%), Suspects (33.3%, 63%),
GeneWanderer-RW (26.2%, 61.9%), GeneWanderer-DK
(21.4%, 52.4%), Posmed-KS (7.1%, 23.8%) and Posmed-DN
(11.9%, 23.8%). Among the genome-wide prioritization tools,
Endeavour-GW shows the highest TPR in top 10 and 30%
(38.1%, 71.4%), followed by Candid (33.3%, 64.3%) and
Pinta-GW (31%, 71.4%).

3.2 Correlations

Supplementary Figure S1 shows the heat map of the novel
disease-gene ranking positions for all tools in this study. For
the tools that have two modes (i.e. Posmed, GeneWanderer,
Endeavour and Pinta), the two modes are highly correlated
(>0.89). There is also a signiﬁcant correlation between Candid
and GeneWanderer-DK (0.82). The other values are within 0.4
and 0.7, indicating that all tools are moderately correlated.

3.3 Integration of predictions

Our meta-analysis reveals that the best results are obtained when
predictions are combined over the different tools (see Table 2 and
Supplementary Table S11). For genome-wide tools, all perform-
ance measures are improved by the integrative method (e. g.
median of 12.45 for the meta-predictor versus 15.49 for
Endeavour-GW). Similar results are obtained for the candidate
set based tools (e.g. median of 6.99 for the meta-predictor versus
11.11 for GeneDistiller), although the TPR in the top 30% of the
integrative method is still lower than for Endeavour-CS (83.3%
versus 90.5%).

4 DISCUSSION

We aim at assessing the usefulness of eight gene prioritization
tools that are freely available via web applications. We have built
a validation based on 42 recently discovered disease-gene

associations from literature containing novel genes for both
monogenic conditions and complex disorders. We have selected
novel disease-gene associations regardless of their strength and of
the underlying methodology. To mimic a real discovery, we have
run the tools as soon as the article appeared online so that all
databases used for gene prioritization are still not contaminated
by the knowledge of the novel disease-gene association. This also
means that we had to exclude tools that query MEDLINE online
because their results would be biased.

We want to compare the performance of the tools even if the
inputs are different (genes versus keywords, genome-wide versus
candidate set). Among the eight gene prioritization tools that we
have analyzed in this study, only Endeavour, Candid and Pinta
have been used for genome-wide prioritization. The input
data for Endeavour and Pinta are training genes, whereas
Candid requires keywords. The gene prioritization tools that
we have used to prioritize candidate genes within a region of
interest are Suspects, ToppGene, GeneWanderer, Posmed,
GeneDistiller, and again Endeavour and Pinta. Suspects and
Posmed are trained with keywords, and the other tools require
training genes. We have extensively searched through literature
and dedicated databases to identify as many reliable training
genes as possible for the disease of interest as well as a set of
appropriate keywords to derive fair and meaningful compari-
sons. However, different, and possibly better, results might be
obtained by reﬁning the inputs.

Our validation is too small to claim that the differences among
tools are signiﬁcant. However, a trend can still be observed,
GeneDistiller and Endeavour-CS consistently appear as the
best tools when looking at all performance measures. It is inter-
esting to notice that the best results are, in general, obtained with
tools that use many data types in conjunction (up to eight for
Endeavour, when compared with the three data sources used by
Posmed), but there is no perfect correlation. This is in agreement
with the conclusion of the recent review by Tifﬁn et al. (2009),
who indicate that successful computational applications will be
facilitated by improved data integration.

All tools except Posmed have a high response rate ranging
from 88 to 100%, meaning that at least 37 of the 42 novel disease
genes are prioritized (or 24 of 27 for Suspects). However, the
response rates for Posmed-KS and Posmed-DN are 47.6% and
50%, respectively, which can be explained by the fact that
Posmed also acts as a ﬁlter on the candidate genes to obtain a
reduced list of genes in the end. There are therefore cases for
which the novel disease gene has been removed by the ﬁlter. This
is different from the other tools for which missing genes basically
correspond to genes that are not recognized by the tool (it hap-
pens most of the time with poorly characterized genes, such as
C200rf54). Another special case is Suspects that went ofﬂine
during the validation and therefore could only be validated
with the ﬁrst 27 associations. We therefore calculated the re-
sponse rate only on the ﬁrst 27 associations.

Two types of tools can be distinguished, the ones that are
trained with already-known genes and the ones that are trained
with descriptive keywords. It appears that gene-based tools seem
to work better than keyword-based tools (the average of medians
is 17.2 for gene-based tools and 27 for keyword based tools;
similar results are obtained with the other measures, see
Supplementary Table S8). This could be because we use, in

general, more genes than keywords for training (18.8 genes on an
average for six keywords). This also indicates that more key-
words might be needed to model a disease and that a small
text (such as an OMIM entry) might even be necessary (van
Driel et al., 2006).

There is in general an agreement between the ﬁve performance
measures we use throughout our study. One notable exception
exists for ToppGene, whose AUC is 66%, and corresponds to
rank 10th (out of the 12 prioritization tools). In contrast, its
associated TPR in top 10% is 42.9%, which corresponds to
rank second. This apparent contradiction can be explained by
observing Figure 2, in which the ROC curve exhibits a
non-convex shape. This is because ToppGene either ranks the
novel disease gene on top or at the bottom (i.e. the disease genes
are rarely ranked in the middle). Therefore, the TPR in top 10%
will be high because it only takes into account the top of the list,
while the AUC will be lower because it basically behaves like an
average over all cases. Another important point is that our ob-
servations are in line with the ‘no free lunch’ theorem. Indeed,
each tool can perform better than all the others for some cases,
or, in other words, none of the tools outperforms another on the
complete dataset (if we do not consider the special case of
Posmed that also acts as a ﬁlter).

Posmed-KS has been trained with the complete keyword set,
whereas Posmed-DN has been trained only with the disease
name. The median rank ratio is 31.44 when the complete key-
word set is used and drops to 45.45 when only the disease name is
inputted. If we only compare the results over the 19 associations
for which both tools are able to prioritize the novel disease gene,
the difference becomes even larger (29.6 and 50, respectively, for
Posmed-KS and Posmed-DN). Altogether, these results indicate
that Posmed does not rely on the use of the single disease name
and that the extra keywords are indeed important. It can be
observed that the performance measures for Posmed are worse
than for the other tools in our benchmark study. However, when
looking at the individual ranks, it can be observed that Posmed
returns far fewer genes than the other tools because it also acts as
a ﬁlter. As a result, the rank ratios are in general larger and the
performance measures are therefore worse. As such, it becomes
difﬁcult to fairly compare Posmed with the other tools because
our measures of performance naturally penalize the fact that
Posmed returns prioritizations for a limited set of candidates.
Changing our performance measures to counterbalance this
effect would then give an unfair advantage to Posmed because
it returns prioritizations only for the ‘safer bets’.

GeneWanderer has also been run twice with different network
algorithms: random walk and diffusion kernel. The respective
performances are very similar although the random walk ap-
proach is performing a little bit better than the diffusion kernel
albeit non-signiﬁcant (2211—2297 for median rank ratio — simi-
lar differences are observed with the other measures). The heat
map indicates a strong correlation (>0.9, see Supplementary
Fig. S1) between the two modes, which was expected since apply-
ing diffusion to a kernel can be interpreted as equivalent to
applying a random walk on the underlying network.
Altogether, this indicates that these two algorithms are similar.

Endeavour and Pinta are used to prioritize both the whole
genome (Endeavour-GW and Pinta-GW) and the deﬁned
chromosomal region (Endeavour-CS and Pinta-CS), allowing

us to identify the inﬂuence of the size of the gene list to prioritize.
The median rank ratio is better for Endeavour-CS (11.16) than
for Endeavour-GW (15.49) in our benchmark. The difference
remains, albeit smaller, when considering the AUC and the
TPR in top 10 and 30%.

The same training genes are used, and therefore the observed
difference is only caused by extending the small candidate gene
set to the whole genome. This conﬁrms previous ﬁndings that
prioritizing the whole genome is more difﬁcult than prioritizing a
rather small positive locus. The heat map indicates that the two
Endeavour modes are strongly correlated as expected since the
core algorithm is the same in both modes (>0.9, see
Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrary, the results for both Pinta
modes are similar (correlation of 0.99) and seem to indicate that
the size of the candidate set does not inﬂuence this algorithm.

In this study, we consider the tools as off-the-shelf solutions
and use them as recommended by the developers without
ﬁne-tuning of the parameters. However, an important feature
that might inﬂuence the results is the date of the last data
update. The latest genomic data (still prior to discoveries con-
sidered in this study) is likely to give the best results because it
will model more accurately what is currently known, when com-
pared with data that are 2 years old. In our setup, we have no
control over the genomic data used and cannot identify whether
variation in performance among tools can be explained by this.

In addition, the quality of both the data sources and the inte-
gration methodologies are also inﬂuencing the outcome of the
prioritization process. However, we aim at estimating the useful-
ness of some prioritization tools for geneticists. Therefore an
in-depth comparison of the implementation of the tools is
beyond the scope of this study.

It is important to notice that the 42 novel disease-gene asso-
ciations do not represent a homogeneous set. Indeed, the median
of the rank ratios over the tools show that some associations
seem to be easier to predict than others. This also explains why
all tools are moderately correlated on the heat map (>04). A
plausible explanation is the disparity in the available data be-
tween the novel disease genes. Since only little data can be gath-
ered for poorly characterized genes, such as C200rf54, they are
more difﬁcult to prioritize. However, we also hypothesize that
the nature of the underlying genetic disorder as well as the qual-
ity of the reported association might inﬂuence the ability of the
tools to correctly predict that association. We have therefore
divided the associations between conﬁrmed, intermediate and
unconﬁrmed. Among the 42 associations, 23 are conﬁrmed, 8
are intermediate and 11 are unconﬁrmed (see Supplementary
Table S2). We hypothesize that this might inﬂuence our valid-
ation since some unconﬁrmed associations might in fact be spuri-
ous. We observe that Suspects and ToppGene perform better for
the 23 conﬁrmed associations than for the 19 unconﬁrmed ones
(see Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). However, this trend is not
always shared as the situation is opposite for GeneDistiller and
GeneWanderer. Although informative, these comparisons are
not signiﬁcant due to the small number of associations.

In our validation dataset, there are 17 monogenic diseases and
25 multifactorial disorders (see Supplementary Tables S6 and
S7). It has been shown that it is more difﬁcult to make predic-
tions for multifactorial diseases than for monogenic diseases
(Linghu et al., 2009). Our results however seem to indicate

An unbiased evaluation of gene prioritization tools

 

that not all tools are inﬂuenced by the intrinsic complexity of
multifactorial diseases. For instance, Endeavour and ToppGene
seem to perform better for monogenic conditions while
GeneWanderer and Suspects perform better for complex dis-
orders. However, the size of our validation dataset does not
allow for a complete statistical analysis. Larger validation data-
sets and real predictive studies will be pursued to complement
our preliminary study.

We are aware of the limited coverage of available literature in
human genetics in our study that report novel disease-gene asso-
ciations. However, we aimed at estimating the real performance
of gene prioritization tools and therefore have decided to keep
under strict control all the factors that could potentially bias the
benchmark. We were further interested in ﬁnding novel
disease-gene associations for deﬁning a proper benchmark, and
there is no guarantee that these associations are uniformly dis-
tributed over the whole literature. We have used journals about
genetic disorders, in general, and favor journals that report novel
associations and have avoided specialized journals that focus on
few diseases to avoid introducing bias toward one disease class.
Our choice of the six selected journals may not be perfect, but
they allowed us to cover most disease types and most situations.

Several studies have shown that combining predictions of sev-
eral tools lead to even better predictions (Elbers et al., 2007;
Tifﬁn et al., 2006). However, no performance criteria were
used to select the tools to be combined. With this comparison
of tools, we ease the selection of the most efﬁcient tools, whose
combination may lead to more accurate predictions. In addition,
we report that the meta-predictors that integrate the predictions
made by several tools perform better than the best individual
tools as already reported (Thornblad et al., 2007).

Our results indicate that cross-validation based benchmarks
tend to overestimate the real predictive performance. Indeed,
all the tools for which such a benchmark exists have lower
AUC than anticipated using our dataset (see Supplementary
Table S12). We therefore believe that developers should take
extra care when benchmarking their tools as to avoid these pit-
falls. Also, some hard constraints have made this study small
enough not to reach signiﬁcance (e. g. only few tools have a pro-
grammatically queryable interface).

As already discussed in Moreau et al. (2012), this ﬁeld needs to
consolidate through improved benchmarking efforts due to the
lack of a ground truth for evaluating the performance of priori-
tization methods. Therefore, we see a need for a large-scale com-
munity effort to compare multiple tools across common
prospective benchmarks. We hope our work represents the ﬁrst
step toward a collaborative effort to tackle this problem at a
larger scale.

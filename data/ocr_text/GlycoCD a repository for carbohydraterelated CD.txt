ABSTRACT

Summary: The open access comprehensive GlycoCD database ap-
plication is for representation and retrieval of carbohydrate-related
clusters of differentiation (CDs). The main objective of this database
platform is to provide information about interactions of carbohydrate
moieties with proteins that are important for identification of specific
cell surface molecule with a focus on the integration of data from
carbohydrate microarray databases. GlycoCD database comprises
two sections: the carbohydrate recognition CD and glycan CD. It
allows easy access through a user-friendly web interface to all
carbohydrate-defined CDs and those that interact with carbohydrates
along with other relevant information.

Availability: The database is freely available at http://glycosciences
.de/glycocd/index.php

1 INTRODUCTION

The clusters of differentiation (CD) antigens are cell surface-
expressed antigens deﬁned by monoclonal antibodies. The
great value of the CD nomenclature, validated and approved
as part of the International Union of Immunological Societies
nomenclature (Zola et al., 2003), is to provide a uniﬁed system of
classiﬁed antigens useful both for biomedical research and clin-
ical practice. The CD antibodies have been categorized during
the past 28 years in Human Leucocyte Differentiation Antigens
(HLDA) workshops (Heddy Zola, 2007; Mason et al., 2002). The
CD antigens are expressed on human hematopoietic cells (T and
B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, myeloid cells, erythrocytes
and platelets), speciﬁc types of endothelial and epithelial cells.
The information for CD antigens expands from cellular and
tissue expression to biochemical structure, genetic background
and to its functional impact in a given cellular environment.
The interactions of the immune system are mediated by cell sur-
face glycoproteins and glycolipids (Schwartz-Albiez, 2009). Most
of the CD antibodies recognize the protein moiety of surface,
membrane integral macromolecules, but some of them detect
oligosaccharide structures that are linked to either glycoproteins
or glycosphingolipids.

During the HLDA conference 2000, a separate workshop on
carbohydrate and lectin CDs was established considering the
increasing interest and advance in research in unraveling cellular

protein—glycan interactions (Schwartz-Albiez, 2002). The object-
ive was to initiate a more comprehensive compilation of mono-
clonal antibody-deﬁned carbohydrate structures and lectins
differentially expressed on human leucocytes and to provide
an appropriate classiﬁcation within the CD nomenclature.
Some carbohydrate CD antibodies were re-organized into sub-
groups of CDs because of their reactivity with variations of
certain oligosaccharide structures. For example, CD15 (blood
group Lewis x, LeX) received additional subgroups of CDl5s
(sialyl Lewis x), CDl5u (3sulfo Lewis x) and CDl5su
(6 sulfo-sialyl Lewis x). CD60 was subdivided into CD60a (the
oligosaccharide structure of the disialo-ganglioside GD3 and
related glycans), CD60b (9-0-acetylated sialic acid GD3) and
CD600 (7-0-acetylated sialic acid GD3). CD75 comprises lacto-
saminyl sequences into CD75 (non-sialylated lactosamines) and
CD75s (sialylated lactosamines) (Mandal, et al. 2012). The oligo-
saccharides of the CD75s subgroup have a different functional
impact as modulators of adhesion to certain lectins such as
Siglecs (Cao et al., 2008). Due to the high complexity of oligo-
saccharide structures, antibodies of a particular carbohydrate
CD may bind to variations of the same oligosaccharide type
and consequently display different cellular staining patterns.
For instance, this may be due to variations in the linkage of
the terminal sialic acid (052-6 versus 052-3), to oligosaccharide
chains which extend the glycan epitope (glycotope) recognized
by the respective antibody or by varying expression of the gly-
cotope on different glycosphingolipids and/ or glycoproteins on a
speciﬁc cell type. In general, most carbohydrate CDs deﬁne
histo-blood group antigens, which are characterized either by
their different fucosylation or sialylation.

This GlycoCD database now endeavours to provide
in-depth information about glycan CD antigens and those
CD-deﬁned surface receptors (lectins), which bind to glycan
structures.

2 METHODS

GlycoCD is a web-based, platform-independent, manually curated data-
base. All data were collected by comprehensively searching literature,
online resources and books. It has been designed as a relational database
and currently runs on an Apache server. This database has been imple-
mented using the open source MySQL database (http://www.mysql.com)
that serves as the back-end for storing all the carbohydrate-related
CD information along with related publications. PHP: Hypertext
Preprocessor was used to fetch data from the database, while both
PHP and HTML were used to make the web interface. The schematic
overview is provided in Fig. l. The database is presently hosted on a
server at glycoscience.de—a glycoinformatics web portal—and it will be
manually updated and maintained.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

GlycoCD is a collection of lectins and carbohydrates deﬁned by
CD antibodies that are differentially expressed primarily on
human leukocytes and also on certain endothelial and epithelial
cells. The database comprises information on 63 CD antigens
(out of 363 of total CD antigens as deﬁned in the HLDA 9
workshop). We have categorized these data within GlycoCD re-
pository into two sections: carbohydrate recognition CD anti-
gens and glycan CDs. For the convenience of the user,
glycan-related CDs can be searched either by the respective
CD number or the glycan-binding speciﬁcity. There is a tutorial
section describing the workﬁow in a simple manner with relevant
information about the respective CD. There are online resources
available which touch selective ﬁelds of CD: http://www.immu
nologylink.com/cdantigenhtml summarizes in short form infor-
mation about CD antigens/antibodies; http://pathologyoutlines
.com/cdmarkershtml provides information about the immuno-
histology of selected CDs and two databases: SugarBindDB
(http://sugarbind.expasy.org/sugarbind/) describes carbohydrate-
binding proteins in the ﬁeld of microbiology and GlycoEpitope
(http://www.glyco.is.ritsumei.ac.jp/epitope/) for carbohydrate
epitopes in general.

Our new database now provides user-friendly comprehensive
information about human CD CRDs and glycan epitopes
(glycotopes) and additionally links to other resources.

3.1 Carbohydrate recognition CD

The carbohydrate recognition CD section contains: (1) lectin
CDs that are classiﬁed within distinct lectin families such as
selectins or siglecs. (2) CD antigens other than lectin families
that have a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) deﬁned
by sequence homologies. For some of these, a functional inﬂu-
ence of the CRD has not yet been clariﬁed. (3) CD proteins that
are related to carbohydrate binding, in the way that interactions
with glycan moieties of other antigens inﬂuence their functional

activities. There are 44-carbohydrate recognition CDs reported
in this section.

Users can search these data from the ‘Browse’ menu. Each set
of data in this section contains information about synonyms of
this particular CD protein, its structure (also, three dimensional
information wherever available), amino acid and nucleic acid
sequence, cellular and tissue expression, function (and clinical
application), references, carbohydrate and other possible ligands
and further links to glycan array data. In glycan array informa-
tion, it has been linked to the Consortium of Functional
Glycomics database (Raman et al., 2006) and the Glyafﬁnity
database (Frank and Schloissnig, 2010). There is also a small
feature for ﬁnding interactions of non-GlycoCD/molecules
with GlycoCD.

3.2 Glycan CD

Here, glycan CDs that deﬁne oligosaccharide moieties linked to
glycoproteins and/or glycosphingolipids are included. There are
19 CDs reported in this section. Most of the CDs of this section
interact with several molecules. We have given information
about ligands if available or else linked it to the glycan array
database Glyafﬁnity for relative afﬁnity data.

Users can search these data from the ‘Browse’ menu. Each set
of data in this section contains information about Glycotope
(the carbohydrate epitope recognized by the respective
CD-antibody), synonyms of the particular CD, its molecular
structure, cellular and tissue expression, function (and clinical
application), ligands and useful references, further links to
GlycomeDB structure database (Ranzinger et al., 2008) with
their ids, Glycosciences.de structural database and to glycan
array data.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Transcription factor (TF) ChlP-seq datasets have
particular characteristics that provide unique challenges and
opportunities for motif discovery. Most existing motif discovery
algorithms do not scale well to such large datasets, or fail to report
many motifs associated with cofactors of the ChlP-ed TF.

Results: We present DREM E, a motif discovery algorithm specifically
designed to find the short, core DNA-binding motifs of eukaryotic
TFs, and optimized to analyze very large ChlP-seq datasets in
minutes. Using DREME, we discover the binding motifs of the the
ChlP-ed TF and many cofactors in mouse ES cell (mESC), mouse
erythrocyte and human cell line ChlP-seq datasets. For example, in
mESC ChlP-seq data for the TF Esrrb, we discover the binding motifs
for eight cofactor TFs important in the maintenance of pluripotency.
Several other commonly used algorithms find at most two cofactor
motifs in this same dataset. DREME can also perform discriminative
motif discovery, and we use this feature to provide evidence that
Sox2 and Oct4 do not bind in mES cells as an obligate heterodimer.
DREME is much faster than many commonly used algorithms, scales
linearly in dataset size, finds multiple, non-redundant motifs and
reports a reliable measure of statistical significance for each motif
found. DREME is available as part of the MEME Suite of motif-based
sequence analysis tools (http://meme.nbcr.net).

1 INTRODUCTION

It is estimated that the human genome contains 1500 transcription
factors (TFs) that play a key role in regulating transcription by
binding to the genome alone or in protein complexes (Vaquerizas
et al., 2009). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed
by high—throughput sequencing (ChIP—seq) is the current method
of choice for determining the genomic binding locations of a
TF. The resolution of ChIP—seq location data is such that the
actual binding location is typically within ~50 bp of the predicted
location (Wilbanks and Facciotti, 2010). A TF ChIP—seq experiment
generally yields hundreds to tens of thousands of predicted locations
(often called ‘ChIP—seq peaks’). In addition to providing evidence
of direct regulation by the TF proximity to individual genes, the
ChIP—seq data provide a rich resource for exploring the in vivo DNA—
binding afﬁnity of the ChIP—ed TF and cofactor TFs that bind DNA
in complex or nearby, and for discovering the identities of these
cofactors.

Ab initio motif discovery algorithms applied to ChIP—seq peak
regions can usually discover the DNA—binding motif of the ChIP—ed

TF. However, most existing algorithms have limitations that make
them less than ideal for discovering all the cofactor motifs in a
ChIP—seq dataset. One limitation of many popular algorithms is that
they do not scale well to inputs containing thousands of sequences.
As a result, many studies to date have used only a fraction (say
500 sequences) of the available ChIP—seq peak regions for motif
discovery, greatly decreasing the chances of discovering motifs for
infrequent cofactors. A second limitation is that many algorithms do
not provide reliable motif statistics to enable the biologist to discern
functional motifs from statistical artifacts. This limitation can cause
valid motifs to be ignored, or time to be wasted investigating random
motifs. A third limitation is that most algorithms do not allow two
ChIP—seq datasets to be directly compared, ﬁnding motifs that are
relatively enriched. This limitation makes it difﬁcult to determine
whether two TFs always bind as a heterodimer or even if the motif
for the ChIP—ed TF has been found at all. Other limitations possessed
by some algorithms that make them unsatisfactory for ChIP—seq data
analysis include only ﬁnding a single motif or being ‘hard—wired’ to
use a particular type of sequence (e. g. promoters).

Here, we describe a novel motif discovery algorithm lacking the
above limitations, and demonstrate how to use it to mine ChIP—
seq datasets for primary and cofactor motifs and for insights into
cooperative or indirect binding by TFs. We show that the new
algorithm is signiﬁcantly faster than several algorithms that are
commonly used for analyzing ChIP—seq datasets, yet is able to
discover substantially more cofactor motifs. The algorithm searches
for motifs expressed as simpliﬁed ‘regular expressions’ (consensus
sequences allowing wildcards but not variable length gaps). It
achieves speed partly by limiting its search to short motifs (up
to 8bp wide), which turns out to be ideal for identifying and
studying the DNA—binding motifs of monomeric eukaryotic TFs,
but may cause it to miss some wider motifs due to binding by
large TF complexes. Our new algorithm has some similarities with
a few existing, word—based algorithms such as Trawler (Ettwiller
et al., 2007) and Amadeus (Linhart et al., 2008)), but our approach
is simpler and we demonstrate that it ﬁnds substantially more
cofactor motifs. Consequently, our algorithm complements rather
than replaces existing motif discovery tools for the analysis of
ChIP—seq data.

2 METHODS
2.1 DREME: discriminative regular expression motif
elicitation

Our design objective for a motif discovery algorithm tailored to eukaryotic
ChIP—seq data is the ability to quickly discover multiple, short, non—
redundant, statistically signiﬁcant, discriminative motifs in extremely large
sets of short sequences. The focus on short (from 4 to 8bp) motifs is
motivated by the observation that this range encompasses the DNA—binding

region of most eukaryotic monomeric TFs, and existing algorithms can easily
ﬁnd the larger, more information—rich motifs characteristic of binding by TF
protein complexes. In the interest of computational speed, we restrict the
search for motifs to a simpliﬁed form of ‘regular expression’: words over
the IUPAC alphabet, which adds eleven wildcard characters to the standard
DNA alphabet, ACGT. For example, the binding motif of the Klf family
of TFs is well represented by the IUPAC regular expression (RE) motif
CMCRCCC (called a ‘CACC—box’), where M matches A or C and R matches
the purines A or G.

Our search for motifs is exhaustive for exact words (no wildcards), but
heuristic for words with wildcards, again in the interest of speed. To identify
statistically signiﬁcant, discriminative motifs, we compute the signiﬁcance
of the relative enrichment of each motif in two sets of sequences using the
Fisher’s Exact Test. This test computes the probability that the fraction of
sequences in the ﬁrst set matching the motif would be as great as observed
(or greater), given the fraction of matching sequences in the second set.
In a typical application of our approach, one set of sequences would be a
set of ChIP—seq peak regions from a TF ChIP—seq experiment, and the other
would either be similar data from a different ChIP—seq experiment or shufﬂed
versions of the ﬁrst sequences. To avoid problems with self—overlapping
motifs, we only count the number of sequences containing a motif (not the
number of occurrences of the motif) in each of the two datasets. However,
once the motif with the highest signiﬁcance has been found, all of its non—
overlapping occurrences in the ﬁrst set of sequences are aligned to create a
position—speciﬁc probability matrix (Stormo, 2000). Finally, to ﬁnd multiple,
non—redundant motifs in a set of sequences, we simply ‘erase’ the best motif
found by setting all its occurrences to a special letter that cannot match any
motif, and then repeat the search for motifs.

DREME implements this motif discovery approach. The input to DREME
is two sets of DNA sequences and a signiﬁcance threshold. The algorithm’s
outer loop performs a heuristic search of RE motifs, determines the most
signiﬁcant motif, reports it and erases all its occurrences in the input datasets.
The outer loop is repeated until no new motif has E —value less than the given
signiﬁcance threshold.

The central task of the DREME algorithm is searching the space of
RE motifs. Our approach uses a beam search that starts with a set of
highly signiﬁcant ‘seed’ RE motifs and attempts to ﬁnd more signiﬁcant
generalizations of them. To initialize the beam search, DREME computes the
signiﬁcance of each word (no wildcards) of length three to eight that occurs
in the positive sequences. DREME does this by counting how many positive
and negative sequences contain each word, and computing the (uncorrected)
p—value of the Fisher’s Exact Test. This is done in time linear in the size of
the datasets. The 100 most signiﬁcant words are then passed as ‘seed’ REs
to an inner loop that performs the beam search.

At each iteration of the inner loop, DREME considers all generalizations
of each seed RE that differ from the seed RE by containing exactly
one additional wildcard. If all the words that match a generalization of
the seed RE are signiﬁcant (uncorrected 1950.01), DREME estimates the
generalized RE’s statistical signiﬁcance, otherwise, the generalization is
discarded. To save computation time, DREME estimates the signiﬁcance of
candidate REs without scanning the input sequences. When all seed REs have
been generalized, DREME sorts the new, more general REs by estimated
signiﬁcance, and then computes the exact signiﬁcance of the top 100 to use
as seed REs in the next iteration. The inner loop stops when no seed RE can
be generalized to include an additional wildcard, typically after three or four
iterations.

To estimate the number of sequences matching a generalized RE, DREME
uses the fact that this is always equal to the size of the union of the matching
sets of two more speciﬁc REs, as shown in Supplementary Table S1. DREME
assumes that these two matching sets (RE1 and RE2) are independent samples
from a set of N sequences, so the size of the union (RE3) is given by

IREl | IREzl

IRE3| % IRE1|+|RE2|—T, (1)

where |RE| is the size of the set of sequences matching a given RE. For
example, if RE1 = ATGCQ is a seed RE, and RE2 = ATGCQ, which differs
from it only in the last position, is signiﬁcant, then DREME estimates the
number of positive (or negative) sequences matching the generalization
RE3 =ATGCK using Equation (1). DREME applies the Fisher’s Exact Test to
the estimated numbers of positive and negative sequences matching ATGCK
and caches the result for later use in estimating the numbers of sequences
matching ATGCQ and ATGCﬁ. By performing generalizations in the order
shown in Supplementary Table S 1, DREME efﬁciently estimates the numbers
of sequences matching a generalized RE.

2.2 Evaluating motif discovery

We evaluate DREME and compare it with a number of existing motif
discovery algorithms using several TF ChIP—seq datasets from mouse
embryonic stem cells (mES cells), mouse erythrocytes and a human
lymphoblastoid cell line. In our evaluation, we consider speed, ability to
identify the primary motif, identiﬁcation of secondary motifs and illustrate
the usefulness of being able to do discriminative motif discovery in ChIP—seq
datasets. To determine what motifs an algorithm discovers, we compare its
output motifs to a large panel of known motifs using the TOMTOM (Gupta
et al., 2007) algorithm and use gene expression data from the Gene
Expression Atlas (Kapushesky et al., 2010) to determine which TF among
TFs with similar DNA—binding afﬁnity may bind to secondary motifs.

2.2.1 Running motif discovery algorithms We run DREME using its
default settings. When only one set of sequences is input, DREME creates
a dinucleotide—shufﬂed version of the input sequence set as the negative
sequence set. For discriminative motif discovery, we provide two sets of
input sequences to DREME. In both cases, the signiﬁcance threshold for
motifs is E=0.05.

We compare the speed and accuracy of several popular motif
discovery algorithms with that of DREME using the 13 mESC ChIP—seq
datasets. Two of these algorithms [MEME (Bailey and Elkan, 1995) and
nestedMICA (Down and Hubbard, 2005)] are extremely slow when run
on more than 500 sequences, so we randomly choose 500 sequences from
each ChIP—seq dataset to create datasets of reduced size. We run the other
three algorithms [WEEDER (Pavesi et al., 2004), Trawler (Ettwiller et al.,
2007) and Amadeus (Linhart et al., 2008)] on the same datasets that were
used above with DREME. Where possible, we parameterize the programs to
search for motifs of 4—7 bp. The exceptions are WEEDER up to 8 bp; Trawler
minimum 4bp; Amadeus exactly 7 bp. The number of motifs to search for
is a required parameter for nestedMICA, and we set it to 10 to keep running
times reasonably short. (It does not ﬁnish running after 134h on the full—
size E2f1 dataset, which contains 20 699 sequences.) We set the maximum
number of motifs to ﬁnd to 20 for MEME; WEEDER, Trawler and Amadeus
have no such parameter. With MEME, we use a 0—order background model
and with nestedMICA we use a 0—order four class background model. As
background sequences for DREME, Amadeus and Trawler, we use 1, 5 and
10 dinucleotide—shufﬂed copies, respectively, of the foreground sequences.
With WEEDER, we use its pre—computed background model for mouse,
which contains the frequencies of all 8mers in regions 1000 bp upstream of
genes. Exact command lines and more details are given in the Supplementary
Material.

2.2.2 ChIP-seq datasets We use 13 mESC ChIP—seq datasets (Chen
et al., 2008), 3 mouse erythrocyte datasets (Cheng et al., 2009; Kassouf
et al., 2010; Tallack et al., 2010) and 1 human lymphoblastoid cell line
dataset (Ramagopalan et al., 2010). The mESC datasets are for 12 TFs that are
key to the maintenance of pluripotency, plus CTCF. The mouse erythrocyte
datasets are for Gatal, Klfl and Tall, key regulators of erythropoiesis. The
human lymphoblastoid cell line data is for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and
includes separate ChIP—seq data for cells before and after stimulation with
calcitriol. To prepare the datasets for use with motif discovery algorithms, we
map the (centers of the) ChIP—seq peaks declared by the respective authors

to the genome, and extract the 100 bp of genomic sequence centered on each
peak. [The one exception is Gatal, where we used the peaks declared by
Tallack et al. (2010) in the Cheng et al. (2009) data.]

2.2.3 Identifying discovered motifs To determine the success of motif
discovery, we compare the motifs to a database of known TF motifs using
TOMTOM (Gupta et al., 2007). The motif database comprises all vertebrate
motifs in the JASPAR database (Sandelin et al., 2004) (146 motifs) and
all mouse motifs in the UniProbe database (Berger and Bulyk, 2009) (386
motifs). Because the two motif reference datasets lack a motif for the key
pluripotency TF Nanog, we also include an in vitro motif for Nanog taken
from the literature (J auch et al., 2008), for a total of 533 motifs. We only
consider statistically signiﬁcant TOMTOM predictions (E 5 0.05, corrected
for 533 tests).

Because many TFs have very similar DNA—binding afﬁnities, many of the
known motifs in this database are similar to each other, so some discovered
motifs have signiﬁcant matches to multiple motifs in the database. Therefore,
in order to determine to which TF a discovered motif may correspond,
we use prior knowledge from the literature and evidence of increased
expression in the ChIP—ed tissue type. To resolve multiple matches, we
take the most signiﬁcant TOMTOM prediction among matching TFs that
are either upregulated in, or known to be central regulators of, the ChIP—ed
cell type. We consider a TF as upregulated in mouse ES cells if it was so
marked for at least one experiment in cell type EFO_000462 in the Gene
Expression Atlas (Kapushesky et al., 2010) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/). For
motifs discovered in mouse erythrocytes and human lymphoblastoid cell
lines, we restrict matching candidate motifs to TFs previously shown to be
important to transcriptional regulation in those cell types.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Discovering motifs in a single ChIP-seq dataset
using DREME

3.1.] Discovering motifs in mouse ES cell ChIP-seq data
DREME reports between 10 and 33 signiﬁcant motifs (P<0.05)
for each of the mESC datasets (Table 1, column 3), and the number
of signiﬁcant motifs it ﬁnds is highly correlated with the number
of ChIP—seq peaks in the input dataset. It discovers the ChIP—ed
(primary) TF motif in 10 of the 13 mESC ChIP—seq datasets (Table 1,
column 4), and it is the most signiﬁcant motif found by DREME
in those 10 cases. In two of the remaining three cases (Nanog
and E2f1 ChIP—seq datasets), DREME ﬁnds a highly signiﬁcant
motif that is similar to the known motif, but the TOMTOM p—value
does not meet our 0.05 threshold due to the large number of
multiple tests (533 reference motifs). However, the uncorrected p—
values are quite low (Nanog, p=0.0021; E2f1, p=0.0016). Since
DREME reports 24 motifs in the Nanog dataset, we could reject a
slightly different null hypothesis that stated that the known Nanog
motif was not found (Nanog, p=0.05, corrected for 24 tests) and
similarly for E2f1 (E2f1, p=0.04, corrected for 25 tests). In the
ﬁnal case (Smadl ChIP—seq dataset), DREME does not ﬁnd a
motif that matches the only available in vitro Smad—family motif
(UniProbe Smad3_primary), nor the motif reported by Chen et al.
(The complete DREME and TOMTOM output on the mESC datasets
is given in the Supplementary Material.)

In addition to ﬁnding the primary motif, DREME discovers
binding motifs for up to 12 cofactors in each of the mESC ChIP—seq
datasets (Table 1, column 4). Many of the motifs found by DREME
in each mES cell dataset correspond to 1 of 12 key pluripotency TFs
(shown in bold font in Table 1), and these predictions correspond
well to the actual overlap of ChIP—seq peak regions reported by Chen

et al. (2008). For example, in addition to ﬁnding the motif for the
ChIP—ed factor in the chcp2ll dataset, DREME also discovers the
motifs for pluripotency factors STAT3, Klf4, Esrrb, Sox2, Oct4 and
c—Myc/n—Myc (Myc—family motifs are essentially indistinguishable).
In the CTCF dataset, DREME identiﬁes the CTCF motif as well an
unknown motif that was recently found to frequently occur upstream
of the CTCF motif (consensus GCTGCAGT) (Boyle et al., 2010) in
human cells.

Many of the other motifs found by DREME can be assigned to TFs
that are known to be upregulated in mES cells, but whose roles in the
maintenance of pluripotency are unknown (shown in normal font in
Table 1, column 4). Several of these cofactor TF motifs are found
in more than one mESC ChIP—seq dataset. These cofactor motifs
include Spl, CREB/ATF and Zic3, which was recently suggested
as being required for the maintenance of pluripotency (Lim et al.,
2010). On the other hand, we are currently unable to assign many
of the motifs discovered by DREME to any known motif. Although
some of these unassigned motifs may be artifacts, others may simply
correspond to TFs whose motifs are not contained in the two motif
databases we searched.

Several of the motifs discovered by DREME in the mES cell
datasets differ substantially from those reported by Chen et al. in
their original data analysis (Chen et al., 2008). Of particular note,
DREME discovers the monomer motifs for Oct4 and 80x2 in their
respective ChIP—seq datasets, rather than the Oct—Sox heterodimer
motif. The in vivo binding motifs discovered by DREME for Oct4

in the designated TF ChIP—seq dataset (lower logo) aligned with the logo of the best available in vitro motif (upper logo). Since no in vitro motifs are available
for Sox2, Oct4 and E2f1, UniProbe motifs for closely related TF family members Soxll, Pou2f3 and E2f3 are used. The in vitro motif for Nanog is taken

from J auch et al. (2008).

and Sox2 closely match the in vitro motifs derived using protein
binding microarray (PBM) technology (Berger and Bulyk, 2009),
suggesting that the PBM motifs accurately capture DNA binding
of these factors in vivo (Fig. 1a and b). This illustrates a particular
advantage of focusing on short, core motifs and we discuss this issue
in detail below. We also explore the hypothesis (suggested by Chen
et al.) that Oct4 and Sox2 bind DNA exclusively as a homodimer.
(The fact that the most signiﬁcant motif found by DREME in each
of the two ChIP—seq datasets is the primary factor’s suggests this
hypothesis may be false.)

DREME ﬁnds a motif similar to the known E2f1 motif in the E2f1
ChIP—seq dataset. This is in contrast to Chen et al., who report not
ﬁnding a motif for E2f1 using either the WEEDER (Pavesi et al.,
2004) or nestedMICA (Down and Hubbard, 2005) motif discovery
algorithms. A previous study of E2f1 ChIP—chip data also failed
to ﬁnd a convincing E2f1 motif, concluding that E2f1 is mainly
recruited to promoters via a mechanism distinct from recognition
and binding to the consensus site (Bieda et al., 2006). Nonetheless,
in the E2f1 dataset, the second most signiﬁcant motif discovered by
DREME is the word ATGGCG, which occurs in 1274 of the 20 699
ChIP—seq peak regions (E 210—98) and resembles the in vitro motif
for E2f—family member E2f3 (Fig. 1d). The strong enrichment of
this word in the E2f1 ChIP—seq data and its resemblance to the in
vitro E2f3 motif suggests that it may represent at least a subset
of the in vivo binding sites of E2f1 in mES cells. The DREME
motif also is similar to the motif for YYl (JASPAR MA0095.1,
consensus ATGG), suggesting the hypothesis that the sites discovered
by DREME might bind both (but not simultaneously) E2f1 or YYl
in mES cells.

3.1.2 Discovering motifs in mouse erythrocyte ChIP-seq data
When we apply DREME individually to three ChIP—seq datasets
from mouse erythroid cells [TFs Gatal (Cheng et al., 2009),
Klfl (Tallack et al., 2010) and Tall (Kassouf et al., 2010)], the
top motif is the ChIP—ed motif in the ﬁrst two cases, but not in
the last case. With the Gatal dataset, DREME ﬁnds the Gatal
motif (E: 10—892) followed by the motif of SPIl (E: 10—79, a
key myeloid developmental regulator (Zakrzewska et al., 2010). It
also ﬁnds the Klfl motif (E: 10T37) and and E—box motif (E:
10‘”) that might be due to Tall binding. DREME also discovers
the motif for Runxl (E: 10‘2), which may also be involved in
erythropoeisis (Yokomizo et al., 2008). In all, DREME ﬁnds 21
signiﬁcant motifs in the Gatal dataset.

DREME ﬁnds a total of six signiﬁcant motifs in the Klfl
dataset. It identiﬁes the Klfl motif as the most signiﬁcant (E:
10‘”), followed by Gatal (E 2 10‘42). Interestingly, the third most
signiﬁcant motif is the ‘secondary’ Klf motif discovered from in vitro
binding data (Berger and Bulyk, 2009) (E: 10—11).

In the Tall ChIP—seq dataset, the most signiﬁcant motif found by
DREME (among 10 motifs found) is Gatal (E: 10‘262), whereas
the actual Tall binding motif (E—box) is the third most signiﬁcantly
found motif (E: 10‘26). The lower enrichment of the Tall motif
compared with Gatal may be due to the fact that Tall often binds
DNA as a complex with Gata, Lmo2, Ldbl and E47 (Wadman et al.,
1997). In this complex, Tall has reduced contact with the DNA,
binding to a motif consisting of one—half of an E—box followed
~10bp later by a Gatal site (Kassouf et al., 2010). This ‘semi—
direct’ binding would reduce the prevalence of the full Tall motif
in the Tall ChIP—seq dataset. DREME also ﬁnds motifs for Klfl
(E: 10—23) and SPIl (E: 10—16) in this dataset.

3.1.3 Human lymphoblastoid cell line motifs We apply
DREME to two vitamin D receptor (VDR) ChIP—seq datasets
from lymphoblastoid cells before and after stimulation with
calcitriol (Ramagopalan et al., 2010). DREME ﬁnds 19 signiﬁcant
motifs in the unstimulated cell data, and only 11 in the stimulated
cell data (E < 0.05). VDR binds DNA as a heterodimer with retinoid
X receptor (RXR) and the left and right halves of the binding motif
both have the consensus sequence (A/ G) (A/G)G(T/G)TCA.
DREME ﬁnds a single motif matching the consensus in the
ChIP—seq data from the calcitriol—stimulated cells (fourth most
signiﬁcant motif, E=10_11). The top—scoring motif in both
datasets is an ETS—factor motif, possibly due to binding of Ets—l,
which has been shown to cause VDR to function as a constitutive
activator (Tolon et al., 2000). The second most signiﬁcant motif
in the stimulated cell data is an E—box, which has been proposed
as being involved in negative regulation by VDR (Kato et al.,
2007). The third most signiﬁcant motif found in stimulated cell
data strongly resembles STATl, which is known to interact
with VDR (Vidal et al., 2002). The ﬁfth motif found is another
Ets motif, and the sixth motif is a Klf motif. The seventh and
eighth motifs signiﬁcantly resemble Runx2 and Apl/Fos/Jundm2
(TOMTOM E <0.05), respectively, both of which are known
to interact with VDR (Marcellini et al., 2010). In all, six of
the eight most signiﬁcant motifs found in the stimulated cell

data appear to represent the ChIP—ed factor (VDR) or likely
cofactors.

3.2 Discriminative motif discovery

3.2.] Determining if binding is solely via a heterodimer It has
been suggested that Sox2 and Oct4 bind their targets exclusively
as a heterodimer in mES cells (Chen et al., 2008). If this is so, we
should not observe enrichment of either motif when we use the ChIP—
seq datasets for these two TFs as the positive and negative inputs to
DREME. We performed this experiment (using default values for all
DREME parameters), and found that the Oct4 dataset is enriched in
Oct4 binding sites compared with the Sox2 dataset, and vice versa.

Using Oct4 as the positive and Sox2 as the negative input,
DREME discovers the Oct4 motif (Fig. 2a, E: 10‘”), but not
the Sox2 motif (E > 0.05). DREME reports that this motif occurs in
18% of the Oct4 ChIP—seq peaks, but in only 9% of the Sox2 peaks.
The Oct4 motif is thus signiﬁcantly enriched in Oct4 ChiP—seq peaks
compared with Sox2 peaks. Reversing the roles of the two ChIP—seq
datasets, DREME ﬁnds the Sox2 motif (Fig. 2a, E: 10‘158), but
not the Oct4 motif. The Sox2 motif found occurs in 55% of Sox2
peaks, but in only 28% of the Oct4 peaks. These two results strongly
suggest that both Oct4 and Sox2 often bind DNA in mES cells alone
or with other partners, rather than exclusively with each other as a
heterodimer.

3.2.2 Finding context-dependent motifs It was recently reported
that Oct4 may preferentially bind to a different motif with consensus
ATGCGCAT when not binding near Sox2 (Mason et al., 2010). They
used Oct4 and Sox2 ChIP—seq data from Marson et al. (2008) to
create two Oct4 sequence datasets. The ﬁrst dataset, Oct 4woSox2,

contains only Oct4 regions where there is no Sox2 peak within 5000
bp. The second dataset, Oct 4wS OX2, contains Oct4 regions that are
within 50 bp of a Sox2 peak. Using the ﬁrst and second datasets as
positive and negative inputs, respectively, to their discriminative
motif discovery algorithm CMF, they discovered the ATGCGCAT
‘Oct—only’ motif. They also noted that the ChIP—seq peaks containing
this motif are enriched for a different set of transcription factors
(nMyc, cMyc, E2f1 and fo1) than the Oct4 peaks containing a
nearby Sox2 binding site (Nanog, Sox2 and Smadl), suggesting that
the preferred in vivo binding motif of Oct4 is context dependent.

We applied DREME in an analogous way and found that it also
discovers the ‘Oct—only’ motif when applied discriminatively to
the Oct4woSox2 and Oct4wSox2 datasets. On these datasets,
the ‘Oct—only’ motif is the most signiﬁcant one found by DREME
(E = 1e—47), and DREME runs about 5.4 times faster than CMF (74
versus 378 s). Interestingly, the ‘Oct—only’ motif is also among the 17
motifs found by DREME in the Chen et al. Oct4 ChIP—seq dataset,
raising the total number of identiﬁable motifs in that dataset to ﬁve
(Table 1, column 5).

3.2.3 Reﬁning the search for the ChIP-ed factor’s motif
Sometimes the most signiﬁcant motif found by DREME is not that
of the ChIP—ed TF, and it may not even be clear whether its motif
has been found at all. For example, the most signiﬁcant motifs
found by DREME in the Nanog dataset are Oct4 and Sox2. This
suggests that Nanog might sometimes be binding indirectly via one
or both of these TFs. We wondered if a discriminative approach—
looking for motifs enriched in the Nanog dataset relative to the Oct4
or Sox2 dataset—might increase our conﬁdence in the motif we
proposed as the Nanog DNA—binding motif (Fig. 1c). We, therefore,
ran DREME using the Nanog mESC ChIP—seq dataset as the positive
input, and each of the other two TFs’ datasets (individually) as the
negative input. The most signiﬁcant motif in each of these two cases
(Nanog versus Oct4, Nanog versuss Sox2) is indeed highly similar
to the DREME motif we suggest above as the putative Nanog motif
(Fig. 2c), and both are more similar to the previously published
in vitro motif for Nanog [ (C / A) (C / A) ATTA] than the motif found
by DREME in non—discriminative mode. When we use TOMTOM to
compare these two new putative Nanog motifs to our two reference
motif databases plus the TRANSFAC motif database (Matys et al.,
2006), each is most similar to a motif for Pbxl (data not shown). So,
as noted above, determining whether this motif is indeed the binding
motif for Nanog, Pbxl or a combination thereof, may require ChIP—
seq data for Pbxl in mES cells. However, the fact that this is the
most highly enriched motif in the Nanog dataset relative to both the
Oct4 and Sox2 datasets suggests that the motif is not merely due to
the presence of Pbxl binding sites in the Nanog dataset.

3.3 Comparison with other motif discovery algorithms

We compare the speed and accuracy of several popular motif
discovery algorithms with that of DREME using the 13 mESC ChIP—
seq datasets. On this particular task, DREME ﬁnds substantially
more cofactor motifs than the other ﬁve algorithms (Fig. 3a, column
4). Although generally somewhat slower than Amadeus and Trawler,
DREME discovers more than twice as many identiﬁable cofactor
motifs on average compared with Amadeus, and almost 10 times
as many as Trawler. The later two algorithms only ﬁnd 8 of the

13 ChIP—ed motifs, whereas DREME, WEEDER, nestedMICA and
MEME ﬁnd 10 (Fig. 3a, column 3).

WEEDER is much slower than DREME, and its running time
scales non—linearly with dataset size (Fig. 3b), as do MEME and
nestedMICA (data not shown). The full—size datasets contain on
average about 10000 sequences of length 100 bp, and DREME
completes its analysis in 19min on average, whereas WEEDER
requires almost 10 times as long. Both MEME and nestedMICA are
really too slow to handle ChIP—seq datasets containing thousands
of sequences, failing to ﬁnish running after many days. For this
reason, results in Figure 3a for nestedMICA and MEME are for the
reduced—size datasets containing 500 000 bp.

4 DISCUSSION

Focusing on short, core motifs in TF ChIP—seq datasets appears to be
a very proﬁtable approach to understanding patterns of DNA binding
by TFs. Additional insight can also be gained by searching for motifs
that are relatively enriched in one ChIP—seq dataset compared with
another. The ab initio discovered motifs can often be associated
with the probable TF that binds them by comparison to existing
compendia of TF motifs, using expression in the ChIP—ed tissue and
prior knowledge as a ﬁlter. The large numbers of motifs discovered
by DREME that can be reliably assigned to TFs suggests that
unassigned motifs may represent binding by other TFs whose motifs

are not yet known. Of course, because it is only designed to ﬁnd
short, core motifs, DREME is intended only to complement existing
motif ﬁnders (such as those tested here). A complete analysis of a
TF ChIP—seq dataset should also include a search for longer, more
complex motifs.

Our motif discovery algorithm incorporates ideas from several
existing algorithms (Barash et al., 2001; Sharov and Ko, 2009;
Sinha and Tompa, 2003). Barash et al. (2001) uses the Fisher’s
Exact Test to measure the signiﬁcance of enrichment of motifs in
two sets of sequences. Their motifs are not regular expressions
but ‘6—balls’: the set of words that are within a set Hamming
distance from a given word. This motif deﬁnition treats variations
from the consensus word the same, regardless of position within
the motif. Real TF motifs are less tolerant of variation in certain
positions (Matys et al., 2006), and this is better captured by regular
expressions, which explicitly list all the allowed variations (if any)
at each motif position. Several algorithms including YMF (Sinha
and Tompa, 2003) use regular expressions at some stage in the
search for motifs, but differ from our algorithm in other respects.
For example, YMF only allows a subset of the IUPAC wildcards and
scores motifs using a different statistical test (Z —score). Counting the
number of sequences (not occurrences) is equivalent to the ‘Zero or
One Occurrence Per Sequence’ (ZOOPS) model used by numerous
motif discovery algorithms, and ﬁnding multiple motifs by erasing is
reminiscent of MEME (Bailey and Elkan, 1995). CisFinder (Sharov
and Ko, 2009) also uses the idea of counting words and computing
relative enrichment in two sets of sequences, is extremely fast, and
can ﬁnd many cofactor motifs in ChIP—seq datasets. Unlike DREME,
however, it requires a motif clustering step to (partially) remove
redundant motifs, and cannot be restricted to ﬁnding short, core
motifs. Also, in contrast with DREME, CisFinder reports a p—value
for each motif that is not a measure of the signiﬁcance of the motif,
but only of a single word (without wildcards) matching the motif.

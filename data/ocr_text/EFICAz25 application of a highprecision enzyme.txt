ABSTRACT

Summary: High-quality enzyme function annotation is essential for
understanding the biochemistry, metabolism and disease processes
of organisms. Previously, we developed a multi-component high-
precision enzyme function predictor, EFICAz2 (enzyme function infer-
ence by a combined approach). Here, we present an updated
improved version, EFICA22'5, that is trained on a significantly larger
data set of enzyme sequences and PROSITE patterns. We also pre-
sent the results of the application of EFICAzz'5 to the enzyme reanno-
tation of 396 genomes cataloged in the ENSEMBL database.
Availability: The EFICAzz'5 server and database is freely available with
a use-friendly interface at http://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/EFICAz2.5.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding cellular functions such as metabolic pathways
requires the precise assignment of enzymatic functions to pro-
teins in their respective genomes. The ever-increasing accumula-
tion of sequence data that is the result of the genome-sequencing
projects requires rapid computational methods to assign enzyme
functions (Friedberg, 2006). Enzymes are classiﬁed by the
Enzyme Commission (EC) using a hierarchical system of four-
digit codes, such as EC 1.2.3.4, for each type of enzymatic activ-
ity (Webb, 1992). High-precision EC number assignment is of
utmost importance for studies such as metabolic pathway recon-
struction, understanding evolutionary relationships in pathways
(Ginsburg, 2009) and metabolite prediction, etc. (Arakaki et al.,
2008).

Previously, we developed an automatic engine for the prote-
omic scale inference of enzyme function, EFICAz (enzyme func-
tion inference by a combined approach) (Tian et al., 2004).
EFICAz combines the predictions from four independent
methods, namely: (i) CHIEFc family-based Functionally
Discriminating Residue (FDR) identiﬁcation, (ii) multiple
PFAM-based FDR recognition, (iii) CHIEFc SIT evaluation
and (iV) high-speciﬁcity multiple PROSITE patterns. The main
strength of EFICAz is its ability to identify F DRs as residues
that discriminate the members of a homo-functional family (con-
sisting of members with a speciﬁc EC number) from a

hetero-functional family (sequences with another EC number).
Subsequently, we enhanced our approach to EFICAz2 (Arakaki
et al., 2009) with the inclusion of support vector machine (SVM)
models for discrimination between homo-functional and hetero-
functional EC family members. This led to the inclusion of two
additional components: (V) CHIEFc family-based SVM evalu-
ation and (Vi) multiple PFAM family-based SVM evaluation.

Recent years have seen a huge inﬂux of sequence data as a
result of automated genome-sequencing projects and subsequent
assignment of new sequences by the EC. CatFam OK u et al.,
2009), PRIAM (Claudel-Renard et al., 2003) and Enzymedetec-
tor (Quester and Schomburg, 2011) are some of the programs
capable of genome-level enzyme prediction. However, all of them
are sequence similarity-based methods, whereas EFICAz also
uses PROSITE, PFAM, followed by detection of FDRs and is
optimized for high precision. Here, we present the latest imple-
mentation of our enzyme function prediction engine, EFICAzz'S,
using the latest, signiﬁcantly larger, data set of sequences from
SWISSPROT and sequence patterns from PROSITE (Sigrist
et al., 2010). We use enzyme annotations of the SWISSPROT
(O’Donovan et al., 2002) component of UNIPROT sequences
(Magrane and Consortium, 2011) for training EFICAz2'5. Sub-
sequently, we applied EFICAzz'5 to annotate 396 fully sequenced
genomes in the ENSEMBL (F licek et al., 2011) database belong-
ing to bacteria, fungi, protists, metazoans, plants and vertebrates.
The results are cataloged and are available at http://cssb.biology
.gatech.edu/enzymes.

2 METHODS

Annotations in the public databases can be error prone, especially those
that include automated annotations. Accordingly, we used sequences in
the ENZYME data set of SWISSPROT (O’Donovan et al., 2002) release
2011_01 (January 2011) that are manually curated, and thus, it is reason-
able to use their EC—recommended EC numbers for training. This release
consisted of 220 485 sequences belonging to 2757 four-digit EC (4EC)
families and 211 three-digit EC (3EC) families. Sequences were divided
into enzyme and non-enzyme sets. The enzyme set was classiﬁed into EC
families at the 3EC and 4EC digit levels. To train EFICAZZ'S, we followed
the protocol described in detail by Tian et al., 2004 and Arakaki et al.,
2009. CHIEFc families were constructed using an iterative procedure,
which aims to divide the sequences in each EC group into evolutionarily
related families based on the conservation of functionally discriminating
residues. The PFAM database (Punta et al., 2012) release 23 was used for
training the components ‘Multiple PFAM based FDR recognition’ and
‘multiple PFAM based SVM evaluation’. We used release 20.68 (January
2011) of the PROSITE database (Sigrist et al., 2010) for training the
‘High speciﬁcity multiple PROSITE pattern’, which detects sequence

patterns in the enzyme subset of sequences. All components are trained
separately for sequences annotated up to 3EC and 4EC numbers. The
classiﬁcation tree as reported in Arakaki et al., 2009 is implemented to
integrate predictions generated by each of six components into a ﬁnal EC
number prediction.

For annotation and reannotation of genomes for enzyme functions,
genomic sequences were downloaded from the ftp site of the ENSEMBL
genomes database (release 13) for 249 bacterial, 26 fungi, 15 protists, 16
plants and 35 metazoans. An additional 55 vertebrate species genomes
were downloaded from ENSEMBL release 67. All alternate spliced ver-
sions for a gene were considered in the detection of enzyme function.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

EFICAzz'5 is the latest implementation of the high-precision
enzyme function prediction method EFICAz that was trained
with the latest data sets for the SWISSPROT, PFAM and
PROSITE. We implemented changes in the software code that
make it easier for a user to upgrade by requiring only the re-
placement of the directory containing the library ﬁles. EFICAzz'5
takes about 4 min for a typical 200-residue protein compared
with 6 min by EFICAzz. The results on the web interface are
more informative and include the EC name, EC number and
relevant links to the EC, BRENDA and KEGG resources. The
results of user queries performed using SWISSPROT ID are
stored at the backend, and subsequent queries for the same ID
immediately retrieve the results. This version uses a total number
of 220 485 sequences whose EC numbers are provided by the
ENZYME data set of curated SWISSPROT sequences as com-
pared with only 136 167 sequences available in 2008 when the
previous version, EFICAz2, was built. In terms of the diversity of
enzymatic functions, the current release contains a total of 2757
4EC numbers compared with 2354 in the previous version. The
diversity of functions is seen only at the 4EC level, as the number
of 3EC digit functions only increases from 209 to 211.
Benchmarking results when 80% of the sequences from every
EC function were used for training while testing on the remain-
ing 20% of sequences (only families with >5 sequences were
used) shows a similar trend of high precision and recall values
as a function of the maximum test to training sequence identity
(MTTSI). At a sequence similarity of >40% for 3 EC level, recall
and precision values were 0.88 and 0.85, respectively, and
reached almost 1.0 at a MTTSI of >60%. Even at a MTTSI
of 20%, the precision and recall were 0.8 and 0.6, respectively,
at the 4EC level. However, both drop rapidly as the MTTSI
became <20% (see Supplementary Fig. S1). This is not surpris-
ing, as this lies well within the twilight zone for function predic-
tion. Supplementary Figure S2 shows a comparison of
EFICAzz'5 and EFICAz2 for all sequences in the latest release
in SWISSPROT.

In another comparison analysis, we compared the EC anno-
tations made by EFICAz2 and EFICAzz'5 for the human prote-
ome. The latest release of the human proteome consists of 2856
sequences annotated with EC numbers in ENZYME database.
EFICAzz'5 could predict all four digits of 2642 sequences cor-
rectly compared with 2288 sequences by EFICAz2. In addition,
EFICAzz'5 predicted 30 sequences at a low conﬁdence level. At

the 3EC level, EFICAzz'5 predicted 2758 sequences correctly as
compared with 2,413 by EFICAzzThis shows that EFICAzz'S
has better prediction ability compared with its predecessor. In
addition, EFICAzz'5 predicts EC numbers for a total of 8886 of
50 475 sequences in the translated TrEMBL component of the
human proteome.

Advancements in sequencing technologies have resulted in the
full genome sequencing of a variety of organisms. After sequen-
cing, the next obvious step is the annotation of the functions of
genes. Among various roles played by proteins, enzymatic func-
tion is the most important from the biochemical point of View.
We took this opportunity to reannotate 4 044 586 sequences
from a total of 396 genomes from the ENSEMBL database
using EFICAzz'S. The results will be updated with each release
of ENSEMBL and ENSEMBL genomes.

Prediction results are obtained at two levels: Viz. ‘high conﬁ-
dence’ and ‘all prediction’ (Tian et al., 2004). Supplementary
Table S1 shows a summary of predictions at the 3EC and 4EC
digit levels for various groups of organisms. In any case, extant
accurate enzyme annotations represent the lower bound of en-
zymatic functions for an organism. This data can be used by the
biochemist and computational biologist alike. We believe
EFICAz2'5 will be a useful tool for the scientiﬁc community.

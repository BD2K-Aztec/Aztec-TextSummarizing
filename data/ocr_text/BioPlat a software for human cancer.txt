ABSTRACT

Summary: Development of effective tools such as oligo-microarrays
and next-generation sequencing methods for monitoring gene expres-
sion on a large scale has resulted in the discovery of gene signatures
with prognostic/predictive value in various malignant neoplastic dis-
eases. However, with the exponential growth of gene expression data-
bases, biologists are faced with the challenge of extracting useful
information from these repositories. Here, we present a software pack-
age, BioPlat (Biomarkers Platform), which allows biologists to identify
novel prognostic and predictive cancer biomarkers based on the data
mining of gene expression signatures and gene expression profiling
databases. BioPlat has been designed as an easy-to-use and flexible
desktop software application, which provides a set of analytical tools
related to data extraction, preprocessing, filtering, gene expression
signature calculation, in silico validation, feature selection and anno-
tation that leverage the integration and reuse of gene expression sig-
natures in the context of follow-up data.

Availability and implementation: BioPlat is a platform-independent
software implemented in Java and supported on GNU/Linux and MS
Windows, which is freely available for download at http://www.can
cergenomics.net.

1 INTRODUCTION

Human cancer transcriptomes have been extensively proﬁled
over the past decade, allowing the identiﬁcation of different
cancer molecular subtypes and the development of prognostic
and predictive gene expression signatures. Gene expression sig-
natures have been curated from the literature and collected into
publicly available databases such as MSigDB 3.0 and
GeneSigDB 4.0, with >10 000 gene signatures related to human
diseases (Culhane et al., 2012; Liberzon et al., 2011). On the
other hand, databases such as GEO (Gene Expression
Omnibus) and AE (ArrayExpress) are the primary repositories
for the raw data from functional genomic studies (Barrett et al.,
2013; Rustici et al., 2013). A central focus on translational cancer
research is that patient diagnosis and prognosis can be improved
by stratiﬁcation of patients based on functional genomics data

beside relevant follow-up data. Therefore, we developed BioPlat
(Biomarkers Platform), a user-friendly bioinformatics resource,
which provides a set of analytical tools for the in silico identiﬁ-
cation of novel prognostic and predictive cancer biomarkers. It
encompasses all the stages of data mining and analysis of the vast
number of gene expression signatures and proﬁling data, includ-
ing data extraction, preprocessing, ﬁltering, in silico validation
and feature selection.

Currently, there exists a myriad of applications and software
focused on the integration and analysis of oncogenomics and
clinicopathological data (e. g. Oncomine, ITTACA, PAPAyA,
IntOGene, Cancer Genomics Browser, MeV, GenePattern).
However, the salient feature that makes BioPlat unique is that
it allows the direct and easy integration of gene expression sig-
natures and gene expression proﬁling data to further perform
survival analysis. Moreover, BioPlat implements features that
are not included in other biomarker discovery tools. These fea-
tures include statistic methods to measure the performance of
prediction models and also algorithms to perform feature selec-
tion. Although several of these statistical tests and algorithms are
mostly available in R packages, our software provides a uniﬁed
framework that facilitates the use of these components.

2 METHODS

2.1 System implementation

BioPlat is a desktop client application implemented in Java and based on
Rich Client Platform and Standard Widget Toolkit. It uses object-
oriented programming, a local H2 in-memory database and Hibernate
to perform the object-relational mapping. The Java-embedded database
contains all the required annotation data for mapping probes and gene
identiﬁers (Entrez ID and Ensembl ID) to gene symbols and related in-
formation. Statistical and data mining analyses are performed with the R
statistical package and Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004). Brieﬂy, we
use several R/Bioconductor packages (e.g. frma, inSilicon, fpc, affy,
genefu, limma, survival, survcomp) and functions (6. g. dist, hclust,
cutree) for data retrieval, preprocessing, management and analysis. The
integration between Java and R was achieved using an R bridge de-
veloped by us (named R4J) based on Rserve. BioPlat was designed
using extension points for allowing users with programming knowledge
to incorporate new behavior and algorithms easily.

2.2 Features and algorithms implementation

BioPlat consists of an integrated set of tools that allow the access and
analysis of data deposited in gene expression signatures and gene expres-
sion proﬁling repositories (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data Sl). Gene
expression signatures can be queried and ﬁltered by tumor localization,

Fig. 1. Diagrammatic workﬂow of BioPlat. The ﬁrst two steps in BioPlat
are the gene signature creation and the import of experiments containing
follow-up and gene expression proﬁling data. BioPlat provides several
processes for the gene list generation such as access and data mining of
gene signature databases. Gene expression data, provided by experiments
incorporated in the platform, are used to cluster the samples of the ex-
periments based on K-means method. This clustering will let the platform
validate the statistical signiﬁcance level of the biomarker using the follow-
up data of the same experiment in terms of C-index, Log-rank test and
Kaplan—Meier survival analysis

tissue types or signature identiﬁers directly from the two main curated
repositories: MSigDB (Liberzon et al., 2011) and GeneSigDB (Culhane
et al., 2012). BioPlat allows the creation/edition of gene lists by using any
of the identiﬁers included in the embedded database (e.g. Gene name,
Entrez, Ensembl and Probe IDs). In addition, BioPlat integrates infor-
mation and tools provided by other well-known online resources such as
DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated
Discovery), STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting
Genes/Proteins), Enrichr, Expression Atlas, RNA-seq Atlas, Gene
Cards and others.

Gene expression proﬁles (BioPlat experiments) are used for the valid-
ation and optimization steps of gene signatures previously deﬁned. A
BioPlat experiment contains follow-up data and gene expression proﬁles
of samples. BioPlat experiments can be programmatically queried and
imported from InSilico database (Taminau et al., 2011), local GEO-
formatted ﬁles or preprocessing Affymetrix CEL ﬁles with RMA/
fRMA (frozen robust multiarray analysis) algorithms. Although the
platform is prepared for incorporating experiment mining processes as
a new way to propose candidate gene lists, the main use of the experi-
ments in BioPlat is to estimate the prognostic/predictive value of a gene
expression signature. In the validation process, given a pair of gene sig-
nature experiments, the results shown are the annotated data matrix with
the patient’s cluster, the concordance index (C-index), the Log-Rank test
P—value and the Kaplan—Meier curves.

Because of the large number of features usually present in the gene
expression signature analyzed, signature optimization is a key step that
was considered in the development of the software. We focus on selecting
compact feature subsets while maximizing prediction accuracy for
biomarker discovery to reduce complexity. BioPlat provides two opti-
mization processes—‘blind search’ and particle swarm optimization
(PSO)—to search a better candidate gene signature in the solution
space of the signature to be optimized. The implementation of the PS0
algorithm in BioPlat was based on the PS0 binary version previously
described (Kennedy and Eberhart, 1997). Brieﬂy, PS0 is a machine
learning metaheuristic whose aim is to reduce the solution space

for ﬁnding the optimum gene signature without going over the
whole space based on a metric of quality associated with the outcome
(e.g. C-index). Considering that the metric of performance is a critical
point for the algorithms and that new metrics are being worked on, the
comparison strategy was designed in the platform to be easily replaced
without affecting the core of the algorithm. Moreover, to avoid the
overﬁtting of the found solution on the training experiment used
for running the heuristic logics, any optimizer allows conﬁguring
not only a training experiment but also a testing experiment and a val-
idation one.

3 USAGE EXAMPLE

We wanted to provide a systematic analysis of breast cancer gene
expression signatures, in an effort to identify breast cancer bio-
markers with prognostic value. The integration of 655 breast
cancer signatures obtained from MSig and GeneSig databases,
using the Metasignature wizard, revealed a set of 140 genes that
were the most commonly deregulated transcripts among breast
cancer studies (Supplementary Data S2A). K—means clustering of
the metasignature in three independent publicly available data-
sets (GSE25066 n: 508, NKI dataset n=295 and a compiled
dataset of 737 carcinomas derived from GSE2034, GSE3494 and
GSE11121) identiﬁed two main clusters of breast carcinomas
that differed in their relapse-free survival (Supplementary Data
S2B).

Feature selection analysis of the 140 gene metasignature in the
GSE25066 study (training dataset) using PSO-based process
allows reducing the candidate gene signature to 60 genes
(Supplementary Data S2C and S3) with improved prognostic
performances as reﬂected by having the highest C-index and
the lowest nominal log-rank P—values for relapse-free survival.
Interestingly, cluster 1 was highly associated with luminal A/B
breast cancer intrinsic subtypes, whereas cluster 2 was associated
with basal-like breast carcinomas. Gene enrichment analysis re-
vealed two functional modules signiﬁcantly affected: one related
with the response to steroid hormone (upmodulated in cluster 1)
and another related with the cell cycle signaling pathway (upmo-
dulated in cluster 2) (Supplementary Data S2A—E). Finally, we
compared the prognostic performance of the 60-gene signature
with the PAM50 and genomic grade Index signatures on the
GSE25066 dataset. This analysis demonstrated that the 60-gene
signature outperformed the genomic grade Index, having similar
prognostic value that the PAM50 signature in predicting the re-
lapse-free survival of patients with early-stage breast cancers
(Supplementary Data S4).

4 CONCLUSION

BioPlat facilitates the integration, analysis, validation and fea-
ture selection of gene signatures derived from different databases
in the context of follow-up data obtained from publicly available
gene expression proﬁling repositories.

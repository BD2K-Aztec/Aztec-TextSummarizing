ABSTRACT

Motivation: Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is one of the most
widely used methods to measure gene expression. Despite extensive
research in qPCR laboratory protocols, normalization and statistical
analysis, little attention has been given to qPCR non-detects—those
reactions failing to produce a minimum amount of signal.

Results: We show that the common methods of handling qPCR non-
detects lead to biased inference. Furthermore, we show that non-
detects do not represent data missing completely at random and
likely represent missing data occurring not at random. We propose
a model of the missing data mechanism and develop a method to
directly model non-detects as missing data. Finally, we show that
our approach results in a sizeable reduction in bias when estimating
both absolute and differential gene expression.

Availability and implementation: The proposed algorithm is imple-
mented in the R package, nondetects. This package also contains
the raw data for the three example datasets used in this manuscript.
The package is freely available at http://mnmccall.com/software and

1 INTRODUCTION

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (Bustin, 2000; Gibson et al.,
1996; Higuchi et al., 1992; Wittwer et al., 1997) remains the gold
standard for measuring gene expression due to a combination of
greater sensitivity and lower cost than gene expression micro-
arrays or RNA-sequencing. It is commonly used to validate
results from high-throughput studies and to develop clinical bio-
markers. Recently, qPCR-based technologies have been de-
veloped to simultaneously measure thousands of transcripts,
e.g. the TaqMan OpenArray Real-Time PCR Plates contain
3072 wells. These plates have been used, for example, to simul-
taneously measure the expression of all microRNAs in a sample.

The increased use of qPCR (Ginzinger, 2002) has prompted
research examining qPCR laboratory protocols (Bustin, 2002;
Bustin and Nolan, 2004; Nolan et al., 2006) and more recently
normalization (Mar et al., 2009; Mestdagh et al., 2009; Qureshi
and Sacan, 2013) and statistical analysis strategies (Karlen et al.,
2007; Schmittgen and Livak, 2008; Yuan et al., 2006). In 2009,
the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-
Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines were published.
These guidelines are designed to ‘encourage better experimental

practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation
of qPCR results’ (Bustin et al., 2009).

Brieﬂy, qPCR is used to measure the expression of a set of
target genes in a given sample through repeated cycles of se-
quence-speciﬁc DNA ampliﬁcation followed by expression meas-
urements. Between subsequent cycles, the amount of each target
transcript approximately doubles during the exponential phase
of ampliﬁcation. The cycle at which the observed expression ﬁrst
exceeds a ﬁxed threshold is commonly called the threshold cycle
(Ct) or quantiﬁcation cycle (Cq). The latter is the MIQE—
preferred nomenclature but is not currently widely used. These
Ct values represent a quantitative assessment of gene expression
and are often treated as the raw data for subsequent analyses.

However, relatively little attention has been given to handling
non-detects—those reactions failing to attain the prespeciﬁed
minimum signal intensity. Currently, there is no consensus
manner in which to handle these non-detects in subsequent ana-
lyses. The default in the Applied Biosystems DataAssist v3.0
software is to set non-detects equal to the number of PCR
cycles performed (typically 40). One has the option of setting a
lower Maximum Allowable Ct Value to which any greater value is
set or excluding these values from subsequent calculations (Life
Technologies, 2011). Integromics RealTime StatMiner distin-
guishes between two types of non-detects—undetermined values
are those that do not exceed the Ct threshold and absent values
are those for which no reaction occurred. RealTime StatMinder
handles non-detects by setting undetermined values to a max-
imum Ct (e.g. 40) and absent values to the median of the detected
replicates (Goni et al., 2009). Researchers have also developed
their own methods to handle non-detects that combine ﬁltering
and thresholding, for example, summarizing replicates with a
value of 40 when the majority are non-detects and with an aver-
age of the detected Ct values otherwise (Mar et al., 2009).

2 APPROACH

We begin by showing that the common practice of setting non-
detect values equal to 40 introduces substantial bias in normal-
ized gene expression, ACt, and differential expression, AACt,
estimates (Pfafﬂ, 2001). Next, we provide evidence that non-
detects are not missing completely at random and are likely
missing not at random; therefore, ﬁltering these data will also
introduce bias in subsequent analyses (for an introduction to
missing data terminology, see Gelman and Hill, 2007, Chap.
25). To address non-detects, we propose a method to model
the missing data mechanism that can be used to impute Ct
values for the non-detects or to directly estimate the quantities

non-detect observed non-detect

Fig. 1. Within replicate residuals stratiﬁed by the presence of non-detects. The average AACt (A) or ACt (B and C) values were calculated within each set
of replicates (same gene and sample type). The residuals, for each gene and sample from this summarization are plotted here, stratiﬁed by the presence of
non-detects. In dataset 1, a non-detect could occur in the perturbation sample, the control sample or both samples. The left-most box in Panel A shows
the distribution of residuals in dataset 1 when there are no non-detects. The other boxes in Panel A (from left to right) show the distribution of residuals
when there are non-detects in the perturbation sample, the control sample and both samples. Similarly, the left box in Panels B and C shows the
distribution of residuals when there are no non-detects. The right box in Panels B and C shows the distribution of residuals when there is a non-detect.
Although one would expect some difference in the distribution of residuals between the detects and non-detects, the differences seen here are much larger
than one would expect and likely represent bias introduced by setting non-detects equal to 40

of interest. Finally, we show that the proposed approach greatly
reduces the bias introduced by non-detects in qPCR data ana-
lysis. Three published qPCR datasets (described in the Methods
Section) are used throughout the manuscript to motivate and
illustrate the results.

3 METHODS

3.1 Three example datasets

The ﬁrst dataset consists of nine gene perturbations with matched control
samples (Almudevar et al., 2011); the second dataset is composed of two
cell types and three treatments (Sampson et al., 2013); the third dataset is
a study of the effect of p53 and/or Ras mutations on gene expression
(McMurray et al., 2008).

In the ﬁrst dataset, cells transformed to malignancy by mutant p53 and
activated Ras are perturbed with the aim of restoring gene expression to
levels found in non-transformed parental cells via retrovirus-mediated re-
expression of corresponding cDNAs or shRNA—dependent stable knock-
down. The data contain four to six replicates for each perturbation, and
each perturbation has a corresponding control sample in which only the
vector has been added (Almudevar et al., 2011).

The second dataset consists of two cell types—young adult mouse
colon (YAMC) cells and mutant-p53/activated-Ras transformed
YAMC cells—in combination with three treatments—untreated,
sodium butyrate or valproic acid. Four replicates were performed for
each cell-type/treatment combination (Sampson et al., 2013).

The third dataset is a comparison between four cell types—YAMC
cells, mutant-p53 YAMC cells, activated-Ras YAMC cells and p53/Ras
double mutant YAMC cells. Three replicates were performed for the
untransformed YAMC cells, and four replicates were performed for
each of the other cell types (McMurray et al., 2008).

As in the original publications, all three datasets were normalized to a
reference gene, Becnl, with the resulting values denoted as ACt. In the
ﬁrst dataset, AACt values were computed by comparing each perturbed
sample to its corresponding control sample. Additional details regarding
each of these datasets can be found in the original publications.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Setting non-detects equal to 40 introduces bias

We begin by examining the common practice of replacing non-
detects with a Ct value of 40. Replicates were summarized
by calculating the average ACt (datasets 2 and 3) or AACt
(dataset 1) values for each unique gene/sample—type combin-
ation. The residuals from this summarization for gene 1',
sample-type j and sample k were calculated as follows:

1 K
Dataset 1 : rl-J-k = AACtl-J-k — E ZAACtiJ-k
k=1

1 K
Datasets 2 and 3 : rijk = ACtij-k — E ZACtiJ-k
k = 1

The distribution of these residuals differs substantially between
those in which the ACt or AACt value contains a non-detect and
those in which these values were observed (Fig. 1). Note that
when calculating ACt values, the reference gene, Becnl, is
always detected, so non-detects can only occur in the target
gene; therefore, datasets 2 and 3 are each split into two groups
based on whether both Ct values were observed or a non-detect
was present in the target gene. A non-detect typically results in
lower absolute expression estimates (Fig. 1B and C). When
calculating AACt values, a non-detect can occur in the perturbed
and/ or control sample. In general, a non-detect in the perturbed
sample results in lower relative expression, and a non-detect
ina the control sample results in higher relative expression
(Fig. 1A). Non-detects in both samples yield AACt values
close to zero—these values simply represent differences in
Becnl expression between the perturbed and control samples.
While one might expect some difference in the distribution of
residuals between the observed values and those containing a
non-detect, the large differences seen in Figure I likely

of Sema7a to the perturbation of nine genes from dataset 1. Panel 03) shows the expression of Gpr149 in each combination of normal/tumor samples and
one of three treatments from dataset 2. Panel (C) shows the response of Pdlim2 to p53 and/or Ras mutation from dataset 3. ACt and AACt values
produced by replacing a non-detect with a value of 40 are shown as asterisks. Note that in panel A, a non-detect could have also occurred in one of the
control samples; however, in these data this did not occur for Sema7a—all of the non-detects happened to occur in the perturbed samples

represent bias introduced by the common method of handling
non-detects.

To further illustrate the bias introduced by replacing non-
detects with a value of 40, the ACt and AACt values for one
example gene from each dataset are shown in Figure 2. These
examples were chosen to demonstrate situations in which repla-
cing non-detects with a value of 40 may lead to spurious differ-
ential expression.

In Figure 2A, the response of Sema7a to perturbation of each
of nine genes is shown. Looking at only the AACt values for
which there were no non-detects, the expression of Sema7a
does not appear to be greatly affected by any of the perturb-
ations, except perhaps Hoxcl3. However, there do appear to be a
relatively large number of outliers. Focusing on Sema7a’s re-
sponse to perturbation of Hoxcl3, half of the AACt values con-
tained a non-detect in the perturbed sample. If one replaced these
non-detects with a value of 40, the resulting AACt values would
be approximately 3.23 and 5.05, while the AACt values without
non-detects were approximately 0.16 and 1.54. This would pro-
duce an average AACt value of 2.5. This is probably a substantial
overestimate of the down-regulation of Sema7a induced by
perturbation of Hoxcl3, resulting from the common method of
handling non-detects.

Figure 2B shows the expression of Gpr149 in six conditions.
Among the normal samples, there does not appear to be a dif-
ference in expression between the untreated (UT), sodium butyr-
ate (NB) and valproic acid (VA) samples when looking at only
the ACt values without non-detects. However, there are three
non-detects in the NB samples and one in the VA sample.
Replacing these non-detects with a value of 40 would lead to a
large (and likely spurious) difference in expression between these
treatments.

Finally, Figure 2C shows the response of Pdlim2 to mutation
of p53 and/ or Ras. While there are non-detects in each group, the
number of non-detects varies from 3/3 in the normal samples to
1/4 in the Ras and p53/Ras samples. Replacing these non-detects
with a value of 40 will produce a sizeable difference in average

expression between the normal and p53 samples and the Ras and
p53/Ras samples.

4.2 Filtering non-detect Ct values also introduces bias

Whether one can ﬁlter missing values from one’s data without
biasing one’s results depends on the type of missing data. Data
are said to be missing completely at random if the probability of a
missing value is the same for all data points. For qPCR data this
implies that the probability of a non-detect is the same for every
data point regardless of gene, sample-type, sample-replicate, etc.
A broader class of missing data is missing at random in which the
probability of a missing value depends only on the available in-
formation. F or qPCR data this would imply that the probability
of a non-detect is the same for each replicate within a given gene/
sample-type combination. Finally, the data are called missing not
at random when the probability of a missing value depends on
either unobserved predictors or the missing value itself. A well-
studied example of the latter is censoring. For data missing not at
random, ﬁltering the missing values produces bias in one’s
inferences.

If the non-detects are missing completely at random, then the
proportion of non-detects should be roughly constant across
genes. For each gene, we compute the proportion of non-detects
and the average Ct value across replicate samples (Fig. 3). There
appears to be a strong relationship between the average expres-
sion of the genes across replicate samples and the proportion of
non-detects. In other words, it seems that genes with lower aver-
age expression are far more likely to be non-detects. From this
we can conclude that the non-detects do not occur completely at
random.

While it is relatively easy to distinguish between missing com-
pletely at random and missing at random, it is generally not
possible to distinguish between missing at random and missing
not at random from the observed data. However, in the case of
qPCR non-detects, we are able to use two pieces of additional
information to suggest that non-detects are likely missing not at
random.

Logistic regression ﬁts (dashed lines) all show a strong relationship between the proportion of non-detects and the median observed gene expression—

P—values of (A) 2.57 x 10-6, (B) 1.58 x 10-12, (C) <2 x 10-16

First, the PCR reactions are run for a ﬁxed number of cycles
(typically 40), implying that the observed data are censored at the
maximum cycle number. This is a type of non-random missing-
ness in which the missing data mechanism depends on the unob-
served value. Knowledge of the technology allows us to conclude
that the data are at least subject to ﬁxed censoring; however, as
we will later show, the qPCR censoring mechanism may actually
be a probabilistic function of the unobserved data.

Second, the experimental design of the ﬁrst dataset, in which
there are a large number of control samples, allows one to esti-
mate an additional piece of information that is not typically
available—the proportion of non-detects as a function of the
average sample expression across a large number of replicates
(Fig. 4). Here, we see a similar relationship between average
expression and proportion of non-detects. It appears that sam-
ples with overall lower signal, as a result of technical not biolo-
gical variability, also result in a greater number of non-detects.
Because most qPCR experiments are not designed to allow one
to estimate the relationship between overall sample signal and
the proportion of non-detects, qPCR data typically exhibit a type
of non-random missingness in which the missing data mechanism
depends on an unobserved variable.

This suggests that qPCR non-detects are probably not missing
at random; therefore, ﬁltering non-detects will introduce bias in
one’s inference. The only principled approach is to attempt to
model the missing data mechanism and incorporate this into
one’s analysis.

4.3 The missing data mechanism

Before proposing a missing data mechanism for qPCR non-
detects, it is important to ﬁrst determine what a non-detect rep-
resents. There are several possibilities:

(1) Truncation of a continuous expression distribution—a
non-detect represents a true Ct value >40. This implies
that if the PCR were run for more cycles, one would even-
tually see an ampliﬁcation above the Ct threshold. This
would mean that the Ct values are a type of censored data.

(2) A completely unexpressed transcript—no matter how long
the PCR was run, one would never see ampliﬁcation above
the Ct threshold.

(3) A failure to detect a true Ct value <40—the Ct value
should be <40, but in the given experiment the transcript
failed to amplify or its ampliﬁcation efﬁciency was poor.

We begin by evaluating the ﬁrst potential explanation for non-
detects by examining the distribution of Ct values including non-
detects coded as 40 (Fig. 5). The number of non-detects in these
datasets far exceeds what one would expect based on ﬁtting a
normal distribution to the detected Ct values. Approximately
1.2, 1.8 and 2.8% of the measurements are non-detects in data-
sets 1, 2 and 3, respectively, where one would expect 0.02, 0.03
and <0.01%. This argues against non-detects being explained
completely by a truncation of the Ct value distribution, unless
the distribution has an extremely long upper tail.

Fig. 5. The distribution of Ct values in each of the three datasets. Here, non-detects are coded as 40

Furthermore, if the non-detects represented censoring of
values >40, one would expect a reduction in bias by replacing
the non-detects with a value 240. However, in general, bias is
reduced by replacing non-detects with a value of 35 rather than
40 (Fig. 6). This suggests that many non-detects are due to a
failure to amplify rather than a true Ct value >40.

Next, we evaluate the second potential explanation for non-
detects—that a non-detect represents a completely unexpressed
transcript. As previously mentioned, Figure 4 shows a strong
relationship between low overall signal in a sample and a greater
proportion of non-detects. Although some non-detects may rep-
resent a completely unexpressed gene, this cannot be the only
explanation, given that samples with low signal (due to technical
not biological differences) typically have a greater proportion of
non-detects.

Finally, examination of Figure 5 shows a relatively low number
of Ct values between 35 and 40. Together with Figure 6, in which
replacing non-detects with a value of 35 rather than 40 reduced
the bias in ACt and AACt values, this suggests that some non-
detects represent a failure to detect a true Ct value <40.

4.4 A potential generative model

One model to explain the observed behavior of non-detects in the
Ct data is the following:

13.:
non - detect if Zl‘j = 0

where

gYi') iin'<Si'
Pr(Z,-,-=1)=[ ( J J J

0 otherwise

Here, Yij is the observed Ct value of gene i for sample j, 9,-1- is the
true expression of gene i for sample j, f(9,-J-) represents the non-
biological effects present in the observed data and 19,-]- captures the
technical and biological variability in the data. Zij is a binary
variable representing whether a Ct value was obtained for gene i
and sample j that takes on a value of 1 with probability g( Yij) for
values of Yij less than some threshold Sij. Here, Si]- represents the
upper Ct value detection limit for gene i and sample j.

In this framework, one can represent the standard assump-
tions regarding non-detects as: (i) Sij =40 V(i, j), where 40 is the
total number of PCR cycles performed and (ii) g( Yij) = 1 mean-
ing that Ct values <40 are never reported as non-detects.
However, the results shown above suggest that these assump-
tions are probably not valid. Speciﬁcally, Sij may be <40 for
some genes and/or g( Yij) may be <1.

Furthermore, this model captures several important aspects of
qPCR non-detects. The relationship between technical variability
in expression and the proportion of non-detects is formalized in
the dependence of Zij on Yij rather than 9,]. The gap in observed
Ct values between 35 and 40, i.e. the potential for Ct values <40
to be non-detects, is captured by g( Yij) <1 and/or Sly-<40.

4.5 An EM algorithm to handle non-detects

Having established that non-detects in qPCR data represent data
missing not at random, we now propose a method that incorp-
orates the missing data mechanism into subsequent statistical
analyses. The expectation—maximization (EM) algorithm pro-
vides a method to obtain maximum likelihood estimates in the
presence of missing data by iteratively calculating the conditional
expectation:

Q(¢|¢n) =E [171 f(X|¢) IY, 45”]

and maximizing Q(¢|¢n) with respect to q). Here, X is the com-
plete unobserved data and Yis the incomplete observed data, q) is
the set of all parameters, lnf(X|¢) is the complete data log-
likelihood, and q)” is the estimate of g) at iteration n. This process
is repeated until convergence (Dempster et al., 1977).

The challenging aspect of applying the EM algorithm to qPCR
non-detects is calculating the conditional expectation. This re-
quires one to estimate the distribution of gene expression given
a non-detect. Here, we proceed via Bayes rule:

Pr(Zij=0| Yij) *f(Yij)
 = 

 

f(YijIZij=0)=

We can estimate Pr(Z,-J-=0| Ylj) by examining the relationship
between the proportion of non-detects and average observed ex-
pression within replicates. This approach permits ﬂexible model-

Fig. 6. Same as Figure 1, with additional boxplots showing the residuals when non-detects are replaced with 35 rather than 40. Here, Ct values >35 are
also replaced by a value of 35. By replacing non-detects with a value of 35 rather than 40, the distribution of the residuals is far more similar between
those in which the Ct values were observed and those containing a non-detect. However, this does not imply that one should replace non-detects with
a value of 35. Such an approach makes very strong assumptions about the missing data mechanism and would require one to discard observed Ct

interest or to obtain estimates of the missing data that can be
used to impute the non-detect values.

To demonstrate the reduction in bias that one can achieve by
treating non-detects as missing data, we propose the following
model of the observed expression for gene i, sample-type j and
replicate k, Yijk:

ifZ,-J- =0

9,]- + 8k 1‘ Eljk
iJ'k 2
non - detect

where 8k represents a global shift in expression across samples
and,

g( Yijk) if Yijk < 40

P’”(Zi'k = 1) =
J I 0 otherwise

Here, g( Yijk) can be estimated via the following logistic regression:
Iogit(Pr<ZiJ-k = 1» = 180 + My

where 0,-1- is an estimate of the average expression for gene i and
sample-type j. For the data presented here, 8k can be estimated
using the reference gene, Becnl.

4.6 Treating non-detects as missing data reduces bias

We begin by examining the effect of replacing non-detects with
an imputed Ct value based on the conditional expectation calcu-
lated in the EM algorithm. Looking at the residuals within rep-
licates in each dataset, it is clear that replacing non-detects with
these imputed values results in far less bias in the ACt and AACt
values than if we replaced the non-detects with a value of 40
(Fig. 7).

The improvement in bias after imputing the non-detects can
also be seen in the example genes shown in Figure 2. After
replacing the non-detects with values imputed using the EM
algorithm, the non-detect ACt and AACt values are far more
similar to their replicate values, while retaining small differences
due to the informative missingness (Fig. 8). Figure 8C shows
one important limitation of the current implementation.
Because the ACt values from the three normal samples all con-
tained non-detects, their imputed values are fairly similar to the
initial values based on replacing the non-detects with a value of
40. One could address this by implementing a slightly more
complex EM algorithm that shrinks the imputed values
toward a global mean; however, such an approach assumes

that Pdlim2 is actually expressed in the normal samples in REFERENCES

dataset 3. Given that all three replicates resulted in a non-
detect, it may be that Pdlim2 is truly unexpressed in these
samples. Any modeling for such situations will depend on the
speciﬁc dataset being analyzed and the biological plausibility of
the potential assumptions.

One can also use the EM algorithm to directly estimate the
parameters of interest. In the example datasets reported here,
these might be the average expression of each gene within each
sample-type, 9i]; Alternatively, one could use this framework to
directly estimate the ACt or AACt values. Furthermore, the EM
algorithm allows one to easily combine the treatment of non-
detects with more complex statistical analyses.

5 DISCUSSION

In this manuscript, we have shown that the default procedure of
replacing qPCR non-detects with the maximum PCR cycle
number (typically 40) introduces a large bias in subsequent in-
ference. We have carefully examined the nature of non-detects
and shown that they likely represent data missing not at random.
Furthermore, we have shown that many non-detects represent an
ampliﬁcation failure rather than a true Ct value >40. Finally, we
propose a relatively simple EM algorithm and show that it is
able to greatly reduce the bias caused by non-detects. The ﬂexi-
bility of our approach allows one to easily tailor the method
described here to one’s own analyses. Speciﬁcally, one could
easily use a different normalization procedure or perform a
more complex statistical analysis. Additionally, any analysis
based on imputed values (rather than direct estimation of a par-
ameter of interest) would beneﬁt from a multiple imputation
procedure.

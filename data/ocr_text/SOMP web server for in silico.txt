Abstract

Summary: A new freely available web server site of metabolism predictor to predict the sites
of metabolism (SOM) based on the structural formula of chemicals has been developed. It is
based on the analyses of ’structure-SOM’ relationships using a Bayesian approach and
labelled multilevel neighbourhoods of atoms descriptors to represent the structures of over
1000 metabolized xenobiotics. The server allows predicting SOMs that are catalysed by 1A2,
2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 isoforms of cytochrome P450 and enzymes of the UDP-glucuronosyl-
transferase family. The average invariant accuracy of prediction that was calculated for the
training sets (using leave-one-out cross-validation) and evaluation sets is 0.9 and 0.95,
respectively.

1 Introduction

Drug metabolism affects the drug efficiency and toxicity and is div-
ided into Phase I (oxidation, hydrolysis, reduction) and Phase II
(conjugation) reactions. Cytochromes P450 (CYP) are the main en-
zymes of Phase I (Lewis and Ito, 2008; Williams et al., 2004), which
metabolize most drugs. Glucuronidation is the main reaction of
Phase II, which is catalysed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)
and serves as a clearance mechanism for drugs from many thera-
peutic classes (King et al., 2000). Prediction of the sites of metabol-
ism (SOM) is important during the drug discovery process to detect
possible ‘metabolic hot spots’ in lead compounds that can be modi-
fied to obtain more metabolically stable compounds. The SOM pre-
diction can be used for an integral estimation of activity and toxicity
of a compound including its possible metabolites.

There are two freely available web servers, which allow predict-
ing SOMs for xenobiotics that are metabolized by P45 0 isoenzymes.
SmartCyp predicts SOMs for compounds that are metabolized by
CYP2C and CYP2D6 (Rydberg et al., 2010), and RS-WebPredictor
(Zaretzki et al., 2013) predicts SOMs for nine CYP isoforms (1A2,
2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4).

We have previously developed a method to predict SOMs
(Rudik et al., 2014) by using only structural formulae, which distin-
guishes from traditional SOM-predicting methods that use molecu-
lar docking and molecular dynamics or quantum mechanical and
semi-empirical calculations.

The detailed description of the algorithm was published
(Filimonov et al., 2014; Rudik et al., 2014) and shown in the
Supplementary text 51. In this article, we highlight the extension of

our method and show a new freely available web server for SOM
prediction for five major isoforms of P45 0 and UGT.

2 Materials and methods

We extended our previously described method with the prediction
of glucuronidation sites. The interactions of xenobiotics with human
enzymes were considered. The heterogeneous training sets were col-
lected from the available in vitro and in vivo experimental studies in
publications and the Biovia (Accelrys) Metabolite database. The
collected data were used as the positive examples. The negative
examples were generated as original structures with labelled atoms,
which were not detected as SOMs in the experiments. The training
set with the glucuronidation reaction (906 positive examples) and
previously created training sets were used in the developed web
server (Table 1).

The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO CV) procedure was per-
formed during the training procedure, and two values (Pt and Pf) were
calculated for every example structure from the training set. Pt is the
probability that this example would be positive; Pf is the probability
that this example would be negative. AP was calculated as Pt-Pf. The
invariant accuracy of prediction (IAP) criterion, which is similar to the
AUC [the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Swets,
1988)], was used to estimate the accuracy of the created method.
Mathematically, the IAP (Filimonov et al., 2008) value is equal to the
probability that the estimated AP is higher for a randomly selected
positive example than for a randomly selected negative example.

3 Site of metabolism predictor web server

The web server for the SOM prediction for drug-like compounds
that are metabolized by the main CYP isoforms and UGT was cre-
ated based on the aforementioned training sets and called the site of
metabolism predictor (SOMP). The average IAP value that was
calculated during the LOO CV procedure is approximately 0.9
(Table 1). The SOM prediction was validated based on the external
evaluation sets with data on biotransformations for 68 cardiovascu-
lar drugs (full list in Supplementary text S1). The accuracy of the
CYP validation was similar or higher than the results of
SMARTCyp and RS-WebPredictor (Rudik et al., 2014). The glucur-
onidation prediction results for the evaluation set (Table 1 and the
Supplementary text S1) show high prediction accuracy.

Fig. 1. SOMP results for Dolutegravir (DTG; S/GSK1349572)

or SMILES strings (Weininger, 1988) [converted by Open Babel
(Guha et al., 2006)] or upload a file in ‘MOL’ format (Dalby et al.,
1992). Prediction is calculated only for single-component uncharged
structures of low-molecular-weight organic molecules with at least
three carbon atoms. The SOM prediction results include a tested
structure with numbered atoms and tables, which include the atoms
and their ranks according to the probability to be attacked by each
enzyme. They can be saved as SDF or PDF files. The user obtains
CYPs and UGT tables with the prediction results and can sort them
by atom numbers or atom ranks.

3.2 Implementation

The SOMP web server uses MySQL server to store the data and
PHP and HTML codes to implement the main interface. The Python
script is used to produce independent sub-processes to generate in-
put to the prediction program and data processing. The prediction
runs ~0.5 s on modern PC (requiring ~20 Mb RAM) independently
for each user, and many users can simultaneously use it. For each
non-hydrogen atom in the molecular structure that was sent to the
prediction, AP was calculated, and the atoms are arranged in des-
cending order of AP. The prediction for Dolutegravir (this drug was
not included in the training set) is illustrated in Figure 1. The SOM
that is known for UGT glucuronidation (atom number 28) was
ranked as number one. The SOM that is known for being attacked
by CYP3A4 (atom number 18) was correctly predicted according to

the top-ranking atom estimation (second position in the list) (Reese
et al., 2013). This result and the data in Table 1 show that the SOMP
web server has reasonable prediction accuracy and may be used to
study the drug metabolism.

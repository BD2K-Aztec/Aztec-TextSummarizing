Abstract

Motivation: Nonlinear dose—response models are primary tools for estimating the potency [e.g.
half—maximum inhibitory concentration (IC) known as IC50] of anti—cancer drugs. We present
drexplorer software, which enables biologists to evaluate replicate reproducibility, detect outlier
data points, fit different models, select the best model, estimate lC values at different percentiles
and assess drug—drug interactions. drexplorer serves as a computation engine within the R en—
vironment and a graphical interface for users who do not have programming backgrounds.

Availability and implementation: The drexplorer R package is freely available from GitHub at

 

https://github.com/nickytong/drexplorer. A graphical user interface is shipped with the package.

1 Introduction

Understanding the dose—response relationship of therapeutic com—
pounds is a major focus of clinical oncology. Large—scale drug
screening in cancer cell lines has demonstrated that different gen—
omic characteristics (mutations) confer distinct drug sensitivity, sup—
porting patient stratification into treatment regimens on the basis of
genomic markers (Barretina et 61]., 2012; Yang et 61]., 2013). Cell
lines resistant to single—drug treatment may respond to synergistic
drug combinations (Lehar, et 61]., 2009). As cell viability assays be—
come widely used, it is important to provide easily accessible tools
to analyze drug profiling data.

We developed drexplorer software in the R environment
(R Core Team, 2014) to encompass several aspects of dose—response
analysis: assess reproducibility of replicated experiments, detect out—
lier data points, fit different models, identify the best model, esti—
mate inhibitory concentration (IC) values and evaluate drug—drug
interactions.

2 Algorithms

A typical drug screening experiment exposes cells to a range of con—
centrations (doses) of a drug and quantifies cell viability (response).
To account for experimental variations, multiple measurements are
obtained for each dose. We denote the jth repeat of the ith dose by
xi,- and the corresponding response by 32,-). For anti—cancer drug
screening, response 32,-,- is further scaled by the mean response of the
controls (i.e. under xi,- = 0) and is called relative viability.

2.1 Outlier detection

Outlier values in response 32,-,- will affect dose—response curve fitting
and IC estimation. We implement the Newman test (Newman, 1939)
to detect outliers, defining the test statistic as q : w/s, where w is
the maximum difference among the response vector (32,1, . . . ,yiml.) at
the ith dose and s is the standard deviation of the response in un—
treated controls. Once calculated, the test statistic can be compared

with the threshold value from the null distribution under the speci—
fied type I error (cc : 0.01 or 0.05 ). We apply this test to identify out—
lier data points at each dose separately. Figure 1a shows outlier
detection using the ryegrass data (Ritz and Streibig, 2005).

2.2 Assessing reproducibility

When replicate experiments have been performed, it is necessary to
assess the quality of the reproducibility. We use the concordance
correlation coefficient (CCC) to capture both the location shift and
the scale shift between replicates (Lawrence and Lin, 1989). CCC
ranges between —1 and 1, where CCC : 1 means perfect agreement.
Figure 1c illustrates the reproducibility assessment for two technical
replicates run on different dates.

2.3 The dose—response model
The dose—response model can be expressed as a nonlinear function:

y,,-=f(x,-,-; 0)+8,'i, i: 1,  , mi: 1,  ,mi,
where 0 is the vector of unknown parameters, 8,,- is the measurement
error for the response 32,-), n is the total number of doses administered
and m,- is the number of repeats under the ith dose. The error term
81,‘ is assumed to be identically independently distributed
as N (0, 0' 2). In the case of the sigmoid Emax model, f has the
following form:

Emaxxi'b
y” EDSOI” + x,,-/v
Here, 0 : (E0,Emax,ED50,/9) is the vector of parameters to be
estimated.
The dose—response models in drexplorer include all the mod—
els in the drc (Ritz and Streibig, 2005) and DoseFinding

ll'llEl'ﬂ-Ellﬂl'l pln'l

(Bornkamp, et al., 2010) packages and can be easily used through a
uniform interface.

Parameters in the dose—response models can be estimated by
minimizing the sum of the squared residuals (SSR):

SSR : 2:00," — “xii; 9 
I I

After fitting the model, we estimate the IC at percentile ‘E by solving
x in equation I = f (x; 0 ), where 0 is the vector of the fitted
parameters.

Different models can be fit, so we identify the best model as that
with minimum residual standard error, calculated as SSR divided by
degrees of freedom. Approaches for parametric dose—response mod—
els may use the Akaike information criterion or Bayesian informa-
tion criterion.

2.4 The Interaction Index for Drug Combinations

The interaction index (IAI) is useful to quantify the degree of inter—
action in drug combinations. For a 2—drug combination, IAI can be
defined as

< 1, synergistic

1A12i+£

: 1, additive
D341 Dy;

> 1, antagonistic

Here, Dxl and Dy; and are the doses needed to induce response 3/
for drugs 1 and 2 when administered alone; d1 and d2 are the doses
in the mixture that produce the same response 3/. We adopt the
source code used by Lee, et al. (2007) and Lee and Kong (2009) to
estimate the IAI and 95% confidence interval (see Fig. 1b using
UMSCC22B data; Lee and Kong, 2009). Graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) help users without advanced programming skills to analyze
dose—response data (Fig. 1d and e).

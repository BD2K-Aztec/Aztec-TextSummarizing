ABSTRACT

Motivation: Copy number abbreviation (CNA) is one type of genomic
aberration that is often induced by genome instability and is asso-
ciated with diseases such as cancer. Determination of the genome-
wide CNA profile is an important step in identifying the underlying
mutation mechanisms. Genomic data based on next-generation
sequencing technology are particularly suitable for determination of
high-quality CNA profile. Now is an important time to reevaluate the
use of sequencing techniques for CNA analysis, especially with the
rapid growth of the different targeted genome and whole-genome
sequencing strategies.

Results: In this study, we provide a comparison of resequencing stra-
tegies, with regard to their utility, applied to the same hepatocellular
carcinoma sample for copy number determination. These strategies
include whole-genome, exome and restriction site-associated DNA
(RAD) sequencing. The last of these strategies is a targeted sequen-
cing technique that involves cutting the genome with a restriction
enzyme and isolating the targeted sequences. Our data demonstrate
that RAD sequencing is an efficient and comprehensive strategy that
allows the cost-effective determination of CNAs. Further investigation
of RAD sequencing data led to the finding that a precise measurement
of the allele frequency would be a helpful complement to the read
depth for CNA analysis for two reasons. First, knowledge of the
allele frequency helps to resolve refined calculations of allele-specific
copy numbers, which, in turn, identify the functionally important CNAs
that are under natural selection on the parental alleles. Second, this
knowledge enables deconvolution of CNA patterns in complex
genomic regions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome instability, including nucleotide mutations, chromo-
somal rearrangements and DNA dose aberrations, promotes
genetic variation. Among these possible genomic aberrations,
DNA copy numbers are of high diversity in normal human
populations (Sharp et al., 2005) and are associated with various
human diseases, such as birth defects (Lu et al., 2008) and neu-
rodegenerative diseases ONalsh et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2008).
Notably, tumourigenesis involves a process of accumulation of
chromosomal mutations that induce the activation of oncogenes,
the loss of function of tumour suppressors and cell proliferation.
Copy number aberrations (CNAs), in the form of regions of
somatic ampliﬁcation or deletion, are an important subclass of
chromosomal mutation associated with tumourigenesis (Pinkel
and Albertson, 2005; Stratton et al., 2009).

Investigations of CNAs and the biological mechanism through
which they occur have shed new light on the human genome
variations that exist among individuals with disease or normal
phenotypes. Many studies have examined the differences in
CNAs between tumour cells and normal cells and have estimated
the rearrangement phylogeny of cancer genomes on the basis of
their CNAs (Campbell et al., 2008; Greenman et al., 2011; Navin
et al., 2011; Pleasance et al., 2010; Tao et al., 2011). CNAs and
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in humans have
revealed extensive genetic diversity in populations (Fu et al.,
2010; Sudmant et al., 2010). A framework based on evolutionary
genetics has been adopted to understand the disease-causing
deleterious CNAs or beneﬁcial CNAs present in human popula-
tions (Cooper et al., 2007; Elia et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2011;
Nozawa et al., 2007; Perry et al., 2007).

The successful characterization of copy number proﬁles is the
ﬁrst step in pinpointing the CNAs that have signiﬁcant biological
roles in disease occurrence and normal phenotypic variation.
In the past 15 years, profound advances have been made in the
major technologies offering genome-wide scanning of CNAs,
such as array-based comparative genomic hybridization with
high-density oligo probes (Bentz et al., 1998; Solinas-Toldo
et al., 1997), SNP genotyping arrays (Lin et al., 2004) and
recently developed next-generation sequencing-based approaches

(Shendure and Ji, 2008). Array-based technologies generate ana-
logue ﬂuorescence signals that are prone to noise (Haraksingh
et al., 2011; Pinto et al., 2011; Xi et al., 2011), and short-read
sequencing platforms provide an effective alternative way of
identifying CNAs. Next-generation sequencing technologies pro-
vide high-resolution nucleotide-level digital readouts of the gen-
omic composition of cells (Ding et al., 2010; Garvey, 2010;
Mardis, 2011). Especially because the genomes of more and
more species have been sequenced and assembled, resequencing
has become increasingly more convenient for CNA analysis than
the existing array-based technologies, which require signiﬁcant
work to design new sets of probes. Resequencing strategies for
genomes, including exome sequencing and whole-genome
sequencing (WGS), confer beneﬁts in detecting CNAs and
rearrangements (Alkan et al., 2011; Medvedev et al., 2010;
Sathirapongsasuti et al., 2011; Xi et al., 2011). Both the read
depth and the minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of heterozygous
loci estimated from the sequencing data are informative in infer-
ring copy numbers. Low MAFs have been used, in addition to
read depth, to screen for CNA segments conferring adaptive
advantages and to conﬁrm the breakpoints of CNAs (Abyzov
et al., 2011; Krumm et al., 2012; Nguyen et al., 2006; Simpson
et al., 2010; Tao et al., 2011; Xie and Tammi, 2009).

However, sequencing biases can be introduced from many
sources and may negatively impact the precise measurement of
read depth and allele frequency throughout the genome. Uneven
sampling in DNA fragmentation during library preparation,
PCR bias due to the GC-content of fragments and errors in
the mapping of reads are all sources of variability in the char-
acterization of genomic regions. In addition to these sources of
bias, exome sequencing has an excessive allele bias because of the
unbalanced sampling of the two alleles that can result from dif-
ferences in probe afﬁnity (Asan et al., 2011). Unlike deep-cover-
age (>20><) WGS data, low-coverage (1 ><~3 x) WGS data fail to
provide important information regarding the allele frequencies of
heterozygous loci. Efforts have been made to overcome these
shortcomings in the sequencing data, and both GC correction
and hidden Markov models have been integrated into the statis-
tical tools used to detect CNAs; however, the success of these
efforts has been limited (Abyzov et al., 2011; Krumm et al., 2012;
Xie and Tammi, 2009; Yoon et al., 2009). Restriction site-
associated DNA (RAD) sequencing is a targeted sequencing
technique that involves cutting genomic DNA with at least one
restriction enzyme and isolating the target sequences from entire
genomes. RAD sequencing was developed to efﬁciently identify
SNPs, map Quantitative trait locis (QTLs) and measure the gen-
etic structure of natural populations of various non-model or-
ganisms (Baird et al., 2008; Davey et al., 2011; Hohenlohe et al.,
2010; Robinson et al., 2012). Intuitively, the majority of CNA
segments would be covered by densely packed genome-wide
RAD reads. Hence, the RAD sequencing strategy holds promise
for CNA analysis. Herein, we proposed this wet-lab strategy,
RAD sequencing, to cover ~5% of the genome of a hepatocel-
lular carcinoma (HCC) sample for optimal CNA analysis. Using
the same sample, we systematically compared the performance of
RAD sequencing with that of the most commonly used alterna-
tive strategies in constructing the CNA proﬁle. From this study,
there is sufﬁcient evidence to support the notion that the RAD
sequencing strategy, which allows a precise measurement of both

the read depth and allele frequency, is a comprehensive solution
to the problem of CNA characterization.

2 METHODS

2.1 Sample information

We recruited a female patient who had a chronic Hepatitis B virus infec-
tion and who was diagnosed with HCC at the age of 35. The tumour
section was determined to be grade II—III HCC with prominent clear cell
components. The adjacent non-tumour tissue was dissected as a control.

2.2 RAD sequencing

Fragments adjacent to restriction sites were collected based on the
method designed by Baird et a]. (2008). Two micrograms of genomic
DNA from the tumour sample was digested for 30 min at 37°C using
lul EcoRI, High ﬁdelity in a 50-ul reaction volume. A modiﬁed P1
adapter with a single 5’ -AATT—3’ cohesive end was added to the samples
at the same molarity as the tags in a 20 ul T4 ligase reaction system.
Restriction digest by an enzyme with a palindromic target sequence
enabled the ligation of the adapter to the upstream and downstream
sequences ﬂanking the restriction sites. Following sonication, the fraction
of the sonicated ligation products corresponding to a fragment size range
of 250—350 bp was retrieved. The DNA fragments were then end-re-
paired, ligated to modiﬁed illumina P2 adapters and ampliﬁed. To in-
crease the sequencing speciﬁcity for sequences adjacent to restriction sites,
we adjusted the sequence of the sequencing primer to
ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTAATTG by
adding 5’ -AATTG-3’ to its 3’ end. In RAD sequencing, 100 bp single-
end reads were generated using a Hiseq 2000. We designed a compact
reference based on the framework of the human NCBI36/hg18 genome
assemble that consisted of groups of 100 bp genomic sequences ﬂanking
the known EcoRI restriction sites. The Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA)
software was used to align the raw RAD sequencing data. Total 80X
RAD data for the tumour sample were subjected to downstream analysis.

2.3 Exome sequencing and WGS sequencing

For exome sequencing, an Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon Kit was
used to capture 1.22% (37 Mb) of the human genome and the reads were
sequenced with SOLiD (Tao et al., 2011). We used the BWA program for
the alignment of SOLiD reads to the exome regions of NCBI36/hgl8
whole-genome assembly. A total of 56X uniquely mappable reads
were obtained. Whole-genome reads for the same tumour sample were
sequenced according to manufacturer’s standard protocols on two plat-
forms: Solexa and SOLiD (Tao et al., 2011).The reads were mapped to
the NCBI36/hgl8 whole-genome assembly. We used the BWA program
for the alignment of both SOLiD reads and Solexa reads with the default
parameters. A total of 20X uniquely mappable reads for the tumour
sample were subjected to downstream analysis. WGS data (20X) were
also generated from the adjacent non-tumour sample for use as the
control (Tao et al., 2011).

2.4 Statistics describing the precise measurement of read
depth proﬁles

We adopted the mean value of the windowed coefﬁcient of variation

(WCV) as a measure of the dispersion of the read depth signals. The

WCV, a normalized measure of the dispersion of a probability distribu-

tion, is deﬁned as the ratio of the standard deviation 0 to the mean u in a

window:

WCV = UW/MW,

Determination of genomic copy number alteration

 

Another statistic used in our analysis is the absolute difference of
Gaussians (ADOG), which is deﬁned as:

1 exp<_ﬂ) _;exp<_M)
am 202 a 271 202

The integral of the ADOG function reﬂected the visibility of the edges
and was used to measure the edge sharpness distinguishing the CNA
breakpoints. In practice, the parameters of two distributions were esti-
mated with the read depths of all the loci in the 5M-length window
upstream and downstream to each breakpoint, respectively. The integral
value of ADOG for each breakpoint was computed based on the
estimated parameters.

2.5 Estimating read depth proﬁles and MAF

We deﬁned N consecutive restriction sites as a unit and calculated the
read counts in the unit to represent the read depth proﬁle for comparisons
across different sequencing strategies. Here, low-coverage WGS data
covered the whole genome at a depth of ~3>< and were collected from
two lanes of Solexa sequencing. The read depth proﬁles were generated
with various N values from RAD and WGS deep-sequencing data. Box-
plots of the WCV showed that a smooth and stable measurement of the
dispersion of the read depth proﬁles was achieved when we chose N
values of no less than 10 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore, 10 consecu-
tive restriction sites were treated as a unit in this study. We used two-step
method to deﬁne the region without genomic alteration under the two
assumptions that the percentage of genome altered might be larger than
50% and there are some balance ampliﬁcations of both alleles. First, we
chose candidate regions where the heterozygous sites had MAF of 0.5.
Next, the probability distribution function of read depth was estimated
for loci within the candidate regions, and then the read depth with max-
imum probability value was determined as the value taken to normalize
the data. In our data, this value was almost the same as the median value
of read depths for loci within the candidate regions.

Heterozygous sites were extracted from the deep-sequencing WGS
data obtained from the adjacent non-tumour sample according to the
following criteria: (i) the candidate sites were germ-line mutation sites
that were included in the SNP database dbSNP130; (ii) the total read
depths of the sites were not lower than 20; (iii) the estimated MAFs of the
sites in the adjacent non-tumour sample were not <03; and (iv) the inter-
val between two candidate sites was >10bp. The MAF of each hetero-
zygous site was estimated using the read depth of each allele from RAD,
deep WGS and exome sequencing data from the tumour sample. Usually,
the MAF baseline was below 0.5 because of marginal effects of the integer
read depth ratio. The MAF baseline was ~0.4 for the WGS and 0.45 for
the RAD sequencing.

2.6 Detection of copy number alterations

We used the JointSLM algorithm, which uses two independent stochastic
processes by means of the shifting level model, to split the read depth
proﬁles into distinct segments (Magi et al., 2011). Then, the candidate
CNAs were identiﬁed after merging neighbouring segments with similar
copy numbers using the FastCall algorithm (Benelli et al., 2010). The
above computational process is well established and widely used. The
same process was applied to all sequencing data. Three non-CNA regions
that were supported by both the read depth and MAF values obtained
from all of the sequencing strategies were validated via quantitative poly-
merase chain reaction (qPCR) to calibrate the baselines of the read depth
proﬁles. Deletion and ampliﬁcation were deﬁned according to whether
the changes in read depth values observed for the regions corresponded to
the gain or loss of at least 20% relative to the baseline. We calculated the
average MAF of each CNA based on all the heterozygous sites within
the CNA region. The criterion that the average MAF differed from the

frequency baseline by 0.05 was used to qualify the ﬁdelity of the CNA
segments.

2.7 Defining low- or ultra-mappable regions and
abnormal mappability

We simulated 2 X 100 paired-end reads, covering the human genome at
~50X, to assess the mappability of a diploid genome. The read counts in
a 4—kb window were calculated and calibrated by dividing the median
value across the whole chromosome. Segmentation of the diploid genome
was performed by the standard pipeline combining the JointSLM and
FastCall algorithms. The low- and ultra-mappable regions were delimited
as segments with outlier read depth values (20% change) compared with
the baseline of 1.0. The CNAs in which >50% of the sequence-spanned
regions that were low— or ultra-mappable were deﬁned as those that were
associated with abnormal mappability.

2.8 Genotyping validation of allele frequencies by
Sequenom

The SequenomTM platform was used to screen ~58 heterozygous sites
with differential allele frequencies identiﬁed across different sequencing
strategies to assess the precision of MAF estimation from sequencing
data. The frequency measurement at each site was replicated three
times to account for technical variation associated with the method.
Genotyping primers and extension probes were online designed with
default parameters and were conﬁrmed by in Silica PCR ampliﬁcation
prior to synthesis and standard puriﬁcation. Mass spectrometric genotyp-
ing using TypePLEX chemistries was conducted on genomic DNA from
the tumour sample. The heights of the raw spectral peaks were quantiﬁed,
and the mutant allele percentage was determined using the default
settings of the MassARRAY Typer 4.0 Analyzer.

2.9 qPCR validation of segments occurring in CNAs

Primers were designed using Primer3 with default settings to limit the
amplicon length to 150—200 bp. Each primer was shown to amplify a
unique site in the genome via in Silica PCR. qPCR experiments were
conducted using MaximaTM SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix in triplicate
reactions according to the product manual. The reactions were ampliﬁed
on a BioRad CFX96TM real-time system. The resultant crossing thresh-
olds (Ct) were analysed using the AACt method. Two DNA templates
derived from the blood of two healthy female donors were adopted as the
controls to calibrate the AACt values in the experiments. We assumed
that all qPCR segments were diploid for the DNA templates from the
healthy donors.
The false positives were identiﬁed using the formula:

11211712 1 CopyNumber — qPCRij > 26, where CopyNumber,

was the estimated copy number using read depths based on deep WGS,
low WGS or RAD sequencing data, and qPCR was the value obtained in
two qPCR validations. The threshold 6 was deﬁned as the maximum
distance between the estimated copy numbers across multiple sequencing
strategies and the validated copy numbers via qPCR in the non-CNA
segments.

3.1 Overall CNA proﬁles from different resequencing
strategies

signiﬁcant CNAs during tumourigenesis with EcoRI enzyme.
Single-end reads of 100 bp were obtained and mapped to the

densely packed reference, consisting of groups of 100 bp genomic
sequences ﬂanking the restriction sites. A total of 96.4% of the
expected restriction sites were covered by real reads. The distance
spanned by 80% of the neighbouring pairs of EcoRI restriction
sites was within the range of 1—10 kb. Ideally, the read counts of
pairs of 5’ directional and 3’ directional genomic fragments that
result from enzymatic digestion should be equal if there were no
CNA breakpoints ﬂanking the restriction sites. Therefore, a ﬁl-
tering system was used to efﬁciently eliminate partial sequencing
biases that would negatively impact the CNA analysis. We con-
sidered the restriction sites where the ratio of read counts
between the two adjacent fragments was <15 to be valid for
subsequent analysis. As a result of this ﬁltering step, 519656
valid RAD restriction sites were identiﬁed among a total of
778 114 sites obtained by EcoRI digestion, and these were
dispersed across the whole genome.

A total of 20x WGS data and 56X exome capture sequencing
data were simultaneously generated from the same HCC sample
as well as 80x RAD sequencing data. The data from the differ-
ent resequencing strategies provided an opportunity to conduct a
comparative study of their utility in CNA analysis. We took
advantage of the read depth and MAF measurements for each
chromosomal locus to delineate the CNA proﬁles from deep
WGS, low WGS, exome sequencing and RAD sequencing
data. The CNA proﬁles composed of read depth proﬁles and
MAF proﬁles were described in Figure l. The snapshots of the
read depth and MAF proﬁles provided an intuitive overview and
visible comparison of CNA estimation across the different
sequencing strategies.

Fig. 1. Overall read depth and MAF proﬁles in an HCC sample across
different resequencing strategies. In the read depth proﬁles, each locus is
represented by the average read count and calibrated by the respective
median value. Ten consecutive restriction sites were treated as a unit. In
MAF proﬁles, each locus represents the regionally averaged frequencies
of ﬁve heterozygous sites identiﬁed by RAD and one site by exome
sequencing, and 100 heterozygous sites by WGS

3.2 Comparison of the precise measurements of read
depth and MAF

Intuitively, we would achieve high accuracy in CNA detection if
the scatter diagram was compact and the edges of the CNA
segments were sharp. Here, we applied statistical and experimen-
tal validations to precisely evaluate and compare the read depth
and MAF measurements obtained from the resequencing data.
The ﬁrst statistic applied was the WCV, the mean value of which
represents the dispersion of the read depth proﬁle across each
chromosome. Another statistic applied was the ADOG function,
which is regarded as an indicator of the sharpness of the segment
boundary at the CNA breakpoint. Experimentally, the allele
frequencies of 58 randomly selected heterozygous sites were vali-
dated via Sequenom genotyping to evaluate the accuracy of the
MAF estimation made on the basis of the sequencing data.
The results of the comparisons are described in Figure 2. We
balanced the datasets of RAD-seq in the total number of reads
by randomly sampling reads in the experiments when comparing
with exome sequencing and WGS data. The raw data and the
balanced datasets supporting the subplots shown in Figure 2
are summarized in Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3. In

dispersion of the segments and the sharpness of the breakpoints
in the read depth proﬁles. The mean values of the WCV revealed
that the datasets provided by both the RAD sequencing and
deep WGS strategies had lower dispersion in their read depth
proﬁles than was found in data generated by the low WGS strat-
egy (Fig. 2A). RAD sequencing was found to be the most effect-
ive strategy for obtaining sharpened edges when integer values of
the absolute difference between two probability distributions of
read depth ﬁanking 16 common breakpoints were measured,
even when total coverage of reads was reduced to a low level
(Fig. 2B). The data indicated that exome sequencing provided
insufﬁcient measurement of the required variables (Fig. 2A and
B). The percentile plot shown in Figure 2C depicts the deviation
of the estimated allele frequency values from the corresponding
frequencies obtained by independent genotyping analysis for 58
heterozygous sites. RAD sequencing provided over 60 000 het-
erozygous sites (corresponding to 6% of the sites characterized
by deep WGS) where MAFs were scored for CNA analysis. The
results of the genotyping analysis demonstrated that the esti-
mated allele frequencies of ~70% of the validated heterozygous
sites identiﬁed by 80X RAD sequencing were within the error
margin of the Sequenom genotyping system. The percentage did
not reduce too much when RAD reads were sampled to be 50X
and 20x. Therefore, sufﬁcient evidence supports the conclusion
that RAD sequencing gave a precise measurement of read depth
and MAF and achieved a comparable result with that of the deep
WGS strategy for CNA analysis.

3.3 Determination of genomic copy number alterations
in an accurate and robust fashion

CNAs in the HCC sample that were not situated within the
centromeric or telomeric regions were surveyed. For the 80x
RAD sequencing dataset, a total of 36 CNAs were detected
from the read depth proﬁle, of which 30 (~83.3%) were con-
ﬁrmed by the MAFs (Table l and Supplementary Table S4). We
trimmed the raw reads of 80X RAD sequencing to a length of
35 bp and surveyed the CNAs based on the trimmed data.
Thirty-two of the 37 CNA segments were overlapped with
the 36 segments identiﬁed from the original raw data
(Supplementary Table S5). Moreover, RAD-seq reached a high
level of convergence on CNA calling in 80x, 50X and 20x reads
(Supplementary Table S9). Therefore, the RAD sequencing strat-
egy was robust for CNA identiﬁcation.

The CNAs identiﬁed from WGS data were also summarized in
Table l and Supplementary Table S4 for comparison. The exist-
ing CNA calls previously identiﬁed using WGS mate-pairs
(>3 kb library insert size) and read depth proﬁles (Tao et al.,
2011) were all detected by RAD sequencing. The conﬁrmed
CNAs with a length of >2 Mb were consistent across the RAD
sequencing and deep WGS strategies. As shown by the Venn
diagram in Figure 3A, 20 of the CNA regions overlapped
across the different sequencing strategies.

However, we also noted that many CNAs were speciﬁc to
certain sequencing strategies, and low- or high-WGS data con-
tributed 2.5-fold more CNAs, of which less than half were sup-
ported by their MAF proﬁles. Therefore, we performed a
simulated analysis and experimental validation to assess the
CNA pools that were speciﬁc to particular sequencing

strategies. Simulated WGS data from the human genome
NCBI36/hg18 assembly exhibited many medium-sized spanning
regions that were subject to abnormal mappability, which
would introduce false-positive CNAs. The data shown in
Table 1 revealed that in deep WGS, ll of 33 CNAs (and 6
of 13 double-conﬁrmed CNAs) <l Mb spanned regions that
were determined to be subject to abnormal mappability. In
contrast, when the RAD sequencing strategy was used, in
which subregions of the human genome were used as the ref-
erence and a minimum of mismatched or multiple hits
occurred, the mappability of the targeted genomic regions
had less inﬂuence on the precise identiﬁcation of CNAs.
Ahnost all of the 36 CNAs detected in the RAD sequencing
data were identiﬁed in spanning regions that were not subject
to abnormal mappability. We randomly selected targets from
the pool where the CNAs with distinct copy numbers estimated
across different sequencing strategies. The qPCR veriﬁcation
was performed in the tumour sample using blood samples
from two normal adults as controls. Three non-CNA regions
that were supported by both their read depths and their MAFs
from all of the sequencing strategies were also validated to
identify and evaluate the false positives in the estimated copy
numbers. The differences between the estimated copy numbers
and the qPCR values are shown in Figure 3B. The raw data
supporting the subplot are summarized in Supplementary Table
S6. Using the three non-CNA segments as controls, the marked
outliers represent the false positives in the different sequencing
strategies (Fig. 3B). The qPCR results indicate that RAD
sequencing achieved an 89.4% (17 of 19) validation rate and
that there were ~50 or 75% false positives derived from deep-
or low-WGS, respectively.

Even for the overlapping CNAs shown in the Venn diagram
(Fig. 3A), the different sequencing strategies estimated the copy
numbers with varying degrees of precision. For example, there
was an interesting high-copy duplication region located at
chrllq. The copy number of this region was determined to be

were veriﬁed, including three non-CNA regions as controls and 19 pending CNA regions. Two primers were designed for each CNA segment, and the
qPCR values for the two primers were marked with ‘+’ or ‘X’, respectively. The segments supported by two qPCR primers with similar qPCR values
were retained. The copy numbers estimated from deep WGS, low WGS and RAD sequencing data are represented by circles, triangles and diamonds,
respectively. Outliers conﬁrmed as being false positives were ﬁlled in a solid style

521 via qPCR and was estimated as 3.93, 4.54 and 3.15 from
deep WGS, RAD and low WGS data, respectively. RAD
sequencing inferred more accurate copy numbers in this ultra-
high ampliﬁcation region.

3.4 MAF: an essential element for CNA analysis

The genomes of tumour cells experience enormous CNA muta-
tions. Unlike diploid genomic regions, the relative ratio of two
parental copies will not be equal to 121 under the selection pres-
sures for clonal expansion in a tumour. This has led to the con-
clusion that CNA segments with uneven ampliﬁcation of the
two parental copies have functional importance that is strongly
associated with tumourigenesis (Nguyen et al., 2006; Tao et al.,
2011). Thus, the reﬁned calculation of allele-speciﬁc copy num-
bers would be meaningful following the accurate identiﬁcation of
CNA segments.

It is the MAF that distinguishes the uneven copy numbers of
the parental alleles. Based on MAF data from RAD sequencing,
we conﬁrmed a total of 30 CNA regions as being under allele
selection where the corresponding MAF was far from the base-
line of 0.5 (Table l and Supplementary Table S4). A chr5q
deletion with an MAF of 0.28 and a 15-fold read depth reduc-
tion was one such important CNA identiﬁed, and this CNA is
known to act as a driver of tumourigenesis. First, the deleted
allele of the chr5q deletion forms a C50rf51-CPEB4 fusion gene,
which has been validated by PCR on complementary DNA (Tao
et al., 2011). Second, a tumour-driving somatic non-synonymous
mutation in cyclin G1 (CCNGl), which is a target of P53, was in
the region spanned by chr5q, but was not located in the deleted
allele of chr5q. Therefore, uneven loss of the parental allele
copies results in the gain of a new fusion gene accompanied by
the driver mutation CCNGl and therefore promotes the selec-
tion of cells for clonal outgrowth in the tumour.

Genetic instability transforms the genome from its diploid
state to a chaotic karyotype. Complex patterns of genomic archi-
tecture indicate mixed temporal sequences of rearrangements.
Unlocking the nature and mechanisms of the CNA events that
occur will give us valuable insights into the mechanisms
of tumourigenesis. MAFs are able to identify ‘hidden’ CNA

events and track the history of CNA occurrences that cannot
be resolved by read depth proﬁles alone. For example, there
was an interesting observation at chr6q where a complex gen-
omic composition existed. We divided the chr6q region into three
segments, referred to as segment 1, segment 11 and segment 111
(Fig. 4A). The copy number of segment 11 was at the baseline,
whereas segments 1 and II had 075- and 15-fold copy numbers
relative to the baseline, respectively. Outwardly, the read depth
proﬁle indicated two separate segments with abnormal copy
numbers in the chr6q region where two CNA events occurred
independently. Correspondingly, segment 1, segment 11 and seg-
ment 111 had average MAFs of 0.28, 0.20 and 0.38, respectively,
following MAF correction under the rule that the MAF of the
baseline should be 0.5 (Fig. 4B). The MAF data suggested an
inconsistent fact, namely, that the frequency deviated strongly
from the 0.5 ratio in segment 11 where the copy number was at
the baseline. All of the patterns of two-component CNA events
occurring in chr6q region were examined and rejected because
two CNA events could not explain how the values of both the
copy number and the MAF had arisen (Fig. 4C). The data sug-
gested that there were at least three sequential non-separable
CNA events in the chr6q region. The most likely explanation is
that the tumour genome has a tetraploid baseline, a deletion of
one allele copy in segments 1 and II accompanied by a duplica-
tion of another allele copy in segments 11 and III and an aneu-
ploid duplication in segment III, which leads to the complex
genomic composition of chr6q.

4 DISCUSSION

Array is a comprehensive and commercial method for copy
number variation (CNV) calling. However, Xi et al. demon-
strated that the copy ratios given by sequencing data are more
accurate than that given by array platforms (Xi et al., 2011). Our
in-house data on MCF7 cell lines also showed direct plots in
which array was less sensitive than WGS to some segments
with copy number alterations (Supplementary Fig. S3, unpub-
lished data). We refactored WGS into array-type format in es-
sence and proposed a strategy of RAD sequencing aiming to
combine the advantage of array with sequencing for CNA

Fig. 4. Disclosing the ‘hidden’ CNA events at chr6q by integrating
MAFs with read depth information. (A) A partial enlarged view of the
read depth and MAF proﬁles for the chr6p CNA region, together with a
deﬁnition of the different segments analysed. (B) The corrected MAFs
and the ratios of read depth for each segment. (C) Description of the
possible CNA patterns. All of the patterns involving two-component
CNA events failed to explain the distinct values of read depth ratio
and MAF observed for the three segments. An assembly consisting of
three CNA events is given as a potential explanation of the origin of the
genomic variation observed at chr6q

analysis. In summary, RAD sequencing has its unique charac-
teristics. It reduces the mapping errors and noises in WGS. At
the same time, it formats the ﬂuorescence intensity in array to
numbers of reads, as digital PCR was derived from qPCR. High
noise-signal ratio and spatial biases in arrays are avoided. RAD
sequencing as well as other NGS strategies could detect multi-
copy ampliﬁcation, which arrays were not good due to satur-
ation of probes, and then give an estimation on copy number
in a broader range for a chromosomal region. In addition, the
restricted enzyme is ﬂexible to alter the density of restriction sites
without an upper limit but the density of SNP array is limited
with the number of all heterozygous sites. It is also worth high-
lighting that RAD sequencing is efﬁcient without customizing
speciﬁc probes of arrays for CNA analysis on new species.
However, we applied the RAD sequencing approach on an
HCC tumor as an example to interpret the effectiveness of
CNA calling and recognize there are some limits for the
method. First, the size of CNA captured with an RAD will
depend heavily on the density of restriction sites. The EcoRI
enzyme, with its six nucleotide recognition sequence, cut the
genome into fragments within the range of l—10kb. As a result
of treating 10 consecutive restriction sites as a unit, the valid
resolution of CNAs was limited to ~150kb. Flexibly, an

approach was taken for the selection of an alternative enzyme
to ensure the controllable resolution of CNA segments.
Supplementary Figure S2 showed the length distributions of
restriction fragments for enzymes with different recognition
sequences. For enzymes with four- or ﬁve-nucleotide recognition
sites, the distance spanned by pairs of neighbouring restriction
sites was shorter and the achieved CNA resolution would reach
the 10 kb level. The use of multiple enzymes to co-digest the
genomic DNA would, therefore, be a possible strategy for
increasing the sensitivity of CNA detection by RAD sequencing.
Second, we did a direct comparison on the cost between RAD
sequencing and SNP array. The cost of RAD sequencing is
higher than that of arrays, although it is competitive with
other sequencing methods. We calculated the cost of 50x
RAD sequencing with ~l.8 M restriction sites (co-digested by
two enzymes) and 100 bp-length reads (Supplementary
Table S7). It is 1.5 times of that of SNP 6.0.

Our deep WGS data were mixed with the reads generated at
an earlier stage from two sequencing platforms, SOLiD and
Solexa. We called the CNAs using the same pipeline for the
SOLiD reads and the Solexa reads independently to evaluate
the consistency across platforms. A total of 894 of the
1150 Mb CNA regions identiﬁed in the SOLiD data overlapped
with the 1158 Mb CNA regions identiﬁed in the Solexa data
(Supplementary Table S8). In addition, the sequencing quality
was reproducible across the Solexa and SOLiD platforms (Tao
et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011). Deep-sequencing data from the
Solexa platform would admittedly provide a superior dataset,
but the mixture of reads from two platforms had few negative
effects on CNA determination. Meanwhile, although it provides
a powerful dataset, deep WGS is costly and is associated with a
heavy computational and storage load. In fact, deep WGS was
not ideally perfect for CNA analysis as we expected. The number
of spanning regions that were subject to abnormal mappability
was one of the negative factors that caused inaccurate estimation
of read depth and MAFs. In the simulated deep WGS data,
~2.97% (85.2 of 2865.4 Mb) of the regions of the diploid
genome had mapped read counts that were outside the range
of 12- to 0.8-fold of the baseline. These regions increased the
noise in the genomic variability analysis and increased the
number of false-positive CNAs.

The use of MAF proﬁles provided a multitude of beneﬁts in
our study as follows: (i) MAF proﬁles conﬁrmed the CNAs
identiﬁed on the basis of read depth proﬁles; (ii) they allowed
a reﬁned calculation of the allele-speciﬁc copy number and
deﬁned imbalanced parental alleles and driver CNAs that may
be under selection for clonal expansion in tumourigenesis; and
(iii) the precise estimation of frequencies enabled the resolution
of CNA events in complex genomic variations. These beneﬁts
demonstrate that the allele frequency proﬁle of heterozygous
sites is a wonderful complement to read depth for CNA analysis
with sequencing data. But suitable and sensitive statistical
approaches incorporating read depths and allele frequencies are
required to be developed. We decoded the CNA composition in
an example of a complex genomic region at Chr6q by integrating
MAF and read depth information. Notably, Carter et al. have
recently quantiﬁed the absolute copy numbers of chromosomes
and tumour purity directly by analysis of somatic DNA alter-
ations (Carter et al., 2012). However, efforts are needed to build

a mathematical inference framework for deep analysis of CNAs,
not only to determine the nature and mechanism of CNA events
occurring in complex genomic regions but also to infer tumour
purity and actual DNA ploidy.

5 CONCLUSIONS

CNA is an important type of genetic mutation associated with
disease. Current strategies to investigate the CNA proﬁle can
be classiﬁed into two major categories: the nucleotide probe
hybridization-based strategies and the sequencing-based strate-
gies. The latter take advantage of precise information regarding
read depth, read content and allele frequencies and are, therefore,
more comprehensive in their determination of copy numbers.
However, the amount of sequencing data, the PCR ampliﬁcation
efﬁciency, the GC density and the mappability of raw reads
introduce complexities that can interfere with high-quality
CNA analysis. Here, a comparison among deep WGS, low
WGS, exome sequencing and RAD sequencing strategies was
performed.

The RAD sequencing strategy took full advantage of its
precise measurement of allele frequency and read depth to
make ampliﬁcation and deletion calls from sequencing data as
effectively as deep WGS. Importantly, two characteristics of
RAD sequencing should be emphasized. First, the reads were
mapped to a small subset of the whole genome, which was com-
posed of ﬂanking regions adjacent to the restriction sites. This
yielded a minimum of mismatched or multiple-mapping hits and
resulted in high-quality mapping of reads in general. Second, the
5’ directional and 3’ directional sequences adjacent to the restric-
tion sites were simultaneously sequenced because of the use of a
palindromic enzyme. This enabled us to introduce a ﬁltering
strategy, namely, that there should be no signiﬁcant disparity
between the read counts of the upstream and downstream
sequences adjacent to the restriction sites. In this way, sequencing
biases, such as unbalanced ampliﬁcations, were signiﬁcantly
reduced. In RAD sequencing, regionally averaged MAFs at
heterozygous sites, in addition to the read depth proﬁle, offered
reliable estimation of the copy numbers. A precise MAF was an
essential element, not only for the reﬁned calculation of allele-
speciﬁc copy numbers but also in decoding multiple CNA pat-
terns in complex genomic segments.

Taken together, we focused on the enzyme digestion-targeted
sequencing technique, RAD sequencing, and have demonstrated
that it is a new method for the characterization of CNAs that
provides reliable data for the inference of genomic copy num-
bers. It appears that there is a great potential for the application
of RAD sequencing to a variety of areas of research. In popu-
lation evolution research, and Genome-wide association studies
especially, extensive characterization of CNAs in numerous in-
dividuals is required to deﬁne the genetic variations among
populations.

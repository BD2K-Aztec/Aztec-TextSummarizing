ABSTRACT

Summary: BalestraWeb is an online server that allows users to in-
stantly make predictions about the potential occurrence of interactions
between any given drug—target pair, or predict the most likely inter-
action partners of any drug or target listed in the DrugBank. It also
permits users to identify most similar drugs or most similar targets
based on their interaction patterns. Outputs help to develop hypoth-
eses about drug repurposing as well as potential side effects.
Availability and implementation: BalestraWeb is accessible at http://
balestra.csb.pitt.edu/. The tool is built using a probabilistic matrix fac-
torization method and DrugBank v3, and the latent variable models are
trained using the GraphLab collaborative filtering toolkit. The server is
implemented using Python, Flask, NumPy and SciPy.

1 INTRODUCTION

Contemporary drug discovery faces important challenges: bring-
ing a new molecular entity to the market is estimated to cost
upward of 1.8 billion US$ (Paul at al., 2010), and the rate of
new drug discovery has steadily halved every 9 years for the past
60 years (Scannell et al., 2012). One of the common suggestions
brought forth to explain and remedy this trend is a paradigm
shift in drug discovery efforts from high-afﬁnity binding on a
single target toward modulation of cellular network states
through multiple interactions (Csermely et al., 2005, 2013;
Hopkins, 2008; Keskin et al., 2007; Korcsmaros et al., 2007;
Mencher and Wang, 2005; Zimmermann et al., 2007). The de-
velopment of computational methods that can efﬁciently assess
potential new interactions for drug repurposing thus became an
important goal in quantitative systems/network pharmacology
research.

We recently introduced a probabilistic matrix factorization
(PMF) method that can be applied to known drug—target inter-
action graphs for predicting new interactions (Cobanoglu et al.,
2013). Here, we introduce BalestraWeb, a Web server that has
been developed for allowing users to efﬁciently obtain results
from the PMF analysis, and assess the likelihood of interaction
between any drug—target pair.

2 METHOD

BalestraWeb is built by training a latent factor model, as described in our
previous work (Cobanoglu et al., 2013), on approved drugs and their
interactions data from DrugBank v3 (Knox et al., 2011). To build the
latent factor model, we use the GraphLab collaborative ﬁltering toolkit
implementation (Low 61 al., 2010). We mapped all the known names,
brand names and synonyms of the drugs and targets to the relevant
latent factor using a pre—computed hash table that allows constant time
access and enables maximal efﬁciency.

The server allows users to submit three types of queries: drug—target
interaction, drug—drug similarity and target—target similarity. In the
former case (Fig. l), the input is mapped to the corresponding drug
latent vector (LV) and target LV, and the dot product of these vectors
yields a score for the probabilistic occurrence of the queried drug—target
interaction. Alternatively, the user can enter a single type of input, either
a drug or a target. If a single drug is entered, the server retrieves the LV
for that drug and screens it against the entire set of LVs corresponding to
all targets, so as to identify known and newly predicted targets. Drug—
drug and target—target similarity queries provide information on drugs
(or targets) similar to the query drug (or target) based on the cosine
similarity of their LVs.

The output is an interactive graph (that can be downloaded in J SON
format) and a table displaying both the known drug—target interactions
for the query drug (target) and the top N predicted targets (drugs), rank-
ordered by their score. Users can select to view a second layer of inter-
actions beyond the immediate neighbors of the query drug/target in the
bipartite network of drugs and targets. The resulting subnet of inter-
actions thus provides a more complete picture of the investigated drug/
target in the context of the interactions of their known targets/drugs.

In addition to providing information on the distribution of scores in
general in the tutorial, we provide query-speciﬁc histograms in the output
ﬁles: the distribution of the predicted conﬁdence score (for each member
of the drug—target pairs) or the histogram of cosine similarities (for each
member of the drug—drug or target—target pairs). These histograms fa-
cilitate the interpretation of the speciﬁc score released for the query pair
in the context of the complete distribution of scores for the investigated
drug/target, and help make a better assessment of the signiﬁcance of the
outputted score.

3 DISTINCTIVE FEATURES

There are three important distinguishing features of
BalestraWeb: its ability to provide information on the likelihood
of interaction between any drug and any target; its reliance on
interaction proﬁles instead of chemical similarity; and its ability
to compare drugs with drugs and targets with targets. The widely
used similarity ensemble approach (SEA) (Keiser et al., 2007)
uses ligand similarity to identify new ligands based on chemical

Fig. 1. BalestraWeb architecture and underlying methodology. The user input (lower left) is mapped onto the latent factor vector(s) uivj (for targets),
learned by minimizing squared error regularized by Frobenius norm (see equation at top left). The output (right) contains a score R representative of
predicted interaction conﬁdence along with a graphical representation of the Close neighborhood of the query drug (Sunitinib) and/or query target
(SCN5A) in the drug-target association network, along with a table of known and predicted interactions. Similar features hold for drug-drug and target-

target similarity searches and outputs

similarity. STITCH (Kuhn et al., 2014) is an extensive repository
of protein and chemicals (1.07 billion interactions), including
predictions based on chemical similarities of compounds.
However, the interactions predicted by BalestraWeb are not
based on a particular chemical or genomic similarity method,
but on the assessment of comparable interaction patterns, and
as such they differ from, or complement, those predicted by SEA
or listed by STITCH.

4 CONCLUSION

BalestraWeb provides users the ability to predict the most likely
interaction partners of any drug or target beyond those known
and compiled in the DrugBank. The technology used to build the
Web server scales linearly with the number of drugs or targets
and is therefore easily scalable to larger datasets as they become
available. Our plan is to regularly update the underlying engine
and optimized parameters by using the newly released data. The
modular architecture of the software allows us to update the

Web server to reﬂect changes as new data become available.
Free, fast and easy-to-use BalestraWeb enables researchers to
help eliminate improbable drug—target interactions and efﬁ-
ciently focus their limited resources on selected drugs.

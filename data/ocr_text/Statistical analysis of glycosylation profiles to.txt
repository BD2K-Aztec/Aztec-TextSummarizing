ABSTRACT

Motivation: Glycosylation is one of the most important post-
translational modifications of proteins and explains some aspects of
the diversification of higher organisms not explained by template-
driven synthesis. For glycomics to mature as much as genomics
and proteomics, the necessary tools need to be developed and
tested. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is one of the gold
standards for oligosaccharide analysis and leads to large amounts
of data, not easily interpreted manually. We present a study on the
testing and validation of statistical analysis tools to aid the structural
elucidation of these analyses as well as using the results to answer
biologically relevant questions.

Results: We show the usefulness of data reduction and statistical
analysis in the interpretation of complex glycosylation data. The
reduction does not result in the loss of importance of the
glycosylation information as shown by comparison of control and
disease samples in two tissue types.

1 INTRODUCTION

Glycosylation is regarded as one of the most important co— and
post—translational protein modiﬁcations. There are two main types,
bonded to the nitrogen of an asparagine in the consensus sequence
Asn—X—Ser/T hr (N —linked) or to the oxygen of a serine/threonine,
with a favourable placed proline in the —1 or +3 position (0—linked).
Oligosaccharide attachment to protein sites explains some aspects
of the functional diversiﬁcation of higher organisms beyond the
template driven gene—encoded polypeptide synthesis. The role and
impact of glycosylation is complex and not very well understood
and many studies have provided proﬁles from glycosylated proteins
(glycome and/or glyco—proteome) highlighting a number of different
causative factors (Marino et al., 2010; Reis et al., 2010; Vigerust,
2011), e.g. underlying proteins, tissue location, disease state,
presence of pathogens, immune response system, etc. It is reasonable
to assume that changes in glycosylation are viable targets for
biomarker—based research projects (Packer et al., 2008).

Genomic and proteomic studies often make use of microarray data
to explain changes in phenotype, manifestation of a disease state or

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

to explain a certain biological pathway. These data are quite large,
with thousands of microscopic array spots being recorded. Statistical
methods have been developed to deal with the interpretation of
this type of data. Mass Spectrometry is a powerful technique in
the structural elucidation of glycans (An and Lebrilla, 2010), and
in particular, liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry (LC—MS)
which allows separation of isomeric structures (Novotny et al.,
2008). Glycome data from LC—MS can be data—rich and difﬁcult
to transform into useful ‘knowledge’, either analytical or biological.
Unlike the proteomic domain, oligosaccharide structural databases,
and the tools to interrogate them are still in their infancy (Campbell
et al., 2011; Hayes et al., 2011).

0—linked glycosylation is a major part of the structure of mucins
in the mucous and usually account for more than 50% of the mass
of the protein. As mucins mainly have a protective function on
epithelial surfaces as well as in secretions (e.g. stomach lining,
saliva; Amerongen et al., 1995; Corﬁeld et al., 2000) changes
in their glycosylation can be indicative of inﬂammation, lessened
lubrication, pathogen attack, etc. (Ohtsubo and Marth, 2006). Blood
group antigens are expressed on 0—linked structures, and the
presence or absence of the Sec fucosyltransferase (FUT2) determines
the secretor status of individuals (Sidebotham et al., 1995).

A data—set of published 0—linked oligosaccharide LC—MS data
from different tissue types and/or inﬂammatory disease states
(Table 1) was compiled to compare normal and inﬂammatory
glycosylation response in different tissues. By converting LC—MS
data into a mass spectrometry average composition (MSAC) metric
that describes each sample, statistical analysis could be simpliﬁed
and facilitate screening of large sets of sugar—data that would be
difﬁcult by manual interpretation. To achieve this for LC—MS data
each sample was reduced to a monosaccharide composition that
describes the normalized number of sugar residues and modiﬁcations
per glycan molecule. This method could also be applied to MALDI—
TOF data not taking isomers into consideration, or for glycopeptide
data as well as other types of glycosylation (e. g. N —linked,
glycosyaminoglycans etc). One advantage of reducing the data to
this type of metric is the elimination of misinterpretation of structure
due to re—arrangements (Wuhrer et al., 2011). Another advantage is
reducing the need for full structural elucidation of samples.

(co—author) and collaborators in Gothenburg University. Calculation of the
MSAC is presented in Supplementary Table Sl. LC—MS analysis data of
released sugars from the mucin fraction of different tissue types was collected
in similar manners and with similar interpretation of the structural data from
lung, saliva, cervix and colon. Control and disease samples were available for
lung and colon (Table 1). Salivary samples were differentiated into two main
mucins, MUC5B and MUC7, and cervix were classiﬁed into pre—, post— and
during ovulation. The secretor status of the cervix and salivary samples were
known. The monosaccharide compositions consisted of average numbers of
each of four residues, hexose (Hex), N—acetyl hexosamine (HexNAc), fucose
(Fuc), sialic acid (NeuAc) and a common modiﬁcation, sulfation (Sulf).

2.2 Monosaccharide compositional analysis

Output from data interpretation of a sample comprises a structurally
annotated list of mass to charge ratios (m / z) and intensities. Structures were
reduced to monosaccharide compositions of HexNAc, Hex, Fuc, NeuAc
and Sulf. The monosaccharide compositions were multiplied by percentage
intensity for each structure and then each parameter summed over the entire
sample to give the MSAC metric. An example of this calculation is given in
Supplementary Tables Slb and 3.

2.3 Heat plots

Cluster analysis was used as an exploratory tool to determine the groupings
in the dataset and Euclidean distance (L2 norm) was used as measure of
distance between observations. As the aim was to ﬁnd similar clusters, we
used hierarchical clustering with complete linkage. To avoid preferential
attention to variables with larger variance prior to clustering, all variables
were scaled to mean zero and unit variance. This also facilitated the graphical
representation of the dataset as heat maps. The heat maps depict the two—way
classiﬁcation of the observations (i.e. the plots are clustered on both x and y
axes).

2.4 Classiﬁcation methods

To assess the health status of patients as a function of MSAC, we built
classiﬁcation models based on linear discriminant analysis. Discriminant
function analysis helped in determining which variables discriminate

between the health statuses of the patient samples and offered a general
classiﬁcation matrix. The classiﬁcation matrix was based on leave—one—
out cross—validation. As a more subtle representation of the relationship
between MSAC and health status, predictive logistic regression models were
built. Due to the high degree of correlation between the monosaccharide
compositions, the odds ratios estimated from the full model with all
predictors included were unreliable. Thus, we proceeded with model
selection based on Akaike Information Criterion and Likelihood Ratio tests
(Bozdogan, 1987). The low number of predictors allowed a manual selection,
which in all cases yield the same result as automated stepwise regression.
Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was used as
an external validating tool. The value of AUC ranges between 0.5 (random
classiﬁcation) and 1 (perfect classiﬁcation). This was followed by the use
of non—parametric bootstrapping to estimate the variability associated with
AUC values.

2.5 Validation of statistical models

Cross—validation was carried out by iterations of model building using 90%
of the training set, and using the remaining 10% to test the outcomes. In this
procedure, error bars were close to zero (results not shown). All statistical
methods and scripts have been published (Hayes et al., 2012).

3 RESULTS

The main objective of this study was the identiﬁcation of statistical
tools that could be used to probe large datasets of oligosaccharide
LC—MS data to extract relevant biological evaluations that may not
have been easily achievable by manual interpretation. These tools
could also be used to identify patterns in the analytical data that
may help in structure determination as well as providing insight
into important biological events such as inﬂammation.

Fig. 2. Heat plot showing the healthy tissue types as categorized using
clustering methods. Five main clusters were observed which matched the
tissues. The rainbow coloured bar on the left distinguishes the actual
categories and points out the outliers in the groups, lung (red), saliva—MUC5B
(orange), saliva—MUC7 (yellow), cervix (green) and colon (blue). The heat
plot colours are from blue to red (—4.5 to +4.5) normalized to the column
mean. The dendogram to the left represents the hierarchical clustering of the
samples

3.1.] Data-set compilation and reduction The data—set was
compiled from different sources (Table 1) and reduced to MSAC
using the relative intensities and sequences of the solved structures
(Supplementary Table S2). Tissue samples included lung, saliva
(healthy MUC5B and MUC7), cervix (pre—, post— and during
ovulation) and colon. The monosaccharide compositions consisted
of average numbers of each of four residues (Hex, HexNAc, Fuc
and NeuAc) and one modiﬁcation (Sulf), repeated for all samples.
This reduces the contribution of individual variability due to blood
group ABO (Table 2) expression also known as secretor/non—secretor
status.

3.1.2 Diﬁ’erential analysis and clustering A heat plot was
constructed using the control dataset (Fig. 2). It shows the efﬁcient
separation of the samples into ﬁve groups by hierarchical clustering
(displayed as a dendogram to the left of the ﬁgure). Cluster 1 is
made up of lung samples characterized by low sialylation and high
sulfation. Cluster 2 is made up of 28 samples, 13 salivary MUC5B,
10 lung and 5 cervix (lower sulfation). Cluster 3 is made up of
salivary MUC7 samples (high sialylation). Cluster 4 is made up of
16 members, 1 lung sample, 4 salivary MUC5B, 2 salivary MUC7
and 9 cervix samples (intermediate level of sialylation). Cluster 5 is
made up of colon samples (short oligosaccharides).

Of the mixed tissue clusters, cluster 2 (mostly MUC5B) belongs
to secretor samples from cervix and saliva (one salivary non—
secretor). Additional lung samples in this cluster had a secretor—like
proﬁle (high in fucosylated structures), but appropriate data was
not available to determine the structures. We conclude that these
samples are similar to the secretor type proﬁles of the saliva and
cervix, allowing for less than 20% contamination of lung cells with
squamous (salivary) cells, (Schulz et al., 2007).

Most of the saliva and cervix in cluster 4 were non—secretors
and lung samples in this cluster had a non—secretor type proﬁle
(lack of fucose—containing structures). It has been shown that pre—
and post—ovulation cervix mucins contain less neutral fucosylated
structures (Andersch—Bjorkman et al., 2007) and more of the
NeuAca2,6GalNAc (Sialyl Tn) and NeuAca2,3Gal epitopes,

equivalent to a non—secretor type proﬁle, thereby explaining the
presence of the secretor cervix samples in this cluster.

The generalization, that clusters 1 and 2 are made up of blood—
group dependent glycosylation (secretors) and that clusters 3, 4 and
5 less so, is re—enforced by these ﬁndings. The heat plot (Fig. 2)
shows that clusters 1 and 2 are noteworthy by their lower than
average amount of NeuAc (blue) and higher than average for other
parameters (red). This is reversed in the other three clusters. These
data shows that there is both a glycosylation dependency due to
individual (secretor status) as well as tissue and protein variation,
and that the simpliﬁcation of the data into MSAC retains this
information.

3.2 Glycosylation in disease states versus
healthy: COLON

3.2.] Data-set reduction and clustering A typical mass spectrum
from one each of a control and inﬂammatory disease state (UC)
colon sample shows obvious structural differences between the two
(Fig. 3A and C). Data from these samples was used to construct a
heat plot (Fig. 4).

The analysis results in ﬁve clusters, healthy, UC and non—
characteristic proﬁles. Clusters 1 and 2 are composed of mainly
control—type colon patients. These proﬁles have high values for
HexNAc, Hex, Fuc and Squ with varying amounts of sialylation
(NeuAc). Clusters 3 and 5 are predominantly UC (1 out of the seven
members of group 5 is a control), showing a different proﬁle to
that of the control samples, i.e. low overall amounts of HexNAc,

(Larsson et al., 2009). There are varying amounts of NeuAc but on
average reduced amounts when compared to the controls. Cluster 4
is a mixture of both control and UC type proﬁles.

3.2.2 Building of probability models A generalized linear model
was used to build a probability curve based on the ﬁve parameters.
Univariate probability models were built using single parameter
data (Supplementary Fig. S1). The probabilities associated with
these models were plotted and used to deduce the composition of
structures with highest and lowest probability of disease (Table 3)
and the predicted structures agreed with typical structures deduced
from the mass proﬁle (Fig. 3B and D; Supplementary Table S4).

A likelihood ratio test was used to identify the model that best
represented the differences between the control and disease state for
the colon, with repeated rounds excluding that with the lowest AUC
value. The univariate model based on the Squ parameter gave the
best discrimination. AUC values for the model are given in Table 4.

3.2.3 Validation of probability model Cross—validation was
carried out by iterations of model building using 90% of the training
set, and using the remaining 10% to test the outcomes. Error bars
were close to zero (results not shown). The probabilities for the
colon healthy and colon UC samples are shown in Table 4.

Fig. 6. Heat plot showing the clustering of control versus cystic ﬁbrosis (CF)
lung data which produced four clusters, two representing each of the states.
Clusters 1 and 2 are made up of healthy and CF patients. Clusters 3 and 4
are mainly healthy and CF, respectively, with outliers in both. The heat plot
colours are from blue to red (—4 to +4) normalized to the column mean.
The samples are colour coded to indicate healthy (red) or CF (blue) state

3.3 Glycosylation in disease states versus
healthy: LUNG

A second study into disease and healthy state was conducted
using lung samples, control and cystic ﬁbrosis (CF; inﬂammatory).
Figure 5 shows representative mass spectra from a healthy and a CF
patient sample, indicating the differences in structural proﬁle of the
two.

Also shown are MS/MS of typical structures from these proﬁles
showing that the control lung samples show elongated structures
terminating with fucose and expressing blood—group type antigens
(Table 2) whereas the CF samples are shortened and terminated with
sialic acid. Heat plot analysis was performed (Fig. 6) and the samples
clustered into four clusters, two of each state. Cluster 1 (mainly
controls) has lower than average amounts of NeuAc and higher
than average values for the rest of the parameters and correspond
to cluster 1 of heat plot in Figure 2. Cluster 2 of the lung heat plot
contains CF patients. Cluster 3 and 4 are mainly controls and CF,
respectively, with outliers in both. Cluster 3 has seven members, two
of which are CF and cluster 4 has 13 members with three controls.
Cluster 3 contains controls that correspond to the samples found in
cluster 2 of the ﬁrst heat plot in Figure 2. It has been indicated that
CF samples have lower amounts of blood— group antigens. Therefore,
we can imagine that we are seeing a differentiation dependent on
blood grouping in this heat plot.

3.3.] Building of probability models Univariate probability
models (Supplementary Fig. S2) were constructed as before. All
parameters did well with NeuAc, Fuc and Squ scoring the highest.
As before probabilities were used to determine the oligosaccharide
composition of the structure that represents the extremes of the curve
(i.e. 100% probability of healthy or CF state; Tables 3 and 4). These
compositions match quite well with typical structures found in a
mass spectrometric proﬁle of the samples (Fig. 5).

Likelihood ratio test was used to identify the best combination of
variables to use in a probability model, resulting in the combination
of NeuAc and Squ being the best predictor of CF disease state
in the lung. AUC values for the model are given in Table 4. The
average probabilities for the healthy and CF lung samples are

tabulated in Table 4 showing that disease states were signiﬁcantly
different from the random score of 0.5. From the ROC curves of
the univariate probability models, we can identify the trends with
respect to each of the parameters (Supplementary Fig. S2). As has
been shown previously (Schulz et al., 2005) the levels of NeuAc
increase and the other parameters decrease with respect to disease
state. The univariate models give monosaccharide composition of an
extreme case control—like or CF—like glycosylation proﬁle (Table 3).
This shows that the overall length of the structure is halved in
CF (HexNAc and Hex), and that the number of fucose residues
is reduced 5—fold which could be indicative of loss of blood group
type antigens, as well as a change in core type.

3.3.2 Testing of probability model A test set of samples was used
to validate the probability model consisting of sub—mucosa] gland
(SMG) samples and human bronchial epithelial cell culture (HBE)
samples (Table 6). Average probabilities as calculated by the model
are presented in Table 6. Probability values were high for all samples,
indicating a CF—like rather than control—like proﬁle for all samples.

4 DISCUSSION

Glycosylation is recognized as an important post—translational
modiﬁcation involved in cell—cell recognition and communication
(Morelle and Michalski, 2005). Changes in glycosylation due to
inﬂammatory response (Mortier et al., 2011), can arise in a number
of different ways, i.e. biosynthetic alterations of transferases, donors,
acceptors or glycosidases; changes in protein expression or cellular
location (Lauc et al., 2010). De—coding these changes and their
contribution to the glyco—proﬁle of a sample will allow greater
understanding of the inﬂammatory response.

The MSAC metric allows the reduction of complicated data, but
in contrast to traditional monosaccharide compositional analysis,
there is a common baseline among the samples (Core HexNAc). An
example of the difference between the two methods of normalization
is given in Supplementary Table S3.

4.1 Glycosylation proﬁles in different tissue types

The control dataset has diverse origins, protein backbones and
glycosylation features (Fig. 1). The heat plot displays the efﬁcient
separation of the samples into ﬁve groups by hierarchical clustering
of a glycosylation—based metric (MSAC; Fig. 2), which corresponds
to groupings based on tissue type and/or mucin. The simplest of

these are the colon (MUC2; Larsson et al., 2009) and the two
salivary mucins (MUC7 and MUC5B; Thomsson et al., 2005).
The cervix and lung samples are made up of mixtures of different
mucins both containing predominantly MUC5B and to a lesser
extent MUC5AC (Karlsson and Thomsson, 2009; Schulz et al.,
2005; Thomsson et al., 2005). In the lung, MUC5B mainly originates
from the SMG showing a highly sialylated proﬁle, and MUC5AC
from the goblet cells. In healthy lung samples, SMG secretions
contribute an estimated 95% of upper airway mucous (Wine and
J00, 2004). Of these secretions, 40% are from mucous cells and
60% from serous cells, producing water, electrolytes and a rich
mixture of ‘anti’ compounds. The data shows increased sulfation
and decreased sialylation of the control lung samples indicating a
reduced contribution from SMG in the healthy state.

Salivary secretions show glycosylation of the individual mucin
entities as well as the contribution from the multiple cell types
(Bikker, 2004). Salivary MUC7 is one of the non—gel forming
mucins and does not display blood—group antigens as much as
MUC5B in saliva (Karlsson and Thomsson, 2009). In studies on
cervical mucous from different time points along the menstrual
cycle, amounts of MUC5B vary as does the glycosylation proﬁle
of the mucous (Andersch—Bjorkman et al., 2007) indicating a
contribution from proteins that are expressed and underlying
transferases involved in glycosylation. During ovulation, the mucous
glycosylation is comprised of more neutral fucosylated core 2—
type structures (more ‘secretor’ like) whereas in samples from
before and after ovulation the glycosylation is shortened (sialyl Tn
type structures) and highly sialylated. The change in glycosylation
appears to be limited to terminal structures and does not appear
to alter the underlying cores. Differential expression of C3GnT at
the Tn branching point of O—glycosylation biosynthesis determines
appearance of core 3 type structures. Presence of this transferase
would result in an increase of core 3 with a decrease in core
1 structures. We can hypothesize from this that a change in
glycosylation in this instance arises from a change in the regulation
of the transferases as opposed to a change in the actual transferases
that are expressed. This has been seen previously with the cellular
reorganization of GalNAc transferases that is mediated by the Src
tyrosine kinase. This protein causes the GalNAc transferase to
relocate from the Golgi to the ER. It has been hypothesized that
the GalNAc—T has a lectin domain which competes with the core
I gal transferase site blocking the extension of the T antigen (Gill
et al., 2010).

There are three homogenous clusters, showing mucins from
different tissues (Fig. 2) cluster 1 (lung), cluster 3 (salivary MUC7)
and cluster 5 (colon). These clusters have different mucin protein
backbones (Table 1). Clusters 3 and 5 are made up of single mucins,
i.e. salivary MUC7 and colonic MUC2. Cluster 1 is lung samples,
but these are made up of a mixture of mucins, MUC5B and 5AC.
Therefore, we can make the assumption that the glycosylation proﬁle
of the samples in these three clusters is dependent on both tissue and
protein.

The other two clusters are made up of mainly one type of sample
but with outliers from other groups. This may be due in part to
the secretor status of the samples. There is also a contribution from
the mixture of proteins that are found in these groups. Cluster 2
is mainly salivary MUC5B also found to be a constituent of lung
mucous. As there are differing proteins and glands that contribute
to the lung mucous, it is not surprising that there is more individual

Statistical analysis of glycosylation profiles

 

differences between samples and that a certain amount of ‘fuzziness’
exists between these samples and salivary MUC5B.

Cluster 4 is mainly made up of cervix samples. Again the mucous
constituents are a mixture of proteins, with similar to the lung
mucous, MUC5B and MUC5AC dominating but additional minor
contributions from MUC6 and MUC16. The positioning of cluster 4
is interesting as even if the underlying proteins are similar to those
in the lung and salivary MUC5B, the group is found in between
salivary MUC7 and colonic MUC2. This implies a similarity to the
non—blood group displaying mucins of these two groups and most
of these samples are indeed classiﬁed as non—secretors.

These results conﬁrm the three main contribution factors to
glycosylation proﬁles in healthy tissue types; (1) tissue location
and contributing glands, (2) the underlying apo—protein and (3)
expression of the glycosylation biosynthesis components.

4.2 Glycosylation in disease states versus healthy: colon

The next step was the investigation into differences due to disease
state within a tissue. We started with an established model, i.e. colon.
Glycosylation in the colon is conﬁned to one mucin and is quite
homogenous across samples with no blood group display. This is
thought to be due to pressure of natural selection of the intestinal
ﬂora (Larsson et al., 2009). The overall glycosylation proﬁle is one
of core 3 type structures with sialic acid on the C—six position of
the GalNAc. This is reduced to the sialyl Tn antigen (NeuAc—
GalNAc) in inﬂamed patients. There is hardly any expression of
the longer more complex structures as seen in the control samples.
The clustering yields three groups. Two clusters are clear in their
overall group proﬁle; cluster 1 is healthy and cluster 3 is disease
(UCa). The third cluster is a mixed proﬁle. However, on closer
examination, we can see that it can again be sub—divided into healthy
and disease proﬁles. Some clinical data was available for these
patients, but this did not yield any explanation as to why these
particular disease patients did not cluster together with the others in
cluster 3. The inactive ulcerative colitis patients (UCi, 14) and IBS
(non—inﬂammatory) were used to test the colon probability model.
Both of these subsets fell in the healthy probability range as deﬁned
by the sulfate ROC curve. This ﬁts with the previous ﬁndings that
the glycosylation proﬁle of patients in remission is similar to that of
control samples, and therefore the change in glyco—proﬁle is result
of the inﬂammation rather than a direct link to the disease state.

4.3 Glycosylation in disease states versus healthy: lung

The lung data (control and CF) showed that there is a correlated
change in glycosylation with disease state, as shown previously
(Schulz et al., 2007); exacerbated CF patients show an overall
decrease in Squ and Fuc and a concomitant increase in NeuAc.
This is clearly demonstrated in the heat plot. There are three
clusters, one healthy (cluster 1), one CF (cluster 3) and one mixed
proﬁle (cluster 2; Fig. 6). The move from healthy to CF is marked
by an overall increase in NeuAc and a decrease in all the other
parameters (clearly seen in the difference between clusters 1 and
3). The non—characteristic proﬁle group shows a reverse of this
trend for NeuAc; there seems to be an increase in the level of
this residue. In general, for the rest of the parameters, the overall
trend seems to follow that of 1 and 3. Interestingly, inﬂammatory
response is believe to be mediated by a number of different lectins
on the surface of leukocytes including siglecs (sialic acid—binding Ig

like lectins) and L—selectin, whose main targets are sialic acid and
sulfated/sialylated oligosaccharides, respectively. The probability
model that best describes the separation of the two groups (control
and CF) is based on the amounts of the both sialic acid and sulfation,
which is validated by the importance of these two variables in
the inﬂammation process. The present statistical analysis study
also shows a shortening of overall chain length (indicated by the
reduction in both Hex and HexNAc from the univariate probability
models; Table 3) in the inﬂamed versus control subjects. This
appears to be accompanied by a change from core 3/4 type structures
to core 2 type structures. This can be seen in the mass spectra proﬁle
but also from Table 3, where the decrease in HexNAc from healthy
to CF—type proﬁles is larger than that of Hex. A simple decrease in
chain length, or lactosamine units would mean an equal decrease in
both of these residues whereas the observed decrease in HexNAc is
2.5 compared to 1.5 for Hex. This indicates an altered expression
proﬁle of core 1 transferase and/or core 3 transferase (Schulz et al.,
2007) in inﬂamed lung that is subsequently turned into core 2 and
core 4 structures by the GlcNAc,81—6 transferase.

Subsets of data were used to test the probability model
(multivariate based on both NeuAc and sulfate). All of these
subsets placed their proﬁles closer to the sialylated disease state
rather than to the healthy state. This observation also includes the
SMG samples from CF and control patients. This implies that the
difference between disease and non—disease state in CF may be partly
explained by an increase in sialylated mucin contribution to the
sputum from this gland. Included also in the subset were human
bronchial epithelial cells both disease and non—disease state, again
both classiﬁed as closer to the disease proﬁle by our probability
model. We hypothesize that by their very nature cells are in a ‘wound’
like state and this may explain why the control cells also seem to
have inﬂammatory—type glycosylation.

Overall, we believe that the use of statistics such as these
presented here are the next step in understanding the complicated
mechanism of inﬂammatory cause and effect in relation to
glycosylation. These tools are particularly useful when large datasets
are available and need to be reduced to gain biological insight. Future
work will include applying these statistics to other types of sugar
data (i.e. N —linked) as well as the use of data with more structural
information.

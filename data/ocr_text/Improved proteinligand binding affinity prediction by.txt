ABSTRACT

Motivation: Hydrophobic effect plays a pivotal role in most protein—
ligand binding. State-of—the-art protein—ligand scoring methods usually
treat hydrophobic free energy as surface tension, which is proportional
to interfacial surface area for simplicity and efficiency. However, this
treatment ignores the role of molecular shape, which has been found
very important by either experimental or theoretical studies.

Results: We propose a new empirical scoring function, named
Cyscore. Cyscore improves the prediction accuracy by using a
novel curvature-dependent surface-area model, which is able to dis-
tinguish convex, planar and concave surface in hydrophobic free
energy calculation. Benchmark tests show that this model significantly
improves the protein—ligand scoring and Cyscore outperforms a var-
iety of well established scoring functions using PDBbind benchmark
sets for binding affinity correlation and ranking tests. We expect the
curvature-dependent surface-area model and Cyscore would contrib-
ute to the study of protein—ligand interactions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Scoring functions are approximate computational methods
for predicting the binding afﬁnity of two docked molecules,
especially, a protein and a ligand. They are widely used in struc-
ture-based drug discovery and other molecular modeling appli-
cations, including virtual screening, de novo drug design and lead
optimization (Blundell, 1996; Kuntz, 1992). In the past several
decades, a variety of scoring functions have been developed. In
general, they can be classiﬁed into three types, force-ﬁeld-based
(Ewing et al., 2001; Morris et al., 1996), knowledge-based
(Gohlke et al., 2000; Mooij and Verdonk, 2005; Muegge and
Martin, 1999; Velec et al., 2005; Zhou and Skolnick, 2011) and
empirical scoring functions (Eldridge et al., 1997; Friesner et al.,
2004; Koes et al., 2013; Korb et al., 2009; Tang and Marshall,
2011; Wang et al., 2002). F orce-ﬁeld-based scoring functions are
derived from ﬁrst principle, which employs classical force ﬁelds
to compute the direct interaction energies, e.g. van der Waals and

electrostatic energies, between the ligand and its target protein.
Sometimes these methods are combined with GB/SA or PB/ SA
methods to address the solvation effect (Liu and Zou, 2006;
Moustakas et al., 2006; Shoichet et al., 1999; Wei et al., 2002).
Knowledge-based scoring functions are derived from statistical
potentials, which predict the binding free energy using the prob-
abilities of ﬁnding atom pairs at a given distance between pro-
teins and ligands. They have obtained a high level of prediction
accuracy according to some recent studies (Ballester and
Mitchell, 2010; Huang and Zou, 2010; Zhang et al., 2005;
Zheng and Merz, 2013). However, knowledge-based scoring
functions usually require large numbers of terms which are
prone to over ﬁtting by training, and can hardly provide imme-
diate physical interpretation of results. Those weak points limit
their applications. Empirical scoring functions incorporate the
advantages of both force-ﬁeld—based and knowledge-based scor-
ing functions. They calculate the overall binding free energy as a
sum of several physically meaningful terms, while their coefﬁ-
cients are derived from the regression analysis on experimental
data. As they can achieve comparably accurate prediction and
provide physical insights of protein—ligand binding as well,
empirical scoring functions are widely used in structure-based
drug-design applications.

In this article, we propose a new empirical scoring function,
named Cyscore. It is composed of hydrophobic free energy, van
der Waals interaction energy, hydrogen bond interaction energy
and ligand’s conformational entropy. We mainly focus on im-
proving the prediction of hydrophobic free energy, because it is
regarded to be dominant in most protein—ligand binding (Ball,
2007; Blokzijl and Engberts, 1993; Chandler, 2005; Meyer et al.,
2003; Setny et al., 2009; Snyder et al., 2011; Southall et al., 2001).
Hydrophobic effect is the observed tendency of nonpolar sur-
faces to association in an aqueous solution. Many theoretical
approaches have been proposed to study its mechanism, such
as ‘iceberg’ model (Frank and Evans, 1945; Kauzmann, 1959;
Tanford, 1979), scaled-particle theory based ‘void volume’
models (Graziano and Lee, 2003; Lum et al., 1999; Pratt and
Chandler, 1977; Stillinger, 1973). Both experimental and theor-
etical studies have pointed out that hydrophobic effect depends
not only on surface area, but also on shape (Cheng and Rossky,
1998; Fennell et al., 2010; Rajamani et al., 2005; Southall et al.,
2001). In the conventional protein—ligand scoring methods,
hydrophobic free energy is usually treated as surface tension,
which is proportional to interfacial surface area for simplicity
and efﬁciency. Obviously, this treatment ignores the role of mo-
lecular shape and hinders the more accurate prediction

Improved protein-ligand binding afﬁnity prediction with Cyscore

 

of hydrophobic free energy. Inspired by the thermodynamic
research of Tolman (1949) and the pioneer work of Nicholls
et al. (1991; Sharp et al., 1991), we took curvature as the descrip-
tor of shape and proposed a novel curvature-dependent surface-
area model. Our analyses demonstrate that this model is superior
to the conventional surface-area model signiﬁcantly in protein—
ligand scoring. Compared to a variety of well-established scoring
functions, it achieves the top performance using the well known
PDBbind benchmark sets (Cheng et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2004,
2005). The methods and results will be elaborated in the follow-
ing sections.

2 METHODS

2.1 Scoring functions

We assume that the overall protein—ligand binding free energy can be
decomposed into four terms:

A Gbind = kh A Ghydrophobic + kv A Gvdw + kb A Ghbond + ke A Gentropy )

AGhydrophobic is the change of hydrophobic free energy from the free-
state to the bound-state of the protein and ligand:

AGhydrophobic = Geomplex _ Gprotein _ Gligand, 

where Geomplex, Gprotein and Gﬁgand are the hydrophobic free energies of
protein—ligand complex, individual protein and ligand in the solvent, re-
spectively. Hydrophobic free energy is computed as the integration of

on the solvent accessible surface (S) and calculating the square ratio of
sphere volume (Vsphere) to volume out of the solvent accessible surface
(Vout) (Fig. 1). Thus the convex, planar and concave surfaces are different
in hydrophobic free energy prediction. The radius of the sphere is set to
be 1.215; according to the derivation of our model (Supplementary
Material). The atom radii are from Chothia’s (1976) work. To obtain
the square ratio numerically, we ﬁrst generate a set of points to represent
the solvent accessible surface using the method developed by Shrake and
Rupley (1973). Each of these points represents an integral element of
surface area. Then we place all the points into a grid of 0.1151 spacing
and compute the sphere volumes at each point by accumulating the grid
volume. Finally we summarize all the products of square ratio and the
surface element area. As the curvature factor requires a time consuming
computation, we implemented the k-discrete oriented polytopes
(k-DOPs) method to detect the overlap of spheres in this program for
fast computation (Klosowski ei al., 1998).

by the solvent accessible surface represents a molecule, which is the pro-
tein or ligand. Dark grey region represents the volume of the sphere out
of the solvent accessible surface (Vow). Light grey region represents the
volume of the sphere buried in the solvent accessible surface (Vsphere—
Vout). Vout can be a descriptor for the concave and convex surface

ignored in the calculation because their position is dependent on the
methods of adding hydrogen and may result in atom clashes.

AGhbond accounts for the hydro gen-bond interaction between the pro-
tein and ligand. It was adapted from that of Grid (Goodford, 1985):

protein ligand C D 4
AGhbond= Z Z 76—? COS 9 (5)

where rij is the distance between heavy atoms of protein atom i and ligand
atom j, 0 is the angle formed by the donor atom, hydrogen and acceptor
atom (Supplementary Fig. S2). If 0 < 90°, the hydrogen bond energy for
the pair of atoms is set to be 0. C and D are the parameters obtained from
Goodford’ (1985) work.

AGentropy accounts for the entropic loss effect of ligands upon binding
process. We employed the classic method of counting the number of
rotatable bonds (rotors). It is based on the assumption that each rotor
in the unbound state associates with a discrete number of low-energy
conformations but ‘freezes’ into a single conformation upon binding.
Thus the number of rotatable bonds is proportional to a certain
amount of conformational entropy (Bohm, 1994; Friesner ei al., 2004;
Salaniwal ei al., 2007).

kh, kv, kb and ke are the coefﬁcients of each term. They are obtained by
the standard least-square multivariate linear regression of the training set
(kh = —0.0082, k, = —0.069, kb 2 —0.0028, ke = —0.042).

In the following tests, we quantiﬁed the prediction accuracy through
Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (R) and standard deviation (SD), which
are the commonly used criterion for binding afﬁnity prediction (Huang
ei al. 2010).

2.2 Datasets

We divided the datasets into a training set and two benchmark sets. They
were selected from the database of PDBbind Wang ei al., 2004, 2005),
which collects the experimentally measured binding afﬁnity data for all
the biomolecular complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

The training set is used to obtain the coefﬁcients before each term by
linear regression. It was selected from the latest version (V2012) of
PDBbind using the following criteria: (i) structure resolution < 1.8151,
(ii) binding afﬁnity covers the range from 1 to 11 kcal/mol. Each complex

was double checked to ensure that its binding data was convincing and
(iii) protein—ligand data should be different from the benchmark data. We
checked the protein sequence similarity and ligand chemical composition
of the complexes (protein sequence similarity should be <90% or ligands
should be different in chemical formula). Thus there is no complex in the
training set whose protein and ligand are the same as that in the bench-
mark data. Finally we obtained 247 protein—ligand data which can be
found in Supplementary Table S1.

The benchmark sets are two ‘core set’ of PDBbind: the latest version
(V2012) and a most widely used version (V2007). The ‘core set’ was se-
lected by the author of PDBbind, which was aim to provide a set of high
quality, non-redundant data with special focus on the diversity of struc-
tures and binding data. The two sets contains 201 (V2012) and 195
(V2007) protein—ligand data, respectively. Moreover, they can be clustered
into 67 and 65 groups, each of which contains a high-afﬁnity ligand, a
medium-afﬁnity ligand, and a low-afﬁnity ligand bound to a common
protein (Cheng ei al., 2009). The clustering of protein—ligand data can be
used to test the ability to rank different ligands bound to the same protein
when the correct binding poses of these ligands are known. The overlaps
of the two benchmark sets are ~30%.

2.3 Software availability

Cyscore is implemented in C++ and has been complied on Linux system.
It is now freely available to non-commercial users at http://clab.labshare.
cn/software/cyscore.html. Valid input ﬁle formats are PDB for proteins
and Tripos M012 for ligands. Typically this software is able to process
around 4000 ligand molecules for a given protein target per hour on an
Intel CoreTM processor (3.0 GHz) using one CPU core.

3 RESULTS

In this section, we ﬁrst give an overview of Cyscore. Then we
investigate how the curvature-dependent surface-area model is
superior to the conventional models in scoring protein—ligand
interactions. Finally, to gain an overall performance of
Cyscore, we compare it to a variety of well-established scoring
functions using PDBbind benchmarks.

3.1 Overview of Cyscore

Cyscore is an empirical protein—ligand scoring function, com-
posed of hydrophobic free energy, van der Waals interaction
energy, hydrogen-bond interaction energy and the ligand’s con-
formational entropy. Those terms follow the classic approaches
except the hydrophobic free energy. Conventionally, hydropho-
bic free energy is treated as a form of surface tension by many
researches (Sinanoglu, 1981; Tanford, 1979). Thus hydrophobic
free energy is measured by the surface area of a molecule, includ-
ing solvent accessible surface area, molecular surface area or
some approximate methods such as atom contact numbers
(Petrey and Honig, 2000). However, a thermodynamic research
of Tolman (1949) shows that microscopic surface tension not
only associates with surface area but also with curvature, that is:

ﬂ_1

y(oo) _ 1 + 28/R’ (6)

where y(R) is the surface tension of spherical particle of radius R,
y(oo) is the macroscopic surface tension and 8 is a constant.
This equation in principle provides a means of obtaining the
curvature-dependent hydrophobic free energy, but it is only ap-
plicable to spherical interfacial geometries. In order to derive a

 

Fig. 2. An example for the distance sensitivity of Nicholls’ model.
Supposing for a protein, the experimentally determined or predicted
structure (solid line in A but dash line in B) is slightly different from
the real structure (solid line in B). To determine the curvature of the
surface, a sphere is centered at the point 0. Although the two structures
are almost the same, the exposed surfaces (dark gray in A and B) of the
sphere are quite different, resulting in the inaccurate value of curvature

well-deﬁned model, Nicholls et al. (1991) developed a curvature-
corrected surface-area model, which calculates the curvature
factor at the points distributed over the accessible surface of a
molecule. The hydrophobic free energy is:

G = woo) Z Sici. (7)
where S,- is the area of the surface element, and c,- is the curvature
factor associated with Si. To determine 0,, they place a sphere,
centering at each sample point of the solvent accessible surface,
and calculate the fraction of sphere surface lies in the molecular
2Sinner

sphere
face area of the sphere buried in the molecular solvent accessible
surface, and Ssphere is the total surface area. In the planar surface,
Ci: 1.0, which means that Equation (7) is equal to the conven-
tional surface-area model. In the concave region, c,- > 1.0, which
indicates a higher hydrophobic free energy, while in the convex
region, vice versa. Originally, this model was used in analyzing
hydrophobic effects in protein folding and association, etc. We
tried to apply it to protein—ligand binding afﬁnity scoring.
However, it fails to show any improvements in our benchmark
tests (Section 3.2). After a careful analysis, we found a possible
reason is that c,- is too sensitive to the judgment on whether a
surface element of the sphere lies in or out of the molecular
solvent accessible surface. In other words, if a protein structure
is not so precisely determined, the minor difference in structure
may lead to incorrect value of Sinner. As illustrated in Figure 2,
the real protein surface and the experimentally determined or
predicted protein surface are almost the same but the values of
buried surface area of the sphere centering at point O have great
difference (dark grey region). In the case of protein—ligand scor-
ing, this weak point is ampliﬁed because many of the atom dis-
tances in the binding pockets are around the size of a sphere, and
thus errors will be accumulated, leading to bad scoring.

Inspired by the work of Nicholls et al. (1991), we developed a
new curvature-dependent surface-area model using the sphere
volume, instead of area, to evaluate the surface curvature. Our
curvature factor is deﬁned as the square ratio of sphere volume
to the volume out of the molecular solvent accessible surface
[Fig. 1 and Equation (3)]:

The use of volume can avoid the sensitivity in determining the
buried or exposed surface area simply by the sphere radius.
Moreover, derived from our geometry analysis, this factor is
an approximate form of Tolman’s Equation (6), which indicates
the physical meaning of our model (Supplementary Material).
We expected this new approach could provide robust estimation
of surface curvature and contribute to protein—ligand binding
afﬁnity scoring.

3.2 Curvature-dependent surface-area model contributes
to protein—ligand binding afﬁnity prediction

To investigate the effectiveness of the new curvature-dependent
surface-area model, we combined it with the van der Waals inter-
action energy, hydrogen-bond interaction energy and ligand’s en-
tropic term, which are deﬁned in Section 2.1. This new scoring
function is called Cyscore. For comparison, we replaced the
curvature-dependent surface-area model of Cyscore by Nicholls’
model [Equation (7)] and conventional surface-area model
(hydrophobic free energy is proportional to the solvent accessible
surface area), respectively. These two new scoring functions were
named N— and S—score for short. Coefﬁcients before each term of
the three scoring functions are obtained from the training set using
linear regression method individually. Then the three scoring
functions were tested on the benchmark sets of PDBbind version
2007 and 2012 (Section 2.2). Results show that Cyscore achieves
the highest Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient in both sets, which is
~7—11% higher than the N— or S—score (Fig. 3A and B and
Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The correlation ﬁgures illus-
trate that our curvature-dependent surface-area model obviously
improves prediction in low and medium afﬁnity ligands (Fig. 4). A
detailed analysis on individual testing data shows that Cyscore
performs better in case of ligands binding in narrow pockets.

binding pocket is deep but the interfacial surface is relatively
small. Both N— and S—score underestimate their afﬁnity except
Cyscore which predicts much lower hydrophobic free energy. It
is because the average curvature factor in this pocket weights 1.6
times higher than that at planar surface.

In the above test, Cyscore exhibits advantages in protein—
ligand scoring. To more precisely identify the performance of
the curvature-dependent surface-area model, we excluded the
van der Waals interaction energy and hydrogen bond interaction
terms from the scoring functions, as these contact-dependent
terms may have overlaps with the hydrophobic term. Thus the
three scoring functions are composed of only hydrophobic free
energy and ligand’s entropic terms (Their sufﬁxes were set to be
2, as Cyscore2, N—score2 and S-score2 for short). We obtained
the results by performing the same training and testing process
as before. As illustrated in Figure 3C and D, Supplementary
Tables S4 and S5, although those two-term scoring functions
shows 7~15% decrease of the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients,
Cyscore2 still performs the best in both sets, while N—score2
shows ~7% decrease compared to S-score2. This result implies
that our curvature-dependent surface-area model contributes to
protein—ligand scoring indeed.

3.3 Comparison of Cyscore with the well-established
protein—ligand scoring functions

To gain an overall performance of Cyscore, we further compared
it with a wide collection of scoring functions. Thank Cheng et al.,

who carefully selected a high-quality-benchmark set (PDBbind
core set V2007) and assessed 16 well-known scoring functions,
including ﬁve scoring functions [LigScore (Krammer et al.,
2005), PLP (Gehlhaar et al., 1995), PMF (Muegge, 2006;
Muegge and Martin, 1999), Jain (Jain, 1996), LUDI (Bohm,

scoring functions (D-Score, PMF-Score, G—Score, ChemScore,
F -Score) in the SYBYL software version 7.2, one scoring func-
tion [GlideScore (Friesner et al., 2004, 2006)] in the Schrédinger
software version 8.0, three scoring functions [GoldScore,
ChemScore (Eldridge et al., 1997), ASP (Mooij and Verdonk,
2005)] in the GOLD software version 3.2, two stand-alone scor-
ing functions [DrugScore (Gohlke et al., 2000; Velec et al., 2005)
and X-Score WVang et al., 2002)] released by academic groups.
We can use Cyscore against the same benchmark set for a fair
comparison. The test results for the 17 scoring functions are
shown in Table 1. In terms of the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁ-
cients (R) and the standard deviation (SD), Cyscore outperforms
all of the tested scoring functions on this benchmark test.
Moreover, we followed their newly deﬁned ‘ranking power’
test, which benchmarks the ability to correctly rank the known
ligands bound to a common target protein when native binding
modes are known (Cheng et al., 2009). Cheng et al. divide the
above data set into 65 groups of protein—ligand complexes, each
of which contains a high-afﬁnity ligand, a medium-afﬁnity ligand
and a low-afﬁnity ligand bound to a common protein. Scoring
functions are evaluated by the success rate which counts for the
ratio of correctly ranked groups in all the test groups. This test
examines the ability of a scoring function to discriminate the

structure changes of ligands, which is relevant to lead optimiza-
tion and virtual screening studies because their aim is to rank
molecules in the order of their binding afﬁnities to the target
protein. As shown in Table 2. Cyscore achieves a 53.8% success
rate, which ranks the second best among the scoring functions.

Further more, we did another benchmark test using the most
recent updated set of PDBbind (core set, version 2012). For
comparison, two freely available stand-alone scoring functions
are used, that are, X-Score (version 1.3) and DSX (DrugScore
eXtended, a new improvement of DrugScore) (Neudert and
Klebe, 2011). Their performances are among the top-scoring
functions according to the above tests. Our results show that,
the correlation coefﬁcient of Cyscore is 0.630, while the values of
other two scoring functions are less than 0.600 (Table 3, correl-
ation Supplementary Fig. S4), and the success rate of Cyscore
achieves 56.7% in ‘ranking power’ test, better than the other two
scoring functions (Table 4). These results indicate that Cyscore
has considerable and consistent performance.

The above benchmark tests illustrate the ability of scoring
functions to evaluate binding afﬁnities of diverse protein—
ligand complexes. Generally, the inaccurate prediction of solv-
ation energies and conﬁgurational entropies are the major limi-
tations of present scoring functions (Cheng et al., 2009; Huang
et al., 2010). Compared to other empirical scoring functions,
such as X-Score, ChemScore, PLP, LUDI, LigScore and Jain,
Cyscore has the similar or even simpler terms in composition.
The main difference is in the method of calculating hydrophobic
free energy, which is one of the main components of solvation
energy. For example, X-Score implemented three types of hydro-
phobic terms, which were the conventional surface model, atom
contact number based term and atom type-dependent contact
term WVang et al., 2002). All the three methods ignored the ef-
fects of surface curvature on hydrophobicity. It is also a draw-
back of the solvation energy terms in most force-ﬁeld-based

scoring functions. As for the knowledge-based scoring functions,
the curvature information may be obtained by the inverse
Boltzmann relation, but the effectiveness is still practically un-
known because it relates to the extension of pairwise potentials to
many-body potentials (Huang et al., 2010). Taken together, the
encouraging performance of Cyscore suggests the signiﬁcance of
our work on designing the better algorithm for hydrophobic free
energy.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The hydrophobic effect plays a central role in bio-molecular rec-
ognition. It is estimated to provide, perhaps, 75% of the free
energy of most binding or association events (Snyder et al.,
2013). Despite its importance, calculating hydrophobic energy
is far from accuracy due to its complex origin in nature. In this
article, we proposed a curvature-dependent surface-area model
to estimate hydrophobic energy in protein—ligand binding.
Compared to the conventional surface-area model, the new
model is not only theoretically more exact, but also particularly
more effective in the benchmark tests. Based on this discovery,
we developed a new empirical protein—ligand scoring function,
named Cyscore. In terms of binding afﬁnity correlation, Cyscore
outperforms a variety of well-established scoring functions in our
tests. Of note, Cyscore performs better for ligands binding in
narrow pockets, due to their larger contribution of the curvature
factor to hydrophobic free energy. To our knowledge, the curva-
ture-dependent surface tension has not been explicitly analyzed
and taken into consideration in most of the state-of-the-art scor-
ing functions. Thus, we believe our model will be useful to the
study of protein—ligand interactions. In practice, Cyscore can be
used in the molecular modeling applications whose accurate
binding positions are accessible, such as lead optimization,

binding-mode prediction (see additional experiments in
Supplementary Table S6) and drug-resistant mutation predic-
tion. It should be mentioned that, Cyscore has not been opti-
mized for virtual screening, which strongly depends on the
particular docking method.

In the present article, we mainly focus on identifying whether
and how much the curvature-dependent surface-area model con-
tributes to the protein—ligand binding afﬁnity scoring. And in
order to reduce the risk of overtraining, the composition of
Cyscore is relatively simple in contrast to some other scoring
functions. This limits the accuracy and universal applicability
of Cyscore. For example, Cyscore does not count the water
mediated protein—ligand interaction, the charge—charge inter-
action and the Jr—system interaction. Moreover, the calculation
of entropy is a complex task. For simplicity and efﬁciency,
Cyscore just counts the number of rotatable bonds of ligands
to evaluate the entropy loss. In the future, we plan to adopt
more detailed terms and larger training sets to achieve more ac-
curate and general predictions of the protein—ligand binding
afﬁnity.

INTRODUCTION

The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special
Interest Group (AF P-SIG) is to coalesce the community of com-
putational biologists, experimental biologists and biocurators
who are addressing the challenge of protein function prediction,
thereby sharing ideas and creating collaborations. The AF P-SIG
holds annual meetings alongside the Intelligent Systems for
Molecular Biology, the leading conference of the International
Society for Computational Biology. The AFP—SIG also runs the
ongoing Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA)
challenge (Radivojac et al., 2013).

ABOUT THE CAFA CHALLENGE
The problem

There are many proteins in databases for which the sequence is
known but the function is not known. The gap between what we
know and what we do not know is growing. A major challenge in
the ﬁeld of bioinformatics is to predict the role that proteins play
in biological processes and disease and the mechanism by which
these functions are performed. As the community develops novel
algorithms to address this task, it is important that we are able to
assess how well each of these function prediction algorithms per-
forms under certain contexts.

A solution

CAFA is a challenge designed to provide a large-scale assessment
of the computational methods dedicated to predicting protein
function by comparing community predictions with experimental
associations that accumulate over time. Brieﬂy, the CAFA or-
ganizers release a large number of protein sequences to the com-
munity (>100 000 in CAF A 2). The participants then predict the
function of these proteins by associating them with Gene
Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2001) terms or (new in 2013)
Human Phenotype Ontology terms (Robinson et al., 2008).

Following the prediction deadline, a 36-month interval between
the submission and assessment times allows some proteins to
acquire new experimental annotations. These proteins comprise
the benchmark used to assess the ‘blind’ predictions made by the
participating groups.

DISCUSSIONS IN AUTOMATED FUNCTION
PREDICTION 2013

Automated Function Prediction (AFP) 2013 consisted of a series
of invited talks and competitively selected presentations and pos-
ters from extended abstracts submitted by participants. Keynote
speakers invited this year were Alex Bateman from the European
Bioinformatics Institute; Patricia Babbitt from the University of
California, San Francisco; Keith Dunker from Indiana
University; and Anna Tramontano from the University of
Rome, ‘La Sapienza’.

Alex Bateman discussed Pfam (Punta et al., 2012), a database
of protein function families of which he was a founder, and
UniProt (The UniProt Consortium, 2013), the leading protein
sequence database. Speciﬁcally, he discussed the uses and
misuses of Pfam as a touchstone for the prediction of protein
function, and the convoluted relationships between evolutionary
relatedness and functional similarity.

Patricia Babbitt described how her research uses protein
similarity networks to investigate protein function particularly
for classiﬁcation in the Structure Function Linkage Database,
which uses automated clustering via similarity networks to ini-
tially group enzyme superfamilies. This is followed by manual
analysis of functional residues to reﬁne the classiﬁcation of
subfamilies.

Keith Dunker discussed functional aspects of intrinsically dis-
ordered proteins. He highlighted that many disordered proteins
currently lack functional annotation and questioned if their func-
tions are even catalogued in ontologies such as GO. Where an-
notations are known, he discussed how ordered protein functions
are typically related to catalysis, membrane transport and small
molecule transport, whereas disordered proteins are more likely
to have functions relevant to signaling, regulation, recognition
and control. The basic idea being that structured proteins do
things and disordered proteins regulate the things that ordered

proteins do. He also discussed how disorder leads to tissue-
speciﬁc gene expression and enables rewiring of protein—protein
interaction networks in different cellular compartments.

Anna Tramontano discussed her experiences as an organizer
of the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction
(CASP) (Moult et al., 2013). CASP is one of the oldest critical
assessment challenges in bioinformatics, established to under-
stand and improve protein structure prediction programs. Prof.
Tramontano has been prominent in this ﬁeld for many years,
and has also assessed method performance in several CASP
meetings. She related her experience in CASP as an assessor,
the person who scores the methods based on their performance
using various metrics, and provided insights for future rounds of
CAFA.

Predrag Radivojac and Sean Mooney discussed lessons
learned from the previous CAF A challenge that took place
during 2010—201 1, and unveiled the upcoming CAFA 2 experi-
ment. CAFA 2 extends on CAFA1 by adding the Cellular
Component and Human Phenotype Ontologies to the set previ-
ously used for predicting function. A new challenge in CAF A 2 is
the prediction of new functions for proteins that already have
some (incomplete) functional annotation to assess whether par-
tial knowledge about a protein’s function can be successfully
used to computationally predict the missing annotation.

Other interesting discussions during the meeting included a
talk from Christos Ouzounis (University of Toronto, Canada,
and the Institute of Applied Biosciences, Thessalonica, Greece)
entitled ‘We still haz a job: genome annotashuns’, which dis-
cussed the problems associated with error propagation within
databases. Using the example of a typographical error ‘putaive’
(instead of ‘putative’), he demonstrated how this is a problem for
functional annotation, as there are 94 proteins with this annota-
tion in the NCBI protein database with many of these proteins
being homologs. Rachael Huntley from European Molecular
Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute
(EMBL-EBI), UK, discussed common misconceptions asso-
ciated with G0. She highlighted how GO annotations should
be used and many of the useful features available including
inter-ontology links and taxon-speciﬁc GO terms.

AWARDS

In 2013, awards were given for the ﬁrst time for best poster and
talk. Noah Youngs from New York University received the Best
Talk award for his presentation: ‘Negative Example Selection in
Protein Function Prediction’. Noah proposed that negative an-
notations should be assigned to proteins by looking for GO
terms that are unlikely to co-occur, and that these can be used
to provide negative examples for training sets. Runner-up for
best talk award was Joachim Bargsten from Wageningen
University, The Netherlands, who discussed ‘Integrated
Network- and Sequence-based Protein Function Prediction
Across the Plant Kingdom’.

Nives Skunca from Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
(ETH) Zurich received the Best Poster award for her poster
entitled ‘Assessing protein function predictions in light of the

Open World Assumption’. Her work focused on how false-posi-
tive predictions cannot be conﬁrmed, as predictions that are as-
sessed as false-positive results at one time point may be found to
be correct later on. Runner-up for the best poster award was
Romain Studer from University College London who discussed
‘Identiﬁcation of functional sites in protein structures by combin-
ing evolutionary and physical features’.

In summary, the AFP-SIG 2013 provided a venue for exten-
sive discussion of function prediction ranging across new meth-
ods, assessments by CAFA, issues with such assessments and the
universal resources that are widely used by the ﬁeld including the
UniProt and Pfam databases and GO. AFP-SIG 2014 will take
place before Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology in Boston
in July 2014, and will feature the results of CAFA 2 in addition
to the many areas relevant to function prediction.

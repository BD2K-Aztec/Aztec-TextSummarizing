ABSTRACT

Summary: MASS is a command-line program to perform meta-ana-
lysis of sequencing studies by combining the score statistics from
multiple studies. It implements three types of multivariate tests that
encompass all commonly used association tests for rare variants. The
input files can be generated from the accompanying software SCORE-
Seq. This bundle of programs allows analysis of large sequencing
studies in a time and memory efficient manner.

Availability and implementation: MASS and SCORE-Seq, including
documentations and executables, are available at http://dlin.web.unc.

1 INTRODUCTION

Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has
led to the discoveries of common genetic variants for virtually
every complex human disease. Recent advances in sequencing
technologies have made it possible to extend association studies
to rare variants. Because larger sample sizes are required to
detect rare variants than common variants (with similar effect
sizes), combining evidence from many sources is necessary for
sequencing studies. For ethical and logistical reasons, it is
strongly preferable to gather summary statistics than collecting
original data.

For association testing with rare variants, it is customary to
aggregate information across several variant sites within a gene
to enrich association signals and to reduce the penalty of multiple
testing. The simplest approach is the burden test, which creates a
burden score for each subject (by taking a weighted linear com-
bination of the mutation counts within a gene or indicating
whether there is any mutation within a gene) (Li and Leal,
2008; Lin and Tang, 2011; Madsen and Browning, 2009; Price
et al., 2010). A second approach is the variable threshold (VT)
test, which performs a burden test for variants with minor allele
frequencies (MAFs) below a certain threshold and minimizes the
P—value over the observed MAF thresholds (Lin and Tang, 2011;
Price et al., 2010). A third approach is the variance-component
test, which is aimed at detecting variants with opposite effects
within a gene (Neale et al., 2011; Tzeng and Zhang, 2007; Wu
et al., 2011).

After creating a burden score for each subject, one may carry
out the burden test by performing a standard regression analysis
and combine the Wald statistics of multiple studies through the

inverse-variance formula. However, this strategy is problematic
for rare variants because the effect estimates may be unstable or
even undeﬁned when only a small number of subjects carry any
mutation. Indeed, the log odds ratio is undeﬁned if the burden
scores are zero for all cases or all controls. We recommend to use
score statistics, which are statistically more accurate and numer-
ically more stable than Wald and likelihood ratio statistics,
especially for binary traits (Lin and Tang, 2011). Currently,
there is no meta-analysis software for combining score statistics.
Thus, we developed the Meta-Analysis of Score Statistics
(MASS) software, which performs an overall burden test by
combining the score statistics of multiple studies. In addition,
MASS performs an overall VT test for multiple studies based
on score statistics. Finally, MASS performs an overall variance-
component test also based on score statistics. The meta-analysis
performed by MASS is statistically as efﬁcient as joint analysis of
individual-level data. The software is extremely easy to use.
Because score statistics are not available in existing software
packages, we developed SCORE-Seq, which takes the standard
input format of sequencing data and outputs score statistics,
which can then be meta-analyzed in MASS.

2 METHODS

Suppose that we are interested in d genetic variables. For the burden and
VT tests, the genetic variables pertain to the burden scores; for the vari-
ant-component test, the genetic variables pertain to the genotypes of in-
dividual variants; for the CMC test (Li and Leal, 2008), the genetic
variables contain the genotypes of common variants and the burden
scores of rare variants. Suppose that there are K independent studies.
For the kth study, we calculate the (multivariate) score statistic UU‘) for
testing the null hypothesis H0 that none of the d genetic variables have
any effect on the trait of interest, and we also calculate the corresponding
information matrix V0“). Note that UU‘) is a d x 1 vector and VU‘) is a
d x d matrix. If a genetic variable is absent in the kth study, then we set
the corresponding entries in UU‘) and VU‘) to zero. Given the input of UU‘)
and W” (k = 1, .. MASS calculates U = 2,52, UU‘) and
V = 2le VU‘). Under H0, the random vector U is (asymptotically) multi-
variate normal with mean 0 and covariance matrix V. It can be shown
that U is the score statistic for testing H0 from the joint likelihood for the
original data of the K studies allowing nuisance parameters (e.g., inter-
cepts and error variances) to be different among the K studies (Lin and
Zeng, 2010). Thus, association testing based on U and V is equivalent to
the joint analysis of the original data.

After calculating U and V, MASS can perform three types of multi-
variate tests, which encompass all commonly used rare-variant tests.

1. Quadratic statistic:

Q = UTV‘IU.

Under H0, the test statistic Q is distributed as x31. If d = 1 and the genetic
variable pertains to a speciﬁc burden score (based on a MAF threshold or

the Madsen—Browning weighting), then Q is a burden test with 1 degree
of freedom. If the genetic variables consist of the genotypes of common
SNPs and the burden score of rare variants, then Q is the CMC test.

2. Maximum statistic:

2
Tmax=j3111adej/Vj,

where U]- is the jth component of U, and V]- is the jth diagonal element of
V. The P—value of T max is determined by the multivariate normal distri-
bution of U (Lin and Tang, 2011). If the d genetic variables are the
burden scores at d MAF thresholds, then Tmax yields the VT test. If
the genetic variables pertain to different types of burden scores, such as
T1, T5, and Madsen—Browning, then T max can be used to adjust for
multiple testing with those burden tests.
3. Weighted quadratic statistic:

Q, = UTWU,

where W is a weight matrix. The null distribution of Qw is determined
by 21:1 lljxij, where llj is the jth eigenvalue of V1/2WV1/2, and
xil, ..., xi d are independent xj random variables. If the genetic vari-
ables are the genotypes of individual SNPs, then Qw becomes the SKAT
or C—alpha test. For SKAT, W is a diagonal matrix that depends on the
MAFs through a beta function; for C—alpha, W is an identity matrix.

3 RESULTS

MASS is a freely available C program that runs on Unix
and Linux systems. The basic command line is
MASS [—method method] [—sfile script] [—ofile
outfile] [options] . The option —method selects one of
the three test statistics: quadratic, maximum or weighted quad-
ratic. The option —sf ile speciﬁes a script ﬁle that describes the
input ﬁles from multiple studies. For the weighted quadratic
statistic, the option —weight can be used to specify a ﬁle with
a weight for each component of U. MASS can ﬁlter out genetic
variables based on minor allele counts (MACs). Full documen-
tation is available at http://dlin.web.unc.edu/software/.

The summary statistics for individual studies can be obtained
from SCORE-Seq, which inputs the sequencing data with a

tests. The basic command line is SCORE—Seq [—pfile phe—

[—ofile outfile] [—vtlog vtlog] [—snplog

contains the phenotype and covariates; genofile contains the
genotypes; mapfile provides the gene—SNP mapping and SNP
annotation. The output ﬁles outfile, vtlog and snplog
contain the score statistics and information matrices for the
burden test, VT and SKAT. In the output ﬁles, each row cor-
responds to a component of the score statistic and each column
of the score statistic is followed by the corresponding informa-
tion matrix. The SCORE-Seq output ﬁles for different studies
can be input directly into MASS.

We recently applied MASS to the NHLBI Exome Sequencing
Project. The meta-analysis involved 11 studies and 15 404 genes,
with an average of 7 genetic variables per test. In three of the
studies, subjects were selected for sequencing because they had
extreme values of a quantitative trait. Thus, we developed a
special program called SCORE-SeqTDS to perform quantitative
trait analysis under trait-dependent sampling. We obtained the
summary statistics from SCORE-Seq or SCORE-SeqTDS, de-
pendent on the study design. The total size of the input ﬁles for
MASS was 172 MB. We ran the three types of tests on an IBM
HS22 machine: the quadratic statistic took <10 seconds and 1
MB memory; the maximum statistic took <280 seconds and 33
MB memory; and the weighted quadratic statistic took <200
seconds and 33 MB memory.

Figure 1 is a ﬂow chart for performing the VT test. The top
panel shows the SCORE-Seq input and output ﬁles for the ﬁrst
two studies. The ﬁrst gene, ABHD8, has three MAF thresholds.
Thus, the score vector for this gene is provided in three rows, and
the information matrix is a 3 x 3 matrix, whose upper diagonal
elements are redundant and thus set to zero. The 11 output ﬁles
generated by SCORE-Seq and SCORE-SeqTDS are input into

4 DISCUSSION

Protection of human subjects and other study policies make it
difﬁcult to share individual-level data, even in well-organized
consortia. Thus, meta-analysis is strongly preferable to joint ana-
lysis. The MASS software enables one to perform meta-analysis
of score statistics for sequencing studies, which is statistically as
efﬁcient as and indeed numerically equivalent to joint analysis of
individual-level data. This software can also be used to combine
results from other types of genetic studies as well as non-genetic
studies.

In meta-analysis of sequencing data, the participating studies
should use the same annotation ﬁle so that the summary statis-
tics are generated in a consistent manner across studies. This
does not mean that the variants have to be the same among
studies. If a genetic variable is missing in one study, then zero
can be used as a placeholder in the summary statistics and MASS
will combine all available information.

The calculation of the burden scores requires speciﬁcation of
the MAFs. The MAFs may be estimated separately in each study
or jointly across all studies; they may also be determined from an
external source. We recommend that the same MAFs be used by
all participating studies. In this way, the same variants are
included in the calculations of the burden scores among the
studies, and the MAF thresholds for the VT test are consistent
across the studies.

For studies that use different exome capturing kits or studies
in which some have exome sequencing while others have exome
chip data, the input variants are different. If the genetic variable
pertains to the genotype of a variant and that variant is not
measured in the kth study, then we simply set the corresponding
entries in UU‘) and VU‘) to zero, so that MASS will combine all
available data. If the genetic variable pertains to a burden score,
then a variant that is absent in a study will not contribute to the
calculation of the burden score for that study. The score statistics
from such studies can still be combined in MASS, although the
results need to be interpreted with extra care.

If the burden score is a (weighted) linear combination of the
genotype values (e. g. the total number of mutations or a
weighted sum of the mutation counts), then the score statistics
for the burden and VT tests are (weighted) linear combinations
of the score statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the geno-
types of individual variants are not associated with the trait of
interest. In that case, it would be sufﬁcient to input only the score
vector and information matrix for individual variants because

they can be used to create the score statistics and information
matrices for the burden, VT and SKAT tests. We did not take
this approach because it requires the burden scores to be calcu-
lated under the additive mode of inheritance. Indeed, it has
become a common practice to deﬁne the burden score as the
presence or absence of any mutation within a gene rather than
the total number or weighted linear combination of the muta-
tions. SCORE-Seq allows burden scores to be calculated under
the additive, dominant or recessive mode of inheritance. By
asking the user to input the score statistics and information
matrices for each speciﬁc test, MASS can accommodate any
mode of inheritance.

MASS adopts the ﬁxed-effect model, which assumes that the
genetic effects are the same among the participating studies. This
approach will have reasonable power as long as the effects are in
the same direction across studies. An alternative approach is the
random-effect model, under which the effects in different studies
follow a normal distribution. The random-effect model tends to
be less powerful than the ﬁxed-effect model even when the effects
are heterogeneous and thus has rarely been used in genetic asso-
ciation studies.

Abstract

Motivation: Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired—End Tag sequencing (ChlA—PET) is an
established method for detecting genome—wide looping interactions at high resolution. Current
ChlA—PET analysis software packages either fail to correct for non—specific interactions due to
genomic proximity or only address a fraction of the steps required for data processing. We present
Mango, a complete ChlA—PET data analysis pipeline that provides statistical confidence estimates
for interactions and corrects for major sources of bias including differential peak enrichment and
genomic proximity.

Results: Comparison to the existing software packages, ChlA—PET Tool and ChiaSig revealed that
Mango interactions exhibit much better agreement with high—resolution Hi—C data. lmportantly,
Mango executes all steps required for processing ChlA—PET datasets, whereas ChiaSig only com—
pletes 20% of the required steps. Application of Mango to multiple available ChlA—PET datasets per—
mitted the independent rediscovery of known trends in chromatin loops including enrichment of
CTCF, RAD21, SMC3 and ZNF143 at the anchor regions of interactions and strong bias for conver—
gent CTCF motifs.

1 Introduction

 

Increasing evidence suggests that the three—dimensional structure of
mammalian chromatin plays an important role in regulating gene
expression and biological function (Gondor and Ohlsson, 2009; Li
et 61]., 2012; Schoenfelder et 61]., 2010). To study chromatin struc—
ture, multiple high—throughput sequencing—based assays have been
developed including 3C, 4C, 5C, Hi—C and, the newest addition,
Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired End Tag sequencing
(ChIA-PET) (Dekker, 2002; Dostie et 61]., 2006; Fullwood et 61].,
2009; Lieberman—Aiden et 61]., 2009; Simonis et 61]., 2006). Though
the methods differ in scope and resolution, they all share the same
basic steps including cross—linking native chromatin, ligating

interacting fragments and sequencing chimeric DNA fragments to
assess interaction frequency. Informatic analysis of the resulting
data then entails identifying which pairs of loci exhibit more inter-
actions than expected by random chance.

It has been well established by 3C, FISH and Hi—C studies that
pairs of genomic loci exhibit random-polymer-like behavior in
which genomic interaction frequencies decrease as a function of gen—
omic distance (Supplementary Fig. 81A and B) (Dekker, 2002;
Lieberman—Aiden et 61]., 2009). Therefore, it is critical that software
designed to detect interactions between pairs of loci must consider
and accurately model the expected interaction frequency of pairs of
loci given linear genomic distance. Indeed, most if not all available

software packages to identify interactions from 5 C and Hi—C data—
sets do consider genomic distance in the null model (Ay et al., 2014;
Duan et 61]., 2010; Sanyal et 61]., 2012). Furthermore, ChIA-PET has
the unique property of specifically enriching for loci bound by a spe—
cific protein. As these regions are bound at different affinities
throughout the genome, the depth of coverage at interacting peaks
must be considered in any analysis paradigm.

Several analysis methods exist to process ChIA—PET data.
However, these methods either fail to address the major sources of
bias or require the user to write a large portion of the analysis code
themselves rendering them unusable for many wet lab biologists.

ChIA-PET Tool (CPT) was the first software to address the
unique problems associated with ChIA—PET data and has established
an effective workflow for data processing (Li et 61]., 2010). The au—
thors of CPT employ both random sampling and statistical methods
to filter out noise due to random ligations that occur in solution ra—
ther than in vivo. However, CPT fails to address the most common
source of bias in 3 C—based techniques, non—specific interactions due
to linear genomic distance, i.e. the random—polymer effect. CPT uses
the hypergeometric distribution to assess significance of interactions.
This model assumes that any two genomic loci are equally likely to
be linked by a PET regardless of genomic distance. Therefore, in
addition to detecting true looping interactions, this approach is
likely to detect a large number of false positives that exhibit non—
random interaction frequencies due to genomic proximity rather
than genomic looping. Indeed, a recent study revealed that inter—
actions determined by CPT showed poor agreement with high-
resolution Hi—C datasets. In addition, CPT is extremely difficult to
install as it requires a very specific OS configuration including a
complex array of programming languages and environments includ—
ing C, perl, python, R, MySQL, Apache web server and PHP.

Recently, Paulsen et al described a novel method to process
ChIA—PET data that does consider genomic distance in the null
model. This method, ChiaSig, uses the non—central hypergeometric
to identify statistically significant interactions {Paulsen:2014bn}. As
expected, this method identifies far fewer interactions than CPT.
While this approach yields accurate interactions, the software only
executes the very final step in ChIA—PET data analysis, interaction
scoring. Therefore, users must write their own software to find and
remove linker sequences, align PETs, remove duplicates, call peaks,
group PETs into interactions and determine the lower bound cutoff
for PET distances. As such, this software is only useful to researchers
with significant programming skills. Other software packages have
been described but either are not publicly available or have similar
limitations to CPT and ChiaSig (Niu and Lin, 2014; Reeder and
Gifford, 2013).

To address these shortcomings, we introduce Mango an open
source ChIA—PET data analysis pipeline. Mango models the likeli-
hood of interactions between genomic loci as a function of both dis—
tance and peak depth and uses this model to assign statistical
confidence to interactions. This software is simple to install, requires
only fastq files as input and completes all steps required to analyze
ChIA-PET datasets with only a single command.

To evaluate the applicability of Mango, we compared the inter—
actions determined by Mango, ChiaSig and CPT for three publicly
available ChIA—PET datasets (Heidari et 61]., 2014). We demonstrate
that interactions detected by Mango show better agreement with
recently published high—resolution Hi—C data and independently
recapitulate several recently discovered characteristics of long—range
chromatin interactions. First, the anchor regions of interactions de—
tected by Mango were strongly enriched for the proteins CTCF,
RAD21, SMC3 and ZNF143 with between 92 and 98% of anchor

regions overlapping a CTCF binding site. Second, the majority
(73 to 94%) of interactions linked two loci that harbored CTCF
motifs that had a convergent orientation.

2 Methods

The general structure of the Mango workflow is divided into five
steps that can be executed all at once or one at time (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Step 1 involves finding and removing linker sequences from
reads as well as filtering reads based on the combination of linkers
observed. Only PETs that have the same linker sequences at both
ends are kept for further processing. In step 2, reads are aligned to
the genome using the widely used Bowtie software suite (Ben
Langmead et 61]., 2009). Step 3 removes reads that may be due to
polymerase chain reaction duplication and organizes the data for
peak calling and interaction analysis. Step 4 uses MACSZ to call
binding peaks, which are subsequently used as anchor regions for
the detection of interactions in step 5 (Zhang et 61]., 2008). In step 5,
statistical confidence estimates are assigned to interactions based on
comparison to a model that considers both genomic distance and
the read depth of each peak. The resulting P values are corrected to
account for multiple hypothesis testing and filtered to a user defined
false discovery rate (FDR).

2.1 Calculating statistical confidence estimates of
interactions

Calculating the statistical confidence estimates of interactions in
step 5 begins with two stages of filtering. Since previous studies have
shown that most interactions, especially functional interactions,
take place within megabase scale topological domains (TADs:
Supplementary Fig. 81A and B), Mango removes inter—chromosomal
PETs and PETs with a distance greater than a user—defined value
(1 Mb for this article) (Dixon et al., 2012; Phillips—Cremins et 61].,
2013; Sanyal et 61]., 2012). This both reduces computational burden
and increases statistical power by minimizing the effect of multiple
hypothesis testing. The second step of filtering involves setting a
lower bound distance cutoff for PETs to eliminate bias introduced
by PETs that result from self-circularization rather than inter-
ligation of interacting loci. Mango uses the orientation of the strands
on either end of a PET to estimate the percent of reads due to self—
circularization as a function of distance and allows the user to define
an acceptable cutoff (5% for this article; see Supplementary
Methods and Fig. 81C). The remaining ‘mid—range’ PETs are used to
determine interactions.

PETs are next grouped into putative interactions. Since all
ligated fragments in a ChIA—PET experiment must be captured dur—
ing the chromatin immunoprecipitation step, there should be enrich—
ment of reads at both ends of each interaction. Therefore, Mango
uses the peaks detected in step 4 or a user supplied Browser
Extensible Data file of genomic regions, as the anchor regions for
putative interactions.

Mango then models the probability of observing a single PET
linking two loci as a function of their genomic distance of separation
and the product of their read depths (see Supplementary Methods
and Fig. S1C—F). These models are built empirically for each data
and are thus robust to differences in antibodies, sequencing depth
and experimental variation. A comparison of models built for three
different datasets is shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Application
of Bayes theorem shows that the probability of observing a PET
linking two loci separated by distance L and characterized by joint
peak depth D is a product of two other probabilities:

(i) the probability of observing a PET with distance L connecting re—
gions with depth D and (ii) the probability of connecting these two
specific regions given length L and depth D (for details see
Supplementary Methods). That is:

P(I) = P(L,D) >< P(I|L,D) (1)

where P(I) is the probability of observing a PET connecting two spe—
cific loci, P(L,D) is the probability of observing a PET with a given
L and D and P(I|L,D) is the probability of the PET linking these
two specific loci given L and D.

L and D are independent (Supplementary Fig. S4) and therefore
this equation, can be represented by:

_ P(I|L) >< P(I|D)
P(I) _ P(C|L) >< P(C|D) >< CT

 

(2)

where P(I|L) represents the probability of observing a PET linking
loci with distance L, P(I|D) represents the probability of observing a
PET linking loci with depth D, P(C|L) represents the probability of
observing a pair of loci with distance L (regardless of whether any
PETs link the two loci), P(C|D) represents the probability of observ—
ing a pair of loci with depth D (regardless of whether any PETs link
the two loci) and CT is the total number of pairwise combinations of
loci.

All the terms on the right side of this equation can be modeled
from the data itself (Supplementary Fig. 81D and E) allowing for the
determination of P(I) for each pair of loci (Supplementary Fig. S1F).
According to the binomial distribution, this probability can be used
to calculate the P value of observing exactly [a PETs using the fol-
lowing equation:

P<K = 1e): (Emma — P(I))“: <3)

where N is the total number of mid-range PETs in the experiment.
The P value of observing [a or more PETs can be calculated as

P(KZ/e) = P(K = i) (4)

N
12K
Finally, P values for all possible pairs of interacting loci, not just the
ones connected by PETs, are corrected for multiple hypothesis test—
ing using the Benjamini—Hochberg method (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995) and filtered to a user—defined FDR.

3 Results

3.1 Comparison to existing ChlA—PET analysis methods

To evaluate Mango, we processed three publicly available ChIA-
PET datasets with Mango and two publicly available software pack—
ages, CPT and ChiaSig (Li et al., 2010; Paulsen et al., 2014). The
datasets targeted histone H3K4Me3, POLR2A and RAD21 in a
human myelogenous leukemia cell line (K562) (Heidari et al.,
2014). ChiaSig only performs the very final step in ChIA-PET data
analysis (Table 1). Therefore, we used Mango to perform linker

Table 1. Comparison of ChlA-PET software packages

parsing, read alignment, duplicate removal, peak calling and PET
grouping and applied ChiaSig to resulting data. The exact com—
mands required to replicate the Mango results are available in the
Supplementary Information. Application of Mango to the
H3K4Me3, POLR2A and RAD21 data resulted in 1259, 4040 and
9168 significant interactions at an FDR of 0.05, respectively
(Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. SS). ChiaSig produced 1360, 2345 and
5869 interactions. CPT resulted in far more significant interactions
than either Mango or ChiaSig at the same FDR (66 787, 16 961 and
50 725). This large decrease in interactions compared with CPT is
expected since virtually all pairs of local intra chromosomal loci
should interact non—randomly according to the hypergeometric
model used by CPT. Mango and ChiaSig, in contrast, correct for
non—specific interaction frequencies due to genomic distance and
therefore report only those interactions with interaction frequencies
that significantly exceed those expected for a given distance. Despite
this sharp decrease in identified interactions, interactions detected
by Mango and ChiaSig show better agreement with alternative
methodologies for detecting chromatin loops (vide infra).

We next compared the sizes of the interactions detected by deter—
mining the number of base pairs between the interacting anchor re—
gions (Fig. 1B). Since Mango and ChiaSig account for random
interactions due to genomic proximity, the median interaction dis—
tances detected were significantly larger than the interactions de—
tected by CPT (Mango: 100507, 117861 and 177 846 bp; ChiaSig:
106213, 140 738 and 158 898 bp; CPT: 1371, 120 and 1060 bp;
Wilcoxon test, P value < 10‘”). The minimum interaction distances
for CPT, ChiaSig and Mango were 1, 3398 and 13425 bp. This
strong skew toward short interaction distances in CPT results helps
explain the poor overlap observed in Figure 1A as 83—98% of CPT
interactions were shorter than the shortest Mango interaction
(excluding intra—chromosomal interactions longer than 1 Mb and all
inter-chromosomal interactions).

Since pairs of loci interact non—specifically as a function of gen—
omic distance, we reasoned that short—range interactions should re—
quire more PETs to achieve significance compared with long—range
interactions. To test this, we binned significant interactions from the
RAD21 dataset by genomic distance ranging from 25 kb to 1Mb
and plotted the percent of interactions in each bin that were sup—
ported by PETs ranging from 2 t0220 (Fig. 1C—E). CPT inter-
actions were fairly uniform with respect to distance. Across all bins,
the majority of significant interactions were supported by only two
PETs (Fig. 1C). In contrast, Mango and ChiaSig interactions showed
the expected trend in which shorter distance interactions required
more PETs to achieve a significant P value (Fig. 1E and F).
Conducting the same analysis for interactions detected by 5C re—
vealed a trend very similar to that observed in the Mango and
ChiaSig datasets (Supplementary Fig. S6) (Sanyal et al., 2012).

3.2 Comparison to Hi—C

To determine the accuracy and biological relevance of interactions
detected by Mango, we intersected our results with deeply
sequenced Hi—C data. Rao et al. (2014) recently published deeply
sequenced high—resolution Hi—C data for multiple cell lines including

K562. We plotted normalized Hi—C contact matrices and interaction
calls for each of the three algorithms (Fig. 2A).

Visual inspection of ChIA—PET interactions overlaid on top of
Hi—C contact matrices revealed a strong agreement between Hi—C
interactions and ChIA—PET interaction calls made by both ChiaSig
and Mango. A contact matrix for a 1 kb region on chromosome gen-
erated by Rao et al. is shown in Figure 2A. The resolution of the Hi-
C dataset permitted clear identification of genome-wide looping
interactions. Loops detected by Hi—C are characterized by islands of
high interaction frequency, which are surrounded on all sides by
lower interaction frequencies. Red squares mark interaction calls
made by each of the three algorithms. Loops called by Rao et al. are
shown in Supplementary Figure S7. Interactions detected by ChiaSig
and Mango exhibited good agreement with Hi—C contact matrices
as shown in Figure 2A. In contrast, although CPT interactions do
overlap some interactions that were detected by Mango, ChiaSig or
Rao et al., the majority linked extremely close genomic loci.

To quantify how well the Hi—C data supported the ChIA-PET
interactions, we generated aggregate peak analysis (APA) plots as
described by Rao et al. (2014) (Fig. 2B). These plots aggregate the
signal in pixels surrounding anchor regions across all interactions.
Rao et al. demonstrated that even low—sequencing depth Hi—C data—
sets can be used to evaluate the quality of interaction calls.
Moreover, this method does not depend heavily on the methods
used to process the Hi—C data as it uses contact matrices rather than
interaction calls to build the plots. To generate APA plots, inter—
action counts are summed for all pairs of loci in 5 -kb bins spanning
50 kb up— and downstream of both interacting loci. These values are
plotted as a 21 X 21 pixel matrix colored by interaction count. Since
true looping interactions should interact more frequently than inter-
vening pairs of loci, they should be characterized by a dark center
pixel. To generate these plots, only interactions linking regions

separated by greater than 150 kb and less than 1 Mb were used. The
level of support for each set of interactions can be quantified by cal—
culating an APA score, which is simply the value of the center pixel
divided by the mean of pixels 15—30 kb downstream of the upstream
loci and 15—30 kb upstream of the downstream loci. Scores of 1 indi—
cate no evidence of a loop. Higher scores indicate stronger evidence.
For all three datasets, APA scores for mango and ChiaSig are similar
and both are greater than APA scores for CPT (Supplementary Fig. S8).
However, the different algorithms produced vastly different quantities
of significant interactions. Therefore, two equivalent interaction—
ranking algorithms could exhibit different APA scores simply based
on the cutoff applied to control FDR. To address this, we developed
an extension of APA methods that disentangles interaction-ranking
from these thresholding effects.

The quality of interaction detection between the three methods
was assessed using cumulative APA (CAPA) plots. To generate
CAPA plots, we ranked interactions by P values and calculated APA
score in a cumulative fashion adding 100 interactions at a time
(Fig. 2C). CAPA plots reveal that Mango interactions are better sup—
ported by Hi—C matrices than either ChiaSig or CPT across all three
datasets. Interestingly, sets of interactions deemed significant by ei-
ther ChiaSig or Mango had very similar APA scores for all three
datasets but since Mango’s interaction ranking is superior to
ChiaSig, Mango reported nearly twice as many interactions as
ChiaSig for both the POL2 and RAD21 datasets. Both Mango and
ChiaSig provided far better interaction ranking capabilities com—
pared with CPT.

3.3 Mango interactions recapitulate known
characteristics of DNA loops

To assess the biological relevance of Mango interaction calls, we
determined if the interaction calls made by Mango could

recapitulate previous findings regarding 3D chromatin structure. We
and others have shown that anchor regions of 3D loops are very
strongly enriched for CTCF, members of the cohesion complex and
ZNF143. Intersecting these interactions with ChIP—Seq datasets
available from the ENCODE consortium revealed that these pro—
teins were indeed enriched at anchor regions detected by Mango
(Fig. 3A) (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012).

Anchor regions identified from H3K4Me3 and POLR2A data-
sets showed enrichment for virtually all TFs. This finding is consist-
ent with Hi—C interaction calls from Rao et al. (2014). As we have
previously shown, interacting loci are enriched for HOT regions, re-
gions bound by many TFs, which would explain this enrichment for
all TFs (Heidari et al., 2014). Removing interacting loci which over—
lap HOT regions reveals only four strongly enriched chromatin-
associated proteins: CTCF, RAD21, SMC3 and ZNF143 (Fig. 3B).
These findings indicate that virtually all (between 97 and 99%) of
interacting loci overlap a HOT region, a CTCF binding site or both
(Supplementary Fig. S9). Further analysis of these two types of inter—
acting loci revealed unique characteristics of each subtype such as

differences in interaction distance and additive strength of inter—
actions (Supplementary Figs. S9 and S10).

Finally, we asked if interactions detected by Mango were charac—
terized by an orientation bias in CTCF motifs. Rao et al. revealed
that the majority of interactions contained CTCF motifs that were
oriented toward the intervening region between the two loci.
Indeed, all three datasets exhibited a strong bias for inward pointing
motifs and a virtual absence of outward pointing motifs (Fig. 3C).
These strong trends and overwhelming agreement with high-reso-
lution Hi—C data provides powerful validation of Mango results as
true looping chromatin interactions.

3.4 Implementation and availability

Mango was designed with both accuracy and ease of use in mind.
Mango runs on both Linux and OSX operating systems. Installation of
Mango requires only a single command and its dependencies are lim—

4 Discussion

Here we describe Mango a ChIA—PET data analysis pipeline that
corrects for non—specific interactions as a function of genomic prox-
imity and peak depth. We demonstrate that Mango exhibits
increased accuracy compared with both CPT, the only existing
ChIA-PET analysis pipeline, and ChiaSig, a software package that
provides statistical confidence estimates for ChIA—PET interactions.
Application of Mango to multiple ChIA—PET datasets allowed for
the independent replication of findings regarding the nature of 3D
chromatin loops including strong enrichment for CTCF binding sites
with inward oriented motifs.

In addition to improved accuracy, one of the key benefits of
Mango is usability. Mango was designed to be usable by all re—
searchers even those with minimal computer competency. Mango is
easily installed and completes all steps from fastq to interactions
with a single command. It relies on only four widely used and easily
installed software packages. In contrast, CPT requires a very specific
OS configuration including a complex array of programming lan-
guages and environments including C, perl, python, R, MySQL,
Apache web server and PHP and is accompanied by a seven page in—
stallation guide. ChiaSig can be installed easily yet only performs a
single step required for the analysis of ChIA—PET data. Users are
therefore required to write their own code to perform the majority
of processing steps including linker parsing, read alignment, dupli-
cate removal, peak calling and distance filtering.

The software presented here improves upon methods used in our
previous work (Heidari et al., 2014). Most notably Mango replaces
the computationally expensive distance matched rewiring method
with a simple and robust Bayesian approach.

Because of improvements in ease of use and accuracy, Mango will dras—
tically improve our ability to uncover the characteristics and function of 3D
chromatin structure through the analysis of ChIA—PET datasets.

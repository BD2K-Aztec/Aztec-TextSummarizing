ABSTRACT

Motivation: MicroRNAs have recently emerged as a major class
of regulatory molecules involved in a broad range of biological
processes and complex diseases. Construction of miRNA-target
regulatory networks can provide useful information for the study
and diagnosis of complex diseases. Many sequence-based and
evolutionary information-based methods have been developed to
identify miRNA—mRNA targeting relationships. However, as the
amount of available miRNA and gene expression data grows, a
more statistical and systematic method combining sequence-based
binding predictions and expression-based correlation data becomes
necessary for the accurate identification of miRNA—mRNA pairs.
Results: We propose a Lasso regression model for the identification
of miRNA—mRNA targeting relationships that combines sequence-
based prediction information, miRNA co-regulation, RISC availability
and miRNA/mRNA abundance data. By comparing this modelling
approach with two other known methods applied to three different
datasets, we found that the Lasso regression model has considerable
advantages in both sensitivity and specificity. The regression
coefficients in the model can be used to determine the true regulatory
efficacies in tissues and was demonstrated using the miRNA target
site type data. Finally, by constructing the miRNA regulatory networks
in two stages of prostate cancer (PCa), we found the several
significant miRNA-hubbed network modules associated with PCa
metastasis. In conclusion, the Lasso regression model is a robust
and informative tool for constructing the miRNA regulatory networks
for diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases.

Availability: The R program for predicting miRNA—mRNA targeting
relationships using the Lasso regression model is freely available,
along with the described datasets and resulting regulatory network,
at http://biocompute.bmi.ac.cn/CZ|ab/alarmnet/. The source code
is open for modification and application to other miRNA/mRNA
expression datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20—24 nt RNAs that derive from
distinctive hairpin precursors in animals, plants and fungi, and
can bind to complementary sequences on target mRNAs. In recent
years, miRNAs have emerged as a major class of regulatory
elements of gene expression. Computational predictions of miRNA
targets estimate that each miRNA regulates hundreds of different
mRNAs, and >60% of human protein—coding genes are subject to
miRNA regulation (Friedman et al., 2009). MiRNAs are involved
in a broad range of biological processes, including development,
differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation (Bartel, 2004; Harfe,
2005). Several studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in the
initiation and progression of cancer (Lu et al., 2005; Volinia et al.,
2006). Signiﬁcantly differing miRNA proﬁles in various types of
tumors suggests that miRNA proﬁling has diagnostic and perhaps
prognostic potential (Garzon et al., 2009).

MiRNAs use base pairing to guide RNA—induced silencing
complexes (RISCs) to speciﬁc mRNAs with imperfect
complementary sequences. The recruitment of RISC commonly
leads to the repression of targeted mRNA through inhibition
of translation initiation and/0r miRNA—mediated mRNA
destabilization (Bushati and Cohen, 2007; Eulalio et al., 2008).
The Argonaute protein in the RISC complex is crucial for gene
silencing to occur for its capability of endonucleolytic cleavage.
In human, there are four Ago proteins, where Ag02 is the sole
protein required for the RISC activity (Liu et al., 2004; Meister
et al., 2004). A miRNA can directly destruct the target mRNA
through mRNA cleavage when the pairing is extensive (Liu et al.,
2004). This kind of repression dominates in plants (J ones—Rhoades
et al., 2006). In animals, however, it was once thought miRNAs
repress protein output with little or no inﬂuence on mRNA levels,
because in animals only a few targets satisfy the extensive pairing
required for cleavage (Olsen and Ambros, 1999; Wightman et al.,
1993). However a number of microarray data showed that miRNAs
decrease the levels of many targeted mRNAs (Giraldez et al., 2006;
Krutzfeldt et al., 2005; Lim et al., 2005). Only recently it became
clear that, similar as in plants, miRNAs predominantly exert their
effects in mammalian cells through decreasing the levels of target
mRNAs, and the mRNA destabilisation that accounts for most
(284%) of the decreased protein production (Guo et al., 2010;
Swami, 2010).

A number of computational prediction methods have been
introduced to identify the targets of miRNAs. The ﬁrst generation
of miRNA target prediction methods were primarily based on
Watson—Crick base pairing rules and free energy calculations for

Lasso regression model for microRNA—mRNA networks

 

the miRNA/mRNA duplex, with very limited incorporation of
experimental data. The resulting predictions differed widely between
methods. Current miRNA target predictions methods are based
primarily on systematic target site mutation experiments and adopted
the ‘seed pairing’ approach, which could improve the accuracies of
the predictions. However, they are still acknowledged to have issues
with speciﬁcity, and the convergences of the predictions are also
unsatisfactory (Rajewsky, 2006; Sethupathy et al., 2006b).

It has been suggested that integrating the miRNA and mRNA
expression data into the prediction could play an important role in
the identiﬁcation of miRNA targets. A natural thought of using the
miRNA/mRNA expression data is to capture the negative correlation
relationship between a miRNA and its target mRNA, based on which
several methods have been developed recently (Ritchie et al., 2010;
Volinia et al., 2010). This marginal approach is intuitive and simple
but could identify very few known target pairs (Stanhope et al.,
2009). An improvement of the marginal approach is developed using
AIC—optimal regression model and Ago expression information
(Stanhope et al., 2009). However, like the marginal approach, the
AIC—optimal model investigates the miRNA—mRNA relationship
individually, failing to consider the effects of multiple miRNAs
targeting and their competition in available binding sites (Doench
and Sharp, 2004; Krek et al., 2005; Rajewsky, 2006).

As with transcriptional regulation, an mRNA can be
simultaneously suppressed by more than one miRNA (Rajewsky,
2006). Both in vitro experiments (Doench and Sharp, 2004) and
the observation that many 3’ —untranslated regions (3’ —UTRs) had
predicted targets for different miRNAs demonstrate that a number
of miRNAs act together to regulate a target mRNA (Doench and
Sharp, 2004; John et al., 2004; Krek et al., 2005). Besides, these
miRNAs can repress target mRNA to varying orders of magnitude
(Grimson et al., 2007; Lim et al., 2005). Features like target site
types (Bartel, 2009), target mRNAs abundance (Arvey et al.,
2010) and AU—rich nucleotide composition near the site (Grimson
et al., 2007) can affect the efﬁcacies of miRNA repression.
Hence, reliable identiﬁcation of miRNA—target relationship
requires consideration of different layers of information, including
sequence—based information (Krek et al., 2005; Lewis et al., 2005),
co—regulation of miRNAs, RISC availability (Stanhope et al., 2009)
and miRNA/mRNA abundance (Gennarino et al., 2009; Rajewsky,
2006).

In this article, we develop a linear regression model to investigate
one mRNA simultaneously regulated by multiple targeting miRNAs
using miRNA/mRNA expression data. To control variable number
and improve model speciﬁcity, the sequence—based predictions are
used to determine the initial variables of the model. In particular,
we use a Lasso regression algorithm (Tibshirani, 1996) that imposes
a constraint on the coefﬁcients, by which the coefﬁcients of false
miRNA—mRNA pairs will be set to zero. The central idea of the
model is consistent with the nature of different miRNAs coordinately
regulating a target mRNA and their potential competition in binding
sites (Doench and Sharp, 2004; Krek et al., 2005; Rajewsky,
2006). We assess the performance of the Lasso regression approach
by comparing it with two related identiﬁcation methods which
also use miRNA/mRNA expression data, the marginal miRNA—
mRNA comparison method and the AIC—optimal regression method
(Stanhope et al., 2009). We ﬁnd that the Lasso regression model has
the following features: (i) this model can recover a larger number
of known miRNA—target pairs, especially when compared with the

marginal comparison method, while also achieving a signiﬁcant
improvement in identiﬁcation speciﬁcity; (ii) the constraint imposed
on coefﬁcients enables the coefﬁcients to reﬂect the true magnitudes
of miRNAs regulation in tissues; (iii) unlike the marginal method
and AIC—optimal regression method, the Lasso regression approach
can simultaneously evaluate all possible targeting miRNAs of an
mRNA in one model, making it a rapid and robust tool to construct
the miRNA—target regulatory networks, especially when dealing
with cross—platform and high—throughput expression data.

2 METHODS

2.1 Regression modelling

2.1.1 Sequence-based computational prediction First, sequence—based
computational prediction was used to determine the initial variables
(miRNAs) in the regression model. Previous comparison of several miRNA
target prediction algorithms showed that the overlap between the predictions
of TargetScan and PicTar are signiﬁcantly higher than with any other
algorithms (roughly 80—90% identical sites when run on the same dataset of
3/—UTRs) (Rajewsky, 2006). In addition, by comparing the predictions with
~130 experimentally conﬁrmed miRNA—mRNA regulatory relationships
in Drosophila melanogaster, PicTar was found to have higher accuracy
and sensitivity than other algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we use
TargetScan (Grimson et al. , 2007; Lewis et al. , 2005) and PicTar (Sethupathy
et al., 2006a) to perform the computational prediction. Only those miRNAs
simultaneously predicted as targets by these two algorithms are selected to
be the initial miRNAs in the model.

Thus, let yi index the expression level of the i—th mRNA, j index the j—th
Ago protein, x]: represent the expression level of the k—th potential targeting
miRNA of the i—th mRNA simultaneously predicted by TargetScan and PicTar
algorithms, P,- represent the number of all potential targeting miRNAs of the
i—th mRNA and Si be a random error term assumed to be normally distributed.
The original linear regression model can be written as follows:

Pi
yi=ﬁ6+2ﬁixi+8i (1)

k=1

2.1.2 Evaluation of Ago expression terms It has been previously shown
that combining RISC and miRNA expression data could reveal more negative
relationships between targeting miRNAs and mRNAs (Stanhope et al., 2009).
As binding to RISC is essential for the miRNAs to repress target mRNAs
and miRNAs tend to bind to the same target sites of RISC (Meister et al.,
2004; Schmitter et al., 2006), it is reasonable to assume that concentration
changes in the Ago 1, 3, 4 proteins will affect the ability of Ago2 to bind
RISC and cleavage target mRNAs. Therefore, we consider each Ago protein
and its potential effects on the concentration of target mRNA. Here, we
assume that the mRNA levels of the Ago genes are positively related to their
protein concentrations. Let 14ng represent the j—th Ago mRNA level, and the
regression model with Ago terms can be written as follows:
4 Pi
y‘ =ﬁ5+ZZﬁjkAgo,-xi+s’ (2)
j=1 k=1
Because the Ago 1, 3, 4 proteins are all regarded as Ago2’s competitors in
binding with RISC, we can merge the expressions of the three proteins into
one term, Ag0134. This transformation can reduce the number of coefﬁcients
and transform model (2) to the following:

Pi Pi
yl = ﬁl) + ZﬁlZ,kAg02,kxllc + Zﬁl34,kAg0134,kxllc +81 (3)
[6:1 k=1

To further evaluate the effects of Ago proteins on the regression model, we
will apply models ( 1) and (3) to the same datasets to study the contribution
of Ago expression terms to the model performance.

2.2 Variable selection

By analysing the miRNA—mRNA regulatory relationships predicted by
TargetScan and PicTar, we found that, on average, one mRNA could be
potentially targeted by >30 miRNAs. Given that a considerable portion
of the miRNA—mRNA relationships predicted by TargetScan and PicTar
may be false positives, selection of initial variables is extremely important
for the regression model. The Lasso algorithm is adopted to perform the
variable selection procedure by estimating linear regression coefﬁcients
through Ll—constrained least squares. Speciﬁcally, it minimizes the residual
sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefﬁcients
being less than a constant. Because of the existence of this constraint, the
Lasso regression tends to produce some coefﬁcients that are exactly 0 and
hence can give robust and interpretable models. Speciﬁcally, for regression
model (1), the corresponding constrained L1 norm can be given by the
following inequality:

Pi _
Z lﬁtl <t (4)
k=1
For regression model (2), the corresponding constrained L1 norm is:
Z<lﬁ2,kl+lﬁl34,kl)<t (5)
k=1

Thus, if the variables do not indicate the real regulatory relationships of
miRNAs and mRNA, the corresponding coefﬁcients would converge to zero.
This problem is equivalent to minimizing the following loss function in a
typical Lagrangian form for model ( 1):

Here A20 is a complexity tuning parameter that controls the amount of
shrinkage. The larger the value of A is, the greater the amount of shrinkage.
Hence, A should be adaptively chosen to provide an estimate of expected
prediction error.

Computationally, the Lasso model represents a quadratic programming
problem, which can be tackled by standard numerical analysis algorithms.
In practice, we use the R programming language (Ihaka and Gentleman,
1996; Team, 2008) and the ‘lars’ package (Efron et al., 2004) to implement
the Lasso regression and variable selection procedure. The basic procedure
of the Least Angle Regression (LARS) algorithms in the ‘lars’ package is
starting with all coefﬁcients equal to zero and adding variable that currently
most correlated with y in a speciﬁc direction one—by—one until all variables
are in the model, as A is varied from inﬁnity to 0. To determine which subset
of variables should be chosen from the collection of possibilities, a Cp—type
statistic is derived to estimate the prediction error. Let ilk =XBk represent the
k—step estimator of y, 62 represent the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate
of variance and n represent the sample size. The Cp statistic can be given as
follows:

Carine lly—tlk lz/éz—n+2k (8)
The LARS algorithm then determines which step minimizes Cp. Because
miRNAs are known as negative regulators of target genes, only variables
(miRNAs) with negative 63k are selected as true regulatory miRNAs.

 

2.3 Model reﬁnement

In practice, the sample size is usually small; hence, a subset of the true
targeting miRNAs cannot be selected by the model in only one run of variable

selection. To address this issue, we introduce a complementary improvement
by adopting a multi—run Lasso regression procedure and ranking the selected
miRNAs by their coefﬁcients. First, we create two groups (I and II) and put
all the initial variables in Group II. Then for each run, the Lasso procedure is
performed as described above with the variables in Group II, and variables
assigned non—zero coefﬁcients are moved from Group II to Group I. This
loop stops if all variables in Group I have zero coefﬁcients or if Group I is
empty. Next, the negative coefﬁcients of selected variables are normalized,
and the miRNAs are ranked according to their coefﬁcients. As the selected
coefﬁcients are always negative, stronger regulatory relationships always
correspond to greater absolute values and lower ranks. We deﬁne the rank
score of the i—th miRNA based on the rank of its normalized coefﬁcient in
the set:

,. Rank of miRNAi
RankScore = , , , x 100 (9)
Number of negat1ve—coefﬁc1ent miRNAs

 

When the sample size is especially small (lesser than or equal to variables
number), the Cp statistic cannot be efﬁciently calculated. In this situation, the
multi—run Lasso regression procedure is slightly different to that described
above. Instead of selecting non—zero coefﬁcient variables in the step that
minimizes Cp, in each run we only select the variable ﬁrst entering the model
(most correlated with y), and remove it from Group II, until the number of
variables in Group II is sufﬁciently small to calculate Cp. Afterwards, the
runs are the same as described above.

2.4 Expression data

Regression model (2) and the variable selection procedure were implemented
using data from three studies in which both human mRNA and miRNA
expression levels were measured on a set of tissue samples. We used
two studies as the same as that used by the AIC—optimal regression
method for the convenience of methods comparison. The ﬁrst study of
nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) by researchers in Madison, WI, USA and
elsewhere (Sengupta et al., 2006, 2008) derived mRNA and miRNA proﬁling
from 31 NPC and 10 normal tissue samples using the whole genome
Affymetrix hgu133plus2 microarrays and custom cDNA arrays. The second
study of miRNA expression patterns over a wide variety of tumor and normal
tissue types by the Broad Institute (Lu et al., 2005) derived data from 67 tissue
samples of 10 different normal and tumor tissue types. Besides, we used the
third study of integrative genomic proﬁling of human PCa conducted by
Memorial Sloan—Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) (Taylor et al., 2010)
derived mRNA and miRNA proﬁling from 28 normal, 98 primary cancer
and 13 metastatic cancer tissues samples using the Affymetrix Human Exon
1.0 ST Array and Agilent Human miRNA Microarray 2.0. All the above
expression data were carefully parsed and formatted for the analysis of the
Lasso regression model.

To identify the signiﬁcant mRNAs between each group of the MSKCC
dataset and measure the fold changes of miRNAs and mRNAs, we employed
the Signiﬁcance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) algorithm (Tusher et al.,
2001) to statistically analyse the expression data. For each analysis, the
SAM algorithm calculates the false discovery rates (FDRs) and q—value to
determine the signiﬁcance of genes. Details of the SAM analysis results are
provided in Supplementary Tables 81—84.

2.5 Known target pairs

To evaluate the Lasso regression model, we used two sets of known
target pairs. One set was collected by Stanhope et al. from the TarBase
miRNA target database (Sethupathy et al., 2006a) and has been used
to validate the AIC—optimal regression model. All of them had been
previously validated through the use of mRNA— and protein—speciﬁc
techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), luciferase reporters
and immunoblotting and were represented in the Madison and Broad
datasets (relationships that were only supported by microarray data were

not included). There were 76 known miRNA—mRNA pairs from the
Broad dataset and 99 miRNA—mRNA pairs (including the previously
reported 76 pairs) from the Madison dataset. We collected the second
set of known miRNA—mRNA pairs by searching the literature for all
experimentally validated miRNA—mRNA targeting relationships that have
been demonstrated with PCa. In total, we collected 121 such pairs, and
106 of them were present in the MSKCC dataset. We used this set of
known miRNA—mRNA pairs for measurement of the MSKCC dataset. All
the miRNA—mRNA pairs are listed with the corresponding literature sources
in Supplementary Table S5.

2.6 Randomization controls

To evaluate the speciﬁcity of the Lasso regression method, we applied
this method repeatedly to a set of randomized control data and recorded
the identiﬁcation number for each repetition. Because the randomized
control miRNA—mRNA pairs cannot guarantee fully excluding of targeting
relationships even when known target pairs are rejected from those (it
is possible that some miRNA—mRNA pairs are targeting but failed to be
predicted by current methods), we constructed the randomized control data
by randomly choosing one miRNA from the initial targeting miRNAs set
of each regression model and resampling the observed miRNA levels in
different tissue samples. The original and resampled miRNA data were then
simultaneously put back to the initial miRNAs set that is to be applied to the
Lasso regression method. For each dataset, we repeated the randomization
procedure for 100 times recording the positive identiﬁcation numbers and the
corresponding rank scores. These distributions of rank scores of randomly
sampled and validated miRNAs were used to generate the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves to examine the performance of rank score in
classifying resampled miRNAs and real targeting miRNAs.

2.7 Network module enrichment evaluation

To evaluate the signiﬁcance of the miRNA—core modules, we constructed
10 000 random networks according to each real network recording the
occurrences and the size (number of nodes) of the miRNA—core modules.
Each random network has the identical number of miRNAs, mRNAs and
the relationships with the corresponding real network. The times that the
occurrence of a certain size of module in random networks is not less than
that of the real network were used to calculate the P—value of one module in
a real network.

 

3 RESULTS

3.1 Lasso regression model performs better in
miRNA-target identiﬁcation

To evaluate the effect of the Ago expression terms in the models,
we ﬁrst assessed the performances of regression models (1) and
(3) in identiﬁcation of miRNA—mRNA targeting relationships. We
used known target pairs and randomized control data to examine
the sensitivities and speciﬁcities of these two models in three real
miRNA/mRNA expression datasets as described in Section 2.4. We
repeatedly applied the two models to each dataset for 100 times,
and the ROC curves were plotted. As shown in Figure 1, in all three
datasets, model (3) performs better than model (1) both on sensitivity
and speciﬁcity when using 60 as a cut—off. The average areas under
the ROC curves (AUCs) of model (3) for the Broad, Madison and
MSKCC datasets were 0.75, 0.80 and 0.86, larger than the AUCs of
model (1), which were 0.72, 0.70 and 0.78, respectively. This result
demonstrates that combining Ago expression with miRNA/mRNA
expression data is helpful in improving the model performance on
identiﬁcation of miRNA—mRNA targeting pairs.

We next compared the performance of the Lasso regression
model with two other methods of the same type: the marginal
comparison method and the AIC—optimal regression model, each of
which also use miRNA/mRNA expression data to identify miRNA—
mRNA pairs. The Lasso regression model integrates sequence—based
prediction information, miRNA co—regulation and RISC availability
data; thus, we anticipated it would be able to identify more known
miRNA—mRNA pairs. We assessed the performances of these three
methods using three expression datasets. As shown in Table 1, of
the three datasets, the Lasso regression method (full set of selection)
identiﬁed a signiﬁcantly larger portion of known targeting pairs than
the other two methods. The mean true detection rate (TDR) of the
Lasso method for the three datasets was 43.7%, which is signiﬁcantly
higher than the mean TDRs for the marginal method (14.4%) and the
AIC—optimal regression method (26.8%). When only considering the
miRNAs whose rank scores were 260, a mean TDR of 32.3% across
the three datasets is obtained, which is still signiﬁcantly higher than

the TDR of the marginal method and slightly higher than that of the
AIC—optimal regression method. This result further demonstrates
that the Lasso regression model has higher sensitivity in detecting
miRNA—mRNA targeting pairs.

We then examined the speciﬁcities of these models. Because the
Lasso regression model employs L1 coefﬁcient constraints to select
variables, we anticipated that it would show higher speciﬁcity. We
found that, on average, ~61.0% of non—targeting controls are ﬁltered
out by the Lasso regression variable selection procedure through
directly setting their coefﬁcients as 0. The ROC plots (Fig. 1)
show that the rank score could well distinguish true targeting pairs
from the remaining non—zero coefﬁcient control pairs. By accepting
the miRNAs whose rank scores were 260, the global speciﬁcities
of the Lasso regression model for rejecting non—targeting control
pairs in three datasets were ~86, 86 and 97%. We note that the
speciﬁcity of the Lasso regression model is outstanding among the
three methods; the speciﬁcities of the AIC—optimal method, the
best previous method of the same type and the marginal method
were never >80% (Stanhope et al., 2009) for the same datasets.
Thus, it is clear that the Lasso regression model achieves signiﬁcant
improvements in both sensitivity and speciﬁcity for miRNA—target
identiﬁcation.

3.2 Constrained coefﬁcients in the Lasso model reﬂect
regulatory efﬁcacies

The Lasso regression model combines multiple potential competing
miRNAs in one regression model and imposes a constraint on their
coefﬁcients, which can provide more interpretable regression models
by ﬁltering out false positives and making the values of coefﬁcients
more biologically meaningful. We hypothesize that the constrained
coefﬁcients of miRNAs in the Lasso model may reﬂect their
regulatory efﬁcacies in the tissues studied. We tested this hypothesis
by classifying the predicted miRNAs based on their target site types,
which have been shown to have different levels of regulatory efﬁcacy
(Grimson et al., 2007; Nielsen et al., 2007). We considered three
major types of miRNA—mRNA target sites: 8mer, 7mer—m8 and
7mer—A] sites. To conduct reliable veriﬁcation and control noise, we
used the Lasso regression model to predict the targeting miRNAs
of the top 100 signiﬁcant mRNAs from the MSKCC dataset, which
has the largest sample size. All the predicted miRNA—mRNA pairs
were divided into three groups based on their binding site types:
the 8mer, 7mer—m8 and 7mer—A] groups, which were obtained from
the TargetScan database. Overall, we obtained 99 8mer site pairs,
163 7mer—m8 site pairs and 102 7mer—A] site pairs. Figure 2 shows
the notched boxplot of the normalized coefﬁcients distributions in

miRNAs were signiﬁcantly higher than for two 7mer sites, 7mer—m8
(P=2.531e—07) and 7mer—A] (P=6.191e—05), and the coefﬁcients
of the 7mer—m8 site were also signiﬁcantly higher than those of

the 7mer—A] site (P=0.01414). The statistical signiﬁcances were
calculated using the Mann—Whitney U test. These observations were
completely consistent with the characteristics of miRNA binding
efﬁcacy described by other groups using array data from miRNA
transfection and miRNA/Dicer knockout experiments (Grimson
et al., 2007; Nielsen et al., 2007). This result further supports our
hypothesis that the coefﬁcients of the Lasso regression model can be
used to estimate the regulatory efﬁcacy of miRNA—mRNA targeting
pairs.

3.3 Constructing the miRNA regulatory network using
the Lasso regression model

Because of the outstanding performance of the Lasso regression
model in identifying miRNA—mRNA targeting relationships and
reﬂecting real binding efﬁcacies of miRNAs in tissue cells, we
anticipated that the Lasso regression model could be a promising
tool for constructing miRNA regulatory networks. Therefore, we
constructed miRNA regulatory networks associated with PCa by
analysing the MSKCC dataset with the Lasso model. The tissue
samples of the MSKCC dataset were classiﬁed into three groups
based on their clinical information: normal (28 samples), primaries
(98 samples) and metastases (13 samples). Two miRNA regulatory
networks were constructed by comparing the normal and primaries
groups (also called Stage I of PCa) and the primaries and metastases
groups (Stage II of PCa). To make the networks more speciﬁc, we

only considered the signiﬁcant mRNAs (fold change 31.5, FDR 5
1.0e—06 and q 5 1.0e—06) for each pair of groups. These signiﬁcant
mRNAs were then processed by the Lasso regression procedure
to identify the miRNA—mRNA targeting relationships, and only
relationships with rank scores 260 were chosen to construct the
miRNA regulatory networks. The full networks are available in the
Supplementary Material.

We found that both networks were enriched with network modules
taking miRNA as a regulatory hub when compared with randomized
networks and these modules are involved in different biological
pathways (Table 2). Figure 3 shows the subnetworks of the miRNA
regulatory networks for two stages of PCa. In the subnetworks, we
only show the most signiﬁcant miRNA—hubbed network modules.
Interestingly, comparison of the enriched modules in two stages of
PCa revealed large differences, with more modules unique to each
network than shared between them. For example, 6 of the 10 modules
identiﬁed in Stage I (Normal versus Primaries) were not identiﬁed in
Stage II (Primaries versus Metastases), while 7 of 11 modules in the
Stage II network were not identiﬁed in Stage I network. In addition,
the four common modules shared by the two networks also vary
greatly in their targeted genes (as shown in Fig. 2). This reﬂects the
great variety of roles that hub miRNAs play in the two stages of PCa.
A recent study (Vallejo et al., 2011) has even demonstrated that hsa—
miR—200c, one of the unique hub miRNAs in the Stage I network,
could inhibit PCa metastasis by targeting several genes such as ZEB 1
that serve as biomarkers for PCa metastasis (Schmalhofer et al.,
2009). The signiﬁcant overexpression of hsa—miR—200c in the Stage I

network reveals its important role in the anti—metastasis process of
Stage I PCa. Another hub miRNA, hsa—miR—29b, identiﬁed in both
stages of PCa, was also reported to be associated with PCa metastasis
by inhibiting the expression of MMP—2 and COLlAl. Additionally,
many other hub miRNAs identiﬁed in these two networks have also
been reported to be associated with cancer metastasis (Table 2)
(Fu et al., 2011; Gebeshuber et al., 2009; Gregory et al., 2008;
Heinzelmann et al., 2011; Loayza—Puch et al., 2010; Slaby et al.,
2010; Steele et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2010; Takeshita et al., 2010;
Wang et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2010).

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this study, we proposed a Lasso regression model to identify
miRNA—mRNA targeting relationships, and we constructed miRNA
regulatory networks representing two stages of PCa progression. By
comparing our method with two other miRNA—target identiﬁcation
methods using three different datasets, we found that the Lasso
regression model has considerable advantages in terms of both
sensitivity and speciﬁcity. We also note that the regression
coefﬁcients in this model can be used to reﬂect the true regulatory
efﬁcacies in living cells, and we veriﬁed this hypothesis using
the miRNA target site type data. By constructing the miRNA
regulatory networks for two stages of PCa, we found that several
signiﬁcant miRNA—hubbed network modules are associated with
PCa metastasis. In conclusion, the Lasso regression model is a

very robust and informative tool for constructing complex disease—
related miRNA regulatory networks, which could provide useful
information for the diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases.

We note that the Lasso regression model performed better when
using the MSKCC dataset than when using the other two datasets.
One of the possible reasons is that we chose the PCa—associated
miRNA—mRNA targeting relationships as the known target pair set.
The expression levels of both miRNAs and mRNAs in these pairs
were signiﬁcantly altered in the tissue samples, which can greatly
reduce the inﬂuence of noise in the data. This indicates that the
variable dynamic range of miRNA and mRNA expression levels
can affect the accuracy of miRNA—mRNA targeting relationship
identiﬁcation, and it suggests that identiﬁcation methods based on
expression data might be further improved if the rates of change in
expression levels were considered.

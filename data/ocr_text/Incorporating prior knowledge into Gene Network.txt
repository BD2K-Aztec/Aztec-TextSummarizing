ABSTRACT

Motivation: A major goal in genomic research is to identify genes that
may jointly influence a biological response. From many years of inten-
sive biomedical research, a large body of biological knowledge, or
pathway information, has accumulated in available databases. There
is a strong interest in leveraging these pathways to improve the
statistical power and interpretability in studying gene networks asso-
ciated with complex phenotypes. This prior information is a valuable
complement to large-scale genomic data such as gene expression
data generated from microarrays. However, it is a non-trivial task to
effectively integrate available biological knowledge into gene expres-
sion data when reconstructing gene networks.

Results: In this article, we developed and applied a Lasso method
from a Bayesian perspective, a method we call prior Lasso (pLasso),
for the reconstruction of gene networks. In this method, we partition
edges between genes into two subsets: one subset of edges is pre-
sent in known pathways, whereas the other has no prior information
associated. Our method assigns different prior distributions to each
subset according to a modified Bayesian information criterion that
incorporates prior knowledge on both the network structure and the
pathway information. Simulation studies have indicated that the
method is more effective in recovering the underlying network than
a traditional Lasso method that does not use the prior information. We
applied pLasso to microarray gene expression datasets, where we
used information from the Pathway Commons (PC) and the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) as prior information
for the network reconstruction, and successfully identified network
hub genes associated with clinical outcome in cancer patients.

1 INTRODUCTION

A central research focus in genomics is to identify genes and gene
networks involved in variety of biological processes. Gaussian
graphical models are popular tools for the estimation of gene
association networks from microarray data (Dobra et al., 2004;
Lauritzen, 1996; Schafer and Strimmer, 2005). These models
assume that the available data are generated from a multivariate

Gaussian distribution Whittaker, 1990). As a consequence, the
main task for inferring networks is to derive conditional inde-
pendencies in the joint probability distribution of expression data
for multiple genes. In the framework of undirected Gaussian
graphical models, conditional independence relationships can
be inferred from partial correlations, which are the correlations
between pairs of variables given the remaining observed ones.
Contrary to the marginal correlation, the partial correlation
measures the direct association between two genes in the gene
association network. Once a direct gene association network is
complete, the knowledge on indirect gene associations can be
easily obtained.

The standard estimation of partial correlations involves either
the inversion of the sample covariance matrix or the estimation of
least square regression problems. Unfortunately, microarray data
are typically characterized by a large number of variables with a
small number of samples, which makes these traditional
approaches inappropriate. To ensure proper estimation capabil-
ity, suitable alternatives based on regularized estimation of these
parameters by sparsity restriction have been proposed. The under-
lying assumption is the sparsity of biological networks: only a few
edges are supposed to be present in the gene regulatory network.
A well-known example of these regularization-based techniques is
the L1 penalized least square estimator, known as the Lasso tech-
nique. The method has been widely adapted to high-dimensional
model selection in linear and Gaussian graphical models
(Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2006; Tibshirani, 1996).

One limitation of these approaches is that they focus on com-
putational or algorithmic aspects but neglect prior biological
knowledge or information. Many years of intensive biomedical
research has deposited a wealth of biological knowledge into
databases, including gene—gene regulatory pathway information.
One well-known example of these data resources is the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database
(Kanehisa et al., 2010). It is a collection of comprehensive path-
way information derived from experimental results, literature
and other databases. Another rich resource is the Pathway
Commons (PC) that integrates biological pathway and
molecular interaction data from publicly available databases
including BioGRID, HPRD, Reactome and others (Cerami
et al., 2011). These pathways are often interconnected and can
be viewed as a graph of inter-gene regulatory relationships.
However, pathway databases represent only the static regulatory
relationships between genes or gene products. It is not clear yet
to what extent a network in a particular phenotype or cell type
aligns with interactions deﬁned in these databases. A recent

microarray data analysis of 20 genes involved with the human
cell cycle showed that as much as 60—70% of the identiﬁed gene
regulatory relationships were in agreement with known regula-
tions (Chen et al., 2010). It is expected that integrating a priori
pathway information in a gene expression analysis would
increase the power of the method to recover biological networks.
Recently, several methods have been developed to use pathways
or network information, including network-constrained param-
eter estimation, in the framework of variable selection (Chen
et al., 2011; Li and Li, 2008; Tai and Pan, 2007a, b; Wei and
Pan, 2008). For example, the prior information was incorporated
into a spatially correlated mixture model for selecting targets of
one transcription factor (Wei and Pan, 2008). In addition, an
Ising model using network knowledge was used to identify dif-
ferentially expressed genes (Li et al., 2011; Wei and Li, 2007).

In this study, we developed a prior information-dependent
Lasso (pLasso) procedure for regularized estimation of large-
scale gene association networks. Speciﬁcally, we embedded
prior network information into the regularized regression, such
that it could specify preferences for particular sets of variables in
the model. The rationale is derived from a Bayesian perspective of
Lasso. A mixture of two Laplacian distributions was conceptually
proposed to represent different prior knowledge of two sets of
gene interactions: one set is present in known pathways, whereas
the other has no known prior information. We first explored the
effectiveness of the pLasso using simulation studies, and then
applied the pLasso to a breast cancer dataset and an ovarian
cancer dataset to evaluate the proposed method. We have demon-
strated the effectiveness and power of our pLasso procedure
through both simulation studies and real data analysis.

2 METHODS

2.1 Graphical Gaussian model of gene network

Graphical models are a class of statistical models that present direct
covariate interactions. These models can be described by means of a
graph G: ( V, E j, where V={I,....., p} is the vertex set representing
variables, and E: (eij) is the edge set representing conditional indepen-
dency relations between vertices. If 6,]: 0, there is no edge between two
vertices i and j. The lack of an edge between two vertices corresponds
to their conditional independence given all other vertices. Let
X=(X Xp) be a random vector of vertices states that are real
valued and follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean 0
and covariance matrix 2, so the inverse covariance matrix, Q = 2‘1 =
{my} known as the precision matrix, describes the conditional independ-
ence structure of X. If 6,]:0, then (oil-=0. Therefore, it can be easily
linked to the partial correlation ,0 in the graphical model through
Equation (1).
wij

pi]- is the partial correlation between gene 1' and gene j conditioned on the
values of all the other genes. The pattern of zero entries in the inverse
covariance matrix corresponds to conditional independence restrictions
between variables.

pi} = — (1)

2.2 Neighborhood selection with the Lasso

In general, a typical genomic dataset has a much smaller number of
observations (n arrays) than number of variables (p genes). Under these
conditions, inverting the sample covariance matrix as described is

inappropriate for estimating the partial correlations. A recent study
showed that suitable surrogates based on regularized estimation of the
covariance matrix or on regularized high-dimensional regression can lead
to practical solutions (Kramer et al., 2009; Meinshausen and Buhlmann,
2006; Parikh et al., 2011). In this study, we will use Meinshausen and
Buhlmann’s neighborhood selection method. Basically, Lasso regression
is applied to each node in the network, reducing the original problem to
multiple sparse linear regression problems.

Formally, let X, indicate the 17—1 vector of the values of all genes
except 1'. Similarly, let ,8“) 2 (,Ba), ..., i391, ..., ﬁg)? represent the regres-
sion coefﬁcients where gene 1' is the response variable and all the other
genes are the covariates. The lasso-based estimate of regression coefﬁ-
cients is the solution of the optimization problem:

3“) = arg [3113,13, 11X“) — Wm 12 +1203) (2)

where p(,B) = ALBI = A  1:311
1 I

Here A > 0 is the regularization parameter. This optimization problem can
be easily solved by a coordinate descent algorithm (Friedman et al., 2010).
Then, the neighborhood estimation of node j is deﬁned by Equation (3).

ﬁej = {k E V; 75 0} (3)

Also, based on the relationship between partial correlation coefﬁcients
and regression coefﬁcients, the following equation can be derived

(Kramer et al., 2009).

With the L1 penalty, many estimated regression coefﬁcients will shrink to
0. It is not guaranteed that the i919.) and  always have the same sign for

ﬁnite sample sizes. In this situation, we applied the ‘max’ symmetrization
approach (Parikh et al., 2011), which is deﬁned by Equation (5).

" é?) : if WI <13?) (5)

And now by replacing both the ,8? and  in Equation (4) with ’32”, we
can deﬁne the estimate of the partial correlation coefﬁcients as in
Equation (6).

2.3 Prior dependent lasso estimation of neighborhood

The lasso estimate for linear regression has a Bayesian interpretation.
Tibshirani (1996) indicated that the lasso estimate can be viewed as the
model of the posterior distribution of ,8 with a double exponential dis-
tributed prior (or Laplacian prior). Minimizing Equation (2) can be
regarded as maximizing the log posterior distribution of

17(3IX) ~ Cexp{—; (“X”) — XWIIM 21/310} (7)
j

where C is a constant in Equation (7). Thus, the lasso penalty can be
regarded as the logarithm of the prior distribution of the parameter
,8 = ( ,8 1,. . ., ,Bp) T, which is a Laplacian prior with mean equal to 0.

Because prior distributions model our prior knowledge of the data, the
known network structure can be introduced in a natural way in the form
of prior probabilities. A mixture of two Laplacian prior distributions for
the regression coefﬁcients is proposed as in Equation (8) with different
parameters 2.1 and 2.2.

Incorporating prior knowledge into Gene Network Study

 

Here A] and A2 are regularization parameters. 13,,0,,_pr,-0r and ,Bprior represent
the regression coefﬁcients corresponding to the edges absent and present
in the prior knowledge. The prior distribution of regression coefﬁcients
for the edges not present in known databases is concentrated. Because of
the sparsity assumption, most of these regression coefﬁcients shrink to 0.
On the other hand, the prior distribution of regression coefﬁcients
corresponding to existing edges in the known databases is diffuse.
Their regression coefﬁcient proﬁle is scattered away from zero, as it is
preferable to include the regression coefﬁcients representing the known
gene interactions from reliable data source. In our proposed pLasso
method, we selected different values of the regularized parameter A
(A1 and A2) in two lasso penalty terms, thus allowing the lasso regression
coefﬁcients corresponding to the edges absent and present in the prior
knowledge to have different prior distributions.

2.4 A new criterion for regularization parameter selection

Asymptotically, Lasso guarantees both model estimation consistency and
selection consistency under certain conditions (Zhao and Yu, 2006). The
regularization parameter A controls the sparsity of the estimated network.
Large values of A lead to sparse networks, whereas small values of A result
in dense networks. Sparse networks have less number of degrees of
freedom, but lower log-likelihood. Bayesian information criterion (BIC)
is a well-known model selection criterion (Schwarz, 1978). We apply BIC
for choosing the regularization parameter A that is a tradeoff between the
data ﬁtting and the model complexity. Taking into account the fact that
the degree of freedom of the Lasso equals the number of non-zero entries
in the coefﬁcient matrix, we deﬁne an average of the BIC score for all
genes for neighborhood estimation.

BIC = —210g L(X|,B) + klog n — 210g P(S) (9)

Here, the ﬁrst term L( X | ,8) represents the likelihood of the data. In the
second term, 11 is the sample size; k is the average node degree of the
network, calculated by the number of non-zero entries in the estimated
coefﬁcient matrix. In the last term, logP( S j is the prior probability of the
network model S. A smaller BIC score implies a better model. Usually,
the prior probability logP( S j in the BIC score is chosen to be an unin-
forrnative uniform prior so that the same prior probability is assigned to
all considered models. In this study, we use an informative prior
incorporating both our knowledge on network sparsity and the prior
information in known databases, deﬁned as the Equations (10) and
(11) below.

As an asymptotic result, the original BIC score deﬁnition is derived for
large samples. In a typical genomic dataset where n<< p, we found the
original BIC deﬁnition often resulted in data underﬁtting and an over-
sparse network. To address this issue, we ﬁrst deﬁne the prior probability
that favors the network with an optimal minimum number of edges. In
this modiﬁed BIC (mBIC) score, q represents the minimum average node
degree of the estimated network. When the estimated network has an
average node degree of k bigger than q, it has no effect on the score.
Otherwise, an extra penalty is imposed into the framework, deﬁned as the
following:

mBIC = —210g L(X|,B) + klog n + (max(q — k, 0)) logn (10)

where the third term depicts a form for the prior probability that favors
the network S with an average node degree above q.

We also deﬁne a second modiﬁed BIC (pBIC) score that takes into
account the prior pathway information for selecting the optimal value of
the regularization parameter A2. The rationale underlying the pBIC score
is, if the estimated edges are also present in the known databases, a fa-
vorable prior distribution will be assigned, leading to a lower BIC score.
In the pBIC, 77 is deﬁned as the average number of estimated edges
included in prior information for each node and calculated as
77: | E ﬂEPn-orl/p, where p is the number of genes, E is the set of edges
in the inferred network and Elm-0r is the set of edges in the prior. We let 0:

represent the precision of the prior knowledge, indicating the proportion
of true edges in prior information. To further compensate the false-posi-
tive edges in E and Eprior, we use the multiplicity term any to denote the
effective number of true prior edges recovered in the estimated network.
Therefore, the complexity of the model in BIC is balanced with respect to
the total number of possibly correct prior edges recovered in the esti-
mated network. We have found that this simple prior representation
could reﬂect the information within the prior knowledge, favoring the
estimated network models with a large number of edges included in prior
information.

pBIC = —210g L(X|,B) + klogn + (max(q — k, 0)) log n — omlog n
(11)

2.5 Evaluate the inferred gene network hubs

To evaluate the performance of the pLasso method, we applied it to two
public datasets for network inference. The ﬁrst dataset was a microarray
gene expression study of breast cancer (Wang et al., 2005), measuring
gene expression proﬁles of 286 lymph-node-negative breast cancer
patients. Among these patients, 107 patients have developed a distant
metastasis, whereas 179 patients are metastasis-free. The second dataset
was the serous ovarian cancer data by The Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network (2011). It includes gene expression measurements for
436 patient samples, where 108 patients had remained disease-free and
328 patients experienced disease progression.

We tested whether the gene network hubs inferred from the proposed
pLasso method could be used to predict survival outcomes of cancer
patients. We also compared their performance with those obtained
from other methods that were based on genome-wide expression data
alone. The methods for comparison included the differential expression
analysis (Signiﬁcant Analysis of Microarrays, known as SAM) (Storey
and Tibshirani, 2003), the partial correlation analysis (GeneNet) (Opgen-
Rhein and Strimmer, 2007) and the original Lasso method. The genes
were selected if they were among the top genes with most neighbors in the
inferred network for patients showing distant metastasis but not in the
network for the metastasis-free patients (based on pLasso, Lasso and
GeneNet methods) or the most signiﬁcantly differentiated expressed
genes (SAM). We also compared the predictive power of the selected
genes with the gene signatures identiﬁed previously, including the 76
genes for breast cancer (Wang et al., 2005) and the 193 genes for ovarian
cancer (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011). To make a
fair comparison, we selected the same number of genes under different
methods (76 genes and 193 genes for breast cancer and ovarian cancer
analysis, respectively). For breast cancer analysis, we used the 214 pa-
tients’ samples from the Wang dataset for training and then applied an
independent dataset, including 165 patients who did not receive hormone
therapy or chemotherapy, for testing the predictive power of the selected
gene signature for survival outcome (van de Vijver et al., 2002). For
ovarian cancer analysis, we used a training set of 215 patients from
TCGA batches 11—15, and tested in an independent validation set con-
sisting of 253 samples from TCGA batches 17—24. We performed the
univariate Cox’s analysis on the selected genes in the training dataset,
and used the Cox’s regression coefﬁcients for these genes to calculate the
risk score for each sample in the testing dataset as in Creighton et a].
(2008). Speciﬁcally, the genes with positive Cox’s regression coefﬁcients
were considered to be ‘poor prognosis’ genes, whereas others were con-
sidered as the ‘good prognosis’ genes. The risk score for each patient in
the testing datasets was deﬁned as the t-statistics comparing the average
of the poor prognosis genes with the average of the good prognosis genes.
Patient samples with risk scores above 0 were predicted to be in the ‘high—
risk group’, whereas others were classiﬁed in the ‘low-risk group’. The
sensitivity and speciﬁcity of prediction results based on selected genes
from different methods were then compared.

3 SIMULATION RESULTS

To demonstrate the performance of the proposed pLasso
method, we conducted simulation studies to empirically compare
our method with the traditional Lasso method (Meinshausen
and Buhlmann, 2006). In the experiment, we designed two simu-
lation scenarios on different network scales. The ﬁrst simulated
network is a small network with 40 nodes, an average node
degree of 4, a maximum degree of 6. The 80 (40*4/2) edges
were randomly assigned to the 780 (40*39/2) node pairs with
the limit that the maximum node degree is not exceeded.
According to this network structure, we simulate its associated
gene-expression datasets similar to others (Kramer et al., 2009;
Parikh et al., 2011).

Basically, we ﬁrst constructed a positive deﬁnite partial cor-
relation matrix P based on the simulated network. Then the
microarray gene expression data were simulated from a standard
multivariate normal distribution with correlation structure
derived from P with each gene having 10, 100 and 200 replicates
so that we could further investigate the effect of sample size on
the performance of our method. Our second simulation scenario
has a larger network with 300 nodes and 900 edges, an average
degree of 6, a maximum degree of 12. Each gene was simulated
with 10, 100 and 200 replicates. We ﬁrst screened the optimal
value of A1 using both BIC and mBIC criteria to compare their
effectiveness on the original Lasso performance. To accommo-
date the model complexity at different network scales, we set the
q value of mBIC score to 2 and 4 in the small and large network
scenarios, respectively, and evaluated these estimation
results using an F—score, where F: 2*Precision*Recall/
(Precision+ Recall). Here precision is the proportion of predic-
tion results that are true positives, and recall is the proportion of
true positives that are predicted, also known as the true positive
rate. The F—score can be interpreted as a weighted average of the
precision and recall, and reaches its best value at 1 and worst
score at 0. We reported its average and standard error based on
100 simulated datasets for each scenario. As shown in Table 1, if
the simulation scenario was in the n> p setting (e. g. p: 40,
n = 100 and 200), it possessed the same optimal A1 values
based on BIC and mBIC screening, and their performance eval-
uated by the F—score was identical. However, in the p > n setting,
Lasso with BIC reached its optimal A1 value with severe network
sparsity, whereas Lasso with mBIC led to a larger number of true
edges in the identiﬁed network and a higher F—score. The results
demonstrated the effectiveness of our mBIC in addressing the
problem of data underﬁtting, especially in the scenarios of
larger networks with smaller sample sizes.

In real situations, the true underlying network is only partially
known in our prior knowledge and is mixed with spurious edges.
To investigate the performance of our pLasso method with im-
perfect prior information, we have simulated prior information
with different precision levels varying from 0.1 to 1.0. The total
number of edges in the prior data was set equal to the number of
edges in the true underlying network. Therefore, a precision level
of 0.1 indicates that 10% of the edges in prior are true edges,
whereas the other 90% are spurious ones, and a precision level of
1.0 indicates a perfect prior with all true edges included. To in-
corporate the prior information, the network recovery method
pLasso was implemented to search over a sequence of u from 0

to 1.2 with an increment of 0.1 to get the optimal A2, where
A2=,u.*A1. The optimal A2 value was obtained when the min-
imum pBIC score was achieved. The parameter A1 used in
pLasso was set the same as that in the original Lasso approach
based on the mBIC criterion.

Results in Figure 1 demonstrated that in all simulation scen-
arios, combining prior knowledge with higher precision in
pLasso led to a higher F—score. Nevertheless, we found
F—scores from pLasso were consistently higher than those from
a traditional Lasso method. Even when the precision of the prior
was as low as 0.1, pLasso achieved an F—score comparable with
or slightly higher than the Lasso method for all the simulation
scenarios. Obviously, the precision of prior knowledge is import-
ant in determining the optimal value of A2, as deﬁned in the
Equation (11), and thus affects the performance of pLasso. As
shown in the Supplementary Table S1, the lower precision of
prior knowledge, the larger value of A2 will be obtained, indicat-
ing the penalty on the prior is large. Particularly, when only 10%
of edges in the prior were true edges (precision level is 0.1), the
optimal 1.1 based on pBIC was close to 1.0 for the simulated
network, leading to a large A2. This suggested the edges in the
prior information get a large penalty, thus reducing the likeli-
hood of including low quality prior knowledge in the network
inference process. On the other hand, if the precision of the prior
information was high, the corresponding optimal A2 (u) value
would be low, indicating that the penalty on the prior knowledge
was small. Therefore, even though we often cannot obtain per-
fect prior information, our approach helps to distinguish the true
edges from the spurious ones, and outperforms a traditional
Lasso method that neglects prior information.

Figure 1 also demonstrated pLasso performance under differ-
ent simulation scenarios, including different network sizes ([9)
and sample sizes (n). Performance is affected by both factors.
In the simulation scenarios where n> p, the traditional Lasso
itself was able to achieve an optimal performance with a high
F—score (0.69 and 0.80 for p: 40, n = 100 and 200, respectively).

Fig. 1. Performance of pLasso with prior information provided at differ-
ent precision levels

With the pLasso method, a relatively large value of A2 (1.1) was
selected, which restricted the addition of edges present in the
prior, and the overall performance did not signiﬁcantly improve
unless the precision of the prior was high (Supplementary
Table S1). On the other hand, in the simulation scenarios
where p>n, the original Lasso without incorporating prior in-
formation performed poorly because of the small sample size
effect. In this setting, the advantage of our pLasso method is
most obvious, as demonstrated by the performance improvement
when the prior information was incorporated even if the prior
precision level was low (Fig. 1).

In our simulation studies, the precision (05) of prior used in
pBIC score calculation was provided. However, this is often not
the case in real data application. Therefore, we can only use an
estimated or value in the Equation (9) for choosing the optimal
regularization parameter A2 and inferring the network. To inves-
tigate the effects of or on the performance of our method, we
varied the estimated value of or between 0 to 1 for each true
value of oz (0.1, 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9). It was demonstrated that in
the large network of 300 genes with each gene having 100
samples, the performance was affected in the extreme case, if
we estimated the precision 05 to be 1 while the true precision
was only 0.1. However, if the estimated or was within a reason-
able small range of the true or values, our method performance
was relatively robust to the selection of estimated 05 (Table 2).
This conclusion was demonstrated to be valid in other simulation
scenarios as well (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).

4 APPLICATION TO ANALYSIS OF CANCER GENE
EXPRESSION DATA

4.1 Breast cancer data

In the analysis of breast cancer data, our interest is to investigate
the gene regulatory networks of two types of breast cancer pa-
tients, the metastasis-free group and the group with metastases.
Because the performance of Lasso and pLasso are sensitive to the
sample size, we only used 107 of 179 metastasis-free patients so
that the sample size of the metastasis-free group is the same as that
of the patients with metastases. We used a prior gene network

compiled from the KEGG database and the PC web resource,
which yielded a network with 11 211 genes and 97 128 edges. To
make the computation less intensive, we only applied our method
to the set of genes included in our prior knowledge. In the experi-
ment, mBIC with a q value of 5 was used to search over the op-
tima1A1 value based on the observation that the node degree is on
the order of 2 to 10 edges per node (Alon, 2006). With traditional
Lasso method, the inferred network from patients with metastases
had 21 360 edges. For the pLasso setting, we set the precision of
the prior knowledge to 0.6, as we expect that 60—70% of the edges
present in the prior knowledge would align with the interactions in
the true network corresponding to breast cancer samples (Chen
et al., 2010). Both patient groups resulted in networks with similar
number of edges. In the groups of patients with metastases, we
inferred a network with 5187 genes and 29 821 edges, whereas the
metastasis-free patient group yielded a network with 5106 genes
and 29 364 edges.

Figure 2 gives an example showing the difference between the
inferred networks from the Lasso and pLasso approaches in pa-
tients with metastases. The metastatic progression of breast
cancer is directly caused by the disregulation of numerous cellu-
lar signaling pathways. The mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine
protein kinase BUBl beta (BUBlB), has been known to be es-
sential in the mitotic checkpoint during normal mitosis progres-
sion. Recently, an analysis on multiple public datasets of gene
expression discovered that BUBlB is associated with early dis-
tant metastases in breast cancer (Gusev et al., 2013). Here we
took BUBlB and its neighbors to exemplify the inferred network
structure difference in breast cancer patients with metastases
(Fig. 2). In this group of patients, BUBlB possessed a higher
node degree in the pLasso-inferred network (34) than that in the
Lasso-inferred network (19). We found 26 of 42 edges present in
the prior knowledge were included in the pLasso-inferred net-
work, whereas only 7 edges in the prior were recovered in the
Lasso-inferred network. As expected, one effect of incorporating
prior knowledge is the inclusion of more edges from the prior. In
addition to this effect, because of the nature of Lasso’s linear
regression, addition of edges from the prior will yield informa-
tion on the conditional independence between other edges. This
could trigger the elimination of spurious edges in the estimated
network, as seen in this application, where we found 4 edges
inferred by the Lasso method were not present in the network
inferred by the pLasso (Fig. 2).

To evaluate the performance of our method, we examined the
100 hub genes having most neighbors in the inferred network of
patients showing distant metastasis, but not in the other group of
metastasis-free patients. Among the 214 lymph—node-negative
breast cancer patients we used to construct the gene networks,
107 showed evidence of distant metastasis and were considered
as failure in our distant-metastasis-free survival analysis. For
each of the hub genes we investigated, we divided the patients
into two equal groups based on their expression values of the
hub genes: the high-expression group and the low-expression
group. We expected that for some of these hubs, the two
groups would exhibit signiﬁcant differences in their distant me-
tastasis-free survival outcome. To test this hypothesis, we used
the ‘Survival’ package in R to calculate the Kaplan—Meier sur-
vival curves. For each hub, its statistical signiﬁcance was deter-
mined by controlling the false discovery rate at 0.2 with the

Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing procedure for the P-
values obtained from log-rank tests (Benjamini and Hochberg,
1995). Based on this signiﬁcance criterion, we found that the
gene expression values of 18% of hubs were signiﬁcantly asso-
ciated with breast cancer patient outcomes. For the networks
inferred from original Lasso method, the expression values of
13% of hubs showed signiﬁcant association with breast cancer
outcome. As the control, only 8 :l:2% of 100 randomly selected
genes demonstrated the signiﬁcant association between their ex-
pression values and the breast cancer patient outcome.

4.2 Ovarian cancer data

As we did with the breast cancer data, we used a prior gene
network compiled from the KEGG database and the PC as
prior knowledge in our network inference. For the pLasso set-
ting, we also set the precision of the prior knowledge to 0.6. We
investigated the gene networks of patients with progressed
disease and the disease/progression-free patients. In the group
of patients with progressed disease, the inferred network had
4636 genes and 25 836 edges, whereas the disease-free patient
group yielded a network with 4630 genes and 25 673 edges.

Disease-free survival analysis on the hub genes from the inferred
networks was performed. We found 22% of hubs were signiﬁ-
cantly associated with ovarian cancer disease-free survival out-
come (FDR correct q<0.2). As a comparison, only 18% the
hubs obtained from the original Lasso method and 5:l:2%
random genes demonstrated signiﬁcant association between
their expression values and the ovarian cancer survival outcome.

4.3 Comparison with other methods

Given the clear association between a subset of inferred network
hubs with prognosis for both breast cancer patients and ovarian
cancer patients, we further determined if a list of selected gene
hubs can be used to predict survival outcome and compared
their performance with those obtained from other methods that
were based on genome-wide expression data alone. As described
in Section 2.5, we calculated the risk score for each patient based
on the selected genes. The patients were then divided into two
groups based on their risk scores. Kaplan—Meier survival analyses
on two patient groups were performed and showed the selected
genes from the breast cancer and the ovarian cancer networks
inferred by the pLasso method were signiﬁcantly associated

(Fig. 3).

The univariate Cox proportional analysis of the gene signa-
tures identiﬁed from different methods for survival outcome and
the predictive power of these genes in the validation dataset were
compared and summarized in Table 3. It was demonstrated that
the genes selected from our pLasso method yielded the highest
sensitivity (0.81 and 0.69 for breast cancer and ovarian cancer
analysis, respectively) among others at a comparable speciﬁcity
level. We should also note that, whereas the pLasso method
effectively identiﬁed individual genes with signiﬁcant predictive
power for survival outcome, it also provided information on
gene network topology and the relationship among genes. Our
pLasso method is effective in inferring clinically signiﬁcant net-
works, as demonstrated by the predictive power of the network
hubs and their signiﬁcant association with patients’ prognosis.
We also investigated the overlap between the gene signatures
from pLasso with those previously identiﬁed. We found only 4

and 5 genes overlapped with the 76-gene signature and the
193-gene signature corresponding to breast cancer and ovarian
cancer, respectively. It indicated that the pLasso method was
effective in identifying novel genes that can serve as potential
markers for prognosis prediction.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Inferring gene networks in a high-dimensional data framework is
never a trivial problem. Particularly, the noise inherent in the
measurements always dampens the power of making inferences
on a genome scale. Therefore, using only gene expression data
will not likely be sufﬁcient. Recent techniques attempt to inte-
grate additional data sources or introduce constraints to help
guide the inference procedure. Motivated by the application of
incorporating prior pathway and network structure information
into the analysis of genomic data, we have taken advantage of
the Lasso method and its apparent Bayesian perspective in the
Gaussian graphic framework. Taking into account that validated
gene interactions in prior should occur at a much higher fre-
quency compared with undocumented interactions in real
networks, we partition edges in a graphical model into two sub-
sets—a known gene interaction group and an unknown gene
interaction group, and then assign the former group with a smal-
ler regularization parameter in Lasso regression compared with
the other group. Implemented in neighborhood selection with
Lasso, the proposed method was shown to have better perform-
ance in recovering network structures compared with the
traditional Lasso in our simulated studies and real data analysis.

Lasso is a model selection method shown to be consistent in
variable selection under certain conditions (Zhao and Yu, 2006).
Its consistency is highly dependent on the right choice of the
penalty parameter. In practical implementation, the penalty par-
ameter is typically tuned to achieve optimal prediction accuracy
based on cross-validation (CV). However, this procedure was
shown not to be consistent in terms of variable selection, with
a potential overﬁtting effect in the resulting model (Meinshausen
and Buhlmann, 2006; Wang et al., 2007). This problem will be
vastly exaggerated when the sparsity of the network is assumed
in the domain of biological network inference. On the other
hand, BIC is a well-known model selection criterion, which
tends to favor parsimonious models. The comparison of CV
and BIC for optimal regularized parameter selection in network
inference demonstrated that BIC preferentially resulted in sparse
networks and had less overﬁtting effect than CV (Supplementary
Table S4). The results are consistent with those in the previous
study (Wang et al., 2007). We also deﬁned a BIC score that
incorporated our prior knowledge on network sparsity to ad-
dress the network over sparsity issue of the original BIC, espe-
cially in the setting of large networks with small sample sizes
(n < p). mBIC was shown to have less overﬁtting effect than
CV, while consistently outperforming CV in identifying true net-
work edges (Supplementary Table S4). Compared with a CV-
based method, the modiﬁed form of BIC presents advantages
of considering the data ﬁtting during model selection, being
more straightforward to compute and more easily to incorporate
prior knowledge, and providing better performance in network
inference. Therefore, BIC and its modiﬁed forms were adopted in
our study to select the optimal regularization parameter.

Our proposed pLasso method is conceptually analogous to
some other approaches that use a mixture of prior distributions
to represent the gene interactions absent and present in the prior
knowledge, respectively (Tai and Pan, 2007a, b; Wei and Pan,
2008). However, our approach is different in that we took ad-
vantage of the Bayesian perspective of the lasso procedure and
modeled the Laplacian prior distributions for the regression co-
efﬁcients between genes by specifying different values of the reg-
ularized parameter in lasso penalty terms. Although the
importance of incorporating prior knowledge into analysis has
been widely recognized, there seems to be few studies in using the
lasso penalty terms to differentiate the gene interactions absent
and present in the prior knowledge. Out study is also clearly
different from other approaches in terms of its application
domain. It is performed in the framework of Gaussian graphical
model for inferring a genome-wide gene association network,
whereas most other applications incorporating prior information
focused on classiﬁcation analysis (Tai and Pan, 2007a, b), detect-
ing differential gene expression (Li and Li, 2008; Wei and Li,
2007) or identifying transcription factor targets in a small scale
(Wei and Pan, 2008).

In our real data analysis, we used the prior knowledge compiled
from the KEGG database and the PC web resource. Both KEGG
and PC represent an incomplete recapitulation of the true under-
lying network and may contain some irrelevant interactions. To
improve the level of completeness of the prior knowledge, it is
natural to combine the information from both resources for net-
work inference. The quality of the prior is another contributing
factor to the method performance. Taking into account the rela-
tive robustness of our method to the estimated precision level of
the prior (Table 2), we used the same precision rates in the appli-
cation of KEGG and PC prior information. It was demonstrated
that using the combined prior information from PC and KEGG
yielded a network with more genes and edges than using either the
PC or KEGG alone, while achieving better performance in pre-
dicting clinical outcome in both the breast cancer and the ovarian
cancer datasets (Supplementary Table S5). It was also observed
when using KEGG alone as the prior, the performance of the
pLasso was not as good as that using PC alone or using the
combined prior. These results suggest the coverage of prior know-
ledge is a more signiﬁcant contributing factor to the method per-
formance than the quality in this real data application. Based on
these results, it is expected the pLasso method lends itself a po-
tential improvement of performance as our knowledge of path-
ways accumulates over time and an increasing amount of prior
knowledge gets incorporated into the analysis.

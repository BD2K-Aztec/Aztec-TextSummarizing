ABSTRACT

Motivation: Phylogenetics, or reconstructing the evolutionary relation-
ships of organisms, is critical for understanding evolution. A large
number of heuristic algorithms for phylogenetics have been de-
veloped, some of which enable estimates of trees with tens of thou-
sands of taxa. Such trees may not be robust, as small changes in the
input data can cause major differences in the optimal topology. Tools
that can assess the quality and stability of phylogenetic tree estimates
and identify the most reliable parts of the tree are needed.

Results: We define measures that assess the stability of trees, sub-
trees and individual taxa with respect to changes in the input se-
quences. Our measures consider changes at the finest granularity in
the input data (i.e. individual nucleotides). We demonstrate the effect-
iveness of our measures on large published datasets. Our measures
are computationally feasible for phylogenetic datasets consisting of
tens of thousands of taxa.

1 INTRODUCTION

Phylogenetics, or reconstructing the evolutionary history of or-
ganisms, is important for many areas of biological research.
Rapid increases in the amount of available sequence data and
computational advances have enabled construction of phylogen-
etic trees with tens of thousands of species (e.g. Goloboff et al.,
2009; Price et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2011). However, it often is
difﬁcult to assess the quality and reliability of large phylogenetic
trees. An ideal method for assessing tree quality should be com-
putationally tractable for extremely large datasets, quantify the
conﬁdence in relationships within the tree and compare the qual-
ity of the best tree to alternate trees. In this article, we describe a
novel method for computing the stability of phylogenetic trees.
We say that a tree is stable if its topology is largely robust to
small changes in the input data used to infer the tree. Conversely,
unstable trees may be subject to major structural changes with
only a few alterations in the input data.

Often the quality of trees is determined using nodal support
measures, such as non-parametric bootstrapping (Felsenstein,
1985), jackkniﬁng (Farris et al., 1996), relative support
(Goloboff and Farris, 2001) or Bayesian posterior probabilities
(Huelsenbeck et al., 2000). These methods assess a large number

of trees that represent a range of possible solutions. Perhaps, the
most commonly used method is the non-parametric bootstrap-
ping (Felsenstein, 1985). This method builds a collection of trees
from pseudoreplicate datasets obtained by sampling with re-
placement from the original dataset. Because the phylogenetic
analysis has to be repeated for each bootstrap replicate, it can
be computationally expensive for large datasets; bootstrap ana-
lysis of tens of thousands of sequences can take years of proces-
sing time (Liu et al., 2009). Also, the bootstrap methods consider
only a few of the possible alterations in the input data. The
Bremer support or decay index (Bremer, 1988, 1994) measures,
for all groups in the tree, the minimum number of additional
parsimony steps needed to ﬁnd a tree without that group. This is
similar to a stability measure. However, it does not examine how
similar the alternate suboptimal topologies are to the original
tree. Several recent methods (Aberer and Stamatakis, 2011;
Aberer et al., 2011; Pattengale et al., 2011) seek to identify
“rogue taxa’ (Sanderson and Shaffer, 2002), or taxa that
cannot be placed reliably anywhere in the tree.

The issue of stability of phylogenetic trees has been proposed
in the past (Donoghue and Ackerly, 1996; Giribet, 2003). In
other areas of research, ‘what-if’ analyses have been discussed
under the name of “post-optimality analysis’ or “sensitivity ana-
lysis’ (see Greenberg, 1997; Sotskov et al., 1995). In this article,
we describe a framework of phylogenetic stability measures
based on sensitivity and post-optimality analysis. Our methods
measure stability of trees with respect to the input data, allowing
the data from each taxon to be modiﬁed independently. Our
framework provides a measure of the minimum change in the
input sequences that are required to alter signiﬁcantly the top-
ology of a given phylogenetic tree. Thus, they assess if and how
much a particular tree relies on the accuracy of a small number
of character states. The more changes in input data required to
alter a tree signiﬁcantly, the more stable the tree is. Further,
nodal measures developed within this framework can be com-
puted quickly. We demonstrate that our stability measures pro-
vide a new computationally feasible perspective on the quality of
large phylogenetic trees. The main contributions of this work are
as follows:

(1) We present an original framework for assessing the stabil-
ity of phylogenetic trees and deﬁne several measures of
stability. These measures capture information about sta-
bility of trees relative to changes in the input data.

(2) We apply our stability measures to published datasets. In
these examples, we identify unstable subtrees and discuss
why they are unstable.

Stability analysis of phylogenetic trees

 

Background and preliminary information is presented in
Section 2. We then formally deﬁne the notions of stability and
discuss their relevance in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss
how data obtained from stability measures can be used to analyse
subtrees. The computational challenges for computing
stability and our solutions to them are described in Section 5.
We present experimental results in Section 6 and ﬁnally conclude
in Section 7.

2 BACKGROUND

In this section, we present the basic deﬁnitions necessary to
understand this study. We ﬁrst describe the notation for
sequences and trees (Section 2.1) followed by commonly used
optimality criteria for trees (Section 2.2). Finally we present the
framework for our stability measures (Section 2.3).

2.1 Sequences and trees

The goal of phylogenetics is to infer evolutionary relationships for
a set of taxa. Each taxon is typically represented using a sequence,
and the phylogenetic tree describes the evolutionary relationship
between different sequences. Let S 2 {S1, S2, . . . ,s,,} be the set of
sequences on which the phylogenetic tree, denoted by T, is built.
Each leaf node of T corresponds to a sequence in S. For example,
S shown in Figure 1 can be used to construct a parsimony-based
tree Ta shown in Figure 2. To reconstruct a phylogenetic tree, the
input sequences are aligned with each other in a multiple sequence
alignment such that each column in the alignment represents a
homologous character. In this article, we assume that a multiple
sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree corresponding to this
alignment are available.

2.2 Tree measures

Phylogenetic trees are generally inferred based on an optimality
criterion. Two commonly used criteria are maximum parsimony
and maximum likelihood.

The parsimony score is the minimum number of character
changes implied by a tree given a multiple sequence alignment.
A smaller parsimony score indicates a better tree. Parsimony-
based methods count the total number of substitutions in the
tree by summing the substitutions between sequences of every
pair of adjacent nodes. Sequences for internal nodes may be re-
constructed using algorithms such as the Sankoff algorithm
(Sankoff, 1975).

2.3 Framework for conﬁdence measures

Our framework for measuring the stability of tree requires com-
puting two types of functions:

(1) A function 80 that measures the amount of change made
to the input sequences

(2) A function 6() that measures the amount of change in the
resulting tree

It is possible to compute either function using a variety of met-
rics. In the analysis performed in this article, we use the edit
distance and the Robinson—Foulds (RF) distance (Robinson
and Foulds, 1981), as 80 and 6(), respectively. An edit operation

on a sequence replaces an existing character with a new one,
inserts a new character or deletes an existing one. The edit dis-
tance between two sequences is the number of edit operations
needed to convert one of the sequences to the other. We denote
the edit distance between two sequences sa and s], by 8(sa,s;,) or
861,5. In this article, we use an edit distance based on changing
individual sites, which mimics the effects of errors that may
emerge from modern sequencing techniques. Note that we
could have deﬁned an edit distance based on removing and repli-
cating entire columns in the sequence alignment. This would be a
special case of editing each sequence independently.

For the tree distance, let T be a rooted tree deﬁned on a set of
sequences S. Now, for every internal node u, there exists a set of leaf
nodes. These leaf nodes compose a clade. Let TT be the set of all
clades in T. The RF distance between two trees T1 and T2 is the
number of clades they do not have in common
(TT1 — TTZ) U (TT2 — TTI). For example, in Figure 2, the RF dis-
tance between Ta and T1, is two. Note that trees do not need to be
rooted for the stability measures. However, we assume they are
rooted as it enables efﬁcient computation of ancestral sequences.

Again, a large number of measures can be used for either of
the functions. For example, we can use a likelihood model to
measure the distances between sequences, and a weighted RF for
the tree distance. However, to emphasize stability, rather than
the speciﬁc measures we choose for these functions, we use two
commonly used and intuitive measures.

3 STABILITY

We deﬁne the stability measures for a tree in Section 3.1. In
Section 3.2, we deﬁne stability measures that work at a node

level. We then analyse these measures and discuss them with the
help of an example in Section 3.3.

3.1 Tree measures

We deﬁne two measures that capture the stability of the entire
dataset. First, we deﬁne a measure that captures the minimum
change in input (sequences) necessary to cause a major change in
the output (tree topology). To deﬁne this, a threshold of similar-
ity in tree topology (R) must be deﬁned to identify when the tree
topology has changed significantly.

Deﬁnition 1. Let T1 and S1 = {S1, S2, . . . ,s,,} be aphylogenetic
tree and its set of taxa sequences (Si), respectively. Let
S2 = {S’1,S’2, ...,S;1} be the set of sequences where S; for each
ie {1 ...n} is obtained by editing s,-. Let [E(S1,S2) be the total
number of edit operations necessary to transform S1 to S2:
[E(S1,S2) = 2,-8(s,-,s§). Let T2 be the optimal phylogenetic tree
for S2 under the same evolutionary model as T1. Given a tree dis-
tance threshold R, we define the edit distance stability (EDS) of
(S1, T1, R) as the minimum value of [E(S1, S2) necessary such that
5(T1, T2) 2 R.

Formally:

 , Sl ,  =  {[E(Sl,  SUCh that 6(T1, T2) 2 R

This measure captures exactly the amount of sequence editing
it takes to make the given tree ‘unstable’ with respect to an edit
distance threshold. Thus, it provides a guarantee on the amount
changes in the data that will not signiﬁcantly change the tree. For
example, the tree Ta in Figure 2 has an edit distance stability of
zero with respect to a tree threshold of one because T1, is an
alternate tree with same parsimony score. However, this is a
very low threshold. With a threshold of two, the stability is
higher because it requires more editing to make a larger
change in the tree. We now deﬁne a measure that captures the
maximum change in the tree possible if we are allowed to edit the
input sequences by a speciﬁed amount. To deﬁne this, a thresh-
old of editing (E) must be deﬁned to limit the number of changes
in the sequences.

Deﬁnition 2. Let T1 and S1 = {S1, S2, . . . ,s,,} be aphylogenetic
tree and its set of taxa sequences (Si), respectively. Let [E(S1, S2)
be the total number of edit operations necessary to transform S1 to
S2. Let T2 be the optimal phylogenetic tree for S2 under the same
evolutionary model as T1. Given an edit distance threshold E, we
define the tree distance stability (TDS) of (S1, T1, E) as the max-
imum value of 6(T1, T2) necessary such that [E(S1, S2) 3 E.

Formally:

 , Sl,  = max 6(T1, T2) SUCh that [E(Sl, 52) E E

This measure captures exactly the maximum change in the tree
possible given a threshold to editing. For example, the tree Ta in
Figure 2 has a tree distance stability of one with respect to an edit
distance threshold of zero because T1, is an alternate tree with
same parsimony score.

Both of these measures provide explicit guarantees on the sta-
bility of the given combination of sequences, model and tree.
They also pose challenging optimization problems due to the
vast search space of trees. We believe these to be at least as
hard as reconstructing a tree.

3.2 Node stability measures

The edit distance and tree distance stability deﬁned in Section 3.1
describe the stability of a given phylogenetic tree from two points
of view. However, computing these measures is non-trivial due to
the number of combinations of possible edits and resulting trees.
Moreover, these deﬁnitions fail to capture the overall stability of
subtrees and taxa. For example, Deﬁnitions 1 and 2 cannot dis-
tinguish between Ta and T1, in Figure 2. Next, we deﬁne two
conﬁdence measures that address these problems. These meas-
ures focus on modifying individual taxa. As we discuss in Section
4, we also extend the notion to internal nodes by using recon-
structed sequences and treating them as taxa. Thus, we use the
terms node and taxon interchangeably to deﬁne our measures.
We compute these measures by comparing (see Fig. 3) each node
x and make it a sibling of every other node y that is not a des-
cendant of x. For each pair, we compute: (i) how much editing
is required to make x the nearest node, in terms of edit distance,
to y; (ii) the distance of the tree from the original tree. In this
article, we use the term move to refer editing the sequence of the
node x so that it becomes the node with the sequence closest to
that of y. Topologically, x is moved to a location sister to y. This
moving is commonly referred to as Subtree Pruning and
Regrafting (SPR). Trees obtained through this move are within
one SPR distance of the original tree. While editing a sequence to
make it closer to another one affects the alignment, we assume
that the effect is small. Similarly, we assume moving a node does
not affect the entire tree. Section 5.1 discusses these assumptions
in detail. To compute ancestral sequences, we assume all trees are
rooted.

Next, we deﬁne a measure that captures the minimum amount
of editing necessary to any one sequence in the input sequences to
transform the output tree signiﬁcantly.

Deﬁnition 3. Let T1 and S1 = {S1,S2, . . . ,S2,,_1} be aphylogen-
etic tree and its set of sequences, including the taxa and the inferred
ancestral sequences, (Si), respectively. Let T2 be the phylogenetic
tree formed by removing x = s,-from its original location in T1 and
moving it to the sibling position of another node y = sj 6 T1 by
updating s,-. Let us denote the updated sequence s,- with s; to make
this move.

We define the minimum edit per tree distance (5) to be the min-
imum edit distance between S,- and S; such that 6(T1, T2) 2 R.

Formally:

5(T1, S, R, Si) 2 minj|8(si,S§)| such that 6(T1, T2) 3 R
and Vsk e S18(S§,sj) g 8(Sj,Sk)

This measure (Deﬁnition 3) is similar to the original measure
in Deﬁnition 1. The key difference is that changes in the input are
now restricted to one taxon. This provides an explicit guarantee
for how different one of the original sequences must be for the
tree to change more than a given RF threshold within one sub-
tree prune and regrafting (SPR) distance.

We now deﬁne a measure that captures the maximum change
in the phylogenetic tree possible when editing is allowed on only
one taxon.

Deﬁnition 4. Let T1 and S1 = {S1,S2, . . . ,S2,,_1} be aphylogen-
etic tree and its set of sequences, including taxa and inferred an-
cestral sequences, (Si) , respectively. Let T2 be the phylogenetic tree

y = Sj 6 T1 by updating S,-. Let uS denote the updated sequence S,-

edit as the maximum value of 6(T1, T2) such that 8(Si, S?) f E.
Formally:

t(T1, S, E, Si) 2 maxj6(T1, T2) such that 8(S,, S?) g E
and Vsk 6 S1 8(S;., Sj) g 8(Sj,Sk)

The maximum RF distance per edit distance provides an
explicit guarantee on how far a node may move in the input
tree within one SPR distance given a tolerance for errors.
Thus, this measure highlights the sequences that are more
easily moved and therefore need closer inspection. Because the
sequence length varies greatly in large-scale analyses, this meas-
ure can easily be adjusted to accommodate a percentage of the
sequence length rather than the actual sequence.

Deﬁnition 5. Let T1 and S1 = {S1,S2, . . . ,S2,,_1} be aphylogen-
etic tree and its set of sequences, including taxa and inferred an-
cestral sequences, (Si), respectively. Let x be a node in T1 such that
its sequence, reconstructed or given, is S,-. Let T2 be the phylogen-
etic tree formed by removing x=s,- from its original location and
moving it to the sibling position of another node y = sj 6 T1 by
updating s,-. Let us denote the updated sequence s,- with s; to make

this move. We say that a node is considered movable if 8(s,-, S?) f E
and 6(T1,T2) Z 

Deﬁnition 5 describes the nodes in the given tree that can be
moved by editing sequences. Given thresholds for both RF and
edit distance, the number of movable nodes summarizes the sta-
bility of the tree. If this number is high, it means that a large
number of taxa could potentially be placed in a different part of
the tree. In this case, the given tree is not stable.

Next, we examine a small example in detail and discuss how
these measures may be used.

3.3 Application and examples

We demonstrate the newly deﬁned measures using the example
in Figures 1 and 2. We also compare these measures with the
bootstrap support and parsimony scores.

We ﬁrst consider a set of sequences (Fig. 1) in S1 for which two
equally parsimonious trees may be constructed: Ta and T1, (using
DNAPARS/PHYLIP 3.6 (Felsenstein, 2005). RAxML
(Stamatakis et al., 2008) identiﬁes T], as the maximum likelihood
tree. Because the two trees have the same parsimony score, the
parsimony objective cannot differentiate between these two trees.
Also, both trees have the same maximum parsimony and boot-
strap scores.

The stability measures described above suggest that T], is more
stable than Ta. This is because editing up to two positions affects
Ta, but it does not T1,. The same threshold of editing allows for
more of change in Ta than T1,. This does not necessarily mean
that T], is right and Ta is wrong, but it suggests that T], is more
robust to potential errors or changes in the data. t also provides
an explicit guarantee that the maximum change that can be
caused by editing up to three nucleotides in T1, is RF 2 2 within
1 SPR distance. Thus, the stability measures elucidate the parts
of the tree that are the least stable (leaves C and D) and the
overall stability of different trees. Importantly, this is done by
evaluating the underlying primary data (the sequence alignment).

An important advantage of the measures introduced in Section
3.2 is that they can be used to rank the nodes. We can also create
a ranking of nodes at each edit distance using t, e. g. ranking in a
ascending order of instability for E = 6 in Ta:
4 = E, 3 = {C, G},2 = {D,B,A},l = F. Such a ranking can
help prioritize areas in the tree that need further phylogenetic
research.

An important question arising at this point is how high a value
of 8 or 6 is too high? To address this question, we propose stat-
istical methods for assessing the stability of clades in the next
section. We also discuss this question in Section 7.

4 ANALYSIS OF SUBTREES

Unlike the leaf level taxa, moving an internal node of the tree
moves the entire clade under it. In this section, we describe how
we analysed subtrees, or internal nodes, to evaluate their stability
using sequences of the taxa under them.

We analyse internal nodes by looking at the leaf nodes under-
neath them and counting the number of movable nodes. We use
a normal approximation to the binomial distribution to compute
a z-score for each subtree in the following fashion.

Let N be the total number of leaf nodes and let K be the
number of movable leaf nodes in the tree. The probability of
any given leaf node being movable is g, and the expected
number of movable nodes in a subtree of size n is  The stand-

ard deviation, using the approximation, is 1/n.%.(l —%).

scores of the related internal nodes are correlated as a parent

summarizes its children’s scores. For instance, the number and/
or ratio of movable sequences underneath an internal node indi-
cates the weakness (or strength) of the clade. To use this infor-
mation further, we sort the internal nodes in a descending order
of their z-score. This ranking identiﬁes the least stable subtrees.
We also checked the correlation of z-score with the average se-
quence length, i.e. whether the relatively longer sequences were
more stable. Overall, we observed little correlation with the ex-
ception of extremely long or short sequences.

We also computed the correlation between z-score and the
presence of particular taxonomic families (or any taxonomic
group) or genes in the underlying sequence alignment. Let the
number of taxa in the tree be N. For each taxonomic family F,-,
the number of nodes in the tree classiﬁed as that family are M ,-.
Let the number of nodes classiﬁed with family F,- in a given
subtree x, with n taxa, be m,-. We compute the probability of
observing at least m,- members from family F,- using the hypergeo-
metric distribution as follows:

(M) (N— M,)

k n — k

P(Fi, X) = Emigkgmin(Mi,n)W
n

We report the negative logarithm of this probability as the
enrichment of family in that subtree. Thus, the larger the ﬁnal
number, the more the subtree is enriched with that family. For
each subtree, we determine the family that maximizes this func-
tion. We report this as the enrichment score for the subtree.

5 COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS

In this section, we ﬁrst discuss basic assumptions made to make
the computation possible (Section 5.1). We then describe the
computational challenges posed by the internal nodes (Section
5.2). Finally, we discuss the overall complexity of the algorithm
used to compute these measures and in Section 5.3.

5.1 Editing sequences and moving taxa

We make two assumptions to make the computation of our
measures feasible:

(i) Modifying a small number of characters of a Single node
(which may represent changing one or more sequences in a
multiple-sequence alignment, see Section 5.2), in a tree
with a large number of nodes and taxa, does not signiﬁ-
cantly affect the other alignment positions.

(ii) Moving a Single node (which may represent one or more
taxa in a subtree) is unlikely to alter the topology of the
rest of the tree signiﬁcantly.

In the absence of these assumptions, we would have to esti-
mate both sequence alignment and the tree after every small
modiﬁcation of a single sequence. Also, both sequence alignment
and phylogeny inference are computationally expensive
(NP-hard) problems, and the recomputation is not feasible for
the large data sets we consider here.

5.2 Edit distance for clades

To determine the smallest number of edit operations needed to
move a given node (leaves or internal) from its position in the
tree to the sibling position of another node, we determine a se-
quence corresponding to each of the internal nodes. In our im-
plementation, we used a parsimony reconstruction algorithm to
infer ancestral sequences (Fitch, 1971). However, this can be
replaced by any methods to reconstruct ancestral sequences.

It is straightforward to compute the edit distance given a mul-
tiple sequence alignment by simply counting the number of pos-
itions in alignment where the two sequences have different
symbols. However, when considering moving a sequence from
one part of the tree to a position sister to a target node (internal
or leaf), we must ensure that we move it close to the target
sequence while minimizing the editing we have to do. We com-
pute the minimum editing required to move a sequence x to the
sibling position of node y exactly as follows: For each node of the
tree, we pre-compute the edit distance between the sequence of
that node and its nodes that are close to it in the tree. We store
the smallest edit distance for each node. This number for y is an
upper bound to the distance allowed between x and y to move x
next to y. We obtain the minimum editing required for this move
by subtracting this value from the original edit distance between
the sequences of x and y. This heuristic can be replaced by ﬁnd-
ing out exactly how close x has to be to y at an additional com-
putational cost. Moreover, under some models of character
evolution, two nodes do not need to have relatively similar se-
quences to be neighbors.

While computing the edit distance is relatively simple for
moving a single sequence, it is non-trivial for moving a set of
sequences representing a clade. We compute this distance by
maintaining at each node a count of each character at each pos-
ition. When computing the edit distance from a sequence to this
clade, we use this information to count the exact number of nu-
cleotides that are different. Thus, we count the exact number of
sequences we need to change in leaves, to move an internal node.

5.3 Computing node stability measures and complexity

We compute the node stability measures by traversing the entire
tree. We select each node as a putative moveable node x, and
compare it with every other node y in the tree. For every pair of
nodes x, y we compute the edit distance required to make x the
nearest neighbor of y and the RF distance between the trees
before and after this move. We maintain an array each for
values of 5 (for x), t (for x) for all thresholds from 0 to 1000.
After comparing x to every other node, this information is stored
in a ﬁle.

Stability analysis of phylogenetic trees

 

For a tree with n nodes, tree height d and alignment length L,
the time complexity of the above algorithm is 0[n2(d + L)]. This
is because we consider 0(n) nodes for moving. If we are con-
sidering an internal node for a move, we need to compute the
frequency of each nucleotide at each position leading to 0(nL)
time. For each node (leaf or internal), we perform 0(n) compari-
sons to all possible nodes for moving. Each comparison involves
comparing sequences in 0(L) time and ﬁnding out the common
ancestor of the two nodes for computing the RF distance in 0(d)
time. Thus, the time complexity of our algorithm is 0[n2 (d —l— L)].
The space complexity is 0(Ln) as the memory usage is com-
pletely dominated by storing the sequence at every node. This
can be reduced by pre—computing all distance comparisons in an
ofﬂine fashion.

6 RESULTS

Implementation details: We have implemented our algorithm
using Java. We were able to compute all the taxa stability meas-
ures on the datasets described in this article in <72 h. This in-
cludes a dataset with >55 000 taxa. Further, this computation
can be easily parallelized.

Datasets: In our experiments, we used three datasets that rep-
resent the variation found in current large-scale molecular phylo-
genetic studies.

(1) The Mammals dataset is a phylogeny of 169 species of
mammals published in (Meredith et al., 2011). The
length of the alignment is 35 603. The sequence length
varies from 3893 to 32201 with an average length of
29 373 and a standard deviation of 3669.

(2) The Saxifragales data is a phylogeny of 950 plant species
(D. Soltis et al., submitted for publication). The length of
the alignment is 48 465 positions. The sequence length
ranges from 227 to 26 863 with an average length of
2511 and a standard deviation of 3298.

(3) The Plants dataset is a phylogeny of 55 473 plant species
(Smith et al., 2011). The length of the alignment is 9853
positions. The sequence length ranges from 197 to 9135
with an average length of 1641 and a standard deviation of
1410.

6.1 Mammals dataset

In contrast to the other datasets, the Mammals dataset is highly
stable (Fig. 4). There is not a single move (R: 1) possible for an
edit distance of up to 530 nucleotides. Even if we place an
extremely high limit of E: 1000, the biggest move possible is
RF = 5. Thus, the stability measures provide an explicit guaran-
tee that there is no move possible for E = 500 and any values of
R within 1 SPR distance. This also demonstrates the power of
building phylogenies from large densely sampled datasets. We
tested our approach on randomly selected subsets of mammals
with 80 taxa, and we still found no signs of instability.

6.2 Saxifragales

The Saxifragales dataset contains data from many closely related
species. It is very sparse, with nearly 95% missing data in the

matrix. In contrast to the mammal data set, it displays much
instability (Fig. 5). With an edit distance of 100, it is possible
to move nearly two-thirds of the taxa to an RF distance of 3
(Fig. 5a). Much larger changes in the tree topology, however,
require a far greater edit distance. Therefore, this dataset dem-
onstrates much local instability, where it is easy to make many
small changes, in the midst of some robust phylogenetic struc-
ture, where large phylogenetic changes may be difﬁcult.

6.3 Plants dataset

We found high levels of instability in the 55 473 species plant tree
(Fig. 6). Editing only 50 nucleotides is sufﬁcient to move as many
as 10 000 taxa using any of our RF distance thresholds. Figure 6a
shows that the number of movable nodes increases sharply for all
values of R up to 20. Although we found evidence of instability
throughout the tree, for an edit distance threshold of 20, the most
unstable taxon was Ulex europaeus, which can be moved sister to
Lupinus nootkatensis, causing a change in the topology with RF
distance of 61. This illustrates that very small changes in the
underlying sequence data can lead to large changes in the tree
topology. Both species, like many of the most unstable species,
are part of an extremely large plant family, meaning that it is
within a subtree containing many closely related species. Thus,
although a RF distance of 61 represents a major change in tree
topology, it is still only moving species within the same family.
We can account for the distance of evolutionary relationship in
our measures of stability by computing a RF distance that is
weighted by the branch lengths. This would down-weight top-
ology changes among closely related taxa relative to changes
among more distantly related taxa.

As discussed previously in Section 4, we checked if the subtrees
with a large ratio of movable taxa are enriched for speciﬁc taxo-
nomic families. We found that nodes with some of the highest
ranked subtrees were enriched in extremely large families. Out of
20 internal nodes ranked by our algorithm, 11 were enriched in
Asteraceae, 4 in Poaceae and 2 in Orchidaceae. These are all
among the ﬁve largest plant families. We also checked to see if
the 11 nodes enriched in Asteraceae were descendants of a deep
node enriched in Asteraceae. We found that the least common
ancestor to all these nodes is very close to the root, far above the
most recent common ancestor of the Asteraceae.

Figure 6b shows that subtrees enriched in families tend to be at
either end of the Z-score spectrum, i.e. they are usually very
stable or very unstable.

Figure 60 further illustrates the lack of stability of this tree.
This ﬁgure plots the average and maximum RF distance against
E. It also shows that on average, each taxon can be moved to an
RF distance of 20 with as few as 100 nucleotides changed. With
little to no editing, some taxa can be moved to an RF distance of
40 or more. Also, Figure 6d plots the minimum edit distance
required against R. It shows that it is easy to perform moves
with very large RF distance with very little editing. The unstable
nature of this tree may be due to the presence of many taxa with
little nucleotide data and the gappy multiple sequence alignment.
We also checked if the reason for unstability is the large number
of taxa. We randomly selected 10 subsets each of size 3000, 7000,
12 500 and 25 000. In each of these, we found a very high number
of unstable taxa for similarly small thresholds. Thus, simply

7 DISCUSSION

We have presented a novel framework to evaluate the stability of
phylogenetic trees. These measures may be used to assess the
stability of individual sequences, clades or entire trees. They pro-
vide information that may be used to direct further phylogenetic
research and also suggest alternate plaubile topologies. Thus, the
stability measures presented in this article may be used to im-
prove quality of phylogenetic analyses and the performance of
iterative algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that our sta-
bility measures can be easily computed for the largest published
empirical datasets.

It is important to note that the success of these measures is
dependent on the choice of editing and tree distance measures
used. While we have used edit and RF distance measures, any set
of measures can be used. We can easily replace the edit distance
with a distance estimated using the General Time Reversible
model (Tavare, 1986) or the RF distance with a weighted RF
distance. In our current search strategy, SPR or tree bisection
and reconnection (TBR) distance measures may not be useful.
Criteria for the selection of E and R strongly depends on the
choice of distance functions. This is a complex issue, but we
brieﬂy suggest how this problem may be approached. A simple
approach could be to use percentages of average or current se-
quence length and tree height for determining E and R respect-
ively. Alternatively, it is possible to rank the nodes in the order of

locally unstable taxa in the tree, but the dataset is stable for larger RF
values

their stability with respect to a E or R. Finally, it is possible to
compute the statistical properties of sequence length and move
distances to determine outliers with respect to mean and 2—3
standard deviations for range.

Our analyses on published large datasets identiﬁed strengths
and weaknesses of these phylogenetic hypotheses. Our measures
found that the Plants and Saxifragales datasets were highly un-
stable. Both include many closely related species, and both con-
tain taxa with short sequences and with much missing data. It is
therefore not surprising that small changes in the sequences can
lead to large tree rearrangements. Our measures also recognized
the stability in the Mammals dataset, which has far fewer taxa
and much more sequence data.

It is important to note that the stability measures discussed
here complement, rather than replace, existing measures of
phylogenetic support. As a sanity check, we performed a limited
comparison to a method that identiﬁes rogue taxa running
RogueNaRoK (Aberer et al., 2011). While there was some over-
lap between the unstable taxa and the rogue taxa, the rankings
were not obviously correlated. We do not pursue a detailed com-
parison with the measures of rogue taxa identiﬁcation as their
objectives are different from stability.

The intent of the stability measures is not to invalidate a tree
or a method, but to provide explicit guarantees on situations
where a specific tree on a give dataset will not be unstable. The
placement of any subtrees and taxa identiﬁed as unstable should
be interpreted with caution. The ranked list of unstable nodes
should help prioritize areas of the tree that need further study
or data.

7.1 Future work

Our framework allows for deﬁnition of stability measures
beyond those presented in this article. Especially, other forms
of editing such as removal or addition of taxa may be inform-
ative for stability. In the future, we will examine the stability
measures to guide the construction and iterative improvement
of trees.

A preliminary analysis of the tree distance measures presented
in Section 3.1 suggests computational intractability. In the
future, we will explore the computational complexity and ap-
proximations to these measures. An important assumption we
made is that the global sequence alignment is stable enough such
that changing one sequence to move it closer to a different se-
quence is not going to affect everyone else in the alignment.
Similarly, we also assumed that the remaining tree is stable.
Both of these assumptions were made to avoid intractability.
In the future, we will try to assess the impact this can have on
our results and when is it safe to make this assumption. We will
also incorporate online methods to update the alignment and the
tree.

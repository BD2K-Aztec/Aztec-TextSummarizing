ABSTRACT

Summary: Often competing hypotheses for biochemical networks
exist in the form of different mathematical models with unknown
parameters. Considering available experimental data, it is then
desired to reject model hypotheses that are inconsistent with the
data, or to estimate the unknown parameters. However, these
tasks are complicated because experimental data are typically
sparse, uncertain, and are frequently only available in form of
qualitative if—then observations. ADMIT (Analysis, Design and Model
lnvalidation Toolbox) is a MatLabTM-based tool for guaranteed
model invalidation, state and parameter estimation. The toolbox
allows the integration of quantitative measurement data, a priori
knowledge of parameters and states, and qualitative information
on the dynamic or steady-state behavior. A constraint satisfaction
problem is automatically generated and algorithms are implemented
for solving the desired estimation, invalidation or analysis tasks. The
implemented methods built on convex relaxation and optimization
and therefore provide guaranteed estimation results and certificates
for invalidity.

Availability: ADMIT, tutorials and illustrative examples are available
free of charge for non-commercial use at http://ifatwww.et.uni-

1 INTRODUCTION

Data-based mathematical modeling can help to improve the
understanding of complex biological networks, e.g. by analyzing
and identifying core elements, or by predicting the network’s
behavior. However, usually the data are uncertain and come from
heterogeneous sources. This then results in competing model
hypotheses and hence an incomplete understanding of the underlying
network structure and biological mechanisms. In iterative cycles
of mathematical modeling and biological experimentation, model
hypotheses are tested and rejected if inconsistent with the
experimental data. For the remaining hypotheses the parameters can
be estimated, e.g. to allow for quantitative predictions.

Depending on the available data and the assumed uncertainty
description, one can distinguish between several approaches for
parameter estimation. To obtain optimal parameter estimates (by
minimizing a cost function) of nonlinear models and measurements

data with statistical uncertainty descriptions, methods using global
or local optimization can be considered [e.g. Moles et al. (2003)].
Efﬁcient implementations of such methods are available in software
tools, [e.g. Maiwald and Timmer (2008); Schmidt and Jirstrand
(2006)]. Optimization-based approaches do not necessarily provide
information about the precision of the estimates. As a solution,
proﬁle likelihood and resampling methods such as Bootstrapping,
Jackknife or Monte-Carlo testing have been proposed [e.g. Joshi
et al. (2006); Kremling et al. (2004); Raue et al. (2009)]. However,
ﬁnding a suitable threshold that classiﬁes a model as consistent with
the data is challenging (Anderson and Papachristodoulou, 2009).

A complementary approach is based on an unknown-but—bounded
(or set-based) uncertainty description [e.g. Milanese and Belforte
(2002); Walter and Piet—Lahanier (1990)]. Because entire sets can be
directly taken into account (theoretically) deﬁnite statements can be
made, which therefore allows a rigorous perspective on parameters
and model consistency.

We present ADMIT, a MatLabTM-based toolbox that uses
a set-based uncertainty description and convex relaxation and
optimization framework for model invalidation and parameter
estimation (Rumschinski et al., 2010). Besides unknown-but-
bounded measurement data, qualitative information such as
temporal or causal i—then observations or discrete state-variables
can be used (Rumschinski et al., 2012). The toolbox automatically
constructs a convex constraint satisfaction problem that incorporates
all available data and the model equations. Using convex relaxation
and optimization methods, outer-bounds of the consistent parameters
or states can be determined by solving the constraint satisfaction
problem. For this purpose, either the solvers implemented in ADMIT
or more efﬁcient external state-of-the-art numerical solvers for
mixed—integer linear programs can be used.

2 MAIN FEATURES

Installation and software dependability: ADMIT runs under
MatLabTM (requires version ZR2010a and the Symbolic Toolbox),
which allows the toolbox to be used with Windows, Linux, Unix and
MAC OS. Installation of the toolbox consists of simply unpacking
a ﬁle to the desired location and running a single install script.

To improve the efﬁciency and accuracy of the estimation results, a
wide range of external solvers (most of which are free of charge for
non-commercial research or educational purposes, e.g. SEDUMI,
GUROBI and CPLEX) can be used if the freely available YALMIP
toolbox (Lofberg, 2004) is installed.

For Monte-Carlo simulations and parallel estimation,
MatLabTM’s Optimization and Parallelization toolboxes are
required. Installation of the freely available SBToolbox2 (Schmidt
and Jirstrand, 2006) and libSBML (http://sbml.0rg/Software/
libSBML) are required for import of SBML and SBToolbox2
models.

Toolbox environment: All functions of the toolbox can be accessed
from within the MatLabTM scripting environment. The main tasks
and the default behavior can be controlled by options and few
simple function calls. For advanced users and more challenging
tasks, additional options and functions are available. All functions
are explained in detail by help texts and short examples within the
MatLabTM help browser.

Import and export of data, models and problems: Systems biology
models developed with the SBToolbox2 or in the SBML format
can be imported for further analysis. Measurement data stored in
different ﬁle formats (plain text, CSV etc.) can also be imported.
Preprocessing routines allow the speciﬁcation of measurement data
uncertainties (e. g. relative or absolute errors) and adding qualitative
constraints (e. g. monotonicity). Using binary variables, qualitative
biological knowledge such as logical or conditional relationships
or temporally uncertain data can be speciﬁed and considered
(Rumschinski et al., 2012). The obtained constraint satisfaction
problem can be exported to a text ﬁle in a human-readable and
intuitive format, which facilitates the exchange of data and models.
Model types and complexity: Both the steady-state or transient
behavior of models with nonlinear kinetics, ranging from
polynomial (mass-action kinetics) to rational (e.g. Michaelis-
Menten or Hill kinetics), can be analyzed. In addition, discrete-
Valued states, parameters or inputs (e.g. describing stimuli that can
only be provided in an on/Off way) can be included. Thus, this allows
e. g. the analysis of signal transduction and metabolic networks.
Currently, dynamic models with up to 10 states and 15 parameters,
or steady-state models with up to 250 states and parameters can
be analyzed. Further complexity reduction techniques allow even
bigger models to be treated (Rumschinski et al., 2010).

Model invalidation, parameter and state estimation: The
implemented algorithms automatically reformulate and relax the
non-convex constraint satisfaction problems to obtain a convex
one. If the solution set of the constraint satisfaction problem is
empty, then the corresponding parameter regions or entire model was
proved inconsistent with the data. Note that numerical conditioning
and round-off errors for models with large uncertainties can pose
challenges and may incorrectly classify a model inconsistent. The
algorithms have been optimized to reduce such issues.

To solve the constraint satisfaction problem, the toolbox provides
own routines or interfaces with external high-end solvers Via
YALMIP. Two different algorithms are available to obtain an
outer approximation of the feasible sets of parameters or states.
Using bisectioning, the (possibly non-convex) solution set can
be approximated up to a chosen accuracy. Another less accurate
but much faster algorithm (outer-bounding by optimization) is
particularly suited in case of a large number of variables, e.g.
for state estimation. State estimation results can be used to detect
discrepancies between models and data (outliers), to assess the
quality of the model, or to check qualitative or quantitative
constraints. Finally, the toolbox offers simulation of Monte-Carlo
samples to compare solutions with the estimated guaranteed bounds.

3 EXAMPLES

Several illustrative examples are available demonstrating different
features of the toolbox and how qualitative information and
quantitative data can be formulated. All examples are motivated
by our current modeling projects with real qualitative or
quantitative data. The repository of examples currently include:
parameter estimation for a Michaelis—Menten-type reaction network
(Rumschinski et al., 2010), parameter estimation and invalidation
of an adaptation model based on qualitative and uncertain data
(Rumschinski et al., 2012), state estimation and fault diagnosis of a
two-tank process. We will also make models and data used in future
publications available together with the toolbox.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The toolbox implements new set-based algorithms for modeling and
analysis of various types of networks and motifs, and it also makes
the algorithms accessible in an easy way. Compared with approaches
based on samples, the complementary set-based approach allows
deﬁnite statements on entire regions in the parameter space.
Because only unknown-but—bounded uncertainties are assumed,
no assumptions on statistics of measurements have to be made.
Additionally, the use of discrete-valued variables allows qualitative
data and information to be taken into account. Drawbacks are that
set-based approaches can be sensitive to measurement outliers and
can be computationally demanding.

In summary, the toolbox complements other approaches and is
useful to obtain a better understanding of uncertain systems.

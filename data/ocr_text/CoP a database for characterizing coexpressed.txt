ABSTRACT

Summary: Using a large dataset (10022 assays) obtained
from public plant microarray databases, we developed the CoP
database for associating co-expressed gene modules with biological
information such as gene ontology terms and, if available, metabolic
pathway names. The Confeito algorithm developed previously in
our laboratory, which is suitable to calculate the interconnectivity
between genes in co-expressed gene network, was applied to
extract co-expressed gene modules. The database includes the
gene modules for Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) and seven crops,
Glycine max (soybean), Hordeum vulgare (barley), Oryza sativa (rice),
Populus trichocarpa (poplar), ii'iticum aestivum (wheat), Vitis vinifera
(grape) and Zea mays (maize).

1 INTRODUCTION

Since the decoding of the Arabidopsis genome (Arabidopsis
Genome Initiative, 2000), information on genome sequences and
gene expression in plants has accumulated in public databases.
Many microarray datasets assembled from various experiments
(e. g. different tissues and chemical treatments), including the
AtGenExpress datasets of Arabidopsis (Schmid et al., 2005), have
been utilized to predict co-expressed genes for assigning them
to metabolic pathways (Obayashi et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2006),
transcriptional regulation (Hirai et al., 2007; Obayashi et al., 2009)
and/or biological processes (Ogata and Shibata, 2009).

There are several databases that are designed to extract c0-
expressed genes from plant microarray datasets and then provide
biological information with individual genes in the co-expressed
gene group, facilitating investigation of gene function (see the
review of Usadel et al., 2009). Cross-species comparison of relevant
co-expressed gene groups is also useful, as seen in the database
GeneCAT (Mutwil et al., 2008) that provides comparative analysis
of Arabidopsis and barley co-expressed genes on the basis of
sequence similarity. Association of co-expressed gene modules
intentionally with biological information such as gene ontology
(GO) and metabolic pathways would be useful. However, to our
knowledge, there is no such database available. Thus, we have

developed the COP database for associating co-expressed gene
modules assembled from public large microarray datasets with
biological information and comparing these modules across plant
species to provide fundamental data for hypothesis generation of
gene function. We apply the ‘condition—independent’ co-expression
analysis to extract co-expressed modules from the whole set
of microarray data, which gives only a single score, irrespective
of tissue types and other experimental conditions, to the gene of
interest. This approach is a suitable way to View general gene-t0-
gene relationships for the initial investigation of genes of interest
(see the review of Usadel et al., 2009). In addition to the biological
information such as GO terms and pathway names, the system
provides direct links to public databases for further information
on the co-expressed gene modules. The current database utilizes
public microarray datasets from Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress),
Glycine max (soybean; Ogata et al., 2009a), Hordeum vulgare
(barley), Oryza sativa (rice), Populus trichocarpa (poplar; Ogata
et al., 2009b), T riticum aestivum (wheat), Vitis vinifera (grape) and
Zea mays (maize).

2 DATA ACQUISITION

DNA microarray datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0V/ge0/) and ArrayExpress
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/micr0array-as/ae/) databases. We obtained
CEL ﬁles or MASS-processed data ﬁles (Affymetrix GeneChip) for
A.thalicma (5257 chips), G.max (2994), H.vulgare (403), 0.sativa
(432), Rtrichocarpa (95), Taestivum (368), Vvinifera (210) and
Z.mays (263). The CEL ﬁles were processed using the Bioconductor
package 2.3.13 with R version 2.8.1 to obtain MASS-processed text
data. The text data for each plant were standardized and then used
to calculate gene-to-gene correlation in gene expression proﬁles.
As a measure of the correlation, we use cosine correlation coefﬁcient
because it is suitable to deal with datasets that appear to be more
reliable in high positive expression values than in low ones in
terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. See the concept text attached to
the database for details (http://webs2.kazusa.0r.jp/kagiana/c0p0911/
c0ncept.html).

Biological information was obtained from datasets of GO
biological processes for A. thaliana (March 24, 2009) from TAIR
(http://arabid0psis.org/) and for 0.sativa (March 6, 2009) from
GRAMENE (http://www.gramene.0rg/). To assign plant genes to
metabolic pathways, we obtained information on the assignment
for Arabidopsis genes from KEGG PATHWAY (http://www. genome
.jp/kegg/pathway.html) and KaPPA—View 4 (http://ka.kazusa.or.jp/
ka4/; Tokimatsu et al., 2005).

The dataset of Arabidopsis cDNA was obtained from the
TAIR database (TAIR8_cds_20080412, April 12, 2008), the
dataset of rice cDNA from RAP-DB (http://rapdb.dna.affrc. go.ij ;
prediction_nuc.fa and rep_nuc.fa, May 16, 2007) cDNA and other
plant EST datasets from the DFCI database (http://compbio.dfci.
harvard.edu/tgil; these latest version data were obtained in February
2009) for homology analysis.

3 DETECTION OF CO-EXPRESSED GENE
MODULES

We extracted co-expressed gene modules with the Confeito
algorithm that is designed to detect highly interconnected modules
from co-expressed gene networks (Ogata et al., 2009c). The
algorithm uses a novel network index NF for each module (see http://
webs2.kazusa.or.jp/kagiana/cop0911/pages/terms.html for details).
To help assess the modules statistically, we also provide the
percentile score of the NF index of the module of interest to the
NF indices of all other modules.

4 ASSOCIATION WITH BIOLOGICAL
INFORMATION

We performed homology search using NEC Homology
Searcher 4.3a software with the BLASTn algorithm (NEC
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Each gene sequence of a plant was
BLAST searched not only to all sequences of the plant to ﬁnd
paralogous genes within the species, but also to all sequences of
other plant to ﬁnd the best hit orthologous gene. These homologous
gene sets deposited in the database are used to represent the
genes homologous to the user’s query gene. Sequence similarity
is represented with the commonly used indexes, E-Value and Bit
score, and also with the harmonic mean of identity. To associate
each co-expressed gene module with biological information, the
system compares the gene members of the module to those assigned
to a GO term of biological processes that has been deﬁned by the
GO consortium with a harmonic mean index (see the detail in
the concept text). Information of GO term association is provided
only for Arabidopsis and rice, as for these plants the GO terms are
available with the gene codes used in the COP database. Association
with metabolic pathway names of the omics integration tool
KaPPA—View 4 and biological pathways of the database KEGG
PATHWAY is also represented with the harmonic mean index.

5 DATABASE DESIGN
5.1 The COP portal site

The CoP portal site allows users to input query terms according
to the following steps: (i) input of query term; (ii) selection of
plant; (iii) selection of information type; and then (iV) selection
of options (see http://webs2.kazusa.or.jp/kagiana/cop0911/pages/
terms.html for details). Query terms include gene identiﬁers (e.g.
an AGI code for A. thaliana), probe names and all or part of a gene
name. When multiple hits are obtained for genes or probes for a

query, a list of these hits is displayed with corresponding links to
individual information pages. The complete list of the co-expressed
gene modules can be displayed in descending order of the tight
connectivity by entering the search string ‘confeito’ to the ‘Gene,
co-expres sion’ .

5.2 Information pages for co-expressed gene modules

The information page for each co-expressed gene module comprises
four sections. The ﬁrst section provides information about the
connectivity and number of genes of the module. The Arabidopsis
page also includes a co-expressed gene network graph with the
query gene; i.e. genes are interconnected by their similarity in
expression proﬁles. In each network, nodes are categorized into four
functional types: transcription factor, binding protein, enzyme and
other proteins. The second section presents a table of functional
descriptions, including the associations of genes with biological
processes, and links to additional biological information and
public databases for each gene. By clicking on ‘More genes’, all
co-expressed genes in the module are presented in the table. The
third section presents a list of microarray experiments on genes in the
module showing speciﬁc expression. The fourth section represents
a comparison between co-expressed gene modules in two plants.

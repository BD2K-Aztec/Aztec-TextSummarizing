ABSTRACT

Motivation: We’ve developed a highly curated bacterial virulence
factor (VF) library in PATRIC (Pathosystems Resource Integration
Center, www.patricbrc.org) to support infectious disease research.
Although several VF databases are available, there is still a need to
incorporate new knowledge found in published experimental evidence
and integrate these data with other information known for these spe-
cific VF genes, including genomic and other omics data. This integra-
tion supports the identification of VFs, comparative studies and
hypothesis generation, which facilitates the understanding of virulence
and pathogenicity.

Results: We have manually curated VFs from six prioritized NIAID
(National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) category A—C
bacterial pathogen genera, Mycobacterium, Salmonella, Escherichia,
Shigella, Listeria and Bartonella, using published literature. This
curated information on virulence has been integrated with data from
genomic functional annotations, trancriptomic experiments, protein—
protein interactions and disease information already present in
PATRIC. Such integration gives researchers access to a broad array
of information about these individual genes, and also to a suite of tools
to perform comparative genomic and transcriptomics analysis that are
available at PATRIC.

Availability and implementation: All tools and data are freely avail-
able at PATRIC (http://patricbrc.org).

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Virulence factors (VFs) are an important class of gene products
that help pathogens to evade a speciﬁc host’s defensive mech-
anisms to establish infection in a speciﬁc environmental condi-
tion, thereby resulting in a disease state for that host. Studying
VFs facilitates our understanding of pathogenicity and infec-
tious disease mechanisms, and helps researchers to develop new
methods for disease prevention and therapy (Casadevall and
Pirofski, 2009; Keen, 2012; Onderdonk 1988; Wu et al.,
2008). There are a few existing VF databases that provide com-
prehensive collections of bacterial VF genes, such as VF

database (VFDB; http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs), MvirDB (http://
mvirdb.llnl.gov) and Victors (http://www.phidias.us/Victors).
These resources link published information about Virulence dir-
ectly to the genes or to protein families that contain the genes
(Chen et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2007). Other resources, like
UniProt and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes), designate speciﬁc genes as VFs without necessarily
showing the published support of this declaration (Ogata et al.,
1999; UniProt, 2011). Despite these resources, there remains a
need to further identify VF genes, link them with published
experimental evidence and integrate that data with the wealth
of omics data that can reveal protein function, expression pat-
terns or other information that show the gene’s role in Virulence
and the disease processes.

The Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) is
the all-bacterial Bioinformatics Resource Center designed to sup-
port basic and applied biomedical research on bacterial infec-
tious diseases (Gillespie et al., 2011; Wattam et al., 2014).
PATRIC supports a variety of diverse data types such as gen-
omics, transcriptomics, protein—protein interactions, 3D protein
structures and DNA sequence typing data with their associated
metadata. PATRIC also provides analysis tools for genome an-
notation, comparative genomics, transcriptomics, pathways,
host—pathogen interaction and disease-related information
(Driscoll et al., 2011). Integrating bacterial VF genes is a logical
next step in these data integration effort.

In the present work, we manually curated VFs from six prior-
itized National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
(NIAID) category A—C bacterial pathogen genera (http://www.
niaidnih.gov/topics/biodefenserelated/biodefense/pages/cata.aspx),
Mycobacterium, Salmonella, Escherichia, Shigella, Listeria and
Bartonella, and integrated the curated information into
PATRIC. In addition, we also integrated the VF information
from VFDB and Victors into PATRIC. The resulting integrated
information can be easily accessed and Visualized through
PATRIC’s Web interface. By leveraging the curated VFs, the
information from both VFDB and Victors and the preexisting
PATRIC resources, PATRIC’s VF module enables users to
access the comprehensive omics, and host-pathogen disease in-
formation about the VF genes, perform comparative genomic
and transcriptomics analysis for these VFs and store the ana-
lyzed information in their private workspace. The private work-
space then becomes an important hypothesis-generating
capability for bench biologists to advance VF knowledge and
develop counter measures.

2 METHODS

2.1 Development of controlled vocabulary

We developed a controlled vocabulary to categorize VF genes and to
enhance the global search capability available at PATRIC. The vocabu-
lary was based on the combination and modiﬁcation of the VF classiﬁ-
cations and terms used by other databases, such as VFDB, MvirDB,
COG and peer-reviewed literature (Chen et al., 2012; Tatusov et al.,
1997; Zhou et al., 2007). The major VF classiﬁcation used included the
following: adhesion, invasion, avoidance of host defense, extracellular
growth, intracellular survival and replication, movement within host, ac-
quisition of nutrients, regulation of gene expression, secretion systems,
toxin and antibiotic resistance. The vocabulary terms used are listed at
PATRIC Web site (http://patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/SpecialtyGene
Source?source=PATRIC_VF; under ‘Classiﬁcation’ at the left panel).

2.2 VF genes

We collected bacterial VF genes from publicly available databases
(VFDB, MVirDB and Victors) and from peer-reviewed publications.
We searched the literature to identify new VF genes that are not included
in the databases, and also to ﬁnd primary references establishing the
virulence of the genes identiﬁed at the other resources. The names of
the VF genes, any available accession numbers, organisms studied and
associated PubMed ID for each paper used were recorded.

2.3 Curation process

The curation workﬂow is outlined in Figure 1. After initial collection of
VF genes from other databases and peer-reviewed literature, curators
followed the curation guideline to curate VFs using experimental evi-
dences. First, for each VF gene in the list, a search for speciﬁc papers
providing experimental evidence or computational function analysis
about that gene was initiated. Emphasis was on ﬁnding direct experimen-
tal evidence of virulence on a speciﬁc host. However, if no experimental
evidence exists, the computational analysis and the author’s description
about the gene function are recorded. For each paper selected, sentences

from the literature that assert the function of the VF gene studied as well
as the name of the bacteria strain(s), the host(s) or cell types used in the
experiment were extracted. Curators then assigned the VF gene with the
deﬁned categories (the controlled vocabulary as described above) based
on the study. If the gene could not be classiﬁed into a speciﬁc category
with the only evidence being a non-speciﬁc virulence phenotype, such as
attenuation of a gene mutant strain, then the gene was assigned to a
category denoted as ‘Virulence’. The extracted sentences that were
chosen from the papers summarized the experimental evidence, virulence
phenotypes or author’s description about the function for the VF gene(s)
studied in the literature.

2.4 Mapping of curated VFs with PATRIC genes

Integration of the manually collected VF genes involved providing a
direct mapping between genes that have been experimentally veriﬁed to
genes present in the PATRIC database. Individual papers were analyzed
with the speciﬁc object of acquiring the strain name of the bacterium used
and identiﬁers for the gene used in the experiment. In an ideal situation, a
gene’s GenBank accession number or RefSeq locus tag is provided (Pruitt
et al., 2012) and it directly maps the information from the publication to
the gene and genome in PATRIC. When not available, other informa-
tion, like the name of the gene, the gene symbol, a UniProt ID, the
sequence of the gene, the neighborhood surrounding the gene in question
or other cited papers were used to identify the gene used in the experi-
ment. When the evidence was good, a direct map between the gene and
genome speciﬁed in the paper and the identiﬁed gene at PATRIC was
generated. These genes were identiﬁed as VFs in the PATRIC database,
and were given an evidence label of ‘Literature’ on the PATRIC Web site.
If despite all the efforts, a gene could not be veriﬁed, the associated
literature data were discarded.

In addition to the manually curated VF genes, we integrated data from
VFDB and Victors, including reference gene sets, their corresponding
genomic sequence and all available literature. If sequence data were not
available at the resource, the gene identiﬁers were used to collect corres-
ponding sequence data from GenBank. These sequences were used to
create a BLAST database of VFs. All genes in the PATRIC were
searched against this database using BLASTP. The top BLAST hits for
each genome were parsed and ﬁltered based on the sequence identity and
the sequence coverage using the following criteria: (%Query cover-
age 2 80 OR %Subject coverage 2 80) AND %Identity 2 80.

To identify homologs of these genes, the genes in each genome that
had the top BLASTP hit against each of the genes in the VF database and
met the ﬁltering criteria were identiﬁed as potential VFs in the PATRIC
database, and were given an evidence label of ‘BLASTP’ on the PATRIC
Web site. This indicated that the gene was highly similar to a gene in
either VFDB or Victors, or to the genes that had been manually curated.
These, too, were given an evidence label of ‘BLASTP’ on the PATRIC
Web site.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Curation status

We curated 1572 VF genes from 1071 published papers for six
prioritized NIAID category A—C bacterial pathogens. The
number of curated unique VF genes and unique papers for
each organism is listed in Table 1. As the VF curation is a con-
tinuing effort, we continue to update new Virulence information
for these organisms and are extending the curation work to other
bacterial pathogens.

3.2 Integration of curated VF genes into PATRIC
database

There were 2837 genes with direct literature references that were
collected from Victors and 1572 from the PARTIC manually
curated set. The PATRIC set contained some genes that
mapped only to genes found in the RefSeq that were not called
by the RAST annotation pipeline, which is used for annotation
consistency across all the genomes in PATRIC (Overbeek et al.,
2014). Although there were 1572 genes curated, 1338 of these
could be directly mapped to genes called by PATRIC. The un-
mapped genes were still kept in the PATRIC database with links
out to their original resources. The combination of genes from
Victors and the genes that could be mapped to PATRIC totaled
4175. As the same genes were sometimes identiﬁed by both data-
bases, the total of unique genes with literature references was
3742. Each of these unique genes with direct references establish-
ing their Virulence was identiﬁed on the Web site with an evi-
dence code of ‘Literature’, meaning that there was direct
literature evidence linked to the gene in question. There were
1149 genes collected from VFDB, but this resource has a differ-
ent method of curation where they link literature to a FIGfam
and not directly to genes. Although these data are available in
PATRIC, the evidence for these genes was listed as ‘BLASTP’,
indicating that the identiﬁed gene was highly similar to one in the
reference set, but lacked the direct literature evidence to merit the
‘Literature’ evidence code.

All protein sequences from each of these reference gene sets
were used to create a BLAST database to which all the predicted
genes from each genome at PATRIC were compared using the
sequence identity and query coverage discussed above. These
reference genes were mapped to 4532 816 genes across the
79 934 557 genes annotated across the 21 640 genomes available
in PATRIC as of July 2014. All of the genes that were identiﬁed
by homology and not direct literature evidence were given a
‘BLASTP’ evidence code. Filters have been provided on the
Web site that can adjust the level of BLAST homology, allowing
researchers examine stringencies at a level of homology they are
interested in.

Fig. 2. Visualization and analysis of VFs in PATRIC

the existing PATRIC resources, the PATRIC VF module enables
users to access the comprehensive omics data and tools. Figure 2
shows an overview of how VF genes can be accessed and Visua-
lized in PATRIC, and how other components in PATRIC with
information, data and tools can be used for the VFs.

There are several entry points for accessing the VF genes: (i)
The Specialty Gene page linked from the top DATA menu on
PATRIC home page provides hyperlinks for all VFs curated in
PATRIC (PATRIC_VF) and the VFs from VFDB and Victors;
(ii) A “Specialty Genes’ tab is provided at each speciﬁed organism
page and at any taxonomy level, which links to a list of VFs for
that organism or level; (iii) The global search on any PATRIC
page allows researchers to enter the VF gene symbol, ID or
keywords to search for these genes, with the return being a list
of VF genes that match the search criteria. Each gene returned in
the search has a hyperlink to a more detailed gene page. As the
VF genes are fully integrated with other components of
PATRIC, users can easily gain access to other related informa-
tion, data and tools from the VF gene page (Fig. 2). This page
includes the direct evidence curated from the published literature,
a View of the gene’s location in the genome (Genome Browser) or
a conserved gene neighborhood (Compare Region Viewer), the
ability to do comparative genomics and pathway analysis and
also access to transcriptomics, protein—protein interactions, se-
quence typing and other data and analysis tools. Genes, or col-
lections of genes of interest, can be stored in a private workspace
accessible by the registered user.

3.3.2 VF gene list and gene pages Figure 3A shows a list of
PATRIC VF genes from the Specialty Genes search for
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37RV. There are 420 VF genes
curated in PATRIC for M.tubercul0sis H37RV. The left panel
provides a ﬁltering mechanism that allows users to select/ﬁlter on
different organism(s) of interest and on different Virulence clas-
siﬁcations based on the vocabularies described in Section 2.1.
The right panel is a table listing the selected VF genes. In this
example, mbtA-H mycobactin biosynthesis genes are among the
curated gene list. The table provides summarized information
including the source ID, gene name and functional annotation,
Virulence classiﬁcation, links to the PubMed papers establishing
Virulence and homologs of the gene. The Homologs column is

hyperlinked to a list of homologs of the corresponding VF gene.
PATRIC provides ﬁlters so that researchers can adjust the levels
of homology to more stringent or more relaxed. Each homolog
gene is labeled as ‘PATRIC_VF’ if there is direct experimental
evidence from literature, or ‘BLASTP’ indicated as having pos-
sible Virulence properties by homology. The source ID for each
VF gene in the table links to a detailed gene page displaying the
curated information from the literature. Figure 3B shows the
portion of the VF gene page that describes the details from cur-
ation that include the bacterial strain tested, the host or cell type
that was used, the Virulence classiﬁcation assigned by the cur-
ators and the assertion sentences extracted from the paper that
provide the evidence of Virulence.

3.4 Analysis of VFs using integrated omics information

One of the main advantages of PATRIC’s VF resource over
other VF databases is the integration of rich omics data and
analysis tools, giving a one-stop shop experience for researchers.
Here we use mst, a mycobactin biosysnthesis gene in the mbtA-
J gene cluster as an example to illustrate how the integrated
omics information and tools can be used for this gene (De
Voss et al., 2000; Quadri et al., 1998). An additional VF example
is provided in the supplementary material. A hyperlink from the

‘Source ID’ of the VF gene on the detailed VF information page
is provided for users to access more comprehensive information
about this gene. In addition to the functional properties, several
tabs are provided for this gene to access the Genome Browser,
Compare Region Viewer, the pathways that the gene is involved
in, interactions with other proteins, transcriptomics data and the
correlated genes that have similar expression patterns.

3.4.1 Genomics information and tools The detailed gene page
provides the mapped identiﬁcation numbers and locus tags
from different resources such as RefSeq, UniProt, NCBI,
EMBL, etc., which enables easy access to different annotation
sources of the same gene for comparison. The gene can be Viewed
in a Genome Browser, where it can be compared with other
annotation sources. The Compare Region Viewer allows users
to compare genomic regions around the gene of interest across
other closely related genomes. Using this Viewer, one can quickly
detect differences in translation start sites, potential frame shifts
or missing genes. In addition to the gene product annotation,
other functional properties of the gene such as Gene Ontology,
Enzyme Commission, FIGfam and pathway assignments, struc-
ture and protein—protein interaction information (if any) are also
provided (Meyer et al., 2009). Supplementary Figure S5 shows
an example graph for protein—protein interactions. The DNA

gene page provides a list of pathways in which the gene is
involved. In PATRIC, three pathways include mst:
Biosynthesis of siderophore group nonribosomal peptides,
lysine biosynthesis and tryptophan metabolism. As mst is a
mycobactin biosynthesis gene, the pathway summarizing the bio-
synthesis of mycobactin (Biosynthesis of siderophore group non-
ribosomal peptides) is one choice to look for the impact of this
gene on metabolism and other genes involved in the pathway.
The name of the pathway is hyperlinked to a Pathway Map page
that has a tabular summary of the enzymes involved and the
KEGG map for this pathway (Fig. 4A). The pathway map
shows that in addition to mst, mbtA, mth, mth, mth,
mth and mth are also involved in the biosynthesis of myco-
bactin (highlighted in red). Mycobactin biosynthesis is essential
for the survival and Virulence of M .tuberculosis (De Voss et al.,
2000; Quadri et al., 1998; Reddy et al., 2013). Without the func-
tional mbt genes, mycobactin is not made and the iron uptake
process is disrupted, which is critical for Virulence. The pathway
analysis can help one understand the biological function of the
VF genes.

3.4.3 T ranscriptomics data and correlated genes The
‘Transcriptomics’ tab on the gene page provides a list of available
transcriptomics datasets for the gene of interest that has been
added to the PATRIC resource. All comparisons in which this
gene is differentially expressed are listed in a table along with the
associated metadata, which includes strain, gene modiﬁcation,
experimental condition and time point. The summary of the

datasets is presented graphically with bar graphs and pie charts
(Supplementary Fig. S1). As of July 2014, there were 41 experi-
ments and 453 comparisons available for mst gene expression
data in PATRIC, one of which includes iron-dependent gene
expression (Rodriguez et al., 2002).

The ‘Correlated Genes’ tab shows a list of genes that have
correlated expression proﬁles to the speciﬁed gene across all
available transcriptomics datasets. Users can specify a correl-
ation coefﬁcient cutoff (between 0 and l) and choose to View
positively or negatively correlated genes. There are 53 correlated
genes for mst based on all available transcriptomics data in
PATRIC when using the default correlation coefﬁcient value
of 0.4. mbtA-J genes are clearly among these correlated genes
for mst, which is consistent with the function of this gene clus-
ter (Table 2). The correlated gene function in PATRIC is cur-
rently calculated in real time. Depending on the total number of
available experiments of the gene being tested, the response time

for displaying the result ranges from seconds to minutes.
The result takes longer for genes from organisms such as
M.tuberculosis and Escherichia coli for which correlation is
computed based on expression of all genes across hundreds of
experimental conditions.

The PATRIC transcriptomics tools allow users to view the
expression proﬁles of selected genes of interest in a heatmap
view. Figure 4B shows an example of the heatmap view of ex-
pression proﬁles for the mbt gene cluster in an experiment exam-
ining the role of IdeR regulator in an iron-dependent gene
expression (Rodriguez et al., 2002). The iron-dependent tran-
scriptional proﬁles of wild-type and ideR mutant strains were
analyzed using iron-sufﬁcient and iron-deﬁcient conditions.
The comparison clearly showed that all mbt genes were upregu—
lated when comparing the wild-type strain in iron-sufﬁcient con-
dition with iron-deﬁcient condition and comparing ideR mutant
strain with wild-type strain under iron-sufﬁcient condition. The
result indicated that the mbt genes were regulated in a similar
fashion by iron and the IdeR regulator. The transcriptomics
analysis can help researchers understand the regulation of the
VFs.

3.4.4 Comparative FIGfam analysis of mbt genes The Protein
Family Sorter tool at PATRIC enables researchers to examine
the distribution of speciﬁc isofunctional FIGfams, known as
FIGfams, across different genomes (Meyer et al., 2009). This
tool can be used to compare the mbt FIGfams in mycobacterium
genomes to see which genomes have or lack this gene cluster, or
speciﬁc members within it. Figure 4C shows a 2D heatmap view
of the FIGfam comparison among selected M ycobacterium gen-
omes. It is evident that M ycobacterium leprae Br4923 and
M .leprae TN (highlighted in red) lack the mbtA—J gene cluster,
indicating that they do not have a mycobactin biosynthesis
mechanism like M. tuberculosis. This is consistent with the previ-
ous ﬁndings that mycobactin was absent in M.leprae (Kato,
1985). M ycobacterium leprae uses an alternative mechanism for
iron uptake process (Morrison, 1995).

3.4.5 Between and within multi—locus sequence type comparative
FIGfam analysis of VFs The FIGfam sorter tool can also be
used to look at within and between DNA sequence type (ST)
VF differences in the multi-locus sequence types (MLSTs) incor-
porated in PATRIC as genome level metadata. This is useful for
researchers who work with MLSTs and want to examine possible
differences in disease phenotype between ST as well as what VF
genes would make good candidates for expanding MLSTs by
VF genes (Maiden, 2006). For instance, looking at the E.coli VF
operons for iron uptake, fep and iuc, in the FIGfam sorter, it
shows that there is considerable variation in the presence/absence
of FIGfams for the fep operon between STs, whereas iuc has
universal presence between STs, which indicates that iuc is a
good candidate for including in a virulence MLST proﬁle
(de Lorenzo et al., 1986; Pierce et al., 1983). This ﬁnding is
consistent with the published conclusions (Ngeleka et al., 2002).

3.5 Comparison of PATRIC VF database with other
databases

The presence of several databases devoted to VFs may beg the
question of why yet another database is needed and how

PATRIC VF resource differs from the others. UniProt and
KEGG are valueable resources in their own right, and although
they identify genes as VFs, they do not necessarily show the
published support of this declaration. Victors is another powerful
resource that provides literature, but it lacks integrations with
other information. VFDB has a core dataset of 26 pathogenic
genera that contain 459 VFs with 2059 associated publications.
As in VFDB, PATRIC curators did extensive literature review in
an effort to provide evidence of virulence, but, in PATRIC, this
was targeted at ﬁnding direct experimental evidence of virulence
that could be mapped to speciﬁc genes in their associated gen-
omes, and not to a FIGfam as occurs in VFDB. In PATRIC,
data collected from publications include the genome and gene,
the host organism or cell type and sentences from the original
article that supports an assertion of virulence. This allows re-
searchers to see the supporting evidence without relying solely
on the conclusions drawn by a curator. In addition, in an effort
to integrate all types of useful information, the data from pub-
lications that document a lack of virulence in a known VF is also
collected, as are the conditions (host, experimental factor) under
which this occurred.

The type of integration available at PATRIC allows re-
searchers to see virulence data in the context of comparative
genomics, transcriptomics data and correlated gene expression,
disease information or from the perspective of different sequence
types (i.e. MLST). Having this variety of types of data available
to a researcher in a single resource is what truly distinguishes
PATRIC from other resources.

4 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Pathogenicity of bacteria continues to be an intense focus of
research and funding. Knowing what speciﬁc genes have been
tied to virulence is important, but being able to see the original
data and experimental conditions, as well as having other infor-
mation integrated with these data can be extremely powerful for
the research scientist. PATRIC has made an initial foray in to
this type of integration with curation initially targeted at six bac-
terial genera with plans to expand across of the NIAID category
A—C priority pathogens. In addition to manually curating data
associated with virulence, we have computationally integrated
data from two VF resources, allowing researches to see the
homologs of all genes identiﬁed as virulent across the 22 000
genomes currently in PATRIC. Speciﬁc PATRIC tools allow
individual researchers to adjust the degree of homology (ex-
pressed in percent coverage or percent identity of the BLASTP
hit), to apply limits to the stringency used to establish homology.
In addition, the integration of VFs in PATRIC provides an
access to all the other data and tools available for analysis,
making it a valuable experience for researchers and a unique
resource.

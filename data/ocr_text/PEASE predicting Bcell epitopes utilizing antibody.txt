Abstract

Summary: Antibody epitope mapping is a key step in understanding antibody—antigen recognition
and is of particular interest for drug development, diagnostics and vaccine design. Most computa—
tional methods for epitope prediction are based on properties of the antigen sequence and/or struc—
ture, not taking into account the antibody for which the epitope is predicted. Here, we introduce
PEASE, a web server predicting antibody—specific epitopes, utilizing the sequence of the antibody.
The predictions are provided both at the residue level and as patches on the antigen structure. The
tradeoff between recall and precision can be tuned by the user, by changing the default param—
eters. The results are provided as text and HTML files as well as a graph, and can be viewed on the

antigen 3D structure.

1 Introduction

Antibody (Ab) epitopes, or B—cell epitopes, are used in many applica—
tions, such as diagnostics, therapy, vaccine design and biological re—
search. Correct identification of Ab epitopes is crucial for all these
applications and is also required for the understanding of Ab—Ag rec—
ognition and specificity (Sela—Culang et 61]., 2013). Experimental
methods for mapping Ab epitopes are expensive, laborious and time
consuming, and many of them also fail to identify some of the
epitopes (Xu et 61]., 2010).

Developing an accurate computational method for epitope pre—
diction has been proven to be a difficult task (Kringelum et 61].,
2012; Yao et 61]., 2013). Most methods attempt to differentiate be—
tween epitopic and non—epitopic surface residues of the Ag, based on
properties associated with Ag sequence and/or structure (Yang and
Yu, 2009). However, it appears that almost any residue on the Ag
surface may become an epitope under some circumstances
(Greenbaum et 61]., 2007). Inspired by the success of T—cell epitope

prediction methods, where predictions depend on the specific major
histocompatibility complex molecule presenting the epitope (Desai
and Kulkarni-Kale, 2014; Lundegaard et 61]., 2012), we hypothe—
sized that a B—cell epitope should be predicted for a certain Ab rather
than for any Ab, and that the information from the Ab should be uti—
lized to enable such Ab—specific predictions. We have shown that
this approach can achieve substantially improved predictions when
compared with predictions based on the Ag’s features only
(Sela—Culang et 61]., 2014). Several strategies that take into account
the Ab sequence or structure were proposed and introduced, in the
last few years: Antibody Specific Epitope Prediction (ASEP) (Soga
et 61]., 2010) is an index, computed based on Ab—Ag residue prefer—
ences, used to narrow down candidate residues predicted by conven—
tional methods. Bepar (Zhao and Li, 2010) and ABepar (Zhao et 61].,
2011) are sequence—based methods predicting Ab—specific epitopes
based on association patterns of Ab—Ag residues (Bepar) and on Ab-
Ag preferences of individual residues and residue pairs (ABepar).

EpiPred (Krawczyk et al., 2014) is a fully structure—based method
combining geometric matching with Ab—Ag residue preferences.

Here, we present Predicting Epitopes using Antibody SEquence
(PEASE), a web—server that predicts epitopes, provided an Ab se—
quence and its cognate Ag structure. For a detailed description of
the PEASE algorithm, see Sela—Culang et al. (2014). Brieﬂy, for a
given pair of Ab sequence and Ag structure, all combinations of one
residue from the Ab Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs)
and one residue from the Ag surface are evaluated by a machine—
learning model trained on properties from 120 Ab—Ag complexes.
Each such pair of residues is assigned a ‘pair—score’ representing the
prediction that these Ag and Ab residues contact each other in real—
ity. A ‘residue—score’ for an Ag surface residue is its highest ‘pair—
score’, where a higher score means that the residue is predicted more
strongly to be in that Ab’s epitope. An optional additional step iden—
tifies surface patches on the Ag, which contain multiple residues
with high ‘residue—scores’. Each patch is assigned a ‘patch—score’
which is the average ‘residue—score’ of all residues in the patch that
are above the ‘cutoff—score’ (see later). Higher ‘patch—scores’ repre—
sent stronger predictions. PEASE was successfully applied for
blindly predicting the epitopes of 12 Abs of the Vaccinia virus, later
confirmed experimentally by several methods, including X—ray crys—
tallography (Sela—Culang et al., 2014).

2 The PEASE server

The PEASE server contains two main pages: the ‘software’ page (in
which the user uploads and specifies the input) and the results page.
Additional tabs include an overview, a description of the input and
output, a tutorial and FAQs. To better demonstrate PEASE, we de—
scribe it later, using as an example, the epitope prediction for D8 sur—
face protein of the Vaccinia virus, and its JE11 Ab (which were not
included in the training set; Sela—Culang et al., 2014). The expected
execution time for a submission is about 3 min for each Ag chain.

2.1 Inputs

On the ‘software’ page, the user should provide the Ag structure by ei—
ther uploading the protein data bank (PDB) file or specifying the PDB
code (4E9O in the D8 case). If the Ag structure is a computational
model, the user should upload the Ag sequence file as well (to allow
the PEASE algorithm to identify residues with no coordinates). Then,
the user should specify for which Ag chain/s the prediction should be
applied (chain X in the case of 4E9O structure). The predictions will
be made separately for each of the selected chains. Finally, the Ab se—
quence should be uploaded or pasted in a text—box and should include
both heavy and light chains. If the user provides a job name and an
E—mail address, a message will be sent with a link to the results page,
or to an error message, once the job is completed.

2.2 Parameters

The performance of prediction methods may be assessed by the re—
call and precision measures. Typically, there is a tradeoff between
these two measures where one’s improvement comes at the expense
of the other. Depending on the objective of the epitope prediction,
one may prefer a higher recall (i.e. reducing false negative) or higher
precision (i.e. reducing false positive). The user may control this
tradeoff by modifying the ‘patch—size’ and ‘cutoff—score’ parameters
from their default values (5 and 0.6, respectively). Increasing the
‘patch—size’ will lead to a higher recall, but may result in lower preci—
sion. Increasing the ‘cutoff—score’ may increase precision, but may
also reduce the number of predicted patches. We suggest starting

2.3 Outputs

The PEASE results page (Fig. 1A) includes links to the results files
(see later) and a jmol java applet showing the Ag 3D structure col—
ored according to PEASE ‘residue—scores’ (Fig. 1B). Ag residues are
colored from blue (low ‘residue—score’—a low chance to be in the
epitope) to red (high ‘residue—score’—a high chance to be in the epi—
tope). The user can rotate the colored Ag and consider the predic—
tions in the context of the 3D structure. The PDB file of the Ag that
contains the ‘residue—scores’ may be downloaded and viewed in any
other protein 3D viewer. A pair of high scoring residues colored
pink can be observed in the middle of Figure 1B. These residues
(K13 and K14) were experimentally validated as being in the JE11
epitope (Sela—Culang et al., 2014). The ‘residue—scores’ themselves
are listed in text and HTML files (Fig. 1C shows the first N’ five resi—
dues). The ‘residue—scores’ may also be viewed along the Ag se—
quence as a graph (Fig. 1D). For the patches, a list of the patches
and the corresponding ‘patch—scores’ is provided in text and HTML
files. Figure 1E shows the first five patches, four of which were ex—
perimentally validated as being in the epitope. PEASE is modular, in
the sense that one may use the file with the ‘residue—scores’ (Fig. 1C)
as input for other methods that cluster residues based on a score and
their spatial location, instead of considering the patches suggested
by PEASE.

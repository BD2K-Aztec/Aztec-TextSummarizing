ABSTRACT

Summary: Drug versus Disease (DVD) provides a pipeline, available
through R or Cytoscape, for the comparison of drug and disease
gene expression profiles from public microarray repositories.
Negatively correlated profiles can be used to generate hypotheses of
drug-repurposing, whereas positively correlated profiles may be used
to infer side effects of drugs. DVD allows users to compare drug and
disease signatures with dynamic access to databases Array Express,
Gene Expression Omnibus and data from the Connectivity Map.
Availability and implementation: R package (submitted to
Bioconductor) under GPL 3 and Cytoscape plug-in freely available
for download at www.ebi.ac.uk/saezrodriguez/DVD/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Multiple methods based on matching gene expression signatures
have been proposed to identify anti-correlated drug and disease
proﬁles (Hu et al., 2009; Sirota et al., 2011). The central para-
digm is that a drug compound, which shows the opposite effect
on gene expression to the observed for a disease could be used to
treat that particular disease. These methods have resulted in
hypotheses of differential uses (repurposing) for existing com-
pounds that have been validated experimentally. This highlights
the potential power of mining existing safe compounds for repur-
posing, which does not require the expensive and extensive initial
design and clinical phases of drug discovery. It is expected
that analysing new and existing data from public repositories
such as Array Express (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/), Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and
the Connectivity Map (CMap) (www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/)
using these methods will become increasingly popular in compu-
tational drug discovery (Iorio et al., 2012).

Motivated by this, we have developed Drug versus Disease
(DvD), an R package to ‘match’ drug and disease proﬁles.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

This is done by making use of gene set enrichment analysis
(Subramanian et al., 2005) and visualizing the ﬁnal results in
networks containing clusters of similar drugs and diseases.
DvD differs from existing web servers and databases (such as
ProﬁleChaser, MARQ and SPIED, see Supplementary Material)
in that it can dynamically access both Array Express and GEO to
generate input proﬁles. With DvD, users can automatically com-
pare input proﬁles to reference drug data from CMap and dis-
ease proﬁles curated from GEO. This reference data has
associated networks where, unlike similar tools, drugs or diseases
exerting similar effects on transcription are grouped into clusters.
DvD is ﬂexible, offering customizable and default data options
for the input proﬁles and the reference data. The Cytoscape
(www.cytoscape.org/) plug-in provides a user interface to the
full DvD pipeline, as well as a visualization platform for the
results. In the ﬁnal networks, drug or disease nodes are linked
to the DrugBank (www.drugbank.ca/) and Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/) web browsers,
respectively.

2 ANALYSIS PIPELINE

The DvD pipeline provides a number of processing options to
generate genome-wide expression proﬁles from microarray ex-
periments (see Fig. 1A). Options to import data from local direc-
tories and Array Express or GEO are supported (Davis et al.,
2007; Kauffmann et al., 2009). Data are normalized using either
rma or mas5 (Irizarry et al., 2003). DvD will automatically an-
notate, ﬁlter and combine probes to HUGO genes for the
Affymetrix platforms HG—Ul33A, HG—Ul33A-2 and HG-
Ul33-Plus2 using BiomaRt (Durinck et al., 2009). Annotation
ﬁles can be passed to DvD to process data from other platforms.
Probes mapping to multiple gene identiﬁers are removed.
Multiple probes mapping to the same gene can be converted
using the average or maximal intensities, median polish or by
selecting the probe with the highest variance across all arrays.
DvD expects as input either a drug or disease proﬁle. Using
this, and the experimental design factors from the Array Express
and GEO databases, DvD identiﬁes a main factor for the experi-
ment. In this way, unlike existing methods, DvD is able to
calculate differential expression (Smyth et al., 2004) between
levels of the main factor, stratiﬁed by a second factor (see

GenerateProfiles imports the data and normalizes CEL ﬁles where neces-
sary. Probes t0 Genes maps Affymetrix probes to HUGO gene symbols
using BiomaRt. Finally, differential expression statistics are calculated
using limma. SelectRankedLists can be used to select a subset of the
contrasts output from generate proﬁles. Classzfyprofile can take input
from generateProfiles, selectrankedlists or the users own prepro-
cessed data. This function calculates and identiﬁes signiﬁcant

Supplementary Material). Given a ranked list of differential ex-
pression, either from DvD or by providing preprocessed data,
DvD deﬁnes gene sets. These can be a ﬁxed number chosen a
priori or determined by the number of signiﬁcantly differentially
expressed genes. Enrichment scores are then calculated using
either the Kolomgorov—Smirnov—based statistic (Iorio et al.,
2010; Subramanian et al., 2005) or the weighted signed statistic
(Zhang et al., 2008) by querying the reference dataset with these
gene sets. Signiﬁcance of enrichment scores is determined by
comparison with an empirical null distribution. Scores can be
corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using either
Benjamini—Hochberg correction or q-value method. Proﬁles pro-
ducing signiﬁcant scores are ﬁnally assigned to clusters using
single or average linkage. In the latter case, the average score
for a cluster is deﬁned as either the mean or the median distance
to each proﬁle in the cluster.

2.1 DVD data packages

Two associated data packages, cMap2data and
DrungDiseasedata provide default reference ranked expression
proﬁles and clusters. The cMap2data is based on the CMap
version 2 dataset, which contains 6100 hybridizations of 1309

different compounds. The merged proﬁles obtained by Iorio
et al. (2010) were used to generate a single gene level ranked
proﬁle for each of the 1309 compounds. Disease proﬁles are
deﬁned for 45 diseases based on data from GEO with associated
clusters. Analysis of the disease and compound clusters demon-
strated viable results. For example, one drug cluster was signiﬁ-
cantly enriched for Histone deacetylase inhibitors, and a disease
cluster was found that contained multiple proﬁles of different
cancers (see Supplementary Material).

2.2 Cytoscape plug-in

The Cytoscape plug-in uses the Rserve framework. The main R
wrapper provides a graphical interface to the full DvD pipeline
and information on the drug and disease proﬁles contained in the
Ddeata package (Fig. 1B). This is obtained from DrugBank
for the drugs and MeSH for the disease proﬁles. Furthermore,
it links DvD to other Cytoscape plugins for further analysis. This
could include mapping differential expression proﬁles associated
with drug candidates obtained from DvD on to signalling
networks (see Supplementary Material).

3 RESULTS

To illustrate the use of DvD in drug repurposing we analysed
several disease datasets available from GEO. We compared them
with the 1309 compounds in the CMap using DvD and con-
sidered signiﬁcant those connections with q-value < 0.05. A pros-
tate cancer proﬁle (gsel7906) had seven signiﬁcant matches with
ﬁve being negative (Fig. 1B). The strongest negative correlation
was with Estradiol, a known treatment for prostate cancer.
For a breast cancer proﬁle (gse5847), we found the third highest
inverse correlation with Tamoxifen, a similarly well-known treat-
ment for breast cancer. The compound scoring highest was
Ranitidine, a Histamine receptor type-2 (H2) antagonist, which
has previously analysed as a potential treatment for breast cancer
(Bolton et al., 2000). Finally, we analysed a type II diabetes
proﬁle (gse15653) and found Phenformin and Torasemide at
the seventh and ninth highest therapeutic scores, respectively.
Interestingly, Finasteride scored higher than both of these
known treatments for type II diabetes, with the third strongest
negative correlation. Finasteride inhibits the type-2 5 alpha-
reductase enzyme, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestos-
terone. Testosterone is known to be important in glucose
homeostasis and lipid metabolism (Saad, 2009). These results
were not obtained when analysing these three proﬁles using
CMap (Supplementary Material), showing the value in combin-
ing replicate experiments to generate proﬁles for comparison.

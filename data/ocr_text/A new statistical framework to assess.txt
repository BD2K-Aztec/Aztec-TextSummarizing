ABSTRACT

Motivation: Progress in protein biology depends on the reliability of re-
sults from a handful of computational techniques, structural alignments
being one. Recent reviews have highlighted substantial inconsistencies
and differences between alignment results generated by the ever-grow-
ing stock of structural alignment programs. The lack of consensus on how
the quality of structural alignments must be assessed has been identified
as the main cause for the observed differences. Current methods assess
structural alignment quality by constructing a scoring function that at-
tempts to balance conflicting criteria, mainly alignment coverage and ﬁ-
delity of structures under superposition. This traditional approach to
measuring alignment quality, the subject of considerable literature, has
failed to solve the problem. Further development along the same lines is
unlikely to rectify the current deficiencies in the field.

Results: This paper proposes a new statistical framework to assess
structural alignment quality and significance based on loss/ess informa-
tion compression. This is a radical departure from the traditional ap-
proach of formulating scoring functions. It links the structural alignment
problem to the general class of statistical inductive inference problems,
solved using the information-theoretic criterion of minimum message
length. Based on this, we developed an efficient and reliable measure of
structural alignment quality, I-value. The performance of I-value is
demonstrated in comparison with a number of popular scoring func-
tions, on a large collection of competing alignments. Our analysis
shows that I-value provides a rigorous and reliable quantification of
structural alignment quality, addressing a major gap in the field.

1 INTRODUCTION

A protein structural alignment is an assignment of residue—resi-
due correspondences between the amino acids of two or more
proteins, based on their 3D structure. Protein structural align-
ments support basic and applied research in molecular biology.
For example, they reveal how protein families evolve, identify
patterns of conservation in amino acid sequences that fold into
similar structures, facilitate comparative modelling of structures
from sequence and guide experimental solutions to structures
using crystallographic molecular replacement (Konagurthu
et al., 2006).

The last four decades have seen the development of many
methods aimed at generating biologically meaningful structural

alignments. While the number of new methods is estimated to be
doubling roughly every ﬁve years (Hasegawa and Holm, 2009),
several comparative studies have observed many inconsistencies
and paradoxes when comparing the alignments generated by
existing methods. Noteworthy among these studies are those
by Michael Levitt (Kolodny et al., 2005), Liisa Holm
(Hasegawa and Holm, 2009) and Manfred Sippl (Sippl and
Wiederstein, 2008; Slater et al., 2013) and colleagues.
A common theme emerging from all these studies is the need
for a systematic framework to asses the quality of structural
alignments. While a handful of quantitatively rigorous statistical
models for structure comparison have been proposed for this,
there is no consensus regarding their usefulness.

This is in stark contrast to the state-of-the-art in the closely
related problem of aligning protein sequences, where many rigor-
ous statistical models have been proposed to quantitatively assess
sequence alignment quality (Allison et al., 1992; Altschul, l99l;
Karlin and Altschul, 1990). This has, in turn, helped standardize
the task of measuring sequence alignment quality and, thus, the
task of generating meaningful sequence alignments.

In this work, we begin by examining the foundations of how
structural alignments are currently assessed. Guided by good
biological insights, current structural aligners use a scoring func-
tion to quantify the structural alignment quality. This has trad-
itionally been achieved by combining the contributions of a small
number of important criteria into an easy-to-compute scoring
function. [For a comprehensive list of commonly used scoring
functions, see Hasegawa and Holm (2009)].

Overwhelrningly, the two key criteria that various current
measures use are coverage and ﬁdelity. Typically, coverage meas-
ures the number of correspondences (or equivalences) in an
alignment and, in some cases, also considers the number of
gaps. Fidelity, measures how similarly positioned the aligned
residues are. This is commonly (but not always) based on the
root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) computed after the best
rigid-body transformation of corresponding residues is found.

To search for the best structural alignment, the goal of the
aligners is to simultaneously maximize coverage and ﬁdelity.
However, these two objectives are in direct conﬂict with each
other. We observe that most of the current proliferation of struc-
tural alignment scoring functions arise from attempts to reconcile
this conﬂict, that is, existing scoring functions differ mainly in
how they combine these two criteria. As the reviews show, exist-
ing scoring functions do not generate consistent results, even
when aligning structures that have only moderately diverged in
evolution (Hasegawa and Holm, 2009; Kolodny et al., 2005;
Slater et al., 2013).

Structural alignment quality using data compression

 

Because this traditional approach of formulating a scoring
function has been explored extensively over the last four decades,
further development along the same lines is unlikely to provide
any major breakthrough. Therefore, this ﬁeld will stand to bene-
ﬁt by departing from the traditional approaches and exploring
radically new ones. This paper is a step in this direction.

Structural alignment as an inductive inference problem. The
goal of inductive inference is to propose a theory (or hypothesis)
that is able to best explain the observed data. Structural align-
ment can thus be seen an instance of the general class of inference
problems. In this context, an alignment (i.e. residue—residue cor-
respondence) is a hypothesis that attempts to explain the residue—
residue relationships between two protein structures, whose
observed data is the (x, y, z) coordinates of the structures.

In general, any hypothesis has a certain (descriptive) complex-
ity. A complex hypothesis with more free parameters can predict
(or fit, explain) a greater variety of observed data than a simpler
hypothesis. Therefore, in order to choose the best hypothesis for
any inference problem, one is confronted with a trade-off
between hypothesis complexity and its ﬁt with the observations.

For structural alignments, this trade-off is related to the con-
ﬂict between coverage and ﬁdelity. Coverage (in various forms
handled in the current scoring functions) is a crude approxima-
tion of the (alignment) hypothesis complexity. Similarly, the ﬁ-
delity (or goodness of ﬁt with the observed data) of a structural
alignment is approximated using RMSD of superposition or
using some distance measure. These rudimentary approxima-
tions cause the existing scoring functions to introduce several
tunable parameters in an attempt to balance the contributions
between coverage and ﬁdelity of structural alignments. This has
been a major source of the inconsistencies observed in
alignments.

The ﬁeld of statistical learning and inference provides rigorous
approaches to address this trade-off systematically. In the early
1960s, several landmark papers proposed links between inductive
inference and information theory (Kolmogorov, 1965;
Solomonoff, 1960; Wallace and Boulton, 1968). The Minimum
Message Length (MML) principle Wallace and Boulton, 1968)
provided the ﬁrst practical information-theoretic criterion for
hypothesis selection based on observations. It is used here to
rigorously assess structural alignment quality and reliably differ-
entiate between competing alignments.

Structural alignment quality and lossless information compres-
sion. The pioneering work of Claude E. Shannon (Shannon,
1948) provides the means to quantify information: the length
of the shortest code required to transmit, losslessly, an observed
event. This can be understood as the length of the shortest mes-
sage needed to communicate the event losslessly between an im-
aginary sender (Alice) and receiver (Bob).

In this context, the structural alignment problem can be
rationalized as a communication process between Alice and
Bob, where Alice has access to the (x, y, z) coordinates of two
protein structures and she wants to encode and transmit this
information to Bob losslessly. Two possible scenarios then
arise: (i) If the two are unrelated to each other structurally,
Alice cannot do better than to encode and transmit the informa-
tion of the two structures independently, one after another. That
is, knowledge of one structure (called reference, or S) does not
provide information about the other (called target, or T) and,

thus, knowledge of S cannot be used to compress T. This form of
independent transmission is termed here as the null model mes-
sage. (ii) On the other hand, if the two structures are structurally
related (i.e. there is a meaningful alignment between the two),
knowledge of S reveals information about T. The more similar
the structures, the more information one reveals about the other.
Alice can use this similarity to compress and transmit the infor-
mation of the target structure using the information of the ref-
erence. For Bob to decode the information of the target losslessly
(i.e. to the precision with which Alice sees it), he will require the
structural information of the reference structure plus the infor-
mation of its proposed relationship (i.e. the structural alignment)
with the target. This will allow Alice to encode the target more
concisely than stating the target structure using a null model. We
call this form of transmission, the alignment model message (to
contrast it with the null model message, where the structures are
transmitted independently).

We note that this information-theoretic framework for struc-
tural alignment is intuitive. If the proposed alignment relation-
ship is a poor one, then the encoded alignment model message
will be inefﬁcient (i.e. long). Alternatively, if the alignment rela-
tionship is a good one, then the transmission of the target be-
comes efﬁcient (i.e. short). Therefore, the total message length of
the lossless transmission of coordinate information (using an
alignment hypothesis) forms an excellent measure to assess struc-
tural alignment quality. It follows that the best alignment is the
one with the shortest total message length of lossless transmission.

While we have intuitively rationalized this framework as a
communication process, this message paradigm is also backed
by mathematical rigour. Formally, let A denote some alignment
between structural coordinates S and T. Using the product rule
of probability over three events A, S and T we have:

P(A&S&T) =P(A) X P(SlA) X P(T|S&A)
=P(A) x P(S) x P(T|S&A)

where P(A&S&T) gives the joint probability of alignment A for
structures S and T, P(A) the prior probability of the alignment,
P(T|S&A) the likelihood of T given S and A. Note, P(SlA) is
P(S) because S and A are assumed to be independent.

Shannon’s mathematical theory of communication (Shannon,
1948) gives the relationship between the shortest message length
[(15) to communicate losslessly any observation E, and its prob-
ability P(E) as [(E) = — log (P(E)). Technically, I(E) denotes the
Shannon information content of E.

Restating equation 1 in terms of information content, we
obtain:

(1)

I(A&S&T) = I(A) + I(S) + I(T|S&A) (2)

where transmitting the information of the reference structure S
takes I(S) bits, transmitting the alignment information takes I(A)
bits and transmitting the information of the target structure T
using A and S takes I(T|S&A) bits.

Our message length measure has the following three key prop-
erties, which are not achieved by previous scoring functions:

(1) The difference between the lengths of the messages needed
to transmit the structures S and T using any two align-
ments, gives their log-odds posterior ratio.

As a result, any two competing alignment hypotheses A1
and A2 can now be compared based on their message
lengths. Therefore, the best alignment hypothesis A* is
the one that results in the shortest message length value
of I(A*&S&T).

(2) Our measure permits a natural null hypothesis test where
the statistical signiﬁcance of any proposed alignment hy-
pothesis can be estimated. Any alignment hypothesis A
whose message length I(A&S&T) is worse (longer) than
that of the null model message, I(S&T) = I(S) + [(7), must
be rejected.

(3) This measure provides an objective, formal trade-off be-
tween the complexity of the alignment (I(A)) and the ﬁ-
delity of the structures given the proposed alignment
(I(T|S&A)). Unlike previous attempts, these terms are
not ad hoc approximations, as they represent rigorous es-
timations of Shannon information content based on loss-
less encoding and compression.

2 METHODS
2.1 Computation of the null model message length

The null model message corresponds to the transmission of protein co-
ordinates without an alignment hypothesis. (In this work, we consider
only the Co, coordinates.) We have previously deﬁned [for a completely
different problem (Konagurthu et al., 2012)] a null model encoding of
coordinates along a protein chain. We will brieﬂy summarize this ap-
proach, as elements of this encoding are used and developed further in
our current work.

The null model encoding relies on the observation that the distance
between successive Co, atoms in a protein chain is highly constrained to
3.8 :l: 0.2 (s.d.) A. For a chain of coordinates {p1, p2, . . . , pn}, any coord-
inate pi+1 can be transmitted given the previous p,, by ﬁrst transmitting
the distance r,~ between p,- and pi+1 using a normal distribution N (r; ,u, a)
stated to e = 0.001 A accuracy, with ,u = 3.8 A and o= :l: 0.2 A. (e = 0.001
reﬂects the precision of statement of coordinate data, which is three places
after the decimal point as reported in the protein data bank.). We repre-
sent the length of this encoding as I(ri). With this information trans-
mitted, Bob now knows that pi+1 lies on a sphere of radius r,~ centred
at p,, but does not yet know where exactly on the sphere it is. Assuming
that pi+1 is distributed unifome over the surface of the sphere, trans-
mitter Alice can discretize the sphere’s surface into cells, each of area 62.
Using this discretization, pi+1 can be transmitted as cell number ci+1.
The numbering convention of the discretization is in the shared
codebook. With the knowledge of pi, r,~ and c,, Bob can
reconstruct pi+1 to the stated accuracy. Stating the cell number takes
I(c,-) = — log 2 = log 2(47rr12) — 210g 26 bits.

When sending a chain of Co, coordinates {p1, p2, . . . , pn} over a null
model message, we assume that p1 is the origin and, hence, does not need
to be transmitted as part of the message. Even if p1 is not assumed to be
the origin, its encoding will add a ﬁxed one-time cost to the message
length. Thus, to transmit the chain of points p1, p2, . . . , pn over the null
model, Alice needs to send to Bob the number n of Co, atoms in the chain,
followed by incrementally transmitting (using the method above) p2 given

p1, p3 given p2 and so on, until all coordinates are transmitted. Alice can
transmit the number n over a integer distribution. Wallace and Patrick
(1993) gave an efﬁcient code (Iinteger(n)) for transmitting any positive in-
teger n > 0.

Therefore, the total message length required to send all the coord-
inates over the null model message takes Inu11(p1, . . . , pn)=Iint,,ger(n)+

z: (I(ri) + I(c,)) bits.

Using the above, the coordinates of structures S={S1, S2, . . . , SISI}
and T = {T1, T2, . . . , Tm} are sent as independent chains of coordinates
over the null model, taking Inu11(S&T) = Inuu(S) + Inuu(T) bits.

2.2 Computation of the alignment model message length

Equation 2 gives the amount of information required to transmit the
coordinates of structures S and T using the alignment hypothesis A.
To estimate this, the explanation message involves transmitting: the
coordinates of S, the residue—residue correspondences proposed by
the alignment in A and, ﬁnally, the coordinates of T using the informa-
tion of S and A.

2.2.] Transmitting the coordinates of S This is achieved by sending
the coordinates of S= {S1, S2, . . . , SISI} over the null model. Therefore,
 = Inull(Sl’ S29 ° ° ° 9  

2.2.2 Transmitting the correspondences in A Any alignment can be
described as a string switching between three states: match (‘m’), insertion
(‘i’) and deletion (‘d’) states. This alignment string can be transmitted
losslessly using a ﬁrst-order Markov model.

To transmit an alignment over a 3-state Markov chain, we use an
approach similar to the adaptive encoding method used by Wallace and
Boulton (1969) over a multinomial (n-state) distribution. The adaptive
encoding here requires maintaining nine running counters, one for each
possible transition probability, all initialized to 1. Traversing the align-
ment string left to right, for every observed transition, Alice estimates its
probability by dividing the current value of the corresponding transition
counter by the sum of all counters from previous to any state. After the
probability is estimated, Alice encodes the current alignment state using
this probability and then increments the corresponding counter by 1. The
code length to encode each state is the negative logarithm of its estimated
probability. Summing each transition over the entire alignment gives the
code length, I(A).

2.2.3 Transmitting the coordinates of T given S and A With
the information of S and A known to Bob, Alice can now use that in-
formation to encode the coordinate information of T. Intuitively, our
encoding is based on the fact that when scanning A from left to right,
Alice views T as runs of coordinates that alternate between blocks of
insertions and matches with respect to S and the stated alignment.
Note that all deletion blocks (with respect to S) in T are ignored as
they contain no information to be transmitted about T. More formally,
let A yield {21, . . . ,Im} insertion blocks, where any 2;, represents a con-
secutive stretch of coordinates that are inserted in T (with respect to S).
Each insertion block is transmitted as a null message taking
lins(T|S&A) = 2:; Inm1(Ik)bitS-

What remains to be sent to Bob are the coordinates in T aligned to
corresponding coordinates in S, that is, the matches. Let {Si1 , Sb, . . . , Sin}
and {Y},,7},,...,T-n} where 15i1<...in5|S| and
1 5 jl < .. .1}, 5 |T|, denote the ordered set of corresponding coordinates
in S and T, respectively. Bob already knows S and the alignment. From
the alignment information he can infer the indexes of the aligned residue—
residue correspondences: (i1, jl), (i2, 12), ..., (in, 1}) between S and T.
Thus, Alice can use the following procedure to transmit the aligned co-
ordinates in T. To start the procedure, the ﬁrst three matched coordinates
of {7}], T1,, T13} are sent over the null model message taking: Istarmp(T IS

&A) = Inuu(TJ-l, 7],, TjS)bits. Alice then incrementally sends the remaining
aligned coordinates of T as follows. To transmit the current aligned co-

ordinate 7}k+1 , Alice considers only the set of (previous plus current)
aligned coordinates {Tl-1, T1,, ..., Tjk, Tm}. This set is orthogonally
transformed to the set {Tl-1, T1,, .. . , Tjk, Tjkﬂ}, such that it minimizes
the least-square error between {Sip ..., Sik} and {Tl-1, ..., Tjk}. Using
this setup, Alice can transmit 7’ij over a directional distribution on a
sphere. This is achieved by ﬁrst transmitting the radius rk = ||Tjk+1 — Tjk ||

over a normal distribution with the same procedure described for formu-
lating a null model message. This allows Alice to state Tij as a point on
a sphere with radius rk centred at Tjk. However, we do not state it over a
uniform distribution (which would make it a null model description), as
the knowledge of correspondence of Tm, with Sik+1 gives clues about its
position on the sphere (provided the assigned correspondence is a ‘good’
one). Because Bob already knows the corresponding point Sim, after
transmitting rk, Alice can use a directional probability distribution to
state 7’ij more concisely. In directional statistics, the von Mises—
Fisher distribution gives the probability density function (PDF) on the
surface of any sphere in p-dimensions. In three dimensions, the PDF on
the surface of a unit sphere is (Fisher, 1953; Mardia and Jupp, 1999):
 Ia, K): mek—IC—eﬂeKM-x —

Using this distribution to transmit Tij, we compute xk+1 as the
direction cosines of the vector Tij — Tjk, and ilk“ as the direction
cosines of the vector Sik+1 — Tjk. The probability of stating Tm, to the
required precision (that is, €=0.001  precision on each component)

counting for the scaling of the sphere of radius r,~ to a unit sphere.
Transmission of each Tij requires the concentration parameter K. We
use the maximum-likelihood estimator based on the available superpos-
ition [see Mardia and J upp (1999)]. Therefore, the code length to state x
using von Mises—Fisher is: 1mm: — log (12(2)) bits.

Each Tm, is transmitted iteratively over this procedure, which we term
adaptive superposition. Thus, the message length required to transmit the

matched points in T with respect to their corresponding point in S is
1m,,,h(ns&.4) =I,,,.,u,(ns&.4) + 2:; [Mom bits. Combining the
message lengths of transmitting coordinates in the insertion and matched
blocks gives I(T|S&A) = lins(T|S&A) + ImatCh(T|S&A) bits. An illustra-
tion of this procedure is shown in Figure 1.

2.3 Measure of alignment quality

I(A&S&T) is used as the measure of alignment quality. We call this
measure I-value, indicating a value measuring the information content
in the structural coordinates of S and T, given the structural alignment A
as a model of compression. The smaller the I-value, the better the align-
ment. It follows that for competing alignments A1 and A2, if the I-value
of A1 is smaller than that of A2 by, for example, 15 bits, then A1 is
215 times more likely than A2 (see property 1 of this measure shown
in Equation 3). Further, any alignment A for which I(S&T&A)>
Inuu(S&T) = Inuu(S) + Inuu(T) can be rejected (see property 2 of this meas-
ure under ‘Structural alignment quality and lossless information
compression’).

Handling shifts and rotations. So far we estimated the I-value under the
rigid model of structural alignment. This model can be generalised to
handle plastic deformations commonly observed in protein evolution,
such as hinge rotations and shifts. Handling these deformations requires
a modiﬁcation in the way I( T|S&A) is estimated under a ﬂexible model of
transmission.

Without loss of generality, assume that T contains a certain number of
shifts and rotations, with respect to S, associated with its residues. In
computing I(T|S&A), alignment A is partitioned at the residues in T
about which the shifts and rotations are deﬁned. For example, consider
below an alignment containing a hinge rotation about residue 10 of T

 

(d)

Fig. 1. An idealized example of the adaptive superposition used to send the
matched residues in T (in blue) incrementally given the knowledge of S (in
black). Both structures have 8 points and are assumed here to be in one-to-
one correspondence. Assume that Bob already knows the ﬁrst 3 points of
T. Alice sends the fourth point in T by superposing all previously matched
points between the two structures. (Green crosshairs shows the rotational
centre of superposition.) This orients the fourth point (in red) in T [or,
more generally, EH, , whose deviation from its corresponding Sik+1 can be
encoded over a von Mises—Fisher spherical distribution (see main text)]

(marked by *). Then, the alignment can be partitioned into two separate
parts as follows:
~k l l
123 4567890123 123 45 567890123
S --XXX---XXXXXXXXXX --XXX---XX XXXXXXXXX
T XXXXXXXXXX---XXXXX = XXXXXXXXXX + X---XXXXX
1234567890 12345 1234567890 0 12345
1 1 1

Let these partial alignments be denoted as A(T1, . . ., T10) and
A(T10, . . ., T15), identifying the start and end residue indexes in T
about which the partition is deﬁned. Then I(T|S&A) is computed as
I(T|S&A(T1,...,T10))+I(T|S&A(T10,...,T15)) using the procedure
described earlier. More generally, if there are k residues in T about
which shifts/rotations are deﬁned, the full alignment A is parti-

tioned into k + 1 partial alignments: A(T1, . . . , Til), A(T,-,, . . . , Tb), .. . ,
A(T,-k,...,Tm), where i1<i2<  <ik<|T|. Given these partitions,
I(T|S&A) can be computed as I(T|S&A(T1,..., T,1)) +  +I(T|S&
A(ik, . . ., IT |)). This immediately poses another inference question:

Given an alignment A of S and T, how many shifted/rotated residues
does it contain? We note that adding a shift/hinge has an overhead
which must pay for itself with a better ﬁt if it is to be accepted.

Inference of shifted/rotated residues: A dynamic programming algo-
rithm is used to optimally partition A minimizing I(T|S&A).

The algorithm ﬁrst constructs a matrix M of size |T| x |T| such that
each cell M(i, j) (1 5 i < j 5 |T|) stores the value I(T|S&A(i, . . . ,j)). The
best partition of A is then computed using the following dynamic pro-
gramming recurrence relationship:

j_.1 {

’P1,...,’=m1n 4
( J) - 73(1,...,i)+M(i,j) VISJSITI 0

1= 1
where any 73(1, . . . , i) gives the optimal partitioning up to the ith residue
in T, 1 5 i5 |T|. At the end of this procedure the value 73(1, ...,|T|)
gives the component message length I(T|S&A) of Equation 2, in a way
that handles shift and hinge rotations.

2.4 The time complexity of computing I-value

Using the rigid model of transmission (i.e.without handling the hinge-
rotations and shift), the computation of I(A&S&T) is linear in the size of

linear. While the linearity of the ﬁrst two is clear, that of I(T|S&A) is not,
as it requires repeated adaptive superpositions. However, we have
recently proved sufﬁcient statistics for the orthogonal superposition prob-
lem that allows each updated superposition to be computed as a constant-
tirne update over the previous ones (Konagurthu et al., 2014), making the
computation of I(T|S&A), and I-value under rigid superposition, linear.
On the other hand, using the ﬂexible model which allows for hinge rota-
tions and shifts, the computation of I(A&S&T) is quadratic, as it is

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We have compared the quality of our I—value measure (using the
ﬂexible model described in sections 2.3) with popular scoring
functions DALI, TM-Score, MI, SI, STRUCTAL, LGA_S3,
GDT_TS, SAS and GSAS, using a large data set of alignments
produced by the popular structural alignment methods DALI,
TM-Align, LGA, CE and FATCAT. [Refer to Hasegawa and
Holm (2009) for references of these scores/aligners] Due to lack
of space, we restrict our results herein to those obtained when
comparing the DALI Score, TM-Score, and I—value measures,
using TM-Align and DALI as the structural alignment gener-
ators. We refer to our online supplementary material for the
remaining results.

Our ﬁrst experiment tests the ability of the scoring functions to
differentiate between pairs of structural domains that vary along
the hierarchical groups deﬁned by SCOP (Lo Conte et al.,
2000)—Class, Fold, Superfamily and Family. To do this, we
randomly selected a set of 500 ‘pivot’ domains from SCOP
and, for each of these pivots, we randomly selected ﬁve other
domains whose relationship with the pivot varies progressively:
(i) Same-Family, (ii) Same-Superfamily (but not Family), (iii)
Same-Fold (but not Superfamily and Family), (iv) Same-Class
(but different below this level) and (v) Decoy (or different-Class).

This results in a collection of 500 x 5 SCOP domains. We then
aligned each pivot with each of its ﬁve counterparts, generating a
total of 2500 alignments per alignment program. Finally, we as-
sessed all these alignments using the selected scoring functions.

Figure 2 shows (some of) the box-whisker plots resulting from
these comparisons. (As mentioned earlier, more results are given
in Supplementary Table S1 of the online supplementary mater-
ial.) Rows in this table denote the alignment method (DALI/
TM-Align) used to generate the 2500 alignments in our collec-
tion. Columns denote the scoring function (DALI, TM-Score, [-
value) used to compute the alignment score. Each cell in the table
is a box-whisker plot that displays the numerical scores (as quar-
tile marks) produced by each [alignment method, scoring func-
tion] pair, over the ﬁve groups of (500) alignments each. Note
that for I—value, we show the compression gained (in bits) over
the null model message length, that is, the (Null—I—value) message
lengths. Thus, the greater the compression, the better the align-
ment. (In contrast, when using raw I—values rather than compres-
sion with respect to Null, the smaller the I-value the better the
alignment.)

A cursory inspection of these box-whisker plots indicates that,
for the given alignments (which might not be the best/optimal
ones), all scoring functions consistently differentiate between
the SCOP groups to some extent. However, none of the scoring
functions can be said to separate the SCOP groups cleanly nor to
be clearly better than the others. This reﬂects partly the fuzzy
classiﬁcation boundaries of SCOP, and partly the quality of the
(sub-optimal) alignments of domain pairs generated by popular
alignment methods. For example, for TM-Score it has been
claimed that the numerical score of < 0.5 corresponds to align-
ments not being in the same fold. However, we observe from the
box-whisker plots in the second column of the table (the Fold
group), that >3 quartiles of the alignments have a TM-score of
<05. Inspecting the box-whisker plots at the same-Fold group,

RMSD (Angstroms)

Fig. 3. Sieving of the two ambiguous alignments reported by Zu-Kang and Sippl (1996) for the pair 1RCF and 3CHY. The X—axis gives the RMSD of
each sieved alignment, while the Y-axis gives the scoring function used: (a) DALI, (b) TM-Score and (c) I-value. The labels in the ﬁgures correspond to
the NEquiv values during sieving. For the TM-Score plot (b), the horizontal dotted line is the threshold for fold-level relationship. For the I-value plot
(c), the horizontal line corresponds to the NULL model message length. The sieved alignments below this line are statistically signiﬁcant

shows that a very large majority of alignments produced by
DALI and TM-Align and scored using I—value are seen to be
statistically signiﬁcant (i.e. with Null—I-value message length > 0),
with DALI alignments being more reliable than those generated
by TM-Align, judging by the compression gain at the level of
their respective medians. Interestingly, I—value seems to provide
the smallest of variations when comparing the results obtained

for the alignments generated by DALI to those generated by
TM-Align.

Upon closer inspection, the results of our experiment indicate
a signiﬁcant degree of disagreement between the respective
scores: only in 28% of the 2500 pivot-versus-counterpart align-
ments, all three scores agree on whether the alignment produced
by DALI or by TM-Align is the best. This disagreement

highlights the need for a generally accepted, rigorous alignment
score. Supplementary Table S2 in the online supplementary ma-
terial shows the full list of disagreeing pairs.

Our second experiment uses the set of ambiguous alignments
described by Zu-Kang and Sippl (1996), as case studies for the
various scoring functions ability to differentiate between very clo-
sely competing alignments. These alignments are indistinguish-
able in RMSD and number of equivalences (NEquiv). Table 1
compares the three scoring functions across ﬁve pairs of ambigu-
ous structural alignments. For each scoring function, the better
score of the two alignments for each pair is highlighted in bold. We
again observe disagreement in two out of the ﬁve pairs between
the scoring functions in their ability to decide which of the two
alignments is the best. We emphasize that this discrimination is
crucial for any scoring function to be useful as the basis of a search
method looking for the optimal alignment.

Let us illustrate the problems in using some of these scoring func-
tions for an optimal alignment search method, using the case study of
pair 3CHY v . 1RCF. To do so we ‘sieve’ each of the two ambiguous
alignments using the following procedure, similar to the one
described in Irving et al. (2001), to generate a number of competing
alignments at varying levels of NEquiv and RMSD: (i) Compute the
[NEquiv, RMSD] and corresponding DALI, TM-Score and I—value
of the current alignment. (ii) Delete the worst-ﬁtting aligned pair that
appears at the end of a ‘matched block’ in the alignment, and force
the deleted pair of residues to be unaligned. (iii) Repeat from Step 1
until the RMSD falls below a threshold value.

Studying the three sieving plots corresponding to DALI, TM-
Score and I—value in Figure 3, it is immediately clear that TM-
Score (Fig. 3b) does not produce any clear optima for this set of
competing alignments to choose from. In fact, TM-Score mono-
tonically increases towards the TM-scores of the unsieved align-
ments. On the other hand, I—value and the DALI score produce
clear, though conﬂicting optima. I—value points to an optima for
the sieved Alignment 1 at [NEquiv,RMSD] of [101,3.7 A],
whereas DALI points at [94, 3.17 A]. (Superpositions based on
these two alignments can be found in the online supplementary
material.) This reﬂects the standard dilemma human experts and
scoring functions face in choosing between two conﬂicting ob-
jectives. However, I-value objectively discriminates between the
two competing alignments in terms of the lossless compression
achieved. We emphasize that compression takes into account all
aspects of the trade-off—descriptive complexity of the alignment
hypothesis versus the quality of ﬁt of the alignment to the struc-
tural data—that manifests in the structural alignment problem.

Finally, as a proof of concept, we have also developed a quad-
ratic-time dynamic programming heuristic to search for the op-
timum I—value alignment. Currently this alignment heuristic is
restricted to the rigid (and not ﬂexible) model of computing
the component message length I(T | S, A). Details of the heuristic
search are beyond the scope of the current article, given the page
limitations. Our implementation of this alignment heuristic based
on I—value is available for use from our website.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The importance of ﬁnding biologically meaningful structural
alignments has led to the intensive development of methods for

generating alignments and evaluating their quality. However,
these methods produce conﬂicting results and none has been
generally accepted as clearly superior.

Here we have described a measure of alignment quality,
I—value, that uses the information content of messages that loss-
lessly compress the Ca atoms of a pair of protein structures,
given a proposed alignment. A lower I—value signiﬁes a superior
alignment. The method contains no adjustable parameters, as it is
built on a formal Bayesian principle of minimum message length
inference.

Examination of competing alignments over many pairs of pro-
tein structures demonstrates that I—value can accurately distin-
guish between competing structural alignments in cases in which
other methods either cannot signiﬁcantly distinguish the quality
of these possibilities, or do not agree in the selection of a best
one.

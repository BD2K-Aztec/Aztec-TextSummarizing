ABSTRACT

Motivation: Automatic tracking of cells in multidimensional time-lapse
fluorescence microscopy is an important task in many biomedical ap-
plications. A novel framework for objective evaluation of cell tracking
algorithms has been established under the auspices of the IEEE
International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2013 Cell Tracking
Challenge. In this article, we present the logistics, datasets, methods
and results of the challenge and lay down the principles for future uses
of this benchmark.

Results: The main contributions of the challenge include the creation
of a comprehensive video dataset repository and the definition of ob-
jective measures for comparison and ranking of the algorithms. With
this benchmark, six algorithms covering a variety of segmentation and
tracking paradigms have been compared and ranked based on their
performance on both synthetic and real datasets. Given the diversity
of the datasets, we do not declare a single winner of the challenge.
Instead, we present and discuss the results for each individual dataset
separately.

Availability and implementation: The challenge Web site (http://
www.codesolorzano.com/celltrackingchallenge) provides access to
the training and competition datasets, along with the ground truth of
the training videos. It also provides access to Windows and Linux
executable files of the evaluation software and most of the algorithms
that competed in the challenge.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cell migration is an essential process in normal tissue development,
tissue repair and disease (F riedl and Gilrnour, 2009). The dynamics
of cell movement (e. g. speed, directionality) and migration type
(i.e. the morphological changes that the cell undergoes during the
movement) are closely related to the biomechanical properties
of the surrounding environment (Friedl and Alexander, 2011).
Therefore, accurate quantiﬁcation of both is the key to understand-
ing the complex mechanobiology of cell migration.

Traditionally, cell migration experiments have been performed
in two dimensions (2D) using phase or differential interference
contrast microscopy. Nowadays, it is increasingly acknowledged
that proper evaluation of the cellular movement, as well as related
forces, requires looking at the cells in their three-dimensional (3D)
tissue environment (Legant et al., 2010). This can be done by
taking advantage of the versatility of ﬂuorescence labeling and
the optical sectioning capability of multidimensional ﬂuores-
cence in vivo microscopy (Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2006).
Fluorescence microscopy has several advantages (e. g. multidimen-
sionality, speciﬁcity). However, tracking ﬂuorescent cells poses
speciﬁc challenges compared with more traditional phase contrast
enhancing techniques: non-homogenous staining, low signal-to-
noise ratio, uneven background illumination, photobleaching,
phototoxicity, etc. Moreover, an important challenge, speciﬁc to
the use of green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) transfection—based

staining, is the cell-to-cell intensity variability caused by differen-
tial transfection efﬁciency. Therefore, tracking of ﬂuorescent cells
requires specialized tools.

Several methods have been described for the segmentation of
cells in static 3D ﬂuorescence microscopy images (Indhumathi
et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2005; Long et al., 2007; Ortiz-de-
Solorzano et al., 1999). These methods have been extended to
account for the temporal variable in multidimensional time-
lapse microscopy, combining accurate segmentation of the cells
with proper tracking of their movements and lineage events (e. g.
apoptosis, mitosis, cell merging and overlapping). They can be
classiﬁed into two broad categories: tracking by detection and
tracking by model evolution (Meijering et al., 2009; Rohr et al.,
2010; Zimmer et al., 2006). In the former paradigm, cells are ﬁrst
detected in all the frames of the Video independently using gradi-
ent features (Al-Kofahi et al., 2006), intensity (Li et al., 2010) or
wavelet decomposition (Padﬁeld et al., 2011). Subsequently, an
optimization strategy, such as multiple-hypothesis tracking
(Chenouard et al., 2013), integer programming (Li et al., 2010),
dynamic programming (Magnusson and J aldén, 2012) or coupled
minimum-cost ﬂow tracking (Padﬁeld et al., 2011), is used to de-
termine the most likely cell correspondence between frames. In the
latter paradigm, cells are segmented and tracked simultaneously,
using the ﬁnal result of each frame as the initial condition for the
analysis of the following frame. This is mostly done by evolving
the contours of the cells, represented either parametrically
(Dufour et al., 2011; Zimmer et al., 2002) or implicitly (Dufour
et al., 2005; Dzyubachyk et al., 2010; Li et al., 2008; Maska et al.,
2013), using a velocity term deﬁned by the content of the “target”
frame (e. g. gradient features or intra- and inter-region heterogen-
eity) and by the internal properties of the evolved contours (e. g.
mean curvature, shape or topology). The main beneﬁt of the ﬁrst
paradigm is the mutual independence of detection and association
steps, which allows straightforward tracking of new cells entering
the ﬁeld of View as well as forward-backward spatiotemporal data
association (Bise et al., 2011). On the contrary, the tracking by
model evolution approaches is popular for easy accommodation
of morphological and behavioral clues into the model to inher-
ently deal with the topologically ﬂexible behavior of live cells.
Bridging both paradigms together to take advantage of their bene-
ﬁts, Li et al. (2008) proposed a complex cell tracking system that
combines a fast level set framework with a local spatiotemporal
data association step.

The tracking methods described until this date have been
tested in one or few private datasets using different metrics and
have seldom been compared against other algorithms. A note-
worthy attempt toward a formalization of the evaluation of cell
tracking algorithms was described by Kan et al. (2011). They
compared a novel cell tracking strategy to a publicly available
probabilistic tracker using a customized tracking measurement
and mostly publicly available data. Similarly, Rapoport et al.
(2011) partly addressed this issue by providing a method for
the validation of the accuracy of cell tracking results and a data-
set composed of two manually annotated brightﬁeld microscopy
Videos. Finally, two recent studies (Dima et al., 2011; Held et al.,
2011) presented two rigorous comparisons of algorithms de-
veloped for the segmentation of ﬂuorescently labeled cells from
static 2D images, using their own image repositories and adapted
accuracy measures.

The limitations of these studies, such as being monomodality,
using 2D or static images, one or two cell types only, or compar-
ing with none or few competing algorithms, highlight the need
for common standards to evaluate new and existing algorithms.
Bearing this in mind, we organized the ﬁrst Cell Tracking
Challenge (http://www.codesolorzano.com/celltrackingchallenge)
hosted by the 2013 IEEE International Symposium on
Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2013, http://www.biomedicalima-
ging.org/2013/). In this article, we present the methods used
in the challenge, brieﬂy describe the competing algorithms
and report on the results of the comparison, which was based
on common accuracy measures and datasets covering a wide
variety of scenarios of live cell imaging in ﬂuorescence
microscopy.

2 METHODS
2.1 Logistics

The challenge was organized by members of three research institutions:
Center for Biomedical Image Analysis, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech
Republic (CBIA-CZ); Center for Applied Medical Research, University
of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain (CIMA-ES); and Erasmus University
Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands GERASMUS-NL). The
challenge, announced Via various media including targeted emails,
mailing lists and the ISBI 2013 Web site, was opened for registration
through the challenge Web site. Four weeks after opening the challenge
for registration, all registered participants were given individual access to
the challenge FTP server, where they could download the training data-
sets, along with the ground truth, and self-evaluation software. The regis-
tered participants worked on the training datasets during the 4 weeks
before the competition datasets were released. The participants were
then given six additional weeks to submit their results and the algorithms
used to produce them. After the deadline, the consistency and the com-
pliance of the submissions were veriﬁed by the organizers before the
presentation of the preliminary results at ISBI 2013. After the ISBI
2013 workshop, the organizing committee conﬁrmed the accuracy of
the submitted results and compiled the ﬁnal rankings presented in this
article.

2.2 Datasets

Forty-eight time-lapse sequences used in the challenge were evenly dis-
tributed between the training and competition phases. Each group of
24 Videos consisted of 12 real microscopy time-lapse sequences and 12
computer-simulated Videos, 6 2D and 6 3D, with various cell densities
and noise levels. The acquisition setup for each dataset is listed in Table 1,
and representative regions of each dataset are displayed in Figure 1.
Representative sample Videos can also be found as Supplementary
Videos S1—S8. The complete raw data are available at the challenge
Web site. The datasets were named using the following convention: a
four-letter preﬁx (LNDR) identiﬁes the labeling (L) method -cytoplasmic
(C) or nuclear Q1); the dimensionality (ND) -2D or 3D; and the reso-
lution (R) -low (L) or high (H). The sufﬁx, separated by a hyphen from
the preﬁx, describes the cell line.

2.2.] Real videos The real Video repository consists of six datasets.

rat mesenchymal stems cells on a ﬂat polyacrylamide substrate, acquired
using a Perkin Elmer UltraVIEW ERS spinning disk confocal microscope
(courtesy of Dr F. Prosper, CllVIA-ES). The difﬁculty of the dataset is
high because of the low signal-to-noise ratio and the presence of ﬁlament-
like protruding areas caused by cell stretching, which sometimes appear

lysis of the scenes, these protrusions often come in contact with other
cells.

C3DH-H157 (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Video S2). GFP transfected
H157 human squamous lung carcinoma cells embedded in a 3D matrigel
matrix, acquired using a Perkin Elmer UltraVIEW ERS spinning
disk confocal microscope (courtesy of Dr A. Rouzaut, CllVIA-ES).
The difﬁculty of the dataset is low because of low cell density and high
resolution. However, the presence of cell blebbing and cells entering and
leaving the ﬁeld of View impose a certain degree of complexity for seg-
mentation and tracking.

C3DL-MDA231 (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Video S3). MDA231
human breast carcinoma cells infected with a pure Murine Stem Cell
Virus (pMSCV) vector including GFP. The cells were embedded in a
3D collagen matrix and acquired using an Olympus Flroiew F1000
laser scanning confocal microscope (courtesy of Prof R. Kamm,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA). The dif-
ﬁculty of the dataset is high because it was acquired under high-through-
put conditions (i.e. low signal-to-noise ratio, low resolution, especially in

the axial direction, and large time step). Moreover, there are a high
number of colliding elongated cells as well as cells entering and leaving
the ﬁeld of View.

N2DH-GOWT1 (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Video S4). GFP trans-
fected GOWTl mouse embryonic stem cells on a ﬂat substrate, acquired
using a Leica TCS SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope (courtesy of
Dr E. Bartova, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech
Republic). The difﬁculty of the dataset is considered medium because of
heterogeneous staining, prominent nucleoli, mitoses, cells entering and
leaving the ﬁeld of View and frequent cell collisions.

N2DL-HeLa (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Video S5). Histone 2B
(H2B)-GFP expressing HeLa cells on a ﬂat substrate, acquired using
an Olympus IX81 inverted epiﬂuorescence microscope. The Videos were
obtained with permission from the Mitocheck consortium Video reposi-
tory (http://www.mitocheck.org). The difﬁculty of the dataset is classiﬁed
as high because of the high cell density and low resolution. In particular,
the Videos display frequent mitoses, both normal and abnormal, in add-
ition to the presence of colliding, entering and leaving cells with low
ﬂuorescence intensity.

N3DH-CHO (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Video S6). Chinese hamster
ovarian cells overexpressing proliferating cell nuclear antigen tagged with
GFP, acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope
(courtesy of Dr J. Essers, ERASMUS—NL). The dataset is considered of
medium difﬁculty because of nuclei with heterogeneous staining, the pres-
ence of prominent nucleoli, mitotic cells with unstained nuclear periods,
colliding cells and cells entering and leaving the ﬁeld of View.

2.2.2 Simulated videos The synthetic image data, along with the in-
herent ground truth, were generated using a simulation toolkit based on
our previous work in CBIA-CZ (Svoboda and Ulman, 2012; Svoboda
et al., 2009). As this challenge was dedicated to cell tracking, special
attention was paid to the accuracy of cell movement during the cell
cycle and to the mitotic events. The simulated Videos displayed ﬂuores-
cently labeled nuclei of the HL60 cell line migrating on a ﬂat 2D surface
OVZDH-SIIVI) and in a 3D matrix (N3DH-SIIVI) (Fig. 1G and
Supplementary Videos S7 and S8). They differ in the level of noise, cell
density of the initial population, the number of cells leaving and entering
the ﬁeld of View and the number of simulated mitotic events, yielding up
to 70 cells in the ﬁeld of View. Therefore, both datasets are considered of
medium difﬁculty.

2.3 Ground truth generation for real datasets

One expert from CIMA-ES annotated all the real datasets used in the
training phase. For the competition phase, all real Videos were manually
annotated by three experts from three sites (CBIA-CZ, CllVIA-ES and
ERASMUS—NL). Each expert created ground truth for tracking (TRA-
GT) and ground truth for segmentation (SEG-GT) for each Video. Each
pair of SEG-GT and TRA-GT was manually revised by its creator to
correct for automatically detected inconsistencies of two types: a segmen-
tation mask either overlapping with multiple tracking markers or without
any complete tracking marker. Finally, to account for inter-subject vari-
ability, two ﬁnal ground truths (SEG-GT-F and TRA-GT-F) were created
by combining the three existing ground truths, using a majority-voting
scheme, as suggested, for instance, by Foggia et al. (2013). The way the
majority voting was performed is described in detail in the Supplementary
Note.

2.3.] Field of interest To simplify dealing with incomplete objects,
entering or leaving the image frame, only objects that had substantially
advanced into the image frame were analyzed. This is equivalent to deﬁn-
ing a Virtual inner ﬁeld of interest G‘ol) and analyzing only those objects
that are at least partially inside the F01. The distance in grid points (pixels
or voxels) between the image frame border and the F01 border varied
between datasets depending on the size of the objects of interest (50 grid
points in C2DL-MSC, C3DH-H157, N2DH-GOWT1 and N3DH-CHO;
25 grid points in C3DL-MDA231 and N2DL-HeLa).

2.3.2 Ground truth for segmentation The task for annotators was to
mark grid points belonging to cells as accurately as possible. Therefore,
each cell was segmented as a set of grid points with the same unique label.
The length of the Videos and the high number of cells per frame in some
of the datasets prevented from having a complete manual annotation of
all the cells. Therefore, we ﬁrst randomly permutated all the frames of
each Video to unbiasedly select the cells that were used as ground truth. In
the 3D Videos, we also randomly selected at least one of its 2D z-slices,
excluding empty slices. Then, the annotators were asked to segment all
the cells within each frame in the given random order until at least 100
cells were segmented and two frames were fully segmented. The segmen-
tation masks were drawn in the entire image frame and not just in the
F01. Cells Visible only outside the F01 were not segmented at all. After
reaching the limit of 100 cells and two full frames, the annotators in-
spected the remaining frames in the random order provided, and they
were asked to identify and annotate cells that in their opinion were prone

to causing segmentation problems, such as cells undergoing abnormal
mitoses, dimly stained cells, oddly shaped cells and colliding pairs of
cells. They segmented at least 20 instances of each problematic event.

2.3.3 Ground truth for tracking The task for the annotators was to
draw a quintessential “marker” (i.e. a set of grid points with the same
unique label) inside each cell and in every frame where the cell consecu-
tively appears entirely or partly within the limits of the F01. These mar-
kers do not need to accurately follow the boundaries of the cells. Markers
of a given label located in consecutive frames are called “tracks”. Tracks
end when a cell entirely leaves the F01, the Video reaches the ﬁnal frame or
the cell divides into two, or abnormally more than two, daughter cells.
When this happens, new tracks are created, one for each daughter cell,
and the parental connection is stored in the TRA-GT ﬁle.

2.4 Evaluation

2.4.1 Segmentation measure The main purpose of the segmentation
(SEG) accuracy measurement is to understand how well the segmented
cells match the actual cell regions. To quantify it, we used the Jaccard
similarity index, deﬁned as:

_|RﬂS|

R _
J( ’S) IRUSI

 

where R is a reference segmentation of a cell in SEG-GT-F and S is an
automatic segmentation of the particular cell provided by a participant.
A reference cell, R, and a segmented one, S, are considered matching if
the following condition holds:

|R (1 SI >0.5 - |R|

Note, for each reference cell, there can be one segmented object at
most. If there is no signiﬁcant overlap with any segmented object, the
matching function is set to empty. The Jaccard index always falls in
the [0, 1] interval, where 1 means perfect match and 0 means no match.
The ﬁnal SEG measure for a particular Video is calculated as the mean
of the J accard indices of all the reference objects in the Video.

2.4.2 Tracking measure The goal of the tracking (F RA) measure-
ment is to evaluate the ability of the tracking algorithms to detect the
cells and follow them in time. Although TRA does not evaluate the
segmentation accuracy, reliable cell detection is the key to this measure-
ment. To the best of our knowledge, there is no standardized, commonly
used cell tracking accuracy measure currently available. Two popular
approaches for measuring the performance of tracking algorithms are
based on either the ratio of completely reconstructed tracks to the total
number of ground-truth tracks (Li et al., 2008) or the ratio of correct
temporal relations within reconstructed tracks to the total number of
temporal relations within ground-truth tracks (Kan et al., 2011).
Obviously, both approaches quantify, at different scales, how well the
cell tracking algorithms are able to reconstruct a particular ground-truth
reference. However, they neither penalize for spurious tracks nor account
for division events, which are often evaluated separately (Kan et al., 2011;
Li et al., 2008). Therefore, we developed a novel cell tracking accuracy
measure that penalizes for all possible errors in tracking results and com-
bines them with different weights, reﬂecting the manual effort needed to
correct a particular error, into a single number.

Cell tracking results can be represented using an acyclic oriented
graph. The nodes of such a graph correspond to the detected cells,
whereas its edges coincide with temporal relations between them. They
are of two kinds: track links (the cell continues with the same label in the
consecutive frames) and parent links (the cell continues with a different
label not necessarily in the consecutive frames). Non-dividing cells have
one successor at most, whereas those that undergo division have two or
even more successors in the case of abnormal division. The TRA

Benchmarking of cell tracking algorithms

 

measurement computes the difference between the acyclic oriented graph
provided by a participant algorithm and the reference TRA-GT-F. To this
end, we automatically quantify how difﬁcult it is to transform the com-
puted graph into the reference one as the least number of operations
needed to make the graphs identical. The operations allowed (split/
delete/add a node; delete/add or change the semantics of an edge) are
penalized differently based on the effort that would be required if manu-
ally performed. The correspondence between operations and weights (w)
is as follows: delete a node (w = 1, requires one mouse click); split a node
(w = 5, requires drawing a divider); add a node (w = 10, requires adding a
whole mask); delete an edge (w = 1, requires one mouse click); change an
edge semantics (w = 1, requires one mouse click); add an edge (w = 1.5, it
is slightly more difﬁcult than deleting an edge, as it requires to determine
both nodes of the edge). The TRA measure is deﬁned as the weighted sum
of graph operations, normalized by the number of markers (i.e. by the
number of nodes in the reference graph) to facilitate the comparison
between Videos (datasets) with different numbers of cells. The best
result, which requires no changes, has a TRA measure equal to zero.

To establish the optimal transformation of a participant graph into the
reference graph, we have implemented the following automatic proced-
ure. First, correspondences between the nodes of both graphs are deter-
mined using the same criterion that is used for ﬁnding matching
segmentation masks. Then, the nodes are classiﬁed into four categories:
false negatives (ground-truth nodes without any match to the participant
nodes), false positives (participant nodes without any match to the
ground-truth nodes), true positives (ground-truth nodes that match to
some participant nodes) and non-split nodes (participant nodes that
match to multiple ground-truth nodes). Knowing the category of each
node, the procedure directly computes how many edges need to be
removed from the participant graph. They are either connected to at
least one false-positive node or they connect two correctly detected
nodes, which are not linked in the ground-truth graph. Analogously, it
counts the number of missing edges in the participant graph. These are
the ground-truth edges without counterpart in the participant graph.
Finally, the number of edges between matching nodes, which differ in
semantics, is counted. The optimal transformation making the participant
graph identical to the reference graph ﬁrst involves separating all non-
split nodes, adding false-negative nodes and removing all false-positive
nodes. Having the sets of nodes of both graphs uniﬁed, redundant edges
are removed, missing edges added and ﬁnally those with wrong semantics
corrected. The whole procedure is fully automatic, requires no optimiza-
tion and is easy to implement.

2.4.3 Time consumption Time consumption (F 1M) was evaluated on
a common workstation (Intel Core i7-3770 3.40 GHz, 24 GB RAM) run-
ning the 64-bit Windows 7 or the Ubuntu 13.10 operating system. The
total execution time needed to analyze each Video of a given dataset was
measured. The memory consumption was not considered for the perform-
ance evaluation, but the participants were asked to ensure that their
algorithms would not require more than the given physical memory
limit on that PC conﬁguration.

2.4.4 Evaluation tools Two command-line executable programs, one
for segmentation and one for the tracking accuracy evaluation, were
provided along with the training datasets to help the participants with
the self-evaluation and reﬁnement of their algorithms. These programs
were also used by the organizers to evaluate SEC and TRA for the results
submitted by the participating teams for the competition datasets. Both
programs were written in C++ and are publicly available at the challenge
Web site.

2.4.5 Compilation of rankings First, for each method, the SEG,
TRA and TIM measures were averaged over all the Videos of a given
dataset. For each dataset, all the methods were ranked (1 =best) and,

subsequently, a ﬁnal ranking was compiled based on the following
formula:

1
Final rank 2 rankSEG + rankTRA +  rankTIM

where N is the number of ranked methods for a particular dataset. The
reason for using different weights for accuracy (SEG and TRA) and speed
(UNI) is to prefer more accurate, but possibly slower, methods to faster,
but less accurate, ones.

The best performing method is that with the lowest Final rank for a
particular dataset. Note that the methods having partial or empty sub-
mitted results for a particular dataset were not ranked for that dataset.

3.3 Discussion

In the next paragraphs, we will discuss the main contributions of
the challenge.

Datasets. We have created a public data repository composed
of 24 annotated time-lapse sequences obtained from conven-
tional and confocal ﬂuorescence microscopes, along with 24 real-
istic computer simulations of moving nuclei. The cell types
selected are relevant in the context of cell migration, being cells
with stem-like properties involved in embryonic and adult organ
development and homeostasis, or cancer cell lines with metastatic
properties. These Videos cover a wide variety of cell types,
microscopy and experimental setups, cell density and motility,
resolution, image quality and dimensionality. There are 2D
sequences of nuclearly stained cells, commonly used in cell popu-
lation studies (e. g. N2DL-HeLa), and 3D sequences of cytoplas-
mically stained cells, more appropriate for single-cell studies that
demand a realistic rendering of the cellular environment (e. g.
C3DL-MDA231). The characteristics of the Videos in terms of
contrast, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio are also diverse,
covering conditions ranging from those that could be considered

and bright ﬂuorescent staining) to conditions that could be clas-
siﬁed as “high-throughput” (i.e. low magniﬁcation, low numer-
ical aperture lens, heterogeneous and dim ﬂuorescent staining).
All real Videos used in the competition were manually annotated
at three different sites, and a ﬁnal ground truth per Video was
generated using a majority voting approach, to account for inter-
subject variability. The two additional simulated datasets provide
an absolute ground truth for the comparison of the algorithms,
eliminating the possible bias introduced by the annotators of the
real Videos.

Measures and rankings. Key to the establishment of a credible
benchmark is the use of common measures for algorithm evalu-
ation and comparison. We have described and used measures
that account for two aspects of the cell tracking problem: seg-
mentation and tracking accuracy. The segmentation accuracy
measure was based on the J accard similarity index, which evalu-
ates how close the cell segmentations are to the ground truth.
Tracking accuracy was evaluated using a novel measure, based
on matching acyclic oriented graphs. This method automatically
assesses the difﬁculty of transforming a computed graph into the
ground-truth reference. The difﬁculty is measured as the
weighted sum of the least number of operations needed to
make the graphs identical. Therefore, the tracking accuracy
was measured by one comprehensive scalar measure, whereas
in most previous works it required evaluating multiple measures
to characterize various cell tracking events (Kan et al., 2011; Li
et al., 2008). The weights are not biologically motivated; there-
fore, the measure is application—independent. The highest weight

is put on missing nodes in the weighted sum; therefore, the ability
of the method to detect all the cells is important for achiean
low score. Because both parameters (i.e. segmentation and track-
ing accuracy) are of similar importance, they were weighted
equally in the ﬁnal ranking function. Only when the algorithms
achieved the same rank in terms of accuracy, the faster one was
preferred, which was guaranteed by adding time performance
with a smaller adaptive weight.

Results: Participants and algorithms. Six algorithms were sub-
mitted to the ﬁrst Cell Tracking Challenge, covering a wide var-
iety of methods, stemming from the two main tracking
paradigms: tracking by detection and tracking by model evolution.
Most of the existing state-of—the—art methods for ﬁltering, en-
hancement, segmentation, particle analysis and track association
are represented. Four of the six participating groups (COM-US,
HEID-GE, KTH-SE and PRAG-CZ) provided results for all the
datasets. This is a remarkable fact that emphasizes the general-
ization of the results.

Results: Global analysis. Based on the numbers provided in
Supplementary Table S1, both SEC and TRA accuracy measures
were higher for nuclear labeling than for cytoplasmic labeling.
Furthermore, they both reﬂected the level of complexity pro-
vided in Table 1, along with the description of the datasets.

There were large differences in the segmentation accuracy, the
lowest mean values being for C2DL-MSC and C3DL-MDA231
(both with cytoplasmic labeling), the highest mean value being
for N3DH-CHO. This could be explained by the fact that the
algorithms seem to be developed and tuned for the segmentation
of nuclei, as they often incorporate cluster separation routines

based on the circularity of segmented objects. Therefore, they are
not appropriate for cellular shapes, which are seldom uniform,
present protrusions and frequently establish contacts or overlaps.

The TRA measure generally provided more uniform re-
sults among datasets, with the exception of C2DL-MSC.
Interestingly, the algorithms achieved signiﬁcantly higher track-
ing accuracy on the simulated datasets than on the real ones.
This is likely because of the fact that the computer-simulated
nuclei are in general uniformly sized, and the simulated cell mo-
tility does not cover all possible random events that occur in real
live-cell experiments.

Finally, the TIM measure strongly depended on the size of
each Video, being the lowest for C2DL-MSC and N2DH-SIM
and the highest for N3DH-SIM and C3DH-H157. Another
important factor inﬂuencing time consumption of the competing
algorithms was the number of objects to be analyzed. Note that
the standard deviations of the TIM measure indicate signiﬁcant
differences in the speed of competing algorithms for all the
datasets.

Results: Rankings. The FINAL ranking in Table 3 shows that
KTH-SE performed best in four real datasets (C2DL-MSC,
C3DL-MDA231, N2DH-GOWT1 and N2DL-HeLa). HEID-
GE and PRAG-CZ performed best in one real dataset (N3DH-
CH0 and C3DH-H157, respectively). LEID-NL performed best
in the two simulated datasets (N2DH-SIM and N3DH-SIM).
When we look at the number of appearances of each method
among the top three best performing methods, both KTH-SE
and HEID-GE appeared in all eight datasets, LElD-NL and
PRAG-CZ appeared in three datasets and ﬁnally UPM-ES
and COM-US appeared in one dataset.

It is also important to note that in the case of C3DH-H157,
N2DH-GOWT1, N2DL-HeLa and N3DH-SIM, the decisive
factor for establishing the ﬁnal ranking was the speed of compet-
ing algorithms because multiple methods were evenly ranked
based on the SEG and TRA accuracy measures only.

Looking at each accuracy measure separately, HEID-GE and
KTH-SE ranked among the top three most accurate methods for

all the datasets, with the exception of the segmentation accuracy
for N3DH-CHO, where KTH-SE ranked fourth. However, one
should note that in this speciﬁc case, the difference in SEG be-
tween the most accurate method, HElD-GE, and KTH-SE was
small. The other two methods that often belonged to the top
three most accurate methods were PRAG-CZ and LEID-NL.
In terms of TIIVI measure, COM-US, PRAG—CZ and KTH-SE
were consistently the top three fastest methods for all the data-
sets. It is remarkable that KTH-SE was, at worst, second fastest
among the top three best performers in terms of SEG and TRA.

Results per dataset: We will now look at the results of each
particular dataset in detail, trying to extract relevant conclusions
about the best performing methods (see Table 3 and
Supplementary Table S1):

C2DL-MSC (Supplementary Video S9). The accuracy meas-
ures were generally poor, especially because of problems with the
segmentation of elongated protrusions, often incorrectly con-
sidered as whole cells. KTH-SE achieved signiﬁcantly better
accuracy than the other methods because of the optimized
track-linking algorithm used, and an adaptive post-processing
step, which merges segmented object portions into adjacent seg-
ments with tracks. Regardless of this additional post-processing
step, the method was still fast, being the second fastest in terms
of TIM and >2X faster than the other two top three best per-
forming methods, HElD-GE and UPM-ES.

C3DH-H157 (Supplementary Video S10). All the algorithms
that competed for this dataset achieved comparable segmenta-
tion accuracy, HEID-GE being the most accurate. Compared
with the segmentation accuracy, the tracking accuracy was
more spread out, PRAG-CZ being the most accurate. The de-
cisive factor for establishing the ﬁnal ranking of the top three
best performing methods was TIM. Globally, PRAG-CZ was
ranked ﬁrst, having the lowest time consumption, namely,
because the preprocessing step, involving Gaussian ﬁltering, is
applied only in 2D, slice-by-slice.

C3DL-MDA231 (Supplementary Video S11). The calculated
accuracy measures were generally poor, because of the

high-throughput acquisition conditions, making it difﬁcult to
properly separate tightly packed clusters as well as accurately
segment elongated protrusions. Analogously to C2DL-MSC,
KTH-SE signiﬁcantly outperformed the other methods in
terms of accuracy. This is due to the additional arcs included
in the state space diagram, which allow the delayed creation of
correct tracks originally blocked by incorrect preexisting tracks
(Magnusson and J aldén, 2012). Moreover, this is also a beneﬁt of
the track-free object merging used as an adaptive post-processing
step.

N2DH-GOWT1 (Supplementary Video S12). Both accuracy
measures were high, especially SEG. A decisive factor for achiev-
ing these good results was the use of a cluster separation routine
(e.g. watershed or the Radon transform), and a hole-ﬁlling ap-
proach to remove small background components within seg-
mented cells at places of prominent nucleoli. The top two best
performing methods, KTH-SE and PRAG-CZ, performed simi-
larly. Based on the SEG and TRA measures, they were assigned
the same rank of 3, with PRAG-CZ the best in segmenting and
KTH-SE the best in tracking. Globally, KTH-SE was ranked
ﬁrst because it was ~5X faster than PRAG—CZ.

N2DL-HeLa (Supplementary Video S13). The accuracy meas-
ures were high, especially TRA. Analogously to N2DH-GOWT1,
the use of a cluster separation routine resulted in more accurate
results, although such routine sometimes led to over-segmenta-
tion, especially when multiple touching nuclei formed clusters of
highly irregular shape. The top two best performing methods,
KTH-SE and HEID-GE, produced results of comparable accur-
acy. Based on the SEG and TRA measures, they were assigned
the same rank of 3, KTH-SE being the best in segmenting and
HEID-GE being the best in tracking, mainly because of the spe-
ciﬁc mitosis detection phase implemented in their method.
Globally, KTH-SE was ranked ﬁrst as it was >2X faster than
HEID-GE.

N3DH-CHO (Supplementary Video S14). The accuracy meas-
ures were the best among all the real datasets. This can be ex-
plained by the high magniﬁcation objective lens used and low cell
density. Furthermore, these Videos contain little of noise.
Analogously to N2DH-GOWT1, a crucial factor for achieving
more accurate results was to involve a hole-ﬁlling approach to
deal with nucleoli. Globally, HEID-GE was ranked ﬁrst, thanks
to its ability to deal with the presence of cell invaginations and a
morphology-based likelihood measure used to identify candi-
dates for mitotic events.

N2DH-SIM and N3DH-SIM (Supplementary Videos S15 and
S16). The obtained SEG measures were similar to those for the
real datasets displaying stained nuclei. This indicates that our
simulator generates images of realistic static content in terms
of cell texture, noise level and image degradations. However, in
terms of tracking accuracy, as mentioned before, the algorithms
performed generally better than in the real datasets. Globally,
LEID-NL was ranked ﬁrst for both simulated datasets, ﬁtting
with the idea that the model behind this method highly conforms
to computer-simulated nuclei of controlled cell motility.
However, it needs further optimization to properly work in
real scenarios. From the analysis of the submitted results, we
can ﬁnally stress the importance of the mitosis detection phase
implemented by HElD-GE, and the linking and adaptive track

post-processing phases implemented by KTH-SE, especially in
low signal-to-noise ratio conditions.

4 CONCLUSION

In this article, we have presented the implementation of a bench-
mark for objective comparison of cell tracking algorithms, based
on the use of a common diverse Video dataset repository and
ground truth, speciﬁc measures for both the evaluation of the
segmentation and tracking accuracy, and uniﬁed criteria for
comparing and ranking the algorithms. This is something re-
cently highlighted by Carpenter et al. (2012) as a requirement
for the usability of biomedical imaging software. The logistics,
datasets, methods and results of the challenge have been
described herein. In the future, we expect this benchmark to
serve as a reference for the development and evaluation of
novel cell tracking algorithms. To this end, the training and
competition datasets are available to the general public, along
with the ground truth for the training datasets and the self-evalu-
ation software. Moreover, executable versions of most of the
competing algorithms will be available through the challenge
Web site. We expect the challenge to remain open for online
submissions, because there are open problems that need to be
addressed and new algorithms that can be developed to improve
the existing ones. Namely, accurately segmenting and tracking
cytoplasmically labeled cells is still something far from being
solved. Automated segmentation and tracking of other cell
types, other modalities (e. g. brightﬁeld time-lapse microscopy)
and existing or new high-throughput modalities, such as selected
plane illumination microscopy, may require further algorithmic
developments, and therefore proper testing and validation that
could be achieved through this benchmark.

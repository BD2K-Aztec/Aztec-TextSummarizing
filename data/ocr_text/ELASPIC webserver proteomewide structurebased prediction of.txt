Abstract

Summary: ELASPIC is a novel ensemble machine—learning approach that predicts the effects of
mutations on protein folding and protein—protein interactions. Here, we present the ELASPIC web—
server, which makes the ELASPIC pipeline available through a fast and intuitive interface. The web—
server can be used to evaluate the effect of mutations on any protein in the Uniprot database, and
allows all predicted results, including modeled wild—type and mutated structures, to be managed
and viewed online and downloaded if needed. It is backed by a database which contains improved
structural domain definitions, and a list of curated domain—domain interactions for all known pro—
teins, as well as homology models of domains and domain—domain interactions for the human
proteome. Homology models for proteins of other organisms are calculated on the fly, and muta—
tions are evaluated within minutes once the homology model is available.

Availability and implementation: The ELASPIC webserver is available online at http://elaspic.kim
lab.org.

1 Introduction

 

Sequence variation in the human genome is a crucial aspect in bio—
medical research. Many variants can directly cause Mendelian dis—
eases and can confer susceptibility or protection to more
multifactorial diseases, such as cancer (Risch and Merikangas,
1996). To unravel the mechanism behind those phenotypic effects
we first need to understand the biochemical impact of mutations. A
number of computational tools have been developed to predict the
effect of mutations on protein stability or binding (Dehouck et al.,
2011, 2013; Tian et al., 2010). However, those tools require a
resolved crystal structure of the protein, precluding their application
on a proteome—wide scale. There are webservers which use structural

information to predict the effect of mutations (De Baets et al., 2012;
Venselaar et al., 2010), and which map mutations to proteins in a
3D protein interaction network (Mosca et al., 2015). However,
none of those resources predict the effect of mutations on protein—
protein interaction affinity. Here, we present a webserver that can
be used to predict the effect of mutations on protein stability and
protein interaction affinity, for any protein for which a homology
model can be constructed. The webserver is based on the ELASPIC
pipeline (Berliner et al., 2014), but drastically simplifies the experi—
ence for the end user. It includes improved domain definitions for all
proteins in the UniProt database, homology models of domains and
domain—domain interactions for all human proteins, and mutation

impact results for all human mutations implicated in hereditary dis-
eases and cancers. New mutations are evaluated within minutes if
homology models are available, and under an hour if those models
are to be generated. The webserver offers a streamlined and intuitive
interface for analyzing the results, and makes all predictions and
structures available for download.

2 Methods

2.1 Domain boundary definition

In order to generate structural models, structurally sound domain
boundary definitions are needed. For this, we generated the Profs
pipeline that unifies domain definitions obtained from CATH and
Pfam. Profs domain boundaries are optimized to be both structurally
and evolutionarily consistent. Unlike Gene3D (Lees et al., 2012),
which uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) that are based on
CATH, Profs uses HMMs that are based on Pfam. Therefore, all
functional annotations that have been assigned to Pfam domains can
easily be transferred to Profs domains. For more information, see
the Supplementary material.

2.2 ELASPIC pipeline

ELASPIC constructs homology models of domains and domain—do-
main interactions, and it uses those models, together with sequential
and other features, to predict the energetic impact of a mutation on
the stability of a single domain or the affinity between two domains.
A more detailed description of the ELASPIC method, including
cross-validation and comparison with existing approaches, can be
found in the Supplementary material and the original publication.

2.3 Webserver implementation
The ELASPIC webserver was implemented using the Django
framework. Its database contains over 800 million protein

cross-references, imported from Uniprot, allowing it to recognize
protein input in different formats.

2.4 Overview

Unlike previous methods, ELASPIC takes advantage of homology
modeling to create protein structures. Therefore, the webserver only
requires a protein or gene identifier and a point mutation. An alter-
native batch input page is available, which takes a list of point muta-
tions with the standard form <protein>.<mutation> either by
direct input or as a file upload. The users can still submit their own
PDB structure if required.

The main output of the webserver is the predicted change in the
Gibbs free energy (AAG) of folding and/or binding for every domain
and interface affected by the mutation. A specific domain or inter-
face can be selected to display more detailed information, including
a graphic showing the location of the domain in the protein, a Jmol
applet showing superimposed wild-type and mutant structures (e.g.
Fig. 1) and, for interface mutations, an interactive connectivity net-
work showing the affected interactions. The structures can be down-
loaded for further inspection or calculations.

2.5 Case study

We applied our approach to a list of somatic mutations found in
cancer and catalogued in the COSMIC database. EP300, a transcrip-
tional coactivator, is mutated with a high frequency in different can-
cer types. ELASPIC predicts those mutations to decrease the
stability of EP300 and decrease its affinity to downstream hypoxia-
regulators HIF1A and EPASl, and the SRC/p160 nuclear receptor
coactivator family proteins NCOA1, NCOA2 and NCOA3.
Interaction models created by the ELASPIC webserver show the
structural changes that lead to the loss in affinity (Fig. 1). The p160
family proteins are thought to promote EP300-mediated HIF1A and
EPASl activation (Carrero et al., 2000). ELASPIC predicts that the

increase in cancer susceptibility caused by mutations in EP3 00 is due
to those interactions being hindered. Indeed, it has been shown that
disrupting the interaction between EP300 and HIF1A inhibits apop-
tosis and promotes renal cancer cells survival (Khan et al., 2011). A
more in—depth analysis is available in the Supplementary material.

including various eQTL studies and a meta-analysis of HapMap eQTL
information. The database presents eQTL association results in a
convenient browser, using both segmented local-association plots
and genome-wide Manhattan plots.

Availability and implementation: seeQTL is freely available
for non-commercial use at http://www.bios.unc.edu/research

1 INTRODUCTION

The association of RNA expression traits with DNA variation,
including from single—nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy—
number variants (CNVs), has been a subject of active inquiry in
recent years, shedding light on fundamental biological processes
underlying transcription. Here we use the generic term ‘expression
quantitative trait loci’ (eQTLs) to describe these DNA variants and
their associated expression traits (Feuk et al., 2006). A large number
of studies have been published on HapMap lymphoblastoid cell
lines and other human tissues, covering several continental—level
populations (Choy et al., 2008; Dimas et al., 2009; Grundberg
et al., 2009; Montgomery et al., 2010; Myers et al., 2007; Pickrell
et al., 2010; Price et al., 2008; Schadt et al., 2008; Spielman et al.,
2007; Stranger et al., 2007; Zeller et al., 2010). In addition to the
general importance of dissecting transcriptional regulation, eQTL
analysis may also provide a window into the mechanisms underlying
transcription—mediated disease (Consoli et al., 2002).

Several online databases are available which report eQTL
associations based on published datasets. SCAN (Gamazon et al.,
2009) is a large—scale database of genetic and genomic data,
which allows users to search for eQTLs by querying multiple
genes or SNPs/CNVs, but is not designed primarily as an eQTL
database. The eQTL Browser (Pickrell et al., 2010) is based on
the Gbrowse platform (Donlin, 2009) and displays results from
multiple studies and allows navigation throughout the genome.
The GTEx (Genotype—Tissue Expression) eQTL database will be
populated by tissue—speciﬁc eQTL information as the GTEx project

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtex/test/GTEX2/) progresses, but is
currently limited in navigability. SNPexp (Holm et al., 2010)
provides the database for users to investigate a speciﬁed region,
but contains a limited number of eQTL datasets. Despite the current
attention to eQTL datasets, the need remains for a powerful and
versatile eQTL database to easily investigate regions, loci and
transcripts of interest.

Here we introduce seeQTL, a new database of human eQTL
associations. It is based on the Gbrowse2 platform, which is more
powerful and customizable than the original Gbrowse. Most of
the studies represented in seeQTL (Supplementary Material) were
re—analyzed using our own pipeline, combining quality control,
population stratiﬁcation control, association testing and false
discovery rate (FDR) control (Fig. 1) (Benjamini and Hochberg,
1995). In addition, we performed a meta—analysis to obtain a
consensus association score for each eQTL across the HapMap
studies and populations. Here we use the terms ‘cis eQTL’ for
local eQTLs (within 1Mb of a gene) and ‘trans eQTL’ for more
distant eQTLs. Cis associations are displayed using either segment
plots (Fig. 2) or FDR q—value association Manhattan plots and trans
associations using Manhattan plots.

1.1 Datasets and analysis

We collected 14 human eQTL datasets, including unrelated HapMap
lymphoblastoid cell lines (Choy et al., 2008; Dimas et al., 2009;
Montgomery et al., 2010; Pickrell et al., 2010; Price et al., 2008;
Spielman et al., 2007; Stranger et al., 2007), human cortical samples
(Myers et al., 2007) and monocytes (Zeller et al., 2010). The gene
expression data were downloaded from NCBI GEO, and genotype
data were downloaded from HapMap or the authors’ website
(Supplementary Material). We excluded a sample for low expression
quality and excluded SNPs with low minor allele frequency (MAF).
Detail of eQTL calculations and FDR control are provided in the
Supplementary Material and Figure 1. Summarized results of the
datasets are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Additional datasets
will be added as data are made available. We soon anticipate loading
results from the ‘godot’ study, an eQTL evaluation of peripheral
blood gene expression in ~800 monozygotic and 750 dizygotic twin
pairs.

1.2 Consensus method

The HapMap lymphoblastoid cell line data consist of multiple
expression datasets and cover several continental—level populations.
Separate analyses can be performed within each dataset. However,
as the data are all from the same tissue source, the availability

of a single consensus meta—analysis would greatly facilitate eQTL
analysis of HapMap samples. We applied a standard meta—analysis
approach to obtain a consensus score for each transcript and
each SNP with study—speciﬁc weights chosen to maximize power
(Supplementary Material).

1.3 Usage features

The seeQTL browser is navigable using text—searches for genes
and SNPs, presenting a table view of features containing these
text strings. Alternatively and subsequently, seeQTL is navigable
by clicking and zooming. These browser features allow maximum
ﬂexibility in focusing on speciﬁc genes and genomic regions. As
described above, cis—associations are displayed using segment plots,
which are useful to display the ‘connection’ between genes and
associated SNPs, as well as Manhattan plots. For the SNPs in
a region, all the genes to which these SNPs exhibit signiﬁcant
association can also be displayed in Manhattan plots. Tracks based
on individual datasets are shown separately, as well as the consensus
HapMap track. Comparisons of seeQTL features and advantages are
shown in Supplementary Table S2.

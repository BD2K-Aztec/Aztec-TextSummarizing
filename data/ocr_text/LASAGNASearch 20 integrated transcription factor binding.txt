ABSTRACT

Summary: LASAGNA-Search 2.0 is an integrated webtool for
transcription factor (T F) binding site search and visualization. The
tool is based on the LASAGNA (Length-Aware Site Alignment
Guided by Nucleotide Association) algorithm. It eliminates manual
TF model collection and promoter sequence retrieval. Search results
can be visualized locally or in the University of California Santa Cruz
Genome Browser. Gene regulatory network inference based on the
search results offers another way of visualization. A list of TFs and
target genes is all a user needs to start using the tool. LASAGNA-
Search 2.0 currently offers 1792 TF models and supports 15 species
for automatic promoter retrieval and visualization in the University of
California Santa Cruz Genome Browser. It is a user-friendly tool de-
signed for non-bioinformaticians and is suitable for research and
teaching. We describe important changes made since the initial
release.

Availability and implementation: LASAGNA-Search 2.0 is freely
available without registration at http://biogrid.engr.uconn.edu/
lasagna_search/.

1 INTRODUCTION

A transcription factor (TF) is a protein or protein complex that
regulates gene expression by physically binding to the regulatory
regions of its target genes. Because of the similarity shared
among binding sites of a TF, a model can be built from the
known TF binding sites (TFBSs) to search for novel binding
sites in unannotated DNA sequences. Various assays can be
used to identify binding sites of a TF. One of these is the high-
throughput ChIP-seq (Johnson et al., 2007) method, which com-
bines chromatin immunoprecipitation (Gilmour and Lis, 1984)
with massively parallel DNA sequencing. Brieﬂy, DNA bound
by the TF in question is sequenced, producing short DNA
sequences or reads. By aligning these reads to a reference
genome, we obtain the number of reads covering each genomic
location or the binding signals, which are used by a peak ﬁnding
algorithm to locate signal peaks in the genome. Projects such as
the ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project
(ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012) generated huge amounts
of ChIP-seq data for human and mouse TFs across different cell

types. This helps scientists better understand TF binding for the
studied species. ChIP-seq data, however, are not available for
lesser-studied TFs and species. As a result, TFBS search tools
are still routinely used by scientists (Del Campo et al., 2014;
Martin, 2013) and databases curating TFBSs and TF models
(Kilig: et al., 2014; Mathelier et al., 2013) are released or updated.

LASAGNA-Search 2.0 is an integrated webtool that allows
users to perform TF BS search and Visualization without leaving
the website. It offers collections of 1792 TF models built from
either TFBSs or position-speciﬁc weight matrices (PWMs),
where the TFBSs and PWMs were collected from
TRANSFAC (Matys et al., 2006), JASPAR (Mathelier et al.,
2013), UniPROBE (Newburger and Bulyk, 2009), ORegAnno
(Grifﬁth et al., 2008) and PAZAR (Portales-Casamar et al.,
2009). To use custom TF models, the tool accepts unaligned
variable-length binding sites of a TF as well as TF models in
the form of PWMs. In case TFBSs are provided, the LASAGNA
algorithm (Lee and Huang, 2013a) is used to align variable-
length TFBSs before building a TF model. While users can pro-
vide DNA sequences in the FASTA format to be scanned for
putative binding sites, LASAGNA-Search supports automatic
promoter sequence retrieval for 15 species. Users can use ofﬁcial
gene symbols, RefSeq mRNA accession numbers or NCBI
Gene IDs to search for genes and retrieve promoter sequences
relative to the transcription start sites. Promoter sequences
retrieved Via LASAGNA-Search come with genomic locations,
which allow the search results to be Visualized with other anno-
tations with ease. Users can either Visualize hits locally or in the
University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser
with a mouse click. Finally, signiﬁcant binding sites of TF A
found in the promoter of gene B suggest interaction between
TF A and gene B. Enabled by our tool, search results can
hence be Visualized as a network of TFs, TF coding genes and
target genes.

Since the initial release of LASAGNA-Search (Lee and
Huang, 2013b), we received constructive and encouraging feed-
back from the users, which resulted in LASAGNA-Search 2.0. In
this note, we describe the improvements, discuss the implications
and outline future work.

2 NEW FEATURES

2.1 New TF models based on TFBSs in the PAZAR
database

The PAZAR database (Portales-Casamar et al., 2009) offers a
platform for users to start curation projects. A record stores one

annotation for one sequence from either a TF—gene interaction
or gene expression experiment. Hence, binding sites of a TF can
be extracted from TF—gene interaction records in the PAZAR
projects. As more than one project may curate binding sites of a
particular TF, we aggregated records containing TF—gene inter-
action information from all the public projects. All the ﬁles in the
general feature format dated 20120117 were downloaded. We
group TFBSs by TF and species, that is, human TF A and
mouse TF A are considered two TFs.

A binding site was ﬁltered out if it is <4 or >1000 bases long.
To verify a binding site, we searched for it in the Vicinity of the
curated genomic location in the reference genome. The binding
site was discarded if it could not be located within ﬁve bases of
the curated location. As we collected binding sites for a TF
across all the public projects in PAZAR, a TF BS may be curated
by more than one project, resulting in multiple copies of the
TFBS in our collection. Therefore, for each pair of overlapping
binding sites, we kept only the shorter one if the overlap is >80%
of the shorter one in length. A model was built for a TF if it has
at least 10 binding sites.

The LASAGNA-ChIP algorithm (Lee and Huang, 2013a) was
used to align the binding sites of a TF because some of the pro-
jects contain TFBSs identiﬁed by ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip ex-
periments. As reported by Johnson et al. (2007), about 94% of
the actual binding sites can be located within 50 bases of signal
peaks. However, no clipping was done for sequences produced
by ChIP-seq experiments because information about the signal
peak is not available in PAZAR. The new collection contains 66
TF models, 39, 20 and 7 of which are human, mouse and rat,
respectively.

2.2 Support for more species

The initial release of LASAGNA-Search 2.0 supports seven spe-
cies for automatic promoter sequence retrieval and Visualization
in the UCSC genome browser. This is an important feature be-
cause the genomic locations of sequences retrieved by
LASAGNA-Search are available. The genomic locations of
user-supplied sequences in the FASTA format, however, are
unknown. Consequently, putative binding sites found in user-
supplied sequences can only be Visualized locally at
LASAGNA-Search not in the UCSC genome browser. To
make LASAGNA-Search more useful, we have added support
for eight additional species since the initial release. The newly
added species are Bos taurus, Sus scrofa, Ovis aries, Gallus gallus,
Canis lupus familiaris, Felis catus, X enopus (Silurana) tropicalis
and Danio rerio. More importantly, we have automated adding
support for a new species. As long as information about tran-
scription start sites is available in the UCSC genome browser
database, a new species can be added with ease. Hence, we en-
courage users to request for new species to meet their research or
teaching need.

2.3 Hardware and user interface

LASAGNA-Search was initially deployed on a shared web
server. To better serve the users, LASAGNA-Search 2.0 is now
powered by a cluster with a load balancer to direct incoming
trafﬁc, making it more scalable. This enabled us to add more
options to retrieve longer promoter sequences, which were

capped at 1000 bps because of limited computation capacity.
To make TF model selection easier, the model information
page with a sequence logo does not need to be opened in a
new tab. It can now be displayed when mouse pointer hovers
over. To Visualize hits locally, LASAGNA-Search displays only
the region of promoter from the ﬁrst hit to the last hit. An option
has been added to display the entire promoter, and hence, the
saved images are aligned by transcription start sites.

3 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION

LASAGNA-Search 2.0 was designed to be a user-friendly and
an easy-to-use webtool for TFBS search and Visualization.
Users do not need to be bioinformaticians and can start
using the tool immediately. Besides research, LASAGNA-
Search 2.0 is well-suited for teaching and class projects at the
undergraduate level, where students have limited experience in
programming. To keep the tool useful, we plan to include
support for species on users’ request and keep the TF model
collections up-to-date by incorporating new database releases
such as JASPAR 2014 (Mathelier et al., 2013). To easily use
ChIP-seq data, we plan to interface with a genomic cloud com-
puting platform such as the Illumina BaseSpace. This way users
can easily use motifs discovered in ChIP-seq experiments of one
species to scan sequences of another species. A genomic cloud
computing platform allows users to perform computation-
intensive analyses in a browser, which is in line with
LASAGNA-Search.

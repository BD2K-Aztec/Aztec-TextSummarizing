Abstract

Summary: Copy number abnormalities (CNAs) such as somatically-acquired chromosomal dele-
tions and duplications drive the development of cancer. As individual tumor genomes can contain
tens or even hundreds of large and/or focal CNAs, a major difficulty is differentiating between im-
portant, recurrent pathogenic changes and benign changes unrelated to the subject’s phenotype.
Here we present Copy Number Explorer, an interactive tool for mining large copy number datasets.
Copy Number Explorer facilitates rapid visual and statistical identification of recurrent regions of
gain or loss, identifies the genes most likely to drive CNA formation using the cghMCR method and
identifies recurrently broken genes that may be disrupted or fused. The software also allows users
to identify recurrent CNA regions that may be associated with differential survival.

1 Motivation

Huge volumes of genomics data from nearly every cancer type are
now freely available and innovative projects such as UCSC Cancer
Genomics Browser (Cline et al., 2013), cBioPortal (Cerami et al.,
2012) and arrayMap (Cai et al., 2015) have begun to collate and
store this information.

Those analyzing cancer copy number data often wish to know
the location of recurrent CNAs in a given tumor type and which
genes are likely to be driving that gain or loss. Additionally, some
may wish to know which genes are recurrently broken as this can in-
dicate a potential tumor suppressor loss or gene fusion. It is, how-
ever, challenging to analyze CNA regions in these ways using
current gene-centric or non-interactive approaches. This is problem-
atic since the presence or absence of a certain CNA can aid in diag-
nosis, stratify patients into different risk categories or inform
therapy decisions.

Copy Number Explorer rapidly generates and displays inter-
active CNA and breakage frequency plots from public data such as
the TCGA or from the user’s own study. The software requires only
segmented copy number data as is generated from popular segmen-
tation algorithms such as DNAcopy (Venkatraman and Olshen,

2007). Subsequently, it is possible to combine data from different
studies or from an internal database—even if data were generated
using different array designs or next generation sequencing. Here we
demonstrate the utility of Copy Number Explorer by applying it to
the TCGA Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) data (Brennan et al.,
2013).

2 Implementation

The software is written in R and tested using version 3.0.2. Tier 3
segmented SNP6 array copy number and survival data were down-
loaded from the TCGA data portal (https://tcgadata.nci.nih.gov-/
tcga/). The software calculates CNA frequency of every gene in the
human hg19 RefSeq gene set by assigning it the log2 ratio of the
copy number segment from which it was derived. By default, any
gene whose segmented log ratio is greater than 0.2 is considered
gained and less than —0.2 is considered lost (thresholds are, how-
ever, customizable) and the total number of samples crossing these
thresholds are calculated. Segment Gain or Loss (SGOL) scores are
calculated for RefSeq genes using the SGOL function of the
cghMCR package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release-lbioc/

html/cghMCR.html). Gene-level frequency of gain, loss and break-
age are calculated using Perl and R scripts. Survival analysis is per-
formed with the R survival package according to standard methods.
Interactive CNA plots and survival curves are made visible through
a web browser using the Shiny R package (www.rstudio.com/shiny).
An online version was deployed using ShinyApps.io (www.shi-

nyapps.io).

3 Example

Copy Number Explorer produces frequency profiles in which recur-
rent CNA regions can be identified. For example, the combined pro-
file from 580 GBM tumors showed gains of chromosome seven and
losses of chromosome ten were the most common events (Fig. 1A).
Numerous other focally altered (<~10 Mb) regions were also evi-
dent including loss of 9p21.3 containing CDKNZA/B in ~70% of
samples and amplification or gain 1q32.1 containing MDM4 and
PIK3 C2B in ~23% of samples. These findings are in keeping with
other published studies (Brennan et al., 2013).

Several statistical frameworks aim to identify the gene targets of
amplification and deletion including GISTIC, RAE and cghMCR
(Aguirre et al., 2004; Beroukhim et al., 2007; Taylor et al., 2008).
Copy Number Explorer deploys cghMCR as it runs within R and
does not require raw data or probe mapping information. The
cghMCR transformation exacerbated known recurrent abnormal-
ities such as amplifications of MDM4, PDGFR, EGFR, CDK4 and
MDMZ and deletions of CDKNZA/B (Fig. 1B).

The presence of a CNA, such as EGFR amplification in GBM,
can predict outcome (Verhaak et al., 2010). Copy Number Explorer
can partition the data based on the presence of a gain, amplification
or homozygous loss in any genomic region. If the dataset is clinically
annotated, then the software can construct Kaplan—Meier curves for
each group that are compared based on a log-rank test. For example,
after partitioning the data based on the presence of gain or amplifi-
cation of any region containing EGFR (chr7:55 086725 -
55275 031[hg19]) the gained/amplified group (n = 499) showed a
poorer prognosis than the non-gained/amplified group (n = 81)
(P < 0.0001 by log rank test) (Fig. 1C—E).

Copy number change points often fall within genes and imply dis-
ruption due to a structural change such as an unbalanced transloca-
tion. Gene breakage can imply loss of function or alternatively gain of
function through gene fusion. Copy Number Explorer produces
breakpoint frequency plots summarizing the proportion of cases with
copy number change points within each gene. The three most broken
genes in the TCGA data were EGFR (27%), CDKNZB-ASI (19%)
and PTEN (8%; not shown). Breakage of the EGFR gene may imply
an EGFR gene fusion as has been described previously while breaks
in CDKNZB-ASI and PTEN imply disruption of tumor suppressor
genes either at or close to the break (Brennan et al., 2013).

4 Conclusions

Copy Number Explorer is a free and easy to use tool that aids in the
interpretation of copy number data from large cancer studies.

We used the TCGA GBM data for this analysis, but the software
can use segmented copy number data from any source, indeed the
online version currently houses all publically released TCGA copy
number datasets. We also note that a private instance can be run on
the user’s own local computer or easily be deployed online with a
single R command using ShinyApps.io.

Fig. 1. Copy Number Explorer Workflow. (A) Aberration frequency plot shows
proportion of samples with gains and losses from GBM (n=580).
Chromosomes are placed in order along the x—axis and the proportion of
gains (dark grey; positive numbers) or losses (light grey; negative numbers)
are shown on the y-axis. (B) cghMCR-transformed data results in a segment
gain or loss (SGOL) score on the y-axis. High absolute SGOL scores indicate
one or a combination of highly focal, high frequency or a high magnitude of
alterations across multiple samples: SGOL score can be used to identify the
gene most likely to be the target of gain or loss. Genes with the highest SGOL
scores for chromosomes 1, 4, 7, 9 and 12 are indicated. (C, D) Data is parti-
tioned based on the presence of a gain or amplification of the EGFR locus
(indicated by an asterisk). Group 1 (n=499) (C) shows 100% of cases have
this abnormality whereas no cases in Group 2 (n=81) do (D). (E) Kaplan—
Meier curve shows that subjects with an EGFR gain or amplification have a
poorer prognosis than those without

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identification of microRNA regulatory modules (MiRMs)
will aid deciphering aberrant transcriptional regulatory network in
cancer but is computationally challenging. Existing methods are sto-
chastic or require a fixed number of regulatory modules.

Results: We propose Mirsynergy, an efficient deterministic overlap-
ping clustering algorithm adapted from a recently developed frame-
work. Mirsynergy operates in two stages: it first forms MiRMs based
on co-occurring microRNA (miRNA) targets and then expands each
MiRM by greedily including (excluding) mRNAs into (from) the MiRM to
maximize the synergy score, which is a function of miRNA—mRNA and
gene—gene interactions. Using expression data for ovarian, breast and
thyroid cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we compared
Mirsynergy with internal controls and existing methods. Mirsynergy-
MiRMs exhibit significantly higher functional enrichment and more
coherent miRNA—mRNA expression anti-correlation. Based on
Kaplan—Meier survival analysis, we proposed several prognostically
promising MiRMs and envisioned their utility in cancer research.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22 nt small non-coding RNA that
base pair with mRNAs primarily at the 3’ untranslated region
(UTR) to cause mRNA degradation or translational repression
(Bartel, 2009). Aberrant miRNA expression is implicated in
tumourigenesis (Spizzo et al., 2009). Based on miRBase (release
20) (Kozomara and Grifﬁths-J ones, 2014), the human genome
encodes 1872 (2578) precursor (mature) miRNAs, which poten-
tially target majority of the human genes (Friedman et al., 2009).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.
TThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two
authors should be regarded as Joint First Authors.

Although targets of individual miRNAs are signiﬁcantly en-
riched for certain biological processes (Papadopoulos et al.,
2009; Tsang et al., 2010), it is also likely that multiple miRNAs
are coordinated together to synergistically regulate one or more
pathways (Boross et al., 2009; Krek et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2011).
Despite their limited number, miRNAs may be in charge of more
evolutionarily robust and potent regulatory effects through coor-
dinated collective actions. The hypothesis of miRNA synergism
is also parsimonious or biologically plausible because the number
of possible combinations of the 2578 human miRNAs is ex-
tremely large to potentially react to Virtually countless environ-
mental changes. Intuitively, if a group of (miRNA) workers
perform similar tasks together, then removing a single worker
will not be as detrimental as assigning each worker a unique task
(Boross et al., 2009).

Several related methods have been developed to study miRNA
synergism. Some early methods were based on pairwise overlaps
(Shalgi et al., 2007) or score-speciﬁc correlation Oiu et al., 2011)
between predicted target sites of any given two (co-expressed)
miRNAs. For instance, Shalgi et al. (2007) devised an overlap-
ping scoring scheme to account for differential 3’UTR lengths of
the miRNA targets, which may otherwise bias the results if
standard hypergeometric test was used. Methods beyond pair-
wise overlaps have also been described. These methods consider
not only the sequence-based miRNA-target site information but
also the respective miRNA—mRNA expression correlation
(MiMEC) across various conditions to detect miRNA regulatory
modules (MiRMs).

Brieﬂy, J oung et al. (2007) developed a probabilistic search
procedure to separately sample from the mRNA and miRNA
pools candidate module members with probabilities proportional
to their overall frequency of being chosen as the ‘fittest’, which is
determined by their target sites and MiMEC relative to the coun-
terparts. The algorithm f1nds only a single best MiRM, which
varies depending on the initial mRNA and miRNA set. Peng
et al. (2009) used a maximal bi-clique enumeration (MBE) tech-
nique to discover complete bipartite subgraphs, where every
miRNA is connected with every mRNA. The approach operates
on unweighted edges only, which requires discretizing MiMEC.
Moreover, maximal bi-clique does not necessarily imply func-
tional MiRMs and Vice versa. Le and Bar-Joseph (2011)
developed GroupMiR to form MiRMs by assigning each
miRNA or mRNA (m/miRNA) one or more memberships

based on a non-parametric Bayesian prior called Indian Buffet
Process. Although GroupMiR is statistically sound, it has time
complexity cubic to the number of observations and converges
slow on large datasets (Grifﬁths and Ghahramani, 2005).

More recently, Zhang et al. (2011) described a framework of
sparse network-regularized multiple non-negative matrix factor-
ization (SNMNMF) to identify miRNA—mRNA modules based
on the factorized coefﬁcient matrices. Importantly, SNMNMF
uses not only the expression and target-site information but also
the gene—gene interaction (GGI) derived from protein—protein
interaction (PPI) and transcription factor binding sites (TF BS).
To deﬁne the reduced dimensionality of the factorized matrices,
however, the SNMNMF approach requires a predeﬁned number
of modules, which may be data-dependent and difﬁcult to deter-
mine beforehand. Additionally, the solution to NMF is often not
unique, and the identiﬁed modules do not necessarily include
both miRNAs and mRNAs, which makes reproducing and in-
terpreting the results difﬁcult. Similarly, the regression-based
model called PIMiM (Protein Interaction-based MicroRNA
Modules) developed by Le and Bar-Joseph (2013) also requires
a ﬁxed number of unique memberships, and the non-convexity
of the algorithm leads to different outcomes with random
initializations. Additionally, both algorithms incur a time com-
plexity quadratic to both the number of miRNA and mRNA
multiplied by the (squared) total number of modules per iter-
ation. We herein hypothesize that an intuitively simple and efﬁ-
cient deterministic framework may serve as an attractive
alternative.

In this article, we propose a novel model called Mirsynergy
that integrates m/miRNA expression proﬁles, target site infor-
mation and GGI to form MiRMs, where an m/miRNA may
participate in multiple MiRMs, and the module number is sys-
tematically determined given the predeﬁned model parameters.
The clustering algorithm of Mirsynergy adapts from
ClusterONE (Nepusz et al., 2012), which was intended to identify
protein complex from PPI data. The ultimate goal here, however,
is to construct a priori the MiRMs and exploit them to better
explain clinical outcomes such as patient survival rate. We apply
Mirsynergy to ovarian (OV), breast (BRCA) and thyroid cancer
(THCA) datasets from TCGA (Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, 2008). Comparing with alternative formalisms, we ﬁnd
that the Mirsynergy-based modules are more functionally en-
riched and exhibit more negative MiMEC. Through Kaplan—
Meier (KM) survival analysis, we propose several prognostically
promising cancer-speciﬁc MiRMs as biomarkers.

2 METHODS

2.1 Mirsynergy model overview

We formulate the construction of synergistic MiRMs as an overlapping
clustering problem with two main stages. Figure 1 depicts our model
schema. Before the two clustering stages, we ﬁrst inferred miRNA—
mRNA interaction weights (MMIW) (W) using m/miRNA expression
data and target site information (Section 2.2). At stage 1, we only cluster
miRNAs to greedily maximize miRNA—miRNA synergy, which is pro-
portional to the correlation between miRNAs in terms of their MMIW
(See Section 2.2). At stage 2, we ﬁx the MiRM assignments and greedily
add (remove) genes to (from) each MiRM to maximize the synergy score,
which is deﬁned as a function of the MMIW matrix and the gene—gene

proﬁles and sequence-based target site information, we ﬁrst derive an
expression-based MMIW matrix W using Ll-norm regularized linear re-
gression model (i.e. LASSO). We then compute miRNA—miRNA syner-
gistic scores S based on the MMIW matrix, which is subsequently
provided as input to form miRNA clusters V0 at Stage 1 by an over-
lapping neighbourhood expansion clustering algorithm. Next, we ﬁx the
MiRM assignments V0 and greedily add (remove) mRNA to (from) each
module that maximizes the synergy score, where the edge weights are
deﬁned by the MMIW matrix and GGIW matrix involving known
TFBS and PPI. The end results are overlapping clustering assignments
of m/miRNAs (i.e., MiRMs)

rithm at both stages (Section 2.3) adapts from ClusterONE, which was
originally developed for PPI network Wepusz et al., 2012).

2.2 Evaluation of expression-based prediction models

To compute MMIW as the edge-weight matrix for downstream cluster-
ing, we ﬁrst evaluated four prominent expression-based miRNA target
prediction algorithms, namely Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (PCC)
(Zhang et al., 2011), GenMiR+ + (Huang et al., 2007) and two formu-
lations of LASSO (Lu et al., 2011). Speciﬁcally, PCC between each pair
of m/miRNA across T samples was computed using R built-in function
cor. Targets with negative correlation were ranked at the top.
GenMiR+ + was ran in Matlab with default setting using as input the
binary target site matrix and the expression proﬁles. We implemented two
versions of LASSO both using glmnet with or = 1 except that the best A
was chosen using cross-validation function cv . glmnet (Friedman et al.,
2010). For the ﬁrst LASSO, we used expression of miRNAs
k e {1, . . . , M} that have non-zero target sites to model the corresponding

mRNA expression i e {1 . . . , N} across samples t e {1 . . . T}:
xi,t~w,-,o +Zk wi,k(zk,tc,-,k), where who is the bias, 6),], is the number of
target sites in mRNA i for miRNA k, ka e WNxM is the ﬁtted linear
coefﬁcients used for the MMIW. For the second LASSO, namely
LASSO_RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), we used target site
counts, miRNA, and Ago 1—4 mRNA expression as the input variable:
xi,t~w,-,o + 2k Wi’kAgOZZk’tCi’k + 2k wg’kAg01,3,4zk,t. The rationale behind
LASSO_RISC is that Ago2 is the only protein component known to
catalyse target mRNA degradation whereas the non-catalytic Ago 1,3,4
proteins may compete with Ago2 to bind to miRNAs; thus, the expres-
sion changes in the Ago 1, 3, 4 proteins will affect the ability of Ago2 to
bind to miRNAs (Lu et al., 2011). For LASSO and LASSO_RISC, inter-
actions associated with negative linear coefﬁcients ka (i.e. MMIW) were
ranked at the top as the candidate interactions.

Because of the scarcity of the validated miRNA targets, conventional
power analysis such as ROC (receiver operating characteristic) cannot
distinguish the method performances. Instead, we assessed each method
by the number of validated interactions they identiﬁed among their top
ranked 1000—5000 targets (1000-interval) based on miRTarBase (Hsu
et al., 2011). Among the four methods, LASSO achieved the best overall
performance on our test data (Supplementary Fig. S1). Accordingly, we
adopted the linear coefﬁcient matrix wijC e W from LASSO as the N x M
MMIW matrix and set all of its positive coefﬁcients to zero, assuming
only negative miRNA regulation.

2.3 Two-stage clustering

Let W denote the expression-based N x M MMIW matrix obtained
from LASSO, determined as the best performing target predic-
tion model in Section 2.2, where ka is the scoring weight for
miRNA k targeting mRNA i. Similar to the ‘Meet/Min’ score deﬁned
by Shalgi et al. (2007) for binary interactions of co-occurring targets
of miRNA pairs, we deﬁne an M x M scoring matrix denoted as S,
indicating miRNA—miRNA synergistic scores between miRNA j and k

(1' 75 k):
N
Z WiJWi,k
i=1
min  WU, 2 wk]

Notably, if W were a binary matrix, Equation I became the ratio of
number of targets shared between miRNA j and k over the minimum
number of targets possessed by j or k, which is essentially the original
‘Meet/Min’ score.

Similar to the cohesiveness deﬁned by Nepusz et al. (2012), we deﬁne
synergy score s( Vc) for any given MiRM Vc as follows. Let wi”(Vc) denote
the total weights of the internal edges within the miRNA cluster,
wb0“”d( V.) the total weights of the boundary edges connecting the
miRNAs within Vc to the miRNAs outside Vc, and 05(Vc) the penalty
scores for forming cluster Vc. The synergy of Vc (i.e. the objective func-
tion) is as follows:

 

(1)

$ch =

Win(Vc)

S( Vc) = Win(Vc) + Wbound( Vc) + Ot( Vc)

 

(2)

where a( Vc) reﬂects our limited knowledge on potential unknown targets
of the added miRNAs as well as the false-positive targets within the
cluster. Presumably, these unknown factors will affect our decision on
whether miRNA k belong to cluster Vc. For instance, miRNAs may
target non-coding RNAs and seedless targets, which are the mRNAs
with no perfect seed-match OIelwak et al., 2013). We currently consider
only mRNA targets with seed-match to minimize the number of false-
positive results. By default, we set a( V.) = 2| Vcl, where |Vc| is the cardin-
ality of Vc. Additionally, we deﬁne two scoring functions to assess the

overlap a)( V6, ch) between Vc and W for c 75 c’ and the density d1(Vc) of
any given Vc:

_ IVc n V512
“’(VC’ V‘")_ IVCIIVC/I (3)
d1(Vc)= —;:::(_Vcl)) (4)

where IVC O chl is the total number of common elements in Vc and ch,
and m is the number of miRNAs in V0.

The general solution for solving an overlapping clustering problem is
Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) (Barthélemy and
Brucker, 2001). Thus, we adapt a greedy-based approach (Nepusz
et al., 2012). The algorithm can be divided into two major steps. In
step 1, we select as an initial seed miRNA k with the highest total weights.
We then grow an MiRM V, from seed k by iteratively including boundary
or excluding internal miRNAs to maximize the synergy s( V,) (Equation 2)
until no more node can be added or removed to improve s( V,). We then
pick another miRNA that has neither been considered as seed nor
included in any previously expanded V, to form VH1. The entire process
terminates when all of the miRNAs are considered. In step 2, we treat the
clusters as a graph with Vc as nodes and a)( V6, V6,) 2 ‘L’ as edges. Here ‘L’ is
a free parameter. Empirically, we observed that most MiRMs are quite
distinct from one another in terms of a)( V6, ch) (before the merging)
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Accordingly, we set ‘L’ to 0.8 to ensure merging
only similar MiRMs, which avoids producing large MiRMs (when ‘L’ is
too small). We then perform a breath-ﬁrst search to ﬁnd all of the weakly
connected components (CC), each containing clusters that can reach dir-
ectly/indirectly to one another within the CC. We merge all of the clusters
in the same CC and update the synergy score accordingly. Algorithm 1
outlines the pseudocode.

After forming MiRMs at stage 1, we perform a similar clustering pro-
cedure as in Algorithm 1 by adding (removing) only the mRNAs to (from)
each MiRM. Different from stage 1, however, we grow each existing
MiRM separately with no prioritized seed selection or cluster merging,
which allows us to implement a parallel computation by taking advantage
of the multicore processors in the modern computers. In growing/con-
tracting each MiRM, we maximize the same synergy function (Equation
2) but changing the edge weight matrix from S to a (N + 114) x (N + A4)
matrix by combining W (the N x M MMIW matrix) and H (the N x N
GGIW matrix). Notably, here we assume miRNA—miRNA edges to be
zero. Additionally, we do not add/remove miRNAs to/from the MiRM
at each greedy step. Finally, we deﬁne a new density function because of
the connectivity change at stage 2:

win( V6)

6120/6) = n(m +n — 1)

(5)
where n (m) are the number of mRNAs (miRNAs) in Vc. By default, we
ﬁlter out MiRMs with d1(V,-)<1e—2 and d2(I/j) < 5e—3 at stage 1 and 2,
respectively. Both density thresholds were chosen based on our empirical
analyses (Supplementary Fig. S2). For some datasets, in particular, we
found that our greedy approach tends to produce a large cluster involving
several hundred miRNAs or several thousand mRNAs at Stage 1 or 2,
respectively, which are unlikely to be biologically meaningful. Despite the
ever increasing synergy (by deﬁnition), however, the anomaly modules all
have low density scores, which allows us to ﬁlter them out using the
above chosen thresholds.

The time complexity of the algorithm is 0(M(N + M)): stage 1 takes
0(M2) in the worst case scenario by checking every miRNA in forming
an MiRM using every miRNA as a seed; given that the maximum
number of MiRMs is M, stage 2 takes 0(NM). In our actual implemen-
tation, the total weights of each node is pre-computed so that the synergy
update is 0(1). Moreover, we maintain a sorted list using numbers to
represent m/miRNA nodes for efﬁcient binary search of neighbour or
removable nodes.

2.4 Method comparisons

To compare the performance of Mirsynergy, we applied SNMNMF
(Zhang et al., 2011) to the same testing data. SNMNMF is one of the
most cited works in the recent literature and has been shown to outper-
form the MBE approach introduced earlier by Peng et al. (2009).
SNMNMF was implemented in Matlab with source code available. As
suggested by the authors, we set the required module number to 50 and
used the default settings throughout the tests. Additionally, we also com-
pared our results (using the same test dataset) with the published results
from another recent algorithm called PIMiM developed by Le and Bar-
Joseph (2013), which was shown to outperform SNMNMF, but the soft-
ware is not publicly available.

2.5 Functional enrichment comparison

We examined whether the target genes in each MiRM are involved in
biologically meaningful Gene Ontology (GO) or pathways Via functional
enrichment analysis. Speciﬁcally, GO terms in biological processes (BPs)
(GO-BPS) were downloaded using getBM function from R package
biomaRt, where GO terms with fewer than ﬁve genes or with evidence
codes equal to Electronic Annotation, Non-traceable Author Statement
or No biological Data available were discarded, giving 2007 GO-BP
terms and 10315 unique genes. The canonical pathways were down-
loaded from MSigDB (c2.cp.v4.0.symbols.gmt) (Subramanian et al.,
2005). The list of Ensembl gene IDs for each MiRM was then subjected

to hypergeometric enrichment test for each GO-BP term or pathways
using R built-in function phyper. The P—Values were corrected for mul-
tiple testing by R function p . adjust to produce false discovery rates
(FDR).

2.6 Data collection and pre-processing

For the ﬁrst test dataset, we obtained the same ovarian cancer dataset
processed by the SNMNMF authors (Zhang et al., 2011). The expression
data from this dataset were originally downloaded from TCGA along
with the target site information from MicroCosm (V5) and GGI from
TRANSFAC Wingender et al., 2000). The expression dataset contains
385 samples, each measuring 559 miRNAs and 12456 mRNAs. For the
second and third test datasets, we downloaded the expression data for
BRCA and THCA from TCGA data portal. The BRCA and THCA data
contain 331 and 543 samples, respectively, each measuring 710 miRNAs
and 13 306 mRNAs. For both datasets, processed (level 3) RNA-seq(V 2)
and miRNA-seq data were used, which record the RPKM (read per
kilobase of exon per million mapped reads) values for mRNAs and
RPM (reads per million miRNAs mapped) for miRNAs. The data
were further log2—transformed and mean-centred. Clinical information
for OV, BRCA and THCA were also collected from TCGA.

For the BRCA and THCA, we used target site information from
TargetScanHuman 6.2 database (Friedman et al., 2009). For each
mRNA—miRNA pair that have measured expression in TCGA data,
we extracted the corresponding conserved target sites. For multiple tran-
scripts of the same gene, we used transcripts with the longest 3’UTR.
GGI data matrix H including TFBS and PPI data were processed from
TRANSFAC Wingender et al., 2000) and BioGrid (Stark et al., 2011)
databases, respectively. Cancer-related miRNAs as oncomirs or tumour
suppressors (i.e. miRNAs highly or lowly expressed in cancers) were
downloaded from Spizzo et al. (2009) and Koturbash et al. (2011)
Tables 1 and 2, where 97 oncomirs have measured expression in the
TCGA data.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Comparison of module sizes and connectivities

Mirsynergy identiﬁed 84, 53, 50 MiRMs in CV, BRCA and
THCA datasets, respectively (Table 1, Supplementary Table
S1). Intriguingly, the overall synergy landscapes are distinct for
each cancer type at both clustering stages (Supplementary Fig.
S3). Comparing with the MiRMs from SNMNMF, however, the
modules identiﬁed by Mirsynergy are clearly more densely con-
nected within and between MiRMs (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs
S4, S5), which are comparable with the module density asso-
ciated with PIMiM-MiRMs (on the same OV dataset) (Le and
Bar-Joseph, 2013) and perhaps more consistent with the intricacy
of the underlying biological network. Moreover, Mirsynergy
identiﬁed more modules (84, 53, 50) than SNMNMF did (49,
39, 39) for OV, BRCA and THCA, respectively (Table 1).
Notably, although we set K = 50 for SNMNMF, some modules
were empty and thus discarded by the algorithm. For OV,
BRCA and THCA datasets, the respective averaged number of
miRNAs (genes) per module are 4.76, 5.77, 7.60 (7.57, 24.15,
32.26) for Mirsynergy and 4.12, 2.62, 2.23 (81.37, 71.56, 74.82)
for SNMNMF (Table 1). For the BRCA and THCA datasets, 8/
39 modules from SNMNMF have only one miRNA (i.e. ‘star-
shape’ basic network structure) and 20/ 39 modules have less than
three miRNAs. In contrast, all of the modules from Mirsynergy
have more than one miRNA, and most modules have at least

correlation; Time: number of hours took to run. Notably, LASSO alone took about an hour, which is included in the above run time of Mirsynergy. 7The results for PIMiM
were directly taken from the original paper (Le and Bar-Joseph, 2013), where GOES and Time are not available (NA). The comparison here is fair because all of three methods

were applied to the same 0V dataset used in Zhang et al. (2011).

Fig. 2. Network overview using ovarian dataset. The networks from
SNMNMF (left) and Mirsynergy (right) were rendered by Cytoscape 3
(Shannon et al., 2003). Edges represent either miRNA—mRNA (solid red
line) or gene—gene interactions (dash blue line)

three miRNAs (Supplementary Table S1). Moreover, the max-
imum number of miRNAs in a single Mirsynergy-MiRM are 12,
20 and 19 for OV, BRCA and THCA, respectively. In contrast,
PIMiM obtained at maximum eight miRNAs per module for
the 0V dataset, and the highest miRNA counts for the
SNMNMF modules are 9, 5 and 7 for OV, BRCA and
THCA, respectively. Notably, there are considerably fewer
genes in the Mirsynergy-MiRMs than in modules identiﬁed
by SNMNMF and PIMiM. This perhaps implies that each
MiRM identiﬁed by Mirsynergy is responsible for a more spe-
ciﬁc biological process or pathway, which is supported by the
functional enrichment analysis described below. Thus,
Mirsynergy predictions are in better agreement with the notion
of miRNA synergistic regulation, where a relatively large
number of miRNAs can engage in regulating a specialized
cohort of interconnected genes.

3.2 Evaluating MiRMs by functional enrichments

As an internal control, we ﬁrst compared whether the nodes
included in each MiRM (i.e. internal nodes) tend to be more
functionally enriched than the boundary nodes, which have
non-zero connections to the internal nodes but were either dis-
regarded or removed from the modules during the neighbour-
hood expansion. As illustrated in Figure 3 (Supplementary
Fig. S6), the number of signiﬁcant GO-BP terms at
F DR<0.05 (upper panel) and the total enrichment scores
across all terms (lower panel) are signiﬁcantly higher (P<1e-3;
one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test) for the internal nodes
comparing with boundary nodes. Interestingly, we also observed
modestly positive Pearson correlations (,oOV = 0.14;
,oBRCA = 0.28; ,oTHCA = 0.39) between the synergy and enrich-
ment scores (Supplementary Fig. S7), further supporting the bio-
logical function of the identiﬁed modules.

To compare functional enrichments of the predicted modules
from Mirsynergy and SNMNMF, we counted as a function of
enrichment score the number of signiﬁcant modules having at
least one signiﬁcant canonical pathways (CPs) or GO-BPs and
the total number of signiﬁcant CPs or GO-BPs across all mod-
ules. As depicted in Figure 4 (Supplementary Fig. S8), comparing
with SNMNMF, Mirsynergy produced signiﬁcantly higher
number of functionally meaningful MiRMs (upper panel)
(P<0.00781, 0.00707, respectively; one-sided Wilcoxon signed
rank test), which together contribute signiﬁcantly higher
number of distinct CPs or GO-BPs (P<0.00781, 0.00195, re-
spectively). Moreover, Mirsynergy also compares favourably
with PIMiM, which used the same ovarian dataset, target site
information and GGI data based on the published results from
Le and Bar-Joseph (2013) (Fig. 4A). Notably, the averaged en-
richment scores over all of the Mirsynergy-MiRMs are also
higher than the scores from SNMNMF in all three test datasets
(Table 1).

Examining enriched GO terms exclusive to Mirsynergy-
MiRMs (Supplementary Table S2) revealed several interesting
cancer-related processes, e.g. ‘DNA damage response, signal
transduction by p53 class mediator’ (GO:0030330;
FDR<0.016; OV—MiRM-4), which involves oncogene BCL3
(Forbes et al., 2011) and OV—related oncomir miR-20a
(Koturbash et al., 2011); ‘ovarian follicle development’

Fig. 3. Comparison of internal and boundary nodes of each MiRM in
ovarian cancer. For each MiRM, we calculated the number of signiﬁcant
GO-BP terms (FDR<0.05; upper panel) and GO enrichment scores
(lower panel) using the internal nodes (solid) (i.e. nodes included in the
MiRMs) and boundary nodes (dash) (i.e. nodes connected to internal
nodes but disregarded or excluded from the MiRM to maximize synergy
score). P—Values from one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test of internal
nodes versus boundary nodes across all MiRMs are indicated in the
right margins

(GO:0001541; FDR<0.022; OV-MiRM-58), involving an OV-
related oncomir miR-221; and ‘negative regulation of epithelial
to mesenchymal transition’ (GO:0010719; F DR<0.037; BRCA-
MiRM-l; also see Supplementary Fig. S9), which is known to be
associated with breast cancer (Davis et al., 2013). It is also inter-
esting to note that the miR-30 family members hsa-miR-30a
(chr6: 72113254-324) and miR-30e (chr1: 41220027-118)
(Kozomara and Grifﬁths-J ones, 2014) were both identiﬁed by
Mirsynergy to be involved in BRCA-MiRM-l. Moreover,
miR-30 has been predicted to regulate a number of breast
cancer-associated genes in patients, who are non-carriers of
BRCA1/2 mutations, lending the possibility that familial breast
cancer may be caused by variation in these miRNAs (Kozomara
and Grifﬁths-J ones, 2014). Additionally, module 11 and 23 from
THCA data are respectively enriched for ‘thymus development’
(GO:0048538; FDR<0.012; Supplementary Figs S10, S11) and
‘positive regulation of natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity
directed against tumour cell target’ (GO:0002860;
FDR<0.00012), both of which are exclusive to Mirsynergy-
MiRMs. Moreover, module 11 and 23 involve THCA-related
oncomirs miR-17 and 197, respectively (Supplementary Table
S2) (Koturbash et al., 2011).

3.3 Co-expression within MiRMs

We next examined the MiMEC involved in each predicted
MiRM from Mirsynergy comparing with the boundary nodes
(i.e. neighbour nodes of each MiRM) as the internal control
and MiRMs identiﬁed by SNMNMF. Because miRNAs are
known to repress mRNAs, the negativity of MiMEC is a rea-
sonable indicator of the MiRM quality. In particular, we used
OV, BRCA and THCA expression data from TCGA to compute
for each module (or control) the averaged pairwise MiMEC. We
then compared the cumulative density functions of the MiMEC
from each method. We ﬁrst compared the MiMEC between in-
ternal nodes (m/miRNAs within the modules) and boundary

compared the distributions from Mirsynergy (solid) and SNMNMF

nodes (neighbour m/miRNAs with non-zero connection to the
internal nodes) from each Mirsynergy-MiRMs. Indeed, miRNAs
involved in the MiRMs exhibit signiﬁcantly more negative cor-
relation with the included mRNA targets for all three datasets
(Fig. 5 left panels) [P<9.81e-10, 3.35e-12, 0 for OV, BRCA,
THCA, respectively; one-sided Kolmogorov—Smirnov (KS)
test]. More impressively, Mirsynergy-MiRMs exhibit signiﬁ-
cantly higher MiMEC than SNMNMF-MiRMs (P< 5.35e-12,
0.0041, 0.013 for OV, BRCA and THCA, respectively) (Fig. 5
right panels). As summarized in Table 1, the MiMEC averaged
over all of the Mirsynergy modules (—0.08, —0.08) are also twice
as more negative as those of SNMNMF (—0.04, —0.04) for BRCA
and THCA, and almost four folds more negative than the pub-
lished result from PIMiM (Le and Bar-Joseph, 2013) on the same
OV dataset.

3.4 KM survival analyses of MiRMs

Based on the clinical data from TCGA, we characterized the
level of associations of patient survival time from the date of
diagnosis to death with the discovered MiRMs by the averaged
miRNA expression levels. After ﬁltering out samples with un-
available survival time or not recorded in the expression data, we
retained 376/385, 331/331, and 259/543 samples for OV, BRCA

Expression correlation Expression correlation

Fig. 5. Cumulative density function of expression correlation between
miRNA and mRNA. Averaged Pearson correlation coefﬁcients for
each MiRM were plotted as a CDF for internal nodes/Mirsynergy
(solid) and boundary nodes/SNMNMF outputs (dash). We observe a
signiﬁcantly more negative MiMEC distribution for the internal nodes
or Mirsynergy-MiRMs, as their curves are clearly located on the left of
the curves from the counterparts. P—Values were computed by one-sided
KS test

and THCA, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). For each
module, we divided the samples into two groups based on the
lower and higher MiRM-averaged miRNA expression levels
than the sample means. We then used KM method using R
package survival to compare the survival characteristics of the
two groups, with signiﬁcance determined by the log-rank test.
The resulting P-Values were then corrected for multiple testing
using the Benjamini—Hochberg method over all of the MiRMs
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). As a result, we found four, one
and three MiRMs with FDR<0.1 for OV, BRCA and THCA
datasets, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S12). In contrast,
when testing using individual miRNA expression proﬁles
alone, none of the miRNAs survived the multiple testing correc-
tion, highlighting the statistical power gained by our network
approach.

For BRCA, oncomir miR-100 is involved in the potential
prognostic module 31. For THCA, we found oncomirs miR-
29a (MiRM-8), miR-215 (MiRM-40) and miR-23a/ 191
(MiRM-45). Figure 6 illustrates the KM survival curves for mod-
ules 62 and 44 in ovarian cancer and the visualization of the two
clusters generated from Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003).
Notably, OV—MiRM-62 involves three oncogenes, namely
BUBlB, CDKN2A, MYST4 (Forbes et al., 2011), and an onco-
mir miR-125a-3p (Koturbash et al., 2011). Moreover, the two
modules share a common miRNA miR-768-3p. Intriguingly,
Jiang et al. (2013) showed that downregulation miR-768-3p is
associated with MEK/ERK—mediated enhancement of protein
synthesis in melanoma cells. Here we provided to our knowledge

4 DISCUSSION

Recent works on miRNA dysregulation prove useful in cancer
research (Koturbash et al., 2011). To identify condition-speciﬁc
networks, however, most existing methods exploited only the
curated pathways or G0 terms. Methods for de novo network
reconstruction in some recent literatures operate only on
interactions involving differentially expressed genes (DEG) or
differentially expressed miRNA (Peng et al., 2009) because the
corresponding solutions quickly become intractable with increas-
ing number of m/miRNAs. However, the DEG/M-driven
approaches cannot capture subnetworks with accumulative
changes of m/miRNA that have been ﬁltered out either by indi-
vidual hypothesis testings or by multiple testing corrections.

In this article, we introduce Mirsynergy as a reasonable alter-
native approach. Notably, standard clustering methods such as
k-means or hierarchical clustering are not suitable for construct-
ing MiRMs, as these methods assign each data point to a unique

cluster. A recently developed greedy-based clustering method
ClusterONE is more realistic because it allows overlap between
clusters (Nepusz et al., 2012). However, ClusterONE was de-
veloped with physical PPI in mind. Mirsynergy extends from
ClusterONE to detecting MiRMs. The novelty of our approach
resides in a two-stage clustering strategy with each stage max-
imizing a synergy score as a function of either the miRNA-
miRNA synergistic co-regulation or miRNA—mRNA/gene—
gene interactions. Several methods have incorporated GGI as
PPI/TFBS in predicting MiRMs (Le and Bar-Joseph, 2013;
Zhang et al., 2011), which proved to be a more accurate ap-
proach than using miRNA-mRNA alone. Comparing with
recent methods such as SNMNMF (Zhang et al., 2011) and
PIMiM (Le and Bar-Joseph, 2013), however, an advantage of
our deterministic formalism is the automatic determination of
module number (given the predeﬁned thresholds to merge and
ﬁlter low quality clusters) and efﬁcient computation with theor-
etical bound reduced from 0(K(T + N + M)2) per iteration to
only 0(M(N + M)) for N (M) mRNAs (miRNAs) across T sam-
ples. Because N is usually much larger than M and T, our algo-
rithm runs orders of faster. Based on our tests on a linux server,
Mirsynergy took about 2h including the run time for LASSO to
compute OV (N = 12 456; M = 559; T = 385), BRCA or THCA
(N = 13306; M = 710; T = 331 or 543, respectively), whereas
SNMNMF took more than a day for each dataset. More im-
portantly, Mirsynergy-MiRMs are signiﬁcantly more function-
ally enriched, coherently expressed and thus more likely to be
biologically functional.

The success of our model is likely attributable to its ability to
explicitly leverage two types of information at each clustering
stage: (i) the miRNA—miRNA synergism based on the correl-
ation of the inferred miRNA target score proﬁles from
MMIW matrix; (ii) the combinatorial miRNA regulatory effects
on existing genetic network, implicated in the combined MMIW
and GGIW matrices. We also explored other model formulations
such as clustering m/miRNAs in a single clustering stage or using
different MMIW matrices other than the one produced from
LASSO, which tends to produce MiRMs each containing only
one or a few miRNAs or several large low-quality MiRMs,
which were then ﬁltered out by the density threshold in either
clustering stage. Notably, an MiRM containing only a single
miRNA can be directly derived from the MMIW without any
clustering approach. Moreover, Mirsynergy considers only
neighbour nodes with non-zero edges. Thus, our model works
the best on a sparse MMIW matrix such as the outputs from
LASSO, which is the best performing expression-based methods
based on our comparison with other alternatives. Nonetheless,
the performance of Mirsynergy is sensitive to the quality of
MMIW and GGIW. In this regard, other MMIW or GGIW
matrices (generated from improved methods) can be easily incor-
porated into Mirsynergy as the function parameters by the users
of the Bioconductor package (please refer to the package vignette
for more details). In conclusion, with large amount of m/miRNA
expression data becoming available, we believe that Mirsynergy
will serve as a powerful tool for analysing condition-speciﬁc
miRNA regulatory networks.

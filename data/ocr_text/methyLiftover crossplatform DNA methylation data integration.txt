Abstract

Summary: The public availability of high throughput molecular data provides new opportunities
for researchers to advance discovery, replication and validation efforts. One common challenge in
leveraging such data is the diversity of measurement approaches and platforms and a lack of util—
ities enabling cross—platform comparisons among data sources for analysis. We present a method
to map DNA methylation data from bisulfite sequencing approaches to CpG sites measured with
the widely used Illumina methylation bead—array platforms. Correlations and median absolute devi—
ations support the validity of using bisulfite sequencing data in combination with Illumina bead—

array methylation data.

1 Introduction

The public availability of high throughput molecular data provides
new opportunities for researchers to advance discovery, replication
and validation efforts. One common challenge in leveraging such
data is the diversity of measurement approaches and platforms
(Laird, 2010) and a lack of utilities enabling cross—platform com—
parisons among data sources for analysis. We introduce the
methyLiftover utility, which allows simple and rapid remapping of
DNA methylation data collected with bisulfite sequencing
approaches to CpG sites measured with the widely used Illumina
beadarray platforms. The methyLiftover utility was developed to in—
crease the utility and comparability of the growing number of
whole—genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and reduced representa—
tion bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data sets for the large number of re—
searchers that collect and analyze methylation data from Illumina

HumanMethylation 450K array. Bisulfite sequencing approaches to
measure DNA methylation remain costly due to additional read
depth and alignment issues associated with the reduced complexity
of the bisulfite modified genome (Ziller et 61]., 2015). Though mul-
tiple large—scale epigenome characterization efforts using RRBS and
WGBS continue to produce additional data, the research community
will benefit from more readily available access and comparability of
these data with much more widely used (and far less expensive) bea—
darray platforms from Illumina.

2 Methods

The methyLiftover utility provides two main functions. liftoz/er450k
accepts a user defined file input containing WGBS data (in BED or
TXT format) and outputs an RData file containing sequencing data

only from those CpG sites that are measured with the 450K array,
selecting sites listed in the 450K annotation file via the
IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19 Bioconductor
package (Hansen, 2015) (based on coordinates from Human
Genome assembly hg19). The second function accepts two files (e.g.
one containing WGBS or RBBS data, another containing 450K data)
and joins them based on genomic position. Examples (with data) can
be found with the code on the GitHub site. We note that the code can
be used to reference the Illumina 850K annotation files using the
function liftoz/erUserFiles. To test the validity of using whole—genome
methylation values as a proxy for Illumina HumanMethylation 45 OK
BeadChip methylation data, we filtered for known cross-hybridizing
probes (Chen, 2013) calculated Pearson correlations (r) and median
absolute deviation (MAD) between WGBS and 45 OK data collected
from matched normal and tumor samples in The Cancer Genome
Atlas (11 : 22, Level : 3). For each biological specimen, we
calculated Pearson correlations between whole—genome percent
methylated values and 450K ‘beta values’ "' 100. Correlations were
mean—aggregated for each of five tissue/disease types: breast/BRCA,
bladder/BLCA, lung/LUAD, stomach/STAD and uterine/UCEC.
Illumina probe type normalization was done with beta—mixture quan—
tile normalization (BMIQ) (Teschendorff et al., 2015).

3 Results

Running the methyLiftover utility on a local machine (8GB memory)
is time efficient and low impact on computational resources. The tool
imports 27M row WGBS BED files into memory in 12—15 s.
Correlations within disease samples plateaued around a minimum
read depth of 10 reads (Fig. 1A) in BRCA (r = 0.96, MAD : 5.46),
BLCA (r = 0.95, MAD = 5.56), LUAD (r = 0.95, MAD = 5.79),
STAD (r = 0.94, MAD = 6.52) and UCEC (r = 0.96, MAD =
4.41). The correlations were similarly strong with a minimum read
depth of 10 reads in normal tissue (1’ = 0.95, MAD : 5.79, n = 5)
and in tumor tissue (1’ = 0.95, MAD : 5.62, n = 17) (Fig. 1B). We
identified an additional three matched samples (Heyn et al., 2012) in
DNA from whole blood. Due to differences in WGBS and 45 OK sam—
ple labeling, we were able to confidently pair two of the WGBS/450K
samples. Consistent with our TCGA results, the overall correlation be—
tween the 45 OK data and the methyLiftover WGBS subset in the two
samples from Heyn et al. were 0.94 for a 103—year—old patient and
0.96 for a newborn patient. The data did not contain read depth (pro—
vided in original TCGA analysis) so we are unable to stratify by min—
imum read count and add them to Figure 1. Additionally, a beta value
density comparison between BRCA normal and tumor samples is
shown in Supplementary Figure 1.

For type I Illumina probes (MAD : 3.5), Cst found in islands,
shores, shelfs and open seas had correlations of 0.96, 0.952, 0.92 and
0.93, respectively (Fig. 1C). For type II probes (MAD : 6.5), Cst
found in islands, shores, shelfs, and open seas had correlations of
0.96, 0.95, 0.91 and 0.93, respectively (Fig. 1D). The upper quartiles
of absolute deviation ranged from 10.5 to 17.5 and lower quartiles
ranged from 1.9 to 3.63 across all samples. Our findings are consist—
ent with previous comparisons of WGBS and 45 OK data in two paired
samples (R2 = 0.95 —0.96) (Bibikova, 2011). Further, correlation be—
tween methylation data from the Illumina 450K and the previous
Illumina 27K array platforms was similar (R2 > 95) (Bibikova, 201 1).

4 Conclusion

The use of WGBS and RRBS data in tandem with 45 OK methylation
may help to expand the sample sizes available for cell—type specific

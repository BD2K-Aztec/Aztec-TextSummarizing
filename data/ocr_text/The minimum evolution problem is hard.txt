Abstract

Motivation: Distance methods are well suited for constructing massive phylogenetic trees.
However, the computational complexity for thetsky and Nei’s minimum evolution (ME) approach,
one of the earliest methods for constructing a phylogenetic tree from a distance matrix, remains
open.

Results: We show that thetsky and Nei’s ME problem is NP—complete, and so probably computa-
tionally intractable. We do this by linking the ME problem to a graph clustering problem called the
quasi-clique decomposition problem, which has recently also been shown to be NP-complete. We
also discuss how this link could potentially open up some useful new connections between phylo-

 

genetics and graph clustering.

1 Introduction

One of the earliest distance-based approaches introduced to con-
struct a phylogenetic tree is the minimum evolution (ME) method.
It was first suggested by Kidd and Sgaramella-Zonta (1971) and
consists of two main steps: First branch lengths are assigned to
tree topologies based on a distance matrix, and then a topology is se-
lected which minimizes the sum of the branch lengths. There are sev-
eral variants of this approach which are reviewed in e.g. Catanzaro
(2009) and Desper and Gascuel (2005). Although model-based tree
construction methods, such as likelihood and Bayesian approaches,
are tending to supersede distance-based methods in the literature,
ME methods still remain popular. This is in part due to the fact that
large-scale sequencing applications such as metagenomics involve
constructing massive trees for which distance-based methods are
well suited (see e.g. Filipski et al., 2015).

In this article, we are interested in the ME approach introduced by
thetsky and Nei (1993). This is based on ordinary least squares

(OLS) estimates of branch lengths, served as a motivation for the
neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987), and is implemented
by Desper and Gascuel (2002) in the popular FastME software. It is
commonly believed that, just as the optimization problems arising
from the parsimony (Day, 1987) and the likelihood (Addario—Berry
et al., 2004) approaches, this version of the ME method also leads to
an NP-complete problem and, so, is probably computationally in-
tractable. However, even though this has been stated to be the case in
some of the literature (probably because tree construction based solely
on OLS for integer branch lengths is NP-complete—Day, 1987), to
our best knowledge this fact has not been formally proven. It should
also be noted, however, that the closely related and more recently
introduced balanced ME (BME) problem (Desper and Gascuel,
2002)—in which branch lengths are estimated by a special case of
weighted least squares (Desper and Gascuel, 2004)—has been shown
to be NP-complete (Fiorini and Joret, 2012).

ME problem is hard

Here, we shall show that the ME problem is NP-complete for trees
with integer branch lengths. In particular, to prove our main result, we
show that the ME problem is closely related to the so-called quasi-
clique decomposition problem, a special example of a graph clustering
problem (see, e.g. Pattillo et al., 2013) which has recently been shown
to be NP-complete by Kaya et al. (2013). We believe that the link that
we describe could open up some interesting and useful new connections
between the fields of phylogenetics and graph clustering (Schaeffer,
2007), a burgeoning area with several applications including pedigree
construction (Kirkpatrick et al., 2011) and community structure detec-
tion (Brunato et al., 2008).

The rest of the article is organized as follows. In the next section,
we show that certain OLS weightings for trees relative to a distance
matrix are related to clique properties in a graph that can be associ-
ated to the distance matrix. In the following section, we then show
that a rooted version of the ME problem is NP-complete, and ex-
plain how a technique used in Day (1987) can be used to show that
the ME problem is NP-complete (we provide the full proof for this
in the Supplementary appendix as it is quite technical in nature). In
the last section, we discuss a link between phylogenetics and graph
clustering which arises from our approach to the ME problem, and
some possible future directions.

2 Lz-weightings

In this section, we shall show that OLS tree weightings for a certain
distance matrix associated to a graph G can be related to a clique
property of G.

We first recall some definitions concerning trees. For a set X of
taxa, a rooted X-tree T = (V, E) is a graph-theoretical tree with (i)
leaf set X, (ii) no vertices of degree two and (iii) a specific vertex p
which is called the root of T and will not be regarded as part of the
leaf set. Given a rooted X-tree T = (V, E), we let S T be the partial
order on V induced by T, that is, u S 712, or u is below 12, if and only
if v is contained in the path from the root p to u. If in addition, we
have u 75 v, we write u < 712 and say that u is strictly below 12. The
lowest common ancestor of two vertices u and v, denoted by
LCA(U, V), is defined as the lowest vertex in T such that both u and v
are below it. Moreover, for each vertex u in T,
C(u) = {x E X : x 3 Tu} denotes the set of leaves below u. Finally,
a rooted X-tree with a particularly simple structure is the star X-tree
8X whose vertex set consists of the root p and leaf set X.

A weighting of a rooted X-tree T is a map co that assigns every
edge of T a non-negative real number. Given such a weighting,
Dw(u,v) denotes the length of the shortest path in T between any
two vertices u and 12. Moreover, such a weighting is called an inte-
ger equi—weighting on T if co : E —> 220 := {0,1,2,  ,} and
Dw(x, p) = Dw(y, p) for all x, y E X. Given a distance matrix D on a
set of taxa X and a rooted X-tree T, an LZ-weighting co for (T, D) is
an integer equi-weighting on T such that

A(T;Dw,D) :2 A(Dw,D) :2 How — DH; :
= Z 

{x,y}§X

is minimum over all integer equi-weightings on T. In this case, we
shall say that (T, co) is an Lz-representation of D.

Now, for a graph G = (X, E) with vertex set X, let DG be the
distance matrix on X such that for a pair of distinct elements x and
y in X, we have DG(x,y) = 2 if x, y are adjacent in G, and
DG(x, y) = 4 otherwise. The edge density of G, denoted by y(G), is

X
defined as / < 2 > and G is called a semi-clique if y(G) 2 1/2. In

the following we will also refer to subsets X’ g X as semi-cliques in
G if the subgraph of G induced by X’ is a semi-clique. We now pro-
vide a key relationship between the edge density of G and L2-
representations of DC.

LEMMA 2.1: Suppose that G is a graph with vertex set X, |X| 2 2,
and 8X is the star X-tree. Let co,- (i = 1, 2) be the weighting that as-
signs to each edge of 8X weight i. Then the following assertions

hold:

i. Ify(G) > 1/2, then col is the unique Lz-weighting for (8X, DG).

ii. Ify(G) < 1/2, then 602 is the unique LZ-weighting for (8X, DG).

iii. If y(G) = 1/2, then the LZ-weightings for (8X,DG) are col
and 602.

PROOF: For simplicity, put D :2 DG and let co,- (i E Zzo) be a
weighting function that assigns weight 7' to each edge in 8X. Noting
that each leaf is incident to the root, we know that an Lz-weighting
for (8X, D) must equal co,- for some i in Zzo because an Lz-weight-
ing is necessarily an integer equi-weighting. Because D(x, y) E {2, 4}
for x 7E yin X, a straightforward calculation leads to

min{A(Dw1,D),A(Dw,,D)} < A(le.,D)

for j E Zzo — {1, 2}. In other words, an Lz-weighting for (8X, D) is
either col or 602.

Let n and m be the number of vertices and edges in G, respect-
ively. Then we have

A(le,D) —A(Dw,,D) =2[n(n— 1) —4m]. (1)

If y(G) > 1/2, then we have  — 1)) > 1/2, and hence
4m > n(n — 1). Together with Equation (1), this implies
A(le,D) < A(Dw2,D), and hence col is the unique Lz-weighting
for (8X,D). This completes the proof of part (i); parts (ii) and (iii)
follow by similar arguments. III

For G as above, we now summarize how the property of being a
semi-clique is related to Lz-representations of DC.

LEMMA 2.2: Suppose that G is a graph with vertex set X, |X| 2 2,
and T is a rooted X-tree with root p. Let co be an Lz-weighting
for (T,DG), then Dw(x,y) 2 2 for all x,y E X, x 75 y. In addition, if
p = LCA(Y,z) for some y,z E X, then we have Dw(x, p) 32 for all
x E X, where equality holds if G is not a semi-clique.

PROOF: For simplicity, put D :2 DG and for a vertex u 75 p, let
p(u) be the parent of u, that is, the vertex on the path from u to p in
T that is adjacent to u. Since co is an Lz-weighting, we know that for
every pair of elements x,y E X, we have Dw(u,x) = Dw(u,y) for
every common ancestor u of x and y. In particular, we have
Dw(LCA(X,Y),X) = Dw(LCA(X,Y),Y) = Dw(x, Y) /2. Moreover, there
exists some integer la 2 0 such that Dw(p, x) 2 la for all x E X.

Note that we have kg 1 because otherwise we have Dw(x,y)
= 0 for all x,y E X, and hence A(T;Dw1,D) < A(T;Dw,D), where
co1 is the integer equi-weighting on T that assigns to each pendant
edge of T weight 1, and 0 to all other edges.

First, we shall show that Dw(x, y) 2 2 for all x, y E X. If not, then
consider a pair x1,x2 E X with Dw(x1,x2) < 2. Let u = LCA(X1,X2).
Then by noting that Dw(u,x1) = Dw(x1,x2)/2 < 1 we have
Dw(u, x1) = 0 and hence Dw(u, p) = k. Let u be the common ancestor
of x1 and x; such that Dw(v, p) 2 la and co({p(v),v}) > 0. Let 60’ be
the weighting function obtained from co by setting 60’ (e) = co(e) — 1 for

e = {p(v),v}, co’(e) = 1 for e = {p(x’),x’} with x’ 6 C(12), and co’(e)

= co(e) otherwise. Then 60’ is an integer equi-weighting with

A(T;Dw,D) — A(T;le,D) = Z D2(x,y) — (D(x,y) — 2)2 > 0,
{x,y}§C(v)7x#y

contradicting that co is an Lz-weighting for (T, D).

Now assume that p = LCA(X1,X2) for some x1,x2 E X. It remains
to show that la 3 2, that is, Dw(x,p) S 2 for all x E X. If not,
then we have [£23. Let {u1,  ,ut} be the set of vertices in T
such that Dw(p,p(u,-)) = 0 and Dw(p,u,-) > 0 for 1 S is t.
Then {C (u1), ... ,C(ut)} is a partition of X. Let 60’ be the integer equi-
weighting obtained from co by setting 60’ (e) = co(e) — 1 for e{p(u,—), u,-}
with 1 S is t, and 60’ (e) = co(e) otherwise.

Then for x E C(ui) and x’ E C(ui) with i = i, we have

D(x,x’) 343M — 2 = Dw(x,x') — 2 = Dwz(x,x’)
andhence

(Dw(x, x’) — D(x,x’))2 — (DwI(x,x’) — D(x,x’))2
= (Dwz(x,x’) + 2 — D(x,x’))2 — (Day (x, x’) — D(x,x’))2
= 4(Dw(x,x’) — D(x,x’) + 1) 24.

Therefore, in view of t 2 2, we have

A(T;Dw,D) — A(T;D,,,,D) 24 Z |C(u,-)| >< |C(u,-)| > 0,

1943:

contradicting that co is an Lz-weighting for (T, D).

Finally, when G is not a semi-clique, a proof similar to that of
Lemma 2.1 shows k=2, and hence completes the proof of the
lemma. El

3 ME is NP-complete

In the last section, we saw how Lz-weightings were related to semi-
cliques. We now use this information to relate semi-clique decompos-
itions of graphs to the ME problem, which will also allow us to show
that this latter problem is NP-complete.

We begin by presenting a problem that is closely related to the
ME-problem. Given a distance matrix D on X, a rooted X-tree T
and an Lz-weighting co for (T, D), we let co(T) denote the sum of
the edge-weights of T.

Problem Ultra-metric ME (UME(D, m))

Instance: A distance matrix D on a ﬁnite set X and an integer m.

Question: Does there exist an Lz-representation (T, co) of D such
that co(T) S m?

Now, let G be a graph with vertex set X. We call a partition P of
X a semi-clique decomposition of G if every set in P is a semi-clique
in G. We now relate this concept to the problem of finding a solu-
tion to the UME problem.

Proposition 3.1: Let G be a graph with vertex set X and la 2 1 an
integer. Then there exists a semi-clique decomposition of G with
size at most la if and only if there exists an Lz-representation (T, co)
of DG with co(T) S |X| + k.

Proof: Put D :2 DG and n =  In addition, let a),-  E 220) be
the weighting function that assigns weight 7' to each edge in a rooted
X-tree. To simplify the proof it will be convenient to allow vertices
of degree two in a rooted X-tree.

“=>” Let {X1, X2, . . . ,Xk} be a semi-clique decomposition of G
whose size is minimum over all semi-clique decompositions of G.
If k = 1, then consider the star tree 8X. Since G is a semi-clique, by
Lemma 2.1 we know that col is an Lz-weighting for (8X,D) and,
clearly, w1(SX) = n, as required.

So, assume la > 1. Then G is not a semi-clique. For each 1 S is la,
let T ,- := 839 be the X,--tree obtained from 8X, by adding a new node
adjacent to the root of 8X1, and designating this new node as the
root of 839. Note that, if |X,-| = 1, then 8X, contains one edge while
839 contains two edges. Considering the X-tree T obtained by iden-
tifying the roots of all T ,- as the root of T, each tree T ,- can be re-
garded as a subtree of T. Moreover, since col (T) = |X| + la, it
suffices to show that col is an Lz-weighting for (T, D). To this end,
consider an arbitrary Lz-weighting co for (T ,D). Since G is not a
semi-clique and la > 1 implies that p is the lowest common ancestor
of a pair of elements of X, by Lemma 2.2 we have Dw(p,x) = 2 for
all x E X, as well as Dw(x, y) 2 2 for x = y. Therefore, to establish
that col is an Lz-weighting for (T ,D), it remains to show, for all i
with |X,-| 2 2, that co(e) = 1 for all edges e in T ,-. Indeed, if this does
not hold for some iwith |X,-| 2 2, then by Dw(x, p) = 2 and Dw(x, y)
2 2 for x = yin X,- we must have co(e) = 2 for all pendant edges e in
T ,- and co(e) = 0 for all other edges. Let 60’ be the weighting function
on the edges of T defined as 60’ (e) = 1 for edges e in T ,- and 60’ (e)
= co(e) otherwise. Since X,- is a semi-clique in G, an argument simi-
lar to the one used in the proof of Lemma 2.1 either yields A(Dw: , D)
< A(Dw, D), contradicting that co is an Lz-weighting, or
A(le, D) = A(Dw, D), as required.

“<2” Let la be the minimum positive number such that there
exists a rooted X-tree T = (V, E) and an Lz-weighting co for (T, D)
with co(T) S |X| + k. Without loss of generality, we may assume
that la < |X| (as otherwise the conclusion clearly holds) and that the
root p of T is the lowest common ancestor of two elements in X (as
the single edge incident to a root of degree one can always be con-
tracted without changing the distance Dw(x, y) for any x, y E X). In
addition, we may assume that co(e) > 0 for all edges e E E (indeed,
by Lemma 2.2 we can assume co(e) > 0 for all pendant edges e of T
and an interior edge with weight 0 can simply be contracted) and
may further assume that co 2 col (as an edge with weight m > 1 can
be replaced by m edges with weight 1).

Now, if k = 1 it follows immediately from the assumptions above
that T 2 8X and, therefore, in view of Lemma 2.1 we can conclude
that G is a semi-clique, as required.

So assume 1 < k <  Then we can further assume that G is
not a semi-clique, as otherwise the result clearly holds. Therefore,
by Lemma 2.2, we have le (x, p) = 2 for some (and hence all)
x E X. This implies that, besides |X| pendant edges, T contains la
edges {e1, . . . ,ek} that are adjacent to p.

For 1 S i 3 la, let X,- be the set of elements x in X such that the
path between p and x contains e,- and let E,- be the set of pendant
edges incident to e,-. It remains to show that, for 1 Si 3 la, X,- is a
semi-clique in G. Indeed, if this were not the case for some i,
then clearly |X,-| 2 2. Let 60’ be the weighting function obtained from
col by setting 60’ (e) = 0 for e=e,~, 60’ (e) = 2 for e E E), and 60’ (e)
= w1(e) otherwise. Since X,- is not a semi-clique, an argument simi-
lar to the proof of Lemma 2.1 leads to the contradiction
A(Dw/,D) < A(le,D). I:

By the main result of Kaya et al. (2013) it follows that the fol-
lowing problem is NP-complete.

ME problem is hard

521

 

Question: Does there exist a semi-clique decomposition P of G such
that |P| g k?

Using this fact, we immediately obtain the following corollary to
Proposition 3.1.

Corollary 3.2: The problem UME(D, m) is NP-complete, even when
the non-diagonal entries of the distance matrix D are all in {2, 4}. III

Now we return to the ME problem mentioned in Section 1. It
refers to unrooted X-trees, that is, we drop the condition of having a
distinguished root vertex and, as a consequence, when referring to
weightings we also drop the condition that all leaves have the same
distance from the root. To avoid any confusion as to whether the
latter condition applies or not we will use the term unrooted when
referring to weightings and Lz-representations for which it does not
apply. Formally, the ME problem is stated as below.

Problem ME (ME(D, m))

Instance: A distance matrix D on a ﬁnite set X and an integer m.

Question: Does there exist an unrooted Lz-representation (T, co) of
D such that co(T) S m?

Now, using Corollary 3.2 and the following transformation that
was presented by Day (1987) we show that the ME problem is NP-
complete. Given a distance matrix D on X with |X| = n and two in-
tegers m and p, let Y := {y1,  ,ym} be a set disjoint from X and
let D :2 fmp (D) be the distance matrix on X U Y defined as D(x,, x,-)
= D(x,-,xi) for x,-,x,- E X, D(x,y) = p for x E X,y E Y, and D(y,,y,—)
= 2 for y,- = y,- in Y. The NP-completeness of ME follows from the
next result, whose rather technical proof is presented in the
Supplementary appendix.

Proposition 3.3: Suppose |X| = n 2 4. Suppose that D is a distance
matrix on X with D(x,x’) 6 {2,4} for x = x’ in X. Let p 2 n3, m
= p3 and la 2 1. Then D has an Lz-representation (T, co) with co(T) g
n + k if and only if fmp (D) has an unrooted Lz-representation (T, w)
withw(T)§n+/e+m+ (p—3).

By Proposition 3.3 and Corollary 3.2 we obtain the main result
of thisarticle.

Theorem 3.4: The problem ME(D, m) is NP-complete even when
the non-diagonal entries of the distance matrix D take on only three
values. III

It would be interesting to see whether the ME problem is hard
for the more general case where the edge weights can be set to ra-
tional numbers. Note that the hardness of the BME problem men-
tioned in Section 1 includes the case of rational weight (Fiorini and
Joret, 2012). On the other hand, Theorem 3.4 does not imply that
the rational version of the ME-problem (RME) is hard, and there
are many optimization problems which can be solved efficiently
once the restriction that the solution must be integral is removed,
such as the well-known linear programming problem (cf. Schrijver,

(a) p (b

$1 332 $3 1134 $5 $6 $7 1138 .739

boxes

1986). A starting point to explore the complexity of RME could

be the observation that the semi-clique decomposition problem is a
l
2’
which the aim is to decompose a graph G into a minimum number

special case of the y-clique decomposition problem for y = in

of y-cliques, where y is a real number with 0 S y S 1, and a y-clique
C
in G is a subset C of V having at least )2 < '2' ) edges in G with both

endpoints in C (cf. Guo et al., 2011; Pattillo et al., 2013). In add-
ition, Kaya et al. (2013) showed that the y-clique decomposition
problem is NP-complete. However, to date we have not been able to
use this fact to prove that the RME problem is also NP-complete.

4 Discussion

To prove that the ME problem is NP-complete, we first showed that
the UME problem is NP-complete by relating it to the semi-clique
decomposition problem. Interestingly, this is a special example of a
more general link between tree inference and graph clustering prob-
lems. In particular, we can link the following two types of problem
for a set X:

i. Given a distance matrix D on X and a tree scoring function CD
on the set 'Il'X of all rooted X-trees, ﬁnd a tree that optimizes 013.

ii. Given a graph G with vertex set X and a cluster scoring function
KG : [PX —> IR that assigns to each partition in the set [PX of all
partitions of X a real number Kg, ﬁnd a partition of X that opti-
mizes Kg.

More specifically, this correspondence is obtained by restricting any
given tree inference problem to the set of rooted trees in 'Il'X where
every leaf is adjacent to a vertex that is adjacent to the root (the tree
in Fig. 1a, for example, has this structure), to edge weightings that
assign to every edge weight 1 and to distance matrices that have
only off-diagonal entries that are 2 or 4. In this restricted type of
rooted tree, every vertex u adjacent to the root induces a cluster of
elements in X (namely the leaves that are adjacent to u) and, clearly,
for every partition P of X there exists a unique such tree T p that in-
duces precisely the clusters in P. Thus, given any graph G with ver-
tex set X and the distance matrix D 2 DC on X which is induced by
G, we obtain the cluster scoring function KG from the scoring func-
tion (ID by putting KG (P) 2 0]) (T p).

To give another example of this correspondence, consider the Ll-fit
problem (see, e.g. Day, 1987; Farach et al., 1995). In this problem,
given a distance matrix D the aim is to find a rooted X-tree T
which minimizes the score 0]) (T) which is equal to the minimum of
Z |D(x, y) — Dw(x, y)| taken over all weightings co of T. For this ex-
x,y€X
ample, the corresponding graph clustering problem is known as the
correlation clustering problem (Bansal et al., 2004) where the cluster
scoring function KG assigns, for a given graph G with vertex set
X, to any partition P in 73X the number of 2-element subsets (i.e. edges)

e = {u, v} of X that violate P, that is, either e is an edge of G but u and
12 do not lie in the same cluster in P or e is not an edge of G but u and 12
both lie in the same cluster of P. For the partition P = {C1, C2, C3} of
the graph G in Figure 1b, for example, this cluster scoring function
yields a score of 4. It is not hard to check that the Ll-fit of the tree in
Figure 1a for the distance matrix DG derived from the graph G is 4
too. Note that minimizing the cluster scoring function corresponding
to the Ll-fit is equivalent to computing the minimum number of edge
deletions and insertions that suffice to transform G into a disjoint
union of complete graphs. When adopting this latter view, correlation
clustering is usually referred to as cluster editing (see, e.g. Bocker et al.,
2011)

It would be interesting to explore which tree inference problems
are related in a similar way to other graph clustering problems, and
conversely. This could yield useful new insights into these inference
problems, and possibly new algorithms for their solution or
approximation.

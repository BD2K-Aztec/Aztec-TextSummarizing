ABSTRACT

Summary: Dynamics governing the function of biomolecule is usually
described as exchange processes and can be monitored at atomic
resolution with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation disper-
sion data. Here, we present a new tool for the analysis of CPMG
relaxation dispersion profiles (ShereKhan). The web interface to
ShereKhan provides a user-friendly environment for the analysis.
Availability: A stable version of ShereKhan, the web application and
documentation are available at http://sherekhan.bionmr.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

Functions of biomolecules are governed by their dynamics of
conformational interconversions sometimes induced by binding
of a second partner. The kinetics of these processes need to be
explored. Normally, kinetics of the mentioned processes can
be described with exchange processes. For example, proteins
can be in conformational equilibrium, which may be character-
ized by two different conformations of the same molecule, or in
chemical equilibrium, which may represent the bound and un-
bound state of molecules to a binding partner. The environments
of the nuclei may differ in each state and thus their nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) parameters (e.g. chemical shifts,
scalar or dipolar couplings and relaxation) may also be different.
We focus here on processes, in which at least one of the magnet-
ically active nuclei exchanges between these states by either
chemical exchange or conformational exchange.

The study of chemical exchange processes by NMR is already
well established (Mittermaier and Kay, 2006; Wang et al., 2001).
Depending on the time scale at which the exchange process
occurs, various NMR techniques such as line shape analysis,
measurements of the spin-spin or spin-lattice relaxation rates,
the off-resonance saturation method and pulse spin-echo tech-
niques such as the Carr—Purcell—Meibcom—Gill (CPMG) experi-
ment can be applied. In particular, the exchange processes
occurring within the micro- to millisecond time window can be
detected by the NMR relaxation dispersion experiments by using
CPMG or off-resonance irradiation approaches. The CPMG

experiment can provide thermodynamic (relative populations
of the species), kinetic (rates of exchange) and structural infor-
mation (in form of chemical shifts) at atomic. Although CPMG
relaxation dispersion experiments are in general well-established,
their analysis is not a straightforward process. Currently existing
programs are available on request from the authors (e. g.
CPMGFit), demand a number of software libraries (Bieri and
Gooley, 2011), which are often not commonly available on per-
sonal computers and result in compatibility problems or require
proprietary software (Kleckner and Foster, 2012). Therefore, we
developed ShereKhan, which is accessible through a web inter-
face allowing a user-friendly selection of residues and suggesting
models for the calculation of kinetic parameters like the relative
populations of the species, the exchange rate and chemical shift
information from the CPMG relaxation dispersion data.
ShereKhan assumes a global two-state exchange process to fit
the data with models for the slow or fast exchange.

2 FEATURES

The ShereKhan web application provides an easy way to calcu-
late exchange parameters (rates, relative populations and their
structural information) of molecules (Fig. l). The workﬂow has
been designed to guide the user through the process from
uploading data to the calculation of the exchange rates and
populations of the states. The input file for a dataset is a
simple tab-delimited text file containing R2 relaxation rate
values including error estimates at various vCpMG values for
each residue (Fig. 1A), which can also be calculated in the pro-
gram with peak intensities from the two point sampling scheme
(Mulder et al., 2001). In addition, it must be specified with which
resonance frequency and constant-time relaxation delay T cp the
data have been recorded. The residues must not be consecutive
but should be numbered sequentially for calculating the chemical
shift difference plot. ShereKhan accepts any number of datasets,
e.g. data recorded at a pair or multiple field strengths. If the
experimental datasets include relaxation dispersion data mea-
sured at two (or more) different magnetic fields, ShereKhan sug-
gests the exchange regime (slow or fast exchange regime) for each
given residue to facilitate the selection of an appropriate model
(Millet et al., 2000). Subsequently, speciﬁc sets of residues (e.g.
with a certain exchange regime) or any combination of residues
can be selected. In this way, residues containing ambiguous data
can be deselected before starting the calculations. If high power

relaxation rate values are included (Ban et al., 2012), the distinc-
tion between the ﬁtting models is not necessary any more.

2.1 Applying different exchange regimes

In the current implementation, the user can choose between two
exchange regimes (on the NMR time scale), slow or fast ex-
change (Fig. 1B). After assigning the regime, the user can
select a ﬁtting model, namely, the Carver—Richards model
(Carver and Richards, 1972; Davis et al., 1994) or the Luz—
Meiboom model (Luz and Meiboom, 1963) for the slow or the
fast exchange regimes, respectively. Alternatively, users can use
the Bloch-McConnell equation (McConnell, 1958), which works
for both regimes. Chemical shift variances and intrinsic R2 re-
laxation rates [be they ﬁt parameters or available from high-
power Rlp experiment (Ban et al., 2012)] are residue speciﬁc,
but kinetic parameters can be ﬁtted globally. Starting values
for the parameters of the model can either be suggested by
ShereKhan or be speciﬁed by the user.

2.2 Displaying and exporting results

For residues in the fast exchange regime, only the exchange rates
and their population-weighted chemical shift differences can be
extracted from the ﬁtting of NMR relaxation dispersion data,
whereas for residues in the slow exchange regime, all parameters
such as rate constants, populations and chemical shift differences
can be obtained from the ﬁtting. Fits of the model to the data
can be browsed interactively or downloaded in various graphics
formats.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

ShereKhan consists of a command-line program and a WWW-
based tool, accessible through any modern web browser. The
program was written in Python supplemented with the scipy
(http://www.scipy.org) and matplotlib libraries (http://matplo
tlib.sourceforge.net) and the J SON parser. The leastsq ﬁtting
routine with the default convergence criteria was used. The
web application framework is Ruby on Rails (http://rubyon
rails.org). To present the user with a feature-rich interface,
the site makes extensive use of modern Web 2.0 techniques like
Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) using jQuery

(http://jquery.com) and FancyBox (http://fancybox.net).
Interactive graphs are drawn with the graphical toolkit
Protovis [http://protovis.org; (Bostock and Heer, 2009)]. User-
uploaded data are stored temporary on the server and deleted
when leaving the application.

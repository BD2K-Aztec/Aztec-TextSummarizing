ABSTRACT

Motivation: Ancient DNA (aDNA) molecules in fossilized bones and
teeth, coprolites, sediments, mummified specimens and museum col-
lections represent fantastic sources of information for evolutionary
biologists, revealing the agents of past epidemics and the dynamics
of past populations. However, the analysis of aDNA generally faces
two major issues. Firstly, sequences consist of a mixture of endogen-
ous and various exogenous backgrounds, mostly microbial. Secondly,
high nucleotide misincorporation rates can be observed as a result of
severe post-mortem DNA damage. Such misincorporation patterns
are instrumental to authenticate ancient sequences versus modern
contaminants. We recently developed the user-friendly mapDamage
package that identifies such patterns from next-generation sequen-
cing (NGS) sequence datasets. The absence of formal statistical mod-
eling of the DNA damage process, however, precluded rigorous
quantitative comparisons across samples.

Results: Here, we describe mapDamage 2.0 that extends the original
features of mapDamage by incorporating a statistical model of DNA
damage. Assuming that damage events depend only on sequencing
position and post-mortem deamination, our Bayesian statistical frame-
work provides estimates of four key features of aDNA molecules: the
average length of overhangs (A), nick frequency (v) and cytosine de-
amination rates in both double-stranded regions (8d) and overhangs (65).
Our model enables rescaling base quality scores according to their
probability of being damaged. mapDamage 2.0 handles NGS datasets
with ease and is compatible with a wide range of DNA library protocols.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA in historical samples is subject to a plethora of environ-
mental conditions and degradation reactions (Sawyer et al.,
2012). Abasic sites, strand breaks, interstrand cross-links and a

wide diversity of atypic nucleotidic bases are formed following
oxidative and hydrolytic degradation (Lindahl, 1993; Paabo
et al., 2004), even in the most favorable preservation conditions.

Post-mortem DNA damage limits our ability to access ancient
DNA (aDNA) sequences and increases the risk of exogenous
modern contamination, as undamaged DNA molecules are
more prone to enzymatic manipulation. Nucleotide misincor-
poration patterns, which are mostly driven by deaminated
forms of cytosines (uracils), have been suggested as a powerful
approach to authenticate aDNA sequences generated on next-
generation sequencing (NGS) platforms (Briggs et al., 2007) and
motivated the creation of the mapDamage package (Ginolhac
et al., 2011). Such patterns could vary according to the speciﬁc
molecular approach used for constructing (Meyer et al., 2012)
and/or amplifying (Ginolhac et al., 2011) second-generation
DNA libraries. For instance, for one of the most popular proto-
cols (Meyer and Kircher, 2010), we observe inﬂated cytosine
deamination rates at 5’-overhangs, an increase in C —> T substi-
tution rates toward sequencing starts and complementary in-
crease in G —> A rates toward reads ends (Briggs et al., 2007).
Conversely, a novel procedure targeting single-stranded tem-
plates has shown elevated C —> T substitution rates at both
ends (Meyer et al., 2012).

Statistical modeling of such patterns has been developed by
Briggs et al., 2007 with strand break, overhangs and cytosine
deamination as key factors. Using read alignment to reference
genomes and maximum likelihood optimization, this approach
has delivered the first quantitative estimates of damage param-
eters. However, the likelihood framework originally implemented
scales poorly with the size of NGS datasets, and extensive run-
ning times have prevented common usage. Here, we present an
extension of mapDamage, which implements a fast approxima-
tion of the DNA damage model using a Bayesian framework.
mapDamage 2.0 opens the possibility of comparing DNA
damage levels across temporal and environmental gradients.
Posterior distributions of damage parameters also enable pena-
lizing the quality score of likely damaged bases, reducing noise in
downstream single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling
procedures.

2 APPROACH

Here we build on the DNA damage model described in Briggs
et al., 2007. We make the simplifying assumption that mutations

and post-mortem DNA damage are independent within a frag-
ment, with occurrences depending only on the relative position
from the sequence ends.

3 METHODS

The general idea is to mutate bases following an Hasegawa, Kishino and
Yano (HKY) transition matrix (Hasegawa et al., 1985) and then inde-
pendently add post-mortem damage on top of mutated bases. In this
framework, we have multinomial distributions describing the position-
speciﬁc substitutions for any given base (S AJ, Sci, Sq,- and STJ).

SAJ ~ Mul(DA, (1,0, 0, 0) - @(u, p) - Pdam(8d,63,}t, v, i))

G) is the HKY transition matrix, and Pdam is deﬁned as the DNA damage
transition matrix. We assume post-mortem cytosine deamination is the
main driver of nucleotide misincorporations in agreement with experi-
mental evidence (Briggs et al., 2007), providing

Where the base-speciﬁc damage probabilities are deﬁned as

Pga(5d,5s,}», V, i) = (1 — Vi)0~i5s + 5d(1 — AD)

The motivation for the base-speciﬁc damage probabilities pdam is best
explained by the Markov chain in Figure 1 where the ﬁrst jump decides if
the position is before or after a nick; then a C —> T substitution could be
observed following deamination in overhang or double-stranded DNA
regions. A similar Markov chain could be drawn for G —> A substitu-
tions (Supplementary Section 1).

For rescaling base quality scores, we assume that C —> T and G —> A
substitutions either originate from true biological differences or from
damage driven misincorporations. We can derive an estimate for the
probability that a C —> T (similar for G —> A) misincorporation at pos-
ition i along the reads is due to damage using

4 DISCUSSION

We applied mapDamage2.0 on a series of aDNA sequence data-
sets generated from a range of periods, source materials and
environments (Supplementary Section 3). Posterior predictive
intervals and empirical frequencies are in general agreement, as
shown for the ancient plague dataset (Supplementary Table S2
and Supplementary Figs S4—S9) (Schuenemann et al., 2011),
demonstrating the adequacy of our method. We observed a
ratio of cytosine deamination rates for double— and single-
stranded regions orders of magnitude greater than estimates
based on in vitro experiments in aqueous solution (0.007 in
Lindahl, 1993 versus 0026—0070 for Schuenemann et al., 2011
in Supplementary Table S1). This suggests that tissue- and
sample-speciﬁc micro-environmental characteristics drive differ-
ent DNA damage kinetics in situ. We also found a signiﬁcant
rank correlation between the posterior mean for single-stranded
cytosine deamination and sample age (Supplementary Table S3)
in agreement with Sawyer et al., 2012. However, remains of simi-
lar age and location showed diverse parameter estimates
(Supplementary Table S2), suggesting a prominent role of
micro-environmental characteristics over age in diagenesis.

We also applied our quality rescaling scheme to the sequence
data of an Australian Aboriginal individual who died in 1920s
(Rasmussen et al., 2011). This increased the overlap of genotype
calls to dbSNP v137, suggesting that lower false-positive SNP
calls were achieved (Supplementary Table S4).

5 CONCLUSION

We have developed a computational method for inferring
aDNA damage parameters from NGS sequence datasets, with
minimal changes to the DNA damage model presented by Briggs
et al., 2007. Our model is compatible with the speciﬁcities of
different sequencing and library building protocols. We believe
that downscaling quality scores of likely damaged bases is the
ﬁrst from a long list of possible applications for damage param-
eter posterior distributions, limiting the impact of nucleotide
misincorporations in downstream sequence analyses. The know-
ledge of such distributions could also be instrumental for im-
proving mapping procedures to reference genomes (Schubert
et al., 2012).

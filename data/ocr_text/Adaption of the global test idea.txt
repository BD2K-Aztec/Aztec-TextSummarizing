ABSTRACT

Motivation: Global test procedures are frequently used in gene ex-
pression analysis to study the relationship between a functional subset
of RNA transcripts and an experimental group factor. However, these
procedures have been rarely used for the analysis of high-throughput
data from other sources, such as proteome expression data. The main
difficulties in transferring global test procedures from genomics to
proteomics data are the more complicated way of obtaining functional
annotations and the handling of missing values in some types of prote-
omics data.

Results: We propose a simple mixed linear model in combination with
a permutation procedure and missing values imputation to conduct
global tests in proteomics experiments. This new approach is moti-
vated by protein expression data obtained by means of 2-D gel elec-
trophoresis within a mouse experiment of our current research.
A simulation study yielded that power and testing level of the mixed
model alone can be affected by missing values in the dataset.
Imputation of missing values was able to correct for a bias in some
simulation settings. Our new approach provides the possibility to rank
Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with protein sets. It is also
helpful in the case in which a specific protein is represented by mul-
tiple spots on a 2-D gel by considering these spots also as a protein
set. Analysis of our data points at correlations between the deficiency
of the protein ‘calreticulin’ and protein sets related to biological pro-
cesses in the heart muscle.

Availability and implementation: Our proposed approach is
included in the R-package ‘RepeatedHighDim’, which already con-
tains a global test procedure for gene expression data. The package
can be retrieved from http://cran.r-project.org/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Can certain molecular functions, cellular components or biolo-
gical processes be related to the levels of the grouping factor of a
study or an experiment? This question is frequently studied in the
analysis of expression data from high-throughput experiments
(e.g. with DNA microarrays). To answer this question, expression
levels of those features that are connected to a particular molecu-
lar function can be compared between the different study groups.
With this approach, Grond-Ginsbach et al. (2008), for example,

detected a relation between a set of genes involved in the molecu-
lar mechanisms of inﬂammation and acute ischemic stroke. In
another study, Groene et al. (2006) detected a relation between
genes involved in the p53 pathway and the Union for
International Cancer Control (UICC) stages of colorectal
cancer. Statistically, the previously mentioned questions can be
analyzed by means of global test procedures. In contrast to meth-
ods that analyze the expression levels of all features from a high-
throughput experiment individually (Smyth, 2004), a global test
focuses on sets of features that are all involved in the same bio-
logical function or cellular pathway. Although a number of global
test approaches for the analysis of functional gene sets have been
published (Goeman et al., 2004; Jung et al., 2011; Mansmann and
Meister, 2005), the idea was rarely considered in protein expres-
sion data from proteomics experiments. In such experiments, pro-
tein expression is usually measured in a high-throughput manner
by either mass spectrometry (MS) (Aebersold and Mann, 2003) or
2-D gel electrophoresis (2-DE) (Klose and Kobalz, 1995). For
protein expression data measured by MS, a global test approach
based on Hotelling’s TZ-statistic to relate speciﬁc phenotypes to
functionally related sets of proteins was proposed by Chen et al.
(2011). Besides, an approach for testing protein set enrichment in
MS experiments was presented (Louie et al., 2010).

In this article, we present a new approach for global testing of
functional protein sets in the case where expression levels are
measured by 2-DE. Although the MS-based protein expression
data referred to by Chen et al. (2011) present as a complete
(d x n)-matrix, i.e. without missing values, up to 30% of entries
may be empty in the matrix of 2-DE-based expression data (Jung
et al., 2006). However, missing values are also not atypical in
MS-based data because of missing peaks in the mass spectra
(Kall and Vitek, 2011; KarpieVitch et al., 2012; Smith et al.,
2006). Here, d denotes the number of proteins and n the
sample size. Missing values in protein expression data from
2-DE are because features on a 2-D gel are not placed on an
ordered grid like the probe sets on a DNA microarray where the
location of each particular feature is known. In contrast, spots of
labeled proteins appear at more or less different locations on 2-D
gels, and spot matching algorithms must be used to bring the
information of the experimental replications in line 0611 and
Zhu, 2009). For a number of protein spots the matching fails,
and missing values ‘occur’.

Therefore, a global test procedure for proteomics data from
2-DE has to deal with two main difﬁculties. On the one hand,
there is an issue of missing values, and on the other hand, it is
more complicated to get functional annotations for the protein

spots, as these spots must ﬁrst be removed from the gel and the
underlying protein must be identiﬁed by MS (Koenig et al.,
2008)—unlike DNA microarray data, where the identity of a
probe set is given directly. Not speciﬁc for 2-DE data, the prob-
lem for all high-throughput data is that the number d of features
in a functional set can be much larger than that of the sample size
n. The new approach we present here is based on a simple mixed
linear model, which is able to handle missing values, in combin-
ation with a permutation algorithm to account for the high
dimensionality. We evaluate this approach when being applied
on the incomplete data on the one hand and on data ﬁlled up by
a missing value imputation procedure proposed by Troyanskaya
et al. (2001) on the other hand.

Our article is structured as follows. We ﬁrst detail the mixed
linear model, the permutation procedure and the missing value
imputation algorithm, followed by a description of our prote-
omics experiment. Next, we evaluate the methods in a simulation
study and apply them to the data example. Finally, we provide a
discussion of the results and give some conclusions.

2 METHODS AND EXAMPLE DATA

2.1 Simple mixed linear model

Our approach is based on a simple mixed linear model of the
following form:

Yijk = M+Olj+l3k +(Ol/3)jk+ Ui+8ijka (1)

where Yijk represents the expression level of protein k in group j
and individual 1' after normalization and variance stabilization.
The model is composed of an overall mean ,u, the effect 05,- of
group j (j = 1, 2), the effect ,Bk of protein k (k = 1, . . . , d) and a
(group x protein)-interaction (05,6)J-k. In addition, the model con-
tains a random effect U,- ~ N(0, 0]) for the ith individual
(i = 1, . . . ,n) and an overall random error eijk ~ Nd(0, Zj).
Classically, the aforementioned model would assume that there
are less proteins than individuals, i.e. d<n.

To test the hypothesis that the mean expression proﬁle of the d
proteins is the same in both groups, one would test the null
hypothesis of no interaction effect, i.e. H0 : (aﬁ)j = 0 for all j,
k. For example, this hypothesis can be tested by means of like-
lihood ratio tests (Faraway, 2006).

To ensure that the data meet the linearity assumption of the
model raw 2-DE data should be pre-processed by normalization
and transformed by some variance stabilizing function such as
the logarithm or the arsinh (Huber et al., 2002; Kreil et al., 2006).

2.2 Permutation procedure

Under unequal covariance matrices for the random errors, i.e. if
Z1 75 Z2, or if sample sizes are unbalanced, the application of
model (1) can fail to maintain the pre-speciﬁed level of signiﬁ-
cance, particularly if the number d of proteins is much larger
than that of the samples size n, as typical for high-throughput
data. As a consequence, the true testing level would often become
too much liberal yielding to many false-positive test results.
Therefore, we embed this model into a permutation procedure
to correct for this bias. The working principle of the permutation
procedure is as follows. Assume, the test of H0 on the un-
permuted data yields the P-Value pdam, whereas the tests on B

permuted datasets yield the P-Values pb (b = 1, . . . ,B). The per-
mutation P-Value is then given by ppm, 2 #{pb < pdam} / B (Efron
and Tibshirani, 1993).

2.3 Missing values imputation

As incomplete datasets are typical in gel-based proteomics experi-
ments, a loss of power is to be expected for the aforementioned
testing procedures. Therefore, we propose an approach of com-
bining the mixed model not only with a permutation procedure
but also with a missing values imputation algorithm. For that
purpose we use an existing algorithm based on the idea of nearest
neighbors. This algorithm determines neighbors of the protein
with the missing value for subject 1' in the sense of correlated
expression levels among all other individuals. The missing value
is then determined, for example, by the mean expression levels in
subject 1' from the neighboring proteins. This approach has ori-
ginally been proposed for missing values imputation of DNA
microarray data (Troyanskaya et al., 2001) and has already
been applied to gel-based proteomics data (Jung et al., 2006).

2.4 Case study: proteomics data from 2-DE

As a case example we studied protein expression data from
2-DE, generated as part of our current proteomics research.
Speciﬁcally, we focus on the role of the protein ‘calreticulin’ in
the heart muscle. To this end, we compared three calreticulin
heterozygote (Calr+/—) and three wild-type (WT) littermate
mice in identical C57BL/6J genetic background. Animals were
obtained from Prof. Marek Michalak, University of Alberta,
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Mice were bred under speciﬁc
pathogen-free housing conditions and genotyped as previously
described in Michalak et al. (1999). All experimental procedures
were performed according to the German animal care and ethics
legislation and were approved by the local government authori-
ties at the University Medical Centre G6tttingen.

Immediately after cervical dislocation, the freshly excised
hearts from adult mice (WT, Calr+/—) were quickly removed,
cleaned, washed in sterile saline solution and weighed. Mice
hearts were homogenized in buffer containing 50-mmol/l Tris-
HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 100-mmol/L NaCl and protease
inhibitors. After incubation for 30 min at 4 OC, heart tissue hom-
ogenates were centrifuged two times at 14000 rpm for 30min,
and the supernatant was collected. To reduce the salt contamin-
ation and to enrich the proteins, protein precipitation was
performed. Whole tissue homogenate was precipitated using
methanol-chloroform.

Next, processed samples were analyzed by means of 2-DE. In
total, six gels were run where three of them were prepared with
WT samples and the other three with Calr+/— samples. After
scanning and image analysis (using the software Delta2D, ver-
sion 4, Decodon), 103 matched gel spots were identiﬁed by MS
and assigned a UniProt accession number (UniProt Consortium,
2007). Probably because of alternative splicing and post-
translational modiﬁcations, some of the spots carried the same
protein so that 63 proteins could be related to the 103 spots. In
detail, 37 proteins were represented by only 1 spot, 16 by 2 spots,
8 by 3 spots, 1 (‘ATP synthase subunit beta’) by 4 spots and 1
(‘electron transfer ﬁavoprotein subunit alpha’) by 6 spots.

Note: Most of the functional terms were related to only small number of gel spots.
For example, Each 136 biological processes were related to only one gel spot, while
the largest set was given by a cellular component that was related to 38 gel spots.

Via the accession number, the identiﬁed spots could further be
linked to 264 different biological processes, 87 different cellular
components and 99 different molecular functions. The most fre-
quent biological process ‘transport’ was related to 30 gel spots;
the second frequent one ‘glycosis’ was related to 12 gel spots.
Concerning cellular components, the most frequent component
‘mitochondrion’ was related to 38 gel spots. The most frequent
molecular function ‘ATP binding’ was related to 23 gel spots.
The complete distribution of functional set sizes is given in
Table 1.

Approximately 3% of values were missing in the (103 x 3)-
data matrix of the untreated samples, and ~15% were missing
in the matrix of the treated samples.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Simulation studies

To study the effect of missing values on the testing level and the
power of the proposed global test approach, we performed two
different series of simulation studies. In the ﬁrst one, we simu-
lated expression data with certain types of arranged covariance
matrix (autoregressive or unstructured scenarios Al—A4), and we
used a shrinkage covariance estimate (Schafer and Strimmer,
2005) from the example data in the second one (scenarios B1—
B6). The shrinkage method allows the estimation of a covariance
matrix in the case of high-dimensional data. Besides, we varied,
in both simulation studies, the proportion of missing values, the
size a’ of the protein sets and the sample sizes per group.
Expression levels were drawn from the multivariate normal
distribution.

The off-diagonal entries of the autoregressive covariance
matrices were calculated by 01-17 = ,oLHVJ (i, i’ = 1, ...,a’) with
,0 = 0.5 and those of the unstructured covariance matrices were
drawn from the standard normal distribution. In both cases, the
diagonal elements were increased evenly from 1 to 2 to have
unequal variances for the proteins.

In the case of the arranged covariance matrices, log-fold
changes were drawn from normal distributions N(0, 8), where 8
started with 0 and was increased until a power of 1 was reached
in each simulation scenario. In the simulations with shrinkage

covariance matrices, the log-fold changes were all zero when
simulating the null hypothesis and were drawn from the fold
change distribution of the real data example when simulating
global effects. For smaller group effects, log fold changes were
simulated as a fraction of the distribution of the real data,
and for larger effects, log fold changes were a multiple of this
distribution.

In each simulation setting, the ‘optimal’ number of neighbors
was assessed individually for each proportion of missing values
within a further simulation loop, where the imputed matrix was
compared with the original complete matrix using the normal-
ized root mean squared error as proposed by Troyanskaya et al.
(2001). In general, the number of neighbors increased with the
proportion of missing values. For 10% of missing values, the
mean number of neighbors over all settings was 24 (34 and 41
in the cases of 20% and 30% of missing values, respectively).

3.1.] Arranged covariance structures Four different scenarios
with arranged covariance structures were simulated. Under scen-
arios A1 and A2, autocorrelated covariance structures were
simulated, where group sizes were equal in scenario A1 (i.e.,
n1 2 n2 2 10, n1 + n2 2 n) and unequal in scenario A2 (n1 = 5
and n2 2 15). Expression data for scenarios A3 and A4 were
simulated with unstructured covariance matrices with sample
sizes n1 2 5 and n2 2 15 in scenario A3 and to study especially
the case of small sample sizes n1 2 n2 2 4 in scenario A4. The set
size 61: 100 was ﬁxed in all scenarios A1—A4.

In these four scenarios, the simple model without permutation
procedures yielded completely unacceptable testing levels ranging
from 32% to 39% false-positive rejections of H0 in scenarios A3
and A4 and ~70% in scenarios A1 and A2. Applying instead the
mixed model in combination with the permutation procedure,
the pre-speciﬁed testing level of 5% was sufﬁciently maintained
in all scenarios, in the case of no missing values (Table 2). The
introduction of missing values did not seriously affect the testing
levels. Imputation of missing values by the k—nearest neighbor
method, however, led to a decrease of testing levels in scenarios
A2 and A3, down to 2.7% in A2 and down to 3.6% in A3.

To study the inﬂuence of missing values onto the power, we
selected that alternative 8 for the log-fold changes where each
scenario reached 80% power in the case when there were no
missing values in the data (Figs. 1 and 2). Under scenario A1,
there was only a small loss of power because of the missing
values, and imputation did not correct for this loss. In scenarios
A2 and A3 (unequal sample sizes), the loss of power through the
‘existence’ of missing values was much stronger, but the imput-
ation procedure could correct for this loss. A strong power
decrease was also observed in scenario A4 (small group sizes);
however, the imputation approach could not help to compensate
for this loss.

3.1.2 Shrinkage covariance estimate An overview of samples
sizes for simulation scenarios B1—B6 is provided in Table 3. In
these scenarios, the set size a’ was 10, 50 or 100. When covariance
matrices were estimated by the shrinkage approach from the real
data and no permutation procedure was applied to linear model
analysis, simulated testing levels were either too small or too
large in most settings (Table 3). Only in the cases with set sizes
of d: 50, simulated testing levels were near the required 5%.

values. Dashed line: without missing values imputation; solid line: after

In most cases without permutation procedure, simulated testing
levels increased with an increasing proportion of missing values.
Imputation of these missing values could not correct for this bias.

When the linear model analysis was combined with the per-
mutation procedure, the pre-speciﬁed testing level was main-
tained in most cases (Table 3). There were only some smaller
deviations, yielding testing levels of ~4% (B6) or 5.5% (B2).
The introduction of missing values led either to small decreases
(B1, B2, B4) or to small increases (B3, B5, B6) of the testing
levels. Imputation of these missing values led to a clear improve-
ment in scenarios B2 and B6. However, for scenarios B4 and B5
(i.e. with unequal sample sizes and small or moderate set sizes 61),
the imputation of missing values was counterproductive.

In most of the scenarios with shrinkage covariance estimates,
power was not seriously affected by the introduction of missing
values. A strong decrease in power could, however, be observed
in scenario B5, i.e. with a set size of d: 50 and unequal samples
sizes. Missing value imputation could not adjust for this bias
(Fig. 3).

3.2 Analysis of case study

To detect differences between the Calr+/— and the WT mice, we
ﬁrst compared each protein spot individually between the two
experimental groups by means of Welch’s t-test, yielding no sig-
niﬁcant result.

As next step, each protein set, according to the functional
terms of the different ontology domains, was analyzed individu-
ally. The top ﬁve terms in each ontology domain, i.e. with the
smallest P-Value, are listed in Table 4. The sizes of the listed sets
were rather small, ranging from 2 to 11 protein spots. Missing
values were only ‘present’ in the Calr+/— group with proportion

proteomics data. Furthermore, most global tests used for the
analysis of genomics data do not allow for missing values as
typical in gel-based or MS—based protein expression data. In
this regard, we studied the applicability of a simple global test
procedure to such proteomics data and evaluated the effect of
missing values onto the testing level and the power.

Our simulations with arranged and real-world covariance
matrices have shown, that in combination with a permutation
procedure, a pre-speciﬁed testing levels can be maintained in
diverse scenarios. Permutation approaches were also successfully
used in global test procedures in genomics to correct for biases in
the testing level (Goeman et al., 2004; Mansmann and Meister,
2005). With regard to our simulation results, we would generally

recommend the permutation approach for global tests on gel-
based proteomics data with missing values. Without permutation
procedures, the global test performed poor in each of our simu-
lated scenarios.

Our simulations also yielded that scenarios with unequal sizes
of the experimental groups (A2, A3, B4—B6) are critical with
regard to testing level and power. However, in one of these
cases (B6), a bias through missing values could be corrected by
means of a missing values imputation approach. In more detail,
an inappropriate decrease of simulated levels was observed in
scenarios A2 and A3, whereas an inappropriate increase of simu-
lated levels was observed in scenarios B4 and B5. From these
results, we would recommend that users should use the mixed
model without imputation procedure in the case of unequal
sample sizes.

Interestingly, the missing values were more frequent in the
Calr+/— than those in WT group in our example. From this,
one could conclude that the missingness is group-speciﬁc here.
However, it is known that in multiplex gel approaches, where a
gel is prepared with more than one sample (e. g. one treatment
and one control sample), missing values ‘appear’ parallel in both
groups.

Although, the P—values in our analysis of the real data from
our mouse experiment were not adjusted for multiple testing
(Dudoit et al., 2003), the generation of P—values by the global
test procedure allowed at least for a ranking of functional terms.
Therefore, we are cautious with the biological conclusions in this
concrete example. Nevertheless, the analysis of our mouse data
points at correlations between the deﬁciency of the protein ‘cal-
reticulin’ and protein sets related to biological processes in the

heart muscle. These correlations were also reported in the
context of other experiments (Lee et al., 2013; Li et al., 2002).
Moreover, our analysis detected a correlation between the pro-
tein ‘Actin, alpha cardiac muscle 1’ and the experimental group
factor ‘calreticulin’. Likewise, this correlation was reported
earlier in another experiment (Papp et al., 2010). Both reproduc-
tions of known results show, additional to the simulation results,
that our methods produced reasonable results.

It should also be pointed out that the protein ‘Actin, alpha
cardiac muscle 1’ was not detected in the analysis of the individ-
ual spots but detected only when analyzed as a set of multiple
spots. This might be explained by an increased statistical power
when testing a set of spots globally in comparison to individual
testing.

An alternative to global tests can be enrichment analysis.
In microarray analyses, for example, enrichment tests are used
to see whether a certain functional term is overrepresented
among the differentially expressed features compared to the
non-signiﬁcant features. In the context of gel-based expression
data, such an enrichment approach appears to be less reasonable
because not each gel spot is identiﬁed and related to a functional
annotation. An enrichment procedure, proposed for mass spec-
trometric protein expression data by Louie et al. (2010), is, there-
fore, not adequate for gel-based data. Thus, our proposed global
test procedure is a more useable approach for the biological
interpretation of group comparison in gel-based proteomics.

Although we focused speciﬁcally on global tests for gel-based
proteomics data, other proteomics data, e. g. from Liquid chro-
matography-MS/MS (LC-MS/MS) experiments, are also con-
cerned with missing values. For these cases, further methods

for missing values imputation have been proposed (Karpievitch
et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2006). Because the frequency of LC—MS/
MS experiments has overtaken that of 2-DE experiments in
proteomics, the adaption of the global test idea to these types
of data presents an interesting challenge for subsequent research.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Our proposed global test procedure can detect differences be-
tween experimental groups that would be omitted by standard
protein-wise testing in proteomics experiments. Like in other al-
ready published global test approaches, we used a permutation
procedure to correct for a bias in the testing level. As missing
values are frequent in protein expression data, our simulation
results show that their imputation can adjust for a loss in
power. In addition, the presented method allows for the ranking
of GO terms related to certain protein sets and thus facilitates the
biological interpretation of a proteomics experiment.

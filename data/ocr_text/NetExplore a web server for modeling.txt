Abstract

Motivation: Quantitative and qualitative assessment of biological data often produces small essen—
tial recurrent networks, containing 3—5 components called network motifs. In this context, model
solutions for small network motifs represent very high interest.

Results: Software package NetExplore has been created in order to generate, classify and analyze
solutions for network motifs including up to six network components. NetExplore allows plotting
and visualization of the solution’s phase spaces and bifurcation diagrams.

Availability and implementation: The current version of NetExplore has been implemented in Perl—
CGI and is accessible at the following locations: http://Iine.bioinfolab.net/nex/NetExplore.htm and

http://nex.autosome.ru/nex/NetExplore.htm.

1 Introduction

The analysis of biological systems using quantitative and experimental
methods often produces small gene regulatory networks or network
motifs which perform critical functions. Network motifs including
2—5 nodes became the major subjects of modeling and analysis
(Goentoro et 61]., 2009; Milo et 61]., 2002; Mangan and Alon, 2003).
Many types of network motifs have been identified and described
(Goentoro et 61]., 2009; Heinaniemi et 61]., 2013; Papatsenko and
Levine, 2011; Shen et 61]., 2012; Stricker et 61]., 2008). However, even
motifs with identical topologies (order of regulatory links) may pro-
duce surprisingly rich spectrums of dynamic solutions.

Constraining network parameters given biological data is rou—
tinely used to model networks and network motifs; this approach
has advantages and limitations. Major limitations include: (i) The
availability of adequate biological data to fit the network param—
eters, (ii) overfitting problems, caused by imbalance between the
amount of experimental data and the number of unknown param-
eters (Janssens et 61]., 2006; Papatsenko and Levine, 2011;
Papatsenko et 61]., 2013; Warmflash et 61]., 2012). Constraining par-
ameters may produce many alternative solutions.

Recent progress in genomics and the accumulation of large
amounts of high—throughput data allows reconstruction of Gene
Regulatory Networks (GRNs) and finding essential network motifs
in silico (Ivanova et 61]., 2006; Lu et 61]., 2009). Collection of data and
validation of these predicted network motifs is difficult, but prediction
of their likely behavior is desirable. Solutions may be obtained by
assigning ‘random’ sets of parameters, centered on biologically rele—
vant parameter values. Collection and classification of many ‘emitted’
random solutions predicts probable behavior of network motifs.

2 Algorithm

NetExplore includes three parts (modules): NetExplore Solver,
NetExplore Browser and NetExplore Bifurcator. Each module is
available online and as a standalone program for download.
NetExplore Solver emits random sets of parameters for a user—de—
fined network. NetExplore Browser explores solutions and visual—
izes their phase spaces. NetExplore Bifurcator carries out
bifurcation analysis and displays bifurcation diagrams.

Net Explore algorithm is based on the previously developed
framework for GRNs (Papatsenko et 61]., 2011; Papatsenko et 61].,

Fig. 1. Identical networks may produce different solutions. (A, E) Two net-
works are shown with identical topologies, but different values of K (regula-
tory strengths, arrow thickness). (B, F) Phase spaces are shown, (B) the
solution is a limit cycle attractor, (F) the solution is a multistable system with
three point attractors shown by red color. (C, G) The same phase spaces in
the presence of stochastic noise, the attractors produce "clouds" of states.
Colors in B, C, F and G show system evolution in time (red — finite states). (D,
H) Bifurcation analysis (proportional scaling of all Ks) of motifs on A and E is
shown. (D) Oscillator produces a characteristic pattern. (H) Multistable sys-
tem, three dynamic point attractors are clearly visible in the transition region
(see the blue line)

2013; Zinzen et al., 2006). A detailed description of the framework
is available in Supplementary Material. Concentration of every com—
ponent in the system is calculated based on a system of ordinary dif—
ferential equations (ODE) or stochastic differential equations (SDE),
defined automatically by NetExplore. Synthesis of every x,- compo—
nent in the system is calculated from integrated inputs (Pi, reﬂects
the network topology), exponential decay and stochastic noise:

 = OCiP,‘ — ﬂilxi] + 61(07 COM (1)

 

In Equation (1), or, ﬂ and 5 define synthesis, decay and stochastic
noise rate constants. Inputs from A activators and R repressors are
integrated as follows:

p in Equation (2) describes probability of activation by a single
input:

(1 + CiKiilxil)N — 1
Ci + (1 + CiKiilxil)N — 1’

 

ii—

Equation (3) is similar to Hill function (Berg and von Hippel,
1988; Bintu et al., 2005; Zinzen and Papatsenko, 2007). The model
includes the following parameters: binding constant K, cooperativity
C and number of binding sites N. System of ODEs describing network
is automatically constructed and solved numerically by NetExplore.

3 Results and Discussion

NetExplore Solver provides options for network design. A user de—
fines the number of network components, order and sign of regula—
tory links between the components. NetExplore Solver emits large
number of solutions (standalone version has no limit on the number
of solutions) and classifies them based on the number of dynamic
attractors (monostable, bistable etc) and the presence of periodic sig—
nals (limit cycle attractors). Output of the NetExplore Solver is a list
of solutions (parameter values), which may be analyzed, edited and
passed to the second module, NetExplore Browser. NetExplore
Browser can explore phase spaces for the selected solutions [see
Fig. 1(A,B,E,F)], including analysis of the system in the presence of
stochastic noise (Fig. 1C and G). ‘Adjust parameters’ panel of
NetExplore Browser provides options for model adjustment. The
‘Bifurcate’ button links NetExplore Browser to NetExplore
Bifurcator, a program that carries out bifurcation analysis (Fig. 1D
and H) of a given model solution. The stand—alone version of
NetExplore Bifurcator (see online help) can also create pictures, con—
secutively displaying evolution of the phase space in response to
gradual adjustment of the model parameters. The frames can be
combined into a video, such as the one shown here: https://
www.youtube.com/watchPv=a85upWthwA.

Collecting large a number of solutions (>104) and bifurcation
analysis may require substantial time; therefore it may be desirable
to use the standalone versions of Solver and Bifurcator.

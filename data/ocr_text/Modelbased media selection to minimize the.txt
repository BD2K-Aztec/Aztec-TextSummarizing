Abstract

Motivation: Simple forms of mutualism between microorganisms are widespread in nature.
Nevertheless, the role played by the environmental nutrient composition in mediating cross—
feeding in microbial ecosystems is still poorly understood.

Results: Here, we use mixed—integer bilevel linear programming to investigate the cost of sharing meta—
bolic resources in microbial communities. The algorithm infers an optimal combination of nutrients that
can selectively sustain synergistic growth for a pair of species and guarantees minimum cost of cross—
fed metabolites. To test model—based predictions, we selected a pair of Escherichia coli single gene
knockouts auxotrophic, respectively, for arginine and leucine: AargB and AleuB and we experimentally
verified that model—predicted medium composition significantly favors mutualism. Moreover, mass
spectrometry profiling of exchanged metabolites confirmed the predicted cross—fed metabolites, sup—
porting our constraint based modeling approach as a promising tool for engineering microbial consortia.

1 Introduction

In nature, beneficial interactions between species dramatically contrib—
ute in shaping ecosystem dynamics and survival. Microbes form stable
relationships with a multitude of different organisms, and many of
these relationships have a direct impact on human health (Ray, 2012).
Hence, in spite of an increased complexity, the attention has been
shifted from studying individual microorganisms to investigating the
capabilities of microbial consortia as such (Harcombe et 61]., 2014;
Ponomarova and Patil, 2015 ; Steinway et 61]., 2015; Zelezniak et 61].,
2015 ; Zomorrodi et 61]., 2014). In parallel, several microbial commun-
ities have been engineered for bioremediation (Pawelczyk et 61]., 2008),
metabolic engineering (Masset et 61]., 2012) and biomedical utilization
(Petrof et 61]., 2013). However, understanding the ecological principles
that shape and drive dynamics and evolution of microbial ecosystems
remains a challenging task.

Cooperative interactions between species can take place at differ—
ent levels. One of the most common cooperative interaction is meta—
bolic, although such type of interactions can have radically different
nature. In some cases only one species benefits from the community
without participating in sharing metabolic resources (i.e. altruism
versus parasitism), while often bacteria can establish mutually bene—
ficial inter—species interactions (Kato et 61]., 2008). In this bidirec—
tional interaction a pair of organisms receives an advantage from
each other, typically in terms of cross—fed metabolites. Nevertheless,
mapping these interactions within a microbial community is
hampered by the complexity and dynamic nature of multispecies
ecosystems. To reduce problem complexity, artificial microbial com-
munities have been successfully used to shed some light on the com—
plex relationships between genetic interactions and microbial
community’s behavior (Wintermute and Silver, 2010). In parallel,

engineered systems forcing mutualistic cooperation have been used
to explore the power of model—based analysis in unveiling the under-
lying molecular mechanisms of inter—species interactions (Harcombe
et al., 2014; Klitgord and Segre, 2010; Mee et al., 2014; Zomorrodi
and Maranas, 2012).

The development of large—scale stoichiometric models combined
with linear programming approaches has facilitated the quantitative
understanding of microbial metabolism (Bordbar et al., 2014). In
this constraint—based framework, the detailed reconstructions of
metabolic reactions are deprived of their kinetic and efficiency par-
ameters and are investigated as chemical reaction matrices. Control
strategies that optimize microorganism growth are used to select
biologically meaningful steady—state flux distributions among an en—
semble of in silico cell phenotypes (Varma and Palsson, 1994). The
ability to simulate distributions of ﬂuxes, in various microorganisms
(Freilich et al., 2011) and under diverse perturbations (Segre et al.,
2002) (Schuetz et al., 2012), renders this simple method valuable for
diverse applications (Beg et al., 2007; Facchetti et al., 2012;
Oberhardt et al., 2009; Shlomi et al., 2008; Tepper and Shlomi,
2010; i.e. metabolic engineering, drug discovery, etc.). Using stoi—
chiometric models to capture complex cooperative behavior within
microbial communities, however, is still an open challenge
(Harcombe et al., 2014; Klitgord and Segre, 2010; Steinway et al.,
2015 ; Zomorrodi and Maranas, 2012).

Recently, a set of 46 Escherichia coli single gene knockouts,
auxotrophic for different classes of amino acids and nucleotides,
were used to test their ability to establish synergistic growth
(Wintermute and Silver, 2010). Each pair of mutants was co—culti—
vated in a glucose minimal medium and growth was monitored over
a 4—days period. Under this particular nutrient composition, none of
the mutants was capable of surviving individually, but significant
growth was detected for 17% of the co—cultivated pairs. Because of
their reduced complexity, these synthetic microbial communities
enabled the use of quantitative predictive models (e.g. constraint—
based models) to resolve the underlying molecular interactions.
Joint biochemical reaction networks and ﬂux balance analysis were
used to predict whether a pair of E.coli knockouts can grow by shar—
ing essential metabolites (Wintermute and Silver, 2010). This con—
straint—based modeling approach has been shown to be too
permissive, allowing synergistic growth for more than 90% of the
1035 mutant pairs.

One of the limits of this approach is that the cost of sharing
metabolic resources between microorganisms is typically not taken
into account. Within a community, altruism in bacteria should be
promoted in order to sustain mutualistic type of interactions. This
could be obtained by an appropriate environment, where sharing
metabolic resources is crucial for survival of the different species
(Klitgord and Segre, 2010) and the cost of producing essential me—
tabolites is minimized (Reznik et al., 2013). To this end, we here
propose an algorithm to predict an optimal nutrient composition
that prevents growth of two species when grown in isolation, but
promotes their synergistic growth by minimizing the cost of sharing
essential metabolites (Fig. 1). To experimentally test our in silico
predictions we selected a pair of single Ecoli gene knockouts: AargB
and AleuB, auxotrophic, respectively, for arginine and leucine.
These two strains exhibited poor synergistic growth in a glucose
minimal medium (Wintermute and Silver, 2010), and, more gener—
ally, cross-feeding of arginine and leucine was found to induce mod—
erate and very low cooperativity, respectively (Mee et al., 2014). We
applied our algorithm and simulated synergistic growth of AargB
and AleuB in a glucose minimal medium and in the model—based
predicted medium, where the cost of the interaction was predicted

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the bilevel optimization procedure. A
common set of media components is used to simulate synergistic growth (i.e.
upper panel), or individual growth of the two organisms A and B cultivated in
isolation (i.e. lower panels). While in the former case the two species are
allowed to exchange metabolic resources, in the latter the two strains cannot
communicate. The procedure identifies sets of media components that en-
able only synergistic growth (upper panel), and minimize the cost of pre-
dicted shared essential metabolites

to be significantly lower. We experimentally tested the ability to co—
culture these two Ecoli knockout strains in a minimal M9 medium
supplemented with nucleotides precursors, as suggested by the
model, and showed significantly improved synergistic growth. By
monitoring the supernatant composition using a sensitive mass spec—
trometry approach, we could also identify the most relevant
exchanged metabolites between the two strains and support model
predictions.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Co—cultivation experiment

Deletion strains AargB and AleuB from the Keio collection (Baba
et al., 2006) were grown overnight to saturation in 7 ml rich (LB)
medium in Greiner tubes. Similarly to (Wintermute and Silver,
2010), cells were washed twice and inoculated in M9 medium (con—
taining per liter: 7.52 g of NaZHPO4-2HZO, 3 g of KHZPO4, 0.5 g of
NaCl, 2.5g of (NH4)ZSO4, 14.7mg of CaClZ-ZHZO, 246.5 mg of
MgSO4-7HZO, 16.2mg of FeCl3-6HZO, 180 ug of ZnSO4-7HZO,
120 ug of CuClZ-ZHZO, 120 ug of MnSO4-HZO, 180 ug of
CoClZ-6HZO and 1 mg of thiamine-HC) plus 5 g/l glucose or 2.5 g/l
maltose, 40 uM xanthine, 500 uM inosine (M9 —1— MIX). Individual
strains were diluted 1:100 when grown in isolation, whereas a 1:200
dilution was used when the two strains were grown in combination,
giving in both cases an initial optical density (OD) of 0.05. Growth
was monitored once per day measuring OD with a spectrophotom—
eter at 600nm. The experiment was conducted in triplicates.
Supernatant samples were collected by spinning down 1 ml of cul-
ture volume for 10 min at 400 g.

2.2 Profiling of metabolites in supernatant

Direct ﬂow injection in a Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry was per—
formed on an Agilent 6550 (ESI—iFunnel Q-TOF, Agilent Technologies)
following protocols in (Fuhrer et al., 2011). The Agilent 6550 QTOF
was operated in high resolution negative mode with a scanning mode
from 50 to 1000 m/z. We detected 14083 ions from 4 ul injection of 20
times diluted supernatant samples. Based on metabolites masses, we

Supplementary Tables 81 and 82 were selected by first estimating rela—

medium (M9 —1— MIX). We retained only those metabolites with a fold
change 2 2 and a P—value g 0.001 from a t—test comparison. In parallel,
to filter out those compounds that were likely not to be exchanged (e.g.
secreted by one organism and consumed by the other), we also calcu—
lated relative fold changes of metabolite levels measured in isolated cul—
tures with respect to the interpolated values for the same OD from co—
cultivated supernatant samples (dashed blue lines in Fig. 3). We used a
similar cut—off of two on estimated fold—changes.

2.4 Bilevel FBA procedure (synergistic growth)

Here, we implemented an efficient algorithm to explore optimal media
composition that minimizes the cost of sustaining synergistic growth be—
tween two organisms and simultaneously prevent any growth of the two
isolated species. The problem can be formally stated as follow: given
two different species (A and B) and their related metabolic networks (S A
and SB), seek for the composition of external nutrients which guarantees
biomass production only when the two organisms can share metabolic
resources and, at the same time, minimizes the cost of shared essential
metabolites. Prior to analysis, the stoichiometric matrix for both organ-
isms is transformed into the corresponding form with only irreversible
reactions. To allow the two organisms to communicate through sharing
of metabolites, in each stoichiometric model we replicate the existing up—
take and secretion reactions (VEX’in). For each exchangeable reaction, up—
take rates of a shared metabolite in organism B has to be identical to the
secretion rate in organism A. The method proposed is formulated as a
Mixed Integer Bilevel Linear Programming (MILP). To make this prob-
lem more tractable and amenable for experimental applications the algo—
rithm finds a maximum of five additive components to be added on top
of a standard minimal medium composition (i.e. M9 medium) with no
carbon and nitrogen sources. These parameters can be changed by the
user. The resulting bilevel optimization is a max-max integer linear pro-
gramming problem with an inner and outer problem:

associated to the exchangeable reactions which are allowed to be

the binary variable 3). Similar formalism was used in Facchetti et al.
(20121

The inner problem adjusts the fluxes in order to achieve the
maximum biomass production for the two organisms when
cultivated in isolation (i.e. AI and BI) and when they are allowed
to exchange metabolites (i.e. AC and BC). The outer problem
selects the combination of media components which in a first
objective minimizes the sum of dual variables for inter—species (5)
exchanged metabolites, restricting to those solutions of the
inner problem which guarantee no growth for the individual or—
ganisms (ngI and v?) (Supplementary Fig. 81). The dual variables
8 can be considered as the cost of exchanging metabolites in terms
of growth rate reduction for organisms A and B, so called shadow
prices (Reznik et al., 2013). A metabolite with a large negative
shadow price has an important contribution in biomass
generation.

A MILP solution is guaranteed to be optimal. However, its for—
mulation is NP—hard, and the worst case runtime scales exponen—
tially in the number of reactions. In practice for the genome wide
metabolic network of E.coli metabolism we have achieved globally
optimal solutions relatively quickly. A second optimization minim-
izes the sum of absolute fluxes for exchanged metabolites between
species A and B:

min 2 ha)

To estimate the relative difference between the cost of produc—
tion of shared metabolites in a glucose minimal medium and the
model—predicted medium, we simulated optimal growth of individ—
ual strains, AargB and AleuB, in M9 minimal medium without car—
bon and nitrogen sources, supplemented with five random
exchangeable metabolites (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. 81).
Only those media that could not support the growth of the two iso—
lated organisms were retained. In total, we simulated 3972
randomized media. For E.coli AargB and AleuB, we then supple—
mented the media with the corresponding essential metabolites: or—
nithine and leucine, respectively. Maximum biomass production
was estimated and compared with optimal growth in the same
media, but now forcing AargB to secrete 0.1 mmol/gDW/h of leu—
cine and AleuB to secrete 0.1 mmol/gDW/h of ornithine.
Differences between optimal growth solutions reﬂect the associ—
ated cost of sharing ornithine and leucine by the two organisms
(i.e. shadow prices). The IBM CPLEX Optimizer solver and Cobra
toolbox version 2.0.5 were used to solve the mixed integer and lin-
ear problems.

3 Results

3.1 Synergistic—growth in model—based

predicted media

Understanding the mechanisms at the basis of inter—species inter—
actions and how metabolism of the entire microbial community
works in concert is crucial to engineer microbial communities. Here,
we developed a novel constraint—based modeling approach that is
based on MILP and aims at predicting media composition forcing
mutualism between microorganisms in two ways: (i) the nutrient
composition does not support growth of any of the two individual
organisms and (ii) synergistic growth is achieved minimizing the
cost of the metabolic interactions (Fig. 1). The cost is estimated in
terms of growth rate reduction upon secretion of shared metabolites,
so called shadow prices (see Section 2) (Reznik et al., 2013). This ap-
proach differs from previous works (Freilich et al., 2011; Klitgord
and Segre, 2010) by guarantying optimality of the solution and by
taking into account the cost of sharing metabolic resources. By sim—
ultaneously simulating the synergistic growth of two species and
their individual growth in a bilevel optimization framework, we
devised an efficient method to select nutritional components forcing
mutualistic type of relationships. To provide testable and meaning—
ful predictions, we restricted our search to a maximum of five nutri-
ent components to be added on top of an M9 minimal medium
without any carbon (e.g. glucose) or nitrogen source (e.g. ammonia).
By doing so we predicted a relatively simple medium composition,
amenable for experimental validation, from which it is possible to
intuitively understand the basis of the underlying reduced cost in
sharing essential metabolites.

We applied our algorithm and searched for optimal media com—
positions to promote cooperation between two E.coli single gene—
knockout strains: AargB and AleuB, auxotrophic, respectively, for
arginine and leucine. Cooperation between auxotrophic E.coli
strains for amino acids such as arginine and leucine, when grown
in a glucose minimal medium, led to very poor synergistic growth,
highlighting the low propensity in sharing these amino acids (Mee
et al., 2014; Wintermute and Silver, 2010). Nevertheless, our ana—
lysis suggested that synergistic growth can be significantly im-
proved by an opportune medium composition (Fig. 2A), namely
supplementing nucleotide precursors to the medium. We found
that addition of nucleotide precursors, such as xanthine and in-
osine, was key to reduce the cost of the interaction between the
two organisms (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S3). The underly-
ing reason for the reduced cost was the role of certain amino acids
in nucleotide biosynthesis. Hence, when growth is limited by avail—
ability of an amino acid, providing the cells with direct precursors
of nucleotides increases the amount of biomass that can be pro—
duced from an equal amount of amino acid (i.e. yield)
(Supplementary Fig. S2). For example, addition of nucleotides pre—
cursors further reduces the need for aspartate, which not only is a
precursor of branched chain amino acids, but is also involved in ar—
ginine, UMP and IMP biosynthesis. Intuitively, when cell growth is
limited by amino acids, the yield can be improved by supplement—
ing the media with any metabolites that allow cells to redistribute
more amino acids resources into protein biosynthesis to sustain
growth, rather than other secondary biosynthetic pathways (e.g.
nucleotide metabolism).

3.2 Experimental model validation

Our predictions suggested that addition of 1,4-alpha-D-glucan, in-

in particular the cost of sharing leucine by AargB, if compared to a
glucose minimal medium (Fig. 2A). In order to test our hypothesis,
we co—cultivated the two strains, AargB and AleuB, in M9 glucose
minimal medium (i.e. M9 —1— G) and M9 supplemented with mal—
tose, inosine and xanthine (i.e. M9 —1— MIX), according to model
suggestions (see Section 2). We grew the two knockout strains in LB
medium overnight, washed cells two times with M9 salts and inocu—
lated the main culture media. Similarly to (Mee et al., 2014;
Wintermute and Silver, 2010), we followed growth by measuring
OD at 600 nm approximately every 24 h for 86 h (Fig. 2B). Overall,
synergistic growth between the two E.coli strains was established in
the predicted medium (i.e. M9 —1— MIX) with a higher degree of co—
operation than in a glucose minimal medium (Fig. 2B), confirming
model predictions (Supplementary Fig. S3).

It is worth noting that the slightly higher OD reached by AargB
and AleuB when grown individually in M9 —1— MIX relative to glu—
cose M9, is likely a consequence of amino acid carry—over from
overnight cultivation in rich medium. While the residual amino acids
amount is similar between glucose M9 and M9 —1— MIX, the pres—
ence of nucleotide precursors, as predicted by the model, increases
the biomass yield and results in a higher final OD.

3.3 Cross—feeding revealed by overflow metabolism

We next asked whether improved synergistic growth was a mere
consequence of a richer medium, or if the predicted lower cost of
sharing leucine and arginine precursors could be supported experi—
mentally. For each E.coli strain grown in isolation, we therefore
collected supernatant samples after 24 h, and for the co—cultivated
strains we monitored dynamic metabolic changes in the super—
natant for the entire growth experiment. We used a sensitive
metabolomics platform to profile secreted metabolites (Fuhrer
et al., 2011). In total, we could monitor the relative abundance of
526 metabolites annotated in a genome—scale metabolic model of
E.coli (Orth et al., 2011; Supplementary Table S4). When compar-
ing relative abundance of metabolites in the supernatant of indi—
vidually grown species, we identified 15 significantly differentially
secreted metabolites in the AargB strain grown on M9 —1— MIX
(Supplementary Table 81).

Despite the fact that our mass—spectrometry approach cannot
distinguish isoleucine from leucine, the corresponding ion is
among the most significantly excreted ones (Fig. 3A). Moreover,
we found several intermediates in the leucine biosynthesis pathway
(e.g. valine: Fig. 3B, 4—methyl—2—oxopentanoate: Fig. 3C, 4—amino—
butanoate: Fig. 3D and S—3—methyl—2—oxopentanoate: Fig. 3E),
with leucine biosynthesis as the most significant overrepresented
metabolic pathway among extracellular metabolites (adjusted
P-value of 1.14E—6 from hypergeometric test). It is worth noting
that when the two mutants are co—cultivated, we did not detect
high level of isoleucine/leucine, suggesting that the higher produc—
tion of this amino acid from AargB is indeed feeding the AleuB
strain and sustain his growth (Fig. 3A dashed blue line). In parallel,
the AleuB mutant showed an enhanced overflow of 46 metabolites
(Supplementary Table S2). Although, we could not detect arginine
in the supernatant, ornithine, which is the predicted metabolite to
be secreted from AleuB and sustain AargB growth, exhibited a
slightly higher accumulation (~2-fold higher) (Fig. 3G). It is worth
noting that similarly to AargB, the most significant accumulating
metabolite in AleuB is the substrate of the deleted enzyme
(i.e. 3—carboxy—2—hydroxy—4—methylpentanoate for AleuB, and
N—acetyl—L—glutamate for AargB) (Fig. 3E and H), with no differ-
ence between M9 —1— G and M9 —1— MIX media.

4 Conclusions

In this study, we developed a ﬂux balance analysis framework
adopting bilevel optimization to design complex media promoting
cooperation within microbial ecosystems. We experimentally chal—
lenged model predictions by selecting a pair of E.coli single gene
knockouts auxotrophic, respectively, for arginine and leucine:
AargB and AleuB. These strains were previously reported to show a
poor cooperation in a glucose minimal medium. Leucine in fact
seems to be hardly shared by E.coli when grown in a glucose min-
imal medium. We experimentally monitored synergistic growth in
the model—predicted medium for 86 h. In agreement with model pre-
dictions we found the new medium composition to favor mutualism
between the strains. By using mass—spectrometry to monitor
exchanged compounds, we verified increased sharing of leucine and
ornithine in agreement with their reduced ‘sharing cost’. Overall, by
introducing a novel in silico approach, we are able to investigate
how external environment in the form of nutrients viability can
favor microbial cooperation and design complex media that can
promote mutualism between species.

The solutions identified by our constraint—based modeling ap—
proach do not take into account possible kinetic limitations, such as
restrictions on the rates of substrates uptake. While qualitatively
model predictions predict class of metabolites that can improve mu—
tualistic growth, quantitative variations caused by substrates affin—
ities can be experimentally tested to further improve media
composition. Moreover, our modeling approach can be scaled to
study higher order microbial communities and more complex media
compositions. The ever increasing number and accuracy of genome—
scale metabolic models of different bacteria will soon enable to use
similar modeling approaches to facilitate the study of more natural—
istic type of microbial communities and to shed light on the inter-
play between environmental nutrient composition and microbial
interactions.

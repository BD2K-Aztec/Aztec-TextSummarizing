ABSTRACT

Motivation: The task of reconstructing a genomic sequence from a
particular species is gaining more and more importance in the light of
the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies
and their limitations. Applications include not only compensation
for missing data in unsequenced genomic regions and the design
of oligonucleotide primers for target genes in species with lacking
sequence information but also the preparation of customized queries
for homology searches.

Results: We introduce the maxAlike algorithm, which reconstructs a
genomic sequence for a specific taxon based on sequence homologs
in other species. The input is a multiple sequence alignment and a
phylogenetic tree that also contains the target species. For this target
species, the algorithm computes nucleotide probabilities at each
sequence position. Consensus sequences are then reconstructed
based on a certain confidence level. For 37 out of 44 target
species in a test dataset, we obtain a significant increase of the
reconstruction accuracy compared to both the consensus sequence
from the alignment and the sequence of the nearest phylogenetic
neighbor. When considering only nucleotides above a confidence
limit, maxAlike is significantly better (up to 10%) in all 44 species.
The improved sequence reconstruction also leads to an increase
of the quality of PCR primer design for yet unsequenced genes:
the differences between the expected Tm and real Tm of the
primer-template duplex can be reduced by ~26% compared with
other reconstruction approaches. We also show that the prediction
accuracy is robust to common distortions of the input trees. The
prediction accuracy drops by only 1% on average across all species
for 77% of trees derived from random genomic loci in a test dataset.

1 INTRODUCTION

With increased opportunities for high—throughput sequencing, a large
number of additional genomes will be sequenced in the near future.
Given the limitations of these sequencing technologies, however, it is
likely that routinely produced genomic sequences will be incomplete
at various levels. Also, the genomic information for less ‘popular’
model organisms or economically important species might remain
unavailable for a long time. It is still essential to infer as much
knowledge as possible about incomplete or missing genomic data
in relation to speciﬁc analyses, such as studying the distribution
of gene families across the phylogeny of species. The relative
position of the target species in the evolutionary tree is typically
known or can be inferred from the partial sequence information
that is already available. With the rapidly growing collection of
sequence data from diverse organisms, homologs for a certain region
of interest can be utilized, together with their inherent pattern of
evolutionary variation. We present an algorithm—maxAlike—that
aims at reconstructing sequences in a particular target species, based
on a species phylogeny and sequence homologs from other species.

The maxAlike algorithm uses a multiple sequence alignment and
a corresponding phylogenetic tree, annotated with phylogenetic
distances on the branches, to estimate mutation rates for each
alignment column. It then infers nucleotide probabilities for each site
in the theoretical homologous sequence in the target species. From
the estimated nucleotide probabilities, the entire sequence can be
reconstructed, given a certain level of conﬁdence. The reconstructed
sequence can then be utilized for several applications.

The sensitivity and speciﬁcity of homology search methods that
are based either on primary sequence alone or on proﬁle alignment
algorithms can be increased by employing a search query that is
optimized for the target species of the homology search (Menzel
et al., 2009).

A very important application of (partially) reconstructed
sequences is the design of oligonucleotide primers for a PCR
experiment, e.g. for analysis of expression of the targeted
(re—)sequencing of a particular region that is not or incompletely
represented in a genome assembly. The successful ampliﬁcation
of a gene sequence depends on a careful selection of a pair of
short primers, which, besides certain thermodynamic properties,

should have the highest possible sequence identity to their target
site. Designing these primers for yet unsequenced genes is still
a difﬁcult problem, often based on trial and error. One of the
ﬁrst approaches that comes to mind is to derive primers from
an available homologous sequence in a phylogenetically proximal
species. Alternatively, if more than one homolog is known, primers
can be derived from a consensus sequence, based on a multiple
sequence alignment of the homologs. However, the nearest—neighbor
approach might be substantially biased toward one end in the
phylogeny and does not take sequence conservation into account,
whereas the multiple—alignment approach usually does not consider
the exact phylogenetic position of the target species and a careful
selection of the seed sequences is an additional parameter. Another
issue is the handling of ambiguous sites in the alignment. Restricting
the consensus sequence to only perfectly conserved sites might limit
the available nucleotides too much in order to derive a primer pair
with the desired properties, e. g. thermodynamics, length or base
composition. A common remedy is the selection of the most frequent
nucleotide at each alignment position to derive the consensus
sequence. These problems are inherently solved by the maxAlike
reconstruction algorithm, which takes the phylogenetic position of
the target species as well as all possibly available homologs into
account.

Primer design by including phylogenetic information has been
addressed earlier, but with a more narrow scope. In particular,
the pr imers4clades approach (Contreras—Moreira et al., 2009)
derives a phylogenetic tree from a multiple sequence alignment
of protein—coding genes. From this, the user can, through manual
intervention though, restrict the input sequences to a phylogenetic
group that is considered for primer design based on a CODEHOP
algorithm. However, it does not compute nucleotide probabilities
and is not suitable for reconstructing arbitrary non—protein—coding
sequences, which potentially can occupy an even larger portion
of the genome than the ~l.2% occupied by the protein—coding
genes (Mattick and Makunin, 2006). In fact, in the light of the
ENCODE project (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2007), which
showed that more than 90% of the human genome is transcribed,
it may become relevant to design primers on a genome—wide scale.
The restriction to protein—coding regions and the limited availability
as a web server makes a comparison with other methods difﬁcult
for a genome—wide benchmark. The uniprimeZ web server
(Boutros et al., 2009) employs a pipeline with homology search,
multiple alignment and primer design software to derive primers
from conserved parts of a given gene. However, no phylogenetic
information is taken into account. Methods for designing degenerate
primers start by ﬁnding highly conserved regions across a sequence
alignment, e.g. by solving a Set Covering Problem (Jabado et al.,
2006). Depending on the input alignment, this often limits the
number of available alignment positions for the primer design
considerably. The maxAlike algorithm, however, not only highlights
conserved regions by creating sequence proﬁles but also makes
all possible sequence positions available for primer design with a
certain conﬁdence threshold. Using a probability threshold for each
nucleotide is similar to exploiting base quality scores for selecting
regions for primer design (Li et al., 1997). The output of maxAlike
can also be used for designing degenerate primers, where two or
more nucleotides are allowed at one position, by choosing the
most likely occurring nucleotides for this site. By relying on the
highly probable nucleotide for a site, however, the total number

of degenerate sites can be reduced, which in turn increases the
speciﬁcity of the primer sequence. This makes maxAlike the optimal
choice for designing primers, when the sequence of the target gene
is not known, but homologous sequences of other species and a
phylogenetic tree including the target species are available. These
data serve as input to the maxAlike web server, which in turn allows
for estimation of primers using Pr imer3 from the reconstructed
sequence in the target species.

The principle of the maxAlike sequence reconstruction is similar
to the reconstruction of genes from ancestral species from their
extant offspring, but maxAlike reconstructs a gene sequence on
a leaf node of the, possibly unrooted, species tree. Using the
information from the extant offspring, this has been shown to
be a powerful tool for testing hypotheses on the function and
evolution of genes from extinct species, see e. g. Thornton (2004)
for a review. Ancestral sequence reconstruction programs infer the
sequences at the interior nodes of the tree from their descendants
in a rooted phylogeny. In contrast to these, maxAlike reconstructs
the most likely sequence at an additional leaf node in the possibly
unrooted species tree. Therefore, the sequence information of all taxa
inﬂuence the reconstruction of the target sequence. Several methods
for reconstructing ancestral sequences from their descendants have
been developed so far, of which methods based on the maximum
likelihood principle have been shown most successful (Zhang,
1997). Recent applications include the ancestors web server
(Diallo et al., 2010) or the Ortheus program (Paten et al., 2008).
Not only in the case of procaryotes, the ancestral relationships
between species might not be clear, but the phylogenetic relationship
among the taxa can often be derived from the available sequence
data. In these cases, the maxAlike algorithm is still applicable,
without necessarily rooting the tree.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Sequence reconstruction algorithm

The maxAlike algorithm aims at reconstructing the nucleotides of a DNA
sequence homolog in a given target species by employing a maximum
likelihood computation over a phylogenetic tree, which results in residue
probabilities for each position in the target sequence.

The input for maxAlike is a multiple sequence alignment M and a
phylogenetic tree T, which represents the phylogenetic relationships and
distances among the species. Additionally, one of the species in the tree
(but absent in the multiple alignment) is chosen as the target species for the
reconstruction.

Maximum likelihood (ML) methods require an explicit residue
substitution model for calculating substitution probabilities given a certain
branch length. For each alignment position, the ML algorithm performs a
post—order traversal of the tree, starting from the root. From the known
residues found at the leaves of the tree, it then computes likelihoods for
each nucleotide at the interior nodes of the tree, based on the substitution
model and the branch lengths between the tree nodes (Felsenstein, 1981).

The maxAlike algorithm follows two steps, see Figure 1. In the ﬁrst
step, T is restricted to the species contained in the alignment, and for each
alignment column i, a relative substitution rate [1,,- is estimated by numerically
optimizing the likelihood of the tree: [Ll-zargmaquTUr). An extended
HKY85 (Hasegawa et al., 1985; Young and Healy, 2003) substitution model
(4 nt + gap) is used for computing nucleotide substitution probabilities given
a branch length t: ny(t, y.) = [eI“Q]xy, where x and y are the two nucleotides
and Q is the substitution rate matrix. The transversion bias parameter IC is
estimated beforehand from T and M.

Fig. 1. The steps of the maxAlike algorithm. From the input, consisting of a
multiple alignment and a phylogenetic tree, the algorithm computes PSSMs
and reconstructed sequences for the target species. The output can readily be
applied to primer design and homology search.

In the second step, we use the estimated values ft,- to compute the
probabilities for each residue at the i—th position of the target sequence.
We re—root the original tree T to the target species and calculate the
likelihoods LT([L) for each nucleotide at the root of the tree. From these
likelihoods, we directly obtain the residue probabilities in each alignment
column i. In our substitution model, gaps are treated as an additional state
rather than missing information. Thus, we can also assign a probability of
observing a gap for each sequence position in the target species, which in
turn depends on the distribution of gaps in the other species.

The calculated probabilities depend explicitly on the relative position of
the target species to the other species in T. If the target is in close proximity
to one or several other species with known homologs, then high probabilities
will be assigned to the nucleotides present in these neighboring species. On
the other hand, a single substitution in the sequence of a close neighbor
has little impact on the target species, if it is not shared by other closely
related sequences. With increasing distance to its neighbors, the residue
probabilities in the target species will converge to an equilibrium distribution
based on the nucleotide frequencies of the substitution model, which are
derived from the base composition of the input alignment. The higher the
substitution rate ft,- is the faster the equilibrium is reached. The algorithm
thus tells us which alignment columns or regions can be expected to be
informative for a particular target sequence. To this end, we also compute
the Shannon information content at each site, from which in turn, we can
derive subsequences with a minimum length that have a certain minimum
average information content, e. g. for constructing homology search patterns
based on position—speciﬁc scoring matrices (PSSSs). From the nucleotide
probabilities at each site, we then can reconstruct the entire sequence
homolog in the target species. At the lower end, we choose the most
likely nucleotide at each position. For sites with increasing mutation rates,
however, the probabilities for each nucleotide will decrease faster and the
information content also decreases. Thus, for a more precise reconstruction,
only positions with nucleotide probabilities above a certain, user—deﬁned,
probability threshold are considered for the reconstructed sequence, while
the remaining nucleotides will be denoted as unknown ‘N’ characters.

The algorithm is available via a web server or as download of the entire
source code. The user submits a multiple sequence alignment of homologous
DNA or RNA sequences and a phylogenetic tree and chooses one of the

species in the tree as the target for reconstruction. The output contains the
predicted nucleotide probabilities for each column as well as a sequence logo
(Schneider and Stephens, 1990) and two reconstructed sequences: with and
without a user—deﬁned probability threshold. These reconstructed sequences
can then be used as input to primer design software or directly submitted
to the Primer3 web server (Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000). In addition,
the information content and the estimated relative substitution rates fr,- are
printed for each alignment column i. These values can be used for identifying
slowly or rapidly evolving sites or for ﬁnding those characters that evolve
at rates according to the phylogenetic tree (Townsend and Lopez—Giraldez,
2010). The last part of the output contains a list of PSSMs with average
information content and length deﬁned by the user. These PSSMs can directly
be used with homology search programs, e.g. fragrepZ (Mosig et al.,
2006).

2.2 Data and benchmarking

An example application of the algorithm for constructing PSSMs for
homology searches was discussed in Menzel et al. (2009). Here, we go
beyond the proof of concept and extend the algorithm to the reconstruction
of sequences and explore the application to the design of oligonucleotide
primers for PCR.

For evaluation of the reconstruction performance, we use two datasets
from multiple alignments of vertebrates. The datasets are derived from
human genome (hgl8) alignments to 43 vertebrate species (multiz44way)
(Browser, 2010). These genome—wide alignments contain both protein—
coding and non—coding regions. The ﬁrst dataset contains alignments with
higher sequence conservation, MZ44-I : multiz score from IM to 4M, at least
20 species per alignment with minimum length 200 nt, and with n=3431
alignments. The second set contains alignments with lower sequence
conservation, MZ44-2: multiz score from 10k to 1M, at least 20 species
per alignment and n: 13524. Gapped columns were removed from the
alignments.

From each alignment, we removed one species at a time and used the
remaining sequences to reconstruct the homolog in the removed species
(target species) with the maxAlike algorithm using the phylogenetic tree
from the multiz phastCons model (see Supplementary Fig. 813). The
transition bias parameter IC for the HKY85 substitution model is estimated
using PAML (Yang, 2007). The predicted nucleotide probabilities were
converted into PSSMs for each predicted sequence. In addition, sequences
were reconstructed by considering the one nucleotide at each site with a
probability greater than a threshold of 0.5 and by considering the most
probable nucleotide without using a threshold. We also created PSSMs by
counting the nucleotide frequencies in each input alignment and derived
consensus sequences, again using either a relative frequency threshold of
0.5 or no threshold, respectively. In order to evaluate the effect of including
phylogenetic information into the PSSM and sequence reconstruction, we
compared the predictions from the maxAlike probabilities (ML) and the
nucleotide frequencies (Freq). Additionally, for each target species, we
took the sequence of the phylogenetically closest neighbor (NN) as another
prediction for the target sequence. Depending on the alignment, this neighbor
is not necessarily constant for each species, thus we measured the average
distance to the nearest neighbor for each target species.

The ﬁve reconstructions for each target sequence (ML and Freq, each
with and without threshold, and NN) were evaluated in terms of the
percentage of correctly predicted nucleotides (recovery rate) by comparing
the reconstructed sequences to the previously removed homolog in the target
species. We excluded absolutely conserved sites from the evaluation, since
all methods perform identically on this subset. For the comparison of the
ML and Freq PSSMs, we calculate the MATCH scores (Kel et al., 2003)
for both the ML and Freq PSSMs using the previously removed sequence as
reference. The MATCH algorithm is designed for matching matrix proﬁles
to a primary sequence and the score takes values between 0.0 and 1.0, with
1.0 denoting a perfect match of the matrix to the sequence. For both the

recovery rate and MATCH score comparison, we calculated P—values using
the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

The species tree, which is estimated from whole—genome alignments and
thus represents an average across many different loci and genes, is naturally
different from gene trees made from a single set of homologous sequences
of one gene family. Gene trees can be used as input for maxAlike, if some
sequence information for the target sequence is already available, e.g. for
ﬁlling gaps. An optimized gene tree should lead to more accurate predictions
and thus to a higher recovery rate for the sequence reconstruction. Thus,
we measure the possible gain of using gene trees over the species tree. To
this end, we estimate a tree for each alignment in both datasets using the
f asttree program (Price et al., 2010), remove and reconstruct the target
sequences using the estimated tree again and calculate the recovery rates.
Since we already know the sequence of the target species beforehand, the
gene tree estimated from a particular alignment thus represents the most
‘perfect’ phylogeny for this set of sequences.

If no species tree is available in the ﬁrst place, the phylogenetic tree
needs to be inferred ﬁrst from other available sequence information,
typically from other genes or genomic loci. These trees typically have a
different topology and different branch lengths than the reference species
tree. While the overall topology might be similar, i.e. major clades can
be distinguished, leaves within clades are locally rearranged. To measure
the robustness of the maxAlike predictions to erroneous input trees, we
selected all the 479 alignments of minimum length 100 nt that contain
all 44 species (average alignment length is 178 nt). From each of these
alignments, we inferred a phylogenetic tree using f asttree, resulting in
214 binary trees. Additionally, we created 200 trees each by concatenating
3, 5 and 7 randomly selected alignments (from those 479) and retained
the binary trees, giving us 808 trees in total. We then used the program
sdist (http://www.daimi.au.dk/~mailund/split—dist.html) to measure the
split distance (Gusﬁeld, 1991) of each estimated tree to the reference species
tree. The split distance is a measure of the topological similarity between
two trees, which we used to broadly classify the tree distortion. However,
also pairwise distances between all pairs of species vary between the species
tree and the estimated trees. The distances range from 5 to 36 with median
17. We then binned the trees according to their distance in 10 bins (see
Supplementary Fig. 4a for the distribution of the bins). For each bin, we
copied each dataset (only half of the data in MZ44-2), randomly chose
one of the trees in the bin for each alignment as input for maxAlike, and
reconstructed the target sequences again. This gives us a measure how the
maxAlike reconstruction performance responds to suboptimal tree inputs.

Another issue that one has to consider is that two loci often evolve
at different rates, which affects the branch lengths of the estimated trees.
Therefore, we also measured the impact of branch length distortion in the
input tree on the maxAlike prediction accuracy. We created another ﬁve
datasets corresponding to ﬁve bins, each containing 20 trees with a certain
‘relative normal’ error on the branch lengths [adapted from (Diaz—Uriarte
and Garland, 1998)]. For each branch with length 19, we added an amount
drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and SD equal to the speciﬁed
relative normal error e multiplied by the branch length: 19 =b+norm(0, eb).
By scaling the distribution of the error to the length of each branch, branches
of different lengths are all subject to the same relative error. We used ﬁve
relative normal errors: 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0.

2.3 Application to primer design

For a successful PCR reaction, the chosen primer pair needs to follow
certain restrictions regarding thermodynamics, self—complementarity and
base composition. It is also very important, that the primer sequence matches
its complementary sequence in the target gene sufﬁciently. Mismatching
nucleotides in the primer sequence (by wrong estimation of the target
sequence) increase the chance of non—speciﬁc binding, leading to possible
undesired by—products (Cha and Thilly, 1993). Mismatches between a primer
and its complementary sequence decrease the melting temperature T m of the
primer—template duplex. To compensate for this, the annealing temperature

in the PCR cycle can be reduced to excite the formation of the duplex. Even
though the destabilizing effect of single mismatches on oligo hybridization
decreases with increasing oligo length, a higher number of mismatches
cause a large decrease in the melting temperature with constant oligo length
(Koehler and Peyret, 2005). The T m of the forward and reverse primer
should be similar to avoid different annealing behaviors, since usually both
primers have equal concentration in the reaction mix. Thus, a reduction of
the number of mismatches would be beneﬁcial for the process of designing
primers and for an efﬁcient PCR reaction. To study the impact of an
improved sequence reconstruction rate on the hybridization properties of
oligonucleotide primers, we measured the difference between the T m of
the predicted primers to their complementary target sequences and the
hypothetical perfectly binding primer. For each of the ﬁve reconstructions for
a target sequence (ML and Freq, each with and without threshold, and NN),
we used Primer3 to obtain a pair of primer sequences (Primer length:
15—25 nt, product length 75—300 nt, Primer T m 45—65°C, T m difference
between forward and reverse primer: maximum 5°C) and calculated the
expected T m for both primers. We extracted the complement of each primer
(template) from the known target sequence and counted the number of
mismatches compared with the predicted primers. In addition, we used the
melting program (Novere, 2001) to compute the melting temperature
between the predicted primer and its complement from the target sequence.
If mismatches are present, this ‘real’ T m will be lower than the expected
Tm, calculated by Primer3. Neighboring mismatches and mismatches at
the two extreme positions of the oligo have a higher destabilizing effect
than single mismatches (Kwok et al., 1990). However, these mismatch types
are not supported in the T m calculation by melting and there is also no
other publicly available software for download that supports these mismatch
types. Therefore, we counted the occurrences of these cases separately and
compared the numbers for each of the ﬁve reconstruction methods. Especially
for phylogenetically distant species, the number of mismatches increases so
much, that the Tm could not be computed by mel t ing in most cases. Thus,
we considered only values that are averaged from at least 20 measurements,
in order to compare the numbers between the different methods. Note,
however, that there is still a bias toward the lower end in the absolute
values for the T m difference, because all the cases where the Tm could not
be calculated are not included in the average.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Sequence reconstruction

To test the prediction performance of maxAlike, we compared
the MATCH scores of the maxAlike (ML) and Freq PSSMs for
each of the species. Figure 2 shows the median MATCH scores
(dataset MZ44-2) of both methods for each species compared with
the average tree distance to its closest neighbor. Supplementary
Tables S4 and S5 list all scores for both datasets. For almost all
species, we see a signiﬁcant improvement of the MATCH scores
when using the ML PSSMs compared with the Freq PSSMs. On
the one hand, species with one or more phylogenetically proximal
neighbors will have very high nucleotide probabilities at each
position and in turn yield a high overall score. On the other hand, ML
PSSMs for more distant target species gain most from the inclusion
of phylogenetic information: the difference between ML and Freq
increases systematically with the average distance to the nearest
neighbor. In these species, high probabilities will only be assigned
to highly conserved nucleotide. All bony ﬁshes (teleostei) show
improved scores, since the sequences from the tetrapoda have much
less impact on the ML probabilities than in the Freq PSSMs. Here,
the large fraction of mammals in the overall set of species causes a
substantial bias. Conversely, the impact of bony ﬁsh sequences on

mammalian targets is overestimated in Freq PSSMs compared with
the ML PS SMs.

Table 1 shows the total recovery rates in percent across all
alignments of both the maxAlike (ML) and the Freq reconstructed
sequences for threshold 0.5 and no threshold, respectively, and
the recovery rates of the nearest neighbor sequence (NN) for
dataset MZ44-I (see Supplementary Table Sl for MZ44-2). In
almost all species, the amount of correctly predicted positions
is signiﬁcantly higher in the maxAlike reconstructions compared
with the Freq consensus sequences. As expected, for target species
with phylogenetically close neighbors, e.g. in the primates, the
improvement between ML and NN is small, but still signiﬁcant.
However, with increasing phylogenetic distance, the difference
between the reconstruction rates of both methods becomes bigger.
When requiring a nucleotide probability of at least 0.5, the prediction
quality increases on average for both ML and Freq and the
difference between ML and Freq/NN is much higher than without
the probability threshold. Similarly to the PSSM comparison, the
difference between ML and Freq/NN recovery rates becomes higher
for increasingly more distant species. The mean recovery rates across
all species are 82.1% for ML, 74.7% for Freq and 75.3% for NN.
In dataset MZ44-1 , the ML recovery rates reach a plateau of about
65% for more distant species, while Freq and NN drop down to 55%
when using a 50% threshold (Fig. 3a). Here, maxAlike can have up
to 10% higher recovery rates than Freq/NN. When no threshold is
used, the recovery rates for all methods drop more with increasing
tree distance, while ML still has a slight, but yet signiﬁcantly better
performance on average (Fig. 3b). The mean recovery rates without
threshold across all species are 79% for ML and 73.7% for Freq.
In the MZ44-2 dataset, the prediction performance is lower for all
methods compared with MZ44-I . However, the difference between
ML and both Freq and NN is slightly higher in MZ44-2. This is
due to the lower overall sequence conservation in the alignments,
which increases the impact of phylogenetic tree information on the
predictions.

A value of, e. g. 70 means that 70% of the nucleotides were predicted correctly. The T. 5
columns show recovery rates for only those sites with a nucleotide probability/relative
frequency above a 0.5 threshold, the ‘n/T’ columns show the recovery rates for
reconstructed sequences with highest probability/frequency nucleotides at each site (no
threshold). The ‘Dist.’ column shows the average distance to the nearest neighbor in
the tree. ‘Total nt’ shows the total number of reconstructed nucleotides for each species
and the ‘T%’ columns denote the percentage of sites exceeding the threshold. Bold-
faced maxAlike values are signiﬁcantly better (P < 0.05) than both values of Freq with
corresponding threshold and NN.

reconstructed by maxAlike (ML), frequency—based consensus (Freq) and

distance to the phylogenetically nearest neighbor. (a) threshold 0.5. (b) no

As expected, most of the species show an improved recovery
rate when using an alignment—speciﬁc gene tree compared with
the species tree. However, the improvement is very small for
most species. The largest increase observed is about 4% (see
Supplementary Tables S2 and S3), while the average increase of the
recovery rate is 0.78% (threshold 0.5) and 0.98 (no threshold) across
all species for MZ44-1. On the other hand, maxAlike reconstruction
performance decreases with increasing error levels in the input trees.
Figure 4a shows the average change of the total recovery rates in
MZ44-I for sequence reconstructions using trees with increasing
bin number, i.e. split distance to the reference species tree (S).

change is below 1% for both threshold 0.5/no threshold, but with
increasing bin number, the recovery rate drops by maximum 4%
on average across all species in bin 10. Supplementary Figure S5
shows the total recovery rates in each bin for all 44 species for dataset
MZ44-1. The horizontal bars indicate the recovery rates of Freq (0.5
and no threshold). Supplementary Figure S6 shows the distribution
of changes in the recovery rates for all species in each bin. These
results show that for trees having an increasingly disturbed topology
compared with the reference tree, the maxAlike prediction rate drops
to the level of the frequency consensus sequence or even below for
some of the species and this occurs on average for trees having a
split distance of 23 or higher (bin 7). See Supplementary Figures S8
and S9 for the results of MZ44-2. However, when using enough
sequence data for the tree inference in the ﬁrst place, the estimated
trees are sufﬁciently precise, so that maxAlike can make use of the
information in the tree for a better reconstruction performance and so
outperforms nearest—neighbor and frequency consensus sequences.
Supplementary Figure S4b shows the distribution of the split
distances for inferred trees. Even when using only three loci instead
of one for the tree construction, there is a signiﬁcant shift toward
a smaller split distance, i.e. a more accurate tree topology. This
becomes even more apparent as more sequences are used for the
tree inference. The majority of the trees we estimated from randomly
chosen loci have a split distance to the species tree of less than 23
(bins 1—6).

Similar results were observed for the datasets containing trees
with increasingly distorted branch lengths. For input trees in the
ﬁrst three bins with relative normal errors of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.25 only
a very small decrease in the total recovery rates is visible in all
species for maxAlike (see Supplementary Figures S11 and S12 for
the results of both datasets). When increasing the error to 0.5, the

recovery rates drop by 0.7% (threshold 0.5) and 0.5% (no threshold)
on average across all species. A relative error rate of 1.0 decreases
the average recovery rate by 2.2% (threshold 0.5) and 1.7% (no

performance drops down to the level of the frequency consensus for
6 of the 44 species (threshold 0.5) and 16 of 44 (no threshold) in
MZ44-I.

3.2 Primer design for unknown sequences

To measure the impact of an improved sequence reconstruction
on the quality of PCR primers, we compared the expected
melting temperature of the primer—template duplex to the actual
melting temperature depending on mismatches between the primer
and the template. Figure 6 shows the average difference of the
expected Tm and the Tm of the actually formed duplex for the primers
derived from maxAlike and Freq reconstructed sequences (both
threshold 0.5) and the nearest neighbor sequence (NN) for dataset
MZ44-I. Supplementary Tables S6 and S7 contain the average
number of mismatches per primer sequence and the averaged Tm
difference in each species for both datasets. For most species,
the number of mismatches is much lower for the primers derived
from the maxAlike reconstruction using the 0.5 threshold, compared
with sequence reconstructions without threshold. Correspondingly,
the Tm difference is also smaller. This difference is not as high
between the threshold and no threshold reconstructions of the Freq
method. In most species, the average Tm difference of the primers
from the maxAlike predictions is signiﬁcantly lower, compared with
primers from Freq and NN, in particular when using reconstructed
sequences with a threshold of 0.5. Across all species, the average Tm
difference is ~26% (~4.6°C) lower with the primers from maxAlike
compared with Freq, and ~30% (~5.6°C) lower compared with
NN. The higher the phylogenetic distance to the target species,

the larger the Tm difference becomes on average for all methods,
but also the gap between maxAlike and Freq/NN increases. The
Tm difference can be reduced up to 30%. In the closely related
primates, the difference between all methods is smaller, with NN
being almost as good as maxAlike, while Freq performs worse
(~9.5°C higher Tm difference than maxAlike). This observation
follows the results from the sequence reconstruction. While NN
performs well for target species with close neighbors, Freq is better
for more distant target species. maxAlike outperforms both since
it takes both the nearest neighbor and all other sequences into
account for the reconstruction. Note, however, that the reported
averaged Tm differences are biased toward lower values, since the
cases of dinucleotide/extreme position mismatches, which would
again reduce the melting temperature of the duplex, were not
included in the Tm calculation. This bias increases with a higher
phylogenetic distance of the target species and correspondingly a
higher number of mismatches in the primer sequence. One would
expect an ever higher gap between the maxAlike and the Freq/NN
Tm differences, since the latter have signiﬁcantly more of these
mismatch types. In some cases, it was not possible for Pr imer3
to select a primer pair according to our speciﬁcations, when using
the reconstructed sequences with the 0.5 threshold, because of a
high number of unpredicted (‘N’) nucleotides. This was usually
only a problem in short alignments and for species with a high
branch length to its nearest neighbor, e.g. Pteropus vampyrus or
Danio rerio. A reduced sequence reconstruction performance due
to less accurate tree topologies of the input trees translates also
into more mismatches in the selected primer sequences and thus in
an increased difference between actual and expected primer Tm.
Figure 4b shows the average increase of the Tm difference for
primers derived from reconstructed sequences across all species
using trees with increasing bin number, i.e. split distance to the
reference species tree (S). Supplementary Figures S7 and S10 show
the distribution of the changes in Tm difference for all species
in each bin for both datasets. We observe a maximum 1°C (9%)
increase of the average Tm difference in the ﬁrst 6 bins for MZ44-
I. For input trees with large topological errors (bin 10), the Tm
difference increases by 25°C (30%) on average across all species.
These results are similar to the sequence reconstruction, in that the
change is moderate for trees in the ﬁrst 5 bins, but becomes higher
with increasingly erroneous trees.

4 DISCUSSION

The maxAlike algorithm estimates the nucleotide probabilities at
each sequence position for an unknown sequence in a target
species using a combination of homology information from a
multiple sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree. The calculated
nucleotide probabilities can be used for homology search or for
reconstruction of sequences on which primer design can be made.
In a benchmark dataset, we demonstrated that the inclusion of
phylogenetic information in sequence reconstruction signiﬁcantly
improves the reconstruction accuracy compared with two standard
approaches. For the comparison to the ﬁrst standard approach,
frequency—based consensus sequences, the maxAlike reconstruction
rate is up to 10% higher in most target species, when using a suitable
probability threshold. Taking the closest available phylogenetic
neighbor (the second standard approach) as a prediction for the
target species yields poor results in many cases and is often worse

Fig. 6. Dataset MZ44-2: average differences of the expected and actual melting temperature T m of the primer—template duplex for primers derived from

than the frequency consensus. Taking the sequence of the closest
available phylogenetic neighbor as a prediction for the the target
species is often worse than the frequency consensus (26 out of
44 species, Table 1). However, the difference to maxAlike is not
large for sequence homologs in very proximate species.

On the other hand, the sequence reconstruction with maxAlike
also improves when homologs of closely related taxa are available.
In those cases, the reconstruction rate can reach as much as 99%
accuracy, and is better than both the nearest neighbor and frequency
consensus sequences. The better the reconstruction rate is, the better
the precision of homology search programs becomes, e. g. when
using PSSMs. Additionally, maxAlike provides information about
highly variable sites through the estimation of mutation rates for
each position. These positions could therefore be easily excluded
from the homology search or primer design. When using a
nucleotide probability threshold in the sequence reconstruction,
the primers generated from these reconstructed sequences have
signiﬁcantly less mismatches to their target complement, compared
with both the frequency consensus sequences as well as the
nearest neighbor sequences. From that follows a reduced deviation
from the expected melting temperature of the primer—template
duplex, which increases the chance of a successful PCR. In
some cases, e.g. for short sequences or distant target species,
a suitable primer pair could not be found, because not enough
positions exceed the chosen probability threshold. To compensate
for this, the threshold can successively be lowered or the
length of the primers could be reduced. Compared with primer
design using the two standard methods, frequency consensus and
nearest neighbor, primers designed from sequences reconstructed
by maxAlike on average exhibit a reduction of the difference
between the expected and real melting temperatures by 26%. As
expected in the regime of short evolutionary distances, we observe
that the nearest neighbor method is signiﬁcantly more accurate
than the frequency—based methods. Nevertheless, maxAlike yields
slightly better results. In the regime of large distances, where the
overall accuracy of all methods drop, the frequency—based approach

outperforms the nearest neighbor approach. Again maxAlike
performs best.

Our results show, that a general species tree already yields good
reconstruction results, but a slightly higher reconstruction rate can
still be obtained by using an optimized gene tree for the particular
gene family under study. If a gene tree is available, e. g. for ﬁlling
gaps in an otherwise complete sequence, the gene tree should be
preferred in order to maximize the number of correctly predicted
nucleotides. However, the exact position of the target species in
a certain gene tree is usually unknown, and the reconstruction of
the homolog is based on a general species tree or a tree inferred
from other genomic loci. Ideally, this tree is constructed by all
available sequence data from the target species, combined with the
homologs of these sequences in other closely related organisms.
Even if no general species tree is available, we observe that the
prediction performance of maxAlike is robust against the variations
in the input tree generated by randomly selecting genomic loci
for estimating the tree. Furthermore, we demonstrated that more
accurate tree topologies can easily be obtained by a small increase
in the number of loci that are used for the tree inference. The more
accurate the tree topology is, the more information from the tree
can be used for the sequence reconstruction by maxAlike and the
higher the prediction performance becomes, e.g. the accuracy of the
sequence reconstruction only decreases by 1% on average across all
species for 70% of the input trees in MZ44-I. The general robustness
against erroneous tree topologies in the sequence reconstruction
translates to the design of PCR primers, which in turn leads to
more accurately predicted primer sequences compared with the other
methods. The prediction accuracy has also been shown to be robust
against distortions in the branch lengths of the input tree. Of course,
maxAlike can also be used with phylogenetic trees from databases,
such as treebase (Piel et al., 2003) or TreeFam (Li et al., 2006).

Future directions include taking RNA structure explicitly into
account. Several studies showed that potential ncRNAs in genomic
sequence have altered their primary sequence while maintaining
their secondary structure and the sequence—based alignments are

(Torarinsson et al., 2006, 2008). This calls for an RNA version of
maxAlike, in which RNA structural alignments are used rather than
primary sequence alignments.

Abstract

Motivation: Combinatorial therapies have been under intensive research for cancer treatment. How-
ever, due to the large number of possible combinations among candidate compounds, exhaustive
screening is prohibitive. Hence, it is important to develop computational tools that can predict com-
pound combination effects, prioritize combinations and limit the search space to facilitate and accel-
erate the development of combinatorial therapies.

Results: In this manuscript we consider the NCl-DREAM Drug Synergy Prediction Challenge dataset
to identify features informative about combination effects. Through systematic exploration of differen-
tial expression profiles after single compound treatments and comparison of molecular structures of
compounds, we found that synergistic levels of combinations are statistically signiﬁcantly associated
with compounds’ dissimilarity in structure and similarity in induced gene expression changes. These
two types of features offer complementary information in predicting experimentally measured combi-
nation effects of compound pairs. Our findings offer insights on the mechanisms underlying different
combination effects and may help prioritize promising combinations in the very large search space.

1 Introduction

Designing effective therapies for cancer treatment is an important yet
challenging task. Although monotherapies are commonly used to treat
cancer (Joensuu, et al., 2001; Vogel, et al., 2002), they suffer from many
problems, such as acquired resistance and poor safety (LoRusso, et al.,
2012). Combinatorial therapies, by utilizing compounds impacting mul-
tiple biological processes simultaneously, have great potentials to over-
come these problems and are attracting growing interest in drug devel-
opment (Al-Lazikani, et al., 2012; Jia, et al., 2009). Indeed, there are
many effective combinations used in practice. For example, the combi-
nation of Lapatinib and Capecitabine can achieve improved efficacy in
breast cancer treatment (Geyer, et al., 2006). In this study we focus on
two-way combinations because most studies and available data to date

are on two-way combinations and yet all existing methods are still lim-
ited in their performance in predicting the effectiveness of two-way
combinations. Generally, when two compounds act together, their com-
bination effect can be categorized into three main types: additive, if the
effect of combination is equivalent to the sum of the effects of two com-
pounds acting individually; synergistic, if the combination effect is
greater than additive; and antagonistic, if the combination effect is less
than additive. Typically compound combination effects are inferred
through cell culture experiments, where cell viabilities under treatment
with compounds in combination and treatment with compounds individ-
ually are measured and compared. However, since the number of possi-
ble combinations grows rapidly with the number of compounds under
consideration, exhaustive experimental screening of all these combina-
tions is prohibitively costly. Therefore, it is very useful to develop com-
putational methods that can prioritize different combinations in order to

reduce the search space for screening experiments. There are inspiring
attempts made towards this goal (Guirnera and Sales-Pardo, 2013;
Huang, et al., 2013; Huang, et al., 2014; Li, et al., 2015; Pang, et al.,
2014; Zhao, et al., 2011). However, while it is known combination ef-
fects can be cell-line speciﬁc (Held, et al., 2013), most existing computa-
tional methods were trained using only the speciﬁc types of combination
effects (synergistic/additive/antagonistic) collected from literature re-
view or databases, without considering the cell lines they were tested on
or other experimental contexts. Besides, many of these methods rely
heavily on prior knowledge of drug combination mechanisms, which is
far ﬁom complete and accurate.

In this paper, we aim to identify features informative on combination
effects of compound pairs using the dataset from the NCI-DREAM Drug
Synergy Prediction Challenge (Bansal, et al., 2014). This DREAM chal-
lenge measured gene expression profiles of OCL—LY3 diffuse large B-
cell lymphoma cells pre- and post- 14 single compound treatments, and
experimentally evaluated the combination effects of 91 pairwise combi-
nations of these 14 compounds. In the original challenge, participants
proposed different methods to predict combination effects using gene
expression proﬁles, but no unanimous conclusion could be drawn on the
relation between synergistic effects and transcriptome changes induced
by single compounds (Bansal, et al., 2014). Although a few participants
considered compound chemical/molecular features such as structure, the
relevance of these features to combination effects was not demonstrated.
In this paper, we adopt the structural similarity of compounds deﬁned in
PubChem (Kim, et al., 2016) and consider four similarity measures for
gene expression changes resulting from single compound treatments. We
systematically explore whether the structural similarity and expression
similarity is associated with combination effects using PC-index and
resampled Spearman correlation (Bansal, et al., 2014). Because we are
interested in prioritizing compound pairs likely having synergistic ef-
fects, we also evaluate the area under the receiver operation characteris-
tic curve (AUC) for synergistic combination prediction using structural
similarity and expression similarity individually and jointly. For the
NCI-DREAM challenge data set, we ﬁnd that synergistic effect predic-
tion using gene expression similarity deﬁned with one of the four
measures outperforms the best method reported in the original challenge,
and that prediction using structural similarity also outperforms most of
the methods proposed for the original challenge (Bansal, et al., 2014).
Moreover, combining gene expression and structure information together
ﬁirther improves predictive power for synergistic effects. Our ﬁndings in
this paper may lead to better computational methods to prioritize com-
pound combinations and facilitate future drug development.

2 Methods

2.1 Data preprocessing

We analyzed the data distributed for the NCI-DREAM Drug Synergy
Prediction Challenge (Bansal, et al., 2014; Goswami, et al., 2015; Yang,
et al., 2015). In this project, the OCL-LY3 cell line was perturbed by 14
single compounds, each with 2 concentrations (ICzo’s of 24h and 48h),
and gene expression proﬁles of untreated samples, DMSO-treated
(DMSO was used as a control media) and single compound-treated sam-
ples were generated at three time points (6h, 12h and 24h after treat-
ment). All expression proﬁles were measured using the Human Genome
U219 96-Array plate (Affymetrix), in triplicate except that DMSO-
treated ones were in octuplicate. Quality-controlled and RMA-
normalized (Irizarry, et al., 2003) data (in log2 scale) were provided by

the Challenge. All 91 pairwise combinations of the 14 compounds
(14><13/2) were tested with each compound concentrated at its ICzo of
60h. Combination effects of these compound pairs were assessed using
the Bliss independence model (Bliss, 1939). Mean Excess over Bliss
(EOB) values (estimated from ﬁve replicates) were provided as a meas-
urement of the synergy levels and standard errors (SE) were also given to
quantify the uncertainties. We used these experimentally measured com-
bination effects as “gold standard” in our analysis.

We ﬁrst applied RUVr (Risso, et al., 2014) to remove potential batch
effects in gene expression measurements. We considered compounds,
concentrations and time points as treatment status (“wanted variation”)
and varied the number of hidden factors (“unwanted variation”) k from 1
to 40. Based on the relative log expression (RLE) plots (Figures 81 and
S2), we set k = 26 in our analysis. We also reported results with other
values of k in supplementary information (Figures 83-810 and Tables
81-85), which suggest that our results are quite robust to the speciﬁc
choice of k.

2.2 Structural similarity measure

We used substructure key-based 2D Tanimoto similarity score from the
PubChem database (Kim, et al., 2016) to quantify the structural similari-
ty between two compounds. PubChem generates a binary ﬁngerprint (an
ordered list of binary bits) to represent the presence or absence of specif-
ic chemical substructure for each compound. It then deﬁnes the similari-

ty score between two compounds as
AB

A + B — AB’
where AB is the count of bits shared by the two compounds, and A and B
are the counts of bits in the two compounds, respectively.

It can be seen from the above formula that the Tanimoto score is al-
ways between 0 and 1. According to PubChem, a Tanimoto score of
0.68 or greater is considered statistically signiﬁcant at the 95% signiﬁ-
cance level (Kim, et al., 2016).

Tanimoto score =

2.3 Gene expression similarity measures

We used the average of three/eight replicates to represent gene expres-
sion levels under each experimental condition. We then calculated the
fold changes between treatments (single compounds) and control
GDMSO). The following metrics were adopted to evaluate the global
differential expression similarities between two drugs.
0 Direction-based

This metric considers the concordance of the direction of gene expres-
sion changes (up or down) following single-compound treatments. It was
motivated by the second best performing method in the original chal-
lenge (Goswami, et al., 2015). However, unlike what was done there, we
did not assume a common core gene set for all compounds since differ-
ent compounds may impact different genes and pathways. Instead, we
selected out genes with large expression changes for each compound and
measured the concordance of two compounds on their corresponding
“signature” genes. Speciﬁcally, we discretized expression changes into
three levels: 0 for probes with fold changes within a certain range around
1 and thus viewed as unaffected by a compound; —1 and 1 for probes
with fold changes outside the range and considered down-regulated and
up-regulated, respectively. We then deﬁne the expression similarity
score between compound i and compound j as

231:1 fcu X ij,1
—n ,

where n is the total number of probes (48,789 in this dataset) and f cm is
the status (—1, 0 or 1) for probe I treated with compound i.

o GSEA-based
This metric was proposed in the context of constructing drug similari-
ty network with transcriptome data (Iorio, et al., 2010; Iorio, et al.,
2009). The original method (Iorio, et al., 2010; Iorio, et al., 2009) ﬁrst
ranks probes from the most up-regulated to the most down-regulated in
each of the six datasets measured at three time points and two concentra-
tions, and then merges the six lists using pair-wise Spearman’s Footrule,
Borda Merging Method and Kruskal Algorithm (Diaconis, 1977; Lin,
2010) into a uniﬁed ranked list hierarchically. Then for compounds i and
j, it calculates four Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
(Subramanian, et al., 2005) scores: ES,” and E53“, the enrichments of
compound j ’s top 1) probes and bottom q probes in compound i’s ex-
pression list; ESP” and ESjiq, the enrichments of compound i’s top 1)
probes and bottom q probes in compound i’s expression list. A distance
between i and j is deﬁned as:
 _  + ESjip _ ES'jW)
2 2
d” = 1 — 2
Since the values of ES ’5 are between —1 and 1, dij is between 0 and
2. In our analyses, we deﬁne the corresponding similarity score as:
dil-
1 _ 7,
which is between 0 to 1. We also calculated dij without merging the six
lists for each compound.
0 Pearson correlation-based
Under each treatment condition, we ranked all the probes according to
their absolute log2-transformed intensity differences, and then selected
top probes as signatures. We calculated the Pearson correlation between
two compounds’ expression proﬁles on all 48,789 probes as well as on
the union of their signature gene sets.
0 Spearman correlation-based
We also calculated the Spearman correlation between two com-
pounds’ expression proﬁles on all 48,7 89 probes as well as on the union
of their signature gene sets.

 

2.4 Evaluation of concordance between similarity-based
scores and synergistic levels of compound pairs

We used probabilistic concordance index (PC-index) and resampled

Spearman correlation to quantify the concordance between the similari-

ty-based scores and synergistic levels of compound pairs (Bansal, et al.,
2014).

2.4.1 PC-index

Suppose that there are a total of N compound pairs. Let the similarity-
based scores for compound pair n be $1,, and the experimentally meas-
ured EOB and its standard error be eobn and sen, then for two com-
pound pairs m and n, we ﬁrst compute

m= 1,2,'-',N—1
n=m+1,2,---,N

PC-index takes experimental errors into account when evaluating the
concordance between the predictions and the “gold standard”. It is sym-
metric around 0.5, i.e., if a prediction has pc-index pc, then ﬂipping it
over (exactly opposite order) gives pc-index 1 — pc. The largest value
(PCmax) is reached when the predictions are entirely concordant with
the “gold standard”. Due to noise terms, PCmax will not be 1 generally.
In this study,

PCmax z 0.901.

2.4.2 Resampled Spearman correlation

Similar to PC-index, resampled Spearman correlation accounts for un-
certainties of the experiment. It assumes that the experimental measure-
ment of mean EOB is noisy and follows a normal distribution, N (u, 02),
with u and 0 equal to the mean EOB and standard error obtained from
the experiment. For each compound pair n, we randomly sample a new
eobfl from N (um 0,3), and then calculated the Spearman correlation
between (p1,p2,---,pN) and (eob;,eob§,---,eob;§,). We repeat the pro-
cess for 10,000 times and use the mean of the 10,000 Spearman correla-
tions as a ﬁnal resampled Spearman correlation score rss.

2.4.3 Statistical signiﬁcance estimation

We simulated 10,000 independent random predictions (10,000 random
permutations of the 91 pairs) and calculated their PC-indices and
resampled Spearman correlations. We use these scores from random
predictions as the empirical null distributions for PC-index and
resampled Spearman correlation. Then we estimated the p-value of
PC — index and rss for each similarity-based prediction as

#(PC — indexnuu 2 PC — index)

2.5 Synergistic combination prediction

We treated compound pairs with experimentally measured synergistic
combination as positive and all others as negative, and adopted logistic
regression models to predict synergistic combinations using gene expres-
sion similarity and structural similarity, individually and jointly. We
performed 100 rounds of 3-fold cross validation. In each round, we esti-
mated the cross-validation AUC using trapezoidal method to integrate
the ROC curve. We reported the mean AUC over 100 rounds for each
classiﬁer as an evaluation of its performance. To assess the statistical
signiﬁcance of improvement brought by structural information compared
to using gene expression only, we randomly permutated the structural
similarity scores of the 91 pairs 1,000 times, and for each permutation,
we calculated the mean AUC (over 100 rounds of cross validation) of the
classiﬁer combining the permutated structural similarity score and the
original gene expression similarity score. We calculated the p-value of
AUC improvement as

P _ value improvement by structure

_ #(AUCexpression+permutated structure > AUCexpression+structure)

_ 1,000 '

Similarly, we calculated the p—value of AUC improvement by adding
gene expression information as

 

P — Value improvement by expression
_ #(AUCstructure+permutated expression > AUCexpression+structure)

_ 1,000

3 Results

We evaluated the structural similarity of the 14 compounds and also
compared their effects on the transcriptome of the OCL-LY3 cell line.
Following the performance evaluation methods of the original DREAM
challenge (Bansal, et al., 2014), we used PC-index and resampled
Spearman correlation coefﬁcient to measure the associations between
these similarity scores and the synergistic levels. Additionally, we evalu-
ated these scores’ ability to predict synergistic combinations using AUC
from cross validation.

3.1 Structural similarity negatively correlates with syner-
gism

A negative correlation can be observed between EOB for two com-
pounds against their structural similarity scores (Figure 1). The PC-index
between EOB and the negative structural similarity score was 0.586 (p-
value 0.0047), and the resampled Spearman correlation between them
was 0.251 (p-value 0.0041). This result outperforms most of the meth-
ods in the original challenge (Table S6). It indicates that synergistic
effect is signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with structural similarity.

Structural Similarity

Fig. 1. EOB against structural similarity of compounds. Activities of compound pairs
are discretized into three states as deﬁned in the original Challenge: synergistic (green
circle), additive (blue triangle) and antagonistic (red square).

In addition, there is an interesting pattern behind this overall negative
correlation. In this dataset, compound pairs with EOB > 0 and EOB/SE
> 2 were classiﬁed as having synergistic effects; similarly, those with
EOB < 0 and EOB/SE < —2 were deﬁned to be antagonistic; and the
rest of the combinations were classiﬁed as additive (Bansal, et al., 2014).
We observed that none of the compound pairs with large structural simi-
larity scores (e. g., > 0.6) have synergistic effects, while the combination
effects of the compound pairs with small structural similarity scores
spread across all the three classes. We will discuss possible mechanisms
for this phenomenon in the Discussion and Conclusion section.

3.2 Gene expression similarity positively correlates with
synergism

We considered four measures for the similarity of gene expression

changes brought by two compounds individually and all the similarity

scores showed positive correlations with EOB.

We deﬁned the ﬁrst similarity score based on the directions (up or
down) of gene expression changes. We set different thresholds on fold
changes to deﬁne signatures and calculated the PC-indices and
resampled Spearman correlations between EOB and the direction-based
similarity measurements (Figure 2 (a-b)). In all situations we considered,
the PC-indices were greater than 0.5 and the resampled Spearman corre-
lations were greater than 0, which indicate positive correlations between
synergistic level and gene expression similarity. Taking all genes into

account (green bars in Figure 2), only weak correlations could be ob-
served; by excluding genes with small changes, signals in most of the six
datasets (measured at three time points and two concentrations) became
strong. The largest PC-index and resampled Spearman correlation were
0.618 (p-value 0.0003) and 0.338 (p-value 0.0002), respectively.

Resampled Spearman correlations of direction-based gene expression similarity
scores. When calculating the similarity scores, we considered all probes as well as probes
with fold changes beyond certain ranges only (shown in different colors). *P-value <
0.05;1 P-value < 0.01.

The second gene expression similarity score we considered was based
on GSEA. We set different cutoffs to deﬁne top and bottom signature
genes and the resulting PC-indices and resampled Spearman correlations
between these expression similarities and EOB were shown in Figure 3
(a—b). Again, we could observe positive correlations between EOB and
these expression similarities in all cases. Here the largest PC-index and
resampled Spearman correlation we got were 0.574 (p-value 0.0125)
and 0.213 (p-value 0.0112), respectively.

The third and fourth expression similarities we considered were based
on the more conventional Pearson and Spearman correlations. Similar to
what we did earlier, besides considering all the probes, we also selected
strong signals (probes with the largest expression changes under the
treatment of each single compound) and calculated the correlations only
on these probes. We presented the PC-indices and resampled Spearman
correlations between EOB and these two correlation-based scores in
Figures 4 (a—b) and 5 (a-b), respectively. These two expression similarity
measures also had positive correlations with synergistic levels. The
largest PC-index and the largest resampled Spearman correlation we got
for the Pearson correlation-based similarity were 0.582 (p-value 0.0068)
and 0.245 (p-value 0.0046), respectively. The largest PC-index and
resampled Spearman correlation we got for Spearman correlation-based
similarity were 0.571 (p-value 0.0156) and 0.206 (p-value 0.0147),
respectively.

Similar to structural similarity, we observed (Figure 81 1) that it is less
likely for the compound pairs with relatively small gene expression
similarity scores to have synergistic effects, while for the compound
pairs with relatively large gene expression similarity scores, their combi-
nation effects vary case by case.

In addition, we also note the following two observations. First, ac-
cording to our results, all six datasets have certain information that could
be utilized, and no dosage or exposure time is “optim ” in terms of
transcriptome concordance with experimentally measured synergistic

levels. Second, we found that signals can usually be strengthened when
we focus on a subset of signature genes inﬂuenced most by the perturba-
tions rather than considering all of them together. This is reasonable as
many genes may not be impacted by individual drug perturbations and
introduce noises.

3.3 Structural similarity and gene expression similarity
provide complementary information on synergistic
combination prediction

Since compound pairs with synergistic effects are most worthy of ﬁirther
investigation, we trained logistic regression models to predict synergistic
combinations using structural similarity score, each of the four gene
expression similarity scores, individually and jointly. The AUCs estimat-
ed from 100 rounds 3-fold cross-validations are listed in Table 1 (a-e).

It can be seen that most classiﬁers achieved satisfactory results in
identifying synergistic combinations. Moreover, using structural similari-
ty and gene expression similarity together does lead to greater predictive
power. Speciﬁcally, for direction-based gene expression similarity
scores, combining them together with structural similarity, in all the 30
cases (6 datasets X 5 thresholds), 28 had larger AUCs compared with
using expression similarity alone (all with p-values < 0.05), and 23 had
larger AUCs compared with using structural similarity alone (22 with p-
values < 0.05); for GSEA-based gene expression similarity scores,
among the 28 cases (7 datasets X 4 thresholds), combining them together
with structural similarity outperformed using expression similarity alone
and using structural similarity alone in 28 cases (all with p-values
< 0.05) and 19 cases (8 with p-values < 0.05), respectively; for Pearson
correlation-based gene expression similarity scores, when using two
features, 29 out of 30 cases (6 datasets X 5 thresholds) had larger AUCs
than using expression similarity alone (all with p-values < 0.05) and 15
had larger AUCs than using structural similarity alone (7 with p-values
< 0.05); for Spearman correlation-based gene expression similarity

scores, AUCs in all the 30 cases (6 datasets X 5 thresholds) were larger
when using both features than using expression similarity alone (all with
p-values < 0.05), and AUCs in 13 cases were larger than using structural
similarity alone (6 with p-values < 0.05). Hence, we concluded for most
of these gene expression similarity scores, their predictions for synergis-
tic combinations were signiﬁcantly improved when incorporating struc-
tural information. Especially in the cases where expression similarity
scores were less informative (Figures 2-5 and Table 1), the increments
were remarkable; as it is not always easy to identify an “optimal” dos-
age/duration in transcriptome effect measurements, we believe including
structural information would beneﬁt synergistic combination prediction
greatly. Besides, for most cases where gene expression similarity
demonstrated certain power to predict synergistic combinations, combin-
ing them and structural similarity together did lead to better performance
over using structural similarity alone, too. Additionally, we found that
the dataset measured at 6h post-treatment with ICzo’s of 24h was most
useﬁil here compared to others, a phenomenon not observed when exam-
ining the scores’ correlations to EOBs (Section 3.2). We investigated the
expression similarity scores on this dataset and found that most of them
indeed could separate out synergistic pairs from the rest more effective-
ly, as compared to measurements obtained from other datasets, synergis-
tic pairs tend to be more concentrated on the relatively large gene ex-
pression similarity parts using these scores; while PC-index and
resampled Spearman correlation emphasize more on the global concord-
ance between the similarity score and EOBs, such signal was diluted.

In summary, we observed that both structural similarity and gene ex-
pression similarity are informative to predict synergistic effects; and
these two types of features provide complementary information.

4 Discussion and Conclusion

Developing combinatorial therapies for cancer treatment has attracted
increasing attention due to their great potentials as compared to mono-
therapies. One major challenge to develop combinatorial therapies is the
large search space of possible combinations, therefore computationally
predicting combination effects and prioritizing combinations is vitally
important. In this paper, we have analyzed the experimentally measured
91 combinations of 14 compounds from the NCI-DREAM Drug Synergy
Prediction Challenge to identify features that are informative on combi-
nation effects.

We observed that structural similarity is statistically signiﬁcantly neg-
atively correlated with synergism. There has been previous work utiliz-
ing structural similarity to model compound combination effects, based
on the assumption that if the combination of compound A and compound
B has a speciﬁc effect, compounds having similar structure to compound
A (B) tend to have the same interaction with compound B (A) (e.g. (Vilar,
et al., 2012)). Compared with these work and several methods in the
original challenge, we systematically investigated the relation between
structural similarity and synergism. We hypothesize that the negative

correlation we observed may be caused by “competitive binding”
(Cokol, et al., 2011; Jia, et al., 2009), i.e., when two compounds bind to
similar targets they tend to have antagonistic or additive effects due to
competing and interfering interactions between them. Speciﬁcally, when
two compounds have similar structures (i.e. many share substructures),
they more likely interact with the same protein sites or perturb the same
biological processes, where competition exists, and reduces the chance
of synergistic effects. On the other hand, compound pairs with distinct
structures (lower structural similarity scores) can interact with different
proteins or have varied functions, where there is no strong competition
for “resources”; depending on the biological processes they inﬂuence
and genomic context of the cell line they work on, their combination
effects can be synergistic, additive or antagonistic.

We also found a statistically signiﬁcant positive association between
synergism and the similarity of gene expression changes caused by sin-
gle compounds. This association is robust to the four different similarity
measures we considered on all six gene expression proﬁles. We hypothe-
size that two compounds leading to different changes on gene expres-
sions may offset each other’s effects when applied together, thus are less
likely able to “collaborate” to generate synergistic effects. On the other
hand, if two compounds lead to similar gene expression changes, they
may not have such “neutralizing” problem and hence are more likely to
be synergistic; yet, the actual effects in such cases can vary depending on
the interactions of different biological processes affected by the two
compounds.

In addition, we found both gene expression similarity and structural
similarity are predictive of synergistic combinations. More importantly,
these two distinct similarity scores provided complementary information
on synergistic effect predictions; when utilized together, the performance
can be ﬁirther improved. Besides classifying compound combinations as
synergistic/non-synergistic, similarly we also observed complementary
informativeness of gene expression and structural similarity in the three-
class (synergistic, additive and antagonistic) classiﬁcation as well (5 S3-
85). Our ﬁndings in this paper should be useﬁil for prioritizing com-
pound combinations. They also provide insights for us to ﬁirther investi-
gate the mechanisms behind various combination effects.

There are several directions worth explorations in ﬁiture studies. First,
for compound structural similarity scores, we used 2D information here
as it is robust and often generates superior results in activity prediction
(Maggiora, et al., 2014). In the ﬁiture, when more accurate descriptions
of 3D compound structures and reliable metrics of 3D structural similari-
ty are available, we can carry out similar analysis based on 3D infor-
mation. Second, we considered gene expression similarity deﬁned on
individual genes in this paper. Since genes are not isolated in biological
systems, better measures may be deﬁned by taking gene-gene interac-
tions into account. Finally, in addition to structure and expressions, other
types of molecular and biological features may be investigated and prove
useﬁil in predicting combination effects.

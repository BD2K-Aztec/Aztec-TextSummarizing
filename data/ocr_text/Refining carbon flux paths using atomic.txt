ABSTRACT

Motivation: Pathway analysis tools are a powerful strategy to analyze
‘omics’ data in the field of systems biology. From a metabolic per-
spective, several pathway definitions can be found in the literature,
each one appropriate for a particular study. Recently, a novel pathway
concept termed carbon flux paths (CFPs) was introduced and bench-
marked against existing approaches, showing a clear advantage for
finding linear pathways from a given source to target metabolite.
CFPs are simple paths in a metabolite—metabolite graph that satisfy
typical constraints in stoichiometric models: mass balancing and
thermodynamics (irreversibility). In addition, CFPs guarantee carbon
exchange in each of their intermediate steps, but not between the
source and the target metabolites and consequently false positive
solutions may arise. These pathways often lack biological interest,
particularly when studying biosynthetic or degradation routes of a me-
tabolite. To overcome this issue, we amend the formulation in CFP, so
as to account for atomic fate information. This approach is termed
atomic CFP (aCFP).

Results: By means of a side-by-side comparison in a medium scale
metabolic network in Escherichia Coli, we show that aCFP provides
more biologically relevant pathways than CFP, because canonical
pathways are more easily recovered, which reflects the benefits of
removing false positives. In addition, we demonstrate that aCFP can
be successfully applied to genome-scale metabolic networks. As the
quality of genome-scale atomic reconstruction is improved, methods
such as the one presented here will undoubtedly be of value to inter-
pret ‘omics’ data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Systems biology aims at modeling a wide assortment of biolo-
gical phenomena from a holistic molecular perspective (Kitano,
2002). Analysis of high-throughput ‘omics’ data is typically in-
tricate and requires sophisticated techniques assisting their inter-
pretation and understanding. For this purpose, pathway analysis
tools constitute a powerful strategy, as there is strong experimen-
tal evidence supporting the view that many cellular processes are
organized into pathways (Stelling et al., 2002). In particular, bio-
chemistry textbooks detail a wide list of well-known (canonical)
metabolic pathways, which can now be computationally accessed

from different databases and analyzed in different scenarios
(Kanehisa et al., 2012; Keseler et al., 2009).

The outbreak of genome-scale metabolic networks has evi-
denced that it is not possible to represent all the metabolic
phenotypes using a small set of canonical pathways. Intending
to increase the number and diversity of pathways, a number of
mathematical pathway definitions can be found in the literature
(Planes and Beasley, 2008). For each scenario under study, se-
lecting the appropriate definition is crucial so as to obtain rele-
vant insights (Faust et al., 2009; de Figueiredo et al., 2009a).
Defining a pathway concept representing too many biological
mechanisms may be counterproductive due to the underlying
computational demand. In this light, two sides of the same
coin are the pathway definitions based on graph theory (Arita,
2000) and elementary ﬂux modes (EFMs) (Schuster et al., 2000).
Although the former is calculated based on classical graph theory
(Dijkstra, 1959), the latter requires less efﬁcient algebraic tech-
niques (de Figueiredo et al., 2009b; Kamp and Schuster, 2006;
Rezola et al., 2013; Terzer and Stelling, 2008). However, EFMs
fulfill additional biological constraints, e. g. mass balance, leading
to more biologically relevant results. It is worth mentioning that,
in addition to EFMs, we can find in the literature similar path-
way defrnitions, such as generating ﬂux modes (Rezola et al.,
2011) or extreme pathways (Price et al., 2003). Furthermore,
additional examples of metabolic pathway definitions based on
graph theory can also be found (Lim and Wong, 2012).

Recently, carbon ﬂux paths (CFPs) (Pey et al., 2011) were
introduced so as to account for the advantages of both defin-
itions. This approach searches for paths in a graph of metabol-
ites, where arcs represent an effective carbon exchange in at least
one enzyme-catalyzed reaction. In addition, as in the case of
EFMs, additional biophysical constraints are imposed, namely
mass balance and thermodynamic restrictions. CFPs approach is
an effective tool to determine linear pathways from a given
source to a target metabolite, as it overcomes combinatorial
issues found in EFMs approach. CFPs also take advantage of
the inherent versatility of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to
integrate gene expression and protein abundance data as well as
metabolomics data (Pey et al., 2013).

Despite the potential and versatility of CFPs, there is still
room for improvement. In particular, while the underlying
graph of metabolites guarantees carbon exchange in each step
of the path, this is not always achieved between the source and
target metabolites and false-positive solutions may arise. As dis-
cussed in Pey et a]. (2011), these solutions lack biological signifi-
cance, especially when studying biosynthetic or degradation
mechanisms.

In order to overcome this issue, the CFP formulation is here
extended to ensure that a ﬁxed number of carbon atoms from the
source reach the target metabolite, in line with Pitkanen et a].
(2009) and Heath et a]. (2010). To do so, we integrate atomic
tracing data for reactions into the model. In other words, for a
biochemical reaction we require precise information indicating in
which position in a product each carbon atom from a substrate
ends. This information is growing day by day and is currently
available in different reconstructions. These reconstructions can
be manually curated (Suthers et al., 2007) or computed by auto-
matic methods (Mu et al., 2007; Ravikirthi et al., 201 l). The use of
in silico (automatically) generated databases entails sacriﬁcing ac-
curacy, but increases the number of reactions that can be con-
sidered. Based on this information, we show that the atomic
extension of CFP presented here (aCFP) provides more biologic-
ally relevant pathways than the original CFP deﬁnition.

2 METHODS

For a metabolic network under consideration, we denote R and C the set
of reactions and compounds, respectively. We deﬁne Sc, as the stoichio-
metric coefﬁcient associated with metabolite c in reaction r.

The constraints corresponding to the metabolic ﬂuxes (vr) remain as in
Pey et al., (2011). Metabolites are divided into two sets: internal (1) and
external (E). For metabolites in I, steady-state condition is applied,
namely Equation (1). Metabolites in E are not necessarily balanced,
but consumption is only allowed to the subset of metabolites in the
growth media (Em), see Equation (2). We also include the binary variable
2,, being equal to one if reaction r is active and zero otherwise. This
relationship is represented in Equation (3) where N is a large scalar rep-
resenting the maximum ﬂux value. Finally, note that each reversible re-
action is split into two irreversible reactions where B = {(A,u)| reaction A
and reaction it are the reverse of each other}. Equation (4) prevents a
solution with a reversible reaction activated in both directions.

We brieﬂy introduce a subset of the path constraints included in Pey
et al. (2011). As we shall see below, constraints removed from the previ-
ous formulation are not required when atomic tracing data is incorpo-
rated into the model.

We have binary variable uij, being equal to one if the are linking the
metabolites i and j is present in the obtained pathway and zero otherwise.
Note here that we only include in the graph arcs between those metab-
olites exchanging carbon atom(s) in at least one reaction in R.

Equation (5) ensures that one are leaves the source (0:) and one are
reaches the target (,8) metabolites. Similarly, Equation (6) guarantees that
no arcs reach and leave or and ,8. This equation is not applied when
looking for a cyclic pathway, namely 0: = ,8. Equation (7) prevents revisit-
ing a metabolite so branched solutions are not allowed in the calculated

pathway.

In Pey et a]. (2011), we forced carbon exchange between intermediate
metabolites in the path, however, carbon ﬂux between or and ,8 was not
ensured. We overcome this issue by going one level of complexity further,
namely modeling the fate of carbon atoms. The information describing
the movement of a carbon atom is represented by atom mapping matrices
(AMM) (Zupke and Stephanopoulos, 1994). These matrices have been
manually annotated for medium scale metabolic networks comprising
hundreds of reactions (Suthers et al., 2007). There are also algorithms
calculating the fate of an atom within a reaction in genome-scale meta-
bolic networks (Latendresse et al., 2012; Ravikirthi et al., 2011).
However, further research is required to improve the accuracy of these
algorithms.

Below we show how to extend CFPs so as to assure effective carbon
exchange between or and ,8 by including carbon fate information into the
model. Note how a graph of metabolites exchanging carbon atoms
(Fig. 1B) is less informative than a graph where nodes are carbon
atoms (Fig. 1C). We describe below this carbon atom graph.

Let us deﬁne A as the set of carbon atoms in the metabolic network
under study and Ac the set containing all the carbon atoms of a particular
metabolite c. Figure 1D includes the sets described above for the Pyruvate
kinase (PYK) reaction except for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and ad-
enine dinucleotide phosphate (ADP).

In Pey et a]. (2011), dijr was deﬁned to be equal to one if at least one
carbon atom from metabolite 1' reaches metabolite j in reaction r.
Similarly to dijr, we introduce here the coefﬁcient elmr, being equal to
one if carbon atom 1 reaches m in reaction r and zero otherwise. Both
coefﬁcients are closely related, in particular, if 16A,, meAj and elmrzl
then dijr = 1, whereas the opposite is not always true. Therefore, if El r e R
/ elm: 1, we deﬁne an are between I and m.

In analogy with u,-,-, we introduce the binary variable wlm, which is
equal to one if the atomic are connecting carbon atoms 1 and m is
active in the obtained path and zero otherwise.

Equation (8) ensures that the number of incoming arcs is equal to the
number of outgoing arcs for each carbon atom in A except for those
belonging to the source and target metabolites, i.e. oz and ,8. Equation
(8) encompasses original formulation in Pey et al. (2011), where this
constraint was applied in the metabolic graph.

In addition, we relate u,—,- and wlm through Equation (9). In essence, this
constraint ensures that if wlm is active in the path and [6A,- and meAj, then
u,—,- is also in the path. Notice that Equation (9) links in one equality
constraint the carbon atom level with the metabolite level. Q ﬁxes the
number of atoms reaching the target from the source metabolite, in con-
sequence Q is an integer >0. The activation of a metabolic are (u,—,) implies
the activation of Q of its underlying atomic arcs (wlm). Therefore, with
Equations (5)—(9), we guarantee in each intermediate metabolic step that
Q carbons from the source are transported.

Atomic trace data and carbon flux paths

 

It is important to notice how constraints (5)—(9) allows us to determine
a metabolic path that ensures carbon exchange from source at to target ,8.

By means of Equation (10), we impose the constraint that if an atomic
arc turns out to be active in the solution, at least one metabolic reaction
containing it should be active. Note that, through this equation, we have
connected the path and stoichiometric layers.

Equation (11) is the objective function that guides the optimization
process. As in Pey et a]. (2011), we will search for the shortest path. In
particular, we will minimize the number of active arcs appearing in the
pathway.

Integer programing allows us to enumerate a predeﬁned number of
paths (K) in an ascending length order by including Equation (12), where
U; is equal to u,—,- in the kth solution. Here we enumerate paths at the
metabolic level (uij) rather than at the atomic level (wlm). In particular,
note how a particular metabolic path may comprise many underlying
atomic pathways. For example, in Figure 1C there are three atomic path-
ways between Phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) and Pyruvate (PYR), but
only one metabolic path. A deeper discussion highlighting the differences
can be found in Section 3. Aiming at obtaining each metabolic pathway
only once, we enumerate them at the metabolic level, namely by means
of u,-,-.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Recovering canonical pathways with aCFP

As for appraising the performance of the methodology intro-
duced here, we perform a side-by-side comparison between
aCFP and CFP. For completeness, we included the results
coming from a pure atomic graph, i.e. path resulting from the
carbon graph (Fig. 1C). We referred to this last group as atomic
paths (AP) approach. In order to analyze the performance of AP
approach, we modiﬁed Equation (12) to enumerate at the atomic
level rather than at the metabolic level; i.e. based on wlm instead
of 

We used the imPSl485 model, which constitutes one of the
more extensive metabolic networks including manually curated
AMMs (Suthers et al., 2007). In particular, this network involves
several metabolic pathways in Escherichia coli, comprising 317
reactions and 270 metabolites after including exchanges and
splitting reversible reactions. To build the metabolite graph
for CFP as deﬁned in Pey et al. (2011), we used AMMs in
Suthers et al. (2007), as highlighted in methods section (16A,,

meAj and elmrzl then d,-,- :1). Results shown below were

obtained using the general growth media deﬁned in the
imPS1485 model.

The performance of aCFP was evaluated in the light of 18
canonical metabolic pathways. These pathways are a subset of
the 40 pathways used in the validation of the CFP approach (Pey
et al., 2011), particularly those included in the imPSl485 meta-
bolic model. Two reasons led us to discard a canonical pathway
from the original set of 40 pathways: (i) absence of some of its
intermediate metabolites and/or reactions in the imPSl485
model; (ii) inability to ﬂow in steady state. In order to maximize
the number of pathways considered, we performed some slight
modiﬁcations. For instance, some reactions are lumped in
imPS1485 and, in consequence, some intermediate steps of the
canonical pathway must be lumped so as to match with the
corresponding pathway in imPSl485. So, 18 is the maximum
number we can consider given the limitations in imPS1485.
The full set of pathways can be found in the Supplementary
Material.

Overall, each one of these 18 pathways is deﬁned by a se-
quence of several metabolites, so we assume that the pathway
is recovered when the calculated solution and the canonical path-
way are the same in terms of this sequence of intermediate me-
tabolites. Note also that the set of constraints is particularized
for each canonical pathway, deﬁned by a distinct pair of source/
target metabolites, i.e. oz and ,8.

As discussed in the Section 2, ILP allows us to enumerate
pathways in increasing length order. It is typical that solutions
with the same length exist; these will be enumerated in an arbi-
trary order depending on several factors, e.g. ILP solver, the
computer, the order of the constraints. Therefore, the side-by-
side comparison should be carried out in terms other than based
on the position in which the canonical pathway is recovered (here
by position we mean the solution at which the pathway is found,
e.g. position 10 means that the pathway is found at the 10th
solution). In particular, we perform the side-by-side comparison
using a position interval in which the solutions of equal length to
the canonical pathway are computed. For that we introduce p—
and p+, which represent the position of the ﬁrst and last com-
puted solution with equal length to the canonical pathway. The
reader should note here that the lower the values of p‘ and p+
and the narrower the interval [p_, p+], the better the method is at
recovering canonical pathways. For the sake of clarity, we rep-
resent p‘ and p+ by means of a bar graph. In addition, the
position in which the canonical pathway was recovered is repre-
sented with a dot. Note that if p‘ is equal to p+, the bar is
reduced to a point which must correspond to that in which the
canonical pathway under request was recovered, i.e. indicated
with a dot.

We include three bars per pathway, namely one per approach:
aCFP white bar, CFP dark gray bar and AP light gray bar.
When recovering pathways with aCFP we impose that, at
least, half of the carbon atoms from the source reach the
target when the source has more carbons than the target or
vice versa when the target has more carbons, except in the case
of the pentose phosphate pathway in which only two carbons
from the source reaches the target by means of the canonical
pathway. Finally, this comparison is carried out for each of the
18 pathways and is presented in Figure 2.

ginine biosynthesis; (N), threonine degradation; (0) pentose phosphate
pathway; (P) glycolysis; (Q) glyoxylate cycle; (R) TCA cycle

 

For example, taking the pathway in Figure 2Q as an example,
note that aCFP recovers the corresponding canonical solution,
namely the Glyoxylate cycle, between the third and the ﬁfth so-
lutions. In other words, under aCFP there are only
(5— 3+ l)=3 pathway solutions with the same length as the
Glyoxylate cycle pathway. In particular, under the simulated
computational conditions, this cycle was recovered as the third
solution (black dot). CFP approach will recover it within the
intervals third to seventh, being recovered in the ﬁfth solution.
Finally, AP needs 26 solutions before recovering the Glyoxylate
cycle, obtaining pathways of the same length between the 2lst
and the 40th solutions.

First, we analyze the differences between aCFP and CFP.
Both approaches show a similar behavior, however the white
bars for aCFP are always equal or better than the dark gray
bars for CFP. In particular, M and R pathways are always re-
covered earlier via aCFP, whereas in P and Q pathways aCFP
outperforms CFP in most cases. This conﬁrms that including the
AMM information into CFP helps in calculating the canonical
solutions faster. In contrast, signiﬁcant differences arise when
enumerating paths at the atomic level rather than at the meta-
bolic level. It is clear that AP needs more solutions to assure that
the canonical pathway is recovered.

Aiming at understanding the mechanisms leading to the dif-
ferences in Figure 2, we now examine the ﬁrst solutions obtained
by CFP and aCFP, respectively, when recovering the arginine
biosynthesis pathway (Fig. 3A and B), corresponding to the

bons from L—Glu reaches L—Arg. (C) atomic pathways arising from the

pathway M in Figure 2. In particular, we highlight the mechan-
isms captured by aCFP and overlooked by CFP.

As discussed above, CFP guarantees effective carbon exchange
between its constituents but not between the source and the
target metabolites. This is illustrated in Figure 3A, where it can
be observed that no carbon atom from L—Glu (source) reaches
L-Arg (target). In Figure 3B we present the ﬁrst pathway ob-
tained by the aCFP approach, which is precisely the canonical
pathway. This pathway conserves three atoms from the source to
the target metabolite. It should be pointed out that mappings
from Suthers et al. (2007) may involve errors, i.e. in Figure 3A
the third carbon of L-Glu is being decarboxylated which usually
takes place at the ﬁrst carbon. Note, however, that developing an
error-free atomic fate database goes beyond the scope of this
article.

Figure 3C shows six atomic paths for the same metabolic so-
lution, namely the glycogen biosynthesis (Fig. 2B). However,
most applications in systems biology demand information re-
garding the active metabolites and enzymes. Therefore, enumer-
ating solutions as done by aCFP prevents redundancy without
loss of relevant information.

Summarizing, we have shown here that extending CFP to pre-
vent solutions with no carbon ﬁux between the source and target
metabolites facilitates the recovery of canonical pathways. We
expect the differences between aCFP and other approaches to
increase with the size of the metabolic network under study and
when all the carbon fates are included. However, several ques-
tions arise as to the feasibility of applying aCFP to genome-scale
metabolic networks. In the next section, we shall inquire if ex-
tending the scope of aCFP to large metabolic networks is com-
putationally feasible.

3.2 Genome-scale metabolic network

We considered here the E. Coli genome-scale metabolic recon-
struction presented in Feist et al. (2007). We adopted this net-
work on account of the recent publication of its computationally
generated atomic fate reconstruction (Ravikirthi et al., 2011).

Unfortunately, these in silico methods still require further re-
search so as to provide a completely error-free atomic recon-
struction. However, the data in Ravikirthi et al., 2011 can be
used for testing the computation times of aCFP in genome-
scale networks, which are not severely affected by atomic map-
ping errors. In addition, in order to reduce the impact of errors in
the comparison between aCFP and CFP, the carbon graphs for
both approaches were deﬁned based on the same set of AMMs,
keeping in mind that if leA,, meAj and em: 1 then a’,,-,= 1.

Summarizing, this metabolic network comprises a total of
1972 metabolites and 3234 reactions (after the splitting of revers-
ible reactions) leading to a system of aCFP equations with
around 75 000 constraints to be satisﬁed by 35000 variables.
Figure 4A compares the accumulated computational time
required by aCFP and CFP to calculate 1000 paths between
glucose (D-Glc) and Pyruvate (Pyr). These pathways were calcu-
lated in a regular laptop (Intel Core i5-2.53 GHz and 4GB of
RAM) using the IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.5 solver, which reduces
the problem to 13 834 constraints and 12660 variables through
automatic algebraic manipulation/substitution. Particularly,
Figure 4A shows that aCFP calculated 1000 paths in ~4 h, on
average one path every 15 3. Although aCFP turned out to be
around two and ﬁve times slower than CFP when Q=1 and
Q: 3, respectively, it is clear that this result shows that aCFP
can be applied in genome-scale networks as the computational
time required is not excessive.

For the same biological question, i.e. pathways from D-Glc to
Pyr in E. coli genome-scale metabolic network, Figure 4B repre-
sents the number of solutions of a particular length using aCFP
(Q=l and Q23) and CFP, respectively. Note that as we are
enumerating pathways in ascending length order, the computa-
tion of solutions of a particular length implies the previous com-
putation of shorter solutions. Differences are clear. For example,
we found 411 paths of length 12 with CFP, 67 with aCFP when
Q=1 and only 28 when Q=3. These differences increase as
pathway lengths increase, e.g. CFP was unable to enumerate
all paths of length 13 within the ﬁrst 1000 solutions, while
aCFP computed all solutions of length 19 for Q = 3.

After a general inspection of Figure 4B, we can conclude that
the number of feasible pathways is dramatically reduced after
including atomic mapping information. In particular, the path-
ways calculated by CFP but neglected by aCFP are, precisely,
those not guaranteeing carbon exchange between the source and
the target metabolites. It is important to note that such pathways
are not biologically relevant. We also emphasize the importance

of Q, which determines both the quality and quantity of feasible
pathways. We found that as Q increases, the number of feasible
pathways is also considerably reduced.

Overall, we can conclude that aCFP improves on CFP in
terms of the ability to generate relevant pathways as the network
size increases.

4 DISCUSSION

Pathway analysis tools are a powerful strategy to study meta-
bolic processes in the context of ‘omics’ data. We recently intro-
duced a novel pathway concept termed CFPs, which was
benchmarked with existing approaches, ﬁnding a clear progress
over the state of the art (Pey et al., 2011). CFPs approach has
been shown to be particularly effective to determine linear path-
ways from a given source to a target metabolite. In other works,
we illustrate the versatility of CFPs approach for different appli-
cations. In the ﬁrst work we extract key pathways based on gene
and protein expression data that underlies the acetate overﬂow
issue in E. coli cell cultures. In the second work, based on CFPs,
we interpret metabolomics data in different neurological dis-
orders (Pey et al., 2013).

Despite the potential of CFPs, improvements are still possible.
In particular, while the underlying graph of metabolites guaran-
tees carbon exchange in each intermediate step of the path, this is
not always achieved between the source and target metabolites
and false-positive solutions may arise. These pathways often lack
biological interest, particularly when studying biosynthetic or
degradation routes of a metabolite. To overcome this issue, we
amend the formulation in Pey et al. (2011), so as to account for
atomic fate information. This approach was termed aCFP.

In Section 3, by means of a side-by-side comparison in a
medium scale metabolic network, we show that aCFP provides
more biologically relevant pathways than CFP, because canon-
ical pathways are more easily recovered, which reﬂects the
removal of false positives. Note here that CFP represents a
state-of—the—art approach and it is challenging to obtain a notable
improvement over a high-quality approach. In particular, in our
18 canonical pathway analysis, CFP (and aCFP) recovered the
solution in 12 cases. Consequently for these 12 pathways CFP
cannot be outperformed by any other approach. Nevertheless, in
those six cases in which CFP did not recover the canonical path-
way in the ﬁrst solution, aCFP improved the results obtained by
CFP in four out of the six cases, some of them signiﬁcantly (e. g.
arginine biosynthesis pathway).

The limited size of the metabolic network considered in
Section 3.1 makes it difﬁcult to obtain large differences between
aCFP and CFP. However, in Section 3.2 we used a large-sized
genome-scale metabolic network and found remarkable differ-
ences between aCFP and CFP in ﬁnding pathways between glu-
cose and pyruvate, as observed in Figure 4.

Results in Section 3.2 also demonstrate that aCFP can be
successfully applied to genome-scale metabolic networks.
However, the performance of aCFP is intimately tied to the
quality of the atomic reconstruction under consideration.
Although there are high-quality manually curated medium-
scale atomic reconstructions, genome-scale atomic models gen-
erated by means of in silico methods still require further research
so as to provide atomic reconstructions free from errors. This

work will be also valuable for those conducting and modeling
isotope labeling experiments, the most quantitative technology to
infer reaction ﬂuxes (Pey et al., 2012).

There are other biological mechanisms demanding pathways
assuring exchange of different atoms, e. g. reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in different applications in health (Selivanov et al., 2011);
nitrogen assimilation in bacteria (Amon et al., 2010). aCFP can
be easily adapted so as to guarantee any atom exchange, simply
by introducing the atomic reconstructions into the model pre-
sented here.

Overall, combining CFP with high-quality atomic reconstruc-
tions further improves the accuracy of predicted pathways.
Therefore, as high-quality atomic reconstructions become avail-
able, aCFP substitutes the CFP approach, as ‘omics’ experimen-
tal information can be integrated in a similar manner and we
expect to obtain more reliable results. With the increasing
amount of ‘omics’ data, tools such as the one presented here
will be essential to obtain relevant insights from them.

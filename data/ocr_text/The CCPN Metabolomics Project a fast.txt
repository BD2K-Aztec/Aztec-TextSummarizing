ABSTRACT

Summary: We present here the freely available Metabolomics
Project resource specifically designed to work under the Ccmer
Analysis program produced by CCPN (Collaborative Computing
Project for NMR) (Vranken et al., 2005, The CCPN data model for
NMR spectroscopy: development of a software pipeline. Proteins,
59, 687—696). The project consists of a database of assigned 1D
and 2D spectra of many common metabolites. The project aims to
help the user to analyze and assign 1D and 2D NMR spectra of
unknown metabolite mixtures. Spectra of unknown mixtures can be
easily superimposed and compared with the database spectra, thus
facilitating their assignment and identification.

Availability: The CCPN Metabolomics Project, together
with an annotated example dataset, is freely available via:

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolomics is a newly emerging ﬁeld of ‘omics’ research
aiming to give an analytical description of the metabolites in
complex biological samples and to describe the global, dynamic
metabolic response of living systems to biological stimuli or genetic
manipulation (Nicholson et al., 2008).

NMR spectroscopy is making signiﬁcant contributions in this
burgeoning area: it is successfully being used to identify biomarkers
in bioﬁuids for various diseases, to analyze drug toxicity and to
determine drugs’ in vivo efﬁcacy and selectivity (Bemini et al.,
2009; Power 2009). Its potential ability to handle complex mixtures
of metabolites makes it a primary tool in both identiﬁcation and
quantiﬁcation of the multitude of different molecules that constitute
unprocessed biological mixtures.

1D 1H NMR spectra of biological mixtures are characterized
by extensive peak overlap or spectral congestion (Xia et al.,
2008), therefore acquisition of 2D NMR spectra (e.g. 1H-13C
HSQC, HMBC and 1H-1H TOCSY) is a prerequisite for compound

identiﬁcation. However, the paucity of metabolomics software with
dedicated 2D metabolite spectrum resources and coupled analysis
capabilities often makes assignment of metabolite resonances a
challenging task.

We present here the Metabolomics Project dataset based on
Ccmer Analysis software, consisting of a series of 1D and 2D
NMR spectra of 76 standard compounds whose resonances (1H and
13C) have been fully assigned and annotated. This repository can
be efﬁciently applied to the rapid identiﬁcation of the metabolic
components of unknown mixtures (Supplementary Tables S1—S3).

2 PROJECT OVERVIEW

The CCPN Metabolomics Project, available for the Ccmer
software suite (available from the Collaborative Computing Project
for NMR, www.ccpn.ac.uk), consists of assigned 1D and 2D
spectra of standard compounds. The project will be periodically
updated with new metabolite entries. All spectra are fully assigned
(Supplementary Fig. S1), according to public databases, including
the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (Seavey et al.,
1991) and the Human Metabolome Database (Wishart et al.,
2007). The CCPN Metabolomics Project is opened by version 2.1
and above of Ccmer Analysis software (Vranken et al., 2005)
(freely downloadable at http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/d0wnload/). Here,
we present an overview of the CCPN Metabolomics Project, whose
detailed description is available as a Tutorial in Supplementary
Material.

2.1 Creation of the database

The metabolites in the database have been selected from
the most common metabolites present in bioﬁuids. For each
metabolite, a description of the molecular system has been
created, either downloading it from the CCPN repository
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/docs/NMR/chemComeml/main.html)
at the EBI/PDBe or importing it as .mol ﬁle using Ccmer
FormatConverter feature (Chapter 10 of Tutorial in Supplementary
Material). lD-1 H spectra and 2D 1H-13C HSQCs downloaded from
public databases satisfy the standard conditions for metabolomic
purposes (pH 7, T =298K) (Beckonert et al., 2007). Spectra
have been processed using Topspin 2.0 (Bruker BioSpin GmbH,
Rheinstetten, Germany) and referenced using the standard methyl
groups’ peak of DSS (2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane—S-sulfonic
acid). Importantly, 1H-1H TOCSY data, not available on public

repositories, have been generated as simulated peak lists only,
based on chemical structures and on the chemical shift values from
the corresponding 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectra. In essence, the
predicted TOCSY peaks are located at the 1H-1H chemical shift
intersections, within spectrum bounds, for hydrogen atoms that
are connected with one another as part of a theoretical 3J-linked
network. Peak intensity information is not simulated.

2.2 Getting started

In order to start, four important steps should be performed:
(i) opening the spectra of the unknown mixture (from now on
referred to as ‘query spectra’). Most common NMR spectrum data
formats (such as Varian, Bruker, NMRpipe) can be read directly;
(ii) referencing the query spectra (acquired at 298K, pH 7) to DSS;
(iii) deﬁning associated molecular systems. It is possible to select
all molecular systems present in the project library or just those
metabolites the users considers relevant for their speciﬁc project
(Fig. 6 of Tutorial in Supplementary Material); (iv) creating a query
peak list using an automatic or manual peak picking procedure on the
spectra, prior to proceeding with the identiﬁcation of metabolites.

2.3 Identiﬁcation of metabolites in the query spectrum

Peak assignment can be performed easily in a supervised procedure
by transferring the standard compounds’ peak lists to the query
peak list using the Ccmer Analysis ‘Copy Assignments’ utility.
A visual inspection is recommended to verify the correctness of
assignment transfer (Fig. 12 of Tutorial in Supplementary Material).
Alternatively, it is possible to assign an unknown peak by taking
advantage of the Ccmer Analysis ‘Assignment Panel’, which
suggests assignment possibilities based on chemical shifts and one-
bond connectivity. For the analysis of a 2D spectrum, it is possible to
restrict the suggested assignments to intra—molecular contributions
only (Fig. 13 of Tutorial in Supplementary Material). In order to
conﬁrm the assignment, the spectra of the corresponding standard
metabolite(s) can be overlaid onto the query spectrum.

The procedures described here are feasible for all the spectrum
windows, including the 1D 1H and the 2D 1H—1H TOCSY. or
note is the possibility to include mono-dimensional spectra in the
CCPN Metabolomics Project, which allows the detection of low
concentration (up to 10 uM) metabolites.

2.4 Quality check

The resonance identiﬁcation performance can be checked using
the Ccmer utility ‘Quality Reports’ (Chapter 9 of Tutorial in
Supplementary Material) highlighting potential inconsistencies,
errors and chemical shifts with unusual values or high standard
deviation. Resonances with potential problems can be readily linked
to their associated peaks. Finally, the ‘Peak Lists’ table allows a
useful overview of the completeness of the assignment, and can be
easily exported.

2.5 Customizing the library

The metabolite library can be personalized by adding new molecules
and their corresponding spectra to the CCPN Metabolomics
Project. A new standard compound molecule can be introduced by
downloading it from the ‘small compound’ database available in
Ccmer Analysis. Alternatively, it can be imported as a .mol, .mol2

or .pdb ﬁle through the Ccmer FormatConverter program (Chapter
10 of Tutorial in Supplementary Material).

2.6 Testing and validation

The CCPN Metabolomics Project has been tested on 2D 1H-13C
HSQC spectra acquired on a cell culture supernatant collected
at two different time points and on a mouse urine sample
(Supplementary Tables S1—S3). Metabolite recognition under the
CCPN Metabolomics Project performs as well as the identiﬁcation
obtained using the open-access software MetaboMiner (Xia et al.,
2008). Also, by using the CCPN Metabolomics Project users can
easily handle real and fully assigned NMR spectra, both 2D and 1D,
in a general NMR software suite, with all the extra analytical tools
and the active support, for both developers and users, that CCPN
provides.

3 FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

The CCPN Metabolomics Project is undergoing continuous
development in order to improve its application in NMR
metabolomics studies. Updated metabolomics projects with new
reference spectra and reference assignments will be available
and labeled at http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/metabolomicsl. Availability
of standard compounds will be increased and made available by
developing a system to automatically update and select metabolite
data from a database. Moreover, the project will be adapted to
also manage 2D 1H J -resolved NMR spectra, reducing overlapped
signals and assignment ambiguity.

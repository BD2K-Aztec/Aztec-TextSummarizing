ABSTRACT

Summary: Protein interaction networks are widely used to depict the
relationships between proteins. These networks often lack the infor-
mation on physical binary interactions, and they do not inform whether
there is incompatibility of structure between binding partners. Here,
we introduce SAPIN, a framework dedicated to the structural analysis
of protein interaction networks. SAPIN first identifies the protein parts
that could be involved in the interaction and provides template struc-
tures. Next, SAPIN performs structural superimpositions to identify
compatible and mutually exclusive interactions. Finally, the results
are displayed using Cytoscape Web.

Availability: The SAPIN server is available at http://sapin.crg.es.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks are used to describe
cellular functions in normal and disease perturbed states Widal
et al., 2011). However, they often lack the information on phys-
ical binary interactions, e.g. if non-binary interaction methods,
such as co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) or tandem afﬁnity pur-
iﬁcation (TAP)—tag, were used (reviewed in Drewes and
Bouwmeester, 2003). At the moment, only statistical approxima-
tions, such as the socio—afﬁnity index, are used to decide which of
the putative interactions detected in a co-IP or TAP-tag experi-
ments are direct (Gavin et al., 2006). Further, PPI networks do
not always inform whether several proteins binding to the same
protein ‘hub’ are compatible (‘AND’) or mutually exclusive
(‘XOR’) structurally (Kim et al., 2006). Integration of structural
information with PPI networks can partially solve these limita-
tions: ﬁrst, information from 3D structures of protein/domain
complexes can be used to distinguish ‘AND’ from ‘XOR’ binding
sites. Adding ‘AND’/‘XOR’ structural information into protein
interaction networks is important to identify competing inter-
actions where changes in concentration of one component
could result in different pathways being active (Kiel et al.,
2011). Also, it can help understanding different functional effects
of mutations taking place in the same protein but at different

interaction surfaces (Kar et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012).
Limitations in the availability of structures of protein complexes
to decide whether interactions are of ‘AND’ or ‘XOR’ type can
be partly circumvented by using structures of homologous pro-
teins, as homologous pairs of binding proteins tend to have a
similar interaction topology (Aloy et al., 2003).

In part, the structural knowledge in the aforementioned struc-
tural interaction network (SIN) was increased by compiling the
information of homologous sequences, as homologous pairs of
binding proteins tend to have a similar interaction topology
(Aloy et al., 2003). Second, we propose that 3D information of
homologous structures, when combined with experimental infor-
mation, can be extremely valuable for predicting physical binary
interactions among proteins that were found together in a com-
plex in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment.

Here, we introduce SAPIN, a framework dedicated to the
Structural Analysis of Protein Interaction Networks. It encom-
passes features allowing (i) a full analysis of the protein sequence
for the identiﬁcation of the parts potentially involved in an inter-
action; (ii) a mapping of the available structural data involving
the previously identiﬁed parts; and (iii) the identiﬁcation of com-
patible and mutually exclusive interactions at the network level.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

SAPIN has been implemented using Python programming lan-
guage and takes as input an interaction ﬁle and the related pro-
tein sequences provided as a FASTA ﬁle (Fig. l).

2.1 Sequence analysis

SAPIN uses various applications to predict the protein parts that
could mediate the interaction with its binding partners: (i) the
domain composition using HMM collection from PFAM (Finn
et al., 2010); (ii) the possible phosphorylation sites and motifs
derived from experimental data (Phospho.ELM; Dinkel et al.,
2011) or from prediction methods [Scansite (Obenauer et al.,
2003) and NetPhorest (Miller et al., 2008)]; (iii) the disordered
regions (Disopred; Ward et al., 2004); and (iv) secondary struc-
ture element composition (Jones, 1999).

2.2 Search for structural templates of domain—domain
interactions

SAPIN searches for potential structural templates in the 3DID
database (Stein et al., 2009) (ﬁltered for crystal packing artifacts,
see Supplementary Material) that could model the interaction
between two proteins. The resulting matches are evaluated

Fig. 1. The input of SAPIN is a txt-ﬁle of interactions and protein se-
quences. Sequences are used to predict domains, and possible structural
templates are searched for. If a protein has at least two interacting part-
ners, the domains mediating the interaction are superimposed on the ref-
erence domain, and the interacting domains are analysed for compatibility,
and the results are displayed in the ﬁnal structural interaction network

using InterPreTS (Aloy and Russell, 2003) to select the most
relevant domain interaction.

2.3 Identiﬁcation of compatible and mutually exclusive
complexes

For two given complexes AB and AC, the related domain—
domain interactions structural models are obtained by structural
alignment of A over the templates using the CE program
(Shindyalov and Bourne, 2001). The interacting domains A
and C are then analysed for backbone van der Waals clashes
using the empirical force ﬁeld FoldX (Schymkowitz et al,
2005). A threshold of van der Waals clashes for a compatible
(‘AND’) or mutually exclusive interaction (‘XOR’) was deﬁned
(see Supplementary Material). Benchmarking of structural super-
impositions using a set of 1118 solved structures (7288 hetero-
trimeric domain interactions) showed that 95% of the complexes
are correctly evaluated as compatible.

2.4 The SAPIN webserver

SAPIN is accessible through a web portal at http://sapin.crg.es.
The portal is built on the open-source Drupal content manage-
ment system for full ﬂexibility. The pipeline is designed to deal
preferably with UNIPROT accession numbers (The UniProt
Consortium, 2011). For each pipeline step, a user-friendly inter-
face is provided to visualize the results. SAPIN provides a
user-friendly interface to visualize the results. The sequence fea-
tures for each protein can be browsed by simply clicking on a
link to display the detailed results from the different predictions.
The structural information (from 3DID, InterPreTS scores and
the identiﬁed domain—motif interactions) can be downloaded as
a table. The structural representation of compatible and mutu-
ally exclusive interactions is available in a table and in an

interactive network browser (Lopes et al, 2010). The structural
information is represented using Cytoscape Web (Lopes et al,
2010): in addition to the nodes representing proteins, compatible
(‘AND’) and mutually exclusive (‘XOR’) interactions of domains
are displayed as green and red dots, respectively.

3 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

SAPIN is a framework that brings together protein interaction
networks and structural data, with the objective of reaching a
better understanding of how proteins interact with each other. It
predicts structural interactions based on sequence data from pro-
teins that have been experimentally co-puriﬁed within a complex.
It then uses the knowledge of interaction interfaces to identify
compatible and exclusive interactions. However, this approach is
based on single domain—domain interactions, without taking into
account the fold of the full-length proteins.

Our method highlights the principle of competition, which could
be important in signal transduction pathways. Further, it could be
combined with statistical approaches (e. g. socio-afﬁnity index) to
describe the organization of protein complexes more accurately.

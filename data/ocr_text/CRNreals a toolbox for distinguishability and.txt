ABSTRACT

Summary: Chemical reaction network theory is widely used in
modeling and analyzing complex biochemical systems such as
metabolic networks and cell signalling pathways. Being able to
produce all the biologically and chemically important qualitative
dynamical features, chemical reaction networks (CRNs) have
attracted significant attention in the systems biology community.
It is well-known that the reliable inference of CRN models
generally requires thorough identifiability and distinguishability
analysis together with carefully selected prior modeling assumptions.
Here, we present a software toolbox CRNreals that supports the
distinguishability and identifiability analysis of CRN models using
recently published optimization-based procedures.

Availability and implementation: The CRNreals toolbox
and the associated documentation are available at
http://www.iim.csic.es/~gingproc/CRNreals/. The toolbox runs
under the popular MATLAB computational environment and
supports several free and commercial linear programming and
mixed integer linear programming solvers.

1 INTRODUCTION

The key importance of dynamics in the explanation of complex
phenomena occurring in living systems is now a commonly accepted
view (Alon, 2007) that underscores the importance of mathematical
model building and model parameter estimation (Banga and Balsa—
Canto, 2008). An important family of non—negative non—linear
dynamical systems is the class of deterministic chemical reaction
network (CRN) models obeying the mass—action law (Horn and
Jackson, 1972). Such networks can be used to describe pure chemical
reactions, but they are also widely used to model the dynamics of
intracellular processes, metabolic or cell signalling pathways.

Chemical reaction network theory (CRNT) is originated in the
1970’s by the pioneering works of Horn, Jackson and Feinberg
(Feinberg, 1987; Horn and Jackson, 1972). Since then, CRNT has
gained an increasing attention, and many strong results have been
published in the ﬁeld on the relation between network structure
and qualitative dynamical properties (Conradi and Flockerzi, 2011;
Shinar and Feinberg, 2010).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

It is known from the early literature that different CRNs can
produce exactly the same kinetic differential equations (Horn and
Jackson, 1972). This phenomenon is called macro-equivalence
or dynamical equivalence. However, effective optimization—based
procedures for the analysis and synthesis of dynamically equivalent
CRNs have been developed only recently, using the possibility
of transforming propositional logic statements encoding structural
properties into mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems
(Szederkenyi, 2009; Szederkenyi et al., 2011a,b). The primary
purpose of our toolbox is to make these numerical methods
accessible in an easily usable way.

As a related software tool, ﬁrst we have to mention the Chemical
Reaction Network Toolbox (Ellison and Feinberg, 2000) that can
produce detailed reports about the basic network properties, multiple
and degenerate steady states, injectivity and (strong) concordance.
Additionally, the open source ERNEST Toolbox (Soranzo and
Altaﬁni, 2009) performs a detailed model analysis of the input CRN
by determining the basic system features and by using the Deﬁciency
Zero or Deﬁciency One Theorems. The toolbox is also capable of
running the Deﬁciency One Algorithm where applicable. However,
both of the above—mentioned toolboxes assume that the structure
of the analyzed network is a priori known, therefore they have no
functionality for examining dynamical equivalence.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

The basic model form of CRN dynamics describing the time—
evolution of species is the following: it = Y -Ak-1p(x), where x E R”
is the concentration vector of the species, Y E Rnxm, called the
complex composition matrix, stores the stoichiometric coefﬁcients of
the complexes, Ak E Rmxm contains the information corresponding
to the weighted directed graph of the reaction network and wj (x) =

flef’j, for j=1,...,m [see, e.g. (Horn and Jackson, 1972)
for more details]. Therefore the basic data structure used by the
CRNreals toolbox for uniquely representing a CRN is the matrix
pair (Y ,Ak). Two reaction networks with distinct speciﬁc values
of the reaction rate coefﬁcients are called dynamically equivalent
realizations, if they give rise to the same set of diﬂerential equations.

Besides several utility functions for basic model analysis and
manipulation, the main high—level functionality of the toolbox

includes the following.

(1) Algorithmically building the so—called canonical CRN mecha—
nism (Erdi and Toth, 1989) from kinetic polynomial ordinary
differential equations.

et al., 2011a). Core reactions are indicated by thick directed edges.

(2) Finding dense and sparse realizations containing the maximal
and minimal non—zero reaction rate coefﬁcients (Fig. 1). We
note that dense realizations give a unique super—structure with
a ﬁxed complex set, and that the CRN structure is unique if
and only if the structures of the dense and sparse realizations
are identical (Szederkenyi et al., 2011b).

(3) Finding reversible and weakly reversible realizations. The
existence of such realizations has a key effect on the
boundedness of solutions and on the robust stability of
the system (depending also on the deﬁciency).

(4) Finding detailed balanced and complex balanced realizations
if they exist. These properties have also important stability
implications.

(5) Computing dynamically equivalent realizations with the
minimal and maximal number of chemical complexes from
a previously deﬁned complex set.

(6) Finding the so—called ‘core’ and ‘non—core’ reactions of
the CRN. Core reactions are present in any dynamically
equivalent CRN realization and thus they are indispensable
components of the system, whereas non—core reactions can (at
least mathematically) be substituted by others (Szederkenyi
et al., 2011a).

The toolbox was implemented in the MATLAB computational
environment becuase of the easy and straightforward manipulation
of matrices and the ﬂexible setup of linear programming and MILP
solvers. The toolbox provides conversion functions for importing
and exporting mass—action model structures using the libSBML
API. Therefore, computed structures can be easily transferred for
further analysis e. g. to the ERNEST toolbox.

Fig. 1 shows the structure of the dense realization of a
biochemical switch model analyzed in (Szederkenyi et al., 2011a).
The dense realization and the core reactions were determined using

the CRN_FindSDReali zation and CRN_FindCoreReact—
ions functions, respectively (the detailed computations can be
found in Example 4 of the toolbox).

3 CONCLUSION

A software toolbox called CRNreals was presented in this note for
the analysis and synthesis of dynamically equivalent CRNs. The
tools provided by our software aid modeling and dynamical analysis
in the following areas: (i) they support the distinguishability and
identiﬁability analysis of CRN models by deciding whether a given
CRN has a unique structure or not; (ii) they clearly extend the
application scope of CRNT results by searching for dynamically
equivalent network structures with preferred properties such as
density/ sparsity, (weak) reversibility, detailed/complex balance, etc.;
and (iii) they allow the CRNT—based analysis of non—negative
polynomial models possibly coming from application areas other
than (bio)chemistry. Further work in future versions will be focused
on making the applied numerical methods more effective, and
on including the recently developed algorithms related to linear
conjugacy thus extending the notion of dynamical equivalence.

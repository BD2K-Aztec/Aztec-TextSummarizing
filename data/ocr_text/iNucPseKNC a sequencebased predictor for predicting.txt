ABSTRACT

Motivation: Nucleosome positioning participates in many cellular activ-
ities and plays significant roles in regulating cellular processes. With the
avalanche of genome sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it
is highly desired to develop automated methods for rapidly and effect-
ively identifying nucleosome positioning. Although some computational
methods were proposed, most of them were species specific and neg-
lected the intrinsic local structural properties that might play important
roles in determining the nucleosome positioning on a DNA sequence.
Results: Here a predictor called ‘iNuc-PseKNC’ was developed for
predicting nucleosome positioning in Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis
elegans and Drosophila melanogaster genomes, respectively. In the
new predictor, the samples of DNA sequences were formulated by a
novel feature-vector called ‘pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition’,
into which six DNA local structural properties were incorporated. It
was observed by the rigorous cross-validation tests on the three strin-
gent benchmark datasets that the overall success rates achieved by
iNuc-PseKNC in predicting the nucleosome positioning of the afore-
mentioned three genomes were 86.27%, 86.90% and 79.97%, re-
spectively. Meanwhile, the results obtained by iNuc-PseKNC on
various benchmark datasets used by the previous investigators for
different genomes also indicated that the current predictor remarkably
outperformed its counterparts.

1 INTRODUCTION

The basic unit of eukaryotic chromatin is nucleosome. Each nu-
cleosome contains a 147-bp core DNA (Richmond and Davey,

2003) that is tightly wrapped in 1.67 left-handed super-helical
turns around a histone octamer (Segal et al., 2006) as shown in
Figure l. The histone octamer is formed by eight histones, of
which two are of H2A, two of H2B, two of H3 and two of H4,
and these histones bear highly conservative property in organism
evolution (Kornberg, 1977). Under the effect of histone H1, the
nucleosome core particle forms a stable structure by further
packaging into an advanced structure (Luger et al., 1997).
Adjacent nucleosomes are linked via a short DNA sequence,
called the linker DNA, which ranges from 10 to 100 bp (Athey
et al., 1990; Mavrich et al., 2008a, b).

By modulating the accessibility of genomic regions to regula-
tory proteins (Albert et al., 2007; Yuan and Liu, 2008), it was
observed that the packaging of DNA around the histone octamer
played important roles in many biological processes such as tran-
scriptional control, DNA replication, DNA repair and RNA
splicing (Berbenetz et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2009; Yasuda
et al., 2005). Therefore, it is fundamentally important for in-
depth understanding the subsequent steps of gene expression to

iNuc-PseKNC: predict nucleosome positioning

 

reveal the mechanism involved in controlling nucleosome
positioning.

High-throughput techniques, such as chromatin immunopre—
cipitation (ChIP) coupled with microarrays (ChIP-chip) and
ChIP coupled with sequencing techniques (ChIP-Seq), have
been developed. Also, high-resolution nucleosome-positioning
maps are now available for several model organisms including
Homo sapiens (Ozsolak et al., 2007; Schones et al., 2008),
Caenorhabditis elegans (Valouev et al., 2008), Drosophila melano-
gaster (Mavrich et al., 2008a, b) and Sacchoromryces cerevisiae
(Lee et al., 2007; Weiner et al., 2010). These high-resolution data
provided unprecedented opportunities, or made it feasible to de-
velop computational methods for accurately predicting nucleo-
some positioning by feature extraction approaches.

Satchwell et a]. (1986) for the first time found that a 10-bp
interval repetition of AA/TT/TA occurred in the 147-bp core
region of nucleosomes. Widlund et al. (1999) demonstrated
that CA dinucleotide played an important role in nucleosome
positioning, and the sequences containing the fragment
TATAAACGCC had high binding affinity to histone.
Segal et al. (2006) found that ~50% of nucleosome placements
were prefigured by genome sequence. It was also observed that
nucleosome deficiency always appeared in poly (dA:dT) frag-
ments (Segal and Widom, 2009). Subsequently, Liu et al. (Liu
et al., 2011a, b) found that the 10—11 bp periodicity signals for
some particular dinucleotides, such as AA, TT, TA and GC,
were more pronounced in the DNA nucleosomal sequences
than in the linker DNA sequences. The above findings have
demonstrated that nucleosome positioning is sequence-depend-
ent to some extent.

Based on the characteristics of nucleosome positioning se-
quence (or nucleosomal sequences), various computational meth-
ods (Chen et al., 2010, 2012b; Gupta et al., 2008; Peckham et al.,
2007; Xing et al., 2011, 2013; Zhang et al. 2012a,b; Zhao et al.,
2010) were proposed for predicting nucleosome positioning in
different genomes. All these methods could yield quite encoura-
ging results, and each of them did play a role in stimulating the
development of this area. However, further work is needed due
to the following reasons. (i) The datasets constructed in those
methods were too small to reflect the statistical profile of nucleo-
somes. (ii) No cutoff threshold (Chou and Shen, 2007) was
imposed to rigorously exclude the redundant samples or those
with high sequence similarity with others in a same dataset. (iii)
No web-server was provided to most of these methods, and
hence their usage is quite limited, especially for the majority of
experimental scientists. (iv) All the local DNA structural proper-
ties (Miele et al., 2008; Nozaki et al., 2011) and their impacts to
the global sequence effects were ignored; however, it was demon-
strated that this kind of properties might play important roles in
determining the rotational positioning of DNA around the his-
tone octamer (Chen et al., 2012b).

The present article was initiated in an attempt to improve the
prediction of nucleosomes from the above four aspects.

According to a comprehensive review (Chou, 2011) and
demonstrated by a series of recent publications (Chen et al.,
2013; Xiao et al., 2013), to establish a really useful statistical
predictor for a biological system, we need to consider the follow-
ing procedures: (i) construct or select a valid benchmark dataset
to train and test the predictor; (ii) formulate the biological

samples with an effective mathematical expression that can
truly reflect their intrinsic correlation with the target to be pre-
dicted; (iii) introduce or develop a powerful algorithm (or engine)
to operate the prediction; (iv) properly perform cross-validation
tests to objectively evaluate the anticipated accuracy of the pre-
dictor; (v) establish a user-friendly web-server for the predictor
that is accessible to the public. Below, let us describe how to deal
with these procedures one by one.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Benchmark datasets for the nucleosomal and linker
sequences

In this article, we considered the following three species: (i) H .Sapiens; (ii)
Celegans; and (iii) D.melan0gaster. The experimental data for nucleo-
some positions in the ﬁrst species (Schones et al., 2008) were downloaded
from http: / /dir.nhlbi.nih.gov/papers/1mi /epigenomes /hgtce11nucleosomes.
aspx; those for the second species from http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu;
and those for the third species from (Mavrich et al., 2008a, b) and http://
atlas.bx.psu.edu/. The entire genome sequences for the three species were
downloaded from the UCSC genome database at http://hgdownload.cse.
ucsc.edu/, where the hg18 version, WSl70/ce4 version and BDGP Release
5 version were used for (i) H.5apiens, (ii) C.elegans and (iii)
Dmelanogaster genomes, respectively.

Since the H.5apiens genome and its nucleosome map contain a huge
amount of data, according to Liu’s strategy (Liu et al., 2011a) the nu-
cleosome-forming sequence samples (positive data) and the linkers or
nucleosome-inhibiting sequence samples (negative data) were extracted
from chromosome 20. As for the other two species, namely C.elegans
and Dmelanogaster, the positive and negative data were extracted from
their entire genomes. In the datasets thus formed from the three organ-
isms, each of the DNA fragments was assigned with a nucleosome for-
mation score to reﬂect its propensity to form nucleosome: the higher the
score was, the more likely the fragment would be in forming a nucleo-
some. The DNA fragments with the highest nucleosome formation scores
were selected as the nucleosomal sequences, while those with the lowest
scores as the linker sequences.

As elaborated in (Chou, 2011), a dataset containing many redundant
samples with high similarity would be lack of statistical representative-
ness. A predictor, if trained and tested by such a biased benchmark
dataset, might yield misleading results with overestimated accuracy
(Chou and Shen, 2006; Ding, 2013). To get rid of redundancy and
avoid bias, the CD-HIT software (Fu et al., 2012) was used with the
cutoff threshold set at 80% to remove those DNA fragments with high
sequence similarity (note that the most stringent cutoff threshold for
DNA sequences by CD-HIT was 75%).

Finally, we obtained three benchmark datasets as formulated by

l for H .Sapiens
S, = S: U $2, k = 2 for C.elegans (l)
3 for D.melan0gaster

here the positive dataset $7 contains 2273 nucleosome-forming sequences
while the negative dataset $1— contains 2300 nucleosome-inhibiting
sequences; §3L contains 2567 nucleosome-forming sequences while $2—
contains 2608 nucleosome-inhibiting sequences; §§ contains 2900 nucleo-
some-forming sequences while §3— contains 2850 nucleosome-inhibiting
sequences; and the symbol U means the union in the set theory. All
the sequence samples are 147-bp long; none of them has >80% pair-
wise sequence identity with any other. The detailed sequences in the
three benchmark datasets $1,§2 and $3 are given in Supplementary
Materials S1, S2 and S3, respectively.

2.2 Pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition

Suppose a DNA sequence D with L nucleic acid residues; i.e.
D = R1R2R3R4R5R6R7 . . . RL (2)

where R1 denotes the nucleic acid residue at the sequence position 1, R2
the nucleic acid residue at position 2 and so forth. If the DNA sequence
is represented by the k-tuple nucleotide composition (Ioshikhes et al.,
1996), the corresponding feature vector will contain 4" components, as
given by

D=[f1 f2 f3 f4  f4k]T (3)

As we can see from the above equation, with the gradual increase of k,
although most of the base sequence-order information within a local or
short range could be included, none of the global or long-range sequence-
order information would be reﬂected by the formulation.

Actually, in computational proteomics, we have also faced the same
situation; i.e. although the dipeptide composition, tripeptide composition,
and k-tuple peptide composition were used by many investigators to rep-
resent protein sequences, their global or long-range sequence-order infor-
mation could still not be reﬂected. To deal with this problem, the concept
of pseudo amino acid composition (Chou, 2001a) or Chou’s PseAAC (Lin
and Lapointe, 2013) was proposed. Since then, the PseAAC approach has
rapidly penetrated into many areas of computational proteomics (see, e.g.
Chen and Li, 2013; Esmaeili et al., 2010; Hajishariﬁ et al., 2014; Liu et al.,
2013; Mohabatkar et al., 2011, 2013; Mohammad Beigi et al., 2011; Nanni
and Lumini, 2008; Nanni et al., 2012; Sahu and Panda, 2010) and a long
list of references cited in a review (Chou, 2011). Owing to its wide usage,
recently two powerful softwares, called ‘PseAAC-Builder’ (Du et al., 2012)
and ‘propy’ (Cao et al., 2013), were established for generating various
special pseudo-amino acid compositions.

Stimulated by the PseAAC approach (Chou, 2001a, 2005) in compu-
tational proteomics, below we are to propose a novel feature vector,
called ‘pseudo k—tuple nucleotide composition’ (PseKNC), to represent
DNA-sequence samples by incorporating the global or long-range se-
quence-order effects so as to improve the prediction quality in identifying
nucleosomes.

Similar to Equation (5) of Chou (2001a) or Equation (3) of Chou
(2009), the PseKNC can be formulated as

D 2 [d1 d2 - - - d4k d4k+1 - - - 014k...)L ]T 
where
.lkf—“A (1 5 u 5 4k)
Zi:1fi+w 21:1 61'
du = . (5)
W6u_4k (4k E u E 

k—
Z?:1fi+w 21:1 61'

In the above equation, A is the number of the total counted ranks (or
tiers) of the correlations along a DNA sequence; fu (u: 1,2, . . . ,4k) are
the same as Equation (3) that are now normalized to 22:1]? 2 1; while w
is the weight factor. The concrete values of A and w as well as k will be
further discussed later, while 01- is given by

which represents the j-tier structural correlation factor between all the j—th
most contiguous dinucleotide. For example, 01 is the ﬁrst-tier correlation
factor that reﬂects the sequence-order correlation between all the most
contiguous dinucleotide along a DNA sequence (Fig. 2a); 02 reﬂects the
second-tier correlation factor between all the second-most contiguous
dinucleotide (Fig. 2b); 03 reﬂects the third-tier correlation factor between
all the third-most contiguous dinucleotide (Fig. 2c); and so forth.

Fig. 2. A schematic drawing to show the correlations of dinucleotides
along a DNA sequence for (A) the ﬁrst-tier coupling that reﬂects the
correlation mode between all the most contiguous dinucleotide, (B) the
second-tier coupling between all the second-most contiguous dinucleotide
and (C) the third-tier coupling between all the third-most contiguous
dinucleotide

Accordingly, the parameter A actually represents the highest counted
rank (or tier) of the correlation along a DNA sequence, and hence
must be an integer. The correlation function @(R,R,-+1, R,+jR,-+j+1) in
Equation (6) is deﬁned by

u
@(RiRi+1,R.+,-Ri+j+1) = i2 [Pv(Rl-Ri+1) — P.(R.+.~Ri+.~+1)r (7)

v=1
where u is the number of local DNA structural properties considered that
is equal to 6 in the current article as will be explained below; PV(R,- R,-+1),
the numerical value of the v-th (v=1,2,...,u) DNA local structural
property for the dinucleotide R,- R,-+1 at position i and PV(R,-+J- R,-+j+1)
the corresponding value for the dinucleotide R,-+J- R,-+J-+1 at position i+j.

2.3 DNA local structural property parameters

It has been reported that DNA structural properties play important roles
in many biological processes, such as prokaryotic transcription initiation,
protein—DNA interactions, formation of chromosomes and meiotic re-
combination (Abeel et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2013; Goni et al., 2007,
2008). Recently, Miele et al. (2008) developed a model to predict nucleo-
some occupancy by using basic physical properties. Their model captures
a substantial part of chromatin’s structural complexity, thus leading to a
much better prediction of nucleosome occupancy than the methods based
only on periodic curved-DNA motifs (Miele et al., 2008).

Illuminated by Miele’s work (Miele et al., 2008), in this article, the
DNA local structural properties were considered to deﬁne PseKNC.
Generally speaking, the spatial arrangements of two neighboring base
pairs are characterized by six parameters (Dickerson, 1989), of which
three are local translational parameters and other three the local angular
parameters, as summarized in Equation (8)

Rise Twist
Translational 2 Slide Angular 2 Roll (8)
Shift Tilt

and illustrated in Figure 3. The detailed values for the six DNA local
structural property parameters are given in Table S1 of Supplementary
Material S4, which will be used to calculate the global or long-rangese-
quence-order effects for the nucleosome and linker sequences via
Equation (7) as well as Equations (4—6).

Note that before substituting them into Equation (7), all the original
values in Table S1 of Supplementary Material S4 for PV(R,- R,-+1)

explanation

(v = 1, 2, . . . , 6) were subjected to a standard conversion (Chou, 2005) as
described by the following equation:

Pv(RiRi+l) _ <Pv>

PV(RIRI+I) <2 

(9)
where the symbol < > means taking the average of the quantity therein
over 16 different dinucleotides, and SD means the corresponding stand-
ard deviation. The converted values obtained by Equation (9) will have a
zero mean value over the 16 different dinucleotides, and will remain un-
changed if going through the same conversion procedure again. Listed in
Table S2 of Supplementary Material S4 are the values of PV(R,- R,-+1)
(v=1,2,...,6) obtained via the standard conversion of Equation (9)
from those of Table S1 Supplementary Material S4.

2.4 Support vector machine

Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful and popular method for
pattern recognition that has been widely used in the realm of bioinfor-
matics (Bhasin and Raghava, 2004; Mohabatkar et al., 2011; Wan, 2013;
Chen et al., 2012c). The basic idea of SVM is to transform the data into a
high dimensional feature space, and then determine the optimal separat-
ing hyper plane using a kernel function. To handle a multi—class problem,
‘one—versus-one (OVO)’ and ‘one—versus-rest (OVR)’ are generally
applied to extend the traditional SVM. For a brief formulation of
SVM and how it works, see (Chou and Cai, 2002). For more details
about SVM, see a monograph Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor (2000).

In the current article, the LIBSVM 2.86 package (Fan et al., 2005) was
used as an implementation of SVM, which can be downloaded from
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cj1in/1ibsvm/. The radial basis function
was selected as the kernel function due to its effectiveness and speed in
training process. The optimal penalty constant C and width parameter y
were determined via an optimization procedure using a grid search
approach.

The predictor obtained via the above procedures is called iNuc-
PseKNC, where ‘i’ stands for ‘identify’, ‘Nuc’ for ‘nucleosome’, ‘Pse’
for ‘pseudo’, ‘K’ for ‘k-tuple’, ‘N’ for ‘nucleotide’ and ‘C’ for ‘compos-
ition’. Moreover, its web-server has also been established as will be
further described later.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Criteria for performance evaluation

One of the important procedures in developing a useful statistical
predictor (Chou, 2011) is to objectively evaluate its performance
or anticipated success rate. To realize this, we ﬁrst need a set of
metrics to quantitatively measure the performance of a predictor.
Here, let us use the criterion proposed in (Chou, 2001b, c) to
develop a set of more intuitive and easier-to-understand metrics.
According to that criterion, the rates of correct predictions for
the nucleosome-forming sequences and the nucleosome-inhibit-
ing sequences are, respectively, deﬁned by
+ _ N+ _N+

A _ N, —, for the nucleosome-forming sequences

N- —N- . . . .
t for the nucleosome-inhibiting sequences

N— 9
(10)

where N+ is the total number of the nucleosome-forming
sequences investigated while N; the number of the nucleo-
some-forming sequences incorrectly predicted as the nucleo-
some-inhibiting sequences; N‘ the total number of the
nucleosome-inhibiting sequences investigated while N; the
number of the nucleosome-inhibiting sequences incorrectly pre-
dicted as nucleosome-forming sequences. Based on the symbols
in Equation (10), the following set of metrics can be obtained
(Xu et al., 2013)

 

 

A_:

r N+
Snzl—N—;

 

. Acc = A=1 — xiﬂi (11)
N‘_I' N;
MCC = “(N—++N_‘)

 

 

 

 

ire-a 

where Sn stands for the sensitivity, Sp for the speciﬁcity, Acc for
the accuracy and MCC for the Mathew’s correlation coefﬁcient.
Such four metrics are generally used in statistical prediction for
quantitatively measuring the performance of a predictor from
four different angles. In some statistical analysis, Sn is also
called the ‘true positive rate’ and (l—Sp) the ‘false positive
rate’, as will be further discussed later.

From Equation (11), we can easily see the following. When
N; = 0 meaning none of the nucleosome-forming sequences was
incorrectly predicted to be a nucleosome-inhibiting sequence, we
have the sensitivity Sn 2 1. When N; = N+ meaning that all the
nucleosome-forming sequences were incorrectly predicted to be
the nucleosome-inhibiting sequences, we have the sensitivity
Sn=0. Likewise, when N; = 0 meaning none of the nucleo-
some-inhibiting sequences was incorrectly predicted to be a nu-
cleosome-forming sequence, we have the speciﬁcity Sp: 1;
whereas N; = N‘ meaning all the nucleosome-inhibiting se-
quences were incorrectly predicted to be the nucleosome-forming
sequences, we have the speciﬁcity Sp=0. When N; = N;=0
meaning that none of the nucleosome-forming sequences and
none of the nucleosome-inhibiting sequences were incorrectly
predicted, we have the overall accuracy Acc = 1 and
Mathew’s correlation coefﬁcient MCC = 1; when

S.-H.Guo et aI.

 

N; = N+and N; = N‘ meaning that all the nucleosome-form-
ing sequences and all the nucleosome-inhibiting sequences were
incorrectly predicted, we have Acc = 0 and MCC = —1; whereas
when N; =N+/2 and N; =N‘/2 we have Acc = 0.5 and
MCC = 0 meaning no better than random prediction. As we
can see from the above discussion based on Equation (11), the
meanings of the four metrics have become much more intuitive
and easier-to-understand, particularly for the Mathew’s correl-
ation coefﬁcient, which is usually used for measuring the quality
of binary (two-class) classiﬁcations as in the case of current
article.

It is instructive to point out that the aforementioned metrics
are valid only to the single-label system in which a sample inves-
tigated belongs to one, and only one class. In other words, a
same nucleotide sequence cannot belong to both nucleosome-
forming class and nucleosome-inhibiting class. However, it has
been observed recently that some molecular biosystems and bio-
medical systems are actually the multi-label systems in which
some of their constituent molecules may belong to two or
more attributes (Chen et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013; Xiao et al.,
2013), and hence need two or more labels to tag them (Chou,
2013).

3.2 Cross validation

Three cross-validation methods, i.e. independent dataset test,
sub-sampling (or K-fold cross validation) test and jackknife
test, are often used to evaluate the anticipated success rate of a
predictor (Chou and Zhang, 1995). Among the three methods,
however, the jackknife test is deemed the least arbitrary and most
objective as elucidated in (Chou and Shen, 2008) and demon-
strated by Equations (28—32) of Chou (2011), and hence has been
widely recognized and increasingly adopted by investigators to
examine the quality of various predictors (see, e.g. Chen et al.,
2012a, 2013; Chen and Li, 2013; Chou et al., 2012; Esmaeili
et al., 2010; Gupta et al., 2013; Mei, 2012; Mohabatkar et al.,
2011, 2013). Accordingly, the jackknife test was also used to
examine the performance of the model proposed in the current
article. In the jackknife test, each sequence in the training dataset
is in turn singled out as an independent test sample and all the
rule-parameters are calculated without including the one being
identiﬁed.

3.3 Parameter optimization

As we can see from Equations (4 and 5), the current prediction
model was based on three parameters, namely k, A and w, where
w is the weight factor usually within the range from 0 to 1, k
reﬂects the local or short-range sequence-order effect, and A the
global or long-range sequence-order effect. Generally speaking,
the greater the k is, the more local sequence-order information
the model contains. Also, the greater the A is, the more global
sequence-order information the model contains. However, if k or
A is too large, it would reduce the cluster-tolerant capacity
(Chou, 1999) so as to lower down the cross-validation accuracy
due to overﬁtting or ‘high dimension disaster’ problem (\Nang
et al., 2008). Therefore, our searching for the optimal values

for the three parameters were carried out according to the
following

ZSkSO, withstepA=1
l f A 5 20, with step A = 1 (12)
nggl, withstepA=0.l

As we can see from above, there are 5 x 20 x 11 = 1100 combin-
ations (or points in the 3D parameter space) that need to be
considered for ﬁnding the optimal parameter values. To reduce
the computational time, let us ﬁrst use the 5-fold cross-validation
approach to deal with the parameter optimization. For example,
a histogram is given in Figure 4 to show how different k values
would affect the predicted results.

Once the optimal values of the three parameters are deter-
mined, the rigorous jackknife test will be performed to ﬁnally
evaluate the anticipated success rate of the predictor.

3.4 Prediction quality

Listed in Table 1 are the prediction quality measured by the four
metrics deﬁned in Equation (11) for the iNuc-PseKNC predictor
in identifying nucleosomes via the rigorous jackknife cross val-
idation. The optimal values for the predictor’s three parameters
k, A and w are also given in the table.

Meanwhile, to provide a graphical illustration to show the
performance of the current binary classiﬁer iNuc-PseKNC as
its discrimination threshold is varied, a 2D plot, called ROC
(receiver operating characteristic) curve, is given in Figure 5,
where its vertical coordinate Y is for the true positive rate or
Sn [cf. Equation (11)] while horizontal coordinate X for the
false positive rate or 1—Sp. The best possible prediction
method would yield a point with the coordinate (0,1) represent-
ing 100% true positive rate (sensitivity Sn) and 0 false positive
rate or 100% speciﬁcity. Therefore, the (0,1) point is also called a
perfect classiﬁcation. A completely random guess would give a
point along a diagonal from the point (0,0) to (1,1). The
AUROC is often used to indicate the performance quality of a

Fig. 5. A graphical illustration to show the performance of the iNuc-
PseKNC by means of the ROC curves. The areas under the ROC
curves, or AUROC, are 0.925, 0.935 and 0.874 for H.5apiens, C.elegans
and D.melan0gaster, respectively

binary classiﬁer: the value 0.5 of AUROC is equivalent to
random prediction while 1 of AUROC represents a perfect one.

As we can see from Table 1 and Figure 5, even for such large
and stringent benchmark datasets, the rates obtained by iNuc-
PseKNC were all considerably high, indicating the current pre-
dictor is not only accurate, but also quite stable.

It is instructive to point out that the prediction accuracy by the
current method for Dmelanogaster is not as high as those for
H.5apiens and Celegant accuracies. The reason is probably due
to the fact that the features of Dmelcmogaster nucleosomes are
not fully extracted. As is well known, the nucleosomal positions
are neither ﬁxed at all developmental stages (or tissues) nor uni-
formly phased with 100% (Gupta et al., 2008; Peckham et al.,
2007; Segal et al., 2006). Accordingly, it is rational to calculate
the nucleosomal-forming probability. If the probability of a se-
quence is 20.5, the sequence is predicted as nucleosome; other-
wise, linker.

3.5 Comparison with the existing predictor

As mentioned in the Section 1, the accuracy rates reported by the
existing methods in identifying nucleosomes were based on small

benchmark datasets without removing high similarity sequences
therein, and hence might be over-estimated as shown in Tables
S3—S6 of Supplementary Material S4, where the success rates
obtained with the current predictor by using the same test meth-
ods and same benchmark datasets as used in the existing pre-
dictors (Chen et al., 2012b; Zhang et al. 2012a, b; Zhao et al.,
2010) are given along with the reported rates in those papers. As
we can see from these tables, the current predictor iNuc-PseKNC
obviously outperformed its counterparts in identifying nucleo-
somes measured by all the four metrics as deﬁned in Equation
(11) as well as by AUROC, indicating that the novel approach by
introducing the ‘PseKNC’ to represent DNA samples is really
very useful.

For example, it was reported last year that the overall success
rate in identifying nucleosomes achieved by iNuc-PhysChem
(Chen et al., 2012b) via the 5-fold cross-validation test was
96%, higher than that by any of its counterparts. Such a high
rate, however, was derived from the benchmark dataset collected
from S.cerevisiae without undergoing a rigorous screening pro-
cedure to exclude the high similarity sequences, just like the
benchmark datasets used by its then counterparts. Now, let us
see what happened if the identiﬁcation was made by the current
predictor iNuc-PseKNC on the same benchmark dataset via the
same test method. The results thus obtained are given in Table S6
Supplementary Material S4, from which we can see that the rates
for Sn, Sp and Acc by iNuc-PseKNC on the same benchmark
dataset as used by iNuc-PhysChem (Chen et al., 2012b) were all
100%!

4 WEB-SERVER GUIDE OR PROTOCOL

For the convenience of the vast majority of experimental scien-
tists, let us give a step-by-step guide on how to use the iNuc-
PseKNC web-server to get their desired results without the need
to follow the complicated mathematic equations that were pre-
sented just for the integrity in developing the predictor. The de-
tailed steps are as follows.

Step 1. On opening the web server at http://1in.uestc.edu.cn/
server/iNuc-PseKNC, the top page of iNuc-PseKNC on
computer screen will be seen, as shown in Figure 6.
Clicking the ‘Read Me’ button will give a brief introduction
about the predictor and the caveat when using it.

Step 2. On clicking the open circle, the organism concerned
will be selected. Either typed or copy/pasted the query DNA
sequences into the input box at the center of Figure 6. The
input sequence should be in the FASTA format. A sequence
in FASTA format consists of a single initial line beginning
with a greater than symbol (‘>’) in the ﬁrst column, followed
by lines of sequence data. The words right after the ‘>’
symbol in the single initial line are optional and only used
for the purpose of identiﬁcation and description. The se-
quence ends if another line starting with a ‘>’ appears; this
indicates the start of another sequence. Example sequences
in FASTA format can be seen by clicking on the ‘Example’
button right above the input box.

Step 3. To see the predicted result, the ‘Submit’ button has to
be clicked. For example, if the three query DNA sequences

are used from the H .sapiens species in the ‘Example’ window
as the input and checking on the ‘H.sapiens’ button, after
clicking the ‘Submit’ button, the following shown on
the screen of the computer will be seen: the outcome for the
ﬁrst query example (with 147-bp long) is ‘nucleosome’; the
outcome for the second query sample (with 147-bp long) is
‘linker’; the outcome for the third query sample (with 23 8-bp
long) contains 238 — 147 + 1 = 92 sub-results, in which the
outcomes for the segments from #1 to #11 are of ‘linker’,
those for the segments from #72 to #92 are of ‘nucleosome’
and those from #49 to #71 are of ‘linker’. The nucleosome-
forming probabilities of these 92 sub-results are also pro-
vided. All these results are fully consistent with the experi-
mental observations. It takes about few seconds for the above
computation before the predicted result appears on your
computer screen; the more number of query sequences and
longer of each sequence, the more time it is usually needed.
To get the anticipated prediction accuracy, ‘the species
button consistent with the source of query sequences
always be checked’: if the query sequences are from
H.sapiens species, the “H.sapiens” button is checked; if
from C.elegan, the ‘C.elegan’ button is checked; if from
Dmelalogaster, the ‘Dmelalogaster’ button is checked.

Step 4. The ‘Data’ button is clicked to download the bench-
mark datasets used to train and test the iNuc-PseKNC
predictor.

Step 5. The ‘Citation’ button has to click to ﬁnd the relevant
papers that document the detailed development and algo-
rithm of iNuc-PseKNC.

Caveats. Each of the input query sequences must be 147 bp or
longer and only contains valid characters: ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘G’, ‘T’.

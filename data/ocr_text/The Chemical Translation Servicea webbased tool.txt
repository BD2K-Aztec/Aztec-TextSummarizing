ABSTRACT

Summary: Metabolomic publications and databases use different
database identifiers or even trivial names which disable queries
across databases or between studies. The best way to annotate
metabolites is by chemical structures, encoded by the International
Chemical Identifier code (lnChl) or lnCthey. We have implemented
a web-based Chemical Translation Service that performs batch
conversions of the most common compound identifiers, including
CAS, CHEBI, compound formulas, Human Metabolome Database
HMDB, lnChl, lnCthey, IUPAC name, KEGG, LipidMaps, PubChem
C|D+S|D, SMILES and chemical synonym names. Batch conversion
downloads of 1410 Cle are performed in 2.5 min. Structures are
automatically displayed.

Implementation: The software was implemented in Groovy and
JAVA, the web frontend was implemented in GRAILS and the
database used was PostgreSQL.

Availability: The source code and an online web interface are freely
available. Chemical Translation Service (CTS): http://cts.fiehnlab.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) proposed the use
of database identiﬁers for publishing reports in peer-reviewed
journals or in data repositories (Sumner et al., 2007), but the MSI
did not specify best practice standards which identiﬁer to use.
Consequently, metabolomic data are presented by a wide variety
of identiﬁers, mostly using publicly available databases such as
KEGG, HMDB or PubChem. In other cases, authors merely use
compound names without referencing to databases. Compound
names are very poor descriptors (Kind et al., 2009) as names often
cannot be unambiguously mapped to authentic chemical structures,
either because of missing chiral information (D, L) or because each
chemical structure is associated with many synonym names, some of
which may also be used for other structures. In addition, no database
contains all identiﬁers of all other repositories. For example,
KEGG LIGAND is a popular biochemical pathways database, but
it is incomplete for many compounds found in human organs as

given in the Human Metabolome database HMDB. Although each
database lists outlinks to other databases, no single database provides
comprehensive mapping options to other databases, and rarely there
are batch query options offered.

Analytical chemists and biochemists may not be used to standard
structure codes or lack expertise for downloading databases or
installing software. We here present a publicly available tool that
enables researchers to quickly convert lists of compound database
identiﬁers, including the important InChI Keys.

Software: The Chemical Translation Service (CTS) was
implemented using the programming languages Groovy (V1.7) and
Java (V6.20). The open source web application framework Grails
1.2.2 and freely available plugins were used for the development of
web services. For data storage, the PostgreSQL database, an open-
source object-relational database management system was used.
Easy access from other languages and platforms is provided via
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) web services.

Hardware: The used hardware was a dual quad-core Intel X5450
Xeon based server with 16GB of RAM and an SSD (Solid State
Disk) storage array with three disks in a Raid-0 conﬁguration to
store the Lucene index ﬁles. The average disk throughput was
600 MB/s. An additional SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) storage array
with 16 disks in Raid-6 conﬁguration was used to store the database
content.

Source Code: The source code is hosted as a Google Code Project
at http://code.google.com/p/chemical—compound-repository/

Web Front End: The database is freely available under:
http://cts.ﬁehnlab.ucdavis.edu

2 RESULTS

The CTS consists of three major services.

(1) The Discovery Service detects chemicals in provided text
and returns a list of chemicals as CSV, TXT, XML or PDF.

(2) The Convert Service interconverts any chemical identiﬁer
into other chemical identiﬁers.

(3) The Batch Convert Service converts multiple identiﬁers of
the same type into multiple identiﬁers.

We recommend that users, especially chemists and biologists, use
CTS for standardizing metabolomic reports into MSI-compliant
formats before publishing data. Single identiﬁers can be converted
such as KEGG identiﬁer to PubChem ID, or SMILES to KEGG ID.
Importantly, batch convert services are supported (Table 1),

submitting multiple chemical identiﬁers of the same type and
yielding a table of user-selected other identiﬁers. We currently use
the CTS service for standardizing reports from different platforms
in collaborative projects.

We provide different download formats including CSV, XLS,
PDF and XML, in order to empower researchers to sort, compare
and arrange properties of their lists in standard ofﬁce software.
For example, L—valine and valine differ only in the description of
stereoconﬁguration. Sorting via the atom connectivity part of the
InChI hash keys (labeled red in Table 1) facilitates recognition
of isomers or detection of doublets. It is apparent that databases
deal differently with stereo conﬁgurations, as LipidMaps does not
provide valine in its regular L-conﬁguration whereas HMDB does
and KEGG provides both valine enantiomers. Other metabolites
such as pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, is given by all
databases, whereas the achiral form of N -carbamoylglutamate is
not represented in any other database.

The Chemical Discovery Service annotates chemicals from any
given text submitted in ASCII format by text mining. A hybrid
approach using word stop-lists and fuzzy regular expression
matching was used for detection of chemicals and a subsequent
database matching was used for the output of all possible chemical
identiﬁers. For example, 269 chemical names were given in the
supplementary material of a published non-MSI compliant report
(Sreekumar et al., 2009). These names could be read into 195
structures via synonym queries, e.g. for overlap analysis with
other platforms or query of related studies. Misspelled compounds
(‘nonate’) did not retrieve hits.

In comparison to the Chemical Resolver Identiﬁer beta2
(Sitzmann, 2009), the CTS software comprises more commonly used
database compound identiﬁer inputs and allows any combination of
output identiﬁers. Importantly, CTS also enables batch queries, a
feature that is not given in other resources including the recently
published MetMask tool (Redestig et al., 2010). MetMask requires
installation of in-house databases and provides only limited services
via web based queries. CTS maintains high-query speeds because all
required data were downloaded from publicly available databases
(except CAS) into a new in-house DB. Due to the proprietary
nature of the Chemical Abstract Services CAS, these database
identiﬁers are incomplete as only publicly available CAS numbers
were downloaded. At present, the CTS database hosts 3.8 million
entries which are indexed by InChI hash keys but continues to grow
in size limited by PubChem data import speed. The CTS input
databases are renewed monthly for new DB updates (e. g. HMDB,
LipidMaps, KEGG).

The following advantages distinguish the CTS from other
services:

0 Generic compound searches over millions of compounds; can
be limited by source DB query language and Lucene index.

0 Regular-expression-based discovery of existing chemical
names in any given text.

0 Batch- or single-conversion of many publicly available
chemical identiﬁers. Further databases (MetaCyc) are being
added.

0 Export of results into different formats including CSV, XLS,
PDF and XML.

0 Access via simple and intuitive web GUIs, optimized for
the most common web browsers including Mozilla Firefox,
Microsoft Internet Explorer and Apple Safari.

0 Access via SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) web
services, enabling other programming languages and platforms.

0 InChI hash keys as main link between identiﬁers, providing
structure-based indexing. InChI codes can be used in chemical
databases for extensive substructure comparisons.

0 Inclusion of further compound information, from monoisotope
exact masses to proton donor potential, aiding identiﬁcations
in mass spectrometry based metabolomic proﬁles.

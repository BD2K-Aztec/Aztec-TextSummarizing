Abstract

Motivation: Atomic resolution modeling of large multimolecular assemblies is a key task in
Structural Cell Biology. Experimental techniques can provide atomic resolution structures of single
proteins and small complexes, or low resolution data of large multimolecular complexes.

Results: We present a novel integrative computational modeling method, which integrates
both low and high resolution experimental data. The algorithm accepts as input atomic resolution
structures of the individual subunits obtained from X—ray, NMR or homology modeling, and inter—
action data between the subunits obtained from mass spectrometry. The optimal assembly of the
individual subunits is formulated as an Integer Linear Programming task. The method was tested
on several representative complexes, both in the bound and unbound cases. It placed correctly
most of the subunits of multimolecular complexes of up to 16 subunits and significantly outper—
formed the Comeock and Haddock multimolecular docking methods.

1 Introduction

Many cellular processes are performed by multimolecular protein
complexes (Krogan et 61]., 2006). A cell consists of hundreds of
different functional complexes, such as the RNA exosome, the pro—
teasome and the nuclear pore complex (Robinson et 61]., 2007).
Detailed structural characterization of such complexes is a primary
goal of structural biology. However, structural characterization
of large complexes by high resolution experimental techniques, such
as X—ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, is challenging,
whereas electron microscopy or mass spectrometry (MS) produce
low resolution data (Alber et 61]., 2007). It is becoming clear that in—
tegration of data derived from a variety of bio—physical techniques
at multiple levels of resolution is essential for the structural analysis
of large complexes (Thalassinos et 61]., 2013).

In the last couple of decades significant progress has been
achieved in computational modeling of binary protein—protein

complexes as has been showcased in the CAPRI (Critical Assessment
of Prediction of Interactions) challenge (Chen and Weng, 2002;
Dominguez et 61]., 2003; Duhovny et 61]., 2002; Gray et 61]., 2003;
Janin, 2010; Kozakov et 61]., 2006). However, only a handful of
methods has been developed for the modeling of multimolecular
complexes. The better performing ones have been limited to sym—
metric homo—oligomers (Andre et 61]., 2007; Berchanski and
Eisenstein, 2003; Comeau and Camacho, 2005; Pierce et 61]., 2005;
Schneidman—Duhovny et 61]., 2005a). For the non—symmetric case,
we have previously developed Comeock (Inbar et 61]., 2005),
which formulates the multimolecular complex detection task as a
search for an optimally scoring spanning tree of the complex subunit
interactions graph. The optimization is done by a branch and bound
technique. The multimolecular version of Haddock (Karaca et 61].,
2010) is driven by experimental and bioinformatics data, but limits
the number of subunits to six, apparently due to computational

complexity constraints. Multi—LZerD (Esquivel—Rodriguez et al.,
2012) builds the multimolecular assembly applying a stochastic
search driven by a genetic algorithm. Kuzu et al. (2014) construct
the multimolecular complex iteratively, where at each iteration the
subassembly is grown by one subunit. Hall et al. (2012) model the
complexes at a coarse grained resolution, where proteins are repre—
sented by single spheres. Experimental MS—based data is translated
into spatial restraints and integrated into the scoring function using
the IMP platform (Russel et al., 2012). The generation of candidate
models is done by an exhaustive Monte Carlo search of the con—
formational space.

The large multimolecular assembly task can be divided into two
subtasks: (a) Detection of the protein—protein interaction graph be-
tween the individual subunits; (b) Detection of a globally consistent
pose of the subunits, so that there are no steric clashes between them
and the binding energy of the whole complex is optimized.

Low resolution experimental data obtained from MS is espe—
cially suitable to assist in subtask (a). In particular, native MS of
intact protein complexes and their subcomplexes can determine the
stoichiometry of the complex subunits and deduce the interaction
graph of the multimolecular complex (Taverner et al., 2008).
Chemical cross-linking combined with MS (XL—MS) provides dis—
tance constraints between surface residues both on the same and on
neighboring subunits (Leitner et al., 2010), thus providing informa-
tion both for the detection of the interaction graph as well as con—
straints on the relative spatial poses of neighboring subunits. Such
constraints have been successfully exploited in the modeling of the
26S proteasome (Lasker et al., 2012), the proteasome lid (Politis
et al., 2014), the TRiC/CCT chaperonin (Kalisman et al., 2012;
Leitner et al., 2012), the RNA polymerase II—TFIIF complex (Chen
et al., 2010) and more.

Here, we introduce DockStar, a novel protein assembly modeling
algorithm which integrates MS—based data. We assume knowledge
of the subunit interaction graph [subtask (a)] and focus on a global
solution to the ‘3D—puzzle assembly’ task [subtask (b)]. Our algo—
rithm performs a search for assemblies, optimizing satisfaction of
cross-linking restraints as well as a knowledge—based interaction po—
tential between neighboring subunits. The optimization is performed
by formulating the task as an Integer Linear Program (ILP), thus not
depending neither on greedy type iterative algorithms, which tend to
miss solutions with low scoring intermediates, nor on time consum—
ing Monte Carlo type search. This enables efficient handling of rela-
tively large assemblies.

To validate this method, DockStar was tested on a set of ex—
amples, where both high resolution structures of the full complex
and cross—linking data between neighboring subunits was available.
The modeling was performed both in bound and unbound scenarios
and compared with the state of the art Haddock (Karaca et al.,
2010) and Comeock (Inbar et al., 2005) multimolecular assembly
algorithms. DockStar proved to be significantly more time efficient
than the other methods, while exhibiting better performance.

2 Methods

DockStar receives as input a set of subunit structures, the subunit
interaction graph and (optionally) a set of cross—linked residue pairs.
It applies a pairwise (soft) docking algorithm to compute candidate
docking poses for neighboring subunits, which are deduced from the
interaction graph. The pairwise docking hypotheses are assembled
into globally optimal multimolecular complex hypotheses by an
ILP-based optimization algorithm. The final output is a ranked set

of 3D complex structures, which are scored by the binding energy
between the interacting subunits and satisfaction of the cross—links
induced distance restraints. More specifically, the method is com—
posed of the following steps (Supplementary Fig. S1 in the
Supplementary Materials):

1. Generation of transformation sets. The aim of this step is to pro-
duce an initial set of candidate 3D poses (rigid transformations)
for each subunit.

2. Pairwise scoring. A (docking) pair of candidate transformations
belonging to different subunits is scored according to the quality
of the resulting interface between the transformed subunits. The
scoring function takes into account the number of satisﬁed
cross—link restraints and a knowledge—based potential.

3. Choice of globally optimal solutions. A solution includes one
rigid transformation for each subunit. The transformations are
chosen to optimize the sum of the resulting interfaces scores.
This optimization problem is solved by formulating the task as
an ILP. The algorithm is tuned to produce a ranked set of K
(user predeﬁned) best solutions.

4. Integration of partial solutions. In some cases, the method of
choice for generating the transformation sets limits the algo—
rithm to deal only with complexes in which one subunit interacts
with all the other subunits (interaction graph with a star shaped
spanning tree). In such a case, the interaction graph of the whole
complex is partitioned into (overlapping) subcomplexes with
star shaped spanning trees, and the top scoring solutions for the
subcomplexes are reintegrated to detect global solutions to cover
the whole complex (Supplementary Fig. S2).

2.1 Generation of transformation sets
In the first stage of the algorithm for each subunit a set of candidate
rigid transformations is generated. These transformations are ob—
tained from the top scoring docking poses of neighboring subunits.
However, when modeling multimolecular complexes, it is important
to ensure that all these transformations are consistent, namely, refer
to the same 3D reference frame. Therefore, one subunit is chosen as
an anchor subunit, and its coordinate system is used as the 3D refer—
ence frame for all the other subunits. Preferably, the anchor subunit
should have the largest number of neighbors in the multimolecular
assembly interaction graph. All other subunits which are known to
interact with the anchor are then docked to it. Hence, in this case,
transformation sets are generated only for the anchor and its
neighbors requiring a star shaped spanning tree topology of the
interaction graph. In cases where the interaction graph of the com—
plex does not have a star shaped spanning tree, the complex is div—
ided to sub—complexes with star shaped spanning trees, that are
solved independently and then the top solutions are integrated to
cover the whole complex. The docking step is carried out by the
PatchDock (Duhovny et al., 2002) algorithm, which optimizes shape
complementarity, while satisfying distance constraints between resi—
dues of neighboring subunits, if such constraints are available. In
our examples the cross—link induced maximal distance constraint,
which includes the linker and extended residue lengths, was set
to 30A (Rappsilber, 2011). The top 1000 PatchDock transform-
ations are refined, rescored and reranked by the FiberDock
(Mashiach et al., 2010) algorithm. For each subunit, a predefined
number of top ranked transformations is chosen as the subunit
transformation set.

Using an anchor subunit as a 3D reference frame for a subcom—
plex with a star shaped spanning tree is the ‘method of choice’ in the
difficult cases, where no additional data is available. However, if a

homologous complex or an intermediate resolution cryo—EM map of
the complex is available, one can compute the transformations by
aligning the atomic resolution subunit structures to the (homologous
or lower resolution) template complex.

2.2 Pairwise scoring

For each of the 11 subunits, let P,- (0 £1 < n) be subunit 1' and T(P,-)
be the set of candidate transformations received from the previous
stage for subunit P,. Let T,), be transformation r of subunit P,- and
S(T,-),, T“) the pairwise interaction score of subunits P,- and P,- trans—
formed by T,-), and Ti)” respectively.

Each pair of transformations Ti), and Ti)” where 1' 31$ 1', is scored
by the number of satisfied cross—link constraints between the trans—
formed subunits. In case of equality, the interfaces generated be—
tween the subunits are ranked according to the recently published
statistically optimized atomic potentials (SOAP—PP) score (Dong
et al., 2013).

2.3 Choice of a globally optimal transformation set
The globally optimal solution Sol includes one transformation per
subunit and maximizes score(Sol) defined as:

score(Sol) : S (T4,, T”) (1)
Ti)r,Ti)5 E 501 H  

Graph theoretic formulation of the optimization task. This opti-
mization task can be formulated as the following graph theoretic
problem (Supplementary Fig. S9). Let G : (V,E) be an undirected
n—partite graph with vertex set V : V0 U - - - U Vn_1, so that for each
transformation Ti), E T(P,-) there is a vertex 14,-), E V). Each pair of
vertices is joined by an edge:

E : {(uz,nvi,s)|“z.r E viii/13$ E viii 7g  (2)
with the weight:

w(ui,ra 171,5) : S(Ti,ra Ti,s) V(“i,ra 171,5) E E 

The optimal solution is achieved by choosing one vertex per V,- that
maximizes the edge—weight of the induced sub—graph.

ILP formulation. The above graph theoretic task can be formu—
lated as an ILP (Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1988). Define a variable
X,), for each vertex 14,-), E V and a variable Yi),),-)S for each edge
e = (141),, 12,-)5) E E as follows:

1 if 14,-), is chosen
x... = . <4)
0 otherw1se
1 if both 14,-), and 12,-), are chosen
i,r,i,s _ _ 
0 otherw1se

The ILP objective function is:

Maximize score(Sol) : Z w(u,-),, 11,-)S)Y,-),),-)S (6)
(ui),,1/,-)5)EE
Subject to the constraints:
Zx,),=1 Vi,0£i<n (7)
ui)r€Vi
Z Y,),),-)S =X,~)S Vj,s,i, 1' 7A 1' (8)
14,-),EV,-

The objective function (Eq. 6) is exactly the edge—weight of the
chosen sub—graph. The first constraint (Eq. 7) ensures that exactly

one transformation is chosen for each subunit. The second con—
straint (Eq. 8) ensures that an edge is chosen if and only if both verti—
ces that it connects are chosen as well.

The ILP step was solved by the CPLEX 12.5 package (http://
www.ilog.com/products/cplex/).

Missing subunit. Although the previous formulation ensures the
choice of exactly one transformation per subunit, in a practical set—
ting it might occur that no reasonably scoring candidate transform—
ation exists at all for some of the subunits, due, for example, to poor
homology modeling. In such a case, one would like to return a par—
tial solution. To handle this event an extra transformation is added
to each subunit transformation set—the blank transformation. This
transformation represents a situation where a solution for this sub—
unit is ‘missing’. The pairwise score of this transformation with any
transformation of another subunit is set to zero. Therefore, a solu—
tion with missing subunits will be chosen if there is no full solution
(with all subunits) with a higher score.

Alternative solutions. The method presented above outputs
one single highest scoring global solution. To retrieve additional high
scoring solutions, the ILP step is applied iteratively to find a solution
that maximizes the objective function and was not chosen before. To
achieve it a linear constraint is introduced for each previously ob—
tained solution F. Define: VXi), F(X,-),) : 1 ¢> X,), was chosen in so—
lution P. Then add the following constraint to the ILP constraint set:

2 x,), < n (9)

F(X,-),)=1

This constraint promises that solution P will not be chosen again.

2.4 Integration of partial solutions

The presentation above deals with complexes having a star shaped
spanning tree, where an anchor subunit, which interacts with all the
other subunits, can be chosen. However, this is a special case. To
apply the method for arbitrary complexes, they are divided into
overlapping sub—complexes, each with a star shaped spanning tree,
which are solved separately as above. Then, top solutions of sub—
complexes that share a subunit are merged, while defining the
shared subunit as the new ‘anchor’. All the transformations in the
merged (new) subcomplex are recalculated vis—a—vis the reference
frame of the new ‘anchor’. These new transformation sets are used
as input for steps 2—4 of the algorithm in order to solve the larger
sub—complex. In several such iterations one can cover all the sub—
units of the assembly.

3 Results

DockStar is a multimolecular docking method which integrates ex—
perimental cross—links and graph topology data. The method was
tested on a diverse dataset, which included bound and unbound ex—
amples, different numbers of complex subunits (from 3 to 16), and
diverse additional experimental data (see summary of results in
Table 1). The method was compared with the state of the art
Comeock and Haddock multimolecular docking methods. All run-
ning times were measured on a 12 core XEON 3.06 GHz server.

Below we present in detail the results for several large com—
plexes. Additional data, including figures, can be found in the
Supplementary Materials.

were found using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) and HHBLITS
(Remmert et al., 2012) and were modeled with MODELLER (Webb
and Sali, 2014).

3.2 Assessment criteria

The assessment of the quality of the resulting solutions was deter—
mined by three measures: (i) global Coc—RMSD between the predicted
complex and the (known) native complex, (ii) i—RMSDbb (interface
RMSD of the backbone) and (iii) Fnat (fraction of native contacts)
between interacting subunits of the complex interaction graph span-
ning tree (Supplementary Materials for comprehensive Fnat and
i-RMSDbb definitions). The interacting subunit interface prediction
quality was divided into four categories (the three first follow the
CAPRI challenge definition): high quality predictions (FnatZ 0.5
and i—RMSDbb g 1.0 A), medium predictions (Fnat 2 0.3 and
i—RMSDbb g 2.0 A), acceptable predictions (Fnat 2 0.1 and
i-RMSDbb 34.01%) and lenient predictions (i-RMSDbb g 8.0 A).
The lenient criterion was introduced, since analysis of docking fun—
nels suggested that predictions with i—RMSDbb up to 8—10  can be
locally minimized and refined to near native structures (Hunjan
et al., 2008; Kundrotas et al., 2010).

3.3 The complexes modeled

PP2A. The protein phosphatase 2A has a key role in regulating di—
verse signaling pathways including cell growth, differentiation,
apoptosis, cell motility, the DNA damage response and cell cycle
progression (Janssens and Goris, 2001; Wurzenberger and Gerlich,
201 1). The complex in its active form is composed of a catalytic sub—
unit C, a scaffold subunit A and a regulatory subunit B
(Wurzenberger and Gerlich, 2011). Cross—link data of this complex
is available (Herzog et al., 2012; Kahraman et al., 2013) as well as
the 3D atomic resolution of the subunits (Xu et al., 2009). The
cross—link data includes three inter cross—links. As all inter cross—
links included subunit A. This subunit was used as the anchor sub—
unit and subunits B and C were docked to it using PatchDock with
the inter cross—links as distance constraints. The top scored 50
PatchDock—I—FiberDock solutions were used as candidate transform—
ations for DockStar.

In the bound case, out of N 2.6 X 103 possible solutions (the
number of all possible solutions is the product of the size of the
transformations set of each subunit), the first solution was correct
with only 0.6  average i—RMSDbb of the predicted interfaces and
low global Cor—RMSD of 0.68A [Fig. 1a, Table 1, Supplementary
Table S1 in the Supplementary Materials]. The runtime of DockStar

on this example was <32 min for the pairwise scoring step and
1:16 min for the ILP step.

In the unbound case, MODELLER was used to calculate the
structures of the individual subunits according to templates with se—
quence identity of 40 to 100% (Supplementary Table S2). These cal—
culated models had 1.9—5 .3  RMSD to the bound native subunits.
Sets of 50 alternative transformations for B and C were created by
taking the best 50 scored docking results of PatchDock—I—FiberDock
for the pairs AB and AC as in the bound case. In these sets, the
smallest i—RMSDbb of subunits AB and AC were 5.6 and 5.8 A, re—
spectively. The first solution of DockStar included these best trans—
formations (Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. S3B) and the global
Cor—RMSD of this solution was 6.9A (Table 1). The major reason for
this relatively high i—RMSDbb is due to the limited accuracy of the
homology modeling. The homologous models of subunits B and C
have 5.3 and 3.2A RMSD to the native, respectively. The run time
was 40 min for the pairwise scoring step and 2 min for the ILP step.

Beef Liver Catalase. The beef liver catalase is a common homote—
tramer, which catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen pyroxide to
water and oxygen (Ko et al., 1999). Its subunits contain a hem group
and a NADPH molecule. Cross—link data of this complex is available
(Kahraman et al., 2013; Lauber and Reilly, 2010) and includes three
inter cross—links that connect subunits: B—D, B—C, A—D. Therefore,
the complex was solved in two steps. First, subunits B and D were
selected as anchor subunits and the complexes D-B-C and A-D-B
were solved. Then, the top 100 results from the previous run were
merged by applying a second run.

In the bound case, the first solution was correct with three out of
three high quality interface predictions (with average i—RMSDbb of
0.54 A) and global Cor—RMSD of only 0.85  to the native (Fig. 1b,
Table 1, Supplementary Table S2). The run time in this case was
35 min and 1:48 min for the pairwise scoring step and the ILP step
of the first run, respectively; 2:13h and 1:14 min for the pairwise
scoring step and the ILP step of the second run.

For the unbound case, each of the subunits was modeled accord—
ing to the human erythrocyte catalase template with sequence iden—
tity of 91% to the beef liver catalase and the obtained models had
average RMSD of 0.73  to the native bound structures
(Supplementary Table S2). The first solution had three medium
quality interfaces (with average i—RMSDbb of 1.57A) and global
Cor—RMSD of only 2.7A to the native (Table 1, Supplementary
Table S3, Supplementary Fig. S4B). The run time in this case was
56 min and 1:43 min for the pairwise scoring step and the ILP step
of the first run respectively; 2:51 h and 3:39 min for the pairwise
scoring step and the ILP step of the second run.

RNA polymerase II. In eukaryotic cells, RNA pol II catalyses
mRNA synthesis during transcription of protein—coding genes. This
large asymmetric complex is composed of 12 subunits: a 10—subunit
catalytic core (pr1—3,5,6,8—12) and a complex of two subunits
(pr4/7) (Cramer, 2004). The two big core subunits pr1/2 are
connected to all other subunits except of pr4, which is connected
to the complex through pr7. Data which includes 34 inter cross—
links is available (Chen et al., 2010; Kahraman et al., 2013).

We have solved the complex both in the ‘bound’ and ‘unbound’
scenarios. In both cases, first the two big core subunits (pr1/2) were
docked to each other using PatchDock—I—FiberDock (Duhovny et al.,
2002; Mashiach et al., 2010; Schneidman—Duhovny et al., 2005b).
Then, all other nine subunits were docked to the pr1/2 complex.
Finally, DockStar was executed with sets of the top 200 FiberDock
candidate transformations and the inter cross—link data.

For the bound case, the complex subunits from PDB 1WCM
(Armache et al., 2005) were used. DockStar’s first solution predicted
correctly 9 out of the 10 interfaces and had 7.9  global Cor—RMSD
of the 10 subunits subcomplex relative to the native. The average i—
RMSDbb was 1.85  (Fig. 1c, Table 1, Supplementary Fig. S5 and
Table S1 in the Supplementary Materials). This solution satisfied 32
out of the 34 inter cross—links. The run time of this example was
4:35 h for the pairwise scoring step and 18:22 min for the ILP step.

In the unbound case, models of the different subunits were gener—
ated using homology modeling templates ranging from 33 to 100%
sequence identity to the native subunits. Unbound structures were
modeled with an average RMSD of 2.8  (Supplementary Table S2).
The third ranked DockStar solution predicted correctly eight inter—
faces with an average of 3.0A i—RMSDbb relative to the native
structure (Supplementary Fig. S6 and Table S3). The global Coc—
RMSD of the solution subcomplex of these nine correctly trans—
formed subunits is only 4.8  (Table 1) satisfying 31 out of the 34
inter cross-links. The runtime in this example was 4:47h for the
pairwise scoring step and <4 min for the ILP step.

Yeast Exosome. The exosome complex is the main cellular ma-
chinery responsible for degrading RNA molecules (Mitchell et al.,
1997). The interaction graph of this 10 subunits complex was
deduced by the SUMMIT algorithm based on native MS experimen-
tal data (Taverner et al., 2008). The core of the complex consists of
a six subunit ring (Rrp41-Rrp42-Mtr3-Rrp43-Rrp46-Rrp45) and
the remaining four subunits (Rrp4, Rrp40, Csl4, Dis3) interact with
the ring subunits (Supplementary Fig. S8A). Later, an X—Ray struc—
ture was published (Makino et al., 2013). Because this complex
spanning tree is non-star shaped, it was modeled in three rounds
with different anchor units for each round (see Supplementary Fig.
S8 for a detailed explanation).

In the bound case, the top ranked solution by DockStar cor—
rectly predicted seven out of the nine interfaces of the complex
interaction graph spanning tree, (Fig. 1d) with average i—RMSDbb
of 1.72A (Supplementary Table S1) and 5.1  global Cor—RMSD
of the eight subunits subcomplex that includes only the correct
interactions (Table 1). The total run time of this example was
10:34 h.

In the unbound case, for 3 out of the 10 subunits the structure
similarity between the homology modeled and the native structures
was large (above 15A RMSD). In these cases (subunits: Rrp43,
Mtr3, Dis3), the bound structures were used. The other homologous
templates had 21—100% sequence identity to the native subunits
with an average of 36%. The modeled structures had RMSD range
of 1.9—10.5  to the native bound structures (Supplementary Table
S2). This is a difficult example for which there is no cross—links data
and the unbound subunits have large RMSDs to the native. Despite
that, the 12th solution of DockStar predicted correctly four inter—
faces with 3.5  average i—RMSDbb (Supplementary Fig. S7D and
Table S3). The global Cor—RMSD of the subcomplex that includes
only these interactions was 6.0A (Table 1). The total run time was
11:22 h.

TRiC/CCT. The eukaryotic TRiC chaperonin plays a central
role in assisting the folding of polypeptide chains (Spiess et al.,
2004). In its open state the chaperonin binds the substrate, while in
its closed state, the substrate is inserted into a large cavity where
folding occurs (Reissmann et al., 2007). The eukaryotic TRiC chap—
eronin is composed of 16 subunits, two copies of eight different sub—
units, that are arranged in two octameric rings (Ditzel et al., 1998).
Although each ring consists of eight different subunits the order of
which allows specific substrate binding modes (Martin—Benito et al.,
2007), the sequence identity between the different subunits in the
same organism is 30% resulting in high structural identity, which
makes reliable identification of the subunit order difficult as the sub—
units look almost the same in low resolution maps (Booth et al.,
2008; Cong et al., 2010; Dekker et al., 2011; Spiess et al., 2004).

Both Kalisman et al. (2012) and Leitner et al. (2012) have used
cross—link data to determine the correct order of the subunits in the
eukaryotic bos taurus chaperonin, yet their methods are highly time
consuming. Here, DockStar was applied to the cross—link data pub—
lished by these two groups to detect the same structure in 10 and
14 min of CPU time, respectively. The published experimental data—
sets were used independently. First, all the individual subunits were
modeled by homology modeling according to the homo—oligomer
Thermococcus chaperonin closed state (Shomura et al., 2004) that
has 34—40% sequence identity with the subunits (Supplementary
Table S2). Then, 3D rigid transformation sets were generated by

structurally aligning each of the different modeled subunits with
each of the Thermococcus chaperonin subunits. Sixteen subunits
were used as input—two copies for each of the eight different sub—
units. Each copy has a set of eight 3D rigid transformations for the
different locations in the octameric ring.

The first cross—link set was taken from Kalisman et al. (2012).
Out of 63 high confidence cross—links, 17 are cross—links between
different subunits. The top ranked solution (Fig. 1e) was identical to
the solution obtained by Kalisman et al. (2012) and Leitner et al.
(2012). This solution satisfied 15 cross—links out of the 17. The total
runtime of the algorithm in this example was <10 min.

The second cross—link set (Leitner et al., 2012) included 87 cross—
links between different subunits. As in the first case, the top solution
was identical to the solution obtained by Kalisman et al. (2012) and
Leitner et al. (2012), and it satisfied 67 cross—links out of the 87.
The total run time was 14 min.

3.4 Comparison with other methods

DockStar was compared with the state of the art Haddock (Karaca
et al., 2010) and Comeock (Inbar et al., 2005 ). Here, the results of
the three methods were compared on the large complexes RNA polII,
Yeast Exosome, and the small complexes PP2A and Beef liver catalase.

Comparison with Comeock. Comeock is designed to model
multimolecular complexes from subunit data alone, without receiv—
ing interaction graph information. It gets as input 3D structures of
the subunits and a predefined number of top docking results of all
subunit pairs in the complex. In each iteration, Comeock produces
subcomplexes of size i from smaller subcomplexes produced in pre—
vious iterations and saves the K best scored structures. The pairwise
docking results were calculated by PatchDock with cross—links as
distance constraints. To perform a ‘fair’ comparison between
Comeock and DockStar, we have run Comeock twice on each
example. In the first run, the regular Comeock procedure was per—
formed. In the second run, we artificially provided Comeock the
interaction graph information by supplying PatchDock docking re-
sults for subunit pairs that are known to be in contact, while for the
non—contacting subunits random transformations were introduced.
The results are summarized in Supplementary Table S4 of the
Supplementary Materials. DockStar outperformed Comeock in all
the above mentioned examples. Although Comeock succeeds to
predict good solutions in most of the bound cases, this is not the
case in the unbound examples. Although the knowledge of the inter—
action graph improves performance, still in all of the unbound cases
Comeock succeeds to predict correctly only 0—2 of the interacting
pairs. In all cases, DockStar was able to rank good solutions higher
than Comeock. DockStar’s better ranking ability can be attributed
to its scoring function, which ranks first cross-link satisfaction, fol-
lowed by a SOAPs score (Dong et al., 2013), while Comeock uses
a purely shape complementarity—based scoring function. Also,
DockStar utilizes the ILP technique which returns an optimal scor—
ing solution in the majority of the cases.

Although in the small examples (3—4 subunits) Combdock’s runs
were extremely fast and lasted <2 min, in some of the large examples
(10—11 subunits), due to its exponential complexity, the runtime was
prohibitive. The efficiency of the Dockstar method is due to the ILP
technique which allows tackling problems with extremely large search
space as multimolecular modeling, in relatively short running time.

Comparison with HADDOCK. HADDOCK uses experimental
and/or bioinformatics data to predict the complex structure. This
data is translated to ambiguous and/or unambiguous restraints
which are integrated into the score function. Here, CPORT, a
Consensus Interface Predictor (de Vries and Bonvin, 2011), was

used to predict the interface residues of each subunit. Ambiguous
distance constraints between predicted interface residues of subunit
pairs that are known to interact (according to the interaction graph)
were generated using GenTBL. The cross—links data was used as un—
ambiguous constraints. As HADDOCK is limited to six subunits,
for the RNA polII and the Yeast Exosome examples (composed of
11 and 10 subunits, respectively) a subcomplex of six connected
subunits was chosen to be remodeled.

In the bound case, out of the four examples only one example
has completed its run, the PP2A. None of the PP2A solutions con-
tained a correct interface prediction. As there were no correct solu—
tion or sub—solution in the bound cases, HADDOCK was not tested
for the unbound cases.

4 Discussion

DockStar is a novel integrative multimolecular docking algorithm.
The method integrates experimental or modeled atomic resolution
individual protein subunit structure data with MS—based low reso—
lution data. The search for a globally optimal multimolecular assem—
bly is formulated as an ILP and, thus, efficiently solved in the
majority of the cases. The method can be applied in additional situ—
ations where (low resolution) complex data is obtained from elec—
tron microscopy or homologous complexes.

Future challenges include handling significant conformational
ﬂexibility of the modeled individual subunits.

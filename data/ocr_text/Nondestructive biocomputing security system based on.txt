ABSTRACT
Motivation: Biofuel cells (BFCs) based on enzymes and microbes
are the promising future alternative sources of sustainable electrical
energy under mild conditions (i.e. ambient temperature and neutral
pH). By combining the adaptive behavior of BFCs self-regulating
energy release with the versatility of biocomputing, we construct a
novel gas-controlled biocomputing security system, which could be
used as the potential implantable self-powered and ‘smart’ medical
system with the logic diagnosis aim.
Results: We have demonstrated a biocomputing security system
based on BFCs. Due to the unique ‘RESET’ reagent of N2 applied in
this work, the prepared biocomputing security system can be reset
and cycled for a large number of times with no ‘RESET’ reagent-
based ‘waste’. This would be advantageous for the potential practical
applications of such keypad lock as well as the development of
biocomputing security devices. In order to validate the universality
of the system and also to harvest energy directly from biofuels
with enhanced power output, we replace the glucose with orange
juice as the biofuel to operate BFCs-based biocomputing system,
which also possesses the function of keypad lock. In addition,
by introducing BFCs into the biocomputing security system, the
adaptive behavior of the BFCs self-regulating the power release
would be an immense advantage of such security keypad lock
devices in potential self-powered implantable medical systems.
The designed sequence gives the maximum power output and
discriminate itself from the rest of the sequences. From this, we
find that maximizing the dimensionless ratio of gap versus SD of
the power output spectrum (a funnel in power outputs) gives the
quantitative optimal design criterion. Therefore, our construction here
may also provide a practical example and microscopic structural
basis for mimicking the real biological network systems and
bridge the gaps between the theoretical concepts and experiments
important for biomolecular systems and synthetic biology.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biofuel cells (BFCs) based on enzymes (Cracknell et al., 2008) and
microbes (Logan et al., 2006) are the promising future alternative
sources of sustainable electrical energy under mild conditions
(i.e. ambient temperature and neutral pH). The uses of the biomass,
such as glucose, endogenously existing in the biological systems
suggest the important potential applications of BFCs as one kind
of implantable power sources for biomedical devices including
micropumps, pacemakers, neuromorphic circuits, etc. (Cracknell
et al., 2008; Logan et al., 2006). So such adaptive behavior of
the implantable BFC self—regulating the power release would be an
immense advantage of these bioelectronic devices (Cracknell et al.,
2008; Logan et al., 2006).

Logic lies at the heart of modern computers, and the components
that carry out its operations are logic gates (Szacilowski, 2008).
In electronic computers, logic gates are sculpted on the surface
of silicon wafers. Their inputs and outputs are electrical voltages,
but these are not the only systems that can form logic circuits. In
recent years, much research interest was directed to unconventional
chemical computing (de Silva and Uchiyama, 2007; de Silva et al.,
1993; Kompa and Levine, 2001; Szacilowski, 2008), performing
Boolean logic operations without the involvement of electronic
computers and responding to a large variety of activating input
signals in homogeneous solutions or at interfaces functionalized
with molecular/supramolecular moieties. Recently, the combination
of unconventional chemical logic gates and logic circuits has been
used for developing keypad locks based on unconventional chemical
system (Andréasson et al., 2009; Kumar et al., 2009; Kumar et al.,
2009a, b; Margulies et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2008; Suresh et al.,
2008). It is an attractive research goal in the area of unconventional
chemical computing and offers a new approach for protecting
information.

Biocomputing, belonging to a subarea of unconventional
chemical computing and performed by living organisms
(e.g. proteins/enzymes, DNA, RNA and whole biological cells)
(Amir et al., 2009; Halaimek et al., 2010; Halamek et al., 2010;
Konry and Walt, 2009; Simpson et al., 2001; Unger and Moult,
2006), is aiming at the information processing using biochemical
means. Two different branches of the biocomputing systems are
being developed in different directions. One is aiming at competing
with traditional electronic computation taking advantages of
parallel computing performed by numerous biomolecules (usually

represented by DNA computing) (Benenson et al., 2001). This is
expected to solve complex combinatorial problems faster and more
effectively than conventional computers. Another direction is not
aiming at any complex computation but rather creating a ‘smart’
information processing interface between biological and electronic
systems, operating as a logic information preprocessing unit (Amir
et al., 2009; Benenson et al., 2001; Halaimek et al., 2010; Halamek
et al., 2010; Konry and Walt, 2009; Zhou et al., 2010a, b, c).

In this work, by combining the adaptive behavior of the BFCs
self—regulating the energy release with the keypad lock function of
biocomputing system, we fabricated a novel reusable BFCs—based
biocomputing security system mimicking a keypad lock device.
Due to the unique non—destructive SET and RESET operations
on the system, such device can be readily ‘SET-RESET’ without
introducing any ‘RESET’ reagent—based ‘waste’. Additionally, by
replacing glucose with orange juice as the biofuel, the fabricated
BFC not only can operate with enhanced power output, but also can
be used as the biocomputing keypad lock. Furthermore, according to
the Boolean logic operations ‘programmed’ in such biocomputing
system, the proof—of—concept experiments with BFC operating in
serum, air injection mimicking dissolved oxygen in blood and
electrolyte—agitation mimicking blood ﬂow suggest that such device
could be used as the potential self—powered and ‘smart’ implantable
medical system with the diagnosis aim. And it can further mimic real
natural logic operations of genetic networks which may provide new
direction of the systems biology (Buchler et al., 2003; Davidson and
Erwin, 2006).

We performed a global study by analyzing the power output
spectrum of various input sequences. The designed sequence gives
the maximum power output and discriminates itself from the rest of
the sequences. From this, we ﬁnd that maximizing the dimensionless
ratio of gap versus SD of the power output spectrum (a funnel in
power outputs) gives the quantitative optimal design criterion.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Construction of miniature BFC

The BFCs—based non—destructive ‘SET-RESET’ keypad lock
system was developed on the basis of the compartment—less
glucose/02 BFC reported by us recently (see the details in
Fabrication of bioanode and biocathode in Materials and methods
part in the Supplementary Material): (Zhou et al., 2009) bioanode
with the immobilization of glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) exhibited
bioelectrocatalytic activity for oxidizing glucose. On the other hand,
biocathode was immobilized by laccase (LAC), an enzyme speciﬁc
for catalyzing a 4—electron reduction of 02 (Zhou et al., 2009).
The initial BFCs—based keypad lock system was composed of the
prepared compartment—less BFC operating in 2ml of quiescent
N2—saturated base solution [base solution: 0.1 M, pH 6.0, phosphate
buffer solution (PBS) containing 60mM glucose and 20 mM
NADTI

In order to get the reusable biocomputing security system,
we choose air injection (Input A), 02 injection (Input B) and
electrolyte agitation (Input C) as the non—destructive reading for the

system, which can be presented as the network composed of three
concatenated AND gates (Fig. 1). Each AND gate was activated
by two input signals: one of them a 2m] quiescent base solution
(saturated with N2, air or 02) and the second is an input [75 s of
air injection (pumping rate: 10 ml/s), 80 s of 02 injection (pumping
rate: 10 ml/s) or 5 s of electrolyte—agitation (stirring rate: 600 rpm)].
It should be noted that: (i) each input was operated only with
the applied time; (ii) the effect of gas injection on the maximum
power output (Pmax) of BFC was measured after gas injection;
(iii) the effect of electrolyte agitation on the Pmax value of BFC
was measured during the electrolyte agitation. The chemical input
signals for the system were considered as 1 when they are present
and 0 if they are absent. In order to distinguish the output state,
the Pmax value produced by the BFC is as the output signal of 1
when it is above the threshold of 130 uW/cm2 and the output signal
of 0 if it is below 130 uW/cmz. It also should be noteworthy that
the quiescent N2—saturated base solution for the ﬁrst AND gate was
always 1, while quiescent air—saturated base solution and quiescent
Oz—saturated base solution as input 1 for the second and the third
AND gates were produced in situ upon the air and 02 injections. In
addition, we restrict that each signal can be input only once in each
SET operation in this work.

By pumping 02 into air—saturated base solution (Input B), the
obtained base solution can be considered as Oz—saturated base
solution due to the same polarization curves in the Oz—saturated
base solution and in the obtained base solution at biocathode
(Supplementary Fig. Sl). Also due to the enhanced current
density for 02 reduction at biocathode, the Pmax value of BFC
(~98 uW/cm2 at +0.54V, Fig. 2A, c1) after Input B was higher
compared with that in air—saturated base solution (~39 uW/cm2 at
+0.54V, Fig. 2A, b1).

In the quiescent N2—saturated base solution (Initial State of
the keypad lock, Fig. 2A, a1), there was nearly no power output,
which is attributed to the lack of oxidizer (i.e. 02) supporting BFC
operation. After being pumped with air (Input A), the obtained base
solution can be considered as air—saturated base solution, because
the polarization curves of biocathode in the obtained base solution
and in the air—saturated base solution are the same (Supplementary
Fig. Sl). As shown in Figure 2A, the Pmax value of BFC after air
injection shows enhanced Pmax value (~39 uW/cm2 at +0.54 V, b1)
compared with Initial State (a1), because of the higher 02 reduction

PBS containing 60 mM glucose and 20 mM NAD+). Input A: 75 s of air
injection with the pumping rate of 10 ml/s. Input B: 80 s of 02 injection
with the pumping rate of 10 ml/s. Input C: 5 s of electrolyte agitation with
the stirring—rate of 600 rpm. RESET function: 300s of N2 injection with
the pumping rate of 10 ml s‘1. The effect of gas injection on the maximum
power output (Pmax) of BFC was measured after gas injection; the effect
of electrolyte agitation on the Pmax value of BFC was measured during the
electrolyte—agitation.

current density of biocathode after Input A (Fig. 2B, g2) than that
in N2—saturated base solution (Fig. 2B, f2).

Upon stirring the obtained Oz—saturated base solution (Input C),
the current density of biocathode (~1217 uA/cmz, near —I—0.34V,
Fig. 2B, i2) increased ~2.3—fold compared with that in the quiescent
Oz—saturated base solution (~523 uA/cmz, near —I—0.36V, Fig. 2B,
h2). Due to the unconstant convection state of base solution near
the biocathode during the stirring process, the current densities
are not stable. Based on the similar principle, stirring also led to
higher current density at bioanode (~1819 uA/cmz, near —I—0.14V,
Fig. 2B, d2) compared with that in the quiescent base solution
(~605 uA/cmz, near +0.07V, Fig. 2B, c2). On the basis of the
enhanced current densities at both biocathode and bioanode, the
BFC in the stirring Oz—saturated base solution exhibited higher Pmax
value (~219 uW/cm2 at +0.54 V, Fig. 2A, d1) compared with that in
the quiescent Oz—saturated base solution (~98 uW/cm2 at —I—0.54V,
Fig. 2A, cl).

The Pmax value obtained upon eight different combinations of
the three (A, B, C) input signals 0 or 1 are shown in Figure 3A,
Supplementary Figure 82A and Table Sl. Only one input signal
(1,1,1) resulted in the TRUE output signal 1. This means responses
obtained from the system correspond to the truth table expected
for the sequence of the concatenated AND gates. In addition, we
performed the experiments when the order of the input signals
was varied in six different combinations (Fig. 3B, Supplementary
Fig. 82B and Table S2). Only one correct order of the input signals
(ABC) resulted in the TRUE output signal 1 while all others

produced the FALSE output signal 0. Thus, the TRUE output signal
1 can be used to ‘open’ the lock while the FALSE signal 0 can result
in the ‘alarm’ signal indicating the wrong password.

Another important feature of the present keypad lock system
is that it can be reset (Supplementary Fig. S3). It should be
noteworthy that the ‘RESET’ reagent N2 applied in this work
was ‘nondestructive’, because RESET function did not affect the
concentration of other liquid—based solutes in the base solution
or introducing any ‘RESET’ reagent—based ‘waste’ into the base
solution.

3.2 Global understanding and optimal design criterion

In order to have a global understanding of the process, let us
start with a physical analysis of the results we got. We see that
every sequence of operations gives one power output as shown in
Supplementary Tables Sl, S2 and Sl +82. The sequences form a
power output spectrum, Figure 4. Only the (1,1,1) [equivalent of
(ABC)] sequence gives the largest power output. The rest of the
sequence generates power outputs less than that of (1,1,1) sequence.
Furthermore, the other power outputs are signiﬁcantly less than
that of (1,1,1) sequence. There is a signiﬁcant gap between the
power output of the sequence (1,1,1) and that from the rest of
the sequences. The discrimination separating the power output of
sequence (1,1,1) from the rest of the sequences can be clearly seen.
The power output spectrum here is similar to protein folding and
binding energy landscape spectrum. In protein folding (Wolynes
et al., 1995), binding (Wang and Verkhivker, 2003; Wang et al.,
2007) and signal transduction (Wang et al., 2006; 2008), the right
sequences of amino acid (or molecules for signal transduction) can
form a native functioned state with signiﬁcant energy gap separating
the native state (or destination for signal transduction) with the rest
of the other non—native states. The choice of the right sequences
for folding, binding and signal transduction is from the evolution
selection for stable and optimal function. Here the right sequence
of the circuit is selected and designed by us for function (molecular
keypad) by the exploration of the sequence space.

As we can see the sequences of the power outputs form a funneled
landscape with the power output of sequence (1,1,1) separating
from the rest, shown in Figure 4 and details in Supplementary
Tables 81—83. To quantify the degree of the discrimination, we

the fuel: (A) the power output spectrum for eight different sequence patterns
of input signals, derived from Figure 3A/Supplementary Table Sl. B) The
power output spectrum for six different orders of biochemical input signals,
derived from Figure 3B/Supplementary Table S2. C) The power output
spectrum for eight different sequence patterns of biochemical input signals
and six different order of biochemical input signals, derived from Figure
3/Supplementary Tables Sl +S2. 8PMX is the gap between the maximum
and average PmX values, APmaX is the SD measuring the variance of Pmax
values from the mean. The ratio A=8Pmax/APmax gives an absolute and
dimensionless measure of the degree of discrimination of maximum power
output with the rest. The power output spectrum therefore forms a funnel like
power output landscape with a large gap discriminating the best sequence
from the others.

introduce two quantities, the gap (6Pmax) and SD (APmax) of
the power output spectrum. The gap (6Pmax) that measures the
discrimination is deﬁned as the difference between the largest
power output of the sequence [(1,1,1) here] and the average power
outputs of the rest of the sequences. The SD (APmax) that measures
the dispersion is the square root of the variance of the power
outputs of the rest of the sequences. The ratio A =6PmaX/APmax
gives an absolute and dimensionless measure of the degree of
discrimination and funnel. When A is large (signiﬁcantly larger
than 1), the landscape or spectrum of the power output has a large
gap relative to the variations of other sequences that effectively
separates the (1,1,1) sequence from the rest of the other sequences.
This forms an effective funneled landscape of power output toward
the (1,1,1) sequence. Therefore, we can see that physically, a
funneled landscape toward the selected sequence quantiﬁed by the
ratio A=6Pmax/APmax provides an optimal design criterion for
discrimination of power outputs for molecular key pad function.

3.3 BFCs-based biocomputing keypad lock with
orange juice as the biofuel

In order to validate the universality of the system and also to
harvest energy directly from biofuels with enhanced power output,
we replace the glucose with orange juice (being pressed from
fresh orange) as the fuel to operate BFCs—based biocomputing
keypad lock. Figure 5A (1,1,1) shows that the Pmax value of BFC
operating in stirred Oz—saturated orange juice (~449 uW/cmz) is
~2—fold compared with that of stirred Oz—saturated glucose solution
[~219 uW/cmz, Fig. 3A (1,1,1) and Supplementary Fig. S4]. This
means glucose can be replaced by biofuel (i.e. orange juice in this
work) for such BFC to harvest energy with enhanced power output.
Recently, Dong’s group utilized fruit juice to increase the power
output of the BFC (Liu and Dong, 2007), and they attributed the
improved power output to many components in fruit juices, which

as the biofuel: (A) the bar diagram showing the Pmax value of BFC as

output signal 1. (B) The bar diagram showing the Pmax value of BFC as

can be oxidized by LAC (Sun et al., 2007). So in the current work,
the improved power output of the LAC—biocathode based BFC could
be also ascribed to the same reason.

Figure 5A exhibited the Pmax value obtained upon eight different
combinations of the three (A, B, C) input 0 or 1. And the responses
obtained from the system operating with orange juice as the biofuel
also correspond to the truth table expected for the sequence of the
concatenated AND gates, provided in the Supplementary Table S4.
In Figure 5B, only one correct order of the input signals (ABC)
resulted in the TRUE output signal 1 while all others produced the
FALSE output signal 0 (Supplementary Table SS). Thus, with the
biofuel (i.e. orange juice in this work), the fabricated BFC not only
can operate with enhanced power output but also can be used as
the biocomputing keypad lock. We also analyzed the power output
spectrum and found the large discrimination of maximum output
with the rest (a funnel) of the orange juice similar to the case of
glucose as the fuel. Details are given in Supplementary Figure SS
and Tables 84—86.

3.4 Potential application of BFCs-based biocomputing
keypad lock into implantable medical systems with
the self-powered diagnosis aim

Biomolecular logic and computation may also be applied to medical
intelligent diagnostics (Konry and Walt, 2009). In order to apply the
BFCs—based keypad lock into potential implantable medical systems
with the self—powered diagnosis aim, the BFC with 3 mM diameter
electrode as substrate for bioanode/biocathode mentioned above can
be modiﬁed to a miniature BFC with 33 um diameter microelectrode
(see the details in Construction of Miniature BFC in Materials and
methods part in the Supplementary Material). And the initial system
was composed of the prepared miniature BFC operating in 2ml of
quiescent N2—saturated serum containing 20 mM NADJr (mimicking
blood). In addition, the three input signals was changed to two
input signals: 75 s of air injection (pumping rate: 10 ml/s, Input A,
mimicking dissolved oxygen in blood) and 5 s of electrolyte agitation
(stirring rate: 600 rpm, Input B, mimicking blood ﬂow).

Figure 6A suggests that only when air injection and electrolyte
agitation are both present [Input (1,1)], the Pmax value of BFC
can get the maximum among the four patterns of the input signals;
accordingly, Output of Input (1,1) reaches 1. Thus, the system

that only one input signal (1,1) resulted in the TRUE output signal 1. (B) the
bar diagram showing the Pmax value of BFC as the output signals generated

corresponds to the truth table expected for the sequence of the two
concatenated AND gates (Supplementary Table S7). In addition,
only one correct order of the input signals (i.e. AB) resulted in
the TRUE output signal 1 while all others produced the FALSE
output signal 0 (Fig. 6B). So the developed system represents the
IMPLICATION logic operation and the sequence dependence of
inputs (i.e. AB) is mandatory for the BFCs—based biocomputing
keypad lock (Supplementary Table S8).

If we apply the BFCs—based keypad lock into potential
implantable medical systems, the medical indications of Output
0 [for Inputs (0,0) and (0,1) (1,0)] can be explained to the lack of
oxygen in blood [for Inputs (0,0) and (0,1)] and/or deceleration of
blood ﬂow [for Inputs (0,0) and (1,0)] (Guyton, 1981; Martin, 1999;
Tam et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2007), which could be attributed to the
ischemic state [for Inputs (0,0) and (0,1)] (Martin, 1999; Tam et al.,
2009), heart attack [for Inputs (0,0), (0,1) and (1,0)] (Martin, 1999;
Tam et al., 2009) and/or angiemphraxis [for Inputs (0,0) and (1,0)]
(Guyton, 1981; Taylor et al., 2007). And Output 0 for Input (BA)
can be interpreted to normal persons’ blood ﬂow rate slows down,
because of the angiemphraxis/heart attack (Guyton, 1981; Taylor
et al., 2007). Only Output 1 from Input (1,1) can be explained to the
normal physiological conditions. The detailed medical indications
for different patterns and different orders of input signals are shown
in Supplementary Tables S7—S8, which indicate the coexistence
of A and B and the correct input order of AB in the system are
both required for getting the information of ‘Normal physiological
conditions’. Therefore, in addition to the prominent feature of
keypad lock, the proof—of—concept experiments above suggest that
the fabricated BFCs—based biocomputing security system could be
potentially used to intellectually make logic decisions that whether
the dissolved oxygen concentration and body ﬂuid rate in blood are
both within the normal limits or not. However, the possible future
application of the current system for intelligent medical diagnostics
is only an expectation in this work. For further intelligent medical
diagnostics, the current data of the experiments for the analysis are
not enough, and lots of experiments are needed to do step by step,
such as minifying the logic detection system, optimizing the system,
making the system stable, creating more logic gates to meet different
biomedical applications, and etc. And each section is necessary. So

for its future application, more works including the data analysis
should be done (Katz and Privman, 2010).

4 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a biocomputing security
system based on BFCs. Due to the unique ‘RESET’ reagent of N2
applied in this work, the prepared biocomputing security system
can be reset and cycled for a large number of times with no
‘RESET’ reagent—based ‘waste’. This would be advantageous for
the potential practical applications of such keypad lock as well
as the development of biocomputing security devices. In order to
validate the universality of the system and also to harvest energy
directly from biofuels with enhanced power output, we replace
the glucose with orange juice as the biofuel to operate BFCs—
based biocomputing system, which also possesses the function of
keypad lock. In addition, by introducing BFCs into the biocomputing
security system, the adaptive behavior of the BFCs self—regulating
the power release would be an immense advantage of such security
keypad lock devices in potential self—powered implantable medical
systems.

And the principle of the inﬂuence of gas injection and electrolyte
agitation on BFC performance is based on dissolved oxygen and
liquid ﬂow, respectively. Thus, based on the relationship between the
dissolved oxygen concentration in blood with ischemic state/heart
attack (Martin, 1999), as well as the relationship between the blood
ﬂow rate in blood vessel with the cardiac output/mean blood pressure
(Guyton, 1981; Taylor et al., 2007), the current biocomputing
security system can be used as the potential implant device model
for assessing physiological conditions in living organisms and for
making autonomous decisions on the use of speciﬁc tools/drugs in
various implantable medical systems. Nearly all living organisms
need oxygen to carry on life processes and blood ﬂow to maintain
life. Thus, on the other hand, on the conceptual level, this work
might help us understand how living organisms manage to control
extremely complex and coupled biochemical reactions; that is, the
hope is to cast biochemical (metabolic) pathways in the language
of information theory. For example, the underlying landscapes
of some signal transduction and metabolic networks can have
global funneled landscapes as a result of sequence of cascade
of intricate ‘logic gate’ like motifs (Wang et al., 2006; 2008).
This guarantees the unique direction of the information ﬂow and
biological functions with robustness and stability. We performed
a global study and found that maximizing the dimensionless ratio
of gap versus SD of the power output spectrum (a funnel in
power outputs) gives the quantitative optimal design criterion. Our
construction here may provide a practical example and microscopic
structural basis for mimicking the real biomolecular and network
systems and bridge the gaps between the theoretical concepts
and experiments important for biomolecular systems and synthetic
biology.

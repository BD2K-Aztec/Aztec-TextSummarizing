ABSTRACT

Summary: Protein—protein interaction detection methods are
applied on a daily basis by molecular biologists worldwide. After
generating a set of potential interactions, biologists face the problem
of highlighting the ones that are novel and collecting evidence with
respect to literature and annotation. This task can be as tedious
as searching for every predicted interaction in several interaction
data repositories, or manually screening the scientific literature.
To facilitate the task of evidence mining and novelty assessment
of protein—protein interactions, we have developed a Cytoscape
plugin that automatically mines publication references, database
references, interaction detection method descriptions and pathway
annotation for a user-supplied network of interactions. The basis
for the annotation is ConsensusPathDB—a meta-database that
integrates numerous protein—protein, signaling, metabolic and gene
regulatory interaction repositories for currently three species: Homo
sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Mus musculus.
Availability: The ConsensusPathDB plugin for Cytoscape (version
2.7.0 or later) can be installed within Cytoscape on a major operating
system (Windows, Mac OS, Unix/Linux) with Sun Java 1.5 or later
installed through Cytoscape’s Plugin manager (category ‘Network
and Attribute l/O’). The plugin is freely available for download on
the ConsensusPathDB web site (http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de).
Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Due to the high explanatory power of protein—protein interactions for
biological processes in health and disease (Ideker and Sharan, 2008),
dedicated interaction detection methods like yeast—two—hybrid
(Y2H) screening (Fields, 2005) and co—puriﬁcation (Aebersold and
Mann, 2003) are applied on a daily basis by molecular biologists
worldwide and contribute to the completion of the map of protein—
protein interactions for human and other species. An immediate task
after generating a network of predicted interactions is to identify

the ones that have not been published previously and to collect
evidence for every single interaction from literature and annotation.
This information is useful in order to estimate the performance of
the interaction screen and to assess the contribution to the protein—
protein interaction map of the species in question. To accomplish
this task, biologists typically search their new data against every
single protein—protein interaction repository like IntAct (Huntley
et al., 2007) or MINT (Chatr—aryamontri et al., 2007). Even more
tedious is the manual mining for interactions in scientiﬁc literature
to collect the publication references and detection methods for the
novel interaction list.

Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) is a widely used, freely
available software tool for visualization, manipulation and analysis
of biomolecular interaction networks. To aid the process of
interaction evidence mining, we have developed a plugin for
Cytoscape that searches all interactions from the network of
interest in the interaction space stored in ConsensusPathDB.
ConsensusPathDB (Kamburov et al., 2009) is an interaction meta—
database that integrates functional interaction repositories forming
a heterogeneous interaction network which comprises protein—
protein interactions, as well as signaling, metabolic and gene
regulatory interactions. Currently, the database integrates 18 open—
access repositories on human interactions and eight repositories for
both yeast and mouse interactions and contains around 150 000
human, 195 000 yeast and 13 000 mouse distinct interactions (many
of which are of non—binary nature, i.e. contain more than two
interaction partners). In this article, we describe the functionality
of the ConsensusPathDB plugin for Cytoscape and demonstrate its
usage and performance.

2 DESCRIPTION

After installing the plugin, the user starts by loading the network of
interest (denoted query network) represented by binary interactions
in Cytoscape and launching the ConsensusPathDB plugin through
Cytoscape’s ‘Plugins’ menu (Fig. 1A). After setting a few parameters
which we describe below, the user starts the evidence mining
process. The plugin then communicates with the repository of
ConsensusPathDB through a web service. Once the plugin sends
the query network to the server, a search is executed on the server—
side for all (or, optionally, just the selected) proteins and interactions
from the query network in ConsensusPathDB through SQL queries.
Proteins from the query network are matched to the data repository

on the basis of accession numbers such as UniProt (The UniProt
Consortium, 2010) or Ensembl (Flicek et al., 2010). Interactions
from the query network are matched to the repository based on their
participants.

The performance of the interaction matching depends critically
on how well proteins in the query network are annotated with
accession numbers. In the case that accession numbers are not
available, the user is prompted to specify whether the node labels
represent accession numbers of a certain type. The interaction
matching performance is inﬂuenced by two parameters, ‘protein
annotation matching’ (strict/fuzzy) and ‘interaction cardinality
matching’ (strict/allow containment). Strict protein annotation
matching denotes that a protein from the query network and a protein
from the database are considered identical only if all identiﬁers
of a type match. Fuzzy matching means that the identiﬁers of the
query protein may form a sub—set of the identiﬁers of the database
counterpart or vice versa. Fuzzy matching is useful, e.g. when
proteins on the one side are compared with protein families on the
other side. The ‘interaction cardinality matching’ parameter speciﬁes
whether the binary interactions from the query network should be
matched only with binary interactions from the database network

(strict matching) or whether they may be matched to complex
interactions, i.e. interactions of more than two proteins that contain
the binary interactions. More details about protein and interaction
mapping can be found in the Supplementary Material to this paper.

After matching proteins and interactions, the web service server
sends annotation attributes for matched query interactions in the
form of publication references (Pubmed identiﬁers), interaction
detection methods, database references (such as IntAct and MINT)
and pathway annotations (i.e. pathways that contain both participants
of a protein—protein interaction) to the client plugin. The plugin
creates a custom visual style in Cytoscape where the thickness of
interaction edges reﬂects (optionally) the number of publications,
number of containing interaction databases, number of distinct
detection methods, or number of containing pathways for the protein
interaction (Fig. 1B). Interactions that are not found in the repository,
and thus represent potential novel interactions, are highlighted in
green. In the results tab of Cytoscape, an interaction mapping
summary is displayed together with a legend. The interaction
attributes that have been retrieved from ConsensusPathDB can be
viewed for selected interactions under the ‘Interaction details’ tab of
the results panel (Fig. 1C). If applicable, this information is provided
as web links to the primary data and can be viewed in a web browser.

Figure 1D shows the performance of the plugin implementation
with respect to the mining of interaction annotation for different
network sizes. Results show that even for large networks evidence
mining executes in minutes, for example ~2 min for a network
with 20000 nodes. It should be noted, however, that the Internet
connection speed of the client inﬂuences the overall speed of
interaction matching.

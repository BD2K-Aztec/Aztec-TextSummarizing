ABSTRACT

Summary: Mathematical modeling has a key role in systems biology.
Model building is often regarded as an iterative loop involving
several tasks, among which the estimation of unknown parameters
of the model from a certain set of experimental data is of central
importance. This problem of parameter estimation has many possible
pitfalls, and modelers should be very careful to avoid them. Many
of such difficulties arise from a fundamental (yet often overlooked)
property: the so-called structural (or a priori) identifiability, which
considers the uniqueness of the estimated parameters. Obviously,
the structural identifiability of any tentative model should be checked
at the beginning of the model building loop. However, checking this
property for arbitrary non-linear dynamic models is not an easy task.
Here we present a software toolbox, GenSSI (Generating Series for
testing Structural Identifiability), which enables non-expert users to
carry out such analysis. The toolbox runs under the popular MATLAB
environment and is accompanied by detailed documentation and
relevant examples.

1 INTRODUCTION

Mathematical modeling can be regarded as the central element in
computational systems biology. The process of developing a model
involves several tasks, among which the estimation of unknown
parameters of the model from a certain set of experimental data is
of key importance (Ashyraliyev et al., 2009; Banga and Balsa—Canto,
2008; Jaqaman and Danuser, 2006). This problem of parameter
estimation, also known as the inverse problem, has many possible
pitfalls, and modelers should be very careful to avoid them. Many
of such pitfalls arise from a fundamental (yet often overlooked)
property of this inverse problem: the so—called structural (or a priori)
identiﬁability (J aqaman and Danuser, 2006; Srinath and Gunawan,
2010; Walter and Pronzato, 1997).

Global identiﬁability considers the issue of uniquely estimating
all the free parameters of a model from data (Ljung and Glad,
1994). If a model is non—identiﬁable, then the estimated parameters
will lead, irrespective of the applied method, to artifacts in the
model calibration and errors in subsequent model predictions.
Thus, there is a fundamental need of reliable methods and tools

to detect non—identiﬁability as soon as a new model is proposed.
Structural (a priori) non—identiﬁability is usually caused by over—
parameterization of the model (including its observation function),
while practical (a posteriori) non—identiﬁability is generally due
to lack of information in the available data. Here, we will focus
in a priori global identiﬁability, which is a structural property
of the model, and must be considered a prerequisite for reliable
parameter estimation. It should be noted that structural identiﬁability
assumes an ideal context of error—free model structure and noise—free
measurements.

The vast majority of models in current systems biology are
non—linear and dynamic. Testing the identiﬁability of this class
of models (typically composed of sets of non—linear ordinary
differential equations) is an extremely challenging mathematical
problem. Currently, most of the software tools allow for practical
identiﬁability analysis (see, for example, the Proﬁle Likelihood
Approach, PLE Raue et al., 2009) or AMIGO (Balsa—Canto and
Banga, 2011). The analysis is performed for a given dataset and
parameter values. DAISY (Differential Algebra for Identiﬁability of
SYstems) (Bellu et al., 2007) allows for the structural identiﬁability
analysis; however, it is limited in the size and the functional form of
the non—linearities that can be handled (only polynomial or rational).

Here we present a new software, GenSSI (Generating Series
approach for testing Structural Identiﬁability), implemented as a free
toolbox for the MATLAB computing language. GenSSI can handle
any linear or non—linear dynamic model described by arbitrary
analytic functions. GenSSI is easy to use and does not require
user knowledge of higher mathematics, a programming language
or computer algebra system (other than basic familiarity with
MATLAB). The user only needs to specify the model equations,
input variables (controls), output variables (observables), initial
conditions and relevant parameters for model calibration. After a
series of automatic symbolic computations (see methods below),
the toolbox produces rich text and graphical output describing the
identiﬁability of such model. The toolbox is accompanied by a users
guide with several examples and detailed documentation describing
the methods and their implementation.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

GenSSI can handle systems represented by a set of linear/non—linear
differential equations of the form given below:

i0)=f(x(t),p)+g(x(t),p)u(t),x(to)=xo(p),
y(t,p)=h(x(t),p),

where xeR” is the n—dimensional state variable, ueRm a m—dimensional
control, yeR’ is the r—dimensional output which may be in principle any
function of the state variables and x0(p) are the initial conditions that may

depend on the parameters. The model response will depend on a number of
unknown parameters, denoted by p e P (Pg Rq ).

GenSSI is based on the generating series approach coupled with the use
of identiﬁability tableaas (Balsa—Canto et al., 2010). The underlying idea
is to generate a non—linear system of equations on the parameters from the
computation of the successive Lie derivatives of f and g. If the solution of the
system of equations is unique then the parameters are globally identiﬁable.
Note that at least a number of r(1+ m)1\IrDeriVatiVeS should be computed. But it
is possible that extra derivatives are needed if the kernel (initial conditions) is
not informative, thus zero or dependent Lie derivatives are generated. Once
the Lie derivatives are computed, the identiﬁability tableaas (see Fig. 1 for an
illustrative example) help not only to devise global identiﬁable parameters,
but also to decide on the appropriate way to handle the non—linear system of
equations on the remaining parameters.

GenSSI will automatically perform all symbolic computations and
will ﬁnally present, after reasonable computation times, text and ﬁgures
describing the structural identiﬁability of the set of parameters. GenSSI will
produce one of the following diagnosis: structurally globally identiﬁable
(SGI), structurally locally identiﬁable (SLI) and structurally non—identiﬁable
(SNI) up to the current derivative. SGI is guaranteed if a unique solution
of the parameters p can be obtained from the set of algebraic equations
generated using input—output data. If SGI cannot be proved, GenSSI will try
to establish if there is a ﬁnite number of indistinguishable parameter values,
in which case the model will be SLI. Otherwise the model will be SNI. The
model 2(1)) will be SNI if at least one of its parameters is SNI.

3 EXAMPLES

In order to illustrate the use and capabilities of GenSSI, the software
distribution includes a detailed users guide and several relevant examples:

0 the Goodwin oscillator: a model of oscillatory behavior in enzymatic
control, with three dynamic state variables, six parameters and three
observables.

0 (an Arabidopsis thaliana circadian network model), with seven
dynamic state variables, 27 parameters, one control variable and
two observables.

0 a glycolysis—inspired metabolic pathway, with ﬁve dynamic state
variables, ﬁve parameters, four controls and ﬁve observables.

In the toolbox documentation, we discuss in detail the results of GenSSI
for these examples, which are obtained with a very reasonable computational
effort. Further, we also illustrate how, in cases of structural non—identiﬁability,
subsets of parameters can be chosen in order to make the system identiﬁable.

4 CONCLUSION

Here we present a software toolbox, GenSSI, which can be used to
test the structural identiﬁability of arbitrary non—linear dynamical
models of biological systems (i.e. described by sets of non—linear
ordinary differential equations). In case of detection of non—
identiﬁability for a given model, this toolbox can also be used to
determine which subsets parameters can be identiﬁed (or at least
locally identiﬁed), therefore guiding in the reformulation of the
model when needed. GenSSI is cross—platform (using the MATLAB
computing environment, available in most operating systems) and
is easy to use, not requiring high—level programming or advanced
mathematical skills from users.

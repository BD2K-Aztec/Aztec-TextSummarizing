ABSTRACT

Motivation: The accurate prediction of disease status is a central
challenge in clinical cancer research. Microarray-based gene bio-
markers have been identified to predict outcome and outperform
traditional clinical parameters. However, the robustness of the individ-
ual gene biomarkers is questioned because of their little reproducibility
between different cohorts of patients. Substantial progress in treat-
ment requires advances in methods to identify robust biomarkers.
Several methods incorporating pathway information have been pro-
posed to identify robust pathway markers and build classifiers at the
level of functional categories rather than of individual genes. However,
current methods consider the pathways as simple gene sets but
ignore the pathway topological information, which is essential to
infer a more robust pathway activity.

Results: Here, we propose a directed random walk (DRW)-based
method to infer the pathway activity. DRW evaluates the topological
importance of each gene by capturing the structure information
embedded in the directed pathway network. The strategy of weighting
genes by their topological importance greatly improved the reprodu-
cibility of pathway activities. Experiments on 18 cancer datasets
showed that the proposed method yielded a more accurate and
robust overall performance compared with several existing gene-
based and pathway-based classification methods. The resulting risk-
active pathways are more reliable in guiding therapeutic selection and
the development of pathway-specific therapeutic strategies.

1 INTRODUCTION

One important challenge in clinical cancer research is the accur-
ate prediction of disease states and responses to treatment, which

guide the choice of optimal therapy for the patients. Microarray-
based gene biomarkers have been identiﬁed to predict outcome
and outperformed traditional clinical parameters (Perez-Diez
et al., 2007; van ‘t Veer et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2005).
However, the reproducibility of the individual gene biomarkers
has been challenged (Dupuy and Simon, 2007; Ein-Dor et al.,
2006). The prediction performance of the gene signatures dis-
covered in one dataset often decreased drastically in an inde-
pendent dataset for the same disease phenotype. The main
cause of this discrepancy may include the cellular heterogeneity
within tissues, the inherent genetic heterogeneity across patients
and the measurement error in microarray platforms. Moreover,
the small number of samples that are available to build a classi-
ﬁer makes the problem more difﬁcult (Ein—Dor et al., 2006).
To address this problem, several methods have been proposed
to ﬁnd more robust biomarkers at the level of functional cate-
gories rather than of individual genes (Guo et al., 2005; Kim
et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2008; Su et al., 2009). Because the gene
products are well known to function coordinately by way of a
functional module or signaling cascade, the high-level perturbed
functional modules may be more consistent than individual
genes. Thus, integrating the expressions of function-related
genes and extracting classiﬁcation features at the functional
level may produce more reproducible biomarkers. The bio-
markers at the functional level could alleviate the impact of het-
erogeneity across the tissues or samples and provide a better
biological interpretation of the relationships between the disease
and canonical pathways such as the Gene Ontology (Ashburner
et al., 2000) and KEGG databases (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000). A
number of feature extraction methods have been used to inte-
grate the expression value of the member genes in canonical
pathways. Guo et al. used the mean and median of the expres-
sion values of member genes to infer the pathway activity (Guo
et al., 2005). Bild et al. used the ﬁrst principal component of the
expression values of the member genes to infer the pathway ac-
tivity (Bild et al., 2006). In contrast, Lee et al. inferred the path-
way activity by using only a subset of genes [condition-
responsive genes (CORGs)], whose combined expression delivers
optimal discriminative power for the disease phenotype (Lee
et al., 2008). Other approaches estimated the pathway activity
based on probabilistic inference (Efroni et al., 2007; Su et al.,
2009). The existing methods successfully incorporated the

pathway information into the disease classiﬁcation procedure
and achieved better classiﬁcation performance.

However, all these methods used the pathways as simple gene
sets and treated all genes in the pathway equally but ignored the
structure information embedded in the pathway network. It has
been reported that the ‘hub’ genes with high connectivity are
usually critical to the functionality of the whole pathway
(Carter et al., 2004). The perturbation on a ‘hub’ gene may
impact the pathway more greatly than that on a gene with
little topological importance. However, the ‘hub’ genes tend to
have low levels of change in gene expression (Lu et al., 2007).
Their subtle but consistent changes could be easily overshadowed
by differential non-hub genes, whose changes may be unstable
across the samples. Thus, up-weighting the hub genes and down-
weighting the non-hub genes according to their topological im-
portance may contribute to a more robust pathway activity. A
few methods have been proposed to mine the topological infor-
mation of the network. Gao et al. designed a pathway score
based on all connected gene pairs for the pathway enrichment
analysis (Gao and Wang, 2007). Hung et al. improved the path-
way enrichment analysis by weighting each gene based on the
closest correlated neighbor genes (Hung et al., 2010). Recently,
undirected random walk was used to mine the topological infor-
mation of the protein—protein interaction network and showed
superiority in prioritizing candidate disease genes or pathways
(Can et al., 2005; Kohler et al., 2008; Li and Patra, 2010).
However, these topological information mining methods con-
sider the edges in the network as undirected; thus, they may
lose some important information when used in the directed path-
way networks, such as the position of the genes and the type of
interactions, which are essential to measure the topological im-
portance of the genes. For example, the genes located in the
upstream are more important because they inﬂuence other
genes downstream, such as the insulin receptor in the insulin
signaling pathway, whose inactivation may shut off the entire
pathway. To capture the topological properties in directed net-
work and infer a more robust pathway activity, a ﬂexible path-
way topological information mining method is required.

In this work, we propose a directed random walk (DRW)-
based method (Fig. l) to mine the topological information and
infer the pathway activity. DRW is performed on a merged
global pathway network and attempts to evaluate the topological
importance of each gene according to all the aforementioned
topological properties. The strategy of weighting genes by their
topological importance effectively enhances the reproducibility
of the pathway activities. We apply the DRW method to the
classiﬁcation of six types of cancers and show that it can produce
higher accuracy and stronger robustness compared with several
existing pathway-based approaches, both within single datasets
and in different independent datasets. The resulting risk-active
pathways are more reliable in predicting clinical outcome and
guiding therapeutic selection.

Fig. 1. Overview of the DRW-based pathway activity inference method.
The gene proﬁles are translated into pathway proﬁles based on the DRW
method. Row 1' of the gene proﬁles [z(g,-)] is the expression value vector of
gene g,- across all samples. Row j of the pathway proﬁles [a(PJ-)] is the
expression value vector (i.e. pathway activity) of pathway PJ- across all
samples. The diagram on the right is the detailed illustration of DRW-
based pathway activity inference. The global pathway network is con-
structed on 150 metabolic and 150 non-metabolic pathways. A virtual
ground node is added to balance the weights of the genes in the network.
W0 is the initial weights of the genes. WC,O is the output weight vector. The
inference of the pathway activity of pathway P,- is presented as an ex-
ample. The edge direction in the original pathway network PJ- is reversed
when we merge the pathway PJ- into the global pathway network. The
pathway activity a(PJ-) of P,- is the integrated expression value vector of the
signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes in the pathway weighting
by WC,O

on eight datasets. They are GSE10072 for lung cancer (Landi et al., 2008),
GSE13911 for stomach cancer (D’Errico et al., 2009), GSE17856 for liver
cancer (Tsuchiya et al., 2010), GSE5364 for thyroid cancer (Yu et al.,
2008), GSE15641 and GSE17895 for kidney cancer (Dalgliesh et al.,
2010; Jones et al., 2005) and GSE3494 and GSE1456 for breast cancer
(Miller et al., 2005; Pawitan et al., 2005). For breast cancer, patients who
died because of breast cancer within 5 years were deﬁned as the ‘poor’
prognostic group, and the remaining patients were deﬁned as the ‘good’
prognostic group (patients with a survival time <5 years without any
reported event were excluded). Each dataset contains gene expression
proﬁles for 322 tumor/poor samples and 216 normal/good samples.
To evaluate classiﬁcation performance on independent dataset, we col-
lected 10 additional datasets for validation (Supplementary Table S1).
The pathway information was obtained from the KEGG database
(Kanehisa and Goto, 2000). This collection contains 150 metabolic and
150 non-metabolic pathways. The interactions in KEGG were manually
drawn by summarizing experimental evidence in published literature.

2.2 Constructing the global-directed pathway graph

We ﬁrst converted each KEGG pathway into a directed graph using the
SubpathwayMiner software package (Li et al., 2009, 2013). Then the 300
graphs were merged into a global-directed pathway graph, which covers
4113 nodes and 40 875 directed edges. Each node in the graph represents
a gene, and each directed edge represents how genes interact and regulate
each other. The direction of the edge is derived from the type of inter-
action between two genes, which is available from the KEGG. For
example, if gene A activates (inhibits) gene B, then A points to B. The
random walk (Lovasz, 1996) on the pathway graph is similar to the

Topologically inferring risk pathways

 

PageRank algorithm used by the Google search engine (Brin and Page,
1998), but the direction of the random walk is opposite (a web page is
important if other pages point to it, whereas a gene is important if
it inﬂuences other genes (Draghici et al., 2007). Thus, we reversed the
direction of all edges on the global pathway graph (Fig. 1).

To perform random walk, two problems need to be solved. First, there
are 938 dangling nodes (0 out-degree, such as the most upstream nodes in
the pathway) on the directed pathway graph. The dangling nodes will
absorb the weight of other nodes but never distribute their weight back to
the graph. Besides, there are 396 nodes with 0 in-degree; they do not
receive any weights from other nodes. This may be unsatisfactory from
a biological perspective. To alleviate this problem, we introduced a virtual
ground node connected to every node through bidirectional edges
(Fig. 1). Thus, the graph became strongly connected and consisted of
4113+1 nodes and 40 875+2 X 4113 edges. We denoted the extended
graph as G = (V, E), where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges.

2.3 DRW on the global-directed pathway graph

The DRW with restart stimulates a random walker that starts on a source
node s (or a set of source nodes simultaneously). At every time step, the
walker transitions from its current node to a randomly selected neighbor
(based on edge weights) or goes back to source node s with probability r.
Formally, the DRW with restart is deﬁned as

Wr+1 = (1 — r)MTWl + We (1)

where W, is a vector in which the i—th element holds the probability of
being at node i at time step t, and M is the row-normalized adjacency
matrix of the graph G.

To start the random walk, the initial probability vector W0 was con-
structed by assigning to each node (except for the ground node, whose
initial probability was 0) its absolute t—test score, and normalized to a unit
vector. The restart probability r was set as 0.7. W, converges to a unique
steady state in the presence of the ground node (Lu et al., 2011). This was
obtained by performing the iteration until the Ll-norm between W, and
W,+1 <10'10. At the steady state, we evenly distributed the probability of
the ground node back to all other nodes and obtained the ﬁnal probabil-
ity vector WOO. WC,O provided a measure of the topological importance of
the genes in the global pathway graph and was used as the weight vector
of genes at the step of pathway activity inference. Because we used the
t—test scores as the initial probabilities, the magnitude of the t—test scores
also contributed to weight adjustments. Thus, genes which are both topo-
logically important and signiﬁcantly differentially expressed will obtain
higher weights.

2.4 Pathway activity inference

For each pathway, we calculated the t-test statistics of all member genes.
Only those genes that are signiﬁcantly differentially expressed (P< 0.05,
see Supplementary Table S2 for the corresponding fdr, Benjamin correc-
tion) are selected in constructing the pathway activity. Consider a path-
way P,- that contains nj differential genes {g1, g2, . . . , gnj} after those genes
that were not signiﬁcantly differentially expressed in the training set have
been removed. The pathway activity aT(PJ-) of the pathway P,- in the
training dataset is calculated as follows:

MP» = 2:, Wags-enemies,»-zT(gi) / 2:, (Wags? (2)

where Woo(g,-) is the weight of gene g,, tscore(g,-) is the t statistics of gene g,-
from a two-tailed t-test on expression values between two phenotypes,
zT(g,-) is the normalized expression value vector of g,- across the samples in
the training dataset and sgnO is the sign function that returns —1 for
negative numbers and +1 for positive numbers. The pathway activity
aV(PJ-) of the pathway P,- in the test dataset is given by

axe) = 2:, Woo(g.-)-sgn<twe(gi)) - zV(g.-)/ 2:, (Wags?

where zV(g,-) is the normalized expression value vector of g,- across the
samples in the test dataset.

2.5 Reproducibility power

Yang et al. proposed that a pathway activity is reproducible if it provides
similar discriminative power on the training-test pair datasets (Yang
et al., 2012). The reproducibility power is given by

1 N i i
Cscore(N) = NZizl l‘score(PT) ' l‘score(PV) 

where tsc0,e(P) is the t statistics of P from a two-tailed t-test on pathway
activities between two phenotypes, PiT is the i—th pathway activity in
descending order (ranked by absolute t-scores) in the training dataset,
PI, is its corresponding pathway activity in the test dataset and N is the
number of selected pathways. The reproducibility power reﬂects the dis-
criminative power and the robustness of the pathway activity.

For within-dataset experiments, the samples in a dataset were ran-
domly divided into ﬁve subsets of equal size. Four of these subsets
were used as the training dataset, whereas the remaining subset was
used as the test set. Each subset was used in turn as the test set to evaluate
the reproducibility. For unbiased evaluation, we repeated these experi-
ments for 100 random partitions for the entire dataset. The averaged
Cscore over 500 experiments was reported as the overall reproducibility
performance. For cross-dataset experiments, the whole ﬁrst dataset was
used as the training dataset, and the second independent dataset was used
as the test set.

2.6 Classiﬁcation evaluation

For within-dataset experiments, we randomly divided the dataset so that
four-ﬁfths of the samples were used as the training set, and the remaining
one-ﬁfth was used as the test set (5-fold cross-validation). To select the
best pathway marker set for classiﬁcation, we further split the training set
into three equal-sized subsets. Two subsets were used as the marker evalu-
ation dataset to build the classiﬁer and rank the pathway markers, and
one subset was used as the feature selection dataset for assessing which
pathway marker set produced the best classiﬁcation performance. To
build the classiﬁer, we calculated the t-test statistics of the pathway activ-
ities on the marker evaluation dataset and ranked the pathways by their
P—values in increasing order. The top 50 pathways were used as the can-
didate features to build the logistic regression model (or classiﬁers based
on other classiﬁcation algorithms). We ﬁrst constructed the classiﬁer with
the pathway ranked ﬁrst. Then the pathways were added sequentially to
train the logistic regression model, and the performance of the classiﬁer
was measured by evaluating its area under the receiver operating char-
acteristics curve (AUC) on the feature selection dataset. The added path-
way marker was kept in the feature set if the AUC increased and was
removed otherwise. We repeated the above process for the top 50 path-
way markers to optimize the classiﬁer and obtained the best feature set.
The performance of the optimized classiﬁer was evaluated on the test set
by using the pathway markers in the best feature set. Each subset of the
training set was used in turn as feature selection dataset to optimize the
classiﬁer. Therefore, each training set generated three optimized classiﬁers
and generated three AUCs on the corresponding test set. Each of the ﬁve
subsets in the whole dataset was evaluated in turn as the test set. Thus,
one partition generated 15 AUCs. For unbiased evaluation and to esti-
mate the variation of the AUC, we repeated the above process 100 times.
The mean AUC across 1500 classiﬁers was reported as the overall per-
formance of the classiﬁcation method.

For cross-dataset experiments, the whole ﬁrst dataset was used as the
training set, and the second independent dataset was used as the test set.
The ﬁrst dataset was divided into ﬁve subsets of equal size. Four subsets

W.Liu et al.

 

were used as the marker evaluation dataset to train the classiﬁer, and one
subset was used as the feature selection dataset to optimize the con-
structed classiﬁer and select the best feature set. We repeated this experi-
ment by using each subset as the feature selection dataset in turn and
evaluated the optimized classiﬁer on the test set. One hundred random
partitions of the training set were generated for building the classiﬁer and
feature selection. The averaged AUC on the test set over 500 classiﬁers
was reported as the ﬁnal performance measure.

2.7 Other classiﬁcation methods

For comparison with other pathway activity inference methods, we im-
plemented four pathway-based classiﬁcation methods, namely, the Mean
and Median methods (Guo et al., 2005), the Principle Component
Analysis (PCA) method (Bild et al., 2006) and the Pathway Activity
inference using Condition-responsive genes (PAC) method (Lee et al.,
2008). The Mean and Median methods use the mean and median of
the expression values of the member genes to infer the pathway activity.
The PCA method uses the ﬁrst principal component of the expressions of
the member genes to represent the pathway activity. The PAC method
performs a greedy search to identify CORGs and infers the pathway
activity by using only the CORGs. We also compared the performance
of a traditional gene-based classiﬁer that uses individual genes as features
(the Genes method). Additionally, we compared our method with an-
other excellent gene-based method Reweighted Recursive Feature
Elimination (RRFE) (Johannes et al., 2010) implemented in pathClass
(Johannes et al., 2011). RRFE also incorporates topological information
to improve AUC as well as the reproducibility and interpretability of
selected gene features.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Inferring pathway activity by DRW

Figure 1 illustrates the overview of the DRW-based pathway
activity inference method. DRW mines the topological informa-
tion embedded in the global pathway network and weights the
genes according to their topological importance. With these
weights, we integrate the expression values of the differential
member genes to topologically infer the activity for each path-
way. The genes that are topologically important receive more
weights and contribute more to pathway activity. Finally, the
DRW method translates the gene proﬁles into pathway proﬁles.
We applied the DRW method on the lung cancer dataset and
inferred 245 pathway activities of lung cancer. The top 50 active
pathways (ranked by absolute t-scores) are able to classify sam-
ples with no misclassiﬁcations by using two-way hierarchical

Fig. 2. Active levels of the pathway activities. (A) The top 50 active
pathways of the lung cancer samples are clustered by complete linkage
hierarchical clustering. (B) Heat map depicts the active levels of 200
common active pathways for each cancer

clustering (Fig. 2A). The top 50 active pathways of seven other
datasets also show good discriminative ability (Supplementary
Figs Sl—S7). The heat map in Figure 2B depicts the —log
(P-value) of 200 common active pathways from a two-tailed
t-test on pathway activities between the two phenotypes in
eight cancer datasets. It provides a snapshot of the active levels
of the pathways for each cancer. A few cancer-related pathways
show high active levels in all datasets, such as apoptosis, p53
signaling pathway and acute myeloid leukemia. Compared
with kidney cancer, the pathway activities of breast cancer are
less discriminative and consistent between two breast cancer
datasets, conﬁrming the molecular heterogeneity of breast
cancer.

3.2 Pathway activities show high reproducibility

A major challenge in pathway activity inference is to ﬁnd active
pathways that have stronger discriminative power and robust-
ness. We used the reproducibility power [Equation (3), see
‘Materials and Methods’ section] to evaluate the pathway activ-
ities. Greater reproducibility power indicates more discriminative
power and stronger robustness of the pathway activity. We com-
puted the reproducibility power of the active pathways and
ranked the pathways according to their reproducibility power.
The mean reproducibility power of the top pathways of ﬁve
pathway activity inference methods, namely, the Mean and
Median methods, the PCA method, the PAC method and the
DRW method, was compared (Supplementary Fig. S8). Besides,
we also evaluated the reproducibility power of the top single gene
markers, which were chosen from the 4113 genes covered by the
300 pathways used in this study. The DRW-based pathway activ-
ities exhibited the greatest power to discriminate between tumor
and normal samples for all eight datasets. They showed
~l.5-fold increased reproducibility over the PAC-based pathway
activities, ~2—fold over individual gene markers and ~10-fold
improvement over pathway activities inferred by other methods,
such as the Mean, Median and PCA methods.

Another important measurement of the robustness of pathway
activities is their reproducibility between independent datasets.
We further analyzed the kidney and breast cancer datasets be-
cause two separate cohorts of patients were available for each
cancer. The DRW method again obtained the largest reproduci-
bility on average (Supplementary Fig. S9), further indicating the
robustness of the DRW-based pathway activities. The Genes
method performed worst in the ‘Kidney-Germany->USA’ case
(Supplementary Fig. S9A). This is because the most discrimina-
tive markers in the Kidney-Germany dataset were not highly
discriminative in the Kidney-USA dataset, indicating that the
gene markers were not robust. The PAC method showed a simi-
lar phenomenon in that the pathway markers extracted from the
‘Kidney-Germany’ dataset were not highly discriminative in
the ‘Kidney-USA’ dataset.

3.3 Risk-active pathways improve cancer classiﬁcation

To test the usefulness of pathway activities in discriminating be-
tween different disease phenotypes, we performed classiﬁcation
on eight cancer datasets. For a fair and effective comparison with
other methods, we carried out within-dataset experiments similar
to those used in Lee et al. (2008) to evaluate the classiﬁcation

performance (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section). To reduce
the effect of sensitivity in feature selection when comparing dif-
ferent pathway-based methods, we also used the top 50 pathway
activities ranked by their P—values in increasing order as the can-
didate features for feature selection. The classiﬁer was built by
using the selected pathway activities based on logistic regression.
The Mean, Median, PAC and PCA methods followed the same
procedure. The results of pathClass (RRFE) were obtained by a
lO-times repeated 5-fold cross-validation by using R-package
pathClass. For the Genes method, the top 50 discriminative
gene markers were chosen as the candidate features to keep the
maximum number of features identical across all classiﬁcation
methods (Su et al., 2009).

Figure 3 presents a summary of the AUC of the cross-valid-
ation experiments (Supplementary Fig. SlOA shows the classiﬁ-
cation accuracy). The proposed DRW method obtained AUCs
(accuracies) of 0.9996 (95.58%), 0.9820 (94.34%), 0.9602
(93.06%), 0.9029 (87.33%), 0.9961 (97.55%), 0.9496 (94.87%),
0.6776 (73.36%) and 0.6926 (82.21%) for eight cancer datasets,
respectively, indicating that the DRW-based pathway markers
were quite competent in discriminating between different disease
phenotypes. The AUCs (accuracies) of the DRW method on the
eight datasets were signiﬁcantly greater than those of the PAC,
Mean, Median, PCA and Genes methods at the 5% signiﬁcance
level [Wilcoxon signed-rank test: P=0.039l (0.0234), 0.0078
(0.0078), 0.0078 (0.0078), 0.0078 (0.0078) and 0.0391 (0.0391),
respectively]. This indicates that the DRW method outperforms
other methods not only in AUC but also in accuracy. The
pathClass method also yielded favorable performance, but was
slightly inferior to the DRW method. Of these eight datasets, the
AUC of the DRW method was larger compared with pathClass
in ﬁve datasets. Although the Genes method reached the highest
AUC for kidney cancer, it did not perform well in ﬁve datasets,
especially the thyroid and breast cancer datasets, suggesting that
the individual gene markers are less stable than pathway
markers.

To evaluate the generalization ability of the classiﬁer, we car-
ried out cross-dataset experiments on the kidney and breast
cancer datasets. One dataset was used as the training set and

subset was removed in turn, and the remaining four subsets were
used as the training set to build the classiﬁer. Each classiﬁer was
then used to predict the class of samples in the independent test
set. The aforementioned process was repeated 10 times to obtain
the average AUC and the standard deviation. Figure 4 shows the
results of the cross-dataset experiments (Supplementary Fig.
S10B shows the classiﬁcation accuracy). The DRW method
again outperformed other pathway inference methods, especially
in the two kidney cancer datasets, which were detected on dif-
ferent microarray platforms. The AUC of the proposed method
improved by 36.28, 20.14, 17.65, 35.67 and 37.30% in the
‘Kidney-Germany—>USA’ case and 5.13, 32.76, 27.72, 62.28
and 7.81% in the ‘Kidney—USA->Germany’ case compared
with the PAC, Mean, Median, PCA and Genes method. The
pathClass also obtained good performance in the two kidney
cancer datasets. A potential reason may be that both the
DRW method and pathClass incorporate topological informa-
tion to build the classiﬁer. However, pathClass was inferior to
the DRW method on average. The AUC of the DRW method
was larger compared with pathClass in three of four paired train-
ing-test datasets. Compared with within-dataset experiments, al-
though the PAC, Mean, Median and Genes methods showed
good performances on the two kidney cancer datasets, respect-
ively (Fig. 3), their performances decreased drastically in the in-
dependent datasets. This is not surprising if we consider the
reproducibility power presented in Supplementary Figure S9A.
The DRW method showed consistent performance and strong
generalization ability, indicating that the DRW-based pathway
activities are less sensitive to different cohorts of patients and
microarray platforms and are more reliable in predicting clinical
outcome in practice.

To further demonstrate the superior performance of DRW on
independent dataset, we collected 10 additional datasets and per-
formed cross-a’ataset experiments. Of the 10 experiments, the
AUCs of DRW ranked ﬁrst in six experiments (Table 1). They
were signiﬁcantly greater than those of the PAC, Mean, Median,
Genes and DRW-NR methods at the 5% signiﬁcance level
(VVilcoxon signed- rank test: P=0.0137, 0.0020, 0.0020, 0.0195,
0.0020, respectively). pathClass also obtained good performance,
but it was inferior to DRW in seven experiments. In all, our
DRW method outperformed all other methods on average.

In addition, to show that the superior performance of our
DRW method was not dependent on the chosen classiﬁcation

in non—small cell lung cancer (Kuner et al., 2009). Moreover, the
disruption of tight junction has also been shown to be associated
with lung cancer cell apoptosis (Zhang et al., 2011) and to play
an important role in cancer metastasis (Martin and J iang, 2009).
The detailed evidence from previous reports concerning these
risk pathways in the classiﬁcation of each disease is provided
in Supplementary Table S5. These risk-active pathways could
be useful in cancer diagnosis and could provide novel hypotheses
in cancer therapy.

4 DISCUSSION

Identifying reproducible disease biomarkers is important for clin-
ical utility in diagnostic and prognostic applications. Pathway
markers have been proven to be more reproducible than individ-
ual gene markers and provide better biological interpretation at
the functional level (Guo et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2012; Lee et al.,
2008; Su et al., 2009). Pathway markers are becoming a useful
tool for discriminating the disease status toward clinical predic-
tion and treatment. In this context, we proposed a novel DRW
method for inference of reproducible pathway activities and
robust disease classiﬁcation. We showed that DRW-based path-
way activities are more discriminative and consistent than indi-
vidual gene markers and pathway activities inferred by other
methods. Based on their superior reproducibility, we used the
DRW-based pathway activities to build the classiﬁer and tested
the classiﬁcation performance on eight datasets. The re-
sults showed that the AUCs and classiﬁcation accuracies of the
DRW method were signiﬁcantly higher than those of the Genes
method and other pathway-based methods, both within single
datasets and in different independent datasets.

The reliable performance of the DRW-based pathway activ-
ities could be attributed to the strategy of weighting genes ac-
cording to their topological importance. By weighting the genes,
the DRW method could amplify the signals of the key genes,
whose variations in their expression levels may greatly impact the
pathway but weaken the differential signals of the genes, which
only appear somewhere downstream or does not affect the given
pathway as much. Thus, the effectiveness of the topologically

way. A node is considered as disrupted if one of its member genes was
altered (at the 5% signiﬁcance level). The nodes marked with a star are
disrupted in both datasets, whereas the nodes marked with a triangle
symbol are disrupted in only one dataset

important genes associated with the phenotype of interest is
up-weighted, whereas other genes that have little topological im-
portance are weakened even if they are signiﬁcantly differentially
expressed. Therefore, the DRW method may alleviate the noise
due to the heterogeneity of samples or the technical measure-
ments, leading to more reproducible pathway activities. We
take the calcium signaling pathway, which is the most frequently
selected in the Kidney-Germany dataset, as an example for ana-
lysis. Figure 5 provides a snapshot of the perturbed nodes in the
calcium signaling pathway (Supplementary Figs S14 and S15
show the perturbed nodes in each dataset, respectively). The
topologically important genes located at the center of the path-
way, such as those residing in CALM, PLCy, PLCB and PLC5,
are up-weighted (Supplementary Table S6 and S7 provides the
full gene list). For example, the weights of CALM member genes
(CALMI, CALM2, CALM3, CALML3 and CALML5) exceed
those of genes residing in GPCR (AGTRI, C YSLT R2, T ACR3
and LHCGR), although the P—values of the latter genes are much
smaller (P<8.96E-l3). In contrast, the member genes of nodes

that have less topological importance (e. g. GPCR, PTK, FAK2,
IP3 3K) are down-weighted. Interestingly, most inconsistent
genes (shown in bold italics in Supplementary Table S6) are
down-weighted. For example, AGTRI, PT K23 and I T PKA are
differentially expressed only in the Kidney-Germany dataset,
whereas ADORA2A and GNAI5 are differentially expressed
only in the Kidney-USA dataset. The aforementioned phenom-
enon is in line with Lu et al.’s study (Lu et al., 2007); i.e. the hub
genes (such as those residing in CALM) tend to exhibit low but
consistent changes in gene expression. The highly differentially
expressed genes may contribute greatly to the Genes method.
For example, the most differential gene AGTRI (P=4.70E-33)
may be selected as a gene marker based on the Kidney-Germany
dataset. However, it has little discriminative power (P: 7.58E-
02) in the Kidney-USA dataset. Obviously, it will reduce the
averaged reproducibility of the gene markers (Supplementary
Fig. S9A) and thus the classiﬁcation performance (Fig. 4) be-
tween independent datasets. The inconsistent genes may also
impact the pathway-based methods, which treat all genes in
the pathway equally. Considering the instability of these genes
between independent cohorts of patients, it is not hard to specu-
late about the deteriorated performance of most methods in
cross-dataset experiments. The DRW method, however, could
alleviate the impact of inconsistent genes by reducing their
weights; thus, it is more stable than other methods. This further
indicates the importance of incorporating pathway topological
information in building a robust cancer classiﬁer.

DRW captures the topological properties of genes, including
the position of the genes in the pathway, how many genes inter-
act with the given gene and the type of interactions between
them. Because we use the absolute t-test score as the initial prob-
ability in DRW, a gene connected to other differentially ex-
pressed genes may receive more weight. Thus, the differential
hub genes exhibit an increased effect on the classiﬁer. We re-
ran the DRW method by deleting the top ‘hub’ genes to evaluate
this inﬂuence. The genes were sorted in decreasing order accord-
ing to out-degree (Supplementary Table S8). The top 2, 4, 6 and
8% of genes were deleted in turn. The results demonstrated that
the AUC obtained by deleting ‘hub’ genes decreased to a greater
extent compared with deleting randomly selected genes of the
same number (Supplementary Fig. S16), conﬁrming the import-
ance of ‘hub’ genes. We further investigated the functional roles
of the ‘hub’ genes (Supplementary Table S9). Transcription fac-
tors and membrane receptors comprised a high proportion
(24.3 +102: 34.5%) of genes with out-degree (51 ~ 100). This
indicates that the inﬂuences of differential transcription factors
and membrane receptors are enhanced by DRW if they connect
to other differential genes and potentially serve as a driver of
pathway activity to a certain extent.

To test the inﬂuence of the directionality on the classiﬁer, we
evaluated the classiﬁcation performance of a modiﬁed DRW al-
gorithm (DRW-NR) that does not reverse the direction of the
edges in the KEGG pathways. DRW-NR is inferior to DRW in
almost all datasets (Table 1). Also, the average standard devi-
ations of AUCs of DRW-NR are ~65.8% larger than that of
DRW, indicating that DRW is more robust in predicting disease
states.

There is one parameter in the DRW algorithm: the restart
probability r [Equation (1)]. To investigate the performance of

the DRW method for varying restart probabilities, we set r at
0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 and performed cross-dataset experiments
based on logistic regression. The AUC and classiﬁcation accur-
acy did not change much with the change in the value of restart
probability r (Supplementary Fig. S17), which was in line with
the results of Can et al. (2005) and Li and Patra(2010).

The performance of the DRW method depends on the cover-
age and quality of the human pathway information. A more
complete pathway topology could help to clarify the roles that
the genes played in the pathway and weight the genes more pre-
cisely. With the rapid development of human interaction data-
bases, we believe that having more complete biological pathway
information will enable a more accurate prediction of disease
status and provide a better guide for patient treatment.

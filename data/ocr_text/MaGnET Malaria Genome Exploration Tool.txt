ABSTRACT

Summary: The Malaria Genome Exploration Tool (MaGnET) is a soft-
ware tool enabling intuitive ‘exploration-style’ visualization of func-
tional genomics data relating to the malaria parasite, Plasmodium
falciparum. MaGnET provides innovative integrated graphic displays
for different datasets, including genomic location of genes, mRNA
expression data, protein—protein interactions and more. Any selection
of genes to explore made by the user is easily carried over between
the different viewers for different datasets, and can be changed inter-
actively at any point (without returning to a search).

Availability and Implementation: Free online use (Java Web Start) or
download (Java application archive and MySQL database; requires
local MySQL installation) at http://malariagenomeexplorer.org

Genome sequencing projects targeting malarial parasite species
have revealed how little is still known. At least 40% of the ~5770
genes in Plasmodiumfalciparum, the most deadly human parasite,
remain annotated as “unknown function’ according to PlasmoDB
(Aurrecoechea et al., 2009). Alongside, large-scale experiments
with functional genomic technologies support attempts to shed
light on the processes in which all these genes are involved. The
use of computational tools helps biologists and bioinformaticians
find clues in the emerging data, towards the functions of unchar-
acterized gene products they pursue experimentally. Tools that
enable exploration/browsing—style analysis are particularly appre-
ciated in the biologist community. With increasing volume and
types of functional genomics data generously shared by the
laboratories that produce them, user interface preferences will
also differ, e.g. non-experts (including pupils in science class)
will embrace clarity and intuitiveness, while annotators will be
accustomed to dense and comprehensive displays.

The readiness of malaria biologists to share data has inspired
many valuable community resources alongside the main genomic
repository for Plasmodium, PlasmoDB (www.plasmodb.org).
Several of these provide derived and related information includ-
ing the results of local computational annotation and predic-
tions, e.g. at the DFCI Gene Index site (Quackenbush et al.,
2001), PlasmoDraft (Brehelin et al., 2008) and MalPort
(Joubert et al., 2009). Some resources also emphasize genomic
context in coloured linear displays using the familiar “genome

browser’ formats, e.g. the Malaria Genome Browser at the
University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) (Chakrabarti
et al., 2007) which provides richly annotated versions of such
displays. However, navigation of the data hosted at these, or
similar, resources is generally limited to a traditional single-
gene-at-a-time perspective. Although this is excellent for some
uses, investigating groups of genes seems vital, e.g. when inves-
tigating how gene products may work together as a system. The
currently common formats for multiple-gene-information are
large indexed tables and/or textual/link annotation accompany-
ing individual genes. This can be quite effective for screening, e. g.
via the PlasmoDB/EuPathDB search interface that allows users
to screen secondary information to make more complex selec-
tions, but much room for improvement remains, particularly for
the laboratory biologist end user (who is not also an annotator).
We developed the Malaria Genome Exploration Tool
(MaGnET) primarily to enable users to try out a more deeply
integrated new user interface, and multiple-gene navigation
through highly visual displays (Fig. 1). Some displays were de-
veloped specifically to capture relevant aspects of malaria biol-
ogy (e.g. time-series viewing of mRNA expression, see below),
but most of MaGnET’s innovative aspects are transferable, and
hopefully adoptable by other developers.

‘Exploring’ the information for multiple genes is most pro-
ductive when the interfaces to different types of data (including
those that cannot be displayed in linear format, e. g. protein—pro-
tein interactions) are integrated not only in navigation but also
visually, e.g. by overlaying information from one type of data
(e.g. gene expression) onto visual displays of another data type.
It is difficult to effectively integrate, and display, some higher-
level data types (e. g. protein—protein interaction, mRNA expres-
sion experiments and pathway information) in the familiar brow-
ser templates. Accordingly some malaria resources that offer
more specialized information for Pfalciparum, e.g. PlasmoID
(Rao et al., 2009) (primarily protein—protein interactions),
plasmoMAP (Date and Stoeckert, 2006) (pathways) and
MPMP (Ginsburg, 2006) (pathways), provide speciﬁcally de-
veloped displays for individual data types. This imposes limita-
tions on how much integration between different data types is
offered to the users visually. Some nice examples of displays
integrating several types of functional genomics data exist in re-
sources that are not organism-speciﬁc. These include primarily
viewers that can map expression data (or other features) onto
molecular pathway displays, e.g. the Omics viewer in the
Pathway Tools package (Karp et al., 2002), GenMAPP
(Mlecnik et al., 2005) and the PathwayExplorer web service for
mapping of user-owned expression data (Mlecnik et al., 2005).
From a user perspective, it would be desirable to emphasize

integrated visualization much more strongly and systematically
than is realized in current publicly available software and
across more different types of experimental functional genomics
data.

Previous work in our group yielded a more integrated visua-
lization tool for the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
YETI (Yeast Exploration Tool Integrator) (Orton et al., 2004).
Here we present a similar development for model strain of the
malaria-causing parasite Pfalciparum 3D7: the Malaria Genome
Exploration Tool (MaGnET). MaGnET offers a simple and
highly visual ‘workbench’-style environment, as a supplement
to existing public genome databases. Additionally, some biolo-
gists may appreciate analyzing preliminary or conﬁdential data
prior to depositing it at a public repository.

MaGnET consists of a light-weight Java programme for
effective visualization linked to a MySQL database. It can
be used in two different ways: (i) online as a Java Web
Start version that connects to an online database server. Two
database mirrors are currently available at UCSC and the
University of Edinburgh (further mirrors are planned); (ii) as
a stand-alone version where both the Java programme and
the database are run (and administered) by the user
(Supplementary Fig. S1). MaGnET requires Java Runtime
Environment 1.6 or higher on Windows, Mac OSX and UNIX
systems; performance is best with Java Runtime Environment
1.7 and :4 GB of RAM.

MaGnET features speciﬁcally designed visualization of
different types of functional genomic data. Its four main
viewers are:

(l) The Genome Viewer visualizes the location of genomic
features. Groups of selected genes can be viewed in their
genomic context on a genome schematic showing the 14
nuclear chromosomes of P. falciparum, its mitochondrial
and its plastid chromosome. Advanced functionality
allows to overlay gene expression from stored data; users
can ‘step through’ a time series via a scroll bar and follow
changes during the parasite’s life cycle (Fig. 1A). Zooming
in on a chromosome allows to closely examine the genes
within a region of interest (Fig. 1B).

(2) The Protein—Protein Interaction Viewer allows to explore
networks of proteins predicted to interact by yeast two-
hybrid experiments. Maps containing all primary inter-
actions for selected proteins of interest are easily created
and expanded to include secondary interactions and so
forth. Similarly to above, protein and mRNA expression
data from a selected experiment can be overlaid visually
onto the interaction network (Fig. 1C).

(3) The Expression Data Viewer visualizes time-series expres-
sion profiles for individual genes/proteins and small
groups. Time-series graphs are constructed using the
JFreeChart library (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart). This

section also features a Query Builder utility allowing com-
plex querying.

(4) The Data Analysis Viewer enables keyword-based searches
of the database, e.g. by Gene Ontology term. A list of
matching genes is returned in an interactive table. The
whole table, or parts of it, can be carried forward for
exploration.

All viewers are screen-size windows, to maximize their graph-
ics and (customizable) use of colours to overlay information
from other data types. Displays update automatically when the
gene selections are modiﬁed. A navigation pane with clickable
thumbnails (‘Window Control Panel’) facilitates switching be-
tween viewers. See Supplementary Materials for an overview
diagram and data references.

MaGnET makes two steps forward in navigation that we be-
lieve are vital for the targeted non-expert users to take better ad-
vantage of what is offered by the data, and the stand-alone version
enables users with technical knowledge (or support) to include
their own data. From a developer’s perspective, we also hope
that our interface developments are realized also in other re-
sources that feature varied data types. A ﬁrst advantage of
MaGnET over most other tools is the degree of integration
over all its viewers. Second, when exploring different datasets,
users can carry two selected groups of genes across and modify
them interactively [add/remove any gene(s)] in any viewer. More
standard but practical features include an informative ‘fact sheet’
that can be brought up at any point (Fig. 1D) with genomic,
functional, structural, ortholog and sequence information, and
link-outs to other relevant databases (Supplementary Table S1).
Through inclusion of the open third-party programme Jmol
(www.jmol.org), MaGnET also visualizes 3-dimensional (3D)
protein structures or models at one click (Fig. 1E). The
MaGnET database collates primarily experimental data from
various public Plasmodium resources (e.g. PlasmoDB) and from
published functional genomic studies (Supplementary Table S2).
Individual data points from large-scale experiments should not be
presumed accurate without further corroboration (e. g. the valid-
ity of protein interactions may depend on correct refolding). We
will aim to include the best quality data currently available in our
updates and welcome user input. Like other resources cited above,
we include some predicted annotation, e.g. Gene Ontology and
InterPro functional assignments from PlasmoDB after careful ﬁl-
tering and labelling. With our non-expert users in mind, we aim to
only deliver data of at least reasonable quality, i.e. only conser-
vative predictions (Supplementary Material).

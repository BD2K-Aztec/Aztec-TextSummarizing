ABSTRACT

Motivation: Owing to the size and complexity of large multi-
component biological assemblies, the most tractable approach to
determining their atomic structure is often to fit high-resolution radio-
graphic or nuclear magnetic resonance structures of isolated compo-
nents into lower resolution electron density maps of the larger
assembly obtained using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This
hybrid approach to structure determination requires that an atomic
resolution structure of each component, or a suitable homolog, is
available. If neither is available, then the amount of structural informa-
tion regarding that component is limited by the resolution of the
cryo-EM map. However, even if a suitable homolog cannot be identi-
fied using sequence analysis, a search for structural homologs should
still be performed because structural homology often persists through-
out evolution even when sequence homology is undetectable,
As macromolecules can often be described as a collection of inde-
pendently folded domains, one way of searching for structural homo-
logs would be to systematically fit representative domain structures
from a protein domain database into the medium/low resolution
cryo-EM map and return the best fits. Taken together, the best fitting
non-overlapping structures would constitute a ‘mosaic’ backbone
model of the assembly that could aid map interpretation and illuminate
biological function.

Result: Using the computational principles of the Scale-Invariant
Feature Transform (SIFI'), we have developed FOLD-EM—a compu-
tational tool that can identify folded macromolecular domains in
medium to low resolution (4—15A) electron density maps and return
a model of the constituent polypeptides in a fully automated fashion.
As a by-product, FOLD-EM can also do flexible multi-domain fitting
that may provide insight into conformational changes that occur in
macromolecular assemblies.

Availability and implementation: FOLD-EM is available at: http://cs.
stanford.edu/~mitul/foldEM/, as a free open source software to the

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent technological advances have resulted in exponential
growth of the amount of data available at each level of the se-
quence—structure—function relationship. Along with this expan-
sion of available data comes the need for systematic and
objective methods for its analysis and interpretation. For ex-
ample, the amount of information that can be extracted from
the structure of an isolated macromolecule is limited; to fully
understand how a macromolecule functions in a cell requires
knowledge of not only its interaction partners, but also how
mutually induced conformational changes that occur upon com-
plex formation give rise to integrated biological function.
Toward this end, structural biology continues to tackle larger
and larger targets, ranging from radiographic structures of
binary protein complexes to cryo-EM image reconstructions of
large macromolecular complexes and cryo-electron tomograms
of entire cells. Unfortunately, cryo-elecron microscopy/tomog-
raphy (cryo-EM/ET) maps typically have low signal-to-noise
ratios, making their analysis and interpretation challenging and
somewhat subjective, depending on the skill of specialized inves-
tigators. Hence, there is a need for computational methods to
systematically and quantitatively analyze maps of macromolecu-
lar assemblies, organelles and whole cells. In particular, tools
capable of (i) identifying individual proteins within larger com-
plexes and (ii) characterizing conformational rearrangements
relevant to macromolecular function, would provide non-
structural specialists access to structural data, thus allowing for
enhanced biological perspectives.

We recently reported the development of a new computational
tool, MOTIF-EM, that solves a critical structural comparison
problem, P, in a fully automated fashion (Saha et al., 2010).
P is defined as follows: compare a non-atomic resolution struc-
ture (e. g. a cryo-EM map) with another structure (either another
map or an atomic resolution structure) and identify conserved
structural domains /motifs or structurally equivalent sub-volumes
between the input pair. MOTIF-EM solves P (Supplementary
Fig. S5), and thus detects conserved sub-structures in a pair of
structures, by using a novel algorithm inspired by a recent break-
through in 2D object recognition, the “scale-invariant feature
transform’ or SIFT (Lowe, 2004; details in Section 2).
Because of its unmatched effectiveness in carrying out feature
detection, adaptations of SIFT are being used in a wide range
of scientiﬁc applications including tracking of robots, 3D scene/
object modeling/recognition/tracking, human action recognition

and human brain analysis in 3D Magnetic Resonance images
and so forth (Lowe, 2004).

Based on the feature-recognition principles used in MOTIF-
EM, we have now created a new software tool, FOLD-EM, to
automatically identify macromolecular folds in electron density
maps and to characterize conformational changes that accom-
pany different biological states of macromolecules. FOLD-EM
systematically searches an input electron density map of a macro-
molecular assembly for sub-volumes that are structurally hom-
ologous to one or more protein domains present in the SCOP
protein database. By recursively repeating this procedure, a
modular structure incorporating all the ﬁtted domains is re-
turned, thus providing a preliminary Cor-backbone model of
the macromolecular assembly under investigation. Similarly,
using our approach, it is possible to automatically determine if
different transformations are necessary for ﬁtting different re-
gions when comparing a multi-domain structure to an input elec-
tron density map of a macromolecule that can adopt different
conformations. As a result, SIFT-based feature detection is in-
herently capable of performing ﬂexible multi-domain ﬁtting and
characterizing conformational differences between the structures
being compared. Our program assumes no a priori knowledge of
the type or relative orientation of macromolecular folds present
in the input electron density map, and thus provides a fully auto-
mated means of analyzing electron density maps of macromol-
ecules and their assemblies. Although the program was
developed for the analysis of medium to low resolution electron
density maps obtained via cryo-EM, it should work equally well,
if not better, with higher resolution electron density maps such as
those obtained by X-ray crystallography. Here, we (i) discuss the
computational challenges that needed to be overcome to develop
FOLD-EM; (ii) demonstrate the effectiveness of FOLD-EM in
carrying out ﬂexible multi-domain and large-scale ﬁttings using
synthetic and real data; and (iii) consider some advantages of
FOLD-EM compared with existing softwares that ﬁt atomic
resolution structures into medium to low resolution electron
density maps.

2 METHODS

The SIFT-based feature-recognition module used by FOLD-EM is based
on a similar module ﬁrst developed for our software MOTIF-EM (Saha
et al., 2010), which is summarized in Supplementary Text S1. Although
MOTIF-EM and FOLD-EM use a similar feature-detection algorithm
(Supplementary Fig. S1), the capabilities of the two programs are differ-
ent. MOTIF-EM is limited to pairwise structural comparisons between
two cryo-EM maps, whereas FOLD-EM is capable of a fully automated
large-scale structural comparison wherein an input electron density map
is systematically compared with representative domains present in a pro-
tein domain databank. By recursively identifying and ﬁtting independ-
ently folded domains in the input map, the program returns a modular
domain structure of the macromolecular assembly under investigation.
FOLD-EM can also be used for pairwise comparisons between two maps
or for ﬁtting high-resolution structures into lower resolution electron
density maps. However, unlike MOTIF-EM and many other ﬁtting pro-
grams, FOLD—EM will automatically determine if different transform-
ations are necessary for ﬁtting different regions when comparing a
multi-domain structure with an input electron density map of a macro-
molecule that can adopt different conformations. As a result, FOLD-EM
is inherently capable of performing ﬂexible ﬁtting and characterizing

conformational differences between the structures being compared. In
addition to writing new modules to carry out recursive large-scale and
ﬂexible ﬁtting, FOLD-EM development also required partial redesigning
of MOTIF-EM’s SIFT-based feature detection module (Supplementary
Fig. S1) to run ~10>< faster. Without this speed increase, carrying out
fold recognition by searching thousands of domains in the SCOP data-
base would have been slow and inefﬁcient. The speed-up was obtained by
recognizing that during the clustering phase (step 5 in Supplementary
Fig. S1), only about 10% of the clustering data, i.e. from the dense
most regions of the clustering space, was sufﬁcient to obtain accurate
clustering results.

FOLD-EM carries out large-scale fold recognition and ﬁtting as fol-
lows. In the ﬁrst step, FOLD-EM selects ~4000 representative protein
domains from SCOP. Usually the ﬁrst member of a SCOP domain family
is chosen, but additional domains are picked from the same domain
family if they are structurally at least 5A RMSD apart from at least
one of the selected domains. Within FOLD-EM, this SCOP subset rep-
resents all superfamilies of the ﬁve classes of SCOP protein domains:
all-alpha, all-beta, alpha/beta (mainly parallel beta sheets), alpha+beta
(mainly antiparallel beta sheets), and small proteins. FOLD-EM then
converts each domain structure into electron density by applying a
Gaussian fall-off at each atomic position to simulate atomic form factors;
these maps can then be furthered blurred to match the resolution of the
input map. Next, FOLD-EM scores each domain against the input
low-resolution structure in the following way. The feature-recognition
module in FOLD-EM returns a graph clique as the end result of compar-
ing two structures. The size of the clique (i.e. the number of nodes in the
graph) is returned as the ﬁnal score. The size of the clique is essentially the
size s of the common sub-structure (number of map grid points that make
up the sub-structure) between the input structure pair. For domain ﬁt-
ting, s translates as the number of residues that makes up the portion of
the input domain that ﬁts into the input map, and is the ﬁnal score (SFE)
returned by FOLD-EM for the ﬁt of a SCOP domain into the input
structure. The scoring function in Chimera’s (Pettersen et al., 2004) ﬁtting
tool, known as ‘average map value’, SAV, is used by FOLD-EM for sec-
ondary evaluation. That is, after some domains with highest SFE’s are
chosen, they are ﬁnally sorted using their respective SAVs to return the
ﬁnal list of candidate domains. If there is more than one domain in the
input map, a subsequent domain is similarly chosen, except that the re-
gions in the input map corresponding to the already chosen domains are
excluded from the evaluation.

Similarly, FOLD-EM carries out ﬂexible multi—domain ﬁtting by it-
eratively ﬁtting each domain present in a multi-domain structure. For
example, in the case of the three-domain protein, the entire three-domain
structure can be input to FOLD-EM along with the input map.
FOLD-EM will identify the largest domain and ﬁt this domain into its
corresponding sub-volume in the input cryo-EM map. The remaining
unﬁtted remnant structure will consist of the input map minus the largest
ﬁtted domain/s. In the next iteration, FOLD-EM will take the remnant
structure and search the remaining map for the best ﬁt. In this way,
FOLD-EM recursively docks each domain to its corresponding
sub-volume in the electron density map.

FOLD-EM is highly parallelizable. The fold-recognition test cases
using the SCOP database took 72—90 h to execute on a 100 processor
computing cluster at University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston
(UTMB). However, the same job should only take few hours using a
national computing cluster with thousands of processors. The one-time
docking/ﬁtting test cases took ~2 minutes, to execute on the 100 proces-
sor UTMB cluster.

FOLD-EM is available as an open-source software for the struc-
tural biology scientiﬁc community at http://cs.stanford.edu/~mitu1/
foldEM.

Simulated cryo-EM maps were generated from atomic resolution
structures using EMAN (Ludtke et al., 1999).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Evaluating the ﬁtting/docking module in FOLD-EM

To verify that FOLD-EM is capable of recognizing and ﬁtting
conserved structural domains into low-resolution electron dens-
ity maps, we tested the algorithm using simulated and real data.
First, electron density maps, comparable to those obtained via
cryo-EM, were calculated for a GroEL monomer in the 5—20A
resolution range. To assess the effect of search model size on
ﬁtting, we split the GroEL monomer into three separate do-
mains: (i) the equatorial domain (249 residues); (ii) the apical
domain (182 residues); and (iii) the intermediate domain (90 resi-
dues) (Fig. 1). Supplementary Table Sla reports the results from
ﬁtting each domain. The reported error values for ﬁtting each
domain into maps of different resolutions are low, demonstrating
the effectiveness of FOLD-EM in accurately ﬁtting domains/
motifs of varying sizes into relatively low-resolution maps. We
have also tested the ability of FOLD-EM to ﬁt atomic resolution
structures into experimentally determined cryo-EM maps.
Figure 2 shows the result of using FOLD-EM to ﬁt the known
atomic resolution domain structures of GroEL into a 6 A experi-
mentally determined cryo-EM map. For comparison, we also
tried ﬁtting the groEL domains using other popular ﬁtting soft-
ware including SITUS (W riggers and Birmanns, 2001),
FOLDHUNTER (Jiang et al., 2001), Chimera ﬁtting
(Pettersen et al., 2004), MODELLER (Topf et al., 2005),
COAN (Volkmann and Hanein, 2003), MOLREP (Vagin and
Teplyakov, 1997). In our hands, only FOLD-EM was able to
successfully ﬁt the GroEL intermediate domain. Similarly,
Figure 3 shows the results of ﬁtting the two-domain capsid pro-
tein from bacteriophage (1)29 into an experimentally determined
cryo-EM map of an isometric (1)29 particle. FOLD-EM success-
fully positioned both the HK97 and the bacterial immunoglobu—
lin (BIG2) domains of the capsid protein (Morais et al., 2005)
into their corresponding densities without any user intervention.
The resulting ﬁts agree well with previously reported results
[(Morais et al., 2005); Supplementary Table S5] obtained using
semi-automated means. In contrast, other popular ﬁtting soft-
ware (SITUS, FOLDHUNTER, Chimera ﬁtting, MODELLER,
COAN, MOLREP) were able to successfully ﬁt the larger HK97

 

Fig. 1. We test the ability of FOLD-EM, to ﬁt different sized domains
(the equatorial, apical and intermediate domains of GroEL; ribbon
models shown on left) into cryo-EM maps simulated from the GroEL
monomer (PDB ID: lOEL, density maps shown in gray), in the reso-
lution range of 5—20 A. The rightmost panel shows the result of ﬁtting the
three domains using FOLD-EM

domain, but not the BIG2 domain. We suspect that other ﬁtting
softwares failed in these cases because the BIG2 and the GroEL
intermediate domains are very small compared with the target
density. However, it should be noted that other softwares were
run using default settings, and it is likely that an experienced user
would obtain better results.

To further evaluate the effectiveness of FOLD-EM as a
docker, we ran FOLD-EM on 30 additional test cases, the suc-
cessful outcome of which is reported in Supplementary Table
S1b. Ten extra experimentally determined maps, used here,
were obtained from Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB).
Each map was accompanied by atomic resolution domains,
which were supposed to ﬁt the corresponding map. Each map
was further ﬁltered to additional lower resolutions (10A and
15A, respectively), which resulted in 20 additional maps. As
seen in the Table, in all these additional 30 test cases,

green ribbon models) into a 6A cryo-EM map (grey) of GroEL (from
Ludtke et al., 2004) using FOLD-EM. The ﬁttings are consistent
(Supplementary Table S5 gives ﬁtting RMSD errors) with previously
published results in Ludtke et a]. (2004). (b) Fit of the atomic-resolution
GroEL intermediate domain (blue ribbon model) into the 6A GroEL
cryo-EM map, as determined by FOLD-EM [as in (b) above] enlarged,

regions other than the intermediate domain region (circled), of the map
obtained using popular ﬁtting software—SITUS (magenta),
FOLDHUNTER (cyan), the Chimera ﬁtting tool (yellow),
MODELLER (red), MOLREP (blue) and COAN (green); the apical
and equatorial domains of GroEL were successfully ﬁt by other popular
software. We suspect that other programs were not able to ﬁt the inter-
mediate domain because it is very small compared with the target map

domain region (circled), obtained using the popular ﬁtting software
described above—SITUS (magenta), FOLDHUNTER (cyan), Chimera

(green). Again, we suspect that these failures occurred because the BIG2
domain is too small compared with the target map

FOLD-EM successfully ﬁtted the associated domains (PDB ID
in column #1), with reasonably low RMSD errors, further con-
ﬁrming the reliability of FOLD-EM as an effective docker.

3.2 Fitting models with non-precise boundaries

A strength of the feature-recognition algorithm used by
FOLD-EM is its ability to carry out partial matching. That is,
FOLD-EM can match and align two objects precisely even if there
is only partial structural homology. As a result, the user does not
need to precisely deﬁne the boundary of the domain to be ﬁtted
into a target map, i.e. the input domain might have some extra-
neous region/residues or may have some part of it missing. Figure
4a and b schematically illustrate the problems associated with
partial matching/ﬁtting. As seen in the ﬁgures, while trying to ﬁt
a structural homolog (black wire) into its corresponding region in
a map (blue region), presence of extraneous regions (red wire;
which does not have any corresponding ‘density’ in the target
map) can introduce ﬁtting errors. Here, we show that
FOLD-EM is able to ignore any extraneous regions and preserve
ﬁtting accuracy using both simulated and real/ experimental data.

In simulated data, as earlier, we used FOLD-EM to ﬁt the
three domains of GroEL into simulated cryo-EM maps of
GroEL. However, we have now added extraneous structural fea-
tures/residues to each domain of the search model (Fig. 5a—c)
that are not present in the simulated maps. Supplementary Table
S2a—c show the results obtained by using FOLD-EM to ﬁt these
altered atomic resolution domain structures, each with differing
amounts of extraneous structures/residues introduced, into simu-
lated cryo-EM maps of GroEL. The low RMSD errors demon-
strate the effectiveness of FOLD-EM in ﬁtting structures in the
presence of extraneous non-homologous structural features. We
also tested the partial matching capabilities of FOLD-EM by
correctly ﬁtting our structurally altered GroEL domains into
an experimentally determined 6A cryo-EM map of GroEL
(Ludtke et al., 2004). Figure 5d and e show successful ﬁts ob-
tained using FOLD-EM in the presence of extraneous
non-homologous structural features. The ﬁgures also show
how some popular ﬁtting programs (SITUS, FOLDHUNTER,
Chimera ﬁtting, MODELLER) failed to obtain correct ﬁts, most
likely due to the presence of extraneous non-homologous fea-
tures. We also tested whether or not FOLD-EM could success-
fully perform partial ﬁtting using search structures obtained
from other low-resolution structural methods such as low reso-
lution X-ray crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering and

 

Fig. 4. (a and b) Cartoon illustrating problems associated with ﬁtting
partial structures. The high-resolution structure (wire model in red and
black) has extraneous region (red), which does not have corresponding
density in the target map (pale blue region). This extraneous region can
act as noise and reduce the accuracy of the ﬁt and the associated score [as
seen in (b)]. As FOLD-EM can separate conserved regions from
non-conserved ones, it will ignore the red extraneous region, yielding
an accurate ﬁt (a) and associated score

cryo-EM. As a test case, we ﬁtted (Fig. 6a—h) the mature
conformation of the bacteriophage P22 capsid protein, ob-
tained via cryo-EM, into density corresponding to the immature
conformation of the capsid, also obtained using cryo-EM
(Jiang et al., 2003). Unexpectedly, FOLD-EM was also able to
improve the alignment of the two subunits reported earlier
(Jiang et al., 2003), as seen in Figure 6g and h (see
Supplementary Text S2 for the evaluation of this result). This
test case conﬁrmed the ability of FOLD-EM to obtain meaning-
ful ﬁts in spite of inaccurate domain boundary speciﬁcations for
both the search model and the target map.

To further demonstrate the effectiveness of FOLD-EM to do
partial matching-based ﬁtting, we ran FOLD-EM on an add-
itional 45 test cases, involving three different experimentally
determined cryo-EM maps (GroEL, Rice Dwarf Virus, 20S
Proteasome), the predominantly successful outcomes of which
are reported in Supplementary Table S2d. The three maps
were ﬁltered to lower resolutions (10A or 15A), to generate
additional maps. Here also, 10%, 20%, 30%, respectively,
extra residues were added to respective atomic resolution do-
mains (column #1) that were ﬁtted to these maps using
FOLD-EM. As seen in the Table, in all these cases,
FOLD-EM was able to ﬁt domains with reasonably low

Fig. 5. (a—c) show examples of independently folded domains with extra-
naneous non-homologous features that were successfully ﬁtted using
FOLD-EM. The red regions show the noise/extraneous residues that
were incorporated to test the robustness of FOLD-EM. (d) The ﬁtted
green ribbon structure shows the correct ﬁt (consistent with Ludtke et al.,
2004); Supplementary Table S5 gives the ﬁtting RMSD error) of the
apical domain with ~20 added extraneous residues (shown on right),
obtained using FOLD-EM. The rest of the ribbon structures show the
incorrect ﬁttings obtained using the popular ﬁtting software—SITUS
(magenta), FOLDHUNTER (cyan), Chimera ﬁtting tool (yellow) and
MODELLER (red). As seen, the incorrect ﬁts occur outside the upper
apical domain region, except in the case of FOLDHUNTER, where the
ﬁt is still off by at least 25 A RMSD. (e) The ﬁtted green ribbon structure
shows the correct ﬁt (consistent with Ludtke et al., 2004); Supplementary
Table S5 gives ﬁtting RMSD error) of the equatorial domain with ~150
added extraneous residues added (shown on right), obtained using
FOLD-EM. The rest of the ribbon structures show the incorrect ﬁts
obtained using the popular ﬁtting software—SITUS (magenta),
FOLDHUNTER (cyan), Chimera ﬁtting tool (yellow) and
MODELLER (red). As seen, the incorrect ﬁts occur outside the
bottom equatorial domain region, except in the case SITUS, where the
ﬁt is still off by at least 6.2A RMSD

RMSD errors, further afﬁrming the effectiveness of FOLD-EM
to do ﬁtting incorporating the issue of partial matching seen in
Figure 4.

3.3 Fitting that incorporates conformation changes arising
from domain movements

Another unique aspect of FOLD-EM is its ability to automatic-
ally carry out simultaneous multi-domain ﬁtting that accounts
for conformational changes resulting from domain movements
that may have occurred in the target low-resolution map relative
to the search model. Similar to the situation described above
where only part of a search model occurs in a cryo-EM structure,
conformational differences between structures being compared
can lead to inaccurate ﬁtting results; in general, it is challenging
to simultaneously align multiple domains if each domain requires
a different geometric transformation to ﬁt it into its correspond-
ing electron density. Here, we show that FOLD-EM can auto-
matically determine the extent of discreet structurally
homologous domains/regions shared by two structures, and
then separately ﬁt each structural unit/domain. As a result,
FOLD-EM is inherently capable of performing unbiased fully
automated ﬂexible ﬁtting that makes no assumptions regarding
domain boundaries or motions.

As a test case, three domains of GroEL, were arbitrarily rear-
ranged to create three different GroEL conformations that con-
sist of two, three and four domains, respectively (left images in
Fig. 7oa—c). We then calculated cryo-EM maps in the range of
5—20 A from the radiographic structure of GroEL, which assumes
a conformation that is different than any of generated confor-
mers. FOLD-EM was then used to carry out ﬂexible ﬁtting of
each GroEL confomer into the simulated maps (Supplementary

Fig. 7. (a—c, left) We created three ﬁctitious atomic-resolution structures
based on GroEL, one with two domains (a, left), one with three domains
(b, left) and one with four domains (c, left). Next, we attempted to ﬁt each
synthetic structure into a low-resolution density map of the structure in a
different conformation. For example, the three-domain structure (b, left)
is docked into a map (simulated from the three-domain GroEL structure
PDB ID: 10EL) in a different conformation shown in (b, right).
Embedded ribbon structures shown in the ﬁgures are the ones used to
simulate the respective maps. (d—f) Fitting of conformation #2 [d or
(b, left)] using FOLD-EM results in reorganization of the domains into
a new structure (e) that ﬁts the simulated GroEL 10 A cryo-EM map well

Table S3a—c, Fig. 7a—f), resulting in good overall ﬁts. The low
RMSD errors listed in Supplementary Table S3a—c show that
FOLD-EM is capable of unbiased fully automated ﬂexible ﬁtting.
To conﬁrm that the ﬂexible ﬁtting routine works with real data,
we used FOLD-EM to ﬁt the high resolution structure of one
conformation of GroEL into 4A and 6A cryo-EM maps of
GroEL in a different conformation (Fig. 8a—h).

Supplementary Table S5 gives the RMSD errors associated
with the ﬁts described above.

To further demonstrate the effectiveness of FOLD-EM to
carry out ﬂexible ﬁtting, we performed additional testing using
simulated and experimentally determined cryo-EM maps, the
successful outcomes of which are reported in Supplementary
Table S3d. The experimental maps used are of GroEL, Rice
Dwarf Virus and 20S Proteasome. The synthetic map was gen-
erated from four atomic resolution domains, as seen in
Supplementary Figure S6. This ﬁgure (ﬁrst column) also shows
the initial starting conformations that were ﬂexed by FOLD-EM
to ﬁt into the corresponding maps. The FOLD-EM ﬁts can be
seen in the third column. The ﬁnal ﬁtting errors of the individual
domains are reasonably low as seen in Supplementary Table
S3d, further attesting to the effectiveness of FOLD-EM in
doing rigid body ﬂexible ﬁtting.

It is possible to obtain similar results using existing ﬂexible

(a, PDB ID: 1AON), using FOLD-EM, into a lower resolution (4 A)
GroEL map (b, Ludtke et al., 2008) in a different conformation. This
needed spatial reorganization of the domains in the atomic structure,
resulting in a new structure (c) which ﬁts the target map well, as seen
in (d). (e—h) The same application and outcome as (a—d), except that here
the target map is the (6 A) GroEL map from Ludtke et a]. (2004)

(Schroder et a]. 2007), MDFF (Trabuco et a]. 2008), FLEX-EM
(Topf et a]. 2008) and the one published in Gorba et a]. (2008).
However, these other programs are all based on local search
approaches, and hence, by design, the ﬁnal ﬂexed conformation
can only be locally best (with respect to the initial starting con-
formation), and thus may not represent the best global ﬁt. It is
well known that local search approaches are dependent on start-
ing positions, and a different starting conformation may yield a
different ﬁnal ﬂexed conformation. This is the classical “local
minima’ issue. On the other hand, FOLD-EM is based on a
global search and hence the ﬁnal ﬂexed conformation will be
independent of initial starting conformations. Hence, FOLD-
EM is free of “local minima’ issues by design. However, in prac-
tice, we believe FOLD-EM and local search-based methods
should be used together in a complementary fashion. For ex-
ample, FOLD-EM could be ﬁrst used to produce starting
ﬂexed conformations, and then a local search-based method
can be used to generate pathways connecting initial and ﬁnal
conformations.

3.4 Fully automated fold detection and large-scale
structural comparisons using FOLD-EM

The fold-recognition/ﬁtting scenarios described above assume
the users know the fold they are searching for in an electron
density map. The users choose either the identical molecule or
a suitable homolog as a search model for fold recognition/ﬁtting.
Although homologous search models can often be identiﬁed via
sequence comparisons, it is not always possible to identify a suit-
able homolog based on sequence homology. However, lack of
sequence homology does not preclude structural homology, as it
is well known that structural similarities often persist over large
evolutionary distances where sequence vanishes. Hence, it would
be useful to have a tool that systematically compares structural
features of an electron density map with a large structural data-
base and returns the best ﬁtting homolog/s. Rather than ﬁtting
entire structures, the goal here is simply to ﬁt individual domains.
More complex structures can then be inferred from the relative

arrangement of individual domains. There are several advantages
to this approach. First, domain databases are designed to include
only representative folds, thus avoiding the redundancy present
in the PDB. Second, the combinations and relative arrangements
of individual domains can vary greatly in multi-domain proteins;
by ﬁtting domains separately, the search is not necessarily con-
ﬁned to the different domain arrangements present in known
structures. Hence, our modular approach to locating independ-
ent structural units is more akin to the modular design of pro-
teins in nature, and is thus capable of a comprehensive search in
spite of including only a limited number of structural units.

In this application, approximately 4000 representative protein
domains from the SCOP database have been chosen as a struc-
tural database of search models. The ﬁrst member of a domain
family is picked as the representative structure, and additional
structures from the same domain family are included if they
structurally differ by >5 A RMSD from each other. These struc-
tures represent all superfamilies of the ﬁve SCOP-domain classes:
all-alpha, all-beta, alpha+beta, alpha and beta, and small pro-
teins. Next, each domain is scored against the input electron
density map using a modiﬁed scoring version of the module
from FOLD-EM that has been optimized for speed, as described
in Section 2. The domains with the best score are then returned
as potential ﬁts for the input electron density map. Below,
we describe the use of FOLD-EM to search the SCOP data-
base and return a Cor backbone model in a fully automated
fashion, thus removing subjectivity from map analysis and reliev-
ing the user of the burden of identifying appropriate homologs as
inputs.

As before, we have used the well-known structure of GroEL as
a test case. Synthetic cryo-EM maps were calculated in the reso-
lution range of 5—20 A. FOLD-EM was then used to systemat-
ically search the SCOP database, identify the constituent
domains in each map and return the ﬁtted structures as Cor back-
bone models for each of the simulated maps (Fig. 9).
Supplementary Table S4a lists candidate domains selected by
FOLD-EM along with their associated scores for the simulated
10A GroEL map. The ﬁrst row of the table reports that the
chosen 90 residue intermediate domain was docked into its cor-
responding region in the map with an RMSD error of 0.49A

(with respect to the domain used to simulate that map region;
Supplementary Table S4b). Similar results were obtained for
simulated maps calculated at 5, 15 and 20A resolutions (ﬁtted
structures not shown); all reported error values are low
(Supplementary Table S4b), demonstrating the ability of
FOLD-EM to correctly identify and ﬁt the constituent domains
in noise-free simulated electron density maps of GroEL.

To verify that FOLD-EM is capable of correctly identifying
independent structural domains present in actual cryo-EM data
with representative noise levels, we selected as test cases several
moderate-resolution cryo-EM maps where the domain structures
of their constituent macromolecules is known. These structures
include: (i) a 6 A map of GroEL (Ludtke et al., 2004); (ii) a 7.9 A
map of the bacteriophage (1)29 capsid protein (Morais et al.,
2005); (iii) a 6.8A map of the Rice Dwarf Virus capsid protein
(Zhou et al., 2001); (iv) the 6.8A map of the 20S proteasome
(Rabl et al., 2008); and (v) a 12.5A map of the 70S ribosomal
subunit (Valle et al., 2003; Supplementary Text S3). Table l and
Supplementary Table S4c—e list candidate domains for different
regions of each protein along with associated scores that were
automatically determined by FOLD-EM. The domains with the
highest scores were selected as constituent domains of the output
Cor models (Fig. 10a—e). Supplementary Table S5 evaluates the
ﬁtting of the selected domains. In every case except for one, the
highest-scoring domains corresponded to the known domain
structures for each input map. The one instance where
FOLD-EM reported a better score for a SCOP domain different
than previously reported was for the bacterial immunoglobulin
domain of the capsid protein of bacteriophage (1)29, where the
correct fold had the fourth highest score.

Supplementary Table S4f—i report additional tests on simu-
lated cryo-EM maps. The simulated maps, in the range 5—15 A,
were generated from aribitratry spatial arrangement of four
atomic resolution domains as seen in Supplementary Figure
S7. Here also, for a given map, the corresponding Table lists
the domains with best scores, which are ﬁnally chosen by
FOLD-EM to build the Cor model of the map. For a given
domain, top ﬁve choices with associated scores are listed.
Finally, Supplementary Table S4i reports the respective ﬁtting
RMSD scores of the chosen domains, which are reasonably low,
afﬁrming the correctness of the chosen domains, in turn
re—afﬁrming the ability of FOLD-EM to do effective Cor model
building.

Existing programs capable of carrying out automated fold
recognition include EMATCH (Lasker et al., 2005; Lasker
et al., 2007), SPI-EM (Valazquez-Muriel et al., 2005), and
FREDS (Khayat et al., 2010). EMATCH is not independent

(Row #X, Column #3) elaborates that property for that FOLD-EM method, and (Row #X, Column 4) elaborates that property for existing competing methods. For instance,

software in that it requires an input map is ﬁrst converted into a
collection of helices that have been identiﬁed in the input map, a
process that typically requires manual speciﬁcation of appropri-
ate density thresholds for helix identiﬁcation (J iang et al., 2003));
non-helical information is not used. Hence this approach is not
suitable for those input cryo-EM maps that are predominantly
deﬁned by non-helical structural elements or hardly detectable
helices (e.g. maps with short helices, maps coarser than 10A
resolution). FOLD-EM, on the other hand, is fully automated
and does not require any reduction of input maps. Furthermore,
FOLD-EM is not limited to analyzing maps of structures that
are predominantly helical. SPI-EM assigns an input map to a
speciﬁc CATH superfamily, whereas FOLD-EM, E-MATCH
and FREDS focus on identifying speciﬁc domain folds within
a map. Unlike FOLD-EM, both SPI-EM and FREDS are de-
pendent on the results obtained using third-party ﬁtting soft-
ware—SITUS and MOLREP, respectively. Here, we have
shown how some existing popular ﬁtting software, including
SITUS and MOLREP, failed in certain test cases (e.g. ﬁtting
of the GroEL intermediate and the BIG2 domains into the
maps of GroEL and (1)29, respectively) where FOLD-EM suc-
ceeded. Hence, the choice of a robust ﬁtting module is critical
and is an important feature that sets FOLD-EM apart from
FREDS and SPI-EM. Furthermore, we note that in the
FREDS publication (Khayat et al., 2010), potentially subjective
manual segmentation of individual domains in the input GroEL
map were required for successful implementation of the pro-
gram. The results presented above (Section 3.1) suggest that
manual segmentation is necessary because MOLREP, the ﬁtter
used by FREDS, fails to ﬁt the small intermediate domain in the
unsegmented GroEL monomer (Fig. 2c). FOLD-EM does not
require any manual processing of input maps, and hence achieves
higher level of automation and a lower degree of subjectivity in

building Cor backbone models. Finally EMATCH, FREDS and
SPI-EM can be used only as long as the third-party methods
(helix detectors or domain ﬁtters), which they depend on,
remain available to the users. FOLD-EM does not have such
dependency issue, as its basic modules (ﬁtters, etc.) are all inbuilt.

3.5 Summary of Comparisons

Finally, in Table 2, we summarize the properties that distinguish
FOLD-EM methods from existing competing methods.

4 CONCLUSION

Inspired by SIFT’s broad applicability and driven by the current
need in structural biology to effectively and efﬁciently interpret
structures from electron microscopy, we have developed a new
software tool, FOLD-EM, to automatically and systematically
identify protein folds and ﬁt atomic resolution macromolecular
structures into cryo-EM electron density maps without any prior
knowledge. FOLD-EM is based on MOTIF-EM—our previous
adaptation of the SIFT algorithm for interpretation of cryo-EM
maps. We have adapted and extended the MOTIF-EM algo-
rithm to automatically identify folds and characterize conform-
ational changes in cryo-electron density maps of large
macromolecular assemblies. The underlying algorithm in
MOTIF-EM and FOLD-EM works by constructing rotationally
invariant low-dimensional representations of local regions in the
input atomic resolution structures and cryo-EM maps.
Correspondences are established between the reduced represen-
tations by comparing them using a simple metric. These corres-
pondences are then clustered using hash tables and graph theory
to identify structurally equivalent domains or motifs. The motiv-
ation to develop FOLD-EM from MOTIF-EM came from the
recognition that the SIFT-based comparison module builds

correspondences by matching smaller structural units, and hence
the algorithm should work even if only portions of the structures
being compared are homologous. Thus, the method is well suited
for building backbone models of large complex macromolecular
assemblies by systematically ﬁtting smaller independent domain
structures into a cryo-EM map of the larger assembly.
FOLD-EM accomplishes this task by recursively ﬁtting repre-
sentative domain structures from the SCOP structural database
into the input cryo-EM map and returning the best-ﬁtting
non-overlapping structures. FOLD-EM succeeds at least par-
tially because it is inherently capable of carrying out partial
matching; unlike other ﬁtting software, the FOLD-EM ﬁtting
module is not affected by extraneous structure in either the
target map or the search structure. Similarly, FOLD-EM will
also automatically determine if different transformations are ne-
cessary for ﬁtting different regions of the input search model; as
a result, FOLD-EM is inherently able to characterize conform-
ational differences (due to inter-domain motions, partial resem-
blances) between the structures being compared. Using
FOLD-EM, we have demonstrated its effectiveness in (i) partial
matching, i.e. successful docking/ﬁtting in the presence of extra-
neous protein residues; (ii) ﬁtting multi-domain structures into
cryo-EM maps in a single step while taking into account ﬂexi-
bility due to inter-domain motions; and (iii) performing fully
automated large-scale fold recognition and ﬁtting using a protein
domain database. The ability to automatically and objectively
carry out these challenging tasks allows non-specialists to per-
form sophisticated structural analysis and sets FOLD-EM apart
from other existing docking packages.

Abstract

Summary: The association of organisms to their environments is a key issue in exploring biodiver—
sity patterns. This knowledge has traditionally been scattered, but textual descriptions of taxa and
their habitats are now being consolidated in centralized resources. However, structured annotations
are needed to facilitate large—scale analyses. Therefore, we developed ENVIRONMENTS, a fast dic—
tionary—based tagger capable of identifying Environment Ontology (ENVO) terms in text. We evaluate
the accuracy of the tagger on a new manually curated corpus of 600 Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) spe—
cies pages. We use the tagger to associate taxa with environments by tagging EOL text content
monthly, and integrate the results into the EOL to disseminate them to a broad audience of users.

1 Introduction

The Encyclopedia of Life (EOL; http://eol.org/) is a web resource
offering biodiversity knowledge summaries of the world’s species to
a vast audience (Parr et 61]., 2014). It currently aggregates content
from more than 250 providers. These include textual descriptions
about the biology, such as habitat, of more than 900 000 taxa.

The Environment Ontology (ENVO) project aims to provide
a controlled, structured vocabulary to support annotation of

organisms with environmental descriptors (Buttigieg et 61]., 2013).
The ontology comprises ~1600 terms and is part of recommended
(meta—)genomic metadata standards (Yilmaz et 61]., 2011). Having
the environmental information contained in EOL annotated in the
form of ENVO terms, rather than as free teXt, would enhance search
capabilities and enable users to easily compile summary statistics
on, for example, the ecological distribution of any taxa. However,
manually annotating all EOL entries with ENVO terms would be

highly time demanding. An attractive alternative is to use text
mining to automatically tag ENVO terms. So far, the few efforts to
perform named entity recognition of environments have focused on
tagging bacteria biotopes (Bossy et 61]., 2013) or made use of generic
tools, not optimized for the task (Thessen and Parr, 2014).

Here, we present ENVIRONMENTS, a tagger capable of iden—
tifying ENVO terms with sufficient accuracy and speed to be useful
for annotating large text corpora. To benchmark the method, we de—
veloped a new gold standard corpus of manually annotated EOL
taxon pages. Last but not least, we have extended the EOL web
resource with ENVO terms for each taxon, which are automatically
mined from their textual descriptions.

2 ENVO term tagger

ENVIRONMENTS identifies ENVO terms in text using the same fast
dictionary—based tagging engine as in Pafilis et al. (2013). The command-
line tool requires only a single parameter, namely the path to a folder
with the text files to be processed (see supplementary information).

We constructed a dictionary based on ENVO by extracting all
names and synonyms from the OBO file (see supplementary informa-
tion), excluding broad synonyms, obsolete terms, terms describing
foods rather than environments and terms representing organisms and
tissues, which are better captured by other ontologies. Names con—
nected to multiple terms were assigned to the one that best captures
its meaning, by ranking the terms based on whether the name was the
primary name, an exact synonym, a narrow synonym or a related
synonym of the term. Because ENVO usually lists only the singular
noun forms, we automatically generated plural and adjective forms.

A small fraction of the names will result in many false positives due
to homonymy. We created a block list of such names by inspecting text
for all names that appeared more than 2000 times in Medline and
EOL. To find important synonyms missing in ENVO, we tagged the
habitat and ecology sections of 1 342 968 EOL pages that are not part
of our evaluation set (see supplementary information), and inspected
all words occurring more than 100 times in untagged text segments.
Based on this analysis and false negatives found in the development
part of the curated corpus, we added 142 synonyms to the dictionary.

3 Manually curated corpus

To construct an evaluation corpus that covers diverse environment
types, we retrieved 313269 EOL species pages representing the

clades Actinopterygii, Annelida, Arthropoda, Aves, Chlorophyta,
Mammalia, Mollusca, Streptophyta. From these, we extracted the
sections about behavior, biology, dispersal, distribution, ecology,
habitat, legislation, migration, reproduction and trophic strategy.
After discarding very short (<100 words) and very long (>1000
words) pages, we randomly selected 75 species from each of the
eight clades. The resulting 600 species pages were randomly distrib—
uted among six annotators; 20% of the pages were given to two an—
notators to allow for assessment of inter—annotator agreement
(IAA). Each person independently annotated ENVO terms in the
text, with no knowledge of which pages had been assigned to a se—
cond annotator. Based on the shared abstracts we find that the me—
dian pairwise Cohen’s kappa is 0.65, implying that the overall IAA
is acceptable despite the difficulty of the annotation task (a Cohen’s
kappa value of 0 indicates random agreement, while a value of 1
total agreement). The corpus was partitioned into two sets of equal
size that were used for development and final evaluation, respect—
ively (see supplementary information).

4 Performance evaluation

Since the ENVIRONMENTS tagger recognizes names within text
and links them to ENVO terms, we benchmarked both aspects of its
performance. To quantify to which extent the tagger recognizes the
same text fragments as the annotators, we calculated precision and
recall at the mention level, considering both exact and partially
overlapping matches as true positives. On the evaluation part of the
corpus, this resulted in 87.8% precision and 77.0% recall, corres—
ponding to an F1 score of 82.0%. For the matches that were con—
sidered true positive for the recognition task, we further evaluated if
the tagger linked them to the same ENVO terms as the annotators
did. In 87.1% of cases, the tagger and the annotator agreed on at
least one ENVO term (see supplementary information).

5 Annotation of EOL

To realize the full potential of any text-mining system, it is import-
ant that it is adopted by the broad community and that its results
are disseminated to the intended end users. To this end, we have
integrated the ENVIRONMENTS tagger with the EOL web re—
source to provide users with ENVO terms for each taxon. Each
month, we rerun the tagger on all English text in environment-
related sections of EOL (see supplementary information). As of
October 2014, this gave rise to 1 077522 annotations of ENVO
terms for 234 582 EOL taxa.

We make these environment annotations available to end users
in three different ways. First, we show them within the EOL taxon
web pages, which provide links to the relevant paragraphs in the
textual descriptions for each ENVO term (Fig. 1). Second, they can
be queried through the web interface or the application program-
ming interface of the new EOL/Traitbank semantic web data reposi—
tory of organismal traits (http://eol.org/traitbank). Third, the full
annotation dataset can be downloaded in tab—delimited format from
http://download.jensenlab.org/EOL/.

6 Future work

The ENVIRONMENTS tagger is applicable to other large sources
of text than EOL. For example, it can be applied to text fields, such
as isolation source, in Genbank (Hirschman et 61]., 2008). Combined
with the SPECIES tagger (Pafilis et 61]., 2013), it can also be used to

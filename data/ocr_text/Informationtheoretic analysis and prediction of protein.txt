ABSTRACT

Motivation: It has been recently suggested that atomic burials, as
expressed by molecular central distances, contain sufficient informa-
tion to determine the tertiary structure of small globular proteins. A
possible approach to structural determination from sequence could
therefore involve a sequence-to-burial intermediate prediction step
whose accuracy, however, is theoretically limited by the mutual infor-
mation between these two variables. We use a non-redundant set of
globular protein structures to estimate the mutual information between
local amino acid sequence and atomic burials. Discretizing central
distances of Co, or C5 atoms in equiprobable burial levels, we estimate
relevant mutual information measures that are compared with actual
predictions obtained from a Naive Bayesian Classifier (NBC) and a
Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

Results: Mutual information density for 20 amino acids and two or
three burial levels were estimated to be roughly 15% of the uncon-
ditional burial entropy density. Lower estimates for the mutual
information between local amino acid sequence and burial of a
single residue indicated an increase in mutual information with the
number of burial levels up to at least five or six levels. Prediction
schemes were found to efficiently extract the available burial infor-
mation from local sequence. Lower estimates for the mutual infor-
mation involving single burials are consistently approached by
predictions from the NBC and actually surpassed by predictions
from the HMM. Near-optimal prediction for the HMM is indicated by
the agreement between its density of prediction information and the
corresponding density of mutual information between input and output
representations.

1 INTRODUCTION

It has been a common statement in biology that amino acid
sequences contain sufﬁcient information to determine protein
tertiary structures. Fulﬁlment of the implied possibility of struc-
ture prediction from sequence is actually considered one of the
most important unsolved problems of molecular biophysics, as
reviewed by different groups (Dill et al., 2008; Onuchic and
Wolynes, 2004; Shakhnovich, 2006). Such an intrinsically infor-
mational assertion, however, has only more recently been exten-
sively investigated within the context of Shannon’s information
theory. Although informational concepts have been used in al-
gorithms for secondary structure prediction from local sequence
since the 703 (Garnier et al., 1978), for example, the limit
imposed on prediction by the mutual information between
these two quantities was estimated only a few years ago
(Crooks and Brenner, 2004). Incidentally, an informational ana-
lysis of backbone dihedral angles has also exposed the unfeas-
ibility of tertiary structure determination from an even perfect
three-state secondary structure prediction (Solis and Rackovsky,
2004). The recurrent utilization of statistical potentials in com-
putational biology has also been interpreted explicitly in infor-
mational terms (Solis and Rackovsky, 2007). A particularly
relevant example is the analysis of pairwise contact potentials,
which revealed a surprisingly modest mutual information be-
tween contact partners (Cline et al., 2002; Crooks et al., 2004).
General distance constraints have also been investigated, at least
in the context of minimalist protein models (Sullivan et al., 2003).

Contrasting with secondary structure, atomic burials appear
to encode sufﬁcient information for structural determination.
Contrasting with pairwise contacts, they have a much better
chance of being adequately estimated from sequence informa-
tion. Monte Carlo simulations of geometrically realistic protein
models using native burial information, as expressed by atomic
distances from the molecular center, have successfully recovered
the tertiary structure of small globular proteins (Pereira de
Araujo et al., 2008). A simple computational experiment combin-
ing Molecular Dynamics of similar models with discretized burial
levels has additionally provided an upper bound for the amount
of required burial information. It actually turned out to be
comparable to, and therefore encodable by, the information
(entropy) of local protein sequences (Pereira de Araujo and
Onuchic, 2009). The observed discriminatory difference between

burial and secondary structure representations does not arise
therefore from a trivial difference in precision. A very precise
representation of all backbone dihedral angles can clearly
encode tertiary structures, even using a small amount of infor-
mation, or number of letters, in a-helical regions and possibly
,B-strands, but requiring a large, sequence-incompatible, number
of letters in intervening loops. The distinction appears to be more
basic and related to different types of information encoded in the
two local representations. While secondary structure is a local
representation of purely local structure, burials include global
structural information in a local representation, as is evident
from the fact that the whole tertiary structure is required for
determination of burials, but not secondary structure, of any
short fragment of amino acids.

The possibility of structural determination from sequence-
dependent burial information, when combined to appropriate
sequence-independent constraints, is consistent with the percep-
tible previous success in native fold recognition from the arrange-
ment of hydrophobic and polar residues (Huang et al., 1995). It
has also been further supported recently by a purely analytical
model which was able to recover native-like burial traces from
sequence hydrophobicity information combined to simple con-
straints on chain connectivity and overall globular size (England,
2011). A potential approach to tertiary structure prediction could
therefore involve a sequence-to-burial intermediate prediction
step. It must be noted that theoretical encodability, as provided
by entropy compatibility, is necessary but not sufﬁcient to dem-
onstrate actual encoding. The accuracy of any burial prediction
from sequence must be further limited by the observed correl-
ation between burials and sequences, as conveniently quantiﬁed
by the mutual information between these two quantities. In this
study, we estimate the mutual information between burials and
local amino acid sequence in globular proteins. The resulting
fraction of sequence entropy actually involved in burial encoding
provides theoretical limits to which prediction algorithms should
be compared. We additionally investigate the efﬁciency of simple
statistical prediction schemes, namely, a Naive Bayesian Classi-
ﬁer (NBC) and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), in extracting
the available burial information from local sequence.

2 METHODS

In this study, we estimated probabilities from frequencies observed in a
dataset of representative globular structures derived from PDBSELECT
(Hobohm and Sander, 1994). From the list made available in November
2009, we selected structures determined by X—ray crystallography with
resolution better than 2.5 A and excluded chains not satisfying the globu-
larity criterion given by the expected relation between radius of gyration
and the number of residues, Rg 5 2.9er/3A (Gomes et al., 2007).
Membrane proteins were also excluded, simply by removing PDB ﬁles
containing the word ‘MEMBRANE’. The resulting collection, from now
on simply referred to as the databank, is composed of 1499 chains, with a
total of ~263 000 residues. Statistical errors on computed probabilities
and entropies were estimated, and systematic biases corrected for, by a
bootstrap procedure using 50 randomly generated replicas of the data-
bank (Crooks and Brenner, 2004; Efron and Tibshirani, 1993). In add-
ition to the complete alphabet of 20 amino acid identities, we have also
used the reduced alphabets HP and HPN. Hydrophobic and polar resi-
dues were grouped in the HP alphabet as H = {A, C, F, G, I, L, M,
V, W, Y} and P = {D, E, H, K, N, P, Q, R, S, T}, respectively. In HPN

a third, ‘neutral’, class includes residues from both HP groups,
N = {A, G, H, S, T}. Burials, b, were obtained from the atomic distances
from the molecular center, r, of Co, or C ,3 atoms, normalized by the radius
of gyration, Rg, or b = r/Rg, and grouped in approximately equiprobable
burial levels, resulting in a collection of burial alphabets {xL}, where x is
either or or ,8, representing the atomic type for which burials are deﬁned,
and L is the number of burial layers. Cutoff burial values for different
burial levels were obtained from the estimated burial distribution ob-
tained by Gomes et a]. (2007). We usually use superscripts to indicate
block size and integer subscripts to indicate position within the block,
with ‘0’ representing the central block position by convention. If neces-
sary, however, we also indicate particular alphabets as subscripts in our
notation, such as H(Qﬁp),h(B,35), 1(Q96; 3372).

N—block entropies for residue identities, H(QN), and burials, H(BN),
were computed according to Shannon’s basic equation

H<XN) = — 21M) 10g2 pub,

where the sum is over all blocks of N adjacent letters, xN, either identities
or burials, and probabilities are estimated from corresponding frequen-
cies in the databank. A linear dependence of the estimated entropy on
block size in the range m <N < m’,

H(XN) = Nh<X> + EX. (1)

is consistent with a Markovian process of order m, where h(X) is the
entropy density and E X is the N—independent excess entropy, which indi-
cates the uncertainty resolved by local correlations. Deviation from lin-
earity for N < m arises from these local correlations between letters while
for N > m’ frequencies in the databank become poor estimates for actual
probabilities and the estimated entropy converges to an alphabet-
independent value that depends on the overall size of the databank, a
situation we refer to as ‘saturation’. Estimates for h(X) and E X can there-
fore be obtained from the observed dependence of H(XN) on N if the
order of the underlying Markov process is sufﬁciently small and the
dataset is sufﬁciently large so that m << m’ and the linear region can be
clearly identiﬁed.

For the mutual information between blocks of identities and burials,
QN and EN, a limiting linear behavior is also expected, or

1(QN; EN) = H(QN) — H(QNIBN) = Ni(Q; B) + Egg. (2)

and an estimate for the corresponding mutual information density, i(Q;
B), a quantity of much interest that imposes an upper limit on any pos-
sible prediction of the local sequence of burials from the local sequence of
identities, could again be obtained from N—block entropy estimates. In
this case, however, because the number of different blocks increases more
sharply with block size, saturation should occur at a much shorter block
length. We use therefore an approximation,

i(Q; B) ~ nggo 1(Qo; BN) 2 1(Q0; B”). (3)

that is valid when the letters in one of the sequences are statistically
independent both unconditionally and conditionally to the other se-
quence, as it turns out to be the case for identities with respect to burials.
The density of mutual information is estimated accordingly by extrapo-
lation of the dependence on N of I(Q0; BN), the mutual information be-
tween N—blocks of burials, BN, and the identity of the central residue in
the block, Q0,

I(Q0; EN) = H(Qo) — H(Q0|BN)o (4)

where H(Q0) is the single identity entropy, obtained with probabilities
estimated directly from corresponding frequencies, and H(Q0|BN) is the
conditional entropy of central residue identity conditional to burial block.
This procedure was used by Crooks and Brenner (2004) to estimate the
mutual information density between sequences of amino acid residues
and corresponding sequences of secondary structure assignments.

Burial information in globular proteins

 

Underlying conditional probabilities were obtained from correspond-
ing frequencies, or p(Q0|BN) = n(Q0, BN)/n(BN), only for the HP alpha-
bet, since statistics turned out to be sufﬁcient. For the other alphabets
conditional probabilities were estimated as

"(Q09 3N) + (20 X P(Q0|Bo))
n(BN) + 20 ’

 

P(Q0 lBN) = (5)

using 20 ‘pseudo-counts’ with prior probability p(Q0 lBo) in an attempt to
minimize artifacts from low-frequency events. Due to pseudo-counts, the
estimated mutual information turns out to be increasingly smaller than its
actual value as N becomes large. While the actual mutual information
must increase monotonically with N, its estimate will decrease for large N,
providing again a simple signature of databank saturation. For the HP
alphabet, pseudo-counts were not used and saturation manifests itself as
an abrupt increase in estimated mutual information causing an upward
inﬂection in the estimated curve. Data points were ﬁtted, before satur-
ation, to a single exponential f(x) = a — bexp(—x/c), with limiting be-
havior provided by adjusted parameter a, or to a symmetrically inﬂected
sigmoid f(x) = W + d, with limiting behavior provided by
a+ d. Fitting to an asymmetric Gompertz function provided similar es-
timates but with larger errors, reﬂecting the larger number of adjustable
parameters (not shown).

In addition to I(Q0; B”), we are also interested in the converse quan-
tity, I(Q°°; Bo), since it provides a limit for the prediction of individual
burial values given the local sequence of identities. Saturation might again
become a problem for large alphabets of identities, in which case it is
useful to consider the following lower bound:

N N

i=1 i=1

(6)

N
I(Q°°; Bu— 2 nggo 2m; BO) : HQ”: 30) (7)

i=1

Each of the N ‘positional’ mutual information terms between Q,- and Bo is
computed from the same number of possible combinations, independ-
ently of N. The results for the tractable HP alphabet and two burial
levels, shown in the Supplementary Information, indicate that Equation
(3) is indeed a good approximation while a strict inequality is expected in
Equation (7).

In order to compare our mutual information estimates with actual
predictions, we implemented two simple statistical schemes for predicting
discrete atomic burial levels from amino acid sequence in globular pro-
teins: a NBC and a HMM. Both methods are supervised learning algo-
rithms, i.e. they employ a learning step, in which they gather data from a
training set to generate some statistical model, followed by a prediction
step, in which they use the model to predict new data. We have used the
same dataset of structures as for the informational analysis, now ran-
domly divided in training and testing subsets. Statistical errors and biases
were again estimated by bootstrapping resampling with 50 replicas. While
the NBC estimates the probability for different burial levels of a given
residue simply from a local ‘window’ of identities in the primary se-
quence, neglecting most correlations between adjacent residues, the
HMM considers explicitly the correlations between ‘fragments’ of
hidden variables, including burials, which are modeled as producing the
observed primary sequence. Both algorithms are described in detail in the
Supplementary Information, as well as the procedures to obtain the cor-
responding prediction information, Ip, and prediction information den-
sities, ip, to be compared with the mutual information estimates
I(Q°°; B)‘ and i(Q; B), respectively.

3 RESULTS

Figure 1 illustrates the statistical behavior of local sequences of
Cf; burials, as determined from central distances normalized by
radius of gyration. N—block entropy is shown as a function of
block size N. Different curves correspond to different alphabets,
ranging from two to ﬁve equally probable burial levels.
Deviation from linearity for large N results from saturation of
the databank as all curves converge to the same alphabet-
independent saturated limit behavior. Deviation from linearity
for small N and, more perceptively, a positive intercept with the
ordinate axis reﬂect the expected local correlations between
adjacent burial levels. These results suggest a low-order marko-
vicity, with m not higher than 2 or 3. Analogous results for Co,
burials, shown in the Supplementary Information, indicate a
qualitatively similar behavior. For identities, on the other
hand, as also shown in the Supplementary Information, it is
apparent that H(QN) increases linearly from the origin for all
alphabets, being consistent with zero-order markovicity, m = 0,
or equivalently, statistical independence between amino acid
identities along the sequence. Accordingly, as shown in
Table l, residue entropy density h(Q) is very close to the
single letter entropy, H(Q1), increasing from essentially l
for HP sequences, h(QHp) % H(Q11{P) % l bit/residue, to
h(Q20) % H(Q§0) % 4.18 bits/residue for 20 amino acid letters
while mutual information between adjacent identities is close to
zero. Entropy densities of correlated burials, however, are sig-
niﬁcantly lower than corresponding single burial entropies, with
a positive mutual information between adjacent burials, such as
h(Bo,2) % 0.62<H(Ba2) % l bit/residue and [(B;B,+1) % 0.34 bit
for two Co, burial levels. Cﬁ burials consistently display larger
entropy densities, such as h(B,g2) % 0.73 and h(B,g3) % l.l bits/
residue for two and three burial levels, respectively, to be com-
pared with h(Bo,2) % 0.62 and h(Bo,3) % 0.95 bit/residue for Co,
burials.

Letter entropy, H(X), and mutual information between adjacent letters, I(X,-; Xi“),
are in bits. Entropy density h(X), in bits/letter, and corresponding excess entropy
E X, in bits, were obtained from data ﬁts shown in Figure l or in the Supplementary
Information. Each line corresponds to a different alphabet of amino acid identities
or burials, as indicated in the ﬁrst column. Error in the last signiﬁcant digit is shown
in parentheses.

The dependence on N of the estimates for mutual information
between N—blocks of burials and central residue identities,
I(Q0; BN), is shown in Figure 2 for two and three levels of C,
burials. Analogous results for Co, burials are shown in the
Supplementary Information. Mutual information density,
i(Q; B) R I(Q0; B”), was obtained by extrapolation from expo-
nential or sigmoidal ﬁts to the points before saturation, as indi-
cated by solid lines and shown in Table 2. Mutual information
density is always larger for C, burials when compared with Co,
burials with the same alphabet combination, such as
i(Q20; 30,2) R 0.09<i(Q20; 3,2) R 1.13 bits/residue. As could be
anticipated, it tends to increase with alphabet size either of amino
acid identities or burials such as, in the case of C, atoms, from
i(QHp; 3,2) R 0.07 bit/residue for the HP alphabet and L=2
burial layers, to i(Q20;B,3) R0.18 bit/residue, for 20 amino
acid letters and L = 3 layers. Databank saturation prevented re-
liable density estimates for L> 3.

Positional mutual information values, I(Q,-; Bo), are shown in
Figure 3a for 20 amino acid letters and different numbers of
burial levels of C, atoms. Positional mutual information is es-
sentially 0 for burial and identity pairs separated by more than 15
residues. We therefore use the sum 1 I(Q,-; Bo) with N: 31 as
a reasonable approximation of I(Q°°; BO)_ E  I(Q,-; Bo)
which, as indicated in the Supplementary Information, is ex-
pected to be a lower bound for I(Q°°; Bo). We were also able
to explore the effect of many burial levels on I(Q°°; Bo)_. As
shown in Figure 3b, I(Q°°; Bo)_ for C, increases signiﬁcantly
from two layers to ﬁve layers, approximately from 0.13 to
0.18 bit, but only slightly for additional layers with asymptotic
limit close to 0.2 bit. Qualitatively similar results were obtained
for C, atoms but mutual information between single burials and
local sequence tends again to be smaller in this case when com-
pared with C, atoms, although the difference is smaller than for
mutual information density, as also seen in Table 2. We also
show for comparison in the same table the mutual information
between single letters, 1(Q; B).

The performance of two-layer C, burial prediction is summar-
ized in Figure 4. Analogous results for Co, burials are shown in
the Supplementary Information. Prediction accuracy, A (a,b),

Mutual information between single letters, I(Q; B) in bits, mutual information dens-
ity, i(Q; B) in bits/pair, as obtained in Figure 2 and Supplementary Information, and
the lower estimate for the mutual information between single burial and local se-
quence of identities, I(Q°°; Bo): as obtained in Figure 3, for C0, and C, atoms are
shown for different combinations of identity alphabet and number of burial layers,
as indicated in the ﬁrst two columns. Error in the last signiﬁcant digit is shown in
parentheses.

Equations (S9) and (S10) of the Supplementary Information,
are plotted as a function of window size for the NBC (a,c) and
as a function of fragment size for the HMM (b,d). In addition to
the complete alphabet of 20 amino acids, tests were also per-
formed using the HP and HPN-reduced alphabets. For the
NBC, we report results for the simpler variation provided by
Equation (S4) of the Supplementary Information, NBC1
(non-shaded symbols), and also for the variation using positional
probabilities conditional to central residue identity, as provided
by Equation (S5) of the Supplementary Information, NBC2
(shaded symbols). Both accuracy and information increase sig-
niﬁcantly as the window grows from one to nine residues, but not
perceptibly for longer windows. Overall performance is higher
for C, than for C, atoms. For 20 amino acids, accuracy increases
from ~61% to above 65% for C, atoms and from around 63%
to above 66% for C, These few percentage points in accuracy
improvement actually correspond to around 100% increase in
prediction information, from around 4 to above 10 centibits and

Fig. 4. Prediction accuracy A (a,b) and prediction information I, (c,d) for
two levels of C, burials with different identity alphabets. Plots in the ﬁrst
column (a,c) show results for NBC predictions; the second column (b,d)
refers to the HMM results. The NBC method is bounded, within error, to
the limits established by corresponding I(Q°°; B0)_ estimates (dotted
horizontal lines), while the same limits are surpassed by the HMM
method ((1). In all plots, unshaded symbols represent the simplest version
of each algorithm (NBC1 or HMM with nothing but burial levels
encoded into the hidden variables) and shaded symbols represent im-
proved versions (NBC2 or HMM with secondary structures). For
HMM, half-shaded symbols represent the version that used side-chain
orientations

from around 6 to above 11 centibits for C,, and C,, respectively,
for NBC1. Further improvement provided by NBC2, although
hardly perceptible in the accuracy measure, is consistently
observed for prediction information, accounting for more than
1 centibit of additional information for 20 amino acids while

sampling error is of the order of millibits. For the HP and
HPN alphabets, both NBC1 and NBC2 predictions agree,
within sampling error, with the corresponding lower limits pro-
vided by I(Q°°; Bo)_ while for 20 amino acids this is the case for
NBC2.

For the HMM, tested fragment lengths ranged from 3 to 9,
but some conﬁgurations could not be tested due to hardware
constraints related to computer memory usage with many
hidden variables. It is clear in the plots of Figure 4b and d
that the fragment length has a direct correlation with the quality
of results for HMM prediction, especially when the full 20-letter
alphabet is used to represent amino acid sequences. The connec-
tions between burial levels and secondary structures (shaded
symbols) and between burial levels and two possible side chain
orientations (obtained from the comparison between C, and C,,
burials and represented as half-shaded symbols) were also inves-
tigated by incorporating the corresponding hidden variables into
the HMM states. Both approaches were successful in improving
the prediction of burial levels, and the usage of secondary struc-
tures was slightly more effective than that of side-chain orienta-
tions. Incidentally, it was found that not only the prediction
accuracy of burial levels but also that of secondary structures
is improved when both features are considered together (data not
shown). Our most accurate results for burial prediction were
around 67.5 and 68.5% of correctly classiﬁed residues, respect-
ively, for C,, and C,. Corresponding prediction information
values of ~0.13 and 0.14 bit are higher than the lower limits
provided by I(Q°°; Bo)_, as was consistently observed for the
HMM algorithm, particularly with the conﬁgurations that em-
ployed additional descriptors to the hidden variables and frag-
ment sizes of at least six to seven residues. As with the NBC,
prediction of C, was generally better than that of C,,.

Since the HMM algorithm works with relative probabilities of
fragments of burial levels, it is meaningful to estimate the density
of prediction information, i,, according to Equation (S12) of the
Supplementary Information, i.e. the amount of new prediction
information discovered for each new residue once the previous
burials have already been established. Figure 5 shows
hN(B|B(Q)) (a) Equation (S14) of the Supplementary Informa-
tion, for the various HMM prediction schemes for C, burials, as
well as corresponding values of hN(B), Equation (S13) of the
Supplementary Information, computed from block entropies
shown in Figure 1. The difference between these quantities is
the estimate for the prediction information density, ip, Equation
(S12) of the Supplementary Information, which is shown in (b).
Our results can be compared with the corresponding estimates
for the mutual information density between sequences and bur-
ials, i(B; Q), from Table 2, also displayed in (b) as dotted hori-
zontal lines, which should act as effective upper limits on
prediction quality. Analogous results for C,, burials are shown
in the Supplementary Information. Since 1', for N Z 7 agrees
within sampling error with i(B; Q), it is suggested that our
best overall results for two burial levels are extracting virtually
all of the burial information that is available in local sequences.

Figure 6 compares the prediction information achieved when
the NBC and HMM methods are applied to predict discrete C,
burials into more than two layers. Analogous results for C,, are
shown in the Supplementary Information. In all cases, it is clear
that the quality of prediction is improved when the number of

N umber of Layers

Fig. 6. As the number of discrete burial layers increases, the quality of
prediction, as measured by the prediction information, 1,, also improves,
at least up to four to ﬁve layers. The results are shown for NBC2 and
HMM C, predictions. Analogous results for C0, are shown in the
Supplementary Information. Window size of 15 and fragment size of 7
were used for NBC and HMM, respectively. HMM predictions were
performed with no additional descriptors to the hidden variables.
Dotted error bars represent the estimated lower bounds for the mutual
information between single burial and sequence of identities, I(Q°°; B0)—

layers is increased up to a number of 4. The rise in quality for
ﬁve or six layers, however, is less signiﬁcant, suggesting an upper
limit for the number of layers into which it is useful to split a
protein for burial-level prediction. As already observed for two
burial layers, prediction information tends to be larger for C,
when compared with C,, atoms. Furthermore, I(Q°°; Bo)_ values
are also approached by NBC and surpassed by HMM
predictions.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we estimate by extrapolation, neglecting long range
correlations, the mutual information density between local

sequence of amino acid identities and corresponding burials,
i(Q; B) R I(Q0; BOO). It must be noted that the underlying prob-
ability distributions, estimated from local block statistics, are
much simpler than distributions of whole amino acid sequences
and tertiary structures. In particular, they are consistent with
markovicity and a linear dependence of entropy, and mutual
information, on block length, as shown in Figure l. Meaningful
densities of entropy and mutual information can be estimated for
this simpliﬁed statistical scheme with different reduced alphabets.
Additionally, and most importantly, resulting estimates for i(Q;
B) provide upper limits for the quality of prediction associating
local sequences of burials and identities, a clearly attemptable
task with established learning algorithms. Prediction of single
burial values from local sequence, on the other hand, should
be limited simply by the mutual information between local se-
quence and single burial, I(Q°°; Bo), which is difﬁcult to estimate
for 20 amino acid letters due to databank saturation. We provide
therefore a lower bound, I(Q°°; Bo)_ <I(Q°°; Bo), further neg-
lecting local correlations between amino acid identities condi-
tional to single central burial. For the tractable HP alphabet,
the difference between I(Q°°; Bo) and I(Q°°; Bo)_ is a single cen-
tibit, as shown in the Supplementary Information.

Single sequence statistical behavior, as summarized in Table 1,
is qualitatively similar to what was previously observed for sec-
ondary structure by Crooks and Brenner (2004). While amino
acid identities in local sequences appear to be statistically inde-
pendent, short—range correlations are detected for the
one-dimensional structural descriptor, either secondary structure
or burial. Correlations between burials are stronger for C,, than
for C, atoms, as evidenced by smaller entropy density and larger
mutual information between adjacent letters in the ﬁrst case.
This observation is likely to be at least partly associated to a
longer distance along the sequence between adjacent C, when
compared with C,, atoms. As shown in Table 2, local sequence
appears to be more informative about C, than C,, burials, as
indicated by larger values of I(Q°°; Bo)_ and i(Q; B) in the ﬁrst
case. Nevertheless, the proportional contribution to mutual in-
formation from local sequence beyond single residue identity
appears to be larger for C,, when compared with C,, as suggested
by larger values for I(Q°°; Bo)_ /I(Q; B) for the backbone atom.

Our estimates for the mutual information density, i(Q; B), in-
dicate that the uncertainty about burials that is resolvable from
local sequence, already considering the reduction provided by
sequence-independent burial local correlations, can be as small
as 9 centibits/residue, as for two levels of C,, burials, and also at
least as large as 18 centibits/residue, observed for three levels of
C, burials. These values are comparable to estimates involving
secondary structure (16 centibits/residue; Crooks and Brenner,
2004), and are around 15% of the corresponding burial entropy
density. Estimates for i(Q; B) tend to be larger than for corres-
ponding estimates for I(Q°°; Bo)_, particularly for C,, atoms, in
which case the difference is consistently between 1 and 2 centi-
bits. It is suggested, therefore, that a couple of centibits of extra
burial information might be extracted from sequences, in this
case, when local burial correlations are accounted for. The
effect on C, atoms is smaller, again indicating a milder depend-
ence of burial behavior from the side-chain atom on adjacent
residues, either through their identities or burials.

Burial information in globular proteins

 

Presently investigated burial levels, deﬁned by equiprobable
layers of central distances, display some qualitative similarity
with burial levels deﬁned from accessible surface areas, as
reported by Crooks et al. (2004). Oscillations in positional
mutual information observed in Figure 3, reﬂecting secondary
structure exposure periodicity, are also observed in analogous
plots involving burials in that previous investigation, although
not for identities or secondary structure assignments. Notably,
however, single amino acid identities appear to be more inform-
ative about accessible surfaces than about central distances.
While single residue mutual information between identity and
two bins of burials reported by Crooks et al. (2004), is 0.15 bit,
our presently estimated value for 1(Q20; 3,2) is only 0.07 bit, or
about half of the corresponding density, i(Q20; 3,2), as shown in
Table 2. Correlations between adjacent central distances, on the
other hand, appear to be larger, as shown by larger values of
I(B,;B,+1) in Table 1 when compared with values reported in
that previous investigation.

These discrepancies might be partly associated to different
procedures for determination of burial levels. While levels of
accessible surfaces were explicitly determined from mutual infor-
mation maximization, our levels of central distances simply
maximize unconditional uncertainty. It is possible, nevertheless,
that intrinsic physical differences between the two measures are
also involved. Although correlated in globular proteins (Pereira
de Araujo et al., 2008), it is apparent that accessible surface area
should be affected more directly by residue hydrophobicity while
being somewhat less dependent on adjacent residues. It is not
presently clear how much information could be expected from
actual predictions of accessible areas from local sequence, since
mutual information densities have not been reported. Weaker
correlations when compared with central distances, however,
are indicative of a less pronounced increase in prediction infor-
mation with additional local environment beyond single residue.
In any case, even if eventually more predictable than central
distances, it remains to be shown if accessible areas can be as
efﬁcient in tertiary structure determination.

Our prediction results indicate that most of the burial infor-
mation shared by local sequences is easily captured by simple
statistical prediction schemes based on HMM or, to a lesser
extent, NBC. Interestingly, I(Q°°; Bo)_ is approached by the
NBC algorithm, which neglects most identity correlations condi-
tional to single burials, and actually surpassed by the HMM
algorithm, which appropriately accounts for such correlations.
Furthermore, near-optimal prediction for HMM algorithms is
indicated by the corresponding mutual information density ap-
proaching our present estimate for i(Q; B). From the results with
reduced identity alphabets, it is apparent that only about half of
the burial information extractable from local sequence using all
20 amino acid letters is still extractable when the HP-reduced
alphabet is used instead. The signiﬁcant improvement provided
by the HPN alphabet, with just a single additional letter, indi-
cates however that judiciously chosen reduced alphabets might
still be useful in actual prediction, particularly in situations in
which the size of the training set might become a limiting factor.
In the opposite situation, when the training set is sufﬁciently
large, prediction could be improved by increasing the number
of burial levels, as indicated by Figure 6, or by including more
hidden variables in the HMM.

In any case, independently of the size of the databank, burial
prediction information is unavoidably restricted within a small
fraction of the unconditional burial uncertainty, as provided by
the density of mutual information between identities and burials,
i(Q; B). Even considering the possibility of judicious partitioning
of the databank, such as according to chain size or structural
class, the basic situation is unlikely to change signiﬁcantly. As
has been previously noted (Crooks and Brenner, 2004), a small
amount of mutual information between local sequence and struc-
tural descriptors, when compared with the descriptor entropy
density, indicates that local structure, as reﬂected in secondary
structure or burials, must be largely determined by non-local
information. It is useful, however, to distinguish between
sequence-dependent and sequence-independent non-local infor-
mation. After all, a large amount of structure-determining infor-
mation is provided by sequence-independent constraints,
analogous to grammatical rules of human languages (Pereira
de Araujo and Onuchic, 2009). The information to be obtained
from sequences, corresponding in the same analogy to the actual
literature codiﬁed in written texts, should actually be much smal-
ler. The distinction between sequence-dependent and sequence
independent information is already apparent locally. The uncer-
tainty of lbit for two burial levels of a single C,, atom, for ex-
ample, diminishes to 0.6 bit due to sequence-independent local
information, or a reduction of 0.4 bit, while around 0.1bit is
resolvable by sequence-dependent local information. A particu-
larly interesting possibility, from the predictor’s perspective,
would correspond to sufﬁcient sequence-dependent information
for tertiary structure determination being exclusively local, while
non-local information would be sequence-independent.

A large amount of sequence-independent non-local structural
information is actually inferred from the small expected total
number of protein shapes, S2,, which has been estimated by dif-
ferent groups to be in the order of several thousands (Chotia,
1992; Govindarajan et al., 1999; Koonin et al., 2002; Zhang and
DeLisi, 1998). If S2, is assumed to be 10000, for example, the
corresponding entropy would be limited from above by logz S2,
and could not be more than around 13 bits per structure, or only
0.05 bit/residue for a putative typical length of 260 residues
(0.1bit/residue for 130 residues). This would be the uncertainty
about whole structures, and therefore burials, to be resolved
from sequence. The large remaining single burial uncertainty,
e.g. R (1 —005 2095) bits/residue for two C,, burial levels,
must therefore be resolvable by sequence-independent informa-
tion, both local (R 0.4 bits/residue, as discussed above) and
non-local (R 0.55 bits/residue, as a consequence). Note that
even if the total effective number of structures turns out to be
larger or smaller by up to two orders of magnitude, the estimated
amount of sequence-dependent structural information could not
change by more than a couple of centibits/residue. It is interest-
ing that an independent argument, based the thermodynamic
stability of globular proteins, provided a compatible entropy es-
timate, R 10—30 bits per macromolecule (Crooks et al., 2004).

This small amount of sequence-dependent information (litera-
ture), when compared with the large amount of sequence-
independent constraints (grammar), is an unavoidable
consequence of a modest total number of structures when
compared with possible sequences. It is also clearly consistent
with the sound elusiveness of possible solutions for the problem

of ab initio protein structure prediction, contrasting to signiﬁ-
cant success in homology modeling. Note that the entropy of
whole amino acid sequences must indeed be much larger than
structural entropy since many sequences fold to each single
structure (Koehl and Levitt, 2002; Larson et al., 2002), although
smaller, and less trivial, than estimated from local statistics.
Long-range sequence correlations have been detected
(Pande et al., 1994) and must produce deviations from marko-
vicity, contributing not only to reduce the entropy but also to
destroy its linear dependence on chain length. Crucially, in any
case, the presently reported small information for burial predic-
tions can still turn out to be sufﬁcient for structural determin-
ation when combined to appropriate sequence-independent
constraints.

5 CONCLUSION

Knowledge about atomic burial levels has been previously shown
to be both sufﬁcient for structural determination of small globu-
lar proteins and entropically compatible with amino acid
sequences. Our present results, however, indicate that only a
fraction around 15%, at least for C,, and C, atoms, of burial
uncertainty is resolvable by local amino acid sequence. On the
bright side, most of this sequence-dependent burial information
is easily extractable by simple prediction schemes, such as the
presently implemented NBC and HMM. Most importantly,
these predictions provide parameters for future folding simula-
tions completely independent of knowledge about the native
structure. The possibility of structural prediction of globular pro-
teins from amino acid sequence using atomic burials as informa-
tional intermediates, including a possible combined improvement
of sequence-independent constraints and burial prediction
schemes, can now be investigated directly.

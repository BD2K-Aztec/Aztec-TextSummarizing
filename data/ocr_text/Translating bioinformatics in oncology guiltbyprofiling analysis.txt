ABSTRACT

Motivation: Co-regulated genes are not identified in traditional micro-
array analyses, but may theoretically be closely functionally linked
[guilt-by-association (GBA), guilt-by-profiling]. Thus, bioinformatics
procedures for guilt-by-profiling/association analysis have yet to be
applied to large-scale cancer biology.

We analyzed 2158 full cancer transcriptomes from 163 diverse cancer
entities in regard of their similarity of gene expression, using Pearson’s
correlation coefficient (CC). Subsequently, 428 highly co-regulated
genes (|CC| : 0.8) were clustered unsupervised to obtain small
co-regulated networks. A major subnetwork containing 61 closely
co-regulated genes showed highly significant enrichment of cancer
bio-functions. All genes except kinesin family member 188 (KIF1BB)
and cell division cycle associated 3 (CDCA3) were of confirmed rele-
vance for tumor biology. Therefore, we independently analyzed their
differential regulation in multiple tumors and found severe deregulation
in liver, breast, lung, ovarian and kidney cancers, thus proving our
GBA hypothesis. Overexpression of K|F1BB and CDCA3 in hepatoma
cells and subsequent microarray analysis revealed significant deregu-
lation of central cell cycle regulatory genes. Consistently, RT-PCR and
proliferation assay confirmed the role of both genes in cell cycle
progression.

Finally, the prognostic significance of the identified KIF1BB- and
CDCA3-dependent predictors (P = 0.01, P = 0.04) was demonstrated
in three independent HCC cohorts and several other tumors.

In summary, we proved the efficacy of large-scale guilt-by-profiling/
association strategies in oncology. We identified two novel oncogenes
and functionally characterized them. The strong prognostic import-
ance of downstream predictors for HCC and many other tumors
indicates the clinical relevance of our findings.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death (J emal et al., 2009).
Despite evident improvements in diagnostic procedures and the
development of novel and effective therapies, the prognosis of
disease remains dismal for many patients. A thorough under-
standing of the molecular basis of cancer development is critical
to improve therapeutic options for a variety of cancers (Baehner
et al., 2011). However, the identiﬁcation of genes causally asso-
ciated with complex diseases such as cancer remains challenging
and therefore constitutes a major barrier in advancing our lim-
ited mechanistic understanding of the disease (Ioannidis, 2010).
Simultaneously, increasing awareness of the fact that high-
throughput gene expression analysis may reveal valuable insights
into cancer biology led to the establishment of a variety of cancer
microarray datasets and large microarray dataset repositories
(Barrett et al., 2013; Davis et al., 2007; Parkinson et al., 2011;
Sherlock et al., 2001). However, once published, these datasets
are most often neglected as regards to further analysis. In fact,
meta-analyses of this vast body of data are rarely attempted
(Cahanm et al., 2007; Krupp et al., 2011). The reasons are mani-
fold, ranging from the difﬁculty of integrating various technical
platforms to the absence of bioinformatics knowledge on the
part of primarily molecular oriented scientists, and the need for
advanced statistics (Ioannidis, 2010). Finally, these datasets
could be subject to alternative analysis strategies to obtain add-
itional information not yielded by ‘standard’ analysis protocols.
The concept of transferring gene function annotation from one
gene to another based on the proﬁle of their characteristics
[‘guilt—by-proﬁling’, guilt-by-association (GBA)] has been fre-
quently described. New biological relationships have been suc-
cessfully identiﬁed in GBA studies, including correlated gene
expression Wu et al., 2002), correlated phylogenetic proﬁles
(Date et al., 2003) and membership within gene expression clus-
ters (Hughes et al., 2000; Stolovitzky 2003).

Translating bioinformatics in oncology

 

Some guilt-by-proﬁling studies have exploited gene—gene
relationships by transforming them into gene functional charac-
teristics. This occurs when integrating gene expression proﬁling
or functional annotations of the respective genes (Wu et al.,
2002). Despite such proven success, no attempts have been
made to include samples from multiple tumor entities or samples
of both types of inference. The beneﬁts of such a large-scale
GBA approach are obvious because genes closely regulated
across >2000 samples and various tumor entities may be active
in a highly robust carcinogenic network. We therefore hypothe-
sized that integrating multiple sources of biological information,
such as expression proﬁling and functional annotation over
thousands of tumor samples and entities, may provide novel in-
sights into key regulatory changes in cancer development and
help to identify highly causative genes.

Using this approach and proving its feasibility, we validated
the use of bioinformatics GBA strategies in large-scale molecular
oncology, identiﬁed two novel oncogenes, demonstrated their
deregulation in several tumors, functionally characterized the
novel oncogenes, identiﬁed corresponding downstream targets
and showed the prognostic relevance of downstream predictors
for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as many other
tumors (Fig. 1).

2 METHODS

2.1 Bioinformatics data analysis

The ‘GSE2109’ dataset was obtained from NCBI’s Gene Expression
Omnibus 39 via the Bioconductor package ‘GEOquery’ 40. Further
analysis was performed using R (http://r-project.org). According to
the experimental description, signal values of the probe set were
summarized using the Microarray Suite 5.0 (MAS5) and normalized.
After downloading and combining the data into a single expression set,
the expression data were transformed for each array via the Z—score
(Cheadle et al., 2003). Gene-centered information was obtained by
summarizing and averaging the expressions of all gene-speciﬁc spots
per array as described by the annotation GPL570 and documented
in the Gene Expression Omnibus. Highly correlated gene expressions
were detected by Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (CC). Genes with
a CC of |CC| >0.8 were used for further analysis. For hierarchical clus-
tering, distances between genes within the reduced dataset were calculated
with Pearson’s CC and transformed through CC = l— |CC|, to be used
for hierarchical clustering. Complete clustering was applied to trans-
formed distances. To estimate the ideal number of clusters, the KL
index and the C index (Charrad et al., 2010) were applied to the clustering
result.

2.2 Analysis of gene expression correlation

The CC is a measure of the linear interdependence of the characteristics.
We used Pearson’s CC to calculate correlating gene expression, which
ranged between —1 and 1. Analysis of CC was performed in C++ be-
cause of the enormous quantity of data, and for parallelization by
Pthreads, which signiﬁcantly accelerated the analysis. An optimal
number of subclusters were identiﬁed using the C and KL indices
(Charrad et al., 2010).

2.3 Analysis of robustness of co-regulated genetic
subclusters

Main data were reduced to the speciﬁc tissues of interest (liver, colon and
breast). Robustness was calculated by applying the methods described

above to the selected tissue-speciﬁc subsets. Genes within cluster #4
in the main data analysis were subsequently mapped to the novel
tissue-speciﬁc clusters and analyzed for overlapping genes, genes with
changing associations and genes not being co-regulated >0.8 in speciﬁc
tissue.

2.4 Cell lines and vectors

The target gene kinesin family member 18B (KIF18B) and cell division
cycle associated 3 (CDCA3) sequences were obtained from the
NCBIGene. The annotated sequences have been cloned in a PUC57
vector. For overexpression in the mammalian cell line, a PCI vector
carrying a cytomegalie virus (CMV) promoter was used (Promega).

HUH7 cells were cultivated in advanced Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle
medium (DMEM). The cells were seeded into six-well plates at a density
of 1 million cells per six-well plate, 15 h before transfection. Transfection
was performed using Lipofectamine LTX plus (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM
medium. After 6h of incubation, the medium was changed to advanced
DMEM, and cells were cultivated for 24h at 37°C and 5% C02. Cell
harvesting and RNA isolation were performed using TRI reagent (Sigma-
Aldrich).

2.5 Microarray analysis

The entire genome array analysis was performed on an agilent human
whole-genome array chip at the Institute of Molecular Biology
(University of Mainz). All samples were analyzed in triplets. The R-ver-
sion 2.13.1 and the extension array QualityMetrics 3.8.0 were used to
process the results. Ingenuity and Prism (Graphpad) were the basis of
further analyses for change of expression, networking and survival
analysis.

2.6 qPCR Analysis

For qPCR on the targets found by bioinformatics, a two-step strategy
was selected. Reverse transcription was performed with the RevertAid H
Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas) using an oligo-dT-
primer. Quantitative analysis itself was done with QuantiTect Primer
Assays (Quiagen) in a LightCycler LC480 (Roche). Three biological sam-
ples were run in triplicate and quantiﬁed using a comparative cycle
threshold. Further evaluation and t-testing were performed with MS
Excel 2010.

2.7 Colony-forming assay

Proliferation of the cells was examined with the colony-forming
assay. Transfected cells and controls were shown at densities of 5000
and 10000 cells per well. Cells were grown for 1 week, changing media
every second day. Colonies were then stained with crystal violet for
analysis.

2.8 Impact of CDCA3 and KIF18B target gene
expression for survival of patients with HCC;
predictor development

To investigate the prognostic relevance of CDCA3- and KIF 18B-
dependent target genes in human HCC, we analyzed a dataset containing
53 human genome-wide HCC microarrays (Andersen et al., 2009) using
BRB array tools (http://1inus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html; version
3.8.0). All data were subjected to log2 transformation. After normaliza-
tion using the median over the entire array, all genes with a percentage of
missing data >20% were excluded. The remaining genes were ﬁltered for
either the CDCA3 or the KIF18B target gene list. Unsupervised hierarch-
ical clustering using Euclidean distance and average linkage were used to
split the human dataset into two subgroups: A and B (cluster 3; Eisen
et al., 1998). For comparing the difference in survival between the two

subgroups, we performed Kaplan—Meier survival analysis and the log-
rank test using the MedCalc software packages (http://www.medcalc.be).
To develop a CDCA3- and KIF18B-dependent predictor, we calculated
the average expression for each gene in both cluster groups of the
training dataset. As the next step, independent test data from 242 patients
with HCC (Roessler et al., 2010) were correlated to this predictor by
means of Pearson’s correlation. Patients were assigned to one of the
two groups (A or B), depending on the higher correlation value.
Survival for patients in the test data subgroups was again analyzed by
plotting Kaplan—Meier curves (Supplementary Fig. S1).

clustering of all 428 genes with correlation 2 0.8 over all 2158 datasets.
(E) Enlargement of subcluster #4 containing 61 single genes

Using Pearson’s CC of |CC| 2 0.8, we identiﬁed 428 genes
(2.1%) as being highly co-expressed (Fig. 2D, Supplementary
Fig. S4). Next, we aimed to identify biologically interacting net-
works within this still large number of 428 highly co-regulated
genes. To estimate an optimal cutoff for separating subnetworks
on the basis of the initial unsupervised clustering, we performed
C index and KL index analysis and determined the optimal num-
bers of subclusters. As shown in Figure 2A and B, both algo-
rithms pointed toward good separation of clusters when 74 or 75
subclusters were chosen. For further analysis, we separated the
large unsupervised cluster of 428 genes into 75 subclusters, based
on a Pearson’s coefﬁcient of |CC| 20.56. On plotting the size
(number of genes) of these subclusters, we identiﬁed several
small, but also four larger, subclusters containing :20 genes
(cluster #3, 4, 14 and 16). Cluster #4 was by far the largest
subnetwork, containing 61 genes (Fig. 2D and E).

3.2 Identification of functionally related subnetworks by
means of biological function enrichment analysis

Analyzing the complete cluster of 428 genes that were found to
be highly co-regulated, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that

the most prominent bio-function was ‘Cancer’ (P-value: 1.74E-
26—8.7E-03, number of genes: 177), thus validating our
approach. In addition, other tumor-related bio-functions such
as ‘Cell Death’ (7.49E-10—9E-03, 101) and ‘Cellular Growth
and Proliferation’ (5.57E-07—9E-03, 121) were identiﬁed. Next,
subnetworks with high genetic similarity as demonstrated by un-
supervised clustering were analyzed in respect of their signaling
pathway and biological function enrichment. Among the largest
co-regulated subnetworks was a 61-gene—containing network (#4,
CC: 0.59—0.88) that had mainly genes related to cell cycle regu-
lation and cancer development as determined by PubMatrix
analysis (Becker et al., 2003). Other co-regulated subnetworks
were found to contain enrichment of ribosomal genes (#14, 41
genes, CC: 0.66—0.98); these genes are involved in immunity (#16,
42 genes, CC: 0.56—0.96) and immunological events (Fig. 2D).

3.3 Robustness of co-regulated genetic subclusters

Given our hypothesis that the co-regulated networks functionally
interact and also for the purpose of biological relevance, these
networks should be visible on overall analysis and also stable
within individual tissues. For this reason, we compared their
stability and behavior in HCC (45 samples, 2.1% of the overall
data), breast cancer (353 samples, 16.4%) and colon cancer sam-
ples (289 samples, 13.4%). An overlap of 255 of the 428 genes
was continuously co-regulated in all three tissues. On average,
78.2% of the genes in the four largest subclusters (#4, #16, #3
and #14) were preserved (at least 57.1%). Thus, high coherence
of the cluster function was conserved in several tissues
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.4 Advanced functional analysis of a highly conserved
oncogenetic subcluster

Among the different clusters, #4 incorporated genes with high
enrichment of carcinogenic and cell cycle-regulating gene ontol-
ogies. Given the importance of cell cycle regulation for cancer
development, we decided to focus our subsequent analysis on this
cluster. To better understand the detailed molecular mechanism
by which these genes interfere with cell cycle regulation, we eval-
uated the enrichment of canonical pathways among these 61
genes. Top-ranked genetic pathways included the mitotic
roles of polo-like kinase (~2.73E-09), cell cycle: G2/M DNA
damage checkpoint regulation (~4.96E-04) and the role of
CHK protein in cell cycle checkpoint control (~7e—03). The ana-
lysis indicated the major impact of this subnetwork on G2/M
transition and checkpoint kinases (IPA analysis, http://www.in-
genuity.com, Fig. 4).

To obtain a broad overview about the known biomedical
information concerning these 61 genes, we next performed
a text-mining analysis using PubMatrix (Becker et al., 2003).
A search based on the terms ‘cancer’, ‘tumor’, ‘1iver’, ‘carcin—
oma’, ‘HCC’ and ‘hepatocellular carcinoma’ revealed that the
majority of genes (94%) had already been described with respect
to (liver) ‘cancer’. This served as the ‘proof of principle’ for our
approach. Two genes had not been previously described with
respect to carcinogenesis: CDCA3 and KIF18B. However, as
CDCA3 and KIF18B were part of this tightly co-regulated
oncogenetic and cell cycle-regulating network, we proposed as

of CDCA3 and KIF18B gene expression in breast, kidney, lung and
ovarian tumors compared with normal tissue. Both genes were highly
overexpressed in all of the diverse cancer tissues

a guilt-of—association hypothesis that these two genes may be
novel oncogenes essentially linked to carcinogenesis.

3.5 Activation of CDCA3 and KIF18B in multiple tumor
entities

To evaluate the importance of CDCA3 and KIF18B in carcino-
genesis, we next investigated differential gene expression in four
different tumor entities, i.e. breast, lung, ovarian and renal
cancer (11 = 5, each). Liver cancer expression was further evalu-
ated in a publicly available dataset of 60 patients (Shimokawa
et al., 2010). In all ﬁve tumor entities, a highly signiﬁcant upre-
gulation of both CDCA3 and KIF18 B expression was registered
in comparison with normal tissue.

Speciﬁcally, CDCA3 showed on average 227-, 159-, 560- and
l6-fold overexpression in breast, lung, ovarian and renal cancer,
respectively, compared with normal tissue. For KIF18B, the gene
showed on average >100-, 22-, >100- and >100-fold overexpres-
sion in breast, lung, ovarian and renal cancer, respectively,
compared with normal tissue. This was particularly because of
low expression in normal tissue (Fig. 3).

Besides, CDCA3 was overexpressed in 59 and KIF18B was
overexpressed in 49 of 60 patients in a Japanese liver cancer
patient cohort with a median 359- and 2.34-fold change, respect-
ively (Fig. 3).

3.6 CDCA3- and KIF18B-dependent downstream

vector transfection in HUH7 cells. Key factors of cell cycle regulation
were signiﬁcantly disturbed in terms of expression because of CDCA3
and KIF18B overexpression

after 24-h overexpression of both genes in HUH7 cells.
Compared with empty expression vector controls (PCI), we
identiﬁed 143 genes being differentially regulated by CDCA3
overexpression and 440 genes by KIF18B overexpression.
Functional annotation of CDCA3- and KIF18B-regulated
genes showed signiﬁcant enrichment of cancer-related genes.
Most downstream target genes showed consistent enrichment
of major oncogenic pathways for both genes (P = 9.20E-
06—l.01E-02 among CDCA3 target genes, P = 5.64E-
05— 1.09E-02 among KIF18B target genes). In addition, many
of the highest ranked associated network functions (CDCA3:
antigen presentation, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction,
hematological system development and function, cell death, cel-
lular movement and cell cycle; KIF18B: cell death, cellular de-
velopment, hematological system development, cell-to-cell
signaling and interaction, cellular movement and immune cell
trafﬁcking) or molecular and cellular functions (CDCA3: cellu-
lar growth and proliferation P = 6.75E-06—1.01E-02; KIF18B:
cell death 2.06E-06—l.10E-02, cellular development l.77E-
05—1.10E-02 33, cell cycle 4.41E-05— 1.10E-02 14) further sup-
port key tumorigenic roles of these genes and their associated
molecular signaling pathways (http://www.ingenuity.com).
Together, the enrichment of established cancer-related
signaling pathways and biological functions indicates that

overexpression of CDCA3 and KIF18B is deeply linked to func-
tional changes in carcinogenesis.

3.7 Cell cycle regulation by CDCA3 or KIF18B
overexpression, RT-PCR validation

As cell cycle regulation is a major halhnark of genes
involved in carcinogenesis, we investigated the impact of
CDCA3 or KIF18B on cell cycle regulation in greater detail
(Fig.4).

3.8 Cell cycle regulation

The importance of cyclin D1, CDK4 CDK2 and p2l/CDKNlA
for Gl/S-phase transition is widely accepted (Sherr, 1996).
Disruption of these genes was analyzed. All four genes showed
signiﬁcant downregulation after CDCA3 overexpression (cyclin
D1: —0.37, P = 0.01; CDK4: —0.5, P = 0.020; CDK—2: —0.84,
P<0.01; p21/CDKNAl: —0.93-fold, P<0.01). The residual ac-
tivity of 7% for p21/CDKNA1, clearly shown to act as a tumor
suppressor, may be equated with nearly complete inactivation of
the gene locus. Even greater suppression was observed after
KIF18B overexpression (cyclin D1: —0.53, P= 0.01; CDK4:
—0.68, P<0.01; CDK2: —0.86, P<0.01; p21/CDKNA1: —0.94,
P <0.01). Altogether, the overexpression of CDCA3 or
KIF18B caused considerable disturbance in the gene expression
of G1/ S cell cycle stage-regulating genes (Fig. 4). We then looked
for key regulators of G2/M transition (Bucher et al., 2008).
Consistently, on overexpression of CDCA3 the cells responded
with a strong increase in activity of both examined cyclins, cyc-
lins B1 (2.38-fold, P<0.01) and B2 (l.78-fold, P = 0.03), com-
pared with PCI. Conversely, the activity of the corresponding
cyclin opponent WEE-l was reduced —0.40-fold (P<0.01).
Overexpression of KIF18B exerted an even stronger effect on
the upregulation of cyclins Bl (1.42—fold, P<0.01) and B2
(1.54-fold, P<0.01). Consistently, WEE-l expression was
decreased —0.2l-fold (P = 0.11). However, despite the clear
trend, the latter data failed to achieve statistical signiﬁcance
(Fig. 5).

3.9 Tumor suppressor and oncogenes

Besides major cell cycle checkpoints, well-established tumor
suppressor genes were signiﬁcantly downregulated after
CDCA3 and KIF18B expression. TP53 [Lee and Muller, 2010;
—0.34-fold (KIF18B, P = 0.11) to —0.43-fold (CDCA3, P<0.01)]
and the apoptosis-inducing gene TRAF2 (Takeuchi et al., 1996)
were signiﬁcantly downregulated [—0.62—fold (CDCA3, P<0.01)
to —0.82-fold (KIF18B, P<0.01)].

Further, the oncogenes RAN [(Rensen et al., 2008) (2.04-
(CDCA3, P = 0.01) to 2.07-fold KIF18B, P = 0.01) and
TRIM37 (—0.74-(CDCA3, P<0.01) to —0.64—fold KIF18B,
P<0.01)] revealed a marked increase in expression on CDCA3
or KIF18B expression. Additionally, SKP-l, an essential com-
ponent of the Skp, Cullin, F-box containing (SCF) complex
complex involved in the degradation of WEE-l, was signiﬁcantly
overexpressed [1.29- (CDCA3, P<0.01) to 1.72-fold (KIF18B,
P<0.1) (Jia 61 al., 2009)].

Fig. 5. Overexpression of CDCA3 and KIF18B increased proliferation,
whereas the apoptosis rate remained unchanged. (A) The colony-forming
assay showed signiﬁcantly more colonies after overexpression of CDCA3
and KIF18B in HUH7 cells compared with the overexpression of the
empty expression vector (PCI) without overexpression of any vector.
(B) Analysis of apoptosis after overexpression of CDCA3 and KIF18B
in HUH7 cells showed no signiﬁcant difference between the overexpres-
sion of CDCA3 and KIF18B in HUH7 cells and controls

3.10 Overexpression of CDCA3 and KIF18B leads
to impaired proliferative capacity due to the
disturbance of cell cycle regulation, which is
a major deregulation in cancer

To further characterize the functional consequences associated
with overexpression of CDCA3 and KIF18B in vitro, we assessed
proliferative behavior by colony-forming assay. A massive
increase in proliferation compared with the PCI controls was
observed. Strongest growth was observed in those cells with
excessive CDCA3 activity (number of colonies). Notably, over-
expression of KIF18B not only changed the incidence of colony
formation but also resulted in a morphological change: larger
colonies were found compared with those after CDCA3 over-
expression (Fig. 5A).

Interestingly, the induction of CDCA3 and KIF18B did not
impair the apoptosis response as assessed by ﬂuorescence-acti-
vated cell sorting (FACS), underlining the predominant role of
these genes in cell cycle regulation (Fig. 5B).

3.11 Prognostic relevance of CDCA3 and KIF18 B
downstream target predictors

As the data detailed above pointed toward the major role of
CDCA3 and KIF18B in carcinogenesis in general as well as in
multiple tumor entities, we speciﬁcally investigated their prog-
nostic potential in various cancers, especially HCC.

The 143 CDCA3- and 440 KIF18B-dependent genes were
integrated into our 53 HCC patient database (training data,
Andersen et al., 2009). Unsupervised clustering resulted in
two distinct subgroups. On Kaplan—Meier analysis both the

Fig. 6. Kaplan—Meier analysis of the prognostic relevance of CDCA3
and KIF18B downstream predictors in a training dataset of 53 patients
with HCC. In all, 143 genes were signiﬁcantly differentially regulated with
dependence on the overexpression of CDCA3, whereas 440 were depend-
ent on KIF18B overexpression. Unsupervised clustering resulted in two
different prognostic subgroups. Both (A) CDCA3- and (B) KIF18B-
dependent predictors showed a signiﬁcant difference (P = 0.04, 0.01)

CDCA3-dependent and the KIF18B predictors demonstrated
statistically signiﬁcant prognostic relevance in these two patient
groups (P = 0.04, P = 0.01, Fig. 6). To validate these results, we
further correlated two independent datasets of 242 and 81 HCC
patients to the mean of each gene from the training data by
means of Pearson’s correlation (test data, Fig. 7). Kaplan—
Meier analysis again showed two prognostic subgroups with sig-
niﬁcant differences in survival in both datasets for CDCA3
(P = 0.0001, P = 0.009). The 242 patient datasets also showed
two prognostic subgroups with signiﬁcant differences in survival
for the 242 patient cohort (P = 0.005) and a trend to differences
in survival for the 81 patient cohort (P = 0.11). Early survival
showed highly signiﬁcant differences for CDCA3 (P = 0.0000,
P = 0.0001) and KIF18B (P = 0.004, P = 0.0006) in both
cohorts (Fig. 7).

Finally, we tested our CDCA3 and KIF18B networks for
association with prognosis in a meta-analysis of several other
tumors using the Oncomine database (http://www.oncomine.
org). Besides HCC, these genetic networks were found to be of
prognostic relevance in diverse tumor entities, including breast
and colon cancers (Supplementary Table S3).

information about carcinogenesis in general, which may not be
achieved by conventional microarray analysis (http://expo.
intgen.org/geo/home.do). To extract the key biological changes
and functions of carcinogenesis, GBA strategies may provide
valuable options for the analysis of data (Lee et al., 2004;
Wolfe et al., 2005). GBA assumes that genes with related
functions tend to share biological features, such as expression
patterns (Oliver, 2000). Generally, on a lower scale, GBA is a
concept used repeatedly in biology on a gene-by-gene basis.

Gene functions are frequently estimated and discovered using
the analogy of other functionally well-characterized genes. On a
genome-wide scale, several bioinformatics publications reported
on efforts to improve the computational aspects of GBA
approaches for predicting gene function (Hishigaki et al., 2001;
Pena-Castillo et al., 2008; Tsuda et al., 2005; Wolfe et al., 2005).
However, the number of biologically proven predictions based
on high-throughput approaches is still small, and the promise
of GBA as a general unbiased method for ﬁlling in unknown
gene function has not come to fruition. With respect to cancer
biology, only 34 publications are listed in PubMed (Sayers et al.
2012) when searching for ‘guilt by association’ and ‘cancer’.
Furthermore, most of these publications addressed only method-
ical aspects of the procedure.

Applying a combined guilt-by-proﬁling and GBA bioinfor-
matics strategy, we successfully analyzed the GSE2109 micro-
array repository providing data on 2158 microarray tumor
samples (http://expo.intgen.org/geo/home.do) These data did
not contain any corresponding normal tissue, which may be
one of the major reasons why this dataset was not comprehen-
sively investigated earlier in respect of differential gene expres-
sion or deregulated genetic clusters. However, as these data were
all generated from the same consortium on the same technical
platform, they seem ideal for a large-scale meta-analysis of gene
expression in cancer.

By analyzing genes for co-regulation across a large collection
of tumor samples instead of looking at the differences between
tumor and corresponding normal tissue, we identiﬁed highly

Translating bioinformatics in oncology

 

stable oncogenetic networks. We conﬁrmed these ﬁndings
by three different molecular and functional approaches: bioinfor-
matics combination of guilt-by-profiling and GBA strategies,
identification and molecular validation of novel oncogenes, iden-
tification of their downstream functional pathways and
identification of novel signatures of prognostic relevance
in HCC.

Overall, our work demonstrated the potential of integrating
intelligent bioinformatics analyses and sophisticated molecular
analyses as a highly valuable tool to obtain novel insights into
tumor biology, diagnostics and eventually therapy (Fig. 1).

Besides, we were able to successfully validate the high coher-
ence of a key regulatory network in carcinogenesis, not only in
overall analysis but also in individual tissues such as liver, breast
or colon cancer. This was of particular interest because averaging
Pearson’s CC over a large number of arrays and diverse tissues
may be limited by the drawback of the potentially high variabil-
ity of gene expression correlation within these diverse tissues. We
demonstrated two important aspects: given the stability of our
cluster, this network may be regarded as a key regulator in car-
cinogenesis. Second, combining GBA studies with a subsequent
analysis in a search of highly coherent subnetworks may
yield much greater success in translating this sophisticated bio-
informatics strategy into cancer biology and also enhance our
understanding of many other diseases in the future.

4.2 CDCA3 and KIF18B, identiﬁed by bioinformatics
GBA proﬁling, are key regulators of carcinogenesis
by interfering with cell cycle regulation

It has become clear that not all genes differentially expressed in
cancer are truly genes driving the neoplastic process (‘driver’
genes). It is therefore essential to distinguish these genes from
sole bystander genes (‘passenger’ genes). One of the most effect-
ive strategies is to analyze their interference with well-established
molecular changes in cancer biology. We therefore functionally
characterized our genes identified through bioinformatics guilt-
by-profiling. We provide several lines of evidence for the key car-
cinogenic role of these genes in many cancer entities, particularly
with respect to cell cycle regulation.

Loss of cell-cycle checkpoints are a halhnark of human cancer
because they result in permanent genomic alterations, such as
deregulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (Laiho
et al., 2003). Our data supported the interaction of both genes
with cell cycle checkpoint-regulating genes and a severe disturb-
ance of cell cycle regulation on overexpression of either one
(CDCA3 or KIF18B), ultimately leading to tumor growth
(Figs 5 and 6).

First, our large-scale bioinformatics pathway analysis demon-
strated significant enrichment of cell cycle-coordinating genes
due to overexpression of CDCA3 or KIF18B in the hepatoma
cell line HUH7.

Second, qRT—PCR analysis confirmed the deregulation of
multiple checkpoint kinases and central cell cycle regulation
genes, thus validating the obtained microarray data. B-type cyc-
lins, B1 and B2, essential components of the cell cycle regulatory
machinery and both closely connected to G2/M progression,
were found to be severely deregulated after overexpression of
either CDCA3 or KIF18B. Deregulation of these genes and

G2/M may have serious consequences on the cell, such as the
development of cancer. This is particularly because, during
this phase, cells may arrest transiently to allow for the repair
of cellular damage. G1 /S-phase-regulating genes were also
significantly deregulated, further disrupting normal cell cycle
control and enhancing tumor development. P21 deficiency was
repeatedly shown to be closely linked to carcinogenesis (Garcia-
Fernandez et al., 2011; Hawkes et al., 2011). CDK2 inhibition
(by p21) has also been linked to liver cancer development
(Kim et al., 2009). CDK4 complexes with cyclin D1 are involved
in cell cycle control. Again, this complex may be inhibited by p21
and such deregulation is found in liver cancer (Rivadeneira et al.,
2010). However, these changes may not only occur in liver cancer
but also in many other tumors.

Third, these data were independently validated by performing
an in vitro functional colony-forming assay, which also
showed significantly greater development of colonies after over-
expression of either CDCA3 or KIF18B.

Taken together, these data concerning interference with
cell cycle regulation clearly provide a functional explanation
for the driving role of carcinogenesis in several cancer types.

4.3 Prognostic relevance of KIF18B and CDCA3
target gene signatures

Gene expression signatures constitute a powerful achievement
in the development of novel diagnostic tools, such as accurate
and unbiased identification of prognostic subclasses and new
cellular targets in liver cancer. The signatures must be robust
to be useful in clinical therapeutic algorithms. However, the ma-
jority of the reported signatures were not confirmed in further
independent datasets (Marquardt et al., 2012; Teufel et al., 2012).
To demonstrate the predictive strength of our CDCA3 and
KIF18B downstream predictors, we evaluated two additional
independent datasets derived from 242 and 81 patients
with HCC, and were able to prove their prognostic role in
these independent test data (Figs 6 and 7).

Furthermore, as we had originally identified the two
novel oncogenes and downstream signatures using a tumor-
entity-independent/superordinate approach, we further validated
our dependent signatures in several other cancer tissues, such
as breast and colon cancer. Given the vigor of predictive signifi-
cance in multiple tumors, we believe that this signature is robust
in respect of essential regulation for HCC as well as cancer in
general.

5 CONCLUSION

Bioinformatics integration of oncogenetic microarray meta-
analysis, guilt-by-profiling and GBA strategies are a suitable
approach for the identification of novel carcinogenic networks
and oncogenes. Using this approach, we identified two novel
oncogenes (CDCA3 and KIF18B), demonstrated their deregula-
tion in multiple tumors, functionally characterized the novel
oncogenes, identified corresponding downstream targets and
showed the robust prognostic relevance of these downstream
predictors for HCC as well as several other tumors.

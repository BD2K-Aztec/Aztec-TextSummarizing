that allows researchers to develop new primers from collections
of sequences and to evaluate existing primers in the context of
taxonomic data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Using next—generation sequencing methods to characterize hundreds
of samples simultaneously in a single sequencing run has
revolutionized microbial ecology (Tringe and Hugenholtz, 2008).
However, primer design for such studies remains challenging. The
primers must amplify an appropriate region of DNA that is the
right length for sequencing and also taxonomically informative (Liu
et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007); a linker that is not complementary
to the target in any one of many diverse species must be inserted
before the barcode to avoid differential ampliﬁcation (Hamady et al.,
2008); and the set of barcodes must be checked to avoid formation
of secondary structure within or between primers (i.e. primer—
dimers) or between the barcodes and the primers. Additionally, the
techniques need to be generic rather than tied to one taxonomic
outline or database, so that many different target genes can be
studied.

Here we present PrimerProspector, an open—source software
package for primer design and analysis built using the PyCogent
toolkit (Knight et al., 2007), that resolves these issues. We recently

applied PrimerProspector to identify the 168 rRNA 515f/806r primer
pair as nearly universal to archaea and bacteria, and to optimize
this primer pair for increased sensitivity across these domains.
This optimized primer pair, applied successfully in several recent
studies (Bates et al., 2010; Caporaso et al., 2010; G.Bergmann et al.,
manuscript in preparation), has provided novel insight into archaeal
and bacterial community membership in soils by allowing for more
accurate determination of the abundances of taxa missed by many
commonly used canonical primer pairs, e. g. the Vermcomicrobia.

No existing tools speciﬁcally address the issues associated with
designing barcoded polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers for
community analysis. Primer design is a large ﬁeld and we cannot
survey it comprehensively in this article, but among a selection of
related tools, Primer Validator (http://bioinfo.unice.fr/454) allows
taxonomic assessment but does not generate de novo primers,
or allow a customizable 3’ weighted scoring system to predict
successful ampliﬁcation of tested primers. BarCrawl (Frank, 2009)
allows design of barcodes for speciﬁed PCR primers but not
design of the primers themselves, so is a useful complement to
PrimerProspector. RDP’s Probe Match (Cole et al., 2005) will report
sequences matching a probe, as does Greengenes’ probe function
(DeSantis et al., 2006), but these tools are tied to the respective l6S
rRNA databases and do not have support for barcodes. Primrose and
OligoCheck (Ashelford et al., 2002) are useful for small numbers
of target sequences, but do not scale well to thousands or tens of
thousands of sequences, as is necessary when designing universal or
near—universal primers, and do not incorporate differential weighting
of 5’ and 3’ bases in primer scoring. Primer BLAST uses Primer3
software to build primers of a speciﬁed length against one target
sequence, and then BLASTs the results against other databases
to ensure that putative primers do not target BLAST hits. This
functionality is also a useful complement to that provided in
PrimerProspector.

While applications of PrimerProspector to date have focused on
SSU rRNA primer design, PrimerProspector can be used for any
nucleic acid sequences and allows users to design de novo primers
based upon arbitrary multiple sequence alignments. User—speciﬁable
design parameters include primer length, degeneracy and targeted
regions for generation of primers. Existing or de novo primers can be
analyzed for predicted taxonomic coverage, as shown in Figure 1.
Finally, common pitfalls in primer design can be identiﬁed, such
as likely barcode—primer secondary structure, regions susceptible to

Fig. 1. Taxonomic coverage summary of the 515f/806r 16S SSU rRNA primer pair at the phylum level for (A) archaea, (B) eukarya and (C) bacteria. The
y—axes represent percent coverage and the value on top of each bar is the total number of reference sequences in each taxon. In this analysis, the reference
sequences were derived from the Silva database, and ﬁltered at 97% sequence identity with uclust (Edgar, 2010). Archaeal and bacterial sequences shorter
than 1450 bases, and eukaryotic sequences less that 1800 bases, were excluded from the reference set. As illustrated, this primer pair is nearly universal
for archaeal and bacterial 16S but is generally poor for eukaryotic (notably metazoan) 18S sequences. This plot and additional PrimerProspector analyses
informed the decision to use this primer pair in Caporaso et al. (2010), Bates et al. (2010) and G.Bergmann et a]. (2010). Comparisons with the unoptimized
primer pair and with an alternative popular pair (27f/338r) are shown as Supplementary Figures S1 and S2, respectively.

Convenient reports show amplicons or simulated reads that cover
regions of sequences that are not phylogenetically informative or
are of unsuitable lengths for sequencing.

2 METHODS

De novo design of primers is performed by ﬁnding short conserved sequences
in a given multiple sequence alignment to act as a 3’ binding site for
new primers. Once these sites have been identiﬁed, full—length forward or
reverse de novo primers are generated by incorporating the N upstream
or downstream bases, where N is 15 by default. De novo full—length
primers can then be sorted according to sensitivity, speciﬁcity or degeneracy,
and compared with known primers to ﬁnd matches or signiﬁcant overlap.
Speciﬁcity for particular target groups, such as archaea, can be obtained
by supplying an optional alignment of sequences from which to exclude
matches.

Primer analyses, including the prediction of taxonomic coverage, rely
upon scoring primers against target sequences. To predict its taxonomic
coverage, a primer is locally aligned to full—length target sequences with

known taxonomies, and scored based on gap, 3’ mismatch and non—3’
mismatch counts. An example of the graphical output is provided in
Supplementary Figure S3. The ﬁnal ﬁve bases are considered to be the 3’
region by default, and are considered to be the most important for PCR
ampliﬁcation. The scoring scheme is parameterizable. The RDP Classiﬁer
(Wang et al., 2007) is used to classify the resulting sequence fragments,
and the accuracy is displayed both in terms of which taxa are ampliﬁed and
in terms of classiﬁcation level of the resulting fragments. PrimerProspector
supports retraining of the RDP Classiﬁer for taxa coverage analysis based
on different reference taxonomies.

Descriptions of the scripts included in PrimerProspector, the various
outputs generated by PrimerProspector and an example based on the
F515/R806 primer pair are included in the online documentation at
http://pprospector.sourceforge.net/.

3 CONCLUSIONS

PCR ampliﬁcation continues to be a key step in many high—
throughput sequencing applications such as barcoded marker gene—
based microbial community analyses. PrimerProspector represents

a signiﬁcant advance over prior work in this area by providing a
single tool to facilitate primer design and analysis, including support
for barcodes (and associated linkers). PrimerProspector is a fast
and extensible framework for primer design and analysis, and has
already been successfully applied to help researchers identify the
most relevant and useful primers for their application, starting with
multiple sequence alignments for any nucleic acid sequence.

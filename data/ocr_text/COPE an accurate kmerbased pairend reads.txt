ABSTRACT

Motivation: The boost of next-generation sequencing technologies
provides us with an unprecedented opportunity for elucidating genetic
mysteries, yet the short-read length hinders us from better assembling
the genome from scratch. New protocols now exist that can generate
overlapping pair-end reads. By joining the 3’ ends of each read pair,
one is able to construct longer reads for assembling. However, effect-
ively joining two overlapped pair-end reads remains a challenging
task.

Result: In this article, we present an efficient tool called Connecting
Overlapped Pair-End (COPE) reads, to connect overlapping pair-end
reads using k-mer frequencies. We evaluated our tool on 30x simu-
lated pair-end reads from Arabidopsis thaliana with 1% base error.
COPE connected over 99% of reads with 98.8% accuracy, which is,
respectively, 10 and 2% higher than the recently published tool
FLASH. When COPE is applied to real reads for genome assembly,
the resulting contigs are found to have fewer errors and give a 14-fold
improvement in the N50 measurement when compared with the
contigs produced using unconnected reads.

Availability and implementation: COPE is implemented in C++ and
is freely available as open-source code at ftp://ftp.genomics.org.cn/

1 INTRODUCTION

With the rapid development of high-throughput short-read
sequencing technologies, a laboratory can now assemble a
genome within a few weeks using only a few thousand US dollars
(Glenn, 2011). Despite the fact that existing genome assembly
algorithms (Gnerre et al., 2011; Li et al., 2010) already designed
to fully utilize the advantages of short reads, the short length of
reads still deter us from a more comprehensive genome. Using
longer reads will signiﬁcantly improve the quality of not only

genome assembly (Magoc and Salzberg, 2011) but also transcrip-
tome (Martin and Wang, 2011) and meta-genome assembly
(Rodrigue et al., 2010).

To overcome this problem, new protocols for library prepar-
ation now exist that can generate pair-end reads with an insert
distance shorter than the total length of both reads, i.e. with the
3’ ends of both reads overlapped. This enables us to extend the
read length by authentically overlapping the ends of both reads
to generate a longer overlapped read. These longer reads were
shown to dramatically increase the quality of the assembled
genome (Magoc and Salzberg, 2011).

However, the insert distance cannot be controlled to be the
same for all read pairs, instead it follows a distribution. Together
with the sequencing errors, it becomes difﬁcult to determine the
correct position that the two reads overlap and what bases are in
the overlapping region in case the two reads do not agree. The
correctness of the connected reads is extremely important as
existing assembly algorithms are sensitive to errors. Many assem-
blers are based on the approach of de Bruijn graph in which a
read is sheared into k—bp long substrings (called k—mers) (Li et al.,
2010). One single base error will introduce k spurious k—mer. The
situation could be worse if a larger k is used. For Illumina
sequencing technology speciﬁcally, the sequencing errors tend
to intensify toward the 3’ end of the reads, which makes the
connection task more challenging.

To deal with sequencing errors, a straightforward approach is
to perform error correction before joining the reads. Many exist-
ing error correction algorithms (Kelley et al., 2010) may require
to trim the 3’ end of a read if the correction fails. This will sig-
niﬁcantly reduce the number of reads that can be successfully
connected. One of the most recently published read connection
tools, FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg, 2011), follows the idea of
performing error correction before joining the reads, and it is
found that quite a few read pairs cannot be connected as they
are trimmed. Other existing tools such as PANDAseq (Masella
et al., 2012) and SHERA (Rodrigue et al., 2010) also fail to
provide a method to overcome the problem either.

In this article, we present Connecting Overlapped Pair-End
(COPE) reads, a novel approach to connect pair-end reads by
utilizing k—mer frequency information directly to authenticate
possible overlaps of reads. We remark that k—mer frequency
information was also used in error correction in reads.

COPE

 

We evaluated the correctness of our tool on 30-fold simulated
100 bp paired-end reads with 1% error and found it surmounted
FLASH on both accuracy and the number of reads connected.
We also applied COPE to real reads for genome assembly and
showed that the N50 of the resulting contigs is 14 times longer
than the contigs produced using unconnected reads and even
with fewer errors.

2 METHODS

Before we present the details of COPE, we ﬁrst describe the limitations of
existing tools.

First, a minimum overlap is required. Since the insert distance is not
exact, the length of overlapped region varies. Existing methods require
typically at least 10 bp overlap at 3’ end because shorter overlaps often
occur by chance. A higher requirement of minimum overlap reduces
spurious connections but will miss quite a few true overlaps. For example,
using a Poisson distribution with a: 180 to simulate the insert distance
distribution for reads with length 100 bp shows that 17.2% of read pairs
are with insert distances from 190 to 200, i.e. the overlapping regions of
these pairs are of length <10. These read pairs could not be connected if a
minimum overlap of 10 bp is required.

Second, repetitive or low complexity patterns at 3’ end could signiﬁ-
cantly diversify the overlaps.

Third, base disconcordance exists in the overlapping region. For ex-
ample, FLASH selects a base by comparing the two base quality values.
Yet if the quality values are equal, the selection will be arbitrary, which
makes the connected reads prone to substitution errors.

COPE was developed to tackle these three problems. COPE
takes paired FASTQ ﬁles as input. COPE ﬁrst uses an alignment-based
connection algorithm similar to previous tools to connect those read
pairs with relatively long overlap and few errors and then utilizes k-mer
frequency and ‘auxiliary’ reads to further connect the remaining
read pairs (Fig. 1). It is worth mentioning that the latter step no longer
requires an overlap to be at least a certain minimum length. Details are
as follows.

2.1 Alignment-based connection algorithm

The foremost task in connecting pair-end reads is to obtain an authentic
overlap and to select the right bases in the overlap region. We align
both reads at their 3’ ends to check all possible overlaps with length
longer than k, where k is the length of a k-mer. Those with overlap
shorter than k will be examined in the next stage. Due to the fact that
indels would hardly occur in the Illumina platform (Nakamura et al.,
2011), no gap was allowed in COPE during alignment. For each

read pair, we calculate the matching rate for each possible overlap
using formula (1), where [overlap is the length of the overlapping region
and nIm-smatch is the number of nucleotides in the overlapping region that
do not agree

1{ate(loverlap) = (loverlap _ nmismatch)/loverlap 

If the matching rate is larger than a threshold, we mark the overlap
as a candidate and it will be assigned a ‘combination score’ computed
as follows. Consider a mismatch position in the overlapped region;
assume that the two reads have base b0 and 191, with error probabilities
e0 and e1 (inferred from the quality values of the bases), respectively.
If we choose [90, which means that be is authentic and b1 is a sequencing
error, then the probability for this base selection to be right is ‘1 — eo’.
For an overlap with multiple mismatches, we multiply the probability
for each mismatch based on the base selection. The combination score
of the overlap is deﬁned as the highest possible value for this multiplied
probability.

When there is no mismatch in the overlapping region, the combination
score is set to 1 (the highest possible score). The score will decrease with an
increasing number of mismatches and selected bases with high error prob-
abilities. If more than one combination has the same score, then we name
each pair-end read a ‘dilemma read’ and put it aside for next stage.

Unlike previous tools, COPE is more stringent in considering the align-
ment scores so as to obtain higher accuracy. We deﬁne the overlap with
the highest score as optimal, and the one with the second highest score as
sub-optimal (Fig. 2). It is required that the score difference between the
optimal and sub-optimal overlaps should be higher than a predeﬁned
threshold set by user. COPE takes advantage of the k-mer assisted
stage to re-consider those reads that fail this separation criterion. This
largely avoids inauthentic connection of reads with polyrun or tandem
repeats at 3’ end at this stage.

2.2 k-Mer frequency assisted connection

A k-mer frequency table is constructed for all reads and is used to handle
read pairs that fail to be connected in the previous stage. The basic idea is
as follows. Consider an overlap with a wrong base being chosen, the k-
mers spanning the base are inauthentic and usually of very low frequency.
Thus, we can generalize the combination score of an overlap using k-mer
frequency information by modifying the probability of base selection at a
certain mismatch position from (l—e) to n(1—e), where n is the percentage
of all possible k-mers spanning the mismatch with high frequency.
Theoretically, n will be large if an authentic base has been selected,
since the k-mers spanning the base also exist in other reads.

The threshold for classifying k-mers to be high frequency is determined
automatically from the frequency table using the standard technique
derived from genome assembly (Li et al., 2010). Generally, the new com-
bination score, which takes k-mer frequency information into consider-
ation, can resolve the majority of the dilemma reads from the previous
stage. More importantly, we ﬁnd that the frequency information of span-
ning k-mers is very effective in validating short overlaps (down to length 3
in the current implementation). This is a major improvement because

read pairs that cannot be connected due to too short overlap can account
to over 15% in a typical PE100 library with a 180-bp insert distance.

Note that checking the frequency information of all spanning k-mers is
time-consuming. COPE uses a trick to speed up this stage by avoiding
examining all spanning k-mers. The idea is that a spurious overlap usually
has some k-mers with frequency as low as 1 and seldom exceeding 3.
Thus, once we have seen a few spanning k-mers with frequency
lower than the threshold of 3, we stop checking other spanning k-mers
and immediately conclude that the overlap is spurious. In addition,
since k-mers from repetitive sequences are with extremely high frequency
(say over two times the average), if there are more than three spanning
k-mers of extremely high frequency, the read pair will be put aside for
next stage.

Most of the dilemma reads will be resolved in this stage, but a small
portion still remains unconnected. This may be due to the fact that these
reads contain some polyrun, tandem repeats or low complexity sequence
near the 3’ ends that are longer than the k-mer length. Notably, increasing
the k-mer length would not necessarily improve the number of reads
connected, but will drastically increase the computational resources.
Thus, we need another way to tackle those reads.

2.3 Auxiliary reads and cross connection

In the ﬁnal stage, COPE uses other reads to handle the read pairs uncon-
nected in previous stages. We call these reads auxiliary reads, which are
deﬁned as follows.

First, one or more k-mers with normal frequency are extracted from
both reads in an unconnected read pair. Then all the reads containing
these k-mers are recalled. These reads are the auxiliary reads for validat-
ing a possible overlap of the read pair in concern. More speciﬁcally, we
require that all recalled reads to be concordant with the overlap, or the
read pair will remain unconnected. Mismatches between the ends of both
reads were solved as in the previous stage.

Lastly, for the overlapping region, we assign quality values to the bases
as follow. For a mismatch, we assign the base quality of the selected allele
to the nucleotide. For a match, we assign the smaller quality value to the
nucleotide.

3 RESULTS

We tested the efﬁcacy of COPE using both simulated and real
data and illustrated our advantages by comparing to FLASH
(Magoc and Salzberg, 2011), one of the most recently published
utility to join pair-end reads, for correctness and sensitivity. We
also demonstrated that COPE outperforms FLASH in terms of
both length and base accuracy using the dataset published with
FLASH.

3.1 Connection of simulated data

We simulated 30-fold 100 bp pair-end reads with an insert dis-
tance of 180 bp and a standard deviation of 9bp from
Arabidopsis thaliana. The imbalanced error distribution proﬁle
along the Illumina reads was derived by pIRS (Hu et al., 2012)
from a set of human genome reads WVang et al., 2008) sequenced
by Illumina HiSeq 2000 (downloaded from http://yh.genomics.
org.cn). In the simulated data, 0.9% of pair-end reads had an
actual insert distance 2200 and were unable to be connected,
whereas 11% had a 3’ end overlapped with <10 bp. The simulated
data are available to the public together with the source code.
COPE was designed to fully utilize all sequenced pair-end
reads with an overlap, no matter whether the overlapped
region is only lbp or as long as a read. Thus, we do not need

to set a minimum overlap length. In contrast, FLASH requires a
minimum overlap of 10 bp. Both COPE and FLASH were set to
allow at most 25% of bases in the overlapping region to be
mismatches. The results for COPE and FLASH for simulated
reads with error rates ranging from 0 to 3% are shown in
Table 1. Notably, in the previous study, FLASH considered a
connection as correct as long as the overlap is correct, even if the
wrong base is selected as the consensus base at one of the over-
lapping positions (Magoc and Salzberg, 2011). We continue to
use this criterion as ‘Correctly Overlapped’ in Table 1. However,
due to the fact that a single base error will invalidate all k-mers
spanning the bases (as referred to in the ‘Introduction’ to this
article), and that this will in turn out down the effective data
depth and increase the computational resources consumed dras-
tically in assembly, we exploit a more stringent criterion called
‘Authentic Connection’ in Table 1, which requires not only a
correct overlap but also that all bases in the overlapped region
should be selected correctly.

With the ability to connect pair-end reads with an overlap
<10bp, COPE outperforms FLASH with at least 10% more
reads connected when the error rate is <1%, which signiﬁes
the state-of-the-art sequencing quality. In connected reads, rate
of reads that are correctly overlapped is very high for both
COPE and FLASH, with COPE averaging 0.2% higher than
FLASH. When considering the correctness of bases in the over-
lapped region, COPE was better than FLASH with ~1.4—2.2%
higher correctness on low error rates. Notably, with a relatively
higher error rate (3%), COPE can still maintain 93.2% correct-
ness of connected reads, which is ~8% higher than FLASH.

Further investigation into the error connected reads by COPE
shows that there are two possible situations where COPE cannot
reach the right answer: (1) where both reads from a read pair are
perfect polyrun or tandem repeats and (2) where both bases at a
position in an overlapped region are simultaneously wrong due
to a high error rate.

3.2 Connection of real data

To make a direct comparison with FLASH as to how authentic-
ally connected reads affect genome assembly, we used short-read
data from Staphylococcus aureus, a bacteria genome, which was
sequenced by the Broad Institute and used by FLASH for evalu-
ation. The data are available at http://gage.cbcb.umd.edu/data.
They comprise 45-fold 101 bp error corrected [using Quake

(SRA no.: SRX07714) plus 45x 37 bp mate-pair reads with 3.5
kb insert distance (SRX007111). Note that COPE is able to de-
termine the authentic base in an overlapped region using k-mer
frequency when encountering a sequencing error, error correc-
tion will not signiﬁcantly improve the connection quality of
COPE, but it would be essential to FLASH.

COPE successfully connected 79.2% of read pairs from the
180 bp insert distance library, which is over a quarter higher
than FLASH (52.6%). Unconnected reads were used as
normal pair-end reads with 180 bp insert distance for assembly.
Original reads, reads connected by FLASH and COPE were
assembled by SOAPdenovo, respectively, using the same param-
eters with k-mer length of 31 bp.

As shown in Table 2, using COPE-connected reads, the contig
N50 is over two times longer than FLASH and two orders of
magnitude longer than original reads. The number of mis-
matches and indels using COPE reads is lower than those of
FLASH and Original, this may be due to the reason that
FLASH has inauthentically connected some reads and in turn
introduced errors to the assembly.

To evaluate the mismatch rate of the assembly, we used LAST
(Kielbasa et al., 2011) to compare all contigs to the reference
genome. Noteworthily, with a much higher base accuracy at
overlapped regions, the mismatch rate of COPE is ~2.6 times
lower than FLASH. On the other hand, the mismatch rate of
FLASH is about twice that of using the original reads, this can
be explained by its arbitrary selection of discordinate bases in
overlapped regions.

3.3 Selecting larger k-mer for genome assembly

The quality of genome assembled by de Bruijn graph-based as-
semblers largely depends on the length of k-mer used. The longer
the k-mer used, the greater the number of repetitive sequences
that can be resolved. However, with a constant read length, using
a longer k-mer will drastically decrease the effective depth of k-
mer. The depth of k-mer is calculated using formula (2).

dkmer = dbase X (L _ K+  

Note: d is depth, L and K is the length of read and k-mer,
respectively.

To obtain a reasonable genome assembly, higher k-mer depth
is recommended to avoid insufﬁcient transition between adjacent
k-mers (Li et al., 2012), a depth <20-fold may result in insufﬁ-
cient transition between adjacent k-mers, especially when the

sequencing error is high. The relationship between k-mer
depth, k-mer length and read length is shown in Table 3.

As shown in Table 3, when using 91-mer, 100 bp pair-end
reads, they only provide a 3-fold effective k-mer while 180 bp
connected reads can still provide 15-fold. To test the perform-
ance of different length of reads and k-mers, we assembled
30-fold error free pair-end reads from A.thaliana with a k-mer
length range from 47 to 81, using both original and overlapped
reads. The results are shown in Table 4.

COPE-connected reads show its potential to increase Contig
N50 and N90 with both short and long k-mer. When using
81-mer, the Contig N50 using original reads signiﬁcantly
dropped to an unacceptable level due to the effective k-mer
depth being only 6-fold in this case. However, the improvement
is tremendous for overlapped reads when using 81-mer, which is
almost twice the contig N50 length of 47-mer.

3.4 Time requirements

COPE runs in two steps. The ﬁrst step is building a k-mer fre-
quency table. This step is multi-threaded and requires 16 GB
memory constantly using k-mer size 17. The second step is con-
necting reads. This step can be parallelized in per lane granularity
without extra memory consumption. We ran both COPE and
FLASH with 30x 100 bp pair-end reads from A.thaliana on a
quad-core Intel i7 3.06GHz desktop computer with 24 GB of
memory. Run times are summarized in Table 5.

As shown in Table 5, the running time of COPE is about
double that of FLASH, but still acceptable. The longer running
time is due to the computation required to determine the con-
nection based on k-mer frequency information. The memory

consumption of COPE mainly depends on the k—mer frequency
table and is independent of the depth of sequencing. We set k to
17, so it requires ~4 GB memory and the memory consumption
is similar even if we increase the depth of sequencing.

The overall running time for COPE is linearly proportional to
the read length multiplied by the number of reads. Bad sequen-
cing quality may also increase the running time proportionally.

4 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In order to obtain a more comprehensive genome assembly, the
bioinformatics community is always willing to adopt longer
reads without increasing sequencing costs. Several attempts
have been made to make use of the new type of library to gen-
erate longer reads but older methods have failed to maintain
correctness and sensitivity simultaneously. To tackle the prob-
lem, we developed COPE, an accurate tool to make the max-
imum use of overlapped pair-end reads. As shown in our
experiments, highly accurate overlapped reads can drastically
improve the quality of genome assembly.

Besides assembly, overlapped reads can also be used for rese-
quencing. Longer reads will enable the discovery of larger indels
using the split-read method and also facilitate single-nucleotide
polymorphism discovery in mutation concentrated regions like
rearrangement hotspots. The use of longer overlapped reads in
RNA-seq experiments will allow more precise splicing junctions
and expression levels to be deﬁned.

Due to the limitation of read length, COPE may fail to deal
with read pairs from repetitive genome patterns longer than the
insert size if the overlapping region is ﬁlled with tandem repeats
or excessive amount of errors. In the future, we may incorporate

longer reads from other sequencing platform (for example,
Roche 454 F LX+) to facilitate the connection.

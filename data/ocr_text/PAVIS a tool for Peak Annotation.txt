ABSTRACT

Summary: We introduce a web-based tool, Beak Annotation and
Eualization (PAVIS), for annotating and visualizing ChlP-seq peak
data. PAVIS is designed with non-bioinformaticians in mind and pre-
sents a straightforward user interface to facilitate biological interpret-
ation of ChlP-seq peak or other genomic enrichment data. PAVIS,
through association with annotation, provides relevant genomic con-
text for each peak, such as peak location relative to genomic features
including transcription start site, intron, exon or 5//3/-untranslated
region. PAVIS reports the relative enrichment P-values of peaks in
these functionally distinct categories, and provides a summary plot
of the relative proportion of peaks in each category. PAVIS, unlike
many other resources, provides a peak-oriented annotation and visu-
alization system, allowing dynamic visualization of tens to hundreds of
loci from one or more ChlP-seq experiments, simultaneously. PAVIS
enables rapid, and easy examination and cross-comparison of the
genomic context and potential functions of the underlying genomic
elements, thus supporting downstream hypothesis generation.

1 INTRODUCTION

The advance of sequencing technology and its exponential
declining cost have made it possible to conduct many genome-
wide studies to understand complex biological processes such as
gene regulation, epigenomic changes and chromatin remodeling.
These studies have generated a large number of ChIP—seq data-
sets that are subsequently parsed by peak calling programs
(Salmon-Divon et al., 2010) to report statistically signiﬁcant
peaks. For a genome-wide study, the number of signiﬁcant
peaks can be tens to hundreds of thousands. The biological rele-
vance of a ChIP-seq peak and the functions of its underlying

DNA element are often dependent on its position relative to
nearby genes or other functional elements. It can be a challenging
and time-consuming task to examine all peaks, and to develop
meaningful biological interpretations of their functional rele-
vance. Motivated by this challenge, we developed the PAVIS
tool to facilitate data comparison, interpretation and hypothesis
generation from ChIP-seq peak data.

There are several existing software tools that can be used for
annotation and visualization of ChIP-seq peaks, e. g. CisGenome
(Ji et al., 2008) and PeakAnalyzer/PeakAnnotator (Salmon-
Divon et al., 2010). All of these tools are useful for ChIP-seq
peak data analysis and interpretation, but they each have limi-
tations. PeakAnalyzer/PeakAnnotator is a highly efficient tool
with utilities not only for functional annotation of peaks, but
also for sequence extraction supporting motif analysis.
However, it does not provide peak visualization capability.
CisGenome provides capabilities similar to PeakAnalyzer.
CisGenome, however, does not support the annotation of
many existing ChIP—seq peak files including many of those
from the ENCODE project (Thomas et al., 2007). Both the
UCSC genome browser (Kent at al., 2002) and the Integrative
Genomics Viewer (Thorvaldsdottir et al., 2012) are powerful
tools and have more capabilities, displaying multiple relevant
data in different tracks. Their visualization capabilities, however,
are designed to display maximal information for a single genomic
region one at a time. As a complimentary tool, PAVIS is de-
signed to display multiple loci simultaneously with each locus
linked to the UCSC browser for additional information.
Furthermore, PAVIS can be used to annotate ChIP—seq peaks
in the context of nearby gene features.

2 FEATURES AND METHODS

PAVIS is designed and developed for ease of use for biologists or
bench scientists. PAVIS’ back-end engine was written in Python
for ease of maintenance and its web-based interface and visual-
ization explorer were implemented with HTML5 and Ajax
J avaScript codes. PAVIS currently supports genomic annotation
of several species including human, mouse, rat, worm and yeast.
All genomic annotation data and alignment data were from the
UCSC genome browser. PAVIS offers two primary functions:
peak data annotation and peak visualization within relevant
genomic context.

PAVIS takes as the input the peak location data generated
by peak-calling tools, e.g. MACS (Zhang et al., 2008), or
other more general ChIP-seq data analysis tool, e.g. EpiCenter

(Huang et al., 2011). The default format of input peak data files
is the UCSC BED format. PAVIS also supports the GFF3
format, and can use peak data files from most ChIP-seq data
analysis tools. PAVIS offers two user interfaces for query data:
clear and intuitive. The clear interface is the default interface, and
is more concise and clear but offers fewer options. The intuitive
interface affords a more detailed explanation of each query field,
and provides additional query options such as sequence conser-
vation annotation and the output data file format (e. g. MS Excel
format). A query peak file, the file to be annotated in genetic
feature context, is loaded through either the clear or intuitive
interface. As an option, this query peak file can be compared
with up to five other peak files.

2.2 Peak annotation

Annotation of query peaks includes identification of the closest
gene to each peak and its relative location: upstream of transcrip-
tion start site (TSS), intron, exon, 5’/3’-untranslated region or
downstream of transcription termination site (TTS). When there
are multiple nearby genes for a peak, the peak is associated with
the genes whose TSS is the closest to the peak if the peak is
within the gene region, if not, the peak is associated with the
genes with the closest TSS unless the peak is closer to the TTS
of another gene. As a part of the annotation, PAVIS can also
compute the sequence conservation score of each peak region.
PAVIS annotation report provides summary statistics such as
the number of annotated peaks and relative enrichment level in
each genomic feature category (see Supplementary Material for
the enrichment test). The report also provides download links of
annotated data and displays the relative proportion of peaks in
each category (Fig. 1).

2.3 Peak visualization

PAVIS’ visualization interface ‘Visual Locus Explorer’ is
launched directly from the PAVIS annotation report. The inter-
face consists of three components: the control panel, the peak
density view panel and the peak visualization panel consisting of
multiple display windows (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs. 2—4).
Using peak-oriented visualization, PAVIS can simultaneously
display multiple peaks with their relevant genomic context in
their respective windows. The query peak is automatically cen-
tered in its respective display window, which can be zoomed in or
out independent of other display windows.

PAVIS graphically displays peak-relevant genomic context
including genes, exons, intron, TSS, TTS and transcription
direction of genes in flanking genomic regions. The zooming
function enables users to get a compact view of genomic context
in the large surrounding region or to take a detailed close look at
the nearby region of a peak. Each display window has its own
reset button that can quickly bring back the display region to the
default 20 kb region after zooming in/out operation. PAVIS also
supports the mouseover function to display relevant information
such as gene names, peak ID and peak width. Furthermore,
PAVIS supports the integration of the UCSC browser, allowing
viewing the genomic region of the current window in the UCSC
browser.

By default, PAVIS shows the first 50 peaks (all peaks if <50) in
the selected chromosome, and displays peaks in overlapping style

navigation control panel with the legend indicating colors for query and
comparison peaks. In the middle is the density overview bar of all query
peaks on the chromosome, where the red line segment indicates the dis-
played peaks location. At the bottom are two display windows showing
query peaks #177 and #178 and their comparison peaks, respectively

by assigning a unique color to each peak dataset. The query
peak is always assigned green and other color assignment
shown by the legend on the control panel. PAVIS offers options
in the control panel to change the chromosome and the range
interactively, to use non-overlapping style view of peaks and to
navigate peaks in either the chromosome-wide or within-region
mode.

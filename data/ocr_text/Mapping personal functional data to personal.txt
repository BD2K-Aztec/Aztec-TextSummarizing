ABSTRACT

Motivation: The sequencing of personal genomes enabled analysis
of variation in transcription factor (TF) binding, chromatin structure
and gene expression and indicated how they contribute to
phenotypic variation. It is hypothesized that using the reference
genome for mapping ChlP-seq or RNA-seq reads may introduce
errors, especially at polymorphic genomic regions.

Results: We developed a Personal Genome Editor (perEditor)
that changes the reference human genome (NCBI36/hg18) into
an individual genome, taking into account single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions, copy number
variation, and chromosomal rearrangements. perEditor outputs two
alleles (maternal, paternal) of the individual genome that is ready for
mapping ChlP-seq and RNA-seq reads, and enabling the analyses
of allele specific binding, chromatin structure and gene expression.
Availability: perEditor is available at http://biocomp.bioen.uiuc.edu/

Personal genomics does not stop at obtaining genetic variation.
One of the next steps is to analyze the functional consequences
of the genetic variation. To enable researchers at large to analyze
the functions of individual genomes, large—scale personal genome
projects including the 1000 Genomes Project (The 1000 Genomes
Project Consortium, 2010), the Personal Genome Project (Lunshof
et al., 2010) and the cancer genome projects (Pleasance et al., 2009,
2010) all provided cells lines from the sequenced individuals. Based
on these personal cell lines and their genome sequences, people
have started to analyze the variation in transcription factor (TF)
binding (Kasowski et al., 2010), chromatin structure (McDaniell
et al., 2010) and gene expression (Li et al., 2011) and started
to study the association between these molecular—level functional
variations and phenotypic variations. In addition, these cell lines
and genomic sequences also made it possible to analyze allele—
speciﬁc epigenetic modiﬁcations and gene expression (Turan et al.,
2010). These resources and growing research areas require dedicated
analysis tools.

One way to analyze individual differences is to map
personal data, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed
by sequencing (ChIP—seq) data, onto the human reference genome
and then compare the TF binding intensities across individuals.
It is hypothesized that using the reference genome for mapping

ChIP—seq or RNA—seq reads may introduce errors (McDaniell et al.,
2010), especially at polymorphic genomic regions. After all, the
polymorphic regions are most likely to exhibit functional variation.

We developed a Personal Genome Editor (perEditor:
http://biocomp.bioen.uiuc.edu/perEditor) that changes the reference
human genome (autosomal, sex and mitochondrial chromosomes,
build NCBI36/hg18) into an individual genome, taking into account
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions
(indels), copy number variation and chromosomal rearrangement.
perEditor takes the reference genome in Fasta format and the
individual’s differences from the reference genome in Variant Call
Format (VCF) as inputs. For each difference described in the VCF
ﬁle, perEditor makes a corresponding change to the reference
genome. When the allele information is present in the VCF ﬁle,
perEditor will keep two genome sequences, representing the two
alleles, and make allele—speciﬁc changes. After all the data in the
VCF ﬁle are processed, perEditor outputs the maternal and paternal
alleles of the individual genome as Fasta ﬁles, ready for mapping
ChIP—seq, RNA—seq and other sequence reads.

We quantiﬁed the difference in mapping ChIP—seq reads against
the reference genome and the individual genome and compared
this difference to reported inter—individual differences. Using
perEditor and data from the 1000 Genomes Project (The 1000
Genomes Project Consortium, 2010; April 2009 data release,
ftp://ftp. 1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/2009_04/), we
constructed the two alleles of a European individual (GM10847,
accession number NA10847) and an African individual (GM18505,
accession number NA18505). We re—analyzed ChIP—seq reads
of NFKB generated from these individuals (Kasowski et al.,
2010) by mapping them to each allele of their individual genome
(output of perEditor) as well as to the reference genome (hg18,
including autosomal, sex and mitochondrial chromosomes). A total
of 55 232610 raw ChIP—seq reads for the European individual
and 64 291 100 raw reads for the African individual were mapped,
using the Bowtie program (Langmead et al., 2009) with default
parameters and allowing for up to 1 mismatch. When the individual
genome was used, more reads became alignable. Taking the
maternal allele of GM10847 as an example, a total of 161150
reads that could not be uniquely aligned to the reference genome
could be uniquely aligned; 84.9% of these newly alignable reads
overlap with maternal or homozygous SNPs of GM10847. The
other 15.1% newly alignable reads were added because a SNP on
GM10847 helped to resolve the uniqueness of a read alignment
elsewhere. Importantly, 47 825 of the newly alignable reads are
located in putative NFKB binding sites (deﬁned as 200 bp windows
with 10 or more alignable reads). In contrast, a much smaller
number of reads aligned to the reference genome become not

ChIP-seq data from a European and an African individual were aligned to human
reference genome (autosomal, sex and mitochondrial chromosomes, build hg18) and
to each allele (maternal, paternal) of their own genomes (GM10847 and GM18505).
Differences of aligned reads on putative binding sites are listed in this table. Putative
binding sites are loosely deﬁned as 200 bp long windows with 10 or more overlapping
ChIP-seq reads. New alignment: a read aligned to an allele on the individual genome
that cannot be aligned to hg18. Lost alignment: a read aligned to hg18 that cannot be
aligned to the speciﬁc allele of the individual genome. For both individuals, there are 2
to 3 times more new alignments than lost alignments. These changes of aligned reads
on putative binding sites could inﬂuence our understanding of individual variations.

uniquely alignable to the individual genome (Lost alignments,
Table 1). Compared with the new alignments, smaller fractions
(40—72%) of the lost alignments overlapped with SNPs. These
SNP—overlapping reads became not alignable primarily because
they had 1 mismatch to the reference genome and had 2 or more
mismatches (beyond the threshold) to the particular allele of the
personal genome. The rest 28—60% of lost alignments were due to
the result that they became not uniquely alignable to the particular
allele of the individual’s genome (a polymorphism elsewhere
produced an identical sequence). These data indicate that mapping
to the individual genome may increase the precision of quantifying
the binding intensities using ChIP—seq reads, which is essential to
explain individual variation (Figs 1 and 2).

Next, we asked how strongly the genomes used for mapping
would affect our understanding of individual variation. The
difference in reads alignable to an individual genome and to the
reference genome was calculated for each 200 bp window covering
the whole genome. We focused on the windows with 10 or more
ChIP—seq reads for further analysis, because these regions are more
likely to be binding sites (Table 2). Taking the maternal allele
of GM10847 as an example, a total of 1356 windows (putative
binding sites) showed a difference of 5 or more alignable reads. In
terms of relative changes between individual and reference genomes
(absolute difference of alignable reads divided by the maximum
alienable reads), a total of 3794 windows showed 10% or larger
changes, and 852 windows showed very strong (50% or larger)
changes (Fig. 1). These data indicate the precision of inferred
binding intensity can be increased by 10% or more on thousands
of binding sites. This improvement is on the same scale as reported
individual variation of NFKB binding (comparing ChIP—seq data
of two individuals by using human reference genome hg18 for
mapping) (Kasowski et al., 2010).

Fig. 1. Relative difference of ChIP—seq reads alignable to individual
genome and reference genome. Such relative differences were designed to
approximate the differences of estimated binding intensities. For each 200 bp
window on the genome, the number of alignable reads to the individual
genome (05) was compared to that aligned to the reference genome (6),
by taking the relative difference |oz—ﬁ|/max(oz,ﬁ). The distribution of the
windows with 10 or more reads (max(oz,ﬁ) Z 10) with respect to their relative
differences is drawn as a histogram. m, maternal allele. Red bars: or > 6, blue

Fig. 2. An example of the genome differences and the allele differences.
The NFKB ChIP—seq reads were mapped to the two alleles of the GM10847
genome (green and red tracks), as well as to the human reference genome
(hg18, orange track). The height of colored bars represents the number of
overlapping ChIP—seq reads on that genomic location. A strong peak was
observed (19 overlapping ChIP—seq reads) in the second promoter of the
TBX5 gene on the paternal allele of GM10847, overlapping with two of her
heterozygous SNPs. This peak does not show up in her maternal allele or in
the reference genome.

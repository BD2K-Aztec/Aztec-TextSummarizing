Abstract

Summary: Diffusion maps are a spectral method for non—linear dimension reduction and have re—
cently been adapted for the visualization of single—cell expression data. Here we present destiny, an
efficient R implementation of the diffusion map algorithm. Our package includes a single—cell spe—
cific noise model allowing for missing and censored values. In contrast to previous implementa—
tions, we further present an efficient nearest—neighbour approximation that allows for the process—
ing of hundreds of thousands of cells and a functionality for projecting new data on existing
diffusion maps. We exemplarin apply destinyto a recent time—resolved mass cytometry dataset of
cellular reprogramming.

Availability and implementation: destiny is an open—source R/Bioconductor package
"bioconductor.org/packages/destiny" also available at \MMN.helmholtz—muenchen.de/icb/destiny.

 

A detailed vignette describing functions and workflows is provided with the package.

1 Introduction

Recent technological advances allow for the profiling of individual
cells, using methods such as single—cell RNA-seq, single-cell RT
qPCR or cyTOF (Roditi et 61]., 2015). These techniques have been
used successfully to study stem cell differentiation with time-
resolved single—cell experiments, where individual cells are collected
at different absolute times within the differentiation process and
profiled. While differentiation is a smooth but nonlinear process
(Buettner and Theis, 2012; Haghverdi et 61]., 2015) involving con—
tinuous changes of the overall transcriptional state, standard meth—
ods for visualizing such data are either based on linear methods such
as Principal Component Analysis (see Supplementary Fig. 81) and
Independent Components Analysis or they use clustering techniques
not accounting for the smooth nature of the data.

In contrast, diffusion maps—initially designed by Coifman et al.
(2005) for dimensionality reduction in image processing—recover a
distance measure between each pair of data points (cells) in a low di—
mensional space that is based on the transition probability from one
cell to the other through several paths of a random walk. Diffusion
maps are especially suited for analysing single—cell gene expression
data from differentiation experiments (such as time—course experi—
ments) for three reasons. First, they preserve the global relations be—
tween data points. This feature makes it possible to reconstruct
developmental traces by re—ordering the asynchronously differentiat-
ing cells according to their internal differentiation state. Second, the
notion of diffusion distance is robust to noise, which is ubiquitous in
single-cell data. Third, by normalizing for sampling density, diffu-
sion maps become insensitive to the distribution of the data points

(i.e. sampling density), which aids the detection of rare cell
populations.

Here, we present a user friendly R implementation of diffusion
maps including previously proposed adaptations to single cell data
(Haghverdi et al., 2015) as well as novel functionality. The latter in-
cludes approximations allowing for the visualization of large data
sets and the projection of new data on existing maps.

2 Description: the destiny package
2.1 Algorithm

As input, destiny accepts an expression matrix or data structure ex-
tended with annotation columns. Gene expression data should be
pre—processed and normalized using standard workﬂows (see
Supplementary Text Sl) before generating the diffusion map. des-
tiny calculates cell—to—cell transition probabilities based on a
Gaussian kernel with width 0' to create a sparse transition probabil—
ity matrix M. If the user does not specify 0', destiny employs an esti—
mation heuristic to derive this parameter (see Supplementary Text
S2). In contrast to other implementations, destiny allows for the vis—
ualization of hundreds of thousands of cells by only using distances
to the k nearest neighbors of each cell for the estimation of M (see
Supplementary Text S2). Optionally destiny uses an application—
specific noise model for censored and missing values in the dataset
(see Supplementary Fig. S2). An eigendecomposition is performed
on M after density normalization, considering only transition proba—
bilities between different cells. By rotating M, a symmetric adjoint
matrix can be used for a faster and more robust eigendecomposition
(Coifman et al., 2008). The resulting data—structure contains the
eigenvectors with decreasing eigenvalues as numbered diffusion
components, the input parameters and a reference to the data.

2.2 Visualization and projection of new data

This data—structure can be easily plotted and colored using the par—
ameters of provided plot methods. An automatic color legend inte—
grated into R’s palette system facilitates the generation of
publication—quality plots. A further new feature in destiny is the abil—
ity to integrate new experimental data in an already computed diffu—
sion map. destiny provides a projection function to generate the
coordinates for the new data without recalculating the diffusion
map by computing the transition probabilities from new data points
to the existing data points (see Supplementary Text S3).

3 Application

We applied destiny to four single—cell datasets of different size (hun-
dreds to hundreds of thousands of cells) and characteristics (qRT—
PCR, RNA—Seq and mass cytometry, see Supplementary Table S1).
We first estimate the optimal 0' that matches the intrinsic dimension-
ality of the data (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Figs 83A and 84A).
Using a scree plot (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Figs 83B, 84B and
SSA), the relevant diffusion components can be identified. However,
for big datasets as the mass cytometry data from Zunder et al.
(2015) with 256 000 cells and 36 markers, corresponding
Eigenvalues decrease smoothly. Although only a part of the intrinsic
dimensionality can be represented in a 3D plot, the diffusion map re—
veals interesting properties of the reprogramming dynamics (Fig. 1C
and Supplementary Fig. S6). We compared destiny’s performance to
other implementations, including our own in MATLAB (based on
Maggioni code (http://www.math.duke.edu/~mauro/code.html),
published with Haghverdi et al., 2015) and the diffusionMap R

package (Richards, 2014). destiny performs similarly well for small
datasets, while outperforming other implementations for large data-
sets (Supplementary Table Sl).

4 Discussion and conclusion

We present a user—friendly R package of the diffusion map algo-
rithm adapted to single—cell gene expression data and include
new features for efficient handling of large datasets and a projec—
tion functionality for new data. We illustrate the capabilities of
our package by visualizing gene expression data of 250 000 cells
and show that our package is able to reveal continuous state
transitions. Together with an easy to use interface this facilitates
the application of diffusion map as new analysis tool for single—
cell gene expression data.

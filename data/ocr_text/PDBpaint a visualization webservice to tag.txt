ABSTRACT

Summary: Protein features are often displayed along the linear
sequence of amino acids that make up that protein, but in reality
these features occupy a position in the folded protein’s 3D space.
Mapping sequence features to known or predicted protein structures
is useful when trying to deduce the function of those features and
when evaluating sequence or structural predictions. To facilitate this
goal, we developed PDBpaint, a simple tool that displays protein
sequence features gathered from bioinformatics resources on top
of protein structures, which are displayed in an interactive window
(using the Jmol Java viewer). PDBpaint can be used either with
existing protein structures or with novel structures provided by the
user. The current version of PDBpaint allows the visualization of
annotations from Pfam, ARD (detection of HEAT-repeats), UniProt,
TMHMM2.0 and SignalP Users can also add other annotations
manually.

Availability and Implementation: PDBpaint is accessible at
http://cbdm.mdc-berlin.de/~pdbpaint. Code is available from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdbpaint. The website was
implemented in Perl, with all major browsers supported.

1 INTRODUCTION

A protein’s function is tightly dependant on its 3D structure. In
particular, protein features such as catalytic centers, domains and
post—translational modiﬁcations, have a shape in 3D space that
is crucial to understand the function of the protein. However,
in protein databases these features are usually deﬁned by their
locations in linear protein sequences only. It is actually easier to
deﬁne and handle protein annotations in a 1D sequence. Second,
protein sequence data is much more abundant than protein structure
data, which require complex techniques to determine atomic
coordinates. As a result, most protein annotations are mapped to
protein sequences but not to protein structures (Liu et al., 2008).
Nevertheless, tagging available 3D structures with annotations can
be extremely informative. This is used in some web tools and
databases dealing with protein structures [PDB (Rose et al., 2011),
SCOP (Murzin et al., 1995), Dali (Holm and Rosenstrom, 2010)]
or with domain predictions [HHpred (Soding et al., 2005), Pfam
(Finn et al., 2010)]. Typically, users have to obtain a ﬁle with the
atomic coordinates of a protein structure (e.g. in PDB format) and

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

then load it into a molecular graphics display program (O’Donoghue
et al., 2010). Then, to incorporate annotation information users need
to obtain the corresponding protein sequence, have it analyzed by
one or more Webservices and then manually transfer the output of
these tools into the molecular viewer for 3D representation. This
can be time consuming, especially if many sources of annotation
are being used on multiple structures.

To facilitate this procedure, we have developed a web tool,
PDBpaint, designed speciﬁcally to allow loading either existing
structures from the PDB, structure models from MODBASE (Pieper
et al., 2011), or a PDB ﬁle created by the user, for example for a
novel structure or from modeling software [e.g. i—TASSER (Roy
et al., 2010; Zhang, 2008)], and then tag them according to the
user’s preferences.

PDBpaint can compute predicted features from the sequence
extracted from the PDB ﬁle using external services and locally
run methods: protein domains by Pfam (Finn et al., 2010), alpha—
solenoid repeats by ARD (Palidwor et al., 2009), signal peptides
by SignalP (Emanuelsson et al., 2007) and transmembrane alpha—
helices by TMHMM (Krogh et al., 2001). PDBpaint can also
represent features from the protein’s corresponding UniProt entry
(Magrane and Consortium, 2011) that were experimentally or
computationally derived (mapped to the PDB sequence using
sequence alignment to account for possible residue numbering
differences). Manual annotations can be also input for any set of
residues and colors.

The collected sequence features are then mapped and represented
in the PDB structure by a script that calls the molecular graphics
viewer Jmol [http://www.jmol.org/; (Jmol, 2011)]. The structures to
tag are then displayed in an interactive window (Fig. 1).

2 SIMILAR TOOLS

The problem of automating the mapping of features to structures is
almost as old as the molecular graphic programs themselves.

In 1994, Saqi and Sayle already presented a script to map protein
motifs detected with regular expressions on PDB protein structure
(Saqi and Sayle, 1994) using the RasMol viewer. The PDB website
displays secondary structure annotations using Jmol. Standalone
graphical molecular viewers like RasMol (Sayle and Bissell, 1992)
or PyMOL (PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.3,
Schrddinger, LLC) can also do this. Pfam (Finn et al., 2010) allows
the display of Pfam domains of a protein in a dynamic protein 3D
viewer (Jmol) when the protein’s structure is available from the
PDB. Aside from these well—known tools, several small web services
allow to display a variety of features on 3D structures. Motif3D
is an online tool that focuses on displaying protein motifs from

the prints database on structures from the PDB database (Gaulton
and Attwood, 2003). Amino acid conservation of a sequence using
related homologs can be displayed on a 3D structure using ConSurf
(Ashkenazy et al., 2010). Suits of bioinformatics tools such as SRS
3D (O’Donoghue et al., 2004) or UTOPIA (Pettifer et al., 2004) can
be used to display annotations on PDB structures as PDBpaint does;
however, these tools require local installation of software and have
a signiﬁcant learning curve.

3 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

PDBpaint was developed in Perl, and uses a JavaScript to call the
Jmol program. Jmol requires Java 1.5 or greater.

4 CONCLUSION

PDBpaint has been speciﬁcally designed as an easy to use tool for
the tagging of PDB ﬁles with a comprehensive collection of features.

Display of protein features such as Pfam or UniProt directly on the
3D structure help to better understand protein function; these also
allow the user to test the accuracy of predictive methods and see
directly their results on modeled or known structures. Researchers
who have solved or predicted a novel protein structure can upload
their structure and immediately view sequence features predicted
for their protein in the context of the novel structure. In particular,

we believe that PDBpaint will facilitate the use of predicted protein
structures when designing experiments.

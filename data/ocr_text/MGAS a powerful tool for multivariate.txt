Abstract

Motivation: Standard genome—wide association studies, testing the association between one
phenotype and a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are limited in two
ways: (i) traits are often multivariate, and analysis of composite scores entails loss in statistical
power and (ii) gene—based analyses may be preferred, e.g. to decrease the multiple testing
problem.

Results: Here we present a new method, multivariate gene—based association test by extended
Simes procedure (MGAS), that allows gene—based testing of multivariate phenotypes in unrelated
individuals. Through extensive simulation, we show that under most trait—generating genotype—
phenotype models MGAS has superior statistical power to detect associated genes compared with
gene—based analyses of univariate phenotypic composite scores (i.e. GATES, multiple regression),
and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Re—analysis of metabolic data revealed 32 False
Discovery Rate controlled genome—wide significant genes, and 12 regions harboring multiple
genes; of these 44 regions, 30 were not reported in the original analysis.

Conclusion: MGAS allows researchers to conduct their multivariate gene—based analyses effi—
ciently, and without the loss of power that is often associated with an incorrectly specified geno—
type—phenotype models.

Availability and implementation: MGAS is freely available in KGG v3.0 (http://statgenpro.psych

1 Introduction

Standard genome—wide association studies (GWAS) involve the uni—
variate regression of one trait on a large number of genetic variants
(single nucleotide polymorphisms, i.e. SNPs), while adapting the
nominal or criterion level for the extensive multiple testing (typically
at : 5 x 10‘s). This analysis is limited in two important ways. First,
genes, not SNPs, are the functional unit in the genome (Huang et al.,
2011; Li et al., 2011). Although SNPs may have different allele fre—
quencies and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure across human
populations, genic function is highly consistent. Furthermore, analy-
sing genes rather than SNPs decreases the multiple testing problem,
and relaxing the significance threshold in gene—based analyses
improves the statistical power of GWAS studies (Petersen et al.,
2013).

Second, traits of interest are often multivariate in nature, i.e.
multiple phenotypes are measured to cover the full extent of a trait.
For instance, cognitive ability is usually measured through test bat—
teries covering various cognitive abilities (e.g. vocabulary, memory).
Similarly, diagnostic interviews and clinical questionnaires cover a
collection of symptoms to deal with the symptomatic heterogeneity.
In the GWAS context, this multivariate information is generally
reduced to a univariate score, i.e. a univariate full—scale IQ score, or
a binary case—control index. Reducing multivariate to univariate
data nearly always results in loss of information. Specifically,
whether univariate composite scores exhaustively summarize all
information in the multivariate data (i.e. are sufficient statistics)
depends on the true trait—generating genotype—phenotype model, i.e.
the model that describes how the multiple phenotypes and genes
jointly generate the observed trait (Van der Sluis et al., 2010, 2013).
(Specifically, in factor analytic terms, sum scores are only sufficient
statistics if (a) all correlations between the phenotypes are explained
by one latent trait or factor, (b) all phenotypes have identical factor
loadings, (c) all phenotypes have identical residual variances [i.e. the
phenotypes adhere to a so—called Rasch (1980) model], and the
genetic effect is on the latent factor (illustrated in Fig. 1A). In
all other cases, the sum score is not a sufficient statistic and conduct—
ing association analysis on the sum score will result in a considerable
loss in power to detect genetic effects (Van der Sluis et al., 2010).
Noteworthy: the variance—covariance structure of data generated
through a network model may closely mimic the variance—
covariance structure of data generated through a 1—factor model
(Van der Sluis et al., 2013; Van der Maas et al., 2006), implicating
that factor analytic results are not sufficient to determine the true
trait—generating model.) Various simulation studies have shown that
overreliance on the unidimensional trait—generating model, and
the associated use of univariate composite scores, can result in con—
siderable loss of statistical power to detect genetic variants
(Medland and Neale, 2010; Minica et al., 2010; Van der Sluis et al.,
2010,2013)

Gene—based methods for the univariate trait setting are available
(e.g. GATES, VEGAS, JAG, Li et al., 2011; Lips et al., 2012; Liu
et al., 2010; Ruano et al., 2010), as are multivariate methods for the
genome—wide SNP—based setting [e.g. MultiPhen, canonical correla-
tion analysis (CCA), i.e. multivariate analysis of variance
(MANOVA) with the SNP—effect treated as covariate, TATES and
JAMP: Ferreira and Purcell, 2009; O’Reilly et al., 2012; Van der
Sluis et al., 2013; http://ctglab.nl/software/]. However, to date, only
two recently published methods (Basu et al., 2013; Tang and
Ferreira, 2012) incorporates both. In fact, the rapid multivariate
multiple linear regression (RMMLR) method proposed by Basu
et al. is essentially equivalent to the multivariate gene—based CCN

MANOVA proposed by Tang and Ferreira, leaving only one
MANOVA—based method. MANOVA (and thus RMMLR),
however, is known to be powerful specifically if the genetic variant
affects only one or a few of multiple correlated phenotypes, but
power decreases when the variant affects all or many of the
phenotypes (Cole et al., 1994; Medland and Neale, 2010;
Minica et al., 2010). Here, we present a multivariate gene—based
genome—wide analysis tool that is based on an extended Simes
test (Li et al., 2011), MGAS (Multivariate Gene—based Association
test by extended Simes procedure). MGAS combines P—value
information obtained in standard univariate genome—wide
SNP—based association software to arrive at a multivariate gene—
based P—value PMGAS. The standard GWAS can thus be considered
an MGAS preprocessing step. MGAS is implemented in knowledge—
based mining system for genome—wide genetic studies (KGG v3.0), is
freely available (http://statgenpro.psychiatry.hku.hk/limx/kgg/
download.php), and has a user—friendly graphical interface for load-
ing P—value files and genetic and phenotypic correlational informa-
tion, and for visualizing results and annotating sequence variants
and interesting genes.

2 Methods and results

2.1 The MGAS algorithm

Suppose m phenotypes and 11 SNPs located in one gene. Regular
GWAS software [For data including unrelated individuals: e.g.
PLINK, Mach2dat/DSL, SNPtest, Gen/ProbABEL and FaST—LMM
(Purcell et al., 2007; Aulchenko et al., 2007, 2010; Li et al., 2009,
2010; Marchini et al., 2007; Lippert et al., 2011).] tests the m X n
univariate phenotype—SNP associations using a statistically appro—
priate method (e.g. linear or logistic regression depending on the
measurement scale of the phenotypes). MGAS subsequently com—
bines the resulting, ascendingly ordered, P—values p1...pmxn to
obtain one overall, multivariate gene—based P—value PMGAS as
follows:

PMGAS = min  <1)

61'

Here, qe denotes the effective number of independent P—values
within a gene. Whereas the total number of P—values equals m X n,
the effective number is corrected for the fact that the P—values
are dependent, i.e. correlated due to both the correlations between
the phenotypes and the correlations between the SNPs. Parameter
qej denotes the effective number of P—values among the top j
P—values, where j runs from 1 to m X n, and p,- denotes the jth
P—value in the list of ordered P—values. PMGAS is thus the smallest
weighted P—value associated with the null hypothesis that there
are no associations between the m phenotypes and the 11 SNPs
within the gene, and the alternative hypothesis that at least one of
the m phenotypes is associated to at least one of the 11 SNPs in the
gene.

Let [)1 and [)2 denote the P—values associated with the test of the
association between phenotype m1 and SNP 111, and between pheno—
type m2 and SNP 112. The correlation between [)1 and [)2 depends on
the observed correlations between the SNPs rnlnz, and the observed
correlation between the phenotypes rmlmz. An estimate of the effec—
tive number of P—values among the top j P—values, qej, is obtained
through eigenvalue decomposition of the correlation matrix 0)
among the m X n ascendingly ordered P—values. This correlation
matrix is not observed, but can be accurately approximated from
the n x n SNP correlation matrix, Q, and the m x m phenotypic

models. (A) 1-factor model with all SNPS within a gene affecting the latent

and all related phenotypes indirectly. (F) Network model distinguishing four
clusters of phenotypes; all phenotypes are bidirectionally related, with rela-
tions being stronger within, compared with between, clusters, yielding a phe-

correlation matrix, 2 (see Section 2.2 later). Specifically, qej is
calculated as:
i
q.) = i — 21mm,- — 1) (2)
i=1
where j denotes the number of top j P—values, 2,- denotes the ith

eigenvalue, and I(2,~) is an indicator function, which takes on value 0
if 2,3 1 and value 1 if 2,-> 1:

1(2) (“’61 <3)
’_ 1,/1,->1

The effective number of P—values qej is thus calculated as the
observed number of P—values j minus the sum of the difference between
2,- and 1 for those eigenvalues > 1. If all j P—values are uncorrelated (i.e.
if the phenotypes m and/or SNPs 11 involved in the statistical tests giv—
ing rise to the j P—values, are uncorrelated), then all j eigenvalues equal
1, and qej: j — 0 = 1'. Conversely, if the j P—values are perfectly corre—
lated (i.e. if the phenotypes m and the SNPs n are perfectly correlated),

then the first eigenvalue equals 1', all other eigenvalues equal 0, and
qejzj — (j — 1): 1 (i.e. testing the association of perfectly correlated
phenotypes with perfectly correlated SNPs yields only one unique unit
of information). In practice, we expect that qej will generally be smaller
than j but larger than 1, since the phenotypic correlations and the SNP
correlations likely take on values between 0 and |1  Finally, qe is a spe—
cial case of qej, i.e. qe : qej when j = m X n, i.e. when the selection of
P—values j covers all m X n P—values.

It is important to note that as qe is by definition quj, the weighted
p,- is always 2 the unweighted p]. This weighting procedure has three
consequences. First, when all P—values are large (i.e. non-significant
tests), the originally largest P—value can sometimes be selected by the
MGAS procedure as PMGAS, i.e. as the smallest weighted P—value that
is selected as the multivariate gene—based P—value. Because for the larg—
est P—value the weight 616/616,: 1, and 616/616, > 1 for all other P—values,
the largest P—value before weighting can become the smallest P—value
after weighting when all P—values were high to begin with. Second,
because for most P-values qe/qej > 1, weighted P—values can
become > 1, especially when the unweighted P—values are large to begin
with. However, PMGAS cannot exceed 1. Third, the search for the
smallest weighted P—value can stop once qep/qej is 3 pH 1: as the
weight qe/qej is always 21, no subsequent weighted P—values will
be 3 qepj/qej. This rule saves computation time for calculating the effec—
tive number of independent tests.

2.2 Approximation of P—value correlations

The m x n correlation matrix between the P—values is not observed in
practice. Following Li et al., 2011 we used simulation to derive the
mathematical relationship between the observed SNP—correlations Q
and observed phenotypic correlation Z on the one hand, and the corre—
lations between the P—values q) on the other, under the assumption of
no genetic association (i.e. under the null hypothesis). Assuming two
correlated bi—allelic SNPs and two correlated phenotypes, genotype
and phenotype data were simulated for N :4000 subjects for every
combination of allele frequencies (assuming Hardy—Weinberg equili-
brium), LD coefficient r, and phenotypic correlation p. For each LD
coefficient r, the SNP haplotypes were randomly generated by refer—
ence to a categorical distribution. For quantitative phenotypes, pheno—
typic scores were randomly drawn from a bivariate normal

0 p
(Wald test) was used to evaluate the statistical association between

0 1 p
distribution N N < [ ] , [ 1 ]>, and a linear regression model

each phenotype and each SNP. For qualitative phenotypes, the bivari—
ate Bernouilli distribution with correlation p was used to produce pairs
of dichotomous phenotypic scores for each subject, and a logistic
regression model (12 test) was used to evaluate the association between
each phenotype and each SNP. Allele frequencies, 7, and p were
increased from the smallest values to the largest values with steps of
0.05 to generate a series of data points. For each setting, 10 000 data—
sets were generated, yielding 10 000 sets of P—values from which the
correlation between P—values could be estimated. Our simulations then
showed that the correlation matrix of the m X n P—values 0) could be
accurately approximated using a sixth—order polynomial function fea-
turing the Kronecker multiplication of the observed SNP—correlation
matrix Q and observed phenotypic correlation matrix 2, with coeffi-
cient of determination R2 = 0.995:

Neither sample size nor allele frequencies affected the accuracy
of this approximation (see Supplementary Fig. S1).

MGAS as implemented in KGG v3.0 calculates the expected
matrix 0) using the user—provided correlation matrices Z and Q. The
first can be calculated from the raw phenotype data, while the latter
can either be calculated from the actual genotype data or can be
obtained from reference genotype data in HapMap (http://hapmap.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) or the 1000 Genomes Project (http://www.
1000genomes.org/). KGG v3.0 facilitates the building of Q from
both observed and reference data.

2.3 MGAS running time: the divide—and—conquer
algorithm

To speed up computation of PMGAS for a gene with a large number
of SNPs and many phenotypes, we developed a divide—and—conquer
algorithm. The m x n weighted P—values are partitioned into K clus—
ters according to their expected correlations using a cutoff of
620.50. The P—value of each block is calculated by the extended
Simes test (Li et al., 2011), and the SNP determining the blockwise
P—value is marked as the key SNP of that block. The block—wise
P—values are then combined by the same extended Simes test again
to produce the multivariate gene—based P—value PMGAS in which the
correlations between the key SNPs are used to correct for the
dependency of the K block—wise P—values. This algorithm avoids
computationally intensive algebraic operation in large correlation
matrices [e.g. with 20 phenotypes and a gene covering 200 SNPs,
the correlation matrix in the analysis has dimensions
(20 x 200) x (20 x 200)]. Depending on the number of phenotypes
and SNPs per gene, building the genomic correlation matrix and
running the MGAS analysis takes 15min (9 phenotypes and 328
836 SNPs, see empirical example later) to 2hr (20 phenotypes and
2.4 million SNPs) on an ordinary desktop computer with Intel(R)
Core(TM) i7—3770, CPU 3.40 GhZ, RAM 8.00 GB and 64-bit
Windows 7.0 Enterprise 2009.

2.4 Type I error rate and power: simulation
2.4.1 Simulation settings
To examine the Type I error rate and the power of MGAS to detect
associated genes, multivariate genotype—phenotype data were simu—
lated for 2000 unrelated subjects (see Supplementary Information
for details). Phenotype data included 20 standard normally distrib—
uted phenotypes. The covariance structure of the phenotypic data
was either a unidimensional common factor model (Fig. 1A and B),
a 4—common factor model (Fig. 1C and D) or a network model in
which correlations between phenotypes are the result of direct,
mutual relations between the individual phenotypes (Fig. 1E and F;
the relevance of network models for psychological traits like cogni-
tion, depression and personality has been demonstrated; Borsboom
et al., 2011; Cramer et al., 2010, 2012; Van der Maas et al., 2006).
Network data were generated such that the associated phenotypic
covariance structure either mimicked a unidimensional factor model
(i.e. all phenotypes mutually affect each other to a similar extent;
Fig. 1E), or a 4-factor model (i.e. four clusters of phenotypes are
specified; Fig. 1F). Within and between factors or clusters, pheno—
types correlated 0.56 and 0.13, respectively. In these six phenotypic
settings, the effects of all SNPs within a gene were either modeled at
the latent level (Fig. 1A and C), or directly on one specific phenotype
(Fig. 1B—F).

Genetic data included a small gene (10 SNPS) or a larger gene
(60 SNPs, assuming equal coverage) with varying numbers of dis-
ease—susceptibility loci (DSL, i.e. a SNP that is causally related to

Note. DSL: disease susceptibility locus. Roman numerals refer to the power
results in Figure 2A.

aIn latent factor models (Fig. 1A and C), the one DSL affected half of the
phenotypic indicators of a factor positively and the other half negatively. In
unclustered networks (Fig. 1E), the one DSL affected one phenotype posi-
tively and another phenotype in the network negatively. In clustered networks
(Fig. 1F), the one DSL affected either two phenotypes in the same cluster, or
two phenotypes in different clusters, in opposite directions.

bHalf of the DSL in a gene conveyed a positive effect, the others a negative
effect of the same magnitude (Fig. 1A and C) or phenotypes (Fig. 1C—F).

one or more phenotypes), and LD blocks. Table 1 shows an over—
view of all simulation settings (see also Supplementary Tables S1a—e
for a visual representation of the LD structure and a detailed
description of all simulation settings).

In all simulations, the minor allele frequency of all SNPs was
0.2. Within and between LD blocks, LD measure r was set to 0.9
and 0, respectively. The simulated regression weights of DSL were
chosen to account for 0.5% of the phenotypic variance in small gen-
es and 1% in large genes (see Section 2.5 later). Note that in the uni—
variate regression of one phenotype on a DSL, the effect of the DSL
can be larger than simulated when the DSL is in high LD with other
DSL (i.e. the effect is augmented because of the correlation of the
DSL to other DSL in the same LD block: see Supplementary
Information Simulations). Hence, power comparisons should only
be made within each scenario, not between scenarios.

In each scenario, data were analysed in five ways, all yielding a
gene—based P—value. First, the sum score, calculated across all 20
phenotypes, was regressed on all SNPs within a gene, and the
P—values from these univariate tests were submitted to the GATES—
sum procedure. Second, this sum score was submitted to a multiple
regression model, in which all SNPs within a gene were included as
predictors. Third, MANOVA was conducted with all 20 phenotypes
as dependent variables, and all SNPs within a gene as predictors
(Tang and Ferreira, 2012). In both multiple regression and
MANOVA, fixing all predictor effects to zero simultaneously yields
a gene—based test with the number of degrees of freedom equal to
the number of SNPs in a gene. Note that for these simulation set—
tings (i.e. unrelated individuals, no covariates and an additive codo—
minant SNP), MANOVA is equivalent to CCA (Tang and Ferreira,
2012) and the RMMLR method (Basu et al., 2013). Fourth, as vari—
ous studies (e.g. Cole et al., 1994; Medland and Neale, 2010;
Minica et al., 2010; Galesloot et al., 2014) have shown that
MANOVA featuring one predictor (i.e. SNP) has excellent power to
pick up trait—specific effects (i.e. only one of multiple correlated

formed a combination of MANOVA and GATES (i.e. GATES—
MANOVA). That is: given m phenotypes and 11 SNPs, n multivariate
SNP—based MANOVAs with all m phenotypes as dependent varia—
bles and each SNP separately as predictor, produced 11 P—values that
were combined to one multivariate gene—based P—value using
GATES. Finally, all m phenotypes were individually regressed on all
11 SNPs, and the m X n P—values from these univariate tests were sub—
mitted to the MGAS procedure. Importantly, the first two methods
summarize the multivariate phenotypic information into one com—
posite score, while the latter three methods preserve the multivariate
nature of the phenotypic input.

For all six trait-generating genotype—phenotype models, we
simulated and analysed 2000 datasets using the freely available pro—
gram R (R Development Core Team, 2011), and we counted the
number of times that gene—based P—values indicated significance
given or = 0.05.

2.4.2 Simulation results

Type I error rates were correct for all methods in all scenarios
(Supplementary Tables S2—S7 for precise power and Type I error
estimates), bar a small tendency toward inﬂation (~0.063) for
MGAS over multiple simulation runs (not shown) when analysis
concerned a large gene in the clustered network scenario (Fig. 1F),
suggesting that MGAS can be slightly liberal in this scenario. To
study the Type I error rate for smaller or levels, we ran the scenario
illustrated in Figure 1A 100 000 times for a small gene and obtained
values of 0.01017, 0.00134 and 0.00011 for oc=0.01, 0.001 and
0.0001, respectively, suggesting correct Type I error rates for more
stringent oc—levels. In addition, we used real genome—wide genetic
data of N = 4763 subjects from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort
(NFBC1966, Sabatti et al., 2009, see Section 2.6 later), simulated 10
sets of 9 phenotypes, of which the correlational structure mimicked
the observed correlations of the NFBC1966 metabolic phenotypes
(see Supplementary Table S8), and performed 10 whole—genome
multivariate gene—based association analyses using MGAS. These
analyses showed that both small (310 SNPS) and larger (>10 SNPS)
genes had empirical Type I error rates very close to the nominal
alpha bar some stochastic ﬂuctuation (Table 2), suggesting that
MGAS has correct Type I error rate regardless of LD pattern and
gene size. Indeed, qq—plots of the thus obtained MGAS P—values
against a uniform distribution showed no aberrations (see
Supplementary Fig S2).

Power results and Type I error rates for all scenarios are in
Supplementary Tables S2—S7. Figure 2 depicts power results for the
six trait—generating genotype—phenotype models, except for the sce—
narios including multiple opposite—effect DSL from the same LD

opposite effects on phenotypes in different clusters. Specific power results
and Type I error rates for all scenarios are in Supplementary Tables 82—87.
Because MGAS has less power to detect larger genes (see Supplementary
Material), small genes and large genes were simulated to explain 0.5 and 1%
of the variance, respectively. Power results of the five methods are thus not
directly comparable between scenarios (see Supplementary Material)

block (Scenarios 5 and 7 in Table 1) since none of the five methods
had reasonable power (max 9%) to detect these.

As expected (Medland and Neale, 2010; Minica et al., 2010;
Van der Sluis et al., 2010, 2013), the methods that use phenotypic
sum scores rather than the multivariate information (i.e. GATES
and multiple regression, represented in red and orange, respectively)
perform well when the true trait—generating model is a unidimen—
sional factor model with the gene—effect on the latent factor, because
only in that specific case the phenotypic sum score is a sufficient sta—
tistic (Figs 1A and 2A). That the phenotypic sum score is not a suffi—
cient statistic under the other five simulated genotype—phenotype
models is evident from the power results of GATES and multiple

regression: the power to detect DSL—harboring genes hardly ever
exceeds 20%, and is often close to 5% as expected under the null
hypothesis of no genetic signal.

From previous studies (Cole et al., 1994; Galesloot et al., 2014;
Medland and Neale, 2010; Minica et al., 2010) MANOVA is
known to be particularly powerful when one predictor (e.g. SNP)
affects only one of multiple highly correlated phenotypes (Fig. 2B
and D), or when that one predictor affects correlated phenotypes in
opposite directions (scenario X in Fig. 2). Indeed, GATES-
MANOVA has the best power in these scenarios, with MGAS as
second best (MGAS has 0—22% less power, with a median of
—12%). When the gene affects multiple phenotypes simultaneously
(i.e. pleiotropy, Fig. 2A and C), MGAS outperforms GATES—
MANOVA (—1 to 45% more power, median 22%), but when the
genotype—phenotype data have a network structure, MGAS and
GATES-MANOVA perform similarly, except, as expected, when
one DSL affects highly correlated phenotypes oppositely (power dif—
ferences range between —28 and 10%, with a median of 0).

In general, MGAS outperforms all other gene—based methods,
except when the trait—generating genotype—phenotype model is a
with the
factor (Fig. 2A), in which case it is sometimes slightly outperformed
by the GATES procedure (MGAS has —9% less, to 95% more,
power, with a median of 6%). MGAS outperforms MANOVA and
multiple regression considerably in this scenario (compared with
multiple regression: 0—95%, median 12%; compared with
MANOVA: 0—76%, median 52%), and for all other trait-generating

unidimensional factor model gene—effect on the

genotype—phenotype models, MGAS has (much) more power than
GATES-sum, MANOVA and multiple regression (calculated across
all other five genotype—phenotype scenarios; compared with
GATES—sum: 5—94%, median 45 %; compared with multiple regres—
sion: 7—95%, median 45 %; compared with MANOVA: —0.04 to
77%, median 22%). Although MANOVA including all (highly cor-
related) SNPs as predictors often outperforms GATES and multiple
regression, it is always less powerful than MGAS.

Overall, all methods have less power to detect genes harboring
multiple small-effect DSL, unless these are in high LD, in which case
MGAS and GATES—MANOVA show sufficient power.

Yet, none of the currently included methods can pick up genes
with small-effect DSL that are in high LD but show opposite effects
(Scenarios 5 and 7 in Table 1).

2.5 Particulars MGAS

Since MGAS revolves about selection of the best SNP (i.e. the SNP
with the smallest weighted P—value), it is not directly sensitive to
increased numbers of DSL within one gene. We note, however, that
‘indirectly’, MGAS does favor genes with multiple DSL because the
weights qe/qej [see Equations (1) and (2)] generally decrease quickly.
For instance, assuming 10 phenotypes that correlate 0.53 and a gene
harboring 10 SNPS that correlate 0.3, the first four weights equal
88.44, 44.94, 31.04 and 23.70. Assuming oc=0.01, to implicate a
gene with one DSL, that DSL must thus have a P—value<0.01/
88.44 = 0.00011, while to implicate a gene harboring four DSL, the

P—value of the DSL with the weakest signal only needs to be <0.01/
23.70 = 0.0004, i.e. can be approximately four times higher.

At the same time, because the weights qe/qej are based on eigen—
value decomposition, a gene represented by multiple DSL in high
LD can be easier to detect than a gene represented by multiple DSL
(same signal) in low LD. For instance, while the first four weights
qe/qej are 35.66, 19.68, 13.59 and 10.38 when 10 phenotypes corre—
late 0.53 and 10 SNPs correlate 0.9, they equal 88.44, 44.94, 31.04
and 23.70 when the 10 SNPs correlate only 0.3. Assuming the same
number of SNPs representing a gene and DSL with the same effect
size, MGAS thus more easily detects genes with DSL that are part of
an LD block. This is also illustrated by the relatively high power of
MGAS in scenarios V and VI, compared with IV, in Figure 2A—F.
However, adding highly correlated, non—causal SNPs to represent a
gene more comprehensively quickly decreases the power of MGAS
to detect the gene: because j in Equation (2) increases when one adds
SNPs, the weights qe/qej increase, thereby decreasing the probability
that weighted P—values will be below a chosen criterion level or. For
instance, assuming 10 phenotypes correlating 0.5 3 and a gene with
60 SNPs divided over six LD blocks (10 SNPs per block, LD : 0.9
within, and LD=0 between blocks), the first four weights equal
213.94, 115.61, 79.20 and 60.24. If one was to select one SNP per
block such that the gene is represented by six unrelated SNPs, the
weights would drop to 49.85, 27.51, 19.00 and 14.51, respectively.
That is: when adding highly correlated SNPs to the analysis, power
only increases if these SNPs are actually DSL that convey an inde—
pendent association signal. In practice, however, we do not know
which SNPs are such DSL. Therefore, while imputation and
sequencing yield dense genotype files, the power of MGAS (as of
other SNP—based and gene—based tests) to detect associated genes
will generally improve if one uses LD—based pruned data in the
analysis since most SNPs are not DSL [a similar conclusion was
reached for univariate gene—based tests by Petersen et al. (2013),
who showed that inclusion of non—causal intra—genic variants often
dilutes the signal of gene—based tests]. However, as always, the proc—
ess of LD—based pruning implies a trade—off between gaining power
by reducing the number of redundant tests, and losing power by
potential pruning of real genetic signal. Whether P—value based
pruning is suited for procedures like MGAS that are based on
P—value selection, or maybe introduces bias through capitalization
on chance, requires further study.

2.61mplementation: metabolism data

To illustrate the usefulness of MGAS, we re—analysed nine quantita—
tive metabolic traits measured in the population—based NFBC1966
(N: 4763; Sabatti et al., 2009), obtained from the dbGaP database.
Data were available for triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein
(HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), glucose (GLU), insulin
(INS), C—reactive protein (CRP), body mass index (BMI) and systolic
and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), and 328 836 SNPs, whose
genomic positions were retrieved using Sinracker (http://statgen—
pro.psychiatry.hku.hk/lim>dsnptracker). To run MGAS, KGG v3.0
requires a phenotypic correlation matrix and a file containing the P-
values from the statistical association test between each SNP and
each of the nine phenotypes. Phenotypic correlations, corrected for
the covariates used in the original genome—wide analysis, were calcu—
lated from the original phenotype data downloaded from dbGaP
(Supplementary Table S8). To follow the original analyses and
results as closely as possible, we used the original P—value files pro-
vided by the authors and available in dbGaP (i.e. the P—values from
the original 9, PCs and covariates corrected, genome—wide analyses).

Combining these nine P—value files, we had information on 328 836
SNPs, 180 520 of which were located within genes, covering 21 153
genes in total. In KGG v3.0, SNPs were mapped onto genes defined
by the RefGene database with 5 kb boundary extensions on both
sides. When an SNP was located in overlapping regions of multiple
genes, the SNP was assigned to all involved genes. The LD structure
within each gene was determined in KGG v3.0 by reference to the
HapMap LD data (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/downloads/ld_
data/latest/).

To illustrate the added value of a test that is both multivariate
and gene—based, we also conducted multivariate SNP—based analysis
using TATES (Van der Sluis et al., 2013) and univariate gene—based
analysis using GATES (Li et al., 2011) for comparison. TATES
was conducted on the original P—values and thus concerned multi—
variate analysis of the nine continuous metabolic trait measures
(genome-wide significant Bonferroni corrected or: 1.52 X 10_07).
The NFBC1966 data do not contain univariate metabolic syndrome
case/control status scores. Therefore, to conduct the univariate gene—
based method GATES, we created a univariate composite score
reﬂecting the number of endorsed metabolic risk factors using five
standard clinical diagnostic criteria to identify metabolic syndrome
(see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1 8 8 08 3 1/).
These criteria are: TG21.70; HDL males<1.04, HDL females
HDL < 1.30; GLU 2 6.1, BMI Z 25 and blood pressure 2 130/85.
For each participant, we established whether they met the criteria
(yes/no, coded as 1/0) and then calculated the sum of endorsed crite—
ria. This sum, ranging from 0 to 5 (42.9, 32.9, 15.7, 6.7, 1.6 and 0.1
% of the participants met 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 of the criteria, respec—
tively), was then treated as a continuous dependent variable in a
genome—wide analysis that we conducted in PLINK (Purcell et al.,
2007), including, like in the original analyses, sex, use of oral con—
traception, pregnancy status and the first two PCs of a multidimen-
sional scaling analysis as covariates (the first two PCs were used as
covariates by the original authors as a proxy for geographical origin
of the subjects). GATES analyses were also performed on the indi-
vidual risk factors, i.e. the dichotomized variables TG, HDL, GLU,
BMI and blood pressure, and on the nine continuous metabolic
traits separately.

Using an original Benjamini False Discovery Rate (Benjamini
and Hochberg, 1995) controlled genome—wide threshold of
at = 1.80 x 10—04, MGAS identified 32 genome—wide significant
genes and 12 genome—wide significant regions harboring multiple
genes (Supplementary Table S9; qq—plots in Supplementary Figs S3
and S4). Of these 44 regions, 30 were not reported in the original
analysis, but 39 have been identified before in unrelated studies on
the separate metabolic traits according to the Catalog of Published
Genome—wide Association Studies (http://www.genome.gov/gwastu
dies; Supplementary Table S10). Inspection of the univariate
SNP—based P—values underlying the multivariate MGAS P—values
showed that while the top regions (P < 1.0 x 10_07; Table 3) were
only implicated in one of the nine metabolic traits, other regions
showed associations of varying strength to multiple metabolic traits
(e.g. APOB: PMGA521.13 x 10—06, associated to HDL, LDL and
TG; TOMM40/PVRL2: PMGAs = 1.47 x 10—06, associated to LDL,
TG and CRP). Three of the five regions newly identified by MGAS
were previously associated to disorders of which treatment/progno—
sis is known to be related to metabolism (see Supplementary Table
S10). For instance, the region harboring GLT8D1, GNL3,
SNORD19B and SNORD69 (here associated to GLU and LDL) has
been associated to major psychiatric mood disorders (Goes et al.,
2012; McMahon et al., 2010; Sklar et al., 2011), and lipid and glu—
cose abnormalities are reported in a considerable proportion of

patients using atypical or second—generation antipsychotics
(Pramyothin and Khaodhiar, 2010).

MGAS identified more genes compared with the multivariate
SNP—based method TATES (20 genome—wide significant SNPs with
P < 1.52 X 10_07 covering 10 genetic regions: Supplementary Table
S11) and the univariate gene—based method GATES conducted on
the sum of endorsed risk factors (Supplementary Table S12).
GATES analyses based on the nine individual continuous metabolic
phenotypes (Supplementary Table S13), however, yielded results
largely similar to those obtained with MGAS (comparison in
Supplementary Table S14), except that the MGAS P—values are
properly corrected for the phenotypic correlations and multiple
testing.

3 Discussion

We have shown that the new multivariate gene—based method
MGAS has correct Type I error rate and performs well under a vari-
ety of trait—generating genotype—phenotype models. With respect to
power, MGAS often outperforms other gene—based methods that do
not require permutation, like the univariate methods GATES, multi—
ple regression and the multivariate MANOVA [which, with our sim-
ulation settings, is equivalent to CCA (Tang and Ferreira, 2012) and
RMMLR (Basu et al., 2013)].

MGAS, based on P—value information obtained in standard soft—
ware like PLINK, has several important advantages. First, simulta—
neous analysis of phenotypes that have different measurement scales
(e.g. continuous, ordered categorical, dichotomous) is unproble—
matic. Second, standard GWAS software deals with quality control
in a genome—wide setting, covariates and population structure or
stratification. MGAS, subsequently using the P—values resulting
from these specialized packages, benefits from the strengths of such
software. Third, MGAS is relatively fast as the method does not
require permutation. Fourth, for the simulated genotype—phenotype
models, MGAS often proved the most powerful gene—based meth—
ods, especially for the detection of pleiotropic genes (Fig. 1A and C).
Only when the gene affects that part of one specific phenotype
that shows no relation to other phenotypes in the analysis (i.e. gene—
effect on the residual, Fig. 1B and D) is MGAS outperformed
by GATES—MANOVA. As a powerful method, MGAS more easily
detects genes that show relatively weak associations with one or
multiple traits. This was nicely illustrated by our real data example,
in which we identified 30 regions that were not reported in the
original analysis.

It is important to note that, like all other multivariate gene—based
methods included in our simulations, MGAS has difficulty detecting
genes that harbor multiple DSL in high LD, with contrasting effects
(Scenarios 5 and 7 in Supplementary Tables S2—S7). Although con—
trasting effects of SNPs in high LD, located within one gene, may
indeed exist, e.g. as a balancing mechanism, the scope of this sce—
nario, and thus of this shortcoming, is probably limited. Yet, multi—
variate gene—based methods that can detect such contrasting effects
are currently lacking.

We close with some final remarks concerning the practical use of
MGAS. First, MGAS, like TATES, cannot be used to analyse data
collected in multiple, non—overlapping samples (e.g. trait A was
measured in sample I, and trait B in sample II) because the resulting
P—values will not show the expected correlations resulting from both
the phenotypic correlations and the LD structure in the genome.
Also, those P—values might be based on samples of different size,
obtained using variable recruitment strategies, and might originate

diverging analytic choices with respect to data cleaning and inclu—
sions of covariates. Second, KGG v3.0 facilitates estimation of the
genetic correlation matrix from a reference population like
HapMap: actual genotypes of study samples do not need to be avail—
able. However, when the LD structure of the reference population
differs from the LD in the actual study sample, MGAS can be
liberal or conservative: we refer to Li et al. (2011) for an extensive
discussion. Third, the phenotypic correlation matrix used in MGAS
should be corrected for the same covariates that are used in the uni—
variate association analyses that provide the input for MGAS (i.e.
the original phenotypic scores need to be regressed on these cova—
riates and the correlations between the residuals feature as input
for MGAS).

Traits that have to date yielded few results in GWAS are often
believed to be genetically complex, i.e. they involve many genes of
small effect. However, genome—wide studies of complex traits have
so far almost invariably relied on composite scores like sum scores
or case—control dichotomies, thereby assuming the true trait—gener—
ating genotype—phenotype model to be a 1—factor model with the
gene—effects on the factor (Fig. 1A). Our previous (Van der Sluis
et al., 2010, 2013) and current simulations show that the abundance
of null—results in the GWAS literature is not only in line with the
hypothesis that many traits are genetically complex: the difficulty to
identify associated genes could also indicate that the trait—generating
genotype—phenotype model is misspecified. Here we showed that
MGAS, which is exploratory in the sense that it does not require
researchers to commit to one trait-generating genotype—phenotype
model before conducting the association analysis, has excellent
power under various trait—generating models. As such, MGAS
allows researchers to conduct their multivariate gene—based analyses
efficiently, and without the loss of power that is often associated
with an incorrect trait—generating genotype—phenotype model.

Abstract

Summary: Combinatorial assembly of DNA elements is an efficient method for building large-scale
synthetic pathways from standardized, reusable components. These methods are particularly useful
because they enable assembly of multiple DNA fragments in one reaction, at the cost of requiring
that each fragment satisfies design constraints. We developed BIOPARTSBUILDER as a biologist-friendly
web tool to design biological parts that are compatible with DNA combinatorial assembly methods,
such as Golden Gate and related methods. It retrieves biological sequences, enforces compliance
with assembly design standards and provides a fabrication plan for each fragment.

Availability and implementation: BIOPARTSBUILDER is accessible at http://public.biopartsbuilder.org
and an Amazon Web Services image is available from the AWS Market Place (AMI ID: ami-
508acf38). Source code is released under the MIT license, and available for download at https://

1 Introduction

DNA synthesis technologies are improving faster than Moore’s law,
allowing the synthesis of genes, pathways (R0 et al., 2006), bacterial
genomes (Gibson et al., 2010), eukaryotic chromosomes (Annaluru
et al., 2014; Dymond et al., 2011) and eventually entire eukaryotic
genomes. Many projects have individual ‘parts’ as synthetic targets,
such as promoters, coding domains and transcriptional terminators.
While individual parts can be characterized, predicting how parts
will operate together remains a challenge. Rather than building a
single construct, therefore, it can be more efficient to specify mul-
tiple alternatives for each part, then use massively parallel synthesis
and assembly to generate a combinatorial library that can be
screened for the desired function. In particular, Golden Gate assem-
bly is an efficient and effective strategy to assemble combinatorial
libraries (Engler et al., 2009). However, Golden Gate assembly

requires a computationally challenging design step to create ‘stand-
ardized’ parts that have compatible overhangs, lack pre-defined re-
striction sites and comply with other constraints.

To streamline the process of designing standardized biological
parts for Golden Gate assembly, we developed BIOPARTSBUILDER,
which retrieves sequence data from different sources and ensures
compliance with design standards that are compatible with com-
binatorial assembly. Though there are tools for automated parts re-
trieval (Scher et al., 2014) and subsequent primer design for DNA
assembly (Bode et al., 2009; Rouillard et al., 2004), the choices for
Golden Gate assembly are limited. Compared with existing Golden
Gate designers (Hillson et al., 2012), BIOPARTSBUILDER is distributed
open source software and freely modified by both academic and
commercial users. BIOPARTSBUILDER also provides a repository system
that stores the designed parts and shares data within members

associated with the same laboratory. BIOPARTSBUILDER therefore pro-
vides useful, new, integrated and extendable functionality for the
synthetic biology community.

2 Software modules

BIOPARTSBUILDER provides an easy interface to retrieve, design and
order parts (Fig. 1) that are compatible with Golden Gate (Engler et
al., 2009), Bngrick (Anderson et al., 2010) or user-defined assembly
standards.

2.1 Part retrieval

BIOPARTSBUILDER implements a sophisticated sequence retrieval sys-
tem to gather data from different sources. Users can submit a list of
RefSeq protein/nucleotide accession numbers to retrieve sequences
and annotations from NCBI, or for parts without RefSeq accessions
or with customized sequences and annotations, users can upload a
file in FASTA or CSV format. As retrieving a large number of arbi-
trary parts from a genome and upload to the system is tedious,
BIOPARTSBUILDER implements an advanced search engine for retriev-
ing parts from annotated genomes, similar to G ENOMECARVER soft-
ware (Scher et al., 2014). It parses annotations, generates and stores
a search index, and provides access to structured search terms
(Supplementary Tables 51 and 52) through the Apache SOLR query
language.

2.2 Part design

Parts imported into BIOPARTSBUILDER can be re-designed according
to pre-defined or additional user-defined design standards. Users can
customize the design workflow to perform one or more of the fol-
lowing steps.

° Codon optimization: Users can specify host organism for codon
optimization. This option can be left blank for parts that lack
protein—coding regions, such as promoters or terminators. This
step can be amended also to accommodate vendors’-speciﬁc
recoding strategies.

° Restriction enzyme constraints: Combinatorial assembly tech-
niques largely rely on the use of speciﬁc restriction enzymes to
create a unique assembly. For this reason, BIOPARTSBUILDER
provides: (a) RESTRICTION ENZYME REMOVER that changes the
nucleotide sequence to avoid restriction sites corresponding to a
user-speciﬁed list of restriction enzymes; and (b) RESTRICTION
ENZYME LOCATOR that detects the presence of user-speciﬁed
restriction enzymes without recoding the sequence.

° Preﬁx and sufﬁx insertion: Users can specify sequences to be
added to the beginning and the end of each part.

° Fabrication: Parts can be larger that the synthesis capability of com-
mercial providers. In this case, BIOPARTSBUILDER splits the sequence

Fig. 1. BIOPARTSBUILDER provides easy interface to retrieve, design and order
parts. An AutoBuild module is available for one-click design

in fragments of user-deﬁned length using unique overlaps, which
allow unambiguous assembly (see Supplementary Text).

BIOPARTSBUILDER assigns a unique Job ID to each design task. Users
can check the status and error report of design tasks online. When
the design task is finished, BIOPARTSBUILDER sends an email to notify
the user.

2.3 Order

Design results are accessible online. And users can also use the
ORDER module to collect specific designs and prepare files for order-
ing parts from companies. The ORDER module creates statistical
summaries for user-selected designs and provides tables of parts,
constructs and design standards. It generates spreadsheets, sequence
files and summary report files for users to download.

2.4 AutoBuild

To streamline the entire design process, BIOPARTSBUILDER has a fully
automated design module, AUTOBUILD, which allows users to re-
trieve, design and create orders for a batch of parts with one click.
This module serves as a convenient ‘wizard’ for users whose needs
are met by the most common design standards, which are already
defined in the software.

2.5 Data storage and administration

BIOPARTSBUILDER organizes data and users by laboratories. People in
the same laboratory can share parts and designs that remain private
to other laboratories and the public. BIOPARTSBUILDER provides an
administration panel specifically for laboratory administrators to
manage members and design standards. The initial creator of a new
laboratory in BIOPARTSBUILDER automatically becomes the laboratory
administrator.

3 Design workflow example

Using Autobuild it is possible to quickly design both coding and
non-coding parts for Golden Gate using these two workflows.

3.1 Coding region

In the ‘Search Genomes’ tab, input query ‘systematic
name:YBR019C’; select ‘Golden Gate — CDS’ design standard and
assign a name to the Order. Click create parts, then select the part
and confirm your design.

3.2 Non-coding region

In the ‘Search Genomes’ tab, input query ‘systematic
name:YBR019C promoter’; select ‘Golden Gate — NonCDS’ design
standard and assign a name to the Order. Click create parts, then
select the part and confirm your design.

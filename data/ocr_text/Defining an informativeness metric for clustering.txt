ABSTRACT

Motivation: Unsupervised ‘cluster’ analysis is an invaluable tool for
exploratory microarray data analysis, as it organizes the data into
groups of genes or samples in which the elements share common
patterns. Once the data are clustered, finding the optimal number
of informative subgroups within a dataset is a problem that, while
important for understanding the underlying phenotypes, is one for
which there is no robust, widely accepted solution.

Results: To address this problem we developed an ‘informativeness
metric’ based on a simple analysis of variance statistic that identifies
the number of clusters which best separate phenotypic groups. The
performance of the informativeness metric has been tested on both
experimental and simulated datasets, and we contrast these results
with those obtained using alternative methods such as the gap
statistic.

1 INTRODUCTION

Clustering methods were among the ﬁrst methods to be applied to
DNA microarray data (Eisen et al., 1998; Michaels et al., 1998)
and they remain one of the most commonly used techniques in
the analysis of high—dimensional genomic data. The assumption
is that samples sharing similar patterns of expression across large
numbers of genes are members of a particular molecular class
or that genes grouped in clusters are co—regulated across samples
because they belong to a common functional group or pathway.
While these assumptions have proven useful, determining where
a cluster begins and ends, or equivalently, how many gene or
sample clusters are present in a dataset is often arbitrary or treated
as a post—clustering analysis problem. In either case, the lack of
a robust and reliable method can lead to potentially incorrect
conclusions. Underestimating the number of clusters can artiﬁcially

group unrelated elements while overestimating can split related
groups into subgroups that confound further analysis.

Here we focus on the problem of identifying informative
gene expression clusters in experimental datasets resulting from
comparison of multiple biological classes (such as treatment and
control, or different cell types). The question we are trying to address
is very speciﬁc: given a number of distinct phenotypic groups, what
is the optimal cluster number (and membership) such that the clusters
are maximally informative in their ability to distinguish the sample
classes?

Given the history of using clustering approaches in gene
expression analysis and for other applications, it is surprising that
this problem has not been more effectively addressed. Statistical
methods that evaluate the optimal number of clusters within a dataset
exist but are rarely used in a systematic manner and may reﬂect the
fact that there are an array of experimental applications in which
clustering is used as a discovery tool.

Model—based cluster analysis methods assume that the collection
of gene expression proﬁles can be decomposed into subgroups in
which the genes display coordinated patterns of expression. Model—
based approaches use statistical methods to search for the number
of subgroups for which the consensus proﬁles best ﬁt the available
data (McLachlan et al., 2002). For model—based methods, metrics
such as the Akaike Information Criterion (Akaike, 1974) and the
Bayesian Information Criterion (Schwarz, 1978) are both based on
likelihood values and can be used to evaluate how well one model
ﬁts the data relative to another model. While these have been applied
in other domains, in the analysis of microarray data, model selection
can become difﬁcult since there is often no a priori way of knowing
what the structure of the underlying ‘true’ model might be. These
approaches also may require the estimation of a large number of
parameters, and in some cases, the number of samples may not be
sufﬁcient to accurately complete this task. Finally, most model—based
clustering algorithms assume a Gaussian distribution for variation
that may not generally be appropriate for genomic proﬁling data.

For the analysis of microarray data, a number of methods have
been developed for estimating optimal cluster number based on an
assessment of two properties of ‘good’ gene clusters: compactness
and stability. A compact cluster is deﬁned such that the intra—cluster
variability is small relative to the average inter—cluster variability.
Metrics assessing compactness that have been applied to array data
include the gap statistic (Tibshirani et al., 2001), the Silhouette
width (Rousseeuw, 1987), the Dunn index (Dunn, 1974) and the

connectivity score (Handl et al., 2005). A stable cluster on the other
hand, is one that is robust to the removal of a small number of
samples from the dataset. Stable cluster metrics include the average
proportion of non—overlap (APN), the average distance (AD), the
average distance between means (ADM) (Datta and Datta, 2003)
and the ﬁgure of merit (FOM) (Yeung et al., 2001). These too
fundamentally look at the relationship between intra— and inter—
cluster variability. The aim of these metrics is to identify a set
of clusters that individually displays tightly grouped representative
proﬁles, while ﬁnding clusters that are each distinct from the others.

Despite the propagation of methods, none of these has become
established as a defacto solution to the problem of estimating cluster
number. However, this problem is not unique and predates arrays;
in a comparative study of thirty statistical metrics on a variety
of simulated datasets, which concluded that while some metrics
performed adequately some of the time, the best metric to use may
be arbitrarily data dependent (Milligan and Cooper, 1985).

In the analysis of most genomic datasets, the question is generally
less abstract. What we often want to know is whether there are
subsets of genes (in other words, clusters) that are informative
relative to the known classes of samples in our analysis. This is
a question that spans the boundary between unsupervised clustering
and statistical analysis on a gene—by—gene basis since we are
searching for gene groups that share similar proﬁles, and which are
distinct from the proﬁles in other groups, and which have proﬁles
that distinguish the various phenotypic classes being analyzed (such
as treated versus control).

To best use phenotypic class information to our advantage,
we deﬁne our informativeness metric based on simple ANOVA
statistics that come from comparing gene expression proﬁles
between phenotypic groups and which is, therefore, focused
on differences between groups rather than differences within
groups. The informativeness metric satisﬁes properties of both
a compactness metric and a stability metric, since it leverages
the ANOVA framework to detect the number of clusters that
minimizes within—cluster variance but equally requires these proﬁles
to be consistent across the samples collected. Implicit in deﬁning
this metric is the assumption that there are replicate measures
for members within each experimental group and that group
membership is known ahead of time.

Ultimately, the test of any statistical measure is how well
it performs relative to other measures in its ability to produce
a biologically meaningful and relevant result. As a measure
of the ability of our proposed metric to identify functionally
relevant clusters, we compared its performance to eight other
metrics using both simulated and experimental datasets and using
complete linkage agglomerative hierarchical clustering with a
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient—based distance metric as our primary
clustering method.

2 METHODS

Consider a dataset consisting of g genes and n samples, where the samples
are drawn from m classes or experimental groups, and which is partitioned
into a set of p non—overlapping clusters of genes using complete—linkage
clustering (or any other clustering method). We assume that each group has
nk replicate samples for groups k = 1, ...,m and the total number of samples
in the dataset is given by n=ZZ121nk. The number of genes in a single

cluster c is denoted by gc and we assume that every gene appears in one of
the p clusters, g: 21321510

Let Y We represent the expression value of the i—th gene of replicate sample
jfor group k where i=1,...,gc genes; j=1,...,nk replicates; k=1,...,m
groups and c: 1, ..., p clusters.

The mean expression proﬁle for cluster c is given by the n—dimensional
vector,

Yc = (70115  Yon11,c Yolm,c---Yonmm,c) 

where
_ 1 g6
Y.jk,c= —ZYijk,c (2)
gc 1—1

represents the mean expression value for a replicate sample j from group k
that has been averaged over the gc genes in cluster c. Here the dot notation
indicates the index over which the summation takes place. For example,
7.1-1“ represents the value averaged over all genes (as indexed by i) from
i=1 up to the number of genes gc for a particular cluster c.

For each of the p clusters, we then ﬁt an analysis of variance (ANOVA)
model to the mean expression proﬁle of that cluster which estimates the
degree of dependency between the mean expression proﬁle 7.1-1“ and a
covariate that denotes group membership; in other words, we are able to
quantify how much of the variability in 7.1-1“ can be explained by group
membership alone. We call a cluster ‘informative’ if its mean expression
distinguishes the different biological classes or groups as deﬁned by a
statistically signiﬁcant model ﬁt.

Formally, we ﬁt a one—way ﬁxed—effects ANOVA model to the mean
expression proﬁle 7.1-1“ [as deﬁned in (2)] of each cluster c using a single
factor that denotes each sample’s group effect through the model parameter
in“ for k: 1, ...,m groups; a standard representation of the linear model
underlying the ANOVA is represented by the following model equation:

Yojk,c=Mc+Mk,c+8jk,c 
where M represents the overall mean, in“ measures the effect of group k
and 81-1“ represents the random normal residual error term.

The null hypothesis, How : MM 2 112$ = . . . 2 an“, states all group means
are equivalent while the alternative hypothesis, H1 assumes that not all
uk’s are equal or, equivalently, that at least two groups have different mean
expression values.

The mean expression for group k in cluster c is given by

_ 1 "k _
Yuk,c = a ZYojk,c (4)
j=l

which is simply the expression averaged over the genes in cluster c, then
averaged over the nk replicates. Note this is reﬂected by the double dot
notation which indicates the two indices over which the summations occur,
one over the gene index i [from 1 to gc as shown in (2)] and the second over
the replicate index j (from 1 to nk for the k—th group).

The overall mean value represents the average of all m group means in
cluster c,

Yooo,c = _ — — Yijk,C) - 
mk=1 "k j=1 gc i=1
where the triple dots indicate summations over the gene index i (from 1 to
gc genes for cluster c), the replicate index j (from 1 to nk replicates for the
k—th group) and the group index k (from 1 to m groups).
From the ﬁtted model (30 for cluster c, we obtain the MSSC statistic (also
known as the mean treatments sum of squares) which captures the amount
of variation attributed to group—speciﬁc effects:

An informative cluster c will yield a large MSSC statistic relative to
the RSSC statistic. This is because when genuine group structure exists in
the data, this is manifested by observing group means that adopt distinctly
different values. In this situation, the sum of squares calculation in the MSSC
statistic is large whereas the sum of squares calculation in the RSSC statistic
shrinks to zero (Fig. 2).

In calculating the RSSCstatistic, we are always comparing elements of
the mean expression proﬁle back to their respective group means and so the
statistic is not inﬂuenced by the presence of group structure in the data. The
MSSC statistic on the other hand compares the group means to the overall
mean directly (which ignores any group structure) and therefore the more
distinct the group means become, the sum of the deviations from the overall
mean will increase giving rise to a larger MSSC statistic.

We deﬁne two ﬁnal measures that collectively represent how informative
the overall cluster analysis is. These measures are obtained by averaging
the cluster—speciﬁc MSSC and RSSC statistics for the p clusters found in the
dataset:

Given that a single informative cluster c will be associated with a large
MSSC and a small RSSC value then by extension, the overall MSSQ’) and
RSSQ’) values will be large and small respectively, for an informative set
of p clusters. The MSSV’) statistic best captures the size of the group—
speciﬁc effect directly for each of the p clusters and therefore we deﬁne
the informativeness metric to be the MSSV’) statistic deﬁned in (8).

In standard ANOVA analysis, it is more common to focus on the ratio of
the MSS and RSS statistics or equivalently, the F statistic:

_ MSSC
CT RSSC

 

NFk—1,n—k

to assess the signiﬁcance of a ﬁtted model.
For the p clusters generated by the cluster analysis, we can extend the FC
cluster—based statistic and similarly deﬁne F (p) in the following way:

Our results presented for the modiﬁed F statistic are calculated from the F ip )
deﬁnition. Note that there is an alternative way to deﬁne F (p):

1 p 1 m "k — 2 1 P

(11)

In theory, the F —based statistic appears to be potentially useful as a
means to measure informativeness since a large MSSC and small RSSC
will give rise to a large F value. However, based on tests using simulated
datasets, the F —based statistic as deﬁned in (10) was inconsistently incorrect
in estimating the correct number of clusters (see Supplementary Material).
For the experimental dataset, the F —based statistic estimated a set of clusters
which were sub—optimal describing the diversity of expression proﬁles for the
biological classes in this dataset. This can be demonstrated by comparing the
proﬁles in panel A versus B in Figure 3 where the emergence of Cluster 1 in
panel B reveals a cluster that would otherwise have been masked when fewer
numbers of clusters are speciﬁed, as shown in panel A (and Supplementary

Material). Therefore, our tests of the F —based statistics on both simulated and
experimental datasets indicate that these statistics do not perform reliably as
measures of cluster information content.

By clustering the expression dataset, the goal is to reveal underlying sub—
structures that reﬂect the gene sets driving the group—speciﬁc differences
observed. Changing the number of clusters will effectively alter the
resolution at which those substructures can be observed, and the optimal
number of clusters will give rise to a set of clusters that highlight these
group—speciﬁc differences at maximum resolution. Therefore, as the number
of clusters (p) approaches this optimal value, the clusters become more
informative, as reﬂected by an increase in the MSSV’) statistic and a much
smaller Rss<P> statistic. The F<P>—based statistic failed to provide reliable
discriminatory power and a careful analysis of all three collective measures
on both simulated and real data indicate that MSSV’) has the greatest
discriminatory power and consequently, we chose MSSV’) as a measure of
cluster information content—the informativeness metric, coupled with the
simple expectation that an informative set of clusters will be associated with
a much smaller RSS0”) statistic.

To determine the optimal number of clusters using the informativeness
metric, we vary the number of clusters in a cluster analysis over a ﬁnite
range and calculate the informativeness metric for each value within this
space (Fig. 1). The value which maximizes the informativeness metric is
taken to be the optimal number of clusters with the accompanying condition
that the RSSQ’) statistic computed for the p clusters should be much smaller
than the informativeness metric. Instances where the informativeness metric
and the RSSQ’) statistic produce similar values over the interval in which
the number of clusters is altered suggest there is an absence of group
structure (see Supplementary Material). The range over which the number
of clusters (p) is tested can be chosen arbitrarily. In practice, the approach
we have adopted is to set the lower limit of this range to one and the upper
limit is determined by the maximum value of p that gives rise to clusters
that have a minimum number of genes (for example, a minimum of ﬁve
genes).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Evaluation of the informativeness metric

To evaluate the performance of the informativeness metric relative
to other eight other widely used measures (Datta and Datta, 2003;
Dunn, 1974; Rousseeuw, 1987; Tibshirani et al., 2001; Yeung et al.,
2001), we chose to use both simulated and an experimental dataset.
The advantage of a simulated dataset is that it allows us to assess
performance where the number of clusters are known and can be
used as an objective measure of performance while an experimental
dataset provides the opportunity to evaluate whether the results lead
to biologically relevant conclusions.

As noted previously, the clustering algorithm adopted throughout
our analyses was agglomerative hierarchical clustering where
clusters were joined based on complete linkage and the distance
metric used was based on (1 —R) where R is the Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient. Complete linkage was used instead of the more
commonly used average linkage because the former produced a
much more stable clustering. Complete linkage has been shown to
perform better than average linkage for non—ratio based expression
values (Gibbons and Roth, 2002). Since the informativeness metric
simply measures the optimal number of clusters given a particular
clustering algorithm, we chose not to explore the effect of the
clustering method and instead focused only on the ability of cluster
metrics to identify the optimal number of clusters within a given
clustering result.

3.2 Comparison of performance on simulated dataset

We evaluated cluster—number metric performance of three simulated
datasets which had four, six and eight clusters, respectively.

To construct these, we simulated a small gene expression dataset
under a Normal distribution for 300 genes and 100 samples.
For each dataset, the samples were grouped into four sets of 25
representing distinct phenotypic classes on which we had repeated
measures. Supplementary Figures 1, 2 and 3 shows the distinct
expression proﬁles for data representing six, four and eight clusters,
respectively. For each cluster we assume that expression is normally
distributed with a standard deviation held constant at 1.5.

Of the nine metrics analyzed, only the informativeness metric was
successful in correctly estimating the number of clusters for all three
simulated datasets (Table 1). For both the six—cluster and the eight—
cluster datasets, the gap statistic and the informativeness metric
identiﬁed the correct number of clusters. For these two datasets, all
of the other compactness—based methods underestimated the optimal
number of clusters (Table 1). None of the stability—based methods
(APN, AD, ADM and FOM) were able to correctly pick the number
of clusters (half of the methods underestimated this number, the
other half overestimated). Given that the gap statistic is the most
widely used method for determining the optimal number of clusters
in applied statistics, it is interesting that it overestimated the optimal
number of clusters for the four—cluster simulated dataset.

All metrics require the user to specify a ﬁnite range over which
the number of clusters is optimized. For the eight existing metrics
presented in our article, the lower limit of this range permitted was
two, and the upper limit was determined by choosing the maximum
number of clusters that produced clusters with at least ﬁve genes.
The lower limit allowed by our informativeness metric was one, and
we applied the same criterion to determine the upper limit.

We also extended our simulation study to evaluate the
performance of the informativeness metric against the other nine
metrics in the context of (i) a larger number of genes than
samples (2000 genes, 100 samples); (ii) 100 simulated datasets
where the number of clusters is known to be four, six and eight
clusters; (iii) clusters produced by both hierarchical clustering and
k—means clustering; (iv) no clustering structure; (v) a simulated
dataset with unequal sample sizes for each phenotypic group (300
genes, 110 samples with 20, 20, 30, 40 replicates per group);
(vi) a simulated dataset with a larger number of genes and small
number of samples (1800 genes, 40 samples); (vii) unequal variance
between clusters where each cluster in the dataset is simulated
under a different variance parameter; and (viii) unequal variance
within clusters where different genes within each cluster were
simulated under different variance parameters (see Supplementary
Material). In almost all of these simulations, the informativeness
metric accurately estimated the correct number of clusters simulated,
with the only other metric, the gap statistic demonstrating similar
consistent performance, while the remaining metrics performed on

average, quite poorly. In instances where the informativeness metric
failed to estimate the correct number of clusters exactly, it usually
gave the estimate closest to the true parameter, compared to the other
metrics.

3.3 Comparison of performance on experimental
datasets

We then extended our evaluation to an experimental dataset which
studied cell type—speciﬁc gene expression differences in distinct
human stem cell populations (Muller et al., 2008) (NCBI GEO
accession number GSE11508). This dataset surveyed 20 different
cell lines, but to simplify our analyses we limited ourselves to
evaluating the ability of clustering metrics to predict the optimal
number of gene expression clusters between four cell types:
embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells, neural stem cells
and a teratoma—differentiated cell line. We further restricted the
samples to those that had been used on the same Illumina BeadChip
platform (WG—6), giving a total of n = 68 samples, where the number
of samples for each group was 111212, 112231, 113:8, 114: 17,
respectively. We applied a quality ﬁlter which retained a probe only
if it passed a 0.99 detection score in 75% of samples for at least one
of the four cell types. These ﬁltering processes resulted in a total of
11 044 probes.

While it is possible to apply a cluster analysis to all genes in
this dataset, we instead preferred to interpret gene clusters within
the context of literature—supported biological pathways. Therefore,
we used gene sets deﬁned by biological pathways from the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa and
Goto, 2000) and for the purposes of this article, chose to demonstrate
the performance of the informativeness metric on three pathways
which were selected to reﬂect relevant aspects of the biology
associated with the four cell types we have selected from the Muller
dataset. We then applied a cluster analysis method separately to
each of the top three most signiﬁcant and largest KEGG pathways:
the mitogen—activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway
(g=154 genes), the focal adhesion pathway (g=136 genes) and
the regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathway (g = 138 genes). In this
way, for each KEGG pathway, we obtain a ﬁnal set of clusters using
the informativeness metric that describe the distinct repertoire of
expression patterns between cell types supported by the genes that
participate in that pathway. Note that we also tested these metrics
on clusters derived from a more conventional analysis that began by
ﬁltering out genes from the entire dataset and clustering about 2000
genes (Supplementary Material).

Unlike the simulated dataset, here we have no prior knowledge
of what the ‘real’ number of clusters is. If, however, we compare

the gene expression proﬁles across phenotypic groups as a function
of the number of clusters, we can gauge how informative the results
are and whether the optimal number of clusters has been identiﬁed.
The majority of methods estimated the optimal number of clusters
to be two (Table 2) for all three pathways, except the Dunn index,
which estimated the optimal number to be two (MAPK), four (focal
adhesion) and 10 (actin cytoskeleton).

In contrast, the informativeness metric identiﬁed three, four and
ﬁve optimal clusters for the MAPK pathway, focal adhesion pathway
and regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathway, respectively.

The risk with underestimating the optimal number of clusters
is that important features of the data might be hidden. Figure 3A
shows the two clusters, produced by the hierarchical clustering of
the MAPK pathway, that were identiﬁed by all four compactness—
based metrics tested. The predominant patterns observed were genes
that are up—regulated and down—regulated in the neural progenitor
samples relative to the other cell types. When we examine the
three clusters predicted by the informativeness metric, we see that
in addition to the patterns observed in the original two cluster, a
third cluster (cluster 1, Fig. 3B) appears that uniquely highlights
similarities in the expression patterns between the embryonic stem
cells and neural stem cells versus increased expression in the
neural progenitors and the teratoma—differentiated cells. While the
original two clusters highlight the uniqueness of the neural stem cell
niche, the additional cluster revealed by the informativeness metric
identiﬁes an important biological pattern—a shared phenotype of
embryonic stem cells and neural progenitors—that would otherwise
have been masked.

For the focal adhesion pathway, we ﬁnd similar results
(Supplementary Material). When the genes are split into two
clusters, the dominant themes represented are genes up—regulated
or down—regulated in the neural progenitor cells relative to
the other cell types. However, the four gene clusters identiﬁed
using the informativeness metric also identiﬁes patterns of
teratoma—differentiated speciﬁc expression changes (Supplementary
Material, Supplementary Fig. S4B, cluster 3) and embryonic
stem cell—speciﬁc expression changes (Supplementary Material,
Supplementary Fig. S4B, cluster 4). Note that the Dunn index was
also able to identify the same four clusters as the informativeness
metric.

For the regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathway (Supplementary
Material, Supplementary Fig. S5), the two primary clusters found
by most metrics distinguish the progenitor cells from the three
other phenotypic groups. For the additional clusters found using

the informativeness metric and Dunn index, we see two separate
embryonic stem cells and progenitor cells from the neural stem
cells and teratoma—differentiated cells, with genes either up—
regulated (Supplementary Fig. S5B, cluster 2) or down—regulated
(Supplementary Material, Supplementary Fig. S5B, cluster 5) in
the ESC/progenitor cell group. We also see a cluster with a
less easily interpreted expression pattern (Supplementary Material,
Supplementary Fig. S5B, cluster 4). Although this cluster does not
have a clear interpretation in terms of its differential expression
pattern, it may nonetheless capture some of the underlying biology
of the actin cytoskeletal system, which is important to the structural
integrity of the cell types proﬁled by Muller et al. (2008), all of
which have similar cell shapes. Regardless, the identiﬁcation of
two additional and clearly relevant clusters through the use of the
informativeness metric underscores its overall utility.

While we found additional biologically relevant structure by
adding new clusters, there is clearly an upper limit. For the actin
pathway, the Dunn index suggested 10 clusters (compared to
5 as suggested by the informativeness metric). However, having
10 clusters does not provide a set of clusters that are overall
informative (Supplementary Material, Supplementary Fig. S6),
where, for example, clusters 6, 9, 10 are essentially the same proﬁle,
containing genes that are invariant across the phenotypic group.

Unlike the situation in using simulated data, it is difﬁcult to
objectively determine whether the number of gene clusters identiﬁed
by any method captures the underlying biology being explored in
the experiment. The informativeness metric generally identiﬁed a
larger number of clusters than other approaches and in each occasion
these provided additional, relevant discriminating patterns between
the cell types. In the one instance in which additional clusters were
identiﬁed by another method, the Dunn index, these provided no
additional insight into patterns discriminating between cell types.
The evidence here suggests that our informativeness metric strikes
the right balance, and succeeds in teasing out more informative
clusters from the expression data.

4 DISCUSSION

The motivation underlying all clustering methods is to determine
whether the data can be partitioned into useful groups that provide
insight into the relationship between group members, or the
discriminating elements between groups. While identifying clusters
that reﬂect ﬁner substructures may be desirable, there are also
instances where a dataset may have no such underlying structure

and can therefore be described adequately by a single cluster. The
eight metrics that we assessed neglect this possibility and make the
assumption that further substructure is present in the data. While this
may be a valid assumption for situations where the entire dataset is
being clustered, this is rarely the primary focus of cluster analysis
in bioinformatics. Indeed, there are often many other applications
of cluster analysis that involve smaller, more targeted gene lists. In
order to avoid making assumptions that may not be appropriate, at
a minimum the user should be able to test for the presence of any
clustering structure versus none (i.e. whether the optimal number
of clusters is one or more than one) and the eight metrics assessed
lack this ability. In contrast, the informativeness metric can easily
test for the existence of any clustering structure, including a single
group (see Supplementary Material).

Tests on the simulation datasets revealed that only the
informativeness metric was able to correctly uncover the true
clustering structure of the data in every situation. The gap
statistic made only one incorrect estimate, however all four of
the compactness metrics consistently underestimated the correct
number of clusters, and estimates given by the four stability metrics
were scattered above and below the true number of clusters in
the data. Tests on the experimental datasets demonstrated that the
informativeness metric was more accurate in uncovering the number
of clusters that would summarize the data into its most distinct set
of cluster patterns relevant to the cell types being studied. We saw
examples where the other metrics underestimated the number of
optimal clusters, only to ﬁnd that the larger number, as prescribed
by the informativeness metric, sub—divided the data into a greater
number of distinct cluster patterns that highlighted unique properties
of certain cell types. Similarly, we also gave one example of where
the Dunn index estimated a larger number of clusters than the
informativeness metric, and where the cluster proﬁles produced
from the former were not really distinct from each other. Taken
together, both sets of results on experimental and simulated datasets
suggest that the informativeness metric is successful in isolating
the distinct set of cluster proﬁles for replicated data collected for
different experimental groups.

5 CONCLUSION

We provide an alternative way to validate the results of a cluster
analysis that explicitly takes into account the experimental design
which produced the dataset. This validation method is independent
of the method used to generate the clusters. Given the additional
insights into data structure provided by our approach, we hope that
the simplicity of our method will make the integration of cluster
validation approaches a more mainstream part of the cluster analysis
procedure.

6 IMPLEMENTATION

The routines implementing this metric and associated tools for
visualization are freely available as an R package attract and has
been submitted to Bioconductor. We have also uploaded a script

which details the calculations performed as well the data analyzed
in this article, available from http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/pubs/
informativeness.zip. The Bioconductor R package clValid (Datta and
Datta, 2006) contains functions that calculate the six other metrics:
the connectivity score, the Dunn Index, the silhouette width, APN,
AD, ADM and FOM. To our knowledge, the Bioconductor package
SAGx contains the only implementation of the Gap statistic in R.

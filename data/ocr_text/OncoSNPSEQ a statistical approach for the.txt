ABSTRACT

Summary: Recent major cancer genome sequencing studies have
used whole-genome sequencing to detect various types of genomic
variation. However, a number of these studies have continued to rely
on SNP array information to provide additional results for copy number
and loss-of-heterozygosity estimation and assessing tumour purity.
OncoSNP-SEQ is a statistical model-based approach for inferring
copy number profiles directly from high-coverage whole genome
sequencing data that is able to account for unknown tumour purity
and ploidy.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many cancers are characterized by complex structural
rearrangements involving copy number alterations (CNAs)
and/or losses of heterozygosity (LOH) events (Beroukhim
et al., 2010). Genetic abnormalities in speciﬁc regions may be
related to the aggressiveness of a cancer and be associated with
clinical outcomes (Collisson et al., 2012). OncoSNP-SEQ is a
statistical model-based approach for identifying CNAs and
LOH events directly from next-generation sequencing data that
builds on the OncoSNP tool for SNP array analysis Wau et al.,
2010). The statistical model used differs from previous methods
such as BIC-seq 06 et al., 2010), Control-FREEC (Boeva et al.,
2012) and APOLLOH/HMMcopy (Ha et al., 2012) by address-
ing three major issues in the analysis of cancer samples: (i)
normal cell contamination, (ii) intra-tumour heterogeniety and
(iii) polyploidy, within a fully integrated statistical framework for
using both read depth and allele-speciﬁc information in high-
coverage experiments. In the following, we describe the statistical
model and its application to a publicly available normal-cancer
cell line dataset, simulated mixtures and a heterogeneous cancer.

2 METHODS

Assume that the data consists of a pair of allele-speciﬁc read count meas-
urements (ai,b,-) for i: 1, ...,N SNPs. Furthermore, assume that the

sequencing coverage is sufﬁciently high (> 60x) so that it is possible to
approximate the total read counts as a continuous measurement. This
approximation provides beneﬁts in terms of simpliﬁed mathematical
manipulation, ﬂexibility and computational speed. Any necessary pre-
processing to remove GC content and mapability related biases are
assumed to have been applied (see Supplementary Methods).

2.1 Statistical model

The total read count r,- = a,- + b,- is distributed according to a Student
t-distribution with variance A2 and degrees of freedom v:

r,|x,-, u,, uo, A2, 1) ~ Student(mxi,/12, v). (1)

The quantity m, represents the expected read count at a locus, given the
copy number aberration state x, with corresponding normal copy number
cg? and tumour copy number cg),

mx, 2 (uo + Lil-(1 — 710))052)” 1' (1 — “0)(1 _ “DCSQh’

which is formed by contributions from (i) the normal cell population,
0 5 uo <1, (ii) the proportion of tumour cells harbouring the aberration
(1 — uo)(1 — L1,), 0 5 u,- <1 and (iii) the proportion of tumour cells, which
do not have the aberration (1 — uo)u,-. The term h corresponds to the
haploid read coverage.

We model the relative proportion of one of the alternate alleles b, to
the total read count r, using a mixture of a Uniform distribution on (0, r,)
and a Binomial distribution with r,- trials and success probability, 1),, simi-
lar to 01a et al., 2012). The success probability that the b,- reads come
from the B allele is given by

7r(b,-|-) = eUni(0, r,) + (1 — e)Bn(r,-,pzi, xi), (2)

where e corresponds to the proportion of SNPs for which the sequencing
technology gives erroneous results.

For the Binomial distribution, the success probability p2”, is given by
 = ea —13) + (1 — 6);? where

(“o + (1 — uo)ui)B§Z)x, 1' (1 — “0)(1 — “0322),,
(ac + (1 — uo)u.-)c§:? + (1 — uoxl — use?)

And 6 is the probability that any individual read will be erroneous, i.e.
allele b will be misread as allele a and vice-versa, and 327%, xi corres-
pond to the number b alleles for the zl-th normal and tumour genotypes
of the xi-th copy number aberration state. The observation likelihood is
formed by the product of (1) and (2).

The copy number aberration states (x,- e {1, ..., S}) form a discrete-
tirne Markov chain:

 

13:

7r(xi :kl-xi—l  = Ajakagak) E {19 °°°9S}29i: 2: °°°9N9

with transition matrix A and initial state distribution v. The transition
matrix is symmetric with state-independent switching probability p. We
have not used spatial scaling of the transition rates for non-uniform

markers, as the density of the markers is extremely high
(see Supplementary Methods).

2.2 Parameter estimation

It is typical with SNP and aCGH data to use expectation-maximization
or full Bayesian techniques (via Monte Carlo simulations) to estimate
model parameters. In this instance, the sequence lengths and dynamic
range means the iterative application of the forward-backward algorithm
for HMMs is not computationally trivial. As a consequence, we estimate
model parameters off-line. The variance parameter A2 is obtained from
the data using X2 = "171 2:721 (r,- — 1902 where f,- is the ‘smoothed’ version
of the total read counts r using a moving window average. The sequen-
cing error parameters 6 (N 0.01 in our experiments) and e (N 0.01) are
ﬁxed and estimated off-line from the analysis of sequence data obtained
from germ-line samples using SNP genotypes obtained from SNP arrays.
For the haploid read coverage h and normal contamination level uo, we
scan a range of values for both parameters and calculate the log-likeli-
hood p(r, blh, uo) with other parameters ﬁxed. We identify local modes in
the log-likelihood proﬁle and treat each local mode as a potentially plaus-
ible ploidy-purity conﬁguration and report copy number proﬁles for each
conﬁguration (see Supplementary Fig. S2).

2.3 Inference

The sequence of copy number aberrations states is estimated using a
multi-step Viterbi segmentation. A range of values for the transition
rate parameter is selected, p1 < p2 <  < p J. The Viterbi solution
92(1) = arg max),1 p(x(1)|r, b) is obtained conditional on the smallest tran-
sition parameter p1. Then 2(2) is found by conditioning on 921 and the next
transition parameter p2 and so on for j = 3, ..., J (J: 7 for our experi-
ments). The sequence of Viterbi solutions in, ..., fr] provides a multi-
scale representation of the copy number proﬁle with )‘cl containing only
the largest events, whereas )2] incorporates ﬁner scale genomic
aberrations (see Supplementary Fig. S1).

3 RESULTS

OncoSNP-SEQ was used to analyse a publicly available paired
normal-cancer cell line (HCC1187) that was sequenced using
Complete Genomics (Complete Genomics, 2012) for which
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 SNP array data were also available via the
Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia project (Barretina et al., 2012).
A series of simulated normal-cancer mixtures was generated
from the reads of the normal and cancer cell lines in the follow-
ing ratios (T:N): 100:0, 81:19, 68:32, 50:50, 35:65 and 25:75.
Sequence-based copy number calls from OncoSNP—SEQ were
compared with OncoSNP Wau et al., 2010) calls derived from
the Affymetrix SNP data.

Figure 1 shows that OncoSNP—SEQ was able to approximately
estimate the proportion of normal contamination used in the
simulated mixtures and, for mixtures involving <50% normal
contamination, give CNA and LOH proﬁles that are >90% con-
cordant with those derived from the SNP array data. Visual in-
spection of the copy number proﬁles showed that the majority of
copy number estimation differences (for tumour content greater
than 50%) involved small events with a slight bias towards copy
number gains that maybe attributed to the differing resolutions
and dynamic ranges of the platforms (see Supplementary Fig.
S4—S9).

Below 50% tumour content, copy number prediction becomes
more error prone, as different conﬁgurations of normal

contamination and base read depth become compatible with
the data (see Supplementary Fig. S3). For complex genomically
unstable tumours, it is typical to see a number of conﬁgurations
that plausibly ﬁt the data. This arises because of the linearity of
the sequencing data, which produce an invariance in the obser-
vation likelihood. For example, if we halve the haploid read
depth and double the copy number, the observation likelihood
would remain the same. Copy number analysis of complex tu-
mours with high levels of normal contamination should always
be treated with caution.

The ability to detect heterogeneous events was tested using a
sequencing dataset from a recently published study (Schuh, 2012)
of heterogeneous clonal evolution patterns in chronic lympho-
cytic leukemia (CLL) patients. The data consist of samples taken
from the same patient (CLL003) at six different time points
during the evolution of the disease. OncoSNP—SEQ was about
to identify deletion events spanning the ATM gene and charac-
terize the fall in sample fraction harbouring the deletion
(100—50%) at the time point taken in sample CLL003-P1
(see Supplementary Fig. S4).

4 CONCLUSION

OncoSNP—SEQ is a tool for automatic detection of CNAs and
LOH regions using high-coverage (60x and above) whole-
genome sequencing data. High-coverage data allows allele-spe-
ciﬁc information to be utilized, and, in the case of tumour sam-
ples, OncoSNP—SEQ uses this information to evaluate the level of
contamination by normal cells as well as allowing for degrees of
intra-tumour heterogeneity. The formal assessment of the accur-
acy of this latter capability will need to be ascertained using
independent assays, e.g. FISH, in future studies. For polyploid
tumours, OncoSNP—SEQ provides a probabilistic means of eval-
uating different ploidy conﬁgurations. The software is written in
MATLAB, and the source codes are freely available for modiﬁ-
cation, re-engineering or incorporation into genomic analysis
pipelines.

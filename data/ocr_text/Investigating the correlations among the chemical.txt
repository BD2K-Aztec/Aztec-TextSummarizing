ABSTRACT

Motivation: Most of the previous data mining studies based on the
NCl-60 dataset, due to its intrinsic cell-based nature, can hardly
provide insights into the molecular targets for screened compounds.
On the other hand, the abundant information of the compound—
target associations in PubChem can offer extensive experimental
evidence of molecular targets for tested compounds. Therefore, by
taking advantages of the data from both public repositories, one may
investigate the correlations between the bioactivity profiles of small
molecules from the NCl-60 dataset (cellular level) and their patterns
of interactions with relevant protein targets from PubChem (molecular
level) simultaneously.

Results: We investigated a set of 37 small molecules by providing
links among their bioactivity profiles, protein targets and chemical
structures. Hierarchical clustering of compounds was carried out
based on their bioactivity profiles. We found that compounds were
clustered into groups with similar mode of actions, which strongly
correlated with chemical structures. Furthermore, we observed that
compounds similar in bioactivity profiles also shared similar patterns
of interactions with relevant protein targets, especially when chemical
structures were related. The current work presents a new strategy
for combining and data mining the NCl-60 dataset and PubChem.
This analysis shows that bioactivity profile comparison can provide
insights into the mode of actions at the molecular level, thus will
facilitate the knowledge-based discovery of novel compounds with
desired pharmacological properties.

Availability: The bioactivity profiling data and the target annotation
information are publicly available in the PubChem BioAssay database
(ftp://ftp.ncbi.n|m.nih.gov/pubchem/Bioassay/).

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding the mechanism of interaction of small molecules
with their macromolecular targets is critical for drug and chemical
probe development. The innovation of drug has long been
recognized as time—consuming and labor—intensive, costing on

average about $800 million as well as 10—12 years to bring a new
drug to market (DiMasi et al., 2003). Apart from the challenges
in optimizing pharmacokinetic properties and minimizing toxicities
of lead compounds, the lack of publicly available/accessible
biomedical assay data may represent another barrier for the
success of drug discovery. Fortunately, this is changing since
more public resources are emerging, offering new opportunities to
chemical biology researchers for drug development. Open—access,
information—rich resources include the Protein Data Bank (PDB;
Berman et al., 2000), DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2006, 2008) and
KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2004), to name only a few. Without a doubt,
existing public resources, as well as new ones, will evolve in future
with both speed and capacity.

PubChem is a public repository for the chemical structures
of small molecules and information of their biological properties
(Wang et al., 2009, 2010). It was launched as a component of the
NIH Molecular Libraries Roadmap Initiative (Zerhouni, 2003), with
the aim to discover chemical probes Via high—throughput screening
(HTS) of small molecules. It also receives biological property
contributions from many other organizations. As of March 17,
2010, PubChem contains more than 26 million unique compounds,
among which over 870 000 have biological assay data for more
than 3000 molecular targets, including proteins and genes. The
public accessibility to such assay data is particularly valuable to the
community, since this kind of critical information needed by drug
research is typically held by pharmaceutical companies. The public
availability and information—rich features altogether make PubChem
an extremely valuable resource for biomedical research, as well as
data mining studies (Chen and Wild, 2010; Han et al., 2008; Li et al.,
2009; Rohrer and Baumann, 2009; Weis et al., 2008; Xie and Chen,
2008).

Launched by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the
Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) provides in vitro
screening for new anticancer drugs that tested in 60 human tumor
cancer cell lines (often known as the NCI—60 dataset; Shoemaker,
2006). This well—curated, publicly available dataset has been
recognized as a rich resource for studying the mechanism of growth
inhibition for tumor cells (Shoemaker, 2006; Weinstein et al., 1997).
It has also inspired interests for developing and validating data
mining tools (Paull et al., 1989; Zaharevitz et al., 2002). Bioactivity
proﬁles derived from the NCI—60 cell lines can provide insights
into the mode of actions for tested compounds (Rabow et al., 2002;
Shi et al., 1998a, b, 1999; Wallqvist et al., 2003; Weinstein, et al.,
1992). Structure—activity relationships (SARs) studies have also been
reported for predicting or characterizing the cytotoxicity of the

screened compounds in the NCI—60 dataset (Guha, 2008; Lee et al.,
2008; Wang et al., 2007).

However, due to the intrinsic cell—based nature of the NCI—60
dataset, most of the studies described above can hardly provide
insights into the molecular targets for screened compounds. On
the other hand, PubChem has more than 1200 publicly available
HTS bioassays with over 690 deﬁned protein targets (as of March
17, 2010). In addition, the screening laboratories under the NIH
Molecular Libraries Program (MLP) share a common compound
library, i.e. the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository
(MLSMR), which is required to be tested for each assay project if
possible. As a result, the compounds in the MLSMR library are often
tested in hundreds of bioassays with many of them having associated
protein targets. It thus represents a rich resource for constructing
the compound—target interaction network, deriving target proﬁles
and evaluating polypharmacological properties for a large library
of compounds (Chen et al., 2009). Moreover, there is a signiﬁcant
overlap between the MLSMR compound library and those screened
in the NCI—60 cell lines. Therefore, the bioassay data in PubChem
can provide experimental evidence for the interactions between the
compounds in the NCI—60 dataset and their targets.

In this work, we proposed a new strategy for combining
and data mining the NCI—60 dataset and PubChem HTS assays,
and investigated the correlations among the bioactivity proﬁles,
compound—target interaction network and chemical structures
of small molecules. Bioactivity proﬁles were derived from the
screening results contained in the NCI—60 dataset. Compounds
were hierarchically clustered based on their bioactivity proﬁles.
Compound—target interaction networks were constructed using
the annotated bioassay data in PubChem. Strong correlations
were suggested between bioactivity proﬁles and target networks,
especially when chemical structures were related.

2 METHODS

2.1 NCI-60 dataset

The NCI—60 dataset is also available in the PubChem BioAssay database as
73 bioassays with the name of ‘NCI human tumor cell line growth inhibition
assay’ under the ‘NCI/DTP’ data source. In this study, 13 bioassays were
eliminated considering their relatively small number of tested compounds
(less than 16000). The screening data for the remaining 60 bioassays (will
be referred to hereafter as the NCI—60) was downloaded from the PubChem
FTP site (accessed on March 17, 2010). In total, 5083 unique compounds
were compiled and further ﬁltered by the following rules:

(1) Compounds must have been tested in all of the 60 NCI cell lines with a
complete spectrum of log (G150) values, where G150 is the compound
concentration required for 50% inhibition of tumor cell growth. That
is, any compound with missing log (G150) value in one or more of
the NCI—60 cell lines was discarded. 4452 compounds met with this
criterion.

(2

V

Compounds must demonstrate activity in at least one PubChem
bioassay which has a deﬁned protein target. This resulted in an initial
set of 257 compounds with both complete bioactivity proﬁles and
known protein targets.

(3) Compounds must have log (G150) values below —6 for at least 15 out
of the 60 NCI cell lines.

A ﬁnal set of 37 compounds matched all of the above three criteria, and were
analyzed in this study.

2.2 Clustering analysis based on bioactivity proﬁles

End—point activity data from a single cell line may give only limited
information on a compound’s biological response. However, the tested
activities in a broad panel of 60 cell lines (i.e. bioactivity proﬁle) can be
used to characterize the mechanism of drug action, resistance and modulation
(van Osdol at 611., 1994; Weinstein at 611., 1992). In this study, bioactivity
proﬁles were subjected to hierarchical clustering by using the Hierarchical
Clustering Explorer (HCE, version 3.5; Seo and Shneiderman, 2002), with
the complete—linkage algorithm and Euclidean distance:

(1)

60
2041‘ —Bi)2
i=1

where A,- and B,- are the log (G150) values in the i—th NCI—60 cell line for the
compound A and B, respectively.

2.3 Compound—target interaction network

A compound—target interaction network can offer a direct view of the
interactions between compounds and their protein targets. The ﬁrst step to
construct such a network is to identify the protein targets for the compounds
of interest. The detailed target annotations in the PubChem BioAssay
database (assay identiﬁer: AID) made this step very straightforward. For
each of the 37 compounds in this study, the PubChem bioassays in which the
compound was tested active (see each assay description for the deﬁnition
of bioactivity outcome) were identiﬁed. If the bioassay was speciﬁed with a
protein target, then the target was assigned to the compound and included
for network construction. Note that a compound may be found active
in several bioassays, so it is possible for a compound to have multiple
targets associated with it. In our network, the compound and target were
denoted as two different nodes, respectively. An edge was drawn to link a
compound node (labeled by the PubChem compound identiﬁer: CID) and a
target node (labeled by the NCBI protein identiﬁer: GI) if the compound is
active against the target. We applied the E—Utilities tool (http://eutils.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/eutils_help.html) to get the target GI for a
respective bioassay. For example, the following URL: http://eutils.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pcassay&db=protein&cmd=
neighbor&linkname=pcassay_protein_target&id=915 will return an XML
ﬁle containing the GI of the protein target for the bioassay with AID 915.
An in—house script was used to extract GI from the resultant XML ﬁle. To
avoid the ambiguity in target speciﬁcation, several PubChem bioassays that
associate with multiple GIs were excluded from analysis. The PubChem
bioassays as well as the target information used for network construction are
listed in Supplementary Table S1 based on the assay data in the PubChem
BioAssay database as of March 17, 2010. The compound—target interaction
network was visualized by using the Cytoscape (version 2.3.6; Shannon
at 611., 2003).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Hierarchical clustering analysis based on
bioactivity proﬁles

Hierarchical clustering was ﬁrst carried out for the initial set of
257 compounds, which was obtained prior to the application of the
third ﬁlter. The dendrogram graph of the clustering result is given in
Supplementary Figure S1. The log (G150) value of —6 was adopted
as the bipartite cutoff to determine whether a compound is active
(5 —6) or inactive (> —6) in a respective NCI—60 cell line. This
criterion for discriminating active compounds from inactive ones is
consistent with that speciﬁed in the PubChem BioAssay database
by the original NCI/DTP depositors, and as well as in other studies
(Lee et al., 2008).

Fig. 1. Hierarchical clustering of the 37 compounds in the ﬁnal set based
on their bioactivity proﬁles in the NCI—60 cell lines. The bioactivity proﬁle
of each compound is shown in spectrum (horizontal view). A minimum
similarity threshold of 0.88 (red solid line) is employed in HCE. Six clusters
that contain more than one compound are marked as A through F from top
to bottom. Relevant compounds (24 in total) are labeled with PubChem
compound identiﬁers (CID).

As shown in Supplementary Figure S1, compounds that
demonstrate similar bioactivity spectra were clustered. However, a
majority of compounds were clustered in proximity simply because
they were inactive (shown in blue) in most of the NCI—60 cell lines.
Though inactive information is also important, it is less relevant
to our study, which is to investigate the correlations among the
bioactivity proﬁles, molecular targets and chemical structures of
bioactive compounds. Furthermore, previous studies have shown
that the log (G150) values in the NCI—60 dataset are skewed toward
certain thresholds (Lee et al., 2008). In our case, nearly 25% of
the log(G150) values for the initial set of 257 compounds were
—4. The reason is that the highest tested concentration in the NCI—
60 cell lines is generally —4 (in log units), and if a compound is
not sufﬁciently active to show 50% cell growth inhibition at this
highest concentration, a upper bound of log(G150) value of —4
is typically reported (Shi et al., 1998b). Therefore, the bioactivity
proﬁles that contain primarily skewed inactivity data may provide
biased information. To avoid such bias to certain extent, a third ﬁlter
is needed to require every compound in the initial set to be active,
i.e. log(G150) 5 —6, in at least 15 out of the 60 NCI cell lines. This
criterion can ensure, at least to a partial extent, that the derived
similarity in bioactivity proﬁles result from biological activity rather
than inactivity. As a result, the initial compound set (257) was
narrowed down to contain only 37 compounds. With a much reduced
dataset, we were able to investigate the SAR and compound—target
interaction network for those compounds in greater details.

The hierarchical clustering for the 37 bioactive compounds was
carried out by using exactly the same algorithm as applied to
the initial compound set. The results are shown in Figure 1.
The dendrogram graph indicates that compounds with biologically
similar bioactivity were grouped together. By setting a relatively
tight cutoff of the minimum similarity of 0.88 in the HCE, clusters
containing more than one compound were obtained and labeled as

A through F from top to bottom. The minimum similarity cutoff of
0.88 was chosen empirically based on visual exploration. Interesting
results obtained on these clusters are given below.

3.2 Highly similar structures with highly similar
bioactivity proﬁles (Cluster B)

Five compounds (CID: 24360, 97226, 72402, 354677 and 60699)
were identiﬁed from cluster B. Their 2D chemical structures are
depicted in Figure 2A. Compared to the compounds in other
clusters, they gave the highest structural similarity as calculated
by using the Tanimoto metric and PubChem ﬁngerprint (ftp://ftp.
ncbi.nlm. nih. gov/pubchem/speciﬁcations/pubchem_ﬁngerprints.
txt). The average inter—compound structural similarity for these
compounds was 0.887. Therefore, it may not be surprising to
see that they also exhibited similar biological responses in the
NCI—60 cell lines (Fig. 2B). Indeed, similar bioactivity proﬁles were
observed for these compounds, indicating strong and consistent
inhibitory activity for a considerable number of cell lines. The
results from Figure 2A and B suggest that this group of compounds
demonstrated strong SAR.

Further analysis on chemical structures shows that these
compounds are the analogs of camptothecin, a selective inhibitor
of the topoisomerases I (TOPl). Among the ﬁve compounds,
two (CID: 24360 and 60699) are well—known inhibitors of TOPl
(Pizzolato and Saltz, 2003; Wethington et al., 2008). The former is
camptothecin itself, while the latter has recently been approved by
the FDA (trade name Hycamtin) in 2007 for oral use to treat ovarian
cancer (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hycamtin, accessed on April
12, 2010), which is consistent with its activity in the ovarian cell lines
(Fig. 2B). Considering the signiﬁcant similarity in both chemical
structures and bioactivity proﬁles, we proposed that the other
three compounds (CID: 97226, 72402 and 354677) might be novel
candidates of TOPl inhibitors. Nevertheless, one must always keep
in mind that this may only be conﬁrmed if the binding mechanism
is understood. In this case, the binding modes of the two known
inhibitors (CID: 24360 and 60699) have already been previously
clariﬁed (Staker et al., 2002, 2005). The X—ray crystal structures
of the enzyme—inhibitor complexes indicate that the oxygen atoms
connected to the positions 10, 17, 20, 21 and 22 (Fig. 2A) are
critical for the binding process by forming several hydrogen bonding
interactions directly or indirectly (through water salt bridges) with
relevant residues on TOPl. These key interacting sites are basically
preserved in other three compounds (CID: 97 226, 72 402 and
354 677). Therefore, it further suggests that these compounds might
be true TOPl inhibitors, as supported by previous studies (Ping et al.,
2006; Rapisarda et al., 2002; Wethington et al., 2008).

As mentioned in the Section 1, PubChem can provide rich
information of the compound—target associations for a number of
tested compounds in the NCI—60 dataset. By combining such data
from both repositories, it is possible for us to characterize the
bioactivity of tested compounds at cellular level and molecular level
simultaneously. The compound—target interaction network drawn
from the available PubChem HTS bioassays for the ﬁve compounds
in cluster B is shown in Figure 2C.

As one can see, these ﬁve compounds were closely packed by
sharing some common or relevant protein targets. Among the three
compounds (CID: 24360, 354677 and 72402), the ﬁrst compound
shared four common protein targets (GI: 119579178, 134304838,

124263658 and 5174617) with the second compound. In addition, it
also shared three common protein targets (GI: 11545912, 25952111
and 5174617) with the third compound. Moreover, these three
compounds shared a common protein target (GI: 5174617). This
observation again demonstrates the effectiveness of the similarity
principle. While it remains to be further evaluated when sufﬁcient
data is available, we propose that compounds sharing signiﬁcant
similarity in both chemical structures and bioactivity proﬁles may
have a higher chance for sharing similar patterns of interactions in
the compound—target interaction network, comparing to those with
only structural similarity. The remaing two compounds (CID: 97226
and 60699) appear to be apart from the above three compounds
in the common (or shared) compound—target interaction network.
This is mainly because they had not been tested on the same
targets, against which the previous three compounds were tested,
and thus gave insufﬁcient information on their interactions with
those relevant protein targets. However, as indicated in Figure 2C,
they had demonstrated similar activity to the compound CID: 243 60
against several common protein targets in a pairwise manner, which
may provide links to the other two compounds (CID: 354677 and
7 2402).

It should be mentioned that the abundant information of
compound—target association in PubChem bioassays may also
contain experimental noises such as promiscuous results. While
we cannot rule out the possibilities of the promiscuous effects
or other artifacts in our analysis, we found that some of the
compound—target associations were supported by previous studies.
For example, for the two compounds (CID: 24360 and 60699)
in cluster B, they both exhibited activity against two common
targets with one of them, hypoxia—inducible factor 105 (HIF—lot,
GI: 32879895), having been reported as the biological target for

these two compounds (Klausmeyer et al., 2007; Rapisarda et al.,
2002). These investigations support that our ﬁndings result from
experimental signals rather than noises. It is noticeable that the
compound CID: 354677 is also a known HIF—loz inhibitor (Rapisarda
et al., 2002), though it had not been included in the compound—
target network due to insufﬁcient data in PubChem (Fig. 2C). This
again demonstrates that similarity in bioactivity proﬁles and patterns
of interactions with relevant targets can be used to identify novel
compounds for a certain target. Nevertheless, further experiments
will be needed to validate some of the potentially novel compounds
identiﬁed by the MLP project.

3.3 Moderately similar structures with highly similar
bioactivity proﬁles (Cluster F)

Three compounds (CID: 2723601, 3246652 and 5351879) bearing
partially structural similarity were identiﬁed from cluster F. Their 2D
chemical structures and bioactivity proﬁles in the NCI—60 cell lines
are given in Figure 3A and B, respectively. These three compounds
stood out from the rest because they exhibited the maximal intra—
cluster similarity in their bioactivity proﬁles (Fig. 3B). In fact, cluster
F was the ﬁrst merged sub—tree during the hierarchical clustering
process (Fig. 1). Compared to cluster B, the observation in cluster
F may be even more interesting as the inter—compound structural
similarities were signiﬁcantly lower than those of cluster B. For
example, the two compounds (CID: 2723601 and 3246652), which
produced the highest structural similarity (0.462) among this cluster,
indicates only a moderate level of similarity in their chemical
structures. Another interesting observation seen from Figure 3B
is that these three compounds show effective but still selective
activity in the six leukemia cell lines, suggesting their potential

treatment to leukemia. Indeed, one compound (CID: 2723601) is an
approved small—molecule drug used in the therapy of several forms
of leukemia (http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00352, last accessed
date October 7, 2010).

The compound—target interaction network for the three
compounds in cluster F is given in Figure 3C. A single, common
protein target (,B—globin, GI: 4504349) was shared by all three
compounds, demonstrating again a strong correlation between
the similarity in bioactivity proﬁles and that in the patterns of
interactions with relevant protein targets. According to the PubChem
BioAssay database, the compound CID: 2723601 was tested active
in the bioassay (AID: 910), while the other two compounds (CID:
3246652 and 5351879) were tested active in another bioassay (AID:
925). Despite two separate bioassays, they were actually part of
a series of assays in an attempt to seek for the modulators of
hemoglobin ,B—splicing (Supplementary Table S1). A further analysis
shows that though the overall structural similarity was relatively
low, these three compounds possessed a common fragment of
thioguanine, which may play a key role for the compounds to
exhibit activity in modulating the hemoglobin splicing and some
other biological processes. This example suggests that similarity in
bioactivity proﬁles derived from a broad panel of assays, together
with the common features in chemical structures, can also indicate
similarity in the mode of action for respective compounds, and can
be used as a basis to determine information such as molecular targets
or biological pathways for uncharacterized compounds.

3.4 Results for clusters A, C, D and E

Unlike the compounds in clusters B and F, where strong correlations
among chemical structures, bioactivity proﬁles and patterns of
interactions with relevant protein targets can be observed, the
compounds in the other four clusters did not fall in the same category
for various reasons.

The three compounds in cluster A did not show signiﬁcant
similarity in either chemical structures or bioactivity proﬁles based
on the data available (Supplementary Fig. S2), yet the results
are still interesting despite the lack of overall coherence in the
compound—target interaction network. For example, two compounds
(CID: 107985 and 253602), regardless of the difference in chemical
scaffolds, were identiﬁed as showing inhibitory activities for the heat
shock factor 1 (HSFl, GI: 62740231), which is in agreement with
previous ﬁndings that both compounds are involved in the heat shock
response pathway (Park and Liu, 2001; Westerheide et al., 2006).
Likewise, the four compounds in cluster E generally show low
similarity in their bioactivity proﬁles (Supplementary Figure S3).
Moreover, structural similarity is also missing among compounds,
making the current bioactivity proﬁles less useful in discovering
novel compounds for the given targets. Nevertheless, it remains
interested to investigate the relationships among the compounds and
their target networks in future when more bioassay data become
available in PubChem.

The chemical structures and bioactivity proﬁles for the
three compounds identiﬁed from cluster C are listed in
Supplementary Figure S4. These three compounds exhibited certain
structural similarity by sharing a common fragment of di—ketone
(Supplementary Figure S4A), which may be responsible for the
notable similarity in their bioactivity proﬁles (Supplementary
Figure S4B). This observation resembled the results of cluster
F, where compounds moderately similar in chemical structures
with common fragment demonstrated signiﬁcant similarity in
bioactivity proﬁles. As for the compound—target interaction network
(Supplementary Figure S4C), however, only one compound (CID:
4212) in cluster C had been extensively assayed on multiple protein
targets, against which the other two compounds were not tested.
Therefore, target networks cannot be compared directly due to
lack of experimental support. Nevertheless, for the compound CID:
548171, considering its notably high similarities to the compound

Fig. 4. The complete diagram of the compound—target interaction network for the 24 compounds identiﬁed from the six clusters (i.e. A to F) obtained by
hierarchical clustering. Compounds are denoted as ellipses, which are labeled with PubChem compound identiﬁer (CID) and colored according to the clusters
they belong to. Targets are denoted as rectangles, which are labeled with NCBI protein identiﬁer (GI) and colored with dark or light red if the corresponding
assay is a conﬁrmatory or primary bioassay in PubChem, respectively. The edge linking an ellipse and a rectangle indicates that there is an interaction if the
current compound is found active against the target of interest. No edge is allowed between either two ellipses or two rectangles. For simplicity, target nodes

that have only single connecting compound node are not shown.

CID: 4212 in both chemical structures and bioactivity proﬁles
(Supplementary Figure S4A and B), it may also interact with certain
protein targets shared by the compound CID: 4212. This hypothesis
for predicting partially characterized compound according to well—
characterized ones remains highly interested to be veriﬁed by future
experiments.

As for the six compounds identiﬁed from cluster D, though
there was no obvious similarity either in chemical structures or
bioactivity proﬁles, they seemed to considerably show several
common patterns of interactions with relevant protein targets
(Supplementary Figure S5). For example, four (CID: 262093, 5614,
221363 and 252101) out of the six compounds in cluster D were
found active against several protein targets belonging to various
cytochrome p450 families and/or subfamilies, suggesting that they
may be effective in the p450—regulated pathways. This observation
suggests that the compound—target interaction network derived from
PubChem bioassays may be useful to identify a set of related
compounds involving in the same/similar biological pathway.

3.5 Overview of compound—target interaction network

The compound—target interaction networks analyzed in the above
sections were drawn for the compounds within the same hierarchical
cluster of bioactivity proﬁles. It remained highly interested to
investigate how compounds can be organized solely by their patterns

of interactions with relevant protein targets, and how that can be
compared to the hierarchical clusters derived from the bioactivity
proﬁles analysis. To this end, a complete diagram of compound—
target interaction network, as shown in Figure 4, was built for all
the compounds identiﬁed from the six clusters (i.e. A to F) using the
abundant information of compound—target association in PubChem
bioassays.

In general, the network was rather complex and presented a
great challenge for data analysis as a considerable number of
compounds had demonstrated interactions against multiple protein
targets. Though these interactions remained to be further evaluated
by identifying and excluding noises in the current assay data,
the multitude of compound—target associations may reveal the
promiscuous properties for certain compounds at the ﬁrst glance
and may facilitate the investigation of the polypharmacological
properties of small molecules.

Despite the observed complexity, the compounds shown in
Figure 4 can still be roughly grouped by their patterns of interactions
with relevant protein targets. For instance, the six compounds
obtained from the bioactivity proﬁle cluster D (colored in green)
tended to pack into a group, which was well supported by the fact
that there were so many common interacting targets shared by two
or more compounds (Supplementary Figure S5). Similarly, the three
compounds from the bioactivity proﬁle cluster F (colored in cyan)
can also be identiﬁed as a group due to a commonly shared protein

Investigating the correlations among the chemical structures, bioactivity profiles and molecular targets of small molecules

 

target (GI: 4504349). Therefore, it is interesting to observe that
the groups of compounds identiﬁed from the target network were,
to certain extent, consistent with those obtained by the clustering
analysis based on bioactivity proﬁles. This observation indicates that
there could be strong correlations between a compound’s bioactivity
proﬁle (cellular level) and its pattern of interactions with relevant
protein targets (molecular level). The compounds in the above two
clusters exhibited much larger variances (i.e. higher speciﬁcity) in
their bioactivity proﬁles, which may contribute to their relatively
converged patterns of interactions with relevant protein targets. In
contrast, some compounds presented in bioactivity proﬁle cluster A
(colored in yellow) showed generalized toxicity with low selectivity
and speciﬁcity (Supplementary Figure S2B), making them difﬁcult
to be identiﬁed as a group from Figure 4. This analysis was done
using a binary bioactivity outcome when considering the compound—
target association. Further analysis may be performed in future work
by incorporating the quantitative potency data (e.g. IC50) of each
compound to provide more insights.

4 CONCLUSIONS

By taking advantages of the publicly available data from both
PubChem HTS bioassays and NCI—60 human tumor cancer cell
line screens, we have investigated the correlations among the
bioactivity proﬁles, molecular targets and chemical structures of
small molecules. Hierarchical clustering of tested compounds was
carried out based on their bioactivity proﬁles derived from the
NCI—60 cell line screens, and several interesting clusters were
identiﬁed. First, the correlation between bioactivity proﬁles and
chemical structures was analyzed and strong SAR was suggested.
For example, the compounds in cluster B, which were highly similar
in chemical structures, also demonstrated notable similarity in their
bioactivity proﬁles. Even more interesting observations were given
by cluster F, where compounds were only moderately similar in
chemical structures and produced extremely signiﬁcant similarity
in bioactivity proﬁles. Second, analysis on the compound—target
interaction network was performed and showed clear correlations
between the bioactivity proﬁles of compounds and their patterns of
interactions with relevant protein targets, especially when chemical
structures were related. Furthermore, a complete compound—target
interaction network, which was drawn for all the compounds
identiﬁed from the six clusters, produced roughly the same groups of
compounds as that obtained by hierarchical clustering analysis based
on bioactivity proﬁles. This study shows that strong correlations
can be observed between similarity in bioactivity proﬁles (cellular
level) and that from the patterns of interactions with relevant
protein targets (molecular level), and suggests that novel compound
candidates with desired pharmacological properties can be identiﬁed
by comparing their bioactivity proﬁles and/or compound—target
interaction network to well—characterized compounds.

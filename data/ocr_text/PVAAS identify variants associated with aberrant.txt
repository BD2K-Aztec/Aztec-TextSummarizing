Abstract

Motivation: RNA-seq has been widely used to study the transcriptome. Comparing to microarray,
sequencing-based RNA-seq is able to identify splicing variants and single nucleotide variants in
one experiment simultaneously. This provides unique opportunity to detect variants that associ-
ated with aberrant splicing. Despite the popularity of RNA-seq, no bioinformatics tool has been de-
veloped to leverage this advantage to identify variants associated with aberrant splicing.

Results: We have developed PVAAS, a tool to identify single nucleotide variants that associated
with aberrant alternative splicing from RNA-seq data. PVAAS works in three steps: (i) identify aber-
rant splicings; (ii) use user-provided variants or perform variant calling; (iii) assess the significance
of association between variants and aberrant splicing events.

Availability and implementation: PVAAS is written in Python and C. Source code and a compre-
hensive user’s manual are freely available at: http://pvaas.sourceforge.net/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing is the primary mechanism
to increase protein diversity in eukaryote (Graveley, 2001). In
humans, ~95% of multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced (Wang
et al., 2008). On the other hand, this tightly regulated, sophisticated
nuclear process is also a natural source of disease-causing errors.
Genetic mutations in splice sites or other cis-regulatory sites (such as
exonic splicing enhancer, or ESE) can impair the splicing process
and lead to aberrantly spliced transcripts. Aberrant splicings are in-
creasingly recognized as responsible for human disease (Douglas
and Wood, 2011; Faustino and Cooper, 2003; Tazi et al., 2009). It
is estimated that 50% of disease causing mutations affect splicing
(Lopez-Bigas et al., 2005). Despite the importance of aberrant splic-
ing in disease development and progression, little work has been
done to identity the causal mutations that are directly associated
with aberrant splicing in genome scale.

The sequencing of the transcriptome using high-throughput
sequencing platforms provides a unique opportunity to study the as-
sociation between single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and splice vari-
ants. First, RNA-seq experiment is able to simultaneously identify

aberrant splicing events and SNVs, a clear advantage compared with
microarrays. Second, spliced reads (i.e. reads that spanning exon-
exon junctions) provide physical evidence of the association between
variants and certain isoforms. To our knowledge, no bioinformatics
tool is currently available to characterize this association.

We have developed PVAAS, a program to detect SNVs that are
associated with aberrant alternative splicing from RNA-seq data dir-
ectly. It efficiently handles large-scale data with hundreds of millions
of alignments.

2 Features and Methods

2.1 Extract and annotate spliced alignments

PVAAS takes the commonly used BAM file as input (Li et al., 2009).
Spliced reads are extracted from the original BAM file and anno-
tated using provided reference gene model(s). For pair-end RNA
sequencing, the mates of splice-mapped reads are also extracted.
According to the annotation status of the 5’ splice site (5’55, or
donor site) and the 3’ splice site (3’55, or acceptor site), splicing
events are grouped into 3 categories: (i) canonical splicing (i.e. both

5’ and 3’ SS are known). (ii) Semi-canonical splicing (i.e. either 5’ or
3’ SS is known). (iii) Novel splicing (both 5’ and 3’ SS are novel).
‘Semi-canonical splicing’ and ‘novel splicing’ are considered as aber-
rant splicing events, because both of them involve spurious splicing
site. A new BAM file containing all spliced alignments is generated
to facilitate downstream analyses and visualization. In addition, the
annotation information for each splice alignment is also incorpo-
rated as additional tags.

2.2 Identify variants associated with aberrant splicing

If no variants were supplied, PVAAS will try to identify SNVs from
BAM file containing spliced alignments. We then investigate if there
are any variants that specifically associated with aberrant splicing.
In the example illustrated in Figure 1, all reads containing allele ‘G’
are canonically spliced while all reads containing allele ‘A’ are aber-
rantly spliced, suggesting that the ‘A’ allele is associated with aber-
rant splicing. We use Fisher’s exact test to evaluate the significance
of association between sequence variants (SNPs or indels) and the
aberrant splicing events. Let’s assume that a given SNV is covered
by n splice reads, with k reads canonically spliced and m reads are
aberrantly spliced (n = k + m). Let’s also assume that out of the k ca-
nonically spliced reads, p reads have the alternate (non reference) al-
lele, and out of the m aberrantly spliced reads, q reads have the
alternate allele, the Fisher’s exact test can be formulated as follow:

(2:17;)

After calculating the raw P values, the Benjamini-Hochberg proced-

Fisher’ s extract P =

ure is used to control the false discovery rate (FDR).

2.3 Applying PVAAS to real RNA-seq data

To demonstrate the usefulness of PVAAS, we applied it to one of
the TCGA prostate cancer RNA-seq data (uuid=960c1e43-
d2be-41f0-9f3a-8234cddb84be). Using the adjusted P-value cutoff
0.01, we detected 215 SNVs that significantly associated with
aberrant splicing. A-to-G (or T-to-C) transitions were the most
frequent (32%) mutation type that associated with semi-canonical
aberrant splicing (Fig. 2A), while G-to-A (or C-to-T) transitions
were the most frequent (34%) mutation type that associated with
novel aberrant splicing (Fig. 2B). SNVs associated with semi-
canonical aberrant splicing were primarily located in exon boun-
daries (Fig. 2C), while SNVs associated with novel aberrant
splicing were distributed evenly across exon (Fig. 2D). A genuine
example was shown in Supplementary Figure S1, a C-to-A muta-
tion (chr9: 96320999) located near 5’ SS was found significantly
associated with spurious 3’ SS. The use of spurious 3’ SS lead to a

3 Summary and Discussion

The characterization of variants affecting splicing will promise
deeper insights into cis-elements regulated alternative splicing.
Evidence suggests that these variants could also significantly con-
tribute to disease. For example, some synonymous point mutations
previously thought to be silent mutations might disrupt motif that
involved in pre-mRNA splicing, and therefore lead to the produce of
aberrant isoforms (Cartegni et al., 2002).

Cis-acting splicing regulatory elements include ESEs, exonic
splicing silencers (ESSs), intronic splicing enhancers and intronic
splicing silencers. However, PVAAS can only be used to study ESEs
and ESSs because the vast majority of the SNVs called from RNA-
seq are located in expressed exons. Moreover, when using PVAAS,
one has to keep in mind that tumor tissues are often contaminated
with normal stromal cells and might include different sub-clones.
Such heterogeneity confounds the association analysis between
SNVs and aberrant splicing. Although Fisher’s test could effectively
assess the significance of association between allele and aberrant
splicing, technical advance such as single cell sequencing would
dramatically improve the detection sensitivity and specificity.

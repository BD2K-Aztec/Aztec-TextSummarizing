ABSTRACT

Motivation: Abrupt reduction/resumption of thermal fluctuations of a
force probe has been used to identify association/dissociation events of
protein—ligand bonds. We show that off-rate of molecular dissociation
can be estimated by the analysis of the bond lifetime, while the on-rate
of molecular association can be estimated by the analysis of the waiting
time between two neighboring bond events. However, the analysis
relies heavily on subjective judgments and is time-consuming. To auto-
mate the process of mapping out bond events from thermal fluctuation
data, we develop a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based method.
Results: The HMM method represents the bond state by a hidden
variable with two values: bound and unbound. The bond association/
dissociation is visualized and pinpointed. We apply the method to
analyze a key receptor—ligand interaction in the early stage of hemo-
stasis and thrombosis: the von Willebrand factor (VWF) binding to
platelet glycoprotein Ibo: (GPIbot). The numbers of bond lifetime and
waiting time events estimated by the HMM are much more than those
estimated by a descriptive statistical method from the same set of raw
data. The kinetic parameters estimated by the HMM are in excellent
agreement with those by a descriptive statistical analysis, but have
much smaller errors for both wild-type and two mutant VWF-A1 do-
mains. Thus, the computerized analysis allows us to speed up the ana-
lysis and improve the quality of estimates of receptor—ligand binding
kinetics.

1 INTRODUCTION

During the early stage of hemostatic and thrombotic processes,
platelets tether to and roll on the immobilized von Willebrand
factor (VWF), which is mediated through binding between the
45 kDa N-terminal domain of the alpha subunit of the GPIb-IX—
V complex (GPIbor) and the Al domain of the VWF (Ruggeri
and Mendolicchio, 2007). Disease-related mutations in the VWF
have been found to change the mechanical regulation of platelet
adhesion, resulting in the bleeding disorder von Willebrand dis-
ease WWD) (Ruggeri, 2007). From a biophysical perspective,

these mutations alter VWF—GPIbor binding kinetics. It has
been shown that single-residue mutation R1450E that exhibits
the type 2B VWD phenotype increases VWF—GPIbor binding
afﬁnity and supports the rolling of more platelets at slower velo-
cities without a minimum shear requirement (Auton et al., 2010;
Coburn et al., 2011). Another single-residue mutation G1324S
that exhibits the type 2M VWD phenotype decreases the binding
afﬁnity between these two molecules (Coburn et al., 2011;
Morales et al., 2006).

The binding afﬁnity is the ratio of the on— to off-rates, which
quantiﬁes the net effects of receptor—ligand association and dis-
sociation. To measure the on- and off-rates separately, mechan-
ical methods, such as the thermal ﬂuctuation assay, that use
ultrasensitive force probes, e.g. the biomembrane force probe
(BFP; Chen et al., 2008) and optical tweezers (Lister et al.,
2004; Molloy et al., 1995; Sun et al., 2009; Veigel et al., 1999),
have been developed to measure the interactions of proteins
immobilized on surfaces. The idea stems from the observation
that force probes used for single-molecule experiments are usu-
ally susceptible to thermal ﬂuctuations. The formation of a mo-
lecular bond spanning across the gap between the force probe
and the target physically connects the two surfaces and reduces
the thermal ﬂuctuation of the force probe. In other words, the
newly formed bond is equivalent to adding a constraint to the
force probe (Chen et al., 2008). In the analysis of experimental
data, bond formation is detected from the reduction in the ther-
mal ﬂuctuation of the probe position, and bond dissociation is
detected from the resumption of thermal ﬂuctuation, as judged
by the sliding standard deviation moving below or above certain
thresholds. Although this descriptive statistical method is simple,
it has several disadvantages: it is time-consuming, not robust,
susceptible to noise and subjective. To overcome these draw-
backs, we developed a Hidden Markov model (HMM)-based
algorithm that provides an automatic and systematic procedure
for analyzing thermal ﬂuctuation data efﬁciently. We ﬁrst
assume a hidden state, bound or unbound, for each observed
probe position. Given the hidden states, the probe positions
are assumed to be independent and normally distributed with
unknown parameters. The forward—backward algorithm (Baum
et al., 1970; Dempster et al., 1977; Welch, 2003) was used to
estimate the underlying states and unknown parameters.

Because of its versatility in modeling and robustness in predic-
tion performance, HMM has wide applications in computational
biology. For example, HMMs can detect tumor subtypes with

microarray data (Zhang et al., 2011) and identify protein-binding
sites in DNA (Cardon and Stormo, 1992). However, to the best
of our knowledge, no HMM-based computer algorithm has been
developed for analyzing thermal ﬂuctuation data. In the thermal
ﬂuctuation assay, if the probe is in either the bound or unbound
state at one moment, it is more likely to be in the same state
at the next moment. This memory eﬂect can be successfully
captured by assuming a Markovian structure at the transition
of the underlying states (Y.Hung et al., submitted for publica-
tion). Furthermore, HMM enables us to provide statistical infer-
ence such as the conﬁdence interval and the prediction interval.
In particular, by using the likelihood ratio test based on the ﬁtted
HMM, we can verify the memory effect objectively and rigor-
ously in repeated adhesions (Y. Hung et al., submitted for
publication).

This article is organized as follows. Sections 2.1 and 2.2 de-
scribe the experiment setup and the existing method. Section 2.3
illustrates the procedures to analyze thermal ﬂuctuation data.
Sections 2.4—2.7 discuss the modeling and computation
of HMM. In Section 3, we use the HMM to derive kinetic
rates by analyzing thermal ﬂuctuation data obtained for the
interaction of VWF-A1 and glycocalicin (GC), the extracellular
portion of GPIbor. We also show the performance of the
HMM method in comparison to the manual method based on
descriptive statistics. In addition to running a performance test of
the HMM method with the dataset of wild-type (WT) A1, we ran
more performance tests with datasets of two single-residue A1
VWD mutants, R1450E (type 2B) and G1324S (type 2M). All
above show that the HMM method is far easier to use. Section 4
presents the discussion and concluding remarks.

2 METHODS

2.1 Experimental setup

The recombinant WT VWF-A1 domain (residues 1238—1471) and two
single-residue mutants, R1450E that exhibits the gain-of—function (GOF)
phenotype of type 2B VWD and G1324S that exhibits the loss-of-
function (LOF) phenotype of type 2M VWD, were gifts from Dr
Miguel Cruz (Baylor College of Medicine, TX). The GPIbor extracellular
domain GC was a gift from Dr Jing—fei Dong (Puget Sound Blood
Research Institute, WA).

The BFP system (Chen et al., 2008) and the interacting molecules are
respectively illustrated in Figure 1A and B. The VWF-A1 and GC were
covalently coupled to the probe bead (Fig. 1B, left) and the target bead
(Fig. 1B, right), respectively. Human red blood cells (RBCs) were puriﬁed
from peripheral blood of healthy donors by ﬁnger prick and biotinylated
using a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
Georgia Institute of Technology. To enable attachment to the apex of
the biotinylated RBC, streptavidins were coated to probe beads. The
pressurized RBC by micropipette aspiration serves as an ultrasensitive
force transducer with a soft spring constant of 0.15 pN/nm by tuning the
water pressure through a custom-made manometer system. A homemade
LabviewTM program was used for data acquisition by tracking the probe
bead displacement with 0.7 ms temporal and :l:3 nm spatial resolution.

The experiment used a high-speed camera at 1500 frames per second to
track the axial (horizontal) position of the probe in discrete time points.
The raw data of probe position x versus time t consist four phases
(Fig. 1C). The target bead was driven by a computer-controlled piezo-
electric translator to approach the probe bead at a speed of 2um/s
(Fig. 1C, black). After a short contact of ~0.1s (green), the target was
retracted (purple) and held from the probe by a separation distance of

the probe bead (black), contact for 0.1 s (green), retract (purple) and be
held (blue and red) stationary with at a preset position. Blue and red
traces annotate, respectively, bound and unbound states detected by the
descriptive statistical method. Five minutes on average were taken to
ﬁnish the manual annotation on one trace. (D) Plot of 090 (the sliding
standard deviation of 90 consecutive x positions from data in C around 1)
versus 1. The same color coding is used as C

~10 nm for 10—15 s (blue and red). The Brownian motion of the probe
bead was monitored with the same BFP spring constant for all experi-
ments. Experiments were performed at room temperature (25° C).

2.2 Descriptive statistical method

The underlying idea is that anchoring the probe bead to the target
bead via a VWF-Al—GC bond reduces the thermal ﬂuctuations. This
is because the stiffness of the system (ksys) is the BFP stiffness (kBFP)
without a bond but is changed to the sum of the BFP stiffness and
the molecular bond stiffness (kmol), i.e. ksysszFp+km01, with a bond.
The reduction in thermal ﬂuctuation follows from the equipartition the-
orem, kSySO‘Z =kBT, where ICE is the Boltzmann constant, T is absolute
temperature and 02 is the ensemble variance of the displacements that
represents a metric of thermal ﬂuctuations. At constant temperature,
an increase in ksys would cause a decrease in 02. Thus, the decrease in
02 indicates bond association, while the increase in 02 indicates bond
dissociation. The variance of bound portion should be smaller than
that of unbound portion.

In the descriptive statistical method, we approximated the ensemble
standard deviation 0 by a sliding standard deviation of 90 consecutive
data points, 090, from the x-t sequence and plotted it versus t (Fig. 1D).
We chose 90 points by balancing the competing needs for an approximate
a value and temporal resolution. Note that the number of points chosen
to plot the standard deviation can affect analysis results. We then draw
two horizontal lines to represent the thresholds to identify bond associ-
ation (solid line in Fig. 1D) and dissociation (dashed line). The choice
of thresholds also requires the experimenter’s judgment and can cause
variation in annotation of bound versus unbound states. The descriptive

An HMM-based algorithm for thermal fluctuation data

 

statistical-based method selects data points with a 090 lower than the
association threshold to be in the bound state and those higher than
the dissociation threshold to be in the unbound state. This method is
time-/labor-consuming, which may take several days to ﬁnish the analysis
of data generated from a 1-day experiment. To obtain statistically mean-
ingful results, a large number of distance curves need to be collected,
making data analysis the bottleneck of the output. Moreover, this
analysis uses personal judgment to select the window width of sliding
standard deviation and the thresholds for state annotation. This will in-
evitably bring in subjectivity and errors.

2.3 Data preparation: removing erroneous data and
correcting drift

To overcome drawbacks of the descriptive statistical-based algorithm, we
developed an HMM-based algorithm. Before applying either method, a
careful automated prescreening of x versus t raw data is required. This is
because some of the curves exhibit large magnitude of rapid shifting,
probably due to environmental perturbations and human errors during
experiments (x in Fig. 2). The poor quality of such data prevents reliable
analysis by either algorithm. In particular, it may affect HMM learning
by causing false-positive bond annotation. As a ﬁrst step of data prepar-
ation, erroneous data are removed (Fig. 2, Step 1). For the acceptable
data (J in Fig. 2), there may still be slow drift in the holding phase, which
might be caused by misaligned contact between the probe and the target

methods; Step 3, HMM parameter estimation; Step 4, identiﬁcation of

during the assembly of the BFP. As the second step of data preparation,
a high-order polynomial is used to ﬁt the position data and corrects
the drift (Step 2). After prescreening, the clean data are ready for both
descriptive statistical-based algorithm to use and HMM training and
annotation. In the learning process, we train HMM to get the tuning
parameter using cross validation as described in Section 2.6 (Step 3).
Then HMM is ready for batch data annotation (Step 4) and kinetic
analysis (Step 5).

2.4 An HMM-based algorithm for analyzing thermal
ﬂuctuation data

We developed an HMM method to analyze x-t curves from the thermal
ﬂuctuation assay (Fig. 3). The objective is to computerize the bond
state annotation similar to the descriptive method but with a higher
efﬁciency (Fig. 3A). The statistical methodology can be found in
Y.Hung et al. (submitted for publication). Here we model the molecular
interaction on a BFP as a process with the hidden bound state following
Markovian structure (Fig. 3B). Let x, denote the horizontal position of
the probe at time t. For each observation xt, there is an unobservable
variable 2, representing the binding state at time t. The indicator variable
2, takes value 0 (Fig. 3B, blue) when there is no bond between the probe
and the target at time t, and 1 (Fig. 3B, red) otherwise. The change of
state 2, can be described by a stationary Markov chain with two states,
transition probability Pij=P(zt+1=j| 2,21) and stationary probability
Pi, where i, j take values of 0 or 1. Stationary probability P1 /P0 can be
interpreted as the probability of observing bound/unbound event in the
experiment. When the corresponding binding state 2, is given to be k, the
corresponding probe position xt is assumed to be mutually independent
and normally distributed with mean uHMM and variance oflMM. From
Section 2.2, we have aim/[MO >0‘HMM,%. As a result, the HMM method
divides an x-t curve into a series of segments. Each segment is character-
ized by a constant uHMM and oiIMM. This will distinguish the bound

and unbound portions, thus making the threshold much easier to be seen
(Fig. 3C).

2.5 HMM computation

A forward—backward algorithm is used to compute the parameters and
unknown states. Stationary probability of the unbound state P0 is the
only tuning parameter in the algorithm. The reason for using P0 is to
incorporate biological knowledge of the binding frequency into HMM.
This tuning parameter can be chosen through cross validation. In fact, we
can show that the analysis result is insensitive to the initial choice of P0 as
long as it lies in a proper range (Section 3.2). The forward—backward
algorithm is a two-step procedure that computes the estimate as follows:
in the forward step, it computes P(zm|x1 , . . . , xm) for all m 5 n, where n is
the length of the sequence; then in the backward step, the algorithm
computes P(xn1+ 1 , . . . ,xnlzm). It is known that the algorithm converges
to the maximum-likelihood estimate (Baum et al., 1970).

2.6 On— and off-rate estimates

This subsection describes how to statistically estimate kinetic on- and off-
rates (kon and koff) of receptor—ligand interaction through the previously
annotated bound and unbound states versus time segments. Because
association and dissociation of single biomolecular bonds are stochastic
events, the moments when they occur and their durations are random.
The on- and off-rates represent statistical characteristics underlying these
probabilistic kinetic processes. Therefore, they are determined by the to-
tality of the data rather than individual points in the collection. As such,
kon and koff are insensitive to small disturbance and error, such as missing
or false alarm in a small number of events. This property can be used to
train the tuning parameter in HMM (Section 2.7) and explain the

Exponential waiting time distributions for the interaction of WT A1

and pooled (blue squares). Another ensemble of ~200 waiting times
was measured by HMM from the same raw data and pooled (red
squares). For each method, the natural log of the survival frequency
with waiting times >tW was plotted against tW and fitted by a straight
line (solid line). The negative slopes of the best-fits represent the cellular
on-rate kfm = mrmlACkon estimated by the two methods. The variations in
these values are shown by the 95% confidence interval of the best-fit
(dotted lines). The red dotted lines are obscured because they overlap
with the red solid line. (B). Comparison of effective on-rate Ackon esti-
mated by descriptive statistical and HMM methods for WT, G1324S

by dividing kgn by the product of the protein densities on the probe (ml
for A1) and target (mr for GC) beads, i.e. 1mm]: 1.96, 2.8 and 0.19 X 105
um_4 determined by ﬂow cytometry for respective conditions. The error
bars indicate the 95 % confidence interval for each method

performance comparison of the HMM- and descriptive statistical-based
algorithms (Section 3).

Let waiting time tW be the period from the dissociation moment of the
existing bond to the association moment of the next bond, and bond
lifetime tb be the period from the moment of bond association to dissoci-
ation. A pooled collection of waiting times should follow the distribution
of the first-order kinetics of irreversible association of single bonds:

PW = 1 — exp(—kgntw) (1)

where the cellular on-rate kgn =Acmrm1kon is a product of four param-
eters: AC is the contact area (considered as a constant for all experiments),
mr and m1 are the respective receptor (GC) and ligand (A1) densities
measured by ﬂow cytometry (Yago et al., 2004) and ken is the molecular
on-rate. PW is the probability for a bond to form after waiting time tW. PW
can be estimated by survival frequency as the fraction of events with
waiting time th. Thus, the cellular on-rate can be estimated from the
negative slope of the ln(1 — PW) versus [W plot (Fig. 4A).

Similarly, a pooled collection of bond lifetimes should follow the
distribution of the first-order kinetics of irreversible dissociation of
single bonds:

Pb = €Xp(—kofflb) (2)

where Pb is the probability for a bond formed at 1:0 to survive at lb
and can be estimated by survival frequency with bond lifetime 21b.
The negative slope of the ln(Pb) versus tb plot provides an estimate for
the off-rate koff (Fig. 5A). Our recent work (Ju,L. et al., submitted for
publication) suggested that the VWF-Al—GC bond has two states at low
force: one major state that features events with short lifetime (0.01
s< tb<0.5 s) and one minor state with long lifetime (lb 0.5 s). Usually
long lifetime events mingle with multiple bond events and become sus-
ceptible to drifting-induced noise, while events with very short lifetime
(tb50.01s) are highly suspected as non-speciﬁc events. For illustrative
purposes, we only demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of HMM
with events in short lifetime regime (0.01 s< tb< 0.5 s).

2.7 Training of HMM

To choose the tuning parameter and test the robustness of the algorithm,
we implement a half-sampling cross validation method (Celeux and

An HMM-based algorithm for thermal fluctuation data

 

Durand, 2008), which preserves the underlying Markov chain structure.
We segregate the complete sequence of probe position observations
X: (361,362, . . . .3611) into the odd, i.e. XI = (x1,x3 , . . .), and even, i.e.
X2: (x2,x4, . . .), subsequences. Denote the off-rate of the HMM result
from the odd subsequence as [(2% and the even subsequence as  The
relative error ac between the two subsequences is deﬁned as follows:

8c = (1 — kffii/ki‘éf-

We can similarly deﬁne the relative error of off-rate between HMM
and descriptive statistical methods. Let kéﬂ. be the off-rate of X using
descriptive statistical method and kgff be the result of HMM. The relative
error Sr is deﬁned as follows:

a, = (1 — kgff/kgﬁ)?

We choose tuning parameter P0 such that the relative error so is small.
Later, we shall illustrate the robustness of HMM by showing that the
range of P0 with small so overlaps with that with small 8r (Section 3.2).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Justiﬁcation of HMM with the VWF-Al—GC
interaction

We compare kinetic rate estimates from descriptive statistical
analysis with those from HMM on the same set of thermal ﬁuc—
tuation data. For the interaction of GC with VWF-A1 (Fig. 1A),
the HMM method (Fig. 3A) performs as well as the descriptive
method in bond annotation (Fig. 1C). The linearized distribu-
tions of respective waiting times and bond lifetimes determined
by the two methods overlapped and showed similar slopes, sug-
gesting similar cellular on—rate (Fig. 4A) and off-rate (Fig. 5A)
estimates from two methods. Indeed, the means and 95% conﬁ-
dence intervals of the cellular on-rate by the descriptive statistical
algorithm and HMM are 1.302 :1: 0.079 s—1 and 1.395 :1: 0.046 s—l,
respectively (Fig. 4B). The two conﬁdence intervals overlap,
indicating that the parameter estimates are statistically close to
each other. For the off-rate, the means and 95% conﬁdence
intervals by the descriptive statistical algorithm and HMM
are 26.58:|:0.92s_1 and 26.46:|:0.18 s_1, respectively (Fig. 5B),
which also overlap with each other.

In addition to the above analysis of the WT VWF-A1 data, we
compared performance of the HMM and descriptive statistical
methods using data from two single-residue mutations in VWF-
Al that alter their interactions with GPIb in biologically import-
ant ways: (i) G1324S that exhibits type 2M VWD phenotype and
(ii) R1450E that exhibits type 2B VWD phenotype. To compare
molecular on—rates requires removal of the site density effect. We
measured the site densities of VWF-A1 and GC respectively and
divided the cellular on-rate kfm by mrmL corresponding to each
A1 construct (WT or mutant). The result is the effective on—rate,
Ackon. Because the contact area AC was kept as close to constant
as possible between experiments, the Ackon is a good measure for
on-rate comparison (Chen et al., 2008).

Both the descriptive and HMM methods show that mutation
G1324S decreased effective on—rate, from 6.64 :I: 0.20 to
2.07 :|:0.05 X 10—6 ,u.m4s_1 (descriptive) and 7.12:1:0.12 to
2.24:1:003 x 10—6 ,um4s—1 (HMM) (Fig. 4B), but had little
effect on off-rate (Fig. 5B). This correlates with the LOF pheno-
type of G1324S as it induces less platelet agglutination compared
with WT A1 (Rabinowitz et al., 1992). Both the descriptive

and HMM analyses indicate that the R1450E mutation resulted
in an ~8-fold increase in the effective on-rate: 6.64:1:0.20 to
76.59:|: 1.51 x 10—6 ,u.m4s_1 (descriptive) and 7.12:1:0.12 to
82.64:|:2.79 x 10—6 ,um48_1 (HMM) (Fig. 4B), which are in
good agreement. Similar to G1324S, R1450E had little effect
on stress-free off-rates of the short state (Fig. 5B). The result
correlates with the GOF phenotype of R1450E. Type 2B VWD
mutations in the A1 domain have been shown to result in
abnormal interactions between platelet GPIba and soluble
VWF, such that R1450E A1 requires less ristocetin or lower
shear to induce platelet agglutination (Matsushita and Sadler,
1995). Such abnormal interactions have been suggested to lead
to prolonged bleeding time due to either the lack of unbound
GPIba on platelet surface to interact with immobilized VWF
at sites of vascular injury, reduced platelet counts due to early
clearance of platelet aggregates or both (Ruggeri and
Mendolicchio, 2007).

Note that HMM has much narrower width of 95% conﬁdence
intervals compared with that of descriptive statistical method for
both cellular on-rate (Fig. 6A) and off-rate (Fig. 6B) for all three
molecular interactions tested here. Thus, the HMM method is
more accurate (less error) than the descriptive method presum-
ably because it reduces the errors brought by subjective judgment
of the experimenter. Moreover, the HMM method can measure
far more events than the descriptive statistical method from the
same set of raw data, e. g. 112410 for waiting times (ﬁrst group in
Fig. 6C) and 169—46 for bond lifetimes (ﬁrst group in Fig. 6D)
for the WT A1 case. In the mutant cases, the HMM measure-
ments also outnumbered the descriptive statistical measurements
(Fig. 6C and D), indicating that many of the waiting times and

bond lifetimes gone undetected by the descriptive method can be
resolved by HMM.

Although the kinetics parameters differ for different molecular
interactions, the estimates from HMM are consistent with
the anticipated biological effects and match the results from
the descriptive statistical method. These results validate HMM
as a reliable and accurate method for evaluating the on— and
off-rate change of each mutation relative to WT.

3.2 Tuning parameter reliability of HMM

In HMM, the probability of observing a data point in the un-
bound state PO is the only tuning parameter in the algorithm.
Based on the half-sampling cross validation in Section 2.7, we
plot the relative error 80 (Fig. 7A) and Sr (Fig. 7B) against dif-
ferent P0. The P0 that gives the lowest 80 ranges from 0.85 to 0.96
from which we choose the value in our prediction algorithm. It
can be seen from Figure 7B that different choices of P0 do not
render much inconsistency between the results from descriptive
statistical method and HMM, as the relative error is smaller than
0.025. This shows the robustness in the prediction performance
and the reliability of the HMM-tuning parameter.

3.3 HMM learning curve

To further verify that HMM reduces the time required for data
analysis by the descriptive method, we did the following perform-
ance tests:

(1) Compare the time required for a new student to learn
the HMM and the descriptive method

(ii) Compare the time required for an experienced student to
analyze the same set of raw data using the two methods.

For the ﬁrst test, we surveyed two new students in our lab
who just started learning the thermal ﬂuctuation assay. We plot
their learning curves by tracking their performance from week 0
to week 8 (Fig. 8A). For each week, we recorded the time
required for them to ﬁnish analyzing similar amount of thermal
ﬂuctuation data by using both manual method (blue) HMM
method (red). We found that it took much less time for both
to ﬁnish the analysis by HMM than by the descriptive method
every week: 20 versus 4h at week 0, and 8 versus 1h at week 8.
The HMM is much less time-consuming than the descriptive
statistical method.

For the second test, we collected information from two
students who had experience in analyzing BFP thermal ﬂuctu-
ation data. We assigned the same dataset used in Figures 4 and 5
to them and recorded the times it took for them to ﬁnish the
analysis using the two methods (Fig. 8B). Consistently, using the
HMM (red) took much less time than using the descriptive
method (blue), 1 versus 5—6 h.

4 DISCUSSION

It has long been recognized that changes in thermal ﬂuctuation
can be used to identify single-molecule events. This idea was
implemented in early work to probe the duration and contact
stiffness of myosin motors interacting with actin ﬁlament (Lister
et al., 2004; Mehta et al., 1997; Molloy et al., 1995; Veigel et al.,
1999). More recently, it was used to analyze 2D kinetics of ad-
hesion molecules interacting with their ligands (Chen et al., 2008,
2010; Huang et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2009), to measure molecular
elasticity (Chen et al., 2012; Marshall et al., 2006; Sarangapani
et al., 2011), and to determine protein conformational changes
(Chen et al., 2012). Some studies used BFP that was custom-
designed and home-made in a handful of laboratories (Chen
et al., 2008, 2010, 2012; Huang et al., 2010). Others used optical
tweezers (Mehta et al., 1997; Molloy et al., 1995; Sun et al., 2009;
Veigel et al., 1999) and atomic force microscope (Marshall et al.,
2006; Sarangapani et al., 2011) that are commercially available in
many laboratories. Therefore, these methods have high potential
for a broad range of applications by many investigators.
Unfortunately, previous analyses were done using merely eye-
balling (Lister et al., 2004; Mehta et al., 1997; Molloy et al.,
1995; Veigel et al., 1999) or descriptive statistical analysis
(Chen et al., 2008, 2010, 2012; Huang et al., 2010; Marshall
et al., 2006; Sarangapani et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2009). The draw-
backs of these primitive analyses may limit the applications of
the thermal ﬂuctuation methods because the descriptive statis-
tical-based algorithm is time-consuming, subjective and prone to
noise and error. In this study, we developed a computational
algorithm based on analytical statistics rather than descriptive

An HMM-based algorithm for thermal fluctuation data

 

statistics. The HMM-based algorithm automates and high-
throughputs the processing of data and has the advantage of
being rigorous and objective. We used the VWF-Al—GC
system to test the HMM method. The estimates from HMM
are comparable with those from the descriptive statistical
method (manual analysis) (Figs 1C and 3A) with the same
tuning parameters (Figs 4 and 5).

This article compares the on— (Fig. 4) and off- (Fig. 5) rates of
GC interactions with WT and two mutant A1 domains. At static
conditions, platelet GPIba does not bind WT VWF unless
a modulator ristocetin is added to induce the conformational
activation of the A1 domain (Berndt et al., 1988). By compari-
son, the type 2B VWD mutant R1450E binds GPIba spontan-
eously without ristocetin (Auton et al., 2010; Matsushita and
Sadler, 1995), whereas the type 2M VWD mutation G1324S
abolishes the ristocetin-induced binding to GPIba (Morales
et al., 2006; Rabinowitz et al., 1992). Our kinetics measurements
correlate well with these biochemical characterizations in that the
R1450E mutant gains the function with an increased on-rate,
whereas the G1324S mutant loses the function with a decreased
on-rate (Fig. 4B). The data indicate that the association kinetics
reﬂect the conformational states of VWF-A1. There has recently
been signiﬁcant progress in correlating protein structure and
binding kinetics. A web server has been developed for prediction
of association rate constant by incorporating the protein
conformational changes based on the archived protein—ligand
complex structures (Qin et al., 2011). Complementing such
efforts, the HMM method combined with the thermal ﬂuctu-
ation assay provides experimentally measured binding kinetics
and their correlation to protein structure and function.

The HMM method consistently shows higher accuracy than
the manual method regardless of the biological variation
embedded inside the datasets (Fig. 6A and B). Furthermore, it
also detects far more waiting time and bond lifetime events than
the descriptive method (Fig. 6C and D). Possible reasons for the
descriptive method to capture less events include the following:
ﬁrst, the calculation of sliding standard deviation 090 may not
resolve short bonds if their lifetimes are shorter than the chosen
length of the sliding window. Thus, the calculation mixes both
bound and unbound observations, which may miss many waiting
times and short bond lifetime events; second, the decision rule
(bound versus unbound) of the descriptive statistical method
heavily relies on an empirical threshold. In most cases, this
threshold will be manually drawn in a conservative way to
avoid false positive annotation caused by noise. Because the
reduction of variance by bond formation is relatively small and
may not be detected sometimes, the manual method tends to
miss bonds when experimental noise is not well controlled.

Aside from its advantage of robustness in prediction (Fig. 7),
the HMM method is more convenient and requires less learning
times than the descriptive method (Fig. 8). The comparison was
made after an automated prescreening process to eliminate erro-
neous data resulted from the experimental errors, drifting and
noises (Fig. 2). It should be noted that the HMM method shares
the same biophysical rationales as the descriptive method, but
provides the statistical basis to computerize the manual analysis.
Yet, it requires on average 30 s for the HMM to ﬁnish annota-
tion of one data trace but it takes 5 min for the manual method
to do so (Figs 1C and 3A).

Although the proposed HMM is motivated by the study of
thermal ﬂuctuation experiments, it can be directly applied to
different types of studies in bioinformatics (Koshi and
Goldstein, 2001). Based on the proposed HMM method, exten-
sions to higher orders models with unknown number of states
(Y. Hung et al., submitted for publication) can be made.
Therefore, such a framework is particularly attractive in the
study of computational biology such as the analysis of gene ex-
pression (Seifert et al., 2011), protein and DNA sequences
(Marioni et al., 2006), where the conventional ﬁrst-order
HMM is not sufﬁcient (Seifert, 2013). The HMM method de-
veloped in this article is also applicable to other areas, including
signal processing (Chambaz et al., 2009; Kaleh and Vallet, 1994)
and environmental science (Hughes and Guttorp, 1994).

For future work, we will include the receptors of two or mul-
tiple species on a cell and study the cooperative binding of mul-
tiple receptors. Unlike a bead target, a cell target is characterized
by its soft membrane and instant mobility. Thus, more noise is
expected in a cell system than in a puriﬁed protein system. The
next-generation algorithm should be more powerful in correcting
thermal ﬂuctuation drifting and noise caused by a restless cell
surface. Moreover, multiple receptors will bring in more complex
binding kinetics or multiple states such as unbound, receptor-1
bound, receptor-2 bound and cooperative bound states. To dis-
criminate these states, this method requires higher sensitivity.
We hope that continuous improvement of the HMM-based
algorithm will allow us to shed new light on examining protein
interactions on the single-molecule level.

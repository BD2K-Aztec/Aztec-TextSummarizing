Abstract

Summary: The anisotropic network model (ANM) is one of the simplest yet powerful tools for
exploring protein dynamics. Its main utility is to predict and visualize the collective motions of large
complexes and assemblies near their equilibrium structures. The ANM server, introduced by us in
2006 helped making this tool more accessible to non—sophisticated users. We now provide a new
version (ANM 2.0), which allows inclusion of nucleic acids and ligands in the network model and
thus enables the investigation of the collective motions of protein—DNA/RNA and —|igand systems.
The new version offers the flexibility of defining the system nodes and the interaction types and
cutoffs. It also includes extensive improvements in hardware, software and graphical interfaces.
Availability and implementation: ANM 2.0 is available at http://anm.csb.pitt.edu

1 Introduction

The last decade has seen a remarkable increase in the number of
studies that explore biomolecular systems dynamics using coarse—
grained normal mode analysis, prompted by the introduction and es—
tablishment of elastic network models (ENMs). ENMs are efficient
and accurate frameworks for robust predictions of cooperative,
often functional, movements under equilibrium conditions (Bahar
et 61]., 2010). More recently the low frequency modes predicted by
ENMs were further shown to be useful in applications that extend
beyond equilibrium motions, such as efficient sampling of conform-
ational space, mapping of trajectories between known states, struc—
ture refinement and molecular docking (see, e.g. Das et 61]., 2014;
Eyal et 61]., 2011; Hu et 61]., 2013; Leis and Zacharias, 2011;
Meireles et 61]., 2011; Ostermeir and Zacharias, 2014; Peng et 61].,
2010; Rueda et 61]., 2009; Schroder et 61]., 2007). A series of web ser—
vers have been developed to assist in the evaluation of normal modes
either at atomic level [e.g. MoViES (Cao et 61]., 2004), NOMAD—Ref
(Lindahl et 61]., 2006) and NMSim (Kruger et 61]., 2012)], or at a
coarse—grained level, often using ENMs [e.g. ElNémo (Suhre and
Sanejouand, 2004), WEBnm@ (Hollup et 61]., 2005), iGNM (Yang
et 61]., 2005), AD—ENM (http://enm.lobos.nih.gov), and Promode
Elastic (Wako and Endo, 2011)].

Among ENMs, the anisotropic network model (ANM) and
similar residue—based spring—and—node models, introduced 15 years
ago (Atilgan et 61]., 2001; Doruker et 61]., 2000; Hinsen, 1998;
Sanejouand and Tama, 2001), have found wide applications in
molecular and structural biology due to their simplicity, yet proved
successful for predicting the directions of large—scale functional
motions in accord with experimental observations (Bahar et 61].,
2011; Bakan et 61]., 2009). Despite the simple theory behind
the model, applying the code and exploring the results require
some knowledge in command line scripting and molecular graphics.
The ANM server, we introduced in 2006 (Eyal et 61]., 2006)
was also intended to fill this gap for users with little background in
computational biology. It essentially allowed exploration of
the dynamics in one button click—upon inputting the name of the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) file (or coordinate files in PDB format) of
the structure of interest.

Nine years later, we now present an improved version, ANM
2.0, of the server, which includes, alongside with hardware and soft—
ware upgrades, significant improvement in the functionality and
capabilities of the site, in particular the extension from proteins-
only to biomolecular complexes and assemblies with DNA, RNA
and ligands.

Fig. 1. Some of the new features of ANM 2.0 web server: The new version is now applicable to nucleotide-containing structures. A snapshot of p53 bound to DNA
(PDB 3005) is displayed by backbone stick representation (a) as well as network representation (b). Each nucleotide is represented by three nodes in this default
setting, with a uniform 15A cutoff distance. (c) Versatility of the server for defining network nodes and assigning atom-specific interaction ranges. (d) Interactive
representation of anisotropic ADPs as color-coded ellipsoids, supported by Jmol version 13.0.16. The ADPs computed for streptavidin (PDB 1STP) are shown.

This PDB file contains no experimental data on ADPs

2 The ANM 2.0 interface

The most important new feature is the option to now construct net—
work models for structures which include nucleotides and small
molecule/ligands, and thus visualize the collective dynamics of
broader range of bio—molecular structures (Fig. 1a and b). By default
each nucleotide is represented in the network by three nodes, pos—
itioned at the P atom of the phosphate group, C4’ in the base and
C2 in the sugar ring. This model has been shown (Yang et al., 2006)
to have superior predictive abilities, based on the comparison with
experimental B—factors using 64 oligonucleotide/protein complexes,
and on case studies such as the application of ANM to describe ribo—
somal dynamics (Wang et al., 2004). The server additionally pro—
vides the option of adopting different numbers of user—defined
atoms for representing the nucleotide nodes. Small ligands can also
be explicitly included in the ANM analysis. Ligands, if present in the
PDB coordinates file, will be automatically parsed and mapped by
the server into network nodes (Fig. 1c).

To support the above changes, the server applies a new strategy
that enables ﬂexibility in the definition of network nodes and cutoff
distances of interaction. The cutoff distance of interaction, re, now de—
pends on the identity of interacting atoms. For each atom type i, an
associated distance range of interaction, ti, is assigned. For each pair
of atom types 1', j the cutoff distance 7C is defined as ti—l—tj. This defin-
ition implies that the number of parameters in the system is bound by
the number of different atom types. In the simplest case where we
wish a unified threshold distance 7C for all atom types, as in the trad—
itional ANM, we simply assign ti : 7C /2 for all atom types we would
like to include. The server suggests 7C: 15 by default, as a com—
promise between better agreement with isotropic B—factors, obtained
in larger cutoffs (Eyal et al., 2006) and more realistic anisotropic dis—
placement parameters (ADPs) obtained using lower cutoffs (Eyal
et al., 2007). The selection of specific and non—standard nodes is tech—
nically done using the ‘advanced input’ page, accessible from the
ANM home page, following the selection of a structure file.

Another important improvement is the addition of Matlab
(MathWorks) as the method of choice for eigenvalue decomposition
for a subset of normal modes. We use the eigs function which is the
Matlab interface to the ARPACK package (Lehoucq et al., 1998) to
evaluate a selected subset of eigenvalues and eigenvectors from a
sparse matrix. This allows now to change the number of modes to
be calculated online. More modes than the (earlier) default number
of 20 can be evaluated and visualized if needed. Conversely, fewer
modes can also be requested, especially for large systems, to increase
efficiency. Blzpack (http://crd—legacy.lbl.gov/~osni/#Software), the

eigenvalue decomposer of ANM version 1.0 can still be used to cal—
culate a fix number (20) of modes as an alternative method.

The server now produces .xyz coordinates file to support the
visualization of vibrations along different directions in Jmol. This
format is simpler and more widely used than the Gamess file which
was in use in the original ANM server. Gamess file is still produced
by the new server and can be downloaded. The new ANM server
also enjoys the many new capabilities developed by Jmol (http://
www.jmol.org) molecular graphics team since the previous version.
Most notably and related to ANM, Jmol supports now interactive
visualization of ADPs as ellipsoids framing the spatial location of
atoms within a defined percentile of the Gaussian distribution.
ADPs are a byproduct of ANM calculations (Eyal et al., 2007) and
we now offer such interactive representation in the ADP part of the
results. The server also presents static images produced by Raster3D
(Merritt and Bacon, 1997). A convenient option to take screenshots
and save them locally in jpg format was added, as saving images dir—
ectly from the applet is not yet supported. Other improvements in
the graphical user interfaces, such as the more convenient navigation
in the correlation maps and the inter—residue distance ﬂuctuation
maps permit a direct assessment of structural regions subject to
distinctive cross—correlations as well as those that are highly
decoupled.

In the new version, the user has the additional option of import—
ing external data, e.g. submitting the principal modes that have been
calculated with another method, and take advantage of the easy and
powerful GUI of the server for visualizing the modes of motions and
the cross—correlations between residue motions. The dimensions of
these uploaded vectors must match the number of system nodes
defined by the user.

Finally, the new server now enjoys 128 GB of RAM which
allows for better performance for analyzing the collective motions
of large molecules. Software versions currently being used are:
Matlab R2014a, Jmol 13.0.16, Raster3D 3.02. Most of the envelope
and cgi code is written in Perl 5.18. We also added the core C and
Matlab code for inclusion of nucleic acids and ligand atoms into the
source distribution packages available at: http://anm.csb.pitt.edu/

ABSTRACT

Summary: We have developed Cake, a bioinformatics software pipe-
line that integrates four publicly available somatic variant-calling algo-
rithms to identify single nucleotide variants with higher sensitivity and
accuracy than any one algorithm alone. Cake can be run on a high-
performance computer cluster or used as a stand-alone application.
Availabilty: Cake is open-source and is available from http://cakeso
matic.sourceforge.net/

1 INTRODUCTION

The development of next-generation sequencing technologies has
made it possible to generate more comprehensive catalogues of
somatic alterations in cancer genomes than ever before. Software
tools to ﬁnd these variants deploy different mathematical
approaches to interrogate the genome sequences of tumour/
germline paired samples. For example, the variant detectors
Bambino (Edmonson et al., 2011) and VarScan 2 (Koboldt
et al., 2012) both identify somatic variants by comparing alter-
native allele frequencies between tumour and normal sequences.
VarScan 2 uses a Fisher’s exact test and Bambino a Bayesian
scoring model to identify somatic variants in paired samples.
Other algorithms include CaVEMan (Stephens et al., 2012)
and SAMtools mpileup (Li et al., 2009), which compute the
genotype likelihood of nucleotide positions in tumour and
normal genome sequences by use of an expectation-maximiza-
tion method.

Putative raw variant calls made by these algorithms typically
undergo further ﬁltering. For example, known single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) present in dbSNP (Sherry et al., 2001) or
in the 1000 Genomes project (The 1000 Genomes Project
Consortium et al., 2012), or sites with low mapping qualities
are usually ﬁltered from the ﬁnal somatic call set. Validation
rates ultimately depend on the stringency of this ﬁltering of
putative sites.

Intriguingly, applying different variant-calling algorithms to
the same data often results in a set of only partially overlapping
somatic single nucleotide variant (SNV) calls. To illustrate this
phenomenon, we deployed four publicly available somatic

variant-calling algorithms (Bambino, CaVEMan, SAMtools
mpileup and VarScan 2) on a dataset composed of 24 human
hepatocellular carcinoma tumour/germline exome pairs
(Guichard et al., 2012). Because this study reported 994 validated
somatic variants identiﬁed using the independent CASAVA
pipeline, we used these data to gauge the performance of each
algorithm. This analysis revealed at best a 43.8% overlap
between SNV calls made by any two of these widely used callers,
and at worst a 6.45% overlap (Supplementary Table S1).
Notable, however, was the fact that the majority of validated
calls were identiﬁed by two or more algorithms, suggesting
that a merging approach may improve both the sensitivity and
accuracy of somatic variant calling. See the Supplementary
Material for details.

In an effort to take advantage of existing software tools and to
improve variant detection, we developed Cake (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Cake is a fully conﬁgurable bioinformatics pipeline that
integrates four single nucleotide somatic variant-calling algo-
rithms (Bambino, CaVEMan, SAMtools mpileup, and
VarScan 2) and deploys an extensive collection of fully custom-
izable post-processing ﬁltering steps. We show that the perform-
ance of Cake exceeds any one algorithm for somatic SNV
detection, making it an optimal tool for cancer genome analysis.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Cake is implemented in Perl, enabling the conﬁguration, execu-
tion and monitoring of the four callers in a high-performance
computing environment using a job scheduler. Alternatively,
Cake can be conﬁgured to run in stand-alone mode on a single
computer (See the User Manual on SourceForge for more
details). The standard Cake workﬂow is to run all of the algo-
rithms individually, merge the predicted SNVs reported by at
least any two (Supplementary Fig. S2) somatic callers and then
apply the post-processing ﬁlters. This conﬁguration can, how-
ever, be easily adjusted as required (Supplementary Table S2).
The existing choice of algorithms can also be modiﬁed using a
template we provide. A package containing wrappers around the
callers, the post-processing modules and an installation script is
available for download.

3 RESULTS

To evaluate the performance of Cake, we used the aforemen-
tioned human hepatocellular carcinoma dataset composed of
24 exome tumour/germline pairs and two human breast cancer
exomes for which we had genomic DNA for follow-up validation

(Stephens et al., 2012). The performance of each variant-calling
algorithm was evaluated by running each one individually using
their default settings and ﬁltering the results using the post-pro-
cessing ﬁlters implemented in Cake. The results are summarized
in Table 1.

3.1 Human hepatocellular carcinoma dataset

In their study, Guichard et al. (2012) experimentally validated
850 SNV positions, of which 8 were not covered by sequence
reads following realignment leaving a target reference set of 842.
Using Cake with an intersection of any two or more algorithms,
812 validated variants were retained (Supplementary Fig. S3),
representing an overall sensitivity of 96.4%. An average of 634
variants was predicted per exome (Table 1). Cake outperformed
the best single algorithm in terms of speciﬁcity and the number
of variants reported per sample.

3.2 Human breast cancer exome dataset

Because the above analysis will favour callers that perform like
CASAVA, and because we did not have DNA from the hepato-
cellular carcinomas for follow-up analysis to ascertain the false
positive and negative rates, we next used exome data from two
breast tumours for which whole genome ampliﬁed tumour and
germline DNA was in hand. Using Cake and an intersection of
any two or more callers, we made 1225 calls (per sample
613 :l: 42), of which 254 were from a reference call set represent-
ing a subset of positions (264) covered by the capture baits where
a somatic mutation had resulted in a non-synonymous change; a
sensitivity of 96.2% (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. S4). Excluding
CaVEMan, which was used in the original study, Cake again
outperformed all other algorithms (Table 1).

To assess the speciﬁcity of the somatic variant calling by Cake,
we used the Sequenom MassARRAY SNP genotyping platform
on tumour and germline DNA samples. A total of 400 variants
were randomly selected from the 1225 calls made by any two or
more callers in the Cake pipeline, 200 from each sample. Two
hundred and seventy variants were validated, including 95 som-
atic mutations conﬁrmed in the original study, 111 somatic

mutation that were not described previously and 64 germline
variants (Supplementary Fig. S5). Importantly, we called
variants in a greater target region than the original study by
analyzing positions in 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions, and introns.
Six additional non-synonymous SNVs were discovered and con-
ﬁrmed (Supplementary Table 3), including variants in AKAPI,
PCN T and RERE, all of which have been implicated in cancer.

A further 400 variants were included as a true negative set
resulting in a worst-case accuracy for Cake of 75.8%
[Accuracy 2 (95 + 111 + 400) /(400 + 400)]. Although we used
our default of at least any two callers as part of the aforemen-
tioned analysis, 88.3% of positions that validated as somatic
variants were reported by all four algorithms used by Cake
(Supplementary Fig. S5, Table 1). This indicates that merging
predictions increases the probability of identifying true muta-
tions. Thus, we demonstrate that Cake may be used to help pri-
oritize somatic SNVs calls for follow-up validation.

4 SUMMARY

Here we describe Cake, a software tool integrating four somatic
variant detection algorithms to call variants with higher accuracy
and speciﬁcity than any one algorithm alone. Cake performs well
on whole genomes, exomes and targeted next-generation
sequencing data, as well as on both human and mouse samples.
Cake is freely available to the research community.

Abstract

Summary: Oasis is a web application that allows for the fast and flexible online analysis of small-
RNA-seq (sRNA-seq) data. It was designed for the end user in the lab, providing an easy-to-use
web frontend including video tutorials, demo data and best practice step-by-step guidelines on
how to analyze sRNA-seq data. Oasis’ exclusive selling points are a differential expression module
that allows for the multivariate analysis of samples, a classification module for robust biomarker
detection and an advanced programming interface that supports the batch submission of jobs.
Both modules include the analysis of novel miRNAs, miRNA targets and functional analyses includ-
ing GO and pathway enrichment. Oasis generates downloadable interactive web reports for easy
visualization, exploration and analysis of data on a local system. Finally, Oasis’ modular workflow
enables for the rapid (re-) analysis of data.

Availability and implementation: Oasis is implemented in Python, R, Java, PHP, C++ and

 

JavaScript. It is freely available at http://oasis.dzne.de.

1 Introduction

Small RNAs play pivotal roles in many biological processes, ranging
from organismal development to disease states including cancer. As
such, they have gained recent interest not only in basic research, but
also as therapeutic targets and biomarkers of disease in clinical set-
tings (Witwer, 2014).

The current method of choice for small RNA analysis is deep
sequencing, which allows for the comprehensive charting of small
RNAs at a reasonable price. Consequently, it is not the generation
of data but the subsequent analysis that is usually limiting. To this
end several web applications have been developed that allow for the
analysis of small-RNA-seq (sRNA-seq) data. Especially recent add-
itions to the small RNA analysis landscape convince with their user
friendliness, analysis portfolio and their performance. These include

MAGI (Kim et al., 2014), an all-in-one application featuring struc-
tured interactive output, ISRNA (Luo et al., 2014) which combines
powerful search functionality with an online project database and
CPSS (Zhang et al., 2012) a web application that detects miRNA
edits and modifications.

Although many good web platforms for the analysis of sRNA-
seq data exist some important analysis features have yet to be
integrated. For example, no current web application allows for
multivariate data analysis, including multi-group comparisons and
the incorporation of covariate and interaction information. Also,
there is currently no web application that allows for the identifica-
tion of biomarkers of disease via integrated machine-learning
modules. Finally, current sRNA-seq web services do not allow for
automated analysis or batch submission of jobs via an advanced

programming interface (API), a feature that would greatly facilitate
analysis workﬂows for frequent users. In the end, these functional-
ities should be paired with a solid prediction of novel miRNAs, their
targets and functional analyses using gene ontology and pathway
enrichment.

2 Design and Key Features

Oasis addresses all of these restrictions in a user-friendly, modular
analysis environment. The standard workflow comprises the com-
pression of FASTQ files on the user’s local system and their upload
for subsequent small RNA detection and sample quality assessment
(sRNA Detection module). The sRNA Detection module aligns
reads to the genome, annotates known small RNA species and pre-
dicts novel miRNAs for all the sequences that do not map to anno-
tated small RNAs. The output of the sRNA Detection module
generates downloadable, interactive web reports that contain quality
plots, detailed information on novel small RNAs, as well as count
files containing small RNA read counts for each sample.

These count files can then be uploaded to the differential expres-
sion (DE Analysis) or classification modules. Both modules provide
downloadable, interactive results in web reports, highlighting im-
portant small RNAs, deliver annotations, visualizations and tables
for subsequent analysis on a local computer.

The separation of the small RNA detection and quality assess-
ment from the functional analysis of data provides the user with two
main advantages. First, the user can have a careful look at sample
quality before the functional analysis. Good quality samples can be
chosen and uploaded for differential expression or classification and
bad quality samples can be dismissed. Although increasing the
hands-on—time of the user we deem this step absolutely essential, as
single outliers can severely impair the results of any following statis-
tical analyses. Second, due to the small size of the sample count files
Oasis allows for the very fast re-analysis of different subsets of sam-
ples or between different experiments.

In Table 1, we compare existing web services for sRNA-seq ana-
lysis to Oasis. We tried to provide an objective, comprehensive over-
view of features that we deem essential, important or beneficial, also
highlighting areas in which other tools provide better performance
than Oasis. Finally, the comparisons in Table 1 are limited to the

newer ‘second generation’ web applications that satisfy at least four
features we deem relevant. In the following section, we highlight the
most salient features of Oasis.

2.1 Data compression and server upload

Oasis features a standalone and platform-independent application
that allows for the compression of FASTQ files prior to their upload
to the server. OasisCompressor is written in Java and C++ and
takes two arguments, the input files and the output location. An
additional option is the number of parallel processes that
OasisCompressor will execute. The compression ratio of FASTQ
files depends on the entropy of samples but usually ranges between
200- and 800-fold. Once compressed samples can be rapidly up-
loaded from the client to the server using Oasis’ web frontend. The
technical details of OasisCompressor can be found in the
Supplementary material.

2.2 Interactive web reports

The results of all Oasis analysis modules are provided as download-
able, interactive web reports. These ]avaScript—empowered web re-
ports can be opened in the users local web browser and support
ﬂexible visualization and the interactive analysis of results. For ex-
ample, the HTML report containing differentially expressed small
RNAs can be interactively sorted, subset manually or by P value and
miRNA targets can be further analyzed for the functional enrichment
of categories. The programs for the functional enrichment can also be
interactively chosen, giving the user the ability to compute and visual-
ize enrichment for GO and KEGG using GzProfiler (Reimand et al.,
2011) or DAVID (Huang et al., 2007), protein—protein interaction
using GeneMANIA (Zuberi et al., 2013), STRING (Franceschini
et al., 2013) and STITCH (Kuhn et al., 2014) for varying P values
and small RNA lists, all in the local browser.

2.3 Multivariate differential expression

Oasis supports multivariate differential expression analysis of sam-
ples as implemented in the DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) package. This
includes multi-group comparisons and the incorporation of covari-
ate and interaction information. Thus, questions about the inter-
action of two or more factors can be asked, or the influence of
several covariates can be included in an analysis. A simple question

could be to examine the effect of a disease on small RNA expression,
while correcting for variations in age or medication (covariates).

2.4 Classification

Another unique feature of Oasis is the detection of biomarkers
using classification routines. The involvement of small RNAs in dis-
ease processes such as cancer has sparked considerable interest in
the use of small RNAs as therapeutic target or biomarker (Witwer,
2014). In Oasis, the user can easily detect small RNA biomarkers
using a Random Forest machine learner (Breiman, 2001). Random
Forests are inherently robust classifiers that have only two param-
eters of importance and are extremely stable over parameter space,
providing a simple yet powerful classification routine for the non-
technical user. As input, the classification routine takes the count
files of the sRNA Detection module, which again allows for a rapid
and ﬂexible (re-) analysis of samples due to the small size of the
count files.

2.5 Automated job submission

A prevalent bottleneck of sRNA-seq analyses on web servers is that
users are forced to manually upload samples and submit jobs. Oasis
supports the automated submission of jobs via an API. By using sim-
ple python scripts frequent users can automate analysis workflows
for every Oasis module, including the compression of FASTQ files
prior to data upload.

Finally, we compared the runtimes of Oasis and MAGI using
three different published sRNA-seq datasets and found that Oasis
performs favorable in all three instances (see Supplementary mater-
ial). Comparison of Oasis’ analysis results to published data shows
that Oasis detects 85% (11/13) of the differentially expressed
sRNAs that have been biologically validated (see Supplementary
material and Oasis’ demo page).

In summary, Oasis is a fast and flexible web application
for sRNA-seq data analysis that supports multivariate DE analysis
and classification. It allows for easy automation of jobs via
an API, provides aid to new users via tutorials and demo analyses
on published datasets and allows the user to interactively ana-
lyze results on his local computer. As such, Oasis should be a valu-
able addition to the landscape of sRNA-seq analysis web
applications.

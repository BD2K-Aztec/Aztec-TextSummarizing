ABSTRACT

Summary: Ka-me is a Voronoi image analyzer that allows users to
analyze any image with a convex polygonal tessellation or any spatial
point distribution by fitting Voronoi polygons and their dual, Delaunay
triangulations, to the pattern. The analytical tools include a variety of
graph theoretic and geometric tools that summarize the distribution
of the numbers of edges per face, areas, perimeters, angles
of Delaunay triangle edges (anglograms), Gabriel graphs, nearest
neighbor graphs, minimal spanning trees, Ulam trees, Pitteway tests,
circumcircles and convexhulls, as well as spatial statistics (Clark—
Evans Nearest Neighborhood and Variance to Mean Ratio) and
export functions for standard relationships (Lewis’s Law, Desch’s Law
and Aboav—Weaire Law).

Availability: Ka-me: a Voronoi image analyzer is available as an
executable with documentation and sample applications from the
BioQUEST Library (http://bioquest.org/downloads/kame_1.0.rar).

Important recent work in computational biology (Bock et al.,
2010; Gibson et al., 2006; Mulder, 2008; Patel et al., 2009) on
dividing epithelia has focused on the analysis of convex polygonal
tessellations, yet no tool exists for doing standard geometric,
graph theoretic and spatial statistical analysis of such patterns. A
commonly occurring convex polygonal tessellation is a Voronoi
tessellation, whose cells are deﬁned as all points in the region
around a generator point that are closer to it than any other
generator point; thus, cell boundaries perpendicularly bisect the
planar space between two generator points. An extensive literature
exists on Voronoi tessellations in biology, astronomy, geography,
archeology and engineering (Okabe et al., 1992). Allometry and
fractals have captured the imagination of biologists as well as
amateurs because both apply across biological phenomena from
the molecular to the ecological level. Voronoi polygons and
polyhedra are less well known, but scale equally well across
phylogenetic, spatial and temporal dimensions. Elsewhere, we
claimed computational geometric and graph theory based around
Voronoi tessellations are particularly applicable in biology because
they work well on multiple spatial scales (from proteins to viral
capsids to single celled radiolaria to animal coat patterns to a
variety of fruits to ﬁsh territories to forest canopies), multiple

temporal scales (from nanoseconds of protein folding to eons
in fossilization of stony coral such as Petoski stones), multiple
phylogenetic scales (across viruses, bacteria, protozoans, plants,
fungi and animals) and multiple causes (such as diffusion, growth,
packing, competition, optimization, sorting and avoidance). Thus,
we developed a generally applicable tool that we call ‘Ka—me:
a Voronoi image analyzer’ for biological image analysis. Ka—me
is the Japanese word for turtle; turtle shells often have Voronoi
tessellations.

We (Khiripet et al., 2011) are generally interested in articulating
the close relationship between actual biological specimens and
causal theoretical models. Ka—me instantiates this approach
by allowing an investigator to choose among a diversity of
mathematical and statistical tools for testing causal hypotheses about
biological patterns. Ka—me allows the user to import a biological
image and then interactively (not automatically) ﬁt individual
Voronoi cells to match each convex polygon in the tessellation
(Fig. 1). Ka—me uses a quad—edge data structure that allows this
to occur instantaneously. Once an image has been completely
tessellated, then other analyses are appropriate to examine. We only
report statistics for those cells that lie within the convex hull because
cells on the periphery often have inﬁnite areas or an indeterminate
number of edges.

Our choice of tool sets was informed by such disciplines as
developmental biology, ecology, ethology, forestry and clinical
pathology. We have included as many of the tools as have seemed
proﬁtable in previous studies without overwhelming users or
severely cluttering the user interface. The analytical tools include
a variety of graph theoretic and geometric tools that summarize the
distribution of the numbers of edges per face, areas, perimeters,
angles of Delaunay triangle edges (anglograms), Gabriel graphs,
nearest neighbor graphs, minimal spanning trees, Ulam trees,
Pitteway tests, circumcircles and convex hulls, as well as spatial
statistics (Clark—Evans Nearest Neighborhood and Variance to Mean
Ratio) and export functions for standard relationships (Lewis’s Law,
Desch’s Law and Aboav—Weaire Law).

Ka—me has been applied to ﬁve different kinds of basic biological
questions. (1) Spatial point distributions of a single species:
John Snow’s map of a cholera outbreak in London (Jungck,
2012). Second order statistics like Ripley’s K —function and a
Monte Carlo conﬁdence envelope have been applied to mapped
affected individual households over ﬁve intervals of a dengue
fever outbreak in Argentina. (2) Spatial point distributions of two
entities: chi—squared tests (Diggle, 2003) on the occurrence of
three types of Delaunay triangulation edges have been used to
study successful and unsuccessful red—winged blackbirds nests in

Fig. 1. The Ka—me interface with a Thai breadfruit as the biological image. The distribution of 65 Voronoi cells is illustrated as a histogram of the number of
cells with a particular number of sides. From the ‘Point Pattern Analysis’, we can infer that the generator points used to make Voronoi cells matching polygonal
segments on the fruit’s surface are distributed slightly over—dispersed toward the limit of being fairly uniformly distributed, but not nearly as uniformly as
when all cells are hexagonal. The total number of generator points and Delaunay edges are listed in the lower left hand corner. In the lower right hand
corner, Pitteway is not highlighted because there are violations of the Pitteway criterion on the Delaunay triangulation. The Ulam tree graph (degree 2 3) is
superimposed on the image. More detail is not shown simply to avoid the limits of visual overload in one image

a prairie, on and off Amacrine cells in an eye layer, gall infested
versus non-infested Solidago canadensis plants, barnacles with
and without algae, tests of the self-thinning hypothesis for forests
of hickories, oaks and maples as well as old versus new canes
in raspberry brambles and Pyknotic versus metaphase nuclei in
hamster tumors. (3) Lewis’s Law (area versus number of sides),
Desch’s Law (perimeter versus number of sides) and Aboav—Weaire
Law (conservation of topological charge) were used to examine
convex polygonal tessellations in a variety of species: radiolaria,
plant pollen, Drosophila melanogaster eggs, Arabidopsis thaliana
embryos, apical meristems of Anagallis arvensis and petals of
Rosa glauca. With the development of ﬂuorescent stains for cell
membranes, extremely crisp images of polygonal tissue patterns are
appearing in contemporary literature. (4) Ten types of Delaunay
faces for topological charge distributions were tested on ﬁve
successive mitotic divisions in D.melan0gaster embryos. (5) Graph
theoretic analyses were performed on tongue cancers [Sudbo et al.
(2000) and Landini and Othman (2004) described the Ulam tree, a
Delaunay triangulation subgraph that was of signiﬁcant diagnostic

value] and interneurons [Minciacchi et al. (2009) found that, for
some measurements, the number of cells to be analyzed must exceed
more than 3000 cells—far more than a typical pathologist can do
by inspection]. We believe that Ka—me is the only software package
available that implements Ulam trees in an image analysis context as
well as robustly and easily perform other graph theoretic, geometric
and spatial statistical analyses. Between the built-in functions in
Ka—me and the exported data ﬁles generated by Ka—me is a broadly
applicable tool for analyzing biological images that range from
electron micrographs to ecological and epidemiological distribution
maps.

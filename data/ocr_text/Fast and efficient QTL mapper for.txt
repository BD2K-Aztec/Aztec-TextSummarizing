Abstract

Motivation: In order to discover quantitative trait loci, multi—dimensional genomic datasets com—
bining DNA—seq and ChiP—/RNA—seq require methods that rapidly correlate tens of thousands of
molecular phenotypes with millions of genetic variants while appropriately controlling for multiple
testing.

Results: We have developed FastQTL, a method that implements a popular cis—QTL mapping strat—
egy in a user— and cluster—friendly tool. FastQTL also proposes an efficient permutation procedure
to control for multiple testing. The outcome of permutations is modeled using beta distributions
trained from a few permutations and from which adjusted P—values can be estimated at any level of
significance with little computational cost. The Geuvadis & GTEX pilot datasets can be now easily
analyzed an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches.

1 Introduction

Genome—wide association studies have shown that most common
trait—associated variants fall into non—coding genomic regions and
likely alter gene regulation (Maurano et 61]., 2012; Nica et 61].,
2010). This has motivated large—scale studies to catalog candidate
regulatory variants (quantitative trait loci; QTLs) associated with
various molecular phenotypes (i.e. quantitative molecular traits with
a genomic location) across various populations (Lappalainen et 61].,
2013), cell (Fairfax et 61]., 2012) and tissue types (GTEX
Consortium, 2015; Ongen et 61]., 2014). Mapping QTLs in this con-
text usually consists of finding statistically significant associations
between phenotype quantifications and nearby genetic variants; task

commonly undertaken using linear regressions (GTEX Consortium,
2015). Alternative approaches have also been developed to increase
discovery power by accounting for confounding factors (Fusi et 61].,
2012), integrating functional annotations (Gaffney et 61]., 2012), lev—
eraging allelic imbalance (van de Geijn et 61]., 2015) or aggregating
measurements across multiple tissues (Flutre et 61]., 2013). In prac—
tice, this requires millions of association tests in order to scan all
possible phenotype—variant pairs in cis (i.e. variants located within a
specific window around a phenotype), resulting in millions of nom-
inal P—values. Matrix eQTL (Shabalin, 2012) has recently emerged
as a ‘gold standard’ for this task (GTEX Consortium, 2015;
Lappalainen et 61]., 2013) by taking advantage of efficient matrix

operation implementations to perform the many association tests in
acceptable running times. Due to the large number of tests per—
formed per phenotype, multiple testing has to be accounted for to
assess the significance of any discovered candidate QTL. A first
naive solution to this problem is to correct the nominal P—values for
the number of tested variants using the Bonferroni method.
However, due to the specific and highly variable nature of each gen—
omic region being tested in terms of allele frequency and linkage dis—
equilibrium (LD), the Bonferroni method usually proves to be overly
stringent and results in many false negatives. To overcome this issue,
a commonly adopted approach (Montgomery et al., 2010) is to ana—
lyze thousands of permuted datasets for each phenotype in order to
empirically characterize the null distribution of associations (i.e. the
distribution of P—values expected under the null hypothesis of no as—
sociations). Then, we can easily assess how likely an observed asso—
ciation obtained in the nominal pass originates from the null,
resulting in an adjusted P—value. In practice, performing permuta—
tions in this context requires fast methods able to absorb such sub—
stantial computational loads in reasonable running times. Even
though Matrix eQTL has been used so far in multiple large—scale
studies (GTEx Consortium, 2015; Lappalainen et al., 2013), it still
suffers from a main drawback which makes its practical application
relatively laborious and time consuming: there is no efficient built-in
permutation scheme forcing users to develop their own and there—
fore to use non—optimal multiple—testing correction methods. So far,
a commonly employed permutation strategy relies on performing a
fixed number of permutations per phenotype (1000—10 000) to con—
trol the running times at the cost of accurately assessing the statis—
tical significance of the most strongly associated QTLs. Here, we
present FastQTL, a user— and cluster—friendly QTL mapper, which
improves upon Matrix eQTL by implementing a fast and efficient
permutation scheme in which the null distribution of associations
for a phenotype is modeled using a beta distribution. This allows us
to approximate the tail of the null distribution relatively well using
only few permutations, and then to accurately estimate adjusted
P—values at any significance level in short running times.

2 Methods

2.1 Overview

FastQTL performs linear regressions between genotypes and mo—
lecular phenotypes with or without covariates in order to find the
best nominal association for each phenotype (see Section 2.2). Then,
it can correct for the multiple correlated variants tested via three dif—
ferent permutation schemes: (1) a direct permutation scheme that
relies on a fixed number of permutations (see Section 2.3), (2) an
adaptive permutation scheme which maintains a reasonable compu—
tational load by tailoring the number of permutations to the signifi-
cance of the association (see Section 2.4) and (3) a beta
approximation which models the permutation outcome via a beta
distribution (see Section 2.5). For (1) and (2), an adjusted P—value
per phenotype is calculated as the proportion of null associations
found to be more significant than the nominal one. For (3), we
model this null distribution of most significant P—values for a pheno—
type with a beta distribution, learning the parameters from a few
permutations (typically 100—1000) by maximum likelihood estima-
tion. As a result, we obtain a reasonably good approximation of the
tail of null distribution to estimate small adjusted P—values at any
significance level (i.e. without lower bound). In a final stage, a false
discovery rate (FDR) procedure as implemented in the R/qvalue
(Storey and Tibshirani, 2003) package is used on the set of adjusted

P—values obtained either from (1), (2) or (3) to extract all significant
phenotype—variant pairs at a given FDR, usually chosen to be 5% or
10% (see Section 2.6). All this, plus other optional functionalities,
have been implemented in the FastQTL software package (see
Section 2.7).

2.2 Finding a candidate QTL per phenotype

For simplicity, we will focus on a single molecular phenotype P
quantified in a set of N samples. Let G be the set of genotype dos—
ages at L variant sites located within a cis—window of i W Mb of
the genomic location of P. To discover the best candidate QTL for
P, FastQTL measures Pearson product—moment correlation coeffi—
cients between P and all L variants in G, stores the most strongly
correlated variant 6] E G as candidate QTL, and assesses its signifi—
cance by calculating a nominal P—value p” with standard significance
tests for Pearson correlation. Note that this is equivalent to testing
for ﬂ 75 0 in a linear model P= ﬁg + 6 with ﬂ estimated by least
squares fitting. Of note, this method is also used by Matrix eQTL to
speed up linear regression (Methods 3.1 86 3.2 of Shabalin, 2012).
Then, two multiple—testing levels are accounted for to determine the
whole-genome significance of this nominal P—value and thereby to
consider the corresponding variant 6] as a QTL: multiple genetic
variants are tested per phenotype and multiple phenotypes are tested
genome—wide. Following common usage, FastQTL uses permuta—
tions to correct for the former (see Sections 2.3—2.5) and FDR esti—
mation to control for the latter (see Section 2.6 ).

2.3 Direct permutation scheme

The choice of a proper global significance threshold for nominal
P—values is very difficult due to the fact that we test multiple variants
per phenotype, correlated because of LD, across a wide allele
frequency spectrum, while all this varies from one phenotype to an—
other. To account for this, significance of a candidate QTL is as—
sessed via permutations. Specifically, we repeat the cis—window scan
procedure for R random permutations of P, leaving the genotype
data G unchanged to preserve the correlation between variants.
Each time, we store the strongest correlation; the goal is to produce
a sample from the distribution of the strongest correlation under the
complete null hypothesis of no genetic associations. Then, the
observed correlation is compared with this empirical null distribu-
tion to obtain an adjusted P—value characterizing the significance of
the candidate QTL. When very few null correlations are found to be
stronger than the observed one, it means that reaching this correl-
ation level by chance is very unlikely and therefore that the QTL
candidate is likely to be true. More formally, if r correlations in the
null distribution are found to be stronger than the observed, signifi—
cance of the QTL candidate is assessed by calculating the following
empirical adjusted P—value pd of association (Phipson and Smyth,
2010h

_r—I—1
pd_R+1

 

(1)

By definition, such an adjusted P—value cannot be smaller than
1/(R + 1); meaning that a large number of permutations are needed
to get precise estimates of small adjusted P—values, thereby increas—
ing the computational burden. For instance, reaching P—values of
~10_3 requires thousands of permutations while billions are needed
to get P—values of ~10_9. In practice, it is very difficult to go beyond
a few thousand permutations genome—wide with this approach,
which forces us to work with adjusted P—values in the range of 10—3
to 1.0. To alleviate this limitation, we improved the direct

permutation scheme with two complementary methods (see Sections
2.4 and 2.5 

2.4 Adaptive permutation scheme
From Equation (1), one can see that good estimation of insignificant
adjusted P—values can be achieved with few permutations while
many more are needed to estimate highly significant ones.
Therefore, we implemented an alternative permutation scheme that
adapts the number of permutations to the significance level of the
variant—phenotype pairs (Hubner et al., 2005). The resulting ap—
proach saves time at insignificant hits and invests more for signifi-
cant ones, thereby maintaining a reasonable overall computational
cost. Specifically, this adaptive scheme permutes P until a given
number B (typically 100) of null correlations stronger than the
observed one are found. To prevent this strategy running too long
for the most significant variant—phenotype pairs, the algorithm can—
not perform more than M (typically 100 000) permutations in total.
Then, an adjusted P—value of association for a candidate QTL is
derived using:
min 7,3 —l— 1
pa : min((R,]\/i) —l— 1 (2)

This strategy still remains unable to provide adjusted P—values
below 1/(M + 1), though M can scale up to 100 000 in practice and
thus provide good estimations for adjusted P—values down to
~1o—5.

2.5 Beta approximation

To provide adjusted P—values at any significance level without actu—
ally performing all required permutations, we developed an approxi—
mation method based on the beta distribution. It is well established
that order statistics of independent uniformly distributed random
variables are beta—distributed (Jones, 2009). Therefore, we hypothe—
sized that the P—values obtained through permutations are also beta—
distributed (Dudbridge and Koeleman, 2004). More formally, the
let/7 smallest value obtained when independently drawing n times
from the uniform is distributed as:

U N Beta(/e, n) (3)

In our particular problem, we propose to model the smallest
nominal P-value coming from L tests performed in a permutation
pass as a beta distributed random variable with shape parameters k
= 1 and n = L. However, given that nearby variant sites usually ex—
hibit some relatively high degree of correlation (LD), the L tests per—
formed are not independent, implying that the effective number of
tests n is lower than the actual number L of variants in cis. Instead
of fixing the k and n parameters a priori, we use a more ﬂexible ap—
proach in which the parameters are estimated by maximum likeli-
hood (Galwey, 2009). Specifically, we perform R permutations to
generate a null set of P—values {p1, . . ., [JR] and then estimate k and
n by maximizing the following log-likelihood:

R R
L(k,n|p1,...,pR)=(k—1)E lnpr+(n—1)E Ina—pr)
r=1 r=1

11/011”)
— Rlnl rum)
(4)
Note that this maximization is done using standard numerical

methods implemented in GNU Scientific Library. The underlying
idea of this approach is to characterize the extreme tail of the null

distribution without directly sampling from it, something that
would entail a huge computational burden. Finally, we can approxi-
mate an adjusted P—value 1);, from the best nominal P—value p” and
from the maximum likelihood (ML) fitted beta distribution with:

Pb=P(USPn) (5)

2.6 False discovery rate

Since thousands of molecular phenotypes are tested genome—wide,
an FDR correction is commonly applied. This estimates the propor—
tion of false positive findings, known as the FDR, by comparing the
number of hits declared to the number that would be expected by
chance. The Benjamini—Hochberg (BH) procedure (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995) is one way of controlling the number of false posi—
tive results. However, this is too conservative in most of the QTL
studies where we expect a substantial fraction of the phenotypes to
be affected by genetic variants. To account for this, it is recom-
mended instead the use of the FDR procedure described by Storey
and Tibshirani (ST) (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003) which fits particu—
larly well in this context. The ST procedure assumes that the set of
association tests originates from a mixture of both the null and the
alternative hypothesis and estimates n0, defined as the proportion of
hypotheses for which the null is true. Implicitly, the BH procedure
assumes n0 is 1, whereas the ST procedure learns it from the data,
resulting in more statistically significant hits. Of note, the adjusted
P—values provided by FastQTL allow the users to easily apply which—
ever multiple testing correction they favor, from FDR to Bonferroni,
since it provides adjusted P—values well calibrated on the full P—value

range.

2.7 Implementation

FastQTL implements in C—I——I— (see Sections 2.1—2.5) to provide an
adjusted P—value per phenotype. An FDR procedure (see Section 2.6)
is then straightforward to apply on the FastQTL output. In addition
to the functionalities described above, FastQTL also implements
some additional useful features worth mentioning here:

(1) To make the method more robust to outliers in the phenotype
data, FastQTL has an option that allows to quantile normalize the
phenotype quantifications prior to any analysis. This ensures that
phenotype quantifications are normally distributed with mean 0 and
standard deviation 1. Quantile normalization is implemented as in
the R/mtmnsform function of the GenABEL package (Aulchenko
et al., 2007).

(2) Confounding factors such as population stratification and ex—
perimental batch effects have to be considered to prevent spurious
associations. To do so, FastQTL can residualize both the genotypes
and the phenotypes for quantitative and/or qualitative covariates
prior to any association testing.

(3) FastQTL uses standard file formats: genotype dosages and
phenotype quantifications are specified in Variant Calling Format
and UCSC BED format, respectively. All files are required to be
indexed with Tabix (Li, 201 1) to enable fast retrieval of specific gen—
omic regions.

(4) To split a genome—wide analysis into non—overlapping chunks
and to run each on a distinct CPU core, FastQTL includes a set of
user—friendly options. It can either split the data into a given number
of chunk (--chunk 12 200 to run chunk 12 out of 200) or focus on a
particular user defined genomic region (——region 20:1—1000000).
The phenotype and genotype data included in the genomic region is
then automatically extracted from the cis—window size and analyzed.
A simple loop going through all possible chunks allows the user to

permutations (line 5). The full outcome is constructed by concate—
nating the per—chunk outcomes (line 8).

3. Results

To perform a comprehensive evaluation of FastQTL, we used RNA—
seq and genotype data produced by both the Geuvadis (Lappalainen
et al., 2013; Supplementary material 1) and the GTEX consortia
(GTEx Consortium, 2015; Supplementary material 2), two of the

largest eQTL studies performed to date. This comprises a total of 10
distinct datasets with between 14 and 35K quantified genes
and 6.8—10.8M variant sites for 83—373 samples (Supplementary
Table 1).

In the context of this study, the two parameters of the beta distri—
bution, k and n, can be interpreted as the rank of the associated vari—
ant and the effective number of independent tests performed in cis,
respectively. We looked at the ML estimate distributions of these par—
ameters across all genes in the GEUV_EUR dataset and find first that
parameter k values tend to center around 1.0, in line with what is ex-
pected for the top variant (Fig. 1a). Second, we find that the param—
eter n values show high dispersion (Fig. 1b) and are consistently
smaller than the actual number of variants being tested in cis (Fig. 1c);
both suggesting that the beta distribution captures well the redundan—
cies between variants, a consequence of LD. This also highlights the
importance of performing permutations instead of using a Bonferroni
correction based on the number of variants, which would result in a
substantial proportion of false negative results.

Then, we checked whether the null P—values coming from permu-
tations are beta distributed again in the GEUV_EUR dataset. To do
so, we (1) stored for each phenotype the best P—values obtained from
1000 permutations as observations, (2) estimated k and n by ML
from the 1000 resulting P—values, (3) simulated 1000 P—values from
the newly parameterized beta distribution as expectations and (4)
compared both observations and expectations to assess their

goodness—of—fit visually (QQ—plots) and statistically (one sample
Kolmogorov—Smirnov test). Overall, we find very high degrees of
concordance between results; both when pooling all genes together
(Fig. 1d) and also when looking at each gene individually (Fig. 1e).

We only find that the beta distribution is not a good fit for two
genes out of the 13 703 tested (Fig. 1f), these discrepancies are likely
due to the stochastic nature of the simulations made in step (3). All
this shows that the beta distribution is a good fit for the smallest
null P—values generated via permutations and therefore a good can—
didate to model the permutation process outcome.

We next checked that the adjusted P—values produced via beta ap—
proximation are well calibrated by comparing them to those directly
derived from a large number of permutations. We find a very good
concordance on the full P—value range with some deviations within
the expected sampling variation range (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig.
1a and b). Of note, the beta approximation provides small adjusted
P—values that are better calibrated than those provided by the direct
method (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 1c and d) and sometimes not
even accessible (i.e. below the lower bound implied by the number
of permutations); the smallest adjusted P—value estimated using the
GEUV_EUR dataset is in the order of ~10_128 (Supplementary Fig.
2). Therefore, we subsequently estimated the number of permuta—
tions that the direct method needs to reach the same level of

 

 

 

 

calibration as the beta approximation at various significance levels.
To do so, we binned the adjusted P—values obtained from beta ap—
proximations and estimated for each bin, by exhaustive search, the
number of permutations required by the direct method to match the
same sampling variation (Supplementary material 3). We find that
this number drastically increases as small—adjusted P—values are tar—
geted (Fig. 2c). For instance, beta approximations made from 1000
permutations give adjusted P—values of 10_4 as accurately as the dir—
ect approach with ~50K permutations.

Then, we looked at the downstream impact of the beta approxi—
mation on QTL discovery. To do so, we first generated an optimal
5% FDR eQTL set for GEUV_EUR by running 100 000
permutations and then measured the sensitivity/specificity ratios of
reasonable FastQTL configurations to recover this optimal set.
Specifically, we run from 50 to 5000 permutations using either
the beta approximation or the direct method to compute adjusted
P—values. We find that using 500—5000 permutations allows us to
approximate well the optimal set (Fig. 2d).

We also find that the beta approximation does consistently bet—
ter than the direct method for the same number of permutations,
especially when few permutations are used (50 or 100). As a conse—
quence, using 500 permutations with the beta approximation, for
example, has the same accuracy to recover the optimal set as the

Table 1 shows the running times in CPU hours to produce the results
shown in Figure 2e; nine GTEx datasets (column 1) processed with 1000
Matrix eQTL permutations (column 2) and FastQTL with 1000 (column 3),
500 (column 4) and 100 permutations (column 5 ). Total running times for all
nine datasets together are shown in the last row.

direct method using 1000 permutations. Interestingly, the beta ap—
proximation using only 5 0/ 1 00 permutations already does very well
at recovering the optimal eQTL set.

Finally, we investigated the speed and accuracy with which
Matrix eQTL (direct method) and FastQTL (beta approximation)
using 100, 500 and 1000 permutations could reproduce the outcome
of the pilot phase of GTEX; a large—scale eQTL mapping study. Of
note, we run Matrix eQTL in the most highly effective setting we
could achieve in order to fully utilize its matrix based design
(Supplementary material 4). Overall, we find that both FastQTL and
Matrix eQTL recapitulate the official eQTL set well, especially as the
number of permutations increases (Fig. 2e). For the same number of
permutations, we find that the closest eQTL set to the official one is
consistently provided by FastQTL. Again, it also performs well even
when only 100 permutations are used to fit the beta distributions. To
process all nine datasets with 1000 permutations, FastQTL requires
N191 CPU hours which is ~16 times faster than running the same
number of permutations with Matrix eQTL (Table 1). When using
only 100 permutations, this is reduced to only ~33 CPU hours.

4. Conclusion

We present FastQTL, a QTL mapper in cis for molecular pheno-
types that implements a new permutation scheme to accurately and
rapidly correct for multiple—testing at both the genotype and pheno—
type levels. FastQTL has several advantages compared with existing
methods, making it the ideal candidate to map QTLs for the coming
wave of large—scale datasets regrouping many different layers of mo-
lecular phenotypes and near complete collection of variant sites.
First, permutations are modeled with a beta distribution, parameter—
ized from a relatively small number of permutations. This results in
accurate adjusted P—values which could not be feasibly obtained by
standard or adaptive permutation analysis; for example down to
10‘128 in the Geuvadis dataset. In practice, having well—calibrated
adjusted P—values on the full range (0, 1) is of crucial importance to
(1) estimate the number of tests made under the null (quantity
underlying efficient FDR correction methods) and to (2) meta—
analyze multiple QTL studies together. Second, the beta approxima—
tion behaves well enough with only 100 permutations to rapidly
assess the impact on the analysis of important parameters such as
cis—window size and covariates like the number of PEER factors

(Stegle et al., 2012). And finally, FastQTL is fast (~16>< faster than
Matrix eQTL for the same number of permutations) due to an effi—
cient implementation of linear regressions, optimized C ++ code, ef—
ficient permutation schemes and rapid data retrieval from indexed
files, while remaining user and cluster friendly. To summarize,
FastQTL provides better adjusted P—values than the best method so
far, Matrix eQTL with a direct permutation scheme, while being sig—
nificantly faster. In addition, FastQTL also provides a modular base
onto which new functionalities are being implemented, such as fine
mapping of causal variants, conditional analysis to discover multiple
independent QTLs per phenotype and interaction analysis to dis—
cover sex or disease specific QTLs.

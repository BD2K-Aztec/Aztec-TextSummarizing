ABSTRACT

Motivation: Set-based variance component tests have been identified
as a way to increase power in association studies by aggregating
weak individual effects. However, the choice of test statistic has
been largely ignored even though it may play an important role in
obtaining optimal power. We compared a standard statistical test—
a score test—with a recently developed likelihood ratio (LR) test.
Further, when correction for hidden structure is needed, or gene—
gene interactions are sought, state-of—the art algorithms for both the
score and LR tests can be computationally impractical. Thus we de-
velop new computationally efficient methods.

Results: After reviewing theoretical differences in performance be-
tween the score and LR tests, we find empirically on real data that
the LR test generally has more power. In particular, on 15 of 17 real
datasets, the LR test yielded at least as many associations as the
score test—up to 23 more associations—whereas the score test
yielded at most one more association than the LR test in the two re-
maining datasets. On synthetic data, we find that the LR test yielded
up to 12% more associations, consistent with our results on real data,
but also observe a regime of extremely small signal where the score
test yielded up to 25% more associations than the LR test, consistent
with theory. Finally, our computational speedups now enable (i) effi-
cient LR testing when the background kernel is full rank, and (ii) effi-
cient score testing when the background kernel changes with each
test, as for gene—gene interaction tests. The latter yielded a factor of
2000 speedup on a cohort of size 13500.

1 INTRODUCTION

With next-generation sequencing data from larger and larger
cohorts now being collected, the possibility of detecting even
weaker genetic associations with disease is increasing. Such
weak signal could provide invaluable insights into biological
and disease mechanisms, as well as yield biomarkers for

diagnosis and personalized treatment. However, even with
large datasets becoming available, studies to detect important
genetic signal remain underpowered, especially those rare vari-
ants—the most underpowered type of association whose signal
lies in tests.

One approach to help alleviate this power problem is to group
together genetic markers and then to test them jointly in a single
test. Such an approach helps increase power in two ways. First, it
can reduce the number of tests performed and hence the multiple
testing penalty incurred. Second, the test aggregates weak signal
within a set, and can also tag unmarked variants. Although a
variety of competing methods for set tests have been proposed
(Bhatia et al., 2010; Han and Pan, 2010; Ionita-Laza et al., 2011;
Li and Leal, 2008; Liu and Leal, 2010; Madsen and Browning,
2009; Morgenthaler and Thilly, 2007; Neale et al., 2011; Price
et al., 2010; Schwender et al., 2011, Wu et al., 2011; Zawistowski
et al., 2010), some of the most inﬂuential and widely used meth-
ods are those that use a sequence-based kernel in a variance
component model (Chen et al., 2013; Ionita—Laza et al., 2013;
Lee et al., 2012a; Listgarten et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2007, 2008;
Oualkacha et al., 2013; Schifano et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2011).
Improving power in these kernel-based models is the focus of this
article. In particular, the main contribution of this article is im-
proving power in two ways:

(1) the statistical test used, showing that the non-standard
likelihood ratio (LR) test in this setting can yield substan-
tially more associations, and

(2) several exact algebraic reformulations that yield dramatic
improvements in runtime for certain classes of set tests,
enabling far larger datasets to be analyzed. For example,
on data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium (WTCCC), a gene—gene interaction score-
test speedup achieved running time ~2000 times faster
than naive computation of the test.

In the statistical genetics literature to date, practically no con-
sideration has been given to the choice of statistical test for
kernel-based set association tests. In particular, the choice of
(frequentist) statistical test in this setting has uniformly been
the score test (Ionita-Laza et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2012a; Liu
et al., 2007, 2008; Oualkacha et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2011),
with the one exception being our recent work on how to conduct
set tests in the presence of confounders, where an LR approach
was used (Listgarten et al., 2013). Band at al. (2013) also used an

Greater power and computational efﬁciency for kernel-based tests

 

approximate Bayes Factor as a complement to the use of a score
test. From a purely computational perspective, use of the score
test would seem more convenient and efﬁcient, as it requires
parameter estimation only for the null model, whereas the LR
test requires parameter estimation for both the null and the al-
ternative model. In terms of power, various theoretical results
claim the superiority of either the LR test or the score test, under
different conditions. However, because these conditions are
rarely met for real data, and because it is unclear how robust
the theoretical results are to deviations from the required condi-
tions, there is no clear theoretical guidance on which test to
choose in practice. Therefore, here we conducted a systematic
comparison between the two tests, using synthetic data, rare
and common variants, with both case-control and continuous-
Valued phenotypes, and under various types of model misspeci—
ﬁcation. In so doing, we were able to assess the relative perform-
ance of the score and LR tests across a wide variety of settings
when the ground truth was known. Finally, we applied the two
tests to real data for 17 phenotypes to determine which of our
synthetic settings were most likely applicable, ﬁnding that, over-
all, the LR test performed substantially better than the score test.

In addition to our systematic comparison of the score and LR
tests in the standard setting, we also consider richer scenarios in
which, for example, one may want to correct for confounding
factors arising from family relatedness or population structure
(Listgarten et al., 2013), or testing for gene—gene interactions
between variants from pairs of sets (e. g. genes) (Li and Cui,
2012). In such settings, there are two variance components—
one consisting of a background kernel (e.g. to correct for con-
founding factors, or for main effects in a test for gene—gene
interactions) and an additional component in the alternative
model built from the set of interest. When the null model in-
cludes a background kernel, the time to run tests can be prohibi-
tive. In particular, for the case where (i) the background kernel
has full rank (as has been done traditionally when correcting for
confounding factors), and (ii) where the background kernel is
low rank but changing with each test (as in testing for gene—
gene interactions), runtimes of state-of-the art LR and score
tests can be dramatically decreased. Thus, we developed compu-
tational improvements and demonstrate their effectiveness
through timing experiments.

2 RESULTS
2.1 Comparison of the score to the LR test

For genome-wide set tests based on a variance components
model, the choice of statistical test has focused on the score
test (Ionita-Laza et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2012a; Liu et al., 2007,
2008; Oualkacha et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2011), with one exception
being our recent work on how to conduct set tests in the presence
of confounders in which an LR test was used (Listgarten et al.,
2013). As mentioned earlier, there appears to be no universally
compelling reason to use one test over the other, as theoretical
results are limited to speciﬁc situations that are not generally
applicable. Next, we review some of the motivations and the-
orems that are often given for the use of one test over the
other, as well as reasons that these arguments may not hold.

The usual reasons cited for use of the score test are that it is the
locally most powerful test [e.g. (Chen et al., 2013; Wu et al.,
2011)] and that it is fast to compute because the parameters of
the alternative model need not be estimated—this computation is
usually the most expensive one. However, rarely does there seem
to be a discussion about why the ‘locally’ most powerful test is
the desired one—locality here refers to hypotheses that are close/
local to the null hypothesis. Sometimes, the argument is made
that hypotheses further away from the null have such strong
signal that any statistical test will ﬁnd them. As we will show
and explain, this is not an argument that the score test will have
the most power in practice. On the other hand, for so-called
simple hypotheses, the LR test is the uniformly most powerful
test according to the Neyman—Pearson lemma. A simple hypoth-
esis is one in which a null hypothesis (e.g. some parameter of
interest, at = 0) is compared with a single alternative hypothesis
(e. g. at = 010). However, in most applications, including set tests in
genetics (and those examined herein), the alternative hypothesis
is a composite one—consisting of a range of Viable parameter
values (e.g. at > 0), so the Neyman—Pearson lemma does not
apply.

One connection between the score and LR tests is that the
score test can be interpreted as an approximation to the LR
test in the neighborhood of the null hypothesis. In particular,
if one ﬁts a parabola to the log likelihood at the null hypothesis
(a good approximation locally), then the resulting LR test stat-
istic is equal to a score statistic, for a score statistic that uses the
observed rather than the more traditional expected information
(Buse, 2007). (Note that the observed information is asymptoti-
cally equivalent to the expected information, and therefore the
LR test, in a local region, is asymptotically equivalent to the
traditional score test (Buse, 2007), as well as the variant of the
score test used in this paper.) However, because the LR test is not
limited to a parabolic approximation of the likelihood surface,
the LR test can, in principle, discover parameter values yielding
larger likelihoods than those implied by the score test. If such a
discovery happens for tests that are truly non-null (and happens
less so for true nulls), then the LR test statistic will yield more
power. If, however, this discovery happens for many truly null
tests, creating relatively large LR test statistics under the null
(effectively shifting the critical region towards larger test statis-
tics), then the score test could yield more power. As a conse-
quence, one can see intuitively why the score test may
sometimes yield more power than the LR test and vice-versa.

In addition to these theoretical arguments for and against
each test, there are further complications in that a variety of
options are available for the score test. In practice, the so-
called ‘score-based’ test is often used [e.g. SKAT WVu et al.,
2011] rather than a more traditional version of the one-sided
score test (Molenberghs and Verbeke, 2003). Theoretically,
these two versions of the score test are asymptotically equivalent
except that the traditional variance component score test uses a
mixture of two distributions as an asymptotic null distribution
(Molenberghs and Verbeke, 2003), whereas the score-based test
can use a ﬁnite-sample null distribution, as used in SKAT. The
latter null distribution can be derived analytically under the
assumption that all nuisance parameters are known (see
Supplemental Section 5.1 and (Davies, 1980; Goeman et al.,
2006)). In our experiments, we chose to use a score-based test

as in SKAT because this is the standard in the genetics commu-
nity (Chen et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2012a and 2012b; Oualkacha
et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2011).

In summary, it is not clear whether one should use the score
or the LR test to achieve maximal power. Therefore, we investi-
gated this issue empirically, ﬁnding that on synthetic phenotype
data, indeed, either test could outperform the other. For
extremely small effect sizes, the score test offered greater
power, while for larger effect sizes, the LR test offered better
power. Analyzing 17 real datasets, we found that the LR test
substantially outperformed the score test (Table 3). Next, we go
in detail through these experiments. For simplicity, in the syn-
thetic experiments, we focus on experiments that do not use
a background kernel. However, when analyzing the real data,
we analyze the datasets both with and without a background
kernel for completeness.

2.2 Synthetic experiments

First, using real SNPs and synthetic phenotypes, we examined
power and control of type I error across a variety of settings,
including exclusively either common (based on WTCCC) or rare
variants (based on BMI), and either Gaussian or binary pheno-
types. F or power experiments, the causal signal was precisely
from all SNPs in the set being tested (except as noted in the
section on model misspeciﬁcation).

For binary phenotypes, theoretically, a generalized linear
model (e.g. logistic) is a more appropriate choice than a linear
model. However, exact inference for logistic models in this
setting is generally intractable, requiring approximations (e. g.

Le Cessie and van Houwelingen, 1995). One approximation
that is commonly used for the logistic score WVu et al., 2011) is
derived from the Laplace approximation to the quasi likelihood
(Breslow and Clayton, 1993) . The utility of this approximation
compared to use of a linear model, which is less appropriate but
can be evaluated without approximations, has not, to our knowl-
edge, been fully investigated. Therefore, we included in our
experiments, both a linear and an approximate logistic score
test, ﬁnding little, if any, difference between the two.

As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the type I error was controlled for
all methods in all settings (i.e. no signiﬁcant deviations from
expectation were found). Each entry in the table is estimated
from ~1 million tests from the null distribution. We examined
thresholds for which it remained practical to run experiments,
which was as low as at = 1x10_5.

After establishing control of type I error, we then systematic-
ally investigated power, using four different levels of effect size
for the causal SNPs (which were precisely those SNPs being
tested), of h2 = 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and across a range of signiﬁ-
cance thresholds 10—5, 10—4 and 10—3 (the same thresholds used
for the type I error experiments). We found that for the lowest
signal strength (hz =0.001), the score test yielded slightly more
power than the LR test, consistent with the notion that the score
test is locally optimal (Fig. 1). For the other signal strengths
(h2=0.01, 01,05), we found that the LR test yielded more
power than the score test at each level (Fig. 2, Supplementary
Figs S1 and S2), and in aggregate (Supplementary Fig. S3). The
setting with the largest gain for the score test
(712 =0.001,oz=10_3, common variants, binary phenotype)
showed a 25% relative gain in power for the score test over
the LR test. However, this setting has so little signal that even

strengths are shown in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures S1 and S2

for the score test, power was only 4%. The setting with the
largest gain for the LR test (h2 =0.01,oz=10_5, common vari-
ants, Gaussian phenotype) showed a 12% relative gain in power
for the LR over the score test, consistent with our real-data
experiments.

It is interesting to note that in all settings, the logistic score test
performed nearly identically to the linear score test. Thus,
although use of a score test allows one to use an approximate
logistic model, our results suggest that in practice this logistic
model approach confers little beneﬁt over the linear model. It
is possible that an approximate logistic LR test may confer some
advantage, but we have not yet examined this possibility.

In all of our experiments, we used a prevalence of 50%, and
strong deviations from this prevalence could change the results.
In our real data experiments (see below, and Section 4), we found
that h2 was typically on the order of a few percent (in the regime
where, on synthetic data, the LR test tends to outperform the
score test).

2.3 Real data

After establishing type I error control and regimes of superior
power for each of the score and LR tests, we next applied these
two tests to several real datasets: all seven phenotypes from the
WTCCC, and eight phenotypes from the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) dataset, counting the number of associ-
ations found to be signiﬁcant at the Bonferroni threshold
(Table 3, Supplementary Figs S6 and S7). We additionally ana-
lyzed a dataset for Warfarin dosing, and a rare variant body
mass index (BMI) dataset, neither of which yielded many signiﬁ-
cant associations, and in both cases, yielded the same number for
both the score and LR tests when using no background kernel:

Number of signiﬁcant associations on several real datasets using a Bonferroni-
corrected threshold 01 = 0.05, when no background variance component is
applied (1K), and when a background variance component computed from
all SNPs is used to correct for potential confounding factors (2K). Grayed
boxes denote cases where the score test found more associations than the LR test.

Warfarin yielded ﬁve associations, whereas BMI yielded none
(Supplementary Fig. S8).

Although one can never be certain about what are true-posi-
tive results and true-negative results on real data, we conducted
our experiments with the knowledge that in our simulations, the
type 1 error was controlled, and therefore, reasonably assumed
the same for these real datasets. This assumption, however, re-
quires that the correct background kernel (perhaps none) be
used. Thus, for these experiments, we performed a sensitivity
analysis, applying our methods both with no background
kernel, and with one (based on all SNPs). There were few differ-
ences between these two extremes (Table 3), indicating that on
these data, there is little sensitivity to the choice of background
kernel. This lack of sensitivity is unsurprising, as we originally
chose these datasets with the intent of using only models with no
background kernel for simplicity, and then added the back-
ground kernel analysis to verify our assumption that no kernel
was needed.

The LR test identiﬁed as many or more signiﬁcant sets than
the score test on all but two of the real phenotypes (Table 3).
Although one cannot make deﬁnitive conclusions from this lim-
ited number of datasets, our results suggest that the regime in
which the score test outperforms the LR test is not commonly
seen, and that in this regime, the difference in performance is
minimal. This lies in contrast to the large differences sometimes
seen when the LR test outperformed the score test.

As an added validation for analysis of the three WTCCC
immune-related datasets (Crohn’s disease, Tl diabetes and
Rheumatoid Arthritis), we downloaded known disease-asso-
ciated loci from http://immunobase.org to see how many sets
for each method were already known. For two of the datasets,
the LRT test found more validated hits than the score test. For

the third dataset, the number was the same for both tests
(Supplementary Table S2).

One interesting point is that the increase in the number of
associations when using the LR test over the score test on the
real datasets (Table 3) is somewhat larger than that suggested by
the increase in power observed on synthetic data (Figures 1 and
2). Thus, we conducted additional experiments under various
forms of model misspeciﬁcation to investigate whether we
might identify the source of this difference.

2.4 Synthetic data experiments under various types of
model misspeciﬁcation

The ﬁrst form of model misspeciﬁcation we considered is related
to the fact that, on real data, there is often a broad polygenic
background signal. In such a setting, our variance component
model becomes misspeciﬁed because the polygenic background
would not be identically and independently (iid) Gaussian-dis-
tributed. To investigate how the presence of a polygenic back-
ground signal might inﬂuence the difference between our two
statistical tests, we generated real-valued phenotypes from the
WTCCC SNPs. Now, rather than adding iid Gaussian noise to
the phenotype as in the previous experiments, we added a non-iid
polygenic background signal. In particular, we used all of the
even chromosome SNPs to generate effects drawn from a zero-
mean Gaussian with variance 1.0, and tested only gene sets on
the odd chromosomes. Then, we checked to see if the type 1 error
was still controlled for each statistical test—it was
(Supplementary Table S1). Next, for power experiments, we
added in gene-speciﬁc signal (all SNPs within a gene, as before,
and only from odd chromosomes) to this polygenic background,
with gene SNP effects drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian with
variance equal to 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 (yielding, respectively, gene-
speciﬁc foreground h2 = 0.001, 0.01, 0.1). In this setting, we
observed similar trends to those in Figures 1 and 2
(Supplementary Fig. S5).

Having identiﬁed differences in performance because of poly-
genic background model misspeciﬁcation, we next investigated
how other forms of model misspeciﬁcation might affect deviation
between the two tests. First, we repeated the experiments
from Figures 1 and 2 for h2 :05, but reducing the proportion
of causal SNPs from all SNPs within a gene, down to 50%, 10%
and 1% (always using at least one SNP). In this setting, we
observed that the LR test yielded increasingly more power
than the score test as the percentage of causal SNPs was
decreased (Supplementary Fig. S4). The type 1 error was still
controlled in this setting, as the null hypothesis was the same
as in Table 1.

In both cases of model misspeciﬁcation investigated, with
increasing misspeciﬁcation, the improvement of the LR test
over the score test increased (Supplementary Fig. S4 and S5).

2.5 Computational speedups for score and LR tests

We now describe methods for improving the computational ef-
ﬁciency of both the LR and score tests. When testing one vari-
ance component in a one-component model, the asymptotic time
complexity for the score and the LR tests are the same (0 (N3)
individuals when 161 SNPs are being tested with 161 Z N, and
otherwise 0(Nk%)). Additionally, the computation times are the

Runtimes on a single core and time complexities for various linear set tests, both
without a background kernel (one variance component model) and with (two vari-
ance component model) after applying our improvements with exceptions noted.
The time reported is the time per test averaged over 13 850 tests from the WTCCl
type 1 diabetes dataset. Runtimes and complexities for the two-variance full rank
cases exclude the 0(N3) computations shared across all tests and done upfront (2 s,
when amortized over the 13 850 tests). The logistic score model had approximately
the same timing as the linear score, and so here we report only the linear score. For
the LR test, the time includes the 10 permutations that are required. Regarding the
notation for time complexity, kg and k1 refer to the size of the background and test
components, respectively.

same in practice (Table 4). However, in many settings, one needs
to use a second variance component, which can change the ab-
solute and relative computational cost of the two tests. Examples
of settings with a two-variance components model include (i) a
null model that contains a background kernel to correct for con-
founding factors (owing to, for example, family relatedness and
population structure) (Listgarten et al., 2013), and (ii) gene—gene
interaction tests where the null model contains a background
kernel for the additive gene terms (Li and Cui, 2012). There
are two settings where computations are extremely expensive,
and where we have developed new algorithms to improve their
computational cost:

(1) The ﬁrst is when the background kernel is full rank, such
as would occur when using a background kernel computed
from all SNPs, when that number of SNPs is greater than
the number of individuals. Here we have made the LR
test dramatically more efﬁcient, even while correcting for
proximal contamination (Lippert et al., 2011; Listgarten
et al., 2012).

(2) The second case is when both the background kernel and
the foreground (alternative model) kernel are jointly low
rank. Here, we sped up the score test, dramatically so
when the background kernel changes with each test.

We now brieﬂy give some intuition on the speedups and refer
the reader to the Supplementary Methods Sections S2 and S5 for
details.

Full rank background kernel speedups For the case where pre-
cisely one of the two variance components is full rank (has more

Greater power and computational efﬁciency for kernel-based tests

 

SNPs than individuals, as might happen when correcting for
family-relatedness and population structure), we have developed
a new approach for the LR test in which expensive computations
(matrix inverses and determinants) are replaced by cheaper low-
rank-update versions of them. For example, when
2=o§l+ ogKg+o%K1, where Kg and K1 are the background
and test kernels, respectively (see Section 4), and the number
of SNPs in K1, k1, is less than N, then, rather than taking the
inverse of 2 (an N x N matrix)—a computation with time com-
plexity 0(N3 )—one can instead use the matrix inversion lemma
(assuming that the inverse of Kg is known, as it might be when
re-using it for every SNP when correcting for population struc-
ture, for example) so that the time complexity becomes only 0
(Nzkl). This approach is particularly useful in settings where the
background kernel remains constant across all or many or all
tests (Table 4). However, even when this full-rank background
kernel changes in a low rank manner with every test (as it would
when correcting for proximal contamination), our improvement
still allows the bottleneck computation to be performed only once
per dataset. Furthermore, even when the background kernel
changes entirely with every test (as in gene-gene interaction
tests), our computations restrict the bottleneck computations to
occur just once per test, rather than J times, where J is the number
of optimization iterations. We also provide an efﬁcient algorithm
for the two kernel score test when the background kernel has full
rank, although, others have developed similar methods for this
case (Chen et al., 2013; Oualkacha et al., 2013), but these do not
correct for proximal contamination.

Combined low rank variance component speedups When the
combined variance components are low rank in that the com-
bined components have fewer SNPs than there are individuals,
we previously showed how to make the LR test linear in N
(Lippert et al., 2011; Listgarten et al., 2013). This algorithmic
improvement can have a dramatic result on timing (see low
rank versus full rank LR test under the ‘Two Variance
Component’ header in Table 4), but, even with these computa-
tional improvements to the LR test, there are situations where
computations are impractical—for example, when testing for
gene—gene interactions (Li and Cui, 2012) with large N.
Consequently, we have in addition developed a low rank algo-
rithm for the score test. For large cohort sizes (e.g. the 13,500
individual WTCCC dataset used in the two-component timing
experiments, which used all phenotypes as controls and included
related individuals), the time (and memory) savings were sub-
stantial. For example, when testing a set of size 14 for gene—
gene interactions using a low rank background kernel containing
150 SNPs, our low rank score test was ~2000 times faster than
the naive implementation (ls versus 32 min). Our efﬁcient LR
test in that same setting took 3.5 min.

It is worth noting that when using these low rank speedups,
the time complexity for the score test remains the same between
one-component and two-component models. However, this is
not the case for the LR test, which requires an additional
factor I—the number of optimization steps used to ﬁt the alter-
native model. A typical number for I in our experience is around
20. Furthermore, because the LR approach requires on the order
of 10 permutations (see Section 4), the LR test is expected to be
around 200 times slower than the score test in this case (without

specialized caching of expensive computations), and as we
observed in practice (see previous paragraph). For the one-com-
ponent model, caching permutations for the LR test is trivial,
and is reﬂected in the timings in Table 4.

Previous work in speeding up the score test for two-compo-
nent variance component models are somewhat limited—for ex-
ample, requiring that the null model (and variance parameter)
remain constant across all tests (Oualkacha et al., 2013)—a con-
dition not always met, such as in testing for gene—gene inter-
action (Li and Cui, 2012). These methods also cannot account
for proximal contamination (Lippert et al., 2011; Listgarten
et al., 2012) efﬁciently. Furthermore, these approaches cannot
reduce the dependence on the number of individuals studied to
a linear time; rather they can at best reduce it to a quadratic one
(Chen et al., 2013; Oualkacha et al., 2013) even when the simi-
larity matrix is low rank. Finally, their methods are quadratic in
memory, whereas ours are linear in both time and memory in the
low rank setting.

3 DISCUSSION

We have presented two strategies for increasing power in gene-set
association studies. First, we investigated the difference in power
between an LR and a score test, ﬁnding that, although on syn-
thetic data, the score test outperformed the LR test when effect
sizes were small, the LR test found more associations when effect
sizes were larger, as it did also on real data. Second, we have
developed computational speedups for both the LR and score
tests—the former when the background kernel is full rank and
the latter when the background and foreground kernels are low
rank. For particularly onerous runs (e. g. gene—gene interaction
set tests), where it may not be practical to run the more compu-
tationally expensive LR test, our efﬁcient (and exact) score test
can run about 2000 times faster on WTCCC data than score test
algorithms currently available in statistical software, and ~200
times faster than our efﬁcient LR test.

One assumption underlying some of our efﬁcient algorithms is
that some of the kernels have a particular form (e. g. one which
factors as an inner product, and generalizations of this).
However, this assumption is reasonable, as it encompasses
most of the kernels currently being used for set tests.

Directions for further consideration include incorporation
and exploration of different measures of genetic similarity,
and investigation of other score tests, beyond the one used
here. Also, SKAT has been extended to encompass more ‘op-
timal’ settings of genetic similarity (Lee et al., 2012a), for which
our methods could likely be adapted. Another fruitful direction
may be to use a hybrid LR-score approach for large datasets
with a large number of hypotheses where the LR test may
become impractical. For example, one might consider a full
scan using the score test, and then scanning from the top of
the resulting ranked list using the more powerful LR test, going
as far down the list as resources permit. Modeling the null
distribution of the score-based test statistic can be done in a
variety of ways, including using Davies (1980) or Imhofs
method (Imhof, 1961) with a sum of xl-distributed variables
as we and SKAT have done, using Kuonen’s saddlepoint
method (Chen et al., 2013; Kuonen, 1999), or various types
of moment matching (Li and Cui, 2012; Wu et al., 2011). To

our knowledge, a systematic comparison of these approaches
has not been done, although, judging from our preliminary
comparisons, we do not expect these variations to alter the
overall story of how the LR test performs relative to the
score test. Finally, further investigation into the robustness of
each statistical test to model misspeciﬁcation would be of prac-
tical interest.

4 METHODS
4.1 Statistical models and tests

Let N(u; 2) denote a multivariate Normal distribution with mean u and
covariance 2. For the no-background-variance-component set test, the
distribution of the phenotype is deﬁned by a variance components model,

y ~ N(pX; 631+ trle) (1)

where y is a 1 x N vector of phenotype values for N individuals; B
(of dimension D x 1) is the set of the D ﬁxed effect for the covariates
contained in the design matrix X; I is an N x N identity matrix; 03 is the
residual variance; K1, given by K1 = G1 GIT, is a covariance matrix com-
puted from the variants contained in the design matrix G1 (dimension
N x k1 and normalized for the number of SNPs in it) to be tested and has
an associated variance 0%.

Conditioned on the restricted maximum likelihood estimates for the
nuisance parameter of ﬁxed effects, 3, the log restricted likelihood for
model (1) is as follows

1 1 1 1
L073,  = — §(N — D)log(27t) — EyTPy — Elog|2| + ElongTXl
— élongTXFIXL

where the covariance 2 E (031+ 0%K1) is deﬁned as in Equation (1) and
where P= ()3-1 — z-lx(XT2-lx)‘1XT2—1) is a matrix that projects out
the ﬁxed effects.

When an additional background covariance matrix Kg weighted by 0%,
is present (for example, to correct for confounding or include main effects
in an interaction test), then the covariance is deﬁned as
2 E (031+ 0§Kg + 0%K1). The restricted log likelihood (2) forms the
basis of both the score and LR tests, as described later and in the
Supplementary Information.

The set test is formally deﬁned as having a null hypothesis, Ho : 0% = 0,
and alternative hypothesis H1 : 0% Z 0. In the statistical genetics commu-
nity, this test is exclusively performed using a score test (Chen et al., 2013;
Ionita-Laza et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2012a; Listgarten et al., 2013; Liu
et al., 2007, 2008; Oualkacha et al., 2013; Schifano et al., 2012; Wu
et al., 2011), except for (Listgarten et al., 2013), which uses an LR test.
For simplicity, we here describe the LR test for a single-variance compo-
nent model, leaving the two-component model for the Supplementary
Methods.

4.1.] One Variance Component Likelihood Ratio test For the LR
test, Equation (2) is maximized twice, once under the alternative hypoth-
esis H1 : 0% Z 0, and once under the null hypothesis Ho : 0% =0. Twice
the difference in these maximum values is the LR test statistic. For this
statistic, we assume a null distribution (Listgarten et al., 2013) of the form
nxg + (1 — 7t)a x31, which is a mixture between a zero-degree of freedom x2
distribution (x3) and a scaled d-degree of freedom x2 distribution, where
d 2 0 is a continuous number, scaled by a, and with mixture parameter It.
To obtain the parameters of this null distribution, we permute the pheno-
type (and covariates) a small number of times (e. g. 10) to obtain a null
distribution of test statistics. Using this empirical distribution, we then
use a log-quantile regression of the top 10% of these to their theoretical
expected values (conditioned on an estimate of n, which is estimated as

the proportion of empirical null test statistics greater than zero). Now,
given the ﬁtted null distribution, we can apply it to the real distribution of
test statistics to obtain P-values (Listgarten et al., 2013). For the one-
variance component model, the permutations can be done extremely
cheaply by caching all the expensive computations from the real data
(computations related to the matrix determinant and inverse), thereby
reducing the computational complexity from quadratic to linear in the
size of the gene sets.

4.1.2 One variance component score test For our one-variance
component score test, we re-implemented the score-based approach, as
used in SKAT (Wu et al., 2011) (using equal weighting on all SNPs). The
score-based test statistic, Q, is the phenotype-independent portion of the
score (the ﬁrst derivative of the restricted log likelihood (2) with respect to
the parameter of interest, 0% as shown in the Supplementary Information)
and is (in the one kernel case) given by the following:

 

where SE IN — X(XTX)_1XT. As in (Goeman et al., 2006; Wu et al.,
2011) and as proven in the Supplementary Information, the distribution
of Q under the null hypothesis is given by a weighted sum of one-degree

of freedom x2 variables,
N
QN E (Pixie
i=1

where the weights, (15,-, are given by the eigenvalues of %P%G1G1TP%, where
151 is any matrix square root of P. Given this distribution, several meth-
ods can be used to obtain its cumulative distribution, required for com-
puting P-values. As in SKAT, we used the Davies exact method GDaVies,
1980), which is exact up to numeric precision. The logistic version of the
score-based test was re-implemented based on the Laplace approximation
to the quasi likelihood, as used in (Breslow and Clayton, 1993). When
K = G1 G1T (such as when a linear covariance matrix in G1 is used), one can
implement both the one- and two-variance component tests efﬁciently.

Methods for two-component tests and for improving the computa-
tional efﬁciency of the LR and score tests are given in Supplementary
Methods.

4.2 Datasets

The WTCCC 1 data (Burton et al., 2007) consisted of the SNP and
phenotype data for seven common diseases: bipolar disorder, coronary
artery disease, hypertension, Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type-I
diabetes (TlD) and type-II diabetes. Each phenotype group contained
~1900 individuals. In addition, the data included a set of ~1500 controls
from the UK Blood Service Control Group (NBS). The data did not
include a second control group from the 1958 British Birth Cohort
(58C), as permissions for it precluded use by a commercial organization.
SNPs were ﬁltered more stringently than as described by the WTCCC
so as to minimize the impact of assay artifacts. A SNP was excluded if
its minor-allele frequency (MAF) was <1%, it was missing in >1% of
individuals or its genetic distance was unknown. After ﬁltering, 356441
SNPs remained. Analysis of real data consisted of the controls and the
cases for just the disease being analyzed, yielding roughly 3500 individuals
for each analysis. Simulated WTCCC datasets were based on the SNP
data for these individuals, and referred to as the common-variant setting.

All experiments for WTCCC used 13 850 gene sets (using any SNPs
within the promoter or coding region of a gene). For the real data ana-
lysis, and synthetic power experiments, we used 10 permutations for the
LR test approach (described next). For synthetic type I control experi-
ments with the LR test, 72 runs of the 13 850 gene sets were performed,
for 997 200 P-values generated from the null per method. A separate 10
permutations were used to ﬁt the null distribution.

Greater power and computational efﬁciency for kernel-based tests

 

For the timing experiments on the WTCCC data, which used a two-
variance component model, the dataset was augmented in several ways.
First, the ﬁltering of related individuals and different ancestral back-
grounds was omitted, so that the two-variance component model
would be needed. Second, for the analysis of a given phenotype, controls
were taken to be the NBS controls as well as the cases for all other
phenotypes. This setup resulted in 1984 TlD cases and 12 941 controls
(and still 356 441 SNPs). Kernels with both all SNPs (full rank) and 150
SNPs (low rank case) were used.

For the experiments with rare variants, we used data from a BMI
dataset (dbGap phs000169.v1.p1), which consisted of data for 2802 unre-
lated individuals from a 1M Illumina chip. Keeping SNPs with MAF
between 1 and 4% yielded 19 708 SNPs, from which 2030 non-singleton
gene sets were formed (using any SNPs within the promoter or coding
region of a gene). For the real data analysis and synthetic power experi-
ments, we used 100 permutations for the LR test approach. For synthetic
type I control experiments with the LR test, 500 runs of the 2030 gene sets
were performed, for 1015 000 P-values generated from the null per
method. A separate 100 permutations were used to ﬁt the null distribution.

The two datasets above were used both for analyzing their real data,
and also using their real SNPs to generate synthetic phenotypes
(as described below). In addition to these, when examining the perform-
ance of real datasets, we also analyzed a Warfarin phenotype dataset and
an Atherosclerosis risk dataset.

The Warfarin dataset (Cooper et al., 2008), processed as in (Tatonetti
et al., 2010), used LD thinning for SNPs with more than r2 = 0.2, yielding
509 250 SNPs for 181 individuals, and 22 793 gene sets. The same gene
sets as in (Tatonetti et al., 2010) were used, which consisted of SNPs
either contained within a given gene or within 5 kb upstream of down-
stream of that gene). Stable warfarin dosages were used as the phenotype.
Covariates used in the analysis were sex, age, ancestral background,
weight, treatment with amiodarone, and treatment with losartan. We
used 10 permutations to get P-values for the LR test.

The ARIC Cohort (dbGaP Study Accession: phs000280.v2.p1) data
were ﬁltered as follows. First, any individual with more than 5% missing
data was removed. Then, a SNP was excluded if its MAF was less than 1 % ,
or it was missing in more than 2% of individuals. After processing, there
were 12751 individuals, 717492 SNPs and 25 659 gene sets (using any
SNPs within the coding region of a gene). We used age, sex and the com-
munity from which the individual came as covariates. We used eight of the
ARIC phenotypes (trgsinl, hdlsiu02, hd3siu02, hd2siu02, miO4, inc_by04,
in_by04p, calc) that yielded similar genomic control factors (all less than
1.05) with and without a full background kernel to correct for population
structure and family relatedness; these phenotypes also showed association
signal (judging from the quantile—quantile plot of univariate —log(P)
values. We used 10 permutations to get P-values for the LR test.

When a background kernel composed of all SNPs was used, we exclu-
ded any SNPs from the same chromosome as those being tested to avoid
proximal contamination O..ippert et al., 2011; Listgarten et al., 2012). When
the background kernel was low rank, we excluded any SNPs from the
background kernel that were within 2 million bases of the SNPs being tested.

SNPs in all datasets, for both real and synthetic experiments, were
encoded as 0,1,2 for the number of minor alleles, before being zero-
meaned and whitened (SD set to 1.0).

4.3 Simulation experiments

All synthetic experiments comparing statistical tests used a standard vari-
ance components model in which there was only one kernel—the one
used to test a set of SNPs, as in all of the SKAT papers (Lee et al.,
2012a and 2012b; Wu et al., 2011). Real SNP data were used for the
synthetic experiments, and only the phenotype was simulated. For experi-
ments measuring control of type I error, continuous phenotypes were
sampled independently from a Gaussian distribution and, therefore,
contained no genetic signal. Binary phenotypes were obtained by

thresholding the Gaussian phenotype such that the case:control ratio
was 50:50. For power experiments, a new phenotype was sampled for
each gene in turn, using all SNPs in that gene, over a variety of effect
strengths. The phenotype was sampled from the LMM, using
0%,=1.0,0.1,0.01,0.001 and 0Z=1.0, which is equivalent to sampling
from a linear regression ﬁxed effects model (Listgarten et al., 2012)
with noise 0% and ﬁxed effect weight parameters identically and independ-
ently distributed from a Gaussian with variance 02. In the text, we often

5

describe these relative effect sizes using h2 E 0é/(0e + 0%,). For each value
of 0%,, ﬁve random seeds were used to generate ﬁve phenotypes.

To examine robustness to model misspeciﬁcation (which was not pre-
sent in the setting just described), we also altered the experimental set-up

above, by variously using each of these, independently:

(1) using all SNPs on all even-numbered chromosomes (in WTCCC)
to generate a background polygenic signal with SNP effects drawn
from a zero-mean Gaussian with variance 1.0 (and no other noise),
and then testing each gene set on only the odd-numbered chromo-
somes, having generated either with no additional phenotypic
signal (for type 1 error), or having added in gene-set speciﬁc effects
(for all SNPs) drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian with variance set
to each of 10-4, 10*, 102,101, or

(2) the same as above, but using only 50, 10 or 1% of the SNPs in a
gene as causal for the power experiments.

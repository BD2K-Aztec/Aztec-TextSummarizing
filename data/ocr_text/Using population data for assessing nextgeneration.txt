ABSTRACT

Motivation: During the past 4 years, whole-exome sequencing has
become a standard tool for finding rare variants causing Mendelian
disorders. In that time, there has also been a proliferation of both
sequencing platforms and approaches to analyse their output. This
requires approaches to assess the performance of different methods.
Traditionally, criteria such as comparison with microarray data or a
number of known polymorphic sites have been used. Here we
expand such approaches, developing a maximum likelihood frame-
work and using it to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of whole-
exome sequencing data.

Results: Using whole-exome sequencing data for a panel of 19
individuals, we show that estimated sensitivity and specificity are simi-
lar to those calculated using microarray data as a reference. We ex-
plore the effect of frequency misspecification arising from using an
inappropriately selected population and find that, although the esti-
mates are affected, the rankings across procedures remain the same.

1 INTRODUCTION

The identiﬁcation of sequence variants predisposing to diseases
that follow Mendelian inheritance patterns is a common appli-
cation of next-generation sequencing technologies (Ng et al.,
2010a, b, c; Wang et al., 2010). A key step in these approaches
is the identiﬁcation of variants shared among affected relatives
(Ng et al., 2010a, b, 0). Usually a variant is deﬁned as a deviation
from a reference sequence. Next-generation sequencing of mater-
ial enriched for exonic sequences has been successful in many
cases, but has failed to identify the causative variants in others
(Bamshad et al., 2011; Gilissen et al., 2011). Such apparent fail-
ures may have many causes but also focus attention on the
desirability of simple measures to assess the results of the sequen-
cing and analysis pipelines used. In disease-mapping efforts, it is

clearly desirable to have a high probability of identifying a true
variant while the number of falsely identiﬁed variants remains
low. This will reduce the amount of work needed for validation
of candidate variants, which is typically undertaken using Sanger
sequencing or genotyping approaches.

Our objective is to develop a simple and ﬂexible approach for
assessing the performance of a whole-exome or -genome sequen-
cing experiment. It should allow assessing the whole process,
from sample preparation to variant calling. The focus is on the
detection of single-base sequence variants as opposed to changes
in copy number or large rearrangements. One approach is to
compare the identiﬁed variants with variants known to be
present or absent. For this purpose, variants are commonly com-
pared with the results of genotyping microarrays (e. g. Ng et al.,
2009). This allows for the probability of a speciﬁc variant at a
given position in an individual to be considered as either 0 or 1.
The price of this certainty is additional experimental costs.

An alternative is to use variants where the probability of
occurrence in a speciﬁc sample can be ascertained, thus allowing
the probability of a variant present at a speciﬁc position to
assume values other than 0 or 1. Here we formalize the second
approach using sites known to be polymorphic in the human
population. This approach can be seen as an extension of meth-
ods that rely on quality criteria such as the number of variants
found in sites known to be polymorphic in the human population
(e.g. Challis et al., 2012; Marth et al., 2011). We compare our
results with those obtained using microarray data and use our
method to assess different analysis pipelines and to explore the
importance of analysis parameters and coverage depth. As we
are using known polymorphisms, we also investigate the inﬂu-
ence of the population that was used to characterize the poly-
morphisms on the results.

The use of microarrays to assess the accuracy of variant iden-
tiﬁcation is likely to lead to biased results, as the polymorphisms
present on microarrays usually exclude variants such as small
insertion/deletions (indels). Such variants also represent a chal-
lenge for variant calling in next- generation sequencing. In the last
paragraph, we therefore explore different analysis pipelines for
indel calling.

The results of such comparisons can be summarized in many
ways. Commonly used metrics include, for example, the number
or proportion of previously reported variants among the detected
deviations from the reference sequence. As our focus is on a

dichotomous outcome, i.e. the presence or absence of a variant at
a particular position, we use here the probabilities of identifying
the variant at a site that carries a variant and of identifying no
variant at a site where only the reference sequence is present. We
refer to these probabilities as sensitivity and speciﬁcity.

2 METHODS

Parameter estimation: We designate with M the presence of a variant
allele and with D the detection of a variant allele. Correspondingly, M
and 5 represent the absence of a mutant allele and the non-detection of a
mutant allele. For an autosomal locus we have:

P (Di) =P(Di|M iM i)P(M iM i) +p(Di|MiM i)P(MiM i)

_ _ _ _ (1)
+p(Di|MiMi)p(MiMi)

P(ﬁi) :p(ﬁilMiMi)p(DilMiMi) +p(ﬁi|MiMi)p(MiMi)

_ _ _ _ _ (2)
+p(Di|MiMi)p(MiMi)

Assuming Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium, we obtain for the genotype
frequencies p(M,-M,-) =f2, p(M,M,) = 2f,91 —f,- and ARM.) = (1 —f,-)2
where f,- designates the frequency of the variant allele. We further
designate with s the sensitivity s=p(D|M) and with u the speciﬁcity u=
“Elli—l) and obtain for the remaining terms: p(D,-|M,-M,-) =S(2 — S)
 :S ‘1”  —  — Ll),  :1 — M2,p(ﬁilMiMi) :
(1 — sf, “Emma: (1 — S)u and p(ﬁ,|M,M,)=u2.

We treat all sites as independent and assume that the detection prob-
ability for one site is independent from that for another, and thus, for an
individual, the likelihood is l(s, u) = H P(D,-)]_[J.ESB P(5j), where S D
represents the set of sites where a variant was detected and S5 represents
the sites where only the reference was observed. The estimates of s and u
are the values that maximize this likelihood. Owing to the linkage disequi-
librium, we cannot assume that the occurrence of variants at neighbouring
sites is independent. Therefore, we perform the calculation by choosing
random sets of sites where the sites in the same set are either separated by
at least 500 kb or on different chromosomes. Here we perform the calcu-
lations over 1000 of such sets. This leads to a series of estimates for s and u,
allowing us to compute the median of these estimates.

When several individuals are analysed and we could assume that their
genotypes are independent, the likelihood for a group of K individuals
can be described as l(s, u) = H521 lk(s, u).

Here we analyse each individual separately and report the median, as
well as the 95% conﬁdence interval, determined by bootstrapping.

Sequence data: Targeted whole-exome sequencing was carried out for
31 (12 + 19) samples using an Illumina Genome Analyser IIx. Agilent
38 Mb target (hg18) positions were obtained from Agilent, and the se-
quences corresponding to these positions were obtained using the Galaxy
website. Build 36.1 of the human genome (hg18) was used as a reference
sequence (https: //genome.ucsc.edu/).

Genotyping arrays: Genotype chip data were available for 19 of the 31
samples, composing of 557 124 SNPs on the Illumina 660 genotype chip.
In all, 10762 of these SNPs were located within the target regions.

Comparison of array and Sequencing data: As described in Section 1,
our analysis focuses on the ability to detect variants, and therefore, we
assess at any position whether a variant was detected. The sensitivity is
deﬁned as the number of sites in which both sequencing and microarrays
detected a deviation from the reference sequence divided by the number
of sites where a variant was detected by using the microarrays.
Correspondingly, the number of sites where both methods detected no
deviation from the reference sequence divided by the number of sites

iESD

where the microarray detected only the reference residue was used as
an estimate of the speciﬁcity.

Selection of polymorphisms: The HapMap database contained
4083713 SNPs (CEU population, build 36, downloaded October 28,
2010). Of these, 10165 overlapped with the on-target genotype chip
SNPs. Allele frequency data were obtained for each of these SNPs
from the HapMap database. All 10165 available SNPs were used in
the analysis.

Sequence analysis: Unless speciﬁed otherwise, reads were aligned to the
whole human genome (hg18) using the following aligners: Bowtie 0.12.8
(Langmead et al., 2009), BWA 0.6.2 (Li and Durbin, 2009), GSNAP
20120720 (Wu and Nacu, 2010), NovoAlign 2.07.13 (http://www.novo
craft.com), SOAP2 2.21 (Li et al., 2009b) and SSAHA2 2.5.5 (Ning
et al., 2001). Variants were identiﬁed using either Varscan 2.3.1
(Koboldt et al., 2009) or Samtools 0.1.8 (Li et al., 2009a). Unless speciﬁed
otherwise, the default parameters were used for each program. Coverage
was assessed from the pileup ﬁles. Coverage depth was varied by sam-
pling with replacement from the SAM ﬁles.

Indel calling: Twelve of the samples were used for the indel analysis.
Reads were aligned to the human genome reference (hg19) sequence using
Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), BWA and NovoAlign. Indels
were identiﬁed using Samtools 0.1.8, Dindel 1.01 and GATK 2.6.4
(DePristo et al., 2011; McKenna et al., 2010). For Dindel, a minimum
variant coverage of seven was used, and for all other programs, the de-
fault parameters were used.

Other metrics: There is a large number of metrics that can be used to
assess the quality of the sequencing experiments. Here we will only ex-
plore the fraction of target bases covered at least once, average coverage
depth and the fraction of target bases covered at least 10-fold.

3 RESULTS

In this section, we ﬁrst explore some applications of the method
proposed, then compare its results with estimates generated using
the genotypes obtained through the microarray as the true geno-
types. The method only requires that the allele frequencies in the
population from which the samples were drawn are known.
However, this may not be the case; therefore, we explore the
effects of population misspeciﬁcation.

Pipelines: Figure 1 compares sensitivity and speciﬁcity esti-
mates achieved using different alignment and variant calling pro-
gram combinations. The values are based on 31 samples. For
eight samples, SSAHA2 failed to produce results and generated
the messages error: memory allocation failed cannot allocate
memory or error: “memory allocation for array of fasta struc-
tures failed cannot allocate memory”. Represented for each com-
bination are the median and the upper and lower quartiles.
Interestingly, the alignment programs appear to have a stronger
effect on sensitivity, whereas the variant calling programs ap-
peared to effect speciﬁcity more strongly. All aligners yield simi-
lar speciﬁcities when used in combination with Samtools, and the
combinations NovoAlign/Samtools and BWA/Samtools pro-
vided the highest sensitivity. Therefore, we used NovoAlign as
aligner and Samtools as variant caller as the standard pipeline
for subsequent analyses. The estimates for the speciﬁcity using
Samtools with any aligner were in excess of 0.998.

Parameter selection: Each alignment and variant calling pro-
gram has a range of parameters, which can be set by the user. In
general default, values are provided, but these may not always be
appropriate, and altering these parameters can have a marked
effect on sensitivity and speciﬁcity. Our procedure can be used to

investigate such effects. As an example, we explore the effect of
varying the quality thresholds for variant calling using the
NovoAlign/Samtools pipeline (Fig. 2). This threshold is the min-
imum base quality at a position, for a read, required for that read
to be included in the variant call for that position. Figure 2A
shows that altering this parameter has a dramatic effect on
sensitivity, with a rapid drop when the values are set above 20.
The effect on speciﬁcity (Fig. 2B) is more modest, and increasing
the values beyond 30 has only a limited effect.

Coverage: Figure 3 explores the effects of average coverage. As
expected, sensitivity increases with increasing coverage. With the
parameters we used, there is a substantial loss of sensitivity when
the average coverage was <40-fold. Speciﬁcity shows little vari-
ation with increasing depth. At low coverage, ﬁnding evidence
for a variant generally becomes more difﬁcult, thus leading to a
low sensitivity and high speciﬁcity.

Microarray comparison: For 19 samples, data were available
from both platforms. The variants were called using the
NovoAlign/Samtools pipeline with default parameters. Table 1
compares sensitivity and speciﬁcity ﬁgures estimated using geno-
type microarray data (fourth column) and our method with two
different sets of allele frequencies (second and third column). The
frequencies used for the estimates in the third column were
calculated from the genotyping results for the 19 samples. We
see that compared with the microarrays, both speciﬁcity and
sensitivity estimates are slightly lower by the frequency method
using the CEU population frequencies (second column). One
possible contributor to this effect is that the estimates are dis-
torted because the allele frequencies do not match the frequencies
in our sample. In fact, the difference is smaller when the allele
frequencies used are derived from the genotyping results (third
column). It should also be mentioned that speciﬁcity estimates
are in the order of 0.999. These estimates, however, are based
only on a limited number of polymorphic sites (10165 sites),

suggesting that the ability to adequately assess changes in the
speciﬁcity will be limited. This is reﬂected in the correlation be-
tween the estimates obtained from microarrays and from popu-
lation frequencies. Although there is a good correlation between
the estimates for the sensitivity (Fig. 4; R2 =0.71, P=4x10_50),
the correlation for speciﬁcity is rather poor although still signiﬁ-
cant (R2 =0.39, P=7x10—21).

Allele frequency eﬂects: The method we propose uses allele
frequencies in the estimation of sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
Allele frequencies vary between populations, and the ethnicity
of the individuals who provided a sample may not always be
precisely known. We therefore explored how the use of alterna-
tive allele frequency data from a variety of populations would
inﬂuence our results. Figure 5 explores the effects of using the
allele frequencies for 11 HapMap populations in the estimation
of the performance of the pipelines used previously. The ﬁgure
suggests that misspeciﬁcation of population frequencies tends to
lead to lower estimates of both sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
However, the lines connecting the values for different pipelines
calculated using different allele frequencies tend to be parallel.
This indicates that the results are correlated (P<0.01 for all
comparisons), suggesting that although the estimates may vary,
the different pipelines will tend to be in the same order.

and using CEU population frequencies. Each point represents the sensi-
tivity value obtained for individuals and analysis pipelines

Indel calling: This analysis is based on 12 samples and 8365
indel variants included in the 1000 genomes data (CEU). The low
number of positions considered makes estimation of speciﬁcity
problematic. One possibility is to include in the analysis sites
where no indel has been reported in the databases and assign
them a low probability to carry a variant. Here we followed this
path assuming that the frequency of a rare allele in a position
where no variant has been described to be 108. Figure 6 shows
the results for different indel calling pipelines. For all pipelines,
the sensitivity is substantially lower than the values obtained for
single-base substitutions (compare with Fig. 1). We also observe
that Samtools has the lowest sensitivity, whereas GATK per-
formed best. We also saw that the combination BWA/GTAK
performed best. The higher speciﬁcity value achieved by Dindel
is likely due to the minimum variant call threshold used in ana-
lysis. The average estimates for sensitivity using the bowtie/
GATK and NovoAlign/GATK pipelines are 0.35 and 0.34,
respectively.

4 DISCUSSION

The approach we presented here estimates two parameters, the
sensitivity and the speciﬁcity of variant calls in a next-generation
sequencing experiment, by comparing the observed variants with
population allele frequency data in a maximum likelihood frame-
work. We illustrated some of its potential applications by com-
paring analysis pipelines and variant calling parameters and
exploring the effects of differences in coverage. As both sensitiv-
ity and speciﬁcity are inﬂuenced by various experimental factors,
including sample preparation, the sequencing itself and the bio-
informatic pipelines used to analyse data, the procedure could be
used to assess the performance of a sequencing experiment glo-
bally and could complement other commonly used approaches,
such as the assessment of base call quality or of coverage metrics.

The main advantage of the method presented here is that it does
not require a reference technique, such as genotyping using
microarrays; a reference method in itself may be problematic,
as its overall error rates have been reported to be in the order
of 10*2 (Li et al., 2013). However, our method relies on the avail-
ability of appropriate allele frequencies.

The use of allele frequencies has two consequences. The ﬁrst is
that compared with the situation where the presence or absence
of variants is known, using a probability introduces a degree of
uncertainty that is reﬂected in a larger scatter of the estimates
(Table l). The second is that it forces one to decide which set of
allele frequencies to use. The choice of the allele frequencies from
a speciﬁc population, or, if available, from a particular subpo-
pulation, disregards the possibility that individuals may represent
a mixture from different populations. This problem could be
circumvented using a more complicated machinery that con-
siders, for example, the probability of belonging to a certain
population, or of carrying certain haplotypes. Misspeciﬁcation
of the population frequencies will inﬂuence the speciﬁcity and
sensitivity estimates, but Figure 5 suggests that if two procedures
are signiﬁcantly different in speciﬁcity or sensitivity, misspeciﬁ-
cation of the allele frequencies will tend to preserve the order.

One of the critical issues is the location of the polymorphisms
used. Here we chose those included in the regions targeted by the
enrichment procedure. However, as the practical interest is to
detect mutations likely to cause disease, a natural choice would
be to use all the polymorphisms in coding or perhaps in regula-
tory regions. This would assess the experiment as a whole includ-
ing the choice of the enrichment procedure. Another question is
the choice of the polymorphisms. Initially we used the poly-
morphisms included in the microarray. These polymorphisms
represent a selection based on criteria that probably include the
likelihood of being efﬁciently typed using microarray technology.
This will probably result in avoiding certain types of polymorph-
isms and polymorphisms in certain locations such as regions with

extreme base compositions. It is possible that sequencing experi-
ments are accurate in exactly the same regions. This would lead
to overestimation of sensitivity and speciﬁcity when using micro-
array genotyping as reference technique. The method proposed
here allows for a comparison of different types of polymorphisms
and we showed its application to the identiﬁcation of indels. As
expected, sensitivity appears to be lower for indels than for
single-nucleotide substitutions. Although allele frequencies for
polymorphisms not included in microarrays may not be accurate,
our results are consistent with published studies that show that
indel detection is still a challenging issue (Albers et al., 2011;
Bansal et al., 2011).

As our interest focused on the detection of rare variants, we
were able to dichotomize the outcome by scoring at each position
whether a variant was present or absent. This leads effortlessly
into the determination of speciﬁcity and sensitivity. However,
more complicated scenarios are possible, such as assessing the
calling of each of the three possible genotypes deﬁned by a vari-
ant/reference allele system at each position. Here, however, we
chose the more simple approach. Studies frequently focus on
sensitivity as opposed to speciﬁcity (e.g. Pattnaik et al., 2012);
however, estimation of speciﬁcity is important, as it may help to
assess the amount of validation work that is required, that is
closely related to false-positive rate. A speciﬁcity of 0.99 and a
frequency of deviations from the reference sequence in the order
of l per 1000 sites would be expected to lead, on average, to ~10
false-positive ﬁndings to one true variant position. Therefore,
practically useful methods of variant detection beneﬁt from
having speciﬁcities that are considerably >0.99. Estimating
such a parameter accurately will require examining a large
number of sites. For example, simply counting false- and true-
negative ﬁndings, relying, for example, on microarray data
would require at least 10650 invariant positions to establish
the difference between a method that has speciﬁcity of 0.999
compared with one with a speciﬁcity 0.9999 with 80% power.
In this article, we primarily relied on sites that are known to be
polymorphic; however, we could also include sites for which
there are no reported variants and assume that this implies a
low minor allele frequency. This would allow to increase the
number of sites used and to improve the ability to estimate the
speciﬁcity.

As our procedure is simple, it would be possible to use it to
optimize analysis parameters, by integrating it into, for example,
a variant caller so that it maximizes the sensitivity while not
allowing speciﬁcity to sink below a certain threshold. Such a
procedure would beneﬁt from the fact that the order appears
to be insensitive to the choice of population. This would allow
for an estimation of the amount of validation work required and
the likelihood that a change of interest can really be identiﬁed
and can guide the design of future experiments.

In summary, we have developed an approach to assess the
performance of whole-exome or -genome sequencing experi-
ments that requires only the knowledge of the population fre-
quencies of polymorphisms. Such a method could be easily

used to assess new/updated analysis procedures and to inform
the choice of analysis pipeline, analysis parameters or even of
experimental tools.

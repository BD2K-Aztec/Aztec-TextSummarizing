Abstract

Motivation: The development of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithms for param-
eter inference which are both computationally efficient and scalable in parallel computing environ-
ments is an important area of research. Monte Carlo rejection sampling, a fundamental component
of ABC algorithms, is trivial to distribute over multiple processors but is inherently inefficient.
While development of algorithms such as ABC Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) help address
the inherent inefficiencies of rejection sampling, such approaches are not as easily scaled on mul-
tiple processors. As a result, current Bayesian inference software offerings that use ABC-SMC lack
the ability to scale in parallel computing environments.

Results: We present al3c, a C++ framework for implementing ABC-SMC in parallel. By requiring
only that users define essential functions such as the simulation model and prior distribution func-
tion, al3c abstracts the user from both the complexities of parallel programming and the details of
the ABC-SMC algorithm. By using the al3c framework, the user is able to scale the ABC-SMC algo-
rithm in parallel computing environments for his or her specific application, with minimal program-
ming overhead.

Availability and implementation: al3c is offered as a static binary for Linux and OS-X computing
environments. The user completes an XML configuration file and C++ plug-in template for the spe-
cific application, which are used by al3c to obtain the desired results. Users can download the static
binaries, source code, reference documentation and examples (including those in this article) by

1 Introduction

 

When modeling biological phenomena, the presence of interacting
factors can make the identification of the model’s parameter distri-
bution intractably complicated, creating an incentive to simplify the
model. Rather than risk oversimplifying such a model, a numerical
estimate of parameter distributions can be obtained using Monte
Carlo rejection sampling methods. By repeatedly simulating data
with randomly chosen parameters and considering the distribution

of only those parameters responsible for simulations most similar to
the observed data, one can make inferences about the model’s
parameter distribution given the observed data. When the proposed
parameters for rejection sampling are generated from a prior distri-
bution, the process can be classified as an Approximate Bayesian
Computation (ABC) algorithm, as described in Beaumont (2010).
Due to their reliance on rejection sampling, ABC algorithms are in-
herently inefficient.

While basic ABC algorithms can trivially be accelerated by paral-
lelizing simulations, more efficient methods of ABC are harder to
parallelize. ABC Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) improves the
efficiency of ABC with an iterative method of rejection sampling, ul-
timately requiring less simulations and therefore less computation
time (Sisson et al., 2009). Due to its sequential nature, ABC-SMC is
less trivial to parallelize and as a result, existing software implemen-
tations by Csilléry et al. (2012), Jabot et al. (2013) and Wegmann et
al. (2010) cannot effectively use large computing clusters in parallel.
Software by Liepe et al. (2014) allows for the massively parallel exe-
cution of code on graphics processing units (GPUs), although this re-
quires in-depth parallel programming knowledge. Researchers are
therefore unable to scale an efficient method of ABC on multi-
processor computers or computing clusters without some parallel
programming knowledge. To address this, we present al3c, an object
oriented framework for implementing ABC-SMC in parallel without
knowledge of parallel programming.

2 Software
2.1 ABC-SMC in Parallel Algorithm

al3c implements a Sequential Importance Sampling derived ABC-
SMC algorithm (Toni, 2009) for parameter inference using user-
defined functions which characterize the simulation model and the
parameters to infer. If D is the observed data of interest and (9 the
parameter(s) used to simulate data, we use ABC-SMC to estimate
P( (9 |D), the posterior distribution of (9 given D. Estimates are
found by sampling (9 from a prior distribution TC ( (9 ), then simulat-
ing data with each sampled (9 and accepting values of (9 that simu-
lated data most similar to D. In subsequent generations we perform
weighted sampling from the set of Os that were accepted in the previ-
ous generation, perturb each sampled parameter slightly to yield (9",
and simulate data with (9". After a specified number of perturbed
0"5 have been accepted, we weight each and repeat the process
iteratively.

al3c’s parallel implementation of ABC-SMC uses a ‘single pro-
gram multiple data’ parallelization strategy via Message Passing
Interface (MPI) libraries to decrease the computation time of the
ABC-SMC algorithm. Multiple processors concurrently sample, per-
turb and evaluate parameters for goodness of fit independently of
each other, using a common rejection threshold, until each processor
has found its allocated number of acceptances. When each processor
has completed its assignment, parameters are collected from each
processor, weighted and re-distributed to all processors for the next
generation of ABC-SMC. Since the simulation component of rejec-
tion sampling constitutes the vast majority of computation time in
ABC-SMC, we expect our algorithm will scale linearly with respect
to the number of processors used, despite the time spent
synchronizing processors to accommodate for the sequential nature
of ABC-SMC.

3 Examples

3.1 Estimation of demographic model parameters

To demonstrate the scalability of al3c, we configured the software
to incorporate MaCS, a program designed to simulate large genetic
sequences based on arbitrary demographic models (Chen et al.,
2009). Following the work of Gravel (2011), we defined a demo-
graphic model with seven parameters and compared summary

statistics between simulations and 1000 Genomes data to test for
goodness of fit (McVean, 2012), as detailed in the Supplementary
Information.

For benchmark purposes, we first ran al3c on one processor,
and found that after approximately 24 h its worst accepted simula-
tion was of Euclidean distance 66.0 from our observed dataset. We
repeated this analysis with al3c configured to run on 2—128 pro-
cessors and quit once each of the 1000 accepted simulations was of
distance less than or equal to 66 .0 from our observed dataset, and
recorded the respective run time. Each compute node was
equipped with two Intel Xeon 2.33 GHZ 4-core processors and 12
GB of memory.

3.1.1 al3c scales linearly with respect to processors available

Each time the number of processors available to al3c was doubled,
the run time was reduced by approximately one-half, while each run
saw a similar convergence in distribution for each of the seven
examined parameters (Table 1).

3.2 Estimation of behavioral patterns in Drosophila
fruit-fly

abctoolbox, a prominent ABC-SMC software offering requires users
to call an external simulation program with system calls (Wegmann
et al., 2010). In contrast, al3c supports both system and native func-
tion calls to existing C/C++ code. The use of native functions as
opposed to system calls can significantly reduce the amount of over-
head involved in initializing and running each simulation, particu-
larly in cases where running a single simulation requires a relatively
large amount of initialization steps, but the marginal cost of further
simulations is minimal. To assess the advantage of using native calls,
we configured al3c to simulate data using ﬂysim, a Markov chain
Monte Carlo simulator of Drosophila fly behavior (Foley et al.,
20 1 5) using both configurations.

3.2.1 al3c computation times can be further improved through the
use of shared libraries

Running al3c by natively invoking the simulation via a function call
to a shared library requires only one initialization per processor
whereas calling flysz'm via system calls requires a fresh initialization
for each simulation. We found that when configured with 128 pro-
cessors and an acceptance distance criterion of 2.5, al3c completed

time allotment).

4 Discussion

We have given two examples in which parameter inference of biolo-
gical models was accelerated with the al3c framework. The litera-
ture on methods and programs for ABC inference is broad, and
there are problems where parallel implementations are optimized to
perform well for a narrower class of problems and may be a more
appropriate choice, such as in systems biology (Liepe et al., 2014).
al3c, however, provides the research community with the first avail-
able general-purpose ABC application that allows users to employ
parallelized ABC-SMC in any context without knowledge of parallel
programming. Future features for al3c may include automatic opti-
mizing of rejection threshold schedules to prevent parameter esti-
mates from converging to local maxima (Silk, 2013), and GPU
support to further parallelize individual simulations.

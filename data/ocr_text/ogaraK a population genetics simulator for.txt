ABSTRACT

Motivation: The evolution of resistance in Plasmodium falciparum
malaria against most available treatments is a major global health
threat. Population genetics approaches are commonly used to model
the spread of drug resistance. Due to uncommon features in malaria
biology, existing forward-time population genetics simulators cannot
suitably model Plasmodium falciparum malaria.

Results: Here we present ogaraK, a population genetics simulator
for modelling the spread of drug-resistant malaria. OgaraK is
designed to make malaria simulation computationally tractable
as it models infections, not individual parasites. OgaraK is also
able to model the life cycle of the parasite which includes both
haploid and diploid phases and sexual and asexual reproduction.
We also allow for the simulation of different inbreeding levels, an
important difference between high and low transmission areas and a
fundamental factor influencing the outcome of strategies to control
or eliminate malaria.

Availability: OgaraK is available as free software (GPL) from the
address http://popgen.eu/soft/ogaraK.

Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Malaria is a major public health concern, as one-third of the
human population is estimated to be exposed to the threat of the
most virulent species, Plasmodium falciparum. Antimalarial drug
resistance has emerged as one of the major challenges facing
malaria control. Drug resistance became widespread to most ﬁrst-
line therapies and treatment failures are now being observed for
their replacements, Artemisinin Combination Therapies (ACTs)
(Dondorp el al., 2009). Mathematical and computational models
of the spread of drug resistance are an important tool to understand
the emergence and spread of drug resistance.

Most mathematical and computational modelling of malaria
have been based on epidemiology (e.g. Koella and Antia, 2003)
or population genetics (e.g. Hastings, 1997), though complex
simulation models have also been developed (Smith et al., 2008).
While many forward-time population genetics simulators do exist
(e.g. Peng and Kimmel, 2005), they are not suitable to model
malaria, therefore all existing computational studies using a
population genetics approach are based on applications and scripts

developed for each study and not directly subjected to peer review
or publicly available.

Standard individual-based forward-time population genetics
simulators are not suitable to model malaria biology for two main
reasons: (i) population size in malaria can rise up to 1012 parasites
per human host, making it computationally infeasible to simulate
all individuals and (ii) the malaria life cycle includes both haploid
and diploid phases and most existing simulators do not allow
for the modelling of different genotypic structures over time. In
order to address these issues, we developed ogaraK, a population
genetics simulator designed to study the spread of drug resistance
in P. falciparum malaria.

2 APPROACH

OgaraK features and limitations are based on malaria population
biology in the presence of treatment pressure. OgaraK was designed
to study the spread of existing drug resistance and it can be
used to understand how recognized important factors in malaria
epidemiology (e.g. different transmission intensities) inﬂuence the
spread of resistance and also to compare different drug deployment
policies.

Drug treatments can be modelled as a form of selection pressure
over the parasite population. OgaraK is able to simulate a wide
variety of selection pressures modelling both temporal and spacial
selection heterogeneity. Temporal heterogeneity is a proxy for a
policy of drug rotation while spacial heterogeneity approximates
the use of multiple ﬁrst-line drugs.

A wide range of epistasis modes of loci involved in drug resistance
are also supported. While most existing theoretical research assumes
that parasites require all mutations (full epistasis) related to a drug
in order to resist treatment, ogaraK is able to model other epistasis
modes, like duplicate gene function or asymmetry. These modes
reﬂect existing empirical evidence for some drugs (e. g. Chloroquine
or SP) where genes vary in their importance to confer resistance
(Olliaro, 2005). Multiple epistasis modes are also useful to model
poor drug compliance or host immunity: a weaker epistasis mode
among drug resistance loci is enough to confer resistance in humans
with no acquired immunity or who take an incomplete treatment; in
humans who take a full course or have acquired partial immunity
against malaria, a stronger epistasis mode is required to resist
treatment.

Multiplicity of infection (MOI) has been recognized as one of
the factors that differentiate between high and low transmission
areas of malaria. MOI affects the spread of resistance, recombination
and population inbreeding levels as the mating alternatives on the
obligatory sexual phase in the mosquito are limited by the number

of genetically different parasites ingested in a blood meal. OgaraK
allows the simulation of different inbreeding levels, allowing for a
varying MOI across simulations and also, within each simulation,
simulating individuals with different MOI.

Individual-based simulation is replaced by exhaustive
enumeration of all possible combinations of infection types
(each infection having a speciﬁc genotype). This method was ﬁrst
used in Hastings (2006) and comparative analysis between results
derived from epidemiological simulations and this approach show
consistent results (Boni et al., 2008).

The main purpose of the simulator is to study the spread of
resistance but we also support mutation therefore allowing the
study of de novo emergence. In the case of most antimalarials [e.g.
Chloroquine or SP (Wellems and Plowe, 2001)], mutation is a rare
event. Furthermore, resistance already exists to most drugs, even
Artemisinin-based therapies (Dondorp el al., 2009), hence our focus
is on spread of existing mutations.

In order to study simultaneous usage of multiple ACTs which
might share one resistance gene (as they all have an Arteminisin
derivative as principal component), we also provide models of multi-
drug resistance where part of the resistance mechanism is shared
among all drugs. A ‘standard’ model where all drugs involved have
unrelated loci is also available.

OgaraK has an easy to use interface which can be run from the
web as a Java Webstart application. The code is available and can
be also linked as a library or used in batch mode.

Results are exported in a text format (reporting the frequency of
all genotypes over time) and also made available in the widely used
Genepop (Rousset, 2008) format. Simple scripts for data analysis
are provided using Biopython (Cock et al., 2009), but these mainly
serve as examples as it is expected that most analysis will be done
using standard population genetics packages owing to the ability to
export data in Genepop format.

Supplementary material is included where the model is detailed
and where example applications and a user manual are also supplied.

3 DISCUSSION

OgaraK is able to easily simulate most existing population genetics
models studying the spread of drug resistance in malaria. It is made
available as a public framework which can be used to evaluate
new models or re-use old ones for new analysis. For instance, it
was already used and tested to research the impact of epistasis
on linkage disequilibrium between loci involved in drug resistance
(Antao and Hastings, 2011) and can also simulate, from a population
genetics perspective, promising drug deployment strategies (Boni
et al., 2008).

We focused on modelling how resistance spreads and not de novo
emergence, given that emergence is a rare event and that it is already
widespread to most drugs, therefore making the management of
existing resistance a major concern. Nonetheless ogaraK supports
mutation, therefore permitting the study of de novo emergence.

While ogaraK was developed with malaria modelling in mind,
epistasis and spacial and temporal selection patterns have clear
parallels with some known models in sex theory (Otto, 2009), as
temporal selection heterogeneity is the fundamental concept behind
the Red-Queen Hypothesis, and spacial selection heterogeneity has
also been proposed as one explanation for sex and recombination.
OgaraK can, therefore, be used to easily simulate and test some
models relevant to sex theory.

OgaraK can serve as a framework to more easily evaluate
drug deployment policies and help enhance the understanding
of fundamental variables underlying the spread of drug-resistant
malaria.

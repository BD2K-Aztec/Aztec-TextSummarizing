Abstract

Summary: A new pKa prediction web server is released, which implements DelPhi Gaussian dielec-
tric function to calculate electrostatic potentials generated by charges of biomolecules. Topology par-
ameters are extended to include atomic information of nucleotides of RNA and DNA, which extends
the capability of pKa calculations beyond proteins. The web server allows the end-user to protonate
the biomolecule at particular pH based on calculated pKa values and provides the downloadable file
in POR format. Several tests are performed to benchmark the accuracy and speed of the protocol.
Implementation: The web server follows a client-server architecture built on PHP and HTML and
utilizes DelPhiPKa program. The computation is performed on the Palmetto supercomputer cluster
and results/download links are given back to the end-user via http protocol. The web server takes
advantage of MP1 parallel implementation in DelPhiPKa and can run a single job on up to 24 CPUs.
Availability and implementation: The DelPhiPKa web server is available at http://compbio.clemson.

1 Introduction

Biological processes are affected by the pH of the cellular environ-
ment. For example, enzyme catalysis, protein folding and binding,
protein-protein interactions are all pH-dependent (Alexov et al.,
1997; Mitra et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012). Different protonation
states of titratable residues within molecules due to pH changes can
result in significantly different complex conformations and binding
free energies. Fast and accurate predictions for pK,1 values of ioniz-
able groups will facilitate investigations aiming at designing better
drugs and more robust enzymes, which are active and stable over a
wide range of pH.

Although there are many programs for predicting pK,1 values of
protein ionizable residues such as MCCE (Alexov et al., 1997; Song
et al., 2009), UHBD (Madura et al., 1995), PROPKA (Li et al., 2005),
H++ (Gordon et al., 2005 ), which are based on various methods, to
the best of our knowledge, there is no pK,1 prediction web sever that
provides pK,1 calculations for RNAs and DNAs (Tang et al., 2007)

bases as well. Here, we developed a new pK,1 web server that imple-
ments the following features (i) calculates pK,1 values for the protein,
RNA and single stranded DNA, (ii) protonates the structure at user-
specified pH according to calculated pKa, (iii) provides the option of
various force field parameters (AMBER, CHARMM, PARSE,
GROMOS), (iv) calculates electrostatic free energy components with
the Gaussian dielectric function without defining molecular surface
and (v) provides different hydrogen conformations. The web server is
implemented in DelPhiPKa program and built on the supercomputer
cluster to take advantage of MP1 parallelization, which improves the
computation speed up to 20 times.

2 Methods

2.1 Back-end program DelPhiPKa
The web server is built on the pK,1 calculation program—DelPhiPKa,
which is written in the object-oriented C++ code. The methodology

of the back-end program is described in the supplementary material
and more details can be found in Wang et al. (2015).

2.2 Overall architecture of the web server

The server contains two components, the first of which is user interface
and second is the job submission/queue/running system. The user inter-
face is implemented using PHP and HTML. It contains various param-
eters for user input that control the back-end program and results
calculated by the algorithm. The job submission/queue system uses a
job monitor module written in bash/python scripts to sends/retrieves
the job information to/from the Palmetto supercomputer cluster.

2.3 User input parameters of the web server
The web server requires the following user input parameters and
each parameter has the corresponding function:

° Force ﬁeld. The server reads atomic charges and radii from the
speciﬁc force ﬁeld parameter ﬁle to calculate electrostatic poten-
tials and to produce the output PQR ﬁle.

° Remove HETATM. The server can remove all HETATM infor-
mation in the uploaded PDB ﬁle, making those HETATM not
involved in the calculations.

° HETATM in PQR format. If selected, the server reads the
HETATM information that is provided by users in PQR format
within the uploaded PDB ﬁle. This is applied to the calculations
involving ligands and solvent ions, for which the atomic informa-
tion is not included in the standard topology parameter ﬁle.

° Output protonated PQR ﬁle based on calculated pKa results. This
gives the option for users to download the protonated structure in
PQR format based on calculated pKa1 results and speciﬁc pH.

° Given pH value. It’s related to the previous parameter as the
user-deﬁned pH value to produce PQR output ﬁle.

° Hydrogen of ASP/GLU attached atom. These options provide users
to choose the hydrogen positions of aspartic and glutamic acids
(which atom should the hydrogen placed with) to be generated.

° Variance of Gaussian distribution. This is the sigma value in the
Gaussian function and our benchmark results showed that with a
low value (default is 0.70) the program performs better on surface
residues while a high value (e.g. 0.93) is better for buried residues.

° Reference dielectric. This is the reference dielectric constant for
the protein in the Gaussian function and the default is set 8.0
based on our benchmark results.

° External dielectric. This is the external dielectric constant for the
solvent water in the Gaussian function and the default is set to be
the widely adopted value of 80.

2.4 Results page and download links

The server provides pKa1 results with three download items. pKa.csv,
which contains the calculated pKa1 value for each individual ionizable
residue with electrostatic energy components for its protonated and de-
protonated states; titration. txt, which reports each individual ionizable
residue probability of protonation from pH of 0 to 14; (input_
pdhname).pqr, which is the protonated structure in PQR format with
each individual ionizable residue in its protonated or de-protonated
state based on the calculated pKa1 values and user selected pH.

3 Performance

3.1 Test of accuracy
We performed the benchmark with calculated pKa1 values against ex-
perimental results with three force fields (AMBER/CHARMM/

PARSE) to test the accuracy of pKa1 predictions. The dataset we used
is from Protein pKa1 Database (Toseland et al., 2006), which contains
302 experimental measured pKa1 values for titratable residues from 32
proteins. The parameters we used for this dataset are a = 0.70, emf =
8, aextem = 80 and others with default values. With three force fields,
we achieved an average RMSD of 0.77 (Supplementary Fig. 15) and
about 90% of the overall predictions less than 1.0 pK unit error. For
surface residues (72% of the dataset), we achieved an average
RMSDz0.55 (Supplementary Table 15).

We also benchmarked calculations on two RNAs with experi-
mental measured results by NMR spectroscopy: branch-point helix
(BPH) and lead-dependent ribozyme (LDZ) with 5 and 7 measured
pKa’s for adenosine residues, respectively. The topology information
and corresponding parameters used for nucleic acids are described
in the supplementary material. Results in Table 25 showed the pK,1
values were successfully identified in the correct order and 90% of
predictions are less than 0.6 pK units error.

3.2 Test of speed

The webserver is built based on DelPhiPKa program, which imple-
mented with MP1 parallelization for the distributed computing. The
server could run the job on the Palmetto supercomputer cluster with
8 or 24 CPUs. Here, we performed a speedup test of the paralleliza-
tion. According to the Supplementary Fig 25, the speedup could
reach 7.5x and 19.4>< with 8 and 24 CPUs (by increasing the num-
ber of CPUs, the huge memory usage and more communications be-
tween CPUs degrade the speedup).

Abstract

Motivation: Structural kinetic modelling (SKM) is a framework to analyse whether a metabolic
steady state remains stable under perturbation, without requiring detailed knowledge about indi-
vidual rate equations. It provides a representation of the system’s Jacobian matrix that depends
solely on the network structure, steady state measurements, and the elasticities at the steady state.
For a measured steady state, stability criteria can be derived by generating a large number of
SKMs with randomly sampled elasticities and evaluating the resulting Jacobian matrices. The
elasticity space can be analysed statistically in order to detect network positions that contribute sig-
nificantly to the perturbation response. Here, we extend this approach by examining the kinetic
feasibility of the elasticity combinations created during Monte Carlo sampling.

Results: Using a set of small example systems, we show that the majority of sampled SKMs would
yield negative kinetic parameters if they were translated back into kinetic models. To overcome
this problem, a simple criterion is formulated that mitigates such infeasible models. After evaluat-
ing the small example pathways, the methodology was used to study two steady states of the
neuronal TCA cycle and the intrinsic mechanisms responsible for their stability or instability. The
findings of the statistical elasticity analysis confirm that several elasticities are jointly coordinated
to control stability and that the main source for potential instabilities are mutations in the enzyme
alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.

1 Introduction

 

Metabolic systems tend to exhibit steady states that can be measured
in terms of the concentrations and ﬂuxes of the metabolites
involved. These measurements can be regarded as a phenotypic
representation of all the complex interactions and regulatory mech-
anisms taking place in the underlying metabolic pathway. Such
interactions determine the system’s response to external perturb-
ations and are responsible, for example, for its asymptotic stability
or for oscillatory trajectories around the steady state. However,
determining these perturbation responses in the absence of
fully specified kinetic models remains an important challenge of
computational systems biology.

Structural kinetic modelling (SKM) is a framework to analyse such
responses to perturbations, without requiring detailed knowledge
about individual rate equations (Reznik and Segre, 2010; Reznik
et al., 2013; Steuer et al., 2006). It provides a parameterized represen-
tation of the system’s Jacobian matrix in which the model parameters
encode information about the enzyme-metabolite interactions.
Stability criteria can be derived by generating a large number of struc-
tural kinetic models (SKMs) with randomly sampled parameter sets
and evaluating the resulting Jacobian matrices. The parameter space
can be analysed statistically in a Monte Carlo experiment in order to
detect pathway positions that contribute significantly to the perturb-
ation response. Because the sampled parameters are equivalent to the

elasticities used in metabolic control analysis (MCA) (Kacser and
Porteous, 1987), the results are easy to interpret biologically.

In order to perform an SKM experiment, it is not necessary to
specify the kinetic rate laws in detail. However, the sampling
procedure requires the selection of predefined intervals for each elas-
ticity. The common procedure is to choose the interval (0,1] for
sampling elasticities that should represent enzymatic reactions. This
interval corresponds to the range of possible elasticity values for re-
actions following Michaelis Menten kinetics.

In this work, we demonstrate that if the assumption of Michaelis
Menten kinetics holds true, only very specific combinations of elas-
ticities allow the steady state to be maintained with non-negative
kinetic parameters. Because of this, an easily applicable criterion is
introduced that enables detecting elasticity combinations associated
with negative kinetic parameters of enzymatic reactions.

Furthermore, we examine how the sampled elasticities can be
analysed to derive quantitative thresholds for instabilities. This ap-
proach was already used in the past to examine stability conditions
of the Calvin Benson cycle (Girbig et al., 2012b). In this work, we
illustrate how these conditions affect the underlying kinetic param-
eters of the model. We examine how a simple example system reacts
to inducing such instabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the
proposed methodology is applied to study destabilizing mechanisms
in the neuronal citric acid (TCA) cycle.

1.1 Introduction to SKM

Given a metabolic system with m metabolites S1, . . . ,Sm and n reac-
tions :21,  ,1)”, which can be defined by the ordinary differential
equation system

dS

— = N- S =: f S 1

dt V( ) ( ) I l

with stoichiometric matrix N, a steady state is defined as a point 8*
in the state space where no net changes in the concentrations can
occur and all reaction rates fulfill the mass balance equation

dS * _
EZN-V(S)—0. (2)

The response of the system in steady state to small perturbations de-
pends on the asymptotic stability of the steady state. When it is asymp-
totically stable, a coordinated system response enables the return of
concentrations and ﬂuxes to the same values prior to the perturbation.
If the steady state is unstable, such a return is not supported.

Local dynamic properties of a steady state, like stability or oscilla-
tory behaviour, can be derived from the Jacobian matrix evaluated in
the steady state (Heinrich and Schuster, 1996). Hence, only if the larg-
est real part of the eigenvalues is negative, changes evoked by perturb-
ations diminish over time and the steady state is asymptotically stable.
Oscillatory trajectories occur if eigenvalues form a complex conjugate
pair. The oscillation is damped, stable or increasing if the largest real
part of the eigenvalues is negative, zero or positive, respectively.

Computation of the Jacobian matrix typically requires know-
ledge of all kinetic rate laws and kinetic parameters describing the
reactions in the system in order to compute the partial derivatives
2—2. However, SKM enables the computation of the Jacobian matrix
without relying on such knowledge. Instead, it is derived by

The Jacobian matrix can thus be computed by the simple matrix
multiplication

Js* = A - E, (4)

where the matrix E contains the elasticities  , and A E R7” is the
matrix of normalized stoichiometric coefficients 2,3,;

Elasticities are a central concept from MCA (Fell and Sauro,
1985; Fell, 1997; Kacser and Porteous, 1987). If associated with en-
zyme-catalysed reactions, they indicate the amount of saturation of
the enzyme with a particular metabolite. Because of this interpret-
ation, the sampled elasticities in SKM experiments are also called
‘saturation parameters’ (Steuer et al., 2006). In particular, the larger
the absolute value of an elasticity, the less the enzyme catalysing the
reaction is saturated with its metabolite (Wang et al., 2004).

As demonstrated by Equation (4), the Jacobian matrix for a
given steady state, for which experimental measurements are avail-
able, can be derived solely from a set of model parameters (elastic-
ities) E 6 RM”, the stoichiometric matrix N, and the steady state
measurements 8* and v*. Although the stoichiometry, the steady
state concentrations and the ﬂuxes are experimentally accessible, the
elasticities are often unknown in practice. However, due to the nor-
malization step, they are restricted to pre-defined intervals, from
which they can be sampled in a Monte Carlo approach. This enables
the creation of a large number of models followed by the explor-
ation of the parameter space to detect regions associated with stabil-
ity or instability.

1.2 Deriving elasticities for enzymatic reactions

The interval boundaries for elasticity sampling are chosen according
to the type of kinetics employed by an enzyme. For example, if a re-
action v(S) follows irreversible Michaelis Menten kinetics

 

v(S) — me's, the corresponding normalized rate law )1 :=  can be

 

 

— S-l-KM
derived as
_ v(S) _ v(x-S*) _ Vmax -  i S* +KM
“(36) _ v(S*) _ v(S*) _ (x - S*) + KM Vmax - S* (5)
_ 5* + KM
_x(x-S*)+KM (6)

The derivative with respect to the normalized substrate x =  is

then given by

2 Results

2.1 Reducing the elasticity sampling space to ensure
kinetically realistic models

When performing an SKM experiment, the sampling interval (0, 1]
is often chosen for enzymatic reactions. This interval represents the
range of possible elasticity values for reactions following the revers-
ible Michaelis Menten Equation (10). However, calculation of
Michaelis constants from elasticities, as demonstrated in Equations
(15) and (16) shows that if the assumption of reversible Michaelis
Menten kinetics holds true, only very specific combinations of elas-
ticities allow the steady state to be maintained with non-negative
kinetic parameters. In particular, a closer inspection of Equations
(15 ) and (16 ) shows that K331 and KM are only non-negative for

of + 62; > 1. (19)

Because Michaelis constants are given in units of concentrations
and, as such, are required to be non-negative, elasticity combin-
ations not fulfilling this criterion are kinetically infeasible for any
given steady state. We therefore define elasticity filtering as restrict-
ing the randomly chosen values to those that fulfil this equation.

2.2 Effects of elasticity filtering on local dynamic steady

state properties

In order to systematically evaluate the effects of elasticity filtering,
three simple artificial example models were constructed (Fig. 1). For
each of these example pathways, a kinetic model with known rate
laws and kinetic parameters was created. These kinetic models were
used to compute steady state concentrations and fluxes for SKM

(details about the pathway structure and steady state values used for
SKM can be found in the Supplementary Material to this article.).

Out of 10 000 SKMs sampled for the linear pathway, only 907
(9.07%) were kinetically feasible in the sense that the randomly
sampled elasticities led to non-negative kinetic parameter values ac-
cording to Equation (19). For the branched and cyclic pathways,
only 891 (8.91%) and 944 (9.44%) feasible models remained. These
low numbers show that it is important to account for kinetical feasi-
bility when performing SKM experiments.

In order to assess whether filtering for feasible models can im-
pact the results of SKM experiments, probabilities of the different
types of dynamic steady state properties were compared before and
after filtering. As shown in Figure 2, the chance to observe oscilla-
tions strongly increased in each pathway. The elasticity combin-
ations fulfilling Equation (19) tended to have larger values than
independently sampled elasticities and hence described fast perturb-
ation responses of their associated enzymes. We can conclude that
such fast responses enhanced the chance for observing oscillations in
the examined systems.

2.3 Detecting conditions for stability or oscillatory
trajectories by multivariate pattern search

So far, most SKM experiments have focused on the detection of indi-
vidual enzymes to identify single reactions important for maintain-
ing the stability of a steady state (Bulik et al., 2009; Grimbs et al.,
2007). We recently extended this approach by demonstrating how
SKM enables the detection of enzyme- or metabolite-ensembles that
act together in an orchestrated manner to coordinate the pathway’s
response to perturbations (Girbig et al., 2012a, b). This was

achieved by replacing the previously used univariate approach by
supervised machine learning in order to search for multivariate pat-
terns of elasticities associated with stability or instability.

The decision tree algorithm lends itself to this task because it pre-
serves the original feature space, making it possible to interpret the
detected patterns in a biological context (Quinlan, 2013). In order
to assess the performance of decision trees in classifying stable ver-
sus unstable as well as oscillatory versus non-oscillatory models,
trees were trained on balanced datasets retrieved from the small ex-
ample pathways. In order to analyse the derived decision trees, we
studied the corresponding rulesets produced by the C5 .0 algorithm
for decision trees (Quinlan, 2013). These rulesets summarized all
paths through each tree in an easily readable format. After training,
the generalizability of each of the obtained decision tree rulesets was
assessed by the Laplace ratio

_hk—ek+1

Lk _ bk + 2 7 

where k is the ruleset index, bk is the number of hits in the test sam-
ples, and ek is the number errors on the test samples (Quinlan,
2013).

The smallest ruleset describing instability conditions for the
branched pathway contained two criteria. A closer look at+ this rule+-
set revealed that it imposed conditions on elasticities 6:: and 6::
(Table 1). It correctly predicted instability with a Laplace value of
0.98. Both elasticities described the acceleration of reactions 122 and
126 in Figure 1b by their substrates and were restricted to low values.
Consequently, the ruleset described a scenario of high saturation of
the enzymes by their substrates.

We next used the associated elasticity thresholds to compute the
corresponding ranges of possible kinetic parameters. In doing so, we
set both elasticities to fixed values and computed the matching
Michaelis constants using Equations (15) and (16 ). Maximum veloc-
ities were derived in a similar manner using Equations (17) and (18).
If the kinetic parameters lay within these boundaries, it was guaran-
teed that the system would still exhibit the same steady state while

fulfilling the constraints on the elasticities shown in the ruleset. As
shown in Table 2, the new parameters were distinctly reduced com-
pared with the original values in order to account for the reduced
degree of saturation described by the elasticity thresholds in the
ruleset.

In order to examine the behaviour of the unstable system around
the steady state, reactions 122 and 126 were updated by the new kinetic
parameters in the kinetic model for the branched pathway. The
Jacobian matrix of the updated model evaluated at the steady state
now contained the positive eigenvalue 0.0205, which shows that the
steady state indeed became unstable. In the original model, the
eigenvalues with maximum real parts had been a complex pair
—0.0629:0.0387i. Not only did this show that the new kinetic par-
ameters caused instabilities in the steady state, but the loss of the im-
aginary part also showed that they prevented oscillatory trajectories
around it.

To investigate the global response of the system to the instability,
the trajectories of the modified model were simulated starting in the
neighbourhood of the now unstable state. As shown in Figure 3, the
new stable steady state obtained by the system was not located in
close neighbourhood to the old one but showed a strong decrease in
the concentration of S1 accompanied by smaller increases in S2, S3
and S4. Computation of the rate laws of the original (unmodified)
model at these concentrations confirmed that they did not describe a
steady state in the original model.

2.4 The neuronal TCA cycle
The TCA cycle is of fundamental importance for cellular energy me-
tabolism because it is the major source for reduced nicotinamide ad-
enine dinucleotide (NADH) and ubiquinol (QH2), which are
required for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the
mitochondrion (Fig. 4). Its reactions are tightly controlled by allo-
steric feedback regulators to enable an adjustment of the steady state
ﬂuxes to varying ATP demands (Nelson and Cox, 2004). In neurons,
a steady supply of ATP is crucial for restoring the cellular membrane
potential after triggering an action potential. Once the system ob-
tains a functional working state that enables it to meet the ATP de-
mand of the cell, we can therefore expect this state to be robust
against perturbations from the cytosol (Koopman et al., 2012). Such
perturbations can arise, for example, due to neuronal activity and
the resulting fast fluctuations of ATP turnover.

To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for perturbation re-
sponses in this system, we investigated two steady states

Although state 1 (reference state) was characterized by a moderate
extent of neuronal activity, state 2 described a phenomenon called
‘gamma oscillations’. Gamma oscillations are defined as rhythmic
brain activity with alternating epochs of enhanced and reduced neu-
ron firing in a frequency of 30—100 Hz (Fell and Axmacher, 2011;
Singer, 2013). They have been associated with cognitive processing
and memory formation (Brittain and Brown, 2014; Hanslmayr and
Staudigl, 2014).

A recently published kinetic model (Berndt et al., 2012) served as
a reference for network stoichiometry and steady-state information.
The resulting SKMs covered 24 metabolites, 20 reactions and 71
elasticities. For each steady state, 20 000 SKMs were sampled and
the proportions of stable and oscillatory models were determined.
For both steady states, the majority of observed models was stable
(99.75% for the reference state, 99.85% under gamma oscillations)
and a large proportion did not display oscillatory trajectories (oscil-
latory models in the reference state: 37.24%; gamma oscillations:
39.66%).

The system contained three reactions with only one substrate
and product each (aconitase, fumarase, proton leak). The corres-
ponding elasticities were filtered using Equation (19). Using this cri-
terion, 76.08% of all models could be corrected for kinetical
feasibility in these reactions within each steady state. In 63.3% of
the resulting models the flux control coefficients computed from the
elasticities indicated negative control of pyruvate (PYR) import on
pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Consequently, an additional criter-
ion was implemented during sampling that only admitted models in
which PYR import exhibited positive control on the PDH. The pro-
portions of stable and oscillatory models remained similar after fil-
tering. Stability occurred in 99.56% of all models in the reference
state (99.84% under gamma oscillations), and oscillatory trajecto-
ries occurred in 34.96% of all models in the reference state (40.06%
under gamma oscillations).

Using these models, we next analysed whether multivariate ana-
lysis of the elasticity space could lead to more refined information
about the system dynamics than univariate comparisons of elasticity
distributions. In doing so, we compared the most distinctive

cycle, PYR from the cytosol is incorporated into citrate (CIT) and converted to
CO2 by a series of oxidation steps. The energy released in this process is uti-
lized to form the reduced metabolites NADH and 0H2. In the respiratory chain
complexes Cl, CII and CIV these metabolites are oxidized, driving the import
of protons into the mitochondrial matrix. As a result of this process, a proton
gradient is created which then serves as a driving force for ATP synthesis.

elasticities determined by the univariate Kolmogorov—Smirnoff test
(KS-test) with those elasticities that occurred most frequently in
each stabilizing decision tree ruleset (Table 3). This test enables the
comparison of two empirical distribution functions F1  and F2
using the test statistic Dks = sup x |F1 — F2 which describes
the maximum distance between the distribution functions (Darling,
1957). Both methods identified elasticities associated with citrate
synthase (CITS) and oc-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (AKGDH) as
having strongest influence on stability. In contrast to the KS-test,
however, decision trees identified two network positions that had
exceptionally strong impact on controlling stability under gamma
oscillations but not in the reference state (elasticities marked in red
in Table 3). Both positions were associated with reactions down-
stream of the cycle that were involved in the respiratory chain and
ATP synthesis. Because such a shift in control can be expected under
increased ATP demand, this result is not a surprise in itself.
However, it shows that multivariate pattern search can provide a
more refined picture of stability control under varying environmen-
tal conditions.

In order to understand possible causes for instabilities in the net-
work, decision tree patterns associated with the unstable class were
obtained. The simplest pattern contained only two conditions which
both restricted substrate activation and product inhibition of
AKGDH to low values. The pattern was highly reproducible be-
tween both states. This showed that a slow perturbation response of
AKGDH posed a threat to the stability of the observed steady states.
In order to understand the reasons for instabilities caused by the
described conditions, the eigenvectors belonging to the largest real
parts of the affected models were analysed. Eigenvectors of the

where b; and 2,- are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Jacobian
matrix in the steady state. Each eigenvector component therefore de-
scribes the time-dependent concentration changes in one metabolite.
Analysis of the eigenvector with largest real part indicated that per-
turbations led to an accumulation of AKG, accompanied by a de-
crease in the subsequent TCA cycle metabolites (Fig. 5).

3 Discussion

In this work, we demonstrated that if the assumption of Michaelis
Menten kinetics holds true, only very specific combinations of elas-
ticities allow the steady state to be maintained with non-negative
kinetic parameters. Because of this, an easily applicable filtering cri-
terion for enzymatic reactions with a single substrate and product
was introduced, that enabled the detection of elasticity combin-
ations associated with negative kinetic parameters.

Without elasticity filtering, the large abundance of SKMs with
kinetically implausible elasticity combinations can bias the output of
the numerical simulation. For example, analysis of a set of simple
example pathways showed that even for small models with 9—11
sampled elasticities, ~90% of the resulting SKMs contained elasti-
city combinations that required at least one negative value in the
kinetic parameters in order to enable emergence of the observed
steady state. Focusing only on those models with non-negative kin-
etic parameters hardly changed the numbers of stable models, but
strongly affected the frequency of oscillatory trajectories around the
steady state.

The idea of filtering the sampling space can be extended by tak-
ing into account further kinetic or dynamic restrictions on enzymes.
For instance, using the thermodynamic principle to limit the analysis
to thermodynamically feasible fluxes improves the predictive power
of metabolic models (Tepper et al., 2013). Furthermore, Monte
Carlo approaches for modelling metabolism could be refined by
incorporating such additional constraints (Murabito et al., 2014).

The filtering criterion introduced in Equation (19) offers a help-
ful starting point when sampling elasticities for reactions that can be
assumed to follow reversible Michaelis Menten kinetics. If
Michaelis Menten kinetics cannot be assumed it might still be pos-
sible to adapt the filtering criterion to reflect the underlying approxi-
mated kinetics. However, when analysing complex biological
systems, one has to be aware that the analytical derivation of similar
criteria for more complex rate laws is not possible in the same
straight-forward manner. For example, the TCA cycle model

Fig. 5. Eigenvector belonging to the largest positive eigenvalue in unstable
models of the reference state that fulfilled the simplest instability condition
derived by decision trees. Each eigenvector component describes the time-
dependent concentration changes in one metabolite in neighbourhood of the
steady state. Concentrations that increased due to a perturbation are shown
in blue; decreasing metabolites are shown in red. Instabilities arise due to ac-
cumulation of AKG and a depletion in the subsequent metabolites

analysed contained only four reaction with a single substrate and
product each. Although 76.08% of all models could be corrected for
kinetical feasibility in these reactions, the challenge remains to de-
tect similar criteria for the remaining reactions in order to refine the
results of the Monte Carlo sampling. Recent improvements along
this line were presented by Ivanov et al. (2014), who analytically
derived general stability criteria for certain structural motifs of irre-
versible reactions with multiple substrates or products in the absence
of regulatory interactions.

In addition to introducing elasticity filtering, we illustrated in
this work how decision trees can derive refined multivariate elasti-
city patterns associated with different dynamic steady state proper-
ties. Such patterns can also capture scenarios in which a certain
dynamic property only emerges for a small parameter interval.
Because the Monte Carlo sampling in a high-dimensional space only
allows a sparse coverage of the parameter space, one has to keep in
mind that the derived rulesets do not capture all possible scenarios
that might theoretically emerge. When applying the proposed strat-
egy to a system of interest, it is therefore important to chose a sam-
ple size that is high enough to enable the emergence of reproducible
patterns, and to assess the generalization error on independently
sampled test sets.

4 Methods

4.1 Model construction

In order to account for the impact of pathway topology on the dy-
namic properties of steady states of a metabolic network, kinetic
models were constructed using three different pathway structures
(Fig. 1). Kinetic parameters and rate laws were chosen as uniformly
as possible in order to eliminate their inﬂuence on the outcome of
the analysis. KM values were set to the 3 for forward reactions and
to 30 for backward reactions. VmX values were homogeneously set

to 1 (Supplementary Material for details). All reactions were mod-
elled using reversible Michaelis Menten kinetics. A positive feedback
term was included to increase the range of possible dynamic behav-
iours. Models were implemented in Matlab using the Systems
Biology Toolbox 2 for Matlab (Schmidt and Jirstrand, 2006 ).
Steady states were computed using the SBsteadystate function of the
Toolbox. SKMs were constructed using the MATLAB Toolbox for
SKM (Girbig et al., 2012a). Elasticity filtering was conducted during
Monte Carlo sampling by testing for each set of randomly sampled
elasticities whether they fulfilled the criterion in Equation (19).

For TCA cycle analysis, the kinetic model by Berndt et al. (2012)
served as a reference for network stoichiometry and steady-state infor-
mation. Two steady states were computed for SKM analysis which
represented different degrees of workload imposed on the cell. The
first state (also called reference state) represented a situation where
cytosolic 02 consumption was 50% of its maximum value. This cor-
responded to a moderate work amount of ATP consumption by the
cell (Berndt et al., 2012). In contrast, the second state (gamma oscilla-
tions) represented a scenario of strong workload and was computed
by setting cytosolic O2 consumption to 90% of the maximum value.

4.2 Model analysis

For each steady state, the numbers of stable and unstable SKMs were
counted in the unbalanced dataset of 104 randomly sampled models
with and without filtering for biological feasibility. Oscillatory and
non-oscillatory models were analysed in a similar manner.

Decision tree training was performed using the 5.0 library in R
(Kuhn et al., 2014) in the RULES mode. In total, 105 SKMs were
created as independent test samples. Because our aim was to derive
reliable conditions for stability and instability, we selected only
those rulesets with Laplace ratio > 0.95 that were derived from five
trees trained on 20 000 training samples each.

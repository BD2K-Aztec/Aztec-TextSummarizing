ABSTRACT

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are major regulators of gene ex-
pression in plants and animals. They recognize their target messenger
RNAs (mRNAs) by sequence complementarity and guide them to
cleavage or translational arrest. So far, the prediction of plant
miRNA—target pairs generally relies on the use of empirical parameters
deduced from known miRNA—target interactions.

Results: We developed comTAR, a web tool for the prediction of
miRNA targets that is mainly based on the conservation of the poten-
tial regulation in different species. We used data generated from a
pipeline applied to transcript datasets of 33 angiosperms that was
used to build a database of potential miRNA targets of different
plant species. The database contains information describing each
miRNA—target pair, their function and evolutionary conservation,
while the results are displayed in a user-friendly interface. The tool
also allows the search using new miRNAs.

Availability and implementation: The Web site is free to all users,
with no login requirements, at http://rnabio|ogy.ibr—conicet.gov.ar/
comtar.

1 INTRODUCTION

microRNAs (MiRNAs) are small RNAs processed from larger
precursors with foldback structures by ribonuclease type III en-
zymes (Bologna et al., 2012). The mature miRNAs are assembled
into ARGONAUTE complexes and recognize target messenger
RNAs (mRNAs) by partial base complementarity to control
their translation and stability (Axtell, 2013). Ancient miRNAs
conserved across angiosperms with important biological roles
have been identiﬁed, some of them even found in gymnosperms,
ferns, lycopods and mosses (Cuperus et al., 2011). The prediction
of miRNA targets in plants usually relies on the total number
and position of mismatches and the minimum free energy (MF E)
hybridization (Allen et al., 2005; Dai and Zhao, 2011; Jones-
Rhoades and Bartel, 2004; Rhoades et al., 2002; Schwab et al.,
2005; Wang et al., 2004). Usually, miRNA-binding sites are
conserved during evolution, and their conservation between
Arabidopsis thaliana and rice has been exploited to identify
miRNAs and targets (Jones-Rhoades and Bartel, 2004). More

recently, it has been shown that the conservation of the target
sites using partial genomic information can be used to identify
new targets for conserved miRNAs in plants (Chorostecki et al.,
2012). Here, we present comTAR, a web-based application for
the identiﬁcation of miRNA targets in plants based on sequence
conservation during evolution. The tool allows users to analyze
the variations of known miRNA targets during evolution, and to
predict new miRNA targets.

2 METHODS
2.1 MiRNA and transcript sequences

Because miRNA sequences can vary in different species, especially pos-
itions 1, 20 and 21 (Chorostecki et al., 2012), we used sequences 2—19
(18 nt) for the search. If there were still variations between different
miRNAs of the same family, we used the most common sequence con-
sidering the genomes of A.thaliana, poplar and rice (miRNA consensus
sequence), as described earlier (Chorostecki et al., 2012). The user can
also search with new small RNA sequences. Plant transcript sequence
data were extracted from libraries of the Phytozome project (http://
www.phytozome.net/), formed by nucleotide FASTA format ﬁles of
spliced mRNA transcripts (UTR, exons), with or without alternative
splice variants.

2.2 Target search

Target search was performed using PatMatch (Y an et al., 2005), which
allows mismatches (insertions, deletions and substitutions). We searched
for potential targets with four mismatches (substitutions and insertions)
to the 18 nt miRNA consensus, while G:U wobbles and bulges were also
considered as mismatches.

2.3 Additional features

We have integrated third-party tools and in-house scripts to make the
search for targets more powerful and useful.

0 To perform the alignment of the miRNA—target pair, we developed
an implementation of the Needleman—Wunsch dynamic program-
ming algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) in Perl (http://
www.perl.org/).

o RNAhybrid (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid/)
(Kruger and Rehmsmeier, 2006) was integrated by developing in-
house scrpits to ﬁnd the MFE hybridization of the miRNA—target
duplex for each candidate.

0 Candidate sequences were labeled with the best A.thaliana TAIRlO
hit locus identiﬁer (ID) as a TAG, using the annotation ﬁles of
Phytozome. Genes from different species having the same TAG
were grouped together.

0 Each A.thaliana TAG was indexed with a short description, curator
summary and computational description belonging to the TAIRlO
functional description ﬁle. Targets were also sorted into gene families
according to the TAIRlO classiﬁcation.

2.4 Web tool and data storage

ComTAR was designed as a web application implemented in an open-
source PHP framework (Codeigniter) for the Graphical User Interface
(GUI), but the analysis is based on a back-end written in Perl language,
and for data storage, we chose MySQL (http://www.mysql.com/). The
back-end performs the searches, the integration of third-party tools for
increasing the speciﬁcity and sensitivity and the generation of ﬁnal results,
whereas the front-end is responsible for displaying the results (Fig. 1A).
The TAG of the best hit in A.thaliana determines the number of species
that a hit is present, a parameter that is deﬁned by the user. The user can
search for targets of new miRNAs and also has access to graphical dis-
play of the miRNA—target alignment, the hybridization energy and a
ﬁlter for empirical miRNA—target parameters (Fig. 1B). Because plant
miRNAs generally regulate genes coding for proteins of the same family,
the tool has another feature that allows the search for targets by grouping
the results by families rather than by gene-TAG. Furthermore, users can
introduce a particular locus TAG (either the A.thaliana or Phytozome
gene ID), and comTAR identiﬁes the species where this particular gene
can be an miRNA target.

3 DISCUSSION

We developed a web tool, comTAR, that allows the character-
ization of miRNA—target interactions in different plant species.
The tool also allows the prediction of new candidates based
mainly on the conservation of the miRNA—target pair with a
relaxed number of mismatches. An advantage of the tool pre-
sented here is that evolutionary conserved miRNA—target inter-
actions might be likely involved in relevant biological processes.

The approach requests that miRNA targeting should be able to
occur in the context of a minimum set of interacting parameters
in different species. Therefore, the sequence of the target itself
does not need to be conserved. A previous report using a similar
strategy, but using a fewer species and datasets, was successfully
used to detect targets previously validated in A.thaliana and to
predict and experimentally validate new targets in A.thaliana
(Chorostecki et al., 2012). The web tool can also be used in a
reverse way to search for species where a gene of interest is po-
tentially regulated by an miRNA.

4 CONCLUSION

ComTAR allows users to predict and characterize miRNA-regu-
lated genes by focusing on the conservation of the potential tar-
geting. It provides an alternative strategy to other predictions
tools based solely on empirical parameters.

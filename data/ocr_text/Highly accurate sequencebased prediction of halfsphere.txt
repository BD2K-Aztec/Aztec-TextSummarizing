Abstract

Motivation: Solvent exposure of amino acid residues of proteins plays an important role in under—
standing and predicting protein structure, function and interactions. Solvent exposure can be charac—
terized by several measures including solvent accessible surface area (ASA), residue depth (RD) and
contact numbers (CN). More recently, an orientation—dependent contact number called half—sphere
exposure (HSE) was introduced by separating the contacts within upper and down half spheres
defined according to the Cor—CB (HSEB) vector or neighboring Cor—Cor vectors (HSEor). HSEor calculated
from protein structures was found to better describe the solvent exposure over ASA, CN and RD
in many applications. Thus, a sequence—based prediction is desirable, as most proteins do not have
experimentally determined structures. To our best knowledge, there is no method to predict HSEor
and only one method to predict HSEB.

Results: This study developed a novel method for predicting both HSEor and HSEB (SPIDER—HSE)
that achieved a consistent performance for 10—fold cross validation and two independent tests.
The correlation coefficients between predicted and measured HSEB (0.73 for upper sphere, 0.69
for down sphere and 0.76 for contact numbers) for the independent test set of 1199 proteins are sig—
nificantly higher than existing methods. Moreover, predicted HSEor has a higher correlation coeffi—
cient (0.46) to the stability change by residue mutants than predicted HSEB (0.37) and ASA (0.43).
The results, together with its easy Cor—atom—based calculation, highlight the potential usefulness of
predicted HSEor for protein structure prediction and refinement as well as function prediction.
Availability and implementation: The method is available at http://sparks—Iab.org.

1 Introduction

Measuring exposure of amino acid residues of proteins to solvent is
important for understanding and predicting protein structure, func—
tion and interactions (Gilis and Rooman, 1997; Lee and Richards,
1971; Rost and Sander, 1994; Tuncbag et al., 2009). The most com—
mon measure is solvent accessible surface area (ASA) (Connolly,
1983) with applications ranging from protein structure prediction
(Bennett—Lovsey et al., 2008; Wu and Zhang, 2008; Yang et al.,
2011) to protein function prediction (Lou et al., 2014; Zhang et al.,
2010; Zhang et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2011). The
inability of ASA to discriminate deeply buried residues from those
buried just beneath the surface leads to development of residue
depth (Chakravarty and Varadarajan, 1999) by averaging the dis—
tance to the nearest atom on the protein surface. Both ASA and resi-
due depth, however, require precise evaluation of the protein
surface in full atomic details that is time consuming. Having a time—
consuming calculation and requiring an all—atomic model limited the
usefulness of ASA and residue depth in the ab initio prediction of
protein structure where protein conformation is often represented
by main—chain atoms (Bradley et al., 2003; Faraggi et al., 2009) or
only COL atoms (Kihara et al., 2001; Yang and Liu, 2006) in initial
conformational sampling.

Another measure of residue exposure to solvent is contact num—
ber (CN), which counts the number of residues within specific dis—
tance cut offs. The distances are based on the positions of COL or CB
atoms. Thus, unlike ASA and residue depth, only a coarse—grained
model is needed for evaluating CNs. Different distance cut offs have
been used in earlier studies (Pollastri et al., 2002; Yuan, 2005). It
was shown that CN with a distance cut off between 12 and 14  is
the best for protein fold recognition (Karchin et al., 2004).

All above—mentioned solvent—exposure measures, however, do not
contain explicit information regarding the orientation of side chains
that are important for functional and structural studies. Hamelryck
designed a new measure by splitting the sphere around the COL atom
into two half spheres along the vector of COL—CB atoms (Hamelryck,
2005). The half sphere containing the CB atom was defined as upper
and the other as down half spheres. The numbers of COL atoms
enclosed in these two half—spheres were named as Half—Sphere
Exposure (HSE)—up and HSE—down, respectively. In addition, he has
substituted the vector COL—CB with a pseudo vector generated from the
sum of vectors COLi_1-C0Li and C0Li+1-C0Li. This HSE is denoted as
HSEOL (—up and —down) to distinguish from the HSE calculated based
on the COL—CB vector (here and hereafter, it will be annotated as
HSEB). HSEOL does not require the positions of CB—atoms. One advan—
tage of HSE is that its value is independent of amino acid type because
it describes a residue’s coordination environment rather than a quan-
tity related to its size such as ASA and RD. Interestingly, HSEOL-up
outperforms other solvent exposure measures including CN, ASA,
relative ASA, residue depth and the other three HSE definitions
(HSEB—up, HSEB—down and HSEOL—down) in correlation to changes in
protein stability due to mutations and to conservation of amino acid
residues (Hamelryck, 2005). More recently, HSE was found to be bet—
ter than ASA for prediction of B cell epitopes of proteins from their
three dimensional structures (Kringelum et al., 2012). HSE has also
been found useful in many other applications (Franzosa and Xia,
2009; Kringelum et al., 2012; Sweredoski and Baldi, 2008). Most of
these applications obtained HSE based on known protein structures.
Because the structures for most proteins are not known experimen-
tally, a sequence—based prediction is desirable.

Many sequence—based methods were developed for predicting
ASA (Adamczak et al., 2004; Ahmad et al., 2003; Cheng et al.,

2005; Dor and Zhou, 2007; Garg et al., 2005; Yuan and Huang,
2004) and CN (Kinjo and Nishikawa, 2006; Pollastri et al., 2002;
Yuan, 2005). However, there is no method available for prediction
of HSEOL and only one (HSEpred) for the prediction of HSEB (Song
et al., 2008). We found that the correlation coefficients between ac—
tual HSEB and those predicted by HSEpred (up and down, respect—
ively) are less than 0.43 for our dataset of 1199 proteins. One
possible factor is that HSEpred was trained on a small dataset of
632 proteins and was not tested on independent datasets. Therefore,
a more accurate method is clearly needed.

Recently, we developed a method called SPIDER 2 (Heffernan
et al., 2015) that utilized predicted secondary structures, backbone
torsion angles and ASA, iteratively, in order to improve their accura—
cies. The method achieved 82% accuracy for secondary structure
prediction, 0.76 for the correlation coefficient between predicted
and actual solvent accessible surface area, 19° and 30° for mean ab—
solute errors of backbone (p and \Il angles, respectively, and 8° and
32° for mean absolute errors of COL—based 0 and ‘E angles, respect—
ively, for an independent test dataset of 1199 proteins. Here, we
expand the iterative technique to the prediction of HSEOL (—up and —
down), HSEB (—up and —down) and CN by employing a large dataset
containing 4590 protein chains. The method was independently
tested in a dataset of 1199 proteins and a dataset of 69 proteins
from the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction technique
(CASP 11, 2014). As a result, highly accurate and robust prediction
was obtained (e.g. a correlation coefficient of 0.73 for HSEB-up,
0.69 for HSEB—down and 0.76 for contact number on the independ—
ent test set). Comparison to two previous methods for contact pre—
diction and HSEB confirmed the superior performance of the
method obtained. The HSEOL and HSEB predictors are incorporated
as a package in SPIDER 2 available at http://sparks—lab.org or down—
loadable as a standalone package.

2 Methods
2.1 Datasets

We have employed the same dataset as used in our previous study
(Lyons et al., 2014), which consists of 5789 proteins (1 246 420 resi-
dues). This dataset was generated by the sequence culling server
PISCES (< 25% pairwise sequence identity and <2.0A resolution)
(Wang and Dunbrack, 2003). From this dataset, 4590 proteins were
randomly selected as training set (TR4590) and the remaining 1199
proteins were utilized as an independent test set (T51199). In add—
ition, we downloaded the targets from critical assessment of structure
prediction technique (CASP 11,2014, http://www.predictioncenter.
org/casp11/). After removing redundant sequences (30% in between
or to the training set), we obtained a set of 69 proteins (CASP11) out
of original 99 proteins. This set contains 18 617 residues.

2.2 Input features

For each amino acid, we have extracted 69 input features. The first
20 features are substitution probabilities of amino acids from the
PSSM matrix. The PSSM is generated by PSI—BLAST (Altschul et al.,
1997) with three iterations of searching against 90% non—redundant
protein database (downloaded from ftp://toolkit.genzentrum.lmu.
de/pub/HH—suite/databasesl). The next 30 features are extracted
from the HMM—profile generated by HHblits with default param—
eters against Uniprot20 protein database (Remmert et al., 2011).
The HMM profile includes 10 transition probabilities between
matching, insertion and deletion states in addition to 20 substitution
probabilities. The additional 12 features represent predicted

structural properties of amino acids by SPIDER 2 that include pre-
dicted probabilities in three secondary structure states (Helix, Sheet
and Coil), ASA, and sine and cosine values of the main chain tor—
sional angles (q) and 1,0) and main chain angles between COL atoms (0
and I). Here, sine and cosine of angles were employed to remove the
effect of angle periodicity (Lyons et al., 2014). The last seven fea—
tures are physicochemical representatives (PP7) of twenty standard
amino acids, namely, a steric parameter (graph shape index), hydro—
phobicity, volume, polarizability, isoelectric point, helix probability
and sheet probability. Additionally, we utilized a window size of 17
amino acids (8 amino acids at each side of the target amino acid).
Together with a global feature of the protein length, this led to a
total of 1174 input features (17 X 69 —I— 1 = 1174). The window size
was taken from SPIDER 2 (Heffernan et al., 2015) without further
optimization.

2.3 Parallel multiple—step iterative deep neural—network
learning

Here, we implemented the same learning scheme as previously used in
SPIDER 2. As shown in Figure 1, the features were input into the
deep learning neural network to obtain an initial prediction of HSEs
(HSE—up, HSE—down and CN). The deep artificial neural network
consists of three hidden layers, each with 150 nodes. The input data
was normalized to the range of 0—1. The weights were initialized by
unsupervised learning from stacked sparse auto—encoders, and then
refined by using standard back propagation. In this study, we em—
ployed the deep neural network from the MATLAB toolbox, imple-
mented by Palm (2012). Deep neural networks have been widely
implemented in the prediction of protein structure (Nguyen et al.,
2014). In the second iteration, the predicted values from the first iter—
ation were added into the input features to predict HSEs. This process
iterated with updated predicted values until convergence. We found
that the prediction accuracy did not increase after two iterations. The

training process was performed separately for HSEOL (HSEOL—up,
HSEOL—down and CN) and HSEB (HSEB—up, HSEB—down and CN).
All contacts are defined with 13  distance cut off.

2.4 Evaluation method

The method was first examined by 10—fold cross validation where
the training set TR45 90 was randomly divided into 10—folds. Nine
folds were used in turn for training and the remaining one for testing
until all 10—folds were tested. As SPIDER 2 has been trained in the
same training set, we avoided over—training by following the same
10-folds and utilizing the 10—fold cross validation results during the
training of SPIDER 2 as input features. Moreover, we tested our
method in the independent test sets T51199 and CASP11 dataset by
using TR4590 as the training set. The prediction performance of
CN, HSEOL and HSEB was measured by Pearson correlation coeffi—
cient (PCC) as used in previous studies (Song et al., 2008; Yuan,
2005 ).

3 Results and discussions

3.1 Overall prediction performance

Figure 2 and Table 1 show the results of 10—fold cross validation
and independent test in the first four iterations for prediction of CN,
HSEB-up and HSEB—down. For the independent test, PCCs achieve
the highest value at the second iteration with 0.734, 0.693 and
0.756 for HSEB—up, HSEB—down and CN, respectively. The same is
true for 10—fold cross valuation. Thus additional iterations are un—
necessary. We also noted that the correlation coefficients from the
10—fold cross validation and from the independent test set are essen—
tially the same. For example, PCCs for CN at the second iteration
are 0.757 and 0.756 for 10—fold cross validation and independent
test, respectively. PCC for HSEB up at the second iteration are 0.733
and 0.734 for 10—fold cross validation and independent test, respect—
ively. High consistency between 10—fold cross validation and inde—
pendent test indicates the robustness of our trained method. The
small standard deviations between ten subsets from 10—fold cross
validation further confirm a stable performance.

We further found that the accuracy for HSEOL is similar to that of
HSEB. For example, The PCCs of HSEOL—up and HSEB—up at the se—
cond iteration for independent test are 0.729 and 0.734, respect—
ively. The PCCs of HSEOL—down and HSEB—down at the second
iteration for independent test are 0.717 and 0.693, respectively.
Because of similarity between HSEOL and HSEB, here and hereafter,
we will only present the results for HSEB from the second iteration
based on the independent test unless specifically mentioned.

3.2 The contribution from each feature group

It is of interest to know the contribution of each feature group to the
overall prediction performance of SPIDER—HSE. Table 2 compares
PCCs by utilizing a single feature group or by removing them indi-
vidually from SPIDER-HSE. In the first test, predicted ASA is the
single best feature as it achieved the highest PCC of 0.72, 0.69 and
0.64 for CN, HSE—up and HSE—down, respectively. This is under—
standable because ASA and CN both describe the level of solvent ex—
posure. Such high correlation confirms the suitability to substitute
ASA by the simpler representation of solvent exposure by HSE. The
performance of two conservation profiles HMM and PSSM is only
slightly worse than ASA with HMM marginally better than PSSM.
The physical parameters alone without sequence conservation infor—
mation can make a decent prediction with PCC around 0.5 for CN
and HSE—up.

validation.

One interesting observation is that predicted angles are more
useful than predicted secondary structure in predicting HSE—up
(0.58 versus 0.50) and HSE—down (0.54 versus 0.48) although they
contribute similarly in predicting CN (0.584 versus 0.586). This sug—
gests that continuous main—chain torsion angles have more orienta—
tion information than discrete states of secondary structure.

Another interesting observation is that protein length itself as a
single feature is not very useful in predicting HSE. Its combination
with other features, however, proved useful. Removing protein
length will reduce the correlation coefficient in the independent test
from 0.75 6 for CN to 0.740. This is the largest reduction, compared
to removing other feature groups. The relatively small change by
removing other feature groups is partly due to high redundancies be—
tween these feature groups.

For example, HHM and PSSM describe residue conservation
during evolution, whereas secondary structure and main—chain
angles both represent the main—chain conformations. In addition,
ASA, SS and main—chain angles have been obtained from PSSM and
PP7 feature groups for their prediction. Nonetheless, a drop in per—
formance by removing any single feature group indicates usefulness
of all these features for the overall performance.

3.3 Comparison to previous methods

To compare our results with previously reported methods, we repro—
duced the results of HSEpred by both its locally running version and
online server (http://sunflower.kuicr.kyoto—u.ac.jp/~sjn/hse/links.
html) on test sets T51199 and CASP 11. In addition, we compared
with a contact number prediction method CRNpred (Kinjo and
Nishikawa, 2006) (http://ipr.pdbj.org/crnpredl). As shown in Table
3, the PCC values for HSE are less than 0.5, compared to 0.7 from
our method for both test sets. Our predicted CN (PCC:0.76 for
the independent test set) are also significantly more accurate than ei—
ther HSEpred (PCC:0.56) or CRNpred (PCC:0.70). A similar

result was obtained for the CASP 11 set. CRNpred was trained with
a contact defined by a cut off 12 A, whereas we have used 13  as a
cut off. To be consistent with CRNpred, we specially trained our
method based on 12A cut off. The accuracy of our method is un—
changed. This is not surprising as the correlation coefficient between
the contact number from the cut off of 12  generated from protein
structures is highly correlated to the contact number from the cut off
of 13 A (PCC: 0.976).

3.4 Correlation of predicted HSE to the stabilities of
mutants
To examine the usefulness of sequence—based prediction of HSE, we
compared predicted HSE to the stabilities of mutants. Hamelryck
found that HSE from protein structures strongly correlates with ex—
perimentally measured stability changes due to mutation (Hamelryck,
2005). Here, we expanded the stability dataset by using protherm
database recently updated in 2013 (Kumar et al., 2006). As with
Hamelryck, we limited point mutants from VAL/ILE/LEU to ALA.
These three residues were selected because mutations from small
hydrophobic residues to ALA will not cause significant changes in
polar interaction or in global conformations. Therefore, the protein
stability change is dominated by the change of solvent accessibility,
and thus eligible for evaluating solvent exposure measures. A total of
220 mutants were found after removing two outliers with AAG above
3.0 kJ/mol (details listed in Supplementary Materials).

As shown in Table 4, HSEOL—up, HSEB—up, CN and ASA calcu—
lated from experimental structures consistently have strong correl—
ation to AAG (negative correlation for HSEOL—up, HSEB—up and CN

with PCC : —0.595, —0.541 and —0.494 respectively, positive cor—
relation for ASA with PCC:0.538). Negative correlation for CN
and HSE—up is because CN is negatively correlated to ASA (i.e. more
contacts mean less solvent accessible). Thus, HSEOL—up has the best
correlation, which confirmed the result of the previous study
(Hamelryck, 2005) with a larger dataset. For predicted CN, HSE and
ASA, the correlations to experimental AAG become weaker.
Predicted HSEOL—up has the best correlation with PCC : —0.46 1.

One interesting observation is that HSE—down has no correlation
to AAG. Similar results were obtained earlier (Hamelryck, 2005 ).
This is consistent with our physical intuition that the contacts with
the front of the side—chain of an amino acid residue contribute most
to the interaction of this residue to other amino acid residues.
Although the correlation, as shown in Figure 3, between HSEOL—up
and AAG is only slightly stronger (PCC:—0.461) than that be—
tween ASA and AAG (PCC: 0.438), the much simpler calculation
of HSEOL-up than that of ASA will make it more useful in structure
prediction. The fact that HSEOL—up (PCC: —0.46) correlates better
than HSEB—up to AAG (PCC : —0.37) indicates the importance of a
separate predictor for HSEOL developed here.

4 Conclusions

This work has developed the first sequence—based method for pre—
dicting HSEOL, in addition to prediction of HSEB and contact num—
ber. Trained by a large dataset of >4000 proteins and independently
tested by two separate datasets, we showed that our predictions of
HSEB and contact numbers are significantly more accurate than
existing methods (HSEpred and CRNpred) with correlation coeffi—
cients between predicted and actual number at about 0.7 for 10—fold
cross validation and independent tests. This highly accurate predic—
tion was built on highly accurate prediction of secondary structure,
backbone angles and solvent accessible surface area by our previous
method SPIDER 2. Another contribution was from the established
iterative deep learning scheme. The deep neural network allows us
to train the server on a dataset that is >7 times larger than the previ—
ous method HSEpred, and thus avoids potential over—training of the
predictor. In addition, DNN was found to be much faster to

converge with better performance than SVM and random forest
methods in training big datasets with a large number of features
(Bengio and LeCun, 2007; Schmidhuber, 2015). The usefulness
of predicted HSEOL is demonstrated by its improved correlation to ex—
perimentally measured stability change due to mutation, over pre—
dicted ASA.

Fast calculation of HSEOL that requires the positions of COL atoms
only makes it an ideal sequence—specific restraint for coarse—grained
modeling, protein structure prediction and refinement. The HSEOL
and HSEB predictors are incorporated as a package in SPIDER 2
available at http://sparks—lab.org. To speed up calculations, we pro—
vide another version by using all features except HMM profile. This
version leads to a slight reduction in PCCs but cuts the total running
time by half because it requires to prepare only one of the two se—
quence profiles that are the most time—consuming.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: When working with non-model organisms, few if
any species-specific markers are available for phylogenetic,
phylogeographic and population studies. Therefore, researchers
often try to adapt markers developed in distantly related taxa,
resulting in poor amplification and ascertainment bias in their target
taxa. Markers can be developed de novo and anonymous nuclear loci
(AN L) are proving to be a boon for researchers seeking large numbers
of fast-evolving, independent loci. However, the development of ANL
can be laboratory intensive and expensive. A workflow is described
to identify suitable low-copy anonymous loci from high-throughput
shotgun sequences, dramatically reducing the cost and time required
to develop these markers and produce robust multilocus datasets.
Results: By successively removing repetitive and evolutionary
conserved sequences from low coverage shotgun libraries, we were
able to isolate thousands of potential ANL. Empirical testing of loci
developed from two reptile taxa confirmed that our methodology
yields markers with comparable amplification rates and nucleotide
diversities to ANLs developed using other methodologies. Our
approach capitalizes on next-generation sequencing technologies
to enable the development of phylogenetic, phylogeographic and
population markers for taxa lacking suitable genomic resources.

1 INTRODUCTION

In a recent review, Thomson et al. (2010) noted that next— generation
sequencing methodologies make the acquisition of many—marker
datasets readily feasible. The ability to generate libraries of random
sequence from across the genome at a relatively low expense
has already changed the way that markers are developed for
phylogenetic and population genetic studies. In particular, the use of
the Roche 454 platform for generating large fragments of randomly
sheared genomic DNA has already provided a wealth of markers.
Most marker development studies have focussed on the large
number of microsatellites that can be readily obtained from partial
sequencing runs on non-model organisms (e.g. Abdelkrim et al.,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

2009; Allentoft et al., 2009), and large numbers of species can be
analysed simultaneously on this platform (Gardner et al., 2011).
In addition, almost entire mitochondrial genomes and a number
of protein-coding genes (Rasmussen and Noor, 2009) have been
recovered from these kind of data. One class of marker that should
be present in high numbers but has yet to be exploited from these
data are anonymous nuclear loci (ANL) (Karl and Avise, 1993).

ANL represent randomly selected fragments of DNA that, by
chance, are likely to be from non-coding regions of the genome,
given that a large percentage of eukaryotic genomes comprise
non—coding regions (Thomson et al., 2010). The advantages of
these markers are numerous: they are likely to be independent;
not biased to a single area of the genome and unlikely to be
under selection and so free to accumulate mutations at varying
rates, providing a suite of sufﬁciently fast-evolving markers
useful for phylogenetics, phylogeography and population genetics.
ANL have been successfully used in multilocus reconstruction
of phylogenetic (Thomson et al., 2008) and phylogeographic
(Rosenblum et al., 2007; Lee and Edwards, 2008) histories. A
criticism of using anonymous markers is that paralogous loci and
repetitive elements may go undetected, potentially confounding
phylogenetic and phylogeographic inferences (Thomson et al.,
2010). In addition, the development of these markers has required
intensive laboratory methods including a substantial amount of
cloning during development from small insert libraries (Lowe
et al., 1998; Jennings and Edwards, 2005), Bacterial Artiﬁcial
Chromosome libraries (Thomson et al., 2008) and Ampliﬁed
Fragment Length Polymorphism fragments (Brugmans et al., 2003).
Herein, we describe the development of ANL from randomly
generated sequences produced by the Roche 454 platform and
provide empirical data to evaluate the methods.

2 METHODS
2.1 Marker development

Sequence reads were generated for two squamate reptiles, the gecko Gehyra
lazelli and the sea snake Hydrophis spiralis, by sequencing randomly sheared
genomic DNA on the Roche 454 GS-FLX titanium platform at the Australian
Genomic Research Facility, Brisbane, Australia, following the methodology
of Gardner et al. (2011). Approximately, one-eighth of a titanium ﬂow cell for
each species returned a total of 87 899 reads for G. lazelli (average length

of 358 bp) and 149075 reads for H. spiralis (average length of 345 bp).
The sequences are available from the Dryad Digital Repository doi:10.5061/
dryad.flcb2.

A workﬂow was designed to successively ﬁlter out sequence reads of
non-interest (i.e. repetitive, highly conserved and coding sequences) using
software available in the public domain. All analyses were run on an Intel
quad core 2.4 Ghz PC with 8 GB RAM running Fedora Linux (Release 11).
When possible, parallel processing capabilities using multiple processor
cores were used to speed up analyses. Default parameter values were utilized
for all software unless otherwise stated. The sequences for each species were
analysed separately. FASTA formatted sequence reads were extracted from
the GS-FLX output ﬁles using the ‘sfﬁnfo’ program, available as part of
the Roche GSassembler suite. RepeatScout (Price et al., 2005) was used
to identify highly repetitive sequences in the data after running the build_
lmer_table script, which is included with the package. The repeat library
generated contained high copy number sequences including mitochondrial
fragments, simple sequence repeats (microsatellites), transposable elements
and species-speciﬁc repeats. This repeat library was used as a ‘custom
library’ in RepeatMasker (Smit et al., 1996—2010) to mask these highly
repetitive sequences in the original FASTA ﬁle. In addition, repeats included
in the Repbase Update (J urka et al., 2005) ‘repeatmaskerlibraries-20090604’
were also used with RepeatMasker to remove known repeats that were
present in low copy number. The parallel processing option was enabled
and the bacterial insertion element check skipped (using the ‘—no_is’ option).
Masked areas were removed from sequences using the Sequean PERL script
(available from http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/software) enabling the
parallel processing option. The Sequean script was run three times with the
minimum ‘clear range’ (-1 option) set to 250, 350 and 450 bp, respectively,
to determine the number of sequences of each size class available for further
analysis.

To remove highly conserved sequence or known coding regions, the
resulting reads were compared to existing GenBank sequences using
BLASTN (version 2.2.21). The makeblastdb package included in the
BLAST distribution was used to create local, searchable BLAST databases
comprising available messenger RNA (mRNA) and EST sequences from the
family Elapidae, which includes the subfamily Hydrophiinae, to compare to
the H. spiralis reads and similarly mRNA and EST sequences from the genus
Gekko to compare to the G. lazelli reads. An additional BLAST database
constructed from the squamate Anolis carolinensis genome (AnoCar 1.0,
February 2007, Broad Institute) was also used to screen each dataset.
Finally, matches to mitochondrial sequences from Bungarus fasciatus
(Elapidae: GenBank accession NC_011393) and Gekko gecko (Gekkonidae:
GenBank accession NC_007627) were determined to remove any low
copy number mitochondrial sequences not removed by the RepeatScout
program. High similarity matches, deﬁned as e-value <10‘4, were output
in tabular format and removed from the FASTA ﬁles using an in-house
PERL script. A PERL script automating the analysis pipeline to this
point is available from http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/assets/ﬁles/science/
evolutionary-biology-unit/anonmarker.tar.gz.

Primer design was carried out using the program ‘Primer3’ (Rozen
and Skaletsky, 2000), as implemented in software package Geneious, by
specifying a product size between 400 and 500 bp and using default setting for
optimal primer size (20 bp), Tm (60°C), %GC content (50%) and minimizing
hairpins and primer dimers.

2.2 Evaluation of anonymous nuclear loci

For all taxa examined, genomic DNA was extracted from frozen and
ethanol preserved tissue using a Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol
for DNA puriﬁcation from solid tissue. All loci examined were ampliﬁed
using either AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) or
HotMaster Taq polymerase (PerkinElmer) following standard PCR protocols
and visualization of double-stranded ampliﬁcation products on 1.5% agarose
gels. Puriﬁcation of PCR products and cycle-sequencing using the BigDye

Terminator v3.1 cycle-sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) was outsourced
to the Australian Genome Research Facility Ltd. (AGRF) in Brisbane,
Australia.

A subset of 15 loci for Gehyra and 17 for hydrophiine sea snakes were
assayed for ampliﬁcation success and polymorphism within each group.
Initial screening in Gehyra used G multilata and G lazelli which show
~15% divergence over 1200 bp of ND2 and ~5% for the protein-coding
gene PRLR (Townsend et al., 2008).

Sea snake primers were tested for cross-ampliﬁcation using four taxa
that span the crown hydrophiine sea snake radiation (H. spiralis, Enhydrina
schistosa, Ephalophis greyi and Aipysurus apraefrontalis). Ten additional
crown group taxa were added per locus to calculate the polymorphism
statistics presented in Table 3; the maximum corrected (HKY) pairwise
divergence among these taxa was ~ 18% divergence over 808 bp of the ATP
synthase gene and ~1.5% divergence at the PRLR locus. Polymorphism
statistics were re-calculated for a reduced set of recently diverged Hydrophis
subgroup species, which show maximum pairwise divergence of only 10%
for the ATP synthase gene and 0.3% for the PRLR locus.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Marker development

The number of sequences for each taxon with contiguous sequence
lengths >250, 350 and 450 bp after masking repeats and other
highly repetitive sequence is shown in Table 1. Since our aim
was to maximize the information from each locus developed for
screening, only sequences with lengths >450 bp were selected for
further development. Approximately 25—30% of these sequences
were discounted due to close matches to the mRNA, EST and
mitochondrial sequences obtained from GenBank or A. carolinensis
genomic resources (Table 2). The number of sequences for which we
were able to generate suitable primer pairs is also shown in Table 2.

3.2 Characteristics of the evaluated anonymous loci

Twelve of the 15 primer pairs tested in G lazelli ampliﬁed
successfully, while only six ampliﬁed for both this taxon and Gehyra
mutilata. Of the four loci that sequenced successfully, one was not
variable and one was polymorphic for a large (>500 bp) indel,

making it unsuitable as a phylogenetic marker. Of the 17 primer
pairs developed from H. spiralis, 12 ampliﬁed successfully in this
taxon and three other taxa spanning the sea snake crown group. Eight
of these loci were polymorphic across hydrophiines; however, ﬁve
showed evidence of paralog co-ampliﬁcation based on ﬁxed site
heterozygosity across all individuals and were discarded. Details
of the loci that ampliﬁed in all species and showed no evidence
of paralogs are shown in Table 3. For both reptile groups, the
anonymous loci exhibited comparable or greater nuclear diversity
than the other nuclear markers examined for that group.

4 DISCUSSION

The use of low coverage genome surveys has revolutionized
microsatellite development in non-model organisms (Gardner et al.,
2011), and we have now developed a workﬂow to further
exploit these genomic resources to develop markers suitable
for phylogenetic, phylogeographic and population studies. Our
approach targets low copy number sequences which, due to the
nature of the data and the methodology we have chosen, are likely to
be from non-coding regions of the genome. Although these regions
are likely to accumulate mutations relatively quickly, they are also
rich in repetitive elements.

Thomson et al. (2008) found that repetitive elements still posed
a problem after screening against GenBank and known repeat
libraries. Although we have also utilized known repeat libraries
in our methodology, our approach further minimizes potential
problems caused by repetitive elements by de novo determination
and exclusion of sequences that are repetitive within the dataset.
This effectively removes species-speciﬁc SINES and other high
copy number elements not present in repeat libraries or in public

databases. Paralogous sequences are more difﬁcult to detect but
removing loci with sites that are heterozygous across all sequenced
individuals has been demonstrated as a practical solution (Jennings
and Edwards, 2005 ; Rosenblum et al. , 2007), and this is the approach
we used for the sea snake analysis.

Even though we tested a small number of loci, successful
ampliﬁcation in the reference taxa (80% and 71% for G lazelli
and H. spiralis, respectively) is comparable to ampliﬁcation success
reported in other studies (65% in Rosenblum et al., 2007; 76% in
Thomson et al., 2008). During the screening process, the attrition
rate of markers was high, but the reasons for attrition varied,
primarily based on the phylogenetic span of trialled taxa. In the
Gehyra study, 50% of the markers did not amplify in the outgroup
and only one of the four sequenced products was invariant. In
contrast, within the more recently diverged Hydrophis group, 33%
of the loci tested were invariant and a further 42% showed evidence
of paralogs.

Nevertheless, the relatively high attrition rate of loci during
screening is more than offset by the large number of sequenced
fragments suitable for screening. If a larger pool of potential loci
are desired, increasing the size range of fragments considered or
altering primer design parameters will increase the yield of potential
markers.

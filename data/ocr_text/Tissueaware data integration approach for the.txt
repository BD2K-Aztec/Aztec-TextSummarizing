Abstract

Motivation: Leveraging the large compendium of genomic data to predict biomedical pathways
and specific mechanisms of protein interactions genome—wide in metazoan organisms has been
challenging. In contrast to unicellular organisms, biological and technical variation originating
from diverse tissues and cell—lineages is often the largest source of variation in metazoan data com—
pendia. Therefore, a new computational strategy accounting for the tissue heterogeneity in the
functional genomic data is needed to accurately translate the vast amount of human genomic data
into specific interaction—level hypotheses.

Results: We developed an integrated, scalable strategy for inferring multiple human gene inter—
action types that takes advantage of data from diverse tissue and cell—lineage origins. Our approach
specifically predicts both the presence of a functional association and also the most likely
interaction type among human genes or its protein products on a whole—genome scale. We demon—
strate that directly incorporating tissue contextual information improves the accuracy of our predic—
tions, and further, that such genome—wide results can be used to significantly refine regulatory
interactions from primary experimental datasets (e.g. ChlP—Seq, mass spectrometry).

Availability and implementation: An interactive website hosting all of our interaction predictions is
publically available at http://pathwaynet.princeton.edu. Software was implemented using the
open—source Sleipnir library, which is available for download at https://bitbucket.org/libsleipnir/lib

1 Introduction

 

The molecular activity in a cellular system is maintained by a com—
pleX interplay between genes, gene products, metabolites and the
environment (Hand and Hardewig, 1996). In particular, intricate
biomolecular pathways are formed by a combination of diverse

types of mechanistic pairwise interactions, including physical bind-
ing in protein—protein complexes (de Lange, 2005), small—molecule—
based modifications (Mann and Jensen, 2003) and regulatory
actions by activators and repressors (Cowell, 1994). Mapping out
these cellular pathways at a whole—genome level is a crucial step for

the advancement of human systems biology, aiding at every level
from deciphering cellular function to understanding the molecular
cause of many complex human diseases.

Functional genomic datasets such as gene expression, cellular lo—
calization and DNNprotein binding assays each captures distinct as—
pects of the cellular activity across multiple cell types and
perturbations. However, turning these different instances or ‘views’
of a complex system into an understanding of pathways has proven
to be a challenging undertaking. Especially in complex metazoan or-
ganisms, such as humans, tissue and cell type—specific expression
underlie cellular development, function, and homeostasis (Britten
and Davidson, 1969). Consequently, much of the biological and
technical variation of the functional genomic data is driven by tissue
and cell—lineage heterogeneity. Translating the vast amount of gen—
omic data into specific pathway—level hypotheses thus requires de—
velopment of algorithmic and statistical approaches that satisfy
three requirements: (i) inferring specific individual types of gene
interactions, (ii) being scalable to the whole genome and (iii) robust
in leveraging biological data from any of the diverse tissue contexts
(i.e. experimental results drawn from differing tissues and poten—
tially mixed samples or samples from tissue—culture experiments).

In this work, we developed a tissue—context aggregation—based
approach for predicting and studying multiple types of pathway—
level gene interactions for metazoan mammalian organisms, specif-
ically applying this approach to the human data compendium. For
our approach, we first built a catalog of tissue and interaction—type
specific gold standards (e.g. phosphorylation (kinase—substrate)
interactions among brain expressed proteins) restricted to gene pairs
coexpressed in any of 77 tissues based on curated pathway data—
bases and gene—to—tissue expression profiling. We then utilize a
Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Noble, 2006) to generate initial
predictions of multiple gene interaction types independently in the
context of each tissue (i.e. utilizing the tissue—specific gold standard)
by integrating ~1600 heterogeneous human experimental datasets
[e.g. mRNA expression, transcription factor (TF) and kinase motifs
and post—translational modifications (PTMs)]. Finally, we aggregate
the tissue—context based predictions to obtain the most probable set
of interaction labels or each gene pair across the set of pathway—level
interaction types (in this study we predict transcriptional regulation,
co—complex, phosphorylation and the more general post—transla—
tional regulation). Our methodology uniquely allows us to harness
the wealth of information in high—throughput genomic data collec—
tions by simultaneously separating the heterogeneity originating
from diverse tissues to improve signals for predicting different indi-
vidual interaction types.

To our knowledge, prediction of such genome—wide pathway—
level interaction networks in metazoans is an open problem. Many
recent studies have begun to address the challenges by inferring or
experimentally capturing physical interaction networks (Rhodes
et al., 2005; Rual et al., 2005; Schmitt et al., 2014; Stelzl et al.,
2005 ; von Mering et al., 2007), genetic interaction networks (Bassik
et al. 2013), Bayesian integration for functional association net—
works (Date and Stoeckert, 2006; Huttenhower et al., 2009; Lee
et al., 2004; Mostafavi et al., 2008; Park et al., 2013; Troyanskaya
et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2012) or predicting regulatory networks
from specific primary datasets (Margolin et al., 2006; Neph et al.,
2012a,b). However, most previous efforts for predicting pathway
interactions have been focused on unicellular model organisms (e.g.
Escherichia. coli) (Haynes et al., 2013; Marbach et al., 2012), while
genome—wide integrated analysis in mammalian organisms have
been focused on cross—species integration for inferring multiple types
of functional couplings [e.g co—membership to metabolic pathways,

signaling pathways or protein—protein interactions (PPI)]
(Alexeyenko and Sonnhammer, 2009). No prior integrative method
to our knowledge utilizes one of the most significant and important
sources of biological variation in human datasets: tissue context.
Although several tissue—specific datasets have been generated and
analyzed in previous work (Lonsdale et al., 2013; Su et al., 2004),
we demonstrate that methodological development is required in
addition to the inclusion of tissue—specific data to improve the pre—
diction accuracy of integrated interaction predictions in metazoans.
Our work extends the methodological advancements achieved
studying pathway interactions among a focused subset of genes or in
unicellular model organisms and provides a platform for applying
such methods to human data by addressing the challenge of tissue
heterogeneity.

Ultimately, we envision that our genome—wide interaction net—
works cannot only be useful to biology researchers investigating a
specific protein or interactions of interest, but also be leveraged
to increase the interpretability of new high—throughput studies
(ChIP—Seq, proteomics, disease samples, etc.) that capture condition—
specific cellular states. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the
utility of our networks by overlaying our interaction networks to
identify potential regulatory targets of TFs on 690 ChIP—Seq experi—
mental datasets generated by the ENCODE project (Landt et al.,
2012). In addition, we generated the first in vivo derived binding/
recognition motifs for cancer—associated TANK—binding kinase 1
(TBK1) by integrating our predicted phosphorylation network with
a recent TBK1 knockdown phospho—proteomics study (Kim et al.,
2013). Finally, we provide a web—based interface for exploring all
our interaction networks and integrative analysis of user data at
http://pathwaynet.princet0n.edu.

2 Methods

2.1 Tissue—aware integration

The final output of our new prediction pipeline consists of predicted
probabilities of gene pair associations for multiple pathway level
interaction types (e.g. transcriptional regulation, phosphorylation).
Each interaction type network is derived from tissue—aware integra—
tion of intermediate per—tissue based SVM classifiers (77 tissues
total) that capture tissue—relevant interaction signal while integrating
across ~50 000 genome—scale experiments. Details of the construc—
tion of gold standard interaction pairs, tissue context, SVM classifier
and input datasets are described in the following sections.

2.1.1 Interaction catalog construction

Unfortunately, there exists no comprehensive curated gold standard
repository for known human pathway level interactions. For each
interaction type evaluated here, we assembled a gold standard
from various sources that have collected experimentally validated
interactions. This resulted in 51 525 unique experimentally validated
positive interaction labels across four interaction types: transcrip—
tional regulation, phosphorylation, protein co—complexes and
post—translational regulation (individual term counts in
Supplementary Table S1). Detailed descriptions of interaction type
definitions and interaction gold standard construction are provided
in Supplementary Information.

All training, evaluation and predictions were limited to the
search space of gene pairs in accordance with the protein property
that defines each interaction type. Specifically, transcriptional regu—
lation was limited to the subset of gene pairs that included at least
one human TF [total 1321 TFs from annotation study (Vaquerizas

112 /310'spaumo [p.IOJXO'SOleIHJOJUIOICI/ﬁdllq 11101; prBOIIIAAOG

et al., 2009)]. Likewise, phosphorylation was limited to the gene
pairs that included at least one of 514 human kinases (Manning
et al., 2002) and post—translational regulation to the subset that
included at least 1 of 1881 protein modifying enzymes (e.g. includes
the 514 kinases, 217 e3 ligases) (Gene Ontology Consortium, 2004).
All genes and its protein products were represented by Entrez gene
ids and the final gene—holdout cross—validation background priors
used in evaluation were as follows: transcriptional regulation:
0.002; phosphorylation: 0.002; post—translational regulation:
0.0004; co—complex: 0.0005. These priors represent the fraction of
known interacting pairs over all positive and negative interactions
(negative example construction detailed in Supplementary
Information) and were utilized to calculate fold improvement over
background for each classification task.

2.1.2 Data sources and preprocessing

We collected a total of 1564 mRNA publically available human ex-
pression datasets (Affymetrix U133A and U133 Plus 2.0 platform)
from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Edgar et al., 2002)
(full list of GEO datasets listed in Supplementary Table S2).
Expression data were normalized according to the procedure
described in (Park et al., 2013).

For non—expression data, data types that closely related to the
output interaction type were excluded to avoid any circularity (e.g.
no physical interaction data was used in our prediction pipeline as
we observe a large overlap of co—complex or phosphorylation posi-
tive examples with PPI databases commonly used such as BioGrid
(Stark et al., 2011)). Motif information for TFs were obtained from
JASPAR (Sandelin et al., 2004), DNaseI profiling (Neph et al.,
2012a,b), FastCompare (Elemento and Tavazoie, 2005), CISBP
(Ray et al., 2013) and TRANSFAC (Matys et al., 2003), miRNA
from MSigDB mir database (Subramanian et al., 2005) and EBI
MicroCosm database (Griffiths—Jones et al., 2008) and protein kin-
ases from PhosphoMotif (Amanchy et al., 2007). Protein domain—
domain and motif interactions were obtained from PrePPI (Zhang
et al., 2013), DOMINE (Yellaboina et al., 2011) and the iELM web—
server (Weatheritt et al., 2012). For PrePPI, only the structure—based
protein—pair scores were exclusively extracted from PrePPI without
including the other types of non—structural data that were later inte—
grated in the study by Zhang et al. (2013). Short linear motifs were
identified for all human proteins from iELM. For each occurrence
three types of iELM scores were utilized: conservation score (reﬂect—
ing the overall quality of the motif conservation), relative local con—
servation score (reﬂecting the constraint on each residue relative to a
window of adjacent residues), and the IUPRED score (indicating the
level of protein disorder). PTM potential of proteins was derived by
catalogs made from UniProt (preiler et al., 2004) and PTMcode
(Minguez et al., 2012). To capture the cellular component profile
similarity between genes, we took the semantic similarity of Gene
Ontology (GO) (Gene Ontology Consortium, 2004) cellular compo—
nent annotation profile for terms that had more than 100 gene anno—
tations between all gene pairs (each GO term was weighted by the
normalized information content,

g  l GiEanyTerm

10< 100 >
g lGilGiEanyTerm

where i is the gene index and t is the GO term). To capture the

normIC =

phenotype similarity between genes, chemical and genetic perturb—
ation studies curated by the MSigDB (Subramanian et al., 2005)

were summarized into gene pairwise similarity phenotype profile
scores. Detailed descriptions of how each dataset were used as fea—
tures provided in Supplementary Information.

2.1.3 Human tissue context construction

In order to capture a wide variety of human tissues in our study, we
cataloged genes that are probabilistically identified to be expressed
across a set of 77 diverse human tissues utilizing the Gene
Expression Barcode methodology (McCall et al., 2011; Zilliox and
Irizarry, 2007). This methodology provides a probabilistic frame—
work for determining if an expression value is more likely to come
from an expressed or silenced (i.e. unexpressed) distribution, mod—
eled for each gene. Specifically in our study, biologically informative
tissue terms were curated from the BRENDA Tissue Ontology
(BTO) (Gremse et al., 2011). Next, text—mining of sample descrip-
tions and textual information available in GEO (Edgar et al., 2002)
was utilized to annotate expression samples to BTO terms (detailed
descriptions of the sample annotation process are provided in the
Supplementary Information). Next the Barcode methodology was
applied to each expression sample with a tissue BTO term annota—
tion (total 14 092 expression samples) and genes that had an average
Barcode probability above 0.7 across tissue annotated expression
samples were flagged as transcriptionally active in the tissue (results
robust to Barcode cutoff Supplementary Fig. S1).

2.1.4 Tissue-aware data integration

The goal of our integration is to harness the information from the
genomic data compendium to predict accurate pathway level inter—
actions. Specifically, the integration is designed to model and exploit
the tissue—specific variation across genomic datasets for robust inte—
gration in metazoan interactome prediction. Unfortunately, al—
though many diverse types of experimentally validated gene
interactions have been curated by multiple databases (Kanehisa and
Goto, 2000; Schaefer et al., 2009), the set of tissues in which any
given interaction occurs is often not annotated and usually un—
known. Thus, we take the approach of generating tissue—specific
interaction learning examples by overlaying the Barcode derived tis—
sue contexts onto the known gene interactions. Specifically, for each
interaction type, a SVM (Noble, 2006) classifier was trained per tis—
sue context. The training gold standard for each interaction type i
and tissue t was define as the following:

GS” : {gsgmgm |gmgm E Tissuet /\ (g, g Ubiq V gm g Ubiq)}

where gs is an interaction example for interaction type i, and genes
11, m. Tissue contexts t are all genes identified by our Barcode ana—
lysis to be transcribed in tissue t and Ubiq (ubiquitous) are genes
that are transcribed across all tissues. Thus, a gene pair was con—
sidered a tissue—specific interaction example if both genes were
expressed in the tissue, while ubiquitous gene interactions (i.e. inter—
actions between genes expressed in all tissues) were treated separ—
ately as an independent context to accurately capture tissue—specific
variation. Predicting for co—complex, we were unable to separate
out ubiquitous gene pair examples due to the high percentage of
such pairs ~84% (transcriptional regulation is ~35%) in the gold
standard.

For each training interaction example a feature vector was con—
structed from a total of 1590 datasets as described above.
Continuous expression features were binned into 0.2 z—score inter—
vals and missing values were set to 0 (Lewis et al., 2006). The set of

feature vectors for positive and negative training examples were
used to train a linear SVM according to the following formulation:

min 1 wTw —I— C if
$145,202 n i=1 ’

Vi: y,(wa,-)21 — 5,-

where n is the training example gene interactions, w is the weight
vector for each dataset, y, is the training label of interaction example
i and xi is the data vector for all the features for gene pair 1'. All clas-
sifiers were trained using the identical gene—wise 3—fold cross valid—
ation split and tissue—contexts with fewer than 30 gene pair cross—
validation training examples were dropped. Finally, we merged the
tissue—context based intermediate—predictions to obtain the most
probable set of labels for each gene pair by assigning the mean pre-
dicted score of the top quartile of prediction values across tissue—
contexts for each interaction type (performed best compared with
other aggregation methods based on our cross—validation results,
Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, one global ‘tissue—unaware’
classifier was trained for each interaction type using the entire gold
standard (i.e. non—tissue segmented). Also, we generated bagging—
like predictions for each interaction type, where the prediction pipe—
line (e.g. data) was set constant but each gene tissue expression
profile was randomly swapped between genes (resulting in equal
number of total tissue contexts and number of gene assignments).
All subsequent evaluation analyses were conducted using these gene—
wise 3—fold cross—validated networks (i.e. 3—fold cross—validation
split of genes with each fold of tissue—aware SVM training were con—
ducted among only gold standard pairs where both genes not part of
the held out gene set) to avoid any potential circularity.

2.2 Transcriptional regulation network used for analysis
of ChlP—Seq data

Six hundred and ninety ChIP—Seq (Park, 2009) datasets generated by
the ENCODE project were used to identify potential TF regulatory
targets for a total of 109 TFs. All ChIP—Seq data were handled as
‘Uniform Peaks’ identified based on the ENCODE analysis and nor—
malization pipeline (Landt et al., 2012). A gene was considered a
possible target of a TF if the TF’s ChIP—Seq peak overlapped a win—
dow surrounding the gene’s transcription start site (TSS). Windows
of :5 00, 1000 and 2000 bp were used to identify potential regula—
tory targets. Next, for each TF, specific GO biological process terms
(with 5—200 gene annotations) experimentally annotated to that TF
was identified. The potential regulatory targets of each TF identified
through ChIP—Seq data alone were then tested for enrichment of GO
biological processes associated with the TF using a hypergeometric
test. Next, our transcriptional regulation network was used to refine
ChIP-Seq identified targets by filtering away targets that associated
with the TF with a network probability score less than the prior
(i.e. no data support). The GO term enrichment analysis was then
repeated on the network—refined ChIP—Seq target genes.

2.3 Phosphorylation network used for analysis of
phospho—proteomics data

In addition to ChIP—Seq data, we demonstrated the utility of our net—
works to identify novel phospho—binding or recognition motifs from
mass-spectrometry proteomics data. We considered a mass spec-
trometry experiment that measured altered phosphoproteins follow—
ing RNAi-mediated knockdown of TBK1 (Kim et al., 2013). In this
study, a total of 1154 proteins were identified for a loss of

phosphopeptide (PEP score < 0.5 and Mass error < 5 ppm). Protein
motif discovery tool FIRE (Elemento et al., 2007; Lieber et al.,
2010) was applied to these differentially phosphorylated protein se—
quences to find enriched motifs that could potentially be TBK1 rec-
ognition sites in its targets. Next, similar to the ChIP—Seq example,
we refined the mass—spectroscopy targets using our predicted phos—
phorylation network by filtered out differentially phosphorylated
proteins that were linked to TBK1 with a network probability less
than the prior. FIRE was re—applied to this filtered set of differen—
tially phosphorylated proteins for discovery of enriched motifs.
Identical to the ChIP—Seq analysis, cross—validated networks were
used for the analysis.

2.4 Implementation

All software was implemented using the open—source Sleipnir library
(Huttenhower et al., 2008), which interfaces with the open—source
SVMperf package (Joachims, 2006) for linear kernel SVM classifiers
(error parameter C was set to 250 and error—rate loss function was
used). All network predictions and evaluations were conducted for
the 17 939 genes that were available on the Affymetrix U133A and
U133 Plus 2.0 platforms.

3 Results

We demonstrate the advantage of incorporating tissue context for
predicting multiple pathway—level interaction types (transcriptional
regulation, co—complex, phosphorylation and the more general post—
translational regulation). Specifically, we compare our tissue—aware
learning approach with a simpler version that does not use informa—
tion about tissue heterogeneity among human protein coding genes
(i.e. tissue—unaware learning). In total, we apply our tissue—aware
learning methodology integrating ~50 000 genome—scale experi—
ments to generate whole—genome networks prioritizing gene/protein
interactions with strong supporting evidence for each of the pre—
dicted pathway—level interaction types (prediction schematic shown
in Fig. 1). We demonstrate the utility of our interaction networks in
robustly retrieving pathway members across 447 expert—curated
pathways. In addition, we show our interaction networks can be
used to accurately identify false positive regulatory targets in pri-
mary user datasets generated by ChIP—Seq and Mass spectrometry
based phospho—proteomics.

3.1 Tissue—aware learning improves human gene
interaction predictions
To address the challenge of predicting pathway—level interactions in
metazoans, we ask the question if incorporating gene—level tissue
contextual information can improve network prediction. To
measure the benefits of this approach, we conducted a 3—fold cross—
validation experiment on both our tissue—aware learning method
and a simpler tissue—unaware learning method for predicting four
interaction types (i.e. transcriptional regulation, phosphorylation,
co—complex and post—translational regulation). For each interaction
type, we conduct a strict gene—wise holdout evaluation where at
each fold the evaluation gold standard pairs include no genes
observed during the training stage (i.e. SVM training feature vectors
consist of gene—pairs with no overlap with the holdout evaluation
set). In addition, identical human data compendium was used for tis—
sue—aware and tissue—unaware learning predictions.

For all four interaction types, there was a significant perform-
ance gain when using gene—tissue contextual information [P < 0.01,
testing for the difference of area under the curve (Hanley and

Fig. 1. Schematic of our tissue-aware integrative pipeline for inferring meta-
zoan gene interactions. We collect tissue and interaction-type specific gold
standards, restricted to protein pairs that are both expressed in the tissue,
based on curated databases and expression profiling of total 77 tissues. Next,
we infer each interaction type network by integrating the genomic data com-
pendium independently in the context of each tissue (i.e. with tissue-specific
learning examples), resulting in multiple intermediate tissue-context net-
works per interaction-type. Following, we integrate the tissue-context based
predictions to obtain the most probable set of labels for each gene pair across
the interaction types. Finally, our predicted networks can be used in multiple
applications such as pathway retrieval or aiding the interpretation of condi-
tion-specific primary datasets

McNeil, 1982), Fig. 2] with transcriptional regulation showing the
largest performance boost in precision over background (over
2—fold) at low recall. Background priors are derived from current
knowledge base resources (further detail in Section 2 and
Supplementary Information) and provide a baseline performance ex—
pected by a random classifier. Our tissue—aware learning method
also outperforms a meta—correlation approach, which calculates the
average gene pairwise Pearson correlation over the expression data—
sets (1564 GEO datasets) shown in sky—blue (Fig. 2). We also ob—
serve that the performance gain when applying tissue—aware
integration is consistent among the subset of tissue—specific inter—
action examples (i.e. excluding ubiquitously expressed gene pair ex—
amples for evaluation) for all four interactions types (Supplementary
Fig.re S3). In addition, our tissue—aware learning method outper—
forms a random bagging-like (Breiman, 1996) approach (i.e. ran—
dom assignment of tissue profile to gene with number of bags equal
to the number of tissue contexts), except in co—complex, which
showed comparable performance gains probably due to the signifi-
cant portion of ubiquitously expressed gene pairs represented in the
gold standard ~84% (Supplementary Fig. S4). The largest perform-
ance gain in transcriptional regulation is consistent with our obser—
vation (Supplementary Fig. S8) that TFs are generally more tissue
specific compared with other classes of genes (e.g. kinases and
housekeeping genes). In combination, these evaluations suggest that
incorporating tissue—context can significantly improve the accuracy

actions. Our tissue-aware learning methodology (black-line) significantly im-
proves prediction accuracy com pare to simpler approaches that ignore tissue
heterogeneity (labeled tissue-unaware learning and represented as salmon-
line) and average correlation across expression datasets (skyblue)

when predicting gene/protein interactions in human, especially
when the interaction gold standard is tissue—heterogeneous.

3.2 Enhanced retrieval of cellular pathway components
The concurrent inference of human interaction networks for mul-
tiple interaction types allows the generation of specific pathway
level hypotheses. For example, often biologists are left with a set of
genes that are believed to be functionally associated in a biological
process resulting from a high—throughput assay (e.g. differential ex—
pression analysis of a multi—condition RNA—Seq experiment).
However, understanding the mechanistic connection among a set of
functionally related genes has been challenging and requires many
experiments that are often extremely time consuming. Thus, it
would be of great value if pathway—level predictions inferred from
the existing genomic data compendium can be made on any set of
genes of interest to an investigator, allowing a systematic prioritiza-
tion of hypotheses to be experimentally validated.

To address the challenge of pathway component recovery from
functionally related genes, we test our ability to prioritize the path—
way interactions with known curated human pathways. For ex—
ample, human FOXO3 is an important TF involved in cell cycle
regulation and oxidative stress response along with tumorigenesis
and the progression of multiple cancers (Myatt and Lam, 2007).
FOXO3 is known to be functionally associated with human kinase
AKT1 along with important regulatory genes such as BCL6,
GADD45a and YWHAB (Brunet et al., 2001; Fernandez de Mattos
et al., 2004; Lehtinen et al., 2006). A researcher can investigate the
biomolecular interactions among these five clinically important
genes, FOXO3, AKT1, BCL6, GADD45a and YWHAB, using our
system, which accurately prioritizes many of the interacting pairs
with the confirmed interaction type (Fig. 3A, AUC 0.82, full ranked
scores in Supplementary Table S3). In addition, such overlay

tional, post-translational and physical interactions that we accurately

proved performance in retrieval of pathway interactions when evaluated for
both all interactions types combined (‘all labels') and also for each individual
interaction type (shown in salmon color) compared with average correlation
over the expression dataset (‘all labels (Average correlation)’ in lime-green)

provides a mechanistic hypothesis of the information ﬂow among
this set of genes. Starting with kinase AKT1 activating the transcrip-
tional complex FOXO3-YWHAB through phosphorylation, next,
the activated FOXO3—YWHAB complex to regulate the expression
of targets BCL6 and GADD45A, connecting Akt1 to many down-
stream cellular processes such as DNA damage and apoptosis.

To systematically evaluate a broader set of pathways, we as—
sessed our ability to recapitulate the pathway interactions for 447
expert—curated human pathways by Pathway Interaction database
(includes all BioCarta pathways and restricted to pathways with
minimum 5 genes and 10 interactions) (Schaefer et al., 2009). For
each pathway, for the genes constituting the pathway, we assess
how accurate our network predictions are in prioritizing the gene
pairs with the correct interaction type label compared with all indir-
ect interactions and direct pairs but with incorrect interaction type
labels (cross—validated predicted networks were used for the ana—
lysis). Our median evaluation performance measures are uniformly
well above random (0.5), shown in Figure 3B, with a median AUC

of 0.69 across all pathways with comparable performance across
different interaction types. Specifically, we observe co—complex
interactions to be the top performer, with a median AUC of 0.74
[consistent with previous observations of strong genomic signal of
co—complex (Qiu and Noble, 2008)] and post—translational regula—
tion to be the most challenging to predict, with a median AUC of
0.61 (results limited to pathways with at least five gene interactions
for the corresponding interaction type, full tabulated results for each
pathway in Supplementary Table S4). Also, our results show signifi-
cant improvement (P< 0.01, Wilcoxon rank test) compared with
average gene pairwise correlation over the expression datasets.
Finally, our predictions significantly outperform predictions made
without incorporating tissue contextual information (i.e. tissue—
unaware predictions) and the more general coupling of ‘functional
association’ (Huttenhower et al., 2009), thus highlighting the im-
portance of interaction type specific integration of multiple data
sources (full interaction type performance comparison for all net-
works shown in Supplementary Fig. S5). Taken together, these
results indicate that our network interactions can generate hypothe—
ses not only about pathway structure from random gene pairs, but
can also be used to prioritize the pathway interactions among the
more challenging functionally related gene sets.

3.3 Human interaction networks help interpret primary
experimental datasets

In addition to pathway component recovery, our predicted interac—
tomes can be used to aid the discovery of regulatory targets in indi-
vidual investigator generated condition—specific datasets.

3.3.1 Recovery of transcriptional regulatory targets from ChIP-Seq
datasets

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high—throughput
sequencing (ChIP—Seq) has become a prevalent experimental assay
that is applied to TFs to measure potential regulatory binding re-
gions across the genome in in vivo settings (Park, 2009). Potential
regulatory targets for an immuno—precipitated TF are mainly identi-
fied as genes that have a TF ChIP—Seq binding profile proximal to its
TSS (Gerstein et al., 2012). However, like many biological assays,
ChIP—Seq is known to have a high rate of nonspecific cross-linking
due to the usage of formaldehyde (compared with precise UV cross—
linking that is specific to <1 angstrom proximity) that can lead to
many false positive regulatory candidate targets (Mercer and
Mattick, 2013). In addition, even when given a robust TF-binding
site, often there can be multiple TSS windows proximal to a binding
locus thus obscuring the process of identifying the true regulatory
target gene.

With our predicted transcriptional interaction network con—
structed from over 50 000 genome—scale experiments, we could dis—
criminate false positive regulatory targets identified by a ChIP—Seq
experiment either by the result of a non-specific binding or multiple
TSS windows proximal to a binding profile. Thus, our approach
allows researchers to capture a more accurate binding landscape
at the given experimental condition or tissue of the ChIP—Seq experi-
ment. To test this hypothesis, we overlay our transcriptional regula—
tory network to identify false positive regulatory targets of TFs
identified by ChIP—Seq experimental datasets generated for the
ENCODE project (total 109 TF, 609 ChIP—Seq experiments) (Landt
et al., 2012). Specifically, for each 109 TF, we identify potential
regulatory target genes that have binding—profile peaks located
within a window surrounding the gene’s TSS. Next, we filter
ChIP-Seq identified regulatory target genes that have a predicted

probability of less than prior (i.e. no experimental support) in our
transcriptional regulatory network. In other words, genes with little
experimental evidence in the human genomic data compendium of
being transcriptionally regulated by the TF are flagged as false
positives.

To evaluate the accuracy of our ability to identify false positive
regulatory targets from ChIP—Seq experiments, we test if the regula—
tory target genes identified for each TF are enriched with genes
known to be involved in biological processes associated with the TF.
We hypothesized that if false positive TF—target gene pairs are accur—
ately filtered, the enrichment of TF—involved biological processes
should improve. Indeed, the evaluation results shown in Figure 4A
demonstrate a significant increase in enrichment when filtering
based on our transcriptional regulatory network compared with the
original regulatory targets identified only from the ChIP—Seq data.

In addition, the improvement in enrichment is consistent across
varying windows i 500, 1000 and 2000 bp) surrounding TSS for
identifying regulatory target genes. Interestingly, the TSS window of
:1000 bp that have been used heuristically in a recent study

Fig. 4. Improving the interpretability of primary experimental data. Our inter-
action networks can be used to help investigators increase the interpretability
of condition-specific primary experimental data. In panel A, ChlP-Seq data-
sets generated for the ENCODE project (109 TFs) were processed to identify
TF and potential regulatory target genes. We observe a significant increase in
enrichment of TF associated GO terms among its putative regulator targets,
when removing TF-targets pairs that have low predicted probability in our TF
regulatory network (skyblue). In panel B, represents our predicted phospho-
binding motifs that are present in known TBK1 substrates not identified in the
phospho-proteomics study. Such results support the potential biological rele-
vance of these motifs and the accuracy of our phosphorylation network that
enabled the analysis

(Tiwari et al., 2012) also showed the best performance in our evalu—
ations. Just based on ChIP—Seq data, the 500 bp window is too
restrictive and the 2000 bps window is too promiscuous (i.e. larger
increase in false positive regulatory target genes versus true posi—
tives). However, our methodology permits a much larger window of
:2000 bp while improving the overall enrichment. Consequently,
this allows investigators to identify larger number of functional
regulatory targets from the same ChIP—Seq dataset.

3.3.2 Phosphorylation network identifies TBK1 targets from
phospho-proteomics data

With the recent advancement of stable isotope labeling techniques
(e.g. SILAC), quantitative mass spectrometry has allowed the moni—
toring of the global alterations of the knock—down or knock—out
phenotype of a specific gene at the proteome level (e.g. RNAi target—
ing a kinase) (Nesvizhskii et al., 2007). However, RNAi/MS studies
alone cannot distinguish direct regulatory effects from indirect
effects. For example, the collection of differentially phosphorylated
proteins after knocking—down a protein kinase will be a mix of dir-
ect substrates of the knocked—down kinase and also substrates of
other de—activated kinases. This is because often signaling pathways
consists of long kinase cascades, complicating any follow—up
analysis.

We hypothesized that our phosphorylation interaction network,
which summarizes the human data compendium, could be used to
prioritize regulatory target proteins from an investigator’s phospho—
proteomics study. To test the applicability of our proposed
approach, we applied our methodology to a recent phospho—
proteomics study (Kim et al., 2013). In this study, loss of phosphory—
lated proteins was measured using mass spectrometry following the
RNAi mediated knock-down 0f TBK1. TBK1 is an important kinase
involved in innate immune response and implicated in multiple
human cancers including lung cancer (Guo et al., 2013). Therefore,
the identification of regulatory targets of TBK1 and potential bind—
ing motifs can provide a great resource for future therapeutic
studies.

In the published study, the researchers were not able to report
any potential binding/recognition motifs of TBK1, most likely due
to the mixture of direct and indirect targets among the differentially
phosphorylated proteins. This is especially unfortunate because, al—
though in vitro peptide array studies have been conducted (Hutti
et al., 2012; Newman et al., 2013), no known in vivo binding/recog—
nition motif has been identified for kinase TBK1. In fact, when we
ran the state—of—art motif discovery tool FIRE (Elemento et al.,
2007) on the 2150 differentially phosphorylated protein sequences
(1154 unique genes), we retrieved many known binding motifs of
other kinases such as ERK1,2 and PKC beta kinase (i.e. not the
RNAi knock-down kinase TBK1, motifs shown in Supplementary
Figure S6). Interestingly, many of the kinases that recognize
the identified motifs were among the differentially phosphorylated
proteins (71%). This is consistent with the expectation that many
of the substrates of these kinases (and not TBK1) contributing a
significant portion to the collection of differentially phosphorylated
genes.

To address this challenge, we used our predicted phosphoryl—
ation network to refine the identified protein targets by restricting
differentially phosphorylated proteins to those that also had a high
probability of being regulated by TBK1 in our network. Filtering
out proteins that have little experimental evidence of being regulated
by TBK1 in the human data compendium could improve subsequent
downstream analyses. Thus, we repeated the motif discovery

analysis as conducted previously on the sequences of the 258 net—
work—refined protein targets (Supplementary Table S5). As pre—
dicted, we no longer retrieved any significant binding motifs of
other kinases, compared with our previous analysis, which resulted
in multiple known motifs of TBK1 downstream kinase targets
(motifs shown in Supplementary Fig. S7).

Due to the lack of proinflammatory stimuli in the experiment
(Kim et al., 2013), seven known phosphorylation substrates of
TBK1 were not identified to be differentially phosphorylated in this
study. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 4B, 4 motifs among the top
10 significant motifs (only identified through our integrated ap—
proach, phosphorylation network—l—FIRE) were present for these
known TBK1 substrates, which were not included in the motif dis—
covery analysis (such occurrence or more motif overlap happening
by random chance, P—value < 0.05 based on permuting the motif-
protein profile). Thus, this result supports the possibility of these
motifs being the first in vivo derived motifs identified to be biologic—
ally relevant for TBK1 recognizing its phosphorylation substrates.

4 Discussion

Genomic approaches have provided us with great opportunities in
unearthing the complexity of human biology and diseases. Although
an increasing number of human datasets measuring the molecular
changes at the expression, epigenomic and proteomic level has pro—
vided us with an invaluable public resource, the efficient integration
and identification of regulatory pathways and processes has been
challenging. In this work, by integrating ~1600 human genomic—
scale datasets, we provide the means to study human pathway—level
interactions at a whole—genome scale. For each pair of genes in the
human genome, thousands of experimental data points measuring
the behavior of these genes and its protein products were summar—
ized to infer both the presence of a functional association and the
most likely pathway interaction type. By applying our interaction
networks to experimental datasets, we were able to improve the ac—
curacy of identifying TF regulatory targets from ChIP—Seq data com—
pared with a traditional TSS—proximity method, and also identifying
novel kinase substrate recognition motifs from phospho—proteomics
data.

This study demonstrates that directly incorporating tissue con—
textual information in the data integration and inference of gene
interactions for metazoan mammalian organisms can significantly
improve prediction accuracy. Although we have implemented our
system utilizing a maximum—margin hyperplane—based SVM algo—
rithm, we anticipate that the overall approach of directly exploiting
tissue and cell—lineage heterogeneity in human datasets can be read—
ily incorporated into many future and existing methods.

Currently, source and target gene information (i.e. directionality)
of a predicted regulatory interaction can only be indirectly inferred
for gene pairs when there is only one regulator or modifying enzyme
protein corresponding to the interaction type (e.g. a predicted phos—
phorylation interaction that includes one kinase or transcriptional
regulation interaction with one TF). Future research will be required
to develop methods and incorporate new data sources to unravel the
directionality between regulator genes, such as the regulatory direc—
tionality between the N5 00 human kinases often chained together in
signaling cascades. Furthermore, we expect the explicit prediction of
tissue/cell—type specific pathway interaction networks and rewiring
to be the next challenge in unraveling human system biology. Major
effort will be required to generate a sufficient number of experimen-
tally verified tissue—specific interaction gold standards. To enable

such efforts, we have made all of our predicted whole—genome net—
works publically available at an interactive web—portal, pathway—
net.princet0n.edu, for researchers to conduct exploratory analysis
for future hypothesis generation.

The Outstanding Contributions to ISCB Award was launched in
2015 to recognize individuals who have made lasting and valuable
contributions to the Society through their leadership, service and
educational work, or a combination of these areas. Burkhard Rost is
the 2016 winner of the Outstanding Contributions to ISCB Award
and will be recognized at the 2016 Intelligent Systems for Molecular
Biology (ISMB) meeting in Orlando, Florida on July 8—12, 2016.

Rost is the Alexander von Humboldt Professor and chair of bio—
informatics and computational biology at the Technical University
Munich. His research interests focus on using machine learning and
artificial intelligence to predict the structures and functions of pro—
teins and genes.

Rost has served ISCB in numerous positions throughout his car—
eer, including being co—chair of the largest annual meeting in compu—
tational biology, Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB),
during 2007 (Vienna), 2008 (Toronto), 2011 (Vienna), 2012 (Long
Beach) and 2013 (Berlin). Rost served as ISCB president from 2007
to 2014. When he assumed the leadership position, the Society was
in financial turmoil. He recalled, ‘All I wanted to do was clean up’,
and sought out colleagues who would help steer ISCB in their right
direction through their leadership roles on the Executive Committee
(EC) and the Board of Directors, and as committee chairs. He attri—
butes the ﬂourishing of ISCB under his leadership to these colleagues
and said, ‘I have found a way to motivate the people who are pas—
sionate about what they do. I can motivate people and I found the
right people’.

Rost strove to broaden the international reach of ISCB beyond
Europe and the USA and said, ‘We wanted ISCB to have conferences
in many places, outside the realm of what we typically do. I believe
we found a way of making it sustainable’. During Rost’s term as
president, he led the effort to organize several international meetings
in Africa, Asia and Latin America. These truly international meet—
ings included ISCB Africa (2010: Bamako, Mali; 2011: Cape Town,
South Africa; 2013: Tunis, Tunisia; 2015: Dar es Salaam, Tanzania)
in cooperation with the African Society for Computational Biology
and Bioinformatics (ASBCB), ISCB Latin America (2010:
Montevideo, Uruguay; 2012: Santiago de Chile, Chile; 2014: Belo
Horizonte, Brazil), and most recently ISCB Asia (2011: Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia; 2012: Shen Zhen, China; 2013: Seoul, South
Korea). ISCB continues to organize these international meetings and

 

is developing other virtual platforms, like ISCBconnect, to help
ISCB members from around the globe connect with each other out—
side the confines of a conference.

Rost wanted to find ways for students and trainees to become
involved with ISCB in a meaningful way and helped advocate for and
support the ISCB Student Council (ISCB SC). The ISCB SC has blos—
somed since its inception in 2004, and student members organize and
manage the SC’s year round activities including scientific events, net—
working opportunities, soft—skills training, educational resources and
career advice. The ISCB SC hosts a popular annual symposium at
ISMB and has become the voice of the rising generation of computa—
tional biologists. Rost said, ‘Young people see ISCB as a society that
does something and they are more active than ever before’.

Rost was concerned about the lack of diversity in ISCB’s leader—
ship at the beginning of his term and focused on getting more
women on the EC because he believed diversity is essential for the
success of ‘how important decisions are made’. Now women hold
many leadership roles across ISCB and are being honored in growing
numbers for the scientific contributions to computational biology
through ISCB awards and recognition as ISCB Fellows.

Rost will be remembered as one of ISCB’s most devoted presi—
dents through his tireless service to connect the international compu—
tational biology community through multiple platforms and being a
strong united voice for a very broad field. He will continue to sup—
port the ISCB community as a past—president and lifetime ISCB
member.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: We have recently characterized an instance of alternative
splicing that differs from the canonical gene transcript by deletion of a
length of sequence not divisible by three, but where translation can be
rescued by an alternative start codon. This results in a predicted pro-
tein in which the amino terminus differs markedly in sequence from the
known protein product(s), as it is translated from an alternative reading
frame. Automated pipelines have annotated thousands of splice vari-
ants but have overlooked these protein isoforms, leading to them
being underrepresented in current databases.

Results: Here we describe 1849 human and 733 mouse transcripts
that can be transcribed from an alternate ATG. Of these, >80% have
not been annotated previously. Those conserved between human and
mouse genomes (and hence under likely evolutionary selection) are
identified. We provide mass spectroscopy evidence for translation of
selected transcripts. Of the described splice variants, only one has
previously been studied in detail and converted the encoded protein
from an activator of cell-function to a suppressor, demonstrating that
these splice variants can result in profound functional change. We
investigate the potential functional effects of this splicing using a var-
iety of bioinformatic tools. The 2582 variants we describe are involved
in a wide variety of biological processes, and therefore open many
new avenues of research.

1 INTRODUCTION

Alternative splicing is one of the most signiﬁcant contributors to
proteome diversity (Nilsen and Graveley, 2010). Through the
production of multiple mRNA transcripts, a single gene can
encode multiple and functionally distinct protein isoforms.
These isoforms can differ subtly, varying in only a single
amino acid, or demonstrate drastic changes in their peptide se-
quences accompanied by equally signiﬁcant changes in their
function. Automated pipelines have been developed which can
identify and annotate alternative splice events and their encoded
proteins, primarily through the alignment of Expressed Sequence
Tags (ESTs) (Bonizzoni et al., 2009; Brett et al., 2000; Eyras
et al., 2004; Hiller et al., 2004; Kan et al., 2002).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

We have previously characterized an alternative splice form of
the mouse non-SMC condensin II complex, subunit H2
(Ncaph2) gene that was incorrectly annotated by these pipelines
(Gosling et al., 2007, 2008; Theodoratos et al., 2012). The gene
can produce a transcript that lacks the last 17 bp of the ﬁrst exon.
While normally such a deletion would produce a frame-shift of
the downstream sequence, translation at an alternate start codon
rescues the reading frame of the sequence downstream from the
splice event while shifting that of the upstream sequence. The
result is a protein isoform that possesses a unique amino ter-
minus, but in which the remainder of the protein is identical to
the known isoform (Fig. 1).

An exhaustive literature search revealed only three other pro-
teins displaying similar alternative splicing; mouse Innositol
polyphosphate—4—phosphatase, type II (Inpp4b), human
Leishmanolysin-like (metallopeptidase M8 family) (LMLN)
and Otubain—l (OTUBl) (Cobbe et al., 2009; Ferron and
Vacher, 2006; Scares et al., 2004). All couple a frame-shifting
splice event with an alternate start codon to change the reading-
frame of the amino terminus, and all have been overlooked by
the genome annotation pipelines, leading us to question if the few
documented instances of this splicing are a true representation of
their prevalence.

Here we report the genome-wide identiﬁcation of new
examples of this type of alternative splicing, using publically
available EST data.

2 METHODS

2.1 Identiﬁcation of novel protein isoforms

Reference gene and EST sequences were downloaded for human and
mouse genomes from NCBI Unigene. The original search was conducted
using Unigene Builds #231 for human and #192 for mouse, based on
RefSeq Assembly 46. EST sequences were aligned to the gene reference
sequence using BLAST (v2.2.12) (Altschul et al., 1990). In cases where a
gene possesses more than one reference sequence, we chose the longest.
Alignments were conducted using gap initiation and extension penalties
of 5 and 2, respectively and an E—value threshold of 10—5. Events were
required to show an insertion or deletion of at least four nucleotides not
divisible by three in an annotated region of translation. These events also
needed to be ﬂanked by a minimum of 20 unambiguous bases of sequence
on either side and observed in at least two independent EST sequences.
Events creating exons of <20 bases or insertion events contained entirely
within annotated exons were discarded. Finally, transcripts arising from
these events that could be: translated into a peptide sequence from an
alternate start codon, with no premature stop codons, and thus possess-
ing a conserved carboxy—terminus relative to the canonical protein were

gene. (A) Partial sequence of the Ncaph2 gene showing the two start
codons (bold). (B) Schematic representation of the two splice variants
of Ncaph2. In the canonical form, the ﬁrst exon is translated from the
ﬁrst ATG. The alternate form begins translation at the second start
codon and deletes the last 17 bases of the ﬁrst exon, resulting in the
ﬁrst exon being translated in a different reading frame. The remaining
19 exons are the same between the two splice variants

selected. A summary of the full search strategy is shown in
Supplementary Figure S1.

Prevalence of alternative splicing within gene ontology biological pro-
cess functional categories was determined using DAVID gene ontology
software (Huang da et al., 2009).

2.2 Identiﬁcation of conserved alternative splicing

Genes undergoing splicing in both mouse and human were identiﬁed and
the resulting transcripts compared. If the transcripts were of a similar size
(within 60 bp of each other) they were aligned using clustalw2 (v2.1)
(Larkin et al., 2007) and the results passed to PhyloCSF (Lin et al.,
2011). The protein sequences of alignments that received a positive
score from PhyloCSF (which is indicative of conservation) were then
checked manually.

2.3 Analyzing ribosome proﬁling data

Alternate start codons predicted in this study were considered supported
by the results of Lee et al. (2012) if the Ribosome Proﬁling study identi-
ﬁed a start codon in the same Reference Sequence at the same position.
Identiﬁcation of supported start sites was facilitated by the fact that both
our studies used the same numbering method; the position of start codons
was determined relative to their position within a Reference Sequence.

2.4 Secondary structure analysis of splice junctions

A 60-bp window of sequence centered on either the 5’ - or 3’ -splice junc-
tions was identiﬁed by mapping the regions ﬂanking the splice event
(provided in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) back to the genomic se-
quence (downloaded from ENSEMBL, Human Assembly GRCh37.p12;
Mouse Assembly GRCm38.p1). The initial scan identiﬁed 97% of the
predicted splice junctions. The remaining 3% were excluded from the
analysis. An equal number of randomly chosen exons (downloaded
from ENSEMBL) were used to generate a control group of splice junc-
tions. The level of secondary structure was determined by predicting the
Mean Free Energy (MFE) of the sequence using RNAfold (Denman,
1993), a component of the ViennaRNA package (v2.1.3) with default
parameters. Differences between the groups of exons were assessed
using an un-paired t—test.

2.5 Identiﬁcation of supporting Mass Spectrometry
evidence

We adopted a combined-database approach of peptide identiﬁcation
(Elias and Gygi, 2007). Our predicted alternate-proteins were appended
to a list of all annotated human or mouse proteins downloaded from
NCBI. We also included reversed versions of all the target proteins to
act as decoys in order to calculate the False Detection Rate (FDR). Mass
spectra were obtained from Peptide Atlas (Desiere et al., 2005). We used
data from two experiments for human (PA6000116, derived from the
human erythroleukemia K562 cell line and PA6000053, derived from
human blood) and mouse (PA6000373, PA6000370, PA6000359 and
PA6000380 derived from the ctyoplasmic, microsomal, mitochondrial
and nuclear fractions respectively, of mouse whole brain extracts and
PA6000300, derived from mouse testes). Spectra were then analyzed
using X!Tandem (v2010.12.01.1) (Craig and Beavis, 2004) with the fol-
lowing parameters: parent ion mass tolerance of :l:100, monoisotopic
mass, trypsin cleavages only and no more than one skipped cleavage in
the peptide. Peptide assignments were statistically validated using
PeptideProphet (from the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline Suite v4.4.1)
(Keller et al., 2002), discounting spectra assignments below 0.05 or to
peptides <7-amino acids long. Proteins identiﬁcations and the protein
FDR were made using MAYU (Reiter et al., 2009), ignoring ambiguous
peptides. We chose a peptide-spectrum match FDR of 0.009 as our
cutoff, which corresponded to protein FDRs of 6.69% and 5.95% for
human and mouse, respectively. The complete list of alternate protein
sequences used in the MS analysis is provided in Supplementary Table S1
and S2.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Identiﬁcation of >2000 novel protein isoforms in
human and mouse

In order to identify potential frame-shifted protein isoforms, we
designed a program that downloaded each gene’s ESTs from
Unigene and then aligned them back to the reference sequence
using BLAST. Alignments were then parsed for splice events that
produced frame shifts that could be rescued through use of an
alternate start codon. An overview of the search program is given
in Supplementary Figure S1. Our program predicted 1849 alter-
native splice events in the human genome and 733 instances in
the mouse genome that result in proteins with a novel amino-
terminus derived from an alternate reading frame. The full lists
of these transcripts are provided in Supplementary Tables S1 and
S2. Examples of genes displaying the splicing are provided in
Table 1. The highest percentage of supporting ESTs recorded
was for human LGALS14 (lectin, galactoside—binding, soluble
14), in which the ‘alternative’ transcript accounts for 58% of
the total transcripts. Thus, this previously under-appreciated
form of alternative splicing can affect a large percentage of the
annotated transcripts for a given gene.

We compared our alternate protein sequences to a list of all
annotated proteins present in the NCBI and ENSEMBL/
GENCODE databases. In total 324 (18%) of the human and
44 (6%) of the mouse proteins have been previously annotated.
Thus, >80% of the alternative translations we have identiﬁed are
completely novel.

Examples of this unusual form of splicing were found in genes
involved in a diverse range of biological processes. We used
DAVID Gene Ontology software (Huang da et al., 2009) to
identify pathways enriched for this form of splicing. These

yielded enrichments in processes such as DNA replication and
repair, programmed cell death, and RNA processing and trans-
lation pathways. Additionally we found multiple members of
certain gene families displaying this splicing. Of the human
genes identiﬁed, these included the Interleukin receptors (ﬁve
members), the Eukaryotic Initiators of Translation (eight mem-
bers) and the Solute Carrier families (41 members).

3.2 Conservation of splice events between human and
mouse

Comparing the splicing events found in human and mouse iden-
tiﬁed 40 instances of conserved alternative splicing between the
two species (Table 2). The conservation of these forms implies
likely evolutionary selection. As well as the 40 genes displaying
conserved splicing, we found an additional 102 genes that, while
displaying this form of splicing in both human and mouse, did
not produce conserved proteins. The relatively low species con-
servation is consistent with recent ﬁndings showing that alterna-
tive splicing is often species-speciﬁc (Barbosa—Morais et al., 2012;
Merkin et al., 2012).

3.3 Secondary structure of splice sites

Analysis of the secondary structure surrounding the alternate
splice junctions showed that in both human and mouse, the al-
ternate 5’ junctions were predicted to possess a lower secondary
structure and the 3’ junctions a higher level of structure when
compared to a control group (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3).
Given the inﬂuence of mRNA secondary structure on alternative

splicing (Buratti and Baralle, 2004) these results may suggest a
method of regulation, although the precise mechanism remains
unclear.

3.4 Prevalence of Kozak sequences

Identiﬁcation of these splice events using ESTs provides strong
evidence for their transcription. Translation of these alternative
splice forms however, relies on the translation machinery cor-
rectly identifying the alternate start codon, a process often
mediated by the Kozak sequence (Kozak 1986, 1997). We there-
fore investigated the context in which the start codons were pre-
sented, paying attention to both the canonical and alternate start
sites. We classiﬁed the surrounding sequence as either an optimal

Kozak sequence (deﬁned as AnnATGn or GnnATGG), a sub-
optimal Kozak sequence (deﬁned as [C/T]nnATG[A/C/T]) or no
Kozak sequence (Bazykin and Kochetov, 2010; Kochetov 2008;
Volkova and Kochetov, 2010). Full results are given in
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. In human, 66% of the canon-
ical start sites were found within an optimal Kozak sequence as
opposed to 37% of the alternate sites (64% versus 37% for
mouse). For both species, the alternate start sites were distributed
evenly between optimal and sub-optimal Kozak sequences.
Interestingly, the Kozak signals of the conserved alternate start
sites appeared to be more likely to exist in an optimal Kozak
sequence (47.5% of conserved sites versus 36.9% of non-
conserved).

3.5 Proteomic evidence for the translation of the
alternative splice forms

Ultimately, translation needs to be proven experimentally. We
therefore adopted a proteomics approach, searching for evidence
of the proteins in publicly available Mass Spectrometry (MS)
data. As our proteins differ from the canonical forms only in
the amino-terminus, such an approach is difﬁcult because ﬁrst, in
order to be identiﬁed the alternate protein must produce unique
peptides of appropriate length upon tryptic digestion, and se-
cond, such a peptide (matching either fully or in part to the
altered amino terminus) must be identiﬁed in the MS experiment.
By reanalyzing raw spectra from two human and mouse experi-
ments, we found evidence supporting the translation of 19 novel
human and seven novel mouse proteins. We used stringent
search criteria corresponding to a protein false detection rate
of 6.69% for human and 5.95% for mouse (i.e. no more than
one match is likely to be a false positive).

The mouse MS data came from experiments on brain and
testes. Four of the seven splice variants were represented by an
EST derived from brain (or embryo upper head) and one by an
EST derived from mouse testicles. Thus, the tissue derivation of
the ESTs matches the provenance of the MS datasets, providing
strong support for the validity of our search strategy. Such a
correlation was not observed in human as the MS data were
derived from blood and a leukemic cell line rather than speciﬁc
tissues. The identiﬁcation of examples of alternate proteins in
these MS datasets therefore provides independent proof of con-
cept, indicating that these alternate isoforms can indeed be trans-
lated into proteins.

3.6 Evidence for the selection of alternate start codons

Ribosome proﬁling is a technique that identiﬁes mRNAs
undergoing translation within a cell, by determining what

transcripts are bound by ribosomes (Ingolia et al., 2009). In
2012, Lee et al. modiﬁed the technique to identify translation
initiation sites in both a human and mouse cell line (Lee et al.,
2012). By comparing their list of identiﬁed translation initiation
sites to our list of predicted alternate start codons, we were able
to ﬁnd evidence supporting our annotations for 35 instances in
human and three in mouse (full list provided in Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2). This provides direct evidence that the trans-
lational machinery can utilize the alternate start codon predicted
by our pipeline.

3.7 Prediction of functional effects of alternative splicing

The selective modiﬁcation of the N—terminus may allow for the
regulation or change of protein function. Given the preference
for localization signals to be found within the amino-terminus,
one possibility is that this method of splicing can regulate a pro-
tein’s subcellular localization. To assess this, we compared the
predicted localization of each of the canonical and alternate pro-
tein isoforms using the Wolf pSort program (Horton et al.,
2007). Of the mouse and human proteins >50% were predicted
to change their localization due to these alternative splicing
events (examples provided in Table 3, full results in
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).

Another key determinant in modiﬁcation of protein function
is the selective removal or addition of functional domains. In
order to investigate this possibility, we used the Pfam software
suite (v1.3) (Punta et al., 2012) to identify differences in potential
functional domains between the canonical and alternate isoforms
(full data presented in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2;
examples provided in Table 3).

One or more functional domains are predicted to be removed
upon splicing in 33% and 38% of the human and mouse genes,
respectively. In comparison, only a small number of the events
were predicted to add a functional domain (six in mouse and 19
in human). Of the genes predicted to change their functional
domains, 57% of the human proteins and 64% of the mouse
proteins are also predicted to change their subcellular localiza-
tions. By pairing these two functional effects, this method of
alternative splicing may produce protein isoforms that display
unique functions and are located in separate cellular
compartments.

4 CONCLUSION

The aim of this study was to investigate an unusual outcome of
alternative splicing that results in the amino terminal exons of a
gene being translated in two reading frames. Our pipeline

Novel human and mouse protein isoforms

 

predicted a total of 2582 instances of this splicing in the mouse
and human genomes, the majority of which have not been pre-
viously annotated.

Previous large-scale studies have treated genes as possessing a
single start codon, only considering alternate sites of translation
initiation when a splice event removes the canonical start codon.
A few studies have investigated the potential of alternate start
codons, but these have focused on either downstream, in-frame,
start codons that produce truncated versions of proteins
(Bazykin and Kochetov, 2010), or those that result in a frame
shift of the entire transcript (Chung et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2010).
Our study is the ﬁrst to investigate the prevalence of this unusual
amino-terminus frame-shifting form of alternative splicing.

Our search strategy identiﬁed three of the four published in-
stances of this alternative splicing. Upon further inspection, it
was found that Inpp4b was not detected due to low EST cover-
age. The Unigene database contained only 58 ESTs associated
with Inpp4b, none of which encode the experimentally validated
splice variant. The 2582 splice forms we have identiﬁed are there-
fore likely to be an underestimate of the true frequency of this
splicing. Low EST coverage of genes hides instances of this
splicing (as seen in Inpp4b) in addition, variants transcribed at
low levels or under restrictive conditions (such as in speciﬁc cell
subsets or under particular metabolic conditions) may not be
represented in databases.

Only one of the 2582 splice variants we have identiﬁed, otu-
bain-l, has been previously functionally characterized and was
found to have a dramatic effect on the function of the protein
(Scares et al., 2004). While the canonical form of the protein
activated T—cells, the alternate form was found to promote T-
cell anergy (turn off T-cells). The profound functional difference
found in the only one of these genes studied, coupled with our
predictions for alterations in domain composition and subcellu-
lar localization, highlights the potential importance of the novel
proteins we have identiﬁed.

In this study, we have identiﬁed >2000 novel protein isoforms
in human and mouse genomes. These result from an unusual
outcome of alternative splicing, combining frame-shifting splice
variants with alternative start codons. This largely overlooked
form of alternative splicing therefore contributes signiﬁcantly to
transcriptome diversity. In each case, the novel proteins differ
from their known isoforms by their amino terminus being trans-
lated from an alternate reading frame; the remainder of the pro-
tein is identical in both isoforms. This can result in a profound
change to protein function. The proteins we have identiﬁed are
involved in a wide range of biological processes. Research into the
biological functions of these novel proteins will therefore open
new avenues of research into almost every facet of cell biology.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The studies of chromatin 3D structure help us to under-
stand its formation and function. Techniques combining chromosome
conformation capture and next generation sequencing can capture
chromatin structure information and has been applied to several dif-
ferent species and cell lines. We built 3DGD (3D Genome Database), a
database that currently collected Hi-C data on four species, for easy
accessing and visualization of chromatin 3D structure data. With the
integration of other omics data such as genome-wide protein—DNA-
binding data, this data source would be useful for researchers inter-
ested in chromatin structure and its biological functions.

Availability and implementation: The 3DGD v1.1, data browser,
downloadable files and documentation are available at: http://3dgd.

1 INTRODUCTION

The 3D conformation of chromosome in nucleus is relevant with
several important biological processes such as gene expression,
regulation and replication (Dong et al., 2010; Handoko et al.,
2011; Liu et al., 2013). Understanding these relationships would
provide a new perspective to the studies of chromatin (Li and
Reinberg, 2011). In recent years, the development of chromatin
conformation capture techniques, such as Hi-C, allows us to
identify the chromatin interactions across the whole genome
unbiasedly (Belton et al., 2012; Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009).
The technique has been applied to several species such as human,
mouse, Drosophila and yeast (Duan et al., 2010; Lieberman-
Aiden et al., 2009; Sexton et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012).
These datasets have been shown useful in studying the property
and function of chromosome organization (Dong et al., 2010,
2013).

However, there is still a lack of an integrative data source of
these kind of data for easy accessing and visualization. Besides,
integrating additional information such as genome annotation
and protein binding information could be useful for studying

chromatin structure’s function (Botta et al., 2010; Dong et al.,
in submission; Li and Heermann, 2013). Recent studies have
shown that some important DNA-binding proteins are extremely
relevant to the chromosome organization and its function. For
example, CCCTC—binding factor (CTCF) is of importance in the
formation of chromatin structure (Botta et al., 2010; Handoko
et al., 2011). Combining DNA-binding afﬁnities of these proteins
together with Hi-C data may help us to understand the forma-
tion and the functions of the chromatin structure.

Here, we present 3D Genome Database (3DGD), a novel
database that collected published 3D structure of genome (cur-
rently mainly based on Hi-C experiment) of four different spe-
cies. We organized and displayed the interaction data in an easy
way for accessing, while integrating genome annotation data and
some important DNA-binding protein information. To our
knowledge, 3DGD is the ﬁrst database collecting and displaying
chromatin 3D structure data.

2 METHODS AND USAGE

The original Hi-C datasets are collected from four published
papers (Supplementary Table S1) (Duan et al., 2010;
Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009; Sexton et al., 2012; Zhang et al.,
2012). Previous studies pointed out the potential bias in the ori-
ginal Hi-C dataset and described four normalization methods to
reduce bias (Cournac et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2012, 2013; Imakaev
et al., 2012; Yaffe and Tanay, 2011). We applied the four nor-
malization methods to the original datasets of human, mouse
and Drosophila with default procedures and parameters. Owing
to the different experimental protocols that may introduce add-
itional circularization bias, only the SCN method was applied to
yeast data. These datasets are converted to a uniﬁed format as
follows. Chromosomes are segmented into several bins and the
bin size is the minimal resolution of the original dataset.
Interaction matrixes or other ﬁle formats in the original dataset
are then uniﬁed formatted as the interaction value between the
bins. Then, we built a browser to display interaction data be-
tween any regions of the genome. Interactions between chromo-
some regions are computed as the weighted sum of the
interaction value (raw or normalized Hi-C observed value) of
different bins in that region; the weight is the ratio between the
length of the region and the minimal bin size. Thus, the inter-
action value I of Regions R1 and R2 is deﬁned as follows:

1(R1, R2) =  Wi  WjI(R1,i, R2,j) (1)

Where i and j are the number of bins in R1 and R2 separately,
and w is the ratio between the length of ith bin overlapped with
the selected region and the dataset’s bin size.

This weighted sum approach assumes that the chromosome
interaction distributes uniformly along one bin. We use human
GM06990 dataset to test this assumption. The published datasets
contain interaction matrix of 100 kb and le. We randomly
chose 1000 regions of le, which consists of 10 lOO-kb bins,
and test whether the interaction value between this region and
the other bin is uniformly distributed along the 10 lOO-kb bins
with X2 goodness-of—ﬁt test. Only a small percentage (4.7%) of
the interactions in one bin is not uniformly distributed (P < 0.05),
indicating the method works well for most of the occasions.
For those non-uniformly distributed interaction pairs
(Supplementary Table S3), bias would be introduced if the
search region contains segment smaller than that of the minimal
bin. For each dataset, we calculated the value generated by
weighted sum approach and compared them to the value calcu-
lated by sum of lOO-kb data. The median difference is 24.2%.
To avoid this potential bias, we suggest the search region should
be set as the integer times of the bin size of each dataset, which is
listed in a table in the Browse page.

Protein binding datasets are then integrated into the browser.
The proteins we selected are annotated or reported relevant to
the chromosome structure formation or function. Data mainly
comprised CHIP-seq data downloaded from GEO or ENCODE
project (Supplementary Table S2). Besides the pre—selected pro-
teins, users can also upload their own protein binding data to be
visualized in our browser. The binding intensities of the proteins
are averaged to the chromosome bins. Thus, we can display the
interaction number and the protein binding intensity at the same
time in one browser.

Data browsing and downloading can be done via 3DGD Web
site. The original and normalized Hi-C datasets can be down-
loaded from the download page. Browse page is used to visualize
Hi-C and other data. One can view the interactions between the
two chromosome regions, the query region and the target region.
Query and target regions can be input as either a chromosome
region or a gene symbol. The query region is treated as a single
part, and the interactions between the bins in the target region
and the query region itself are displayed. For example, select
Human Gm06990 from the sidebar, then select one region as a
query region by chromosome position (e. g. chr8:2000000—
5000000), then specify the target chromosome region (e. g.
chr8:1000000—6000000) and press SEARCH to show the inter-
action graph. To show protein binding information, select one
protein (e.g. CTCF) or upload a protein binding data and press
SEARCH, and the protein binding intensity in the target region
will be displayed (Fig. 1). All these data in the current selected
region will be displayed in a UCSC genome browser by clicking
‘Display in UCSC genome browser’ button.

3 CONCLUSION

The 3DGD collects Hi-C data of four species and integrates
them with other omics data such as genome-wide protein binding
information. As the studies of the chromatin structure accumu-
lated, more structure information can be added into this data
source and more reported relevant omics data can be integrated

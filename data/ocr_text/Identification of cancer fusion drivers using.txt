ABSTRACT

Summary: Gene fusions are being discovered at an increasing rate
using massively parallel sequencing technologies. Prioritization of
cancer fusion drivers for validation cannot be performed using trad-
itional single-gene based methods because fusions involve portions of
two partner genes. To address this problem, we propose a novel net-
work analysis method called fusion centrality that is specifically tai-
lored for prioritizing gene fusions. We first propose a domain-based
fusion model built on the theory of exon/domain shuffling. The model
leads to a hypothesis that a fusion is more likely to be an oncogenic
driver if its partner genes act like hubs in a network because the fusion
mutation can deregulate normal functions of many other genes and
their pathways. The hypothesis is supported by the observation that
for most known cancer fusion genes, at least one of the fusion part-
ners appears to be a hub in a network, and even for many fusions both
partners appear to be hubs. Based on this model, we construct fusion
centrality, a multi-gene-based network metric, and use it to score
fusion drivers. We show that the fusion centrality outperforms other
single gene-based methods. Specifically, the method successfully
predicts most of 38 newly discovered fusions that had validated onco-
genic importance. To our best knowledge, this is the first network-
based approach for identifying fusion drivers.

1 INTRODUCTION

A fusion gene that results from chromosome rearrangements is a
hybrid gene formed from distinct genes, either in the same
chromosome or in different chromosomes. Many recurrent
gene fusions, such as BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leuke-
mia (Rowley, 1973), EWS-FILl in Ewing’s Sarcoma (Aurias,
1984) and TMPRSS2-ERG in prostate cancer (Tomlins et al.,
2005), play important roles in cancer progression. Gene fusions
can lead to oncogenesis through one of several alternative

mechanisms: (i) a strong promoter of one gene is fused to and
hence controls the open reading frame of a second proto-onco-
gene, resulting in the deregulation of its oncogenic function;
(ii) the fused gene encodes a fusion protein that leads to new
oncogenic function; and (iii) fusion results in the truncation or
loss of function of a tumor suppressor gene. In addition, fused
transcripts (chimeric RNAs), generated by trans-splicing or read-
through events (Kannan et al., 2011) and unrelated to chromo-
somal rearrangement, may also lead to similar, if not identical,
biological consequences for cancer progression.

Chromosome banding analysis and ﬂuorescence in situ hybrid-
ization have long been used to detect fusion genes. The advent of
massively parallel sequencing greatly accelerated the rate of dis-
covery of novel fusion genes and chimeric RNAs (Kannan et al.,
2011; Palanisamy et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 2011). A number
of bioinformatics methods have recently been developed for
identifying gene fusions from sequencing data (Kim and
Salzberg 2011; McPherson et al., 2011a, b; Sboner et al., 2010).
However, recent studies indicate that the majority of these fu-
sions are likely to constitute passenger events in cancer progres-
sion (Stephens et al., 2009). Up to now, only a few identiﬁed
fusions have been shown to have oncogenic effects, in part due to
the labor-intensive nature of required validation assays. Thus, a
computational method that allows prioritization of potential
fusion drivers would greatly facilitate the discovery of important
fusions.

One well established approach to discover driver point muta-
tions is to determine whether its observed mutation rate is sig-
niﬁcantly higher than the background mutation rate (Ding et al.,
2008; Jones et al., 2008). However, this approach is not suitable
for the discovery of fusion drivers that involve two genes.
Besides, because fusions are rare, background rate for fusion
mutation would be hard to be established. Alternatively, network
analysis has been successfully used to identify rare cancer driver
genes with point mutations without estimating mutation rate
(Torkamani and Schork 2009; Wu et al., 2012). These network
methods estimate the tendency of individual mutated genes to
result in oncogenesis in molecular networks. Prioritization of
fusion genes raises a new challenge for the existing single gene-
based approaches because fusions result in hybrid genes formed
from portions of two genes. Only few attempts have so far been
made to study network properties of fusion genes. One study
(Héglund et al., 2006) constructed a fusion network based on

Identiﬁcation of cancer fusion drivers

 

all partnerships of known fusion gene pairs. In this analysis,
nodes were fusion partner genes and edges represented partner-
ships between fusion partner genes. The constructed gene fusion
network showed a scale-free topology. However, this analysis did
not address the problem of prioritizing fusion drivers. Another
study developed a computational method to nominate fusion
drivers by assessing the association of their partner genes with
the identiﬁed biological concepts (i.e. gene sets with speciﬁc bio-
logical functions) WVang et al., 2009). This method, similar to the
aforementioned single gene-based approaches, only accounted
for the impact of a single gene. A recent study Wandin et al.,
2011) proposed a multiple gene-based approach to identify
groups of proteins that are potential cancer drivers. However,
this approach is not speciﬁcally developed for identifying fusion
drivers.

To address the problem, we here propose fusion centrality
method for prioritizing fusion drivers in network context. We
ﬁrst test whether gene fusions are associated with exon/domain
shufﬂing by enrichment analysis of protein domain co-occur-
rence and protein domain—domain interactions between protein
domains of known cancer fusion partner genes. We then pro-
posed a domain-based fusion model, assuming that the potential
impact level of a fusion in a network would be associated with all
the protein domains or biological interactions of its two partner
genes. The model leads to the hypothesis that a fusion is more
likely to be an oncogenic driver if its corresponding partner genes
are involved in extensive biological interactions (i.e. hub genes in
a network). We then test this hypothesis using a network cen-
trality analysis on known cancer fusion partner genes, and then
led to the development of fusion centrality, a multiple gene-based
network metric, to prioritize driver fusion genes from passengers.
We evaluated the performance of the fusion centrality model by
a comparison with other single gene-based methods. Finally, we
applied the fusion centrality approach to 38 newly discovered
cancer fusions.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources

A total of 289 known fusion gene pairs and 109 genes with point muta-
tions that have been proven to be causally linked to oncogenesis were
downloaded from the Cancer Gene Census database (Futreal et al., 2004)
for analysis. We also downloaded a curated human gene network from
Pathway Commons (Cerami et al., 2010), consisting of 11 570 genes and
>1 000 000 molecular interactions, for network centrality analysis of these
fusion partner genes and point mutation genes.

Two types of protein domain data in humans are used for the analysis
of domain shufﬂing in gene fusion. One is protein domain co-occurrence
relationships. The UCSC Genome Browser (Fujita et al., 2011) provides
data on Pfam domain families for protein-coding genes. Any two
domains are considered to have a co-occurrence relationship if they co-
exist in at least one protein. In all, we identiﬁed 5135 domain co-occur-
rence relationships among 4412 Pfam domains involving 12 864 genes.
The other is a set of 26219 curated domain—domain interactions among
5410 Pfam domains involving 14936 genes (Y ellaboina et al., 2011).

2.2 Fusion centrality

Centrality measures that are normally associated with one node in a
network have been used to determine hub genes in a network (Section

S1 of the Supplementary Material). These measures have been used to
identify genes related to cancer and other diseases (Barabasi et al., 2011).
However, these methods are not able to measure network centrality of a
fusion. In this study, we hypothesized that the importance of a fusion in a
network would be associated with all biological interactions of its partner
genes (Section 3.2). Based on this hypothesis, we quantify the importance
of a fusion based on the new concept of fusion centrality. A new node in a
network, representing fusion between two existing nodes (i.e. the two
partner genes in a fusion), inherits all the linkages of the two nodes
when it is ﬁrst created, but those replicated linkages with other nodes
are ignored. We then postulate that the centrality of the new node rep-
resents the importance of a fusion between two nodes in a network. Thus,
it is intuitive to consider the deﬁnition of degree centrality of a fusion in
terms of total linkages (by ignoring those replicated linkages with other
nodes) of its two partner nodes in a network. More precisely, the fusion
degree centrality of a fusion i (FCDi) between partner genes p and q in a
binary network is deﬁned as:

n
FCD, = Zmax(ap,j, a“) (1)

j=1
where n is the total number of genes in the network, and am (aqj) repre-
sents the binary linkage between gene p(q) and gene j in a binary network.
In a weighted network (e. g. the constructed gene network in
Section 3.3), where the linkages among nodes have weights assigned to
them, similarly, we deﬁne the fusion centrality of a fusion i (F CWi) be-
tween genes ]; and q in terms of the total weight of the connections of gene

1) and q:

1 n
 = E gmaﬁwpd, qu') 
where pr- (wqj) represent the weighted linkage between fusion partner
gene 1) (q) and gene j in a weighted network.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Domain-based fusion model

Based on exon shufﬂing theory (Gilbert, 1978), rearrangement of
exons would result in novel genes that encode different proteins
with different functional domains. Several studies have provided
supporting evidence of a strong correlation between protein do-
mains and exon organization (Kaessmann, 2002; Liu and
Grigoriev, 2004). We hypothesized that fusion mutations in
cancer are associated with exon and domain shufﬂing. Because
most biological processes are ultimately executed by proteins, we
focused on domain shufﬂing for in-frame cancer fusion. To test
our hypothesis, we analyzed the enrichment of protein domain
co-occurrence relationships and domain—domain interactions
between 289 known cancer fusion gene pairs (Section 2.1).

Any two domains are considered to have a co-occurrence
relationship if they co-constitute at least one protein. These re-
lationships can represent complex domain combinations in the
human proteome. A set of 5135 known protein domain co-oc-
currence relationships from the protein domains of 12 864 genes
(Section 2.1) was used for the analysis. We found that 32.21% of
the 289 cancer fusion gene pairs had known co-occurrence rela-
tionships between their domains. In contrast, only 6.66% of all
the pairs from the 12864 genes (the background ratio) were
found to have co-occurrence relationships between their do-
mains. Thus, a highly signiﬁcant over-representation of domain
co-occurrence was observed among the protein domains of the

known cancer fusion partner genes. This ﬁnding implies that
cancer fusions preferentially involve genes whose protein do-
mains constitute functional proteins.

Several systematic studies have reported the effect of protein
domain—domain interactions on protein folding kinetics and sta-
bility (Bhaskara and Srinivasan, 2011; Itoh and Sasai, 2008;
Osvath et al., 2005). Thus, domain—domain interactions among
fusion partner genes may play roles in the synthesis of new fusion
proteins. To explore this possibility, we used a set of 5410
curated domain—domain interactions from the protein domains
of 14 936 genes (Section 2.1) to investigate whether there was
enrichment of domain—domain interactions between the partner
genes of the 289 cancer fusions. We found that 48.60% of the 289
cancer fusion gene pairs had such interactions, whereas only
13.33% of all the pairs among the 14 936 genes (the background
ratio) did so. This indicates highly signiﬁcant over-representation
of domain—domain interactions among the protein domains of
the known cancer fusion partner genes. From this, we conclude
that fusions preferentially involve genes whose protein domains
interact with each other.

Our results above implied that in-frame cancer fusions would
result in protein domain shufﬂing. Several recent studies also
support this view. Two studies have modeled domain rearrange-
ment from the point of view in evolution, concluding that gene
fusion is a major mechanism of multi-domain protein formation
in bacteria (Pasek et al., 2006) and animals (Buljan et al., 2010).
In addition, a very recent work analyzed 7424 chimeric RNAs
from human tissues and found that these chimeras contain com-
plete protein domains from their original genes signiﬁcantly
more than in random datasets (Frenkel-Morgenstern and
Valencia, 2012). Accordingly, we proposed a domain-based
fusion model (Fig. 1). Proteins A and B contains 11 and q do-
mains, respectively, and denoted A1~An and B1~Bq. The do-
mains Am+1 ~ An and Bp+1 ~ Bq, which do not appear in the new
fusion protein, were considered deletions, while the remaining
domains A1~AIn and B1~Bp that constituted the new fusion
protein, were considered insertions for each other. Thus, the per-
turbation impact of a fusion mutation between two genes in a
network would be associated with all of their protein domains.
Also, domains have been considered as basic functional units for
biological interactions. We thus further reasoned that the poten-
tial impact of a fusion mutation in a biological network would be
associated with all biological interactions of its two partner
genes. Therefore, a fusion is more likely to be an oncogenic
driver if its two partner genes act like hubs in a network because
the fusion mutation can deregulate normal functions of many

be tested in Section 3.2.

3.2 Centrality analysis of fusion partner genes

To test whether a fusion is more likely to be an oncogenic driver
if its two partner genes act like hubs in a network, we performed
centrality analysis for the 289 known cancer fusion gene pairs
in a curated gene network (Section 2.1). In the analysis, we
used two single-gene based network centrality metrics, total
degree and betweenness centrality (Supplementary Material
Section S1).

We ﬁrst compared the centrality distribution of all the cancer
fusion partner genes with those of the 109 point mutation genes
and all other genes in the curated gene network. The centrality
analysis (Fig. 2), showed us that fusion partner genes and point
mutation genes both tended to have much higher total degree
centrality (P: 1.44e-022 and P: 1.82e—025, respectively, by the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and higher betweenness centrality
(P:2.21e-015 and P:3.58e-019, respectively) than all other
genes in the network. We also observed the same result in the
centrality analysis of a protein network (Supplementary Fig. S1).
These results conﬁrmed that cancer genes tend to be hubs in
biological networks, as suggested in previous studies (Barabasi
et al., 2011; Cui et al., 2007).

However, we also found that point mutation genes had both a
higher total degree centrality (P: 1.83e—004) and betweenness
centrality (P: 1.59e—005) than fusion partner genes in the
curated gene network (the same result was also observed in
the curated protein network). We reasoned that this was due
to the fact that in some fusion genes, only one of their partner
genes serves as a hub gene. To test this, we compared the cen-
trality of the two partner genes in a fusion separately. We sepa-
rated the partner genes of the 289 cancer fusions into two groups,
according to their total degree centrality in the network. A gene
with higher total degree centrality than its fusion partner was
included in the Fusion Genels group, whereas its fusion partner
was included in the Fusion Gene2s group. The results of central-
ity analysis in the curated gene network are shown in Figure 3.
The Fusion Genels group tended to have higher total degree
centrality (P: 0.0056) and higher betweenness centrality
(P: 0.0356) than the point mutation genes in the network.
The Fusion Gene2s group tended to have a much smaller total
degree centrality (P: 2.48e—013) and betweenness centrality
(P: 1.66e-011) than the point mutation genes in the curated
gene network. The same result was also observed in the curated

protein network (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results suggest
that a fusion mutation may play an important role in onco-
genesis if at least one of its two partner genes is a hub gene in
a biological network. For example, a fusion is generated by a
proto-oncogene and the promoter of another gene. The pro-
moter gene may not hold high centrality, but it can activate
the proto-oncogene to play an important role in cancer
progression.

We further evaluated the 2D centrality distribution of the 289
fusion gene pairs using contour plots, on which the x— and y-axes,
respectively, represented the centrality values of the Fusion
Genels and Fusion Gene2s groups. Because the centrality distri-
bution of nodes in biological networks follows the power law
(Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004), the density contour matrix of the
centrality values was generated in log—log scale. The centrality
distribution of a set of 1000 000 randomly selected gene pairs,
separated into two groups based on total degree centrality, was
used to represent the background distribution. The distributions
of total degree and betweenness centrality, presented in Figure 4,
clearly show that cancer fusion partner genes had a signiﬁcantly
different centrality distribution than that of the set of randomly
selected gene pairs. Again, in most of the cancer fusion gene
pairs, we found that at least one partner gene was a hub, and
that many cancer fusions even originated from two hub genes.
We also found the same result in the curated protein network
(Supplementary Figs S3 and S4).

These results support our hypothesis that a fusion is more
likely to be an oncogenic driver if its two fusion partner genes
are more central in a network. Several previous studies
(Palanisamy et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 2011; Wang et al.,
2009) selected fusion driver candidates solely based on the criter-
ion that one of their two partner genes is cancer-associated.
Because most of cancer genes act like hub genes, the results pre-
sented above are consistent with their methods. However, these
single-gene based methods may have missed some fusion drivers,
as we will explain in Section 3.3.

3.3 Performance comparison of fusion centrality with
other methods

Based on our proposed hypothesis and the observations
aforementioned, we propose a fusion centrality metric to quan-
tify the relative importance of a fusion in a biological network (as
described in Section 2.2). Equation (1) can be used to estimate
the relative importance of fusions and identify fusion drivers in a

binary network, such as the curated gene networks used in the
section 3.2. Because of the limited coverage of the curated gene
network, which is only composed of ~25% of the genes in the
genome, we were not able to evaluate the importance of many
fusions using it. Therefore, we mapped partner genes of fusions
to a predicted gene network that was constructed by integrating
17 heterogeneous genomic and proteornic datasets WVu et al.,
2010) for the primary purpose of calculating fusion centrality.
The nodes in the constructed network represented all genes of the
human genome, and the functional association between any pair
of them was weighted by a linkage probability that can reveal the
tendency of genes to operate in the same or related pathway.
This network not only contained direct molecular interaction
information but also broader gene-gene functional relationships
within pathways. Thus, the constructed network provided more
coverage for prediction. Because the constructed gene network is
a weighted network, we applied Equation (2) to quantify central-
ity of fusion mutations.

Next, we compared the performance of the proposed fusion
centrality with other single gene-based methods using receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves. As a positive benchmark
set, we used the 289 partner gene pairs of known cancer fusions,
and as a negative benchmark, we used a set composed of
1 000 000 randomly selected human gene pairs. In the ﬁrst
method, denoted M1, the proposed fusion centrality is applied
to quantify importance of potential fusions generated by these
benchmark gene pairs in the constructed gene network. The
second method, denoted M2, is used to mimic the situation of
those previous studies (Palanisamy et al., 2010; Robinson et al.,
2011) that typically selected fusion drivers, based solely on the
criterion that one of the two partner genes was a cancer-asso-
ciated gene (i.e. most of cancer genes act like hub genes). We
calculated the single gene-based degree centrality (Barrat et al.,
2004) for each partner gene in a benchmark gene pair and used
the maximum value of their centrality to represent the import-
ance of a potential fusion generated by the benchmark gene pair.

We also applied the ConSig method WVang et al., 2009), yet
another single-gene based network method, denoted M3.
ConSig score was calculated for each gene by considering its
association with the identiﬁed biologically important concepts.
A fusion is nominated as a driver if one of its partner genes has a
high ConSig score. Therefore, in this method, we used the max-
imum value from the ConSig scores of a benchmark gene pair to
represent the importance of a fusion generated by the pair.
ConSig scores of all human genes were downloaded from
(http://consig.cagenome.org/).

The ROC curves and area under curve values for all methods
are shown in Figure 5. A higher area under curve value in a
method meant that fusions generated by the positive gene pairs
tended to have higher fusion centrality than those generated by
the negative gene pairs. These results indicate that Ml outper-
formed the other two methods. As comparing M1 and M2, it
seems that M2 has a comparable performance as M1. This indi-
cates single gene-based method can provide moderately good
prediction owing to the fact that at least one of partner genes
of cancer fusion is a hub gene. However, a high true-positive rate
is preferred to the ﬁxed lower false-positive rate in a screening. In
the partial ROC area with high true-positive rate and low FDR,
we found that Ml signiﬁcantly outperformed M2. Nevertheless,
this result further conﬁrms our hypothesis that the importance of
a fusion in a network should be evaluated by considering both of
its partner genes. Moreover, M2 performed better than M3. Both
M2 and M3 are single-gene based models but were generated
using data of the constructed gene network and ConSig scores,
respectively. This implies that the constructed network WV u
et al., 2010) contained more critical pathway information than
the concept signature method WVang et al., 2009).

3.4 Application of newly discovered fusion drivers

To further evaluate the performance of our fusion centrality
method, we applied Equation (2) to newly discovered fusions.
We selected 38 such fusions, 33 of which had validated oncoge-
netic importance and ﬁve of which were highly recurrent in
cancer samples. To identify potential fusion drivers, we first set
a threshold value on fusion centrality using the set of 1000000
randomly selected gene pairs as a control. We found that the

fusion centralities of the top 7% of these 1000000 pairs were
>0.370, whereas the fusion centralities of 73% of the 289 known
cancer fusions were >0.370 (Table 1). We therefore set the
threshold value to 0.370 for identifying potential fusion drivers
in the proposed fusion centrality method. Table 2 only lists the
fusion centrality values of 10 of these 38 new fusions (the full
information of the 38 fusions is shown in Supplementary Table
S1). Of these, 34 fusions had a weighed fusion centrality value
larger than or very closer to the threshold value. In all, 29 of
these 34 fusions have been conﬁrmed to have oncogenic import-
ance experimentally. The other four of these new fusions,
JAZF 1-SUZ12, CRTCl-MAMLl, R3HDM2—NFE2 and
ALG5-PIGU, had fusion centrality values that were much smal-
ler than the threshold value. Among them, JAZF 1-SUZl2 and
CRTCl-MAMLl have been associated with lower grade cancer
subtypes (Lee et al., 2012). We thus suspect that R3HDM2-
NF E2 and ALG5-PIGU may also be associated with lower
grade cancer subtypes. These results indicate the ability of the
proposed fusion centrality method to identify fusion drivers.
Notably, our fusion centrality approach also predicted several
fusions with partner genes whose biological roles in oncogenesis
are not well-known. For example, little is known about biolo-
gical roles of microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase

Identiﬁcation of cancer fusion drivers

 

identiﬁed all MAST fusions as driver fusions (i.e. all MAST fu-
sions with >0.38 fusion centralities). Another is the fusion of
vesicle-associated membrane protein WAPB) with IKZF 3
(IKAROS family zinc ﬁnger 3) in breast cancer, whose fusion
centrality in our analysis was 0.376. RNA interference-mediated
knock-down of the VAPB-IKZF 3 fusion gene revealed its im-
portance to the growth and survival of breast cancer cells
(Edgren et al., 2011).

In addition, Lee et al. (2012) identiﬁed fusions between l4-3-38
WWHAE) and either of two nearly identical FAM22 family
members (FAM22A and FAM22B) in endometrial stromal sar-
coma. In contrast to classic endometrial stromal sarcoma that
harbors JAZF 1-SUZl2 genetic fusions, tumor cells with
YWHAE—FAM22 fusions displayed high-grade histologic fea-
tures, including larger and more irregular nuclei, increased mi-
totic activity, a distinct gene-expression proﬁle, and a more
aggressive clinical course (Lee et al., 2012). Interestingly, fusions
YWHAE—FAM22A and YWHAE—FAM22B have fusion cen-
tralities of 0.375 and 0.368, respectively, in our predictions,
whereas JAZF l—SUZl2 has a much lower fusion centrality,
0.353. This result suggests that our approach can predict the
relative importance of fusion mutations well.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work, we have proposed the concept of fusion degree
centrality, which measures the local impact of a fusion gene
through its direct connections in a network. The fusion degree
centrality, however, is somewhat biased toward those genes that
were studied more in literature. Therefore, false negatives could
be an issue because some of the genes important for cancer pro-
gression may not be predicted by the method because little is
known about their function, and there is little connectivity be-
tween these genes and others in the network. For example, some
bottleneck hub genes OK u et al., 2007) with only a few direct
connections to other nodes, but that act as key connectors in
the network. This problem can be addressed by developing of
other kinds of fusion centrality metrics that are able to measure
the global network impact of a fusion, such as fusion between-
ness centrality or fusion eigenvector centrality, using the same
concept we proposed here. For example, after creating a fused
node of two nodes, the fusion betweenness centrality of a poten-
tial fusion generated by these two nodes in a network is repre-
sented by the betweenness centrality of the fused node, which can
be calculated using several existing algorithms. However, in these
algorithms, the calculations of the shortest paths between all
pairs of nodes in a network are time consuming and have to
occur once for each fused node when applying the algorithms
to multiple fusions because a fusion between two nodes in a
network may shorten paths between other node pairs.
Therefore, faster algorithms are needed to efﬁciently calculate
these fusion centrality measurements for a large number of
fusions detected in next-generation sequencing.

The locations of the fusion or breakpoints and the assessment
of the directionality to the gene components allowed us to cat-
egorize different types of fusions, such as in-frame fusions and
out-of-frame fusions. Although the proposed domain-based
fusion model was developed based on in-frame fusions, the
proposed fusion centrality method can also be applied to

out-of-frame fusions because an out-of-frame fusion mutation
can be considered the deletion of its two partner genes. More
speciﬁcally, if the reading frame is not retained across the fusion
junction, it will likely lead to the production of a premature stop
codon and degradation of the transcript. An out-of-frame fusion
can silence one allele of its two partner genes and be associated
with haploinsufﬁciency or loss of heterozygosity. Therefore, the
potential impact of an out-of-frame fusion in a network would
also be associated with all biological interactions of its two part-
ner genes if the other alleles of the partner genes are lost as well.

A number of studies have identiﬁed that different fusion mu-
tations can be generated when the partner genes are identical but
the breakpoints different (Baxter et al., 2002; Hernandez et al.,
2002; Robinson et al., 2011). For example, genomic analysis of
three TFG-ALK rearrangements in anaplastic large cell lymph-
omas revealed that the TF G breakpoints occurred at introns 3, 4
and 5, respectively, whereas the ALK breakpoints always
occurred in the same intron (Hernandez et al., 2002). Based on
our proposed approach, we suggest that all three fusions would
have the same level of potential impact in a network, no matter
where their breakpoints are located. Interestingly, the study of
Hernandez et al. (2002) revealed that TF G may use a variety of
intronic breakpoints in ALK rearrangements, generating fusion
proteins with different molecular weights but similar transform-
ing potential. This ﬁnding seems to support our view. However,
we need to emphasize that our fusion centrality method is used to
roughly estimate the tendency of a fusion mutation to be an
oncogenic driver in a network, not to estimate its real impact
on cellular function.

A critical issue in detecting fusions from sequencing data is the
high false-detection rate. False detections may be caused by ex-
perimental artifacts, genome assembly errors or the mis-mapping
of end sequences (Bashir et al., 2008; Shah et al., 2009; Wang
et al., 2009). To date, most of the bioinformatics methods de-
veloped for fusion discovery in sequencing data use multiple
steps of false-positive ﬁltering (Kim and Salzberg, 2011;
McPherson et al., 201 la, b; Sboner et al., 2010). Although apply-
ing these ﬁlters may reduce the false-positive rate, the false-nega-
tive rate would increase, and consequently, some fusion drivers
would not be detected (McPherson et al., 2011a). Our fusion
centrality method is an alternative way to reduce the false-nega-
tive rate when detecting fusion drivers. For example, potential
fusion drivers that fail to pass ﬁlters but have high predicted
fusion centrality may be kept for further investigation.

Although the gene functional network used in this work was
constructed without accounting for tissue speciﬁcity, the results
presented in this work suggest that a single gene functional net-
work can be used to identify fusion mutation drivers in diverse
types of cancer. Several studies also successfully applied a single
gene functional network to predicted tissue-speciﬁc disease genes
and phenotypic effects of gene perturbation (Lee et al., 2008;
Torkamani and Schork, 2009; Wu et al., 2012). Besides, fusion
drivers of a speciﬁc type of cancer may also be identiﬁed by
associating their partner genes with known cancer genes or path-
ways in the cancer type. For example, by extending the concepts
in Equations (1) and (2), the importance of a fusion in a network
can be calculated as the sum of the direct functional associations
of its two partner genes with those known cancer genes or
pathways.

We also applied the centrality analysis to over 1000 cancer
chimeric transcripts and fusion genes collected in ChiTaRS data-
base (Frenkel-Morgenstern et al., 2013), and conclude the same
result as that of using the original 289 fusion gene pairs set
(Supplementary Material Section S4). Besides, we also used
thirty-two highly recurrent chimeric RNAs that were detected
in 20 human prostate cancer samples and 10 matched benign
prostate tissues (Kannan et al., 2011) to validate the performance
of our fusion centrality approach. Many of these chimerics RNA
also appeared in matched benign tissues owing to a ‘ﬁeld effect’
within the histologically normal epithelium. They non-paramet-
ric Kolmogorov—Smirnov test was used to determine which chi-
meric RNAs are signiﬁcantly enriched in cancer tissues. We
hypothesized that some of enriched chimeric RNAs would be
fusion drivers and thus have high fusion centrality in our predic-
tion. Indeed, we found most of chimeric RNAs that are signiﬁ-
cantly enriched in human prostate cancer (P< 0.05) tended to
have higher fusion centrality than those insigniﬁcantly enriched
chimeric RNAs. These results are detailed in the Section S5 of
the Supplementary Material.

Finally, it is important to note that the fusion centrality
method was constructed based on the available data of biological
networks that are far from complete. Genes that have not been
characterized to date but may be important in cancer progression
will not be identiﬁed by our fusion centrality approach because
little of their functions are known. This limitation applies to all
network-based approaches (Barabasi et al., 2011), but our
method will be improved overtime, as more data are generated
and are integrated to construct a more complete gene network in
the future. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the method of
fusion centrality is an efﬁcient method for identifying novel
fusion drivers.

5 CONCLUSION

In summary, all results in this work indicate that the fusion cen-
trality method is a systematic and effective method for prioritiz-
ing fusion drivers from hundreds or thousands of fusion
candidates identiﬁed in diverse cancer types. To our best know-
ledge, this is the ﬁrst network-based approaches to nominate
fusion drivers.

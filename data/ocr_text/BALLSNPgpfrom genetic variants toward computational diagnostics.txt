Abstract

Summary: In medical research, it is crucial to understand the functional consequences of genetic
alterations, for example, non—synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs). NsSNVs are known
to be causative for several human diseases. However, the genetic basis of complex disorders such
as diabetes or cancer comprises multiple factors. Methods to analyze putative synergetic effects of
multiple such factors, however, are limited. Here, we concentrate on nsSNVs and present BALL—
SNng, a tool for structural and functional characterization of nsSNVs, which is aimed to improve
pathogenicity assessment in computational diagnostics. Based on annotated SNV data,
BALL—SNng creates a three—dimensional visualization of the encoded protein, collects available in—
formation from different resources concerning disease relevance and other functional annotations,
performs cluster analysis, predicts putative binding pockets and provides data on known inter—
action sites.

Availability and implementation: BALL—SNng is based on the comprehensive C++framework
Biochemical Algorithms Library (BALL) and its visualization front—end BALLView. Our tool is avail—
able at \MNw.ccb.uni—saarland.de/BALL—SNng.

1 Introduction

 

Non—synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) play a crucial
role for understanding the genetic basis of many diseases, including
diabetes and cancer. Over 85% of known nsSNVs are cur—
rently associated with a specific disease. While the advent of neXt—
generation sequencing (NGS) increases the amount of identified
nsSNVs, the experimental analysis of their pathogenic inﬂuence is
laborious and time—consuming (Thusberg et 61]., 2011).
Consequently, several approaches to predict the functional impact
of nsSNVs in silico have been developed. In a previous study, we

evaluated the prediction concordance and congruency of 13 state—
of—the—art pathogenicity prediction tools (Mueller et 61]., 2015a). To
this end, we were able to address fundamental problems of current
methods centering at the ‘one SNV, one phenotype’ paradigm. A
human individual inherits several nsSNVs simultaneously. These
nsSNV sets may exhibit synergistic effects and, thus, contribute to
pathogenic phenotypes. Besides browser—based tools such as MuPIT
Interactive (Niknafs et 61]., 2013) providing three—dimensional (3D)
visualizations, computational methods to assess the impact of
nsSNV sets on a protein are missing.

BALL-SNng

In the first approach to analyze nsSNV sets, we developed the
proof of concept tool BALL—SNP (Mueller et 61]., 2015b) that visual—
izes mutated residues within 3D protein structures and provides
available database annotations on clinical significance and disease
association for them. Here we present BALL—SNng, which expands
our previous tool to improve the assessment of pathogenic relevance
in clinical diagnostics, especially when no 3D structural information
is available. Based on NGS output that relies on the Variant Call
Format and includes gene—based annotation, BALL—SNng searches
for a 3D structure or a homologous 3D model and pathogenicity in—
formation in available databases, predicts pathogenicity, protein sta—
bility changes and active sites, performs cluster analyses on mutated
residues and assigns protein interaction sites as annotated in PiSITE
(Higurashi et 61]., 2009) on the residue level.

2 Features and methods

BALL—SNng allows two inputs: a standard SNV—annotation format
from ANNOVAR (Wang et 61]., 2010) and a simple tab—separated
file including gene—based annotation (examples on the Web site).
Based on the gene identifier, BALL—SNng searches for all available
3D structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). If no PDB structure is
available, we search for available 3D models in ModBase (Pieper
et 61]., 2004). Given a 3D structure, BALL—SNng visualizes the
encoded protein with the amino acid substitutions introduced by the
given nsSNVs and extracts available information on pathogenicity
from the UniProtKB, dbSNP and ClinVar. In addition, DrugBank
and PiSITE are queried for information whether the protein in ques—
tion is a known drug target and whether it contains already detected
interaction sites, respectively. To study putative cumulative effects,
BALL-SNng furthermore performs a hierarchical bottom—up clus—
ter analysis on the amino acid residues affected by the nsSNV. The
proximity to protein active sites may also provide crucial insights
into pathogenic effects. If the active site is not known, BALL-SNng
predicts it using the Putative Active Sites with Spheres method
(Caetano Traina, 2000). Figure 1 illustrates the overall BALL-
SNng workﬂow, which is automatically processed given an input
file.

All generated information is visualized in the molecular 3D view,
where particular properties additionally can be highlighted. An
HTML—based information page provides an intuitive instrument for
interaction with the data collected from different sources to enable
systematic analysis of the results.

2.1 Implementation details

BALL—SNng is based on the proof—of—concept implementation of
BALL-SNP, which is built on the comprehensive C +—I— framework
Biochemical Algorithms Library (BALL) and its visualization front-
end BALLView (Hildebrandt et 61]., 2010). Because BALL—SNng
highly relies on 3D information, it allows the use of both, available
3D structures and homologous 3D models. A valid 3D model from
ModBase is restricted to a minimum sequence identity of 60% and
comprises at least one of the provided amino acid substitutions.
However, the result of BALL—SNng depends on the quality of the
available 3D model. The pathogenicity prediction is performed by
the state—of—the—art methods PolyPhen2, PhD-SNP, PANTHER and
PROVEAN. I—Mutant2.0 is applied to predict protein stability
changes introduced by amino acid substitutions. The 3D model
search and the predictions by third—party tools are performed via a
constructed compute server to ensure straight—forward maintenance
and simple installation of BALL—SNng. The used databases are

3 Conclusion

In this work, we present BALL—SNng, a software tool to analyze
and identify nsSNV candidates for computational diagnostics. It is
based on a standard molecular modeling framework, allows the use
of standard NGS output, embeds fundamental nsSNV information
and performs various analyses of the 3D structure of the mutated
protein to gain insights into putative cumulative effects of nsSNVs.
The well—defined user interface and the clear presentation of the gen—
erated information are appealing to non—expert users, as well as bio—
informatics professionals. In the future, BALL—SNng will be
extended to include the possibility to analyze binding of the affected
protein to its interaction partners and small molecules to facilitate
drug design studies.

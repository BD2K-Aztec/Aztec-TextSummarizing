Abstract

Motivation: The sequences among subgenomes in a polyploid species have high similarity, mak-
ing it difficult to design genome-specific primers for sequence analysis.

Results: We present GSP, a web-based platform to design genome-specific primers that distin-
guish subgenome sequences in a polyploid genome. GSP uses BLAST to extract homeologous se-
quences of the subgenomes in existing databases, performs a multiple sequence alignment, and
design primers based on sequence variants in the alignment. An interactive primers diagram, a se-
quence alignment viewer and a virtual electrophoresis are displayed as parts of the primer design
result. GSP also designs specific primers from multiple sequences uploaded by users.

Availability and implementation: GSP is a user-friendly and efficient web platform freely access-
ible at http://probes.pw.usda.gov/GSP. Source code and command-line application are available at

 

https://github.com/bioinfogenome/GSP.

1 Introduction

Developing genome-specific primers for polyploids not only will
facilitate the study of sequence diversity and the association map-
ping of genes, but also the development of gene-based functional
markers (Huang and Brule-Babel, 2010). However, the polyploid
genome contains two or more homeologous subgenomes with high
sequence similarities, especially in the coding regions, which pre-
sents a particular problem with respect to the design genome-
specific primers that amplify individual genes. To our knowledge,
only one pipeline named PolyMarker can generate genome-specific
primers (Ramirez-Gonzalez et al., 2015). However, PlolyMarker
was specifically developed for SNP assay with the KASPTM
(Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR) system, a very unique system
using a three primers system in PCR reactions. PolyMarker

requires users to prepare sequence files with SNP information and
the target chromosome input. Therefore, the software has limited
utility in a variety of other PCR-based applications. Ma et al.
described a method for detecting locus-specific polymorphism in
hexaploid wheat (Ma et al., 2015). In this method, users are
required to do step-wise processes using provided multiple perl
scripts for blast search, extracting homeologous sequences, local
alignment among the retrieved sequences to identify polymorphism
sites. However, users still need to manually design primers based
on the alignment. Currently, no good web-based tool is available
that allows the user to design genome-specific primers by only
inputting a query sequence. Here, we present a web-based, user-
friendly primer design tool named GSP, which employs a BLAST
search and multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to identify

sequence variant sites among the homeologous sequences retrieved
and then designs specific primers.

2 Methods

Our genome-specific primer design server consists of steps
(Supplemental Fig. 51A) including:

2.1 Blast based searches against a polyploid genome
The increasing availability of genome sequence data from polyploid
species now makes it possible to conduct homeologous sequence
comparative analyses between subgenomes in polyploids. Bread
wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a well-known, hexaploid, polyploid
species, with genome size estimated at ~17 Gbp and composed of
three closely related and independently maintained genomes
(International Wheat Genome Sequencing, 2014). In the current ver-
sion of GSP, users can select genome sequence databases from three
polyploid species (bread wheat, upland cotton and switchgrass) to
design genome-specific primers. Because genome sequences for poly-
ploid species are expected to be increased and improved, we will up-
date the GSP dataset semiannually. In GSP, homeologous sequences
in the subgenomes are extracted by BLAST using query sequences.
The coordinates of homeologous sequence in the genome was
retrieved by BLAST hits using the method described by Ma et al.
(2015)

2.2 Aligning and identifying variant sites between
homeologous sequences

GSP uses the MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) program to align homeolo-
gous sequences extracted from polyploid genomes. Sequence vari-
ations, such as nucleotide polymophisms, insertions and deletions,
are identified in the MSA. The position of sequence variations
among sequences are defined as variant sites. All variant sites in the
alignment can be accounted for in designing specific primers. Users
can set the number of variant sites in the primer or only extract pri-
mers that contain the variant site in the 3’ end.

2.3 Analyzing primers

The primers in each sequence are generated by the Primer3 core pro-
gram (Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000). GSP uses primers and variant
sites information to design specific primers and sort the primers
based on two criteria: the number of variant sites and their location
in the primer sequence. In general, the higher number of variant sites
and their location in the 3’ region will give a high weight in ordering
primers. Users can view the ordered primers, indexed in numerical
order on the primer results page.

2.4 Designing specific primers based on multiple
sequence alignment

GSP not only allows users to BLAST the existing polyploid genome
sequences to design genome-specific primers, but also allows the in-
put of multiple sequences to generate MSA and design specific pri-
mers that can distinguish individual sequences. This function
provides a user-friendly way to design specific primers from various
taxa, gene families and other closely related sequences.

3 Results

The GSP web platform provides a user-friendly graphical view that
displays primer design output. The main results of the GSP analysis
are: MSA of the homeologous sequences (Supplemental Fig. SlB-1), a
distribution of primers and products (Supplemental Fig. SlB-2), a de-
tail of the primers information (Supplemental Fig. SlB-3) and a pri-
mer-pair pool panel that contains the selected primer pairs
(Supplemental Fig. SlB-4). GSP provides an interactive view for se-
lecting and analyzing primers. Users can easily find their primers of
interest, obtain the sequence products and generate a virtual electro-
phoresis gel. GSP also allows users to manually select a specific region
of a sequence in the alignment to verify its use as a good primer. In
addition, GSP can check the specificity of primers input by users.

We designed 53 primer pairs for group 2 homoeologous chromo-
somes for hexaploid wheat and tested their genome specificity using
PCR assays. A total of 85% primers showed genome specificity and
identified A, B and D-genome homoeologs (Supplemental Table 51
and Supplemental Fig. S2).

4 Conclusion

With the rapid increase of polyploid genome sequence data from high-
throughput sequencing technologies, effective primer design tools for
homeologous sequences from the subgenomes of polyploids has be-
come an important component of gene and genome analysis. GSP is a
time-saving, user-friendly and easy-to-use web tool for designing gen-
ome-specific primers to distinguish sequences among the subgenomes
of polyploid species. This web application tool can be easily extended
to other polyploids when their genome sequences become available.

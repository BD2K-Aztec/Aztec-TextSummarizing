ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein structural research in plants lags behind that in
animal and bacterial species. This lag concerns both the structural
analysis of individual proteins and the proteome-wide characterization
of structure-related properties. Until now, no systematic study con-
cerning the relationships between protein disorder and multiple post-
translational modifications (PTMs) in plants has been presented.
Results: In this work, we calculated the global degree of intrinsic
disorder in the complete proteomes of eight typical monocotyledon-
ous and dicotyledonous plant species. We further predicted multiple
sites for phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation and methylation
and examined the correlations of protein disorder with the presence
of the predicted PTM sites. It was found that phosphorylation, acetyl-
ation and O-glycosylation displayed a clear preference for occurrence
in disordered regions of plant proteins. In contrast, methylation tended
to avoid disordered sequence, whereas N-glycosylation did not show
a universal structural preference in monocotyledonous and dicotyle-
donous plants. In addition, the analysis performed revealed significant
differences between the integral characteristics of monocot and dicot
proteomes. They included elevated disorder degree, increased rate of
O-glycosylation and R-methylation, decreased rate of N-glycosylation,
K-acetylation and K-methylation in monocotyledonous plant species,
as compared with dicotyledonous species. Altogether, our study pro-
vides the most compelling evidence so far for the connection between
protein disorder and multiple PTMs in plants.

1 INTRODUCTION

Proteins with long disordered regions, often referred to as intrin-
sically disordered regions (IDRs), have been extensively investi-
gated over the past several years. They represent a broad class of
proteins found more abundantly in eukaryotes than in bacteria
or archaea (Dunker et al., 2001). It was estimated that more than
one-third of eukaryotic proteins contain IDRs of >30 residues in

length Ward et al., 2004a). Other bioinformatics studies indi-
cated that more than half of eukaryotic proteins possess IDRs
and ~25—30% of the proteins are mostly disordered (Oldﬁeld
et al., 2005a and b; Uversky, 2011). The proteins with IDRs
are also widespread in plant proteomes with the overall proteome
disorder content in different plant species being typical for other
eukaryotes (Dunker et al., 2001; Fukuchi et al., 2011; Xue et al.,
2012). These proteins fulﬁll important cellular functions in
plants, often serving as the integrators of multiple regulatory
and environmental signals (Sun et al., 2013). They are abundant
in the highly regulated processes, such as cellular signaling and
transcription (Kragelund et al., 2012). It has been estimated that
82—94% of all transcription factors, including those from
Arabidopsis thaliana, contain extended IDRs (Liu et al., 2006)
and >70% of signaling proteins have long disordered regions
(Iakoucheva et al., 2002).

IDRs share some common sequence features such as low
abundance of order-promoting and high abundance of dis-
order-promoting amino acids, low sequence complexity, poor
sequence conservation, low mean hydrophobicity, high net
charge, etc. (Dunker et al., 2001; Nishikawa et al., 2010;
Romero et al., 2001; Shimizu et al., 2007; Uversky et al.,
2000). At the structural level, they are distinguished by the
absence of stable secondary and/or tertiary structure, high ﬂexi-
bility, elevated ,8—sheet propensity and ability to undergo dis-
order-to-order transition when involved in protein—protein
interactions (Dunker et al., 2001; Uversky, 2011). These inter-
actions are characterized by high speciﬁcity coupled with low
afﬁnity, ensuring their transient character, selectivity and revers-
ibility. The speciﬁc sequence features together with the experi-
mental structure—related databases have been used to develop
speciﬁc predictors of intrinsic disorder. More than 50 tools
for protein disorder prediction have been developed up to now
(He et al., 2009; Uversky, 2011).

Disordered protein regions are often involved in post-transla-
tional modiﬁcations (PTMs). It has been hypothesized, based on
empirical evidence, that PTM sites are located predominantly in
the easily accessible and ﬂexible IDRs (Dunker et al., 2002).
Evidently, some advantages exist for positioning PTM sites
within disordered regions. This location would facilitate the spe-
ciﬁc sequence-dependent association with modifying enzymes
due to the high surface exposure and accessibility of the

disordered regions. In addition, PTMs would typically cause
only small changes on the surface of a structured protein,
whereas large-scale structural changes, such as disorder-
to-order transition, can be expected in a disordered region. The
larger structural changes would generally elicit a deeper impact
on protein function, ensuring a stronger regulatory effect of
PT Ms.

Numerous past studies addressed correlations between intrin-
sic disorder and individual PTMs in eukaryotic proteins. A well-
established example includes protein phosphorylation. Several
papers consistently reported that protein phosphorylation on
Ser, Thr and Tyr occurs predominantly in the disordered regions
of animal proteins (Fukuchi et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2010;
Iakoucheva et al., 2004; Yao et al., 2012). Recently, this correl-
ation has been conﬁrmed in plant species using a predictive tool
for analysis of protein phosphorylation in plants (Yao et al.,
2012). In addition, correlations between intrinsic disorder and
glycosylation have also been investigated. Dissimilar structural
preferences for the O-linked and N-linked protein glycosylation
have been reported, reﬂecting differences in the catalytic mech-
anisms of these PTMs (Fukuchi et al., 2011; Nishikawa et al.,
2010; Petrescu et al., 2004). Also, several studies addressed cor-
relations between intrinsic disorder and the universal Lys modi-
ﬁcations, such as acetylation and methylation. It has been
reported that acetylation and methylation showed a preference
for occurrence in the disordered regions of animal proteins
(Hansen et al., 2006); however, these reports were challenged
by other researchers (Pang et al., 2007; Yao et al., 2012).

In the present study, we analyzed proteome-wide correlations
of protein disorder with the main types of eukaryotic PTMs,
such as Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation, Pro O-glycosylation, Asn
N-glycosylation, Lys acetylation and Lys/Arg methylation in
several typical monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant
species. In agreement with the previous studies, we observed
that phosphorylation, acetylation and O-glycosylation displayed
a preference for occurrence in the disordered regions of plant
proteins. However, in contrast to the previous results obtained
using combined datasets of eukaryotic proteins, we found,
based on the set of tools used in this study, that methylation
tended to occur in ordered protein regions. Also, we found
that N—glycosylation did not show a clear preference for either
ordered or disordered regions of plant proteins.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

In this study, the complete proteomes of dicotyledonous plant species,
such as A.thaliana (thale cress) (Swarbreck et al., 2008), Glycine max
(soybean) (Schmutz et al., 2010), Populus trichocarpa (poplar) (Tuskan
et al., 2006), Vitis vinifera (grape) (J aillon et al., 2007), Solanum lycoper-
sicum (tomato) (Sato et al., 2012), as well as the proteomes of monocoty-
ledonous plants, such as Oryza saliva (rice) (Ouyang et al., 2007),
Brachypodium distachyon (purple false brome) (Vogel et al., 2010) and
Sorghum bicolor (sorghum) (Paterson et al., 2009), have been analyzed.
The datasets covering the whole proteomes of the eight plant species were
constructed using the proteome resources available at Phytozome
(Goodstein et al., 2012) (http://www.phytozome.net/). The redundancy
check was executed using the OrthoMCL tool (Chen et al., 2006)
(http://orthomcl.org/cgi-bin/OrthoMcheb.cgi?rm=orthomcl#Software)

to remove the amino acid sequences with the pi_cutoff=90,
pmatch_cutoff=90 and pv_cutoff=le-30 options. The ﬁnal non-redun-
dant datasets of full proteome amino acid sequences were obtained by
ﬁltering out a small number of entries containing <50 and >2000 amino
acids in length. The ﬁltering statistics and the total numbers of sequences
in the resulting datasets are presented in Supplementary Table S1. The
average length of amino acid sequences in plant proteomes was calculated
using Proteomix software (Chikayama et al., 2004).

2.2 Prediction of protein disorder and PTMs

To calculate intrinsic disorder in plant proteins, the following predictive
algorithms have been used in this study—RONN version 3 (Yang et al.,
2005), POODLE—L (Hirose et al., 2007) and DISOPRED2 (Ward et al.,
2004b) provided online (http://www.strubi.ox.ac.uk/RONN, http://mbs.
cbrc.jp/poodle/poodle.html and http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/disopred/, re-
spectively). The three predictive algorithms were reported to have com-
parable accuracy of 85—90%. RONN was used as the main predictor in
this study because its scores were closer to the experimentally derived
scores of intrinsic disorder for PDB-deposited protein structures.
However, most of the results observed using RONN have also been con-
ﬁrmed with the two other tools and provided as Supplementary Data.

In this study, we analyzed four major types of eukaryotic protein
PTMs, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, methylation and acetyl-
ation. Speciﬁcally, Ser, Thr and Tyr phosphorylation, N—linked Asn gly-
cosylation, O-linked Pro glycosylation, Lys/Arg methylation and Lys
acetylation have been investigated. They have been predicted using the
following bioinformatics tools freely available on the web.

Phosphorylation sites were predicted with the Musite tool (Gao et al.,
2010) downloaded from http://musite.sourceforge.net/. The sites of
N—glycosylation were predicted with the NetNGlycl.0 tool (R.Gupta
et al. Unpublished data.) downloaded from http://www.cbs.dtu.
dk/cgi-bin/nph—sw_request?netNglyc. The sites of acetylation were
predicted using the online tool PAIL (Li et al., 2006) (http://bdmpail.
biocuckoo.org/), and the sites of methylation were identiﬁed with the
web tool PMeS (Shi et al., 2012) (http://bioinfo.ncu.edu.cn/inquiries_
PMeS.aspx). The previously reported consensus sequence [A/S/T/V]-
P(1,4)-X(0-10)-[A/S/T/V]-P(l,4) (Gomord et al., 2010) was used to
screen for the plant proteins containing sites of O-linked Pro glycosyla-
tion. The screening algorithm will be described in detail elsewhere.

2.3 PTM contents in ordered and disordered regions

Total numbers of speciﬁc PTM sites in ordered and disordered segments
of the eight plant proteomes have been calculated using the employed
predictive algorithms. These numbers were divided by the total numbers
of amino acids in the ordered or disordered segment of each proteome,
providing the values of normalized PTM contents. The relative abun-
dance of a speciﬁc PTM in the disordered and ordered segments of
plant proteomes was analyzed using the following ratio: Rd/o=Nd/
LdzNo/Lo, where No is the total number of PTM sites in the ordered
segment of a proteome, L0 is the length of the ordered proteome segment,
Nd is the total number of PTM sites in the disordered segment of a
proteome and Ld is the length of the disordered proteome segment. By
this deﬁnition, the Rd/o value equals 1 if the relative abundances of a
PTM in ordered and disordered regions are the same. It assumes a value
of >1 when a PTM has a preference for occurrence in disordered regions,
and it becomes <l if a PTM tends to occur in ordered regions.

2.4 3D homology modeling of protein structure
Three-dimensional structure of IAA-alanine resistant gene 3 (IAR3) from
A.thaliana (AT1G51760) was built by homology modeling based on the

crystal structure of IAA-leucine resistant like gene 2 (ILL2) from
A.thaliana (AT5G56660) resolved at a resolution of 2A. The coordinate

ﬁle of the template was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB:
lxmb chain A). The modeled range covered residues 34—427, sequence
identity between the model and its template was 58% (Supplementary
Fig. S 1). This sequence identity is considered to be high enough to make a
reliable homology model. Homology modeling was carried out using the
protein structure homology-modeling server SWISS-MODEL (Arnold
et al., 2006; Schwede et al., 2003) (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/).
Structure visualization and mapping of predicted PTM sites in this
model was done with PYMOL (DeLano, 2002) (http://www.pymol.org/).

The generated model was validated using QMEAN analysis (Benkert
et al., 2008, 2009). The QMEAN score of the model, which ranges between
0 and 1, with higher values indicating better quality, was calculated to be
0.599, indicating good overall quality of the generated structure. The resi-
dues with the highest estimated errors were found to be located mainly in
the loop regions of the computational model. The summary of the struc-
tural homology modeling is presented in Supplementary Figure S1.

2.5 Correlation analysis and statistical signiﬁcance
The protein disorder degree has been correlated with the speciﬁc content
of analyzed PTMs in plant proteins. The robustness of the observed
correlations was conﬁrmed by pairwise (disorder degree versus PTM
content) regression analysis. The degree of correlation between the con-
tents of various analyzed PTMs and protein disorder was evaluated by
calculating Pearson correlation coefﬁcients. The statistical signiﬁcance of
the Pearson correlation coefﬁcients was determined by calculating one-
tailed probability values, given the correlation value (r) and the sample
size (n), with the signiﬁcance level set to 0.05.

Calculations of correlation coefﬁcients and P—values were performed
using the online statistics calculators available at http://www.danielsoper.
com/statcalc3/.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Comparison of datasets and global intrinsic disorder in
plant proteomes

Plants are known to contain large gene families of closely related
members due to frequent genome duplications. The number of
sequences in the analyzed plant proteomes varied greatly from
~26 000 entries in the grape V.vinifera to >51000 sequences in
the rice 0.sativa (Supplementary Table S1). The redundancy
check was carried out for every plant species studied to remove
the amino acid sequences with >90% identity. As it could be
expected, the redundancy of amino acid sequences was higher
in large proteomes. Strong positive correlation has been observed
between the content of redundant sequences and proteome
size (Supplementary Fig. S2). We have further determined the
average length of amino acid sequences in the plant proteomes,
which varied from 345 amino acids in 0.sativa to 421 amino
acids in B. distachyon (Supplementary Table S1). In the following
analysis, the number of predicted PTM sites in proteins was
normalized to the uniform length of 400 amino acids, rather
than per sequence, considering the difference in the average
protein lengths in the datasets.

A signiﬁcant variation in the degree of protein disorder has
been observed using RONN among the proteomes of the analyzed
plants, ranging from 23% in V.vinifera to ~34% in 0.sativa spe-
cies (Fig. 1A). Notably, the disorder degree was signiﬁcantly
higher in monocots than in dicots (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Considering the importance of this ﬁnding, its statistical signiﬁ-
cance was independently conﬁrmed using the alternative disorder

Fig. 1. Evaluation of global protein disorder in plant proteomes. (A)
Proteome disorder content was calculated with the RONN tool in the
studied plant species. The results of pairwise correlation analysis between
the disorder content and proteome size are shown in (B)

prediction tools POODLE and DISOPRED (Supplementary Fig.
S3B and C). The elevated disorder content in the rice 0.sativa, as
compared with other plant species, has also been reported by
other studies (Fukuchi et al., 201 l; Xue et al., 2012). In accordance
with the previous report, that the content of intrinsic disorder is
generally independent of the proteome size (Xue et al., 2012), no
signiﬁcant correlation between the proteome size and disorder
content has been observed in plants (Fig. IE).

3.2 Correlation of intrinsic disorder with phosphorylation

Reversible protein phosphorylation is the most extensively stu-
died PTM because it provides a major regulatory mechanism in
eukaryotic cells. Phosphorylation was reported to be overrepre-
sented in the disordered regions of eukaryotic proteins, including
plants (Gao et al., 2010; Iakoucheva et al., 2004). Many sites of
phosphorylation have been experimentally associated with the
regions of intrinsic disorder. It has been reported that amino
acid composition, sequence complexity, hydrophobicity, charge
and other sequence attributes of regions adjacent to phosphor-
ylation sites are similar to those of intrinsically disordered pro-
tein regions (Iakoucheva et al., 2004), supporting the ﬁndings
that phosphorylation occurs predominantly within IDRs.
Previously, the bioinformatics tool Musite has been developed
to predict phosphorylation sites based on the distinctive features
of protein sequence (Gao et al., 2010). It has been successfully
applied to predict phosphorylation sites in plant proteins. It was
reported that, for an overall plant model, Musite outperforms
the plant-speciﬁc tools, such as PlantPhos (Lee et al., 2011) and
PhosPhAt (Durek et al., 2010), in prediction accuracy (Yao et al.,
2012). An average accuracy of PlantPhos was estimated to be
82.4% for serine, 78.6% for threonine and 89.0% for tyrosine
models (Lee et al., 2011). In this work, we used the superior
algorithm Musite to predict phosphorylation sites in the ana-
lyzed plant species. It was found that the average abundance
of phosphorylation sites in different species varied on a small
scale (Fig. 2A), suggesting common phosphorylation require-
ments in various plant species. Importantly, strong positive
correlation was evident between protein disorder and phosphor-
ylation. In every plant species analyzed, the positive correlation
between the predicted number (from 0 to :4) of Ser, Thr or
Tyr phosphorylation sites and the degree of intrinsic disorder
has been observed (Fig. 2B—D). All of these correlations had
a high statistical signiﬁcance, as it could be judged from the
one-tailed probability values of the calculated correlation coefﬁ-
cients (Table l). Notably, the positive correlation between

protein disorder and phosphorylation has also been conﬁrmed
when the alternative bioinformatics tool POODLE was used to
predict the degree of intrinsic disorder (Supplementary Fig. S4).
These data agree well with the previous reports. Thus, they pro-
vide a validation for the employed method of bioinformatics
analysis.

3.3 Correlations of intrinsic disorder with glycosylation

Protein glycosylation is one of the most common PTMs in eu-
karyotic cells. The attachment of glycans affects protein folding,
solubility and stability. It also alters the essential biological func-
tions, such as immunogenicity, catalytic activity, clearance,
ligand-receptor interactions, etc. (\Nebster and Thomas, 2012).

sites in the studied plant proteomes is presented in (A). Relative rates

and Y phosphorylation sites are presented in (B), (C) and (D),
respectively

Two major types of protein glycosylation have been discovered
in eukaryotes, O-linked and N-linked glycosylation. The signiﬁ-
cant differences in O-glycosylation between plants and animals
have been described, including the sites of glycan addition and
glycan composition. It was found that in plants, glycans are
mainly attached to hydroxylproline (Hyp). Protein disorder
was suggested to facilitate hydroxylation of proline residues
(Hon et al., 2002). The addition of O-glycans to the hydroxyl
group of Hyp is unique to plants. Although the target motif for
Hyp-O-linked glycosylation in plants has been established (for
details, see Sections 2 and 4), no bioinformatics tool is freely
available as of now to predict O-glycosylation sites in plant pro-
teins. In the present study, we used the previously reported con-
sensus sequence to screen for the sites of Hyp-O-linked
glycosylation.

It was found that the average abundance of O-glycosylation
varied signiﬁcantly in the studied plant species from ~08 to >1 .2
sites per protein (Fig. 3A). The content of O-glycosylation was
signiﬁcantly higher in monocots than in dicots. Remarkably, the
number of predicted sites for O-glycosylation correlated posi-
tively with the content of intrinsic disorder in plant proteins. In
every plant species analyzed, positive correlation between the
predicted number of O-glycosylation sites (from 0 to :4) and
the content of intrinsic disorder has been observed (Fig. 3B).
Similarly to phosphorylation, all of these correlations had a
high statistical signiﬁcance, as attested by the one-tailed prob-
ability values for the calculated correlation coefﬁcients (Table l).
The positive correlation between protein disorder and O-glyco-
sylation has also been conﬁrmed with the alternative bioinfor-
matics tool POODLE (Supplementary Fig. S5A).

Another major type of protein glycosylation in plants, N-
linked glycosylation, is arguably the most conserved form of
protein glycosylation in eukaryotes (Wilson, 2002). In plant
cells, like in other eukaryotic cells, N-linked glycans are attached

linked glycosylation pathway in plants shares a high degree of
homology with that in other eukaryotic organisms. Therefore,
we used the general prediction algorithm NetNgly1.0 for predict-
ing N-glycosylation in plant proteins. This tool revealed some
degree of variation in the average abundance of N-glycosylation
in the studied plant species (Fig. 3C). In general, the content of
N-glycosylation was lower in monocots than in dicots.
Importantly, unlike O-glycosylation, no universal tendency has
been observed between the predicted presence of N-glycosylation
sites and protein disorder. N-glycosylation tended to correlate
positively with disorder content in the dicotyledonous species,
such as A.thaliana, Gmax, P.trichocarpa, V.vinifera and
Slycopersicam; however, the weak negative correlation between
protein disorder and N-glycosylation was witnessed in the mono-
cotyledonous 0.sativa, B.a’istachyon and S.bicolor (Fig. 3D,
Table l). Notably, many of the observed correlations had a
low statistical signiﬁcance (Table l). The correlations of N-
linked glycosylation with protein disorder have also been con-
ﬁrmed using the alternative tool POODLE for predicting protein
disorder (Supplementary Fig. S5B).

3.4 Correlations of intrinsic disorder with acetylation and
methylation

Acetylation of internal lysines on a-amino group and methylation
on lysines and arginines are the highly reversible enzymatic reac-
tions that change electrostatic properties of a protein molecule by
neutralizing the positive charge of lysine and arginine residues.
Alongside with protein phosphorylation, these PTMs play a
major regulatory role in eukaryotic cells. The evidence has been
presented that these PTMs may counteract phosphorylation, sug-
gesting that the balance between phosphorylation and acetyl-
ation/methylation is important for physiologically relevant
regulation (Kramer and Heinzel, 2010; Sakamaki et al., 2011).
In the present work, we used the general acetylation prediction
tool PAIL, freely available on the Internet, to predict the sites of

lysine acetylation. The accuracies of PAIL were reported to be
85.13, 87.97 and 89.21% at low, medium and high thresholds,
respectively (Li et al., 2006). This algorithm was trained on a set
of experimentally veriﬁed acetylation sites from different eukary-
otic proteins belonging to various biological species, including
plants. We have found that the content of acetyllysine varied
in the analyzed plant species from 12 to 16 sites per protein
(Fig. 4A). The content of lysine acetylation was markedly
lower in monocots than in dicots. A signiﬁcant correlation has
been observed between the predicted presence of lysine acetyl-
ation sites and protein disorder. Contents of acetyllysine and
disorder correlated positively in all plant species analyzed
(Fig. 4B). Importantly, all of these correlations were statistically
signiﬁcant at 95% conﬁdence level (Table l).

Methylation of internal lysines and arginines is a PTM com-
monly found in proteins associated with nucleic acids, such as
histones and transcriptional regulators. We have found that this
modiﬁcation displayed a negative correlation with protein dis-
order in the analyzed plant species, suggesting that it has a pref-
erence for occurrence in ordered regions (Fig. 4D and
Supplementary Figures S6B and S7B). In every plant species
analyzed, the negative correlation between the predicted
number of methylation sites (from 0 to :7) and protein disorder
has been observed. Most of these correlations were statistically
signiﬁcant, as conﬁrmed by the one-tailed probability values of
the correlation coefﬁcients (Table l). Notably, in contrast to
lysine acetylation and lysine methylation, the content of arginine
methylation was found to be signiﬁcantly higher in monocots
than in dicots (Fig. 4C). Most probably, this can be attributed
to the relative abundance of lysine and arginine in the plant
species analyzed. We have found that lysine content is decreased
and arginine content is increased in the monocotyledonous
plants, as compared with those in the dicotyledonous plants
(data not shown). The observed correlations of acetylation and
methylation with protein disorder have also been conﬁrmed with
the alternative bioinformatics tool POODLE (Supplementary
Fig. S7).

3.5 Relative contents of PTMs in ordered and disordered
regions of plant proteins

To independently verify the observed correlations, relative abun-
dances of speciﬁc PTMs in ordered and disordered regions of
plant proteins have been determined. The values of the relative
abundances were presented as a ratio of normalized PTM con-
tents (Rd/o) in disordered and ordered segments of plant prote-
omes (for details, see Section 2.3). The results of these
calculations are shown in Table 2. In general, they conﬁrm the
major ﬁndings of correlation analysis, such as the preference of
phosphorylation, O-glycosylation and acetylation for occurrence
in disordered regions and the opposite tendency for methylation.
Moreover, this approach allowed us to estimate the robustness of
the observed correlations. For instance, high values of the Rd/o
parameter obtained for phosphorylation and O-glycosylation
(22.5 and 25.2, respectively) were indicative of robust relation-
ships, whereas the correlation between protein disorder and
acetylation was less robust, as it could be judged from the
lower Rd/o value (21.6) calculated for this PTM (Table 2).
Similarly, arginine methylation, which has a preference for oc-
currence in ordered protein regions, displayed more robust cor-
relation in dicots than in monocots, as it is suggested by Rd/o
values (Table 2). This ﬁnding is consistent with the results of
correlation analysis, indicating a higher statistical signiﬁcance
of this correlation in dicots (Table l). Notably, in contrast to
correlation analysis that failed to detect any universal preference
for N-glycosylation (Table l), the alternative approach revealed
that this PTM favors disordered regions in all plant species ana-
lyzed (Table 2). Possible explanation for this discrepancy is pro-
vided further in Section 4 based on statistical signiﬁcance of the
obtained results.

3.6 Mapping PTMs on a protein structure

To highlight the correlations observed, the predicted sites of
PTMs analyzed in this study were mapped onto the modeled
3D structure of the plant protein IAA-amino acid hydrolase
from A.thaliana (Fig. 5). The PTM sites in this protein have
been predicted with the bioinformatics tools used in the pre-
sent study. The protein structure was built by homology mod-
eling based on the crystal structure of IAA-leucine resistant
like gene 2 (ILL2) (AT5G56660). The summary and validation
of the molecular modeling are presented in Supplementary
Figure S1 (see Section 2 for more details). All in all, 35 pu-
tative PTM sites have been mapped in this protein. The stat-
istics of their occurrence in the ordered and disordered regions

of the protein molecule is presented in the right up corner of
Figure 5. It agrees well with the correlations revealed by this
study. Most notably, the sites of phosphorylation and O-gly-
cosylation are mapped preferentially in unstructured regions,
the sites of N-glycosylation and acetylation display no clear
preference for either ordered or disordered sequence, and the
sites of methylation are mapped mainly in the structured re-
gions of the protein molecule. The model illustrates well the
major ﬁndings of this study.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work, we examined the correlations between protein dis-
order and multiple PTMs in eight monocotyledonous and di-
cotyledonous plant species. Previous studies suggested that
enzyme-mediated reversible PTMs have a preference for surface
accessible and disordered environments. In accordance with this
idea, we have found that disorder content correlates positively
with the presence of predicted phosphorylation sites in plant
proteins (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S4; Table 2). The posi-
tive correlations between protein disorder and Ser, Thr and Tyr
phosphorylation had a high statistical signiﬁcance (Table 1).
These observations are in good agreement with the previous
studies of eukaryotic proteins from animal species. For instance,
data mining of human proteome revealed that phosphorylation
occurs two to three times more often within disordered than
ordered regions (Fukuchi et al., 2011). The same magnitude of
difference has been observed in our present study using calcula-
tion of relative PTM abundance in ordered and disordered seg-
ments of plant proteomes (Table 2). In addition, similar results
were obtained previously on the investigation of PDB-annotated
structures of plant proteins with the disorder-assisted tool for
prediction of phosphorylation sites Musite (Yao et al., 2012).
Thus, it can be concluded that the analytic approach applied
in our study is adequate in general, considering high consistency
of the obtained results on phosphorylation.

It has been reported previously that the sites of O-linked gly-
cosylation are predominantly located in the IDRs of mammalian

Correlations of disorder and PTMs in plants

 

proteins (Fukuchi et al., 2011; Nishikawa et al., 2010). In the
present study too, the strong positive correlation between protein
disorder and O-glycosylation has been evidenced in plant pro-
teins (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S5A; Tables 1 and 2). The
existence of this correlation should be attributed, in the ﬁrst
place, to the distinctive pattern of O-glycosylation in plants,
which occurs predominantly on Pro residues. The target motif
of O-glycosylation has been found to include at least two [A/S/T/
V]-P repeats (Tan et al., 2003). The presence of multiple Pro
residues in the regions of plant O-glycosylation consensus se-
quence [A/S/T/V]-P(1,4)-X(0—10)-[A/S/T/V]-P(1,4) (Gomord
et al., 2010) makes the formation of secondary structure in
these regions virtually impossible. Hence, the positive correlation
between protein disorder and O-glycosylation in plants could be
expected.

On the other hand, N-glycosylation is known to occur co-
translationally before a protein is fully folded. This should
result in the lack of any structural preference for this modiﬁca-
tion. In accordance with this consideration, no clear structural
preference has been reported for N-glycosylation in animal pro-
teins (Petrescu et al., 2004). Consistently, the correlation analysis
performed in our study also failed to reveal a strong universal
unidirectional relationship between N-glycosylation and protein
disorder in plant proteins (Fig. 3D, Supplementary Fig. S5B).
Instead, N-glycosylation was found to correlate with disorder
content positively in dicotyledonous plant species and negatively
in monocotyledonous species, both with a low statistical signiﬁ-
cance, suggesting species-speciﬁc patterns of N-glycosylation in
plants (Table 1). It should be noted in this connection that pre-
vious studies pointed to the existence of species-, organ- and
development-speciﬁc N-glycosylation patterns in plants
(Gomord et al., 2010). Thus, it can be hypothesized that the
modifying enzyme, oligosaccharyltransferase, may display select-
ive recognition for the speciﬁc modiﬁcation sites in different
plant species. Still, at present, no experimental evidence for
existence of these differences has been presented and there is
obviously a need for systematic studies on the glycosylation pat-
terns in various plant species.

Notably, in contrast to correlation analysis, the alternative
approach based on the calculation of relative PTM abundance
in ordered and disordered segments of plant proteomes revealed
that this PTM has a weak preference for disordered sequence in
all plant species analyzed (Table 2). Presumably, this discrepancy
may be attributed to the low accuracy of the NetNGlyc pre-
dictor. Its reported overall accuracy was the lowest among all
the tools used, reaching only 76% in a cross-validated experi-
ment (http: //www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/abstract.php).
Considering that the reported predictive accuracy of RONN is
~85% (Yang et al., 2005), it can be approximated that the Rd/o
values within 0.6—l.4 may not be statistically signiﬁcant. Thus,
the correlations between N-glycosylation and disorder observed
in monocots should be treated as unreliable, whereas the correl-
ations in dicots are of low robustness, as it is suggested by the
Rd/o values (Table 2). Consistently, the similar conclusion can
be drawn based on the statistical signiﬁcance of Pearson coefﬁ-
cients obtained by correlation analysis (Table 1).

It has been reported previously that acetyllysine is more likely
to be found within surface-accessible and disordered protein re-
gions, whereas methyllysine does not show any signiﬁcant

preference for surface accessibility or intrinsic disorder (Pang
et al., 2007). On the contrary, it was found on building an
SVM predictor for protein methylation, that both Arg and Lys
methylation sites are likely to be intrinsically disordered (Daily
et al., 2005). The most recent study of correlations between
PTMs and intrinsic disorder reported that methylation had a
preference for occurrence in disordered regions and acetylation
did not show any signiﬁcant preference for either disordered or
ordered regions (Gao and Xu, 2012). Now, our present work
demonstrates that methylation tends to occur in ordered regions,
whereas acetylation shows a preference for disordered regions
(Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs S6 and S7; Tables 1 and 2). The
reason for discrepancy of the results obtained in these studies
is presently unclear.

Most probably, this inconsistence can be attributed to the
drastic difference in the analyzed datasets. In the previous stu-
dies, the datasets included proteins from various eukaryotic spe-
cies, whereas our study was conducted on the individual plant
proteomes. Notably, combining the entries from different species
in one dataset may be detrimental to correlation analysis.
Opposite correlations between the contents of protein disorder
and speciﬁc PTM can be observed among the individual plant
species. For instance, the negative correlation between protein
disorder and N-glycosylation has been revealed in the monocoty-
ledonous 0.sativa, B.a’istachyon and S.bicolor; however, the op-
posite tendency was evident in the dicotyledonous A.thaliana, G.
max, P.trichocarpa, V.vim'fera and Slycopersicum (Fig. 3D,
Supplementary Fig. S5B; Table 1). At present, no other compar-
able data are available to elaborate this issue, as the correlations
between PTMs and protein disorder in the individual plant spe-
cies have not been investigated and compared before. Additional
studies are required to conﬁrm the observed tendencies in the
particular plant species using various alternative bioinformatics
and experimental approaches.

Another factor that can potentially compromise the performed
correlation analysis is applicability of the used prediction algo-
rithms for analysis of plant proteins. In this connection, it should
be noted that both the methylation predictor PMeS and the
acetylation predictor PAIL were trained on the databases that
included plant proteins. The tools were annotated as the general
PTM predictors for eukaryotic proteins. Admittedly, these algo-
rithms have not been comprehensively applied to plants and their
performance exclusively for plant proteins have not been evalu-
ated. Still, it is hard to acclaim that both tools systematically
misrepresent the modiﬁcation sites in certain plant proteins, as
this problem has never come to light before in the related studies.
In addition, it is unlikely that observed discrepancy with the
previously obtained results is introduced by a bias of the protein
disorder prediction algorithm RONN, as the observed correl-
ations have been conﬁrmed with the alternative disorder predic-
tion tool POODLE.

Thus, the surprising ﬁnding of our study that methylation has
a preference for occurrence in the ordered protein regions, re-
ﬂects most probably a bona ﬁde tendency in the investigated
plant species. This ﬁnding was conﬁrmed independently by
both correlation analysis (Table l) and by calculation of methy-
lation content in the ordered and disordered segments of plant
proteomes (Table 2). Moreover, the observed tendency con-
cerned both Arg and Lys methylation sites (Fig. 4,

Supplementary Fig. S7; Table 2). In this connection, the PMeS
prediction algorithm achieved the accuracies of 92.82 and
89.16% for arginine and lysine, respectively (Shi et al., 2012).
Notably, Arg methylation was found to be more abundant
than Lys methylation (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. S6A); the
two PTMs are known to be catalyzed by different enzymes.
Previously, the studies of PRMTl, the major methyltransferase
responsible for ~85% of total Arg methylation in mammalian
cells, demonstrated that this enzyme has a broad substrate spe-
ciﬁcity, with a preference for Arg residues ﬂanked by one or
more Gly residues (Gary and Clarke, 1998). More recent studies
found that some distal substrate residues also affect Arg methy-
lation (Osborne et al., 2007), suggesting the existence of add-
itional recognition determinants for this enzyme. Notably,
PRMTl homologs have been biochemically characterized in
A.thaliana and 0.sativa (Ahmad et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2007).
In light of our ﬁndings, it is tempting to surmise that both Arg-
and Lys-speciﬁc plant methylases may recognize some structural
determinants of modiﬁcation sites, directing their speciﬁcity to-
ward the substrate residues located in the ordered regions of
plant proteins. Presently, no experimental evidence has been pre-
sented for existence of the additional structural recognition de-
terminants of methylation in plants.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that some PTMs, such
as phosphorylation, O-glycosylation and acetylation, display a
clear preference for occurrence in disordered regions of plant
proteins. However, the opposite tendency is evident for methy-
lation, and N-glycosylation does not display a universal prefer-
ence for either ordered or disordered protein regions. Also,
our analysis reveals the marked differences between the integral
characteristics of monocot and dicot proteomes. They include
elevated disorder degree, increased rate of O-glycosylation and
R-methylation, decreased rate of N-glycosylation, K-acetylation
and K-methylation in monocotyledonous plant species, as com-
pared with dicotyledonous species. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst time when these differences are brought to light in a
genome-wide study of plant proteins. The differences observed
should reﬂect the large variation in the major PTM systems of
monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. At present, the
evolutionary and environmental background underlying this
variation is not established.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The topology of the network induced by the neurons
connectivity’s in the Caenorhabditis elegans differs from most
common random networks. The neurons positions of the C.elegans
have been previously explained as being optimal to induce
the required network wiring. We here propose a complementary
explanation that the network wiring is the direct result of a local
stochastic synapse formation process.

Results: We show that a model based on the physical distance
between neurons can explain the C.elegans neural network structure,
specifically, we demonstrate that a simple model based on a
geometrical synapse formation probability and the inhibition of short
coherent cycles can explain the properties of the C.elegans’ neural
network. We suggest this model as an initial framework to discuss
neural network generation and as a first step toward the development
of models for more advanced creatures. In order to measure the
circle frequency in the network, a novel graph-theory circle length
measurement algorithm is proposed.

1 INTRODUCTION

Neural networks can have up to 100 billion synapses (Kandel and
Jesse], 2000). The information deﬁning the position of each synapse
is not hard coded into the genome, since the number of genes coding
for the properties of the neural network does not exceed a few
hundred, even for the complex network of the Homo sapiens (Kandel
and Jesse], 2000). Axon guidance, for example, is determined by a
few tens of genes [speciﬁcally 93 in the Caenorhabditis elegans
(CE)] mainly Nertins, Ephrins and Semphorins (Schmitz et al.,
2007). The position of each synapse must therefore be determined
by other means. The synapse positions can be a combination
of genetically coded hardwired connections, stochastic processes
or learning mechanisms (Aoto et al., 2007; Bear et al., 1987;
Cuthbert et al., 2007; Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1997; Federmeier
et al., 2002; Gruart and Delgado—Garcia, 2007; Jelks et al., 2007;
Martin et al., 2000; Nikitin, 2007). The relation between the neurons
positions and the network wiring has been extensively studied in
the context of optimal wiring (Bolz and Castellani, 1997; Buzsaki
et al., 2004; Chklovskii et al., 2002; Cruz—Rivera et al., 1998;
Gafarov, 2006; Itzkovitz et al., 2008; Kaiser and Hilgetag, 2006;

Karbowski, 2001; Kitano and Fukai, 2007; Lee et al., 2008; Milo
et al., 2004; Mitchison, 1991; Mizuno et al., 2007; Perez—Escudero
and de Polavieja, 2007). The neuron positioning was proposed to
be optimized to minimize the total axon and dendrite lengths (Chen
et al., 2006; Perez—Escudero and de Polavieja, 2007). The neuron
positions were indeed found to reduce the wiring length (compared
to a random positioning). However, it is not clear whether the neuron
positioning is optimized to minimize the wiring or if the short wiring
is simply the result of the preferential attachment of nearby neurons.
The only currently existing fully mapped neural network is the one
of the CE. As part of the CE project, a full map of the CE cells was
produced, and all neurons and synapses were mapped (Achacoso,
1992). The observed CE has 302 neurons and 2170 synapses, which
are divided into motor, sensor and intermediate neurons. A wide
distribution of synaptic connections characterizes the CE network.
Neurons with a high number of synaptic connections are mostly
localized on the main nerve ring. The nerve rings, bundles of
~100 axons encircling the outside of the pharynx, are the principal
circumferential tracts in the CE nervous system (White and Rainbow,
1986). Axons from sensory neurons in the anterior ganglia form six
labial nerves that enter the nerve ring at its anterior margin. Most
axons from neurons in the lateral ganglia enter the nerve ring at its
posterior margin either laterally or ventrally via the ventral ganglion.
Other neurons, such as sensors and motor neurons, are naturally
localized near the edges of the nematode. However, there are also
a large number of sensors near the pharynx because the pharynx
centralizes much of the sensory activity of the nematode.

In the current work, we propose to study the CE NN generation
mechanism using network theory tools. We represent the CE NN
neurons as nodes and synapses as edges. Hundreds of network
generation mechanisms were proposed in the last few years, some
very generic and some speciﬁc to a given network (e.g. among many
others (Amaral et al., 2000; Barabasi and Albert, 1999; Blank and
Solomon, 2000; J eong et al., 2000; Jose and Bishop, 2003; Louzoun
et al., 2006; Michalis et al., 1999; Noh, 2003; Ravasz and Barabasi,
2003; Watts and Strogatz, 1998; Willinger et al., 2002).

The simplest network generation mechanism model was
suggested by Erdos and Renyi (1959). In this model, a network
is constructed by randomly connecting nodes. For a given Erdos—
Renyi Network with n nodes [ERN(n,p)], the probability of
connecting each pair is p. This network has a Poisson degree
distribution,1 and short average geodesic distances between nodes.2

 

1The degree of a node is the number of other nodes directly connected to
it.mk

2The geodesic distance between two nodes is the minimal number of edges
in the path between the two nodes.

Another well known set of models explains Scale Free Networks
(SFN). These networks have a power—law degree distribution, where
the probability that a random node would have k neighbors is
p(k)=k_3’, with values of y usually between 2 and 3 (Barabasi
and Albert, 1999). A more structured model was proposed by
Strogatz and Watts (SW) (1998). This model explains the frequently
observed combination of short geodesic paths and a high clustering
coefﬁcient.3 The average geodesic path of the network represents
the average minimal number of edges from a random node to
another one, and the clustering coefﬁcient of the network quantiﬁes
approximately the fraction of closed triangles in the network. This
model basically transfers a spatial regular lattice into an Erdos—
Renyi network. Models incorporating the nodes positions were also
proposed such as the gravity model (Burrowes et al., 2004; Chen
et al., 2008; Imanishi et al., 2004; Kalveram, 1992; Karpyn and Piri,
2007; Lippi Bruni et al., 2008; Piri and Karpyn, 2007; Riviere et al.,
2006; Segers et al., 2008; Xiang et al., 2006; Yiotis et al., 2006;
Zhang and Jarrett, 1998). In the gravity model, the probability of an
edge between a node couple decreases with the distances between
the nodes. Speciﬁcally, in the context of the CE, Artzy—Randrup
(Artzy—Randrup and Ben Tal, 2004) suggested that the small scale
motif analysis performed by Milo (Milo et al., 2002) should consider
the spatial features of the CE.

We here propose that the gravity model can explain many of
the observed CE neural network properties. In the current context,
this model can be interpreted as a synapse formation probability
proportional to a power of the physical distance between the soma
of the pre—synaptic neuron and the dendrite of the post—synaptic
neurons. The properties of this network depend on the spatial
positioning of the different neurons.

2 METHODS
2.1 Degree distribution

The degree k(i) of a node is deﬁned as the number of neighbors of the node i.
It can be divided into the indegree (degree of incoming edges), outdegree
(degree of outgoing edges) and total degree. P(k) is the probability that a
randomly selected node has a degree of k.

2.2 Distance distribution

The shortest path or geodesic distance d (i , j) is deﬁned as the minimal number
of edges from node i to j. Note that in a directed graph, the shortest path
d(i, j) from i to j is usually not equal to the shortest path d(j,i) between j
and i. In fact both are longer or equal to the undirected shortest path, since
the undirected path often violates the correct edges direction. The average
shortest path is deﬁned as the mean of the distance matrix that represents the
shortest paths between all connected nodes.

2.3 Clustering coefﬁcient

The clustering coefﬁcient [C .C (i)] of a node i is the fraction of its neighbors
that are connected one to each other. Given the set of k( i) neighbors of a node
i, one could in principle have k( i )[ k( i )-I ]/2 undirected edges between them.
The number of connected neighbors divided by k( i )[ k( i )-I ]/2 is the C .C . For
a large, completely random graph the average CC is <k>/N, while for a
clique (group of nodes which are completely connected to each others) the
CC is 1.

 

3The clustering coefﬁcient of a node in a network is the fraction of the node’s
neighbors that are connected one to each other. The clustering coefﬁcient of
a network is the average clustering coefﬁcient of its nodes.

2.4 Betweenness centrality (BC)

Given all the geodesic distance in a network, the betweenness centrality
C302) of a node v is deﬁned as the fraction of the shortest paths passing
through v:

CEO/)2 Z Ust(V)
0st
S74v7$t€V
where 0,, denotes the number of shortest paths from node se V to node
te V, and 05,02) is the number of shortest paths from node 5 to t passing
through v e V. We have computed the BC using the highly efﬁcient Brandes
algorithm (Brandes, 2001).

2.5 Small-scale motifs

We have characterized the network using the number of small connected sub—
graph frequency, compared with their expected frequency in a randomized
network (Itzhack, 2007; Kashtan et 01., 2004a, b; Louzoun et 01., 2006;
Milo et al., 2002). These 3—4 node sub—graphs are denoted as network
motifs. Recently, network motifs have attracted attention as a tool to study
networks’ microscopic details, such as the structure of connections between
all connected triplets (Milo et al., 2002). We have computed the motifs of
sizes 3 and 4 using a novel and highly efﬁcient algorithm (Itzhack, 2007).

2.6 Circle enumeration

A directed circle is a closed directed path containing no repetitions (i.e. none
of the nodes in the circle appears twice). We deﬁne a minimal circle as a circle
composed of a minimal path from one node to the other and the minimal
path back to the original node.

We have developed a rapid algorithm to enumerate all such circles. The
naive algorithm would ﬁnd the minimal geodesic path between all node pairs
in a directed graph, G(V,E), using a Breath First Search (BFS) algorithm
(Tutte, 2004), and check for each source node vsouIce whether nodes at the
end of the path have a direct edge to the source node vsource. This algorithm
would, however, count each circle multiple times (Supplementary Fig. Sl).
The only way to count each circle once would be to maintain a list of all
circles, and check for those only present once in the list. This naive algorithm
is extremely costly, and becomes impractical even for networks of a few
hundred nodes.

We developed a practical algorithm that counts each node only once. If a
circle of size r is counted j times in the naive algorithm, the circle counter of
size r increases only by 1/ j, every time this circle is measured. j is the number
of nodes in the circle, with a directed distance of r to the node pointing to
them in the circle. In other words, if in a circle of length 8 (for example),
the distance from a node vk to its precedent is <8, it implies that there is a
shortcut in this circle, and one will not count the circles when starting from
vk (Supplementary Fig. Sl). A circle of size r would be counted exactly r
times only if the direct distance from each node to its precedent is r — 1. We
thus do not use a data structure but only count for each circle how many
nodes have a distance of r — 1 to their precedent.

The total cost of the algorithm is 0(V*E*l) where 1 denotes the average
geodesic path length. The total memory cost is 0(V2 >1<L) (in the worst case),
where V2 denotes the number of all the shortest paths between pairs of nodes,
and 1 denotes the average geodesic path length.

2.7 Network analysis toolbox library

We have developed a comprehensive network analysis toolbox library
containing graph import and generation tools, graph manipulation routines
and network analysis tools to carry out a large number of network
measurements, across many applications and disciplines. This MatLab based
toolbox provides a coherent, easily expandable environment, which to
the best of our knowledge is the most complete graph analysis package
available today. At the time of writing, it implements over 100 analytical
and utility methods for graph analysis and manipulation (Muchnik, http://
www.1evmuchnik.net/Content/Networks/ComplexNetworksPackage.html).

Model for neural network generation

 

2.8 Translation of the CE neural network to a graph
The CE NN is fully mapped and contains 302 neurons and 2170 synaptic
connections between them (Achacoso, 1992; Durbin and Bodmer, 1987; Hall
and Russell, 1991; White and Rainbow, 1986; Wood, 1988). We used the
connectivity data (Chen et al., 2006) that was recently updated from an earlier
version (Achacoso, 1992). The connected part of the network contains 280
neurons and 2170 synaptic connections. Each synaptic connection between
a dendrite and an axon was treated as a single edge and each neuron was
represented as a node. All edges were considered to have an equal weight.

2.9 Simulation

We placed the neurons according to their observed positions, publicly
accessible in the ‘WonnAtlas’ project (WormAtlas, 2009). We deﬁned the
probability of creating an edge between two neurons as: p(i —> j) = c (dial-fa.
The c constant was set to produce the proper number of edges in the network
(synapses in the neural network), and the value of at was varied. For each
value of at, we check the average properties as measured from 50 simulations.
We used our publicly accessible network analysis toolbox to measure all the
networks properties (Muchnik).

3 RESULTS

The network properties of the CE NN differ from most known
networks. The CE NN stands half—way between an ERN and a scale
free network. The CE NN degree distribution is neither a power law
(black line in Fig. 1C), nor a Poisson distribution. The CE NN has
a large number of nodes with a very low degree on one side and a
fat tail on the other side. The CE NN clustering coefﬁcient is high
(0.19 versus 0.016 in parallel ERN). Its shortest paths distribution
is also longer than the one typical to ERN (Fig. 1A), and it has a
peculiar small—scale motif distribution (Supplementary Table S1).
The CE NN degree distribution also differs from the one expected
in a Strogatz and Watts model (Watts and Strogatz, 1998).

The CE NN evolves through cell division and synapse formation
(Bergamasco and Bazzicalupo, 2006; Chalﬁe et al., 1985; Chang
et al., 2006; Chatterjee and Sinha, 2007; Franks et al., 2006;
Kaufman et al., 2006; Klassen and Shen, 2007; Yamamoto and
Achacoso, 1992) over a limited spatial region (Achacoso, 1992).
Neurons with distant soma have a lower probability of being
connected, as can be seen from the observed distribution of synapses
and pre—synaptic soma physical distances (Fig. 2). Note that some
of the neurons are long and span most of the nematode body
affecting the distance distribution. The probability of connecting
two neurons decreases with the distance between the soma centers.
If only neurons with short span are considered, the decrease is
approximately geometrical with a power between 2 and 3, except
for a small group of distal connections that will be further discussed.

We here propose an attachment model that follows the observed
node position and synapse distance distributions. All neurons
were placed in their observed experimental position, and the
probability of creating an edge between two neurons was deﬁned
as: p(i—>j)=c(di,j)_a. In order to test the validity of our model,
we tested whether the model reproduces the generic features of
the observed CE NN. The only free parameter in the simulation
is 05. We run multiple simulations with different values of oz, and for
each such value, we did 50 simulations. Most of the properties of
the LS are similar to the CE NN for 05262.5 (Fig. 3 and Table 1).

The results from all the networks that we measured are summarized. The real CE NN
compared with the average results of 50 LS network (0: = 2.5), 50 ERN and 50 SFN.
The rows represent the networks and the columns the properties. The results of the
CE network are very similar to the spatial simulation. The only difference between the
networks is in the circle distribution.

feature is computed among all realizations of the LS with the same
value of 05.

A more complex feature of networks is the BC. The BC represents
for each node the sum of the fractions of his participation in
geodesic paths. The BC distributions of the LS and CE practically
overlap (Fig. 1D). Twenty percent of the nodes have an almost
zero centrality. These neurons represent sensors or motors located
at the edges of the nematode. The top 10% of the nodes have
an abnormally high BC (i.e 1000—7000). This group probably
represents the neurons located at the nerve rings—the parallel in
the CE to the CNS (Fig. 1D).

The properties of the LS network are sensitive to the value of
oz, and at at = 2.5 these properties are highly similar to the ones of
the observed CE NN (Fig. 3). In order to understand the meaning
of the optimal value of 05, we tested the effect of at on the LS
network structure. oz—values providing a good ﬁt to the CE NN

properties reside at the transition between a fully connected, yet
random network (in the Erdos—Renyi sense of the term) and a
disconnected one (Fig. 3B). This transition can also be observed
in the real CE NN (Fig. 3). As at grows, so does the average shortest
path, the clustering coefﬁcient and the fraction of bidirectional edges
(cycles with only two nodes). For very low values of 05, the simulated
network is practically an ERN, while for very high values of 05, it is
a set of cliques.4 The choice of the oz—value at the transitions between
the two regimes suggests that the nematode may ‘attempt’ to produce
a local structure, while maintaining an almost full connectivity.

This model can actually be used as a more natural way to obtain a
small world network than starting with an artiﬁcial rigid lattice and
transforming it into an ERN. Here the high clustering coefﬁcient
is obtained since nearby nodes have a high probability of being
connected and thus small cliques are created.

The above—mentioned network measures are macroscopic features
of the network. A more microscopic picture can be obtained by
looking at the small scale motif distribution. The 3—motif distribution
of the observed CE NN, the LS and an ERN was compared. As
previously reported (Milo et al., 2002), the CE NN has a non—
random motif distribution. Indeed, for all 3—motifs a statistically
signiﬁcant difference is found between the CE NN and a scrambled
version of the CE NN (Supplementary Table S 1). The CE NN is also
very different from the ERN (Supplementary Table S1). However,
the CE NN and the LS demonstrate a very similar behavior for all
motifs, with the exception of the three nodes simple directed circle
motif (motif number 9). This motif appears half as often as expected
in the CE NN, while in the simulated network it appears twice as
often. This motif is simply a coherent 3 nodes circle. The speciﬁc
difference in a single motif hints that directed circles are selected
against. In order to systematically test this possibility, we developed
a new measure—the minimal circle length distribution. A minimal
circle is deﬁned as a closed couple of shortest paths between two
neighbors. Such circles in general tend to be short, since large circles
containing a short circle are ignored (Supplementary Fig. S1). The
circle distribution of the CE NN has a long tale with a maximal
length of 11 neurons, and many 8—11 neuron long circles (25% of the
circles). This is in contrast with an average circle length of <3 in the
ERN (Fig. 4). It is also much longer than predicted by the LS. These
differences suggest a functional mechanism limiting directed short
circles. Such a mechanism is expected if neural networks require
long circles of information ﬂow.

To further validate this conclusion, we changed our model to
mimic destruction of synapses participating in three and four node
circles. First, 500 extra edges were added to the network. These
edges were then removed selectively from 3 and 4 node circles.
We denote this model as LS1. In LS1 the main features of the
network did not change signiﬁcantly (Supplementary Table S2). The
motif frequency now fully ﬁts the observed CE NN, and the number
of circles of length 2 to 5 is similar to the real CE NN (Fig. 4,
Supplementary Table S3).

One can thus summarize that the CE NN network structure shows
that the CE NN can be formed using a simple spatial stochastic model
accompanied by a mechanism limiting short circles of information
ﬂow.

The negative selection of short circles explains part of the increase
in the long circle number, but not all of it. The discrepancy in the long

Renyi networks (light gray), average of 50 LS network simulations (dashed
gray line) and average of 50 the additional simulation (LSl—dashed black
line). One can clearly see that LS a large number of short circles and the
observed CE NN (black line) has fewer short circles and many more long
circles than expected. The LSl is a spatial simulation in which we remove
some of the edges participating in short circles. In such a model the number
of short circle (2—5) is much closer to the real CE NN.

circle number between the simulation and the CE NN may further be
explained by a positive selection of long circles. We checked for a
speciﬁc selection of long circles through the experimental positions
of the neurons in the CE NN (Chen et al., 2006) and the ganglion to
which they belong. The Euclidian length (the sum of the distances
between the centers of the soma) of experimentally measured circles
with a large number of edges is much longer in reality than expected
from the simulation. Moreover, all nodes in long circles belong to
the same ganglia and form pre—deﬁned consistent physical pathways.
One can thus conclude that in contrast to all other features studied
here, the long circles are a hard coded feature of the CE NN.

4 DISCUSSION

The CE NN is currently the only fully mapped network. Beyond its
obvious physical parameters (size, number of neurons, number of
synapses and the physical position of the neurons), it has several
well—deﬁned properties, such as its peculiar degree distribution,
clustering coefﬁcient, centrality and shortest distance and circle
distribution. This fully mapped network allows us to test if the
network structure is predetermined and rigid, or is based on a simple
stochastic process. We have tested the simplest stochastic process
where the probability of creating a synapse decreases geometrically
with the physical distance. This model contains a single parameter
and can explain the vast majority of the network properties. The
main difference between the proposed model and the experimentally
measured CE NN is the low number of coherent circles in the
observed network. This may be due to a secondary process that limits
useless very short information cycles and increasing the number
and length of long circles. Such an inhibitory process is reasonable,
taking into account that most axon guidance and neural adhesion

genes are inhibitory. Thus, the network generation is a mixture of
spatial and functional limitations. The proposed model suggests that
the network properties can be explained by the need to maintain
global connectivity and a local structure. Such a balance leads to
the creation of local nerve rings with a high internal clustering on
the one hand and the creation of long range axons on the other
hand. At the mathematical level, these two requirements limit the
values of O! to a very narrow range and explain most of the network
properties.

A complementary view of neural networks is that the neurons
positions have evolved over long periods to minimize the wiring
length. Neuron positions may have evolved to optimize some
functionality, for example, through the aggregation of neurons in
rings. However, the observed minimal wiring length cannot serve
as a proof for such a mechanism. The proper positioning of neurons
based on their wiring properties can be an artifact of the network
generation mechanism. We have applied an optimal wiring algorithm
(Chen et al., 2006) to the network produced by the simulation and
obtained a average error of 0. 17 :l: 0.03 in the node positions (random
positions would give 0.35 :l:0.01). A similar error was obtained
when the CE NN was used. The analysis was performed assuming
a single synapse between each pair of connected neurons.

While the nematode’s NN is much simpler than that of primates
and advanced vertebrates, its generation rule may hint to the way
much more complex networks are generated. One may extrapolate
from these results two basic building elements: (i) a local stochastic
creation mechanism combined with functional limitations on short
coherent circles, (ii) local structure and long range connectivity need
to be maintained. Such a model can be the prototype for the way the
structure of large complex networks can be theoretically coded by
a very small number of genes.

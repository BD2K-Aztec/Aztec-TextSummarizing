ABSTRACT

Motivation: Functional linkages implicate pairwise relationships
between proteins that work together to implement biological tasks.
During evolution, functionally linked proteins are likely to be
preserved or eliminated across a range of genomes in a correlated
fashion. Based on this hypothesis, phylogenetic profiling-based
approaches try to detect pairs of protein families that show similar
evolutionary patterns. Traditionally, the evolutionary pattern of a
protein is encoded by either a binary profile of presence and absence
of this protein across species or an occurrence profile that indicates
the distribution of copies of this protein across species.

Results: In our study, we characterize each protein by its enhanced
phylogenetic tree, a novel graphical model of the evolution of a
protein family with explicitly marked by speciation and duplication
events. By topological comparison between enhanced phylogenetic
trees, we are able to detect the functionally associated protein pairs.
Because the enhanced phylogenetic trees contain more evolutionary
information of proteins, our method shows greater performance
and discovers functional linkages among proteins more reliably
compared with the conventional approaches.

1 INTRODUCTION

A great number of cellular behaviors are mediated by proteins,
which always carry out their functions by interacting with each
other (Eisenberg et al., 2000). Proteins that participate in a common
structural complex or pathway or biological process are deﬁned
as functionally linked. Deﬁning functional linkages of proteins
is one of the central goals in proteomics that will decipher the
molecular mechanisms underlying the biological functions and,
then, help to enhance approaches for drug discovery. The complete
sequencing of multiple genomes from diverse species provides
an excellent opportunity to develop comparative approaches
for functional studies in proteomics. Biological interactions and
functional linkages of proteins can be inferred via various patterns
across many genomes. These include the co—localization of genes
on chromosomes (Dandekar et al., 1998; Overbeek et al., 1999), the
genetical fusion of two distinct proteins from one organism into a

single protein in another organism (Enright et al., 1999; Marcotte
et al., 1999), protein domain composition (Sprinzak and Margalit,
2001; Ta and Holm, 2009) and phylogenetic proﬁles (Dutkowski
and Tiuryn, 2009; Marcotte et al., 2000; Pellegrini et al., 1999; Wu
et al., 2003).

Phylogeny—based methods for protein functional relationship
prediction are broadly applicable due to a sufﬁciently large number
of completely sequenced genomes. These methods are premised
on the hypothesis that functionally linked proteins evolve in a
correlated fashion, and therefore they have homologs in the same
set of organisms (Pellegrini et al., 1999). The original approach
uses the simplest form of phylogenetic proﬁle of a protein, a binary
string in which each bit indicates the presence or absence of a
protein family in a different species (Pellegrini et al., 1999). This
basic method, often referred to ‘phylogenetic binary proﬁling’,
subsequently searches for matching pairs of proﬁles which differ
from each other by less than three bits. In further steps, proﬁles
can be compared by statistical correlation measures, such as co—
occurrence probability (Wu et al., 2003), the Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient (Glazko and Mushegian, 2004), Fisher’s exact test
(Barker and Page], 2005) or mutual information (Date and Marcotte,
2003; Huynen et al., 2000).

Recently, Ranea et al. (2007) introduced phylogenetic occurrence
proﬁling to detect the functionally related protein families in
eukaryotic genomes. The phylogenetic occurrence proﬁle of a
protein family is a vector in which each element indicates the number
of protein members of this family observed in one organism. Unlike
prokaryotic genomes, where a high proportion of protein families
have about one copy per species, eukaryotic genomes show a large
number of multiprotein families having more than one member
per species (Ranea et al., 2007). Phylogenetic occurrence proﬁling,
therefore, is able to detect more evolutionary signals that could not
be detected by phylogenetic binary proﬁling.

However, binary and occurrence proﬁles cannot adequately
describe the whole evolutionary history of proteins. Many methods
characterize proteins by their reconstructed phylogenetic trees.
These approaches, then, compare the phylogenetic trees by utilizing
the parsimony principle (Barker et al., 2007), maximum likelihood
model (Barker and Page], 2005), a tree—kernel model (Vert, 2002)
or the correlation between the distances matrices used to build the
trees (Pazos and Valencia, 2001).

Evolutionary divergence, convergence and horizontal transfer
events in multiprotein families are more complex than can be
described by conventional phylogenetic proﬁles. In this work, we
introduce a novel graphical model of the evolution of proteins,
which enhances the information content of phylogenetic proﬁles

Assigning functional linkages to proteins using EPT

 

by accounting for the reconstructed proteomes of ancestral species
and synchronous gene duplication events. While orthologs evolved
by vertical descent (speciation) from a single protein in the last
common ancestor of the compared genomes, paralogs evolved by
gene duplication. In this work, one—to—one correspondences between
orthologs are detected using the reciprocal best hits criterion, and
duplications are identiﬁed using the InParanoid criterion (O’Brien
et al., 2005). This so—called enhanced phylogenetic tree (EPT)
explicitly traces all the descendants of proteins from the last
universal common ancestor (LUCA) down to the extant species.
This tree is different from the tree reconciliation (Zmasek and
Eddy, 2002) in that protein data are directly ﬁtter on the species
tree, and speciation or duplication events are inferred using an
exclusion principle to ensure strict one—to—one correspondences
between proteins derived by speciation. The EPTs, subsequently,
are topologically compared to ﬁnd the evolutionarily correlated
proteins families. Two proteins of a target organism belonging to
two correlated families are likely to be functionally linked.

In this article, we benchmark the EPT method by using positive
and negative reference sets of functional linkages in Homo sapiens
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The biological features of the
predicted functional linkages are examined by studying GO
annotations in the biological process, cellular component and
molecular function branches of Gene Ontology. Our novel method
shows a signiﬁcant improvement compared with conventional
phylogenetic proﬁling methods and makes predictions that are
complementary to other prediction methods.

2 METHODS
2.1 Benchmark datasets

Benchmark sets including positive and negative reference sets (PRS
and NRS, respectively) are needed to calculate the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC), which represents the performance of a classiﬁcation
method. By true positive (TP), we mean an interaction or linkage that is
predicted by our method and present in the PRS. Analogously, a true negative
(TN) is a pair of proteins predicted by our method not to interact that is
present in the NRS. A false positive (FP) is a protein pair in the NRS that is
predicted to interact by our method while a false negative (FN) is a protein
pair in the PRS predicted not to interact by our method. In the plot of the
ROC curve, the x—axis represents false positive rate (FPR) or 1—speciﬁcity,
that is FP/(TN+FP), and the y—axis represents true positive rate (TPR) or
sensitivity, TP/(TP+ FN), as the threshold gradually varies.

To evaluate the performance of our methods at predicting protein
functional linkages, we choose the pairs of proteins existing within the same
complex as referent positives and the random pairs of proteins from different
complexes, which are not connected in the interaction graph, as referent
negatives. For yeast datasets, 5888 pairs of co—complex proteins and 5888
randomly chosen pairs were derived from the manually curated catalog in
MIPS (Mewes et al., 2004).

The benchmark datasets of human functional linkages are derived from
the CORUM database, a resource of manually annotated protein complexes
from mammalian organisms (Ruepp et al., 2010). After ﬁltering out co—
complex protein pairs discovered by hi gh—throu ghput experimental methods,
we obtained 26 813 pairs of protein for the human PRS. The human NRS
contains 26 813 pairs of proteins chosen randomly from different complexes.

2.2 Protein families

Phylogenetic proﬁling requires that proteins from different organisms are
classiﬁed into families, which can be compared across species. We clustered

the proteins in the proteomes of 572 complete genomes (560 prokaryotic and
12 eukaryotic organisms) based on their Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST) similarity. This study considered similarities above a bitscore of 50,
which effectively ﬁlters FP hits from the sequence comparison (Remm et al.,
2001). We tested both lower and higher thresholds, which yielded worse
performance in the benchmark. The clusters have an internal hierarchical
structure that guarantees strict one—to—one correspondences between proteins
from different species in each subfamily. The clustering algorithm is a
hierarchical modiﬁcation of the InParanoid algorithm (Remm et 01., 2001).
The inputs are the species tree and the protein sequences of a set of organism.
The algorithm outputs proteins classiﬁed into families with gene duplication
events mapped to taxa in the species tree. The details of the clustering
algorithm are shown in Figure 1.

There were 2 188 588 proteins in the proteomes. Of total, 254418
singletons (about 11.6%) had no similarity to other proteins. The other
proteins were clustered into 91428 protein families (EPTs) having more
than one member. The average number of leaf proteins in an EPT was 21.2
approximately. The distribution of EPT size is scale free, i.e. it follows a
power law.

2.3 Enhanced phylogenetic trees

The strength of functional linkage between two protein families is assessed
by comparing the topologies of the corresponding EPTs.

Figure 2 shows two examples of EPT, tree A and tree B. In tree A,
four round—dot lines represent the proteomes of four organisms. Tree A
(B) has four (two) subtrees f1 , f2, f3 , f4 (fl/jg), forming in three (two) layers.
Each subtree, representing a subfamily, is composed of the identical leaves,
internal node and solid edges (speciation). They are separated by dashed
edges (duplication). The corresponding occurrence and binary proﬁles of the
family are shown below. Intuitively, the EPT contains more evolutionary
signals than conventional proﬁling. The NCBI taxonomy tree is used in
constructing EPTs. In a subtree, the dashed edges (empty nodes) indicate the
edges (nodes) of the NCBI taxonomy tree that do not exist in the subtree.
In tree A, the ﬁrst layer contains the subtree f1, the second layer contains f2
and f3, and the third layer contains f4.

2.4 Subtree similarity

The topological similarity of two subtrees is computed guided by the NCBI
taxonomy tree, meaning that the comparison is based on the taxonomy
identiﬁers of nodes in two subtrees (see Fig. 3). Let T? be a part of subtree
A that roots from node i and C(i,A) denote the set of children of node i in
subtree A. The similarity of two subtrees A and B rooting from node i, which
is denoted by S(Tlf“, TiB) , can be calculated as follows
S(T{‘,T}9)=a+ Z S(T,§‘,T,§)—
keC(i,A)ﬂC(i,B)

ﬁl(C(ivA)_C(ivB))ﬂ(C(ivB)_C(ivA))l (1)

where X —Y denotes the set of objects that belong to X and not to Y,
X DY denotes the set of objects that belong to both set X and set Y and |X|
means the number of elements in set X. In Equation ( 1), 05(0) is the reward
(penalty) coefﬁcient. From Equation ( 1), we have S(Tlf“, T15): —ﬁ if j #i or
one of two trees is null. In words, each common node yields a reward oz and
each deletion of a subtree costs a penalty 0. In the current implementation,
we require that two subtrees have the same root node identiﬁers, that is, only
subtrees that were created by gene duplications at the same taxonomic node
contribute to the EPT score (the tree in the ﬁrst layer is always rooted at
LUCA).

2.5 Measuring the similarity of enhanced phylogenetic
trees

Two EPTs are compared layer—by—layer (see an example in Fig. 2). Let T 31k be
subtree k in the i—th layer of EPT A whose root taxonomy identiﬁer is j.

Fig. 1. Schematic example to show how the family deﬁnition algorithm
works. Phase I : the proteomes of ancestral species are reconstructed
hierarchically based on the species tree. Here, species ABC is reconstructed
from child species A, B and C. Proteins are clustered based on all versus
all Blast hits between the child species. The list of Blast hits is sorted by
similarity score in decreasing order. Initially, each child protein has an image
in the ancestor but the actual parent is yet unassigned. Child proteins that
derive from the same ancestral protein are identiﬁed based on Blast hits with
the highest similarity score. Only one protein from each child species may
be assigned to the same ancestral protein. Recent duplications (generating
in—paralogs within a child species) have higher similarity scores than BLAST
hits to a sister species. Singleton proteins have no similarity to sister species;
they are assumed to be present in the ancestor. Finally, the algorithm removes
image nodes from the ancestor which are without progeny. Phase II : here, the
root node (LUCA) is reconstructed from ABC and D. The similarity scores
from reconstructed proteins are estimated as the maximum of the similarities
of the cluster members; for example, ABC2—D1 is the maximum of A1—D1,
B 1—D1 and C1—D1. The ﬁnal assignments after the reconstruction are shown.
Following the edges from the leaf proteins to reconstructed LUCA proteins
gives the protein families and lineages shown in Outputs.

2.6 Predicting functional linkages of proteins

A protein is characterized by the EPT of the family to which it belongs. Two
similar EPTs mean correlated patterns of evolution and, by implication, a
functional linkage. We construct EPTs for all the families that contain more
than one member and at least one of the members is a protein of the target
organism. Two proteins whose EPTs have a higher similarity score than a
given threshold are classiﬁed as functionally linked or physically interacting
proteins.

2.7 Calculating GO semantic similarity

To investigate the biological features of predicted functionally linked protein
pairs, we quantify the functional similarity for these pairs by computing the
semantic similarity (SS) score (Wang et al., 2007) of the GO terms with which
these proteins are annotated. The semantic score takes into account both the
level of hierarchy of GO terms and also their relations with their ancestor
terms. All predicted protein pairs are assigned semantic similarity scores for
three GO branches: molecular function (MF); biological process (BP) and
cellular component (CC). Semantic scores in this study were calculated using
GOSemSim package in Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004).

Functional linkages are predicted among all the proteins in yeast and
human proteomes by all the competing methods (binary proﬁles, occurrence
proﬁles and EPT). The mean GO semantic score is calculated over all the
protein pairs in the top predictions to present the biological features of the
predicted pairs. The method that shows higher mean GO—SS at the same
number of top predictions has stronger biological implications.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Evaluation of performance of the EPT method at
predicting functional linkages

Benchmark datasets are tested by the enhanced phylogenetic
tree method. We compare our method with the conventional
methods using binary proﬁle with Pearson correlation (Glazko and
Mushegian, 2004) (called bin_ps) and occurrence proﬁle (Ranea
et al., 2007) with Pearson correlation (called occ_ps) or Euclidean
distance (called occ_ed) (see Supplementary Material). The binary
and occurrence proﬁles are converted from the corresponding EPTs
as described in Figure 2A. Figure 4 shows the assessment of the EPT
method for different test sets including human (see Fig. 4A) and
yeast (see Fig. 4B) PRS and NRS of functional linkages. It is clear
that the EPT method can capture part of the co—evolutionary signal
of protein functional linkages. In particular, by using a threshold
of 0.245 (0.546), the EPT method discovers about 20% (27%)
functional linkages in human (yeast) datasets with a low level of
FPR (around 5%) (see Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S2). For the
top 1000 predictions, we obtained a precision of more than 90%
both in the human and in the yeast datasets (see Insets in Fig. 4).
The EPT method shows a drastic improvement compared with
traditional approaches using binary or occurrence proﬁles. In the
top 1000 predictions of human datasets, the EPT method shows a
precision of more than 90% while others show precisions less than
70%. For yeast datasets, the precision of the EPT method is about
90% while those of other methods are about 60%. The advance of
the EPT method seems to be a direct consequence of using the EPT
as an evolutionary pattern. It is clear that the similarity between two

precisions of the methods at different number of top predictions (cases with
highest scores) for human and yeast datasets, respectively. The precision is
the ratio of the number of true positives over the number of top predictions,
TP/(TP + FP).

EPTs reﬂects the co—evolution of the pair of proteins belonging to
these EPTs.

Clearly, the EPT method helps to reduce FPs by other methods
using binary and occurrence proﬁles (see Supplementary Fig. S3).
In the top 1000 human predictions by the bin_ps method, there are
343 FPs (> 34%). The number of FPs in the top 1000 predictions by
the occ_ed and occ_ps methods are 289 (N 29%) and 378 (N 38%),
respectively. Nearly the FPs by the traditional methods are out of
the top 1000 predictions by the EPT method, meaning that they are
likely identiﬁed as TNs by the EPT methods. For yeast datasets, most
of the FPs in the top 1000 predictions by the traditional methods are
also identiﬁed as TNs by the EPT method. Namely, the EPT method
ranks 404 among 418 FPs (N 97%) by the bin_ s method out of
the top 1000 predictions. Our method also identiﬁed 420 /425 FPs
(259/274 FPs ) by the occ_ed (occ_ps) method as TNs.

Two examples of potential FPs by the traditional methods
that are identiﬁed as TNs by the EPT methods are presented in
Figure 5A for human datasets and Figure 5B for yeast datasets.
The upper and lower panels of Figure 5A, respectively, show
the EPTs, occurrence and binary proﬁles of negative elongation
factor A protein (Q9H3P2, NELFA_HUMAN) and syntaxin—12
protein (Q86Y82, STX12_HUMAN), which belong to different
complexes (Ruepp et al., 2010). They seem to participate in different
biological processes, implement different molecular functions and
locate in different cellular components (Ashburner et al., 2000).
iHOP shows no evidence for functional associations or physical
interactions between these two proteins (Hoffmann and Valencia,
2004). NELFA_HUMAN and STX12_HUMAN share the identical
binary proﬁles and very similar occurrence proﬁles, making them
to be in the top predictions by traditional methods. However,
their EPTs are topologically different. There are about 55% of
all the protein pairs that have higher EPT scores than this pair
does, meaning that NELFA_HUMAN and STX12_HUMAN are
identiﬁed as unlikely to be functionally linked by the EPT method.
Figure 5B shows a protein pair, N—terminal acetyltransferase A
complex subunit protein (P12945, NAT1_YEAST) and Alpha—
soluble NSF attachment protein (P32602, SEC 17_YEAST), in yeast
that is a TN by the EPT method but a FP by traditional methods using
binary and occurrence proﬁles. These above examples indicate that

the use of EPTs provides a signiﬁcant increase of the precision and
sensitivity for co—evolution signal detection.

3.2 Biological feature of predicted protein functional
linkages

The relationship between the prediction methods and GO attributes
(Ashburner et al., 2000) is shown in Figure 6. For BP and CC,
the average GO semantic score (GO—SS) of the top predictions by
the EPT method is higher than that of the top predictions by other
methods (see Fig. 6B and C for yeast and Fig. 6E and F for human),
indicating that the EPT method is able to ﬁnd functional linkages
among proteins that participate in the same biological processes or
locate in the same cellular components. Figure 6A and D show that
the linkages predicted by the EPT method exist between proteins that
do not perform the same molecular functions. This is as expected
because typically a set of different biochemical activities (molecular
functions) are required to implement biological processes.

3.3 Examples of predicted functional linkages—linking
cancer to DNA repair complexes

Supplementary Table S1 and S2 show several pairs of proteins that
participate in the same biological process in yeast and human. These
pairs have very high EPT scores so they are predicted as likely
functional linkages by the EPT methods. A number of these predicted
linkages are conﬁrmed by experimental assays. The others can be
considered as ‘novel’ linkages, which might be candidates for further
experimental validation.

An interesting example of yeast functional linkages predicted
by the EPT method is the linkage between the large (alpha) and
small (beta) subunits of yeast phenylalanyl—tRNA synthetase (Genes
FRSl and FRS2, Uniprot accession numbers P15625 and P15624 ,
respectively). The association among these two proteins has been

found by many experimental assays using Afﬁnity Capture—MS
methods (Collins et al., 2007; Gavin et al., 2002, 2006; Krogan
et al., 2006; Snitkin et al., 2006). Among 6931774 yeast scored
protein pairs, the EPT method ranks the pair of P15625 and P15624
as the 13th, indicating that this pair is likely identiﬁed as a TP by the
EPT method. However, this pair is out of top 100 000 predictions by
any conventional methods using either occurrence or binary proﬁles
(top 7% for occ_ed, top 32% for occ_ps and top 50% for bin_ps),
meaning that this protein pair is potentially identiﬁed as a FN.

As an example of human predicted functional linkages by the EPT
method, we predict several interaction partners for DNA—directed
polymerase theta (POLQ, Uniprot accession number Q59EE4).

Assigning functional linkages to proteins using EPT

 

The predicted interaction partners of POLQ include proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, P12004), replication factor C (RFC4,
P35249) and structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 1A
(SMC1A, Q14683). Among more than 109 scored pairs of human
proteins, the pair POLQ—PCNA is ranked 403rd. These two proteins
are both mapped to DNA replication process. There has not been
any direct evidence by experimental assays on the relationship
between proliferating cell nuclear antigen and polymerase (DNA
directed) theta protein. However, there exist associations between
PCNA and other DNA polymerases, namely DNA polymerase
kappa protein (Haracska et al., 2002; Maga et al., 2002; Shimazaki
et al., 2002), polymerase (DNA directed) delta protein Ducoux
et al. (2001); Liu et al. (2003); Ohta et al. (2002); Pohler et al.
(2005) and DNA polymerase eta protein (POLH, Q9Y253). POLH
is speciﬁcally involved in DNA repair. DNA polymerase kappa
and delta require activator 1 (alias RFC1—5) in addition to PCNA.
The association between POLQ and PCNA is a very promising
target for experimental validation. The second of POLQ’s predicted
interaction partners, RFC4, is part of activator complex 1 (composed
of RFC1—5), which is known to bind to PCNA (Cai et al., 1997;
Ohta et al., 2002). The third predicted interaction partner, SMC1A,
is linked to disease. SMClA is a central component of the cohesin
complex, which apparently forms a large proteinaceous ring within
which sister chromatids can be trapped after DNA replication. The
cohesin complex interacts with a number of other proteins, including
breast cancer associated BRCAl. Defects in SMClA are the cause
of Cornelia de Lange syndrome type 2 (CDLS2)[MIM:300590];
also known as Cornelia de Lange syndrome X—linked. CDLS is
a clinically heterogeneous developmental disorder associated with
malformations affecting multiple body parts. Mutated Cornelia
de Lange cell lines display genomic instability and sensitivity to
ionizing radiation and interstrand cross—linking agents (preiler
et al., 2004). Now that is an interesting piece of information, because
POLQ has been implicated in the repair of interstrand cross—links
(preiler et al., 2004). So we hypothesize that SMClA mutations
manifest a radiation sensitive phenotype because of a disrupted
physical association of the cohesin complex with POLQ.

4 CONCLUSIONS

All the phylogeny—based methods for predicting functional protein
linkages are based on the common observation of the similarity
between evolutionary patterns of interacting proteins. Therefore,
the performance of these methods strongly depends on how the
evolutionary patterns of proteins are described.

In prokaryotes, protein families typically contain one copy per
species (Ranea et al., 2007). This facilitates the prediction of
functional linkages of protein using binary proﬁles. However, binary
phylogenetic proﬁles are not evolutionarily informative enough for
protein families in eukaryotic genomes, many of which contain more
protein homologs per species. Occurrence proﬁles partly overcome
the problem with multiprotein families in eukaryotes by counting
the number of protein copies per species. Enhanced phylogenetic
trees, which are graphical models of the evolution of proteins by
speciation and duplication events, add richer information about the
evolutionary history of proteins and help to overcome the problems
which the conventional proﬁles encounter.

The EPT algorithm creates groups of proteins using the reciprocal
best BLAST criterion that is commonly used to detect orthologs.

The orthodox way to deﬁne orthologs is a subject of hot debate
(Koonin, 2001; Ouzounis, 1999); we note that any protein family
classiﬁcation can be used for phylogenetic proﬁling and perfect
recognition of orthologs is not necessary for our prediction purposes.

The current EPT method produces a simple clustering of proteins
based on BLAST scores. The method can be improved in a
number of ways to take into account the complexity of evolutionary
relations including divergence, convergence, domain recombination
and horizontal gene transfer events. For example, the choice of the
descendant protein is somewhat arbitrary as BLAST scores do not
reﬂect the complexity of these relations. We are going to address
this problem in the future by using synteny information for complete
genomes to maximize the number of syntenic protein pairs within
layers of an EPT. Protein sequence proﬁles [e.g. HMMER (Eddy,
1998)] would be better representatives of the ancestral sequences
than a single representative as in the current version. The present
version of the method only models gene loss whereas inferring
de novo creation or horizontal gene transfer requires post—processing
of the trees. The EPT algorithm was designed so that singletons, as
any other protein, are propagated to ancestral species for possible
merging with clusters coming from other lineages. We deﬁne the
ancestral taxon of an EPT as the smallest taxonomic node that
encompasses all non—zero instances of the leaf proteins. In the future,
we will test setting nodes to zero above the ancestral taxon, as well as
modelling possible horizontal gene transfer events (which generate
more than one origins of extant protein groups in the EPT).

Like other phylogeny—based methods, enhanced phylogenetic tree
method is limited at inferring physical interactions of proteins but
is promising at predicting functionally linked proteins. Functionally
linked proteins were benchmarked against GO semantic similarity.
Unlike domain—based approaches where domains, e. g. binding
domains, are believed to perform the same molecular function but
may occur in proteins that participate in very different biological
processes, the thinking behind such a per—protein model as the EPT is
that orthologs will be performing the same biological process across
species. There are tools available which combine evidence—often
weak and always noisy—from many different types of experimental
and computational data to make integrated predictions of functional
linkages (e. g. String, FunCoup). Examination of our top predictions
indicated that they were often complementary to these existing tools,
but had strong evidence from the co—expression data. We believe that
the EPT method would be a valuable, orthogonal addition to such
integrative tools. Our method signiﬁcantly surpasses conventional
methods in prediction performance and potentially discovers more
reliable functional linkages.

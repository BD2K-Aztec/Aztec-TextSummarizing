ABSTRACT

Motivation: Trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs) play an
essential role in the regulation of plant gene expression, but relevant
reports are still limited. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that many
ta-siRNA-producing loci (TASS) are present in plants, implying the
existence of as yet undiscovered ta-siRNAs and related regulatory
pathways. To expand our knowledge of these plant gene regulators,
we applied high-throughput computational and experimental methods
to grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.).

Results: Based on bioinformatic predictions, we identified 49 TASs
from 49055 small RNA clusters. Using RNA degradome analysis,
we experimentally validated 5 TASs, 22 ta-siRNAs and 37 ta—siRNA
targets. The cis-activities of ta—siRNAs were also confirmed, which
suggested an inactive mechanism of TAS transcription, and a pro-
duced mechanism of multiple forms of small RNA from same TAS.
We examined the conservation of newly identified ta-siRNA regulatory
cascades and found that while the cascade related to vviTAS3 was
conserved, cascades related to vviTAS7, vviTASB, vviTASQ and
vviTAS10 were grape-specific. These results broaden the known
scope of ta—siRNA regulation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Endogenous small RNAs (sRNAs) are key post-transcriptional
and transcriptional regulators of plant gene expression (Molnar
et al., 2007). They include microRNAs (miRNAs), heterochro-
matic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), natural antisense
siRNAs (nat-siRNAs) and trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs).
miRNAs, which are generated by cleavage of single-stranded
RNA stem—loop structures by DICER—Like 1, play pivotal roles
in development and stress responses by targeting the transcripts of
transcription factors that mediate the transition between various
developmental stages or regulate responses to biotic or abiotic
stimulation (Meng et al., 2011). Heterochromatic siRNAs trigger
DNA methylation and histone modiﬁcation and are involved

in heterochromatin formation of repeated genomic regions and
the silencing of other genomic regions, including the control of
transposon movement (Katiyar-Agarwal and Jin, 2010). nat-
siRNAs consist of two types of siRNAs, i.e. 24-nt nat-siRNAs
and 21-nt nat-siRNAs (Urano et al., 2010). They are processed
from pairs of natural cis—antisense transcripts by cleavage with
DICER-Like 2 and DICER-Like 1, respectively. The 24-nt nat-
siRNAs play a key role in environmental stress response and in
reproduction by targeting unlinked transcripts and guiding cleav-
age to produce 2l-nt nat—siRNAs whose function is still not clear.

ta-siRNAs play an essential role in regulating plant develop-
ment, metabolism and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses
(Chen et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2011). They are produced from
ta-siRNA-producing locus (TAS) genes (Allen et al., 2005). A
single-stranded RNA is first transcribed from a ta-siRNA locus
and then cleaved by a phase initiator (a miRNA or, in some
cases, a ta-siRNA). RDR6-dependent conversion of the resulting
fragments into double-stranded RNA, and subsequent cleavage
by DICER-Like 4, generates 2l-nt phased ta-siRNAs. These
ta-siRNAs then combine with argonaute proteins to form
RISC complexes and cleave targeted mRNAs.

To date, several “miRNA —> ta-siRNA —> target gene’ cleavage
cascades have been identiﬁed as important elements of gene regu-
latory networks. TASla, TASlb, TASlc and TAS2 are four
ta-siRNA loci targeted by miRl73, and their 3’-cleavage prod-
ucts produce six ta-siRNAs that target at least two transcripts
with unknown function and two transcripts of pentatricopeptide
repeat genes (Allen et al., 2005). TAS3, another ta-siRNA locus,
is targeted by miRNA390. Its 5’-cleavage product produces two
ta-siRNAs that target transcripts of auxin response factors
ARF2, ARF3 and ARF4. A fourth ta-siRNA locus, TAS4, is
targeted by miRNA828 (Rajagopalan et al., 2006). Its 3’-cleavage
product produces one ta-siRNA that targets three MYB gene
transcripts. Another TAS gene, also named TAS4, has been
identiﬁed in moss. It produces ta-siRNAs targeting a putative
transcription factor similar to AP2/EREBP, suggesting a func-
tion in plant development (Talmor-Neiman et al., 2006).

It has been reported that ta-siRNAs from TAS3 regulate leaf
morphology and juvenile-to-adult vegetative-stage transitions;
ta-siRNAs from TAS4 regulate anthocyanin, ﬂavonoid and
phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and may also be involved in reg-
ulating leaf senescence (Allen et al., 2005; Hsieh et al., 2009; Luo
et al., 2012). Computational analysis indicates that many TASs

exist in plants (Chen et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2006), suggesting they
may play a more fundamental role than currently understood.
Identiﬁcation and functional characterization of new ta—siRNAs
is therefore needed. Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is a model
system for studying fruit-bearing agricultural crop plants and,
based on fruit consumption and wine yield, is also of great eco-
nomic importance (Jaillon et al., 2007). Many biological pro-
cesses, including those involving ta—siRNAs generated from
TAS3 and TAS4, greatly affect grape yield and quality. The
identiﬁcation of grapevine ta—siRNAs and their regulatory cas-
cades is thus important in efforts to improve grape cultivation
and breeding. Recent publication of deep sequencing sRNA
libraries, especially a degradome library generated from cleaved
mRNA fragments, opens the door to the identiﬁcation of grape-
vine ta—siRNAs and their cascades (Pantaleo et al., 2010; Wang
et al., 2011).

2 METHODS

2.1 Sources of sRNA libraries

In this study, we used a total of 35 sRNA datasets, which included a
degradome library and 34 sRNA libraries. The degradome library was
used for evaluating cleaved positions of phase initiators and ta—siRNAs,
while the 34 sRNA libraries were used to ascertain their conservation.
For various reasons, such as the speciﬁc plant tissue, mutant line or
sequencing technology used, a given sRNA might be absent from a par-
ticular library; consequently, we used as many different sRNA libraries as
possible to minimize the chance of incorrectly concluding an absent
sRNA was not conserved in a given species. All datasets were down-
loaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, see text for GEO
accession numbers) except for three obtained from the Tomato
Functional Genomics Database. The genomic sequence and annotation
for grapevine were downloaded from NCBI (National Center for
Biotechnology Information, updated April 7, 2009).

2.2 Identiﬁcation of sRNA clusters

A genomic region was considered to be an sRNA cluster when it con-
tained at least three sRNA hits with a maximum separation distance of
100 nt (Johnson et al., 2009). Each sRNA cluster was classiﬁed according
to the sRNA length that was most predominant. In other words, if at
least 50% of the sRNAs were 21 nt long, it was categorized as a 2l-nt
cluster, and similarly, if at least 50% were 24 nt long, it was grouped as a
24-nt cluster. If neither 21- nor 24-nt sRNAs represented at least 50% of
the identiﬁed sRNAs, the cluster was classiﬁed differently.

BLASTn from the NCBI standalone BLAST (Basic Local Alignment
Search Tool) package was used to search for sRNA hits in the grapevine
genomic sequence. Parameters were set to standard settings with no ﬁl-
tering, and a perfect match was required.

2.3 Identiﬁcation of grapevine TASs and their phase
initiators

To identify TAS loci, we modiﬁed and used a method based on
Chen et al. (2007) and Dai and Zhao (2008). First, assuming that
each 5’ -end of an sRNA in an sRNA cluster was the cleavage start
site, the number of phased/non-phased positions was counted on either
side of this start position (phased positions refer to those arranged
in 2l-nt increments relative to the cleavage start position; non-phased
positions are all those other than phased positions and the start
position). Second, the P value of each detected conﬁguration was

calculated on the basis of a random hypergeometric distribution
(Zhang et al., 2011) using the following equation:

A _ A _
minakﬁkz), ($24)) L x 2 — 1 — (21 x 2 1) 21 x 2 1
k2 k1

xzkl (L x 2 — 1 > ’
k1 + k2

where L, which should be a multiple of 21, is the length of the detected
conﬁguration, K1 is the number of phased positions having sRNA hits
and K2 is the number of non-phased positions having sRNA hits. Finally,
detected conﬁgurations with P< 0.001, proposed by Chen et al. (2007)
and corresponding to the criterion that a cluster with fewer than two
phased sRNAs was <5 % likely to be determined true in our preliminary
analysis, were identiﬁed as TASS.

For each identiﬁed TAS, belonging to 21-mer clusters, 24—mer clusters
or other clusters, we searched for potential phase initiators in the sRNA
library. First, we retrieved the genomic region containing the TAS and an
additional 100 nt either to its left or right, whichever was on the same side
as the cleavage start position. We then searched for complementary re-
gions between the sRNA and the retrieved genomic sequence using
psRNATarget (Dai and Zhao, 2011) with default parameters. Potential
phase initiators were identiﬁed using the criteria of a 10th sRNA nucleo-
tide position corresponding to the TAS cleavage start position.
Overlapping loci with same phase were combined and the one with the
best P value was chosen as representative. As a ﬁnal step, we validated
the TAS cleavage start position by mapping an RNA degradome with
GEO accession number GSEl8406 to the grapevine genome using
BLASTn with standard settings and no ﬁltering. If the 5’ -end of any
RNA degradome fragment overlapped the TAS cleavage start position,
the start position was considered to be validated.

 

P(k1) =

2.4 Identiﬁcation of ta—siRNA targets

Prediction of ta—siRNA targets was carried out by searching for comple-
mentary regions between ta—siRNA and grapevine transcripts using
BLASTn with standard settings and no ﬁltering, and allowing a max-
imum of four mismatched base pairs. The validation of the ta—siRNA
cleavage site was performed using the RNA degradome, with the require-
ment that it corresponded to ta—siRNA position 10.

2.5 Conservation of TASs, phase initiators and ta—siRNAs
TAS conservation was detected by performing a megablast search against
NCBI standard sets and selected nucleotide (nr/nt) databases. The top
100 hits were used for TAS conservation analysis. Conservation of phase

initiators and ta—siRNAs was ascertained from the number of sequences
in 34 sRNA libraries.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Detection of sRNA clusters

An sRNA cluster is a genomic region mapped by many sRNAs
where potential TASs may be present. In this study, we mapped
an sRNA library from grapevine stems and leaves (GEO acces-
sion number GSM458927) to a grapevine genomic sequence
using BLAST, searched for perfect matches and identiﬁed the
sRNA clusters.

Using the criterion that an sRNA cluster should contain at
least three sRNAs with a maximum separation distance of 100 nt
(Johnson et al., 2009), 49 055 sRNA clusters were identiﬁed
(Table 1). There were 2373 2l-nt clusters primarily made up of
21-nt sRNAs and representing approximately 5% of the total
number, and 25917 24-nt clusters with 24-nt sRNAs in the

majority, which made up about 53% of the total. Cluster size
ranged from 20 to 3070 nt, with an average of 139.4 nt, and the
number of sRNAs in a given cluster ranged from 3 to 417, with
an average of 9.6.

When we counted the number of 21- and 24-nt clusters that
overlapped with annotated gene loci and exons, we found that
42% of the 2l-nt clusters were associated with annotated gene
regions, with 67% of these further associated with exon regions.
For the 24-nt clusters, in contrast, only 16% overlapped with
annotated gene regions, with 9% also overlapping with the
exon regions. The remaining clusters (i.e. all those except the
21- and 24-nt clusters) had a larger gene overlap compared
with the 24-nt clusters, and a smaller gene overlap compared
with 2l-nt clusters. To further examine this phenomenon, we
applied the same method and criteria to sRNA libraries from
grapevine tendrils (GEO accession number GSM458928), inﬁor—
escences (GSM458929) and berries (GSM458930), with similar
outcomes (Table 1). These results indicate that 2l-nt clusters tend
to be biased toward gene loci, especially exon regions, whereas
24-nt clusters are generally absent from those regions.

3.2 Identiﬁcation of grapevine TASs

A strategy for identifying TASs based on the detection of sRNAs
arranged in 21-nt increments and the evaluation of statistical
signiﬁcance (P value) has been proposed by several authors
(Chen et al., 2007; Dai and Zhao, 2008). Using this approach,
three previously known TASs were successfully detected in
Arabidopsis. Although this strategy has proven successful, it is
limited by a 231-bp TAS length requirement. In this article, we
present an improved method allowing for a variable TAS length.

In this study, we used a cutoff of P< 0.001 to predict potential
TASs. We also predicted potential phase initiators, based on an
application of psRNATarget with default parameters and an
assumption that the 10th nucleotide position on the sRNA ser-
ving as the phase initiator corresponds to the cleavage start pos-
ition of its targeted TAS. Using this approach, 49 TASs and their
corresponding phase initiators were identiﬁed (Supplementary

Table 1). Their lengths ranged from 42 to l281bp, with P
values varying from 9.5 x 1041 to 1.2 x 10’“). When we analyzed
whether the TASs are overlapped with coding or non-coding
regions, we found 22 were entirely contained in coding regions,
1 was partly contained and 29 had no overlap with coding
regions, suggesting that TAS distribution was not obviously cor-
related to coding or non-coding regions. Using an RNA degra-
dome dataset (GSE18406) produced from grape leaves and
having a 5’-end that can be used to determine the cleavage site
of long RNAs, including mRNAs and other cDNAs, we subse-
quently conﬁrmed ﬁve vviTASs (Table 2).

Of these ﬁve TASs, vviTAS3 is located in 3’UTR of grapevine
LOC100244732 gene and is similar to the sequence that has
been reported in Arabidopsis (Allen et al., 2005). On vviTAS3,
nine sRNAs were arranged in 2l-nt increments (Fig. 1A) and
62 sRNAs mapped to the middle of the 2l-nt interval
(P=9.18 x 104). When we validated the cleavage sites based
on the RNA degradome library, we found 51 distinct degrad-
ation fragments that mapped to the vviTAS3 transcript and 3
whose 5’-ends overlapped with the phased positions (i.e. pos-
itions arranged in 21-nt increments relative to the cleavage
start position); 48 fragments, representing 42 non-phased pos-
itions, overlapped with non-phased positions (i.e. those other
than phased positions and the start position). A previously re-
ported miRNA, miRNA390, is known to target TAS3 and direct
the production of ta—siRNAs in Arabidopsis (Allen et al., 2005).
We also found this miRNA in the sRNA leaf library, and the
LOC100244732 cleavage start position corresponds to the 10th
nucleotide position of vvimiRNA390. When the vvimiRNA390/
target-transcript pair was compared with that in Arabidopsis,
a completely identical pair was found, showing that the inter-
action of miRNA390 and TAS3 is conserved in both grapevine
and Arabidopsis. Four additional new sRNAs, designated
as vviTAS3-primoRNA2, vviTAS3-primoRNA3, vviTAS3-
primoRNA4 and vviTAS3-primoRNA5 in our study, were also
found. They are complementary to the vvimiRNA390 target site
with no more than two mismatches; their 10th positions overlap
the start position used to determine phased position, indicating
their function as siRNAs. Two distinct degradation fragments
also overlapped on their 5’-ends to the cleavage start position,
validating the cleavage of the phase initiators.

Another TAS, designated as vviTAS7 in this study, was novel.
vviTAS7 has a length of 23lnt and like vviTAS3 was also
located in a genomic repeat region. A total of 75 distinct
sRNAs existed for vviTAS7; 14 were in the 2l-nt increment
phase and 8 phased sRNAs consisted of four pairs of perfect
complementary duplexes (Fig. 1B). The P value for the observed
sRNA arrangement on vviTAS7 was 1.36 x 107. When we vali-
dated the cleaved phase positions of vviTAS7, we found 62 dis-
tinct RNA degradation fragments that mapped to it. Of these,
ﬁve, representing four-phased positions, overlapped on their
5’-ends with the phased positions; 57, representing 45 non-
phased positions, overlapped the non-phased positions. When
we attempted to identify the potential phase initiators of
vviTAS7, we found that the small RNAs we have designated
as vvimiRNA828a and vviTAS7-primoRNA2 are complemen-
tary to the phase-initiator target sites and can direct the cleavage
at its 10th nucleotide position. This is supported by the fact that

Identification of ta-siRNAs and their regulatory cascades

 

two distinct degradation fragments overlapped on their 5’-ends
to the cleavage start position (Fig. 1B).

vviTAS8, vviTAS9 and vviTAS10 had lengths of 210, 357 and
546 nt, respectively, with P values of 8.60 X 104, 2.26 X 1041 and
1.22 X 10’“). Eleven sRNAs mapped onto vviTAS8, with four
overlapping to phased positions; no RNA degradation fragments
were detected (Fig. 1C). There were 23 sRNAs associated
with vviTAS9 and 7 of them overlapped to phased positions
(Fig. 1D). When we validated the cleaved phase positions of
vviTAS9, we found that six distinct RNA degradation fragments
mapped to it, but none mapped to phased positions. For
vviTAS10, there were 85 sRNAs; 22 were in the 21-nt increment
phase and 12 of the phased sRNAs consisted of six pairs of
perfect complementary duplexes; 10 RNA degradation frag-
ments mapped onto vviTAS10, but none to the phased positions
(Fig. 1E).

We used Mfold (Zuker, 2003) to determine if the initiators were
miRNAs. We found that none of them, except for vvimiRNA390
and vvimiRNA8282a, could form a typical stem—loop structure
with their 200-bp ﬂanking sequences, indicating that they might
be siRNAs.

The length of phase initiator is a key determinant for trigger-
ing ta-siRNA biogenesis (Chen et al., 2010; Cuperus et al., 2010;
Laubinger et al., 2010). This is usually 22nt, but exceptions
are known, such as miRNA390, which is only 21nt long
in Arabidopsis. The explanation given for this situation is
that there are two miRNA target sites in TAS3 RNA (Chen
et al., 2010). In this study, we identiﬁed vvimiRNA390 and
vviTAS3-primoRNA2—5 as phase initiators of vviTAS3. When
we analyzed their lengths and targeted sites, we found they were
all 21nt long and also had targets in both sides of vviTAS3
(data not shown). This is consistent with the miRNA390 studies
reported previously. vviTAS7 and vviTAS10 both have phase
initiators with the usual 22 nt, and other vviTASs have only
21 nt phase initiators. Further analyzing their targeted sites, we
did not ﬁnd two targets on their ﬁanking 100 nt, indicating some
other mechanism might exist.

3.3 Identiﬁcation of ta-siRNAs and their trans-acting
targets

To ﬁnd new ta—siRNAs and their downstream regulatory path-
ways, we assumed each sRNA from vviTASs was a ta-siRNA
and identiﬁed its trans-acting targets by searching for comple-
mentary regions in genome-wide transcripts. We allowed a
maximum of four mismatched base pairs and required that the
trans-cleaved position corresponds to the 10th position of the
ta-siRNA and overlaps the 5’-end of the RNA degradation frag-
ment mapped onto the transcript. Using these criteria, 22
ta-siRNAs and 37 trans-acting targets were located (Supplemen-
tary Fig. l and Supplementary Table 2).

Those ta—siRNAs derived from vviTAS3 mainly target tran-
scripts encoding auxin response factor 4/ 5, ribosomal protein S1,
senescence-associated protein DINl, ferric reductase, ribosomal
protein L10, DNA damage checkpoint protein rad24 and other
uncharacterized proteins. The ta—siRNAs derived from vviTAS7
target transcripts encode leucine—rich receptor-like protein
kinase (LRPK), adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), hydroxy-
proline-rich glycoprotein, histone acetyltransferase, ACBF-like

DNA-binding protein, fatty acid desaturase, cellulose synthase
catalytic subunit and several uncharacterized proteins. The
ta-siRNAs from vviTAS8 target the transcripts encoding
snRNP core protein SMX5b and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltrans-
ferase. ta—siRNAs from vviTAS9 target transcripts encode
chloroplast ribulose—1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase and cyto-
chrome b6-f complex subunit 7. The ta—siRNAs of vviTAS10
mainly target transcripts encoding early-responsive protein to
dehydration stress, phosphoribosyl—AMP cyclohydrolase,
ATP-binding cassette protein, caspase catalytic subunit p20,
malonyl—coenzyme A reductase, l-phosphatidylinositol—3-
phosphate 5-kinase and several uncharacterized proteins.
Analyzing these targets, we found that only auxin response
factor has been previously reported (Allen et al., 2005). The
others are novel, which further broadens the known scope of
ta-siRNA regulation and indicates that tasi-RNAs play a basic
regulatory role in plant growth and development.

3.3 cis—activity of ta—siRNAs

Although the trans-activity of ta-siRNA is well known, its cis-
acting function, i.e. cleavage of TAS transcripts, has not been
intensely studied. In this study, we examined the cis—activity of
ta—siRNAs by searching for ta—siRNAs, detecting their degrad-
ation products and validating their cis—cleaved positions based on
the criterion that the cis—cleaved position corresponds to the 10th
nucleotide position of the ta-siRNA and overlaps with the 5’-end
of the RNA degradation fragment mapped onto the TAS.

We observed ta-siRNA cis—activity for both vviTAS3 and
vviTAS7. As shown in Figure 2, vviTAS3 cis—activity was
driven by two ta—siRNAs originating from vviTAS3 5’D2(—).
The cis—cleavage start site was validated by three sRNAs from
the RNA degradome. With respect to the results of cis—cleavage,
ﬁve secondary small RNAs—four generated from the 5’ cleavage
product and one from the 3’-cleavage product—were found to be
arranged on vviTAS3 in 2l-nt increments. Three ta—siRNAs,
named vviTAS7-tasiRM4a, vviTAS7-tasiRM4b and vviTAS7-
tasiRM4c, were involved in vviTAS7 cis—activity, and one sec-
ondary sRNA was distributed on vviTAS7 in 2l-nt increments.
These results conﬁrm the cis—activity of ta-siRNA, suggest an
inactive mechanism of TAS transcription and a produced mech-
anism of multiple forms of sRNA from the same TAS.

3.4 ta—siRNA regulatory cascades and their conservation

Five different ta-siRNA regulatory cascades were identiﬁable
from the information we uncovered. As illustrated in Figure
3A, the ﬁrst cascade, related to vviTAS3, starts with cleavage
mediated by vvimiRNA390 and vviTAS3-primoRNA2—5.
Following cleavage on vviTAS3, six ta—siRNAs are produced
that target and trans-cleave transcripts of ribosomal protein S1,
auxin response factors 4/5, senescence protein DINl, ferric
reductase, ribosomal protein L10, DNA damage checkpoint pro-
tein rad24 and several uncharacterized proteins. The ta—siRNAs,
which include vviTAS3-tasiRM2a, vviTAS3-tasiRM2b and
vviTAS3-tasiRM2c, can also target vviTAS3 itself and direct
cis—cleavage to produce new sRNAs. In the second cascade,
related to vviTAS7 and illustrated in Figure 3B, the process
begins with cleavage mediated by vvimiRNA828a and
vviTAS7-primoRNA2. Thirteen ta—siRNAs are produced as a

Identification of ta-siRNAs and their regulatory cascades

 

acyltransferase and snRNP core protein SMX5b to suppress
their expressions. In the fourth cascade, related to vviTAS9
and illustrated in Figure 3D, vviTAS9-primoRNA targets
vviTAS9 to produce two groups of ta—siRNAs:
vviTAS9-tasiRP10a, b, c and vviTAS9-tasiRPl7a, b. These two
groups can, respectively, target chloroplast ribulose—l,5-
bisphosphate carboxylase and cytochrome b6-f complex subunit
7. The ﬁnal cascade, related to vviTAS10 and illustrated
in Figure 3E, begins with cleavage mediated by
vviTASlO-primoRNAl, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Eleven ta—siRNAs are
produced as a result, which variously target dehydration stress
protein, phosphoribosyl—AMP cyclohydrolase, ATP-binding
cassette protein, caspase catalytic subunit p20,
l-phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase-likeprotein, malo-
nyl-coenzyme A reductase and various uncharacterized proteins.

To evaluate the conservation of these ﬁve ta-siRNA regulatory
cascades, we examined the expressions of their TASs, phase ini-
tiators and ta—siRNAs in different species (Supplementary
Table 3).

The top 100 BLAST hits from NCBI showed that ESTs
of vviTAS3 exist for 28 species (V. vinifera, Acacia mangium,
T heobroma cacao, various citrus species and members of
Populus, Quercus, Papilionoideae and Euphorbiaceae);
vviTAS8 ESTs exist for four species (V. vinifera, Vitis riparia,
Vitis amurensis and Vitis bryoniifolia), but vviTAS7, vviTAS9
and vviTAS10 were only found from grapevine. A further exam-
ination of the number of sequenced phase initiators in 34 sRNA
libraries belonging to grapevine, orange, Arabidopsis and
tomato revealed that vvimiRNA390 is highly conserved.
Among tested sRNA libraries, vvimiRNA390 was found in 31,
whereas the other phase initiators only occurred in grapevine
sRNA libraries. On examining the number of ta—siRNA se-
quences in the 34 sRNA libraries, we found some ta—siRNAs
generated from vviTAS3 in at least two species of grapevine,
orange, Arabidopsis and tomato, but ta—siRNAs from other
vviTASs had only been sequenced from grapevine. This indicates
that the ta-siRNA regulatory cascade related to vviTAS3 is uni-
versal and that the regulatory cascades related to other vviTASs
are grape-speciﬁc.

A comparison of the 13 sequenced ta—siRNAs from vviTAS7
revealed that the number of sequences was not very uniform in
each grapevine library. vviTAS7-tasiRPld had been sequenced
more than tens of thousands times, but the other ta—siRNAs less
so, even though four ta—siRNAs—vviTAS7-tasiRP1a, vviTAS7-
tasiRPlb, vviTAS7-tasiRPlc and vviTAS7-tasiRP1d—all origi-
nated from vviTAS7 3’Dl(—l—). After further comparisons invol-
ving the number of sequenced ta—siRNAs from vviTAS9, the
same phenomenon was also observed: vviTAS9-tasiRP10b had
been sequenced several thousand times (at least), but the two
other ta—siRNAs arising from the same gene as vviTAS9-
tasiRPlOb were also less sequenced from each sRNA library.
Surprisingly, the two most highly sequenced ta—siRNAs were
both 21 nt long, showing that 2l-nt ta-siRNA is the most preva-
lent ta-siRNA among its analogs.

4 DISCUSSION

Because ta—siRNAs are produced from TAS, TAS is rich in
sRNAs. We can thus detect TASs by initially searching for

regions containing large numbers of sRNAs. Using this ap-
proach, a total of 49 055 regions were found. When we counted
the number of clusters overlapped to annotated gene loci and
exons, we found 2l-nt clusters were much more likely than 24-nt
clusters to overlap with exon regions. In previous studies, 24-nt
clusters have been implicated in transcriptional silencing of trans-
poson regions (Johnson et al., 2009). The grapevine 24-nt clusters
are seldom associated with gene regions, consistent with their
roles in directing silencing of transposable elements.

To further identify TAS loci from regions highly enriched in
sRNA, we used an improved computational method that allows
for a variable TAS length to predict 49 TASs. Compared with
current strategies, the greatest advantage of this improved
method is that it is not constrained by a 231-bp length require-
ment. This leads to a more accurate TAS prediction, especially
for the TASs with lengths longer or shorter than 231 bp, and has
great potential for future use. However, because the cleavage
position cannot be offset, it still requires further reﬁnement.
To further validate the cleavage sites of TASs targeted by
phase initiators, an RNA degradome was used. Because the
RNA degradome was obtained from high-throughput sequen-
cing of products generated from 5’-RACE, the degradome can
be used to analyze RNA degradation patterns, which is helpful
for identifying siRNA cleavage sites on mRNA or other cDNAs.
Here, we used it to determine phase initiator and ta—siRNA
cleavage sites.

We identiﬁed 22 ta—siRNAs, produced from vviTASs and 37
trans-cleaved targeted transcripts. The 37 targeted transcripts
are involved in a wide range of biological processes, including
basic biochemical responses, such as those related to ribosomal
protein S1, DNA damage checkpoint protein rad24, calcium-
transporting ATPase, fatty acid desaturase, cellulose synthase
catalytic subunit, and chloroplast ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase, and development-related processes, such as those
related to senescence-associated protein DINl, auxin response
factor and pathogenic defense-related protein LRPK. This
wide range of biological processes suggests that ta—siRNAs
play a basic regulatory role in plant growth and development.

ta—siRNAs have been suggested as key factors conferring regu-
latory diversity in members of multi-gene families involved in
auxin signaling (Allen et al., 2005). Because leucine—rich
receptor-like kinases make up one of the largest protein families,
with at least 223 members in Arabidopsis thaliana, and are tar-
geted by ta—siRNAs, they may also be diversely regulated. Any
regulatory control by miRNAs and other endogenous sRNAs is
still speculative, however.

The function of ta-siRNA trans-activity has been the focus
of many studies, but its cis—activity has rarely been investigated.
In a previous study (Allen et al., 2005), a function was suggested
but the phase initiator was not found. The cis—cleavage position
was validated and a secondary siRNA product was detected, but
that was not enough information to establish the cis—acting role
of ta-siRNA. In this study, we have conﬁrmed the cis—activity of
ta—siRNAs by identifying the phase initiator, as well as detecting
degradation products and determining the site of cis—cleavage.

The biological role of ta-siRNA regulatory cascades is also
interesting. In this article, we have reported ﬁve cascades and
evaluated their expressions in various species and tissues. The
results indicate that the vviTAS3-related cascade is conserved

across species; in contrast, the cascades related to vviTAS7,
vviTAS8, vviTAS9 and vviTAS10 are found only in grape.
There is a previously known cascade in which ath-miR828 tar-
gets ath-TAS4 and triggers production of ta—siRNAs, which in
turn regulate a group of MYB genes. The cascade related to
vviTAS7 is similar to the ath-miR28-associated cascade in
that the phase initiators for both cascades belong to the
miR828 family; however, the TASs, ta—siRNAs produced and
ta—siRNAs targets, are all different, indicating the discovery of
a new miR828 regulation pathway. Previous studies have posited
that viral siRNAs are abundant in plants, which implies that
ta-siRNA cascades may be involved in antiviral defense. Our
ﬁndings further suggest that different ta-siRNA cascades might
be speciﬁc to different species or tissues, opening the possibility
that some might have specialized developmental regulatory roles.

Surprisingly, vvimiRNA390 has lower copy numbers in certain
Arabidopsis mutant libraries than in wild-type libraries
(Supplementary Table 3). We believe that this situation stems
primarily from the different experimental conditions used to
produce the various libraries. For example, sRNA libraries with
lower numbers of vvimiRNA390 copies, including GSM154336,
GSM154361,GSMl54362,GSM154363,GSM154364,GS-
M154365,GSM154367, GSM154368, GSM154370, GSM154372,
GSM154374, GSM154375 and GSM154376, were all published
by the James Lab at Oregon State University, while the wild-type
library, GSM149079, was published by the Hannon Lab at Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory. For those Arabidopsis libraries cre-
ated under identical experimental conditions, the reason that few
or no vvimiR390 reads were detected is simply due to sequencing
depth. Libraries from the James Lab were generated using 454
sequencing in 2007; the total number of reads in several of these
libraries is below 20 000, which may be too low to detect
vvimiR390.

When we compared the number of sequenced ta—siRNAs from
vviTAS3, vviTAS7, vviTAS8, vviTAS9 and vviTAS10, we found
very different numbers in each library from grapevine. This is
very surprising as they are all produced from the same TAS
transcript simultaneously. This suggests a potentially different
degradation rate. In addition, among ta—siRNAs from the
same position, such as vviTAS7-tasiRPla, vviTAS7-tasiRP1b,
vviTAS7-tasiRPlc and vviTAS7-tasiRPld that all originate
from vviTAS7 3’Dl(+), the 21-nt ta-siRNA is always the most
abundant. This suggests that the degradation rate of 2l-nt
ta-siRNA is very slow, and that its function might be more
long lasting than its other analogs. Further studies are required
to obtain better insights into the mechanism of ta-siRNA
degradation.

Abstract

Motivation: Spatial learning is one of the most widely studied cognitive domains in neuroscience.
The Morris water maze and the Barnes maze are the most commonly used techniques to assess
spatial learning and memory in rodents. Despite the fact that these tasks are well-validated para-
digms for testing spatial learning abilities, manual categorization of performance into behavioral strat-
egies is subject to individual interpretation, and thus to bias. We have previously described an unbi-
ased machine-learning algorithm to classify spatial strategies in the Morris water maze.

Results: Here we offer a support vector machine (SVM) — based, automated, Barnes-maze unbiased
strategy (BUNS) classification algorithm, as well as a cognitive score scale that can be used for
memory acquisition, reversal training and probe trials. The BUNS algorithm can greatly benefit
Barnes maze users as it provides a standardized method of strategy classification and cognitive scor-
ing scale, which cannot be derived from typical Barnes maze data analysis.

1 Introduction

While the molecular and genetic tools applied in neuroscience are be-
coming ever more sophisticated, the most robust tasks that assess cogni-
tive spatial memory have been largely unchanged since the early 1980’s.
The Morris water maze (MWM), described by Richard Morris (Morris,
1984), and the Barnes maze, described by Carol Barnes (Barnes, 1979),
are the most widely used paradigms for assessing spatial learning in
rodents (Vorhees and Williams, 2006). We have recently described the
MUST-C (1\_/lorris water maze Unbiased ﬁrategy Qlassiﬁcation) algo-
rithm, which rapidly classiﬁes spatial swim strategies in the MWM and
provides an unbiased assessment of the cognitive capacity of rodents
(Illouz, et al., 2015). Similar to the MWM, the convenient and robust
nature of the Barnes maze has facilitated the investigation of spatial
learning in both control and disease states. For example, assessing spatial

learning using the Barnes maze has important implications for many
pathologies in which learning is impaired such as aging (Krause, et al.,
2008), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Puzzo, et al., 2014), neurodevelop-
mental disorders, mental retardation, pharmacological assays to assess
drug efﬁciency and more.

The Barnes maze also has advantages in assessing improvements in
spatial capacity, such as following enriched environment (Bonaccorsi, et
al., 2013), calorie restriction (Ma, et al., 2014), or exercise (Inoue, et al.,
2015). In contrast to the MWM paradigm, the Barnes maze is a dry
maze, reducing water-related stress that enables the use of in-Vivo devic-
es such as optogenetics. However, assessment of performance in the
Barnes maze is susceptible to experimenter bias, calling for a more ob-
jective method of data analysis.

The difference between the MWM and Barnes maze tasks, often re-
sults in different sets of navigation strategies utilized by rodents (Illouz,

et al., 2015). As a consequence, these differences call for a novel classi-
ﬁer dedicated to the Barnes maze.

In the Barnes maze, rodents are trained to ﬁnd an escape box hidden
under the surface of a circular table by relying on extra-maze cues
(O’Leary and Brown, 2012). The high illumination used in this task
(1350 lux), causes anxiety in the mice, providing the motivation to ﬁnd
the hidden chamber. Performance in this task relies on hippocampal
place cells, validating its use as a task for spatial learning (Bimonte-
Nelson, 2015). The efﬁciency in which mice perform this task is then
quantiﬁed using speciﬁc parameters such as the latency to reach the
escape chamber, total distance traveled, mean moving speed, and path
efﬁciency (calculated as the distance between the ﬁrst and last locations
divided by the total distance). Additional attributes are typically used to
control for the animal’s behavior, such as immobility and mean speed.
Both cognitive and non-cognitive traits are evident during spatial naviga-
tion, including changes in mean speed, path efﬁciency, duration, and
body rotations. Mice typically exhibit speciﬁc navigation strategies when
tested in the Barnes maze, reﬂecting the extent of their spatial acquisition
of the environment and thus provide information about the integrity of
hippocampus-dependent functions and cognitive state. Based on narrow-
er previous strategy deﬁnitions (direct, serial and mixed) (Harrison, et
al., 2006) as well as our empirical data, we have deﬁned 6 main naviga-
tion strategies for the Barnes maze. This broader range of spatial strate-
gies is described ﬁom highly spatial to non-spatial strategies: (a) direct,
reﬂects the optimal acquisition of the target’s location, as the animal
efﬁciently identiﬁes its location and the target’s location and thus uses
the shortest trajectory possible (b) corrected, reﬂects a slightly lower
efﬁciency, as the animal makes a minor correction in the trajectory to-
wards the target, and often follows re-angualtion (c) long-correction
consist of a major correction in the trajectory, as the animal navigates to
a distal region of the environment, re-angulates and make a direct
movement towards the target ((1) focused search reﬂects a localized
scanning of the region surrounding the target (e) serial search reﬂects a
systematic non-spatial method of enhancing the probability of ﬁnding
the target, as the animal travels from one hole to the adjacent hole in a
serial manner (f) random search reﬂects no acquisition of the target
location, as the animal utilizes a non-systematic method of enhancing the
probability of ﬁnding the target by traveling randomly in the environ-
ment. The speciﬁc combination of strategies employed by mice in the
Barnes maze are considered representative of the level of cognitive re-
sources being used for the task (Bimonte-Nelson, 2015). However, de-
spite thorough assessment of trajectory parameters, non-spatial naviga-
tion strategies can increase in efﬁciency over time, resulting in a de-
creased latency to reach the escape box. Moreover, simple quantiﬁcation
of latency, mean speed, distance and other parameters describing per-
formance in the Barnes maze often result in only a partial understanding
of mouse behavior and cognitive capacity. In order to avoid such errone-
ous or incomplete interpretation of behavioral data in the Barnes maze,
manual assessments of mouse behavior are often required. Manual as-
sessments of spatial strategies are time-consuming, and different experi-
mental conditions alter searching attributes used in the apparatus, hinder-
ing cross-experiment analysis of mouse behavior. Moreover, manual
assessments are prone to experimenter bias during analysis. Thus, manu-
al assessment fails to reliably detect important aspects of cognitive spa-
tial behavior in the Barnes maze, due to reduced sensitivity to nuances,
bias, and environmental factors.

For these reasons, we constructed the Barnes maze unbiased strategy
(BUNS) classiﬁcation tool, an automatic classiﬁcation algorithm, freely
available for the analysis of mouse behavior. This tool uses generic
features of the mouse path to enable unbiased analysis of spatial learning

strategies, and presents a cognitive scoring scale based on the spatial
learning strategy used by the mice. We have compared performance of
mice in the Barnes maze in order to validate and assess the sensitivity of
our algorithm. . Our data demonstrate that the BUNS algorithm provides
unbiased analysis of Barnes maze behavioral data and extends the capac-
ity of researchers to understand the mechanisms of spatial learning and
memory in rodents.

2 Methods

Animals. Congenic 8 week old male mice (n=15) from a C57bl/6 genetic
background were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor,
ME). Animals were housed in a reversed 12:12hr cycle to enable cogni-
tive assessment during the animals’ activity period. Animal care and
experimental procedures followed Bar Ilan University guidelines and
were approved by the Bar llan University Animal Care and Use Commit-
tee.

Barnes maze. A circular table 105 cm high with a diameter of 92 cm was
used. Eighteen holes are located at the perimeter of the table at equal
distances, each with a diameter of 5 cm. One hole only (the target hole)
leads to an escape chamber in which the animal can hide. Illumination
was measured at the center of the table and maintained at 1350 lux in
order to encourage the animal’s motivation to search for the target hole.
During the habituation phase, which lasted one day, the animal was
placed in a cylinder at the center of the maze. Five seconds later, the
cylinder was removed and the mouse was allowed to explore the envi-
ronment for 120 seconds. Mice that found the target hole were able to
enter the escape chamber; mice that did not ﬁnd it within this period of
time were placed back in the cylinder, now located above the target hole.
In this phase mice were given one trial only.

Four Visual cues were presented on the walls surrounding the Barnes
table (Supplementary Figure 1). In the spatial acquisition phase, mice
were given 120 seconds per trial to ﬁnd the target hole. Mice that did
not ﬁnd it were placed at the target hole area until they located it. Mice
were divided into groups of 4. Each animal was given 2, 3 or 4 trials
(separate experiments) with an inter-trial interval of 10 minutes. Thus, all
four mice completed a trial before the next trial began. This procedure
was repeated daily until no signiﬁcant improvement in performance was
identiﬁed. Following spatial acquisition, a probe test was conducted with
closed holes and no escape chamber. Animals were given a single 60s
trial to explore the environment. Following the probe test, the target hole
and escape chamber were moved 1800 from the original target location.
Similar to the spatial acquisition phase, mice were given 4 non-
sequential trials, 120s each, to ﬁnd the new escape chamber. This proce-
dure was repeated daily until no signiﬁcant improvement in latency was
identiﬁed. Latency to reach the escape chamber, total distance travelled
and mean speed were automatically calculated by the Video tracking
system (ANY-maze, Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL, USA).

Algorithm

Support vector machine. Support vector machine (SVM) (Boser, et al.,
1992; Vapnik, 1998) is a supervised learning classiﬁcation technique. It
has a strong theoretical basis and has been proven to be successful in
numerous classiﬁcation tasks from handwritten digit recognition to bio-
informatics (Osuna, et al., 1997; Tong and Keller, 2002). Linear SVM
separates a binary-labeled training data set by a hyper plane (decision
boundary) that maximizes the margin between the two classes. A test set
point is labeled according to its location in the feature space, relative to

9mg ‘09 isnﬁnV uo sajaﬁuV soq ‘BIHJOJIIBQ jo AirSJQAru [1 112 ﬁlosleumofpleXO'soriemJOJHrorw/zdnq moxj papeolumoq

the decision boundary. The kernel function used in this study is the radial
basis function. We used the MATLAB SVM function (The MathWorks,
Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States) in this classiﬁer.

Our Training set consists of over 600 labeled trials, which include six
possible strategies. Input is generated by Video tracking software (ANY -
maze, Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL, USA) and contains a computer-
graphic X, Y coordinate of the animal’s center-point or head location
according to the user’s preference. Animal coordinates are converted into
Cartesian coordinates to extract a set of 15 factors characterizing differ-
ent aspects of the animal trajectory (Supp. Table 1), such as trial dura-
tion, total distance, absolute angles and path efﬁciency. Variables were
chosen to characterize the physical properties of the different strategies
(time, distance and speed) as well as the spatial performance of the ani-
mal (path efﬁciency, number of circles, distance from perimeter). All
data were normalized using the Z-score method (see Supplementary
Methods).

Prediction accuracy. Prediction accuracy of the BUNS algorithm was
compared to 962 trials that had been manually classiﬁed by researchers
using confusion matrices.

Multi-class classiﬁcation. In order to categorize data into multiple clas-
ses, we performed a set of hierarchically ordered binary decisions to
separate the data into one of several subclasses. To build the suitable tree
we ﬁrst performed an unsupervised binary k—mean clustering. This anal-
ysis was conducted with 1-5 hierarchical layers (2-16 clusters, Figure
2F). A separation index was calculated for each branch as the percentage
of trials belonging to a single strategy divided by the sum of percentages
of all other strategies in this branch. The strategy’s location was deter-
mined according to the maximal separation index obtained (Figure 2F).
Based on this unsupervised dendrogram we have designed a similar tree
for the SVM-analysis (Figure 2G). As demonstrated, related strategies
are neighboring branches, for example, direct and corrected are both
highly cognitive strategies and therefore located at the same branch.
However, they are also based on the strategy’s actual features. For ex-
ample, although long correction is theoretically related to correction, it
was located near focused search due to its high distance. At each deci-
sion junction, the relevant features were selected in the same manner. In
the ﬁrst layers, more general features, such as trial length, were used to
separate the data into short or long trials. At deeper layers, each decision
was made by a different set of ﬁner features relevant to the theoretical
basis and actual characteristics of the junction, such as number of se-
quential hole visitations to separate serial ﬁom random.

Cognitive score. We provide a quantiﬁcation method for performance in
the Barnes maze, as each training trial was scored with a numerical value
in a non-arbitrary manner. To do so we have applied the well-known
unsupervised machine learning method of k—means clustering with possi-
ble 1-5 layers. The optimal tree was then chosen according to the highest
homogeneity of its branches. Next we scaled each strategy according to
its location in the dendrogram, that is, the number of junctions from the
optimal direct strategy (scored 1, Figure 2G): random = 0, serial = 0.25,
focused search = 0.5, long correction =0.5, corrected = 0.75, and direct =
1.

Statistical Analysis. All statistical methods can be found in supplemen-
tary information.

3 Results

Spatial learning in the Barnes maze. We developed an SVM-based
Barnes maze u_nbiased strategy classiﬁer (BUNS) algorithm for the clas-
siﬁcation of spatial strategies in the Barnes maze. In order to assess
whether the algorithm detects changes in the navigation strategy of mice,
we used BUNS to analyze raw data ﬁom three Barnes maze experiments
conducted with 2, 3, or 4 non-consecutive trials per day (n = 15 per
group). Mice tested with 3 and 4 trials per day exhibited a signiﬁcant
reduction in latency to reach the escape box ranging from 72.5i4.1s and
78.3i6.8s respectively on the ﬁrst day, to 18.5i1.2s, 21.4i2.1s respec-
tively on the last day (P<0.0001, Figure 1A). Mice trained with only 2
trials per day exhibited a milder reduction in latency ranging ﬁom
66.62i8s to 56.8i7.5s at day 9 (P<0.0001, Figure 1A). The distance
traveled was also reduced in mice receiving 3 or 4 trials, ranging ﬁom
2.95i0.23m and 3.6i0.4m covered to 1.15i0.07m, 1.04i0. 1m on the last
trial, respectively (P<0.0001, Figure 1B). In contrast, mice trained with
only 2 trials per day did not exhibit a reduction in the distance traveled
(2.74i0.4 m to 2.6i0.38 m, P<0.0001, Figure 1B). Path efﬁciency on the
last day of training was higher in mice that received 3 or 4 trials:
0.48i0.03 and 0.54i0.03 compared with 2 trials, 0.32i0.04 on the last
day of training (P<0.001, Figure 1C). Moreover, mice tested with 3 and
4 trials exhibited a signiﬁcant enhancement in path efﬁciency, whereas
mice tested with 2 trials did not (P<0.001, P<0.0001, P=0.97, respec-
tively, Figure 1C). Mean speed increased in mice trained with 3 and 4
trials per day, ﬁom 0.039i0.002 m/sec, 0.042i0.002 m/sec to
0.049i0.002 m/sec, 0.052i0.002 m/sec on the last day of training
(P<0.05, Figure 1D). However, mean speed did not differ between
groups in mice trained with only 2 trials per day (P=0.95, Figure 1D).
Thus, 3 trials per day is the minimum number required for successful
spatial learning by the mice in the Barnes maze.

Although the conventional measures of latency, distance, path efﬁciency
and mean speed provide a general quantiﬁcation of the spatial learning
process, they are not discriminative enough between all navigation strat-
egies. For example, latency and distance distinguish between direct and
random (Figures 2B, C), however they do not sufﬁciently discriminate
between ﬁner differences such as between direct and corrected search, or
long correction and focused search, since their distributions overlap in
different strategies (Figures 2B, C). Path efﬁciency provides a better
measure of spatial acquisition, as it reﬂects the efﬁcacy of the animal’s
navigation strategy based on its trajectory. However, this variable also
fails to provide a ﬁne discrimination between direct and corrected strate-
gies, as their distributions partially overlap in different strategies (Figure
2D). Mean speed does not provide any discriminating information, as
there is no sufﬁcient variation between strategies (Figure 2E). Neverthe-
less, the animal’s speed does affect the latency to reach the target, and
thus provides information about the motor performance of the tested
strain. Because the parameters used in the Barnes maze have substantial
overlap, manual assessment is often required to accurately differentiate
between individual strategies, introducing potential bias in analysis. The
BUNS algorithm provides ﬁne discrimination of learning strategies and
sets a cognitive scale to enable the researcher to better understand the
cognitive state of the subjects.

Spatial strategy classiﬁcation using the SVM. The BUNS algorithm
we employed (Figure 2F) was composed of ﬁve binary decision junc-
tions (Figure 2G). This architecture was based on an unsupervised tree
obtained by performing k—means binary clustering analysis with 1-5

9mg ‘09 1sn8nV uo sajaﬁuV soq ‘121u10111123 jo A11819Aruf1 112 [310'SIBIIJHO[p.IOJXO'SODBIIHOJIIIOIQ/ﬂ(11111 111011 papeolumoq

 

layers of separation (2-16 clusters, Figure 2F). The optimal tree was
determined according to the maximal separation indices (Figure 2F). X
and Y coordinates were used to generate 15 parameters (Supp. table 1),
which were then normalized to Z-score values (see Supplementary algo-
rithm). These factors were fed to the SVM algorithm, which was previ-
ously trained using labeled trials (see Figure 2A, Algorithm). The predic-
tion accuracy of the BUNS algorithm for experiments using 2, 3 and 4
trials per day was 93%, 90% and 89%, respectively (Figure 3A). These
prediction rates are represented in their respective confusion matrices
(Figures 3B-D). In order to assess the classiﬁcation bias of human judges
and the BUNS algorithm, we have compared the classiﬁcation results of
three independent judges and the BUNS algorithm with previously vali-
dated human labels. The bias of the human classiﬁcation is signiﬁcantly
higher than the machine bias (0.5i0.005, 0.2, respectively, P<0.05,
Supp. Figure 3,4) and the classiﬁcation standard deviation was 9-times
the magnitude of the bias. In addition, the human classiﬁcation suffers
from between-judges differences, as the between-subject standard devia-
tion was 0.53i0.39, the stable machine classiﬁcation suffers ﬁom no
such variance (P<0.0001, Supp. Figures 3,4).

Using this algorithm, we found that mice tested with 2 trials per day
shifted from mostly random search on the ﬁrst day (69.3i8.4%) to most-
ly serial search (36i8.7%) on the last day (Figure 4A, Supp. Table 2).
Mice tested with 3 trials per day shifted from mostly random
(27.2i6.6%) and serial search on day 1 (29.8i6.8%, Figure 4B, Supp.
Table 2), to mostly corrected search on day 6 (33.3i7%, Figure 4A,
Supp. Table 2). Mice tested with 4 trials per day shifted from mostly
random search on day 1 (45i7.4%), to mostly direct (23.3i6.3%) and
corrected (3 8.3i7.2%) search on the last day (Figure 4C, Supp. Table 2).

The cognitive level of a particular strategy used by mice can be quanti-
ﬁed in order to provide a deﬁnitive score for spatial cognitive capacity.
In order to accomplish this, we attributed a scoring scale for the different
navigation strategies based on their relevance to spatial learning (see the
Algorithm section, distance between strategies in Figure 2F), that is, the
scaled distance of each strategy in the hierarchical tree from direct swim
(Figure 2G), quantiﬁed as number of junctions between them. This anal-
ysis indicates that mice tested with 2 trials per day obtained signiﬁcantly
lower cognitive scores compared to mice receiving 4 trials (P<0.05,
Figure 4D). In addition, mice tested with 3 trials per day obtained signif-
icantly lower cognitive scores compared to those with 4 trials (P<0.05,
Figure 4D). This observation is further strengthened when measuring the
latency distribution of the mice. While mice trained with 3 and 4 trials
per day exhibited a shift in the latency distribution throughout training
(P=2.5*10'19 and 1.31*10'12, Supplementary Figure 2A-F), mice trained
with 2 trials per day exhibited equal distribution between days (P=0.53,
Supplementary Figure 2A-I).

To conﬁrm that mice relied on spatial navigation to reach the hidden
platform, mice trained with 4 trials per day (n = 15) were given a probe
trial twenty-four hours following the last training day. All mice exhibited
a high preference towards the escape box (P<0.01, Figure 5A). Refer-
ence memory errors were deﬁned as the ﬁrst entry into a non-target hole.
Additional entries to non-target holes were considered working memory
errors. During the probe trial, mice exhibited a higher rate of working
memory errors than reference memory errors (P<0.0001, Figure 5B).
Since reference memory errors were less than the potential maximal
value (17 non-target holes) the high number of working memory errors
reﬂects the animal’s tendency to repeatedly Visit holes near the target,
rather than search in more distant holes. Thus, these data conﬁrm the
process of spatial navigation in this task.

Similar to the acquisition stage, we again employed the SVM
algorithm in analysis of navigation strategies in probe trials. In this SVM
variant, we included a binary algorithm with two decision junctions
(Figure 6A). As before, X and Y coordinates were used to generate 15
parameters (see Supp. table 1). These parameters were normalized to Z-
score values, and then fed to a new SVM algorithm (with the same ker-
nel), which was trained separately with over 120 relevant pre-labeled
trials (Figure 6B). The prediction accuracy of the BUNS algorithm in the
probe trial analysis was 97.7% (Figure 6C). This prediction accuracy is
also represented in a confusion matrix (Figure 6D). Using this algorithm,
we found that during probe trials, the navigation strategy of the mice
mostly consisted of focused search (57i12%), serial search (14i8.9%)
and serial-random search (29i11%) (Figure 6E, Supp. Table 3). To
quantify the cognitive capacity of mouse performance, we again assigned
a scoring scale for search strategies unique to the probe trials based on
their relevance to spatial learning (see the Algorithm section). Mice
tested with 4 trials per day obtained a score of 0.68i0.1 (Figure 6F).

If spatial information is not reinforced, spatial memory extinction can
result (Rossato et al., 2006). To further demonstrate that the SVM algo-
rithm is capable of detecting spatial memory extinction, we conducted an
additional reversal task only in mice tested with 4 trials per day (n = 15).
Mice exhibited a signiﬁcant reduction in latency to reach the escape box
from 70.1 i6.4s to 17.7i1.9s (P<0.0001, Figure 7A). This was accom-
panied by a reduction in the distance travelled from 3.1i0.28m to
1.05i0.15m (P<0.0001, Figure 7B). Similarly, path efﬁciency also im-
proved from 0.19i0.02 to 0.54i0.03 (P<0.0001, Figure 7C). The mean
speed of the mice was signiﬁcantly lower on the ﬁrst day compared to
subsequent days (P<0.05, Figure 7D).

Using the data from the reversal task, we next employed the BUNS
analysis to reveal navigation strategies used by the mice during memory
extinction of the previous location of the escape box and memory acqui-
sition of the new location of the escape box. Mice shifted from mostly
serial (40i6.3%) and random (45i6.4%) search on the ﬁrst day to mostly
direct (20i5.1%) and corrected (31.6i6%) on the last day (Figure 7E,
Supp. Table 4). The cognitive score increased signiﬁcantly from
0.19i0.03 on the ﬁrst day to 0.6i0.03 on the last day (P<0.0001, Figure
7F).

4 Discussion

The BUNS algorithm offers an accurate and unbiased determination of
the spatial strategies utilized by mice in the Barnes maze, a widely used
task for the assessment of cognitive learning in rodents. Our data conﬁrm
that the BUNS algorithm can be effectively used to analyze Barnes Maze
data in a reduced-bias and stable fashion. Further, we have created a
cognitive score scale that assesses memory acquisition, reversal training
and probe trials.

While performance in spatial learning tasks such as the Barnes maze is
typically quantiﬁed using factors such as latency and path efﬁciency,
these parameters are limited in their ability to illustrate the complexity of
the animal’s spatial cognitive capacity. In addition, since researchers in
different laboratories use different experimental setups and animals ﬁom
different backgrounds, the ability to quantify the various spatial strate-
gies exhibited by the mice enables investigators to directly compare
phenotypic data obtained in different apparatuses. Notably, the BUNS

tool enables this analysis to be performed in different variants of the
Barnes maze, such as during acquisition, probe trials, reversal, and

memory extinction, which enables one to obtain a complete picture of
the spatial cognition phenotype of the mice.

The BUNS tool exhibits sensitivity that exceeds the discrimination ob-
tained by typical parameters such as latency, distance and path efﬁcien-
cy. In fact, when comparing the performance of the mice, which were
given 3 trials per day vs. 4 trials per day, no signiﬁcant difference was
observed in either latency, distance or path efﬁciency. However, the
cognitive score derived from the spatial strategy assessment did reveal a
higher cognitive score obtained by mice trained with 4 trials per day
compared with mice trained with 3 trials per day. Moreover, our ﬁndings
reveal a limitation in the spatial acquisition of the target hole when ani-
mals were given 2 trials per day. Thus, the BUNS algorithm was able to
tease out slight differences in navigation strategies that enabled a differ-
ential classiﬁcation and separation of the mice.

Current methodologies and analysis of the Barnes maze, while effective,
still neglect to discriminate between important differences in navigation
strategy and cognitive ability in mice. The BUNS tool enables efﬁcient,
accurate and objective comparison between mouse strains and experi-
mental conditions that was previously unavailable. Overall, the BUNS
algorithm offers the research community a powerful tool in assessing
spatial learning in rodents.

Figure 1. Target acquisition in the Barnes maze is dependent on the number of
trials. Mice were trained in the Barnes maze until optimal performance was maintained
for two consecutive days (n = 15 per group), measured by latency to reach the target hole.
Mice trained with 2 trials per day exhibited a slower learning curve compared to mice

Barnes maze variables are insufﬁcient to assess mouse performance. Distributions of
(B) latency, (C) distance, (D) path efﬁciency, and (E) mean speed by search strategy
reveal that these variables are insufﬁcient for a manual linear classification. A vast
overlap between strategies is observed, even if only the middle 50% of each variable
(in red) is under consideration. (F) Binary hierarchical tree derived from an unsu-

Figure 5. Performance in the probe test reﬂects memory retention of the target
location. Following optimal acquisition of the target location, a probe test was conducted
(n = 15). Animals were given 60 seconds to explore the environment in the absence of the
escape chamber. (A) A Gaussian-shaped distribution of entries into the zone surrounding
the target hole (marked as zero) implies a strong reference memory of the escape chamber
location. (B) Working memory errors were higher than reference memory errors which
did not reach its maximal value (17, the maximal number of holes). **P<0.01,

Figure 7. Spatial strategy classiﬁcation by the BUNS algorithm during reversal
acquisition in mice tested with 4 trials per day. Following the acquisition and probe
test phases, the target hole was relocated 180 degrees from the original target. Mice (n =
15) were trained on the task until optimal performance was maintained for two consecu-
tive days, measured by latency to reach the target hole. The following parameters were
measured: (A) latency to reach the target hole, P<0.0001, (B) total distance traveled,
P<0.0001 (C) path efﬁciency, P<0.0001, and (D) mean speed P<0.05. Classiﬁcation of
the spatial strategies was conducted using the BUNS algorithm. (E) Percentage of strate-
gy used each day of the test. The utility of highly spatial strategies increased gradually
throughout the course of the reversal task (F) Cognitive scores increased signiﬁcantly

throughout the task. Two-way ANOVA repeated measures. * P<0.05, ** ** P<0.0001.

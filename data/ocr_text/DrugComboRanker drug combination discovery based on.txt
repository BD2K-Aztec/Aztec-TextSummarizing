ABSTRACT

Motivation: Currently there are no curative anticancer drugs, and drug
resistance is often acquired after drug treatment. One of the reasons is
that cancers are complex diseases, regulated by multiple signaling
pathways and cross talks among the pathways. It is expected that
drug combinations can reduce drug resistance and improve patients’
outcomes. In clinical practice, the ideal and feasible drug combin-
ations are combinations of existing Food and Drug Administration-
approved drugs or bioactive compounds that are already used on
patients or have entered clinical trials and passed safety tests.
These drug combinations could directly be used on patients with
less concern of toxic effects. However, there is so far no effective
computational approach to search effective drug combinations from
the enormous number of possibilities.

Results: In this study, we propose a novel systematic computational
tool DrugComboRanker to prioritize synergistic drug combinations
and uncover their mechanisms of action. We first build a drug func-
tional network based on their genomic profiles, and partition the net-
work into numerous drug network communities by using a Bayesian
non-negative matrix factorization approach. As drugs within overlap-
ping community share common mechanisms of action, we next un-
cover potential targets of drugs by applying a recommendation
system on drug communities. We meanwhile build disease-specific
signaling networks based on patients’ genomic profiles and interac-
tome data. We then identify drug combinations by searching drugs
whose targets are enriched in the complementary signaling modules
of the disease signaling network. The novel method was evaluated on
lung adenocarcinoma and endocrine receptor positive breast cancer,
and compared with other drug combination approaches. These case
studies discovered a set of effective drug combinations top ranked in
our prediction list, and mapped the drug targets on the disease sig-
naling network to highlight the mechanisms of action of the drug
combinations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cancers are complex diseases regulated by interactions of mul-
tiple signaling pathways interacting with each other. Though
there are some anticancer drugs, they are often not curative
and associated with acquired drug resistance. It is believed that
a single drug can target only one disease signaling module,
whereas alternative signaling pathways will be activated to main-
tain tumor development. For example, in melanoma, the select-
ive BRAF inhibitor, PLX4032, can induce tumor responses in
the majority of patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma,
but the duration of this response is limited owing to the devel-
opment of acquired resistance, which may be due to alternative
pathways parallel to the ‘BRAF-MEK-ERK’ signaling pathway
(Johannsen et al., 2013; Nazarian et al., 2010). To reduce the
drug resistance effect, and improve cancer treatment outcomes,
drug combinations are considered as an optimal option.

The ideal drug combinations expected by clinicians are com-
binations of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—approved
drugs or existing bioactive compounds that have entered clinical
trials and passed safety tests. These drug combinations could be
used by patients without toxic side effects. Drug combination
prediction has been a challenging task in computational biology,
despite a few studies in the area. The genetic algorithm was, for
example, proposed to ﬁnd the optimal combinations of a small
number of drugs based on the experimental results (Zinner et al.,
2009). The method, however, is not able to identify optimal drug
combinations from a large set of drugs, as it requires
experimental validations in the prediction process. The machine
learning-based approach was proposed to classify drugs into
combinations based on molecular and pharmacological features
of drugs (Zhao et al., 2011). However, the features of drugs are
too general to be informative, and the method does not integrate
the rich genomic proﬁles of drugs and disease into consideration.
Combinatorial Drug Assembler (CDA) was developed to iden-
tify drug combinations based on enrichment analysis of
genomic proﬁle data. However, the enrichment analysis imple-
mented in the method is based on differentially expressed genes,
disease driver genes are not clearly deﬁned, so that drugs target-
ing the causal dysfunctional signaling modules of disease
maybe missed out (Lee et al., 2012). To overcome the afore-
mentioned problems, we propose a novel computational tool,
DrugComboRanker, for predicting drug combinations targeting
multiple signaling modules of cancer-speciﬁc networks through
integrative analysis of genomic proﬁles of both drugs and
cancers.

DrugComboRanker: a tool for drug combination prediction

 

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Overview of DrugComboRanker

This study seeks to answer a clinical question that which drugs can be
combined with existing therapy to reduce drug resistance and im-
prove patients’ outcomes. We have thus developed a novel tool,
DrugComboRanker, to prioritize drug combinations and uncover the
underlying mechanisms of action. The approach is designed based on
the following two observations. First, dysfunctional signaling networks
of diseases are complex and stable, and effective drug combinations can
inhibit major modules of the networks simultaneously. Second, drugs
often have multiple active target genes or proteins. Grouping targets of
drugs with similar transcriptional responses proﬁles allows better recov-
ery of their targeted signaling modules in disease than based on indi-
vidual targets alone. Figure 1 is an overview of the proposed
DrugComboRanker. The drug functional network is ﬁrstly reconstructed
based on genomic proﬁling data of drugs that are available in the
Connectivity Map (CMAP) database. The Bayesian non-negative
matrix factorization with the ,B-divergence (BNMF,BD; Tan and
Fevotte, 2013) approach is conducted to partition the drug functional
network into connected functional communities, whose targets indicate
the inhibited signaling modules of diseases. On the other hand, the dys-
functional signaling modules of diseases are reconstructed by integrating
disease genomics data and protein interactome data. Drug combinations
are then ranked from different drug functional communities, which in-
hibit disease signaling network modules.

2.2 Drug functional network reconstruction

The aim of drug function network reconstruction is to identify drug
communities that share common transcriptional responses to drug treat-
ment. We reconstruct, the drug functional network based on the data of
the CMAP (CMap, build 02; Lamb et al., 2006), which consists of 6100
gene expression proﬁles of four cancer cell lines (MCF7, PC3, HL60 and
SKMELS) treated by 1309 drugs at different doses. We ﬁrst combine the
similarity metric proposed in (Iorio et al., 2010) with the metric deﬁned in
the STITCH database (Kuhn et al., 2012) as a new drug similarity metric

speciﬁc drug combinations

as follows. First, for each individual drug at each dose, genes are ranked
based on their fold changes (drug treatment versus control). Then, gene
rank lists at different doses are merged into one gene rank list by using a
hierarchical majority voting scheme (Iorio et al., 2010). The merging
procedure ﬁrst compares gene rank lists using the Spearman’s Footrule
similarity metric (Diaconis and Graham, 1977), and then the two most
similar lists are merged repeatedly by using the Borda Merging strategy
(Lin, 2010). Consequently, gene signatures for individual drugs are cre-
ated by optimally selecting the top- and bottom-ranked 250 genes, re-
spectively. This size of these signatures is heuristically determined as
described in (Iorio et al., 2010). Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis
(Subramanian et al., 2005) score, SG(i, j), is used as the dissimilarity
metric between drug 1' and drug j. A threshold T = 0.7848 (the third
quantile of the empirical probability distribution of the drug dissimilarity
metric) is given to remove the non-signiﬁcant dissimilarities as follows:

S,G(l_,j): { SG(ivj)v  S T

, else

Then we convert the dissimilarity into the normalized similarity score, S/IG
(i, j) as 350,1) =1 — N0RM(SG(i,j)) and N0RM(SG(i, j)) = (3G0, j)
—min(SG(i, .)))/(max(SG(i, .)) — min(SG(i, .) where 3G0, .) = {SG(i, 1), 3G
(1', 2), . . . , 3G0, 11)} denotes all the connection scores linking to the i-th
node. Here, we empirically set C = 10. In addition to the similarity of
transcriptional responses, a different similarity metric, Ss(i, j), was deﬁned
in STITCH database (Kuhn et al., 2012) by integrating a combined score
of structure similarity, experimental similarity and text mining similarity
score. The structure similarity is deﬁned by the Tanimoto 2D chemical
similarity scores (Martin et al., 2002). The experimental similarity is cal-
culated by the Pearson correlation of the activity patterns of the com-
pounds based on NCI60 screens. The text mining similarity is computed
by mining the curated database, such as OMIM and MEDLINE, using a
co-occurrence scheme and a natural language processing approach
(Jensen et al., 2006; Sarié et al., 2006). In this study, we combine the
two similarity metrics as S(i, j)=SS(i, j)+.SwG(i, j). The rational to use
the combined similarity is to generate better drug community structure
when applying the clustering algorithm on the drug functional network.
Finally, a drug functional network is reconstructed with 1308 nodes and
51 164 edges. Figure 2 shows an example of the reconstructed drug func-
tional network community.

2.3 Drug community discovery by using Bayesian non-
negative matrix factorization with ,B-divergence

Next, we partition the reconstructed drug functional network into com-
munities (modules) within which drugs share common mechanisms of
action (targeting the same or related signaling modules), as illustrated
in Figure 2. We use the BNMF,BD (Tan and Fevotte, 2013) for the net-
work partition. The algorithm has shown good partition results on vari-
ous classes of real-world signals such as audio and images (Tan and
Fevotte, 2013), Speciﬁcally, the algorithm can (i) enable soft partitioning
(one drug can be partitioned into multiple communities with different
membership scores); (ii) reduce noise inﬂuence (suppresses noise in the
high dimensional space); and (iii) allow multi-scale partition. To the best
of our knowledge, the algorithm is for the ﬁrst time used in drug func-
tional network partition.

Speciﬁcally, given a weighted undirected network with N nodes, let
V e [REXN denote its adjacent matrix. BNMF,BD factorizes the matrix V
into two low-rank matrices:

V~V=WH (1)

where W and H are non-negative matrices with dimensions N X K and
K X N, and the elements of V, V, W and H are denoted by vi], 17,-,” and
hkj, respectively. The k-th column of Wis denoted by wk 6 [REXK and the

k-th row of H is denoted by hk e [REXN . The Wis normalized to WN, that

where wnij is the element of WN and it quantiﬁes the membership of node
i with respect to community j. To infer the appropriate model order K,
we use a Bayesian paradigm for non-negative matrix factorization
by placing automatic relevance determination priors with scale hyper-
parameters 1.: {1.1,};1 on the variables wk and hkj. In this model, the
distribution of 1.;C is parameterized by ﬁxed parameters a and b, and the
ﬁxed parameter ,8 decides the distance measure between the observed
interactions V and the expected interactions  Under these assumptions,
the posterior density function can be obtained as

p(V I W, H)p(W I1)p(H I1)p(1~)

W,H,1. =

(3)

Maximizing the posterior density is equivalent to minimizing the negative
log posterior, which can be regarded as a loss function CMAp(W, H, 1.) as

CMAP(WaHa   

= _ log p(V |W, H) — 10g 170W.) — 10g(H|1~) — 10gp(1~) (5)

where log p( V| W, H) is the log-likelihood.

To minimize CMAp(W, H, 1.) with respect to W, H and 1., we adopt the

minimization algorithm with efﬁcient multiplicative updates. Finally, we
give the overlapping community detection algorithm as follows:

approach, we partition the drug functional network into a set of
connected network modules (Fig. 2), within which drugs share
common targets or related signaling mechanisms.

2.4 Drug combination discovery based on target network
analysis

The novel drug combination approach consists of the following three
major components.

(a) Disease speciﬁc signaling network reconstruction

Several approaches (Barrenas et al., 2012; Chuang et al., 2007; Ideker
et al., 2002) have been proposed to reconstruct signaling networks of
diseases based on transcritpome and interactome data. In this study,
the approach proposed in (Barrenas et al., 2012) is used. The integrated
protein—protein interactions from BioGRID (Stark et al., 2006) and the
manually curated human cancer signaling from (Awan et al., 2007; Cui
et al., 2007; Li et al., 2012; Newman 61 al., 2013) (available at http://www.
bri.nrc.ca/wang/) are clustered into functional protein—protein modules,
and each module is tested for enrichment (Fisher’s exact test, P< 0.01) of
the differentially expressed genes of the gene expression proﬁle of a dis-
ease. The enriched modules are then considered as disease susceptibility
modules, from which the highly interconnected genes are identiﬁed as the
disease-speciﬁc signaling network. Figure 3 shows the reconstructed sig-
naling network of lung adenocarcinoma.

(b) Functional drug target prediction using network-based
recommendation

Drugs often have multiple targets and affect distinct signaling modules,
but only parts of them are known for given drugs. The drug communities
embed targeting signaling modules (functional targets instead of physical
targets) of drugs. To uncover the targeting signaling modules of drugs,
we propose a network-based recommendation approach as follows. Let
D = {d1, d2,  , dm} denote drugs in a given community, and T =
{11, 12, . . . , tn} be the known drug targets. The drug—target interaction
network can be described as a bipartite graph G(D, T, E). The E indicates
the known drug and target associations. This drug—target network can be
represented by an adjacent matrix A: {611,-}an where aﬂ- is the weight
that quantiﬁes the association between d,- and tj. Then the novel network-
based algorithm is designed based on a bipartite network projection tech-
nique (Zhou et al., 2010) as follows.

R=F-.A (14)

where R: {rﬂnxm is the recommendation score (the functional associ-
ation possibility between drug 1' and target j). The F = {ﬁ'j}nxm indicates
the transition matrix from drug 1' to drug j and is deﬁned as:

1 m

(15)

 

Fig. 3. The reconstructed signaling network of lung adenocarcinoma.
Different node colors indicate different modules, and the node size indi-
cates the degree of nodes

where I‘(i,j)=k(t,-)1_Ak(tj)A and k(x) is the degree of the x node in the
bipartite network. Targets with recommendation scores greater than
given threshold, 0.1, are kept as the active functional targets of given
drugs.

(c) Disease-speciﬁc drug combination discovery

With the constructed disease signaling network and the predicted
drug targets, drug combinations are then prioritized by combining the
following synergistic scores. Given two candidate drugs, d,- and d],
from different clusters, suppose d,- e Ck and  6 Ch, and T1,:
{1H, tk2,...,tkm} denote the targets of d,- in Ck, and Th:
{0,1, thz, ...,thn} denote the targets of  in Ch. The ﬁrst synergistic
score is deﬁned as follows.

ZiCS(tk,-)exp(—D{ tki, T h }/ 712)
Zicsam)
+ Z.Cs<z.>exp<—D{rh. 2.1/m2)
chsahj)

where CS(tk,) is the centrality score of target 1k,- in the reconstructed
disease signaling network, and it is an additive of betweenness (Bn),
closeness (Cn) (Brandes and Fleischer, 2005) and PageRank (Pr) score
(Page et al., 1999) of protein tki, that is

CSUki) Z BnUki) + CnUki) + P V (tki) (17)

 

 Z
(16)

 

These are three different but correlated centrality measurements, and the
reason of combing them is to get a robust centrality score. The min D
{1}“; T h} is the minimum shortest path from 1k, to T h. The ﬁrst synergistic
score, S1 (1', j), prefers drug combinations, whose targets are in the center
(hubs) of disease signaling network and closely connected.

The second synergistic score is deﬁned as

“Sim (Ila; lhj)

520‘” Z W

(18)

where Sim(tki, thj) is the semantic similarity of gene ontology (GO) anno-
tations of 1k,- and thj (Couto et al., 2007), which is computed based on
the overlap of the GO terms that are associated with 1k,- and thj, and is
deﬁned as

2 logzmax{p(A)}

Freq(G0k,-) is the frequency of GO term GOk, occurring in GO annota-
tions, which are taken from GO database. MaxFreq is the maximum
occurrences frequency of GO terms that are associated with all the targets
and the predicted drug targets in the GO annotations. The second syn-
ergistic score, 52(1', j), prefers drug combinations that block genes with
similar functions, e.g. cell proliferation.

Finally, the synergistic score of drug d,- and  is given by

Sy(ivj) = (Si (131') + 52031)) - 6115031) (21)
where

dE(ivj):max{SG(ivj)v V  ' Ss(ivj)v  +  

where SG(i, j) reﬂects the distance of their expression pattern. In sum-
mary, drug combinations targeting on the disease-speciﬁc signaling
network, with similar functions, through alternative targets are
prioritized.

3 RESULTS

We have applied the BNMF,8D algorithm to cluster the drug—
drug network into overlapping drug communities. Table 1 lists
the parameters in the analysis. We set a as one of
{10,50,100,l50,200,250,300,350,400,450}, and b to be equal to
a. When a and b are set to be 450, the BNMF,8D algorithm
will converge more quickly. Under this setting of a and b, we
test the drug network community reconstruction results with dif-
ferent K and ,8, as K = {100,110,120,130,140,150,l60,l70} and
,8: {1, 2}. When K is 150 and ,8 is l, we get better drug commu-
nity structures in terms of the following deﬁned community qual-
ity measurements. We assign the number from 1 to 150 to each
drug community, and obtain the drug—target networks by con-
necting the drugs in the same community through their targets.
The connected drug—target networks provide us a useful way to
drug discovery.

3.1 Quality evaluation of predicted drug community

To evaluate the proposed approach, we compared it with three
widely used network partition approaches: Markov cluster
(MCL; Enright et al., 2002), afﬁnity propagation (AP; Frey
and Dueck, 2007) and CluterONE (Nepusz et al., 2012). To
evaluate the quality of the predicted drug community, the fol-
lowing three metrics are deﬁned. The average enrichment score,

.  SiNi p. .
SN, 1S deﬁned as SN =  ,where s, = #1, P,1s the number of
i=1 '

drug pairs sharing targets in the i-th drug community, N,- is the
number of drugs of that drug community and N is the number of
drug community. Higher SN value indicates more drugs in the
same community sharing common targets. The metric, SR, is
deﬁned as the relative number of well-connected drug commu-
nities S R =  where H is the number of elements, and d is
a given threshold. The geometric accuracy metric, SGA, is deﬁned
as the balance of the two metrics: SGA = x/SN - S R. The compari-
son result shown in Figure 4 shows that the proposed method
outperforms the other three methods in terms of all three metrics
with d = 0.6.

3.2 Drug combination prediction evaluation

To evaluate the prediction capacity of DrugComboRanker,
we apply it on the lung adenocarcinoma and endocrine
receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. The 107 lung
adenocarcinoma patient samples (58 lung tumor tissues and 49
normal lung tissues, GDS3257) were collected to reconstruct
the lung adenocarcinoma-speciﬁc signaling network, as
shown in Figure 3. This signaling network consists of
905 genes and 11282 interactions. Based on the signaling
network, we predict effective drugs that have synergistic effects
combined with three drugs (Geﬁtinib, Paclitaxel and LY-294002)
given by our clinicians. Level 3 gene expression data
of 222 ER positive breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA)
samples and 61 normal breast samples were collected
from TCGA. The synergistic drug combination with two
FDA-approved drugs, Tamoxifen and Letrozole, are further

To validate the prediction results, we searched the literature
evidence of the top 50 ranked combinations. Tables 241 show the
literature evidence of the effective drug combinations in our top
50 lists for lung adenocarcinoma. Surprisingly, 19 different drug
combinations have been reported to be synergistic combining
with Geﬁtinib, Paclitaxel and LY-294002 in non—small-cell
lung cancer. Tables 5 and 6 show the literature evidence of ef-
fective drug combinations in the top 50 lists for ER—positive

reported to be synergistic combining with Tamoxifen and
Letrozole. These results show the strong drug combination pre-
diction capacity of DrugComboRanker.

To make the evaluation fair and sound, we further compared
the predicted results with CDA, and a random combination
method (RCM), which randomly picks up 50 drugs from the
available drug lists to combine with the designated drugs. As
for CDA, we picked the top 50 drug combinations with the
designated drugs. Figures 5 and 6 show the comparison results
on the lung adenocarcinoma and ER-positive breast cancer in
terms of literature supports of those top-ranked 50 drug com-
binations, respectively (The numbers on the bars of RCM are
standard deviations). For RCM, we repeated the random selec-
tion 100 times; for each simulation, we checked the literature
evidence (In total, we checked all the 5000 random combin-
ations). As can be seen, the proposed approach outperforms
the CDA and random selection signiﬁcantly.

The predicted drug targets in the disease-speciﬁc network
could indicate the molecular mechanism of synergistic drug com-
binations. Here, we map the responsive genes of Geﬁtinib,
Paclitaxel, Vorinostat, LY-294002 and Quercetin to the lung
adenocarcinoma-speciﬁc signaling network to capture the dis-
tinct synergistic responses induced by three agent combinations,
Geﬁtinib and Paclitaxel, LY-294002 and Quercetin, Geﬁtinib
and Vorinostat. As shown in Figure 7, Geﬁtinib and Paclitaxel
combinations can affect the EGFR signaling pathway (endothe-
lial cell proliferation), TP53 signaling pathways, as well as

biological processes, such as cell cycle, apoptosis and the hub
genes, i.e. EGFR, TP53, SRC, FOS, JUN. Distinctly the LY-
294002 and Quercetin combination affects the alternative
EGFR, PI3K-AKT and JAK-STAT3 pathways, as can be seen
in Figure 8. In addition, the drug combination, Geﬁtinib and
Celecoxib, targets the EGFR and COX-2 signaling pathways,
respectively. The Geﬁtinib and Celecoxib have distinct transcrip-
tional responses that indicate EGFR and COX-2 signaling path-
ways are complementary, and have cross talks. Another example
is Geﬁtinib and Vorinostat combination. Vorinostat is a Histone
deacetylases inhibitor, as shown in Figure 9, which interacts with
CTNNBl, and CTNNBl interacts with E—cadherin, ERBB2 and
EGFR, whereas Geﬁtinib targets on EGFR. Thus, this combin-
ation forms a double inhibition on growth factors.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Drug combinations can provide an optimal cancer therapeutic
treatment by overcoming acquired drug resistance. Clinicians
usually choose drug combinations manually based on their ex-
perience and expertise. However, this expert-picking-based
method cannot be scaled up for discovering drug combinations
from a large set of drugs. The availability of genomic proﬁles of
drugs and patients are informative for uncovering the regulatory
signaling networks of cancers and the mechanisms of action of
drugs. However, the computational tools are the bottleneck to
interpret and convert the big genomics data into discovery of
drug combinations. In this study, we propose a novel computa-
tional tool, DrugComboRanker, to prioritize drug combin-
ations for speciﬁc cancers by selecting combinations targeting
the alternative and complementary signaling modules of disease.
We ﬁrst predict the functional targets of drugs via the network
community analysis of drug functional networks based on their
genomic proﬁles. We then deﬁne the synergistic score of drug
combinations that block key disease genes and their potential
cross talks. The new method can also provide insights into mech-
anism of actions of drug combinations by mapping the pre-
dicted drug targets on the disease signaling network. In our
case studies on lung adenocarcinoma and ER—positive breast
cancer cases, a set of top-ranked drug combinations, with similar
and distinct mechanisms of action, top-ranked in our predic-
tion list have been reported to be effective in anticancer treat-
ment. Moreover, a set of novel drug combinations are also
identiﬁed with a better anticancer treatment outcome. In conclu-
sion, the DrugComboRanker has the potential to be a widely
used software package for predicting new disease-speciﬁc drug
combinations.

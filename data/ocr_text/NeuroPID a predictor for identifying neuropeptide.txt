ABSTRACT

Motivation: The evolution of multicellular organisms is associated with
increasing variability of molecules governing behavioral and physio-
logical states. This is often achieved by neuropeptides (NPs) that are
produced in neurons from a longer protein, named neuropeptide pre-
cursor (NPP). The maturation of NPs occurs through a sequence of
proteolytic cleavages. The difficulty in identifying NPPs is a conse-
quence of their diversity and the lack of applicable sequence similarity
among the short functionally related NPs.

Results: Herein, we describe Neuropeptide Precursor Identifier
(NeuroPID), a machine learning scheme that predicts metazoan
NPPs. NeuroPID was trained on hundreds of identified NPPs from
the UniProtKB database. Some 600 features were extracted from
the primary sequences and processed using support vector machines
(SVM) and ensemble decision tree classifiers. These features com-
bined biophysical, chemical and informational—statistical properties
of NPs and NPPs. Other features were guided by the defining char-
acteristics of the dibasic cleavage sites motif. NeuroPID reached
89—94% accuracy and 90—93% precision in cross-validation blind
tests against known NPPs (with an emphasis on Chordata and
Arthropoda). NeuroPID also identified NPP-like proteins from exten-
sively studied model organisms as well as from poorly annotated
proteomes. We then focused on the most significant sets of features
that contribute to the success of the classifiers. We propose that NPPs
are attractive targets for investigating and modulating behavior, me-
tabolism and homeostasis and that a rich repertoire of NPs remains to
be identified.

1 INTRODUCTION

Peptides are known to be key modulators in behavior, sensation
and homeostasis (Brain and Cox, 2006). Biologically active pep-
tides that are produced and secreted from neurons and act to
modulate their function are collectively called peptide modula-
tors or neuropeptides (NPs). NPs represent a widespread mode
of communication that is found from Cnidarians to Bilaterians,

including mammals. NP precursors (NPPs) are subjected to regu-
lated cleavages that result in the production of functionally active
NPs. The processing of NPs occurs along the secretory pathway
(Gelman and Fricker, 2010). In most instances, NPs locally
modulate presynaptic or postsynaptic cell activity (Southey
et al., 2008). From a functional perspective, known effects of
NPs include stress control, pain perception, social behaviors
and sleep—wake cycle (Nassel, 2002). NPs also regulate food
uptake, maintaining appetite and body weight. The peripheral
NPs that act outside the central nervous system regulate gastro-
intestinal and immunological functions (Insel and Young, 2000).
For example, some NPs induce chemotactic response in attract-
ing immature dendritic cells to the site of inﬂammation. In this
context, substances P and K, two extensively studied NPs, induce
the production and release of inﬂammatory cytokines from
blood monocytes (Gonzalez-Rey et al., 2007). ‘Social’ NPs,
such as oxytocin and arginine vasopressin, regulate complex
social cognition and behavior (including pair-bonding, social rec-
ognition and maternal behavior) (Insel and Young, 2000). The
immense diversity among NPs contributes to the wide range of
behavioral tasks that are carried out.

A common feature for the majority of NPs is their production
from a larger precursor (NPP). The production of short bioactive
peptides is a result of a series of cleavages and maturation events
(Mirabeau et al., 2007). NPP can produce multiple copies of
different NPs (Mentlein and Dahms, 1994). Notably, a cluster
of basic residues speciﬁes these cleavage sites. The occurrence of
dibasic residues speciﬁes the canonical sites for intracellular
endopeptidases such as Furin (Veenstra, 2000). However, some
NPs that act in cell—cell communication (Funkelstein et al., 2010)
(e. g. cathepsin L) do not obey the dibasic residues speciﬁcity rule.
The identity and regulation of the key peptidases that are respon-
sible for the processing of the NPP remains an active research
ﬁeld.

NPs typically bind cell surface G—proteins coupled receptors
(GPCRs) that initiate a signaling cascade. An evolutionary ana-
lysis of NPPs and their cognate GPCRs suggested a diversiﬁca-
tion that occurred in certain taxonomical branches (Jekely,
2013). The NPs and their receptors are attractive targets for
drug development and translational medicine based on their
role in feeding, sexual behavior and cellular homeostasis (Brain
and Cox, 2006).

The goal of this research is to enable systematic identiﬁcation
of NPPs (and NPs) at a genome-wide scale. The difﬁculty in
identifying NPs and classifying genes as potential NPs stems
from the following: (i) Current gene annotation tools mostly

rely on sequence conservation traits (Loewenstein et al., 2009).
However, NPs that exhibit the same function may share minimal
sequence similarity (Clynen et al., 2010). Additionally, homolo-
gous NPPs may still produce NPs that are species-speciﬁc.
(ii) Structural inference tools (Lobley et al., 2009) fail when
applied to short peptides. Consequently, assigning functions to
known NPPs and identifying previously overlooked related genes
call for developing an alternative strategy. Furthermore, the
shortage of experimental validated sequences is large and grow-
ing. Thus, methods that are primarily based on rules extracted
from the limited number of known examples lack the ability to
generalize to unseen instances.

In this research, we applied a supervised machine learning
(ML) model based on extracting features directly from the pri-
mary sequence. Importantly, our method for identifying NPP
candidates is ‘alignment free’. Statistical support vector machine
(SVM) models and decision tree-based classiﬁers (e.g. Random
forests) were chosen as the preferred strategy (Nielsen et al.,
1999). We present Neuropeptide Precursor Identiﬁer
(NeuroPID), a predicting machine that was trained on a curated
set of NPPs. The high accuracy of NeuroPID was conﬁrmed
based on cross-validation (CV) tests. Furthermore, we selected
a sparse set of features that contributed maximally to the suc-
cessful classiﬁcation by NeuroPID. Finally, we provide a candi-
date list of NPP-related proteins. A list of ﬁltered NPP
predictions from the fruit ﬂy (Drosophila melanogaster), the
worm (Caenorhabditis elegans), the silkworm (Bombyx mom)
and the red imported ﬁre ant (Solenopsis invicta) is available at
www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/neuropid/results.

In addition, we analyzed the proteome of the honeybee (Apis
mellifera) and the Monarch butterﬂy (Danaus plexippus). The
NeuroPID code is available at www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/
neuropid.

2 METHODS

2.1 Protein databases and proteomes

The main database resource used in this study is UniProtKB (Dimmer
et al., 2012). The UniProtKB is composed of high-quality SW collection
(called ‘reviewed’) and the TrEMBL database that archives the protein
sequences from translated genomes. We collected all annotated NPPs by
using the keyword ‘Neuropeptide’ [KW-0527]. In the list of NPs, we
excluded NP receptors and sequences that are partial or the result of
proteolysis (i.e. annotated ‘Fragment’). Additional complete proteomes
that were included in this study are the honeybee (Amellifera), the
Monarch butterﬂy (D.plexippus), the silkworm (Bmori) as well as the
poorly annotated genome from the red imported ﬁre ant (Sjnvicta).
Most annotations were retrieved from UniProtKB. UniRef90 is a version
of UniProtKB where proteins having >90% sequence similarity are clus-
tered. Only one representative is considered from each cluster.

2.2 Training set

We collected the identiﬁed NPP sequences based on the annotation pro-
vided by UniProtKB (Dimmer et al., 2012). According to the notion of
supervised classiﬁcation task, the training phase calls for extracting fea-
tures from ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ sets. Known NPPs comprise the ‘posi-
tive’ set, whereas the ‘negative’ sequences have functions unrelated to NPs
(these are disjoint groups), wherein each sequence is a point in the high-
dimensional space and each is transformed into a collection of binary and
quantitative features.

Fig. 1. Allatostatin family from insects. (A) Ten active NPs that are
produced through cleavage of P85797 (UniProt) from A. mellifera. All
the peptides were identiﬁed by MS technology, ﬁve of them were mod-
iﬁed by amidation on Ile/Leu. (B) Sequences from the allatostatin family
from Lepidoptera (seqs 5—6), Orthoptera (seq 4) and Hymenoptera (seqs
0—3) were used to assess their relatedness using ClustalW2 (Larkin et al.,
2007). The sequence from Apis ﬂorea was used as a query (seq 0). It is
similar to that of the A. mellifera (95% identical amino acids).
(C) Multiple sequence alignment of sequences from the listed organisms.
The set of candidate bioactive peptides are framed (as in A). (D) The list
of organisms sorted by the number of annotated NPPs. Additional or-
ganisms (named as ‘Others’) are represented by a relatively small number
of NPPs. Most sequences belong to mammals (human, mouse, rat,
bovine and pig) and arthropods (crab, cockroach, ﬂies and mosquitoes)

The number of NP precursors in Metazoa is unknown. We demon-
strate the difﬁculty using a prototype of allatostatins from A. mellifera
(Fig. 1A—C). These NPs act to inhibit juvenile hormone biosynthesis and
reduce the food intake (Stay and Tobe, 2007). Figure 1A shows the
10 active NPs that are produced from the precursor (197 amino acids).
All 10 NPs were identiﬁed using a direct mass spectrometry (MS)
(Hummon et al., 2006). Based on a comparative study of several insects,
it is likely that most of the identiﬁed peptides are active as inhibitors of
juvenile hormone production (Stay and Tobe, 2007).

Several observations should be noted from the example in
Figure 1A—C. (i) The N’-terminal is occupied by signal sequences
(signal peptide [SP], yellow background) (Petersen et al., 2011). (ii) The

length of the identiﬁed NPs ranges from 7 to 35 amino acids. (iii) Peptides
may overlap. (iv) The ﬂanking dibasic cleavage site motif [KIR] governs a
cleavage signal for most identiﬁed peptides. (v) Glycine residue often
precedes the cleavage site and is not included in the ﬁnal peptide. The
C-terminal glycine amidation is known to be a common post-translation
modiﬁcation for NPs (Merkler, 1994). Despite the complex processing of
the allatostatin precursor, the abundance of dibasic motifs and their con-
servation is rather unique and seems to be a strong corollary for NP
candidates (Veenstra, 2000). We assess the sequence similarity among
insects that express allatostatin (Fig. 1B). Although the sequences of
the NPs and the linkers between NPs show a low sequence similarity,
the dibasic signals that are used as cleavage sites are conserved (Fig. 1C).

For the training phase, two non-redundant ‘positive’ sets were used:
(i) 675 reviewed sequences from SwissProt (SW) according to their
UniRef90 clusters and (ii) 2587 sequences from UniProtKB (combined
non-reviewed and reviewed sets from TrEMBL and SW, respectively)
according to their UniReflOO clusters. The organisms that dominate
the list of known NPs from SW-UniRef90 are shown in Figure 1D.
Several non-overlapping ‘negative’ sets were compiled based on the
same length distributions and an identical composition of organisms
with respect to the NP-curated set (i.e. ‘positive’). We also kept the ran-
domly selected negative set’s proteins to within 100—150% of the size of
the positive set.

2.3 Binary and quantitative features

Our goal was to deﬁne a set of features that would be instrumental in
identifying NPPs. Importantly, all calculated features relied solely on the
pre-pro-protein’s primary sequence. The properties that rely on external
predictors (e. g. 3D structural fold, secondary structure) or search engines
(e.g. sequence similarity, evolutionary distance scores) were excluded. In
the same line, we ignored known functional attributes (e.g. GO annota-
tion enrichment). Short motifs that were extracted are guided by the
proteolytic cleavage preferences. We also included some signatures that
cover additional post-translational modiﬁcations such as amidation.

The features that were extracted from the ‘positive’ sets of NPPs are
partitioned to several types:

(A) Biophysical quantitative properties:

(i) Molecular weight.

(ii) Charged amino acids occurrence.

(iii) Sequence length.

(iv) Isoelectric point (P1).

(v) Aromaticity (The relative frequency of Phe, Trp, Tyr).

(vi) Amino acid usage (20 features).

(vii) Bigrams pair from the calculated dipeptide frequencies (400
features).

(viii) The instability index—an estimate for the stability of a protein
in vitro (Wilkins et al., 1999).

(ix) GRAVY (Grand Average of Hydropathy)—the sum of hydrop-
athy values of all amino acids, divided by the number of residues
in the analyzed sequence (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982).

(x) Aliphatic index—the relative volume occupied by aliphatic side
chains Ala, Val, Ile and Leu (Wilkins et al., 1999). These proper-
ties have been shown to be informative and valuable for the
classiﬁcation tasks.

Most properties were derived from EXPASY prediction tools (Artimo
et al., 2012). We complemented the prediction tools from Biopython
(Cock et al., 2009) and Python (version 2.7). The power of these glo-
bal features to predict function has been previously validated
(Varshavsky et al., 2007). The features from this section that exhibited
substantial signiﬁcance (P—value of <0.01) were included in the ML train-
ing phase.

(B) Binary features:

This group of features aims to capture the non-randomized appearance of
certain amino acids within short windows. The binary features were suc-
cessfully used for identifying secreted short toxin-like proteins (Tirosh
et al., 2012) in a large set of genomes (Naamati et al., 2010).
Speciﬁcally, it is designed as a 5-mers (k-mer) sliding window (2‘5 2 32
features). A sequence is divided into 5-mers. The binary 5-mer was used
for the following groups:

(i) Charged group—Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg, His (D,E,R,H,K).
(ii) Charged-polar group—Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg, Asn, Gln
(D,E,R,K,N,Q).
(iii) GKR (G: Gly).
(iv) Basic residues—Lys, Arg (K,R).

In each case, the ‘relevant group’ of amino acids was signed as 1,
whereas the other amino acids were signed as 0. Most solid information
on NPs along their evolutionary tree concerns their precursors’ cleavage
model (Southey et al., 2006).

The speciﬁcity of cleavage sites was deﬁned according to the appear-
ance of the following:

o *-*-Lys-Lys#
o *-*-Lys-Arg#
o *-*-Arg—Arg#
o Arg-*-*-Lys#
o Arg-*-*- Arg#

Where the # and * denote a cleavage site and other amino acids, re-
spectively. We generalized the code to adapt it for a more relaxed deﬁn-
ition. For example, the feature for the suspected cleavage site was
formulated by the motif using the ‘**[R or K] [R or K]’ and ‘R**[R or
K]; (lysine = K, arginine: R)’ [known motif model (Southey et al., 2006;
Veenstra, 2000)].

(C) Information-based statistics:

C.I. Amino acid entropy ( 20 features): This set of features captures a
property that demonstrates how non-randomly distributed each amino
acid is in the sequence, based on the concept of molecular information
entropy (Schneider, 2010). For a given sequence S amino acid type C, we
mark its position in the sequence p1, . . . , pk

The length of S and the number of C in the S are marked k and m,
respectively.

We deﬁne that p0 = 0 and pk+1 = m +1
We deﬁne the entropy of C to be

k+l

_ Pi _Pi—l> (Pi _Pi—l>
I 9 — E — l —
en r0py(c S) i=1 ( m og2 m

C.2. Autocorrelation: This measure was calculated for certain amino
acids that were calculated from the Bigram frequencies. The intuition
stems from the observation of a consistent spacing of certain residues
or short liner motifs (e.g. KK).

C.3. Over- and underrepresentation of motifs along the sequences: We
marked the density of ‘interesting’ motifs in the sequence (normalized to
the sequence length). Such motif ‘counts’ included the following:

(i) Canonic cleavage sites based on the known motif model
(Southey et al., 2006).
(ii) Potential site for N—glycosylation, formulated as [N]—[not P]-[S/
T/C].
(iii) Potential aspartic acid and asparagine hydroxylation sites.

(iv) The high preference of certain amino acids in the vicinity of
suspect proteolytic dibasic cleavage sites. Speciﬁcally, we count
the tandem pair R/K and the adjacent amino acids (separated
into amino acid equivalence groups. Note that several amino
acids appear in several groups—‘FYW’, ‘P’, ‘C’, ‘RHK’, ‘DE’,
‘CSTMNQ’, ‘RK’, ‘ST’ and ‘EKRDNQH’). We count the ap-
pearance in 1—2 positions that preceded or succeeded the
[KR][KR] cleavage motif.

All classical NPs (as well as some of the non-classical ones) are secreted
proteins (i.e. with SP but not transmembrane domain) that undergo pro-
cessing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Note that SP in all secretory
proteins must be removed before the production of the precursor protein
(Nielsen et al., 1999). We did not include the SP as a feature in the
training phase.

3 IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 ML tools

Proteins were labeled ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ according to the
database in SwissProt (SW, ‘reviewed’ sequences). A two-
sample Kohnogorov—Smimov (KS) test was used to compare
the distributions of values with respect to the background fre-
quencies of all SW proteins. In addition, the variance for the
‘positive’ and ‘negative’ sets was calculated and used for deﬁning
the statistical signiﬁcance of the distributions. A two-sample
t—test was applied to compare the means of each distribution
and to identify inherent differences.

There are several commonly used kernels that can be used
in the ML scheme (Amari and Wu, 1999). Most notably are
(i) the linear kernel: [u’*v], (ii) polynomial kernel [(gam-
ma*u’*v+coef0)‘degree] and (iii) non-linear RBF (radial basis
function) kernel: e(-gamma*ju—vj’2) (Amari and Wu, 1999).

A speciﬁc kernel or overall approach may be more or less
suitable, depending on the case at hand (Lewis et al., 2006;
Seeger, 2004). We experimented with a few of the routinely
used kernel functions including the linear kernel, 2D and 3D
degree polynomial kernel and the (non-linear) Gaussian RBF
kernel in combination with a support vector classiﬁcation
(SVC) machine. These methods were initially chosen for their
robustness, good programmatic support and resistance to over-
ﬁtting. The resistance of the different classiﬁcation and boosting
methods to the ‘curse of dimensionality’ (given a small number of
samples and numerous features) was extensively studied (Har-
Peled et al., 2012).

We used LibSVM, a general library for SVC and regression
(http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm). ML programs are
based on SVM and are implemented in the Matlab software
toolkit (Zhao et al., 2009). The scikit-learn toolkit implements
it in the Python programming language (Pedregosa et al., 2011).
The performance of the SVM for parameter selection was
tested. We used the LibSVM toolkit for exploring the hyper-
parameter space. The selected parameter includes the penalty
parameter C and the kernel parameter y (gamma) of the REF
function (Fan et al., 2008). The dependency of the ML predictor
on the selected toolkit was noted but the impact on the re-
sults was found to be negligible and will not be discussed
further.

3.2 Transforming sequences into features and statistics

We extracted features directly from the primary sequences and
then used them to train an SVM. Recall that the performance of
NeuroPID depends strongly on the set of features that were ex-
tracted from each of the previously identiﬁed NPPs as well as the
negative sets that were used for training. SVM methods are re-
sistant to possible overﬁtting or dimensionality, allowing a
framework to examine the feature space’s predictive power, with-
out the need to stringently remove ‘noisy’ or potentially weak
features in advance. We transformed various biochemical traits
of the protein sequences into quantitative features (as described
in Section 2.3).

The features that were found to be signiﬁcant in the statistical
tests are listed (Fig. 2). We examined each of the biochemical
features before training the ML. The quantitative traits’ statis-
tical signiﬁcance was a condition of their inclusion as features (as
described in Section 2.3). Most of the features were statistically
signiﬁcant (2-sided t—test, or = 0.01 or KS test <0.01). Exceptions
to the latter were the instability index (P2036), the GRAVY
(P:0.41) and amino acid frequencies of Cys (P:0.72), His
(P:0.04), Asp (P=0.25) and Asn (P:0.88). A complete list
of features and their statistical signiﬁcant appearance in NPs
versus the general proteins’ background is available in
Supplementary Data S1.

Figure 2 shows the statistical information for 20 amino acids
occurrence (Fig. 2A) and several biophysical properties (Fig. 2B).
The most individual signiﬁcant feature is the occurrence of lysine
(K, P<1.0e-83).

3.3 NeuroPID—a discovery tool

A schematic ﬂow of the research is shown in Figure 3. Brieﬂy,
the input to NeuroPID is a set of sequences, each described by
hundreds of features. Some of the ML methods when applied to
complete proteomes, containing thousands of proteins, resulted
in hundreds of predictions (not shown). To reduce false positives
(FPs), we applied SP prediction [SignalP 4.0 (Petersen et al.,
2011)]. Recall that the occurrence of SP was not used as a fea-
ture, but only as a ﬁlter to reﬁne the ﬁnal list of predicted ‘can-
didate’ NPPs.

Fig. 3. A protocol for NPP prediction using NeuroPID. The working
protocol is composed of three sections: (i) collecting the proteome-scale
full-length sequences (ORFs); (ii) training and testing the performance
of the ML; (iii) assessment of the predictions and the candidate NPPs.
A reﬁned list of predicted NPPs is created by ﬁltering out sequences
that lack SP at their N’-terminal segments

An additional ﬁlter that was used to reduce the false-positive
prediction takes advantage of the existing tools for predicting the
cleavage sites that lead to the production of active NP peptides
(Southey et al., 2006, 2008). Thus, we tested the output of
NeuroPID as input to cleavage site prediction tools.

The acquisition of the dataset from UniProtKB (Dimmer
et al., 2012) and the generation of the feature data from
FASTA format sequences were done using the BioPython library
(Cock et al., 2009). Python (www.python.org) and Matlab code
for the implementation are available on request.

3.4 Cross-validations

We randomly split the sequences and carried out 6-fold cross-
validation (CV). A substantial fraction of the data (i.e. 10—40%)
was used as a disjoint set and was not included at the training
phase. The results of the CV tests for each of the NPP candidates
were summed up to estimate the accuracy, sensitivity, precision
and area under ROC curve (AUC). We used the default statis-
tical deﬁnitions:

Accuracy 2 TP —I— TN/TP + FP + TN + FN
Precision = TP/TP —I— FP

Recall = TP/TP —I— FN.

After having generated the features data from the various
datasets, we set up the ML. We initially applied a linear SVM
machine. We estimated the performance and success of NP pre-
diction in a 5-fold CV test. The accuracy rate for NP identiﬁca-
tion (out of a given set of proteins) in the CV tests reached a level
of 82—89% accuracy. The range captures the variation on the
machine method, the kernels and the parameters used. The CV
tests for precision and recall yielded 73—91% and 77—82%, re-
spectively. The AUC for all methods is a robust measure that
ranges from 82 to 87%. To prevent overﬁtting, we only used

Fig. 4. CV tests for NPs using the complete non-redundant set from
UniProtKB. Numerous classiﬁcation models support the high accuracy
and precision in the CV tests. The variations of the results in repeated

30—40% of the data for training and for testing the aforemen-
tioned parameters. Additionally, the reported results were based
on balanced ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ training sets (1166 se-
quences in each set, Fig. 4).

We further examined the robustness of the ﬁndings in terms of
the number of FPs and false negatives (FN) by repeating the CV
phase with different protocols. We varied the fraction of the
trained set to account for only 60—90% of the input, and re-
peated the test multiple times, leaving out different random sub-
samples each time. The input includes all NPs (at 90 and 100%
identity, non-redundant set). In all tests, the results were stable as
conﬁrmed by repeating the protocols several times with inde-
pendent ‘negative’ sets. Figure 4 shows the results from different
classiﬁers and boosting models for 6-fold CV tests.

We repeated the CV tests using alternative kernels (polynomial
’2 and ’3 kernel), a stochastic gradient descent SVM and a non-
linear model (called SVC—RBF). All these changes resulted in
similar results (Fig. 4). The use of more complex polynomial
kernel models increased the run-time substantially with a min-
imal improvement of the results (as measured by AUC).
Thus, we continued to analyze models using Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting and Extra Trees ensemble decision trees, as
well as the ‘best’ classiﬁcation SVM models (SVC-RBF, and
linear SVC).

The CV tests for numerous classiﬁcation models for the anno-
tated NPs reported a high level of accuracy. An AUC value of
0.82—0.87 was reached for all NPPs in UniProtKB and used as a
baseline for training of the NeuroPID (Fig. 4). Recall that the
performance of the NeuroPID depends strongly on the set of
features that were included in building the model (the ‘Feature
Space’). Such information was determined and measured during
the ML training phase. Inclusion of physiochemical traits was
reliant on statistical analysis for signiﬁcance. Features that
showed no signiﬁcant differences in the statistical tests (KS-
test/t-test, Fig. 2) were not included in the ML scheme.

Before activation of ‘new prediction’ scheme, additional CV
tests were performed while the training phase was repeated vary-
ing ‘negative’ sets, alternative kernels function and extensive

parameter tuning. Results were normalized to provide measure-
ment for the accuracy (deﬁned by the precision and the recall) for
the various models.

To assess the robustness of NeuroPID, we repeated the pro-
cedure of tuning a predicting machine by selecting alternative
‘negative’ sets. We performed it for the ‘negative’ set of secretory
proteome (SP or TMD comtaining proteins) and the proteins
composed of nuclear proteins. The rationale behind the selection
of the later set was to provide a ‘challenging’ set in which the
inherent appearance of basic residues prevails (e. g. histons, tran-
scription factors). The performance in a 6-fold CV test remained
high, with AUC for the different models ranging from 0.86 to
0.88.

3.5 Taxonomy-based CV

Once the ML was trained and tested, we examined unseen ex-
amples derived from complete proteomes. We deﬁned the task as
identifying unseen NPPs for sequences that belong to speciﬁc
taxa (e.g. Chordata and arthropods). We repeated the tests by
training the ML from SW or UniProtKB (see Section 2). In all
cases, only representative sequences from UniRef90 clusters were
used. The results are summarized in Table 1.

The high performance of the CV for the Arthropoda and
Chordata shows that restricting the prediction to any speciﬁc
taxa increased the performance in almost all instances. A careful
analysis shows that the improved performance for arthropods is
mainly in the Recall and Precision (improvement of >10% when
compared with the analysis for all the NP sequences to the taxa-
based analysis). Importantly, all classiﬁcation models (three
methods, Table 1) show a similar trend in the CV test in view
of the performance of the general analysis (Fig. 4). Note that as
can be anticipated, the CV tests outperformed for the SW col-
lection in the taxa-based analysis.

A similar performance was recorded by using a larger set
of the redundant NPP collection. The rest of the predictions
were performed on the basis of the non-redundant UniProt
collection.

3.6. Post-training feature selection in NeuroPID

Several methods for supervised feature selection can be applied
to identify the minimal set of features that contribute maximally
to the rich model underlying the NeuroPID performance.

The initial set (see Section 2.3) included 561 features. We
applied a 10—20% step reduction with a L1 loss function. The
results from analysis via RFECV function (Pedregosa et al.,
2011). The function is based on feature ranking with recursive
feature elimination and 3-fold stratiﬁed cross-validated selection
for the best number of features. The RFECV function, imple-
mented with 10% feature elimination per step, identiﬁed 13
‘strong’ features. Repeating the protocol and setting a step re-
duction for 30 features in each step, resulted in 21 selected fea-
tures. A similar procedure, recursive feature elimination
proposed 15 features. Checking the identity of these features re-
vealed an overlapping core set of features, shared by most of the
aforementioned feature extraction methods. A degree of ran-
domality is expected and unavoidable, given a robust set of
non-sparse features, combined with decision trees. Hence, the
variability. Applying principle component analysis for identify-
ing the most informative features is guided by geometrical con-
siderations for compression into a sparse feature space. It led to
22 features that are both sparse and informative. A uniﬁed list of
23 highly informative features that are consistent between the
feature extraction methods and the principle component analysis
method includes molecular weight, counts of potential cleavage
sites, binary appearance in 5-mer window for the speciﬁc appear-
ance of KR (5 of 32 combinations), GKR (3/32 combinations),
charged residues (7/32 combinations) and the entropy level for
G, N and P. Interestingly, none of the 400 features of the bigram
(dipeptide frequency) had been selected in the feature extraction
method. For a detailed analysis of informative features see
Supplementary Data S2.

3.7 NeuroPID models for insect proteomes

The NeuroPID was tested with several organisms on complete
proteomes, ranging from 10K for A. mellifera to almost 40K for
D. melanogaster. Several ML methods (Random forest, Extra

Tree classiﬁer, SVC-RBF, linear SVC and Gradient Boosting)
were applied on the complete proteomes in an unﬁltered mode
resulting in a large number of weak predictions (1—5K NPP pre-
diction for a proteome). Including a probability threshold leads
to a drastic reduction in the output, marking only the top ranked
predictions. For example, in the Random Forest protocol, a
‘certenty’ threshold of 0.99 reduced the unﬁltered predictions
for B. mori from >4000 to only 16 positive results results.
Similarly, the application of Gradient Boosting (GBR) protocol
for the Monarch butterﬂy (16183 sequences, 4856 predictions)
reduced the number of predictions 10-fold at a 99.5% threshold.

NeuroPID was activated with SVM and decision tree classiﬁer
methodologies to identify novel candidate NPPs. The NeuroPID
results for NPPs from the silkworm, ﬂy, worm and ﬁre ant are
found in www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/neuropid/results/.

Table 2 summarizes the prediction results from NeuroPID for
a ﬁltered input. In all cases, the proteins that are annotated as
NPs were eliminated from the training phase to avoid ‘trivial’
predictions. The ﬁlters include (i) consistency for all four of the
prediction methods (Extra Trees, RBF SVM, linear SVM and
Gradient Boosting); (ii) presence of SP in the sequence; (iii) the
sequences are full-length (not fragment). Filters (ii) and (iii) are
based on the annotations from UniProtKB. We illustrate the
results for proteomes that are extremely well annotated (worm,
fruit ﬂy) and proteomes that are poorly annotated (ﬁre ant, silk-
worm). A common ﬁnding across the proteomes is the functional
enrichment of innate immunity, some structural proteins as well
as hormones and NPs. However, FPs that include short ligands
and some receptors remain. Adding the ‘certenty threshold’ (see
above) and a conﬁrmation for high probability cleavage of the
sequence, using tools such as NeuroPred (Southey et al., 2006) is
the preferred protocol to reduce the number of FF predictions.

We further analyzed the results for additional proteomes.
Figure 5 shows the results and the consistency level among the
methodologies that were applied. The consistency among the
decision tree classiﬁers was speciﬁcally high. Considering all
four mentioned methods, we identiﬁed eight sequences that
were supported by at least three of them for A. mellifera. A
similar trend was found for the analysis of T haumeledone gunteri)
(Fig. 5). In such instances, the annotated NPP sequences were
excluded from the training phase.

One of the sequences that was consistently identiﬁed by the
different ML methods is an uncharacterized sequence from
A. mellifera (UniProt: H9K152, 183 amino acids). We propose
that this sequence is an overlooked NPP. (i) It is a secreted pro-
tein. (ii) The most signiﬁcant conservation motif of the dibasic
sequences dominates the sequence. (iii) Using MS identiﬁcation,
a 52-amino acid peptide belonging to the full-length ORF was
identiﬁed in the honeybee brain extract (Audsley and Weaver,
2006). (iv) Pfam resource (Punta et al., 2012) identiﬁed an evo-
lutionary domain that is associated with active peptides
from frog, ﬁsh and mammals. The CRF domain
(corticotropin—releasing factor) is postulated in stress and anx-
iety, osmolarity, thermoregulation, growth and metabolism in
mammals.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 NeuroPID performance

The set of NPs that are produced from a single NPP often share
little sequence resemblance but a strong functional coherence.
Thus, it is evident that the functionality of the NPs cannot be
assessed without considering their cognate GPCRs that act as
signaling receptors (Jekely, 2013).

In this study, we only considered the sequence features of the
NPPs from UniProtKB. The goal of this research is to identify
NPPs (and related proteins) in a genomic scale. We show that
despite the fact that SP sequences were not included as a feature
in the training phase, we were able to successfully identify many
of the NPPs from an input of secreted proteome (not shown).
Based on this ﬁnding, we conﬁrm that the information captured
by the selected features (~600 individual features) provides rich
information for a high-performing predictor.

In ML-based methodologies, the properties and relative size of
the ‘negative’ set is of utmost importance (Ben-Hur et al., 2008).
We repeated the training and learning phases using a ‘negative’
set that includes a matched length distribution from secretory
proteins (i.e. contains SP/TMD that are not NPs). It resulted
in an excellent performance in the CV test (AUC = 0.94).

To overcome any possible overﬁtting, we repeated the training
and learning phases after removal of a large set of features, and
with an unbiased negative training set. Speciﬁcally, we removed
the bigram (400 features) and a number of amino acids preﬁx/
sufﬁx groups, leaving ~152 features. In this new setting, we used
both a larger set for the training phase (>1165 ‘positive’ in-
stances) and a controlled set. We overcame the pitfall of over-
ﬁtting by using an unbiased ‘negative’ training set. Improved
training performance was achieved using the aforementioned
larger more heterogenous UniProt ‘positive’ set (~2600 proteins,
AUC = 0.82—0.91), and testing performance (identiﬁcation of
true negatives) was signiﬁcantly improved as well. Based on
the above observations, we concluded that pruning for a limited
set of features (by different methodologies of feature ranking and
elimination) results in high performance of the NeuroPID and an
improved run time while not deteriorating the predictive power.
The procedure and the machine performance remained robust
for a wide range of tuned parameters.

Inspecting the results of the NPP predictions shows the need to
remove FPs. Many of the predicted NPPs are named
‘uncharacterized’, but also receptor proteins, enzymes and even
nuclear proteins are listed among the top predictions. Filtration
of FPs takes advantage of the consistency among independent
methods (Table 2, Fig. 5). For example, proteolytic products
(Zhang and Zhu, 2012) that act as antimicrobial peptides were
identiﬁed among the top predictions from S. invicta (e. g. I2E7P6,
I2E7P4). These sequences were predicted by all the tested ML
methods (GBR, RF, Ext-Tree and SVM-SVC). Submitting these
sequences to NeuroPred (Southey et al., 2006) further reduces the
FPs. NeuroPred reports the probabilities for proteolytic cleav-
ages that are essential for the formation of NPs.

We illustrate the analysis for 89 proteins from C. elegans
(Table 2). We ﬁrst tested the occurrence of genuinely known
NPPs in the ﬁltered list. There are 10 NPPs that belong to several
families: insulin-like peptides (3), FMRF-neuropeptides (5) and
neuropeptide-like (npl) proteins (2). In addition, there are nine
proteins that are named ‘uncharacterized’.

We then submitted the combined list of NPP candidates (with
agreement of all 4 ML methods, Table 2) to NeuroPred (Southey
et al., 2006). Inspecting the probability of cleavage according to
NeuroPred (Southey et al., 2006) shows only four proteins that
have no predicted cleavage sites. Interestingly, two of them are
NPPs (npl-28 and npl-30) that have non-canonical cleavage sites.
For the rest of the proteins, many high probability cleavage sites

(NeuroPred threshold >0.8) were identiﬁed (~11 /protein). We
observed that it is not the overall high probability of cleavage
sites but the sites’ density (i.e. number of sites/ 100 amino acids)
that characterize known NPPs. The uncharacterized proteins:
P34639 (ZK512.1) and P52881 (F46C5.2) have a high density
of potential protolytic sites. Although a functional validation
for these sequences is missing, the distinct developmental expres-
sion and a resemblance to proteins that function in intercellular
interactions are evident. Additional protein from the C. elegans
list that shares some characteristics with NPPs is P91573
(Warthog protein 6). The protein is subjected to a process of
autocleavage. The resultant peptides are active in intercellular
signaling.

4.2 MS-validated NPs

The experimental validation for NPPs is mostly based on the
identiﬁcation of NPs through a peptide identiﬁcation scheme
using MS (Svensson et al., 2007). The impact of the MS technol-
ogies in the ﬁeld of NP identiﬁcation cannot be underestimated
(Altstein and Nassel, 2010; Hummon et al., 2006; Ons et al.,
2011). However, the short length of NPs, the complex set of
partially cleaved products and the abundance of post-translation
modiﬁcations result in low coverage of NPs. The matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS has been successfully
used to identify hundreds of NPs from a single or multiple neu-
rons. Together with other MS technologies (e.g. electrospray
ionization techniques), a large collection of short peptides be-
comes available (Skold et al., 2007). The bulk of the peptide
spectra may include cytokines, growth factors, antimicrobial
peptides, toxin-like proteins (Tirosh et al., 2013) and protein
degradation intermediates. However, the challenge remains to
successfully identify the subset of modulatory NP peptides
from accurate tandem MS data.

To this end, peptide-centric databases were developed for
accelerating the identiﬁcation process from complex biological
samples [SwePepe (Falth et al., 2006); NeuroPedia (Kim et al.,
2011)]. These resources include thousands of potential peptides
(and their modiﬁed versions). A complementary database arch-
ives annotated bioactive peptides according to their functional
groups [PeptideDB (Liu et al., 2008)]. Importantly, matching a
short peptide to a complete proteome from a multicellular or-
ganism may not satisfy the minimal signiﬁcant threshold (Noble
and MacCoss, 2012). In this study, we propose NeuroPID as an
initial layer of ﬁltration. The user is encouraged to search for a
peptide match among the ﬁltered collection of NPP candidates
using NP prediction tools and knowledge-based resources.

In this study, we mainly focused on identifying insect NPPs
from model organisms (e.g. fruitﬂy) and from a number of
poorly annotated proteomes (e. g. ant). At present, the most com-
plete annotations for NPs rely on data from MS technology. The
peptidome of brain and hemolymph from D. malenogaster re-
vealed ~30 peptides, some of which are genuine NPs (Schoofs
and Baggerman, 2003). When applied to A. mellifera, >200 NPs
from 36 genes were reported, of which about half were conﬁrmed
experimentally. The metabolic states and the behavior of insects
are dictated by the compositions of NPs. Consequently, high
coverage identiﬁcation of NPs is of a great importance to the
biotechnology industry (Altstein, 2001).

Prediction of neuropeptide precursors

 

Differently from most proteins for which homology search is a
powerful technique for functional inference (Loewenstein et al.,
2009), the inference of validated NPs is limited to closely related
species. Recently, a collection of NPs from MS experiments in
C. elegans was successfully used to reveal the conservation of
NPs in Caenorhabditis briggsae (Husson et al., 2009). In view
of the MS-based discovery for insects, the NeuroPID provides
a robust method that is insensitive to sequence similarity. We
suggest applying NeuroPID as a ﬁrst step in the discovery work-
ﬂow (Fig. 3). It presents a putative list of NPPs for newly
sequenced genomes. The list of top candidates can be further
reﬁned using available prediction tools. For example,
NeuroPred (Southey et al., 2006) provides the probability of
the proteolytic site along the length of the precursor sequence.

4.3 NeuroPID annotations of unexplored genomes

We present NeuroPID, a robust method for identifying NPPs on
a proteome-wide scale. Arthropods are a taxon in which NPPs
expanded to provide a large collection of bioactive peptides that
execute social and behavioral tasks.

The efﬁciency and quality of gene annotation and especially
experimental validated proteins lags behind the explosion in
sequencing. Identifying NPPs is important not only for the
sake of increasing annotation coverage but also as a mean to
regulate insect social behavior, metabolic state and communica-
tion. In this view, an exciting genomic initiative with the goal of
sequencing 5000 social insects genomes was recently announced
(Robinson et al., 2011). The expectation is that NeuroPID will be
a valuable contribution in identifying components that govern
the behavior and elements of insect communication. The predict-
ive power of NeuroPID is expected to improve along with the
increase in the coverage of NPPs, mainly from MS experimental
data. We expect that the analysis presented in this study will be
useful in leveraging future expansions of the protein space.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Normal development of multicellular organisms is
regulated by a highly complex process in which a set of
precursor cells proliferate, differentiate and move, forming over
time a functioning tissue. To handle their complexity, developmental
systems can be studied over distinct scales. The dynamics of each
scale is determined by the collective activity of entities at the scale
below it.

Results: I describe a multi-scale computational approach for
modeling developmental systems and detail the methodology
through a synthetic example of a developmental system that retains
key features of real developmental systems. I discuss the simulation
of the system as it emerges from cross-scale and intra-scale
interactions and describe how an in silico study can be carried out by
modifying these interactions in a way that mimics in vivo experiments.
I highlight biological features of the results through a comparison with
findings in Caenorhabditis elegans germline development and finally
discuss about the applications of the approach in real developmental
systems and propose future extensions.

the synthetic developmental system can be found in www.wisdom.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many developmental systems in multicellular organisms are
regulated by a small set of precursor cells that proliferate,
differentiate and move to form a functioning tissue (He et al., 2009;
Laird et al., 2008; Robert, 2004). Developmental systems embody a
highly dynamic and complex process, which advances in numerous
individual cells simultaneously. Molecular interactions over a
complex regulatory network drive the development by orchestrating
cell—extrinsic cues and cell—intrinsic regulation (Dada and Mendes,
2011). However, due to hurdles in in vivo experimentations, data
in developmental biology are largely static, and the granularity
of knowledge about timing and function of cellular mechanisms
remains coarse (Dada and Mendes, 2011).

Analysis and study of developmental systems can be done
over distinct scales: organism, tissue, cell, molecule, gene, etc.

(Cohen and Harel, 2007). These scales are not merely a matter
of zooming in and out. Rather, scales introduce the concept of
emergent behavior: the behavior at a speciﬁc scale that is not
explicitly expressed in any of the elements at the lower scale
and results from their collective activity (Cohen and Harel, 2007).
The activity of a tissue, for example, emerges from the collective
activity of the individual cells that comprise it. Similarly, cell
activity emerges from the collective molecular interactions over the
regulatory network.

Three hierarchical scales, molecular, cellular and tissue, are
important in the analysis of developmental systems (Dada and
Mendes, 2011; Setty et al., 2008). At the molecular scale, an
intracellular regulatory network controls molecular mechanisms
such as gene expression, receptor activity and protein degradation.
Above the molecular scale is the cellular scale where each individual
cell decides on its next developmental step, i.e. proliferation, fate
determination and motility. Further above is the tissue level where
the cell population acts in concert to develop its anatomy and
function. Activity at each scale drives behaviors at the above and
below scales. For instance, interactions in the regulatory network at
the molecular scale determine, at the cellular scale, individual cell
decision—making. These, in turn, collectively stimulate anatomical
formation at the tissue scale. Conversely, the position of a cell
in the tissue determines which cell—extrinsic cues it detects and
the decisions it makes. A change in elements at one scale may
signiﬁcantly affect the activity at other scales, resulting in an altered
development.

Multi—scale modeling is gaining increased focus in computational
biology (Edelman et al., 2010; Maus et al., 2011; Meier—
Schellersheim et al., 2009; Palsson, 2000). It served to study
various biological systems, including the electrical activity of the
heart (Noble, 2002), the function of the lungs (Tawhai and Bates,
2011) and the multi—physical phenomena that govern cortical bone
behavior (Lemaire et al., 2011). However, most of these studies
focus on function and physiology of the adult tissue and often do
not handle dynamic aspects of the development.

The approach presented here tackles dynamics and emergence in
the process of development. The approach models developmental
systems by structuring known biological information in designated
elements in each scale: (i) molecular mechanisms implicated in
the regulatory network are formalized at the molecular scale, (ii)
proliferation, fate determination and motility are deﬁned as decision—
making at the cellular scale and (iii) anatomic constraints and
cell—extrinsic cues are deﬁned at the tissue scale in a grid that
overlays the structure. Cross—scale interactions are modeled as
events that emanate from element in one scale and are translated to
events at the other scales. The collective intra— and cross—scale events

Multi-scale modeling of developmental biology

 

drive the simulation over time yielding a dynamic representation of
the process.

To illustrate the underlying principles of the approach, I discuss
a model of a synthetic developmental system. The synthetic system
is intended to simplify the complexity of developmental systems by
abstracting key elements in the process. Thus, it generalizes common
mechanisms in many developmental and stem—cell systems (Robert,
2004; Yener et al., 2008). A biological system that particularly
illustrates the reality of the synthetic developmental system is
the Caenorhabditis elegans germline development (Hubbard and
Greenstein, 2000). This developmental system was modeled and
analyzed using the presented approach and provided insights and
predictions that were validated in a subsequent in vivo study (Setty
et al., 2012).

In this article, I describe the general framework and the way in
which each scale of the system is formalized. I then describe how the
overall dynamic development emerges over time from cross—scale
activity. I highlight the concept of emergence and its importance
by showing how a directed mutation in the regulatory network
results in a distinct tissue pattern. Although simpliﬁed, the synthetic
system retained features of more complex systems. In particular, it is
aligned with some experimental ﬁnding in the C. elegans germline
development. Finally, I discuss applications of this approach in
distinct systems from evolutionarily diverse organisms. I further
discuss future directions, extensions and possible applications of
the approach.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

2.1 Reactive model

Computational techniques (e.g. Petri Nets, Boolean networks and PI—
calculus) are widely used to simulate reactive aspects in biological systems
(Qian and Dougherty, 2009; Sackmann et al., 2006). These techniques often
simulate biochemical reactions, gene regulatory and signal transduction
(Durzinsky 61611., 2011; Grafahrend—Belau et al., 2008; Qian and Dougherty,
2009). However, the existing simulation platforms are yet to fully support
object—oriented programming of multiple autonomous agents (Shoham,
1998) over multiple scales.

The reactive model presented here utilizes the visual language
of Statecharts (Harel, 1987) as implemented in Rhapsody, IBM’s
object—oriented platform (www.ibm.com/software/awdtools/rhapsody/). In
Statecharts, objects are associated with ‘states’ that represent stages in the
object’s dynamics and ‘transitions’ that connect one state to another. A
collection of states and transitions forms a component. One state in each
component is labeled as the initial state, which deﬁnes the initial stage
of the lifespan of the component. The language allows components to be
nested within states and facilitates orthogonality (i.e. the representation of
simultaneous mechanisms) in an intuitive way.

Rhapsody compiles Statecharts speciﬁcations into executable machine
code. At any point in time during execution, each component is associated
with an ‘active state’. Initially, the active state is the one labeled as the
‘initial state’. As the execution progresses, ‘events’ are generated and trigger
the transitions between states. Consequently, the active state moves from one
state to another. Events can be sent within a component, across components
of the same agents and between agents.

Using Statecharts and Rhapsody, cells in the model are formalized as
reactive agents whose components reﬂect the activity of their molecular
mechanisms. For example, a gene whose expression is regulated by an
external signal would be deﬁned as a component with two states, active
and inactive, and two transitions that indicate the presence and absence of
a signal. When an agent senses signal below or above a certain threshold, it

generates events that trigger the relevant transition. The active state moves
between the active and inactive states accordingly.

All the agents in the simulation act based on the same speciﬁcation
to reﬂect the identical genetic material of cells. Each cell, however, acts
independently and decides on its next step based on its current stage and the
external factors it senses. The decision—making in the model is deterministic.
Stochastic behavior in the model emerges from subtle differences in the
order of events (e. g. the order by which cells proliferate). The model does
not contain an internal clock, thus agents update their state asynchronously.
Simulations are executed on an Intel Core2 Quad CPU Q9950 PC with 4 GB
RAM memory. A typical simulation run with a maximum of 500 agents
lasts ~20 s.

2.2 Animation

The activities in the model are represented in a 2D front—end that continuously
visualizes the changes in the model. The front—end was designed using the
ActionScript 2.0 scripting language of Flash MX2004 (http://www.adobe.
com/products/ﬂash/). The front—end is linked up with the reactive model
through the generic reactive animation platform of Harel and Setty (2008),
which enables bidirectional message passing between the two tools.

Each object in the model has a designated animated ﬁgure in the front—
end. The front—end visualizes key activities of the cell agents by changing
the color, position and size of the animated ﬁgures. Speciﬁcally, cells are
animated as circles; cell proliferation is represented by creating an additional
identical ﬁgure; cell differentiation is visualized by a change of color and/or
size of the ﬁgure and cell movement is represented by positioning the
animated ﬁgure into a neighboring position.

3 ALGORITHM
3.1 Modeling of a synthetic developmental system

The synthetic developmental system presented here retains two
key characteristics of real developmental systems in multicellular
organisms: (i) cell proliferation whereby cells divide to create
new cells and (ii) differentiation whereby precursor cells adopt a
specialized cell type. The cell population in the synthetic example
occupies a bounded tissue area open at one end and closed at the
other (Fig. 1A). A single cell, which secretes a cell—extrinsic ligand,
is positioned at the closed end of the bounded area (Fig. 1A, yellow
crescent). Cells that sense strong signal of the ligand proliferate
at a bounded area at the closed end of the structure (Fig. 1A,
yellow circles). As cells move toward the open end of the structure,
they enter three sequential differentiation stages before leaving the
system: (i) early differentiation stage (Fig. 1A, light orange circles),
(ii) fully differentiated stage in which proliferation is blocked and
the maturation process is initiated (Fig. 1A, orange circles) and
(iii) specialized stage in which the cells have adopted their mature
developmental stage (Fig. 1A, double size green circles).

The development of individual cells is maintained by a
regulatory network that generates reactions to extracellular cues
(Fig. 1B). Interaction with the cell—extrinsic factor is done
through Receptor—1 that regulates cell—intrinsic activity of three
intracellular effectors: a transcription factor (TF—l) and two
regulators (Regulator—1 and Regulator—2). To illustrate activity
over alternative signaling pathways, the regulatory network in
the synthetic system consists of two independent pathways for
triggering cellular differentiation. When Receptor—1 interacts with
the ligand, it enhances the expression of the transcription factor
TF—l, which in turn blocks the activity of the two regulators,
Regulator—1 and Regulator—2. Consequently, cellular proliferation is

Proliferative cells go through phases G1, S, G2 and divide in phase M. Cells
that cannot proliferate exit the proliferation cycle and enter stage G0

initiated and cellular differentiation is blocked. In contrast, when
Receptor—1 is not active (or absent), the genetic regulators are
not expressed, thus blocking cellular proliferation and permitting
cellular differentiation.

The proliferative cells (i.e. undifferentiated ones) continuously go
through the four cell cycle phases, G1, S, G2 and M, and divide to
give rise to an identical daughter cell. A differentiated cell exits the
cell cycle and remains in the resting G0 phase (Fig. 1C).

3.2 The intracellular activity at the molecular scale

To implement the regulatory network at the molecular scale, the
signaling pathways are decomposed into two distinct elements. The
ﬁrst speciﬁes the interactions of the receptors with the cell—extrinsic
factors and the second handles the regulation of the intracellular
molecules (Fig. 2A and B, respectively).

The activity of Receptor—1 is described by three states: unbound,
active or absent. Ligand interaction transition connects the unbound
state with the active state, and degradation transition connects the
active state to the absent one. The initial state of Receptor—1 is
the unbound state. The component triggers the ligand interaction
transition when the receptor detects ligand signal above 0.9
(indicating that the cell is positioned in an interaction distance with
the ligand source). When the signal amplitude drops below this
value, the Degradation transition is triggered and the component
moves the active state to absent.

connected with two transitions. (B) A binary representation of the three
cell intrinsic elements (TF—l, Regulator—1 and Regulator—2). Each element
consists of two states, active and inactive. The states are connected by
transitions that represent their regulator activity (TF—l activity is regulated
by the receptor activity; Re gulator—l and Re gulator—2 are regulated by TF— 1).
(C) Cellular decision—making—three orthogonal components: proliferation,
differentiation and motility

The cell—intrinsic regulation (Fig. 2B) speciﬁes the activity of
molecular elements in a binary fashion. Each of the three elements,
TF— 1, Regulator—1 and Regulator—2, can be either in active or inactive
state. The initial state of these elements is set to inactive. Receptor—
1 active transition connects the inactive state of TF—l to its active
state and receptor ab sent connects the opposite direction. TF—l active
transition connects the active state of Regulator—1 and Regulator—
2 with their inactive state. TF—l inactive transition connects their
inactive state with the active state.

3.3 The decision-making at the cellular scale

The cellular scale deﬁnes a set of rules to simulate the decisions each
individual cell agent makes in response to its current developmental
stage, its position and the signals it detects. The decision—making
consists of three orthogonal components, one for proliferation
(Fig. 2C, left), the second for differentiation (Fig. 2C, middle) and
the third for motility (Fig. 2C, right). An additional cellular decision,
apoptosis, is assigned to cells as a global action that instructs the
agent to exit all active processes.

The proliferation component speciﬁes the cell cycle division
phases. This component speciﬁes two proliferation states for the cell,
G0 whereby the cell rests and a replication stage that deﬁnes the four
phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2 and M). The transitions between
the states are connected by transitions that are triggered after a
ﬁxed time period (enterCycle 50 ms, GlTime 200 ms, STime 150 ms
and G2Time 100 ms; i.e. cells attempt to proliferate approximately
every 500 ms by evaluating their ability to divide). An exitCellecle
transition monitors the proliferation and is activated when the
cell agent blocks proliferation. A successful proliferation occurs
when (i) Receptor—1 is in its active state, (ii) the cell successfully
completed the cell cycle phases (i.e. entered the M phase) and (iii)

Multi-scale modeling of developmental biology

 

a free adjacent space is available for the new instance. Once a cell
satisﬁes the three conditions, an identical instance is created in the
neighboring position. In cases where any of the conditions cannot
be fulﬁlled, the mother cell blocks proliferation by triggering the
exitCellecle event.

In parallel, the differentiation component determines four
sequential differentiation states that designate the developmental
stage of the cell agent: precursor, early differentiation, differentiated
and specialized (Fig. 2C). The step from the precursor state to early
differentiation is guarded by the activity of genes in the molecular
network, namely, Regulator—1 and Regulator—2. Similarly, two
sequential transitions determination and maturation connect early
differentiation to differentiated and differentiated to specialized,
respectively. These transitions are triggered by the amplitude of
the ligand signal (signal <0.75 and signal <0.5, respectively). The
signal amplitude approximates the distance from the tip where cells
adopt a speciﬁc fate. Once a cell enters the specialized state, it
doubles its size. In rare cases where cells do not have available
space, they go through programmed cell death and are removed
from the simulation.

The third component, the motility, determines the movement
direction of the cell agent. This component abstracts the activity
of physical forces and possible adhesion molecules that control the
motility of a cell from one position to another. This component
continuously senses the environment, checking for a free space
to reposition the cell (Fig. 2C, bottom right). This component
repeatedly checks occupancy in the cell’s close vicinity. In each
iteration, it ﬁrst randomly decides on the direction and moves its
active state to the relevant X or Y state. In each direction, the cell
examines the availability of the neighboring grid entries (left, right,
for the X axis and up, down for the Y axis). If an available entry
is detected, the cell relocates itself to this position. Otherwise, the
active state returns to the initial sense state.

3.4 Cell-extrinsic cues and anatomy at the tissue scale

The highest scale the model tackles is the tissue scale that facilitates
a ‘playground’ for cells in the simulation. A 2D grid deﬁnes the
structure of the tissue by overlaying the U—shaped anatomy of
the synthetic example. Each entry in the grid contains a zero if
it is outside of the anatomical structure, a one if it is inside the
structure and is free and the cell ID if it is inside the structure and
is occupied. Cells cannot move (or proliferate) out of the structure
boundaries or into a position that is already occupied (i.e. each grid
box hosts at most one cell). The cell—ligand interaction is simulated
as a signal that gradually decreases as the distance from the ligand
source grows. The signal strength is calculated by a simple diffusion
equation as a function of two variables—time, t, and distance, x:

2
%=D:x—J; —)/f(X)+3(x—XLS)-

Parameter XLS determines the distance of the ligand source
from the open end and 6, D and y are the diffusion coefﬁcient,
the production rate and the degradation rate, respectively. XLS is
set to 10.

To make the equation easily solvable, the values of the equation
rates were normalized to 1. Solution of the equation on steady—state
conditions (i.e. d(x)/d(t)=0) approximates the signal amplitude
over the space as a function of the distance from the source (Fig. 3A).

strength at the closed end of the structure (black) gradually decreases as
the position moves toward the open end where the signal amplitude equals
zero (white). (C) Transitions: the value ranges that trigger them and the
developmental progression they represent

In order to ﬁt the 1D solution to the 2D anatomy, the ligand diffusion
is assumed to occur only over the proximal axis (i.e. the ligand is
constant on the perpendicular axis). To minimize the complexity
required for run—time calculations, the solution values are stored in
the grid as shown in Figure 3B. The various transitions, their cause
and the developmental progression are summarized in the table in
Figure 3C.

This implementation is a highly simpliﬁed version of the ligand—
cell interaction in reality. However, it could be easily extended
to cover anatomical spatial changes over time possibly extracted
from observations in live organisms. Similarly, a more realistic
implementation of the receptor—ligand interaction could account for
physical constraints that exist in reality.

4 IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING

4.1 Development over time from cross-scale activity

Executions of the model begin with four precursor cells that occupy
the area that is assumed to physically interact with the source ligand
(i.e. within distance zero from the closed end). As the simulation
progresses, these cells proliferate and move toward the open end,
ﬁlling the empty space of the structure (Fig. 4A and Supplementary
Movie S1). At the molecular scale, precursor cells (Fig. 4A, yellow)
interact with the ligand (i.e. the ligand interaction transition is
enabled). In turn, the active state of Receptor—1 moves from unbound
to active and TF—l is active and the two regulators are inactive.
Consequently, at the cellular scale, the proliferation component
moves through the four cell cycle states creating a new instance at the

Total number of cells in the simulation under baseline (blue) and mutated
network (green). (D) The simulation under the mutated network. Precursor
cells continuously proliferate and ﬁll the entire structure

M state. In parallel, cells move away from ligand source creating free
space into which neighboring cells divide. When a cell moves away
from the external ligand source, its receptor loses the interaction
with the ligand and degrades. Consequently, at the molecular scale,
the degradation transition is triggered and the receptor enters the
absent state. In turn, the Receptor—1 absent transition is triggered
in the TF—l component. Once TF—l enters the inactive state, the
TF—l active transition of Regulator—1 and Regulator—2 is triggered,
moving the regulators’ active state from inactive to active. As a
result, at the cellular scale, the differentiation component moves
from the precursor state to early differentiation (Fig. 4A, light
orange). As cells move toward the open end, intrinsic signals trigger
the determination transition, which causes the cells to enter the
differentiated state (Fig. 4A, orange). Cells that crossed the turn of
the structure trigger the maturation event and enter the specialized
state (Fig. 4A double size green circles).

The tissue—scale pattern that emerged from the simulation consists
of three distinct domains. Each domain is primarily occupied
by cells of a speciﬁc type. At the initial stages, the domain
closest to the closed tip is ﬁlled with precursor cells. As the
simulation progresses domains for the different cell types are
formed (Fig. 4A). Proliferative cells occupy the closest domain
to the closed end (Fig. 4A, yellow and light orange), followed
by a domain ﬁlled by differentiated cells (Fig. 4A, orange) and a
domain of specialized cells (Fig. 4A, double size green circle). The
emergent distribution of the different types over time is given in
Figure 4B. Initially, the precursor—cell population increases until

it reaches it full capacity (~30 cells; Fig. 4B, blue). The early
differentiation population grows in a delay and reaches a maximum
of ~40 cells (Fig. 4B, green). Since these cells go through a
specialization process, the early differentiated population gradually
decreases, while the differentiated population increases over time.
Equilibrium between the two populations is reached when the early
differentiation population size is ~30 cells and the differentiated
population size is ~70 cells (Fig. 4B, green and red respectively).
In parallel, the specialized cell population increases its size to
~50 cells (Fig. 4B, cyan). Overall, the population size achieves
a maximum size of ~200 cells (Fig. 4C, blue). Notably, neither the
population size nor the growth timing was explicitly programmed
or restricted in the model. Rather, they emerged from the molecular
interactions and the collective decision—making of the cells in
simulation.

4.2 In silica experimentation: a molecular modiﬁcation
leads to a distinct tissue pattern

An important aspect of the multi—scale modeling approach is the
ability to perform empirically grounded in silico experimentation.
This allows analyzing the effects of changes in the molecular
regulatory network on cellular and tissue development. These
experiments simulate possible in vivo experiments.

An example of in silico experimentation is simulating genetic
manipulations that enhance receptor activity by preventing its
degradation. This is a modiﬁcation at the molecular scale, that
is implemented in the model by removing the degradation
transition that connects the active state to the absent state in
the Receptor—1 component (Fig. 2A). When the simulation is
executed, Receptor—1 is continuously active and thus TF—l is
continuously active. Consequently, both Regulator—1 and Regulator—
2 remain inactive. In turn, at the differentiation component of the
decision—making, the transition between the precursor state and
the early differentiation state is never triggered (i.e. cells block
differentiation). Consequently, at the cellular scale, the decision—
making was restricted to proliferation and motility (i.e. mutated cells
can either proliferate or move).

This molecular—scale modiﬁcation leads to a distinct tissue—scale
emergent behavior. In contrast with the three domains observed
in the wild—type simulations, the simulation develops packed
precursor cell population that ﬁlls the structure entirely (Fig. 4D and
Supplementary Movie S2). As a result, the emergent distribution of
cells is considerably altered. The size of the precursor population
increases to ~500, ~2.5 times the total number of cells (Fig. 4C)
and 15 times more than this population (Fig. 4B) in simulations
under wild—type conditions.

4.3 Comparison with a real developmental system

The germline development in the C. elegans nematode particularly
illustrates the reality of the synthetic example (Hubbard, 2007). This
developmental system consists of a self—renewing cell population
that occupies the distal end of a blind—ended two U—shaped arms
tube (Fig. 5A). The population maintains interactions with a tip cell
that is positioned at the distal end of structure (Fig. 5A, yellow
crescent). Precursor germ cells (Fig. 5A, green circle) that interact
with the tip cell proliferate to create new instances. Cells are
‘pushed’ by the proliferating neighboring cells toward the uterus
(Fig. 5A, light green). When these cells initiate differentiation, they

et al. (2004)]. (A) Illustration of one arm of the adult germline in the gonad
that displays a distal—to—proximal axis of germline development. (B) The
genetic pathway mediating germ cell activity; cell—extrinsic cue (LAG—2)
interacts with the GLP—1 receptor that regulates the activity of the cell—
intrinsic transcription factor LAG—1. LAG—1 negatively regulates GLD—l
and GLD—2, two regulators (differentiation markers in this context) that
promote differentiation and inhibit proliferation. (C) Comparison between
the synthetic example and germline development. Left: three distinct areas in

go through three phases: early meiosis stage (Fig. 5A, red crescent),
from which they adopt a pachytene fate (Fig. 5A, red circle) and,
ﬁnally, mature gametes (Fig. 5A, orange for oocyte and blue for
sperm).

In vivo experimentations characterized the genetic network that
controls the cell—intrinsic regulation (Fig. 5B). The cell—extrinsic
ligand, LAG—2, i.e. expressed by the tip cells, regulates the signaling
pathway by binding to the receptor GLP—l. The active receptor
triggers the expression of the transcription factor LAG—1, which in
turn promotes the expression of two regulators GLD—l and GLD—2

that determine the cellular decisions. Cells that express either one
of these regulators initiate differentiation and block proliferation.

Although simpliﬁed, the simulations of the synthetic example
are comparable with experimental observations in the gonad of the
C. elegans nematode. The emergent patterns in the model share
similar characteristics with images from live wild—type and mutant
nematodes (Fig. 5C). The pattern of the three distinct domains in
the simulation is similar to patterns observed in the gonad of wild—
type nematodes: a proliferative zone positioned close to the distal
tip (orange) followed by a zone consists of differentiated cells zone
(green) and specialized cells (i.e. matured gamete) (blue).

Similarly, the emergent pattern in enhanced receptor activity
simulations is comparable with observations in mutations whose
GLP—1 receptor is engineered to gain function. In this mutant,
similar to the enhanced receptor activity design of the simulation, the
receptor remains active through the cell’s entire lifespan. Similar to
the pattern emerged in the altered simulations; this mutant develops
a tumorous tissue that consists only of precursor cells that are packed
in the structure (Fig. 5C, right).

5 DISCUSSION

5.1 Applications of the approach

The synthetic example presented here serves to highlight the
underlying principles of the approach. Nevertheless, the approach
supports complex real systems that consist of multiple signaling
pathways and multiple cell types. Indeed, this approach inspired
to date three models that simulate development of real organs and
stem—cell population in distinct, evolutionarily diverse, biological
systems: pancreatic organogenesis in mice (Setty et al., 2008),
germline development in C. elegans (Setty et al., 2012) and neuronal
migration in rodents (Setty et al., 2011). The models served to
analyze the biological systems through extensive analysis of in
silico genetic manipulations. Notably, these studies investigated
dynamic aspects that could not be drawn from the isolated elements
and, instead, had to be analyzed at the multicellular tissue level.
The models recapitulated key features of the development and
predicted altered formation under modiﬁed conditions. Several
of the predictions were validated in in vivo experiments, further
afﬁrming the potential of the approach.

The approach can be utilized to model a broad variety of
biological systems in various evolutionary diverse organisms. This
approach particularly suits modeling of systems where the pattern
and structure is dominantly regulated by an agent population that
responds to external cues. Among these are stem—cell systems
such as the Drosophila ovariole and testis (Fuller and Spradling,
2007). Similarly, this approach could serve in modeling the dynamic
emergence of uncontrolled malignant cancer cell population in
healthy tissues. A support for this direction can be obtained by
the tumorigenesis—like phenomenon that emerged in the synthetic
example (although only partially adheres to the ‘hallmark of cancer’
(Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000).

5.2 Future extensions

The approach as discussed here tackles three essential scales;
however, it can be extended in a modular fashion nonetheless
for creating models with additional scales. One possibility is to
extend the current discrete representation of the molecular activity

with a more realistic version, through a speciﬁcation of activity at
scales below the molecular one. The extended scales should cover
interactions between molecules incorporating parameters for protein
concentrations, binding rates, physical forces and so forth. This
could be undertaken using the more traditional reaction equations
(Edelstein—Keshet, 2005) or by computational techniques (Priami
and Quaglia, 2004; Regev et al., 2001).

A complementary extension could assemble models of different
tissues and the relevant interactions between them to yield a
comprehensive model at an organism scale. Such effort may serve
as a platform to study organism—level development and function as
well as detailed analyses of diseases and abnormalities.

Another possible direction is adding support for triggering
decision—making by a combination of stimuli, thus extending the
present implementation of a single stimulus (i.e. signal amplitude)
that triggers the multiple decision—making in the simulated agents.
A possible additional stimulus could be derived from the density of
entities in the agent’s vicinity. This property could be of particular
interest in applying the presented technique in modeling quorum
systems (e. g. bacteria population and ant colony) whose response is
correlated to population density (Goryachev et al., 2006).

The principles underlying this approach could serve in a tool
for in silico modeling and analysis, facilitating integration of
experimental knowledge in computational visual models for a wide
range of developmental systems.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Although small nucleolar RNAs form an important class of
non-coding RNAs, no comprehensive annotation efforts have been
undertaken, presumably because the task is complicated by both
the large number of distinct small nucleolar RNA families and their
relatively rapid pace of sequence evolution.

Results: With snoStrip we present an automatic annotation pipeline
developed specifically for comparative genomics of small nucleolar
RNAs. It makes use of sequence conservation, canonical box motifs
as well as secondary structure and predicts putative targets.
Availability and implementation: The sno Strip web service and the
download version is available at http://snostrip.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/

1 INTRODUCTION

Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are one of the most abundant
and evolutionarily ancient groups of functional non-coding RNAs
(ncRNA) dating back at least 2—3 billion years to the last common
ancestor of Archaea and Eukarya. They fulﬁll an impressive variety
of cellular functions ranging from specifying the locations of chem-
ical modiﬁcations in several ncRNA classes and nucleolytic pro-
cessing of rRNAs to the synthesis of telomeric DNA and an
involvement in genomic imprinting and alternative splicing, re-
viewed e.g. by Bachellerie et al. (2002) and Matera et al. (2007).
They broadly fall into two classes distinguished by secondary struc-
ture and characteristic sequence boxes, after which they are named
box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs. A variety of computational
tools has been devised to identify snoRNAs de novo in searches of
genomic DNA, see e. g. Hertel et al. (2008) and Yang et al. (2006).
Homologous snoRNAs are often hard to ﬁnd because of their
small size, poor sequence conservation and—in the case of box
C/D snoRNAs—lack of a conserved secondary structure. So far
no speciﬁc tool for homology-based snoRNA search has been
devised. At the same time, the Rf am database covers only a
subset of the known snoRNAs and many of the seed alignments
contain only few independent sequences (70% of the snoRNA
alignments contain <16 sequences). Available snoRNA databases,
on the other hand, mainly focus on single organisms, e.g. snoRNA—
LBME—db on human and the Umass-database on yeast. Lacking
overall sequence conservation and structural elements combined
with characteristic sequence motifs makes it hard to detect
snoRNAs by means of sequence homology, i.e. NCBI-blast, only.

2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The snoStrip-pipeline has been designed to ﬁll this gap. It em-
braces ﬁve parts: (i) a homology-based search procedure to accu-
mulate potential snoRNA candidates, (ii) a post-ﬁlter that uses
the conservation of box motifs and putative target sites to in-
crease speciﬁcity, (iii) a module for extracting additional features
including secondary structure and putative target predictions, (iV)
the computation of family-wide alignments and (V) an optional
validation check. Each novel snoRNA candidate and its corres-
ponding snoRNA-derived information are subsequently stored in
an internal database called snoBoard. The snoStrip-pipeline
can either be run with single or multiple query families, each of
which may contain one or more query sequences.

( i ) Homology search. The snoStrip-pipeline uses a set of
known snoRNA sequences {$1,52, ...,s,,} of a given family S
as queries to identify their homologs in a given target genome.
First blastn with relaxed parameters (word size W: 8, E-Value
10—3, mismatch, gap opening and gap extension parameters
q = —l, G=2 and E: l) is used. If no candidate is returned, a
covariance model (CM) is generated from S using infernal
1.0.2 (Nawrocki et al., 2009). To increase sensitivity, the model is
calibrated with ——exp—cmL—1oc set to 3.0 Mb. An infernal-
derived candidate for a genome of length N is accepted if its
bitscore exceeds log2(2N) and E < 0.01.

( ii ) Box ﬁltering and target site extraction. Short conserved box
motifs are characteristic for bonafide snoRNAs. However, several
speciﬁc nucleotides and structural components have to be present
to ensure their functionality. For detailed information and refer-
ences, please have a look at our manual on the web server.

Given a snoRNA family S and a snoRNA candidate snew,
snoStrip uses MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) to obtain a temporary
alignment of $1, . . . ,5” with snew. If the location of a box motif in
the alignment agrees for all sequences 5,- and the box of snew ﬁts
certain restrictions (see manual), this position is selected as box
location in the candidate. Otherwise, a gap-free search window
roughly delimited by the minimal and maximal start positions of
the boxes in the known sequences is used to determine the loca-
tion that best ﬁts a position weight matrix (PWM) created from
the corresponding box motifs of $1, . . . ,sn.

Candidate antisense elements (ASE, 9—20 nt in length) are
located immediately upstream of box D and/or D’. We extracted
corresponding PWMs of these lengths to score snoRNA candi-
dates. Testing on randomized and true data returned 13 nt as the
most sensible window size and 0.7 as score threshold for accept-
ance [in accordance with Chen et al. (2007), see our web site].

( iii ) Property extraction. An important feature of snoRNAs is
their type-speciﬁc secondary structure. We use RNAsubopt
Wuchty et al., 1999) with type-speciﬁc folding constraints: box
C/D snoRNAs are required to contain an internal loop delimited
by the boxes C and D, whereas box H/ACA snoRNAs are pro-
hibited from forming base pairs in their hinge and tail regions,

Fig. 1. A san example of the web server output, the conservation of the
target interaction between the 18S rRNA (left) and the ASE of box C/D
snoRNA family snR52 (right) is shown

respectively. Correctly folded box C/D sequences are pruned at
the base of the closing stem (or after at most 10bp), other can-
didates are truncated 8 nt upstream of box C and downstream of
box D. Box H/ACA snoRNAs are assumed to terminate 3nt
after the ACA box.

Target predictions for putative snoRNA sequences are either
performed by RNAsnoop (H/ACA) (Tafer et al., 2010) or by
PLEXY (C/D) (Kehr et al., 2011). For box H/ACA snoRNAs,
we use target RNA accessibility proﬁles precomputed by RNAup
(Muckstein et al., 2006). We omit this step for box C/D
snoRNAs, as the accessibility around methylation sites does
not signiﬁcantly differ from the overall accessibility (data not
shown). Finally, all single sequence predictions are mapped to
the positions in target RNA alignments to facilitate the analysis
of the conservation of the predicted modiﬁcation sites.

( iv ) Family-wide alignments. All potential snoRNA sequences
assigned to a speciﬁc family are aligned with MUSCLE.

(v) Validation check. In an optional post-processing validation
check, we analyze all detected candidates with respect to their
alignment score and target binding afﬁnity (details in the manual).

For fungi, the snoStrip web server provides easy access to
this snoRNA annotation pipeline. This service can be deployed
in two operating modes: (a) genome-wide snoRNA annotation
and (b) single sequence conservation. Owing to resource con-
straints, the web version accepts moderate size genomes
(60 MB) as input. Although in (a) the taxonomic range that is
to be used as query can be speciﬁed, for mode (b) it is necessary
to provide sequence-speciﬁc box motifs. The service returns a
variety of results that can be downloaded, e.g. mfasta- and
gff-ﬁles, family-wide alignments and alignments displaying con-
served snoRNA—targetRNA interactions, see Figure 1.

For (large) genomes of multicellular plants and animals the
snoStrip pipeline is easily applicable in a locally installed version.
We have, for instance, conducted an extensive survey of metazoan
snoRNAs that will be reported elsewhere. In the following, we
brieﬂy outline snoStrip results on fungi and Giardia lamblia.

The initial query set consisted of 231 experimentally veriﬁed
snoRNAs from ﬁve fungal species (see detailed manual on our
web server). Running the snoStrip-pipeline resulted in >3500
putative snoRNAs in 63 fungal genomes. A more detailed overview
is given in the table below. This provides by far the most compre-
hensive collection of fungal snoRNAs today and sets the

stage for a detailed investigation into their evolution. Overall, we
compared our candidates against several snoRNA prediction
tools, and the results can be found on the snoStrip Web site.
A whole genome snoRNA annotation in Fusarium oxysporum
took ~5h and resulted in a total of 51 box C/D and 20 box
H/ACA candidates.

To test whether snoStrip can accomodate divergent
sequence patterns, we analyzed 30 validated snoRNAs from
G.lamblia Isolate A (Hudson et al., 2012). By sequence, 29
families were recovered in both isolates B and E. With default
settings, the pipeline rejected three of these families because of
their aberrant box C sequences, which harbor two 2 substitutions.

In summary, with our snoStrip pipeline we provide a conveni-
ent and efﬁcient way to annotate homologous snoRNAs in newly
sequenced genomes. Complementarily, single snoRNA genes can be
evolutionary traced across a widespread of species. Our
snoStrip— generated collections of snoRNA data constitute a
valuable resource for large-scale studies, e. g. on snoRNA evolution
and target interaction. It further enables a more generalized charac-
terization of snoRNA species, e.g. for improving the accuracy of
machine learning approaches for de novo snoRNA prediction.

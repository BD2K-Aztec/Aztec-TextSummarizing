ABSTRACT

Motivation: Functional enrichment testing facilitates the interpretation
of Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput
sequencing (ChlP-seq) data in terms of pathways and other biological
contexts. Previous methods developed and used to test for key gene
sets affected in ChIP-seq experiments treat peaks as points, and are
based on the number of peaks associated with a gene or a binary
score for each gene. These approaches work well for transcription
factors, but histone modifications often occur over broad domains,
and across multiple genes.

Results: To incorporate the unique properties of broad domains into
functional enrichment testing, we developed Broad-Enrich, a method
that uses the proportion of each gene’s locus covered by a peak. We
show that our method has a well-calibrated false-positive rate, per-
forming well with ChlP-seq data having broad domains compared with
alternative approaches. We illustrate Broad-Enrich with 55 ENCODE
ChlP-seq datasets using different methods to define gene loci. Broad-
Enrich can also be applied to other datasets consisting of broad gen-
omic domains such as copy number variations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput
sequencing (ChIP-seq) identiﬁes transcription factor (TF) bind-
ing sites and the locations of histone modifications (HMs) across
the genome (Barski et al., 2007), and is a step toward better
understanding the gene regulatory programs of living organisms.
Numerous algorithms, termed peak callers, have been developed
to detect the genomic regions of significant signal (peaks) within
the millions of aligned reads resulting from ChIP-seq experi-
ments (Bailey et al., 2013; Valouev et al., 2008; Zhang et al.,
2008). Some of these peak callers are geared specifically to
HMs, which are known to exhibit broader enriched domains
on average compared with TFs (Zang et al., 2009). HMs are
numerous and varied, and like TFs, often drive the regulation
of a specific biological program, such as cellular differentiation
(Sen et al., 2008) or growth (Bernstein et al., 2006). Speciﬁc sig-
natures often occur at HM intersections, such as the bivalent
domains observed for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, which mark
genes expected to be activated on cellular differentiation

(Bernstein et al., 2006; Pan et al., 2007). Other histone changes
occur in disease progression (Chi et al., 2010) or in response to
environmental signals (Kaelin and McKnight, 2013). Such sig-
natures are likely often cell-type and context speciﬁc, and there-
fore, assessing the biological commonalities among the targeted
genes is a question of intense interest.

Gene set enrichment (GSE) is a common approach to infer
biological function given a set of experimentally derived genes
(Draghici et al., 2003). GSE was originally developed to biologic-
ally interpret lists of differentially expressed genes derived from
microarray studies (Curtis et al., 2005) in terms of particular bio-
logical functions, processes or pathways [e.g. Gene Ontology
(GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000) or KEGG Pathways (Kanehisa
and Goto, 2000)]. An early enrichment tool is DAVID (Huang
et al., 2008), which uses a slightly modified Fisher’s exact test
(FET) to determine whether experimentally derived genes signifi-
cantly overlap a gene set representing a biological concept, relative
to the remaining genes. Under the null hypothesis of no more
overlap than expected by chance, FET assumes that each gene
has the same probability of being detected as signiﬁcant. In the
context of GSE with ChIP—seq data, FET assumes that each gene
has an equal probability of being associated with a peak.
Although FET has been used with ChIP—seq data (Blow et al.,
2010; Han et al., 2013), it is typically used only with peaks within
or near gene promoters. When all peaks are used, the presence of a
peak in a gene locus is often correlated with the length of the locus
(Ovcharenko et al., 2005), thereby violating the FET assumption.
We refer to this correlation as the locus length bias. Given that
some gene sets contain genes that have, overall, significantly
longer (e.g. nervous system, development and transcription
related) or shorter locus length (e.g. metabolic processes and
stimulus responses) than the average locus length, the possibility
of confounding exists when no correction is made for locus length
(Taher and Ovcharenko, 2009). Using FET with only peaks near
gene promoters removes nearly all of the length bias, but also
ignores a large portion of the data.

Recent GSE tools for ChIP—seq experiments have attempted to
correct for this length bias. One such tool, Genomic Regions
Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT), uses a binomial-
based test to test whether the total number of peaks within the
loci in a gene set is greater than expected relative to the total
number of peaks, the total locus length of the gene set and the
non-gapped length of the genome (McLean et al., 2010). In con-
trast to FET, the binomial test of GREAT assumes that the
number of peaks in a locus and the locus length are proportional.
Thus, FET and the binomial test have opposing assumptions
regarding the relationship between the presence of a peak in a

genomic region and the length of that region. Although FET is
typically used after classifying each gene as either (i) having at
least one associated peak or (ii) having no peak, the binomial test
uses the total number of peaks. Both methods typically use a
single nucleotide point, the midpoint or mode of the peak, to
represent the entire peak region.

We examined 100 TE and 55 HM ChIP-seq experiments from
ENCODE (ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2012a) for dif-
ferences between peak sets from transcription factor- and histone-
based ChIP-seq experiments. HM peak sets have been observed to
have broader peak regions than TFs, with individual peaks often
spanning multiple genes (Zang et al., 2009). We hypothesized that
an enrichment method using such relevant regulatory information
rather than simply the midpoint of each peak, as both FET and
the binomial test do, would improve performance for HMs and
other experiments resulting in broad domains.

To incorporate the properties of broad-domain peak sets into
functional enrichment testing, we developed Broad-Enrich to
functionally interpret large sets of broad genomic regions. A
unique feature of our method is that we score gene loci according
to the proportion of the locus covered by all peaks overlapping the
locus, which we will refer to as the coverage proportion. Broad-
Enrich then uses a logistic regression model that empirically ad-
justs for any bias in gene locus coverage relative to locus length,
avoiding the pitfalls of either FET or binomial-based tests. We
show that Broad-Enrich exhibits the correct type I error rate
across 55 permuted ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets. We then illus-
trate the beneﬁts of Broad-Enrich across the same set of 55 data-
sets, concentrating on H3K4mel,-2 and -3, H3K9me3,
H3K27me3 and H3K79me2 in the GM12878 cell line.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Gene locus deﬁnitions

We deﬁne a gene as the region between the furthest upstream transcrip-
tion start site (TSS) and furthest downstream transcription end site (TES)
for that gene. The UCSC knownGene table (human genome build hg19)
was used to deﬁne TSS and TES sites. We removed small nuclear RNAs,
as they are likely to have different regulatory mechanisms than other
genes and often reside within the boundaries of other genes. For func-
tional enrichment testing, we use three primary deﬁnitions of a gene locus
(Fig. 1.1). (i) Nearest T SS: the region between the upstream and down-
stream midpoints of a gene’s TSS and the adjacent gene’s TSS, equivalent
to assigning each peak to the gene with the nearest TSS. (ii) 551d): the
region within 5 kb of all TSSs in a gene. If TSSs from the adjacent gene(s)
are <10 kb away, we use the midpoint between the two TSSs as the
boundary of the locus for each gene. (iii) Exons: the exons of each
gene. When exons from multiple transcripts of the same gene overlap,
the exons are consolidated into one continuous region. In the R package
and on the Web site, we include two additional deﬁnitions. (i) Nearest
gene: the region from the midpoint between the TSS and the adjacent
gene’s TSS or TES (whichever is closest) to the midpoint between the TES
and the adjacent gene’s TSS or TES (whichever is closest). This is equiva-
lent to assigning peaks to the nearest gene; (ii) 51 kb: same as 55 kb, but
within lkb of all TSSs in a gene.

2.2 Proportional assignment of peaks to genes

A unique feature of Broad-Enrich is how peaks are assigned to gene loci.
For a particular gene locus deﬁnition, each locus is scored according to
the proportion covered by the union of all peaks overlapping the locus
(Fig. 1.1). Our approach accounts for the extent to which a locus is
covered by a peak and allows coverage by multiple peaks.

2.3 Annotation databases

Functional enrichment results presented here are performed on gene sets
constructed from the GO database and the KEGG Pathways database.
We construct GO terms from GO biological processes, GO cellular com-
ponents and GO molecular functions using the 0rg.Hs.eg.db and G0.db R
packages. All analyses in the article were performed using R version 3.0.1.
KEGG pathways are inherited from LRpath (Kim et al., 2012). Eleven
additional annotation databases are offered in the R package, including
cytoband regions, Biocarta (Nishimura, 2001) and Panther pathways (Mi
et al., 2012), pFAM (Punta et al., 2011) and gene sets derived from lit-
erature-based Medical Subject Heading terms (Kim et al., 2012; Sartor
et al., 2010). Before enrichment testing, all gene sets are ﬁltered through
the user-selected gene locus deﬁnition so that only genes with a locus
deﬁnition are included in the tests. By default, only gene sets containing
between 10 and 2000 genes are tested. A minimum of 10 genes allows
better convergence of the logistic regression model used for enrichment
(Peduzzi et al., 1996) and the maximum of 2000 genes avoids general, less-
informative gene sets. Annotation databases were built for human (hgl9),
mouse (m9 and mm10) and rat (rn4).

2.4 Broad-Enrich method for functional
enrichment testing

We use a logistic regression framework to test for functional enrichment,
similar to LRpath (Sartor et al., 2009), an enrichment testing method
developed for microarray data. The independent variable r for Broad-
Enrich is the vector of proportions of each gene’s locus that is covered by
the union of all peaks (Fig. 1 visually represents these proportions). The
dependent variable is a binary vector indicating gene set membership (1 if
the gene belongs to the gene set and 0 otherwise). Let It be the proportion
of genes in the gene set at a speciﬁed r value and locus length L. Then, the
ratio 71/(1— TI) is the odds that a gene with peak coverage proportion r and
locus length L is a member of a given gene set. If the log odds increase as r
increases, then we conclude the gene set is positively associated with the
coverage proportion, and thus enriched with the experimental set of
broad genomic regions. We use the model:

If

 

log =b0 +b1r+ SS(log10L)

1 — 7T
where 170 is the intercept, b; is the coefﬁcient of interest for the coverage
proportion, the function SS is a binomial cubic smoothing spline that
adjusts for the potentially confounding effect of locus length and the logo
transformation is used to improve the model ﬁt (data not shown).

The smoothing spline function is ﬁtted using generalized cross-
validation to estimate the smoothing penalty, A, and 10 knots with the
cubic spline basis as an approximation to a true cubic smoothing spline
(Wood, 2006; 2010). The overall model is ﬁtted using a penalized likeli-
hood maximization approach with the gam function in the mgcv R pack-
age (Wood, 2010). A Wald test is used to test the null hypothesis H0:
171 = 0 versus the alternative H1: 171 75 0 and to calculate the P-value for
the signiﬁcance of the coverage proportion coefﬁcient, b; (Fig. 1.3). Gene
sets with b1>0 are enriched, whereas those with b1<0 are depleted. P-
values are corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini—Hochberg
false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).
For presented analyses, gene sets with FDR<0.05 are considered to be
signiﬁcant.

2.5 Experimental ChIP-seq peak datasets

We used 155 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from 31 DNA binding pro-
teins: 11 HMs and 20 TFs across ﬁve cell lines (GM12878, H1-hESC,
HeLa-S3, HepG2 and K562), representing the largest complete matrix of
experiments of HMs and TFs among tier 1 and tier 2 cell lines. Peaks for
the 55 HM datasets were called by the ENCODE Consortium using
Scripture (ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2012b), and used as is.

The 100 TE datasets were originally called using a variety of peak callers
according to the lab of origin. We implemented a standard peak-calling
pipeline for the TF datasets (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary
Table S1).

2.6 Permutations to test type I error rate

Two permutation scenarios were performed to assess the type I error rate
of the enrichment tests under the null hypothesis of no true biological
enrichment with gene sets from GO. In both scenarios, gene labels are
permuted so that each gene is given the GO term assignments of a ran-
domly chosen gene. Preserved in both scenarios is the number of genes in
a gene set and the correlations among the gene sets inherited from their
parent/child relationships.

In the ﬁrst scenario (referred to as Perrnuted), we randomly perrnute
gene labels relative to locus length and peak coverage proportion. The
resulting permutations remove true biological association and the locus
length bias inherent in the GO terms. In the second scenario (referred to
as Perrnuted in Bins), gene labels are randomly permuted within bins of
100 genes sorted by locus length. This has the effect of preserving the
relationship between locus length and peak coverage proportion in the
dataset. The resulting permutations remove true biological association in
the gene sets while maintaining any locus length bias. Tests exhibiting
inﬂated type I error under this scenario in excess of the ﬁrst scenario can
be considered as not appropriately accounting for locus length. Each type
I error estimate was based on 5404 tests.

2.7 Alternative functional enrichment testing methods

We compared the functional enrichments for the 55 HM experiments (11
HMs across 5 cell lines) found with Broad-Enrich with those found by
FET and our implementation of the binomial test of GREAT (McLean
et al., 2010). Additionally, we determined the type I error rate for a
simpliﬁed version of the Broad-Enrich model excluding the smoothing
spline [simple logistic regression (LR) model] to assess its necessity. Genes
that were annotated in GO or KEGG and had a deﬁned locus were
included in the analyses. We used a two-sided FET to test for association
of peak presence (21 peak midpoint within a gene locus) and gene set
membership. We used a binomial test similar to the one described in
GREAT; we calculate the probability of seeing greater than or equal to
the number of peaks we observe for a gene set, 71, with the formula:

20103.0 — pa“

i=k,,
where n is the total number of peaks within gene loci in any gene set, and
k,r is the number of peaks annotated to gene set It. The term p,r is deﬁned
as the expected proportion of peaks in gene set It. In other words, p,r is the
total non-gapped gene loci length in the gene set, divided by the total non-
gapped length of loci with at least one gene set annotation. P—values are
calculated as the probability of observing k,r or more peaks in the gene
set.

We also used GREAT (http://bejerano.stanford.edu/great/) with hg19,
the non-gapped genome as the background region, and the single nearest
gene within 9999 kb association rule excluding curated regulatory
domains.

Fig. 2. HM- and TF-based peak sets exhibit several different properties,
observed with 100 TE and 55 HM ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets. (A)
There tends to be more peaks in HM experiments (median = 42330)
compared with TF experiments (median = 14040). (B) The peak width
distributions are signiﬁcantly different. HM peaks (black) tend to be
broad and highly variable (median = 1255 bp, SD = 483 279 bp), whereas
TF peaks (gray) tend to be narrow and less variable (median = 330 bp,
SD = 560 bp). (C) HM peaks consistently cover a greater percentage of
hg19 (median = 11.25%) than TF peaks (median = 0.16%). (D) The
percentage of peaks covering two or more gene loci also tends to be
higher for HMs (median = 5.78%) than for TFs (median = 2.64%).
(E) The same is true of peaks covering three or more gene loci (me-
dian = 0.6 and 0%, respectively). Both (D) and (E) use the nearest
T SS deﬁnition

detecting HMs tend to have more peaks (Fig. 2A), broader peaks
(Fig. 2B) and more variable peaks widths (Fig. 2B). We also ﬁnd
histone—based peaks tend to cover a much larger percentage of
the th9 genome (Fig. 2C).

In addition to more and broader peaks in the HM datasets, we
observed that the HM datasets also tend to have a higher pro-
portion of peaks intersecting two or more gene loci compared
with TF datasets. With the nearest T SS locus deﬁnition, we ﬁnd
the percentage of peaks covering two or more gene loci tends to
be higher for HMs (median = 5.78%, range = 1.71—24.66%)
than for TFs (median = 2.64%, range = 0.17—8.82%)
(Fig. 2D). Similarly, the percentage of peaks covering three or

more loci is higher for HMs (median = 0.60%, range = 0.17—
7.64%) than for TFs (median = 0%, range = 0.00—0.14%)
(Fig. 2E). The properties observed in HM peak sets indicate
current methods may be ill-suited for detecting functional enrich-
ment in HM ChIP-seq data.

3.2 Broad-Enrich method

Based on the differences observed between TFs and HMs in
ChIP-seq data, we aimed to develop an enrichment testing
method that accounts for the extent to which each HM is asso-
ciated with each gene. Using the number of peaks associated with
a gene, as GREAT does, would yield stronger association to a
gene with two narrow peaks than to a gene with one broad
region covering the entire gene. Using a binary indicator of
whether a gene has at least one peak associated with it, as is
done with FET, would not account for any differences in the
proportion of the gene locus covered. Both approaches ignore
instances where a peak covers a signiﬁcant portion of the loci of
two or more genes.

We ﬁrst deﬁne the gene locus deﬁnitions, which capture the
main trends of where HMs tend to occur relative to exons and
TSSs. In this article, we use (i) the region(s) within 5 kb of every
TSS of a gene (35 kb), (ii) the combined exon regions for a given
gene (exons) and (iii) the region between the upstream and down-
stream midpoints between a gene’s TSS and the adjacent gene’s
TSS (nearest T SS) (Fig. 1). These locus deﬁnitions represent
binding in the greater promoter regions, throughout gene bodies
and anywhere in the surrounding genomic region including en-
hancers (assigned to the gene with the nearest TSS), respectively.

Given a locus deﬁnition, the proportion of each gene locus
covered by all peaks overlapping the locus is determined. To
test for signiﬁcant enrichment, we use a logistic regression ap-
proach with gene set membership as the outcome and the pro-
portion of a locus covered as the predictor. Because of the known
confounding effect of locus length relative to the presence of :1
peak (Taher and Ovcharenko, 2009), we examined and observed
a similar relationship between locus length and peak coverage
proportion (Supplementary Fig. S1). We correct for loglo locus
length empirically using a binomial cubic smoothing spline (see
Section 2 for more details). P—values are then calculated for en-
richment and adjusted for multiple testing.

Broad-Enrich outputs three tab-delimited text ﬁles: (i) peak-
to-gene locus assignments from the input peak set with lengths of
peaks, loci and overlap; (ii) the gene locus coverage information
after aggregating over all peaks overlapping a locus; (iii) the en-
richment results, with signiﬁcance values and summary informa-
tion for tested gene sets. QC plots showing the relationship
between loglo locus length and the proportion of the locus cov-
ered by a peak are also output (Supplementary Fig. S1).

3.3 Investigation of type I error

Under the null hypothesis of no true GSE, the type I error rate,
or proportion of false-positive results, for a dataset at a given
threshold or is the proportion of gene sets with P—value less than
a. A method with type I error rate higher than the expected a
level will result in an overabundance of false-positive results. We
investigated the type I error rates for Broad-Enrich, the simple
LR model, the binomial-based test and FET, for 55 HM datasets

Fig. 3. Type I error rates of the binomial-based test, Broad-Enrich, the
simple LR model and FET under the two permutation scenarios with the
nearest T SS locus deﬁnition. Each point represents 1 of the 55 HM
datasets (Supplementary Table S2). (A) At or = 0.05 (red line), we ﬁnd
inﬂated type I error for the binomial test under both permutation scen-
arios, the correct error rate for Broad-Enrich and the correct error rate
for permutations eliminating length bias but often inﬂated error for per-
mutations preserving length bias for both the simple LR model and FET.
(B) At or = 0.001 (red line), we observe results similar to or = 0.05. Mean
error rates are given inset

under two permutation scenarios using the nearest T SS locus
deﬁnition. Both permutations remove any true biological associ-
ation between gene sets and the genes they contain. The ﬁrst
scenario (Permuted) assesses type I error of the enrichment test
under no locus length bias. The second scenario (Permuted in
Bins) has the effect of preserving the locus length properties of
the gene sets and illustrates the extent to which the type I error
rate is affected by locus length.

We ﬁnd that Broad-Enrich exhibits the correct type I error
rates in both permutation scenarios and at different or levels. The
binomial test exhibits severely inﬂated type I error in both scen-
arios, and both the simple LR model and FET exhibit the correct
type I error rate in the ‘Permuted’ scenario, but have inﬂated
error for the ‘Permuted in Bins’ scenario [Fig. 3A (a = 0.05),
Fig. 3B (or = 0.001) and Supplementary Table S2]. Comparing
Broad-Enrich with the simple LR model, we conclude that the
smoothing spline is essential for Broad-Enrich’s well-calibrated
type I error. None of the 55 datasets tested exhibited correct type

I error for the binomial-based test. Welch et al. identiﬁed signiﬁ-
cant extra variability (beyond that expected by the binomial test)
in the number of peaks assigned to genes in ENCODE ChIP-seq
data; they show this, together with the incorrect assumption of
the binomial test with respect to locus length, accounts for the
inﬂated type I error (\Nelch et al., 2014). In contrast, FET re-
sulted in correct type I error for 16 of 55 datasets under both
permutation scenarios (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S2).
The inﬂated type I error of the remaining 39 datasets results from
FET being unable to account for the locus length bias present in
these datasets (W elch et al., 2014; Taher and Ovcharenko, 2009).
We compare the enrichment results for these 16 datasets with
those of Broad-Enrich in Section 3.5.

3.4 Summary of ENCODE HM enrichment results

We tested for GSE using Broad-Enrich in the same 55 HM
ChIP-seq datasets from the ENCODE Consortium. We ﬁnd
that signiﬁcantly enriched gene sets outnumber signiﬁcantly
depleted gene sets by ~3:l over all the datasets
(Supplementary Table S3). The number of enriched gene sets
varies greatly among experiments, with as few as 8 for
H3K9me3 in K562 and as many as 1058 for H3K4me2 in H1-
hESC (median number of enriched gene sets = 664) of 5591 total
gene sets tested from GO and KEGG, and using the nearest T SS
locus deﬁnition. For a ﬁxed histone, the number of enriched gene
sets can vary greatly across the ﬁve cell lines (e.g. H2az
range = 74—767 and H3K9me3 range = 8—253), suggesting dif-
ferent biological activity for such HMs across GM12878, H1-
hESC, HeLa—S3, HepG2 and K562.

For each HM, we determined the extent of overlap among
signiﬁcantly enriched gene sets across the ﬁve cell lines with
the nearest T SS locus deﬁnition (Supplementary Table S4).
GM12878 and Hl-hESC tend to have the highest percentage
of unique enrichments across all HMs. This could be an indica-
tion of more speciﬁc regulation via HMs in these cell lines com-
pared with the others. H3K36me3 and H3K79me2 exhibit the
highest percentage of enriched gene sets common to all cell lines
(39% each). Both modiﬁcations tend to occur within the gene
body, and the observation of many mutually enriched gene sets
could be a result of their necessary functions in constitutively
expressed gene groups required by cells, such as transcription
and RNA processing (ENCODE Project Consortium et al.,
2012a). H2az had the smallest percent (0.1%) of mutually en-
riched gene sets among all ﬁve cell lines, with the most uniquely
occurring in the embryonic stem cell line.

3.5 Comparison of Broad-Enrich to FET and GREAT

FET has an acceptable type I error rate (30.05 at a = 0.05 level)
in only 16 of 55 datasets (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S2).
These datasets tend to have fewer peaks overall, and more peaks
located within 5 kb of the TSS compared with the 39 HM data-
sets with type I error rate > 0.05. For each of these 16 datasets,
we compared the average peak coverage proportion of gene loci
in the gene sets uniquely enriched by Broad-Enrich with those
uniquely enriched by FET. The gene sets uniquely enriched by
Broad-Enrich have a consistently higher proportion of the gene
locus covered (Supplementary Table S5). We also examined the
percentage of signiﬁcant enrichments that were stronger in one

method versus the other by comparing the FDR values of gene
sets enriched in either method. Broad-Enrich resulted in stronger
enrichment signal in 12 of 16 datasets (Supplementary Table S5).
Finally, we compared the power of Broad-Enrich with FET in
the 16 datasets by varying the proportion of genes with a peak,
and the proportion of each gene locus covered by a peak
(Supplementary Methods). We ﬁnd that Broad-Enrich has
higher power than FET in nearly all cases (Supplementary
Table S6).

For comparison with GREAT (v1.8.2), we selected six histone
datasets (H3K4mel,-2,-3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and
H3K79me2 in the cell line GM12878) representing a mixture
of activators/repressors and binding close/distal to TSSs. We
tested all GO terms using the ‘single nearest gene’ within
9999 kb gene regulatory domain deﬁnition provided in
GREAT because it is most similar to the nearest T SS deﬁnition
in Broad-Enrich. We compared relative ranks of enrichments, as
the binomial-based test implemented in GREAT has overly sig-
niﬁcant P—values (inﬂated type I error rate). Comparing the top
20 ranked GO terms for each enrichment test, we ﬁnd that com-
pared with GREAT, Broad-Enrich consistently ﬁnds gene sets
with higher coverage in terms of the proportion of each gene
locus having the HM (Supplementary Table S7).

The GM12878 cell line is a lymphoblastoid cell line.
Lymphoblasts are naive lymphocytes, which is the term used
for any of the three types of white blood cell (leukocytes) in
the vertebrate immune system. H3K4mel is a known general
transcriptional activator. The top 20 ranked GO terms for
H3K4me1 in Broad-Enrich include leukocyte activation,
lymphocyte activation, regulation of lymphocyte activity, posi-
tive regulation of immune response and regulation of leukocyte
activation (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S8). None of the
above (and only one immune-related term) is in the top 20
ranked GO terms according to GREAT. In contrast, the top
terms ranked by GREAT included mitochondrion— and ribonu-
cleotide binding-related gene sets, which are not as strongly
related to the known properties of GM12878 (Table 2 and
Supplementary Table S8).

H3K27me3 is a known repressor of differentiation and devel-
opmental genes. Within the top 20 ranked GO terms from
Broad-Enrich, we ﬁnd tissue development, organ morphogenesis,
epithelium cell differentiation and regionalization. According to
GREAT, none of the above or related GO terms is ranked in the
top 20, and only one is in the top 100 (Supplementary Table S9).
Moreover, the top terms ranked by GREAT included metabolic
processes and energy/transport-related gene sets, which are not
commonly associated with the regulatory targets of H3K27me3.

In both instances, we ﬁnd that the binomial test not only ﬁnds
an overabundance of signiﬁcant (FDR<0.05) terms, as indi-
cated by its inﬂated type I error rate, but also that Broad-
Enrich ranks biologically relevant terms better than GREAT.

3.6 Effect of locus definition on enrichment

It is known that some histone marks preferentially occur in par-
ticular locations relative to gene features. To investigate the effect
of locus deﬁnition on enrichment signal, we ran Broad-Enrich
for each of the 55 HM ChIP-seq datasets with the nearest T SS,
exons and 35 kb locus deﬁnitions. We hypothesized that using a

locus deﬁnition better conforming to the known genomic loca-
tion of the histone mark would result in stronger enrichment
signal.

H3K4me2, known to occur in promoters (Pekowska et al,.
2010), tends to have strongest enrichment signal with the 35 kb
locus deﬁnition across the ﬁve cell lines (Supplementary Fig.
S2). H3K4me3, also known to occur in promoters (Bernstein
et al., 2006), shows results similar to H3K4me2 (not shown).
H3K79me2 binds near the 5’ end of gene bodies, and overall we
see the strongest enrichment signal when using the 35 kb deﬁn-
ition (Supplementary Fig. S3). In contrast, H3K36me3 binds
near the 3’ end of the gene body, and we see a somewhat
stronger enrichment when using the exons deﬁnition compared
with the 35 kb deﬁnition (Supplementary Fig. S4) (Barth and
Imhof, 2010; ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2012a).
Histone acetylation, such as H3K9ac, tends to occur near
TSSs (Barth and Imhof, 2010), and we observe stronger enrich-
ment signal for the §5kb locus deﬁnition across the ﬁve cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S5). H3K27me3 gives stronger enrich-
ment signal with the exons deﬁnition for all cell lines except H1-
hESC, which performs best with the §5kb locus deﬁnition
(Supplementary Fig. S6). This may be indicative of a different
regulatory regime for H3K27me3 in embryonic stem cells versus
the other cell lines, consistent with current literature (Xie et al.,
2013). H3K4mel is considered a distal activating mark (Dong
et al., 2012), and exhibits stronger enrichment signal with the
nearest T SS locus deﬁnition in GM12878 and HepG2 but stron-
ger signal with 35 kb in Hl-hESC, HeLa—S3 and K562 (Supple-
mentary Fig. S7). Broad-Enrich results from the additional tier
2 ENCODE cell lines A549, Huvec and Monocytes-CD14+,
and using the same three locus deﬁnitions resulted in the
same overall conclusions for the 11 HMs above (not shown).
Overall, we observed that the locus deﬁnition closest to the
known locations of an HM provided the strongest enrichment
results. These results should be interpreted in light of the fact
that nearest T SS is the only locus deﬁnition to include all peak
regions; thus, important information about individual genes
within enriched gene sets may be lost for the 35 kb or exons
deﬁnitions.

4 DISCUSSION

Functional enrichment testing leverages our collective biolo-
gical knowledge together with high-throughput genomic technol-
ogies in a statistical framework to functionally interpret new
biological data. Unique properties observed in ChIP-seq data
for HMs have led to the use of specialized peak-calling algo-
rithms. These properties, combined with the bias observed in
gene loci coverage relative to locus length, present challenges
to existing functional enrichment methods. We have developed
Broad-Enrich to address these issues in functionally interpret-
ing large sets of broad genomic regions. Our approach uses
the proportion of a gene locus covered by all peaks overlapping
the locus, and a correction accounting for the locus length in a
logistic regression model with gene set membership as the
outcome.

Inﬂated type I error rates result in an overabundance of false-
positive results, while well-calibrated type I error rates result in
accurately reported FDRs. We demonstrate that Broad-Enrich

has a well-calibrated type I error rate across 55 HM ChIP-seq
datasets representing a wide variety of technical and biological
characteristics. In contrast, the binomial-based test consistently
exhibits inﬂated type I error, while FET has the correct type I
error for only 16 of the 55 datasets. These 16 HMs represent
transcriptional activators, or HMs occurring in actively tran-
scribed genes. Even for these 16 HMs, Broad-Enrich tends to
provide stronger enrichment signal than FET. Compared with
GREAT, Broad-Enrich ﬁnds more biologically relevant terms in
the top ranked gene sets, as illustrated with immune function-
related terms for H3K4mel and H3K27me3 in the context of
lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878. While rank comparisons are
not ideal, in the absence of a gold standard, we rely on known
biological roles for the HMs combined with known characteris-
tics in cellular context.

Finally, we examined the effect of locus deﬁnition on the en-
richment signal from Broad-Enrich. We see the strongest enrich-
ment signal by using the locus deﬁnition closest to the known
locations of the HM. For two HMs, we observe differences in the
optimal locus deﬁnition. For H3K27me3, the exons locus deﬁn-
ition performs best in all cell lines except for Hl-hESC, where
35 kb performs best. This difference could be explained by the
role H3K27me3 plays in embryonic stem cells, where it is known
to often occur in promoters of genes having CpG islands to
regulate differentiation of ES cells (Deaton and Bird, 2011; Xie
et al., 2013). For H3K4mel, we observe that nearest T SS per-
forms best for GM12878 and HepG2, whereas 35 kb performs
best for the remaining cell lines. This might indicate that
GM12878 and HepG2 cells rely more heavily on long-range en-
hancer activity for gene activation than the other three cell lines.
These results emphasize that the deﬁnition with strongest enrich-
ment signal tends to mirror the currently understood location of
HM binding. Our implementation of Broad-Enrich allows users
to deﬁne their own custom locus deﬁnition to ﬁt their own ex-
perimental contexts.

In addition to functionally interpreting single HM experi-
ments, it is also possible to examine bivalent or trivalent HM
signatures together (e.g. H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) with Broad-
Enrich and compare the results with the HMs individually to
determine if bivalency leads to unique biological function.
Broad-Enrich is also applicable to other types of broad
domain experiments, such as copy number variations.

As the regulatory programs of living organisms are better
understood, Broad-Enrich may be improved with distal regula-
tory information from Hi-C experiments, allowing for more ac-
curate locus deﬁnitions. The signiﬁcance or strength of each peak
region reported by peak callers may also be incorporated in the
enrichment model. Such future changes may bring functional
interpretation of broad genomic regions closer to making opti-
mal use of peak information.

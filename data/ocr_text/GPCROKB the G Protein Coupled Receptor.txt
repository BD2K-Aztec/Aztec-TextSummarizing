ABSTRACT

Summary: Rapid expansion of available data about G Protein
Coupled Receptor (GPCR) dimers/oligomers over the past few
years requires an effective system to organize this information
electronically. Based on an ontology derived from a community
dialog involving colleagues using experimental and computational
methodologies, we developed the GPCR-Oligomerization
Knowledge Base (GPCR-OKB). GPCR-OKB is a system that
supports browsing and searching for GPCR oligomer data. Such
data were manually derived from the literature. While focused on
GPCR oligomers, GPCR-OKB is seamlessly connected to GPCRDB,
facilitating the correlation of information about GPCR protomers and
oligomers.

Availability and Implementation: The GPCR-OKB web application
is freely available at http://www.gpcr—okb.org

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane (TM)
helical proteins that are implicated in many biological responses,
and thus serve as targets for a variety of therapeutic compounds
(Hopkins and Groom, 2002). Although still a matter of controversy
for some GPCR subtypes, the very close proximity of two or more
receptors has been demonstrated unambiguously in heterologous
cell systems for several GPCRs using biochemical and biophysical
techniques (Milligan and Bouvier, 2005). The challenge now is to
determine whether all GPCR complexes have functional signiﬁcance
in native tissues, as already demonstrated for a few pairs (Panetta
and Greenwood, 2008).

Information supporting the existence of functionally relevant
GPCR dimers/oligomers is described in multiple articles published
in the literature. This creates a challenge to researchers trying
to gather experimental evidence and/0r computational predictions
about any given oligomer. Our previous work focused on the design
of an ontology (Skrabanek et al., 2007) to organize information
about GPCR oligomerization, and its functional consequences
in vitro and in vivo. The ontology was well received (Simpson et al.,
2010), demonstrating signiﬁcant interest in an electronic system to
access GPCR oligomer information. In this article, we describe the
GPCR-OKB system, which implements the GPCR-OKB ontology
and an electronic front-end to organize information about GPCR

oligomerization obtained from 167 published articles (as of January
2010).

2 METHODS

Data acquisition: the content provided in GPCR-OKB was extracted from
articles published primarily during the past decade, and was recorded in
the system in a format as close to the raw experimental data as possible to
preserve objectivity. In cases where published evidence varied, the option
‘EVidence Varies’ highlighted the controversy. Thus, only original research
papers were annotated; review articles were excluded. The latter, however,
were checked to ensure that data from referenced original research articles
were included in the GPCR-OKB.
System design: the GPCR-OKB web application was developed with
the Grails web application framework, and supports both browsing and
structured searches. Information is stored in XML ﬁles that follow the GPCR-
OKB XML schema designed in agreement with the GPCR-OKB ontology
(Skrabanek et al., 2007; see http://www.gpcr-okb.org, The Ontology and
Figure 1 in Supplementary Data for a summary of the types of information
captured, and the relationships between them). XML ﬁles are versioned with
the Subversion version-control system, and can be downloaded directly (see
FAQ for download instructions). The GPCR-OKB web application loads
these XML ﬁles at startup, indexes text ﬁelds, and starts serving web pages.
The system has been tested with a variety of modern web browsers and has
no speciﬁc requirements (see FAQ for a list of recommended browsers).
For easy access to detailed information about individual subunits forming
a GPCR oligomer, GPCR-OKB is linked to the latest release of the GPCRDB
(Horn et al., 2003). Data are exchanged between GPCRDB and GPCR-OKB
in XML format with an agreed-upon XML schema.
Browsing: information contained in GPCR-OKB can be browsed starting
from any of the following titles: ‘Oligomers’, ‘Protomers’, ‘Methods’,
‘Phenotypic Changes’, ‘In Vivo Evidence’, ‘EVidence for Physiological
Relevance’ and/or ‘All Publications’. For simplicity, the GPCR-OKB only
refers to GPCR oligomers, although the majority of published experimental
studies cannot discriminate between dimers, tetramers or higher order
oligomers. Oligomer names are derived from the names of their constituent
protomers, separated by a hyphen, in alphabetic and numerical order,
following the recommendations of Ferre et al. (2009), and with the organism
in which they were characterized and the GPCR family name speciﬁed. When
the same combination of protomers has been studied in different species, the
GPCR-OKB lists these combinations as different entries. Tables of data offer
an option to download information in a tab delimited format (see ‘Export to
TSV’ button at the bottom of each table).
Structured searches: the ‘Search’ tool at the top right side of each page
(see Supplementary Figure 2) provides keyword searches across different
types of information. To search for a certain oligomer, the user speciﬁes
the name of the oligomer constituent protomers in the input box. Initially
conﬁgured to search only ‘Oligomers’, the search tool also allows to
search for protomers (only those that are part of stored oligomers),
methods, or to restrict oligomer searches to speciﬁc types of oligomers.
The latter are oligomers (i) with demonstrated phenotypic changes with
respect to the constituent protomers (e.g. speciﬁc signaling or ligand
binding cooperativity events), (ii) with published information about predicted
interfaces of dimerization/oligomerization and (iii) with at least one or two
of the following conditions satisﬁed: (a) evidence for physical association
in native tissue or primary cells; (b) knowledge of speciﬁc functional
properties in native tissue; and/or (0) information from knockout animals
or RNAi technology. These conditions are NC-IUPHAR recommendations
for recognition of a bona ﬁde functional GPCR oligomer, according to a
recent report (Pin et al., 2007).
Related systems: we are aware of at least two databases under development
that provide information about GPCR oligomerization, i.e. the GRIP-DB

system (Nemoto et al., 2009) and the ngB relationship database
(Theodoropoulou et al., 2008). These systems, however, are primarily
focused on predicting or storing knowledge pertaining to protein—protein
interactions between GPCR subtypes, GPCRs with partner G-proteins and/or
GPCRs with effector molecules.

3 CONCLUSIONS

In addition to information about protein—protein interfaces,
the GPCR-OKB stores detailed biochemical, pharmacological
and functional information about GPCR oligomers, including
phenotypic changes, evidence for physiological/clinical relevance,
effects of oligomer-speciﬁc ligands and proposed mechanisms of
activation. The system was designed to integrate seamlessly with
the widely used GPCRDB for receptor protomers. The information
included in GPCR-OKB was collected and presented in an objective
manner to encourage productive and substantiated communication
among the domain experts. The GPCR-OKB is expected to be very
useful to the GPCR scientiﬁc community.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Prognostic and diagnostic biomarker discovery is
one of the key issues for a successful stratification of patients
according to clinical risk factors. For this purpose, statistical
classification methods, such as support vector machines (SVM), are
frequently used tools. Different groups have recently shown that
the usage of prior biological knowledge significantly improves the
classification results in terms of accuracy as well as reproducibility
and interpretability of gene lists. Here, we introduce pathClass,
a collection of different SVM-based classification methods for
improved gene selection and classfication performance. The
methods contained in pathClass do not merely rely on gene
expression data but also exploit the information that is carried in
gene network data.

Availability: pathClass is open source and freely available as an
R-Package on the CRAN repository at http://cran.r-project.org

1 INTRODUCTION

Microarray studies are commonly used in clinical cancer research
to investigate molecular proﬁles associated with tumor development
and progression. Several thousand genes are measured to identify
predictive or prognostic gene signatures comprising only a couple
of genes. The goal is to use these gene signatures for stratiﬁcation
of patients according to clinical relevant endpoints.

Classiﬁcation algorithms are frequently used to identify gene
signatures. The support vector machine (SVM, Boser et al. 1992)
is a well-known example of such a classiﬁcation algorithm. Several
groups have proposed the so-called feature / gene selection methods
for the SVM since the algorithm does not offer an embedded feature
selection mechanism. Despite the identiﬁcation of biomarkers,
the aim of feature selection is to reduce the dimensionality of the
feature space in order to avoid the so-called curse of dimensionalty
(Bellman, 1961), that is overﬁtting. Overﬁtting occurs when the
number of features (genes) is large and the amount of samples
(i.e. patients) is comparatively small, which is often the case when
performing microarray studies. Thus, the algorithm can easily ﬁnd
a hyperplane that separates the training examples. However, the

generalization performance of such a classiﬁer will be poor and the
stability of identiﬁed gene signatures will be low (Ein-Dor et al.,
2005).

In order to overcome these problems, several groups have recently
proposed to adapt classiﬁcation methods in such a way that the
algorithms can beneﬁt from using prior biological knowledge
(Chuang et al., 2007; Johannes et al., 2010; Rapaport et al., 2007).
Common sources of such knowledge are databases that contain
pathway information or protein—protein interactions for a review
see Porzelius et al. (2011).

pathClass aims at providing the user with comprehensive
implementations of these methods in a uniﬁed framework in order
to allow easy and transparent benchmarking. To our knowledge, it
is the ﬁrst package implementing several SVM-based algorithms
that are capable of incorporating network knowledge into the
classiﬁcation process. It is, however, worth mentioning that all
methods available in pathClass have previously been published
and shown their predominance over standard algorithms. For
benchmarking of the more ’classical’ methods not using prior
knowledge, the user is referred to the packages CMA (Slawski et al.,
2008) and MCRestimate (Ruschhaupt et al., 2004). A boosting
approach that is capable of using prior knowledge (Binder and
Schumacher, 2009) can be found in the package GAMBoos t, which
is also available on CRAN.

2 PACKAGE FEATURES

To this end, the prior knowledge used by the algorithms
implemented in pathClass is represented as a network structure
or graph, i.e. it carries information on the connectivity of features.
In the following sections, the different algorithms and the way they
use the network data are brieﬂy explained.

For illustration purposes, we show a benchmark of all three
algorithms in Figure 1. However, it is important to note, that these
results are speciﬁc for this particular dataset. All steps needed to
reproduce the result of Figure 1 are given in the package Vignette.

2.1 Reweighted Recursive Feature Elimination

We recently proposed an extension of SVM-RFE (Guyon et al.,
2002), called Reweighted Recursive Feature Elimination (RRFE),
which exploits both gene expression data as well as pathway
knowledge (Johannes et al., 2010). The assumption of RRFE is
that a gene which is not differentially expressed but connected to
other genes that show a differential expression should have a higher

impact on the classiﬁer compared to those genes that do not have
any connections to other deregulated genes.

We used a modiﬁed version of Google’s PageRank algorithm,
called GeneRank (Morrison et al. , 2005), to calculate a ranking of the
features based on fold change and network centrality. In a next step,
this ranking is combined with the RFE ranking criterion. Based on
this combination, features are ordered and 90% of the most important
genes are kept for the next iteration. This procedure is then repeated
until only one feature is left. Afterwards, the model with the best
performance is chosen.

2.2 Network-based SVM

The approach introduced by Zhu et al. (2009) treat neighboring
genes is called network-based SVM and uses a network-based
penalty which leads to a grouped variable selection. This variable
selection is archieved by penalizing the SVM objective function with
an F 00 -n0rm, instead of the commonly used L1 or L2 penalization.
This norm forces the simultaneous selection or elimination of a
group of features from the same pathway. Zhu et al. (2009) treat
neighboring genes in a graph as a group and construct their network-
based penalty as the sum of F 00 -norms of groups of neighboring
genes pairs.

2.3 Incorporating network knowledge by spectral
decomposition

The method by Rapaport et al. (2007) deﬁnes a new metric for
gene expression measurements by using diffusion kernel maps. Their
assumption is that most biologically relevant information is captured
in the low-frequency component of expression proﬁles. Hence, the
projection of the low-frequency component of an expression vector
on the gene metabolic network should reveal areas of positive and
negative expression on the graph that are likely to correspond to the
activation or inhibition of speciﬁc branches of the graph.

In pathClass, we combined this method with a recursive
feature elimination, hence we allow to perform a feature selection
when using this algorithm. However, the user also has the possibility
to use the original version.

3 SUMMARY

We introduced pa thClass a comprehensive package for
classiﬁcation with prior knowledge of feature connectivity. Up to
now, it contains three SVM-based classiﬁcation methods capable of
using prior knowledge in the form of network data represented as
a graph. The methods can be used directly or in a repeated cross-
Validation setting, which helps to estimate the average classiﬁcation
accuracy. The package is able to run the cross-validation in parallel
and thus exploit the architecture of modern multicore computers
or computing clusters. A detailed step-by-step tutorial as well as a
comparison of the different methods on a cancer dataset is given in
the package Vignette, which is also available on CRAN.

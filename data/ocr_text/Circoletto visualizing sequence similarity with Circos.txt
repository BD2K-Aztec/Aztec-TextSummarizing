1 INTRODUCTION

The calculation of sequence similarity between two biological
sequences is as old a procedure as the ﬁeld of bioinformatics. The
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, or BLAST (Altschul et al.,
1990), is a celebrated and highly popular method for the task.
However, and partly because the heritage of such tools goes back to
very basic visualization technologies and monochromatic terminals,
partly because speed and efﬁciency are still paramount, these tools
do not come with visualization capabilities. Yet, there is great need
for intuitive ways to quickly understand their output, and interactive
solutions have so far included linearly stacked pairs of ideograms
(Gollapudi et al., 2008), and highly efﬁcient graph layouts of large
numbers of nodes representing sequences and edges representing
similarity (Frickey and Lupas, 2004). In this context, Circoletto has
been developed to complement such methods in a novel way.

2 METHODS

Circoletto is innovative in bringing together BLAST and Circos (Krzywinski
et 01., 2009), a rich, ﬂexible and aesthetically pleasing visualization suite
written in Perl, which, as the name suggests, is based on a circular
organization of information, resembling the way bacterial genomes have
been depicted for many years. Circular representations have desirable
traits for data visualization, discussed in (Krzywinski et 01., 2009) and
the Circos site (http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos/intro/circular_approach/), and
which include circumventing link crossover in stacked or linearly placed
ideograms, avoiding potentially very dense and complex graphs (the so—
called ‘hairball’ effect), and better use of more available space.

Circoletto has been developed to be user—friendly and efﬁcient, making the
procedure as straightforward as possible—to that effect, it is also served by a
small—scale BLAST server. It accepts either two FASTA—formatted sequence
ﬁles for the BLAST run, one containing the query sequences and the other
the database sequences, or a pre—computed BLAST output in the default
pairwise format. It allows the user to choose between preset E —values (from
relaxed to strict, and only applicable if the user has provided sequence ﬁles),
the Circos output format (between the fast, lightweight, lower quality PNG

Circoletto. Queries [Envelope (ENV) genes from Sirevirus (SV)
retrotransposons] are protruding short grey ideo grams, while database entries
(full—length Sireviruses) have been divided into two groups (yellow and
purple) and their long terminal repeats (LTRs) marked black with the optional
annotation ﬁle. Note the twist of the two ribbons reaching the Medicago

and its contrary, the SVG) and size. Additionally, the user can decide whether
only the best local alignment per query will be shown, and whether Circos
should attempt to untangle the ribbons by potentially re—ordering queries and
database sequences. Importantly, for the better understanding of the sequence
relations to be shown, the user can optionally load a custom annotation ﬁle
which can contain information to colour the entries (e.g. into functional
groups), and mark coordinate—based domains on the ideograms.

Upon submission, the provided data are processed, all the necessary ﬁles
for Circos are produced, and Circos is ran, while the user is being kept
informed. Finally, links to the visualization and either to two versions of the
Circoletto—calculated BLAST results, in tabulated and in HTML formats, or
to the user—provided BLAST output, are produced.

Several checks and thresholds are in place to control the complexity of
the output, since too much information can render the process too slow and
uninformative. These include limits to the number and size of sequences, and
the number of local alignments produced—the latter produces an alternative
path, with Circoletto attempting to reduce the number of links (ribbons in this
case) it will be asked to visualize by keeping top—scoring local alignments
only.

Visualizing sequence similarity with Circos

 

3 RESULTS

Figure 1 contains a sample Circoletto output (more can be found
here: http://tools.bat.ina.certh.gr/circoletto/examplesl). Sequences
are placed around a circle, read clockwise, starting at 12 o’clock.
Circos has the ability to place the ideograms in such an order so
that the ribbons are maximally untangled, which is why queries and
database entries can be intertwined (Fig. 1). The ribbons represent
the local alignments produced by BLAST, their width the alignment
length, and the colours the alignment bitscore in four quartiles: blue
for the ﬁrst (i.e. worst) 25% of the maximum bitscore, green for the
next 25 %, orange for the third, and ﬁnally red for the top (i.e. best)
bitscores of between 75% and 100% of the maximum bitscore. Black
outlined ribbons, preferentially placed on top of others, indicate the
best scoring local alignment for the corresponding query against the
database, while a twisted ribbon means that the local alignment is
inverted (one sequence is reverse complementary of the other). Since
the output can be rather complex, we provide stacked histograms
on top of the ideograms, representing the frequency (simple count)
and score (by aforementioned colour) of the ribbons at each point.
Finally, an optional annotation ﬁle can divide the sequences into
groups by user—deﬁned colours, and guide the marking of domains

(Fig. 1).

4 CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

To the best of our knowledge, Circoletto ﬁlls a gap in the
visualization of sequence similarity results, and has been warmly

received by laboratory scientists in our Institute. It by no means
cancels the need for a careful look at the raw data, but we believe it
provides an essential ﬁrst glimpse at sequence relationships. We will
be expanding its capabilities as its usage provides more feedback,
ensuring it continues to support research.

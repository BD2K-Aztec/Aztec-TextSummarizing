ABSTRACT

Motivation: Animal development depends on localized patterns
of gene expression. Whole-genome methods permit the global
identification of differential expression patterns. However, most
gene-expression-clustering methods focus on the analysis of entire
expression profiles, rather than temporal segments or time windows.
Results: In the current study, local clustering of temporal
time windows was applied to developing embryos of the
fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster. Large-scale developmental events,
involving temporal activation of hundreds of genes, were identified
as discrete gene clusters. The time-duration analysis revealed six
temporal waves of coherent gene expression during Drosophila
embryogenesis. The most powerful expression waves preceded
major morphogenetic movements, such as germ band elongation
and dorsal closure. These waves of gene expression coincide with
the inhibition of maternal transcripts during early development, the
specification of ectoderm, differentiation of the nervous system,
differentiation of the digestive tract, deposition of the larval
cuticle and the reorganization of the cytoskeleton during global
morphogenetic events. We discuss the implications of these findings
with respect to the gene regulatory networks governing Drosophila
development.

1 INTRODUCTION

Drosophila embryogenesis has been divided into 17 separate stages,
each stage marked by global changes of embryo morphology, such
as cellularization, gastrulation, germ band elongation (GBE), germ
band retraction (GBR) or dorsal closure (DC). Different parts of
an embryo might undergo simultaneous morphological changes.
Parallel developmental events, such as DC and head involution,
might begin at the same time (stages 14—15), but terminate at
different stages. Based on the time and the duration parameters,

the parallel events can be mapped to a 2D parameter space and
separated. Thus, parallel and temporally overlapping events can
be separated and analyzed (locally) with respect to distinct time
and duration parameters. These parameters are convenient for the
classiﬁcation of peaks of gene expression observed in the global time
series data. Presence of temporal peaks of expression with similar
time/duration properties might indicate a functional link between
genes, even if the genes’ expression proﬁles are not similar.

Complete expression data have been obtained for the entire
developmental time course of Drosophila melanogaster using both
expression (Arbeitman et al., 2002; Hooper et al., 2007; Stolc et al.,
2004; White et al., 1999) and tiling microarrays (Biemar et al.,
2005). Previous analyses of these datasets have shown that the vast
majority of genes exhibit at least 4—fold expression changes during
embryogenesis (Arbeitman et al., 2002; White et al., 1999) and
most genes have two or more major temporal peaks of expression
during the life cycle. Such reengagement of genes and gene networks
has recently been demonstrated during the development of the
mosquito embryo, Anopheles gambiae (D.Papatsenko, M.Levine
and U.Goltsev, personal communication). These studies suggest that
morphologically distinct and temporally separated developmental
events, such as formation of the serosa and cuticle, depend on the
deployment of coherent gene batteries. A recent study by Hooper
and co—workers (2007) identiﬁed a number of time points during
ﬂy development when clusters of genes coherently change their
expression levels. Using an approach initially introduced for the
analysis of development in Dictyostelium (Sasik et al., 2002),
Hooper and co—workers have identiﬁed several coherently switching
classes of genes in Drosophila, including maternal (off switch),
activated (on switch) and transient (peak) expression types. This
clustering strategy (Hooper et al., 2007; Sasik et al., 2002) relies on
local similarities (coherent on/off switches) in the global expression
data.

The time—duration analysis of ﬂy development described in this
study represents an unsupervised learning algorithm [a supervised
method was introduced earlier (Samsonova et al., 2007)], similar
to the temporal—clustering method implemented by Hooper and
co—workers (2007). Technically, the method can be classiﬁed as
a query—driven, local clustering of time series expression data
(Balasubramaniyan et al., 2005; Dhollander et al., 2007). In
this study, the search patterns (queries) were temporal sequences
corresponding to two major types of gene activity: ‘peak’ (transient
type) and ‘switch’ (activated type). The search patterns were
matched to the expression proﬁles locally (time windows), in order

to retrieve genes with locally coherent patterns of expression.
The duration parameter was incorporated by scaling each search
pattern to a range of time windows. This method identiﬁed nearly a
dozen distinct, large—scale developmental events during Drosophila
embryogenesis, each involving coherent expression of hundreds of
genes. Based on gene annotation enrichment, many of the identiﬁed
events were attributed to known morphological changes, such as
formation of the nervous system, digestive tract, deposition of
cuticle or reorganization of the cytoskeleton during morphogenetic
movements.

This method successfully identiﬁed discrete temporal events from
global time—series expression data. The approach can be applied to
the analysis of a variety of dynamic biological processes.

2 METHODS

2.1 Microarray data and data treatment

Time—series data for the Drosophila developmental course was taken from the
Hooper et al.’s (2007) study. Low—level microarray data treatment involved
standard quintile normalization of microarrays (Bolstad et al., 2003) and
Z—score normalization of time points (Eisen et al., 1998). Microarray data
were ﬁltered based on variation between biological triplicate’s points using
standard ANOVA analysis with very mild thresholds (P < 0.05). These
procedures produced 7052 gene expression proﬁles. Finally, the data has been
upsampled to 100 points and smoothed using Gaussian ﬁlter with standard
deviation equal to 5 points (after upsampling).

2.2 Local clustering algorithm

The algorithm inputs included a query pattern (sequence of values) and a
time—series data. The query patterns were rescaled (resampled and smoothed)
to a range 5—50% with respect to the number of time points in the input time
series data (duration parameter j) and then matched to every time window
of the microarray data set A. Pearson correlation r and standard deviation 0
were calculated for every window position in every gene expression proﬁle.
In the next step, for each expression proﬁle and each combination of time i
and duration j parameters, a matching score S was calculated as:

—10g (19 (my IA )+oz), p (0le )<h

1
0,p(0le)Zh U

50315::

In this formula, the parameter It captures relative amplitude of the signals
(i.e. peaks). For h=0.5 (selected in the case of peak matching), only the
highest 50% of all peaks were considered for a given window size j. The
h=0.9 (highest 10%) has been selected for the ‘switch’ query pattern.
Correlation values (r) were translated to conditional P—values in order to
obtain scores, which were comparable for different values of the duration j
(window sizes). Parameter or is a pseudocount limiting maximal value of the
score S (05200001 in this study).Clusters were identiﬁed as local peaks on
the time/duration parameter space, in other words—parameter combinations
that produced a large number of genes with scores S above an arbitrarily
chosen score cutoff (S: 1). Genes, producing S >1 were extracted from
each cluster and annotated. Notice that this procedure returns overlapping
clusters as any part of a given temporal expression proﬁle can be associated
with different clusters.

2.3 Annotation term enrichment analysis

GO slim version of gene annotations (Adams et al., 2000), containing
terms related to protein function and biochemistry and so—called ‘controlled
vocabulary (CV)’ annotations describing morphological parts of ﬂy embryo
were used in this study (Tomancak et al., 2002). The enrichment analysis
was performed using custom software ‘GO—piper’ (available upon request),

based on using binomial statistics to calculate term enrichment. The P—values
were adjusted using multiple test correction (correction Bonferroni).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Biological assumptions and selection of input
search patterns

Previous analyses of ﬂy and mosquito embryogenesis pointed to
the presence of temporally local characteristic patterns of gene
activity, such as on/off switches (activation/repression type) (Hooper
et al., 2007) and peaks of expression (transient type) (Goltsev et al.,
2009). These features are shared by many genes that are coherently
expressed at certain time intervals. It is reasonable to assume that
such coherent expression proﬁles might precede or coincide with
major morphogenetic events. Perhaps, such a straightforward 1D
interpretation of the time—series data is too simplistic as there
are unrelated, parallel developmental events that overlap in time
(e.g. DC and head involution). The application of both time and
duration parameters should help resolve such developmental events
(including parallel events) and provide a clear foundation for
functional analysis.

In theory, any type of temporal expression pattern can be of
interest; in this study, however, the search patterns for the time—
duration analysis were limited by the two previously described
types: local on/off switches and transient peaks of gene expression.
The peaks and the switches also represent one of the simplest
possible and biologically reasonable temporal expression patterns.
The particular shapes of the search patterns were adapted to the
format of the time series data. In this study, the original data have
been upsampled and smoothed using a Gaussian ﬁlter, in order
to minimize measurement errors for the neighboring time points
(see Section 2). Therefore, Gaussian shapes were accepted for the
selected input search patterns (peaks and switches) and all their
scaling variants (Supplementary Fig. S1). The upsampling step
(linear interpolation) changed the number of time points in the
dataset by inserting additional time points between the original ones
(201100), thus preventing information loss during the consequent
data treatment.

3.2 Resolution limits and selection of input time-series
data

Developmental gene networks can include hundreds of genes,
comprising 1% or more of the entire Drosophila genome. These
considerations dictate sensitivity limits for the time—duration
analysis. To test whether these limits are met, an artiﬁcial temporal
data set was generated, containing 10 000 random temporal proﬁles.
Coherent signals (peak type) with deﬁned start time and duration
time were introduced in some of the proﬁles from the simulated
dataset. In this benchmarking test, the method demonstrated reliable
detection of signals, introduced into 100 proﬁles (1% of total, see
Supplementary Fig. S2). It was possible to achieve even better
sensitivity when the introduced signals were highly coherent.
Sensitivity of the time—duration analysis also depends on the
type of input data. There are several global time—series expression
datasets currently available for Drosophila embryogenesis. One such
dataset was generated using expression arrays (Hooper et al., 2007).
It has rather high levels of noise (higher ANOVA P—values, see
Section 2), but contained more time points (30 time points for 24h

of embryogenesis) than other similar datasets (Biemar et al., 2005).
Whole—genome tiling array datasets have much lower noise levels,
but include fewer time points (12 time points for 24 h) (J .R.Manak,
time—series tiling array expression data, personal communication,
2005). Comparison of the datasets shows that time resolution is
critical for time—duration analyses (Supplementary Fig. S3). The
unreliable proﬁles can be removed based on their ANOVA P—values,
while the information in the missing time points could not be
recovered even by the use of data interpolation methods. Side by
side comparisons of gene expression proﬁles from the expression
and tiling array data indicate that the tiling arrays capture no more
than 1 data point per event (peak) lasting 2—4 h, while the expression
array data captures up to 3—4 points for the same event.

Alternative methods of handling the input data were also
investigated. Performance of the time—duration analysis has been
tested on both normalized data and smoothed data. Upsampling
(linear interpolation, see Section 2) and Gaussian smoothing
parameters were selected in order to remove noise, corresponding to
point—by—point variation. This noise ﬁltering increased the resolution
and revealed more events (clusters) in the expression array data
(Supplementary Fig. S3).

3.3 Identiﬁed clusters reﬂect temporal sequence of
known developmental events

Figure 1 shows the results of the time—duration analysis applied to the
normalized and upsampled/smoothed Drosophila expression array
data (Hooper et al., 2007). Altogether, the four search patterns (peak,
switch and their reversed variants) identiﬁed 45 distinctive temporal
clusters of genes, with the largest clusters containing up to 1300
genes and the smallest clusters containing ~100 genes; the majority
of clusters contain 400—500 genes. Certain clusters exhibit extensive
overlaps (Supplementary Table S3), and are presumably engaged
in the same developmental processes (Supplementary Fig. S5D
and E). For this reason, the actual number of the identiﬁed events
was estimated to be lower (15—20 events) than the total number
of distinctive clusters. Out of 7052 proﬁles in the input dataset,
3128 (44%) were shared by three or more clusters, 1295 (18%)
were shared by two clusters, 1239 (17.5%) proﬁles were not
shared (unique) and 1390 (20%) proﬁles were not present in any
cluster.

As expected, the time—duration analysis allowed clear
discrimination of slow and fast events (compare clusters #6
and #7 in Fig. 1B). Annotation term enrichment analysis was used
to determine the biological function shared by genes in each cluster
(van den Berg et al., 2009). Two types of annotations were used:
Gene Ontology (GO—slim) (Ashburner et al., 2000) and Drosophila
CV for morphological parts of the embryo (Tomancak et al., 2007).
GO—slim terms associated with genes indicate their biochemical
functions, while CV terms identify embryonic tissues in which the
genes are expressed (expression patterns).

Most of the gene clusters contain speciﬁc classes of enrichment
in the GO and CV terms (Supplementary Table S1). A strong
agreement has been found between the temporal sequence of known
developmental events and the timing of events associated with the
identiﬁed clusters. For instance, the CV term ‘maternal’ has been
enriched in cluster #1 (Fig. 1B), containing genes expressed at the
beginning of embryogenesis. CV terms ‘Dorsal ectoderm’ and ‘Pair—
rule’ were enriched in cluster #4, with the peak time of expression at

2D histograms (event maps) are shown for the input patterns ‘peak’ (A
and B), ‘switch’ (C and D) and their reverse variants (C and D and G
and H correspondingly). The hotspots on the event maps reveal coherent
switches of gene activity during embryogenesis (local clusters). Both types
of patterns were able to detect shutdown of maternal genes (clusters #1,
#16 and #38), differentiation of ectodenn (clusters #6 and #29), synthesis of
cuticle (clusters #13 and 35) and other events. Massive shutdown/restart of
gene expression occurs early in embryogenesis (stage 4) and at the time of
DC (stage 15, clusters #34 and #43); see panels (F and H).

~38 h, while GO term ‘cuticle’ and CV terms including ‘epidermis’
were enriched in cluster #13 with a peak of expression at 18 h. The
relevant temporal sequence of events predicted by the analysis, along
with the enriched annotation terms, suggested that the identiﬁed
clusters coincide with many of the key developmental processes
taking place during ﬂy embryogenesis. Examples of expression
proﬁles and the corresponding gene expression patterns are shown
in Supplementary Figure S4. Detailed description of each cluster
and lists of genes are available from the UCB online resource.

3.4 Time-duration analysis and conventional clustering
methods

The results of local time—duration cluster analysis were compared
with more conventional clustering methods—hierarchical clustering,
k—means clustering (Eisen et al., 1998) and Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) (Katagiri and Glazebrook, 2009). Conventional
clustering was carried out using Cluster 3.0 program with the
default parameter settings (de Hoon et al., 2004). Supplementary
Figure S6 shows that hierarchical, k—means (Cluster 3.0) and local
clustering (this work) methods produce similar, but not identical
results. Most of the tested methods identify clusters engaged in

common processes, such as maternal genes and cuticle/epidermis
genes. In some cases, the different methods produce gene clusters
that share >50% of the expression proﬁles (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Annotation enrichment levels were comparable for all three
clustering methods using GO and CV annotation (Supplementary
Fig. S6). However, a distinctive feature of the local method was
its ability to retrieve pure local components of gene expression,
matching the search patterns. For example, a major component
of cluster #9 (see the arrow in Supplementary Fig. S6C) is also
present in clusters produced by the other methods (clusters #1 and
#6, Supplementary Fig. S6B), but in these latter clusters contain
additional signals as well.

Sensitivity and selectivity of different clustering methods were
compared based on their receiver operating characteristics (ROC
space, see Supplementary Fig. S7). The local time duration
clustering method consistently produced lower false—positive rates
and somewhat lower true positive rates than the other two methods.
The most striking difference is observed for ‘maternal’ gene
clusters (Supplementary Fig. S7E). 97% of all genes in cluster
#17 (Supplementary Fig. S6C) are associated with this term,
although a large fraction was lost due to the lower sensitivity of
this method. Each clustering method produced a list of enriched
annotation terms not found or poorly enriched by the other two
methods. Some interesting terms, such as ‘pair rule’ (CV, id: 262)
or ‘neuroblasts of ventral nervous system’ (CV, id: 172) were
selectively enriched by the local clustering method (Supplementary
Table S2).

The results of local clustering were also compared with the
results of PCA (Supplementary Fig. S8). Interestingly, the ﬁrst four
principal components (PC1—PC4) were quite similar to some of the
local clusters, but the ﬁfth component and additional components
are quite distinct (Supplementary Fig. S8E). As in the case with the
hierarchical and the k—means clustering, PCA failed to retrieve the
local signals, such as the signal in the largest cluster #9, produced
by local clustering (Supplementary Fig. S6C).

Benchmarking tests based on annotation term enrichment have
shown that the local time—duration clustering method performed
nearly as well as the conventional clustering methods. A distinctive
feature of the local clustering was its ability to retrieve local signals,
matching the search patterns, such as the peaks corresponding
to clusters #6, #7 or #9. Technical differences among the
different clustering methods are summarized in the Supplementary
Table S3.

3.5 Coherent waves of gene expression often precede
major morphogenetic events

Temporal clusters of gene expression might be linked to changes
in embryo morphology. The most dramatic morphological changes
include gastrulation, germ band extension (GBE), GBR and DC.
To investigate the possible connection between these processes and
coherent waves of gene expression, the average values of expression
for the largest local clusters (average proﬁles) were superimposed
on a timescale of major morphogenetic events (Fig. 2). The most
extensive gene clusters do not coincide with morphogenesis, but
rather, they occur either before or after these events. For instance,
the maternal genes (cluster #1) have a peak of expression before
gastrulation and GBE, ectodermal genes (cluster #6) peak between
GBE and GBR, and brain—related genes between GBE and DC

Fig. 2. Bursts of gene activity and morphogenetic movements in ﬂy embryo.
Figure compares the timing of major switches in the gene activity and the
timing of major morphogenetic events. Average expression for each local
cluster is shown; the amplitude is proportional to the number of genes in
each local cluster. (A) The largest clusters produced by the ‘peak on’ pattern.
(B) The largest clusters produced by the ‘switch’ patterns. Morphogenetic
movements often separate the ‘bursts’ of gene activity (see clusters #34 and
#43 on B, separated by DC).

(cluster #7) (Fig. 2A). Thus, gene expression waves appear to be
linked to major morphogenetic events. For instance, GBE separates
the maternal wave of expression from the wave associated with
the speciﬁcation of the nervous system (Fig. 2A). Similarly, DC
separates the gene cluster associated with the nervous system
from those associated with the differentiation of the epidermis
(Fig. 2B).

Many of the coherent gene expression waves identiﬁed in this
study have been observed previously. Thus, Class 11a transcripts
reported by Hooper and co—workers (2007) correspond to clusters
#7 and #43 in this study. Shutdown of class IIa expression coincides
with the activation of classes IIb and IIIa, which is consistent
with co—temporal shutdown of the neural genes (cluster #43) and
activation of epidermal genes (cluster #34) (Fig. 2B). Classes of
transcripts corresponding to local clusters #6 (ectoderm) and #9
(digestive tract) identiﬁed in this study were not previously reported.

There is a lag between the timing of coherent expression waves
and morphogenetic movements. This lag is consistent with a step—
wise mechanism of embryogenesis, whereby tissue speciﬁcation
precedes morphogenetic movements. Speciﬁc examples have been
extensively documented in the literature, including mesoderm
speciﬁcation followed by invagination of the ventral furrow during
gastrulation (Hong et al., 2008). Tissue speciﬁcation coincides with
the deployment of extensive gene networks.

Area on the time/duration parameter space enriched for the term ‘maternal’.
One can see that maternal genes may have peaks of expression at various
time points of embryogenesis, however, only the ﬁrst peak of expression is
signiﬁcantly enriched for the term ‘maternal’. (D and E) Genes associated
with ‘brain’ term may have local peak of expression nearly at any time of
embryogenesis (D), but signiﬁcant enrichment of the term ‘brain’ (D) is
observed only for a single cluster (cluster #7, nerve system on panel A). (F
and G) Cuticle genes have a single peak of expression (F), which coincides
with the area of enrichment for the term ‘cuticle’ (G).

3.6 Re-engagement of genes and gene networks in
embryogenesis

Some genes have multiple peaks of expression during
embryogenesis. Such re—engagement of gene batteries has
been previously reported (Goltsev et al., 2009; White et al., 1999).
For instance, many ‘maternal’ genes are shut down at ~3 h (stage 6),
but are reactivated by 4.5 h (after GBE, stage 10). Some of these
‘maternal’ genes are shut down again at 8h and activated again at
11 h (after GBR, stage 14). Every time, such ‘maternal’ expression
coincides with other waves of gene expression, associated with
different developmental events (compare Fig. 3A and B). However,
the annotation term ‘maternal’ is signiﬁcantly enriched only in
the earliest peak of expression (Fig. 3C). This suggests that the
fraction of ‘maternal’ genes in the later peaks of expression is
signiﬁcantly smaller. Multiple engagements have been detected in
the case of genes associated with the term ‘brain’ (Fig. 3D), while
the ‘brain’ genes were signiﬁcantly enriched only in one temporal
cluster (cluster #7, Fig. 3E). Altogether, (see more examples in
Supplementary Fig. S9) these observations suggest that similar, but
not identical gene networks participate in distinct events. Known
association of the same CV annotation terms with many genes
tested by in situ hybridization supports this view (Tomancak et al.,
2002, 2007).

There are also examples of gene clusters with a single engagement
during embryogenesis. For example, most genes associated with the
GO term ‘cuticle’ had only one peak of expression (Fig. 3F) and this
peak occurs late in embryogenesis, just before the secretion of the
larval cuticle (Fig. 3G). Interestingly, in the mosquito, A. gambiae,

these genes are engaged twice in development due to the secretion
of a serosal cuticle at earlier stages of development; this cuticle is
absent in Drosophila (Goltsev et al., 2009).

Examples of genes with multiple peaks of expression were
retrieved as proﬁles shared by clusters #7, #16 (86 genes) and the
proﬁles shared by clusters #6, #9, #16 (30 genes). The proﬁles
shared by the maternal (#16) and the neural (#7) clusters contained
genes associated with DNA replication (Supplementary Fig. S 10A).
Early expression of these genes may correspond to pre—blastoderm
mitotic cycles 1—9 and blastoderm cycles 10—13. The pause in
expression seen at ~3 h coincides with cellularization. The second
peak in expression occurs during the time when mitotic cycles are
reinstated during gastrulation. Genes shared by three local clusters
(#6, #9, #16, three engagements) were associated with multiple
GO/CV terms and had multiple functions (pleiotropic genes). For
instance, Daughterless (da) (Supplementary Fig. S10B) is a class I
HLH protein that forms heterodimers with class II HLH proteins to
activate transcription (Massari and Murre, 2000). Daughterless has
both maternal and zygotic functions, including sex determination,
neurogenesis, and the growth of imaginal discs (Cline, 1989). Pellino
(1911') family proteins are regulators of kinase activity, components
of the T011 and Toll—like receptor signaling pathways (Schauvliege
et al., 2007). In Drosophila, Toll—receptor signaling is involved in
dorsal—ventral patterning (Rusch and Levine, 1994) and the innate
immune response (Aggarwal and Silverman, 2008). The gene pelota
(pelo) is required for the progression of the cell cycle (Adham et al.,
2003), and for maintenance and self—renewal of germline stem cells
(Xi et al., 2005). The gene shark (Supplementary Fig. S10B) is
a tyrosine kinase that regulates the c—Jun N—terminal kinase (JNK)
pathway (Fernandez et al., 2000). This pathway inﬂuences a number
of developmental processes, including DC (Igaki, 2009).

3.7 Gene networks involved into cell motility and
morphogenesis

While the most extensive waves of coherent gene expression were
observed in the time intervals separating major morphogenetic
events, two waves, containing relatively few genes, were ob served at
the time of GBE (cluster #3) and DC (cluster #10). Genes expressed
during these morphogenetic movements might be expected to play
a role in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and regulation
of actin polymerization. Indeed, cdc42 exhibits peak expression
at the time of both GBE and DC (Supplementary Fig. S10C).
It encodes a GTPase involved in the regulation of actin ﬁlament
polymerization. Maj or morphogenetic events, such as GBE and DC
involve large—scale reshaping of cells and cell movements.

Neurotactin (Nrt) and Ecdysone—induced protein 28/29kD
(Eip71CD) were among other genes expressed at the time of GBE
and DC (Supplementary Fig. S10C). Both genes are expressed
in invaginating mesodermal cells (Supplementary Fig. SlOE, G
and H), while Eip71C is expressed in the dorsal epidermis during
DC (Supplementary Fig. SlOF). Presumably, Eip71C (Ecdysone—
induced protein 28/29kD) is downstream of EcR, a receptor for
Ecdysone that regulates many morphogenetic events, including DC,
cuticle synthesis, and molting (Chavoshi et al., 2010; Thummel,
1997). Another component of ecdysone signaling, ecdysonless (ecd)
(Gaziova et al., 2004; Kozlova and Thummel, 2003) also peaks at
the time of GBE and DC.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The application of time—duration analysis to Drosophila emb—
ryogenesis identiﬁed a link between coherent waves of gene
expression and speciﬁc morphogenetic processes such as GBE
and DC. We also presented evidence that the re—engagement of
pleiotropic genes is associated with common features of these
different processes, such as reorganization of the cytoskeleton. We
suggest that local clustering analysis can be used to supplement
conventional clustering methods, such as hierarchical or k—means
clustering.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Transcriptional regulatory network inference methods
have been studied for years. Most of them rely on complex mathem-
atical and algorithmic concepts, making them hard to adapt,
re-implement or integrate with other methods. To address this prob-
lem, we introduce a novel method based on a minimal statistical
model for observing transcriptional regulatory interactions in noisy ex-
pression data, which is conceptually simple, easy to implement and
integrate in any statistical software environment and equally well per-
forming as existing methods.

Results: We developed a method to infer regulatory interactions
based on a model where transcription factors (T Fs) and their targets
are both differentially expressed in a gene-specific, critical sample
contrast, as measured by repeated two-way t—tests. Benchmarking
on standard Escherichia coli and yeast reference datasets showed
that this method performs equally well as the best existing methods.
Analysis of the predicted interactions suggested that it works best to
infer context-specific TF-target interactions which only co-express lo-
cally. We confirmed this hypothesis on a dataset of >1000 normal
human tissue samples, where we found that our method predicts
highly tissue-specific and functionally relevant interactions, whereas
a global co-expression method only associates general TFs to
non-specific biological processes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcriptional regulatory networks, which emerge from the
combinatorial regulation of the expression of all genes in an
organism by a limited number of transcription factors (TFs),
control the cellular response to internal and external perturb-
ations. At present, direct experimental mapping of complete
transcriptional regulatory networks remains infeasible, particu-
larly in higher organisms, especially since the structure of these
networks is itself condition-dependent (Harbison et al., 2004;
Luscombe et al., 2004). A lot of attention has therefore been

devoted to computationally reconstruct transcriptional regula-
tory networks from compendia of genome-wide gene expression
measurements in diverse conditions, time points, cell types or
genotypic backgrounds (Bansal et al., 2007; Friedman, 2004;
Zhu et al., 2004). However, despite many years of research, it
still remains a question which computational methods are most
suited to tackle this problem. Moreover, regulatory network in-
ference remains a task ﬁrmly in the hands of specialists, and
network inference algorithms are still not routinely included in
standard statistical software packages, unlike for instance differ-
ential expression testing or co-expression analysis. At least in
part this is due to the fact that most network reconstruction
methods depend on non-trivial mathematical concepts such as
mutual information (Faith et al., 2007; Margolin et al., 2006),
differential equations (Bonneau et al., 2006), biophysical models
(Bussemaker et al., 2007), Bayesian networks (Friedman, 2004;
Joshi et al., 2009; Segal et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2004), ensemble
methods (Joshi et al., 2009) or machine learning (Huynh-Thu
et al., 2010). While these complex mathematical models are
well justiﬁed in theory, current gene expression datasets have
high levels of noise and are lacking in resolution, making these
models prone to over-ﬁtting. Furthermore, the resulting algo-
rithms are difﬁcult if not impossible to re-implement, as they
often depend on poorly documented parameter choices and
heuristic techniques, for instance to improve convergence rates
or avoid local optima.

In order to address these problems, we propose a novel
method which is based on a minimal statistical model. The
model assumes that TFs and their targets are both differentially
expressed in a gene-speciﬁc sample contrast, but it makes no
assumption on any functional relationship, be it linear or
non-linear, between the gene expression proﬁles of TFs and
their targets. It should thus be ideally suited to infer regulatory
interactions from noisy, low-resolution gene expression maps.
First, the method identiﬁes for each gene its “critical contrast’,
the separation of samples into two sets across which that gene is
most signiﬁcantly differentially expressed (as determined by
two-way t—tests). Second, the method takes a list of TFs or
other regulatory proteins and calculates their differential expres-
sion in the critical contrast of each possible target gene (again
determined by two-way t—tests). The predicted network is the list
of TF-gene associations, ranked by these t—test P—values, either
considered as a weighted network or cutoff at a desired signiﬁ-
cance threshold.

The idea to use t—tests to predict regulatory interactions was
ﬁrst proposed by Qi et al. (2011). Here, we systematically evalu-
ate the performance of this double two-way t—test procedure
using benchmark expression data (Faith et al., 2007; Gasch
et al., 2000) and networks of known transcriptional regulatory
interactions (Gama-Castro et al., 2008; Monteiro et al., 2008) in
Escherichia coli and yeast, following standard evaluation proto-
cols established by the DREAM community (Prill et al., 2010).
We found that double two-way t—testing performs as well as the
best current methods, especially in yeast. Next, we compared the
top-ranked predictions of each method and found that the t—test
procedure identiﬁes a considerably different set of interactions
than the other methods. In particular, whereas the top-ranked
predictions of the other methods tend to exhibit high levels of
global co-expression between the TFs and their predicted targets,
interactions found by the t—test procedure tend to only co-express
locally and involve TFs that are only expressed under certain
experimental conditions.

We therefore hypothesized that the double two-way t—test
method is particularly useful to predict context-speciﬁc net-
works in multi-cellular organisms. To test this hypothesis, we
applied it to a global gene expression compendium con-
taining >1000 samples from normal human tissues (Lukk
et al., 2010). Although due to a lack of knowledge in human, a
systematic evaluation of the predicted network is impossible,
manual analysis of the top-ranked TFs showed that the func-
tional enrichment of their predicted targets is indeed highly
consistent with known cell-type speciﬁc modes of action for
these TFs.

2 METHODS

2.1 Critical contrast determination

The ﬁrst step of the double two-way t—test procedure consists of deter-
mining the critical contrast for each gene in a gene expression data
matrix. The differential expression of a gene g in a partition (C1, C2) of
the set of samples in two distinct sets can be determined by the ordinary
t—statistic,

t : |M1 — Ml
n1+n2—2 n1n2
where 11.1 and 11.2 are the means of the expression values of gene g
in C1 and C2, respectively, and similarly, 01 and 02 and m and n2
denote the standard deviations and the numbers of conditions in
C1 and C2, respectively. The critical contrast of g is deﬁned as the
partition (C1, C2) with highest value of I. An ordered partition is deﬁned
as a partition where all expression values in C1 are smaller than all ex-
pression values in C2, i.e. max(C1) 5 min(C2). For any non-ordered par-
tition, we can create an ordered one with the same m and 112 by
repeatedly swapping max(C1) and min(C2). It is not hard to see that the
t—statistic for this ordered partition must be higher than for the original
non-ordered partition. Hence, the critical contrast can be determined by
taking the maximum over all ordered partitions, of which there are only
K — 1 per gene, where K is the total number of samples in the dataset. A
minimal number of samples on each side of the partition can be set,

although the factor ./n1 + n2/n1n2 in Equation (1) ensures that the crit-

ical contrast will automatically be balanced (see Supplementary Material
for details).

2.2 Scoring of regulatory interactions

Given a list of candidate TFs or other regulators and a critical contrast
for all possible target genes, we deﬁne the interaction score [ﬁg between a
TF f and target gene g as the t—statistic of f in the critical contrast of g.
The higher tﬁg, the more conﬁdent we are about the predicted regulatory
interaction f —> g. A conﬁdence P—value can be computed from [ﬁg using
a Student’s t-distribution with K — 2 degrees of freedom, where K is the
total number of samples in the dataset.

2.3 Moderated t—statistics and background correction

Some transformations of the interaction score [ﬁg are worthwile to con-
sider. First, because for each gene g, the differential expression of a rela-
tively large number of TFs is tested in the same critical contrast (C 1, C2),
while we expect only few of these TFs to have signifcantly high differen-
tial expression, moderated t—statistics can be used (Smyth, 2004, 2005) to
provide a more stable inference in datasets with a limited number of
samples. Second, to make the interaction scores better comparable be-
tween genes with potentially very different critical contrasts, we can apply
a background correction deﬁned as

1,—M
M, (2)

Z 2
ﬁg 0g

where [ﬁg is the ordinary or moderated t-statistic interaction score, and Mg
and 0g are the mean and standard deviation of [ﬁg over all TFs f for a
given gene g, respectively. Finally, we can also compute the t—statistic of a
target gene g in the critical contrast of TF f and deﬁne a symmetric score

Z};m = 22,, + ng.

2.4 Algorithm implementation

A software tool called TwixTrix is available from our web site, providing
two implementations of the double two-way t—test procedure. The ﬁrst
implementation (in R) uses the Limma package (Smyth, 2005) to calcu-
late moderated t—statistics and background corrected interaction scores
and is recommended for datasets with a small number of samples. The
second implementation (in R or Matlab) encodes the critical contrast
determination and interaction scoring using ordinary t-statistics purely
as matrix operations. It is ultra-fast and recommended for datasets with a
large number of samples.

2.5 Comparison with other network inference methods

We downloaded the latest versions of Inferelator (Bonneau et al., 2006),
CLR (Faith 61 al., 2007), LeMoNe (Joshi et al., 2009) and GENIE3
(Huynh—Thu et al., 2010) from their respective homepages and ran
them with default settings. For LeMoNe and Inferelator, which are
module network inference algorithms, we assigned each gene to a single-
ton module to obtain a TF-gene regulatory network. As a baseline, we
also reconstructed networks based on the Pearson and Spearman correl-
ations. All methods considered provide a ranked list of predicted regula-
tory interactions. Keeping the ﬁrst k interactions, recall and precision are
deﬁned as

TP(k)
N ref

TP(k)

rec(k) = —k ,

 

prec(k) =

where TP(k) is the number of true positives, i.e. the number of known
interactions, among the ﬁrst k predictions and Nref is the total number of
known interactions. The area under the recall—precision curve (AUC)
provides a measure for the performance of each method, see Prill et al.
(2010) for details.

2.6 Gene expression data and reference
regulatory networks

We tested our method on datasets for E. coli, yeast and human. The
E. coli dataset (Faith 61 al., 2007) contains expression values for 4345
genes under 189 conditions. We considered the same 316 candidate regu-
lators and 1882 differentially expressed genes (SD > 0.5) as Michoel et al.
(2009). Results were evaluated using the reference network of RegulonDB
(Gama-Castro et al., 2008). The yeast stress dataset measures the budding
yeast’s response to a panel of diverse environmental stresses (Gasch et al.,
2000). We used the same list of 321 candidate regulators and 2355 dif-
ferentially expressed genes as Segal et al. (2003). Results were evaluated
using the reference network of YEASTRACT (Monteiro et al., 2008).
The human dataset consists of 5372 samples (Lukk et al., 2010), from
which we selected 1033 samples measuring gene expression in 67 diverse
tissues under normal conditions. We reconstructed networks using a list
of 941 candidate TFs from TcoF (Schaefer et al., 2010) and 12568 dif-
ferentially expressed genes (SD> 0.5).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Benchmarking on E. coli and yeast datasets

To benchmark the double two-way t—test procedure, we analysed
its performance on standard E. coli and yeast datasets, by calcu-
lating recall versus precision curves based on the top 3000 pre-
dicted interactions (see ‘Methods’ for details). In Figures 1 and 2,
we compared different versions of double two-way t—test inter-
action scores, namely the t—statistic tﬁg of a TF f in the critical
contrast of a gene g, the background corrected score Zﬁg
(Equation (2)) for the ordinary t—statistic and one for the mod-
erated t—statistic and a symmetrized background corrected score
for the ordinary t-statistic (cf. Section 2.3). Although the symme-
trized version works slightly better in yeast, this is not the case in
E. coli. In order not to overﬁt for a speciﬁc dataset, we choose
the unsymmetric background corrected score for the ordinary
t—statistic (cf. Equation (2)) as the default score, because it per-
forms well in both datasets and is conceptually the simplest and
fastest to compute. All results reported in the remainder of this
article refer to this interaction score.

Next, we compared the double two-way t—test procedure
against six other methods on the E. coli and yeast datasets,

Recall

again calculating recall versus precision curves based on the
top 3000 predicted interactions by each method (Figs 3 and 4).
As has been observed before (Michoel et al., 2009), overall per-
formance in yeast compared with E. coli is lower for all methods.
This may be due to more complex regulatory mechanisms in
eukaryotes versus prokaryotes, a less accurate reference network
against which performance is measured or, most likely, a
combination of these two. Most importantly, neither of the
algorithms is better than all the others in both organisms
(cf. Table 1). TwixTrix, our implementation of the double
two-way t—test algorithm, performs equally good as the much
more complicated algorithms, especially in yeast where it is
ranked second best. Also noteworthy is the fact that in E. coli,
but not in yeast, regulatory interaction prediction based on the
Pearson correlation between TFs and putative target genes also
performs similarly well as the other methods. This suggests that,
generally speaking, TFs and their targets tend to be globally
co-expressed in prokaryotes and the real challenge is to predict
regulatory networks in eukaryotes.

3.2 TwixTrix identiﬁes context-speciﬁc interactions

An important recent insight has been that different network in-
ference strategies identify different aspects of a regulatory
system. Understanding how a method differs from others has
therefore become more important than simple recall—precision
measurements, with the eventual goal to build meta-networks
which integrate predictions from diverse computational methods
(Michoel et al., 2009; Marbach et al., 2010). Here, we focused
on characterizing TwixTrix-predicted interactions in yeast,
where it is most successful relative to the other methods.
The corresponding ﬁgures for E. coli can be found in the
Supplementary Material.

First, we compared the overall similarity of interactions pre-
dicted by each method. The overlap (measured as the number of
common interactions among the top 500 predicted interactions)
ranges from 31 to 232 common interactions. TwixTrix shares
between 31 (with Spearman correlation) and 144 (with
LeMoNe) interactions with the other methods. Using the
number of non-overlapping interactions as a distance measure,
the relative similarities between each of the seven network infer-
ence methods is visualized in Figure 5. As expected, the networks
based on Pearson and Spearman correlation are most similar.
GENIE3 (Huynh-Thu et al., 2010) and LeMoNe (Joshi et al.,
2009) both use decision trees to assign regulators to target genes

CLR GENIE3 Inferelator LeMoNe TwixTrix

Fig. 6. Distribution of Pearson correlations between the top 500 pre-
dicted TF-target interactions in yeast from ﬁve network inference
methods

and consequently predict similar networks as well. TwixTrix,
CLR and Inferelator each occupy a more unique position in
the network inference landscape.

Since TwixTrix is based on differential expression testing, we
hypothesized that it tends to identify TF-target interactions
which do not necessarily co-express under all conditions.
Figure 6 shows the distribution of Pearson correlations between
TFs and their predicted targets for the top 500 interactions in
yeast for each method. Interactions predicted by TwixTrix
indeed have signiﬁcantly lower Pearson correlations than inter-
actions predicted by the other methods. GENIE3, Inferelator
and LeMoNe, which perform less well in yeast than TwixTrix
and CLR, are especially biased towards inferring interactions
which co-express under most conditions in the dataset.

A simple example illustrates the difference between context-
speciﬁc and global interactions. MET32 is a TF involved in the
regulation of methionine (an amino acid) biosynthesis. It has 30
predicted targets in the top 500 network of TwixTrix, of which 9
are known targets, which are strongly enriched for amino acid

Fig. 7. Heatmap showing the expression values of MET32 and HAP4 and their respective highest scoring known targets in the TwixTrix network. Red,
over-expressed, green, under-expressed and black, no change compared with wild-type expression levels

biosynthesis genes (hypergeometric P< 10‘12 after multiple test-
ing correction). The interactions predicted for MET32 are
among the highest scoring by the double two-way t—test, yet
their global Pearson correlation is only 0.64 on average. As
shown in Figure 7, MET32 and its targets are only expressed
under amino acid starvation and nitrogen depletion, resulting in
a strong signal upon differential expression testing despite weak
global correlation. The opposite situation happens for HAP4, a
transcriptional activator and global regulator of respiratory gene
expression. HAP4 has 14 predicted targets in the top 500 net-
work of TwixTrix, of which 11 are known targets, which are
strongly enriched for cell death and oxidative phosphorylation
(hypergeometric P<10_10 after multiple testing correction).
Despite a higher global co-expression between HAP4 and its
predicted targets (average Pearson correlation 0.73), the t—test
scores are relatively low (only two predicted interactions in the
top 100). In contrast, for GENIE3, Inferelator and LeMoNe,
which all favour highly co-expressed interactions (cf. Fig. 6),
the HAP4 predictions are all among the highest scoring true
positive interactions (respectively four, seven and four true posi-
tives in the top 10 predictions). Figure 7 shows that HAP4 and its
targets are all highly expressed under YPD stationary phase and
heat shock conditions, while they are under expressed in glucose
conditions. This results in a strong global, but weaker condition-
speciﬁc signal.

3.3 Tissue-speciﬁc network inference from a human
gene expression atlas

While the ability to detect context-speciﬁc interactions in yeast is
important, the dataset consisted of samples for altogether 10
different experimental conditions (Gasch et al., 2000), making
the distinction between condition-speciﬁc and global interactions
somewhat arbitrary. In contrast, global gene expression maps in
mammalian systems can consist of hundreds of different cell and
tissue types, developmental stages or disease states (Lukk et al.,
2010). To test TwixTrix in such a setting, we applied it to a large

dataset of >1000 samples from 67 normal human tissues (Lukk
et al., 2010 see ‘Methods’ for details).

Because there exists no comprehensive reference database
against which an inferred transcriptional regulatory network
can be validated in human, we manually analysed the top-
ranking TFs and computed the functional enrichment of their
targets in the top 10000 TwixTrix interactions (Table 2). In all
cases, the TFs are expressed only in a very small set of samples
from speciﬁc tissues, which are highly consistent with the most
enriched Gene Ontology (GO) term among their targets. This
supports the hypothesis that double two-way t—testing is indeed
well suited to predict tissue-speciﬁc gene regulatory networks.

As expected, the different characteristics observed in yeast
between TwixTrix and the other, more globally oriented
methods become much more pronounced in the human dataset.
Figure 8A shows the expression proﬁles across all samples for
two representative TFs from Table 2. GCMl is a TF necessary
for placental development. It and its predicted targets (see high-
resolution heatmap in Supplementary Material) are highly ex-
pressed in placental samples (Fig. 8A, top). Likewise, TBX5, a
TF with a role in heart development, and its predicted targets
(see high-resolution heatmap in Supplementary Material) are
highly expressed in samples from the heart (Fig. 8A, bottom).
For both TFs, we took a representative high-scoring target and
created a scatter plot of their respective expression levels (Fig. 9,
blue and red points). These TF-target relations have a well-
deﬁned tissue-speciﬁc off/on behaviour. These highly tissue-
speciﬁc co-expression signals result in very signiﬁcant t—test
scores. However, because of the noisy low-level expression in
all the other samples, such a signal cannot be detected by

expression proﬁles across all samples for two representative
high-scoring TFs in the CLR network. Both have a characteristic
proﬁle that ﬂuctuates across different tissue types. BBX (Fig. 8B,
top) is a TF necessary for cell cycle progression from G1 to S
phase and ZNF24 (Fig. 8B, bottom) is a TF involved in promot-
ing the cell cycle in the developing central nervous system.

Context-specific transcriptional regulatory network interface

 

For both of them, their CLR-predicted target sets (see high-reso-
lution heatmaps in Supplementary Material), though highly co-
expressed across most samples, are only enriched for non-speciﬁc
functional categories such as regulation of gene expression or
metabolic process. A scatter plot of TF-target expression levels
for a representative target for both TFs conﬁrms that they show
a high linear correlation across most samples (Fig. 9, green and
black points). CLR predictions thus clearly represent general
processes which are globally co-expressed and not conﬁned to
a single tissue or cell type.

GENIE3, Inferelator and LeMoNe could not be applied with
reasonable runtime on the complete human dataset. We there-
fore reduced the size of the dataset by averaging samples from
the same tissue type. Results on this reduced dataset conﬁrmed
that all methods except TwixTrix give highest rank to globally
co-expressed TF-target pairs involved in general cellular pro-
cesses, although the relation between the expression of TFs
and their predicted targets tends to be more non-linear for
GENIE3 and LeMoNe than for CLR and Inferelator
(see Supplementary Material for details, including a runtime
comparison between all algorithms). As a particular example
of non-tissue-speciﬁc interactions, GENIE3 and LeMoNe pre-
dict 35 and 36 targets, respectively, among their top 200 predic-
tions for the TF FOXMl, which are strongly enriched for M
phase (P< 10‘”) and mitotic cell cycle (P< 10‘”), respectively.
FOXMl is a transcriptional activator involved in cell prolifer-
ation which is indeed known to regulate the expression of several
cell cycle genes.

4 CONCLUSION

Reconstructing transcriptional regulatory networks from
genome-wide gene expression data remains an important bio-
informatics challenge. Although diverse mathematical and com-
putational methods have been proposed to address this problem,
they have not been as successful as might originally have been
expected. A possible reason is that current gene expression data-
sets are too noisy and lack the resolution for adequately ﬁtting
complex mathematical models. Here, we analysed a method
which, rather than adding to the complexity of network inference
methods, uses a minimal statistical model for associating TFs to
putative target genes without assuming any linear or non-linear
functional relationship between their expression proﬁles. The
method is based on a double two-way t-test which assesses the
differential expression of a TF in the critical sample contrast of
all genes. Essentially, this results in a local co-expression measure
which appears well suited to capture context-speciﬁc transcrip-
tional activity, at the expense of giving less weight to globally
co-expressed TF-target pairs.

In bacteria, much of the cellular response to perturbations is
controlled at transcriptional level only, such that many TF-target
pairs are co-expressed under all experimental conditions. Here,
the double two-way t-test therefore does not improve upon exist-
ing methods. In yeast however, there is evidence of known tran-
scriptional interactions which only co-express under speciﬁc
conditions. The t-test procedure prioritizes such interactions
and indeed performs better in yeast than E. coli, relative to the
existing methods.

Taking this one step further, we hypothesize that the double
two-way t-test method for inferring regulatory interactions
will be particularly useful to analyse global gene expression
maps in multi-cellular organisms which combine data from hun-
dreds of different samples. Indeed, we conﬁrmed that our
method predicts highly tissue-speciﬁc and functionally relevant
interactions from a dataset of >1000 normal human tissue sam-
ples, whereas global co-expression methods only associate gen-
eral TFs to non-speciﬁc biological processes.

In view of the time it takes to experimentally generate large
expression compendia, judging a network inference method by
its running time is perhaps not very relevant. Nevertheless, we
note that, depending on hardware details, the t-test procedure
took not more than a few seconds to analyse the human dataset,
while the other methods needed from a few hours upto several
days. Having a fast method is clearly beneﬁcial, e.g. to easily
compare results from different normalizations of the data, or
from different subsets of a large data compendium, e.g. from
normal versus disease states, cell lines versus tissue samples, etc.

In summary, we believe that the double two-way t-test method
provides a useful addition to existing network inference methods,
whose primary strength lies in prioritizing context-speciﬁc regu-
latory interactions from global gene expression maps which in-
tegrate data from hundreds to thousands of samples from diverse
experimental treatments, cell types, tissues, developmental stages
or individuals.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex
diseases, genetic variants having real but weak associations often
fail to be detected at the stringent genome-wide significance level.
Pathway analysis, which tests disease association with combined
association signals from a group of variants in the same pathway, has
become increasingly popular. However, because of the complexities
in genetic data and the large sample sizes in typical GWAS, pathway
analysis remains to be challenging. We propose a new statistical
model for pathway analysis of GWAS. This model includes a fixed
effects component that models mean disease association for a group
of genes, and a random effects component that models how each
gene’s association with disease varies about the gene group mean,
thus belongs to the class of mixed effects models.

Results: The proposed model is computationally efficient and uses
only summary statistics. In addition, it corrects for the presence of
overlapping genes and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Via simulated
and real GWAS data, we showed our model improved power
over currently available pathway analysis methods while preserving
type I error rate. Furthermore, using the WTCCC Type 1 Diabetes
(T 1 D) dataset, we demonstrated mixed model analysis identified
meaningful biological processes that agreed well with previous
reports on T1 D. Therefore, the proposed methodology provides
an efficient statistical modeling framework for systems analysis of
GWAS.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome—wide association studies (GWAS) have become a main
approach for identifying disease genes. These studies examine
large numbers of genetic polymorphisms across the genome in
hundreds or thousands of samples at a time. So far, GWAS have

identiﬁed many genetic variants statistically associated with diseases
or traits (Hindorff et al., 2009; Manolio et al., 2008). However, for
complex diseases, typically individual genetic variants only have
weak marginal effects on disease risk, even for real associations.
Therefore, after multiple comparison adjustment for the large
number of tests performed in GWAS, real but weak associations
are likely to be missed by the conventional strategy of considering
only the most signiﬁcant hits (McCarthy et al., 2008).

To help increase power and to better understand the disease
mechanisms underlying complex diseases, several recent studies
(Chasman, 2008; Holmans et al., 2009; Torkamani et al., 2008;
Wang et al., 2007) considered GWAS Pathway Analysis (GWASPA)
(Cantor et al., 2010). These approaches test for effects of groups of
genetic variants that belong to the same biological pathway such as
those deﬁned in kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG;
Ogata et al., 1999) or Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000)
databases. The underlying assumption is that complex diseases are
likely to be caused by changes in activities in biological pathways,
where a number of mutations in different genes each contributes
a modest amount to disease predisposition but works together to
cause major disruption in normal biological processes. Higher power
in pathway—based analysis is achieved by combining weak signals
from a number of individual genetic variants in the pathway.

Recently, a number of GWASPA approaches (Chen et al.,
2010a, b; De la Cruz et al., 2009; Ruano et al. 2010; Wu
et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2009 ), such as the modiﬁed gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) algorithm (Mootha et al., 2003;
Subramanian et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007) have been proposed.
Typically, to preserve correlation patterns between genes, P—Values
are estimated by permuting sample labels. However, for a typical
GWAS, the recalculation of test statistics for half a million or
more single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) with hundreds or
even thousands of samples for each permutation is extremely
computationally intensive. In addition, a recent review (Cantor
et al., 2010) comments: ‘the permutation studies that are currently
being conducted require raw genotype data, which are not always
available. An important methodological improvement would make
the P—values alone, and not raw data, the basis of analysis in
GWASPA’.

When raw genotype data are not available, a simple and popular
approach for pathway analysis is an over—representation analysis
based on Fisher’s exact test. This method condenses test statistics

Efficient hierarchical GLMM for pathway analysis

 

for multiple SNPs within a gene into a single value (usually by
choosing the most signiﬁcant P—Value), classiﬁes each gene as
signiﬁcant or not based on a pre—speciﬁed signiﬁcance threshold,
and then compares the proportion of genes signiﬁcantly associated
with disease in a pathway versus the rest of the genome. The Fisher’s
exact test and its extensions have been implemented in a number
of software programs such as the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA, http:llwww.ingenuity.com/), SNPtoGO (Schwarz et al., 2008),
PRP (Chen et al., 2009), ALIGATOR (Holmans et al., 2009) and
JMP Genomics (http://www.jmp.com/genomics). However, when
the threshold for declaring signiﬁcant genes changes, the results
of pathway analysis based on Fisher’s test can differ. In addition,
because genes in the same pathway are expected to regulate or
interact with each other, the assumption that these genes are
independent may not be tenable.

A further difﬁculty for GWASPA is that it is not immediately clear
what strategy should be used for the SNP information reduction for
each gene. When each gene locus is represented by a single SNP, the
potential effects of multiple association signals for the gene would
be missed. Moreover, for overlapping genes, bias may be introduced
when SNPs mapped to multiple genes are highly signiﬁcant, because
these SNPs would be included multiple times in the dataset and
pathway signiﬁcance may be driven by only a few of these SNPs.

In this article, to address these analytical challenges, we propose
an efﬁcient, threshold—free, hierarchical generalized linear mixed
model (GLMM) for GWASPA. The proposed model has several
desirable properties: (i) It is computationally efﬁcient: only summary
statistics are needed; raw genotype data, which may not be available
due to conﬁdentiality concerns (Homer et al., 2008), are not required.
(ii) We model all the genes and SNPs within a pathway in a
hierarchical fashion using random effects, which provide the ability
to borrow information across genes in the same pathway. Our
method corrects for the presence of overlapping genes and linkage
disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs. (iii) The proposed model
improves power over currently available pathway analysis methods
while preserving type I error rate. (iv) In addition to identifying
pathways associated with diseases, genes that contribute most to
pathway association with disease can be identiﬁed using shrinkage
estimates of best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP; McCulloch and
Searle, 2001). (V) Covariate information, environmental effects and
other complex design factors can also be accommodated using ﬁxed
and random effects in the mixed model.

In Section 2, we will discuss a few mixed models, including our
proposals for modeling overlapping genes and LD patterns across
genes and SNPs within a pathway. In Section 3, we will use both
simulated and real GWAS dataset to show our proposed model has an
increased power over currently available methods while preserving
type I error rate for identifying disease associated pathways. Finally,
using GWAS dataset from the WTCCC T1D study, we will show
that mixed model analysis identiﬁes meaningful biological processes
and genes that agree well with previous reports on T1D.

2 METHODS
2.1 From SNPs to pathways

There are several pre—processing steps for pathway analysis of GWAS
datasets:

(1) Determine the pathway database to be used. For the analysis of
the real GWAS dataset in Section 3.2, we used gene sets from the
C2—CP collection and C5—BP collection of the Molecular Signature
Database (MSigDB; Subramanian et al., 2005). The C2—CP gene sets
are biological processes compiled by domain experts and the C5—
BP gene sets are derived from controlled vocabulary of the Gene
Ontology project (Ashburner et al., 2000).

(2) Assign SNPs to genes. For the analysis in Section 3.2, we assigned
SNPs to a gene if they were located within 5 kb upstream of the ﬁrst
exon or downstream of the last exon.

(3) Assign genes to pathways. We linked genes to pathways based on
HUGO Gene symbols. After this step, we obtained a dataset with SNP
identiﬁers linked to genes in each pathway for subsequent statistical
analysis.

2.2 General structure of the proposed mixed models

We propose a new method for GWASPA using a class of statistical models
called mixed effects models. These models include a systematic or ﬁxed
effects component that models the mean disease association for a group of
genes, and a random component that models how each gene’s association
with disease varies about the gene group mean, thus called the mixed effects
model. In the analysis of gene expression data, mixed models have been
successfully applied to both single gene and pathway analysis (Chu at 611.,
2002; Wang et al., 2008; Wolﬁnger et al., 2001). For single marker analysis
in GWAS, mixed models have been successfully applied to account for
population structure (Yu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2010) and to incorporate
prior biological information (Chen and Witte, 2007; Conti and Witte, 2003).

More speciﬁcally, to assess pathway association with disease, we propose
two mixed models (see details in Supplementary Fig. 1) with the following
general structure: let yij be the chi—squarestatistic for SNP j on gene i, based
on the Cochran—Armitage trend test for a single SNP, we assume yl-j follows a
chi—squaredistribution with mean )vl‘j, denoted as yl-j ~ X2()\.l‘j). Assuming SNP
j on gene i is not associated with disease, we have Ail- =1 or Log (2,7)20.
Next, for each pathway, pooling all SNPs mapped to genes in the pathway,
we formulate the following model:

10g()\.l‘j)=7']l‘j=ﬁ+I/li i=1,...,g;j=1,...,s,-

where g is the number of genes in the pathway; 5,- is the number of SNPs
on gene i; p is a ﬁxed (intercept) effect; and u1,...,ug ~N(0,G) are random
gene effects and G is gene—gene covariance matrix.

To test for pathway association with disease, we test the null hypothesis.

H02ﬁ=0

Because the random gene effects have mean 0, statistical signiﬁcance (of
departure from 0) for p would indicate an overall association with disease

for pathway SNPs. Under H0, the test statistic B/se  follows t distribution

with n—rank[X Z] degrees of freedom (where n is the number of SNPs in
the pathway and X and Z are design matrices for ﬁxed and random effects,
respectively). When the number of SNPs (n) is large, this is approximately the
standard normal distribution; therefore, the null distribution for test statistics
in mixed model does not depend on gene set size for pathways with a large
number of SNPs.

In the above model, the dependent variable yij is assumed to follow the chi—
square distribution which belongs to the exponential family of distributions.
Therefore, this model is a generalized linear model. Furthermore, since both
ﬁxed and random effects are included, it is a GLMM.

2.3 Detailed description of the mixed models

When devising the mixed models, we considered two important and
challenging issues in pathway analysis: (i) accommodating overlapping
genes, where a single SNP is mapped to more than one gene and
(ii) accounting for the correlations between SNPs due to LD.

Fig. 1. Design matrix for model (A), for a hypothetical gene set with three
genes and three SNPs: SNPA is on gene 1, SNP B is on genes 1 and 2, SNP
C is on genes 2 and 3. The outcome variable for the mixed model is the
chi—square statistic for Cochran—Armitage trend test for single SNP.

For the ﬁrst mixed model (A), we assume the random effects u1,...,ug ~
N (0,021). Figure 1 shows a coding scheme for the independent variables,
where the ﬁxed effect 6 is an intercept and the random effects u1,...,ug are
indicator variables for each gene. For issue (i), note that each SNP appears
only once and thus contributes only once to the overall pathway association
test statistic. To address issue (ii), using matrix algebra (McCulloch and
Searle, 2001) it can be shown that for SNPs j and j’ on the same gene
i, COT/(Lily, ...,u,-j/)=oz,j 75]” so the random effects u1,...,ug account for a
homogeneous covariance pattern between the SNPs in the same gene. To
account for any additional variability due to unstructured covariance between
SNPs on different genes, using the fact that chi—square distribution is a
special case of gamma distribution, we increase the ﬂexibility of the model
by assuming ylj~gamma()v,-j,¢) where Ail- is the mean parameter and phi
is the scale parameter. The inclusion of an additional scale parameter is
a common mechanism to account for over—dispersion in generalized linear
models (McCulloch and Searle, 2001).

Supplementary Figure 1 shows the details for these models. Model (B)
is similar to Model (A), except that in Model (B), we propose modeling the
covariance between genes in the gene set based on physical locations of the

genes.
Let in, ...,u,-/ be random gene effects for genes i and i’, respectively. The
spatial model (B) assumes cov[u,-,...,u,/]=oze_dii’/“ where the distance

measure dig is calculated based on Euclidean distance between physical
locations of genes i and i/ (averaged over all SNPs mapped to the gene).
The parameters 02 and 06 can be estimated automatically by maximizing the
pseudo (restricted) maximum likelihood using PROC GLIMMIX of SAS
software (Version 9.1, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

2.4 Empirical null distribution estimation

To further improve the accuracy of signiﬁcance testing, rather than
relying on asymptotic approximations, we pooled the estimated t—statistics
corresponding to B for all gene sets, and estimated gene set P—values
based on the empirical null distribution (Efron, 2010), which is a normal
distribution with empirically estimated mean (3 and standard deviation 6.
Efron (2008, 2010) showed that in large—scale simultaneous testing situations
(e.g. when many gene sets are tested simultaneously in a study), serious
defects in the theoretical null distribution may become obvious, while
empirical Bayes methods can provide much more realistic null distributions.
The empirical null distribution can be estimated using the locfdr package in
R statistical software. Note that for each study, the empirical null distribution
only needs to be estimated once, and can be accomplished in a few
seconds, so this step adds little computational complexity to the proposed
algorithm.

In summary, we followed the following ﬁve steps for signiﬁcance testing
of gene sets:

(1) For each gene set, ﬁt an appropriate mixed model and obtain its
t—statistic corresponding to 6.

(2) Convert the t—statistic to a z—score. For example, let t,- be the t—statistic
for gene set i, the corresponding z—score can be obtained by 2,:
CID—1(Fd(t,-)) where CD and Fd are distribution functions for standard
normal distribution and t distribution with d degrees of freedom.

(3) Pool the z—scores for all gene sets tested in a study and calculate their
median value (m). Subtract m from the z—scores so that they have
median of 0.

(4) Given the median—centered z—scores, use the locfdr package, estimate
location (8) and scale (0) parameters of the empirical null distribution.

(5) Calculate standardized z—scores, s,- = (z,- —m—3)/6, and compute the
P—value for each gene set as p,- = 1 — CI>(s,-).

2.5 Ranking of individual gene contribution to the gene
set signal

As gene sets are deﬁned based on existing knowledge in biological processes
without considerations for any speciﬁc disease, typically only a subset of
the genes in the pathway have genetic variations associated with disease
susceptibility. Therefore, for signiﬁcant gene sets, it is helpful to identify the
subset of genes contributing to the gene set signiﬁcance. Toward this end,
we deﬁne the inﬂuential subset of genes, which are those genes contributing
most to the gene set signal, to be those genes with estimated mean 3+2,-
higher than the estimated overall mean B for the gene set. Recall in the
general mixed model (Section 2.2), u,- models the deviation of each gene’s
average chi—square statistic (on a log scale) from the gene set mean 6.
In other words, the inﬂuential subset includes all genes with ill->0 or
equivalently 3+2,- >  Furthermore, we can rank these inﬂuential genes
by their estimated individual gene estimate 8+2. Under the mixed model
framework, these estimates are called empirical BLUP; they are shrinkage
estimates that borrow information across all genes in the gene set and
naturally fall into the hierarchical empirical Bayes framework. We illustrate
ranking and selection of the inﬂuential genes in the pathways using a GWAS
dataset in Section 3.2.

2.6 Design of a simulation experiment

To study the properties of the proposed mixed models, we simulated both
null gene sets, for which the disease status of the samples were generated
randomly, and causal gene sets, for which the disease status were generated
based on a genetic model.

For the null gene sets, we used a genotype dataset of the genetic
association information network (GAIN) GWAS for schizophrenia (Group
at al., 2007). The details of data preparation were provided in our
previous work (Jia et al., 2010). It includes 1158 schizophrenia cases
and 1378 normal controls of European ancestry. After quality control
and mapping SNPs to the pathways in the C2—CP collection of MSigDB
(http:l/www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb), we obtained 596 gene sets with
size ranging from 3 to 200 genes. For each pathway, we generated random
disease status for the samples from a Bernoulli distribution (with parameter
P=0.5), so that by the experiment’s design, SNPs in these pathways were
not associated with the disease. This process was repeated twice, so that
we had two sets of random outcomes for each pathway for a total of 1192
(596 x 2) null gene sets.

Next, for the causal gene sets, we generated genotype data for 12000
samples representing an entire population of patient samples, and for each
causal gene set, we sampled 500 cases and 500 control samples based on
disease prevalence of 0.05. Since genotype data for many more samples
were needed, instead of using an existing GWA dataset, we used the HAP—
SAMPLE software (Wright et al., 2007) to simulate a genotype dataset with
realistic LD patterns. HAP—SAMPLE simulates genotype datasets by re—
sampling chromosome—length haplotypes from existing phased datasets, such
as the HapMap dataset, thus preserving realistic genetic data structure. Given
simulated genotype data, the samples’ disease statuses were then simulated
based on a genetic model with various parameters modeling the strengths of

associations between pathway SNPs and the disease. More speciﬁcally, we
followed these steps to generate the causal gene sets:

(1) Simulate genotype data: the median number of genes for pathways in
the C2—CP collection of MSigDB is 23. Therefore, for this simulation
study, we selected the ATM pathway with 23 genes. The SNP IDs of
the 262 SNPs (corresponding to the 23 genes in the ATM pathway)
were entered into HAP—SAMPLE and the Caucasian cohort (CEU)
from HapMap Phase II Project was used as the source data. We next
used HAP—SAMPLE to generate genotype data for a total of 12 000
samples, representing the entire population of samples.

(2

V

Simulate disease status for the samples: after ﬁxing the genotype data,
we next simulated case—control status for each sample based on the
following genetic model:

1085/1—f}=ﬁ0+ﬁ181+ﬁ282+~~+ﬁngn
where g,- = 0, 1, 2 represents the number of copies of the minor allele

for SNP i(i= 1,  ,D) andf 2 Probability (affected lgl,  ,gD) is the
penetrance for genotype {g1,  , gD}.

The number of causal SNPs (D) associated with disease in the pathway
were set at an average of t 20.5, 1 and 1.5 per gene, so thatD =t >< agene. The
ﬁrst D SNPs with the lowest RSID numbers (dbSNP assigned reference SNP
ID), which mapped to several different genes, were selected to be the causal
SNPs. We generated 61-0: 1,D) from N (tutz) where the mean log odds
ratio a = log(1.1) and r2 20.3 and 0.5. Under this setup, 6,- can be positive
or negative, therefore each simulated pathway included causal SNPs with
minor alleles increasing or decreasing risk of disease.

Next, given disease prevalence K (= 0.05) and 61-0: 1,...,D), 60 were
estimated by maximizing the equation

K=Z---ZPr(gt, ...,gD)f(gt,...,gD)
g1 gD

Finally, given values for 60, {61, ...,6D}, and genotype data {g1, ...,gD}, we
computed f and generated disease status for each sample using the genetic
model above. From the pool of 12 000 samples [step ( 1) in this section], the
genotype data for the ﬁrst 500 cases and 500 controls were then selected.

In Table 2, for each simulation dataset, we included 100 causal gene sets
[generated by repeating step (2) in this section 100 times] and the same set
of 1192 null gene sets (generated by adding random sample labels to gene
sets based on GAIN schizophrenia genotype data). The type I error rate and
power were estimated by the proportion of mixed model with P < 0.05 for
the null gene sets or the causal gene sets, respectively.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Results of simulation study

First, we assessed the accuracy of the estimated empirical null
distributions for each mixed model. In Table 1, each simulation
dataset consisted of 100 causal gene sets and 1192 null gene sets.
For the mixed models, given the t—statistics corresponding to ,6
from models (A) and (B), as discussed in Section 2.4 [following
the Steps (2)—(4)], we estimated the empirical null distributions
using the locfdr package in R software. Since the same 1192 null
gene sets were included in each simulation dataset, the estimated
parameters 6,8 and 130 for the empirical null distribution are
expected to be the same across all datasets. Among all models, the
parameter estimates were most consistent for model (B), indicating
the estimated empirical null distribution was most accurate for this
model.

Next, for each simulation dataset, we estimated the type I error rate
for each model. Under the null hypothesis, we expect the P—values to
follow a uniform distribution, so a model with type I error rate equal

to or less than the signiﬁcance level of 0.05 is desirable. Among all
models, again, Model (B) had type I error rate closest to the expected
error rate of 0.05. Model (A) also had reasonable type I error rate.

Finally, we assessed the power of the proposed models. Table 2
shows the estimated power (based on 100 causal gene sets in each
simulation dataset) for the mixed models and Fisher’s exact tests. For
Fisher’s test, a Cochran—Armitage trend test P—value was computed
for each SNP, and the most signiﬁcant SNP was selected to represent
each gene. To classify each gene as signiﬁcant or not, we used
P—value cutoffs of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 for Fisher0_01, Fisher0_05 and
Fisher0_1 in Table 2, respectively. When the number of causal SNPs
in the gene set was moderate (t: 1, where t is the average number
of causal SNPs per gene: 1) or high (t:1.5), all models except
Fisher0_05 and Fisher0_1 performed well. When the number of
causal SNPs in the gene set was low (t = 0.5), model (B) performed
best, followed by model (A). As expected, the results of Fisher’s
exact test varied when different thresholds were used to classify each
gene as signiﬁcant or not, with Fisher0_01 and Fisher0_1 having the
most and least power, respectively.

Note that in these simulation datasets, disease outcome for each
sample was generated randomly or based on a genetic model for the
null and causal gene sets, respectively, it was difﬁcult to evaluate
performance of permutation—based pathway analysis methods such
as GSEA, where only a single set of disease outcomes is allowed
for all genesets in a dataset. Therefore, we next analyzed the GAIN
schizophrenia dataset with real disease outcomes, to compare the
power of mixed model (B) with GSEA, permutation—based Fisher’s
exact test and one other recently proposed method—ALIGATOR
(Holmans et al., 2009). Previously, we analyzed this dataset using
GSEA (Wang et al., 2007) and permutation—based Fisher’s exact
test (or hypergeometric test) for a set of 511 curated pathways (Jia
et al., 2010). Using the exact same dataset, we next performed
analysis with mixed model (B). Figure 2 shows that model (B)
identiﬁed more signiﬁcant gene sets than the other methods. For
example, the number of signiﬁcant gene sets with P < 0.05 identiﬁed
by mixed models, Fisher’s exact test, GSEA and ALIGATOR were

For Fisher’s test, a Cochran-Armitage Trend test P-value was computed for each SNP, and the most signiﬁcant SNP was selected to represent each gene. To classify each gene as
signiﬁcant or not, we used P-value cutoffs of 0.01 (Fisher0_01), 0.05 (Fisher0_05) and 0.1 (Fisher0_1).

26, 10, 5 and 8, respectively. Note that these comparisons based on
real disease outcomes are meaningful since as shown in Table 1,
type I error rate for mixed model (B) was preserved for the same
GAIN genotype dataset with random outcomes. Therefore, model
(B) improved power over currently available GWASPA methods,
while controlling false positive rate.

3.2 Application to Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium T1D GWAS dataset

To further validate the proposed methodology, we next applied
mixed model (B), which performed best in the simulation study,
to the GWAS dataset from the Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium (WTCCC) Type 1 diabetes study. Similar to the analysis
of GAIN dataset, we collected and tested gene sets deﬁned by
the canonical pathway (C2—CP) and biological process (C5—BP)
collections of the MSigDB. We replaced the KEGG gene sets in
C2—CP with the May 2010 version of KEGG gene sets. To reduce
the amount of multiple testing and to avoid testing gene sets for
which biological annotations are too broad, we used gene sets with
size from 3 to 200 genes. This resulted in a total of 1273 gene sets
for our testing. For each pathway, in order to assign SNPs to genes,
we followed the procedures outlined in Section 2.1. On a Linux
computer with a 3.00 GHz processor and 8 GB memory, computing
time was 4 h and 33 min for this mixed model analysis of 1273 gene

sets. This indicates that mixed model (B) can be run efﬁciently for
large GWAS dataset.

Table 3 and Supplementary Table 1 show the results based
on model (B). After correcting for multiple comparisons, model
(B) identiﬁed 16 gene sets that are signiﬁcantly associated (false
discovery rate <0.2) with T1D. These pathways included antigen
processing and presentation, interleukin—1 secretion and T—cell signal
transduction and duplicate longstanding associations between these
biological processes and T1D. Antigen processing and presentation
was demonstrated to be associated with T1D more than 35 years
ago (Nerup et al., 1974) and our ﬁndings of an association between
SNPs in HLA-C, HLA-C and HLA-G of the major histocompatibility
region and T1D indicate that the proposed mixed model could
effectively detect biologically signiﬁcant results (WTCCC, 2007).
The identiﬁcation of interleukin—1 pathway is another important
replication because IL-1 was one of the ﬁrst cytokines studied and
has been shown to cause toxicity to islet cells, impairing their ability
to produce insulin (Zawalich and Diaz, 1986). Finally, association
of SNPs in genes involved in T—cell signal transduction mimics
knowledge that lymphocytes are the effector cells of T 1D, shown just
years after the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) discovery
when T1D was passively transferred from man to mouse through a
lymphocyte transfusion (Buschard et al., 1978).

Additionally, the recent study by Eleftherohorinou et al. (2009)
also found that SNPs located in genes in the J ak—STAT signaling
pathway were associated with T1D, a ﬁnding duplicated by this
method. In addition, SNPs located in or near the genes CTLA4, 1L2
and IL2RA have been repeatedly shown to be associated with T1D
and were also found signiﬁcant in this analysis (Barrett et al., 2009;
Consortium, 2007). CTLA4 is a member of the immunoglobulin
superfamily that sends an inhibitory signal to T cells, while 1L2 and
IL2RA may both be involved in the decreased synthesis of IL-2 in
lymphocytes from patients with T1D (Zier et al., 1984).

4 DISCUSSION

In summary, we have described several GLMMs for pathway—based
analysis of GWAS. This ﬂexible, uniﬁed and practical approach
can be implemented in common statistical packages. Our method
makes several improvements over currently available algorithms for
pathway testing.

First, the proposed methodology represents our attempts at
rigorous statistical modeling of disease association with biological

pathways in GWAS without resorting to individual—level genotype
data, which are often unavailable to non—owner investigators. In
particular, this approach should make large—scale meta—analysis
much more convenient and practical, since currently meta—analysis
often requires numerous multi—institution effort to share and
coordinate genotyping data. Even when raw genotype data are
available, the re—calculation of test statistics for thousands of samples
in GWAS for each permutation can be computationally demanding.
In contrast, maximum likelihood estimation and testing for the
proposed mixed model using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS software
for a typical gene set can be achieved in seconds.

Second, in our proposed mixed model, all the genes in a pathway
and all the variants across each gene locus were carefully modeled
in a hierarchical fashion. In addition, the correlations between
SNPs (due to LD) were modeled based on the spatial distances
between genes. Furthermore, for SNPs mapped to overlapping
genes in the same pathway, the proposed mixed model include
each SNP once and only once. In contrast, methods that select a
most signiﬁcant SNP to represent each gene may have difﬁculties,
because signiﬁcant SNPs mapped to multiple genes would be
included multiple times and pathway signiﬁcance may be driven
by only a few of these SNPs. This kind of false discoveries has
been frequently encountered in our analysis. For example, in the
GAIN schizophrenia dataset, the ‘starch and sucrose metabolism
pathway (HSA00500)’ included several genes located closely on
the chromosome (e.g. UGTIAI, UGTIA3, UGT1A4, UGTIAS,
UGTIA6, UGTIA7, UGTIA8, UGTIA9, UGTIAIO and others).
When the most signiﬁcant SNP was used to represent each gene,
most of the genes in the cluster were represented by the same SNP.
Therefore, if this SNP has a small P—value, the pathway would very
likely be identiﬁed as a signiﬁcant pathway, while in fact, the result
was driven by one highly signiﬁcant SNP located on multiple genes.

Third, using real and simulated GWAS dataset with realistic LD
patterns, we have shown that the proposed mixed model improved
power over currently available methods while preserving type I error
rate. Unlike traditional pathway analysis method such as Fisher’s

exact test where each gene is classiﬁed as signiﬁcant or not based
on an arbitrary signiﬁcance threshold, the proposed model uses
continuous information in P—values to help improve power.

Fourth, the proposed model represents a ﬂexible methodology that
operates within a well—established statistical framework. In addition
to identifying pathways associated with disease, as explained in
Section 2.5, this model can also identify genes contributing most
to the pathway association. Moreover, it can be easily extended to
handle more complex designs with multiple sources of variations
such as covariate information and environmental effects, when
it is difﬁcult to justify the exchangeability assumption behind
permutation tests.

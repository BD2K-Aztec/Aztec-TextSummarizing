Abstract

Motivation: Solubility is one of the fundamental protein properties. It is of great interest because of
its relevance to protein expression. Reduced solubility and protein aggregation are also associated
with many diseases.

Results: We collected from literature the largest experimentally verified solubility affecting amino
acid substitution (AAS) dataset and used it to train a predictor called PON-Sol. The predictor can dis-
tinguish both solubility decreasing and increasing variants from those not affecting solubility. PON-
Sol has normalized correct prediction ratio of 0.491 on cross-validation and 0.432 for independent
test set. The performance of the method was compared both to solubility and aggregation predictors
and found to be superior. PON-Sol can be used for the prediction of effects of disease-related substi-
tutions, effects on heterologous recombinant protein expression and enhanced crystallizability. One
application is to investigate effects of all possible AASs in a protein to aid protein engineering.

1 Introduction

Numerous experimental methods are used to investigate variations af-
fecting protein function, structure and properties. In addition, compu-
tational approaches are increasingly utilized for predicting effects and
mechanisms of variations. Solubility has been of great interest because
of its relevance to protein (over)expression. Reduced solubility and
protein aggregation are associated with many human diseases.
Solubility is very important also for protein structural studies.
Solubility and aggregation are related but different physical con-
cepts. Solubility means concentration in saturated solution where
the soluble protein is in equilibrium with solid phase (Arakawa and
Timasheff, 1985). Protein in solid phase may be made soluble by di-
lution. In case of aggregation, protein is in solid phase but this pro-
cess is typically accompanied by changes to protein structure,

integrity and/or modification (Arakawa and Timasheff, 1985 ).
Aggregation is an irreversible process occurring for example in
Alzheimer’s disease and systemic amyloidoses.

During the last decade computational methods have been de-
veloped to predict protein solubility especially for heterologous pro-
tein overexpression. These methods utilize different approaches,
typically in the field of machine learning.

Much less effort has been put on predicting the effects of vari-
ations to protein solubility. It is well known that amino acid substi-
tutions (AASs) can have profound effects on solubility and lead to
diseases including severe complex V deficiency (Meulemans et al.,
2010) and cataract (Andley and Reilly, 2010). Until now two tools
have been released for such predictions OptSolMut (Tian et al.,
2010) and CamSol (Sormanni et al., 2014).

2 Methods

Our data includes three kinds of variants: those increasing or
decreasing solubility and those that do not affect solubility. As there
was no database available, we performed an extensive literature
search in PubMed and collected 443 AASs from 71 proteins
(Supplementary materials). Leucine, arginine and lysine are the most
frequent original residues (Supplementary Table 51). Alanine is the
most common substituted residue which is probably because alanine
scanning approach is frequently used in solubility experiments.
Substitutions to serine are also frequent. Otherwise the variants are
widely spread.

The dataset was split into two parts: a training set containing 397
variations and a blind test set of 46 variations. We further split the
training dataset into 5 partitions. The partitions were done so that
the variations from the same protein and closely related proteins were
always kept in the same partition (Supplementary Table S2).

In total, 1080 features based on amino acid sequence were col-
lected to train a machine learning method for solubility prediction,
including 617 amino acid features from AA index database
(Kawashima and Kanehisa, 2000), 2 conservation features based on
SIFT prediction (Ng and Henikoff, 2003), 436 variation type features
and 25 neighborhood features (Supplementary materials).

Random forests (RF) algorithm implemented in R package was
used for classification. To eliminate the redundant and non-relevant
features we used a two step combined greedy feature-selection
algorithm as previously described (Niroula et al., 2015) (see
Supplementary Fig. S1).

For comprehensive reporting of the binary classifiers, we used a
number of measures as previously suggested (Vihinen, 2012, 2013).
For 3-class predictors, the correct prediction ratio (CPR) and
squared correlation (GCZ) were calculated instead of accuracy and
MCC, respectively (Baldi et al., 2000).

3 Results

We designed a 2-layer RF predictor called PON-Sol that classifies the
variants into three classes. In the first step, it predicts whether the
variants lead to increased solubility or not. Then the variants that do
not increase solubility are classified into those that decrease or have
no effect on solubility (Fig. 1). Five features were informative for in-
crease/no-increase classifier and eight for decrease/no effect classifier
(Supplementary Table S3).

The normalized CPR of PON-Sol is 0.491 and 0.432 in 5-fold
cross validation (CV) and blind test, respectively (Supplementary
Tables S4 and S6). Note that the result for a random predictor
would be 0.333 as there are three classes.

We tested the performance of two previously published methods:
CamSol correctly predicted 100 variations out of 392 with normal-
ized CPR 0.353. OptSolMut requires 3-D protein structure. 83 vari-
ations in our CV dataset which were not used to train OptSolMut
could be mapped to protein 3-D structures. 22 variations were cor-
rectly predicted by OptSolMut with normalized CPR 0.280
(Supplementary Table SS).

We tested also some general solubility and aggregation pre-
dictors whether they could predict the protein solubility effects due
to the substitutions. We compared the predicted solubility scores for
the normal and variant sequences (Supplementary Table SS). These
results are similar to the dedicated tools OptSolMut and CamSol,
and clearly worse than for PON-Sol.

In the blind test, PON-Sol also has the best performance among
the tested methods (Supplementary Table S6).

4 Web service and application

PON-Sol is freely available as a web service at http://structure.bmc.
lu.se/PON-Sol. The user can provide either a list of variations and
protein gi numbers or a protein gi for all possible AASs.

PON-Sol could be used for designing variations in protein engin-
eering. As an example we applied PON-Sol to human interleukin-1ﬁ
(gi: 157831412). We predicted the solubility change for all possible
2907 (15 3’19) AASs and studied the distribution of solubility
increasing and decreasing variants in the 3-dimensional protein
structure (Supplementary Fig. 52). The variants that have the highest
predicted probability to affect solubility are listed in Supplementary
Table S7.

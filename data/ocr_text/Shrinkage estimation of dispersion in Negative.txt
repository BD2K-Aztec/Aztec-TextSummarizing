ABSTRACT

Motivation: RNA-seq experiments produce digital counts of reads
that are affected by both biological and technical variation. To distin-
guish the systematic changes in expression between conditions from
noise, the counts are frequently modeled by the Negative Binomial
distribution. However, in experiments with small sample size, the
per-gene estimates of the dispersion parameter are unreliable.
Method: We propose a simple and effective approach for estimating
the dispersions. First, we obtain the initial estimates for each gene
using the method of moments. Second, the estimates are regularized,
i.e. shrunk towards a common value that minimizes the average
squared difference between the initial estimates and the shrinkage
estimates. The approach does not require extra modeling assump-
tions, is easy to compute and is compatible with the exact test of
differential expression.

Results: We evaluated the proposed approach using 10 simulated
and experimental datasets and compared its performance with that
of currently popular packages edgeR, DESeq, baySeq, BBSeq and
SAMseq. For these datasets, sSeq performed favorably for experi-
ments with small sample size in sensitivity, specificity and computa-
tional time.

1 INTRODUCTION

Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) technology
(Mardis, 2008; Metzker, 2009; Wang et al., 2009) quantiﬁes gene
expression in biological samples in counts of transcript reads
mapped to the genes. Accurate and comprehensive, it has
made a major impact on genomic research (Garber et al.,
2011; Oshlack et al., 2010; Pepke et al., 2009). One common
goal of RNA-seq experiments is to detect differentially expressed
genes, i.e. genes for which the counts of reads change between
conditions more systematically than as expected by random
chance (Oshlack et al., 2010). Statistical methods for detecting
differentially expressed genes must reﬂect the experimental de-
sign and appropriately account for the stochastic variation.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Moreover, many RNA-seq experiments serve as high-throughput
screens of a small number of samples with the goal of subsequent
experimental validation. Therefore, the analysis must handle a
relatively small number of biological replicates.

A variety of statistical methods and software has recently been
proposed for detecting differentially expressed genes. These in-
clude DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010), edgeR (Robinson and
Smyth, 2007; Robinson et al., 2010), baySeq (Hardcastle and
Kelly, 2010), SAMseq (Li and Tibshirani, 2011), BBSeq(Zhou
et al., 2011). We briefly overview these methods. We further
propose a direct and effective approach for characterizing the
variation in the counts of reads, which improves the sensitivity
and speciﬁcity of detecting differentially expressed genes for ex-
periments with small sample size. We support this approach with
an open-source R-based software package sSeq.

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 The Negative Binomial distribution

The input to the statistical analysis is a set of discrete counts of
reads in each experimental run. Although the counts can be
modeled with the one-parameter Poisson or Geometric distribu-
tions (Auer and Doerge, 2011; Li et al., 2011; Marioni et al.,
2008), it is often advantageous to use the two-parameter
Negative Binomial distribution (Anders and Huber, 2010;
Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010; Robinson and Smyth, 2007;
Robinson et al., 2010). This distribution is more general and
flexible and can be viewed as a generalization of both Poisson
and Geometric distributions (Supplementary Materials). We
focus on the Negative Binomial distribution in what follows.
Denote X gij as the random variable that expresses the counts
of reads mapped to gene g (g = l, . . . , G) in sample (or, equiva-
lently, library) j (j = l, ...,n,) in condition i and denote xgij as
the observed values. For simplicity, we consider two conditions
(i = A,B); however, the discussion holds for pairwise compari-
sons of conditions in experiments with more complex designs.
We are particularly interested in situations where n A and n B are
small, e.g. l—4. We consider the following parametrization:

X gij ~ NB(ugi,¢g), where ,ug, Z 0, qbg Z 0, such that
2 denoted 
 = Mgi: Var{Xgij} = Mgi 4‘ MgiCbg ( = Vgi)
The dispersion parameter qbg determines the extent to which

the variance Vg, exceeds the expected value Mg,- (Cameron and
Trivedi, 1998; McCullagh and Nelder, 1989).

2.2 Motivation for the proposed approach

The estimation of Var{Xg,-j} is the main focus of this work and is
based on the following considerations.

(1) A na'ive approach is to estimate Var{Xg,-j} using the
method of moments (i.e. the per-gene sample variance).
However, it is highly variable in experiments with a
small sample size (Croarkin and Tobias, 2006).

(2) RNA-seq experiments simultaneously quantify the expres-
sion of many genes. The genes share aspects of biological
and technical variation, and therefore a combination of
the gene-speciﬁc estimates and of consensus estimates
can yield better estimates of variation. Such approaches
are increasingly popular with RNA-seq experiments
(Anders and Huber, 2010; Robinson and Smyth, 2007).

(3) The variance of the Negative Binomial distribution is a
known function of the expected value ,ug, and of the dis-
persion og. Therefore, an accurate estimation of the dis-
persion (e. g. by combining the gene-speciﬁc and consensus
estimates, without explicitly modeling its relationship to
,ugi) can lead to an accurate estimation of the variance
while preserving the mean—variance relationship.

(4) Finally, constraints of throughput sample availability or
cost may restrict the number of biological replicates.
Although experiments with little or no biological replica-
tion have poor reproducibility and are undesirable, such
under-replicated screens are the only practical option in
some situations (Malo et al., 2006; Markowetz, 2010).
They can only detect large changes in expression and re-
quire an extensive downstream validation with complemen-
tary low-throughput experiments and large sample size. To
detect differentially expressed genes, we assume that the
majority of the genes are not differentially expressed, and
that for these genes, the samples from all conditions can be
Viewed as biological replicates (Robinson and Oshlack,
2010; Robinson et al., 2010). Under this assumption, a con-
sensus estimate of dispersion helps to improve the accuracy
of gene-speciﬁc estimates of variation.

Our main concern is in how to (i) accurately deﬁne the consensus
estimate of dispersion and (ii) accurately combine the gene-spe-
ciﬁc estimates of dispersion with the consensus estimate.

2.3 Existing approaches for RNA-seq experiments

Among the existing methods, edgeR (Robinson and Smyth,
2007; Robinson et al., 2010), DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010)
and baySeq (Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010) assume the Negative
Binomial distribution, and SAMseq (Li and Tibshirani, 2011)
and BBSeq (Zhou et al., 2011) use other ﬂexible models. The
approaches have been extensively evaluated (Soneson and
Delorenzi, 2013) and are broadly used. Hardcastle and Kelly
(2010) found that the performance of DESeq, edgeR and
baySeq is superior to that of DEGseq (\Nang et al., 2010), Li
and Tibshirani (2011) found that SAMseq improves on
PoissonSeq (Li et al., 2011). We brieﬂy overview these
approaches in the historical order. Table 1 summarizes the
discussion.

Probability model. edgeR models the count of reads with the
Negative Binomial distribution. It includes normalization,
which accounts for the changes in read counts owing to technical
artifacts such as different sequencing depth. The normalization
factor can be the total library size (i.e. the number of reads in the
library). A more accurate normalization factor is the ‘effective’
library size m}, which multiplies the size of the library ij by a
robust estimate of the log-fold change of the total count in con-
dition i as compared with a reference run (Robinson and
Oshlack, 2010). The parameter pg,- in row (b) of Table l is the
probability that a single read maps to gene g for a sample in
condition i. The model assumes that the dispersion parameter is
gene speciﬁc but constant across conditions. For experiments
without replication versions up to 2.4.6 assumed a common dis-
persion in all the genes. The subsequent versions discourage
unreplicated experiments. Finally, generalized linear models for
the Negative Binomial response are available.

DESeq also models the count of reads with the Negative
Binomial distribution. It normalizes the read counts by a size
factor Sij (Anders and Huber, 2010).

The size factor can be thought of as the ‘representative’ ratio of
counts in the library to the geometric mean of the counts in all
the libraries, and differs from the ‘effective’ library size in edgeR.
The parameter ,ug, in row (0) of Table l is the expected normal-
ized expression of gene g in condition i. DESeq allows speciﬁca-
tion of separate variances for genes and conditions and models
the variances as functions of the expected values. This relation-
ship can be a ﬂexible smooth function (local polynomial) or a
parabolic function 17g,- 2 Sij - ﬁg,- + 5%. - it; - (a0 + a1 Lily), where
a0, a1 >0 are constants. Alternatives based on generalized linear
models for the Negative Binomial response are also available.

The baySeq speciﬁes the same probability model as edgeR;
however, it proposes a different Empirical Bayes characterization
of the between-library variation. The baySeq assumes that sub-
sets of the libraries share the parameters of Negative Binomial
distribution and derives an empirical prior distribution for the
corresponding parameter sets. After integrating over the empir-
ical priors, the dispersion in the integrated likelihood is constant
across conditions and different between the genes. The default
normalization parameter is the library size.

BBSeq speciﬁes a Beta-Binomial generalized linear model.
Using the logit link, it connects the expected probability of a
read for gene g in condition i and sample j to the linear combin-
ations of predictors, such as indicators of conditions and other
covariates. The dispersion parameter can be independent from the
mean (free model) or dependent on the mean (constrained model).
SAMseq uses a fully non-parametric approach.

Estimation of dispersion. edgeR maximizes a weighted combin-
ation of the conditional log-likelihoods with per-gene dispersion
and of the conditional log-likelihood with common dispersion.
Conditional likelihoods generalize the restricted maximum like-
lihood estimation for a discrete response by conditioning on the
sum of the read counts per class and improve the statistical
properties of dispersion estimates. The estimation requires

calculating pseudocounts of reads that would have been obtained
with libraries of equal size and an iterative computational opti-
mization. For experiments with few replicates, the estimates tend
to be discrete values (Lloyd-Smith, 2007; Piegorsch, 1990; Toft
et al., 2006). For experiments with many replicates, edgeR spe-
ciﬁes a generalized linear model. As conditional likelihoods
cannot be easily extended to this case, these are further approxi-
mated by adjusted proﬁle likelihoods (McCarthy et al., 2012).

DESeq starts by estimating per-gene means and variances of
the normalized counts in each gene and condition by the meth-
ods of moments. Next, it re-estimates them by ﬁtting the postu-
lated relationship between the expected values and the variances.
The estimates of dispersion can be back-calculated from the es-
timates of variance as shown in row (0) of Table 1. For experi-
ments without replication, DESeq assumes that the majority of
the genes are not differentially expressed, and combines the sam-
ples across conditions to estimate the variance. The same strategy
is used with the generalized linear models.

The baySeq relies on an iterative estimation of the relative gene
expression and of the dispersion. Given an initial partition of the
libraries into subsets and an initial estimate of the relative gene
expression, it estimates the dispersion using the quasi-likelihood
approach. Given the estimates of dispersion, it re-estimates the
relative gene expression by maximizing the integrated likelihood.
This is repeated for different partitions of the libraries.

BBSeq estimates the dispersion using maximum likelihood for
the free model. For the constrained model, it uses the estimates
from the free model for all the genes, ﬁts the postulated

relationship to the mean and re-estimates the dispersions.
SAMseq sidesteps the need to estimate the dispersion by using
a fully non-parametric approach.
Testing. For the Negative Binomial model, edgeR tests the null
hypothesis H0 : pgA = pr, and DESeq H0 : ,ugA = ,ugB separ-
ately for each gene. Both edgeR and DESeq use the exact test,
which is free from asymptotic arguments and is therefore pre-
ferred. The test statistic for a gene is the total (normalized) count
of reads in all the replicates of a condition. The P—Value is the
probability of the normalized read counts per group such that
under H0 their probability is same or lower than the probability
of the observed counts, conditional on the total counts equal to
the observed. With the generalized linear models, edgeR and
DESeq use the asymptotic likelihood ratio or Wald tests.
baySeq ranks the genes by their posterior probabilities of dif-
ferential expression. BBSeq tests the coefﬁcient of the linear pre-
dictor (i.e. condition) in the generalized linear model with the
asymptotic Wald test. SAMseq uses a resampling strategy to es-
timate the distribution of the test statistic and the P—Values.

The proposed approach combines aspects of the existing approaches, but
is simpler, requires fewer assumptions and streamlines the computation.
It is summarized in Table la. More details regarding the method and its
implementation in sSeq are in Supplementary Materials.

E{Xgij} = Mgi Sij: and var{Xgij} = Mgi Sij + Méﬂg Sij (4)

We follow edgeR, DESeq and baySeq by specifying a Negative Binomial
distribution. As in experiments with a small sample size, it may be difﬁ-
cult to distinguish the true dependency of dispersions on expected values
from artifacts of random variation, the model speciﬁes free gene-speciﬁc
dispersion parameters (pg. As the initial versions of edgeR, we specify a
common dispersion across conditions, i.e. (pg/1 = ¢gB degredog. As a con-
sequence, the counts of differentially expressed genes have different vari-
ances in each condition.

We follow DESeq in normalizing the counts by the size factor Sij.
However, in the proposed normalization, the size factor affects not
only the expected value but also the dispersion. Equation (4) shows
that under this assumption the size factor linearly scales both E{Xg,-j}
and Var{Xg,J-}. Such linear scaling is consistent with the technical variation
in RNA-seq experiments, which can be characterized by the Poisson dis-
tribution (Marioni et al., 2008). As typical size factors are close to 1, the
proposed model has little practical difference from the model in DESeq.
However, as shown in Supplementary Section 2, it allows us to directly
conduct the exact test and contributes to the accuracy of the results.
Estimation of dispersion. Similarly to DESeq, we start by estimating the
dispersion parameters by the methods of moments. A conservative esti-
mate of the per-gene variance in experiments with a small sample size is
obtained by pooling the samples across conditions, i.e.

Unfortunately, in experiments with small sample size, $3M are unsatis-
factory owing to high variance (Bowman, 1984; Clark and Perry, 1989;
Willson et al., 1984). Next, we improve the statistical properties of these
estimates by introducing shrinkage.

Stein (1956) showed that when we estimate the expected values of three
or more independent Normal random variables with known constant
variance, shrinking the per-dimension estimates toward a target value 5
produces biased estimates, but reduces the mean squared error (MSE) for
all choices of S. The shrinkage estimator by James and Stein (1961)
(Lehmann and Casella, 1998; Richards, 1999) implements this strategy.
More recently, Hansen extended the approach of James and Stein with a
generalized shrinkage estimator, (Hansen, 2008). Hansen’s shrinkage can
be used with any per-dimension estimator with an arbitrary sampling
distribution (not necessarily Normal), for which the Central Limit
Theorem holds. Speciﬁcally, it requires that the true parameter lies in a
neighborhood of the restricted parameter space, and that the estimator is
asymptotically Normal with a consistent variance. Estimators by the
method of moments satisfy these criteria. Applied to the estimation of
(pg, and assuming that the per-gene estimates are independent, the gen-
eralized shrinkage estimator is

values of 6 shrink the estimates closer to the pre-deﬁned target 5.

We use the Hansen’s generalized shrinkage estimator (1325“! in conjunc-
tion with the Negative Binomial distribution to test genes for differential
expression. Although the assumption of $3M being independent variables
is simplistic, it is a suitable approximation for experiments with a small
sample size. A similar assumption is made, e.g. by DESeq when modeling
the variance as function of the mean. Although the asymptotic argument
cannot be justiﬁed in this context, we show empirically in Section 5 that
(1325“! performs well in practice.

Hansen showed that the estimator in Equations (7) and (8) reduces the
asymptotic MSE for all choices of targets 5. However, a good practice is
to select a value for S that maximizes this reduction. To this end, we

Figure 1a Visualizes the functional form of ASD(.§) for a simulation in
Section 4 and shows that the tail of the curve ﬂattens for large 5.
Therefore, we can also minimize the bias by minimizing 5 while enforcing
the constraint that ASD(.§) is comparably small. In practice, sSeq esti-
mates 5 by calculating the slope of ASD($) and setting

5 = argming { —e < slope(ASD(.§)) < 0} (11)

for a small constant e such as e = 0.05. The selected value is shown by the
vertical line in Figure 1a.

Figure 1b illustrates the fact that the proposed shrinkage estimator is a
linear transformation of $3M. The slope of the transformation is
(1 — 6) e (0, 1), and the ﬁxed point is the shrinkage target 5. The shrink-
age increases the per-gene estimates of dispersion that are smaller than S
and decreases the values that are larger than S. From our experience with
multiple datasets, i? is often around the 95.5th quantile of $3M. In other
words, it biases the majority of the estimates towards conservative values.

The proposed estimate of dispersion has analogies in methods de-
veloped for other high-throughput technologies. For example, it is similar
in spirit to the moderated variance estimator in the package Limma
(Smyth, 2004, 2005), which is also a linear combination of per-gene
and consensus estimates.

Testing. We follow edgeR and DESeq by testing H0 : MM 2 ugB per gene
with the exact test. The test statistic is X g,., i.e. the sum of the read counts
in each condition. Under H0, the P-values are calculated with respect to

the reference distribution X g,. 119N 8(ZS1'J' - pg, (pg/  and are ad-

Hochberg, 1995). See Supplementary Materials for more details.

Extensions to experiments with complex designs. The proposed approach
can be extended to pairwise comparisons of conditions in experiments with
more complex designs without recurring to a generalized linear model and
without additional assumptions. See Supplementary Materials for details.

all genes and is favorable to sSeq. Simulation2 assumed that qbg is
a non-linear function of ,ug, i.e. qbg = 1 / (100 4— ,ug) and as such is
favorable to DESeq. Simulation3 is most realistic. From the
dataset by Bottomly et al. (2011) (Frazee et al., 2011), the largest
experimental dataset in this manuscript, we selected a subset of
non-differentially expressed genes (as determined by a consensus
of sSeq, edgeR and DESeq) and sampled pairs (125M, ﬁll”) from
this subset as the true parameters for simulating read counts.

MAQC (Shi et al., 2006) is the dataset from the MicroArray
Quality Control (MAQC) consortium, comparing three libraries
from Ambion human brain reference RNA against two libraries
from Stratagene human universal reference RNA. The libraries
were sequenced with the Illumina platform, resulting in 19 580
genes. A subset of the genes from four of the libraries was assayed
by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (Shi et al., 2006; Zhining
et al., 2010). We used the 323 differential genes and 85 non-differ-
entially expressed genes determined by real-time reverse-transcrip-
tion PCR as the ‘gold standard’. Although the dataset only has
technical replicates, it has been used extensively as the benchmark
in the past (Arikawa et al., 2008; Bullard et al., 2010; Patterson
et al., 2006).

Grifﬁth et al. (2010) compared ﬂuorouracil (5-FU)-resistant
human colorectal cancer cell lines MIP101 against their non-
resistant counterpart MIP/5-FU24. One library from each con-
dition was quantiﬁed with the paired-end Illumina platform,
resulting in 27145 genes. In all, 197 of these genes from the
same samples were assayed by quantitative PCR. We used 12
truly differential genes and 19 truly non-differentially expressed
genes as determined by quantitative PCR as the ‘gold standard’
for method comparison.

Brooks et al. (2011) compared untreated cells of Drosophila
melanogaster against cells cultured in presence of Pasilla, the
homologue of the mammalian Nova-1 and Nova-2 protein.
Two biological samples per condition were sequenced with the
paired-end Illumina platform, resulting in 14470 genes.

Sultan et al. (2008) (Frazee et al., 2011) compared two biolo-
gical replicates of human cell lines Ramos B and HEK293T with
the Illumina platform, yielding 6 573 643 uniquely aligned reads.

Bottomly et al. (2011) (Frazee et al., 2011) compared brain
tissues of two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/
2] (D2), using the Illumina platform. The analysis of 10 and 11
biological samples per condition resulted in 13 932 genes.

Hammer et al. (2010) (Frazee et al., 2011) compared gene ex-
pression in rat strains Sprague Dawley and L5 SNL Sprague
Dawley 2, at two times (2 weeks and 2 months) in a factorial
design. Two distinct biological libraries per condition and per
time slot were quantiﬁed using the Illumina platform, resulting
in 18635 genes.

Tuch et al. (2010) compared the expression of genes in normal
human tissues and in tissues with oral squamous cell carcinoma.

5 RESULTS

In addition to sSeq, the following versions of the existing packages
were used: edgeR v3.0.8 (January 2013), DESeq V1 . 10.1 (October
2012), baySeq V1.12.0 (October 2012), BBSeq V1.0 (March 2011),
SAMSeq as part of the R package samr V2.0 (June 2011).

For sSeq, all the datasets were analyzed with the exact test,
and analyses of the Hammer and the Tuch datasets accounted
for their experimental designs. For edgeR and DESeq, the data-
sets with two-group comparisons were analyzed with the exact
test, and Hammer and Tuch datasets were analyzed with the
glm-based approaches. For edgeR, the estimateCommonDisp
function in an older version of edgeR package (v2.4.6) was
used to analyze unreplicated datasets. For DESeq, the option
ﬁtType=‘loca1’ was used to estimate the per-group variance.
The default parameters were used otherwise. See Supplementary
Materials for details and representative R scripts.

5.1 sSeq accurately estimates the variation

As the proposed approach shares most similarities with edgeR
and DESeq, we compared their estimates of dispersions and vari-
ances in more details. Figure 10, e and g use the simplest case of
Simulation1 to illustrate the estimates by the method of moments
and by the three approaches. As expected, ﬁll” have a high
variance, which increases with the mean. Also as expected, esti-
mates by dgseq are biased towards larger values but have smaller
deviations from the true values as compared to of”. Estimates
by the other two methods ﬁt the pattern of of”.

Figure 1d, f and h show that despite the differences in disper-
sion estimation, the estimates of variance by the three methods
are less different. This is due to the fact that the values of the
dispersions are small as compared with the means, and that the
variances in Equation (1) are highly inﬂuenced by the expected
values. As a result, the bias in the estimation of the dispersion
has a low impact on the overall estimation of variation.
Supplementary Materials provide plots for the other datasets.

The ﬁrst two columns of Table 2 show that the bias also has
little impact on the performance of detecting differentially ex-
pressed genes, as the performance of sSeq, edgeR and DESeq

are relatively similar. sSeq has a slightly higher area under the
ROC curves.

Figure 1d, f and h also provide an insight into why shrinking
the method of moments estimates of dispersion is more beneﬁcial
than shrinking the method of moments estimates of variance. On
the log scale the relationship between the mean and the variance
in the Negative Binomial distribution is roughly linear for large
mean counts. Mathematically, from Equation (1)

10g(Vgi) = 10g(Mgi+ Mﬁicbg) = 10g(ugi)+10g(ugi¢g + 1)
large pg,- )
10g(Vgi) ~ 2 - logwgi) +10g(¢g)

A shrinkage of the variance estimates would multiply them by
(1 — 6) g 1 and would distort the slope of the mean—variance
relationship in Equation (1) away from Equation (2). The shrink-
age of the dispersion parameter, on the other hand, preserves this
nominal mean—variance relationship. Our results (shown in
Supplementary Materials) conﬁrmed that shrinking the variance
leads to inferior performance.

To further investigate the usefulness of multiple shrinkage tar-
gets, we partitioned the genes into 10 groups according to the
ranges of ,0?” and applied the shrinkage separately to each
group. Our results (not shown here) indicated that there is no
advantage in specifying multiple shrinkage targets.

5.2 sSeq accurately detects differential expression

Five datasets with an external ‘gold standard’ were used to evalu-
ate the sensitivity and the speciﬁcity of detecting differentially
expressed genes. For each method, the genes were ranked by
FDR-adjusted P-Value of posterior probability and termed ‘sig-
niﬁcant’ for varying cutoffs. The sensitivity and the speciﬁcity of
differential expression was compared with the ‘gold standard’
and summarized with ROC curves. Table 2 shows that the pro-
posed approach consistently had a similar or a higher accuracy
as compared with the existing methods.

Five datasets without an external ‘gold standard’ were used to
evaluate the sensitivity and the speciﬁcity less formally, as dis-
cussed in (Anders and Huber, 2010). First, comparisons of two
conditions (‘A vsB’) had some truly differentially expressed genes.
Therefore, methods with higher sensitivity should have higher
areas under the empirical cumulative distribution functions

Fig. 2. The ECDF curves of detecting differential expression for the datasets with no external ‘gold standard’. Y-axis: ECDF, function of the gene rank.
x-axis: P—Value or 1 minus posterior probability. Solid line: two randomly selected replicates from a same condition (AVSA). Dotted line: one randomly
selected replicate from each condition (unreplicated AVSB). Dashed line: AVSB on the full dataset for two- group designs. Dashed-dotted line: AVSB on the
full dataset for more complex designs. Gray line: 45 degree. SAMseq is not applicable to unreplicated experiments and is excluded. The desired patterns
are high areas under the AVSB curves, and AVSA curves that are at or below the 45 degree line

Second, comparisons of replicates of a same condition (‘AvsA’)
had no differentially expressed genes. Therefore, methods with
higher speciﬁcity should have ECDF curves at or below the 45
degree line. For baySeq, we expect similar patterns of the ECDF
curves based on the posterior probability cutoff. Figure 2 sum-
marizes the curves for the ﬁve datasets. It shows that sSeq pro-
duced most consistently the expected pattern and had a similar
or a higher accuracy as compared with the existing methods.

The effect of sample size and of size factors on the accuracy
was investigated using the three simulated datasets. Supplemen-
tary Section 4.4 and 4.5 indicate that sSeq is particularly advan-
tageous for experiments when n g 4.

6 DISCUSSION

In this manuscript, we advocated a model that speciﬁes free per-
gene dispersion parameters in the Negative Binomial model for

counts of RNA-seq reads. We also advocated a biased estimation
of these parameters, which can reduce the variance of the esti-
mates and minimize the overall MSE. Biased estimation is dif-
ferent from specifying a probability model (such as in DESeq)
that assumes a true systematic relationship of the true variance
and the true mean. It is particularly useful for experiments with a
small sample size, where the systematic relationship may be dif-
ﬁcult to evaluate. The shrinkage estimates are easy to compute,
avoid iterative estimation, minimize the potential for overﬁtting
and do not require extra computation time. They are compatible
with the exact test of differential expression. For the datasets in
this manuscript, sSeq consistently had a similar or a higher sen-
sitiVity and speciﬁcity of detecting differential expression than
the existing methods. The approach can be generalized to express
the dependence of the dispersions on the expected value or on
other covariates such as guanine-cytosine (GC) content or Gene
Ontology annotations.

sSeq can produce meaningful results in under-replicated RNA-
seq screens. However, we stress that RNA-seq screens do not
eliminate the biological variation in gene expression Equation
(12). As evidenced by Table 2 and Figure 2, the under-replicated
screens have lower reproducibility as compared with the repli-
cated studies. Multiple biological replicates are necessary to ad-
equately assess the full extent of the variation in the biological
system. Therefore, the under-replicated screens can only be con-
ducted when followed by a rigorous experimental validation with
complementary technologies and adequate sample size.

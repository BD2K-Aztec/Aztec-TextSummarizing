Abstract

Motivation: In optogenetics, designing modules of long or short signaling state lifetime is neces—
sary for control over precise cellular events. A critical parameter for designing artificial or synthetic
photoreceptors is the signaling state lifetime of photosensor modules. Design and engineering of
biologically relevant artificial photoreceptors is based on signaling mechanisms characteristic of
naturally occurring photoreceptors. Therefore identifying residues important for light—dark transi—
tion is a definite first step towards rational design of synthetic photoreceptors. A thorough grasp of
detailed mechanisms of photo induced signaling process would be immensely helpful in under—
standing the behaviour of organisms.

Results: Herein, we introduce the technique of differential networks. We identify key biological
interactions, using Iight—oxygen—voltage domains of all organisms whose dark and light state crys—
tal structures are simultaneously available. Even though structural differences between dark and
light states are subtle (other than the covalent bond formation between flavin chromophore and ac—
tive site Cysteine), our results successfully capture functionally relevant residues and are in com—
plete agreement with experimental findings from literature. Additionally, using sequence—structure
alignments, we predict functional significance of interactions found to be important from network
perspective yet awaiting experimental validation. Our approach would not only help in minimizing
extensive photo—cycle kinetics procedure but is also helpful in providing first—hand information on
the fundamentals of photo—adaptation and rational design of synthetic photoreceptors in
optogenetics.

1 Introduction

 

Optogenetics aims to confer light sensitivity to genetically encoded
molecules (Deisseroth et 61]., 2006), thus controlling multifarious or-
ganismal functionalities with great spatiotemporal precision. While
the initial motivation might have been the targeting of neur—
onal pathologies using natural photoreceptors or photosensors,
optogenetics has grown beyond the use of naturally existing photo—
receptors. With clever accommodation of biologically inspired de—
sign of artificial photosensors, optogenetics is now being used
extensively to target any significant cellular event. To decipher the

synchronization of molecular events among the components of the
signaling network, it is essential to understand the signaling states of
photosensors in utmost detail. Light sensitive modular proteins usu—
ally consist of two parts, photosensor (or input domain, that absorbs
light) and effector (or output domain, that executes biological func—
tion of that particular protein) and thus enable them to carry out the
desired physiological activities such as phototropism, plant morpho—
genesis, visual perception in animals and so on. Combination of
X-ray protein crystallography, ultrafast spectroscopic techniques
and mutagenesis studies have identified and validated some of the

major contributing amino acid residues responsible for light—dark
transition, elaborated later. However, the individuality of photosen—
sors in terms of direction of signal flow, distinct topological arrange—
ment specially in light—oxygen—voltage (LOV) terminals demands
further investigation.

LOV domains, first discovered in A. thaliana (Huala et al.,
1997), have served as candidate sensors for designing light regulated
proteins/molecules (Moglich et al., 2009; Strickland et al., 2008).
LOV domains are part of Per—Arnt-Sim (PAS) super-family of recep-
tor proteins (Moglich et al., 2010) which control varied biological
functions in plants, animals and prokaryotes. LOV photoreceptors
absorb blue light by binding to an organic, non—protein component,
namely ﬂavin chromophore (FMN or FAD) to initiate photo—cycle
which is usually reversible in nature. Photon absorption leads to for—
mation of cysteine—flavin adduct state (Crosson and Moffat, 2001),
commonly known as light state, resulting in a cascade of signaling
processes within the domain. This thermally activated signaling state
may sustain itself for timescales of few seconds to few hours and
then converts back to the non—signaling state or the so called dark
state. The most prominent effect of photon—absorption is the forma-
tion of cysteine—flavin adduct. Though this is well established for
many plant LOVs, a detailed comprehension of the underlying
mechanism of the ensuing signal transduction is still in its prelimin-
ary stage. For reasons aforementioned, flavin mono nucleotide
(FMN) chromophore has not been taken into consideration during
network construction and subsequently the conserved cysteine resi—
due, that bonds with FMN chromophore, does not feature in the
present analysis.

The goal of this work is to identify important residues in path—
way(s) of long—range transmission of structural changes that ori—
ginate in the chromophore and its immediate environment upon
absorption of a photon, by introducing new techniques. Herein,
we introduce the technique of differential networks. Knowledge of
the aforementioned residues in photoreceptors and their import—
ance is obtained from these differential networks. We successfully
identify functionally important residues for the light—dark transi—
tion which are in total agreement with experimental findings from
previous literature. We also submit predictions on specific func—
tionally important residues which can be experimentally verified.
Thus, the methods proposed here should be helpful in mitigating
the need of extensive mutagenesis studies (Gleichmann et al.,
2013; Zayner et al., 2013). Moreover, precise idea on such partici—
pating residues in this transition, would greatly benefit the under—
standing of molecular mechanisms behind photo adaptation as
well as rational design of synthetic photoreceptors for use in
Optogenetics.

Network theory (Albert and Barabasi, 2002; Newman, 2010)
has been applied to many biological systems (Banerjee and Roy,
2015; Filkov et al., 2009; Roy and Filkov, 2009; Roy, 2012) includ-
ing macromolecules (Amitai et al., 2004; Brinda and Vishveshwara,
2005; Chennubhotla and Bahar, 2006; del Sol et al., 2006; Thibert
et al., 2005), and, even towards diagnostics (Banerjee et al., 2015)
and biomedical devices (Roy et al., 2015). However, it has never
been applied before to study transition of signaling states in photo-
sensors. These studies are usually based on structure of the entire
protein. Not all interactions maybe of equivalent energetic stability.
Remarkably, our results demonstrate that at least to a first approxi—
mation, overlooking specifics of energetics in interactions (which of
course are implicitly included through structural changes during the
transition), still leads to good agreement with known experimental
findings. For example, for the well researched thA and VVD LOV,
this agreement is 100 and 88%, respectively.

Both light and dark state crystal structures of any natural or syn—
thetic full—length photoreceptor (not merely the photosensor do—
main), is simultaneously unavailable till date. It is well—known that
upon photon absorption, FMN binding site located in LOV under—
goes a major conformational change leading to loss or gain of new
interactions in both light and dark states. Therefore, we restrict our—
selves to model only the LOV (sensor) domain, rather than the
whole protein as a network of amino acid residues. It is reasonable
to presume that the predicted amino acid residues found to be im—
portant for isolated LOV domains might not be too different from
full length structures as well. Preservation of coiled coil signaling jg,
helix has been evidenced in both the isolated LOV domain of thA
and in the only crystal structure of full length synthetic photorecep—
tor structure (Deinsthuber et al., 2013; Gleichmann et al., 2013;
Moglich and Moffat, 2007). Crystal structures of core LOV do—
mains show almost no structural difference in dark and light state
(Freddolino et al., 2013). However, within the same LOV subfamily
that share significant structural homology in core region, there is
wide variation in photo cycle kinetics and conformational orienta—
tion of the ﬂanking signalling helices. Hence, the sequences and
structures are considered individually. To account for these subtle
structural differences and to transcend this limitation, herein we
introduce the technique of differential networks. We demonstrate
that changes arising upon illumination of the LOV sensor domain
leading to light—dark transition can be effectively captured by this
approach. We show that the combined effect of interactions which
are lost or gained during light—dark transition plays an important
role in signalling. Detailed analyses of biologically significant inter-
actions among these, yield valuable information.

2 Methods

2.1 Differential network approach

To understand in—depth the light—dark transition, we introduce the
approach of differential network (DN) to speciﬁcally characterize
interactions unique to each state. Exposure to light causes formation
of new interactions and simultaneous loss of existing interactions
within LOV domain. The light (dark) differential network or LDN
(DDN) is the network constructed out of edges that are present in
the network of a given protein in light (dark) state but absent in
dark (light) state. A schematic diagram for construction of DN is
provided in Supplementary Figure S1. The differential networks im-
mediately lead us to a much smaller subset of edges which can be
scrutinized in far greater detail compared to meticulous studies on
the entire parent light or dark network. It is upon deletion of indi-
vidual edges of DDN or LDN, in parent light or dark network; that
we are readily able to identify the really important biological
interactions.

2.2 Network construction

We conduct detailed analyses on light—dark transition of all LOV
photosensors whose dark and light state crystal structures are simul—
taneously available in Protein Data Bank (PDB). Notably each of the
pairs belongs to same space group. They are thA from B. subtilis
(Losi et al., 2005; Moglich and Moffat, 2007) (PDB ids: 2pr6,
2pr5), Vivid (VVD) from the fungus N. crassa (Zoltowski et al.,
2007) (PDB id: 2pdr, 2pd7), LOV2 domain from A. satiz/a (Oat)
(Halavaty and Moffat, 2007) (PDB id: 2v1b, 2v1a), Aureochrome1
(Aureol) from the photosynthetic marine alga, Vfrigida (Takahashi
et al., 2007) (PDB ids: 3ulf, 3ue6), LOV1 domain of Phot1 from the
green alga C.reinhardtii (Fedorov et al., 2003) (PDB id: 1n9o, 1n9l)

sharply decreases from its initial value at I = 0. Here n,-,- is the total
number of side chain atom interactions between ith and jth residue
within 4.5  (Heringa and Argos, 1991). For Glycine, C0, atom is
considered (Brinda and Vishveshwara, 2005). N,- and N,- is the total
number of heavy atoms in ith and jth residue, respectively
(Chennubhotla and Bahar, 2006). For node and edge betweenness,
we assign edge weights equal to inverse of interaction strength be—
tween amino acid residues. It should be noted that monomer—dimer
equilibrium plays a very crucial role in light—dark transition which is
discussed extensively in SI. In cases, where the functional form of
LOV domain (monomer or dimer) is not known, the network should
be constructed for both. Further details about network construction,
I C and space groups are given in Supplementary Information (SI).

Asz (a
M represents metric under consideration, i.e. node betweenness,

Mgemaining’i denote value of M for ith node or edge of the parent
light (dark) network before and after removal, respectively. Thus,
AM).e is the change in value of M for ith residue or edge upon re—
moval of the qth edge of the parent light (dark) network.  is the
mean value of M in parent light or dark state averaged over all resi—

i’ denotes number of edges or nodes (other than incident nodes).
Thus, a = 0 for edge betweenness or edge proximity and a = 2 for node
betweenness or node closeness. Finally, statistical significance Zk of lath
edge of LDN (DDN), or, equivalently the qth edge in the parent light
(dark) network undergoing actual removal, is determined by its Z—
score,

where, (AMk) is the mean effect arising from the individual deletion of
every edge of the LDN (DDN) in parent light (dark) network (Eq. 7).
0AM,e is the associated standard deviation. The lath edge of LDN
or DDN is termed as statistically significant edge or key interaction
and the corresponding incident nodes are termed as key residues, if
Zk21. Supplementary Figure S4 in SI clarifies details of AMk and
statistical significance in a toy network.

3 Results

3.1 Network topology and role of interactions lost or
gained during transition

We analyse distribution profiles of different network metrics for the
LOV domain, before and after illumination. In Figure 1, the distri-
bution profile for eccentricity implies a common rearrangement
pattern among residues in LOV domain of Phy3—LOV and
Aureol—LOV, upon illumination; by and large consistent for all six
LOVs as seen in Supplementary Figure S5 of SI. These seem to bear
signatures of the effectual strategy employed in presence of light for
better signal transduction in LOV. Illumination seems to bring most
residues closer to each other and facilitates signaling in the light
state. Edge betweenness profiles also show a similar behavior for all
LOVs with small number of edges showing very high betweenness
values in dark state compared to light state. This long tail in dark
state signifies signal ﬂow is primarily channelized through a limited
number of edges whereas it is more democratic in the light state.
Quantitatively, the standard deviation of both distributions is al-
ways lesser in light state for all LOV domains studied here as seen in

Shift of eccentricity distribution towards left in light state shows decrease in

betweenness distribution profile in light state indicates higher participation of
most edges in signal flow and lesser ‘bottlenecks". Dark state contains signifi-
cant number of edges with far higher edge betweenness implying that infor-
mation transfer is primarily channelized via some edges only. Similar shifts
are also largely observed for LOVs of other organisms (Color version of this
figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

Supplementary Table S2. Thus, network analysis presents a consist—
ent picture at the level of LOV domain of all organisms, which is
achieved without even delving into individual similarities or differ-
ences at the molecular level between LOV domains.

It is now imperative to focus on interactions which are unique to
either light or dark state. Intuitively, one would feel that absence of
interactions in either the LDN or DDN is quite likely to accommo—
date a new pattern of information ﬂow in the protein. If an inter-
action is lost, it is reasonable to infer that its presence would have
hindered the signaling process. The nodes associated with such inter—
actions should play a crucial role in signal transmission. Such an im-
portant interaction found by us in Aureol LOV is (Ile274, Ile270).
Ile270 is significant for light-dependent signal transmission (Mitra
et al., 2012). Our edge removal strategy successfully captures inter—
actions among residues that are experimentally known to be import-
ant either in signal modulation or in functionally important regions.

3.2 Identification of key interactions and residues

All network metrics and statistical measures used here are defined in
Section 2. We use node based network centrality metrics like close—
ness and betweenness and edge based metrics like edge betweenness
and edge proximity. The latter has been recently proposed to cap—
ture slow—poisoning in networks and seems to be quite important for
biological networks as well (Banerjee and Roy, 2015). These global
network measures help in comprehending the effect of every single
edge deletion on the whole LOV domain. In a given network, a sin-
gle edge deletion could perhaps significantly affect the betweenness
and closeness of nodes incident on the deleted edge. However, an
average edge deletion usually does not have a major impact on the
remaining nodes or edges in the network. Removal of only some spe—
cific edges (Zk21, see Methods); from the parent light (dark) net—
work, leads to remarkable change in network metric values of even
distant nodes (as shown in Fig. 2); and/or edges. Thus, edges with
Zk21 seem to act as a good statistical discriminator and hence we
term such edges as key interactions and the incident residues as key
residues. A list of important residues for all six LOV domains, either
known experimentally or predicted by us is summarized in Table 1.

tion of edges (Asn286, Gln258) [significant effect] and (Asn218, Phe238) [triv-
ial effect] for Aureo1-LOV (light state). Effect on closeness (betweenness) for
(Asn286, Gln258) is represented by orange (magenta) and for (Asn218,
Phe238) by green (blue), respectively. Residues most affected due to any
edge deletion are mentioned in appropriate color (Color version of this figure
is available at Bioinformatics online.)

As elaborated later, key interactions and key residues found by our
method are amply complemented by experimental findings.

3.3 Insights from differential network analysis

We generally find that at least one incident residue of key inter—
actions identified by our method has already been verified experi—
mentally for functional importance. For the well researched thA
LOV and VVD LOV, this is 100 and 88%, respectively. For Oat
LOV and the lesser studied Aureochrome1 LOV, it is 66 and
70%, respectively. The shorter construct for Cr—LOV and near ab—
sence of experimental studies on both Cr—LOV and Phy3—LOV re—
sult in lower success rate for both of these domains. Inspite of
this, nearly two—thirds of the key interactions identified for all
LOVs studied here tally with previous experimental findings.
Additionally, structure—sequence alignment analysis substantiates
the role of key residues identified for all LOVs that await experi—
mental validation (Supplementary Fig. 812). The residues pre—
dicted to be important in light—dark transition are mostly
localized around FMN binding pocket, signaling helices (A:x and
]O,) and near interface regions as shown in Fig. 3.

3.3.1 thA LOV domain (thA LOV) from B. subtilis

thA is responsible for regulating general stress activity in B. subtilis
in response to blue light. The effector domain linked to core thA
LOV is an anti—0' factor antagonist (STAS) domain via some linker
region (residues 127—147) (Moglich and Moffat, 2007). The L, helix
of thA LOV is known to play a significant role in signal transduc—
tion. The LDN and DDN identify a set of 22 and 21 edges belonging
uniquely to light and dark state, respectively. Our network based ap—
proach identifies interactions mostly surrounding the FMN region
and few belonging to the dimer region of thA LOV. The deletion
of (Val90, Leu106) significantly affects the behavior of large number
of distant nodes as well as edges. Val90 contributes to the structural
stability of thA, since its mutation to yet another hydrophobic resi—
due Ile reduces the thermal stability (Song et al., 2013) while
Leu106 is involved in dimerization of thA LOV (M6glich and
Moffat, 2007). Phe46 is known to go through most profound light—
induced ﬂipping suggesting ﬂexibility of the domain in this

particular region (Moglich and Moffat, 2007). Our network analysis
effectively captures this behavior of Phe46 which seems to undergo
significant rearrangement by gaining (losing) an edge in the light
(dark) state. Further, identification of edges (Phe46, Met49) from
LDN and (Phe46, Ile5 7) from DDN, as key interactions emphasizes
the prime role played by Phe46 in light—dependent signal transduc—
tion. Another key interaction identified for case of LDN is (Glu53,
Glu5 6). Glu56Gln mutation slows down the photocycle twofold
(Losi et al., 2005).

On the other hand, in dark state, the edge (Ile92, Asn104) brings
out major changes in closeness of distant residues. This result is not—
able because Ile92 stabilizes its structure through hydrophobic inter-
actions. Upon light absorption, Ile92 and Leu65 undergo
displacement from the pseudo—dyad axis of the thA structure
(Moglich and Moffat, 2007). It is known that Asn104Asp mutation
increases the adduct formation rate (Raffelberg et al., 2011). Further
experimental observations show that the light induced signal travels
through the interactions between residues Ile126, Thr127 and
Gln129 of L, helix with those from H I; and I ﬂ strands. This behavior
is prominently featured in present study with (Gln129, Va123) being
a key interactions identified for DDN.

Extensive discussion in full—length YF1 structure (Gleichmann
et al., 2013) center on mutants that show either constitutive activity
in dark or light state (ON variants) or enhanced activity in presence
of blue light (INV mutants). Such candidate residues either directly
interact with FMN or can be found in A; (essential for LOV dimer-
ization) and L, helices (important for coiled—coil formation and sig—
nal transduction to effector domain). Networks analyses agree well
with the experimental findings from YF1/thA analysis. Large num-
ber of residues e.g. Asp21, Va123, Arg24, Gln44, Gln48 as well as
Met49 in the thA LOV dimer interface have been found to be im—
portant in light—dark transition, from networks perspective. Though
the functional importance of poorly conserved Glu5 3 and well—
conserved Ile57 in Ca—Da region cannot be ascertained in thA,
they most possibly confer structural stability to this region.
Mutation at their homologous positions in Oat LOV (Zayner et al.,
2013) greatly alters Ca—Da helicity and alteration of Ile to Ala de—
celerates photo—recovery. Therefore, loss or gain of interactions
among amino acid residues, as predicted from this work, involve
residues that have mostly been validated by structural or kinetic
studies. Results are summarized in Supplementary Table S3.

3.3.2 Vivid (VVD) from fungus Neurospora crassa

Vivid is the only LOV known to be devoid of auxiliary domains.
Unlike other LOV domains considered here, it consists of flavin ad—
enine di-nucleotide (FAD) chromophore for its light dependent ac—
tivity. Photo—adduct formation in VVD induces N-terminal
conformational changes (Crosson and Moffat, 2001). Network met—
rics pinpoint three key interactions: (Tyr40, Va186), (Tyr40,
Leu104) and (Leu64, Ile166). One of the major molecular events
that drives photoreceptor signaling is dimerization of the photosen-
sor domains. Tyr40 plays an important role in dimerization of VVD
under light as any mutation to Tyr40 (except with Trp) has resulted
in the loss of dimerization ability of VVD under light (Vaidya et al.,
2011). A lot has been discussed about the three residues in the B I;
strand (I/L—V/I—Y/F) that form evolutionarily conserved signature
ﬂ—bulge (Zayner et al., 2013) in PAS/LOV domains. It would be
interesting to see the role of Va186 of B I; in VVD LOV. Leu104 is al—
most fully conserved. Homologous Leu446 in Oat LOV accelerates
photocycle speed when mutated to glutamate. No functional studies
have yet been carried out against Ile166 and its only interaction

partner (both from network theory as well as structural analysis)
Leu64, unique to FAD binding LOV domains (VVD and WC—1).
Interestingly, Gln497 in Oat LOV (homologue of Ile166) forms part
of intense hydrogen bonding network and is responsible for main-
taining crucial interactions between core LOV domain and L1 helix
that unfolds with photo—induction. Since VVD has no jg, helix, we
might conclude that the strategic location of H [g residues (like
Ile166) could be essential for the transition as Ile166 maintains its
only interaction with N-terminal A; through Leu64.

In dark state, DDN leads to identification of 6 key interactions:
(Asn151, Gln112), (Tyr98, Leu111), (Ile54, Va1168), (Met135,
Va1147), (Met135, Va1149) and (Va1149, Asn161). Mutations in
Ile54 have proven to be deleterious in terms of protein expression
and stability. Not just the stability of A; per se, but dark—light tran-
sition frequently associates with monomer to dimer formation in
which surface residues play notable role. Ile54’s partner, partially
conserved Va1168 or any such neutral, nonpolar residue [similar to
the effects of homologous Ile219Met mutation (Nakasako et al.,
2008)] might be important to maintain dimer structure. Tyr98 is
conserved in toto across LOV domains and yet, neither the role of
Tyr98 not its homologous residues in other LOVs has been investi—
gated. Thus, it might be worth investigating its precise function
through experiments. Va1149 is mostly present as Leu in other species.
Leu480Ala in Oat LOV accelerates photocycle speed (Zayner et al.,
2013) and in Aureol LOV crystal structure (Mitra et al., 2012),
leu284 ﬂips in synchrony with Phe298 at light state. Met135 inﬂu—
ences the chromophore’s electronic environment (Zoltowski et al.,
2009) and exceptionally alters VVD’s light state lifetime when inter-
changed with neutral, nonpolar residues. Va1147 is partially conserved
and like its homologue Val90 in thA, it possibly contributes in struc—
tural stability though that awaits experimental validation. Complete
set of key interactions is provided in Supplementary Table S4.

3.3.3 LOV2 domain (Oat LOV) from A. sativa

We analyse the LOV2 domain of phototropin1 from A. satiz/a.
Phototropin1 has a tri—domain structural arrangement consisting of
two LOV domains namely LOV1 and LOV2 and a serine/threonine
kinase domain (Halavaty and Moffat, 2007). Oat LOV signals
through complete disruption of L1 helix from its core domain
(Harper et al., 2003) unlike other LOVs considered here.

One of the most prominent findings of Oat LOV dark—light tran-
sition that has been experimentally validated is the interaction
(Asn414, Gln513), captured distinctively by edge proximity metric.
Mutations on the electronegative N414 and Q513 residues, which
are in the vicinity of isoalloxazine ring of FMN, identified a poten—
tial water gate and water coordination sites. Oat LOV crystal struc—
tures at the dark and light states reveal rotations of Asn414 and
Gln513 (Halavaty and Moffat, 2007) to allow water molecules,
with potential to decay covalent bond through proton transfer to
Cys450, enter FMN binding site facilitating dark state restoration
(Zayner and Sosnick, 2014). Mutational analysis of Gln513 con—
firms its role in recovery reaction kinetics (Nash et al., 2008).

To quantitate the extent of conformational changes during
dark—light transition in Oat LOV, alteration in circular dichroism
helicity (as a measure of unfolding upon illumination) has been thor—
oughly compared to light—state lifetime (Zayner et al., 2013).
Though changes in helicity through Glu409Pro mutation does not
alter photocycle speed, it would be interesting to observe the effect
of mutation in its partner residue Ala405. Both Val476 and Leu496
when mutated to Phe, moderately increase helicity, but only the for—
mer could increase the speed of photocycle. Phe509Leu significantly

increases helicity but decreases photocycle time (Zayner et al.,
2013). Both interactions, (Ile466, Val478) and (Met499, Ile510),
cause major change in all four node and edge based metrics. Well
conserved Val478 possibly confers structural stability similar to its
homologous Val90 in thA. Ile466 which is also extremely well con—
served exception includes Met135 in VVD, which when mutated to
Ile reduced the thermal reversion time in VVD. The homologous
residue Ile270 in Aureol significantly altered the lifetime in light
state. Ile217, homologous to Met499, when mutated to Met behaves
very similar to WT Arabidopsis Phot2 (Nakasako et al., 2008).
Met499 identified through both LDN and DDN, is in a position to
hydrogen bond with Ala543 of L1 helix, thus stabilizing the dark
state. While it has been shown that any changes in homologous
Leu143 in thA impairs signal transduction, it remains to be seen as
to what would be the effect of Val529 (of L1 helix) alteration in Oat
LOV. Although, its interacting partner, Leu493 when mutated with
Ala markedly decreases helicity and photocycle time.

For dark state, key interactions correspond to (Gln507, Met499)
and (Pro426, Gly447) (Details are in Supplementary Table S5). We
have discussed the importance of water gate as well as water coord—
ination sites that have strong influence on the stability of Cys—FMN
covalent bond above. Gln507 is strategically located to H—bond
with two water molecules immediately at the entry point of water
molecules towards chromophore. Though there is no experimental
evidence against Gln507 variation in OAT (or T117 in thA), it
would be interesting to see the effect on photocycle. Residues in the
loop regions that essentially confer structural integrity to the photo—
receptor structure seem to be important. Examples include con—
served Pro426 and Gly447.

3.3.4 Aureol LOV domain (Aureol LOV) from V.frigida
Aureochromes from Vfrigida are different from other LOV struc—
tures due to their reverse effector—sensor topology, which earns
them a special place. Their N—terminal effector domain is linked to a
C-terminal LOV domain unlike most other known LOV structures.
For LDN, only 2 edges, namely, (Lys269, Va1282) and (Gln258,
Asn286) alter all node and edge based centralities of distant residue
or edges. Both residues Gln25 8 and Asn286 are known to partici—
pate in the stabilization of isoalloxazine ring. Va1282 located in
ﬂ—bulge region; H—bonds with Phe298, which is known to undergo
prominent conformational changes during light—dark transition.
Further, well—conserved Va1282 and neighboring Cys283 are in close
contact with residues from F0, helix, the ﬂanking helix of ﬂ-strands
surrounding the chromophore. The interactions of Leu284 with resi—
dues Thr262, Ala266 and Phe298 that are unique to light state, all
being identified as key interactions, are in support of the experimen-
tal evidence of its light—induced conformational change (Mitra et al.,
2012). While Thr262 (located just next to the FMN binding pocket)
is mostly conserved, Ala266 is poorly conserved. Since Thr462 in
Oat LOV (homologous to Ala266) when mutated to Val accelerates
photocycle (Zayner et al., 2013), the presence of Ala in this position
should enhance the speed of photocycle in Aureol, as well.
Remarkably, Phe298 when mutated increases the light state lifetime
9 fold (relative to wild type) thus obviously playing a significant role
in signal transduction (Mitra et al., 2012). Another two residues
that significantly alter the light—state lifetime are Ile231 and Ile270,
the latter being identified as a crucial node in DDN. Apart from
these edges, another edge inﬂuencing the betweenness of distant
nodes is (Tyr244, Leu257).

Though the role of fully conserved Tyr244 is not experimentally
validated even in other LOV species, its strategic location between

C, and D0, helices enables it to stabilize active site Cys254 through a
continued H—bonding chain network (Tyr244 —> HZO —> Leu25 7 —>
Cys25 4) including a water coordination.

In the dark state, key interactions consist of edges (Ile270,
Ile274), (Pr0204, Leu212), (Cys283, Gln332) and (Va1209,
Val314). Interestingly Pr0204 is also conserved in Vivid and White
Collar proteins, also known to transmit signals through N-terminal
effector domains. Va1209 and partially conserved Leu212 predicted
to be important for N—terminal signaling in Aureol. Results are
summarized in Supplementary Table S6.

3.3.5 LOV1 domain of Photl from C.reinhardtii (Cr-LOV)

For shorter Cr—LOV construct lacking both N—terminal and C—ter—
minal regions (Halavaty and Moffat, 2007) and very few related ex—
perimental studies, residues identified as crucial for dark—light
transition lack experimental validation. Therefore, we validate our
results mostly through structure—sequence alignment. Interestingly,
most of the homologous residues corresponding to key residues of
Cr—LOV are found to be important given the mutational analysis of
other well—studied photoreceptors like thA and Oat LOV. For light
state, we have four key interactions: (Thr21, Gly40), (Pro96,
Leu88), (Gly62, Thr65) and (Val52, Phe41) while for DDN, our ap-
proach identifies a unique key interaction (Thr21, Ser38). Results
are summarized in Supplementary Table S7.

H-bonding network around the chromophore has always been
found significant for the stabilization of light and dark states. Thr21
features in both LDN and DDN H—bonds with Gln120. In turn,
Gln120 directly H—bonds with FMN oxygen atom. The neighboring
residue of Thr21 and also its interaction partners Gly40 (in LDN)
and Ser38 (in DDN) stabilize C0, helix through H-bond. (Thr21,
Gly40) and (Thr21, Ser38) interactions seem to stabilize the scaffold
of LOV structural components in the light and dark states, respect—
ively. Both the homologous residues of conserved Phe41 (Phe46 in
thA and Phe434 in Oat LOV) undergo prominent light—induced
structural changes (Moglich and Moffat, 2007) and their variants
substantially alter the photocycle speed (Raffelberg et al., 2011;
Zayner et al., 2013). Partially conserved Val52 (Ile in other cases)
perhaps maintains photocycle stability. Mutation to a smaller
hydrophobic group (Ile445Ala) remarkably increases helicity in the
light state and decelerates photocycle speed in Oat LOV. Gly62 and
Thr65, conserved in all FMN—binding LOV, belong to H—bonding
network that stabilizes FMN binding domain (interactions through
Leu88—Asn89 and Asn61). Partially conserved Leu88 and Pro96 are
components of B bulge. Homologous residues in thA are displaced
towards the outside, possibly as an exercise of conformational re-
arrangement upon light activation.

3.3.6 LOV2 domain of phototropin from chimeric fern
photoreceptor (Phy3-LOV)

LDN of Phy3-LOV identifies four key interactions. As we observe
the dark and light state crystal structures of Phy3—LOV (Crosson
and Moffat, 2001, 2002), a clear movement of Gln1029 residue is
observed through dark—light transition. In light—state, concomitant
to the new bond formation between FMN N5 and Cys966, H—bond
between Gln1029 and Ser930 is broken to facilitate bonding be—
tween Gln1029 and Gln1027. Such changes are also evident in the
network analysis here, where both Gln1029 and Ser930 are found
to be important in LDN and DDN, respectively. The residue hom—
ologous to Gln1029 in Oat LOV is Gln513, whose role in dark—light
transition has already been discussed in detail. Another homologue,
Gln123 in thA interacts directly with FMN (Gleichmann et al.,

91% ‘09 1sn3nv uo sojoﬁuv soq ‘121u103111123 10 A11819A1uf1 112 /§.IO'S[BU.IHO[p.IOJXO'SOTlBIHJOJUTOTQ/ﬁdllq 111011 pop1201umoq

2013). Val932, partner of Gln1029, belongs to the hydrophobic
pocket surrounding the dimethyl benzene moiety of FMN (Crosson
and Moffat, 2001). Mutations of its homologs, Val416ALa in Oat
LOV and Ile74Val in VVD LOV, alter photocycle speed.

Interacting partner of Asn1008, Val996 is mostly Leu at the
equivalent position in other LOV domains. Homologs Leu480 in
Oat LOV greatly enhances photocycle speed and Leu284 in
Aureol undergoes concerted movement along with Phe298 after
photo—excitation. Another important finding is the (Phe950,
Ala946) interaction. Phe950’s homologue, Phe46 in thA under—
goes most significant light induced conformational changes
(Moglich and Moffat, 2007). Superimposition of Phy3 light versus
dark structure does show movement of Phe950 ring upon illumin-
ation. However, the changes are not so prominent as in thA
structure. It would be interesting to see if Phe950 can alter the pho—
tocycle speed akin to Phe46 in thA (Raffelberg et al., 2011) or
Phe434 in Oat LOV (Zayner et al., 2013). Though there is no ap—
parent evidence against the partially conserved partner of Phe950
(namely Ala946), providing support to neighboring Phe950
through hydrophobic interactions, it might be important for struc—
tural integrity. Another such example could be the interaction be—
tween Phe1025 (part of FMN binding pocket and ﬂ—bulge) and
Va11022 in the adjacent loop.

There are three key interactions in Phy3 DDN. While the role of
Ser930 is already established in LDN, the function of its partner
residue, Ser947 (which is almost fully conserved), is unknown.
Straddled between B ﬂ and C0,, Ser947 is a part of the intense
H-bonding network in this region, especially with the residues from
Ag. Throughout the network analyses conducted here, we find that
residues, even those which do not belong to chromophore binding
pocket, are featured to be important. And one of the major reasons
seems to be their participation in intense H-bonding network, which
is an integral part of structural stability. More such residues found
significant from Phy3 DDN are Gln1013, Va11014 and Ile1026,
located on the chromophore—lining ﬂ—scaffold and Asp991. It has
been shown that Gln497 (Gln1013 homologue in Oat LOV
(Halavaty and Moffat, 2007)); is among the few residues that forms
an extensive H—bonding network between core LOV domain and L1
helix, thus essential for photo—induced signaling. Details appear in
Supplementary Table S8.

4 Discussion

FMN/FAD based blue—light responsive LOV photoreceptors are pre—
sent across all kingdoms of life. This indicates their indispensability
and diverse function in many crucial biological signaling events.
Photon absorption leads to signal propagation accompanied by
structural alterations, downstream or upstream, which eventually
affects the behavioral pattern of the organism. Since our study is
completely dependent on crystal structure, it should be noted that
photo—induced dynamics amidst static nature might vary with data
collection at different temperature. Further, crystallography arte—
facts might also mildly affect network construction from different
chains, even from one single structure.

Nevertheless, by introducing the notion of differential network,
our study successfully identifies important interactions and residues
with functional significance, as attested by experiments as well as se—
quence—structure homology. Thus, it would be helpful in guiding fu-
ture experiments. Our network based approach is not only useful in
understanding photo—adaptability in natural photoreceptors but will
be extremely helpful in rational design of novel and complex photo—
receptors with interesting light—responsive functions.

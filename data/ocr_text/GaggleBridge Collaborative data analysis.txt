ABSTRACT

Motivation: Tools aiding in collaborative data analysis are becoming
ever more important as researchers work together over long
distances. We present an extension to the Gaggle framework, which
has been widely adopted as a tool to enable data exchange between
different analysis programs on one computer.

Results: Our program, GaggIeBridge, transparently extends this
functionality to allow data exchange between Gaggle users
at different geographic locations using network communication.
GaggIeBridge can automatically set up SSH tunnels to traverse
firewalls while adding some security features to the Gaggle
communication.

Availability: GaggIeBridge is available as open-source software
implemented in the Java language at http://it.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/gb.

Supplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Gaggle (Shannon et al., 2006) has become the standard
framework for connecting different applications together to
study systems biology questions more efﬁciently. Many different
applications support Gaggle, i.e. they are implementing the Gaggle
Goose interface. Data such as gene identiﬁers, clusters, regulatory
networks or data matrices can be exchanged between all such Geese
that are connected to a common Gaggle Boss instance. This can
greatly speed up scientiﬁc work by removing the need for data
format conversion and exporting/importing data between different
programs. This communication is usually limited to programs
running on the local computer.

However, the Gaggle approach could also be used to allow
different researchers to work together on one dataset. For example,
data could be sent from one user’s genome browser to another user’s
microarray analysis software, enabling the collaborative dissection
of complex datasets. The RMI methodology underlying Gaggle’s
implementation is network transparent and allows a connection
between programs over long distances. However, only very few
Geese support connections to remote Boss instances. Furthermore,
connecting to remote instances is not always straightforward as these
might be behind ﬁrewalls or security gateways. Exposing them to
the world—wide network is undesirable as Gaggle does not include
any security or authentication scheme.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.
TThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two authors
should be regarded as joint First authors.

Here we present GaggIeBridge, an addition to the Gaggle that
extends the existing concept to allow collaborative research over
the network.

2 METHODS

We propose to increase the scope of Gaggle towards collaborative research,
even over long distances, by connecting different Boss instances over the
network. We include the highly secure SSH protocol to deal with the
problems of authentication and encryption as well as to circumvent problems
due to restrictive ﬁrewalls.

For this purpose, we implemented GaggIeBridge, a program that allows
the user to connect multiple Gaggle Boss instances, thus creating a sort of
‘Super-Boss’ instance (Fig. 1A). The elegance of this approach is that it
requires neither modiﬁcation of the existing Gaggle Boss implementation
nor of any Geese. Instead, GaggIeBridge represents itself as just another
Goose to each of the connected Bosses, transfering data between them.

Connected Boss instances can be activated or inactivated, similar to the
possibility of activating and deactivating connected Geese in the Boss main
window. However, while inactivated Geese can still send data to their Boss,
deactivation in GaggIeBridge completely disconnects the respective Boss
such that it can neither send to nor receive from other Boss instances
connected to the GaggIeBridge.

Since many academic users are behind restrictive ﬁrewalls, and also do
not want unauthorized users to connect to their Gaggle Boss, we decided to
include SSH tunneling in GaggIeBridge. Thus, a group of researchers can
collaborate as long as at least one of their computers is reachable from the
outside via SSH login (as in Fig. 2C). Many research facilities permit SSH
trafﬁc to pass their ﬁrewalls, effectively enabling users to connect otherwise
secluded Gaggle Boss instances together. Our implementation is ﬂexible
enough to support many different network conﬁgurations (see Fig. 2 for
some examples), allowing users in extremely restrictive networks, or behind
NAT (network address translation) routers to partake in the collaborative data
analysis. Since all participating Gaggle Boss instances are equal peers (being
both servers and clients at the same time), a dedicated machine allowing
users to login via SSH can be used to set up a Gaggle network in a star
topology. Thus, only one computer needs to be set up to allow SSH logins
and administration can be centralized.

The SSH protocol encrypts all data before transmission, using a very
secure encryption method. Data communicated between the Gaggle users
thus is protected from eavesdropping. Furthermore, since each user needs
SSH login credentials (username and password) to connect, this adds an
admittedly simple form of user management to the Gaggle. We have
added SSH tunneling capabilities to GaggIeBridge based on the J Sch
implementation (http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/, licensed under a BSD—style
open—source license) of the SSH2 protocol.

Furthermore, we developed an extended version of the Gaggle Boss that
informs the user about Geese that try to connect and allows the user to refuse
unwanted Geese before they can establish a connection. If a Goose is denied,
it will neither receive any objects transmitted nor will it be able to send data
to other Geese on this Boss. Both the extended Boss and GaggIeBridge can
be used in one single application. Alternatively, GaggIeBridge can be used
as a stand—alone program.

3 DISCUSSION

The availability of automated network communication, which is
provided by GaggIeBridge, results in a wide range of possible
applications. While the main focus of Gaggle is data exchange
between different bioinformatic tools, the connection of several
instances of the same tool running on different computers now
enables collaborating scientists at different locations to work
simultaneously on the same data.

Using Gaggle in a networked environment has two inherent
security problems: ﬁrst, in an open network conﬁguration, anyone
can connect to a running Gaggle Boss, whether the original user
wants this or not. Secondly, when using GaggIeBridge, any of
the connected users could allow a third party to take part in
the information transmitted, either locally or by connecting them
with a further GaggIeBridge connection. While our enhanced Boss
somewhat remedies the ﬁrst problem, we believe that this security
issue should be addressed in a possible later release of the Gaggle
itself. The second problem is the general problem of trust between
collaborating researchers. Currently, we cannot propose a technical
solution for this issue.

To illustrate the beneﬁt of our approach, we present the example
of two users (Lucia and Alex) working in two different labs on the

 

 

Fig. 2. GaggIeBridge network conﬁguration examples. (A) four computers
running local Gaggle Boss instances (solid boxes) are connected by one
computer running both a Boss as well as GaggIeBridge (circle); (B) one
researcher uses GaggIeBridge to connect his local Boss to a network of
Gaggle users behind a restrictive ﬁrewall (rounded box) using an SSH
tunnel to a computer with SSH enabled (hashed box); (C) two groups of
users in different networks with restrictive ﬁrewalls are connected using
one GaggIeBridge for each network and one SSH tunnel between the
networks.

same project. Both use the Gaggle Genome Browser (Bare et al.,
2010) to visualize locus data, in addition they have a conversation via
a telephone conference. Their Gaggle Boss instances are connected
via GaggIeBridge. Now Lucia can select speciﬁc loci in the browser
and broadcast the selection with Gaggle (Fig. 1B). Alex’ genome
browser receives this information, the same elements are instantly
selected and the loci are added to the list of bookmarks (Fig. 1C).
This increases the efﬁciency of the communication between the users
substantially as a verbal description of the locus by Lucia and a
tedious manual search for the elements by Alex is no longer required.
Such communication can also take place within a much larger group
of users, and each user can run additional Geese, which will all
receive the broadcasts processing and visualizing the data according
to their speciﬁc functionality.

Note that, as GaggIeBridge transparently enhances Gaggle, no
modiﬁcation of these Geese or the connected Boss instances
are required. Thus, the features of GaggIeBridge can be used
with minimal installation effort, allowing to swiftly introduce
a collaborative approach to data analysis into any research
environment.

ABSTRACT

Summary: GREVE has been developed to assist with the identification
of recurrent genomic aberrations across cancer samples. The exact
characterization of such aberrations remains a challenge despite the
availability of increasing amount of data, from SNParray to next-
generation sequencing. Furthermore, genomic aberrations in cancer
are especially difficult to handle because they are, by nature, unique to
the patients. However, their recurrence in specific regions of the
genome has been shown to reflect their relevance in the development
of tumors. GREVE makes use of previously characterized events to
identify such regions and focus any further analysis.

Availability: GREVE is available through a web interface and
open-source application (http://www.we||.ox.ac.uk/GREVE).

1 INTRODUCTION

Genomic aberrations have been the subject of much interest in
the past decade with variable degrees of success. Two categories
have to be distinguished: exactly matching germline and unique,
often somatic, aberrations. There has been much effort to iden-
tify and catalogue the former in order to treat them like regular
markers such as SNPs (Iafrate et al., 2004). The ﬁrst difﬁculty lies
in the exact characterization of the breakpoints. Furthermore,
such inventory is impossible for somatic events that are by def-
inition unique. Still, the recurrence of overlapping regions can
indicate a key controlling area, e.g. a small deletion on 9p in
adolescent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Paulsson et al., 2008).

Current approaches are essentially based on either the integra-
tion into a general-purpose browser to provide context, but no
measure of overlap, or the creation of a heatmap where the copy
number itself is used as a metric across all types of events to
characterize the recurrence (Cancer Genome WorkBench,
https://cgwb.nci.nih.gov/cgi-bin/heatmap; Mermel et al., 2011).
This single continuous value is then used to construct a score
at every location. GREVE is designed to look into further details
by allowing the user to deﬁne further subgroups such as copy
neutral LOH that would be ignored otherwise. Furthermore,
GREVE provides a highly conﬁgurable interface and speciﬁc
statistics on recurrent events.

GREVE has been successfully used in numerous cancer studies
where the cohort size varied from a handful (Langemeijer et al.,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

2009; Olsson et al., 2011; Paulsson et al., 2010) to hundreds
(Gupta et al., 2008; O’Shea et al., 2009). Highly ﬂexible,
GREVE provides the ability to statistically explore a given data-
set and to present results in a ready-to-publish format.

2 FEATURES

The purpose of GREVE is to enable a ﬂexible view of aberra-
tions across the genome, or per chromosome, and score their
recurrence. Therefore, the default usage is very simple with the
input of the sole list of events being sufﬁcient, while it is highly
conﬁgurable with further optional input to help the inspection.

2.1 Key features
GREVE transforms a list of events into a genomic representa-
tion, summarizes and scores their recurrence across samples:
0 Read ﬂat or Excel input ﬁles containing a list of event per in-
dividual and type, with build 35, 36 or 37 location (Fig. lb).

0 Plot all events genome-wide and per chromosome with cyto-
bands. The views can either sort all the events or overlay
them with a ﬁxed set of individuals (Fig. lo).

0 Calculate, tabulate and plot recurrence within any given
type of events (e.g. Gain, Loss and LOH), score each over-
lapping segment across multiple statistics (Fig. lo).

0 Generate publication-ready ﬁgures in several graphical for-
mats (EPS, PDF, PNG, JPG or TIFF; Fig. lo).

0 Inclusion of key genes on the per-chromosome plot as given
in a separate list or known CNV from the Database of
Genomic Variants (Iafrate et al., 2004).

2.2 Formatting features
Because each study will have varying numbers of individuals and
events, the default layout may not be optimal. All positions and
colors are available in an optional conﬁguration ﬁle.

0 Size and color choice for each aberration type.

0 Distance between successive events and chromosomes.

0 Highlight aberration of certain type (default ‘LOH’).

o Merger of exactly matching events into a larger block.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The GREVE web front end is implemented in HTML/PHP as a
wrapper around the Python (van Rossum and Drake, 2001)

Fig. 1. Usage of GREVE where (a) pre—processing from any source gen-
erates a list of events to be used as (b) input together with the optional
DGV, Conﬁguration and Gene ﬁle. This can generate several output (c):
two types of genome-wide views (sorted by aberration type or individual),
chromosome view with overlap, gene and labels, as well as the detailed list
of overlapping events with corresponding counts and statistics

script engine running on the web server. It requires ImageMagick
software (Still, 2005) for ﬁgure format conversion from the de-
fault Encapsulated PostScript format. The Poisson binomial test
is implemented as a wrapper around the Poibin R-package
(Hong et al., 2011). The web interface allows the upload of all
necessary ﬁles and a convenient way to select ﬁlters and options.
It then outputs ready-to-publish ﬁgures as well as overlapping
details. Examples and frequently asked questions are available
on the website.

All the options in the engine software are available through the
graphical interface. However, to allow batch processing and fur-
ther analysis, the source code is available on the website. This
should allow speciﬁc extensions to match any given project such
as subgrouping of individuals (Purdie et al., 2009, 2010). The
large demo analysis with 709 events across 30 samples takes 7s
on an AMD64 3.0 GHz processor with 64Gb of RAM to pro-
cess with overlaps and scores.

3.1 Input ﬁles

Only the list of events with corresponding sample labels and type
is necessary to run GREVE. It can be generated from the output
of various aberration callers from SNP or CGH array as well as
sequencing data with eventual post-processing (Fig. la and b).
Further optional ﬂags, ﬁlters and ﬁles can be provided to add
information or tailor the presentation:

0 The list of events with location, sample labels and type of
aberration.

0 An optional gene list with name and position.

0 An optional conﬁguration ﬁle allows further tailoring of the
ﬁgures without the need to modify the program.

3.2 Output

The result of the analysis is composed of ﬁgures and tables
(Fig. lo):

0 Genome-wide and chromosome view of the events in all
formats.

0 Details of the overlap of events across each chromosome are
available directly in the interface as a table or in a separate
ﬁle.

0 The counts and proportion of overlap reﬂect the comparison
to a control set where no somatic event would be expected.

0 The Poisson binomial P—value tests the probability of a type
occurring at the same location depending on the individual
proportion on a chromosome (C_P) or genome-wide
(GW_P).

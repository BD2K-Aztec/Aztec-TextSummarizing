ABSTRACT

Summary: Temporal gene interactions, in response to environmental
stress, form a complex system that can be efficiently described using
gene regulatory networks. They allow highlighting the more influential
genes and spotting some targets for biological intervention experi-
ments. Despite that many reverse engineering tools have been
designed, the Cascade package is an integrated solution adding
several new and original key features such as the ability to predict
changes in gene expressions after a biological perturbation in the
network and graphical outputs that allow monitoring the spread of a
signal through the network.

Availability and implementation: The R package Cascade is

1 INTRODUCTION

Since the emergence of high-throughput technologies that allow
measuring simultaneously expression of thousands of genes,
many tools have been developed to learn gene expression profiles
and reverse engineer their underlying gene regulatory network
(GRN) (Bar-Joseph et al., 2012; Hecker et al., 2009). These
tools are either based on static coexpression methods or, if the
biological phenomenon shows any temporality, time-dependent
methods. Although the former relies on the assumption that coex-
pressed genes share some biological characteristics, the latter
infers a directed network with temporal dependencies. In this
last case, another important distinction should be made between
exogenous stress (e. g. growth response) and endogenous phenom-
enon (e.g. cell cycle) (Yosef et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2007). This
leads to different network topologies: in exogenous stress, net-
works’ topologies seem to have larger hubs and shorter paths
through temporal-dependent transcriptional waves (Luscombe
et al., 2004). This results in a quick response to environmental
modifications (Luscombe et al., 2004). The Cascade package

is designed to model such ‘cascade networks’ taking advantage
of the assignment of genes to temporal clusters, which adds
temporal causality in the network.

2 DETAILS ON THE PACKAGE FEATURES

This package has been designed to analyze temporal microarray
datasets, allowing gene selection, temporal cluster assignment,
reverse engineering the GRN using a penalized regression
model and predicting the effect of biological intervention experi-
ments. It also features a temporal synthetic cascade simulation
tool. The biological interpretations are facilitated thanks to
several graphical outputs. More insight about the statistical
tools as well as benchmarks is provided in Vallat et al. (2013).

2.1 Gene selection and cluster assignment

Selecting the genes for reverse engineering is a crucial step.
Besides selecting genes with high-differential expressions, the
Cascade package allows enriching the selection with genes
featuring speciﬁc temporal patterns. As pointed out by Hao
and Baltimore (2009), several temporal gene expression waves,
corresponding to speciﬁc cellular functions, can be individualized
after stimulation of the cellular environment. In this pulsed bio-
logical response, some relevant genes may have low but system-
atic differential expressions. This selection step mostly relies on
the Bioconductor R package limma (Smyth et al., 2005).

Each gene must be then assigned to one of the time clusters.
This can be automatically performed (according to the first time
when the gene is differentially expressed). Alternatively, the time
clusters can be user-provided.

2.2 Reverse engineering of the network

The reverse engineering algorithm is the Lasso-penalized estima-
tion of a linear regression model described in Vallat et al. (2013).
The Lasso penalty ensures sparsity, which is a well-known fea-
ture of most biological networks (Barabasi, 2003). Furthermore,
the temporal gene clusters are taken into account using a set of
matrices F to describe how genes interact:

N
Y = Fm(X,-)m(Y)w,-Xi + 77 (1)

i=1
where Y is the regulated gene and the X ,- are potential regulator
genes, the a), determine the strength of the link between X ,- and Y,
m(-) is the function that maps a gene to its temporal cluster and 27 is

a noise. Some further constraints are set to ensure a temporal
causality, and we use the Lasso estimator to achieve some sparsity.

It is common knowledge that biological networks are scale-
free (Barabasi, 2003): the distribution of the outgoing edges in
the networks follows a power law distribution. As a consequence,

using a statistical test from Clauset et al. (2009), we derived a
cutoff value for the coefﬁcients a). It was established, by a simu-
lation study, that such a procedure greatly improves F-scores
(Van Rijsbergen, 1979). A graphical output, Supplementary
Material S1, shows the modiﬁcation of the network topology
when this cutoff varies. For a given cutoff, a graphical output,
Supplementary Material S2, shows how the stimulated transcrip-
tional response spreads through the network. If time clusters are
heterogeneous, matrices F and a) values are iteratively estimated
in a coordinate ascendant approach. On the contrary, if all the
time clusters are homogeneous enough, the estimation of the
matrices F may be achieved using all the genes in each of the clus-
ters, instead of using only those pointed out by their a) values.
This results in a non-iterative algorithm: matrices F and a) values
are only estimated once.

2.3 Prediction

We can predict changes in gene expressions, using Equation (1),
after a gene intervention experiment at the ﬁrst time point, as
validated, in silica and biologically in Vallat et al. (2013).

2.4 Simulation

The Cascade package provides two simulation tools. On the ﬁrst
hand, a random network can be simulated following the prefer-
ential attachment theory (Barabasi, 2003) with some constraints
to ensure that the result is a temporal cascade network. On the
other hand, the model, Equation (1), can be used to simulate
gene expressions from any given network.

3 EXAMPLES

Two package’s vignettes detail the comprehensive analysis of two
example datasets. A ﬁrst dataset, extracted from GSE39411, is
based on the transcriptional response of healthy lymphocytes
B-cells after antigenic stimulation (Vallat et al., 2007). The
second dataset (E-MTAB-l475) has a different experimental
design and is based on the transcriptional response of murine
lymphocytes T-cells after an in vitro stimulation that sustains
cellular differentiation (van den Ham et al., 2013). In both
cases, gene expressions measured at different time points after
cell stimulation are used to select genes with speciﬁc temporal
patterns or high differential expressions, which are then assigned
to time clusters (Fig. l for GSE39411, and Supplementary
Material S3 and S4 for E-MTAB-l475). The reverse engineering
of the GRN highlights the most influential genes in the temporal
cascade (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Material S3—S5). The impact
in the GRN of a knockdown experiment of one inﬂuential gene
is predicted (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Material S3—S6).

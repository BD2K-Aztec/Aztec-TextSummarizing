ABSTRACT

Motivation: It is well known influenza viruses recognize and bind
terminal sialic acid (SA) on glycans that are found on the cell surface.
In this work, we used a data mining technique to analyze the glycan
array data of influenza viruses to find novel glycan structures other
than SA that may be involved in viral infection.

Results: In addition to SA structures noted previously, we noted the
sulfated structures in the mining results. For verification, we overex-
pressed the sulfotransferase that is involved in synthesizing these
structures, and we performed a viral infection experiment to assess
changes in infection in these cells. In our results, we found that there is
a 70-fold increase in these cells compared with the control. Thus, we
have found a novel pattern in glycan structures that may be involved in
viral infection.

1 INTRODUCTION

Inﬂuenza Viruses cause highly contagious respiratory disease in
humans with potentially fatal outcomes, and millions of people
are affected by inﬂuenza every year. In addition, many animal
species, including birds, swine, horses, dogs, cats, whales and
seals, can be infected by inﬂuenza Viruses. Viruses of all known
hemagglutinin (Hl—Hl6) and neuraminidase (Nl—N9) subtypes
are maintained in aquatic birds, and therefore, they are con-
sidered the natural reservoir of inﬂuenza Viruses. In humans,
the known pandemics in 1918, 1977 and 2009; in 1957; and in
1968 were caused by the H1, H2 and H3 Viruses, respectively
WVright et al., 2006). The known epidemics from 1977 until
now were associated with Viruses of the H1 and H3 subtypes.
Although not yet pandemic, the ﬁrst human infections with

chicken H5Nl Viruses were reported in 1997 in Hong Kong
(Claas et al., 1998; Subbarao et al., 1998).

Inﬂuenza Viruses bind to sialic acids (SAs) on the cell sur-
face to initiate infection and replication. Human inﬂuenza
Viruses preferentially bind to N—acetylneuraminic acid (i.e.
SA) attached to the penultimate galactose sugar by an 052,6
linkage (SA at 2-6 Gal), whereas avian Viruses preferentially
bind to SA with an 052,3 linkage (SA at 2-3 Gal) (Connor
et al., 1994). The receptor speciﬁcity is shared by the majority
of human and avian Viruses, but it has been reported that the
receptor-recognition of some avian Viruses was affected by the
third saccharide and more distant moieties of the (SA at 2-3
Gal)-terminal receptor (Gambaryan et al., 2003). In addition,
sulfation of the saccharide core has been shown to produce no
effect on binding of duck Viruses, but chicken and human
Viruses isolated in 1997 in Hong Kong showed increased
afﬁnity to a sulfated sialyl-Lewis structure (Gambaryan
et al., 2004, 2006). Thus, it has been shown that negatively
charged groups, such as SA and sulfate groups, on glycans
might function in binding to Viruses.

In this work, we used a data mining method called a-closed
frequent subtree mining (Hashimoto et al., 2008) to analyze
glycan binding data as produced by glycan array experiments
WVang et al., 2013), which are available on the web by the
Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG). After data
mining of those glycan structures with high binding affinity, we
noted that sulfated structures were found in the results in add-
ition to other terminal SA and sialyl-Lewis structures, as illu-
strated previously in other works (Connor et al., 1994;
Gambaryan et al., 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008).

In this work, however, we focused only on sulfation, and to
verify the effects of sulfation as shown from these results, we
overexpressed the sulfotransferase that is involved in synthesizing
these structures. Then we performed a Viral infection experiment
to assess the change in the level of Viral infection using the over-
expressed cells. In our results, we found a surprisingly large in-
crease in Viral infection using our overexpressed cells. We were
particularly surprised because we only overexpressed the sulfa-
tion and did not modify any sialyltransferases. From these re-
sults, we can claim that we have found a novel pattern in glycan
structures that is involved in Viral infection using our glycan
mining tool.

Frequent glycan structure mining of influenza virus increased viral infection

 

2 BACKGROUND

2.1 Glycan arrays

The study of glycan binding patterns has been much aided by the
development of glycan arrays (Galustian et al., 2004) and the
availability of such data on the web (Blixt et al., 2004; Raman
et al., 2005). For example, the CF G provides mammalian glycan
arrays to analyze the glycan binding speciﬁcity of lectins, anti-
bodies, antisera, microorganisms and viruses, to name a few.
Samples are ﬂuorescently labeled to detect primary binding to
the glycans on the array. To generate the array, a library of
natural and synthetic mammalian glycans with amino linkers is
printed onto N—hydroxysuccinimide—activated glass microscope
slides (SCHOTT Nexterion), forming covalent amide linkages.
The current CF G glycan arrays contain >600 glycan structures,
as listed at http://www.functionalglycomics.org/static/consor
tium/resources/resourcecoreh8.shtml. Among these structures,
~10% are sulfated structures. Previous studies using glycan
arrays have conﬁrmed that SA is an important component in
inﬂuenza virus binding (Stevens et al., 2006). It has also been
shown using a solid-phase binding assay that 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis
X is recognized by H5, H6, H7 and H9 inﬂuenza viruses
(Gambaryan et al., 2008). Therefore, the data from these tech-
nologies have been shown to be effective in analyzing glycan
binding afﬁnity.

2.2 Enzymes involved in glycan structure synthesis

The glycan structures expressed on the cell surface are synthe-
sized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus by
a series of glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases.
Overexpression or RNA interference of a glycosyltransferase or
a sulfotransferase is generally used to remodel glycan structures
on the cell surface (Hirano et al., 2012; Sasaki et al., 2011). For
example, overexpression of a sulfotransferase can increase a spe-
ciﬁc sulfation on a saccharide core (Hirano et al., 2012).
Therefore, in this work, to perform our viral infection experi-
ment, in preparing the cell culture, it was important to identify
those structures in the extracted data for which glycosyltrans-
ferases and/or sulfotransferases were known.

2.3 Data mining for glycan analysis

The Resource for INformatics of Glycomes at Soka (RINGS) is
a web resource providing a variety of data mining and algorith-
mic tools for glycomics data analysis (Akune et al., 2010). The
data mining method we used in this work is implemented by the
Glycan Miner Tool (Aoki-Kinoshita, 2013) in RINGS. This tool
uses the a-closed frequent subtree algorithm (Hashimoto et al.,
2008) for glycan structures. Details of this algorithm are
provided in Methods.

For the data, we used the glycan array data of inﬂuenza
viruses from the CFG (Blixt et al., 2004). In particular, we
selected the data for H1 and H3 inﬂuenza viruses that were
associated with the epidemics from 1977 until now. In addition,
we selected the data for H5 inﬂuenza viruses because the ﬁrst
human infections with chicken H5 viruses were reported in 1997
in Hong Kong. These viruses were readily available, such that
viral infection experiments could be performed using them.

2.4 Glycan structure notation

The graphical notation of glycan structures in this work is based on
the symbols proposed by the CF G. In particular, each monosac-
charide making up glycans is depicted by each given symbol. Thus,
a glycan structure is represented as a tree structure, where nodes are
monosaccharides (or sugars) and edges are glycosidic linkages
(including an at or ,6 anomer and two numbers indicating the linkage
positions on each sugar). Table 1 lists the symbols and abbreviated
names for the monosaccharides that appear in this manuscript.

Glycan structures may be represented using a variety of text
formats. In this work, we used KEGG Chemical Function
(KCF) format for the input data to the Glycan Miner Tool,
which we obtained by converting from International Union of
Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) format, which is the
format used by the CF G. Details of these and other formats
can be found in Aoki-Kinoshita, 2010. In brief, KCF format
uses a graph notation for glycans by specifying monosaccharides
as nodes and glycosidic linkages as edges. It also requires the
speciﬁcation of x- and y-coordinates for each node so that struc-
tures can be drawn clearly on a 2D plane. On the other hand,
IUPAC format is a linear notation where branches are indicated
by parentheses. RINGS provides utilities to convert glycan struc-
tures between a number of different formats, and the IUPAC to
KCF converter was used in this work.

3 METHODS
3.1 Glycan array data

The glycan array data from the CFG were used as the data source for
glycan binding afﬁnity information of various inﬂuenza strains. We ﬁrst
selected all virus-binding array data, which resulted in 191 datasets.
Among these, those virus strains for which virus experiments were feasible
were selected, resulting in 15 wild-type strains as listed in Table 2. We then
selected those glycans that demonstrated high binding afﬁnity in each
dataset (provided in Supplementary Information). The smallest number
of selected glycans was 8 (human HlNl; A/South Carolina/ 1/ 1918) and
the largest was 40 [Equine H3N8; A/equine/MA/2003 (H3N8)]. The
human H1N1 virus strains bound to 15 glycans on average. Table 2
also lists the number of glycans selected from each dataset. In general,
the top binding glycans were selected, except for those whose structures
were not given, such as ‘Fibrinogen’ and ‘Transferrin.’ The glycan struc-
ture data provided by the CFG are provided in IUPAC format, so it was
necessary to convert them to KCF format such that they could be input
into the Glycan Miner Tool. Once this was done using the IUPAC to
KCF utility in RINGS, and the structures were conﬁrmed to be accurately
converted, the data were then ready to be analyzed.

3.2 Glycan Miner Tool

The Glycan Miner Tool implements the a-closed frequent subtree algo-
rithm (Hashirnoto et al., 2008) for glycan structures. In brief, a-closed
frequent subtrees are deﬁned as those substructures within the input
dataset that frequently appear (more than a speciﬁed minimum threshold,
called the minimum support, or minsup). Those subtrees that appear in at
least minsup number of input glycan structures are considered to be fre-
quent subtrees. Moreover, to avoid the retrieval of overly similar subtrees,
the parameter or was deﬁned to specify the amount of overlap allowed
among the retrieved subtrees. Thus, the following condition must be met
for a subtree T to be included in the results:

support (P) < max (a * support (T), minsup,

where P is a supertree of T and support(X) refers to the number of times
subtree X appears in the input dataset.

The Glycan Miner Tool returns the a-closed frequent subtrees in order
of P—value, which is computed based on the input data. This P—value is
obtained by computing the support of randomly generated structures
with similar topology to the target subtree. Then the probability of ob-
taining the target subtree among the randomly generated subtrees is
computed.

3.3 Cell line and culture

Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were acquired from the
Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank (JCRB9029).
MDCK cells were cultured in Eagle’s minimal essential medium contain-
ing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic at 37°C under 5% C02
atmospheric conditions.

3.4 Establishment of stable transformant
expressing hGlcNAc6ST -1
The vector construction for the expression of human GlcNAc-6—sulf0trans-

ferase-I(hGlcNAc6ST—I) (Uchimura and Rosen, 2006) was prepared ac-
cording to Invitro gen GATEWAY systems by two-step polymerase chain

reaction (PCR). The full-length open reading frame of hGlcNAc6ST—I
was ampliﬁed from EST clone 4562846 (supplied by Open Biosystems),
by using the forward primer, 5’ -AAAAAGCAGGCTTGGCCGCCA
CCATGAAGGTGTTCCGTAGGAAGG—3’ and reverse primer,
5’-AGAAAGCTGGGTTTAGAGACGGGGCTTCCG-3’. For addition
of the adaptor sequence necessary to GATEWAY system, the open read-
ing frame fragment was ampliﬁed again by using the forward primer,
5’ -GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCT-3’ and reverse
primer, 5’-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT-3’. The
ampliﬁed fragment was recombined with the pCXN2 expression vector
modiﬁed for GATEWAY system to yield pCXN2-hGlcNAc6ST—I.
MDCK cells were seeded at 4 x 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate 24h
before transfection. The 3 ,ug of pCXN2-hGlcNAc6ST—I or pCXN2 (for
mock transfectant) was mixed with 9 ,ul of Lipofectamine2000 (Life
Technologies, CA, USA) in 200 ,ul of Opti-MEM medium (Life
Technologies) and transfected to MDCK cells. From lday after trans-
fection, cells were cultured in growth medium containing 0.4 ,ug/ml G418
for selection of the transformants. The transformant cells were passed
every 3—4 days for 20 days, and the increase of hGlcNAc6ST—I gene ex-
pression was checked. Flow cytometry analysis was performed by using
MECA-79 monoclonal antibody (so-19602, Santa Cruz, TX, USA),
which is known to recognize 6-sulfo GlcNAc structures (Y eh et al., 2001).

3.5 Viral infection to cells and measurement of the
amount of viral gene in culture supernatant

A human inﬂuenza virus, A/Hokkaido/11/2002 (HlNl), was inoculated
into cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 in Eagle’s Minimal Essential
Medium containing antibiotic (minimal medium). After incubation at
37°C for 1h, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline,
and cultured in minimal medium with presence of 1 ,ug/ml of acetyltryp—
sin (SIGMA, MO, USA). At 48 and 72h post-infection, culture super-
natants were harvested. Viral RNA was extracted from 140 ,ul of the
supernatant using QLAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo,
The Netherlands) according to the manufacture’s protocol. These RNA
were eluted in a ﬁnal volume of 70 ,ul of RNase—free water contains
0.04% sodium azide, and a portion was subjected to real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using LightCycler 480
Instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Primers used to quantitate the
amount of matrix (M) gene of virus were forward: 5’ -CCMAGGTCG
AAACGTAYGTTCTCTCTCTATC—3’, reverse: 5’ -TGACAGRATYG
GTCTTGTCTTTAGCCAYTCCA-3’, probe: 5’-ATYTCGGCTTTGA
GGGGGCCTG-3’ . The probe was labeled at the 5’ -end with the reporter
dye, 3FAM, and at the 3’ -end with the quencher dye, MGB. Reactions
were performed using QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN) as
follows: reverse transcription, 30 min at 50°C; ampliﬁcation, 50 cycles
of 153 at 94°C and 753 at 54°C.

4 RESULTS
4.1 Glycan Miner T001 analysis

Table 2 shows the parameters used in analyzing the glycan array
data. For each dataset, a value for at and minimum support
minsup was selected such that the number of subtrees extracted
was within the range of 5—10. In general, oz ranged from 0.7 to 0.9
and minsup ranged from three to seven.

Screenshots of all of the analysis results are provided in
Supplementary information. Here, we describe the results that
were used as the basis of selecting sulfotransferase in the viral
infection experiment; in particular, we focused on the human
H1N1 virus strains A/Texas/36/1991 and A/New York/1/1918.
Figures 1 and 2 are snapshots of these results, respectively.

Fig. 2. Screenshot of Glycan Miner analysis results using human H1N1
(Texas)

First, it was interesting to note that in addition to the expected
sialylated structures, sulfate itself was retrieved in the results in
addition to the same sulfated trimer Gal ,61,4 ((S03-) 1,6)
GlcNAc in both A/Texas/36/1991 and A/New York/1/1918.
Although SA is not included, there is the possibility that the
galactose residue is sialylated. However, we were interested in
the sulfated structures in the results. Disregarding monomers,
Table 3 summarizes the structures that we selected as candidate
structures from the mining results.

4.2 Overexpression of sulfotransferase in MDCK cells

From the Glycan Miner Tool results, Gal ,6 1-4 [(S03-) 1-6]
GlcNAc was found in two different H1N1 strains among
six H1N1 strains. Five kinds of GlcNAc-6-sulfotransferases
(GlcNAc6STs), namely GlcNAc6ST—1 ~ GlcNAc6ST—5, have
been reported to have the ability to synthesize Gal ,6 1-4
[(S03-) 1-6] GlcNAc (Uchimura and Rosen, 2006), and
GlcNAc6ST—1 shows ubiquitous tissue expression pattern includ-
ing lung. Therefore, we performed overexpression of
GlcNAc6ST—1 in MDCK cells and analysis of viral infection
using a H1N1 strain. We conﬁrmed the upregulation of sulfated
GlcNAc structures using ﬂow cytometry and found that they
were increased by 257%. The mean value of hGlcNAcT 6ST -I-
overexpression cells was 32.72 against empty-vector-transfected
cells having a mean value of 12.71.

Normal MDCK cells, empty-vector-transfected cells, and
hGlcNAc6ST—I-overexpression cells were infected with H1N1
virus (Fig. 3 and Table 4). At 48 and 72h post-infection, the
amount of viral M gene that was contained in culture super-
natant was measured by the method of real-time RT—PCR. At
48 h post-infection, the amount of viral M gene in hGlcNAc6ST—
I-over-expression cells was approximately 70-fold higher than
that in normal MDCK cells. At 72h post-infection, the
amount of viral M gene in hGlcNAc6ST—I-overexpression cells
was ~13-fold higher than that in normal MDCK cells. The
amount of viral M gene in empty-vector-transfected cells was
the same as in normal MDCK cells. These results indicate that
Gal ,6 1-4 [(S03-) 1-6] GlcNAc structure in cells greatly enhances
the infection of H1N1 virus.

5 DISCUSSION

In this work, we show that our tool implementing the a-closed
frequent subtree method was able to extract a signiﬁcant pattern
from glycan array data, which we proved using a viral infection
experiment on cells with modiﬁed glycans on the cell surface.
This is the ﬁrst work to our knowledge where experts in bioinfor-
matics, glycobiology and virology collaborated and produced
signiﬁcant and promising biologically-relevant results. The data
mining technique involved subtle adjustments of the parameters
to obtain results that could be used in wet-lab experiments. The
glycobiologists provided expertise in modifying the appropriate
glycan structures on the cell surface, and the virologists provided
the appropriate cells and viruses by which the overexpressed cells
could be experimented. As a result, we were able to illustrate the
validity of data mining results by conﬁrming them using wet-lab
experiments. More importantly, we show that we have indeed
found a novel pattern other than SA in glycan structures that

may be involved in viral infection, which we reproduced in an
independent experimental setting. We make note here that the
increased viral infection may still involve SAs, but that the
change in infection was solely affected by the increased sulfation.
We also note that some interesting results have also been
obtained regarding H7N9 inﬂuenza A viruses from humans
Watanabe et al., 2013), which we plan on analyzing in the
near future for comparison with the results of this work.

For future work, we plan on increasing the functionality of the
Glycan Miner Tool by adding additional information in the
results to indicate the possible classes of glycans (e.g. N— or
0-linked, glycosaminoglycans, etc) in which an extracted sub-
structure may be found. The original glycan(s) in which the sub-
structure was found should also be displayed to assist the user in
further analysis of the dataset. It may also be useful to indicate
the net negative charge of a resulting structure, as such informa-
tion may be relevant to binding.

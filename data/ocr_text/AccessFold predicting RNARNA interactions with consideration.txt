Abstract

Motivation: There are numerous examples of RNA—RNA complexes, including microRNA—mRNA
and small RNA—mRNA duplexes for regulation of translation, guide RNA interactions with target
RNA for post-transcriptional modification and small nuclear RNA duplexes for splicing. Predicting
the base pairs formed between two interacting sequences remains difficult, at least in part because
of the competition between unimolecular and bimolecular structure.

Results: Two algorithms were developed for improved prediction of bimolecular RNA structure that
consider the competition between self-structure and bimolecular structure. These algorithms utilize
two novel approaches to evaluate accessibility: free energy density minimization and pseudo-energy
minimization. Free energy density minimization minimizes the folding free energy change per nucleo-
tide involved in an intermolecular secondary structure. Pseudo-energy minimization (called
AccessFold) minimizes the sum of free energy change and a pseudo-free energy penalty for bimolecu-
lar pairing of nucleotides that are unlikely to be accessible for bimolecular structure. The pseudo-free
energy, derived from unimolecular pairing probabilities, is applied per nucleotide in bimolecular pairs,
and this approach is able to predict binding sites that are split by unimolecular structures. A benchmark
set of 17 bimolecular RNA structures was assembled to assess structure prediction. Pseudo-energy
minimization provides a statistically significant improvement in sensitivity over the method that was
found in a benchmark to be the most accurate previously available method, with an improvement
from 36.8% to 57.8% in mean sensitivity for base pair prediction.

RNA has been increasingly recognized as an active player in cellular
biology. RNA molecules catalyze many reactions, are involved in
transcript splicing and editing and serve as signals for protein localiza-
tion (Doudna and Cech, 2002; Gesteland et al., 2005; Walter and
Blobel, 1982). The function of an RNA molecule is intimately related
to its structure, and therefore the prediction of RNA structure is an
important tool for understanding mechanism. There are a number of

single sequence (Nussinov and Jacobson, 1980; Seetin and Mathews,
2012)

Functional RNA—RNA complexes are abundant in nature and
are also used in multiple techniques for characterizing gene function
in vitro and in vivo. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) and small RNAs (sRNAs) are short RNA sequences that
bind mRNA transcripts to regulate gene expression; guide RNAs

(gRNAs) bind mRNA targets to direct post-transcriptional modifi-
cations and many spliceosomal RNAs form functional duplexes for
splicing of introns from mRNA (Birnstiel, 1988; Houseley and
Tollervey, 2009; Wu and Belasco, 2008).

Predicting RNA binding sites, especially for longer RNAs such
as mRNA transcripts, is an important step in understanding the
function of existing and newly discovered non-coding RNAs (Alkan
et al., 2006a; Pervouchine, 2004). It is also a tool for designing
siRNAs used to study gene function or as therapeutics (Heale et al.,
2005; Lu and Mathews, 2007; Tafer et al., 2008).

Computational prediction of RNA—RNA binding sites is a difficult
problem because intermolecular structure competes with the formation
of self-structure in a concentration-dependent manner. Algorithms for
prediction of intermolecular structure generally build upon single-
stranded folding algorithms and come in two main types: free energy
minimization and partition function calculations. These utilize dynamic
programming algorithms to compute the thermodynamics of folding
using parameters fit to experiments, most popularly the Turner nearest
neighbor parameters (Mathews et al., 2004, 1999a; Xia et al., 1998).
Free energy minimization schemes compute the structure with the low-
est folding free energy and are guaranteed to output the optimal struc-
ture given the input parameters and energy model. Partition function
calculations consider the entire ensemble of possible structures and are
used to determine probabilities for formation of each structure. In this
way, a partition function calculation gives the probability that each
possible base pair occurs given its prevalence within the ensemble
(Mathews, 2004; McCaskill, 1990). These algorithms are successful at
single-stranded structure prediction but perform with lower accuracy
on bimolecular structures.

To get around these challenges, there has been a focus on the de-
velopment of algorithms that predict only specific types of RNA—
RNA interactions. An example of a well-characterized biological
phenomenon for which there are multiple algorithms that perform
with relative success is the hybridization of miRNAs and their
mRNA targets. These are endogenous, 19—25 nt strands of RNA
that base pair with a target mRNA, most often at its 3’-UTR and
most often to repress translation via the recruitment of RNA-
induced silencing complex, RISC (Chaudhuri and Chatterjee, 2007).
Computational methods for the prediction of miRNA—mRNA tar-
gets rely on the well-characterized binding structures that have been
previously determined: the miRNA must be complementary to the
3’-UTR of its target mRNA; must have a strong ‘seed’ binding site at
the 5’-end of the interaction but not the 3’-end; must form a thermo-
dynamically stable duplex; the sequence of the target mRNA must
be conserved in the genomes of related species and cannot be
impeded by strong secondary structure in the target mRNA
(Chaudhuri and Chatterjee, 2007; Watanabe et al., 2007). It is clear
from this example that these algorithms are designed to test
miRNA-target structure specifically. The principles of targeting the
3’-UTR and having a more thermodynamically stable 5’-end of the
duplex do not apply to general prediction of bimolecular structure
and would lead to false positives and negatives when applied to
other types of binding problems.

It is necessary to develop a generalized algorithm for the reliable
prediction of intermolecular binding sites of unknown structure class.
This article introduces three algorithms for predicting RNA—RNA
interactions. Each of these methods predicts only bimolecular helices,
i.e. base pairs composed of one nucleotide from each of the two input
sequences, where the helices are interrupted by unpaired nucleotides in
internal or bulge loops. The first algorithm, DensityMin, computes the
minimum free energy density structure or the structure with the lowest
ratio of folding free energy change to number of nucleotides in the

bimolecular structure. It was hypothesized that minimizing density
would lead to shorter, more stable helices between strands that would
be able to outcompete the potential intramolecular pairing partners.
The second algorithm, AccessFold, uses a heuristic to utilize informa-
tion from unimolecular partition function calculations to consider ac-
cessibility of nucleotides for pairing. In this approach, an energy, which
is the sum of folding free energy change and a pseudo-energy that ac-
counts for accessibility, is minimized. The pseudo-energy scales with
the probability that a single nucleotide is involved in an intramolecular
base pair as determined by the single-stranded partition function calcu-
lation. The pseudo-energy term serves to account for the propensity to
form self-structure, excluding inaccessible nucleotides from base pair-
ing in the bimolecular structure. This pseudo-energy penalty model for
accounting for accessibility was also incorporated into the free energy
density minimization algorithm described above to test any synergistic
improvement. This algorithm is referred to as E-DensityMin, i.e.
Extended-DensityMin.

A set of 17 systems with known bimolecular structures was
assembled for benchmarking, and the performance of pseudo-energy
minimization was compared to multiple variations of free energy
minimization, partition function calculation and combination algo-
rithms designed to predict RNA—RNA interactions: BiFold,
DuplexFold, Bipartition and MaxExpect from RNAstructure (Lu
et al., 2009; Mathews, 2004; Mathews et al., 1999b); RNAplex and
RNAup from the Vienna package (Muckstein et al., 2006; Tafer and
Hofacker, 2008) and BINDIGO from the Aalberts lab (Hodas and
Aalberts, 2004). BiFold, DuplexFold and RNAplex are variations of
free energy minimization algorithms. BiFold predicts the minimum
free energy structure including self-structure and treats unimolecular
and bimolecular pairs equally (Mathews et al., 1999b). DuplexFold,
RNAplex and Bindigo do not allow self-pairing to occur. RNAplex
and Bindigo are faster because they use modified functions for com-
puting loop energies (Hodas and Aalberts, 2004; Tafer and Hofacker,
2008). Bipartition and MaxExpect are full bimolecular partition func-
tion calculations that do not consider intramolecular base pairs (Lu
et al., 2009; Mathews, 2004). Bipartition assembles structures by se-
lecting only those base pairs that meet a minimum pairing probability
threshold as determined by the user. MaxExpect computes the identi-
cal partition function, but the predicted structure is the structure with
maximum expected accuracy (Lu et al., 2009). RNAup uses a parti-
tion function calculation to determine the accessibility of an interval
of nucleotides in each strand and then computes the minimum free en-
ergy structure involving those intervals that are accessible (Muckstein
et al., 2006) and is used as the current gold standard for using accessi-
bility information. In all cases except BiFold, these are programs that
predict the structures of interacting RNA sequences but only predict
the bimolecular pairs, i.e. those pairs that involve one nucleotide from
each strand. For BiFold, both unimolecular and bimolecular pairs can
be predicted, but the class of structures is restricted to those that are
not equivalent to pseudoknots, e.g. kissing loop interactions are not
considered (Mathews et al., 1999b).

2 Methods

2.1 Overview

Given two sequences of nucleotides, A, C, G and U, the overall goal
is to predict the collection of canonical base pairs AU, GC, GU that
occur between them. This is achieved using a nearest neighbor
model in which the folding free energy change parameters were fit
to experimentally determined stabilities for stacking base pairs, in-
ternal loops, bulge loops and multibranch loops. These algorithms

use the 2004 Turner nearest neighbor parameters (Mathews et al.,
2004). The only exception is that the per helix term in multibranch
loops is set at —0.6 kcal/mol, a value more consistent with experi-
ments than the value found by optimizing structure prediction ac-
curacy (Lu et al., 2009; Mathews and Turner, 2002).

2.2 Free energy density minimization

In the free energy density minimization algorithm, DensityMin, the
optimal structure is computed by finding the intermolecular struc-
ture with the lowest folding free energy change per nucleotide in the
structure. This is implemented using a dynamic programming algo-
rithm, and the recursions are provided in the Supplementary
Materials. The number of nucleotides in the structure is often larger
than twice the sum of base pairs, as it includes internal loops and
bulges that intervene intermolecular pairs. This adds a third dimen-
sion to the usual dynamic programming algorithm storage tables, in
which the length of the interaction must be tracked in addition to
the folding energies for each subsequence. This method was first
described for single-stranded folding (Alkan et al., 2006b), and it
scales better for bimolecular pair prediction (in the absence of uni-
molecular structure as implemented here) because there are no struc-
ture branches to consider. The scaling is O(NMSL) where N is the
length of sequence 1, M is the length of sequence 2, S is the max-
imum loop size and L is the maximum number of nucleotides
allowed in bimolecular structure. DensityMin was hypothesized
to be more amenable to the RNA—RNA interaction problem by
modeling the competition between self-structure and bimolecular
structure formation.

There are several user-defined parameters utilized in DensityMin
(and E-DensityMin). The minimum and maximum number of nu-
cleotides allowed in the bimolecular structure are user-specified.
This length includes internal loops, bulges and dangling ends in both
strands. The performance reported was chosen as the best among
multiple combinations of minimum and maximum lengths: 2 or 50
nucleotides as minimum length with a maximum length of 100 or a
minimum length of 100 with maximum length of 200. An additional
user-defined parameter specifies the maximum number of unpaired
nucleotides in an internal loop or bulge loop. This is set to the stand-
ard default of 30 in each case. Results for DensityMin are reported
here using minimum and maximum lengths of interaction of 50 nts
and 200 nts, respectively, with a maximum number of unpaired nu-
cleotides of 30.

2.3 Pseudo-energy minimization

In pseudo-free energy minimization, an accessibility term for each
sequence is incorporated into free energy minimization. The parti-
tion function calculation for each sequence is first computed inde-
pendently. The probability that each nucleotide i is unpaired, Pi, is
then computed by subtracting the sum of probability that i is base
paired with any possible pairing partner. This probability is then
converted into an energetic penalty using:

‘11,": —’))RTlI1 P,"

The pseudo-energy penalty is ‘1’,- for nucleotide i, where y is a scaling
factor, R is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute tempera-
ture. In predicting the bimolecular base pairs, ‘1’,- is added to the
folding free energy for each nucleotide, 2', involved in a base pair.
This accounts for accessibility but treats each nucleotide as though
its ensemble pairing probability were independent of other nucleo-
tides. Although this is a simplification, it has been used successfully
in methods that predict structures conserved in two or more

sequences (Harmanci et al., 2008, 2011; Hofacker et al., 2004; Will
et al., 2007) and in single-sequence structure prediction (Lu et al.,
2009; Tabei et al., 2008). The scaling factor, )2, was optimized using
the dataset of experimentally determined control structures. The
total pseudo-energy, denoted by ‘I’AG", is the sum of the folding
free energy change calculated using nearest neighbor parameters
(Mathews et al., 2004; Xia et al., 1998) and ‘1’,- for each nucleotide
involved in a bimolecular base pair.

‘I’AG" is minimized using a standard free energy minimization
scheme with a dynamic programming algorithm where only bimol-
ecular pairs involving a nucleotide from each of the two sequences are
included. Loops are limited in size, a default of 30 unpaired nucleo-
tides, to reduce the scaling of the algorithm to O(NMS), where N is
the length of sequence 1, M is the length of sequence 2 and S is the
maximum number of unpaired nucleotides in loops. Note that this
scaling is for AccessFold only, and this requires a prior set of partition
function calculations, which scale O(N3 +M3). The recursions are
provided in the Supplementary Materials.

2.4 E-DensityMin

Performance for E-DensityMin is reported using a minimum and
maximum length of interaction of 100 nts and 200 nts, respectively,
and a maximum number of unpaired nucleotides in an internal or
bulge loop of 30.

2.5 Structure prediction benchmarks

The algorithms were scored using a dataset of 17 known structures
assembled for this work, including 4 two-piece tmRNAs (Gaudin
et al., 2002; Keiler et al., 2000; Sharkady and Williams, 2004), four
archaeal split pre-tRNAs (Chan et al., 2011), three human miRNA—
mRNA duplexes (Papadopoulos et al., 2009), four bacterial sRNA—
mRNA duplexes (Cao et al., 2010), one human small nuclear RNA
duplex (Birnstiel, 1988) and one gRNA—mRNA duplex from
Trypanosoma bruceiz' (Yu and Koslowsky, 2006). The inclusion cri-
teria for known structures was stringent, where only structures
determined by chemical mapping, comparative sequence analysis,
mutational analyses with compensating mutations or a combination
of these techniques were included. The split tRNAs and tmRNAs
were determined by a combination of comparative sequence analysis
and chemical mapping. The gRNA—mRNA duplex was determined
by in vitro mutational analyses. The human snRNA duplex was
determined by comparative sequence analysis. The miRNA- and
sRNA-target duplexes came from mirTarbase and sRNATarbase,
respectively, with the filter ‘Luciferase assay — mutant MRE — mu-
tant miRNA’ for miRNAs and either ‘Footprint Analysis’, ‘Point
Mutation in sRNA’ or ‘Point Mutation in mRNA’ for sRNAs with
further manual filtering for duplexes demonstrating recovery of ac-
tivity with the mutated sRNA/mRNA by a compensating change in
its pairing partner. The set of sequences and structures is provided
as Supplementary Information.

Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were used to
measure success. Sensitivity is the fraction of known pairs correctly
predicted. PPV is the fraction of predicted pairs in the known struc-
ture. A base pair is considered correct if it slipped by a single nucleo-
tide on one strand (Mathews et al., 1999a). For example, if
positions 2' and j are paired in the known structure, a predicted pair
between i and j, i — 1 and j or i and j+ 1 are considered correctly
predicted. A pair between i— 1 and i+ 1 would not be counted as a
true positive pair. False-negative pairs are those pairs that are pre-
sent in the known structure but not predicted, and false-positive
pairs are those that are predicted but are not in the known structure.

L.DiChiacchio et al.

 

Finally, to determine statistical significance in differences be-
tween algorithms, a two-tailed, paired t—test was used to compare
performance pairwise by algorithm using both sensitivity and PPV
(Xu et al., 2011). or was set to 0.05. Pairing was done on RNA fami-
lies, e.g. pairing mean performance of tmRNAs.

2.6 Optimizing y

Because of the small number of test sequences, the delete-1 jackknife
method was used to optimize y for E-DensityMin and AccessFold inde-
pendently. For each of the jackknife calculations, a set of calculations
were run with y from 0 to 1, stepping in increments of 0.1. Sensitivity
was used as a measure for optimizing accuracy, but it was found that
optimizing by PPV produces identical results. For AccessFold, y = 0.4
produces optimal result for every test case. E-DensityMin performed
with an optimal sensitivity with y = 0.8 and performed with near-opti-
mal PPV at this setting as well. Results are reported for each program
with these optimal values for 12, respectively.

2.7 Benchmarks of other software

The Vienna Package version 2.1.9 was used to run RNAup and
RNAplex. RNAup was run with consideration for structure in both
strands rather than the default of target-strand only accessibility using
the ﬂag —b. RNAup scores are reported for default parameters for
interaction length, where the maximal length of unstructured nucleo-
tides is 4 and the maximal length of interaction is 25. Additional cal-
culations allowing for larger unstructured regions up to 30 nts as well
as longer regions of interaction up to 200 nts did not improve average
performance over the defaults. RNAplex was run using default par-
ameters of maximal length for unpaired loops (40 nts) and energy
penalty for extending duplexes (0kcal/mol). Performance improved
with the application of a 0.3 kcal/mol/nt penalty for extending
duplexes using the ﬂag —c 30 (Supplementary Materials). The 2012
version of BINDIGO was run using default parameters. BiFold,
Maximum Expected Accuracy and Bipartition were run from

Table 1. Performance by sensitivity

RNAstructure version 5.8 (Reuter and Mathews, 2010). BiFold,
MaxExpect and Bipartition were run with default parameters, and
the optimal Bipartition structure reported here is assembled using a
threshold of 50% probability of base pairing.

2.8 Benchmarks of time

Time benchmarks were run on a single core of a compute node with
two 12-core Intel Xeon E5-2695 processors and 60 GB of RAM.
The ‘time’ command was used to time the program and the real time
is reported.

3 Results
3.1 Accuracy

Performance of each algorithm was assessed using a set of 17 known
bimolecular structures including miRNA—mRNA duplexes, sRNA—
mRNA duplexes, one gRNA—mRNA duplex, one snRNA duplex
and split tmRNA and tRNA structures. Tables 1 and 2 summarize
the results by RNA family in average sensitivity and PPV, respect-
ively. AccessFold has the second-highest average sensitivity, after
Bifold and the second-highest average PPV, after RNAup. Tables 1
and 2 list the performance of RNAplex using its default parameters.
Other tests were performed including accessibility in the RNAplex
calculation. The overall performance was similar, and those bench-
mark results are provided in the Supplementary Materials.

Statistical analysis using a paired t-test shows that the increase in
sensitivity by AccessFold over RNAplex and RNAup is statistically
significant (Supplementary Materials). Bifold also performed well,
providing a statistically significant increase in sensitivity over every
other program tested except for AccessFold. The improved PPV of
AccessFold over RNAplex is also statistically significant. RNAup
had the highest mean PPV of the programs tested, and the difference
in PPV between RNAup and every other program except for
AccessFold and densitymin is statistically significant. There is

insufficient power in a benchmark of this size to conclude that the
difference in PPV between AccessFold and RNAup is significant.

These results demonstrate that pseudo-energy minimization provides
a statistically significant increase in sensitivity when compared to the
best known algorithm for including self-structure, RNAup. The average
sensitivity for RNAup on this dataset was 36.8% and improved to
57.8% using pseudo-energy minimization in AccessFold. The average
PPV for RNAup was 69.7% and for AccessFold was 48.6%, but this dif-
ference was not statistically significant. Minimizing free energy density
(DensityMin) provides an increase in PPV over standard free energy
minimization (BiFold) and bimolecular partition function calculations
(Bipartition) but lowers the sensitivity. Incorporating the pseudo-energy
penalty into free energy density minimization, using E—DensityMin,
decreased the performance in both sensitivity and PPV. The free energy
density approach does not perform as well as AccessFold in either sensi-
tivity or PPV.

3.2 Time
Computational time was benchmarked for each new algorithm and
RNAup. Table 3 lists the times for representative calculations.

With shorter sequence lengths, the computation time is compar-
able; however, with sequence lengths greater than 5 00 nucleotides,
AccessFold is slower than RNAup. This is due to the computation of
a full partition function for each sequence with AccessFold as com-
pared to partition function calculations on shorter, overlapping
intervals in RNAup.

3.3 Example

Figure 1 shows a sample structure prediction, the betaproteobacte-
rial tmRNA. This structure illustrates a generalization of the struc-
tures that can be predicted by AccessFold as compared to RNAup,
which requires a continuously accessible interval for binding. In this
example, an intervening hairpin stem-loop divides the accessible

region. AccessFold does not limit the prediction to a single highly ac-
cessible interval but is still able to perform comparatively well on
cases that truly do represent a single contiguous binding site. Rather
than rigidly setting a binding site and only considering base pairs in
this location, AccessFold implicitly considers the propensity for the
hairpin stem to form and so does not consider it a likely site for
intermolecular base pairs to form. The presence of this highly penal-
ized intervening sequence, however, does not preclude the identifica-
tion of accessible pairing sites adjacent to the hairpin. These
intervening hairpins are found in the split tmRNA and split tRNA
sequences in the benchmark dataset.

AccessFold is able to consider the generalization of intervening
structures between binding sites. The accessible sites could, e.g. be
bulge or internal loops interrupted by intramolecular helices or could
be hairpin loops as in kissing hairpin loop complexes. One limitation,
however, is that the accessible regions must be closer than the max-
imum internal or bulge loop size (default of 30 nucleotides). For ex-
ample, the human small nuclear RNA duplex (Birnstiel, 1988) has a
split binding site, but the two sites are separated by over thirty nucleo-
tides, so only one of the two binding regions can be predicted by
AccessFold.

4 Discussion

A major barrier to the development of general algorithms addressing
the RNA—RNA interaction prediction problem is a limited number
of experimentally determined bimolecular structures. In many ex-
perimental applications, it is only important to know that the inter-
fering RNA binds the target, as determined by expression profiles.
In developing a general algorithm for prediction of bimolecular
structure; however, it is important to use only those structures
whose exact base pairs are determined as a test set to measure suc-
cess. In this work, a general algorithm for bimolecular structure pre-
diction was developed and benchmarked using a small set of known
structures. Accuracy could be improved when a larger set of known
structures is available for testing. Another issue is that the small set
of types of RNA—RNA interactions provides limited power to show
that differences in program performances are statistically significant.
A larger set of known structures would additionally improve this.
Although algorithms addressing specific biological problems have
been successful, particularly in predicting miRNA binding sites, it is
necessary to develop a general algorithm for newly discovered
ncRNAs. An algorithm for predicting RNA—RNA interactions that

Fig. 1. tmRNA structure. The accepted structure in the region of interaction ofthe split tmRNA from D. aromatica. The base pairs colored in red were correctly pre-
dicted by AccessFold, while the base pairs colored in blue were correctly predicted for both AccessFold and RNAup. The base pairs in gray were not correctly
identified by either algorithm. Note that the hairpin stem loop in the top strand is not able to be predicted by either program because it involves pairs from one
strand only. This hairpin stem loop interrupts the accessible region, resulting in two regions in the top strand that are accessible to binding

uses information from bimolecular free energy minimization as well as
unimolecular partition function calculations was developed here and
called AccessFold. In this approach, a pseudo-energy term is incorpo-
rated into the free energy minimization algorithm. This term scales
with the probability that a single nucleotide is involved in an intramo-
lecular base pair as determined by the single-stranded partition func-
tion calculation. The pseudo-energy term serves to penalize the
propensity to form self-structure, excluding inaccessible nucleotides
from base pairing in the bimolecular structure. A set of 17 known bi-
molecular structures was compiled for testing, and the performance of
pseudo-energy minimization was compared to multiple variations of
free energy minimization, partition function calculation and combin-
ation algorithms designed to predict RNA—RNA interactions. Pseudo-
energy minimization provides a statistically significant increase in sensi-
tivity when compared to the prior best available algorithm for con-
sidering self-structure, RNAup. This result is interesting because
RNAup rigorously calculates target structure accessibility, whereas
AccessFold uses a heuristic that assumes the probability of forming a
pair is independent of the probability the neighboring nucleotide is un-
paired. Figure 1 shows that this heuristic can be advantageous in situ-
ations where a binding site is discontinuous.

One aspect of bimolecular structure prediction that is inad-
equately addressed is the concentration dependence of interaction.
The equilibrium for formation of bimolecular pairs is concentration
dependent, but the equilibrium for unimolecular pairs is independent
of concentration. It is possible that the scaling factor, 12, is contribu-
ting to the improved performance by AccessFold by independently
weighting the unimolecular and bimolecular components of structure.
Other programs treat intra- and inter-molecular pairs equally, which
does not model interactions appropriately. On the other hand, the
scaling factor in AccessFold is also not rigorously accounting for con-
centration because a biophysical model would penalize the interaction
once per bimolecular complex, not per base pair, and also because the
concentrations of strands vary for RNA types. One possible avenue
for further improving the accuracy of bimolecular structure prediction
methods would be to explicitly account for effect of concentration on
the interaction between strands. The scaling factor, 12, also accounts
for the fact that the pseudo-free energy is treating the unpairing prob-
abilities of each nucleotide as independent. This means that the
pseudo-free energy would tend to over-penalize the opening of re-
gions for binding.

The poorer performance of DensityMin and E-DensityMin, pro-
grams that minimize the density of folding free energy change, as
compared to AccessFold indicates that predicting compact bimol-
ecular structures is not sufficient to model the competition provided
by unimolecular structure. The results are provided here as an alter-
native method for comparison.

Interestingly, for miRNA—mRNA interactions, all of the free energy
minimization approaches failed to identify the experimentally verified
target locations, with the exception of one interaction identified by
Bifold (Table 1). This suggests that when there is specific knowledge
about interactions, such as the requirement for complementarity in the
seed region that is often used in miRNA target prediction, tailored ap-
plications should to be used. These results also support the prevailing
consensus that miRNA target selection is kinetically controlled.

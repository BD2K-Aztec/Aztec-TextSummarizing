ABSTRACT

Summary: In this work we present WhichCyp, a tool for prediction of
which cytochromes P450 isoforms (among 1A2, 209, 2019, 2D6 and
3A4) a given molecule is likely to inhibit. The models are built from
experimental high-throughput data using support vector machines
and molecular signatures.

Availability: The WhichCyp server is freely available for use on the
web at http://drug.ku.dk/whichcyp, where the WhichCyp Java pro-
gram and source code is also available for download.

1 INTRODUCTION

The cytochromes P450 (CYP) is a ubiquitous enzyme family
found throughout the nature. These enzymes are involved in
the metabolism of a large majority of the drugs in use today
(Guengerich, 2006). Modeling of their interactions with drug-
like compounds have been a hot topic during the past decade,
stretching from quantum mechanical studies of reaction mech-
anisms to data mining approaches and QSAR studies (Carlsson
et al., 2010; Kirchmair et al., 2012; Rydberg et al., 2012).

The ﬁve most important human CYP isoforms, with regard to
drug metabolism, are 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4
(Guengerich, 2006). In 2009, a large high-throughput study of
inhibition to these isoforms was performed Weith et al., 2009),
enabling the application of machine learning techniques to the
classiﬁcation of CYP inhibitors. Such classiﬁcation models are
important for the prediction of drug—drug interactions.

In this work, we present WhichCyp, a publically available
software and web server for prediction of CYP inhibitors built
from these data.

2 METHODS

Inhibitory data for 17143 substances tested using quantitative high-
throughput screening with in vitro bioluminescent assay against ﬁve
major isoforms of cytochrome P450 was obtained from the PubChem
BioAssay database, AID21851 (Veith et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012).
Inorganic compounds, salts and mixtures, as well as entries classiﬁed as
inconclusive were excluded from the dataset. For each of the ﬁve

isoforms, 3000 compounds were extracted from the corresponding
dataset to use as a test set, while the remaining compounds were used
as a training set. The distribution of inhibitors/non—inhibitors for the
10 datasets is shown in the supporting information, Supplementary
Table S1.

Classiﬁcation models were constructed with support vector machines
(SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) using the libSVM library (Chang and
Lin, 2011) together with R (http://www.r-project.org/). As features for the
model building, we used molecular signatures (Faulon et al., 2003) of
heights from 0 to 4, computed with the Bioclipse software (Spjuth
et al., 2007, 2009, 2011). Molecular signatures are built up from atomic
signatures, which in turn are a type of circular atomic fragments. The
height of an atomic signature is the maximum number of bonds between
the atom and the other atoms in its atomic signature. The SVM models
were weighted by the relative number of positives and negatives in each
dataset. The optimization of C and gamma parameters in the SVM was
made through 5-fold cross validation to achieve a Matthews correlation
coefﬁcient (MCC) (Matthews, 1975) as high as possible, but with the
constraint that the sensitivity and speciﬁcity should also be similar. To
achieve this, the 1A2, 2C19 and 3A4 datasets could be optimized for
MCC alone, whereas the datasets with the most uneven distributions
(2C9 and 2D6) had to be optimized toward the highest sensitivity.

The constraint that sensitivity and speciﬁcity should be similar was
added because there are multiple use cases for the models, which have
opposite needs in this regard. First, a chemist might be interested in which
CYP isoforms would be inhibited by a compound (to avoid drug—drug
interactions), in which case sensitivity would be important. Second, the
purpose could be to make sure a compound is not metabolized by CYPs
(to enable a longer half-life), in which case speciﬁcity is important.
Finally, after the models’ performance was evaluated and best sets of
signature heights were chosen, models for all isoforms were reoptimized
and rebuilt using all experimental data—test sets used earlier in the stu-
dies were also included in the training set. These models are used in the
publicly available code.

3 RESULTS

We investigated signatures with different heights, ranging from 0
to 4, and combinations thereof. The most successful combin-
ations were combinations of heights 0—3, results for which are
shown in Table 1. Combinations of signature heights for the
ranges 0—2 and 0—4 gave similar results, but with slightly worse
area under curve (AUC) values for almost all models
(Supplementary Material). The ﬁnal models (Table 1) give ac-
curate predictions with AUC values ranging from 0.88 to 0.95,
and even sensitivity and speciﬁcity for all models except the one
for 2D6 (due to the unbalanced dataset). These results are im-
provements compared with earlier studies, in which combined
classiﬁers using ﬁngerprints resulted in AUC values of 0.81,

2011) for isoforms 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, respectively.
Other approaches that have been used were discussed in a recent
review (Kirchmair et al., 2012).

To investigate if we could determine an applicability domain
type measure, we studied the relation between the number of
signatures for the compounds in the test sets that did not exist
in the training set, and the performance of the models. It was
found that the number of missing signatures of height three
(Supplementary Figs S1—S5) could be used as an estimation of
the likelihood that the model performs well, and that the sensi-
tivity was the ﬁrst measure to drop (among sensitivity, speciﬁcity
and prediction accuracy).

4 WEB SERVER AND SOFTWARE

4.1 Interface features

The WhichCyp web server offers the user three ways to submit
molecules. The user can upload a ﬁle in any standard format,
enter SMILES strings representing molecules or draw a mol-
ecule. The results are displayed directly in the browser and in-
clude the molecular structure and highlighting of the structural
fragment that gave the most important contribution to the deci-
sion of the SVM model (see Figure 1), as well as a sensitivity
warning if there are too many missing signatures of height three
(deﬁned as the number of missing signatures in the test set that
resulted in a sensitivity of 50.6).

4.2 Implementation

The web server uses php code to run WhichCyp and the interface
functionality. To support all standard formats, uploaded ﬁles are

converted by Open Babel (O’Boyle et al., 2011) when necessary.
The web server code was copied from the SMARTCyp web
server (Rydberg et al., 2010). WhichCyp is implemented using
the CDK Java library (Steinbeck et al., 2003, 2006).

4.3 Java program

The server runs a command line Java program that also is avail-
able for download as both an executable jar ﬁle and as source
code. The Java program has several optional ﬂags to enable the
user ﬂexibility in what output is generated.

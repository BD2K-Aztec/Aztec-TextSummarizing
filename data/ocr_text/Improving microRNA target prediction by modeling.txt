Abstract

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are extensively involved in
many physiological and disease processes. One major challenge in miRNA studies is the identifica-
tion of genes targeted by miRNAs. Currently, most researchers rely on computational programs to
initially identify target candidates for subsequent validation. Although considerable progress has
been made in recent years for computational target prediction, there is still significant room for al-
gorithmic improvement.

Results: Here, we present an improved target prediction algorithm, which was developed by mod-
eling high-throughput profiling data from recent CLIPL (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation fol-
lowed by RNA ligation) sequencing studies. In these CLlPL-seq studies, the RNA sequences in each
miRNA-target pair were covalently linked and unambiguously determined experimentally. By ana-
lyzing the CLIPL data, many known and novel features relevant to target recognition were identified
and then used to build a computational model for target prediction. Comparative analysis showed
that the new algorithm had improved performance over existing algorithms when applied to inde-
pendent experimental data.

Availability and implementation: All the target prediction data as well as the prediction tool can be
accessed at miRDB (http://mirdb.org).

1 Introduction

 

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play im-
portant regulatory roles in many physiological and disease processes
(Ambros, 2004). About 2000 human miRNAs have been reported
(Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014) and collectively these
miRNAs regulate the expression of thousands of gene targets at
both post-transcriptional and translational levels (Baek et al., 2008;
Lim et al., 2005; Selbach et al., 2008). Reliable identification of
gene targets is critical for functional characterization of miRNAs.
Currently, experimental identification of miRNA targets is a time-
consuming process and thus most researchers rely on computational
tools to first predict a set of promising target candidates for further

experimental validation. The first step in computational target pre-
diction is to identify relevant features that are characteristic of
miRNA target recognition. In recent years, significant progress has
been made on this subject and multiple features that are relevant to
miRNA targeting have been reported, such as target pairing to the
5’-end of the miRNA (i.e. the ‘seed’ sequence) and structural accessi-
bility of the target sites for miRNA binding (Bartel, 2009; Kertesz
et al., 2007; Khorshid et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Long et al.,
2007; Robins et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2005). For algorithm devel-
opment, the next step is to combine various target recognition fea-
tures in a computational model for target prediction. To achieve this

important but challenging objective, high-quality experimental
training data are usually required to properly weight various target
features for development of prediction models. Most existing target
prediction algorithms have been developed in this way by training
with various high-throughput profiling data, such as with micro-
array profiling data (Agarwal et al., 2015; Betel et al., 2010;
Grimson et al., 2007; Wang and El Naqa, 2008) or with CLIP
(crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) sequencing data (Gumienny
and Zavolan, 2015; Liu et al., 2013; Reczko et al., 2012). However,
despite steady progress in computational target prediction, available
bioinformatics tools still have sub-optimal performance as revealed
by subsequent validation experiments.

Currently, one major obstacle in computational algorithm devel-
opment is the lack of high-quality training data from experimental
studies. In recent years, multiple high-throughput studies have been
performed to experimentally identify miRNA targets. For example,
a major experimental strategy, CLIP has been developed to identify
transcript targets associated with functional miRNA-induced silenc-
ing complex (miRNA-RISC) (Chi et al., 2009; Hafner et al., 2010;
Zhang et al., 2007). One prominent example is HITS-CLIP, which
identifies short transcript sequences that are bound to the Ago pro-
tein by cross-linking the RNA strand to the protein, followed by
immunoprecipitation and high-throughput RNA sequencing (Chi
et al., 2009). Another widely used experimental strategy for target
identification is to analyze downregulated transcripts by miRNA
overexpression with microarrays (Lim et al., 2005; Linsley et al.,
2007; Wang and Wang, 2006). These high-throughput experimental
datasets had previously been utilized to train multiple established al-
gorithms for miRNA target prediction. Although highly useful, there
are also major challenges associated with CLIP-seq or microarray
data for target prediction modeling. One major unresolved issue is
that the exact target sequence in each miRNA/target pair is un-
known. As a result, computational inference, which is an error-
prone process, is necessary to predict the target sites from CLIP-seq
or microarray data. To address this challenge experimentally, im-
proved CLIP strategies have been developed to directly identify
miRNA-target pairs residing in the same RISC complexes (crosslink-
ing and immunoprecipitation followed by miRNA/target ligation,
termed CLIPL in our analysis). The first CLIPL-seq method, termed
CLASH, was reported by Helwak and colleagues (Helwak et al.,
2013). Subsequently, another similar CLIPL-seq method was also re-
ported by Grosswendt et al. (Grosswendt et al., 2014). The CLIPL-
seq method can unambiguously identify both a miRNA and its cog-
nate target site in the same RISC complex, thus allowing direct char-
acterization of miRNA target recognition features. With CLIPL-seq,
thousands of miRNA-target pairs have been identified (Grosswendt
et al., 2014; Helwak et al., 2013). In this study, public CLIPL-seq
data were systematically analyzed and used to develop an improved
algorithm for miRNA target prediction.

2 Methods

2.1 Data retrieval and processing

Two public CLIPL-seq datasets were included in our analysis,
including one from the Helwak study (CLASH data) (Helwak et al.,
2013) and the other from the Grosswendt study (Grosswendt et al.,
2014). Raw RNA-seq data from the CLASH study were down-
loaded from the NCBI GEO database (Barrett et al., 2013). In add-
ition, the list of curated miRNA/target pairs was downloaded from
the journal’s website (Helwak et al., 2013). In the CLASH study,
HEK293 cells were first crosslinked by UV irradiation. Crosslinked

RISC complexes containing both miRNAs and target transcripts
were then immunoprecipitated. As a key step in the protocol, RNA—
RNA ligation was performed to covalently ligate the miRNA and its
target transcript in the same RISC complex. The identity of both the
miRNAs and the ligated target transcripts was determined by
sequencing of the chimeric RNA strands. Similar to the CLASH ana-
lysis, the Grosswendt dataset contains a list of ligated pairs
of miRNAs and their cognate target transcripts captured from the
same RISC complexes. In the Grosswendt study, ligated miRNA-
target pairs were identified from Caenorhabditis elegans, using an
experimental protocol similar to that described in the Helwak study.
Ligated miRNA-target pairs were also identified in mammalian cells
from multiple public studies (mainly in human HEK293 cells and
mouse T cells) (Grosswendt et al., 2014). The list of human
miRNA-target pairs identified from the Grosswendt study was
downloaded from the journal’s website (Grosswendt et al., 2014)
and included in this study.

For RNA-seq raw data, the sequence reads were aligned to the
transcriptome with BLAT (Kent, 2002). miRNA sequences were
downloaded from miRBase (Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014),
and all other transcript sequences as well as gene mapping index
files were downloaded from the NCBI ftp site (NCBI Resource
Coordinators, 2015). The 3’-UTR (untranslated region) sequences
were parsed with BioPerl (http://www.bioperl.org) based on
GenBank annotations. Orthologous gene relationships were com-
puted using the NCBI HomoloGene database (NCBI Resource
Coordinators, 2015 ). Predicted miRNA targets by public computa-
tional algorithms were retrieved from the respective public websites
[TargetScan 7.0 (Agarwal et al., 2015), http://targetscan.org;
DIANA-MicroT (Reczko et al., 2012), http://diana.cslab.ece.ntua.
gr; miRanda-mirSVR (Betel et al., 2010), http://microrna.org;
RNA22 (Miranda et al., 2006), https://cm.jefferson.edu/rna22/].
The target transcript IDs from all these algorithms were mapped to
NCBI Gene IDs for subsequent comparative analysis.

Public high-throughput profiling data were used for evaluation
of target prediction algorithms. The microarray data reported by
Hafner et al. (2010) were analyzed to evaluate the impact of
miRNAs on regulation of target RNA expression. In this microarray
study, 25 miRNAs were suppressed in HEK293 cells by antisense
oligonucleotide inhibitors, and the impact on the transcriptome was
determined with Affymetrix Human U133Plu52 chips. Microarray
raw data from the Hafner study were downloaded from the NCBI
GEO database, and then normalized and log2-transformed using the
Bioconductor RMA method (http://www.bioconductor.org). Array
signals from transcripts of the same gene were combined and aver-
aged. Genes with undetectable expression in HEK293 cells were
excluded from further analysis. The fold change of gene expression
due to miRNA inhibition was calculated by comparing to the nega-
tive control arrays.

2.2 Computational tools and data analysis

RNA secondary structures were calculated with RNAfold
(Hofacker, 2003). The predicted structures were analyzed to deter-
mine whether individual nucleotides were base-paired or exposed.
Statistical computing was performed with the R package (http://
www.r-project.org/). Statistical significance (P-value) for the train-
ing features was calculated with Student’s t—test or X2 test. LIBSVM
was used to build miRNA target prediction models with support
vector machines (SVMs) (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/).
For SVM analysis, a radial basis function (RBF) was used for kernel
transformation. Optimization of the REF kernel parameters was done

with grid search and cross-validation according to the recommended
protocol by LIBSVM. Recursive feature selection was done with
Weka (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) to evaluate the inde-
pendent contribution of each training feature in the SVM modeling.
All predicted targets and the newly developed prediction tool are
available at miRDB (http://mirdb.org).

3 Results

3.1 Identification of miRNA targets from CLIPL-seq data
The CLIPL method represents a major improvement over conven-
tional CLIP methods, as both the miRNAs and their cognate target
transcripts from the same RISC complexes can be simultaneously
identified. In this way, the one-to-one relationship can be unambigu-
ously established for a miRNA and its cognate target transcript in
the same RISC complex. Thus, CLIPL-seq data have provided an un-
precedented opportunity to identify features that are characteristic
of miRNA target recognition. Two CLIPL datasets (Grosswendt
et al., 2014; Helwak et al., 2013) were analyzed and combined in
this study (described in ‘Methods’ section).

From CLIPL studies, a large number of identified miRNA targets
were of non-canonical type, i.e. without involving perfect pairing to
the miRNA seed region. However, based on recent analysis of
CLIPL-seq data, non-canonical targeting usually does not lead to
significant target downregulation at either the RNA or protein level
(Wang, 2014). In support of this view, although there are excep-
tional cases indicating the functional relevance of non-canonical tar-
gets, almost all validated miRNA targets reported in literature are of
the canonical type. Thus, in this study, we decided to focus on ca-
nonical targets, as most functional miRNA studies are centered on
regulation of target expression (more details presented later in
‘Discussion’ section). Specifically, all identified miRNA/target pairs
from CLIPL studies were screened for perfect pairing between a
miRNA seed (positions 2—8) and its target-binding site. The CLASH
and Grosswendt datasets contain 705 and 1443 canonical miRNA/
target pairs, respectively. These 2148 pairs of miRNA/targets were
combined and used as positive training data for further target fea-
ture analysis.

Negative training data were also compiled from the CLIPL-seq
studies. Specifically, a set of potential non-target sequences were se-
lected based on the following criteria: (i) The non-target site does not
overlap with any sequence tags identified in the CLIPL experiment,
including both ligated miRNA/mRNA chimeras and free unligated
mRNA tags (which constituted the vast majority of all RNA-seq
reads); (ii) the target site is from a transcript with detectable expres-
sion level in the cells as revealed by microarrays; and (iii) the target
site pairs perfectly to the seed sequence of a miRNA, which is ran-
domly selected from a list of all expressed miRNAs in the cells. By im-
plementing these screening criteria, 4000 non-target sequences were
randomly selected as negative controls for target feature analysis.

3.2 Characterizing target recognition features
Target and non-target sequences were directly compared to identify
features that are characteristics of miRNA target recognition.

3.2.1 Patterns of nucleotide usage in the target site

Local nucleotide composition surrounding the seed-binding sites
was compared between the target sites and non-target sites. In gen-
eral, the target sites had significantly lower GC content compared
with the non-target sites (P = 1.3E-123 with Student’s t-test).
All four mono-nucleotide counts were significantly different in the

target sites compared with the non-target sites, with G being the
most underrepresented (15 and 24% in targets and non-targets, re-
spectively, P = 9.6E-129; Table 1). Interestingly, there was only a
slight bias against C in the target sites (21 versus 23%, P = 3.9E-7),
indicating that low overall GC content was most likely a reﬂection
of strong bias against G in the target-binding sites.

Among all 16 dinucleotide counts of the target sites, GG was
most underrepresented and UA/AU/UU was most overrepresented
(Table 1). Positions 2—8 in the target sites are seed-binding site, and,
as shown in Figure 1A, the most significantly different bases in target
sites (as compared with non-target sites) were all located adjacent to
the seed-binding site. Among all the bases in the target site, the one
immediately upstream of the seed-binding site (position 9) was most
significant (P = 7.7E-111). Among all target sites, 57% had U at pos-
ition 9; in contrast, U was present at the same position in only 27%
of the non-target sites (enrichment ratio = 2.1, Table 2). Due to the
strong preference for U at position 9 in the target site, all three other
bases were significantly depleted. Of note, there was no preference
for A, and thus the enrichment of U at position 9 cannot be explained
by the general requirement of low GC content in the target sites.
Previous studies have demonstrated that there was a strong prefer-
ence for A at position 1 (Bartel, 2009). Consistently, A was found to
be significantly enriched at position 1 (49% in target sites versus
24% in non-target sites, P = 1.7E-85). Besides positions 1 and 9, sig-
nificant differences in base usage were observed at multiple other
positions, especially at positions 10—13 (Table 2, Fig. 1A). Of note, G
was significantly depleted at these positions. In contrast, the usage of
C was not different at most of these positions.

3.2.2 Structural accessibility of the target site

Multiple studies have shown that structural accessibility plays an
important role in miRNA target recognition (Kertesz et al., 2007;
Long et al., 2007; Robins et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2005). With the
CLIPL training data, it is now possible to precisely determine the ac-
cessibility of individual nucleotides in the target sites. Specifically,
local secondary structures of the target sites were calculated with
RNAfold (Hofacker, 2003). In general, the target sites were signifi-
cantly more accessible compared with the non-target sites, as meas-
ured by the free energy value (AG) of the folding structures (P 2

2.8E-119 with Student’s t—test). At individual nucleotide level, mul-
tiple bases surrounding the 3’-end of the seed-binding site (position 2)
were significantly more exposed in target sites compared with non-
target sites (Fig. 1B). In particular, the accessibility of the base at pos-
ition 2 was the most significant (P = 8.8E-13). Thus, free exposure of
the 3’-end of the seed-binding site is a strong feature for miRNA tar-
get recognition. Interestingly, there was no difference in base

accessibility surrounding the 5’-end of the seed-binding site (positions
6—9). This implies that it is possible that individual nucleotides
involved in miRNA seed binding play distinct roles in target recogni-
tion, with the 3’-end of the seed matching site first recognized by the
miRNA, followed by successive unwinding and seed pairing for the
entire seed-binding region.

3.2.3 Seed pairing with the target site

As reported previously, the seed-binding sequence of a target site is
often conserved across multiple species (Bartel, 2009; Wang and El
Naqa, 2008). The level of seed site conservation was evaluated in
five species, including human, mouse, rat, dog and chicken. The
count of conserved species for each site was used to evaluate seed
site conservation. Consistent with previous reports, seed site conser-
vation was very significantly different between target and non-target
sites (P = 7.3E-248 with X2 test). The seed conservation feature has
been included as a principle requirement in most existing target pre-
diction tools. Although useful for the elimination of a large number
of false positives, the stringent requirement of sequence conservation
in the mean time also excludes many bona fide target sites that are
not evolutionarily conserved. To account for this in our prediction
algorithm, sequence conservation was used as a contributing selec-
tion feature, but not as a requirement. In this way, both conserved
and non-conserved target sites could be identified.

Previous studies have demonstrated that canonical 7-mer
miRNA seed, occupying positions 2—8, is the most important seed
type (Bartel, 2009). Besides the 7-mer seed, other types of seed may
also play important roles in target recognition. For example, a per-
fect terminal base match will convert a 7-mer seed matching site
into an 8-mer seed matching site (binding to positions 1—8 in the
miRNA). Among all the target sites, 33% had a terminal base match
(i.e. 8-mer seed-binding sites), in contrast to 25% of the non-target
sites (P = 6.3E-10 with X2 test). Furthermore, recent analysis of the
CLASH data indicates that thermodynamic stability of the seed/tar-
get binding is a significant determinant of target recognitions pat-
terns (Wang, 2014). To this end, the stability of base pairing
between miRNA seed- and target-binding site was calculated with
the nearest neighbor method using thermodynamic parameters for
RNA—RNA base pairing (Xia et al., 1998). Compared with non-tar-
get sites, miRNA seed/target binding was generally less stable as
indicated by free energy calculation (P = 8.7E-7 with Student’s t-
test). The potential role of non-seed—based target binding was also
investigated. In this analysis, all pentamers from the non-seed region
of a miRNA were screened against the 5’-end of the target-binding
site to identify any sequence match. In this way, significant enrich-
ment of pentamer-matching motifs were discovered in the target
sites (P = 2.0E-15 with X2 test).

3.2.4 Location of the target site

The activity of a target-binding site is related to its location in the
3’-UTR (Gaidatzis et al., 2007; Grimson et al., 2007). A target site
buried in the middle of a long UTR will make the site less accessible
to miRNA binding. In our analysis, the target and non-target sites
were compared to determine any difference in their UTR location.
Overall, target sites were preferentially located in shorter 3’-UTRs
as compared with non-target sites (P = 2.2E-20 with Student’s t-test
for the evaluation of UTR length difference between the
two groups). Consistent with previous studies, the CLIPL ana-
lysis confirmed that target sites tend to reside toward either end of
the 3’-UTR; specially, target sites were more likely to be found
within 200 nucleotides from either end of 3’-UTR as compared with

non-target sites (P = 1.6E-27 with X2 test). Conversely, non-target
sites were more likely to be found to be at least 800 bases away
from either end of the 3’-UTR (P = 2.9E-30 with X2 test).

3.3 Target prediction model and genome-wide

target prediction

The above described structural and sequence features were modeled
in a SVM framework for algorithm development. Recursive feature
elimination (RFE) was performed to identify the most important in-
dependent features for target prediction. In this RFE analysis, all the
sequence features were analyzed collectively in an SVM framework.
The least predictive feature was first identified by SVM and subse-
quently eliminated. The remaining features were then evaluated
again collectively to identify the next least predictive feature for
elimination. The process was repeated with one feature (the least
predictive one from the collection of all remaining features) elimi-
nated from each cycle until only one feature was left. SVM-RFE is
especially useful to determine the independent contribution of each
feature for model performance. Fifty top ranking sequence features
selected by SVM-RFE are listed in Table 3, and were used for build-
ing target prediction models. A scoring system was developed to
compute prediction scores for all genes in the genome. Most genes
have a single predicted target-binding site, while some genes have
multiple predicted sites. In both cases, the target prediction score
was computed for each gene as the following:

S = 100* (1 — H15),
i=1

where n represents the number of predicted target sites and P,- repre-
sents the statistical significance for each predicted site as estimated
by the SVM model. The scores for single-site genes were calculated
using the same equation with n = 1. These scores, ranging from 0 to
100, were used to rank the relative significance of the predicted tar-
gets. A gene candidate with a score of over 50 was predicted to be a
target. The final prediction model, which we named MirTarget, was
then used for genome-wide prediction of miRNA targets in human,
mouse, rat, dog or chicken. The predicted targets are presented in an
online database, miRDB (http://mirdb.org). Detailed statistics of
genome-wide target prediction are presented in the Statistics page of
miRDB. Of note, among all predicted targets, 23% were non-con-
served targets. Beside the 3’-UTR, predicted unconventional target
sites in the coding region or 5’-UTR are also presented in the
Custom Prediction page of miRDB. Furthermore, the prediction
tool, MirTarget can be accessed via the miRDB web server interface.

The performance of MirTarget was evaluated with receiver oper-
ating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. CLIPL-seq training data
were analyzed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the pre-
diction model. To reduce potential overtraining risk, 10-fold cross-
validation was performed. Specifically, the dataset was randomly
divided into 10 sample groups of equal size. For each iteration, sam-
ples from one group were removed and an SVM model was trained
using samples from the remaining nine groups. The removed sam-
ples were then used for independent model testing. The process was
repeated until all the sample groups had been used independently
for model testing. For each iteration, a slightly different SVM model
was generated for testing. In the end, the prediction results from all
ten SVM models were added together and presented in Figure 2.
Besides MirTarget, four established algorithms (TargetScan,
DIANA-MicroT, miRanda-mirSVR and RNA22) were also eval-
uated in this ROC analysis. As shown in Figure 2, MirTarget had

Fig. 2. ROC analysis of algorithm performance. ROC curves were constructed
to evaluate MirTarget and four other target prediction algorithms using
CLIPL-seq data. Ten-fold cross-validation was performed for MirTarget pre-
diction to reduce potential over-training risk

independent unseen data. Thus, the best way to evaluate the per-
formance of MirTarget would be to apply it to independent testing
data. In this study, the general applicability of MirTarget was eval-
uated with independent microarray data (Hafner et al., 2010). In
this public study, 25 miRNAs were concurrently inhibited and the
impact on target RNA expression was evaluated with microarrays.
In this analysis, predicted targets by different algorithms were eval-
uated in the context of gene expression changes. First, we examined
cumulative target distribution in relation to transcriptional expres-
sion changes. As shown in Figure 3A, the targets predicted by
MirTarget were most upregulated as compared with the targets pre-
dicted by other algorithms. The average transcriptional expression
change from top-ranking targets (300 targets on average per
miRNA with the highest prediction scores from each algorithm) was
also evaluated. As shown in Figure 3B, targets predicted by
MirTarget had on average the highest fold change in upregulation.
Further, all target prediction scores from each algorithm were corre-
lated to gene expression changes by Pearson correlation analysis. As
shown in Figure 3C, MirTarget prediction scores had the highest
correlation to gene expression upregulation as compared with other
algorithms. True miRNA targets were expected to be upregulated
due to miRNA inhibition. Thus, the microarray profiling data sug-
gested that MirTarget was most effective at identifying true miRNA
targets.

4 Discussion

One major obstacle in computational target prediction is the lack of
reliable experimental data to guide computational data modeling.
To map the target sites for individual miRNAs more precisely,
CLIPL methods have been developed recently to link a miRNA to its
target site in the same RISC complex. Thus, CLIPL-seq profiling
data have provided an unprecedented opportunity to study miRNA
target recognition features in a more precise manner as compared
with conventional approaches (Breda et al., 2015 ). In particular, by
analyzing individual nucleotide positions in the target sites, many
novel position-specific sequence and structural features have been
identified (presented in Fig. 1 and Table 2). Further, CLIPL analysis
also confirmed certain well-characterized target features such as

arrays. (A) The curves in the plot represent cumulative distributions of all pre-

target site location within the transcript. By combining both known
and newly identified target recognition features, an improved target
prediction model, MirTarget was developed by training with
CLIPL-seq data. The robust performance of MirTarget has also
been validated with independent experimental profiling data.

Both canonical and non-canonical target sites have been identi-
fied in CLIPL-seq studies. However, our recent CLIPL-seq analysis

indicates that non-canonical targeting usually does not lead to target
downregulation (Wang, 2014). As such, non-canonical targeting
represents a set of interesting but poorly understood miRNA/target
interactions that are not directly related to regulation of target ex-
pression. In contrast, canonical targeting involving perfect seed pair-
ing usually leads to significant target downregulation. This raised an
interesting question as to how an effective miRNA target should be
defined. Non-canonical binding between a miRNA and a transcript
could be functionally important, but may not involve target downre-
gulation. One possibility is that non-canonical miRNA binding to a
transcript may be related to the competing endogenous RNAs hy-
pothesis as a way to sequester miRNAs from regulating the expres-
sion of canonical targets (Salmena et al., 2011). In this study, the
main focus is to identify miRNA target sites, which leads to signifi-
cant downregulation of target expression upon binding by the
miRNA. Thus, only canonical target sites are considered by the pre-
diction model. However, we would like to emphasize that prediction
of non-canonical-binding sites may also be of practical importance,
especially when functional impacts of such non-canonical inter-
actions are better characterized in the future.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Predicting trajectories of signaling networks under com-
plex perturbations is one of the most valuable, but challenging, tasks
in systems biology. Signaling networks are involved in most of the
biological pathways, and modeling their dynamics has wide applica-
tions including drug design and treatment outcome prediction.
Results: In this paper, we report a novel model for predicting the cell
type-specific time course response of signaling proteins under unseen
perturbations. This algorithm achieved the top performance in the
2013 8th Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and
Methods (DREAM 8) subchallenge: time course prediction in breast
cancer cell lines. We formulate the trajectory prediction problem into a
standard regularization problem; the solution becomes solving this
discrete ill-posed problem. This algorithm includes three steps:
denoising, estimating regression coefficients and modeling trajectories
under unseen perturbations. We further validated the accuracy of
this method against simulation and experimental data. Furthermore,
this method reduces computational time by magnitudes compared to
state-of—the-art methods, allowing genome-wide modeling of signaling
pathways and time course trajectories to be carried out in a practical
time.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein signaling networks, especially those involving phospho-
proteins, play a critical role in diverse cellular functions and are
related to ahnost all pathways (Barrios-Rodiles et al., 2005;
Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011; Olayioye et al., 2000; Sachs
et al., 2005). Understanding these networks under defined per-
turbations, e. g. inhibitions or stimulations on certain gene(s), has
wide applications in many medical ﬁelds, especially cancers,
which are heterogeneous in their genetics (Dillon et al., 2007;
Hochgrafe et al., 2010; Meric-Bernstam and Gonzalez-Angulo,
2009; Taylor et al., 2009).

Experimental methods that quantify the dynamics of the
signaling phosphoproteins tend to be expensive and time-
consuming, making them unaffordable to be extended to the
genome scale and tested under a large number of perturbations.
Mass spectrometry-based methods are now the major approach
used to quantify dynamic changes in phosphoproteins, i.e. tra-
jectories of these proteins over time (Aebersold and Mann, 2003;
Ong and Mann, 2005). They are vitally important for inferring
signaling networks, drug responses and treatment outcome (di
Bernardo et al., 2005; Gardner et al., 2003; Luan et al., 2007;
Morris et al., 2011; Steffen et al., 2002). Knockdown coupled
with phosphoproteomics can help determine the causal relation-
ships between signaling elements (Bansal et al., 2007; Maetschke
et al., 2013; Marbach et al., 2010). However, these experiments
are labor-intensive and unlikely to be carried out for a large
number of perturbations or a large number of knockdown
genes. Thus, computational modeling becomes vitally important
for predicting time course signaling network dynamics under
unseen situations.

Generally, cell line-specific signaling network dynamics under
several known perturbations are observed. The observed data are
time course data describing phosphorylation levels of phospho-
proteins at different time points and under several different
perturbations. The task is to predict time course responses if
new drugs/perturbations come in (with the knowledge of their
targeted proteins). Thus, given phosphorylation-level data EZXU)
for a group of proteins (k in l to N) sampled at a series of time
points under perturbations 191,192, . . ., we are interested in the
phosphorylation levels EZ’WU) for the same group of proteins
under a new, unobserved perturbation pnew for the same time
course.

Computationally predicting the response of signaling networks
under unseen perturbations remains a challenging task. First,
current models for reconstructing directional signaling networks
tend to be time-consuming (Hill et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2004),
preventing them to be applied to the genome scale. The algo-
rithms that are capable of reconstructing directional networks
are usually designed to search the prohibitively large space of
all possible network structures through temporal models. This
basic approach renders the problem to be insolvable at the
genome scale, even they are explored using an efficient probabil-
istic algorithm. For example, Molinelli et al. (Molinelli et al.,
2013) recently proposed belief propagation (BP)-based searching
method, which is three orders of magnitude faster than previous
standard Monte Carlo methods used in this field, but still re-
quires minutes to solve a network with 40 proteins. However, the

Dynamic trajectory prediction

 

human genome contains about 500 protein kinases and an esti-
mated 6000 proteins modiﬁed by kinases (Manning et al., 2002;
Whisenant et al., 2010). Because the time required to reconstruct
the network is exponentially growing with the number of pro-
teins, these methods are impossible to be applied to the genome
of a typical mammalian species.

Second, the performance of most established algorithms is not
satisfactory. As quoted from the DREAM 3 report (Prill et al.,
2010), ‘Overall, a handful of best-performer teams were identi-
ﬁed, while a majority of teams made predictions that were
equivalent to random.’ DREAM 3 challenges focused on the
same topic of the most recent DREAM 8: signaling cascade
identiﬁcation and signaling response prediction. It is indeed re-
peatedly observed from community blind assessments that the
actual performance of most submitted algorithms are not far
from random guesses (Prill et al., 2010). Thus, a more accurate
mathematical model different from what has already been estab-
lished must be sought.

Last but not least, even if these networks can be established at
a smaller scale, it is still challenging to use these networks to
accurately predict trajectories for a time course under unseen
situations. Most of the previous endeavors have focused on infer-
ring the network structures, but not predicting its changes over
time. Thus, we developed a novel mathematical model to solve
the above challenges in signaling network modeling. We formu-
late the network inference problem into a standard-form regu-
larization problem, and the solution to this discrete ill-posed
problem was found using truncated singular value decompos-
ition (TSVD). This new method developed here has four advan-
tages: (i) Highly accurate: In the 2013 DREAM 8 subchallenge:
time course predictions, this algorithm was the top performing
one when tested on experimental data; it also achieved the top
performance in aggregated experimental and in silico results.
Furthermore, it was identiﬁed as the most consistent performer,
deﬁned as robustly ranked first when evaluated with a subset of
data. (ii) Highly computationally eﬂicient: Both the network in-
ference and the trajectory prediction steps of this algorithm take
linear time to the number of proteins, which allow us to achieve
magnitudes of improvement in speed over previous methods,
making its application to the genome scale possible. (iii)
Capable of de novo prediction: This algorithm is capable of infer-
ring network structures and predicting trajectories without any
prior knowledge of signaling interactions. (iv) Able to incorporate
unseen perturbations: By manipulating the solution to the regu-
larization problem (the regression coefﬁcient matrix), the levels
of phosphoproteins under unseen perturbations can be predicted.

2 METHODS

In this study, we developed an algorithm for reconstructing signaling
networks through formulating the problem into a standard regularization
problem and estimating its solution with TSVD. The algorithm then
predicts the trajectory of phosphoproteins under new inhibitors by
manipulating the regression coefﬁcients of the networks. This trajectory
predication method contains four steps (Fig. 1): (i) Collect time course
phosphorylation data under several separate perturbations. (ii)
Determine the regression coefﬁcient matrix representing the inﬂuence
level (positive and negative) of protein i on protein j. (iii) Estimate the
starting phosphorylation levels of the proteins under unseen

perturbations. (iv) Iteratively predict the phosphorylation level across a
time course under new inhibitors.

2.1 Assumption

We make the ﬁrst-order Markov and stationary assumption (Friedman
et al., 1998; Husmeier, 2003): every variable at a given time point I,- only
depends on the variables at the previous time point t,-_1. Furthermore, we
assume that the value of a variable remains stable without the inﬂuence
from any other variables (including self-regulation). Equation 1 is the
foundation of our method:

N
Etc-+1): Eta.) + 20510.) x RM) + s (1)
j= 1
Where Ek(t,-) represents the phosphorylation value for protein k at the it},
time point, RM is the regression coefﬁcient indicating how much protein j
will affect protein k. N is the number of proteins and 8 is the error caused
by uncontrollable factors such as measurement errors.

2.2 Inferring matrix R

Combining Equation 1 for all proteins, all time points and all inhibitors,
we can form the following equation:

R1,1 R2,1  RN,1 E101) E102) EIUT—i)
R1,2 R2,2  RN,2 E201) E202) E2(tT—l)
RLN RZN  RNJV EN(11) EN(12) EN(IT_1)

(E1(12)— E100) (E103) — E102» (E1(IT) — E1(lT—1))

(E202) — E201» (E203) — E202» (EXIT) — E2(tT—l)

(ENUz) — ENC 1)) (EN(I3) — EN(12)) (ENUT) — ENUT—i)

(2)

For the convenience of description, we assign an abbreviation for each
matrix in Equation 2:

RT=(T+ — T) (3)

Where each element in T is the observed phosphorylation value for a
phosphoprotein at a given time point, whereas the corresponding element
in T + is the observed value for the same protein at the next time point.
Both T and T + are obtained from the observed time course data and R is
the unknown regression coefﬁcient matrix we are interested in.

The problem can be solved by:

R=(T+—I)1H (h

T I in Equation 4 is the pseudo-inverse of matrix T. There are numer-
ous pseudo-inverse methods, such as singular value decomposition
(SVD) (Golub and Reinsch, 1970), QR method, L1-regu1ation and
L2—regulation. To handle the noise 8 in Equation 1, we used truncated
SVD (Hansen, 1990; Henry and Hofrichter, 2010), a variant of SVD,
which has been shown to have nice properties in denoising the data in
other domains of application (Hansen 1998; Hansen et al., 1992).
Truncated SVD (TSVD) allows us to reduce the effect of noise and cal-
culate the pseudo-inverse matrix. In TSVD, the ﬁrst step is to decompose
the observed phosphorylation matrix into:

T=U2W‘ (3

Where U and V are unitary matrices, VT is the transpose matrix of V and
Z is diagonal matrix. A convention is to order the diagonal matrix 2 in

gular values of original matrix T. Elements on the diagonal matrix 2 are
non-negative real numbers.

As there may be zero-value elements on the diagonal matrix 2, inverse
matrix 2_1 does not exist. In traditional SVD, the 24 is calculated
using following equation:

Note that this is a pseudo-inverse operation that 2271741.

Because the small values caused by noise in the diagonal matrix
may result in extremely large values in 2T1, the noise is emphasized
and dominates the inverses diagonal matrix using traditional SVD.
A truncating step is therefore used to prevent the ampliﬁcation
of noise. A truncation parameter is deﬁned, which speciﬁes the number
of the largest elements to be kept in the diagonal matrix 2, while
the rest of the elements will be set to zero in 2T1. Thus, the ampliﬁca-
tion to the observation noise is restrained. In TSVD, Equation 6 is
written as:

1
_ f (i, 5 Truncation Parameter)
Z 1(1‘, 1'): 20, z)
0 (i, >Truncation Parameter or Z (i, i) = 0)

(7)

Finally, based on Equations 4, 5 and 7, the regression coefﬁcient
matrix can be calculated as:

R: (T — T)V2‘1UT (8)

2.3 Determine the starting phosphorylation levels

Under an unseen inhibitor, there is no access to the phosphorylation
levels at the ﬁrst time point. A protein’s initial phosphorylation level
was therefore set to its average value at the time 0 under observed inhibi-
tors. Furthermore, proteins, when targeted by an inhibitor(s), tend to
have different initial phosphorylation levels compared with the levels
when they are not targeted. Thus, we excluded the data points for in-
hibited proteins in the training data when estimating the starting points.

2.4 Adjust the inﬂuence of inhibited proteins

The activities of the phosphorylation proteins targeted by inhibitors are
expected to be much lower than what are calculated in the matrix R in
Equation 8. To model the situation of a complete inhibition, the

contribution of inhibited proteins toward other proteins was set to 0
when predicting the unseen trajectory of phosphorylation levels.

0 Antibody i is inhibited
Ri j Z , (9)
RM otherw1se

Equation 9 is applied to both inferring the R matrix (Equation 2) and
predicting the dynamics of levels of phosphorylation under unseen
situation.

During the model training, time course data under different inhibitors
can be combined together in Equations 2, 3, 4 and 8, i.e. multiple
observed trajectories under different perturbations could be combined
to predict a single regression coefﬁcient matrix R (see Supplementary
Material).

2.5 Iterativer predict the phosphorylation levels across a
time course

After estimating the phosphorylation levels of each protein at the ﬁrst

time point E,(t1) and adjusting the regression coefﬁcient matrix R based

on the new, unseen inhibitors, Equation 1 is used iteratively to predict the

time course phosphorylation levels at the rest of the time points under this

speciﬁc perturbation.

3 RESULTS

This trajectory prediction method is a regression-based method
using the ﬁrst-order Markov and stationarity assumption. It ﬁrst
estimates the regression coefﬁcients between phosphoproteins
and determines the starting phosphorylation levels under
unseen perturbation, then predicts the trajectory one time point
by one time point. In the following sections, we ﬁrst demonstrate
the accuracy of this algorithm using simulation data. Second, we
evaluate the prediction accuracy under different assumptions,
such as different levels of noise and regression coefﬁcient
matrix density. Third, we examine the accuracy of this method
on experimental data in breast cancer cell lines.

3.1 Simulation model

A simulation study was performed using 20 phosphoproteins,
seven time points with ﬁve different inhibitions. The simulation
model is constructed following the description in previously stu-
dies (de Jong et al., 2003; Hill et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2004).

Dynamic trajectory prediction

 

Brieﬂy, the simulation contains six steps: (i) A random regression
coefﬁcient matrix R with a non-zero element density of 15% is
generated and its non-zero values are replaced by values in a
uniform distribution of ([—0.2, —0.02] U [0.02, 0.2]). These
values represent the effect of one phosphoprotein on the phos-
phorylation value of another protein, where positive values rep-
resent activation relationships and negative values represent
inhibition relationships. A zero-element indicates that the ﬁrst
phosphoprotein has no effect on the second phosphoprotein.
(ii) Proteins’ initial phosphorylation levels are randomly gener-
ated from a uniform distribution over [1, 10]. (iii) Randomly
select one (or two) inhibited protein(s) and adjust the corres-
ponding elements to 0 in the regression coefﬁcient matrix R,
for simulating phosphorylation dynamics under deﬁned inhibi-
tors. (iv) Equation 1 is used to iteratively generate the observed
time course data. (v) A normally distributed noise e~N(0, 0.1)
or N(0, 0.5) or N(0, 1.0) is added to each phosphoprotein at
every time point. (vi) Repeat step 3 and 5 to generate time
course trajectories under ﬁve different inhibitors.

To evaluate the performance of our method, we simulated
5-fold cross-validation for 100 repeated runs. Thus, this predic-
tion method uses time course data under four inhibitors as train-
ing data and data under the remaining inhibitor are used as the
test set and withheld from model training.

3.2 Evaluation 011 reconstructing the signaling networks

As this prediction method predicts the regression coefﬁcient
matrix before predicting the trajectories over a time course, we
ﬁrst evaluated how well it can recover the true regression coefﬁ-
cient matrix. Figure 2 shows the area under receiver operating

 

characteristic curve (AUC) and area under precision recall curve
(AUPRC) under low (0.1), medium (0.5) and high (1.0) noise
levels with different denoising truncation parameters (as
described in Equation 7). The performance under each of the
noise level and parameter combination was an average of 100
simulations.

We found that the denoising step (truncation in TSVD) is
critical for recovering the original signaling networks (Fig. 2).
In the case that the noise is small, the performance reaches max-
imum (AUC = 0.74, AUPRC = 0.48, compared with a baseline
of 0.5 and 0.15) with a truncation parameter of 8 (Equation 7).
As the noise level increases, a stronger denoising step is required,
represented by less retained values in the diagonal matrix. As
expected, the performance slightly drops with the increase of
noise level (AUC = 0.7 for medium level of noise, and
AUC = 0.67 for very high level of noises), i.e. the signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR, deﬁned as the average of the original phos-
phorylation levels divided by the SD of noise) is ~14 (medium
level) to 6.6 (high level). This performance was achieved without
any prior knowledge.

3.3 Inﬂuence of truncation parameters

To evaluate the accuracy of this algorithm in predicting the phos-
phorylation dynamics across a time course under new perturb-
ations, we calculated root-mean-square error, or RMSE, to
measure the difference between predicted trajectory values and
the withheld values during the cross validation. For each protein
and each time point, the predicted value will be compared against
the simulated values and differences between these values are
considered as the prediction error.

One critical parameter in this prediction method is the trunca-
tion parameter (Equation 7), where a strict parameter and thus
less retained elements in the diagonal matrix indicate stronger
denoising effort. The accuracy in terms of RMSE under different
parameters and different noise levels is therefore evaluated
(Fig. 3). Under the noise level of 0.1 (low noise level), this
method remarkably recovers the shadowed trajectory with a
RMSE equals to 0.8, where the RMSE for random prediction
is >4 (truncation parameter = 8). Even if the noise level is
increased to 1.0, this method is still able to deliver a close pre-
diction with a RMSE <1 .5. As expected, loose parameters (>10),
could barely estimate the hidden trajectory because of the ampli-
ﬁed noise effect using traditional SVD and result in a high level
of errors. Furthermore, when the noise level is high, a strict trun-
cation parameter (= 3) performs better in terms of RMSE
(Fig. 3c) because of its strong denoising effect.

Furthermore, the simulation results indicate that the number
of protein and sparsity of signaling network does not change the
optimal truncation parameter, while, as we expected, noise level
could inﬂuence the truncation parameter (see Supplementary
Figs Sl—S3 for more details). Based on the RMSE in the cross-
validation, the optimal truncation parameters are 3—10, depend-
ing on the noise level, i.e. the optimal truncation parameter is
5—10 under low noise level (SNR: l4) and is 3—5 under high
noise level (SNR< 14).

3.4 Inﬂuence of noise level

Subﬁgures (d), (e) and (f) of Figure 3 show the RMSE at each
time point under different noise levels. A parameter of eight

 

elements retained in the diagonal matrix is used in these subﬁ-
gures. The predicted phosphorylation levels at the ﬁrst point
after the starting time point is extremely accurate, with a
RMSE value almost the same as the noise level, indicating that
we could ahnost perfectly recover the real phosphorylation levels.
The prediction error starts to increase in the following time
points, as noise accumulates during the iterative prediction
steps. The RMSE predicted by our method is much smaller
than random prediction baseline. Taking the low noise level as
an example, the predicted trajectory has a RMSE of 0.1 at the
ﬁrst point (which is the same as the noise level) and 0.253 at the
second time point, the RMSE increases to 1.60 at the last time
point due to the accumulation of the prediction error in each
iteration. At the same time, the random prediction has RMSEs
ranging from 3.91 to 9.55, which are 5 to 38 folds larger than this
prediction model.

3.5 Inﬂuence of sparsity of signaling network

To assess the robustness of this prediction method, we have
evaluated the prediction error against different inﬂuence matrix
densities of the signaling networks (Fig. 4). We found that better
performance is achieved when the inﬂuence matrix is sparse.
With the increased density of non-zero elements and thus more
complex network structure, the performance is slightly reduced,
but the RMSE values are always <l.5 (compared with a RMSE
of 7.02 for random prediction), indicating that this algorithm can
robustly perform well even for networks with very complex struc-
tures, i.e. many interactions.

Inference Matrix Density

Fig. 4. Inﬂuence of matrix densities. This ﬁgure illustrates the perform-
ance of the prediction method under different densities of the inﬂuence
matrix. This result is evaluated under the low noise level (0.1) with a
truncation parameter, which keeps eight largest elements in the diagonal
matrix. The RMSE is evaluated from 100 runs

3.6 Computational time

Figure 5 shows the computational time required for this method
and other two state-of—the—art network inference methods: dy-
namic Bayesian network (DBN) (Hill et al., 2012) and BP
(Molinelli et al., 2013). The computational time is evaluated on
a PowerEdge R410 processor, with four cores and 48 GB
memory.

This new algorithm takes <0.01 s for 20 proteins, while DBN
costs ~l s and BP takes >l min. When dealing with 40 proteins,
both DBN and BP need >10 min, whereas TSVD only takes
0.01s. This algorithm has a linear computational time require-
ment, and the computational time required for 2560 proteins is
only 22.7 s. Compared with DBN and BP, TSVD are consistently
hundreds of folds faster. Therefore, we conclude that this new
algorithm offers tremendous computational performance advan-
tage over the state-of—the-art methods, and make the genome-
scale reconstruction of signaling networks possible.

3.7 Validation using experimental data

We further validated this method using time course phosphoryl-
ation data in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 (Hill et al.,
2012). These data contain eight time points from three replicates,
under different levels of EGF stimulus (0, 5 and 10ng), for 20
proteins. In the validation, we used data under 0 and 10 ng EGF
stimulus as training data and evaluated how well it can recover
the phosphorylation levels under 5 ng EGF stimulus. Data from
replicates are treated as separate time course observations.

Considering that the signal-to-noise ratio, which is determined
by the average of the phosphorylation levels divided by the SD
between replicates, is 14.5 (close to the median level of noise and
larger than the low level of noise in simulation), a truncation
parameter = 6 is used in TSVD. This model is robust that trun-
cation parameters ranging from 5 to 10 all deliver predictions
with similar accuracy.

Fig. 5. Computation time. This ﬁgure shows the computational time
required to reconstruct the signaling network. The computational cost
is evaluated under 100 repeated measurements. DBN and BP are only
measured under 10, 20 and 40 proteins because of their exponential com-
putational time required

Figure 6 shows the predicting accuracy for experimental data.
The average RMSE for the eight time points is 0.06, while
random prediction baseline (for 100 runs) is 0.91, indicating
15-fold reductions in error. Notably, the average SD of phos-
phorylation levels between experimental replicates is 0.015. This
indicates that the prediction performance (RMSE = 0.06) almost
approximates the performance of real perturbation experiments
affected by noises such as measurement error, which strongly
supports the effectiveness of our algorithm.

4 DISCUSSION

Analyzing time course trajectories under unseen perturbations
has important application in model biology, such as predicting
dynamic phosphorylation networks, drug responses and treat-
ment outcomes. However, previous research mainly focused on
recovering the relationship between phosphoproteins. In this art-
icle, we describe a novel framework to predict trajectories under
unseen perturbations.

We found that the noise level and the signaling network dens-
ity have noticeable inﬂuence on the prediction accuracy.
However, this model is able to handle all the noise levels and
signaling network structures with a satisfying performance. The
effectiveness of this model is also validated using experimental
data on a breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468. The experimen-
tal validation indicates that the predicting error of this model is
at the similar level as the difference between experimental
replicates.

The effectiveness of this model was demonstrated in the 8th
Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods
(DREAM 8: https://www.synapse.org/#IWiki:syn1929437/
ENTITY/ 63075) challenge as the best performing and most con-
sistent method (judged by RMSE, see Supplementary Materials
for more details) in the subchallenge time course prediction
(Stolovitzky et al., 2007). In this subchallenge, both experimental

Fig. 6. Predicting errors in experimental data. This ﬁgure illustrates the
accuracy of this trajectory predicting method in recovering experimental
data. The predicted time course trajectory (red line) has a much lower
RMSE across all the time points compared with random prediction (blue
line). Additionally, RMSE of the predicted trajectory (0.06) is compar-
able with the difference between replicates (0.015, black line), indicating
robust performance of the algorithms

data and simulation data have been given and the corresponding
prediction accuracy has been evaluated.

This algorithm is extremely computationally time efﬁcient,
which could predict the trajectory for 20 variables in <0.01s,
and the number of variables versus computational time is close
to linear. This model does not require any prior signaling net-
work information, so it is applicable to any cell type without
extra effort if given appropriate time course data. These charac-
teristics promise application of this algorithm to genome-wide de
novo network reconstruction and trajectory prediction under
unseen perturbations.

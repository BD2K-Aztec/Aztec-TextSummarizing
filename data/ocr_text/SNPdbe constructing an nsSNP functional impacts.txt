ABSTRACT

Summary: Many existing databases annotate experimentally
characterized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Each non-
synonymous SNP (nsSNP) changes one amino acid in the gene
product (single amino acid substitution;SAAS). This change can
either affect protein function or be neutral in that respect. Most
polymorphisms lack experimental annotation of their functional
impact. Here, we introduce SNdee—SNP database of effects,
with predictions of computationally annotated functional impacts
of SNPs. Database entries represent nsSNPs in dbSNP and
1000 Genomes collection, as well as variants from UniProt and
PMD. SAASs come from >2600 organisms; ‘human’ being the
most prevalent. The impact of each SAAS on protein function is
predicted using the SNAP and SIFT algorithms and augmented with
experimentally derived function/structure information and disease
associations from PMD, OMIM and UniProt. SNdee is consistently
updated and easily augmented with new sources of information.
The database is available as an MySQL dump and via a web front
end that allows searches with any combination of organism names,
sequences and mutation IDs.

1 INTRODUCTION

Resources like dbSNP (Sherry et al., 2001) and UniProt (Bairoch
et al., 2005) contain many experimentally determined nsSNPs,
but few of these are annotated with respect to function. Some
databases [e.g. PMD (Kawabata et al., 1999)] contain experimental
annotations of functional effects of mutants. However, these are
sparsely populated and do not directly link to dbSNP or UniProt.
For the vast majority of mutations lacking experimental annotation,
we can gauge functional impact only Via in silico analysis.

Proper use of computational methods requires speciﬁc skills
and resources generally inaccessible to medical researchers or
experimental biologists. To help, we created an MySQL database
readily usable by non-experts. We collected SAASs from PMD,
dbSNP, 1000 Genomes (1000_Gen0mes_Project_C0nsortium,
2010) and UniProt ‘Variant’s and ‘mutant’s. We also store ‘conﬁict’
records to illustrate how sequencing discrepancies may lead to
differing interpretations of the functional signiﬁcance of a given

sequence position. For each SAAS we predict the functional effect
using SNAP (Bromberg and Rest, 2007) and SIFT (Ng and Henikoff,
2001). Where available, predictions are augmented by experimental
annotations and associated human diseases. We also compute
evolutionary conservation of the mutant positions. A web interface
provides convenient access to underlying data Via organism,
sequence and mutation ID queries.

2 DATA SETUP AND RETRIEVAL

Database: SNdee mutation data comes from dbSNP, UniProt, 1KG
and PMD (Fig. 1A). UniProt and PMD store protein sequences
explicitly, while dbSNP links to RefSeq (Pruitt et al., 2007). dbSNP
collects 1KG variants with a time delay, so for SNdee we mapped
all 1KG nsSNPs to RefSeq using Annovar (Wang et al., 2010). We
keep only one version of redundant protein sequences, referenced
by md5 checksums irrespective of origin. Redundancy is assessed
at full-sequence identity (maximum one substitution per sequence)
over the entire sequence (+/— leading Met residue). This allows
correlating mutations from different sources referencing the same
sequence. We currently store 1362 793 unique SAASs in 158004
proteins from 2684 organisms covering all kingdoms of life; the
top ﬁve contributors are human, mouse, rice, cow and rat. For
each SAAS we provide the following information: (i) SNAP and
SIFT binary predictions of functional effects (neutral/non-neutral).
(ii) Evolutionary conservation information from PSIC (SunyaeV
et al., 1999), PSI—Blast (Altschul et al., 1997) PSSMs and frequency
scores from runs against PDB (Berman et al., 2000) and UniProt.
(iii) Functional effects from PMD and UniProt. For human SAASs,
disease associations are also available from PMD, UniProt and
OMIM (Amberger et al., 2009) (Fig. 1B). (iV) dbSNP evidence
and average heterozygosity, and (iV) interesting functional/structural
features (UniProt) at the mutation site. Data are stored in an MyS QL
database and are downloadable as a dump ﬁle.

Web interface: The database is web-accessible allowing
gene/protein ID/name, disease, sequence (or its md5 hash) and
mutant-based queries. Some queries (e.g. md5, gene ID) are
exact. Sequence queries are BLAST similarity based. Keyword
searches (e.g. disease) are ‘loose’, i.e. matched to corresponding
free text ﬁelds. The results page lists all SAASs found within the
speciﬁed sequence and their functional effect predictions, wild-
type/mutant conservation scores, information on disease (human
only), experimentally derived functional/structural consequences,
changes in position biochemical properties, per-variant validation
status and average heterozygosity. This information is also

accessible Via single/batch mutation queries with dbSNP rsids, PMD
or SwissVar IDs or SAASs in the XposY format (and associated
sequence). The user can (i) restrict queries to speciﬁc organisms or
protein keywords; and (ii) search for mutants in similar sequences.
Query results may be sorted by different attributes and downloaded
in CSV format. Linkouts to referenced web resources are available.

Example: dbSNP rsid 104894374 describes the mutation R157W
in the RDH5 gene. This mutation is associated with eye disease,
F undus albipunctatus (OMIM 601617.0008). Both SNAP and SIFT
predict this substitution to be non-neutral. Indeed, it results in loss
of activity in the gene product (PMD A010122). By combining
mutation disease associations and their functional effects new
inferences can be made about molecular functions altered in disease.

3 CONCLUSION

SNdee is designed to ﬁll the annotation gap left by the high cost of
experimental testing for functional signiﬁcance of protein variants.
It joins related bits of knowledge, currently distributed throughout
various databases, into a consistent, easily accessible and updatable
resource. The major features distinguishing SNdee from other
databases are: (i) the inclusion of a much wider array of organisms
and data sources; and (ii) the explicit differentiation between
functional/structural effects and disease associations. Furthermore,
unlike SNdee, existing resources (i) lack experimental annotation
of functional/structural changes or offer only single tool (e.g.
SIFT) predictions (Mooney and Altman, 2003; Thorn et al., 2010),
(ii) are limited to naturally occurring variants (Chelala et al.,
2009), (iii) are not consistently updated (Jegga et al., 2007; Wang
et al., 2006) or (iV) do not offer pre-computed effects on a large
scale (Reva et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2010). SNdee’s database
schema and management scripts are designed to easily handle the
addition of new sequences and SAASs and the integration of new
predictors and sources of experimental data. Monthly updates are
planned. Information about current versions of included databases
and statistics is available from SNdee website. Our ultimate goal

is to make SNdee a toolbox for biologists and medical researchers
dealing with mutation data. Computationally acquired predictions
and annotations found in SNdee will help design and prioritize
further experimental research.

ABSTRACT

Summary: SORTALLER is an online allergen classifier based on
allergen family featured peptide (AFFP) dataset and normalized
BLAST E-values, which establish the featured vectors for support
vector machine (SVM). AFFPs are allergen-specific peptides panned
from irredundant allergens and harbor perfect information with
noise fragments eliminated because of their similarity to non-
allergens. SORTALLER performed significantly better than other
existing software and reached a perfect balance with high specificity
(98.4%) and sensitivity (98.6%) for discriminating allergenic proteins
from several independent datasets of protein sequences of diverse
sources, also highlighting with the Matthews correlation coefficient
(MCC) as high as 0.970, fast running speed and rapidly predicting a
batch of amino acid sequences with a single click.

1 INTRODUCTION

Allergy symptoms affect more than 25% of the population in
industrialized countries (Ball et al., 2009). The allergy mechanism
is an immunological reaction against an allergen that is often IgE
mediated, but non-IgE mediated (i.e. cell mediated) or mixed IgE
and non-IgE mediated reaction may be more important in food
allergy (Boyce et al., 2010). Biotechnology is rapidly developing,
which involves the introduction of novel proteins into drugs or foods,
and those proteins can be allergenic (Nestle, 1996). It is essential
to avoid transferring a gene that encodes a major allergenic protein
(from any source) into a drug/food crop that did not previously
contain that protein. To accurately discriminate candidate genes from
allergens before transferring those into a drug/food organism would
aid preventive efforts to curb the rising incidence of allergies.
Sequence comparison of novel proteins for similarity to known
allergens is a critical part of the weight of evidence approach
used to ascertain the safety of the gene(s) to be transformed. Over

the past 5 years, several sophisticated bioinforrnatic methods have
recorded substantial achievements in allergen prediction (Barrio
et al., 2007; Fiers et al., 2004; Muh et al., 2009; Saha and Raghava,
2006; Zhang et al., 2007). Although these tools are effective for
predicting allergenic proteins from sequence segments that show
homology with known allergens, they are less accurate for novel
proteins with low similarity to any known allergens, especially for
the undeveloped exogenous genes with desirable traits.

In this study, we developed an allergen prediction method,
SORTALLER, which predicts allergens by using a novel algorithm
on allergen family featured peptides (AFFPs), which were
substantially optimized on most of the SVM-based (Webb-
Robertson et al., 2010) classiﬁer parameters. SORTALLER
outperformed other methods and achieved a perfect balance between
high sensitivity and high speciﬁcity for discriminating allergenic
proteins from diverse sources. This method could be used as the
ﬁrst step of programmed allergenicity assessment, and a web server
of SORTALLER has been developed to allow for simultaneously
and rapidly predicting a batch of amino acid sequences.

2 METHODS AND RESULTS
2.1 Datasets

A total of 2359 allergenic protein sequences were ﬁrstly obtained from
the Allergome database (Mari et al., 2006), the Swiss-Prot Allergen Index
(http://www.uniprot.org/docs/allergen.txt), the Food Allergy Research and
Resource Program allergen protein database (http://www.allergenonline.
orgl) and the Allergen Nomenclature database of the International Union
of Immunological Societies (http://www.allergen.org/). After ﬁltered by
negative results of IgE binding, 2290 allergenic protein sequences were
retained.

The non-allergenic protein sequences were excerpted from commonly
consumed commodities and human by searching in the UniProt/Swiss-Prot
protein database (Bairoch et al., 2005). 234 760 non-allergenic protein
sequences were retained by a ﬁltering process (detailed in Supplementary
material).

2.2 Allergen classiﬁer

After analyzing the AFFP rationale, we have panned 444—556 AFFPs from
211 known families and ungrouped allergenic proteins by adopting a speciﬁc
screening procedure with different sliding window sizes. Of all allergen
families, more than half of the families contained only one AFFP, and most
AFFPs were shorter than 200 aa (detailed in Supplementary material).

aAllergen sorting was conducted on a Perl script referenced in the FAO/WHO
guidelines: an identity of at least six contiguous amino acids or a minimum of 35%
sequence identity over a window of 80 amino acids with an allergen would deduce
cross-reactivity.

A SVM-based classiﬁer was constructed and optimized in concert on
two major parameters, i.e. sliding windows of different peptide lengths for
AFFP identiﬁcation and the constant C value in sigmoid function for raw
BLAST E-value scaling. It was shown that 20 amino acids was the optimal
peptide length for AFFP screening and the C value of 4 in the sigmoid
function contributed to the optimum effects on allergen prediction. Matthews
correlation coefﬁcient (MCC; Mizianty et al., 2010) value as high as 0.969
manifested the best prediction result acquired under this circumstance (see
Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. S2).

2.3 Benchmarking performance in comparison with
existing methods

The independent dataset of 1000 sequences (including 500 allergens and
500 non-allergenic proteins) and 14 arduous proteins (including at least
four allergens referenced by IgE experiments) were used to compare
SORTALLER with the following methods that can be accessible: (i) the
FAO/WHO evaluation scheme, which is based on the identity of six or
more contiguous amino acids or a minimum 35% sequence identity over
a window of 80 amino acids; (ii) EVALLER (Barrio et al., 2007); (iii)
three different prediction methods of AlgPred (Saha and Raghava, 2006);
(iv) AllerHunter (Muh et al., 2009); (V) APPEL (Cui et al., 2007) and (Vi)
Allermatch (Fiers et al., 2004). As shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Table
S3, the SORTALLER software signiﬁcantly outperformed the other methods
and achieved a perfect balance between substantially higher speciﬁcity and
sensitivity in discriminating allergens from diverse sources.

The following aspects may contribute to the superiority of SORTALLER,
such as MCC used as the performance measuring end point, which
orchestrated two parameters, speciﬁcity and sensitivity, to express an
unbiased accuracy indicator; the appropriate amount of AFFPs bearing
enough information of allergens and synergetically optimized sigmoid
function; BLAST used for fast and reliable detection of the similarities of
query sequence with AFFPs (detailed in Supplementary material).

3 CONCLUSION

SORTALLER is unique since it is founded on preferential panning
of speciﬁc AFFPs harboring perfect information for allergens
sorting based on a thoroughly optimized procedure. The novel
classiﬁer outperformed other methods and exhibited highly balanced
sensitivity and speciﬁcity and higher accuracy. Moreover, the AFFP
dataset incorporated in SORTALLER would be useful for regimens
of component-resolved diagnosis and peptide immunotherapy.

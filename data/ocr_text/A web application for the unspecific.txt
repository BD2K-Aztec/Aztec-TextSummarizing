Abstract

Genomic technologies allow laboratories to produce large-scale data sets, either through the use
of next-generation sequencing or microarray platforms. To explore these data sets and obtain max-
imum value from the data, researchers view their results alongside all the known features of a
given reference genome. To study transcriptional changes that occur under a given condition, re-
searchers search for regions of the genome that are differentially expressed between different ex-
perimental conditions. In order to identify these regions several algorithms have been developed
over the years, along with some bioinformatic platforms that enable their use. However, currently
available applications for comparative microarray analysis exclusively focus on changes in gene
expression within known transcribed regions of predicted protein-coding genes, the changes that
occur in non-predictable genetic elements, such as non-coding RNAs. Here, we present a web ap-
plication for the visualization of strand-specific tiling microarray or next-generation sequencing
data that allows customized detection of differentially expressed regions all along the genome in
an unspecific manner, that allows identification of all RNA sequences, predictable or not.
Availability and implementation: The web application is freely accessible at http://tilingscan.uv.es/.
TilingScan is implemented in PHP and JavaScript.

1 Introduction

 

Eukaryotic genomes are composed by coding and non-coding DNA
sequences. Until recently it was thought that most coding regions
had been identified, as they encode either protein-coding genes,
highly conserved ribosomal RNA, transference RNA or other minor
non-coding RNA (ncRNA) species which open reading frames
(ORF) are relatively easy to find (Brent, 2007). Only 5’ and 3’ ex-
tended transcribed regions outside the ORF and some introns were
not easily predictable (Bahrami-Samani et al., 2014; Machado-Lima
et al., 2008). During the last years, however, evidence from different

sources has made clear that most of the assumed ‘non-coding’ DNA
was, in fact, encoding non-predictable RNA molecules. These non-
coding sequences have proven not only to be expressed, but also to
play many different regulatory roles within the cell (Mattick and
Makunin, 2006).

Current genome-wide methods, such as tiling microarrays and
next generation sequencing (NGS) provide platforms for the study
of transcriptomes. In most cases, transcriptomic analyses are per-
formed to compare relative RNA abundance in different samples,
such as wild type versus mutant or before versus after stress

induction (Molina-Navarro et al., 2008; see Perez-Ortin et al., 2012
for a review). Most current algorithms and bioinformatic applica-
tions for comparative analysis in tiling arrays or NGS exclusively
search for expression changes within known transcribed regions of
predicted genetic elements (see Suarez et al., 2009 and Bahrami-
Samani et al., 2014, for reviews). Changes in transcript length, exist-
ence of unpredicted introns, antisense transcripts, or other unanno-
tated ncRNAs are not detectable using these algorithms. To meet
this need, we have developed TilingScan, a new web application for
the visualization of microarray data that has been implemented with
a new search algorithm for the detection of differentially expressed
regions in an unsupervised manner. For this detection, we have de-
veloped a version of the geometric moving average algorithm, which
corresponds to the class of methods of stationary random processes
and constitutes one of the several methods developed for the detec-
tion of abrupt changes in a signal (Basseville and Nikiforof, 1993).
This algorithm scans the signal based in scalable and sliding win-
dows and searches for over- or under-expressed regions of a min-
imum size of nucleotides flanked by neutral regions (see
supplementary materia for detailed description). Rather than focus-
ing on changes in protein-coding genes exclusively, the application
detects changes that occur all along the genome, including unanno-
tated ncRNA, and then assigns them to the specific genetic elements
annotated, if any. In addition, provided that microarray data signals
often display noisy profiles, TilingScan enables the application of a
smoothing algorithm that is based on a Gaussian filter, allowing sig-
nal noise removal prior to the search and clearer visualization of the
data. The application can be used to analyze NGS data provided
that BAM files are converted into compatible files using freely avail-
able software as described in the tutorial.

2 Implementation of the website

The website is implemented in PHP and JavaScript. PHP was used
for the detection of significant differentially expressed regions and
JavaScript was used for interactive visualization of the regions.
Depending on the nature of the data set, strand specific or non-
strand specific, visualization can be selected. By uploading data sets
to the server each user can create a new project that will be saved
under a unique identifier provided by the website (Project ID) as
well as under a personal identifier selected by the user. This ID
allows easy access to every created project, allowing different re-
search groups to collaborate by sharing the specific project ID. The
website contains a tutorial and a set of demonstration data for the
trial of the application prior to any use. Along with the visualization
and the detection of regions, the website has been implemented with
a smoothing algorithm for signal noise removal (Gauss filter), as
well as with a tool for manual annotation of regions of interest
(Annotate!).

3 Structure and usage of the website

3.1 Visualization tool

The application enables the upload of data from tiling array (or data
from NGS converted to BAM files) results as genome graphs, which
display probe intensity alongside the genomic sequence, aligning it
to a reference genome provided by the user. This allows customized
visualization of either specific chromosomes or specific genes of
interest using the Visualize chromosome and Visualize gene tools
(Fig. 1A). If signal smoothing is required, the application of the
Gaussian filter can be manually selected prior to visualization, and

permuted the desired number of times. If proper visualization of a
specific region is required, a region of choice can be delimited and
zoomed for X and Y scale adjustment. By delimiting a region manu-
ally and selecting the Annotate option, specific features of the se-
lected region will be registered (such as chromosome, chromosomal
coordinates, length and mean intensity value on each strand) and
listed in a table, which can be edited and downloaded for further use
(Fig. 1C).

3.2 Analysis tool for the detection of differentially
expressed regions

For the detection of differential expression, the application has been
implemented with a search algorithm that is based on a sliding win-
dow model (See Supplementary Material for description). Using the
search tool (Window search) the application will accurately locate
and identify differentially expressed regions, displaying both graph-
ical outputs (Fig. 1B) and the register of the above-mentioned region
features (chromosomal coordinates, length, etc.). If a given region is
detected at specific genomic coordinates that correspond to
previously annotated genetic elements, the ORF names found within
the region will also be recorded. These regions will not only be
annotated automatically after the user runs the search analysis, but
can also be selected and annotated manually if other regions of
interest are found via the Annotate! tool.

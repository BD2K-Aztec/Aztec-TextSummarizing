ABSTRACT

Motivation: The increasing availability of metabolomics data
enables to better understand the metabolic processes involved in
the immediate response of an organism to environmental changes
and stress. The data usually come in the form of a list of metabolites
whose concentrations significantly changed under some conditions,
and are thus not easy to interpret without being able to precisely
visualize how such metabolites are interconnected.

Results: We present a method that enables to organize the data
from any metabolomics experiment into metabolic stories. Each
story corresponds to a possible scenario explaining the flow of
matter between the metabolites of interest. These scenarios may
then be ranked in different ways depending on which interpretation
one wishes to emphasize for the causal link between two affected
metabolites: enzyme activation, enzyme inhibition or domino effect
on the concentration changes of substrates and products. Equally
probable stories under any selected ranking scheme can be further
grouped into a single anthology that summarizes, in a unique subnet—
work, all equivalently plausible alternative stories. An anthology is
simply a union of such stories. We detail an application of the
method to the response of yeast to cadmium exposure. We use this
system as a proof of concept for our method, and we show that we
are able to find a story that reproduces very well the current know-
ledge about the yeast response to cadmium. We further show that this
response is mostly based on enzyme activation. We also provide a
framework for exploring the alternative pathways or side effects this
local response is expected to have in the rest of the network. We
discuss several interpretations for the changes we see, and we sug-
gest hypotheses that could in principle be experimentally tested.
Noticeably, our method requires simple input data and could be
used in a wide variety of applications.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the main goals of metabolic studies is to understand the
metabolic processes involved in the adaptation to an environ-
mental change. Recently, metabolomic techniques gained the
spotlight by providing a way to monitor metabolism by measur-
ing the concentration of metabolites in different conditions or at
different time points. A typical result from such an experiment is
a list of metabolites whose concentrations signiﬁcantly changed
when the cell or organism was exposed to some stress. How to
interpret this list became then a new research topic, consisting in
identifying the metabolic processes that link the metabolites
of interest, possibly explaining the observed variations in their
concentrations. This topic goes in the literature by the name
of “metabolite set enrichment analysis’, and is an extension to
metabolism of work that was initiated in the context of transcrip-
tomics and then proteomics under the name of “gene set enrich-
ment analysis’ [see (Subramanian et al., 2005) for what is
possibly the ﬁrst work on this and (Khatri et al., 2012) for a
recent survey]. The simplest idea one may think of is to highlight
the set of metabolites identiﬁed in the experiment that have
signiﬁcantly changed their concentration, let us call them discri-
minating compounds, and then to visually analyze their intercon-
nections. This is what is done notably in Xia et a]. (2012).
However, like a number of other approaches on metabolite set
enrichment analysis, the projection of enriched metabolites is
done on pathways instead of the whole network, thereby missing

(alternative) pathways not annotated in current databases, or
more generally paths traversing several pathways.

For genome-scale networks, the metabolism of a whole organ-
ism is considered, which may be large (Thiele and Palsson, 2010),
whereas a metabolic perturbation caused by some stress condi-
tion may impact only a small portion of this complex network.
Even if it is sometimes possible to visually identify the pathways
that explain some of the variations in the monitored metabolites,
getting an overall explanation for all the observed variations
usually cannot be performed by visual inspection.

Recently, automatic methods have been proposed to deal with
this kind of data (Antonov et al., 2009; Dittrich et al., 2008;
Faust et al., 2010; Leader et al., 2011). A natural idea is to try
to link all discriminating compounds through chains of reac-
tions. One possible model for this is by means of a Steiner
tree, which is a minimum cost tree that connects all nodes
belonging to a predeﬁned subset called terminals, which in the
case of metabolism would be the discriminating compounds
(Dittrich et al., 2008; Scott et al., 2005). However, any pair of
metabolites may be connected through several alternative paths
within a network, and each of these paths may validly explain the
observed changes of concentration. In this context, the extraction
of subgraphs appears to be more relevant than the extraction of
subtrees. The number of alternative paths between two metabol-
ites may, however, be large and restricting the search to all
the shortest or lightest (the weight is given by the sum of the
out-degrees of the vertices in the path) paths between pairs of
metabolites seems to be a realistic compromise.

This is the approach followed by (Croes et al., 2006; Faust
et al., 2010; van Helden et al., 2002) where the authors concen-
trate on a pair of discriminating compounds and search for sub-
graphs corresponding to source-to—sink paths between them. In
Antonov et a]. (2009), this approach is pushed one step further as
the authors consider all pairs of metabolites and unify all the
shortest paths, this time with a maximum length k. In practice,
this may lead to large networks (if k is too big) or to disconnected
ones (if k is too small).

The aforementioned methods are based only on the topology of
the network, but one could consider different approaches based
on ﬂux distributions over the set of reactions, such as elementary
modes (Schuster and Hilgetag, 1994; Schuster et al., 1999) that are
minimal subnetworks working at steady state. One difﬁculty in
this case is that ﬂux-based models need stoichiometric values as
well as a deﬁnition of the boundaries of the system under analysis,
which are not always simple to identify, particularly in the case of
a metabolomics experiment in which the list of discriminating
compounds does not directly deﬁne such boundaries. Moreover,
ﬁux approaches are focused on reactions and are not designed to
take into account endogenous metabolite concentrations. The
very same metabolites may play different roles in different meta-
bolic processes, being source in one, intermediate in a second and
target in a third one. The inability and the unwillingness to tell, a
priori, the role of the discriminating compounds in each scenario
to be proposed is a key factor of our approach: we are interested
not only in connecting the discriminating compounds but also in
establishing their individual role for each scenario.

Our approach is a subgraph extraction technique in which we
want to ﬁnd maximal directed acyclic subgraphs (DAGs) whose
set of sources and targets are discriminating compounds. We call

such subgraphs metabolic stories, or for short, simply stories. In
practice, for a given set of discriminating compounds, the
number of stories may be large. Because we do not have a
clear criterion for choosing which of these stories is the most
relevant, we ﬁrst aim at enumerating them all. In a second
step, we discuss ways to rank them based on how the concentra-
tion of the discriminating compounds is observed to vary in the
experiment. This procedure allows a good ﬁlter of the solutions,
selecting stories that best ﬁt the experimental data.

2 MODELS

2.1 Modeling metabolic stories

In this section, we introduce the notion of story and give a
rationale for its deﬁnition. Brieﬂy, stories are subgraphs that
summarize the ﬂow of matter from a set of source metabolites
to a set of target metabolites. The candidates to be the endpoints
(sources or targets) of a story should belong to the set of
discriminating compounds. To guarantee that stories will have
at least one source and one target, we introduce the acyclicity
constraint. These two combined constraints lead us to search for
DAGs with sources and targets contained in the given set of
discriminating compounds. Then, because there can be several
paths connecting two discriminating compounds and we want
the story to contain all these alternative paths, we impose a con-
straint of maximality, that is, we search for maximal DAGs, in
the sense that alternative pathways between all the nodes should
be included, if their addition does not create cycles. In other
words, a DAG is maximal if by adding any are makes it not a
DAG anymore, meaning that it contains at least one cycle.

Our goal is to have an algorithm that enumerates all stories,
i.e. to provide all possible scenarios that explain the observed
transformations. Because our focus is on the relation between
discriminating compounds, we use a representation of metabolic
networks focused on metabolites, the so-called compound net-
work (Lacroix et al., 2008), that is a directed graph in which
vertices are compounds and there is an are from a compound
to another compound if there is a reaction that consumes the ﬁrst
to produce the second.

More formally, we introduce a constrained version of the prob-
lem of enumerating all maximal DAGs of a graph G
(Schwikowski and Speckenmeyer, 2002). Let G = ([B U W, E) be
a directed graph such that [B CW 2 0. We write V: [B UW.
Nodes in [B are said to be black nodes and correspond to the
discriminating compounds, whereas those in W are said to be
white nodes. Let d+(u) and d_(u) denote, respectively, the in-
degree and the out-degree of a node u. Node u is called a source
ifd+(u) = 0 and a" (u) > 0 and a target ifd‘ (u) = 0 and d+(u) > 0.

A metabolic story of G is a maximal acyclic subgraph
G’ = ([B UW’,E’) of G with W’ g W and E’ g E and such
that, for each node w e W’, w is neither a source nor a target
red in G’. Maximality means that it is not possible to add other
arcs or nodes without creating cycles, or white sources or targets.
We denote by 2(G) the set of stories of G.

2.2 Enumerating metabolic stories

A ﬁrst step of our algorithm to enumerate 2(G) is to apply
compression operations on the input graph obtaining a more

compact representation, which is equivalent in terms of story
sets. The operations are (i) white source and target removal
that consists in removing iteratively white nodes that are either
sources or targets, as such nodes cannot appear in any story;
(ii) self-loop removal that consists in removing all arcs of the
form (it, it): because stories are acyclic, such arcs do not appear
in any story; (iii) forward and backward bottleneck removal, that
consists in removing a white node v whose out-degree (respect-
ively, in-degree) is equal to l, and directly connecting any pre-
decessor (respectively, successor) of v to the unique successor
(respectively predecessor) of v (without creating multiarcs). Our
preprocessing algorithm consists in applying operations (i), (ii)
and (iii) successively until no more white sources and targets,
self-loops and bottlenecks are present in the graph. We call the
resulting graph a compressed network.

In (Acuna et al., 2012), we proposed a ﬁrst method to enu-
merate stories based on a polynomial-time algorithm to compute
one story. This is brieﬂy recalled in Supplementary Material S1.
More recently we developed a much faster enumerator for stories
based on a linear-time enumeration algorithm for non-maximal
stories (Borassi et al., 2013) that allows us to explore the whole
set of solutions even for genome-scale metabolic networks. This
is the enumerator algorithm we use here.

2.3 Scoring function

From a formal point of view, there is no qualitative difference
between any two stories. In this sense, whether a given discrimi-
nating compound is a source, an intermediate node or a target in
a story is indifferent for the enumeration process, as all possible
scenarios satisfying the three properties given by the deﬁnition,
namely, maximality of paths, acyclicity and source/target con-
straint, have to be computed.

However, in practice, the number of stories can be large and
being able to rank them greatly facilitates their analysis. To do
this, we propose the following score function:

S(S) = Z (006) X My) >< wavy),

xMyES

where the score s(S) of a story S is the sum, for each black
transformation xvy, of the product of the node weights a)(x)
and a)(y) of the nodes x and y, times the path weight a)(x My).
A black transformation is deﬁned as an are or a simple white
path between two black nodes. A simple white path is a simple
path (i.e. containing no cycles) composed of only white nodes
between two black ones. The values assigned to the node and
path weights will depend on the data available and are thus
perfectly suited for the integration of various omics data. For
our analysis, we used the topology of the stories and additional
data from the metabolomics experiments as described in more
detail in the Section 3 (see Table 2).

2.4 Yeast metabolic network

For the analysis of the metabolics experiment (Madalinski et al.,
2008), we used the metabolic reconstruction of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae s288c available in MetExplore (Cottret et al., 2010)
(the metabolic model was built based on the YeastCyc database).
The procedure followed is brieﬂy described in Supplementary
Material S2.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Metabolic stories to analyze metabolomics data

To illustrate how to use our method, we concentrate on the study
of the exposition of S.cerevisiae to the toxic cadmium (Cam)
reported in Madalinski et al. (2008). A widely studied metabolic
pathway in S.cerevisiae is the one responsible for glutathione
biosynthesis, as it is related to the detoxiﬁcation process of the
cell when exposed to high concentrations of cadmium (Fauchon
et al., 2002; Lafaye et al., 2005; Madalinski et al., 2008). Previous
studies demonstrated that the presence of such a metal in the
environment has a huge impact in terms of gene expression and
metabolism, showing that there is a strong response both at the
metabolomic and proteomic levels. Basically, glutathione needs
to be produced because it is a thiol metabolite linked to the
detoxiﬁcation of cadmium through a process called chelation
(Li et al., 1997). Plants are the natural biotope of S.cerevisiae
and it is known that they are able to tolerate cadmium and other
metals up to 1% of their dry weight, which is believed to provide
defense against herbivores and pathogenic microorganisms
(Fauchon et al., 2002). This exposition to cadmium in natural
conditions provides a reason for yeast to keep a detoxiﬁcation
pathway. However, the biosynthesis of glutathione requires high
quantities of sulfur. To save sulfur, there is a replacement of
abundant sulfur-rich proteins related to other metabolic pro-
cesses by sulfur-depleted isozymes (i.e. other enzymes that have
the same function). Such is the case for the enzymes pyruvate
decarboxylase (Pdclp), enolase (Eno2p) and aldehyde dehydro-
genase (A1d6p) that are replaced by isozymes containing less
sulfur amino acids (i.e. methionine and cysteine) that are mobi-
lized in the glutathione pathway and are less available for protein
synthesis (Fauchon et al., 2002). This response affects a large
portion of the metabolic network and represents the mechanism
used by the cell to survive under this speciﬁc stress condition.
Sulfur limitation conditions slow down the growth rate but do
not induce this same sulfur-sparing response (Fauchon et al.,
2002). A schema of the known glutathione biosynthesis meta-
bolic pathway is presented in Figure l.

The metabolic network used for this analysis (see the Section 2
for a description) contains 600 metabolites and 949 arcs.

whose concentration signiﬁcantly changed after cadmium expos-
ure, shown in the table given in Supplementary Material S3.

It is important to notice here that identiﬁcation of the metab-
olites that have changed their concentration is based on a min-
imum of two orthogonal criteria relative to an authentic
compound analyzed under identical experimental conditions:
retention time and mass spectrum or retention time and 1H
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, accurate mass and
tandem mass spectra or accurate mass and related isotopic clus-
ters or 1H and/or 13C NMR with 2D NMR spectrum (Sumner
et al., 2007). However, many metabolites are not commercially
available and many of them may require tedious and expensive
chemical synthesis, which often hampers their deﬁnitive metab-
olite identiﬁcation. Thus, such compounds remain putatively
annotated or characterized.

We decided to perform two analyses to explore the effect of
cadmium exposure on S.cerevisiae cells. We ﬁrst enumerated
metabolic stories using a set of black nodes restricted to the
measured metabolites that are known to participate to the bio-
synthesis of glutathione. The idea is to check whether our
method is able to recover one or more stories that correspond
to the known metabolic pathway. In a second step, we enumer-
ated metabolic stories using the entire list of 24 discriminating
compounds identiﬁed in the metabolomics experiments. In this
case, the goal is to analyze both the response of glutathione
biosynthesis, but also the potential response of other pathways
and the side effects of these responses in the rest of the network.

3.2 First analysis: local response to cadmium exposure,
biosynthetic pathway of glutathione

We ﬁrst consider the aforementioned metabolic pathway directly
involved in cadmium detoxiﬁcation, namely, the glutathione
biosynthetic pathway, to enumerate stories and check whether
we are able to recover one that ﬁts our current knowledge of the
biological process. We thus selected as black nodes for this ﬁrst
analysis only the metabolites that were measured in the experi-
ment (Madalinski et al., 2008) and that are also known to par-
ticipate in the glutathione biosynthetic pathway (Fauchon et al.,
2002). These eight compounds are presented in the table given in
Supplementary Material S3 with the third column marked as
‘yes’: glutathione, O—acetylhomoserine, methionine, glutamate,
glutamylcysteine, serine, glycine and cystathionine.

3.2.1. Compressed network A ﬁrst practical result that follows
directly from the properties of our deﬁnition of stories is the com-
pressed representation of the subnetwork in which all interactions
between the discriminating compounds are captured. The com-
pression is obtained in two steps. In the ﬁrst step, we extract all
biologically relevant routes between the black nodes. In our case,
we computed lightest paths between black nodes using the out-
degree of a node as its weight, which has been defended as being
more biologically sound than a simple shortest-path approach
(Blum and Kohlbacher, 2008). The second step is to apply the
four compression rules that were previously described brieﬂy (see
Section 2) and that are fully detailed in Acuna et al. (2012).

The compressed network obtained for the reduced set of black
nodes contains 10 nodes and 25 arcs, i.e. represents >98% of
compression in terms of nodes and >97% in terms of arcs with
respect to the original input size of the S.cerevisiae metabolic

Fig. 2. The compressed network computed considering as black nodes
the eight compounds of the table in Supplementary Material S3 marked
as present in the glutathione biosynthetic pathway. Green nodes are the
ones whose concentration signiﬁcantly increased in the presence of cad-
mium, whereas the red are the ones whose concentration signiﬁcantly
decreased. The diameter of the nodes is proportional to the concentration
change. Solid arcs represent single reactions connecting the two com-
pounds, whereas dashed ones correspond to a chain of at least two
reactions

network. The resulting compressed network is shown in
Figure 2. This compression ratio is spectacular, as it is now
much easier to visually inspect the network in which we can
highlight the metabolites of interest. This type of visualization
is, therefore, already a result in itself, which can readily be used
to start proposing causal explanations for the changes of metab-
olite concentrations. To facilitate this, we further enrich this
representation with the information on the direction of the
change of concentration (whether the metabolite concentration
increased or decreased) and the intensity of this change. Of the 8
metabolites considered, 3 had a signiﬁcant increase of their con-
centration (reduced glutathione, cystathionine and glutamylcys-
teine), whereas the other 5 had a signiﬁcant decrease of their
concentration (methionine, O—acetylhomoserine, glutamate,
serine and glycine). From now on, we will denote the ﬁrst set
as green nodes and the second set as red nodes. The other nodes,
whose concentration did not change signiﬁcantly, will remain
identiﬁed as white nodes. We notice that this distinction between
red and green nodes is only possible for applications where two
conditions are compared. This is the case we consider in this
article. When more than two conditions are compared, our meth-
odology still applies, keeping the terminology of black and white
nodes. We can produce the compressed network and enumerate
the stories. The ranking scheme described later would, however,
need to be adapted. Finally, during the preprocessing of the
network, some paths are compressed into a single arc. To distin-
guish between reactions linking two compounds and these com-
pressed paths, we used solid 1ines for the former and dashed lines
for the latter. Importantly, the compression of the network is
lossless as it is easily reversible, for instance if we need to have
access to the full path of white nodes that indirectly link two
black nodes. Interestingly, in practice, although most white
nodes can be compressed, some remain. Their compression
would prevent us from being able to enumerate the full set of
stories. These compounds, although not detected as discriminat-
ing, seem to also play an important role in the studied process as

Telling metabolic stories to explore metabolomics data

 

they are at the crossroads between at least two possible routes
between discriminating compounds.

3.2.2. Enumerating and scoring the stories The compressed
network is already a result per se, but its visual inspection
remains difﬁcult; the many cycles it contains allow for a reading
of the ﬂow of matter in many possible directions, thereby sug-
gesting several possible causal scenarios. Therefore, we go one
step further in the analysis and enumerate the metabolic stories.
In this analysis, there are a total of 222 stories.

With the aim of classifying the set of computed stories, we
have to deﬁne how to assign values to the node and are weights
needed by our score function scheme (see Section 2).

There are basically four kinds of interactions that may be
observed in a metabolic story (see Table 1). In the following
proposal for causal interpretation of each type of arc, we will
make the simplifying assumption that each arc is independent
from the other ones. In this context, an are linking a red node to
a green node will correspond to the consumption of the red node
to the beneﬁt of the green node. If we focus solely on this arc, this
can only be explained by an activation of the enzyme catalyzing
the reaction linking the two nodes. On the other hand, an are
linking a green node to a red node can be interpreted as the
inhibition of the enzyme catalyzing the reaction linking the two
nodes. Finally, an are linking two red nodes can be explained
by a domino effect. The simple fact that the substrate concentra-
tion decreases causes the product concentration to decrease.
This domino effect does not require any enzyme change. It just
corresponds to a change in concentration that propagates. The
case of green to green arcs can be explained by a similar effect.
We additionally need to assume that the enzyme is not present in
a limiting amount.

We remind that in this section, our approach is local and
focuses on single transformations. We always favor the most
parsimonious explanation (the one with fewest enzyme changes),
but, in practice, other plausible explanations could be proposed

Table 2. Weights for different score functions of a story

for each arc. Importantly, the notion of enzyme activation
or inhibition as used in this article should be understood in a
general sense as it captures allosteric regulation of the enzyme
or transcriptional regulation of the gene(s) encoding the enzyme.
In the application considered here, the time separating the
measurements (before and after exposure to cadmium) is large
enough to allow to interpret enzyme activations as a change
in their concentration through a transcriptional response. Our
methodology also applies when the time separating the measure-
ments is shorter. In the following, we propose three ranking
schemes for stories. In each of them we favor one type of arc,
which means that we look for the stories with a large number of
arcs of this type. Even if the individual explanation of each arc is
not necessarily correct, the overall optimization of the total
number of each arc type makes intuitive sense, and we show
that in practice it enables to explore efﬁciently the space of all
stories.

3.2.3 Three scoring schemes Let us start by deﬁning the arc
weights that are restricted to being —1, 0 or +1. The ﬁrst scoring
scheme privileges stories where green nodes are preferentially
targets in the story (i.e. are produced) and, on the other hand,
red nodes are preferentially sources in the story (i.e. are con-
sumed). Let us call this score function enzyme-activation—ﬁrst,
as it should privilege arcs from red to green nodes and penalize
the inverse as shown in Table 2a. Another possibility is to classify
ﬁrst stories in which the concentration change responses are
privileged as shown in Table 2b. Let us call this score function
concentration-change—ﬁrst, as it should privilege arcs from red to
red nodes or green to green nodes. Finally, we may deﬁne a score
function in which we privilege arcs going from green nodes to red
nodes; in such a case these arcs represent enzyme inhibition,
as shown in Table 20. Let us call this score function enzyme-
inhibition-ﬁrst.

Once an arc weighting scheme has been chosen, we deﬁne the
node weights. For our experiments, we deﬁne the value a)(x)
for a given node x as its normalized intensity ratio, which is its
intensity ratio divided by the maximum intensity ratio observed
in the experiment (if v is a green node) or the minimum intensity
ratio observed in the experiment divided by the intensity ratio of
the node (if v is a red node). An example is given in the ﬁgure in
Supplementary Material S4.

stories previously computed and identify the top scoring stories
for each one of the three functions. Figure 3a shows one of the
six optimal stories according to the enzyme-activation—ﬁrst
scheme, Figure 3b shows the single optimal story according to
the concentration—change—ﬁrst scheme and Figure 3c shows one
of the two optimal stories found according to the enzyme inhib-
ition ﬁrst scheme. The goal of this ﬁrst analysis is to try to iden-
tify stories that could correspond to the current knowledge on
the response of yeast to cadmium exposure, i.e. a story that
corresponds to the glutathione biosynthetic pathway previously
presented in Figure 1. Among the top scored stories, the one
given by the enzyme-activation—ﬁrst score function (see
Figure 3a) agrees well with the current knowledge of yeast re-
sponse to cadmium. The discussion in Madalinski et al. (2008)
presents as a result a ﬂux corresponding to the detoxiﬁcation of
cadmium by glutathione, explaining that the levels of metabolites
involved in the glutathione biosynthesis pathway (homocysteine,
cystathionine, glutamyl-cysteine and glutathione itself) were
increased following cadmium exposure, which is the same ﬂow
of matter preserved in the story shown in Figure 3a. The story
selected by the concentration—change—ﬁrst score function, shown
in Figure 3b, preferentially preserves arcs between two nodes of a
same color. The idea is that an increase (or a decrease) of con-
centration of a given metabolite could be a side effect of the
increase (or decrease) of another one. The goal is to minimize
the number of arcs that suggest some enzyme activity change, i.e.
arcs that involve red and green nodes. Interestingly, the story
that scores best with this ranking scheme does not ﬁt with the
current knowledge of the response to cadmium exposure. This
means that, in principle, there exists a scenario that uses fewer
red to green or green to red arcs than the true response (and
therefore fewer enzyme changes), but this scenario is not the

Fig. 3. The best stories generated for our analysis taking into account
only the metabolites known to be present in the glutathione biosynthesis
and whose concentration signiﬁcantly changed after cadmium exposure.
Green nodes are the ones whose concentration signiﬁcantly increased in
the presence of cadmium, whereas the red nodes are the ones whose
concentration signiﬁcantly decreased. The diameter of the nodes is pro-
portional to the concentration change. Solid arcs represent single reac-
tions connecting the two compounds, whereas dashed ones correspond to
a chain of at least two reactions

one taken in practice. There can be a number of reasons why
this optimal scenario is not taken. Although any enzyme can, in
principle, be activated or inhibited, in practice, some have more
degrees of freedom. In addition, some reactions annotated
as reversible in general, happen to have one clearly favored
direction in speciﬁc conditions. Finally, the story presented in
Figure 3c preferentially preserves green to red arcs that could
represent an enzyme inhibition. Again, this scenario does not
ﬁt with the current knowledge on yeast response to cadmium,
which indicates that the response is probably not based mostly
on enzyme inhibition.

3.2.5 Anthologies In Figure 3a, a story with score 1.252 for the
enzyme-activation—ﬁrst score function is presented. However,
there are other ﬁve stories that achieved the same score.
These tied optimal stories may be combined into a single graph
representation to ease the analysis of their differences as
presented in Figure 4. A unique graph representing the union
of several different stories is called an anthology. Notice that
differently from stories, which are maximal DAGs, an anthology
contains at least one cycle. The sources and targets (sinks) of an
anthology (if any remains) are, however, black nodes only, as
with stories. In this case, the equivalent stories are due to the fact
that serine, glycine and oxalacetic acid are all interconnected by
reversible paths.

3.3 Second analysis: global response to cadmium exposure

For the second analysis, we decided to explore the global
response to cadmium exposure and we considered all 24
discriminating compounds. One of them, pyroline—hydroxy—
carboxylate, was eliminated when computing the lightest paths

ones whose concentration signiﬁcantly increased in the presence of cad-
mium, whereas the red are the ones whose concentration signiﬁcantly
decreased. The diameter of the nodes is proportional to the magnitude
of the concentration change as measured by the intensity ratio of
the compound. Solid arcs represent single reactions connecting the two
compounds, whereas dashed ones correspond to a chain of at least two
reactions

Fig. 5. The compressed network computed for the whole list of
discriminating compounds of the table in Supplementary Material 3
and the metabolic network of the yeast strain s288c. Green nodes are
the ones whose concentration signiﬁcantly increased in the presence of
cadmium, whereas the red are the ones whose concentration signiﬁcantly
decreased. The diameter of the nodes is proportional to the concentration
change. Solid arcs represent single reactions connecting the two

compounds, whereas dashed ones correspond to a chain of at least two
reactions

between all pairs of black nodes, as it was part of a small dis-
connected component of the original input graph, most probably
due to missing information in the metabolic network reconstruc-
tion as the metabolite was present in the metabolome of the
strain. The computed compressed network contains 34 nodes
and 76 arcs, i.e. a compression of 94% in terms of nodes and
92% in terms of arcs. The resulting compressed network is
shown in Figure 5. Again, this compressed network is already
a result per se as it enables to visualize jointly all the possible
ways of explaining the ﬂow of matter through the network.
However, in this case again, and probably even more than
before, the readability is complicated, and we, therefore, go
one step further and compute all stories.

This time, the number of stories is much larger: there
are 3 934160 in total. In fact, this exact number could only be
obtained with the recent improvement we proposed in Borassi
et al. (2013). Before that, the computation would not end in
reasonable time and we only had an approximate number. In
our initial analysis, the score function that selected a story that
best ﬁtted the targeted known metabolic pathway of the gluta-
thione biosynthesis was the enzyme-activation—ﬁrst scoring
scheme. For this reason, we used it also to analyze the larger
dataset produced in this second analysis, obtaining 20 maximal
stories presented as an anthology in Figure 6. Considering all the
metabolites that were measured in the experiment as black nodes
in our method allows us to have a more global view of the
organism’s response to cadmium exposure. This enables to
explore whether the other identiﬁed paths, apart from the ones
involved in the glutathione pathway, are part of this response or
simply side effects of the sulfur redirection, as further discussed
in the next section.

Fig. 6. Anthology corresponding to the 20 stories with the maximal score
computed for the experiment on yeast s288c exposed to cadmium. Red
nodes correspond to metabolites whose concentration decreased and
green nodes to those whose concentration increased in the metabolomics
experiment. White nodes have their concentration unchanged or it could
not be measured. The diameter of the nodes is proportional to the con-
centration change. Solid arcs represent single reactions connecting the
two compounds, whereas dashed ones correspond to a chain of at least
two reactions. The arc’s thickness represents the frequency of the arc in
the stories making up the anthology, whereas gray arcs correspond to
reactions known to be part of the response to cadmium

(Borassi et al., 2013). For visualization and analytical purposes,
we used Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003), which is a software for
network visualization, enriched with a plug-in we developed to
enable loading, visualizing and inspecting the three aforemen-
tioned objects (compressed networks, stories, anthologies)
inside Cytoscape. The plug-in applies the given visual properties
corresponding to a metabolomics experiment (e.g. colour and
diameter of the nodes, the thickness of an arc corresponding to
the frequency of the arc in the stories composing the anthology)
and allows a zoom-in in the dashed arcs, exhibiting the paths
connecting the two nodes. Both Touche and the Cytoscape plug-
in are available on demand.

4 DISCUSSION

Focusing speciﬁcally on the biological application presented in
the previous section, we may see that exploring the topological
properties of the stories through the preprocessing of the input

network creates a compressed network that captures all the
relationships between the discriminating compounds in a much
smaller graph than the whole network. This already allows a
visual inspection of the observed variations, which is rather dif-
ﬁcult, if not impossible, in the entire network. On the other hand,
one may easily highlight in a whole metabolic pathway map
those metabolites whose concentration were detected as having
changed using the YeastCyc database. However, because the
pathways are presented as disconnected, it is not possible to
follow a path that traverses several pathways (see Figure in
Supplementary Material S5). To demonstrate the utility of our
approach, we used data from Madalinski et al. (2008) in which
the authors monitor changes in metabolite concentration as a
response of the yeast S.cerevisiae to cadmium, a toxic chemical.
The aim of this study is to analyze the global response of an
organism to a stress. Using only the metabolomics experiment
data to choose the discriminating compounds and to rank the
stories, we are able to obtain stories that correspond well to the
current biological understanding of the system under study, as
well as to propose new alternatives that could serve as a basis for
further experimental validations. Because regulatory information
and quantitative information are not needed by the method, this
allows it to be used for metabolic network reconstructions even
when they are not well reﬁned and where these additional infor-
mations may be unavailable or incomplete.

The method herein presented allows visual inspection of a set
of discriminating compounds (either local or broader) from
metabolomics data in the compressed network, stories and/or
anthology with no a priori selected pathways. The metabolic
stories may be ranked in different ways depending on which
interpretation one wishes to emphasize for the causal link
between two affected metabolites: enzyme activation, enzyme
inhibition or domino effect on the concentration changes of sub-
strates and products. Equally probable stories under any selected
ranking scheme can be further grouped into a single anthology
that summarizes in a single subnetwork all equivalently plausible
alternative stories.

4.1 First analysis: local response to cadmium exposure

The ﬁrst analysis performed aimed at locally inspecting the yeast
response to cadmium exposure limited to the biosynthetic path-
way of glutathione, given in Figure 1. Of the 222 stories found,
the ones favoring enzyme activation were clearly closer to our
current understanding of this response, where an increased
sulfur ﬂux passes through homocysteine, cystathionine, cysteine
and glutamyl-cysteine to yield high levels of glutathione
(Madalinski et al., 2008). This same ﬂow of matter is captured
in the anthology combining the six best stories under this scoring
scheme, shown in Figure 4.

Interestingly, we show that there exists one scenario that, in
principle, uses fewer enzymes to explain the observed changes in
concentration. This is the scenario that favors concentration
changes, shown in Figure 5b. However, this scenario does not
match the current knowledge of the main pathway of yeast
response to cadmium. In fact, it even uses some reactions in the
opposite direction. Because these reactions are annotated as
reversible, they can be taken in both directions, at least in theory,
and this explains that we found these alternative stories. Those are

scenarios that are a priori possible. They are not necessarily
‘chosen’ in practice, possibly because the reactions are only
reversible under some conditions that are not met in this experi-
ment. Unfortunately, the precise conditions under which a reac-
tion is reversible are in general not well known. The addition
of such knowledge would for sure enable to reduce substantially
the number of stories we output, as a large part of the combina-
torial explosion we observe comes from these ‘cycles’. Conversely,
understanding why some possible scenarios are not taken in prac-
tice could help to better annotate the reversibility of reactions.

From the list of discriminating compounds identiﬁed in
Madalinski et al. (2008), the ones that are involved in the gluta-
thione biosynthetic pathway (as shown in bold in Fig. l) are as
follows: O-acetylhomoserine, methionine, serine, cystathionine,
glutamate, y—glutamyl—cysteine, glycine and glutathione. All of
them are present in the compressed networks, stories and
anthologies herein presented (Figs 2—6). As concerns cysteine
and homocysteine, they were either not measured or not discri-
minating in Madalinski et al. (2008), thus in our analysis they
appear as white nodes and may be compressed inside an arc
(dashed arcs in Figs 2—6). Cysteine is included in the dashed
are linking cystathionine and L—gamma—glutamyl—cysteine that
is its expected place based on the biosynthetic pathway of gluta-
thione. Homocysteine is represented as a white node in all ﬁg-
ures. Because it is at a crossroads between three black nodes
(cystathione, methionine and O—acetylhomoserine), it could not
be compressed.

Interestingly, the compounds involved in the methyl cycle,
which is a sulfur salvage pathway (see Fig. l), were not recovered
in the highest score stories found in our ﬁrst analysis. The reason
is that the lightest path found between methionine and
cystathione in that analysis passed through the reaction catalyzed
by the enzyme homocysteine S—methyltransferase (Mhtl), which
is assigned as reversible in the YeastCyc database (Caspi et al.,
2010) and in our data. This enzyme was described as recycling
S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to methionine (Thomas et al.,
2000).

4.2 Second analysis: global response to cadmium exposure

This more local view of the behavior of the metabolic network of
yeast in this stress condition may be contrasted with the second
analysis, where the whole list of discriminating compounds was
considered. The anthology combining the 20 best stories under
the scoring scheme favoring enzyme activation is presented in
Figure 6, where the reactions corresponding to the glutathione
biosynthesis are highlighted in gray. This is a strong point of our
method, as it allows exploring alternative but close scenarios
through the analysis of these (and possibly other) stories
altogether, which might provide new insights on the underlying
processes that took place under the given conditions.

Among the 35 nodes presented in this anthology, eight have
sulfur in their chemical structure: AdoMet, y—glutamylcysteine,
5-methy1thioadenosine (MTA), O-acetyl-L-homoserine, cystei-
nylglycine, glutathione, cystathionine and L-methionine.
Among these sulfured metabolites, the only one that is not
involved in the glutathione biosynthesis is MTA, which is instead
involved in the MTA cycle, a sulfur salvage pathway (Thomas
and Surdin—Kerjan, 1997). This recycles AdoMet to methionine

Telling metabolic stories to explore metabolomics data

 

through a chain of reactions, whereas Mhtl (mentioned earlier in
the text) can also perform it in one step, which is important for
controlling the intracellular ratio between these two metabolites
(Thomas et al., 2000) Although there is a redirection of sulfur
ﬂux to glutathione biosynthesis after cadmium exposure, the
levels of MTA increased as well as those of arginine, which is
a precursor for MTA. The metabolites in the methyl cycle are
recovered, with the white nodes AdoMet and homocysteine pre-
sent in the anthology and the metabolite S-adenosyl—homocyst—
eine compressed into the are between them. We have previously
tried to link arginine to sulfur metabolism by emphasizing that it
is a precursor of spermidine, a polyamine metabolite that is itself
involved in the biosynthesis of MTA, a metabolite associated
with the methyl cycle and whose levels are increased after cad-
mium exposure (Madalinski et al., 2008). However, experimental
data lacked to support this assumption. By using the metabolic
stories based approach, the increased levels of arginine are linked
to decreased concentrations of citrulline, which has not been
formally identiﬁed in our experimental conditions, and which
is itself linked to glutamate. Besides, citrulline was identiﬁed as
a discriminating compound in Madalinski et al. (2008), but was
only indicated as putative, requiring more analysis for ﬁnal iden-
tiﬁcation. Our results seem to conﬁrm that citrulline was cor-
rectly identiﬁed. This emphasizes the relevance of using this kind
of approach to generate biological hypotheses that have to be
further investigated by biologists. Of note, such a link between
arginine and sulfur metabolism has been noticed in other organ-
isms (Sekowska et al., 2001) and links between nitric oxide and
polyamines have been established with cadmium toxicity in
wheat roots (Groppa et al., 2008). Furthermore, this global
view of the discriminating compounds links the sulfur metabol-
ism to non-sulfur amino acids and other metabolites through
intermediates of the central metabolism. The amino acids that
are precursors to the glutathione synthesis have their levels
reduced as expected, whereas most of the others increased.
This agrees with the fact that global protein synthesis rapidly
drops after cadmium exposure (Lafaye et al., 2005), reducing
the consumption of amino acids not directly connected to gluta-
thione synthesis.

4.3 Perspectives

We presented a generic method that enables to analyze metabo-
lomics data. This method requires simple input and can be
applied to a wide variety of situations. Clearly, the results of
the method can be improved with the addition of other types
of data. For instance, the use of carbon tracing experiments
could help in focusing directly on the stories that are involved
in the response to the stress condition, instead of considering the
set of all possible stories. Besides, we assumed that the set of
discriminating compounds did not need to be questioned.
However, these are predicted based on the analysis of peaks in
a spectrum. We remark that extracting such information is in
itself a bioinformatics challenge. Therefore, a possible extension
of the method could be to take into account noisy data, i.e. to
deal with a level of conﬁdence for the roles of discriminating
compounds and non-discriminating compounds. From the mod-
eling point of view, we enforce that each story corresponds to a
ﬂow of matter by the acyclicity constraint. We could relax this

constraint by allowing internal cycles, and therefore computing,
for each combination of sources and targets, a single story. This
will lead to a completely different model and is beyond the scope
of this article.

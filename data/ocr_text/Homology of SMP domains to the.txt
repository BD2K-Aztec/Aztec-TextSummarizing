ABSTRACT

Mitochondria must uptake some phospholipids from the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for the biogenesis of their membranes.
They convert one of these lipids, phosphatidylserine, to
phosphatidylethanolamine, which can be re-exported via the ER
to all other cellular membranes. The mechanisms underlying these
exchanges between ER and mitochondria are poorly understood.
Recently, a complex termed ER—mitochondria encounter structure
(ERMES) was shown to be necessary for phospholipid exchange in
budding yeast. However, it is unclear whether this complex is merely
an inter-organelle tether or also the transporter. ERMES consists
of four proteins: Mdm10, Mdm34 (Mmm2), Mdm12 and Mmm1,
three of which contain the uncharacterized SMP domain common
to a number of eukaryotic membrane-associated proteins. Here, we
show that the SMP domain belongs to the TULIP superfamily of
lipid/hydrophobic ligand-binding domains comprising members of
known structure. This relationship suggests that the SMP domains
of the ERMES complex mediate lipid exchange between ER and
mitochondria.

1 INTRODUCTION

Mitochondria are organelles of endosymbiotic origin, found in
virtually all eukaryotic organisms. They are the main generators
of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—the energy currency of the cell.
Additionally, they participate in a series of other important processes,
including apoptosis, amino acid and lipid metabolism, iron—sulphur
cluster assembly and the regulation of calcium levels within the cell
(Lill and Kispal, 2000; McBride et al., 2006). However, only a small
fraction of the biopolymers required to carry out these functions
is synthesized in the mitochondria, the rest must be imported
from the outside. For example, they only produce some of the
phospholipids that make up their membranes, whereas the remainder
originates from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Interestingly,
mitochondria not only import phospholipids but also export a
particular one, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), to the ER, where

it is methylated to form the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine
(Voelker, 2003). Mitochondria synthesize PtdEtn by decarboxylating
phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid imported from the ER. The
mechanisms responsible for the inﬂux and efﬂux of phospholipids
are unclear.

Unlike most organelles, mitochondria do not exchange
phospholipids via vesicular transport. Previous studies have
suggested that this exchange takes place via ER—mitochondria
associations (Achleitner et al., 1999; Voelker, 2003). More recently,
Kornmann et al. (2009) identiﬁed a complex, the ER—mitochondria
encounter structure (ERMES), that acts as a molecular tether
between ER and mitochondria in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
is required for efﬁcient inter—organelle phospholipid exchange.
However, it remained unclear whether ERMES merely tethers these
organelles together, thereby aligning proteins that carry out the
actual transport, or also recruits and transfers phospholipids itself.

ERMES comprises four proteins (Fig. 1): the mitochondrial
outer membrane protein Mdm10, the putative outer membrane
protein Mdm34 (Mmm2), the ER—resident Mmml and the cytosolic
Mdm12 (Kornmann et al., 2009). These proteins have also been
implicated in other mitochondrial functions, including morphology
maintenance (Okamoto and Shaw, 2005) and protein import
(Meisinger et al., 2004). Two of the ERMES components,
Mmml and Mdm12, were reported to contain the uncharacterized
SMP domain (synaptotagmin—like, mitochondrial and lipid—binding
proteins), which is also present in a number of other eukaryotic
membrane—associated proteins (Lee and Hong, 2006). SMP domain—
containing proteins have been classiﬁed into four broad groups:
C2 domain synaptotagmin—like, PH domain—containing HT—008,
PDZK8 and mitochondrial protein families (Lee and Hong, 2006).
The functions of these proteins are poorly understood.

Fig. 2. Pairwise HMM comparison of SMP and TULIP domains. Representatives of the four SMP domain—containing groups and of TULIP domains were
chosen from Arabidopsis thaliana (At), Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce), Drosophila melanogaster (Dm), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp), Epiphyas
postvittcma (Ep), Galleria mellonella (Gm), Homo sapiens (Hs) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc). Group and protein names of these representatives, along
with domain boundaries and names of source species are indicated (from left to right). HHpred was used to perform pairwise HMM comparisons between
them. Cell color indicates the HHpred probability of the match as depicted in the scale on the right; probabilities <20% are shown as white cells. Proteins
with known structures are marked with an asterisk. The abbreviations of the hydrophobic ligand binders are explained in the text.

In this study, we show that the SMP domain belongs to a
superfamily of lipid/hydrophobic ligand—binding domains of known
structure, which we call TULIP for t_ubular lipid—binding proteins,
and propose a role for it in cellular phospholEd trafﬁc.

2 METHODS

All sequence similarity searches were carried out in the MPI bioinfonnatics
toolkit (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de; Biegert et al., 2006) using HHpred
(deing et al., 2005) and HHsenser (deing et al., 2006) with default
settings. HHpred searches were performed against a database comprising
PDB70 (protein databank structures, as available on the 15th of April 2010,
clustered at 70% sequence identity) and genomes of phylogenetically diverse
organisms (Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila
melanogaster, Homo sapiens and S. cerevisiae ). Representatives of the four
SMP domain—containing groups from the aforementioned organisms were
chosen as seeds for the searches in Figures 2 and 3, based on their presence
in the core of their respective clusters in the sequence cluster map (Fig. 5).

To identify sequences for cluster analysis, we searched the non—redundant
protein sequence database (nr) at NCBI for homologs of the SMP domain
from the yeast protein Mmml (residues 196—409), the N—terminal domain
of human cholesteryl ester transfer protein (2OBD, residues 16—206), the
Takeout 1 protein from Epiphyas postvittana (3E8T), and the dust mite
allergen Der p 7 (3H4Z) using HHsenser. We pooled the permissive sets
returned by HHsenser to obtain 2033 sequences, which we clustered by their
pairwise BLAST P—values (Altschul et 01., 1990) in CLANS (Frickey and
Lupas, 2004). Clustering was done to equilibrium in 2D at a P—value cutoff
of e—4 using default settings.

for the 16 representative SMP sequences in Figure 2 were collected with
three of the top—scoring prediction servers in CASP8. Top matches to TULIP
domains are shown in blue and to any other structure in red. The color
saturation is scaled linearly between the maximum and minimum scores
returned by the respective method. The value ranges corresponding to pale

5, 5.1—2.6, 2.5—0, MUSTER Z—score 0—1.8, 1.9—3.5, 3.6—5.3. The number
of matches to TULIP domains against the total is shown in the right—hand
column.

at al., 2008; Krishna and Grishin, 2004; Salem et al., 1999), while
the combinatorial possibilities in sequence space are nearly endless.
For this reason, sequence similarity is considered the primary marker
of homology. We thus used sensitive sequence comparisons, as
implemented in HHpred, to ﬁnd homologs of the SMP domain in
a database concatenating several complete genomes with PDB70
(see ‘Methods’ section). The search was seeded with the SMP
domain from Mmml. The best hits were to other proteins that
have previously been described to contain this domain (Fig. 2).
In addition, we detected a hitherto unknown SMP domain in the
ERMES protein Mdm34. This protein has been reported as an

Homology of SMP domains to the TULIP superfamin

 

integral outer membrane protein (Youngman et al., 2004), but we
were unable to identify any sequence motifs in it that would indicate
membrane insertion. HHpred searches with other representatives
and reciprocal searches with Mdm34 conﬁrmed the presence of an
SMP domain, raising the number of SMP domains in ERMES to
three (Fig. 1).

We also found statistically signiﬁcant matches to many eukaryotic
proteins from the bactericidal/permeability—increasing protein—like
(BPI—like) family (Fig. 2), including two with known structures:
BPI (1EWF) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP; 2OBD).
Other members of this family are lipopolysaccharide—binding protein
(LPSBP), lipid—binding serum glycoprotein (LB SGP), phospholipid
transfer protein (PLTP) and long and short paralogs of palate,
lung and nasal epithelium carcinoma—associated protein (PLUNC).
Some of these proteins have been shown to bind lipids, e.g.
CETP facilitates lipid transport between different lipoproteins (Qiu
et al., 2007).

BPI and CETP have similar structures, each containing two
tandem domains that adopt the same fold, comprising a long a—helix
wrapped in a highly curved anti—parallel ,B—Sheet. All BPI—like
proteins contain these two domains, the only exception being short
PLUNC, which has only one. The domains show little sequence
identity (< 15%) and sequence comparisons do not yield signiﬁcant
matches between them. Instead, the C—terminal domain only shows
matches to the Ahal protein, a co—chaperone of Hsp90 in eukaryotes
which shares the same fold (1USU; d.83.2). Nevertheless, the N—
and C—terminal domains of BPI—like proteins are thought to have a
common ancestry based on their structural similarity (Kleiger et al.,
2000). The Structural Classiﬁcation of Proteins database (SCOP;
Murzin et al., 1995) also considers them to be homologous and
classiﬁes them into the same family (d.83.1.1).

HHpred searches with SMP domains yielded many statistically
signiﬁcant matches to the N—terminal domain of BPI—like proteins
(Fig. 2), but not to the C—terminal domain. We conﬁrmed these
ﬁndings with reciprocal searches using both domains of BPI—like
proteins. From the statistical signiﬁcance of these matches, we
conclude that SMP domains are homologous to BPI—like proteins
and therefore predict that they share the same tubular fold and
lipid—binding properties.

Further searches with the N—terminal domain of BPI—like proteins
retrieved three more proteins of known structure: dust mite
allergen Der p 7 (3H4Z), a juvenile hormone—binding protein
from Galleria mellonella (JHBP, 2RCK), and a Takeout 1 protein
from Epiphyas postvittana (3E8T). These proteins are exclusively
found in arthropods and are involved in binding hydrophobic
ligands. They are composed of a single domain homologous to the
N—terminal domain of BPI—like proteins (Supplementary Fig. 81),
a relationship that has been described previously (Hamiaux et al.,
2009; Kolodziejczyk et al., 2008; Mueller et al., 2010). In view of
their similarities in sequence and structure, we propose to group the
arthropod proteins together with the BPI—like family into the TULIP
superfamily.

To conﬁrm the membership of SMP domains in the TULIP
superfamily, we generated fold predictions for 16 representative
sequences using the servers Phyre (Kelley and Stemberg, 2009),
MULTICOM (Wang et al., 2010) and MUSTER (Wu and
Zhang, 2008), all of which performed very well in the most
recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction Experiment,
CASP8 (Kryshtafovych et al., 2009). All three methods yielded

many highest—scoring matches to TULIP domains (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Fig. S2). Additionally, we queried the fold prediction
metaserver I—TASSER (Roy et al., 2010), which was the top
performing server in CASP 7 & 8 (Zhang, 2007, 2009). This server
returned a TULIP domain as the top match for 10 of 16 queries and
as one of the top three matches for all but one query (Supplementary
Fig. S3). These matches included both BPI—like and Takeout—
like proteins. A structure—assisted multiple sequence alignment of
SMP domains to TULIP domains of known structure highlights
the basis for these matches (Fig. 4). All sequences have similar
length, distribution of (predicted) secondary structure, and pattern
of hydrophobic residues. However, there are no conserved sequence
motifs, unsurprisingly as such motifs are not even detectable within
individual families (Beamer et al., 1997; Kolodziejczyk et al.,
2008).

To explore the relative positions in sequence space of proteins
of the TULIP superfamily, we searched for homologs of SMP
domains, N—terminal domains of BPI—like proteins, as well as
allergens and Takeout proteins in the nr database using HHsenser,
and clustered the obtained sequences in CLANS (see ‘Methods’
section). The resulting cluster map (Fig. 5) shows three distinct
but connected regions corresponding to SMP, BPI and Takeout—like
domain families, conﬁrming the proposed homology between them.
In addition to the SMP groups described by Lee and Hong (2006) and
the group of Mdm34 proteins described in this article, the clustering
revealed a further SMP group, the uncharacterized transmembrane
24 proteins. It also yielded a number of additional groups of BPI—like
proteins, including the expression site—associated gene 5 proteins
(ESAGS) from trypanosomes, whose homology to BPI—like proteins
has been reported previously (Barker et al., 2008). BPI and Takeout—
like domains are connected by the arthropod allergens, one form of
which is unique in containing tandem domains with clear sequence
similarity, indicating a domain duplication that occurred in insects
(yellow and orange clusters in Fig. 5).

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we have shown that the SMP domain belongs to
the TULIP domain superfamily, a large group of proteins that
bind lipids and other hydrophobic ligands within a central, tubular
cavity (Fig. 6). In several cases (CETP, PLTP), members of this
superfamily are known to exploit this binding activity in order
to mediate lipid trafﬁcking. Given the extensive lipid exchange
between the ER and the mitochondrial outer membrane and the
location of the ERMES complex as a connector between them, it
is attractive to consider that this exchange is mediated by the SMP
domains of the ERMES subunits. As the ERMES complex does not
include a nucleotidase that could energize this process, we propose
that it proceeds along an afﬁnity gradient, amounting to facilitated
diffusion. Although this could be envisaged as resulting from many
short, structurally unspeciﬁc contacts between the SMP domains
(‘kiss—and—run’ mechanism), we prefer to consider that the domains
assemble into structurally well—deﬁned complexes, which establish
a lipophilic, tubular path between the two membranes. Since the
stoichiometry of subunits within the ERMES complex is currently
unknown, it is however not possible at this time to judge on whether
1 : 1 : 1 or some other ratio would most appropriately describe the
composition of such complexes.

Fig. 4. Multiple sequence alignment of TULIP domains. An alignment comprising representatives of the SMP domain family and TULIP domains of known
structure is shown. Sequences are labeled as in Figure 2. The alignment was generated by a three—step approach. First, a multiple alignment of SMP sequences
was obtained using HHpred in local maximum accuracy (MAC) alignment mode. Second, a structure—based sequence alignment of TULIP domain structures
was derived from a multiple structure superimposition calculated using MAMMOTH—mult (Lupyan et al., 2005). In the ﬁnal step, these two alignments were
merged manually using as guide an alignment between lEWF and Mmml obtained with HHpred. The a—helices are shown in red and ﬁ—strands in blue.
Secondary structure predictions for the SMP domains were performed with Ali2D (Biegert et al., 2006). Numbers in parentheses represent length of omitted
segments. Positions in the alignments that are highly conserved or strongly hydrophobic are shown in boldface. Residues that could not be aligned in structure
or sequence are shown in lower case.

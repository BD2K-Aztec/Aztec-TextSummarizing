Abstract

Summary: The integrative analysis of multiple high—throughput data sources that are available for a
common sample set is an increasingly common goal in biomedical research. Joint and individual vari—
ation explained (JIVE) is a tool for exploratory dimension reduction that decomposes a multi—source
dataset into three terms: a low—rank approximation capturing joint variation across sources, low—rank
approximations for structured variation individual to each source and residual noise. JIVE has been
used to explore multi—source data for a variety of application areas but its accessibility was previously
limited. We introduce R.JIVE, an intuitive R package to perform JIVE and visualize the results. We dis—
cuss several improvements and extensions of the JIVE methodology that are included. We illustrate
the package with an application to multi—source breast tumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas.
Availability and Implementation: R.JIVE is available via the Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN) underthe GPLv3 license: https://cran.r—project.org/web/packages/r.jive/.

1 Introduction

In biomedical research, a growing number of platforms and technol—
ogies are used to assess diverse but related information. This has
motivated a number of methods for the integrative analysis of multi-
source data, wherein multiple different sources of ‘omics’ data are
available for a common sample set.

A good guiding principle for analyzing multi—source data is to
simultaneously model features that are shared across multiple sour—
ces and features that are specific to a particular source. A number of
recent methods have adopted this strategy, extending well—
established techniques such as partial least squares (Lofstedt and
Trygg, 2011), canonical correlation analysis (Zhou et 61]., 2015),
non-parametric Bayesian modeling (Ray et 61]., 2014), non—negative
factorization (Yang and Michailidis, 2016) and simultaneous com—
ponents analysis (Schouteden et 61]., 2014).

The joint and individual variation explained (JIVE) method (Lock
et 61]., 2013) was developed as a multi—source extension of principal
components analysis (PCA). JIVE quantifies the amount of joint
(shared) variation between data sources, reduces dimensionality and
allows for visual exploration of joint and individual (source—specific)

structure. JIVE can also be used as a processing step prior to the appli—
cation of other methods, such as clustering techniques (Hellton and
Thoresen, 2016). JIVE was designed for the analysis of biomedical
data from multiple technologies but has been used for other diverse
applications, such as the analysis of data that were processed using
different computational pipelines (Kuligowski et 61]., 2015) and the
analysis of rail commute patterns at different times of day (Jere et 61].,
2014)

Previously, only spartan Matlab code was available to perform
JIVE. In this note, we introduce the R.JIVE package, for which our
intentions are 3—fold: (i) to improve the accessibility of this method
among the bioinformatics community, (ii) to implement important
extensions and improvements of the JIVE method and (iii) to allow
for quick and ﬂexible visualization of JIVE results.

2.1 The JIVE method

JIVE decomposes a multi—source dataset into three components: (i)

(ii) approximations of rank 1’, for structured variation individual to
each source 1' and (iii) residual noise. For dimension reduction and
interpretation, it is helpful to consider the low—rank approximations
in factorized (or “point cloud”) form, analogous to PCA. Joint
structure corresponds to an r—dimensional sample subspace revealing
patterns that explain substantial variability across multiple sources,
whereas individual structure corresponds to an ri—dimensional sam—
ple subspace revealing patterns that explain substantial variation in
one source but not others.

With given ranks, the JIVE algorithm iteratively estimates joint
and individual structure to minimize the overall sum of squared re—
siduals. Simultaneous estimation of individual structure allows the
underlying joint structure to be captured more accurately, and vice
versa. A permutation—based approach may be used to specify the
ranks, which is important to accurately quantify joint and individual
structure. The joint and individual structures are assumed to be or—
thogonal, which makes the decomposition identifiable.

2.2 Improvements and extensions
In this package, we have made some important additions to the ori—
ginal algorithm:

° Missing data is handled in a straightforward way via the singular
value decomposition (SVD) using the package SpatioTemporal
(Lindstrom et al., 2013).

° Ranks may be selected via a Bayesian information criterion (BIC)
motivated approach inspired by Jere et al. (2014), in addition to
the permutation approach. Permutation—selected ranks are gener—
ally more accurate but BIC selection can be much faster for cer—
tain datasets.

° Orthogonality may be enforced between the estimated individual
structures, which improves robustness of the estimates to rank
misspeciﬁcation.

See the Supplementary Material for further details.
2.3 Package details

The jive(. . .) function takes a multi—source dataset and several op—
tions as input and returns an object of class jive with the estimated

joint and individual structure. Several functions are provided to
summarize and generate quick publication—quality visualizations of
the results in the form of a barchart, heatmaps or PCA plots.

3 Example: TCGA BRCA data

We illustrate R.JIVE using publicly available multi—source genomic
data for 348 breast cancer (BRCA) tumor samples from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) data freeze (Cancer Genome Atlas Network,
2012). We apply JIVE to the mRNA expression, DNA methylation
and miRNA data processed as previously described (Lock and
Dunson, 2013). Permutation testing identifies Rank 2 joint structure,
Rank 20 structure individual to expression, Rank 12 structure indi—
vidual to methylation and Rank 18 structure individual to miRNA.
Visualizations of the resulting decomposition are shown in Figure 1.
Heatmaps of the estimated joint structure show joint patterns shared
by the three data sources. The point cloud view of joint structure
shows that these patterns largely correspond to three BRCA sample
clusters, which were previously identified using integrative clustering
as present across these and other genomic sources (Lock and Dunson,
2013). Specifically, one pattern distinguishes Basal—like tumor samples
(Cluster 1) from other samples; among the remaining samples a sub—
group of Luminal A tumors with a low fraction of genomic alteration
and improved clinical prognosis (Cluster 2) is distinguished.

A vignette to reproduce this analysis, with additional visualiza—
tions and interpretation of the results, is available within the R pack—
age and as Supplementary Material at Bioinformatics online.

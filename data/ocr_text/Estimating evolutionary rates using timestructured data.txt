Abstract

Motivation: In rapidly evolving pathogens, including viruses and some bacteria, genetic change
can accumulate over short time—frames. Accordingly, their sampling times can be used to calibrate
molecular clocks, allowing estimation of evolutionary rates. Methods for estimating rates from
time—structured data vary in how they treat phylogenetic uncertainty and rate variation among lin—
eages. We compiled 81 virus data sets and estimated nucleotide substitution rates using root—to—tip
regression, least—squares dating and Bayesian inference.

Results: Although estimates from these three methods were often congruent, this largely relied on
the choice of clock model. In particular, relaxed—clock models tended to produce higher rate esti—
mates than methods that assume constant rates. Discrepancies in rate estimates were also associ—
ated with high among—lineage rate variation, and phylogenetic and temporal clustering. These re—
sults provide insights into the factors that affect the reliability of rate estimates from time—
structured sequence data, emphasizing the importance of clock—model testing.

1 Introduction

Reliable inference of molecular evolutionary time—scales depends on
accurate estimates of substitution rates. The simplest way to esti—
mate these rates is to assume that the divergence of nucleotide or
amino acid sequences occurs constantly over time (Zuckerkandl and
Pauling, 1962), a model known as the strict molecular clock. Under
this model, the rate of evolution corresponds to the amount of se—
quence divergence between a pair of lineages, divided by the time to
their most recent common ancestor. For data sets in which appre—
ciable genetic change has accumulated during the window of

sampling, such that the sequence data are time structured, the se—
quence ages can be used as calibrations to estimate the rate (re—
viewed by RieuX and BallouX, 2016). Sequence data from rapidly
evolving pathogens and ancient specimens often meet these condi—
tions (Biek et 61]., 2015; Drummond et 61]., 2003).

There has been a surge in phylogenetic methods that can expli—
citly handle time—structured sequence data. These methods include
root—to—tip regression (implemented in TempEst; Rambaut et 61].,
2016), least—squares dating (implemented in LSD; To et 61]., 2016),
and Bayesian phylogenetic inference (e.g. BEAST; Drummond et 61].,

2012). These methods differ in how they treat phylogenetic uncer—
tainty and in their assumptions about rate variation among lineages.

Root—to—tip regression uses a phylogenetic tree with branch
lengths in units of genetic divergence (e.g. substitutions/site). A re—
gression of the root—to—tip number of expected substitutions as a
function of the sampling times is fitted (Korber et al., 2000). The
slope of the regression corresponds to the rate, the x—intercept is the
time to the most recent common ancestor, and the R2 value can be
used as a measure of clocklike behavior. Crucially, however, the
data points in the regression are not phylogenetically independent
(Rambaut et al., 2016). In particular, deep branches in the tree con—
tribute to multiple root—to—tip distances, leading to pseudo—
replication. Least—squares dating also requires a phylogenetic tree.
Instead of fitting a regression, it estimates the rate using a normal
approximation of the Langley-Fitch algorithm (Langley and Fitch,
1974). Both root—to—tip regression and least—squares dating assume
clock—like evolution and use rooted trees, but they are able to esti—
mate the position of the root as part of the analysis. However, the
two methods do require a fixed tree, such that phylogenetic uncer—
tainty is not explicitly taken into account, although this can be done
indirectly by conducting the analysis over a set of bootstrap trees.

Bayesian approaches to estimating evolutionary rates require a
model of rate variation to be specified. In most Bayesian dating pro—
grams, such as BEAST, several clock models are available. The strict
clock (SC) model assumes rate homogeneity throughout the tree. In
contrast, relaxed—clock models allow a different rate along each
branch in the tree, although these are assumed to follow a chosen
statistical distribution. For example, branch rates can be treated as
independent and identically distributed samples from a lognormal
distribution or an exponential distribution in the uncorrelated log—
normal (UCLD) and uncorrelated exponential (UCED) relaxed—
clock models, respectively (Drummond et al., 2006). An advantage
of Bayesian methods is that the rate estimate is integrated over the
uncertainty of all of the other parameters, including the phylogenetic
tree.

The fundamental differences among the three methods might be
expected to result in different estimates of evolutionary rates
(Fourment and Holmes, 2014). To test for congruence in rate esti—
mates we collected sequence data sets for 81 different RNA and
DNA viruses. For each data set we estimated the evolutionary rate
using root—to—tip regression in TempEst v1.5 (Rambaut et al., 2016),
least—squares dating in LSD v0.2 (To et al., 2016), and Bayesian
phylogenetic inference in BEAST v1.8 (Drummond et al., 2012). We
found some discrepancies in the estimates, most of which were ex—
plained by high-among lineage rate variation, and phylogenetic and
temporal clustering. As such, these factors should be routinely as—
sessed in empirical data to improve estimates of evolutionary rates
and time scales.

2 Methods

We obtained 81 nucleotide sequence virus data sets from GenBank
(available at https://github.com/sebastianduchene/virus_rate_varia
tion). Each data set contained between 9 and 120 sequences, with
alignments ranging from 305 to 10,066 nucleotides. All data sets
included the sampling times (calendar dates) and were sampled over
time-frames ranging from ~05 to 86 years.

We estimated the substitution rate for each data set using three
different methods (TempEst, LSD, and BEAST). For all methods we
used the sampling times for calibration. TempEst and LSD both re-
quire a phylogenetic tree. We used PhyML v3.1 (Guindon et al.,

2010) to estimate the tree topology and branch lengths using max-
imum likelihood, under the GTR —I— F substitution model. We gener—
ated a root—to—tip regression for each data set in TempEst, where the
root of the tree was selected to maximize the R2. We also used LSD
with the same maximum likelihood trees as above. For this method
we set the minimum threshold for the rate at 10_10 substitutions/
site/year, and the position of the root was inferred in the analysis.

We analyzed the data in BEAST using the same substitution
model as in our maximum likelihood analyses. For the substitution
rate we used a uniform prior with 0 and 1 as the minimum and max-
imum bounds, respectively, and the constant—size coalescent tree
prior. We set the chain length to 107 steps, sampling every 5000,
and verifying that the effective sample size of each parameter was at
least 200. TempEst and LSD always assume clock—like evolution, al—
though the former is able to tolerate some stochastic rate heterogen—
eity (To et al., 2016). In BEAST, however, we analyzed the data
using both the SC and relaxed (UCLD and UCED) clock models. To
compare the estimates from BEAST with those from TempEst and
LSD, we chose between the SC and UCLD models by inspecting the
coefficient of rate variation in the UCLD model. This parameter is
the standard deviation of the branch rates divided by the mean rate
(Drummond et al., 2006). If the lower 95% limit of the posterior
density is close to zero, the data can be considered to have evolved
in a clock-like manner. In such cases we report the rate estimates
from the SC model, otherwise we report those from the UCLD
model. Importantly, this method for clock model selection has simi—
lar performance to more computationally intensive methods (Ho
et al., 2015). To determine the impact of the choice of clock model
in the estimates from BEAST we also compared the SC and UCLD
estimates with those obtained from the UCED model.

One important requirement of Bayesian estimates of evolution—
ary rates and time scales is that the data should have sufficient tem—
poral structure. We assessed whether this was the case for our data
sets by conducting a date—randomization test (Ramsden et al.,
2009). This test consists of randomizing the sampling times of the
sequences and repeating the analysis. If the data have sufficient tem—
poral structure the rate estimate obtained using the correct sampling
times should be different from those based on the date—randomized
replicates. We used two criteria for this test: CR1 and the more
stringent CR2 (Duchéne et al., 2015 ). Under CR1, the data have suf—
ficient temporal structure if the mean estimate based on the correct
sampling times is not contained within the 95% credible interval of
the rate estimate from any of the date—randomized replicates. For
CR2, the 95% credible interval of the estimate based on the correct
sampling times should not overlap with those from the date—
randomized replicates. Importantly, we used this test for the rate es—
timates from BEAST, where it is typically performed, and not for
TempEst or LSD which produce point estimates.

We considered three factors that might lead to discrepancies in
the estimates between methods: topological incongruence, phylogen-
etic and temporal clustering, and among—lineage rate variation. To
measure topological incongruence we computed the topological dis—
tance between the maximum likelihood and the Bayesian highest-
clade—credibility trees using the PH85 metric (Penny and Hendy,
1985). To allow comparison between data sets, we standardized the
PH85 distance by the number of taxa in each data set.

Phylogenetic and temporal clustering occurs when sequences
with similar sampling times are closely related in the phylogenetic
tree, a pattern that leads to unreliable rate estimates and poor per—
formance of the date—randomization test (Duchéne et al., 2015;
Murray et al., 2015 ). To quantify phylogenetic and temporal clus—
tering, we assessed the correlation between phylogenetic distance

and sampling times in the maximum likelihood trees. Our measure
of phylogenetic distance is based on the number of nodes separating
two tips. For every pair of tips, we calculated the difference in sam—
pling times and their phylogenetic distance, and calculated a
Pearson’s correlation coefficient (p). To obtain a P—value we gener—
ated a null distribution of p by randomizing the sampling times in
the trees 100 times. This procedure is appropriate for our data be—
cause the samples are not phylogenetically independent and it does
not make parametric assumptions. A P-value of <0.05 means that
there is a significant association between sampling times and phylo—
genetic distance.

3 Results

For 28 of the 81 data sets it was not possible to estimate the rate
using TempEst or LSD. This occurs when the rate estimate from
TempEst is negative, or when that from LSD corresponds to the
lower threshold value. We found that 21 of these data sets displayed
considerable rate variation across branches, with coefficients of rate
variation that were distinctly non—zero (Supplementary Fig. S1).

We therefore focus on the 53 data sets for which we could esti—
mate the rate using all three methods (Supplementary Table S1). We
also calculated the regression P—value and found that 16 data sets
yielded positive slopes that were non—significant. However, since the
P-value is difficult to interpret in this context due to pseudo—
replication, we retained these data sets in our analysis.

We plotted a pairwise comparison of the rates from the different
methods. We measured their median proportional difference be—
tween the estimates with sufficient temporal structure according to
CR2 in the date—randomization test. For example, for TempEst vs.

LSD the proportional difference is the estimate from TempEst minus
that from LSD, divided by that from TempEst. For the estimates ob—
tained with BEAST we report the mean, while for those from
TempEst and LSD we use the point estimates. To measure bias we
noted the percentage of data sets for which the estimates along the
y—axis are larger than those on the x—axis. Although TempEst tended
to produce higher estimates than LSD, with a bias of more than
80%, the estimates from TempEst were only about 0.14 times
higher those for LSD measured using the median proportional dif—
ference (Table 1 and Fig. 1a). In comparison, the estimates from
BEAST were less congruent with those from both LSD and
TempEst, with median proportional differences of —0.40 and
—0.25, respectively.

Although the estimates from BEAST were not systematically
higher or lower than those from LSD and TempEst, the level of bias
was greater for data sets with considerable among—lineage rate vari—
ation. For example, in our comparison of BEAST versus LSD
(Fig. 1c), 83.3% of data sets analyzed using the UCLD model had
higher rates than those from LSD, but only 27.3% of those analyzed
with the SC model displayed this pattern (Table 1). This is likely be-
cause LSD and TempEst assume a strict molecular clock, whereas
BEAST can use relaxed—clock models. This result is also evident in
our comparison of the different clock models in BEAST. The 95 %
credible intervals of estimates from the three clock models largely
overlap and there is broad agreement between the estimates using
the UCLD and UCED models. However, the mean values from the
two relaxed—clock models are nearly always higher than those from
the SC model (Table 2; Fig. 2). A probable reason for this pattern is
that estimates from relaxed—clock models have higher uncertainty
than those from the SC model, which might be upwardly biased

The proportional difference for two methods, such as TempEst versus LSD, is the difference between their estimates divided by the estimate from TempEst.

The measure of bias is the percentage of estimates on the y-axis that are larger than those on the x-axis (Fig. 1).

Measures of distance and bias are the same as those in Table 1.

because the rate naturally has a lower bound at zero. These factors
can lead to a higher mean value (Firth et al., 2010; Ho et al., 2007).
Consequently, the use of relaxed molecular clocks can lead to over—
estimates of the mean substitution rate when the data in fact fit a
SC, indicating that clock—model testing should be routinely
performed.

We looked for common features among those data sets for which
the methods analyzed here produced very different rate estimates.
Notably, these data sets typically displayed high among—lineage rate
variation, incongruence between the maximum—likelihood and
Bayesian estimates of tree topology, and phylogenetic and temporal
clustering. However, high among—lineage rate variation was the only
factor to display a significant (i.e. P < 0.05) and positive correlation
with the degree of incongruence across all data sets (Supplementary
Table S1; Supplementary Fig. S2). One example of a data set with in—
congruent rate estimates among methods and which displayed all these
factors is the Hantaan virus data set, with an especially high coefficient
of rate variation (mean 1.29, 95 % credible interval 0.71—2.00), very
strong phylogenetic and temporal clustering (P < 0.05 ), and high rela-
tive topological distance between the maximum-likelihood and
Bayesian trees (1.08). Strikingly, the absolute sampling time-frame
does not appear to predict whether there would be conﬂict between the
rate estimates from different methods.

Overall, our study demonstrates that methods for analyzing time-
structured sequence data largely produce congruent estimates of sub—
stitution rates, provided that clock—model testing is performed and
that the data meet certain criteria. In practice, therefore, it is import-
ant to verify that the data have sufficient temporal structure and have
no phylogenetic or temporal clustering. If the data display phylogen—
etic and temporal clustering, a modification of the date randomiza—
tion test can be conducted (Duchéne et al., 2015; Murray et al., 2015;
Rieux and Balloux, 2016), but this is not trivial for data sets without
discrete monophyletic groups with the same sampling times, as in our
data. The performance of these methods should also be investigated
using analyses of other time—structured data sets, such as those from

bacteria and ancient DNA. These data sets form the basis of a wide
range of important evolutionary studies, but pose substantially differ—
ent analytical challenges from the virus data sets studied here.

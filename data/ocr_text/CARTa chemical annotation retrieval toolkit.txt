Abstract

Motivation: Data on bioactivities of drug—like chemicals are rapidly accumulating in public reposito—
ries, creating new opportunities for research in computational systems pharmacology. However,
integrative analysis of these data sets is difficult due to prevailing ambiguity between chemical
names and identifiers and a lack of cross—references between databases.

Results: To address this challenge, we have developed CART, a Chemical Annotation Retrieval
Toolkit. As a key functionality, it matches an input list of chemical names into a comprehensive
reference space to assign unambiguous chemical identifiers. In this unified space, bioactivity anno—
tations can be easily retrieved from databases covering a wide variety of chemical effects on
biological systems. Subsequently, CART can determine annotations enriched in the input set of
chemicals and display these in tabular format and interactive network visualizations, thereby facili—
tating integrative analysis of chemical bioactivity data.

Availability and Implementation: CART is available as a Galaxy web service (cart.embl.de). Source

 

code and an easy—to—install command line tool can also be obtained from the web site.

1 Introduction

Understanding the effects of chemicals, in particular small organic
molecules, on biological systems is fundamental to research in
pharmacology, toxicology, chemical biology and related fields.
Bioactivities of chemicals can be investigated at various scales
analyzing drug—associated readouts, such as protein interactions, cel—
lular phenotypes, toxicity or side effects (Iskar et 61]., 2012). Owing
to the development of high—throughput screening technologies, bio—
activity data for large chemical libraries has rapidly accumulated in
recent years and is increasingly becoming available in public reposi-
tories (see Table 1). While this has created tremendous opportunities
for research that aims to integrate these heterogeneous data sets in
order to gain a better systemic understanding of chemical effects, in

practice such efforts are severely impeded by disparities in data rep—
resentation. In particular, unambiguous identification of chemicals
across databases can be difficult, because a myriad of synonyms and
trade names eXist for many chemicals, and even controlled nomen—
clature and structural descriptions are sometimes ambiguous, similar
to the problem of mapping between various gene, transcript and
protein nomenclatures, now overcome by many bioinformatics tools
(Huang et 61]., 2009, among others). To address the persisting need
in chemoinformatics, we here present CART, a Chemical
Annotation Retrieval Toolkit. In solving the chemical name-
matching problem, CART aims at integrating bioactivity annota—
tions across various databases to provide functional annotation and
enrichment analysis for chemicals. Thereby CART can identify

coherent functional themes, analogous to gene ontology annotation
tools, such as DAVID (Huang et al., 2009). This makes CART use—
ful, e.g. for the automatic characterization of hits derived from
chemical screens (Rihel et al., 2010, for instance). Also in other con—
texts, annotating chemicals with various biological effects is becom—
ing an important task, which has so far largely required expert
manual annotation, but can be greatly simplified by CART.

2 Approach

The first component of CART consists of matching user—provided
chemical names to a comprehensive dictionary of synonyms, serving
as a reference space for disambiguation to unique chemical identi-
fiers (Fig. 1). To improve matching sensitivity over exact synonym
look—up, we additionally implemented an approximate text match—
ing method based on the Apache Lucene search engine (http://
lucene.apache.org/) and heuristics such as the conversion between
salt (e.g. salicylate) and acid form (salicylic acid, see Supplementary
Material Sl for details). CART also offers the possibility to match
structural chemical identifiers, SMILES and InChI keys, via exact
string matching. Taken together, these search capabilities go beyond
what existing tools, such as e.g. CTD (Davis et al., 2014), currently
offer (see Supplementary Table S1).

Mapping to CART’s chemical reference space facilitates subse—
quent retrieval of bioactivity annotations (Table 1, Supplementary
Material S2). This allows for easy, multi—facetted annotation of
chemical libraries, synonym retrieval, which is useful e.g. for text
mining, and the identification of bioactivities that are enriched in
the user—provided input. Statistical significance for these enrichments

Table 1. Chemical bioactivity databases available through CART

is established using Fisher’s exact test with FDR correction for mul-
tiple testing.

In a typical use case, users may want to subject a set of hits re—
sulting from a high-throughput chemical screen to CART analysis.
After name matching, the enrichment analysis can be done relative
to a user—specified background, in this case the library of all chem-
icals probed in the screen. Enriched annotations are subsequently
retrieved from databases describing chemical effects at various
scales, including molecular targets, metabolizing enzymes, func-
tional classifications, indication areas and side effects (Table 1,
Supplementary Material 52). The results are visualized as a network
linking the input set of chemicals to enriched annotations (Fig. 1,
Supplementary Material S3, Supplementary Figure S4).
Implemented in Cytoscape.js (Franz et al., 2015), this network can
be interactively explored.

The Galaxy (Goecks et al., 2010) front—end of CART enables
users to combine individual modules into new workﬂows, allowing
for easy customization and extension of the standard use case
described above. Galaxy moreover facilitates reproducibility due to
its history and sharing functionalities (Goecks et al., 2010).

2 Results

CART uses a comprehensive chemical reference space of about 98.8
million names and synonyms and 68.3 million InChIKeys that are dis—
ambiguated to 37.7 million chemical identifiers based on information
from the STITCH database version 4.0 (Kuhn et al., 2014). Matching
user—provided chemical names into this reference space is very fast,
e.g. processing 1,000 chemicals takes <40s (Supplementary Figure

S1), allowing integrative analyses at a large scale. This is becoming
crucial due to the data deluge of publicly available chemical bioactiv—
ity data (Wang et al., 2012).

We benchmarked the accuracy of CART’s (approximate) name
matching algorithm using four datasets, for which a mapping to
STITCH or PubChem identifiers already existed so that they could
serve as a gold standard. We found CART’s sensitivity to range
between 92 and 100% on these benchmarks, while precision ranged
between 79 and 98% (Supplementary Figure S2). As an additional
means of ensuring high analysis standards, CART enables the user
to interactively curate the automatic name matching results before
proceeding further.

Owing to its unified reference chemical space, CART offers
seamless integration of user—provided data with a number of data—
bases containing functional annotations of chemicals at various
scales (Table 1). These databases vary in scope, as the number of
annotated chemicals ranges from >220 000 compounds with known
protein interactions (Kuhn et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2014) to a few
hundred drugs for which therapeutic classification, metabolization
and toxicity information (Croset et al., 2014; Kuhn et al., 2015;
Law et al., 2014) is publicly available (Supplementary Figure S3).
However, for a set of 1,120 well—characterized chemicals, annota—
tions from 25 databases are provided (Supplementary Figure S3).
CART’s annotation and enrichment functionality is demonstrated
on drug sets previously defined in a study by Rihel et al. (2010) that
screened chemicals for behavioural effects on zebrafish larvae
(Supplementary Material S3 and Supplementary Figure S4). It re—
vealed coherent themes of drug bioactivities, which could otherwise
only be discovered by expert manual annotations (as done in Rihel
et al., 2010).

In summary, CART implements a fast and accurate approach for
matching chemical names to a comprehensive chemical universe.
This facilitates the retrieval of enriched annotations from various
databases describing chemical effects on biological systems (Table 1)
and their exploration in an interactive network view. CART thus
makes integrative analysis of chemical bioactivity data easy even for
non—specialists.

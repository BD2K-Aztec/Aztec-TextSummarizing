ABSTRACT

Summary: Codon optimization has been widely used for designing
synthetic genes to improve their expression in heterologous host or-
ganisms. However, most of the existing codon optimization tools con-
sider a single design criterion and/or implement a rather rigid user
interface to yield only one optimal sequence, which may not be the
best solution. Hence, we have developed Codon Optimization OnLine
(COOL), which is the first web tool that provides the multi-objective
codon optimization functionality to aid systematic synthetic gene
design. COOL supports a simple and flexible interface for customizing
various codon optimization parameters such as codon adaptation
index, individual codon usage and codon pairing. In addition, users
can visualize and compare the optimal synthetic sequences with re-
spect to various fitness measures. User-defined DNA sequences can
also be compared against the COOL optimized sequences to show
the extent by which the user’s sequences can be further improved.
Availability and implementation: COOL is free to academic and non-
commercial users and licensed to others for a fee by the National
University of Singapore. Accessible at http://bioinfo.bti.a-star.edu.sg/

1 INTRODUCTION

The advent of synthetic biology ushered in the new era of life
science research where synthetic genetic circuits (e.g. artiﬁcial
biomolecules, usually nucleotides) can be constructed and in-
serted into the living host to perform novel biological functions
such as a metabolic pathway, a speciﬁc cell signalling response
and/ or novel gene regulation (Benner and Sismour, 2005; Khalil
and Collins, 2010). However, the desired biological functions
can be achieved only if the synthetic genes are properly expressed
within the host organism. Therefore, it is highly required to de-
velop a systematic framework that rationally designs the syn-
thetic genes for optimal expression in the recombinant host.
Factors affecting the expression of recombinant genes have
been well studied. The codon usage pattern, which relates to
relative abundance of tRNA isoacceptors, has been implicated
as one of the crucial determinants of heterologous protein

expression level (Gustafsson et al., 2004). However, experimental
studies have shown that the precise factors and their relative
contributions are unclear ONelch et al., 2009). Computational
tools, such as JCat (Grote et al., 2005), Synthetic Gene
Designer Wu et al., 2006) and OPTIMIZER (Puigbo et al.,
2007), have been developed to quantify and optimize the
codon usage frequency of the coding sequence in terms of the
host’s codon adaptation index (CAI) or individual codon usage
(ICU). Moreover, the optimization of codon pairing, also known
as codon context (CC), has been demonstrated to be effective in
improving heterologous gene expression (Chung et al., 2013;
Hatﬁeld and Roth, 2007; Moura et al., 2011). Additionally, the
presence of hidden stop codons (HSC) also prevents off-frame
reading, thereby reducing resource wastage, and maximizing the
HSC count might increase gene expression (Seligmann and
Pollock, 2004). Thus, several design factors should be simultan-
eously considered for better synthetic gene design. To address
such a need for incorporating multiple design parameters includ-
ing CAI, ICU, CC and HSC in codon optimization, we have
developed a new web server application, Codon Optimization
OnLine (COOL), using a multi-objective framework, which has
been presented in a recent work (Chung and Lee, 2012).

2 FUNCTIONAL FEATURES

COOL is designed as an adaptable web-based interface that pro-
vides an expansive collection of features. Users can fully custom-
ize the synthetic gene design process through a step-by-step job
submission process that allows them to specify their preferred
parameter settings. More notably, COOL supports a wide
range of visualization capabilities for comparing the quality of
optimized DNA coding sequence with respect to the various
design parameters.

2.1 Gene design parameter settings

Similar to existing online applications, COOL can perform the
optimization of a coding sequence based on CAI, which was
known to correlate well with gene expressivity (Sharp and Li,
1987). Additionally, COOL is the ﬁrst web server that uses a
multi-objective framework that incorporates ICU, CC, CAI,
HSC and GC content. For each codon optimization job, users
can select any desired combination of design parameters.
Notably, COOL enables greater ﬂexibility through the custom-
ization of these design parameters, a feature not found in other

codon optimization tools. For a full comparison with other
online tools, refer to Supplementary Table S1.

Because changes in metabolic resources can signiﬁcantly affect
gene expression (Dittmar et al., 2005; Wohlgemuth et al., 2013),
the ability to specify CAI, ICU and/or CC usage distribution is
accommodated in COOL, where users either select a host from
the predeﬁned list, which includes Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or fully customize the codon usage
rules. When a predeﬁned expression host is chosen, users have
the option to select the relevant genes for calculating the refer-
ence codon usage patterns that correspond to efﬁcient expres-
sion. Thus, this functionality enables users to customize their
own list of high-expression genes based on expression data.
Furthermore, some motifs, such as restriction enzyme cleavage
sites, patented sequences and nucleotide repeats, may not be de-
sirable in the coding sequence, as they pose difﬁculties in either
the preparation of plasmid or the in vivo expression of the pro-
teins. Such sequences can be speciﬁed for exclusion during job
submission.

2.2 Visualization and export of results

When more than one optimization criteria are selected, the multi-
objective optimization algorithm generates a number of Pareto-
optimal sequences. Although an earlier stand-alone tool EuGene
(Gaspar et al., 2012) also claimed to perform this function, it did
not have the functionality to generate the Pareto-optimal se-
quences and visualize them on a plot. Therefore, COOL has
addressed this limitation by providing a visualization and com-
parative analysis interface (Fig. l). The relative positions of the
Pareto-optimal sequences on the graph show their ﬁtness levels
on the basis of the corresponding optimization criteria. In the
case where three or more optimization criteria are selected, the
plot displays a third ﬁtness value in the form of the colour of
the points using a cyan—red colour gradient. Users can also

displayed on the axes and the colour gradient.

As a unique feature, user-deﬁned sequence can be mapped into
the Pareto plot for comparison (Fig. 1). Thus, the relative pos-
itions of the user-deﬁned sequence(s) on the plot can indicate the
similarities or differences with the Pareto-optimal sequences so
that the users are guided to enhance the sequences further. The
Pareto plot is interactive and users can click on any of the opti-
mized sequences to obtain detailed information of the sequence,
which includes visualization of the coding sequence and a table
of summary statistics showing its ﬁtness values. These results can
also be easily exported in the format of PDF ﬁles. The optimized
sequences may also be exported to a tab-delimited ﬁle containing
the ﬁtness values for all optimization criteria. This allows users
to plot and analyse the sequences using other software such as
Microsoft Excel.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

This website was built using the open source LAMP solution
stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) based on a Model-View-
Controller architecture. The source code for the LAMP stack
can be downloaded from the COOL website. Although add-
itional interface and visualization features (e.g. sortable tables)
were added in JavaScript, the website is still functional even
when JavaScript is disabled. The backend gene optimization,
which uses a multi-objective genetic algorithm as described in
our earlier work (Chung and Lee, 2012), is implemented in
Perl and functions independently of the main website, interfacing
only with the MySQL database to read inputs and write results.
The waiting time for optimizing a 500-amino acid sequence is
estimated to be ~20 m. We are currently patenting the backend
code and will only release it in binary form, available on the
COOL website.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Cancer genomes are characterized by the accumulation
of point mutations and structural alterations such as copy-number
alterations and genomic rearrangements. Among structural changes,
systematic analyses of copy-number alterations have provided deeper
insight into the architecture of cancer genomes and had led to new
potential treatment opportunities. During the course of cancer genome
evolution, selection mechanisms are leading to a non-random pattern
of mutational events contributing to fitness benefits of the cancer cells.
We therefore developed a new method to dissect random from non-
random patterns in copy-number data and thereby to assess signifi-
cantly enriched somatic copy-number aberrations across a set of
tumor specimens or cell lines. In contrast to existing approaches,
the method is invariant to any strictly monotonous transformation of
the input data which results to an insensitivity of differences in tumor
purity, array saturation effects and copy-number baseline levels.
Results: We applied our approach to recently published datasets of
small-cell lung cancer and squamous cell lung cancer and validated its
performance by comparing the results to an orthogonal approach. In
addition, we found a new deletion peak containing the HLA-A gene in
squamous cell lung cancer.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recently, several algorithms to identify signiﬁcant copy-number
alterations from array-based high-throughput data (e. g.
Affymetrix SNP arrays or array CGH) have been proposed
(Beroukhim et al., 2007; Mermel et al., 2011; Sanchez-Garcia
et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2008). All of these methods have in
common that the occurrence of different levels of tumor purity
and ploidy are barely taken into account. Especially in the
case of patient-derived tumor samples, the admixture of non-
neoplastic cells is an uncontrollable experimental variable,
often leading to large differences in tumor purity throughout
the dataset. An additional feature of cancer genomes is that
some tumors exhibit diverting levels of genome ploidy (triploid,
tetraploid, etc.). Both, low tumor purity and higher genome

ploidy lead to a decrease of inferred copy-number amplitudes
(Carter et al., 2012).

By using rank sums, we propose a novel copy-number-analysis
method that automatically accounts for these different levels of
purity and ploidy. We applied this approach to published
datasets of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) (Peifer et al., 2012)
and squamous cell carcinoma (SQ) WVeiss et al., 2010) and ﬁ-
nally validated detected regions of copy-number alteration by
comparing the results with those derived from a GISTIC analysis
(Mermel et al., 2011).

2 METHOD AND IMPLEMENTATION

The general idea behind our method is to transform raw copy
numbers into ranks. Probe sets in locations of common germ
line copy-number variations are removed. Rank sums for each
genomic location are then computed, smoothed and statistically
evaluated. These key steps are schematically shown in Figure 1A.
A detailed general description of the CGARS algorithm includ-
ing all mathematical details is given in the Supplementary
Material.

3 RESULTS AND CONCLUSION

To validate our method and to test its performance, we analyzed
published datasets of 63 SCLC (Peifer et al., 2012) and 146 SQ
WVeiss et al., 2010) tumor samples and compared the resulting
data with an analysis using GISTIC (Mermel et al., 2011). We
observed that CGARS consumed substantially less computation
time and memory than GISTIC on the same computational in-
frastructure [CGARS: 101s, 2.6GB (SCLC) 264s, 5.6GB (SQ);
GISTIC: 289s, 9.1GB (SCLC) 397s, 9GB (SQ)].

Almost all identiﬁed high-conﬁdence peaks of copy-number
alteration are highly consistent between the two approaches
(Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1 and Tables S1 and S2).
Together with previously published copy-number analyses on
SCLC and SQ (Hammerman et al., 2012; Rudin et al., 2012)
this result supports the validity of our approach.

In case of the SQ dataset, we identiﬁed seven highly signiﬁcant
ampliﬁcation peaks (containing genes: CCNDI, CCNEI, M YC,
FGFRI, EGFR, SOXZ and KRAS) and three deletion peaks
(containing genes: LRPIB, CDKNZA and PT PRD) consistently
detected by GISTIC and CGARS (Fig. 1B). Most discordant
regions identiﬁed by either method are broad lesions
(Supplementary Table S2). Focal copy-number alterations only
identiﬁed by GISTIC include KIAA1841, M T MR3 and
PARD6G; the link of these genes to SQ is currently unclear.
Among the regions identiﬁed only by CGARS are peaks

Fig. 1. (A) Overview of the key steps of the CGARS algorithm. First,
raw copy numbers are transferred into rank sums. Upper and lower copy-
number quantiles are then deﬁned and ranks falling into the upper quan-
tile (red bars) are separately analyzed from those that are situated in the
lower quantile (blue bars). Each genomic location is represented by two
bars indicating the multiple quantile selection. Ranks outside either quan-
tile (white bars) are not considered for the subsequent analysis. Next,
rank sums are computed for each genomic location and maximized (amp-
liﬁcations) or minimized (deletion) over the multiple quantiles (blue and
red stars). These extremal rank sums are then subjected to a smoothing
procedure. Statistics of smoothed rank sum proﬁles are ﬁnally computed
to determine signiﬁcant copy-number alterations, here shown by bars
exceeding the dashed horizontal line (level of signiﬁcance). (B) Results
obtained from CGARS and GISTIC based on the SQ dataset. As main
parameters we chose for CGARS: uq: 0.25, 0.05 (upper quantile),
lq=0.35, 0.25 (lower quantile), and for GISTIC: ta=tb=0.4 (copy-
number threshold). Vertical dashed lines indicate the signiﬁcance level
of 1% and putative target genes in the proximity of the copy-number
peaks are shown in parentheses

containing M YCLI and PT EN; both regions appeared altered
upon visual inspection of the data analyzed as well as in an
independent dataset (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B).

Using CGARS we were further able to identify a previously
unappreciated deletion peak region at 6p21.33 containing the
HLA-A class I major histocompatibility gene (Supplementary
Fig. S2C). In addition, HLA-A is frequently subjected to loss
of function mutations in SQ (Hammerman et al., 2012). Thus,
identiﬁed deletions matched the mutation spectrum in the same
tumor type and is therefore supporting the notion that HLA-A is
a biologically relevant gene in SQ.

Finally, to demonstrate that CGARS is not over-calling copy-
number aberrations, we analyzed our recently published dataset

of 70 pulmonary carcinoids (Seidel et al., 2013)—a tumor that is
particularly silent in copy-number space. Besides a single broad
deletion peak located at 11p11, none other signiﬁcant copy-
number aberration were detected, suggesting that CGARS is
indeed not over-calling copy-number data.

In summary, we formulated a new copy-number—analysis
method and tested its performance by comparing the results
with an orthogonal approach. Our approach yields robust
results, is computationally inexpensive, and is highly ﬂexible.
Furthermore, we identiﬁed a new deletion-peak region contain-
ing HLA-A; a gene that is also frequently mutated in SQ. Our
methodology may thus offer a valuable addition to existing
approaches since its ﬂexibility enables the possibility of exploring
datasets under various aspects.

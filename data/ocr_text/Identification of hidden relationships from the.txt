ABSTRACT

Motivation: Describing domain architecture is a critical step in the
functional characterization of proteins. However, some orphan do-
mains do not match any profile stored in dedicated domain databases
and are thereby difficult to analyze.

Results: We present here an original novel approach, called
TREMOLO-HCA, for the analysis of orphan domain sequences and
inspired from our experience in the use of Hydrophobic Cluster
Analysis (HCA). Hidden relationships between protein sequences
can be more easily identified from the PSI-BLAST results, using infor-
mation on domain architecture, HCA plots and the conservation
degree of amino acids that may participate in the protein core. This
can lead to reveal remote relationships with known families of do-
mains, as illustrated here with the identification of a hidden Tudor
tandem in the human BAHCC1 protein and a hidden ET domain in
the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Taf14p and human AF9 proteins. The
results obtained in such a way are consistent with those provided by
HHPRED, based on painNise comparisons of HHMs. Our approach
can, however, be applied even in absence of domain profiles or known
3D structures for the identification of novel families of domains. It can
also be used in a reverse way for refining domain profiles, by starting
from known protein domain families and identifying highly divergent
members, hitherto considered as orphan.

Availability: We provide a possible integration of this approach in an
open TREMOLO-HCA package, which is fully implemented in python
v2.7 and is available on request. Instructions are available at

1 INTRODUCTION

Orphan domains are segments of proteins forming autonomous
folding units that cannot be assigned to a known domain family,
as stored in dedicated domain databases (Ekman et al., 2005).
They may be included in large unassigned regions, which make
up at least 10% of the residues in a typical proteome (Ekman
et al., 2005). These orphan domains have either evolved too far
from the nearest neighbors to be assigned to a domain, or they

have been created by some de novo mechanisms. Most of the
solved 3D structures of orphan domains, however, show struc-
tural similarity to already known protein domains, suggesting
that the fraction of orphan domains that have distant homologs
is high (Siew and Fischer, 2004). This is consistent with earlier
theoretical studies, which have suggested that protein domains
fall into a limited number of protein folds and families Wolf
et al., 2000). The distant homolog theory is also supported by the
identification of remote homologs to orphan domains through
sequences from environmental sequencing projects, although
these metagenomics studies also revealed many novel orphans
(Rusch et al., 2007). A lot of speciﬁc analyses led to link
orphan domains to already known families or to identify new
families of domains (AraVind and Koonin, 1999). Among these
studies are those we performed using the fold signatures deﬁned
through the Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA) approach [e. g.
(Callebaut and Mornon, 1997a, b; Callebaut et al., 1999, 2002,
2005, 2006) for some examples]. HCA is based on a bidimen-
sional representation of the sequence, in which hydrophobic
amino acids congregate into clusters (Callebaut et al., 1997;
Gaboriaud et al., 1987), which are statistically centered on regu-
lar secondary structures (Hennetin et al., 2003; Woodcock et al.,
1992). Hydrophobic clusters associated with core secondary
structures are stable relative to evolution, offering a way to efﬁ-
ciently compare sequences at very low levels of sequence identity
(see Supplementary Data SI for a detailed description of the
method and its practical use).

Here, we wished to develop a methodology inspired from our
experience in deciphering orphan domains, which facilitates the
detection of distant relationships with already known families of
domains by automatic inference from the PSI-BLAST results.
This methodology, called TREMOLO-HCA (after Travel into
REmote HOmoLOgy with HCA), allows an easier exploitation
of results from sequence similarity search programs (e.g. PSI-
BLAST), by providing contextual (domain architecture) and
structural (conserved hydrophobic core) information. It fur-
nishes for each sequence aligned with the query the domain
architecture of the whole protein, as well as indicates the conser-
vation degree of amino acids that may participate in the protein
fold. The interest of the methodology is illustrated with two ex-
amples of conserved domain database (CDD)—orphan domains,
which were first delineated from the whole-protein sequence by
using our experience in HCA coupled with a home-made pro-
gram called SEG—HCA (our unpublished data), developed for

Fig. 1. Example of a TREMOLO-HCA output. The sequences of the whole proteins with which the query is aligned are shown as lines and domains as
boxes [colored when assigned from the CDD and gray when predicted by SEG-HCA, an automatic procedure for predicting foldable segments which
have high density in hydrophobic clusters (our unpublished data)]. The positions of the segments aligned with the query sequence are added to this
schematic representation as red lines. The corresponding lD alignments, as given in the PSI-BLAST results, are also provided. For these lD alignments,
conserved hydrophobic positions (positions that are always occupied by strong hydrophobic amino acids in signiﬁcant pairwise alignments) are reported
in blue on the query sequence. Their numbers are indicated and should correspond to one half of the total number of hydrophobic amino acids of the
query sequences for an accurate prediction of the hydrophobic core of globular domains. The corresponding positions are colored in the sequence aligned
with the query sequence: (i) also in blue if occupied by a strong hydrophobic amino acid and (ii) in red if not. This coloring scheme thus allows the quick
evaluation of the conservation of predicted core hydrophobic positions. Beside the domain architecture of the aligned sequence and the pairwise sequence
alignment, the HCA plot of the aligned segment is also made available, to allow a quick evaluation of the hydrophobic cluster compatibility. For further
analysis outside the 1D alignment limits, the user can get the HCA plots of the whole-protein sequence through the HCA plot web server (http://
bioserV.impmc.upmc.fr/hca—form.html)

intermediate PSI-BLAST results during the iterative process can be con-
sidered by the user.

Signiﬁcant (E—Value <5 X 10‘3) and non-signiﬁcant (E—Value
>5 X 10‘3) results are both considered. The whole sequence of each pro-
tein aligned with the query is then used for identifying already known
domains through the RPS-BLAST program, run on the widely used

the automatic HCA-based delineation of globular domains from
the analysis of single sequences.

2 METHODS

The TREMOLO-HCA procedure adds to the PSI-BLAST results infor-
mation: (i) about the domain architecture of proteins with which the
query sequence is aligned and (ii) about the conservation rate of the
hydrophobic amino acids, which are conserved in the considered family
of proteins and likely participate in its hydrophobic core (Fig. l).

The implemented procedure uses a standard PSI-BLAST output. In
the application examples presented here, the sequences used as queries in
PSI-BLAST were ﬁrst delineated using HCA (Supplementary Data Sl).
These are rich in hydrophobic clusters, thus constituting potential globu-
lar domains, but they did not mach any CDD proﬁles and are thus con-
sidered as CDD-orphans. The non-redundant (nr) database at National
Centre of Biological Information (NCBI) was used as reference database,
and PSI-BLAST was run with default parameters until convergence is
obtained (or after eight iterations if convergence is not reached at this
stage). However, other settings of PSI-BLAST parameters and

NCBI’s CDD, which includes NCBI—curated domains and domain
models from a number of external source databases (Pfam, SMART,
COG, PRK, TIGRFAM) (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2013). Information
on identiﬁed conserved footprints is summarized schematically (Fig. 1),
allowing the localization of the hit within the context of the full domain
architecture of the protein and thereby helping the interpretation of the
PSI-BLAST results. The redundancy can be reduced at the level of
domain architecture and/or of sequence identity.

To provide criteria for assessing the reliability of alignments at low
levels of sequence identity (thus typically below the threshold value), we
provide access to the HCA plots of the two aligned sequences (Fig. 1),
allowing the evaluation of hydrophobic cluster compatibilities. A guide-
line to the use of HCA is available in Supplementary Data Sl. We also
aim, when possible, at highlighting core positions, i.e. positions partici-
pating in the hydrophobic core of globular domains (Fig. 1). These

positions constitute approximately one half of the total number of strong
hydrophobic amino acids (Eudes et al., 2007). They can be evaluated with
accuracy from the signiﬁcant pairwise alignments (E—Value <5 X 10‘3), if
they are deduced from a set of a sufﬁcient number of sufﬁciently distant
sequences (typically at least 10 non-redundant sequences, which do not
share >40% pairwise identity). We thus identify, within the signiﬁcant
pairwise alignments (E-Value <5 X 10‘3) from which redundancy can be
reduced (by default at 70% sequence identity), those positions that are
mainly occupied by strong hydrophobic amino acids [at least 75% of
hydrophobic amino acids (V, I, L, F, M, Y and W), without loop-forming
residues (P, G, D, N and S) (Poupon and Mornon, 1998)]. The number of
these conserved hydrophobic positions is given as a reference, allowing an
estimation of the quality of the prediction. Ideally, this should represent
50% of the total number of hydrophobic amino acids of the query se-
quence. We provide a possible implementation of the TREMOLO-HCA
procedure into a python software. This latter can be customized and
modiﬁed by users. Package is available on request, and explanations
are available at http://www.impmc.upmc.fr/~callebau/tremolohca.html.
This software was used to investigate the two examples presented later in
the text.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We analyzed globular-like domains delineated through HCA,
which are not assigned to an already known domain of the
CDD. Such segments cover all fold classes (or, ,8, or and ,8) and
have generally relatively small lengths, although large domains
(up to 100 amino acids) can also be found. We focused our
interest on CDD-orphan domains found within some particular
protein families that we have identiﬁed previously and/or play
key roles in the DNA damage response (DDR) and/or in epi-
genetic regulation. TREMOLO-HCA analyses showed that
some of these predicted CDD-orphan domains can be linked
to already known families of domains, by direct inference from
the PSI-BLAST signiﬁcant results. This is exempliﬁed later in the
text, for an orphan domain found in the BAHCC1/TNRC18
proteins, which can be linked to the Tudor family. Another inter-
esting case is an OB-fold, which is detected in the human Tudor
domain protein TDRD3. This OB-fold can also be linked to the
human and yeast RMIl proteins (Yin et al., 2005), which are
subunits of the RecQ (Sgslp)—Top III (Top3p) complex and are
involved in the processing of homologous recombination inter-
mediates (Supplementary Data S2). The other cases, which can
not be predicted by direct inference from the PSI-BLAST signiﬁ-
cant results, may either constitute new domains or be linked at
very high level of divergence to already known domains and
require for their characterization a sensitive analysis of the
PSI-BLAST background noise (non-signiﬁcant E-Values). This
last analysis can also be helped by the consideration of the
hydrophobic cluster conservation, as well as by the knowledge
of the architecture of the aligned proteins. Such an analysis is
also illustrated later in the text, for an orphan domain found in
several members of the YEATS family.

3.1 A tandem of Tudor domains in the BAHCC1]
TNRC18 proteins

The BAH (after bromo adjacent homology) family of domains
includes diverse DNA- and chromatin-associated proteins such
as the CpG—DNA methylase DNMTl and the replication origin
complex subunit 1 ORCl (Callebaut et al., 1999). The BAH

domain of the silent information regulator Sir3p, a key silencing
protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has evolved from
Orcl by gene duplication (Hickman and Rusche, 2010), interacts
with multiple surfaces of the nucleosome, suggesting a possible
involvement in nucleosome compaction that would be disrupted
by post-translational modiﬁcations on histones (Arrnache et al.,
2011). In contrast, the BAH domain of mouse ORCl interacts
with the histone H4 dimethylated at lysine 20 (Kuo et al., 2012),
through an aromatic dimethyl-lysine—binding cage. In
S.cerevisiae, the interaction of the Sirl protein with the BAH
domain of Orcl plays a key role in the establishment of a
silent chromatin structure at the cryptic mating-type loci HMR
and HML (Hou et al., 2005).

A segment predicted by SEG—HCA, which stay orphan when
CDD is searched, is found in the human BAHCC1 (after BAH
and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 1), a large protein
(2608 amino acids), including at its C-terminal end a BAH
domain (amino acids 2482—2602) and whose function remains
poorly understood. This ‘orphan’ segment, including hydropho-
bic clusters typical of regular secondary structures, is found be-
tween amino acids 1868 and 2028. Using this fragment as query
in a TREMOLO-HCA analysis, we found signiﬁcant similarities
with the orphan region of the related trinucleotide repeat-
containing gene 18 protein TNRC18, which also possesses a
C-terminal BAH domain. Signiﬁcant similarities are also
observed with an as yet uncharacterized protein cllorfl6 and
with long isoform homologs of the Drosophila capicua protein,
an HMG—box containing transcriptional repressor, which is
involved in cancer and neurodegeneration (Bettegowda et al.,
2011; Jimenez et al., 2012).

A relationship to Tudor domains, as well as the obvious
duplication of the Tudor domain (tandem) in the query se-
quence, can signiﬁcantly be deduced from similarities with
Tudor domains of several hypothetical proteins, as well as with
the tandem of Tudor domains found in the histone-lysine—
N—methyltransferase SETDBl, in the histone lysine-speciﬁc
demethylase 4 (KDM4, also known as JMJD2) and in PHF20,
albeit sequence identities are very low (<15%) (Fig. 2). The
Tudor domain is a small four or ﬁve stranded ,B-barrel fold,
possessing the ability to interact with methylated partners
(Adams-Cioaba and Min, 2009; Taverna et al., 2007; Yap and
Zhou, 2010). Tandem Tudor domains have been characterized in
several proteins, among which 53BP1 and the J M] D2A histone
demethylase. The individual Tudor domains can be organized as
two independent domains (as in 53BP1, Crb2, SETDBl and
PHF20) or as inter-digitated domains (as in the JMJD2/
KMD4), with each lobe of a saddle-shaped structure resembling
isolated Tudor domains. These last domains, formed by the ex-
change of strands ,83 and ,84, are called hybrid Tudor domains.

In either of these conﬁgurations (standard or hybrid), the
methyl-binding cages include two highly conserved aromatic
amino acids in strands ,81 (a tryptophan) and ,82 (a tyrosine).
The site is completed by a phenylalanine and an aspartic acid,
located at the end of strand ,83 (FxD motif) from the same or
from the other Tudor motif, depending on the double Tudor
motifs forming a standard or hybrid (inter-digitated) structure,
respectively. Examination of the alignment (Fig. 2) suggests that
the Tudor tandem domains of BAHCC1/TNRC18 would adopt
a standard, non-inter-digitated conﬁguration, as all the elements

Fig. 2. A hidden double Tudor domain in BAHCC1/TNRC18, C110RF16 and capicua proteins. (A) The predicted orphan segment of human
BAHCC1 was used as query in PSI-BLAST searches and analyzed through the TREMOLO-HCA procedure. (B) Signiﬁcant similarities were found
with orphan domains from the TNRC18, C110RF16 and capicua proteins, as well as with double tudor domains from several proteins (e.g. human
SETDBl, human KDM4A and human PHF20). (C) Multiple alignment of the Tudor tandem domains of the BAHCC1/TNRC18, C110RF16 and
Capicua proteins with those of human PHF20, KDM4A and SETDBl. The observed secondary structures are indicated below the alignment, together
with the pdb identiﬁers. Conserved hydrophobic amino acids are highlighted in green, whereas other colors are used for other similarities [orange:
aromatic, pink: acidic, blue: basic, yellow: small (A, G and V) or loop-forming (P, G, D, N and S) amino-acids]. Some amino acids (A, C and T), which
may integrate the hydrophobic alphabet following the context, are indicated in light green. The double Tudor domains of KDM4A adopts an
interdigitated structure, with strands ,82 and ,83 forming a long strand and allowing the exchange of strands ,83 and ,84 between the two tudor-like
lobes. Amino acids identiﬁed as participating in the methyl-binding pockets in the different structures are indicated with gray stars, with our prediction
for BAHCC1 indicated with yellow stars, above the alignment. Genbank identiﬁers (gi): BAHCC1: 205371795 (Homo sapiens), 363740891 (Gallus gallus),

of the methyl-binding signature (W in strand ,81, Y in strand ,82
and FxD in strand ,83) are found within the second Tudor motif.
A methyl-binding site in the second Tudor domain of the
BAHCC1/TNRC18 Tudor tandem is thus likely, as also
observed in PHF20, where second Tudor domain has been
shown to interact with dimethylated lysines from p53 peptides
(Adams-Cioaba et al., 2012; Cui et al., 2012). The prediction is
less obvious for the Tudor tandem of CllORFl6 and capicua,
for which no obvious standard methyl-binding sites could be
identiﬁed.

The discovery of Tudor tandems in the BAHCC1/TNRC18
proteins, together with a BAH domain, underlines their potential
importance in combinatorial post-translational modiﬁcation
readout at the histone or nucleosomal level.

3.2 The C-terminal end of the yeast Tafl4p transcription
factor belongs to the ET family of domains

Yeast transcription factor Taf14p belongs to the YEATS family
of proteins, whose members are found in several chromatin-mod-
ifying and transcriptional complexes (Schulze et al., 2010).

Taf14p, also known as Ancl, is associated with several chro-
matin remodeling and transcription complexes (Swi/Snf, RSC,
INO80 and NuA3). Taf14p is also a subunit of the transcription
factor TFIID and TFIIF in S.cerevisiae [reviewed in Zhang et al.
(2011)]. The function of YEAST domains, named after some of
the proteins containing it (i.e. Yaf9, ENL, AF9, Taf14p and
Sas5), remains poorly understood (Schulze et al., 2010). It is
located at the N-terminal extremity of the Taf 14p protein, a
shared property of YEAST domains within the YEAST
family. An orphan segment is identiﬁed at the C-terminal end
of the protein, clearly separated from the YEAST domain by a
hinge region, lacking hydrophobic amino acids.

Using this C-terminal domain of yeast Taf14p as a query
(amino acids 173—239), we identiﬁed signiﬁcant similarities at
PSI-BLAST convergence by iteration 3 with the Taf14p ortho-
logs from various fungi species, possessing similar domain archi-
tectures, as revealed in the TREMOLO-HCA output. Marginal
similarities (E-Value 318) were, however, also readily observed
with the C-terminal domain of the yeast Sas5p (something
about silencing 5) protein, another member of the YEATS
family (Fig. 3). Examination of the corresponding alignment
indicated that the positions in which hydrophobicity is conserved
in the Taf14p orthologs are mostly also occupied by hydrophobic
amino acids in the yeast Sas5p sequence (gray squares in Fig. 3).
Consistently, the Taf14p/Sas5p relationship is supported by com-
parison of the HCA plots, indicating a good conservation of the
hydrophobic clusters, associated with the regular secondary
structures (Fig. 3). No other protein outside yeast Taf14p and
Sas5p were, however, highlighted with PSI-BLAST signiﬁcant E-
values, when the sequences of Sas5p were included in the PSSM
and PSI-BLAST run again to convergence.

Interestingly, in the same PSI-BLAST output and just below
the threshold value (E>0.001), marginal similarities were also
observed with the C-terminal regions of proteins possessing mul-
tiple BROMO domains and belonging to the BET family of
proteins (Florence and Faller, 2001) (e. g. Stereum hirsutum hypo-
thetical protein, shown in Figure 3A and BDFl, BDF2, BRD2,
BRD3 and BRD4 from human, as well as GTE6 from

Arabidopsis thaliana and FSH from D. melanogaster, in
Fig. 3D). These C-terminal regions correspond to ET (after
extra-terminal) domains, which are speciﬁc of proteins of this
BET family. Information about ET domains is, however, not
yet stored in domain databases, even though the experimental
3D structure of the mouse BRD4 ET domain has been solved
(Lin et al., 2008). Examination of the HCA plots indicated simi-
larities between hydrophobic clusters, and the Taf14p/ET
sequence alignment showed that the positions for which hydro-
phobicity is conserved correspond to the conserved hydrophobic
positions of the Taf14p/Sas5p alignment. These observations
support the hypothesis of an ET fold for the yeast Taf14p/
Sas5p C-terminal domains. The conserved hydrophobic pos-
itions deduced for the Taf14p/Sas5p alignment well correspond
to amino acids that are buried within the 3D structure of the
BRD4 ET domain (Fig. 3).

Finally, we also examined the C-terminal domains of all mem-
bers of the YEATS family, and in addition of S. cerevisiae Sas5p,
we identiﬁed the ET signature within the highly conserved
C-terminal domains of two homologous human proteins: AF9
(ALLl-fused gene from chromosome 9) and ENL (Eleven—
Nineteen Leukemia), which are common Mixed Lineage
Leukemia (MLL) fusion partners (Fig. 3). In contrast, the
C-terminal coiled-coil domain of human GAS41 and
S. cerevisiae YAF9, also containing an N—terminal YEATS
domain, did not match the enlarged ET domain proﬁle. This
observation does not support a previous analysis (Le Masson
et al., 2003), reporting a potential relationship between the
GAS41/YAF9 and AF9 C-terminal domains. The relationship
of yeast Taf14p, yeast Sas5p and human AF9/ENL to ET
domains was ﬁnally further supported by using proﬁle—proﬁle
comparison methods [HHPRED (S6ding et al., 2005) probabil-
ities to share signiﬁcant similarity with the ET domain of mouse
BDRD4 (pdb 2jns): 97.5, 97.8 and 98.2, respectively].
Interestingly, although this manuscript was submitted for publi-
cation, the experimental 3D structure of the ET-like domain of
human AF9 (named AHD after ANCl homology domain) was
solved in complex with an AF4 peptide. However, the authors
did not report the obvious structural relatedness with ET
domains, which remained thus uncovered (Leach et al., 2013).
The two structures are indeed similar (Fig. 3C), conﬁrming our
analysis. Interestingly, although the ET domain of BDR4 forms
an autonomous stable structure, the ET-like/AHD domain of
AF9 only folds on AF4 binding.

The relationship highlighted here between ET domains from
the BET family and the C-terminal domains of some members of
the YEATS family opens new perspectives for the characteriza-
tion of this domain in both families of proteins. It is thus likely
that the ET domains play a key role as a protein—protein inter-
action module, involved in transcriptional and chromatin regu-
lation. This is supported in particular by the fact that the ET-like
domains of the related proteins, AF9 and ENL, have been shown
to be sufﬁcient for transformation (Slany et al., 1998) and inter-
act with several proteins [for review (Muntean and Hess, 2012)].
Indeed, the ET-like domain of these proteins is responsible for
the interaction with the scaffolding protein AF4 (Zeisig et al.,
2005), assembling the different components of Super Elongation
Complexes (SEC) (He et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2012). It is also
directly responsible for the binding of another MLL fusion

Fig. 3. A hidden ET domain in the C-terminal end of proteins of the YEATS family. (A) The predicted orphan segment of yeast Taf14p was used as a
query in PSI-BLAST searches and analyzed through the TREMOLO-HCA procedure. Marginal similarities found with proteins of the YEATS family
(Sas5p/AF9) were assessed through the comparison of HCA plots, highlighting compatibility of hydrophobic clusters [colored in panel (B)]. Other
marginal similarities observed with ET domains from proteins of the BET family were also supported by the comparison of the HCA plots
(B). (C) Bottom: experimental 3D structure of the ET domain of mouse BRD4 (pdb 2jns), in which hydrophobic amino acids that are conserved
between the C-terminal domains of some proteins of the YEATS family and ET domains are highlighted in colors, as on the HCA plots (B). These
participate in the hydrophobic core. The recently published AF9 ADH domain 3D structure (top: pdb 2lm0) conﬁrms the similarity with the ET domain
fold. Red spheres represent amino acids of human AF9, whose substitution in alanine disrupts the interaction with CBX8 (Tan et al., 2011) [stars in panel
(B)]. (D) Multiple alignment of ET-like domains of proteins of the YEATS family (yeast Taf14p and Sas5p, human AF9/ENL) and ET domains of the
BET family. Conserved hydrophobic amino acids are highlighted with colored boxed according to the regular secondary structures in which they are
included [gray squares indicate those which are conserved in the PSI-BLAST signiﬁcant pairwise alignments (HP in Fig. 1)]. These, as deduced from the
experimental structure of mouse BRD4 [panel (D)], are reported below the alignment. UniProt accession numbers: P35189 (Taf14p_YEAST), Q993l4

box homolog 8 (CBX8, also known as human Polycomb 3),
which facilitates the transcriptional activation of MLL-AF9
target genes (Garcia-Cuellar et al., 2001; Tan et al., 2011).

Finally, it is worth noting that MLL fusions, including MLL-
AF9, were recently shown to be associated with the BET family
of chromatin adaptor proteins within Super Elongation
Complexes, and that a small inhibitor of these has profound

efficacy against MLL-fusion leukemic cell lines (Dawson et al.,
2011). Whether the ET domains of both families of proteins are
involved in the binding of common SEC partners deserve further
investigations.

4 CONCLUSION

The methodology developed here for easier domain inference
from the PSI-BLAST results provides contextual (domain archi-
tecture) and structural (conserved hydrophobic core) informa-
tion. Protein domain architectures can indeed give useful
information about the functional context in which the query
sequence can be present. The remote relationships of orphan
sequences to already known families of domains revealed here
were also highlighted by the sensitive HHPRED program, based
on pairwise comparisons of HHMs. Our approach can, however,
be applied even in absence of CDD profiles or known 3D struc-
tures for identifying novel families of domains. It can also be
used in a reverse way for refining CDD proﬁles, by starting
from known protein domain families and identifying highly di-
vergent members, hitherto considered as orphan. Hence, starting
with the TUDOR profile or with the sequence of the BDRD4 ET
domain, for which the experimental 3D structure is known, we
were able to identify the remote relationships to human
BAHCC1 and yeast Taf14p. Revisiting systematically the CDD
profiles using such an approach could thus lead to significant
enhancement of their sensitivity for detecting remote
relationships.

Information about positions of the alignment for which hydro-
phobicity is conserved in homologous sequences is especially
useful to get insight into the likelihood of structural relationships
for alignments that are reported with non-significant E-values in
the PSI-BLAST results, which have generally to be further sup-
ported by other information. The conservation of core secondary
structures over the whole domain (and not limited to one or a
few ones), as assessed by considering these positions and com-
paring the corresponding hydrophobic clusters, are thus an im-
portant factor for assessing the relevance of marginal similarities.
In this context, HCA can be rewarding for detecting similarities
outside the first limits detected by PSI-BLAST, independently of
the presence of variable indels that are generally difficult to
handle by alignment procedures (see Supplementary Data S1
and S2 for application examples).

Of course, the methodology described here and applied to the
analysis of PSI-BLAST results may also be adapted to process
results coming from other methods for remote homology detec-
tion, such as HHpred (Soding et al., 2005), HHblits (Remmert
et al., 2011) or HMMER (Finn et al., 2011).

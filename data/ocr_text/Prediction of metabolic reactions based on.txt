ABSTRACT

Motivation: Our knowledge of the metabolites in cells and their
reactions is far from complete as revealed by metabolomic
measurements that detect many more small molecules than are
documented in metabolic databases. Here, we develop an approach
for predicting the reactivity of small-molecule metabolites in enzyme-
catalyzed reactions that combines expert knowledge, computational
chemistry and machine learning.

Results: We classified 4843 reactions documented in the KEGG
database, from all six Enzyme Commission classes (EC 1—6), into
80 reaction classes, each of which is marked by a characteristic
functional group transformation. Reaction centers and surrounding
local structures in substrates and products of these reactions
were represented using SMARTS. We found that each of the
SMARTS-defined chemical substructures is widely distributed
among metabolites, but only a fraction of the functional groups in
these substructures are reactive. Using atomic properties of atoms
in a putative reaction center and molecular properties as features,
we trained support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to discriminate
between functional groups that are reactive and non-reactive.
Classifier accuracy was assessed by cross-validation analysis. A
typical sensitivity [TP/(TP+ FN)] or specificity [TN/(TN + FP)] is %O.8.
Our results suggest that metabolic reactivity of small-molecule
compounds can be predicted with reasonable accuracy based on the
presence of a potentially reactive functional group and the chemical
features of its local environment.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolomics, the study of a cell’s complement of small—molecule
metabolites, has recently been recognized as an important part of
post—genomics science (Fiehn, 2002). Identiﬁcation of metabolites,
including their chemical structures, and reconstruction of the
network of enzyme—catalyzed reactions in which metabolites

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

participate are two of the important challenges for metabolomic
analysis of a cell (Breitling et al., 2006; Kell, 2004; Schreiber, 2005).

Large—scale metabolic network reconstructions currently
available are based on literature data and genome annotation, which
identiﬁes genes encoding enzymes. Reconstructions intended to
be suitable for ﬂux analysis have been obtained in this way for
a variety of organisms (Forster et al., 2003; Reed et al., 2003;
Romero et al., 2004). Organism—speciﬁc metabolic databases are
also available [for an example, see Mueller et al. (2003)].

The sequence/knowledge—based approach to network
reconstruction has a number of limitations. This approach can only
account for reactions that have been characterized experimentally
in some system, and large gaps in our knowledge of metabolism
seem likely. More than 35% of known metabolic activities that are
classiﬁed by Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers are not associated
with known amino acid sequences (Chen and Vitkup, 2007).
In addition, even for Escherichia coli, the quintessential model
organism, novel metabolic reactions continue to be discovered
(Fischer and Sauer, 2003; Loh et al., 2006; Nakahigashi et al.,
2009). Xenobiotic metabolism, which ranges from biodegradation
pathways in microorganisms (Ellis et al., 2006) to drug metabolism
in mammals (Boyer et al., 2007; Rendic, 2002; Vaz et al., 2010),
is rarely considered in network reconstructions. An aspect that
is also largely neglected is the broad substrate speciﬁcity of
many enzymes, which has been exploited in synthesis of organic
compounds (Muller, 2004) and in building libraries of drug
candidates (Breinbauer et al., 2002). Broad substrate speciﬁcity
has been stated to be the major reason why many more metabolites
will be present in a metabolome than can be deduced from genome
sequence (Fischbach and Clardy, 2007; Nobeli et al., 2009; Schwab,
2003).

To improve network reconstruction, we must generate and use
new types of data, such as whole—cell metabolite proﬁles, which
can be produced using techniques such as high—resolution mass
spectrometry (MS) (Dunn et al., 2005). These techniques have
been used to detect many novel metabolites, both endogenous
(Bhalla et al., 2005; Saito et al., 2010; van der Werf et al.,
2005) and xenobiotic (Anari and Baillie, 2005), but signatures
of novel metabolites typically cannot be easily associated with
chemical structures. As our ability to analyze complex mixtures
obtained from cells grows, so does appreciation of our ignorance
of the metabolic networks that produce the compounds in these
mixtures (Harrigan and Goodacre, 2003). Although current MS—
based techniques enable researchers to detect a large fraction of
the metabolome with relatively low per—experiment cost, methods

and software tools for analysis of metabolomic data have lagged
behind the development of analytical chemistry tools, and the full
potential of metabolomic data analysis has yet to be realized (Baran
et al., 2009; Fiehn, 2007; Kind and Fiehn, 2008; Moco et al., 2007;
Wishart, 2007)

Metabolites are linked through metabolic pathways, and novel
metabolites are produced and consumed within pathways that are
linked to known metabolites and pathways. Thus, as suggested
by Anari and Baillie (2005), one possible strategy for metabolite
structure elucidation and metabolic pathway reconstruction would
be to predict reactions and compare properties of predicted reactants
against experimental observations. This approach has been used in
studies of drug metabolism (Anari and Baillie, 2005).

Current methods of reaction prediction are based on expert—
deﬁned rules that generalize the transformations of known reactions
(Langowski and Long, 2002). Several software tools are available
for the prediction of metabolic reactions, such as MetabolExpert
(Darvas, 1998), METEOR (Greene et al., 1999), META (Klopman
et al., 1994), the UM—BBD Pathway Prediction System (Hou et al.,
2003) and BNICE (Hatzimanikatis et al., 2005). Predictions of
these systems are characterized by high false positive rates (Boobis
et al., 2002). To mitigate this problem, some systems report priority
indices based on expert knowledge to aid a user in assessing the
likelihood of a predicted reaction (Payne, 2004). BNICE enables a
user to consider the thermodynamic properties of predicted reactions
(Hatzimanikatis et al., 2005).

Recently, we investigated how machine learning can be used to
extend expert systems for reaction prediction, and we developed
a method for predicting potential substrates and products of
oxidoreductase—catalyzed reactions (Mu et al., 2006). In this
work, we classiﬁed 1626 oxidoreductase reactions in the KEGG
database (Goto et al., 2002) into 12 classes of functional group
transformations. Using seven empirical atomic properties, which
are readily calculated from a compound’s chemical structure, we
trained classiﬁers to discriminate between positive and negative
examples of substrates and products. Classiﬁers were found to
be reasonably accurate on the basis of cross—validation (CV)
analysis.

Here, we report the extension of this method to all six EC
classes of enzyme—catalyzed reactions, which is important for
providing a complete reaction prediction system. Enzymes
catalyze a limited number of biotransformations. We have
deﬁned 80 reaction classes, each of which is characterized
by a functional group biotransformation (e.g. primary alcohol
dehydrogenation). These reaction classes encompass the vast
majority of reactions documented in KEGG. The reaction centers
and surrounding local substructures of substrates and products are
represented as molecular substructure patterns using SMARTS
(http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html),
which is a language for describing molecular substructures. The
existence of a particular substructure is a prerequisite for reactivity;
however, it is not sufﬁcient. To model the reactivity of functional
groups, we have built binary classiﬁers, support vector machines
(SVMs), using positive and negative examples taken from the
KEGG database for each SMARTS—deﬁned substructure. The
input to classiﬁers is a set of atomic and molecular properties,
features that characterize potential reaction centers. CV shows
average classiﬁcation accuracy to be about 80%. A web site has
been established for reaction prediction based on the classiﬁers

presented here (http://cellsignaling.lanl.gov/Reactivityl). The web
site is freely available.

2 METHODS

Data: we initially considered 6577 reactions documented in the KEGG
database (Goto et al., 2002) on June 8, 2006. (The work reported here
began in 2006.) We also downloaded the whole COMPOUND section of
the KEGG database, which included 12027 chemicals. Of 6577 reactions,
5140 were associated with a complete EC number, 476 were associated with
an incomplete EC number and 961 were unclassiﬁed (i.e. not associated with
any EC number). The 5616 reactions assigned a full or partial EC number
consist of 2009 oxidoreductase reactions, 1791 transferase reactions, 953
hydrolase reactions, 503 lyase reactions, 227 isomerase reactions and 200
ligase reactions. A few reactions are assigned multiple EC numbers. Out of
the 12 027 KEGG compounds, 10 942 were linked to 2D chemical structures
in MDL format. The 6577 reactions found in KEGG involve a total of 4792
distinct metabolites as substrates, products or cofactors: 4083 of the 4792
metabolites have 2D structures. More than half of the KEGG compounds
are orphaned, i.e. not documented to participate in reactions. On November
23, 2008, we downloaded 755 newly documented reactions in the KEGG
database (i.e. 755 reactions not available in 2006). These 755 reactions
involve 1721 unique metabolites, of which 1619 are associated with 2D
structures in KEGG. We used the 2006 data to deﬁne reaction classes, to
train classiﬁers and to test classiﬁers through CV. We used the 2008 data
only to test classiﬁers.

Reaction classiﬁcation and rules: we manually classiﬁed 4843 of the
6577 reactions that we considered into 80 reaction classes. These reaction
classes are fully deﬁned in Supplementary Material 81. Each reaction class
corresponds to a set of reactions involving a common functional group
transformation and a common set of reaction centers in substrates and
products. A reaction center is the substructure of a reactant directly affected
by reaction. Among reactants in the 4843 reactions, we identiﬁed 170 reaction
center patterns: 82 of these patterns correspond to substructures in substrates
and 88 of these patterns correspond to substructures in products. Here,
‘substrate’ refers to a reactant on the left—hand side of a reaction, and similarly,
‘product’ refers to a reactant on the right—hand of a reaction. Each reaction
in KEGG is associated with a direction, which is arbitrary in many cases.
Directions are also associated with our reaction classes.

Figure 1 illustrates the basic concepts that guided our deﬁnitions of
reaction classes and reaction center patterns. (Our approach for deﬁning
reaction center patterns, which are essentially functional groups, is explained
in detail later.) Consider EC 1.1.—.— reactions, which involve dehydrogenation
or oxidation of a CH—OH group and various cofactors. The CH—OH
group can be a primary alcohol, secondary alcohol or acetal group. Thus,
we deﬁned three reaction classes for EC 1.1.—.— reactions, one for each
possible type of CH—OH group. The reaction class for secondary alcohol
dehydrogenation/oxidation is illustrated in Figure 1A. As can be seen,
substrates in this reaction class are matched by a reaction center pattern that
contains a secondary alcohol, and products are matched by a reaction center
pattern that contains a ketone group. A second reaction class is illustrated in
Figure 1B.

As suggested by Figure 1, our classiﬁcation scheme was guided by the
EC numbering system, which is used to classify enzymes by the reactions
they catalyze. However, there is not a one—to—one relationship between
our reaction classes and EC numbers. For reactions with a common EC
number, we sometimes divided the reactions into several reaction classes
if the functional group transformations among these reactions were found
to be different (e.g. methyltransfer reactions, EC 2.1.1.— reactions, are
divided into several classes based on whether the acceptor functional group
is derived through N —methyltransfer, O—methyltransfer, S—methyltransfer
or C—methyltransfer). A reaction class may also include reactions with
diverse EC numbers (e.g. our alkyl hydroxylation reaction class includes
EC 1.14.—.— and EC 1.17.—.— reactions). Our classiﬁcation scheme differs from

(A) Dehydrogenation of a secondary alcohol, which is an EC 1 reaction
(listed as Reaction class 2 in Supplementary Material Sl). Reactions in
this class have the form A —> B; the majority of reaction classes have
this form. The reaction center in the substrate (i.e. the reactant on the left—
hand side of the reaction), a secondary alcohol, is a hydroxyl group, and
the reaction center in the product (i.e. the reactant on the right—hand side

centers in substrates are matched by the following SMARTS pattern:
[CX4H;l$(C([OX2H])[O,S,#15])][OX2H]. Reaction centers in products are
matched by either [CX3](=[OX1])([#6,#7])[#6] or [CX4;R](C)(C)([Oh])OC.

Two reaction classes have the form A+ B —> C (Reaction classes 77 and 78).

that of the EC numbering system in two ways. First, our scheme does
not capture all known enzyme—catalyzed reactions. Second, our scheme
is free of idiosyncrasies, in that reactions within a class all involve a
common transformation and a common set of reaction centers in reactants.
Each reaction class can be viewed as corresponding to a rule that deﬁnes
reactions, including a speciﬁcation of the necessary properties of substrates
and products in these reactions.

Reaction center patterns and classiﬁers for reaction prediction: for each
reaction center in substrates and products of the 80 reaction classes, we
used SMARTS, a notational system for representing molecular substructures,
to deﬁne the local structures of reaction centers as previously described
(Mu et al., 2006). Examples of SMARTS speciﬁcations of reaction center
patterns are given in the caption of Figure 1. We deﬁned a total of 170 reaction
center patterns (82 for substrates and 88 for products), which are provided
in a spreadsheet (Supplementary Material S2). A SMARTS pattern may
include not only a speciﬁcation of a reaction center but also a speciﬁcation
of a local structure that must occur or is necessarily absent based on our
best understanding of the relevant biochemistry (Silvennan, 2000). Each
SMARTS pattern is associated with a rule derived from 1 of the 80 reaction
classes. There are 170 reaction center patterns and 80 rules all together
(Supplementary Material S 1).

For each SMARTS—deﬁned reaction center pattern, we developed a binary
classiﬁer via the SVM approach (Vapnik, 1998). The classiﬁer can be
used for reaction prediction. The basic concept is illustrated in Figure 2.
A reaction center pattern and its associated classiﬁer serve as a model
for a reactive functional group. The classiﬁer is trained to distinguish
between functional groups that are reactive and functional groups that are
non—reactive (the details of classiﬁer training are given below). The rule
associated with a pattern together with the structure of a compound found
to contain a reactive functional group matched by the pattern serve to deﬁne
a particular reaction. Patterns identify compounds containing potentially
reactive functional groups, classiﬁers identify functional groups that are
likely to be reactive and rules identify the reactions of compounds with
reactive functional groups.

Labeling of training data: to identify negative and positive examples for
classiﬁer training, we used JOELib (http://sourceforge.net/projects/joelib/)
(JOELib, 2004) to match each of the 170 SMARTS patterns against the
structures of 10942 metabolites, the set of metabolites with 2D chemical
structures in the KEGG database in 2006. Molecular symmetry was
considered to avoid multiple matches of the same reaction center (Mu et al.,

Fig. 2. Illustration of the classiﬁer corresponding to the reaction center
pattern that identiﬁes potentially reactive hydroxyl groups in substrates of
reactions of Reaction class 2 (Fig. 1A). Features (atomic and molecular
properties) are calculated for compounds containing a substructure matched
by the reaction center pattern, and the matches are labeled as either negative
examples (ﬁlled circles) or positive examples (open circles) as explained in
the Section 2. The classiﬁer is simply a surface in feature space (labeled
‘separating plane’ in this ﬁgure) that divides negative and positive examples.
This surface is found using standard SVM methods (Vapnik, 1998; Chang
and Lin, 2001) as explained in the Section 2. There is a classiﬁer for each of
the 170 reaction center patterns.

2006; Steinbeck et al., 2003). For each SMARTS pattern, we divided the set
of matching substructures in metabolites (i.e. the matches) into negative and
positive examples. A match to a reaction center pattern was considered to
be a positive example if the match was recorded in KEGG to be a reaction
center in the type of reaction associated with the reaction center pattern.
Otherwise, the match was considered to be a negative example. Thus, for
lack of a better approach, we assume that absence of evidence is evidence of
absence. It should be noted that more than half of the 10 942 metabolites are
orphaned, meaning that these metabolites are not documented to participate
in reactions. Orphan metabolites contribute to negative training data but not
positive training data. There are 170 sets of negative and positive examples,
one for each reaction center pattern/classiﬁer.

Features—atomic and molecular properties: in general, an SVM classiﬁer
is trained to distinguish negative and positive examples on the basis of
features. The features considered here are atomic properties of the atoms
in a potential reaction center (i.e. the atoms in a substructure matched by a
reaction center pattern) and molecular properties (i.e. properties that depend
on the overall structure of a molecule). We consider 54 atomic properties,
which are listed and deﬁned in Supplementary Material S3, and 81 molecular
properties, which are listed and deﬁned in Supplementary Material S4. Thus,
the total number of features associated with each example is 54 times the
number of atoms in a potential reaction center (1, 2 or 3) plus 81. Below,
we provide a brief overview of the atomic and molecular properties. We also
describe how the properties are determined.

The 54 atomic properties can be divided into empirical properties
(Properties 1—26) and theoretical/semiempirical properties (Properties
27—54). The properties can also be divided into the following six categories:
(i) electrostatic properties (e. g. charge distribution), which include Properties
5—10 and 27—49; (ii) inductive properties (e.g. charge transmission), which
include Properties 12—16; (iii) energetic properties, which include Properties
50—54; (iv) topological properties (e.g. graph potential), which include
Properties 2—4; (v) steric properties (e.g. surface area exposed to solvent),
which include Properties 11, 17, 18 and 20; and (vi) distance properties (e. g.
the Euclidean distance between an atom in a molecule and the center of mass

of the molecule), which include Properties 1, 19 and 21—26. In earlier work
(Mu et al., 2006), we considered only seven atomic properties. Here, we
consider more atomic properties largely because we are considering more
reaction classes (80 versus 12). The properties inﬂuencing reactivity seem
to depend on the class of reaction under consideration (see Section 3).

The 81 molecular properties characterize the shape, surface, energy and
charge distribution of a molecule. We introduce molecular properties to
deﬁne the limits of applicability of our classiﬁers, as we expect naturally
occurring metabolites, which comprise our training data, to have molecular
properties distinct from those of many xenobiotic compounds.

The atomic and molecular properties are derived from 2D and 3D
chemical structures as described in detail in Supplementary Materials S3
and S4. Starting from the 2D structures obtained from the COMPOUND
section of the KEGG database, we used the Marvin Beans software package
(http://www.chemax0n.com/marvin/help/applications/molconvert.html)
(MolConverter, 2009) to add explicit hydrogen atoms for valence balance
and to generate 3D atomic coordinates. The generated 3D structures were
then optimized using MOPAC2007 and the PM3 parameter set (Stewart,
2007). The optimized 3D structures were then used to determine atomic
and molecular properties using JOELib (JOELib, 2004), CDK (Steinbeck
et al., 2003), MOPAC2007 (Stewart, 2007) and simple in—house codes.
In—house codes were used to calculate several properties that we introduce
in this study (Properties 19—26) and to process MOPAC2007 output ﬁles.
Detailed deﬁnitions of the newly introduced properties are available in
Supplementary Material S3.

Classiﬁer training: each training example is associated with a vector of
features. We scaled the numerical values of each feature to lie in the range
[—1, +1].

Given l training examples x: {x1, x2, ..., x;}, where x,- is the vector
of features associated with example i, and l labels y={y1, y2,...,yl},
which identify each example as either a negative or positive example, we
used LIBSVM (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm) (Chang and Lin,
2001) to train a soft margin SVM classiﬁer by solving the following dual
optimization problem:

1
min—«THoc—och (1)
a 2
subject to
0505,50“ if yizl,
yToc =0
where at is a vector of Lagrange multipliers, C+ and C_ are penalty

parameters introduced to balance the numbers of positive and negative
examples, and H is an l><l matrix. The elements of H are given by

Hij ZYinKOCia-xj) (3)

where K (xi,xj) is a kernel. We initially considered a linear kernel, as in our
earlier work (Mu et al., 2006), but we obtained better results with a radial
basis function (RBF) kernel, a type of kernel commonly used. This kernel is
given by
K(x.-,x,-)=exp(—y lei —x,- “2)

where i, j: 1, ...,l. The values of y, C+ and C_ are selected as described
below and training yields values for the Lagrange multipliers oz (Chang and
Lin, 2001). The decision function for a new feature vector is the sign of the
classiﬁer’s raw score, which is given by

l
f(x)=Zoc.-y.-K(x,xi)+b (4)
i=1

where b is a parameter that can be obtained given the solution of the

optimization problem described above (Chang and Lin, 2001).
Sensitivity and speciﬁcity of each classiﬁer are calculated as part of a
3—fold CV procedure, in which the whole training dataset is divided randomly
into three equal sets and each of the three sets is used for testing one by one

while the other two sets are used for training. Sensitivity Q, is the fraction of
positive examples (TP) that are predicted to be positives [TP/(TP + FN)], and
speciﬁcity Q, is the fraction of negative examples (TN) that are predicted to
be negatives [TN/(TN +FP)]. The quantities FP and FN are the numbers of
false positives and negatives. For each SVM classiﬁer, three parameters, y,
C+ and C_, need to be determined. We used a grid—search of y, C+ and C_

values to optimize
Q = \/ Qp >< Qn (5)

This procedure is intended to balance sensitivity and speciﬁcity. A good
classiﬁer does not sacriﬁce sensitivity to obtain speciﬁcity or vice versa,
and it is desirable for Q, and Q, to each be close to 1. Two grid—
searches were performed for each SVM classiﬁer. First, we performed a
coarse grid search over the following grid points: C+ = [2_5,2_3, ...,215],
C_ =[2-5,2-3, ...,215] and y=[2-15,2-13, ...,23].We thenperformed ﬁne
grid searches around local optima with exponentially decaying steps: 2, 20‘5 ,
20.125, etc.

Feature importance ranking: to rank the relative importance of features
for a given classiﬁer (Guyon et al., 2002), we calculate a ranking coefﬁcient,
which is given by the change in the value of the objective function [Equation
(1)] when a feature is essentially removed from H [Equation (3)]. Thus, for
a feature with index r in the vector of features, we calculate,

DJ(—r)= éaTHa— éaTH(—r)oc (6)

where H (—r) is H recalculated such that the feature with index r in each
vector of features x,- (i=1,  ,l) is set equal to zero.

For a given set of feature indices R, we deﬁne the contribution of the
corresponding features to the output of a classiﬁer as,

T
05 H (—R)oc
CT —R 21— — 7
( ) “Tm ( >
where H (—R) is H recalculated such that the features with indices in R in
each vector of features x,- (i=1,  , l) are set equal to zero.

Feature selection: we modiﬁed the classiﬁer training protocol described
above to include a simple recursive feature selection algorithm suitable for
SVM classiﬁers (Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003). In the algorithm, a classiﬁer is
trained using a given set of features as usual. We start with the complete set
of atomic and molecular features. Next, the features are ranked as described
above, the least important feature is removed to obtain a smaller set of
features, and the classiﬁer is retrained using the new, smaller feature set.
The procedure is repeated.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Classiﬁcation of enzyme-catalyzed reactions

As detailed in the Section 2, we manually classiﬁed reactions
obtained from the KEGG database (Goto et al., 2002) in 2006 into
80 reaction classes based on the biotransformations occurring in
reactions (Fig. 3; Supplementary Material S1). Of 5616 reactions
obtained from KEGG with a full or partial EC number, 4251 (75.7%)
involve a transformation captured in one of the 80 reaction classes
deﬁned here (Fig. 3B). Of the 5616 reactions, 826 (14.7%) could
not be included in our analysis because structural information was
missing in KEGG for substrates and/or products, and 539 (9.6%)
involve exotic transformations unaccounted for in our 80 reaction
classes (Fig. 3B). With more data, it may be possible to recognize
regularities among these exotic reactions, but for now, we do not
consider them further. Of 961 reactions obtained from KEGG
without an assigned EC number, 592 (61.6%) have well—deﬁned
functional group transformations and these reactions are included in
the 80 reaction classes.

For each reaction center in substrates and products, we used
SMARTS to deﬁne the local structures of reaction centers as

Fig. 3. Summary of reaction classiﬁcation. (A) Number of reactions included
in each of the 80 reaction classes. Reaction classes 1—21 are typically
subclasses of oxidoreductase—catalyzed reactions (EC 1). We deﬁned more
reaction classes than in our earlier study of oxidoreductase—catalyzed
reactions (Mu et al., 2006). For example, alcohol dehydrogenation reactions
considered in our earlier work were divided into dehydrogenation reactions
of primary and secondary alcohols. Classes 22—47 are typically subclasses
of transferase—catalyzed reactions (EC 2). Classes 48—66 are typically
subclasses of hydrolase—catalyzed reactions (EC 3). Classes 67—73 are
typically subclasses of lyase—catalyzed reactions (EC 4). These subclasses
were deﬁned based on the type of chemical bonds cleaved and the type of new
bonds formed. Classes 74—76 are typically subclasses of isomerase—catalyzed
reactions (EC 5). Classes 77—80 are typically subclasses of ligase—catalyzed
reactions (EC 6). These subclasses were deﬁned based on the type of
chemical bond formed. (B) Number of reactions included among the 80
reaction classes for each major EC class. EX is the number of reactions
documented in KEGG but not included in our analysis because they involve
exotic transformations. NS is the number of reactions not included because
structural information is missing in KEGG for substrates and/or products.

previously described (Mu et al., 2006), and we deﬁned a total of 170
reaction center patterns (Supplementary Materials S1 and S2). Each
reaction center is associated with a class of reaction. The reaction
center patterns can be used to determine if a compound is a potential
reactant in an enzyme—catalyzed reaction. The existence of a reaction
center in a given metabolite is a prerequisite for a reaction.

To identify negative and positive examples of reactive functional
groups, we matched each SMARTS pattern against 10 942
metabolites, which is the set of metabolites with 2D chemical
structures documented in the KEGG database in 2006. A match to
a reaction center pattern was considered to be a positive example
if the match was recorded in KEGG to be a reaction center in
the class of reaction associated with the reaction center pattern.
Otherwise, the match was considered to be a negative example.
Figure 4 shows the numbers of positive and negative examples
identiﬁed in this manner for the 170 reaction center patterns, 82
of which correspond to substructures of substrates in our reaction
classes and 88 of which correspond to substructures of products
in our reaction classes. Each reaction class has a direction, with
substrates on the left side and products on the right side. For
each of the reaction classes, we found that the reaction centers
of substrates and products are widely distributed among known
metabolites (Fig. 4). The number of negative examples is typically
much larger than the number of positive examples, although there
are exceptions (e.g. thiol oxidation, RSH+RSH —> RS—SR). This
ﬁnding demonstrates that generalized transformation rules derived
from reaction classiﬁcation schemes can only be applied selectively

cell through processes akin to random combinatorial synthesis.

3.2 Validation of classiﬁers

Using atomic and molecular properties as features, as discussed
in the Section 2, we built classiﬁers, SVMs (Vapnik, 1998), to
distinguish positive examples from negative examples for 170 sets of
examples. The examples in each set are metabolites that all contain a
substructure matched by one of the 170 reaction center patterns. We
used a RBF kernel. The kernel parameters and other hyperparameters
of the SVMs were determined through grid searching, as discussed
in the Section 2. The hyperparameters found for each of the 170
classiﬁers are available in Supplementary Materials S1. Details
about classiﬁers and classiﬁer training are available in Section 2.
We measure the performance of each SVM using two statistics:
sensitivity Qp, which is the fraction of positive examples that are
predicted to be positives, and speciﬁcity Qn, which is the fraction of
negative examples that are predicted to be negatives. We calculated
Q, and Q, for each classiﬁer in two ways: (i) in CV using data
obtained from KEGG in 2006 and (ii) in blind testing using data
obtained from KEGG in 2008. Figure 5 shows average values
of sensitivity and speciﬁcity for each of the 170 classiﬁers based
on 10 replications of 3—fold CV. The sensitivities and speciﬁcities
shown in Figure 5 and SDs are given in Supplementary Material S1.

The average sensitivity for all 170 classiﬁers is 0.74 with a SD
of 0.11, and the average speciﬁcity is 0.87 with a SD of 0.08.
These results suggest that the local environment of atoms in a
potential reaction center plays an important role in reactivity, as
the features that provide the basis for classiﬁcation characterize the
local environment of a potential reaction center.

To further test the performance of classiﬁers, we used information
about reactions now documented in KEGG but not used at all
in training. These reactions were added to KEGG after initial
versions of our classiﬁers were built. A total of 755 new
reactions were obtained from KEGG in 2008 for use in blind
testing. The 755 reactions involve 1721 metabolites. We found 2D
structural information for 1619 of these metabolites in the KEGG
database. After removing reactions that are not associated with
reactant structure information and that involve ambiguous or exotic
transformations (e.g. KEGG reaction R07744), we classiﬁed the
remaining 624 reactions into our 80 reaction classes. These reactions
involve reactants that match 71 of the 82 reaction center patterns
for substrates and reactants that match 75 of the 88 reaction center
patterns for products. For each reaction center pattern, we then
identiﬁed positive and negative examples of reactive functional
groups among the 1619 metabolites. Results from blind testing
are similar to those obtained via CV. For example, the average
sensitivity for the 71 substrate classiﬁers is 0.81 with a SD of
0.22. For the 75 product classiﬁers, it is 0.82 with an SD of 0.21.
These results reinforce those of our CV analysis and further indicate
that our classiﬁers generalize well and can be used to predict
enzyme—catalyzed reactions with reasonable accuracy. These results
also suggest that our classiﬁers, which were trained using data
obtained from KEGG in 2006, will not quickly become obsolete.
Detailed results from blind testing are available in Supplementary
Materials S1.

In the above validation analysis, we examined the reactivity of a
functional group in different molecular environments. We asked if
our classiﬁers could identify the environments in which a functional
group is reactive. We now examine different functional groups in
the same molecule and ask if our classiﬁers can identify the reactive
ones.

We can apply our classiﬁers to predict reactions for a metabolite as
follows (Fig. 6). For each candidate reaction center in the metabolite,
the raw output score of the corresponding classiﬁer is determined.
(The classiﬁer decision function for the candidate reaction center
is the sign of the raw output score, and the raw output score
measures the location of the candidate reaction center in feature
space relative to the separation line of the SVM classiﬁer.) For
a given compound, the 80 reaction classes discussed above serve
as rules that determine the possible reactions of the compound.
Each classiﬁer that corresponds to a reaction center pattern that
matches a substructure in the compound provides a raw output
score for a possible reaction. The possible reactions identiﬁed in
this way are ranked using the raw output scores of classiﬁers. Top
ranked reactions (the most likely) have greater raw output scores
than the bottom ranked reactions (the least likely). For the 1619
metabolites involved in the reactions considered in blind testing,
650 (731) metabolites are involved in 755 reactions as substrates
(products). Based on the reaction rules that follow from our 80
reaction classes, the average number of possible reactions that each
metabolite can be involved in as a substrate or product is 149.7 and
123.2, respectively. Among these possible reactions, we identiﬁed

Fig. 6. Illustration of how classiﬁers can be used to rank the reactivity of
functional groups within a compound. We note that the structure of compound
C16651 (KEGG ID) was not used in classiﬁer training, i.e. we downloaded
information about this compound in 2008. Using our 82 ‘substrate’ reaction
center patterns, we identiﬁed 81 potential reaction centers in C16651. These
reaction centers correspond to 81 possible reactions that consume C16651,
5 of which are illustrated in the ﬁgure. These reactions are instances of
Reaction classes 2, 70, 9, 23 and 67 (Supplementary Material 81). For each
of the 81 reactions, we calculated a raw SVM score, as described in the
Section 2. Functional groups that receive a positive score are classiﬁed as
reactive. Only 7 of the 81 functional groups are classiﬁed as reactive. The
raw SVM scores are used to rank the 81 possible reactions, from most likely
to least likely. We associate the most likely reaction with the greatest score
(1.65) and the least likely reaction with the least score (—5.10). Among the
81 possible reactions, there are two reactions documented in KEGG. These
reactions have KEGG IDs R08335 and R08338 and they are ranked 1 and 2.
The enrichment factors for these bonda ﬁde reactions are 81/1 (for R08335)
and 81/2 (for R08338). If desired, the 88 ‘product’ reaction center patterns
and corresponding classiﬁers can be used in a similar manner to evaluate
possible reactions that produce, rather than consume, compound C16651.

the rank of bonaﬁde reactions, those reported in KEGG. The median
ranks of the bona ﬁde reactions involving substrates or products are
10 and 4, respectively, and the average rank is 23.24 and 11.14,
respectively. For each bona ﬁde reaction, we deﬁned an enrichment
factor, the total number of possible reactions involving a substrate
or product divided by the rank of the bona ﬁde reaction among all
possible reactions. Multiple reactions for the same metabolite are
computed separately. The average enrichment factors for reactions
involving substrates or products are 25.44 and 50.37, respectively.
These results indicate that our classiﬁers can reasonably identify
the truly reactive functional groups among the potential reactive
functional groups in a given compound.

3.3 Insights into reactivity

To gain insights into the chemical properties of metabolites that
affect their reactivity, we used the metric of Equation (6) to
determine the importance of each atomic and molecular feature for

Average Ranking of Features

Fig. 7. Average feature importance rank across 170 classiﬁers. Feature
indices, which are deﬁned in Supplementary Material SS, are given along
the y—axis. Average rank, which is between 1 (best possible) and 135 (worst
possible), is given along the x—axis. The most important feature on average is
the feature with index 24. Only the 30 highest ranked features are included in
this ﬁgure. Black bars correspond to atomic properties; gray bars correspond
to molecular properties. All bars are labeled to identify empirical (e) and
theoretical/semiempirical (t) properties. Black bars are labeled to identify
the class of atomic property (see Section 2): electrostatic (e1), inductive (in),
topological (t0), steric (st) or distance (ge). N0 energetic properties appear
in the top 30.

each classiﬁer. For each classiﬁer, relative importance was estimated
for each of the 135 features (54 atomic properties and 81 molecular
properties) as follows. For a given classiﬁer, we translated the
importance assigned by Equation (6) to a feature ranking in the
range of 1—135, with rank 1 corresponding to the most important
feature and rank 135 corresponding to the least important feature.
For each feature, an average ranking was calculated based on ranking
across all 170 classiﬁers. The average importance ranks are given in
Supplementary Material SS. The importance rank for each of the 135
properties for each of the 170 classiﬁers is given in Supplementary
Material S6. We also assessed the relative importance of atomic
versus molecular properties using the metric of Equation (7). The
results are given in Supplementary Material S7.

Figure 7 shows the top 30 features based on average ranking.
The four most important features are distance properties, properties
that reﬂect the geometrical location of a potential reaction center
in a molecule. It seems that functional groups far away from the
molecular center, but near the surface of a molecule, tend to be more
reactive than those that are near the center of the molecule. Among
the top 30 properties, the majority of features are electrostatic
properties, consistent with our intuition about biochemistry. Also,
most of the properties are atomic rather than molecular properties.
Atomic properties generally have more importance than molecular

properties. As assessed by the metric of Equation (7), the average
importance contribution of molecular properties is 0.39 (out of 1.0)
with a SD of 0.15 (Supplementary Material S7). We note that three
of the eight properties deﬁned in this study are among the top 30
features.

Supplementary Material S8 is a heat map showing the 135 X 170
ranks calculated using Equation (6)—this heat map visualizes the
information in Supplementary Material S6. As can be seen from the
heat map, there is no subset of features that is important across
all classiﬁers. In other words, there are no atomic or molecular
properties that govern reactivity across all 80 classes of reactions.
One consequence of this ﬁnding is that calculation of a large
number of properties is a necessary feature of our prediction system,
although we are not claiming that the set of properties considered
here is optimal or minimal.

We investigated the effect of modifying classiﬁer training to
include a simple feature selection algorithm, which is described
in the Section 2. In short, no dramatic improvement in classiﬁer
performance was obtained by introducing feature selection. The
impact of feature selection on speciﬁcity, sensitivity and Q [Equation
(5)] is illustrated in Supplementary Material S9 for six classiﬁers.
The results shown are typical. In some cases, a slight performance
gain can be achieved.

4 DISCUSSION

It seems that numerous metabolites unknown to science exist in
Nature, perhaps especially in the plant kingdom (Fiehn, 2002). The
KEGG database includes information about <16 000 compounds,
and <5000 of these compounds are documented to participate in
a reaction of some kind. Considering also man—made chemicals,
the number of unknown enzyme—catalyzed reactions is surely large.
How can we ﬁll gaps in our knowledge of metabolites and metabolic
reactions? Metabolites are linked through metabolic pathways,
and novel metabolites are produced and consumed by pathways
connected in some way to known metabolites and pathways.
Also, it seems likely that novel pathways will use the known
repertoire of biotransformations which enzymes have evolved to
catalyze. Thus, reaction prediction methods, which rely on rules
that generalize known reactions, may be helpful in the discovery of
novel enzyme—catalyzed reactions and in assignment of structures to
novel metabolites (Anari and Baillie, 2005; Soh and Hatzimanikatis,
2010). Such methods may have other applications as well (Soh and
Hatzimanikatis, 2010).

To improve on currently available methods for reaction prediction,
we have developed a prediction system, covering all six EC classes
of reactions, which is based on a unique combination of expert
knowledge, computational chemistry and machine learning. We
classiﬁed metabolic reactions based on functional group chemistry
and identiﬁed 80 reaction classes, which serve as rules for metabolic
transformations. We then built SVM classiﬁers, which serve as
models for reactive substructures in small—molecule compounds.
Classiﬁers take as input a set of atomic and molecular properties,
which can be derived from a chemical structure using computational
chemistry tools. Our rules and classiﬁers are not comprehensive but
they account for the majority of reactions documented in KEGG.
Lack of training data is the main reason for not including more rules
and classiﬁers at this time.

CV analysis indicates that our reaction prediction system is
accurate (Fig. 5), in that a typical classiﬁer is both sensitive and
speciﬁc. The average sensitivity is 0.74, and the average speciﬁcity
is 0.87. (A classiﬁer with sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 1 is perfect.)
The results of CV analysis were conﬁrmed in blind testing, i.e.
tests with data not considered in classiﬁer training. We also found,
via the approach illustrated in Fig. 6, that bona ﬁde reactions
are highly enriched among the set of reactions predicted for a
given small—molecule compound. To achieve greater accuracy, our
prediction approach could potentially be combined with aspects
of other prediction systems designed to limit the combinatorial
explosion that occurs when rules only are applied to predict
reactions. Thermodynamic analysis (Hatzimanikatis et al., 2005)
and reasoning rules (Fenner et al., 2008) seem promising in this
respect.

We emphasize that our prediction system does not make
predictions about the activities of particular enzymes, which can be
highly speciﬁc (Boernke et al., 1995), or the metabolic capabilities
of particular organisms. Rather, it identiﬁes functional groups that
have properties similar to those of known reactive functional groups.
Alternatively, our prediction system can be viewed as identifying
functional groups that are not likely to be reactive in any biochemical
system given the knowledge used to build the system, i.e. the
information in the KEGG database.

One application of our system could be discovery of novel
metabolic reactions through analysis of metabolomic data. In
metabolite proﬁling experiments, especially those involving ultra
high—resolution MS techniques, many more metabolites are detected
in cell lysates than are documented to exist in pathway databases,
such as KEGG (Fiehn and Weckwerth, 2003). The challenge
in reconstructing a metabolic network from this type of data
is to assign chemical structures to the signatures of novel
metabolites and to elucidate substrate—product relationships. We
believe reconstruction can be aided by reaction prediction in the
following way. Consider a large set of MS peaks, most of which
cannot be associated easily with chemical structures, and consider
one peak to which a chemical structure can be assigned. For
this structure, apply reaction prediction, which will identify a
set of compounds that are potentially connected to the known
compound via enzyme—catalyzed reactions, i.e. a set of possible
precursors and products. Look for peaks corresponding to these
predicted precursors and products. If such a peak is found, the
structure obtained via reaction prediction can then be tentatively
assigned to the peak. This process can be iterated as many
times as desired. We have not attempted to determine if this
idea can actually contribute to network reconstruction based on
metabolite proﬁling, but it seems worth mentioning as a possible
application. Note that this suggested application of our reaction
prediction system would only be useful if there are reactions
taking place in cells that are not currently documented in available
databases.

It may be helpful to brieﬂy discuss some of the machine learning
aspects of the work reported here. The present work is an extension
of our earlier work (Mu et al., 2006), in which we developed 12
classiﬁers (for predicting EC 1 reactions) that take as input a set of
only seven atomic properties, which are empirical. These classiﬁers
are linear SVMs. Here, we report non—linear SVMs with RBF
kernels, which we found to perform better in terms of sensitivity
and speciﬁcity than linear SVMs (data not shown). However, the

performance improvement is slight. Thus, use of the RBF kernel is
not an essential ingredient of our prediction system.

In contrast, use of more than seven atomic properties is an
essential ingredient. The main reason is the greater number of
reaction classes considered in the present work (80 versus 12). This
conclusion is based on our study of feature importance. Although
we can point to some general aspects of feature importance, which
are evident in Figure 7, there is no subset of features that governs
reactivity for all reaction classes (Supplementary Materials S6
and S8).

We performed an exploratory investigation of the impact
of feature selection (Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003) on classiﬁer
performance. Representative results are shown in Supplementary
Material S9. We found that the performance of some classiﬁers can
be improved slightly by incorporating a simple feature selection
algorithm into the classiﬁer training protocol. However, feature
selection did not yield dramatic improvements.

Our present consideration of features extends our earlier
consideration of features in three ways: (i) more empirical
properties, (ii) theoretical/semiempirical properties for the ﬁrst time
and (iii) molecular properties for the ﬁrst time. We found that
molecular properties are less important than atomic properties
(Supplementary Material S7). However, in our analysis, we
only considered endogenous metabolites. We feel that molecular
properties would be more important if we also considered xenobiotic
compounds, as xenobiotic compounds do not necessarily resemble
naturally occurring metabolites.

By considering more features than in earlier work (Mu et al.,
2006), we increased the breadth of our reaction prediction system
(from EC 1 reactions to all six EC reaction classes). Our
consideration of additional features also yielded improved classiﬁer
performance. For example, for dehydrogenation of CH—CH to C=C
(Reaction class 6), the sensitivity and speciﬁcity scores of the
‘substrate’ classiﬁer based on a linear kernel and seven atomic
properties as features are 0.72 and 0.69, respectively (Mu et al.,
2006). In contrast, the sensitivity and speciﬁcity scores for the
updated classiﬁer based on an RBF kernel and 54 atomic and 81
molecular properties as features are 0.81 and 0.86, respectively
(Supplementary Material S1).

As a ﬁnal comment on machine learning aspects of our work,
we wish to point out that the approach presented here and in
our earlier work (Mu et al., 2006) is a general approach that
can be applied to develop application—speciﬁc reaction prediction
systems. For example, this approach combined with training
data taken from, say, a database for biodegradation pathways
(Ellis et al., 2006) could be used to develop a system for
predicting reactions involved in the biodegradation of man—made
chemicals.

Our reaction prediction system is available via a web—based
application. This application takes as input a chemical structure
and uses a variety of software tools identiﬁed in Section 2
to calculate the various atomic and molecular properties that
must be determined to make predictions about the reactivity
of the compound. For applications, such as metabolomic data
analysis, additional software development will be needed. The
software that we have developed so far was built only with the
intention of evaluating the concept of combining expert knowledge,
computational chemistry and machine learning to improve the
accuracy of reaction prediction.

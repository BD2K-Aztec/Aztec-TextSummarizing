ABSTRACT

Motivation: The exponential growth of scientific literature has resulted
in a massive amount of unstructured natural language data that cannot
be directly handled by means of bioinformatics tools. Such tools gen-
erally require structured data, often generated through a cumbersome
process of manual literature curation. Herein, we present MyMiner, a
free and user-friendly text annotation tool aimed to assist in carrying
out the main biocuration tasks and to provide labelled data for the
development of text mining systems. MyMiner allows easy classifica-
tion and labelling of textual data according to user-specified classes
as well as predefined biological entities. The usefulness and efficiency
of this application have been tested for a range of real-life annotation
scenarios of various research topics.

1 INTRODUCTION

Scientiﬁc literature is one of the main sources of knowledge on
which working hypotheses are built. To organize and represent
biological information for researchers as well as for bioinfor-
matics analyses, many literature biocuration efforts have been
carried out (Howe et al., 2008). Their aim is to extract biologic-
ally relevant information from articles and transform it into
structured database records. With regard to the rapid literature
growth, text-mining efforts are becoming increasingly important
to speed up this process. Powerful infrastructures such as GATE
(General Architecture for Text Engineering) (Cunningham et al.,
2011) usually require a good degree of technical expertise and
sometimes even basic knowledge of computational linguistics,

making them challenging to use for biocuration purposes. To
develop text-mining systems, it is crucial to produce high-quality
labelled textual data that can serve as training and test datasets.
At present, most biomedical text mining applications/methods
utilize a restricted number of annotated text data (corpora) pre-
pared by biology domain experts. To help increasing this
number, we have implemented MyMiner, an online annotation
tool intended for expert biologists with no programming skills.
Compared to other applications [e.g. BRAT (Stenetorp et al.,
2012), PubTator WVei et al., 2012), Knowtator (Ogren, 2006),
NCBO Annotator (Jonquet et al., 2008) and DOMEO/SWAN
(Ciccarese et al., 2012) (Supplementary Table 2)], MyMiner pro-
vides within one single web-based application user interfaces to
classify documents, compare classiﬁcation efﬁciencies, detect
entities to annotate texts and link them to identiﬁers.

2 TOOL DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONALITY

MyMiner is an interactive web application based on a modular
design with the purpose to assist users in biocuration and text
annotation tasks. The MyMiner interface is intended to be
user-friendly, not requiring installation of any local software.
Each module has an export option for saving results. The time
spent for processing a document is recorded in the exported ﬁle.
To improve the user-friendliness, a common display layout has
been adopted and conserved between application modules. The
input document analysis area is located on the top of the page;
options and tools are placed below the main curation zone.
MyMiner combines PHP, JavaScript and AJAX to enhance
user interactivity. The core of the MyMiner system covers four
application modules that can be independently used or combined
together following the steps of a biocuration pipeline
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

MyMiner handles any plain text, including article abstracts,
document sentences, ontology terms or disease descriptions.

(l) The ‘File-labelling’ module is a simple to use manual text
classiﬁcation interface that allows classifying documents,
abstracts, sentences or terms, offering the possibility to
enter user-speciﬁed class labels. This module could be

used for instance to classify documents as either relevant
or not to a speciﬁc topic from a PubMed query. Its pur-
pose is to cover the triage task (article selection) carried
out by database annotators but it can also be used for any
manual classiﬁcation recording. The labelled data that
result from this classiﬁcation can serve as training and
test sets for text categorization systems. To reduce the
manual classiﬁcation time, it provides the option of dy-
namically setting positive and negative text highlights.
These are expressions that users can set at any time
during the tagging process to highlight text relevant
(marked in yellow) or non-relevant (marked in red) to
the topic of interest. The system offers the possibility to
upload the classiﬁcation guidelines so that the annotator
can refer to them when necessary. Users can pause and
resume the curation process at any time by saving the
classiﬁed document. To resume classiﬁcation, the saved
ﬁle is uploaded as input ﬁle. The time spent by a user to
select the corresponding label is recorded. This may be
useful to estimate the efﬁciency of annotators and the dif-
ﬁculty of the task.

The ‘Compare File’ module facilitates the direct compari-
son of collections of labelled items generated by several
approaches or persons. In addition, it is possible to
create subsets from these collections based on the agree-
ment or disagreement of annotation labels. This module
could be used to compare and evaluate document classiﬁ-
cation methods between various persons or softwares. It
displays a global summary with information covering: (i)
the number of documents within each class; (ii) the average
time needed to classify the text; (iii) the correlation be-
tween classiﬁcation time and text length or (iv) the
number of items tagged differently between annotators.
This module allows extracting a collection of texts
(known as a Gold Standard corpus) that have been
labelled consistently by all annotators. Alternatively, the
module can also be used to extract the borderline cases
tagged differently. Hasty/inaccurate annotations can be
detected from inter-annotator disagreements and/or a
poor correlation between document size versus classiﬁca-
tion time. These cases can then be used to reﬁne and im-
prove the classiﬁcation guidelines. The Compare File
module has been used to estimate consistency of manual
annotations between various individuals and methods
(Supplementary Data Section 2).

The purpose of the ‘Entity Tagging’ (entity mention rec-
ognition) module is to manually detect important concep-
tual objects within a document, a ﬁrst step for further
identiﬁcation of annotation events and relations to popu-
late knowledge databases. This module could be used to
create a corpus of gene and protein mentions to test and
train a Named Entity Recognition tool. This module offers
an interactive interface allowing users to semi-
automatically identify various kinds of entities within
documents. It has been designed as a WYSIWYG (What
You See Is What You Get) online editor that allows the
addition of user-speciﬁed labels for new entity types. For
the detection of important bio-entities, this module

provides the automatic recognition of proteins, DNA,
RNA, cell lines and cell types by integrating the
ABNER tagger (Settles, 2005). The LINNAEUS system
is incorporated into MyMiner to identify species and or-
ganisms (Gerner et al., 2010). Additionally, user-deﬁned
entities can be detected if terms-tags dictionaries are pro-
vided. To improve the accuracy of the annotations, tags
can be edited and wrongly generated labels can be
removed. To deﬁne simple relationships between entities
and terms, a matrix check box display was added to this
module (Supplementary Fig. S14).

(4) The ‘Entity Linking’ module facilitates the manual anno-
tation of bioentities mentioned in a document with stan-
dardized identiﬁers. This module could be used to
manually link articles to disease and protein identiﬁers to
create a catalogue of proteins involved in pathologies.
Gene/protein names are automatically recognized and dis-
played as a list that can be manually edited, and new
entities can be added and incorrectly identiﬁed ones can
be removed. For each gene/protein name, MyMiner sug-
gests a ranked list of UniProt identiﬁers that utilize the
UniProt search scoring mechanism (Arighi et al., 2011).
Species mentions are normalized to NCBI taxon identi-
ﬁers; OMIM identiﬁers are associated to diseases and
ontology terms are linked to identiﬁers from submitted
ontology ﬁles. For this purpose, MyMiner launches asyn-
chronous queries to respective databases (UniProt, NCBI
taxonomy, OMIM and user provided ontology ﬁle) using
AJAX requests. For organisms, proteins, diseases and
ontology terms, a short description is displayed to help
validate potential candidate hits and to assist during the
manual disambiguation of potential databases identiﬁers.
Check boxes allow the selection of the most appropriate
identiﬁers from the candidate list. If species are speciﬁed
prior to a protein identiﬁer search, species-speciﬁc con-
straints are applied to reduce the number of potential can-
didates from UniProt.

3 EVALUATION AND USER CASES
3.1 Evaluation

MyMiner was compared to manual text annotations generated
by unassisted or assisted human annotators (through a command
line script). This showed a decrease of annotation time (up to
90%, average 70%), with no change in the quality of annotation
(Supplementary Data Section 2 and Figs 2—13). MyMiner has
been evaluated, by the BioCreative User Advisory Group in
Biocreative III, Interactive Task (IAT) (Arighi et al., 2011).

3.2 User cases/usefulness

In the context of the BioCreative III competition, MyMiner was
utilized to label over 20 000 abstracts to prepare datasets for
protein interaction relevance (Krallinger et al., 2011), producing
the necessary datasets for the implementation of the protein
interaction information extraction (PIE) abstract retrieval
system (Kim et al., 2012). It can thus be applied to prepare

training data for document categorization and ranking applica-
tions such as MedlineRanker (F ontaine et al., 2009)
(Supplementary Fig. S15). MyMiner was used to validate
ranked lists of documents, terms and bio-entities for creating
reference sets for systems biology (Krallinger et al., 2009).
MyMiner was used in the muscle biology ﬁeld to create labelled
data for the extraction of mutations and gene regulation sen-
tences as well as to annotate experimental evidence cues
(Krallinger, 2010).

4 CONCLUSION

MyMiner is an online application designed to allow biologists
and non-IT experts to semi-automatically classify and annotate
(biomedical) information in text with the help of text-mining
tools. It allows validating these automatically generated results,
as it provides a simple interface to manipulate the recognized
bio-entities and permits the addition of new labels for manual
tagging. This system can be exploited to efﬁciently label text for
document classiﬁcation and prioritization tasks, for entity recog-
nition purposes and for manual annotation of relationships be-
tween entities. It has been used during various annotation efforts
by diverse groups of biomedical scientists. During the past 2
years, MyMiner has been used by 240 unique visitors.

On the MyMiner webpage we provide a comprehensive set of
related systems to point visitors to complementary software. The
MyMiner repository offers the possibility to host and share cor-
pora provided by the user community.

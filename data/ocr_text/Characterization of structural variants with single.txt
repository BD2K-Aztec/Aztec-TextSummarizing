ABSTRACT

Motivation: Structural variation is common in human and cancer gen-
omes. High-throughput DNA sequencing has enabled genome-scale
surveys of structural variation. However, the short reads produced by
these technologies limit the study of complex variants, particularly
those involving repetitive regions. Recent ‘third-generation’ sequen-
cing technologies provide single-molecule templates and longer
sequencing reads, but at the cost of higher per-nucleotide error rates.
Results: We present MultiBreak—SV, an algorithm to detect structural
variants (SVs) from single molecule sequencing data, paired read
sequencing data, or a combination of sequencing data from different
platforms. We demonstrate that combining low-coverage third-gener-
ation data from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) with high-coverage
paired read data is advantageous on simulated chromosomes. We
apply MultiBreak—SV to PacBio data from four human fosmids and
show that it detects known SVs with high sensitivity and specificity.
Finally, we perform a whole-genome analysis on PacBio data from a
complete hydatidiform mole cell line and predict 1002 high-probability
SVs, over half of which are confirmed by an Illumina-based assembly.

1 INTRODUCTION

Structural variation—including duplications, deletions, inser-
tions and translocations of genomic segments—are an important
source of variation in human and cancer genomes. Human
genomes differ by thousands of inherited structural variants
(SVs) (Quinlan and Hall, 2012), many of which have been
associated with genetic disorders and diseases (Hurles et al.,
2008; Mills et al., 2011; Xi et al., 2010). SVs have long been
recognized as a form of somatic mutations that drive the
development and progression of cancer (Choy et al., 2010;

Mardis, 2012). The continuing decline in sequencing costs for
next-generation DNA sequencing has made it the standard
technique for structural variation detection, largely replacing
microarrays and earlier cytogenetic techniques (Alkan et al.,
2011).

Most structural variation studies conducted on highly repeti-
tive mammalian genomes use a resequencing approach, where
reads from an individual genome are independently aligned to
a reference genome. Discrepancies between the expected and
observed alignments or the number of aligned reads suggest
potential SVs in the individual genome compared with the refer-
ence. Identifying SVs from short-read paired-end sequencing data
is complicated by a number of factors, including sequencing and
alignment errors, as well as repetitive sequences near SV bound-
aries (Korbel et al., 2007; Kidd et al., 2008).

To handle these obstacles, most methods detect structural vari-
ation by clustering fragments and assigning a higher conﬁdence
or score to the cluster if many fragments support the variant.
Early approaches for paired-end data simpliﬁed the issue of
repeats by either ignoring fragments that align to multiple loca-
tions in the reference or choosing a single ‘best’ alignment, break-
ing ties arbitrarily (Chen et al., 2009; Korbel et al., 2009; Sindi
et al., 2009). Methods that incorporate ambiguous alignments
for paired reads improved SV detection (Hormozdiari et al.,
2009, 2010; Lee et al., 2008; Quinlan et al., 2010); however,
these methods report a single set of predictions that usually in-
volves minimizing the total number of SVs. More recently,
GASVPro (Sindi et al., 2012) demonstrated the effectiveness of
a probabilistic model that considers many possible read map-
pings and incorporates both a paired-end and a read-depth
signal to reﬁne variant predictions. Additionally, some tools
have the capacity to analyze ‘split-reads’—correctly mapping
the read subsequences for reads spanning breakpoint junc-
tions—usually in the context of deletions or transcriptomic
data (Jiang et al., 2012; Kim and Salzberg, 2011; Rausch et al.,
2012; Stromberg, 2010; Trapnell et al., 2009). Despite these
improvements, existing methods are inherently limited by the
underlying sequencing technology; i.e. they often rely on explicit
assumptions about fragment length, error rate, and the number
of SVs that fragments imply.

Emerging single-molecule sequencing technologies—coined
‘third-generation’ technologies—from companies such as

Characterization of structural variants

 

Paciﬁc Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore are capable
of sequencing longer fragments than current sequencing technol-
ogies. For example, PacBio’s Single Molecule Real Time
(SMRT) sequencing generates reads greater than 7kb on aver-
age, with some reads exceeding 40Kb (Eid et al., 2009; Korlach
et al., 2010; Roberts et al., 2013). The beneﬁts of longer reads
come at a cost; per-base error rates of such technologies are
higher than next-generation sequencing technologies (~15%
for PacBio). While Oxford Nanopore has not yet launched a
commercial machine, early indications are that error rates will
be higher than the 1—2% rates of current short-read technologies.

The properties of third-generation technologies provide
unique opportunities and challenges for SV detection. A single
read may span multiple SVs in the sequenced genome, general-
izing the concept of split reads. Thus, standard assumptions of
observing a single breakpoint from a single read must be relaxed
as SVs are no longer independent from one another.
Additionally, protocols such as strobe sequencing which pro-
duced multiply-linked reads from a single fragment of DNA
(Turner, 2009), generalize the concept of paired-end sequencing.
Both long reads and multiply-linked reads provide increased
power to detect complex rearrangements with multiple nearby
SVs. However, higher error rates create ambiguity in assessing an
optimal alignment, making it necessary to consider a large set of
possible alignments. Accounting for both higher error rates and
multiple SVs leads to more subtle algorithmic concerns.

Previous work on SV prediction from single-molecule sequen-
cing data (in the context of strobe sequencing data) formulated
an optimization problem that aimed to minimize the number of
predicted SVs (Ritz et al., 2010). While strobes showed increased
speciﬁcity in SV predictions compared to paired-end sequencing,
the method suffered from a large false positive rate and was
never tested on real sequencing data. We propose a new algo-
rithm, MultiBreak-SV, which directly addresses the challenges of
high error rates and multiple SVs reported by a single read.
Rather than trying to ﬁnd a single solution and assignment for
the data, MultiBreak-SV employs a probabilistic approach that
considers all possible solutions. MultiBreak-SV is capable of
predicting variants from paired-end sequencing data, third-gen-
eration data, and data from a combination of sequencing plat-
forms. We benchmark MultiBreak—SV on simulated, highly-
repetitive chromosomes using long read sequencing, strobe
sequencing, paired-end sequencing and a mixture of strobe and
paired-end data. We then demonstrate the accuracy of
MultiBreak-SV on PacBio strobe sequencing data from four
fosmids containing known SVs. Finally, we perform a genome-
wide analysis on PacBio long read data to predict SVs from a cell
line derived from a complete hydatidiform mole.

2 METHODS

We model an individual genome generated from a reference genome by
independently deleting, duplicating and rearranging segments of the ref-
erence genome. We deﬁne a novel adjacency to be a pair of adjacent
coordinates in the individual genome that are not adjacent in the refer-
ence genome. The number of novel adjacencies in the individual genome
is related to the number of SVs: some variants, such as deletions, create
one adjacency whereas other variants, such as inversions, create two
adjacencies.

Fig. 1. Overview of MultiBreak-SV. (1) Five long reads are sequenced
from an individual genome. (2) The reads are aligned to the reference
genome, producing seven distinct multi-breakpoint-mappings. When
clustered, the multi-breakpoint-mappings indicate four novel adjacencies
(D1, D2, D3, D4). (3a) The quality of the read alignments (e.g. the edit
distance) is noted for each multi-breakpoint—mapping. (3b) The set of all
possible novel adjacencies {D1, D2, D3, D4} is represented as a cluster
diagram G, where the nodes are novel adjacencies and the directed
edges represent overlapping novel adjacencies. (4) The cluster diagram
and alignment qualities are input to MultiBreak-SV. (5a) MultiBreak-SV
assigns probabilities to each multi-breakpoint-mapping. (5b) From these
mappings, the probability of each novel adjacency is computed. A
solution to the Multi-Read Mapping Problem is a selection of at most
one alignment for each multi read and a selection of at most one novel
adjacency for each connected component in G (bold)

Sequenced fragments from the individual genome can be described as a
t-multi—reads consisting of an ordered list S=(R1, R2, . . . , R,) of ‘L’
contiguous substrings, or reads, from the individual genome. ‘L’ = 1
corresponds to single (long) reads, ‘L’ = 2 to paired-reads, and ‘L’ 2 2 to
strobes or multi-linked reads (Supplementary Section 1.1). When ‘L’ 2 2,
the reads are separated by regions of unknown sequences called advances.

To identify novel adjacencies, we align a set S of t—multi—reads from an
individual genome to a reference genome (Figure 1, Step 1). Aligning a
single read R, to the reference may result in full length alignments or, in
the case of split reads, alignments of substrings of R,. We deﬁne a t-multi—
breakpoint-mapping to be a multi-read that aligns to the reference genome
in t pieces, the pieces being non-overlapping substrings of the reads R,
(Supplementary Section 1.1). Generally, a multi-read S gives a multi-
breakpoint—mapping by selecting an alignment for each read. If the
alignment of each R, is full length, then a t-multi—read gives a t-multi-
breakpoint-mapping. However, in the case of long read fragments
we may have t2 ‘L’. In this case, we split the fragment into t-multi-
breakpoint-mappings with advance length 0.

Each fragment corresponds to a single segment of the individual
genome; we assume that this portion of the individual genome maps to

at most a single location in the reference. Thus, for multi-read S there is at
most one correct multi-breakpoint-mapping. Let A(S) be the set of all
multi-breakpoint-mappings for multi-read S, along with the empty set
(which indicates that the correct alignment is not present). The correct
multi-breakpoint-mapping for multi-read S is thus an element in A(S).
Selecting one element from A(S) for each multi-read in S produces a
candidate mapping M that describes the placement of every multi-read
in S. The goal of this work is to solve the following problem:

M ulti-Read Mapping Problem. Given a set S of multi-reads and their
corresponding multi-breakpoint-mappings, ﬁnd (1) an optimal map-
ping M *; that is, a selection of one element from A(S) for each S e S,
and (2) the set of novel adjacencies implied by M *.

When there are more than two reads (t> 2), there is a dependence
between pairs of consecutive reads, and thus direct application of paired-
read methods will not necessary yield a valid solution to the Multi-Read
Mapping Problem. For example, for a 3-multi-read (R1, R2, R3), the
alignments of the pairs (R1, R2) and (R2, R3), cannot be selected inde-
pendently: a single alignment of R2 must be chosen. MultiBreak-SV ﬁnds
highly-probable mappings and novel adjacencies to solve the Multi-Read
Mapping Problem (Fig. 1).

2.1 Implied adjacencies and the cluster diagram

For each read R,, every read alignment a provides (i) the interval [xm ya]
in the reference genome corresponding to the alignment location, (ii) the
orientation sign,, of the alignment, (iii) and the edit distance 6,, of the
alignment. Let 73 be all pairs of alignments from adjacent reads in each
multi-read, or the consecutive read pairs (Supplementary Section 1.2.1).
A consecutive read pair (a1, a2) 6 73 is concordant if the aligned distance
and orientation of the pair is expected given the sequencing platform and
parameters (Supplementary Sections 1.2—1.2.1). If (a1, a2) is not concord-
ant, then it is discordant and implies a novel adjacency in the individual
genome. Let Pdiscord g 73 be the set of discordant consecutive read pairs
(which we will call discordant pairs when the context is clear). When
‘L’ = 1 (in the case of long reads), Pdiscord =73 because full alignments
are considered concordant (Figure 1).

To accurately predict SVs, we must ﬁrst identify all possible candidate
novel adjacencies that arise from the set Pdiscord of discordant pairs. Let
N be the set of possible novel adj acencies determined from the discordant
pairs Pdiscord. N is determined by clustering discordant pairs whose align-
ments are consistent with the same novel adjacency (Fig. 1, Step 2). We
cluster discordant pairs using Geometric Analysis of Structural Variants
(GASV) (Sindi et al., 2009), an algorithm which identiﬁes candidate novel
adjacencies and provides a geometric representation of how the discord-
ant pairs contribute to each novel adjacency prediction (Supplementary
Section 1.3).

To solve the Multi-Read Mapping Problem, we must ensure that the
novel adjacencies implied by M do not conﬂict; that is, each discordant
pair supports at most one novel adjacency. We capture the organization of
these ‘conﬂicting’ novel adjacency predictions using a directed graph
G called a cluster diagram (Figure 1, Step 3b). Nodes in G represent can-
didate novel adj acencies and edges represent pairs of candidate adjacencies
that have one or more discordant pairs in common. A solution of the
Multi-Read Mapping Problem includes at most one node from each con-
nected component in the cluster diagram. G is computed as a preprocessing
step using an efﬁcient line-sweep algorithm (Supplementary Section 1.3).

2.2 Probabilistic model

We will now describe a probabilistic model for a mapping M given the
data D which consists of (i) the multi-breakpoint—mappings A(S) = USES
A(S) and (ii) the cluster diagram G. We provide a high-level description
here; refer to Supplementary Section 1.4 for the full model. Our goal is to
compute P(M ID), the probability of a mapping M given the data. After

applying Bayes’ Rule, the probability of D given M includes the condi-
tional probability of the selected multi-breakpoint-mappings A(S) and
the conditional probability of the novel adjacencies G (the cluster dia-
gram).

P(DIM)P(M) = P(A(S)IM)P(GIM)P(M).

P(M'D) 2 H0) H0)

A mapping M can be partitioned into the set A(lll) of read alignments
in M and the number eM of missing alignments (empty sets):

P(A(S)IM) = P(A(M), 8M) = P(A(M))P(eM)-

The probability P(A(ll4)) of the read alignments depends on the error
rates and fragment lengths of the sequencing technology. For a mapping
M, let €(M) be the total edit distance and all!) be the total length of all
read alignments in M. We use a binomial distribution to model the prob-
ability of observing €(M) errors in a string of length £(ll4) when the
sequencing error is pseq. We assume the missed alignments occur inde-
pendently with a ﬁxed probability pm. To compute P(Gllll), we ﬁnd the
smallest number of nodes in the cluster diagram G that cover the discord-
ant pairs in M (Supplementary Section 1.3). The alignments in M are
partitioned into the selected novel adjacencies; the number of mappings
for each node is called the support. Let the non-zero supports be a vector
d>(M). We model the expected support of a novel adjacency as a Poisson
process with parameter A, = ALavg(t — 1) where A is the sequence cover-
age, t is the number of reads in the multi-read, and Lavg is the average
advance length. P(M ID) in Equation (1) now becomes

[Bin(e(M); ampseqnaﬂ H Poissac; Ad)]P(M)
ke<I>(M)

 

with hyperparameters pseq, pm, and Ad, and a uniform prior P(lll) over
all mappings. The hyperparameters can be prespeciﬁed or inferred from
the read alignments. We have generalized the model to include multiple
sequencing technologies (e.g. strobes and pairs), allowing for multiple
hyperparameters (Supplementary Section 1.7).

2.3 Markov chain Monte Carlo method

The probability in Equation (2) is prohibitive to compute due to the large
number of possible mappings M. However, we still want to consider the
distribution of mapping probabilities for the data rather than simply
ﬁnding a mapping M that maximizes P(M|D). To achieve this,
MultiBreak-SV employs a Metropolis—Hastings algorithm to sample
mappings M with probability proportional to P(M ID) (Figure 1, Step
4). MultiBreak-SV takes the set A(S) of alignments and a cluster diagram
G and samples mappings M for z iterations with probability asymptotic-
ally proportional to P(M ID). MultiBreak-SV explores the solution space
via two types of moves: a local move that changes the assignment of a
single multi-read and a ‘jump’ move that changes the assignment of many
multi-reads at one time (Supplementary Section 1.5).

Since the number of possible mappings grows exponentially with the
number of multi-breakpoint-mappings, the Markov chain may take an
extremely long time to converge. Fortunately, since novel adjacencies are
independent, we divide S into independent subproblems for which
MultiBreak-SV can be run in parallel (Supplementary Section 1.5.3).
This independence observation was made by (Sindi et al., 2012) to
make the problem tractable for GASVPro on paired-end data. We
run each problem from 2 to 20 million iterations depending on the sub-
problem size.

2.3.] Computing adjacency probabilities To solve the Multi-Read
Mapping Problem, we predict novel adjacencies (nodes in the cluster
diagram G) from the mapping probabilities. We calculate the probability

of the multi-breakpoint-mappings in order to derive an adjacency prob-
ability for each node in the cluster diagram G (Figure 1, Step 5). First, for
every multi-read S we compute the probability of each multi-breakpoint-
mapping a e A(S) by summing over probabilities of the mappings M that
contain a (Supplementary Section 1.6). Then, for every node in G we
compute the probability that the node is supported by k or more multi-
breakpoint—mappings for a ﬁxed value of k (Supplementary Section 1.6).
Finally, we choose the node with the highest probability in each con-
nected component of G as a predicted novel adjacency.

2.4 Datasets and algorithms for comparison

2.4.1 Simulated datasets Following other methods (Chen et al.,
2009; Ritz et al., 2010; Sindi et al., 2012), we constructed an individual
chromosome, VENTER, by including ~17 000 adjacencies (including dele-
tions, insertions and inversions) from HuRef into th8 chr17 (Levy et al.,
2007). From these rearrangements, we evaluated 124 deletions greater
than 120 bp (detectable deletions) and four inversions. We focused on
deletions greater than 120 bp to account for uncertainty (:I:60 bp) in frag-
ment lengths for multi-reads with ‘L’ 2 2 (Ritz et al., 2010). We also con-
structed a chromosome with hundreds of novel adjacencies inserted from
individuals from the 1000 Genomes project individuals into chrl (1000
Genomes Project Consortium, 2010) and evaluated 511 deletions greater
than 120 bp. We found notable differences in performance between the
two simulations; see Supplementary Section 2.2 for a detailed discussion
of 1000 Genomes simulation.

To simulate PacBio’s strobe platform, we generated 3-multi-reads with
normally distributed read lengths (mean:l: SD 322:I: 134, 360 :I: 130,
359 :I: 142) and advance lengths (1214:I:40, 1171 :I: 40) determined from
the fosmid sequencing data described below, and inserted 15% error
using Alchemy (Chaisson, 2012). To simulate Short-read Illumina-like
platforms, we generated two multi-reads with exactly 100 bp reads and
normally distributed advance lengths (mean 400), inserted 1% error into
the reads using wgsim (Li et al., 2009). We call the simulated strobe
datasets STROBES, the simulated paired datasets PAIRS. We also combined
STROBES with PAIRS datasets to produce HYBRID datasets.

We aligned all PAIRS data with BWA version 0.6.2 (Li and Durbin,
2009) and all STROBES data with BLASR (Chaisson and Tesler, 2012)
using default values, taking full alignments for each read and determining
discordant pairs from the resulting multi-breakpoint—mappings. BWA
retains a single, unique alignment for each paired-read; we found that
including multiple alignments for a read in the paired dataset decreased
performance (Supplementary Section 2.3). We ﬁxed pseq = 0.15 for
PacBio data, pseq =0.01 for PAIRS data, and perr =0.01 for all datasets.
The choice of Ad depends on the sequencing coverage (Supplementary
Table 1).

To simulate PacBio’s long read sequencing platform, we generated
one-multi—reads whose lengths were exponentially distributed with
mean 3.4 kb (approximating PacBio performance at the time of data
generation), inserted 15% error using Alchemy, and aligned the reads
using BLASR. We processed the alignments in two ways.

1. Determine multi-breakpoint—mappings from partial alignments. We con-
struct a set of t—multi-breakpoint-mappings (for t Z 2) from the align-
ments to the reference. We do this by building a directed acyclic graph
with vertices corresponding to the alignments and edges corresponding to
allowed discordant pairs between alignments (according to the coordin-
ates in the long read). Traversing this graph in a depth-ﬁrst manner
produces potential multi-breakpoint-mappings; we retain multi-
breakpoint—mappings that include at least 80% of the original long
read. This construction is analogous to split read alignment approaches
(Abyzov and Gerstein, 2011; Jiang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011); how-
ever here we permit the read to split into more than two pieces and do not
require that the pieces partition the entire read. The latter is important as

repetitive sequences at the breakpoint sometimes lead to overlapping and/
or incomplete partial alignments.

2. Determine potential deletion coordinates within full alignments. We
observed that BLASR often aligned across deletion coordinates in the
reference with a gap. Further, the BLASR-reported coordinates of the
gaps did not accurately reﬂect the deletion novel adjacencies. Thus, we
reﬁned the multi-read mapping coordinates reported by BLASR using a
three-state (deletion, match/mismatch, insertion) hidden Markov model
(HMM). For the match state emission probabilities, we ﬁt a 20% error
(symmetrically for insertions and deletions), thus 0.8 probability of
emitting a match state. For insertions and deletions, we used a 0.9 prob-
ability of emitting their respective states. We allowed a 0.01 probability of
transition from insertion and deletion states to a match state and a strict
1 x 10‘10 probability to transition from a match state to either insertion
or deletion states. Initialization and termination states were both enforced
to be match states, and the Viterbi path was selected to identify potential
insertions and deletions. We found that deletion coordinates called in this
manner were more accurate than the original BLASR gap coordinates.
Each deletion greater than 200 bp called in this manner was considered a
two multi-breakpoint—mapping.

We also ignored multi-breakpoint-mappings near telomeres/centro-
meres, and converted multi-breakpoint—mappings to discordant pairs by
taking the outer coordinates in the case that the BLASR alignments
aligned across the breakpoint (which occurs in highly repetitive regions).
More details about the two steps above and the ﬁltering are in the
Supplementary Section 1.8.1. We call the simulated long read dataset
LONG.

2.4.2 PacBio Data We sequenced four human fosmids (two harbor-
ing a deletion, two harboring an inversion) from individual NA15510
(Kidd et al., 2008) (Supplementary Section 2.4). The fosmids were
sequenced using an early prototype PacBio machine; two SMRT cells
were used for each inversion compared with one SMRT cell for each
deletion. We performed a robustness analysis by varying perr and Ad.

We also obtained 10 x coverage of publicly-available long read data of
the human CHMlTERT cell line from PacBio (Paciﬁc Biosciences, 2013).
We used the LONG processing pipeline described above with one pre-
processing step before executing Step 1: we ignored any long read
where 80% of the read aligned contiguously to the reference. We also
ensured that the alignment did not contain a large deletion by requiring
that the coordinates in the reference must be within 20% of the long read
length. We used the same perr and pseq as in the simulations. To estimate
Ad, we determined the coverage of long read alignments to chr20. There
are 78 121 long reads that have over 80% aligning to chr20; the average
length of these long reads is about 6500. Dividing the total number of
bases in these reads by the size of chr20 yields a Ad of 8.06 (Supplementary
Table 1).

2.4.3 Illumina assembly We compare CHMlTERT to a reference-
guided CHMlTERT assembly (NCBI BioProject PRJNA178030). An
initial assembly was generated from 38 x coverage Illumina HiSeq2000
aligned to hg19; the assembly was then reﬁned using 400 BAC clones for
CHMlTERT. We mapped the coordinates in the reference (hg19) to the
CHMlTERT assembly by aligning each chromosome assembly to the
corresponding chromosome in th9 using nucmer (Delcher et al.,
2002). We retained alignments greater than 7kb and alignments that
had a one-to-one query-to-reference mapping. This was achieved with
the delta-ﬁlter ‘—1’ option, which maps each position of the query to
the best hit in the reference and vice versa. We use the alignments to
map novel adjacency coordinates to the assembly.

2.4.4 Algorithms for comparison We compared MultiBreak-SV to
GASV version 2.0 (Sindi et al., 2009), Hydra version 0.5.3 (Quinlan et al.,
2010), VariationHunter version 3.0 alormozdiari et al., 2009), Delly

3 RESULTS

3.1 Venter Simulation

We evaluated the ability of MultiBreak-SV to predict SVs from
the VENTER simulated chromosome and compared MultiBreak-
SV predictions to other state-of-the-art variant-calling methods.
We ﬁrst assessed the accuracy in recovering deletions and inver-
sions, and then assessed the accuracy of selecting the correct
multi-breakpoint-mapping for each multi-read.

3.1.1 Deletion calling accuracy A predicted novel adjacency is a
true positive (TP) variant that reﬂects deletion (x, y) if there
exists a pair of novel adjacency coordinates (a, b) such that a
is within Lmax/2 of x and b is within Lmax/2 of y (‘double-
uncertainty metric’ (Sindi et al., 2009)); otherwise it is a false
positive (FP). For each method applied to each dataset, varied
a parameter that thresholds the number of predictions
(Supplementary Table 3) to produce a ranked list of predicted
novel adjacencies. From this ranked list, we computed a receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the algorithm’s
performance on 124 deletions from the Venter simulation
(Figure 2 Left). Of the 124 deletions, 112 (90.32%) have repeti-
tive sequence spanning both of the novel adjacency coordinates;
this set is a good representative of variants that lie in repetitive
regions. Further, multi-breakpoint-mappings that span these de-
letions are not necessarily the best BLASR hit (Supplementary
Section 2.1). MultiBreak—SV on 5 x STROBES predicts more TP
variants than any other dataset up to six false positives; after this
point MultiBreak-SV on 2x/30x HYBRID is comparable to 5 x
STROBES MultiBreak-SV. Notably, all methods applied to the
STROBES datasets improve over all methods applied to 30x
PAIRS, where predictions from 30x PAIRS incur four times the

MultiBreak-SV on 5x STROBES over the previously-published
parsimony method at all values of speciﬁcity, predicting an
additional 8—28 TP variants. MultiBreak-SV applied to 5x
LONG data has increased sensitivity compared to 30x PAIRS up
to 17 false positives, at which point GASVPro on 30x PAIRS is
comparable.

3.1.2 Inversion calling accuracy Inversions in human genomes
are often difﬁcult to identify from sequencing data because their
adjacency coordinates tend to lie in repetitive regions (Antonacci
et al., 2009). There are four inversions in the Venter simulation,
which were evaluated using the double-uncertainty metric as
above. MultiBreak—SV on the STROBES and HYBRID dataset pre-
dicts all four inversions, while MultiBreak-SV on 30x PAIRS de-
tects only two (Table 1). Inversions 1 and 4 were each supported
by only a single strobe in the dataset. Thus, MultiBreak—SV
incurs 50 false positives when predicting Inversion 4 due to the
poor alignment quality of the supported mapping (error rate of
23%). Inversion 1 is predicted with only 6 false positives because
the alignment quality of this supported mapping is higher (error
rate of 17%).

3.1.3 Mapping accuracy We called a predicted multi-read map-
ping a TP if there is at least an 80% overlap between the reported
alignment to the reference genome and the true location. Since
there are a different number of TP mappings for each dataset, we
compute the precision and recall for each method rather than the
ROC curve (Fig. 2 Right). Strikingly, MultiBreak-SV on 5X
STROBES has mapping precision of 0.9 between recall of 0.05
and 0.5, where it gradually drops to 0.77. All other methods
maintain a precision of about 0.8 after a recall of 0.2. This sug-
gests that MultiBreak-SV on 5 x STROBES enriches for a larger
proportion of TP mappings than other methods. Note that
MultiBreak-SV on HYBRID is comparable to MultiBreak—SV on

3.2 Sequenced fosmids from NA15510

Motivated by the promising performance of MultiBreak-SV in
detecting variants on simulated data sets, we generated strobe
sequencing data for four fosmids from individual NA15510 that
were previously reported to contain SVs (Kidd et al., 2008).
Before selecting fosmids from individual NA15510 for sequen-
cing, we evaluated the detectability of the reported variants for
the 63 fully sequenced fosmids (44 deletions and 19 inversions)
from this study (Kidd et al., 2008). To identify candidates for
strobe sequencing, we simulated 30x STROBES and 30x PAIRS
datasets and selected two deletions supported by Z 5 strobes
and Z 5 pairs (D1 and D2). Additionally, we selected two inver-
sions that were supported by Z 5 strobes but not pairs (11 and
I2) (Supplementary Section 2.4).

MultiBreak—SV predicts the correct adjacency for all parameter
choices in both deletions (Table 2; Supplementary Section 2.4).
Deletions in D1 were predicted with no false positives for all
parameter choices and similarly one false positive for D2. While
both inversions were predicted using MultiBreak-SV, a number of
false positives were also predicted. This was not surprising, since
the breakpoints of the inversions lie in segmental duplications and
the majority of the multi-breakpoint-mappings were ambiguous
alignments (95% for 11 and 90% for I2 and Supplementary
Section 2.4). Interestingly, although 12 has higher sequence simi-
larity near the breakpoints than 11 (99% vs. 95%), the prediction
of I2 incurs fewer false positives than 11 (Table 2).

3.3 Sequenced CHMlTERT genome

We applied MultiBreak-SV to third-generation sequencing data
of CHMlTERT, a haploid cell line derived from a complete
hydatidiform mole (Paciﬁc Biosciences, 2013). CHMlTERT

was sequenced to 10x coverage, producing over 300 000
multi-breakpoint-mappings for input to MultiBreak-SV
(Supplementary Table 2).

3.3.1 Running time of MultiBreak—S V There were nearly
250 000 GASV clusters from the multi-breakpoint-mappings,
orders of magnitude larger than the number of SVs one would
expect from a human genome compared to HuRef hg19. Nearly
90% of the are clusters supported by only one long read, indicat-
ing a spurious alignment. The GASV clusters could be divided
into 131 594 independent subproblems, allowing for paralleliza-
tion. About 122 294 (93%) of the subproblems contained six or
fewer discordant pairs; we explicitly computed the probability for
every possible solution, which took at most 10 s. Most of the
remaining 9300 subproblems took about a minute to run
(Supplementary Figure 15). The largest subproblem took
~4.75 days, and included 535 clusters of all types (deletions,
inversions and translocations). All 1962 fragments in this sub-
problem contained a multi-breakpoint-mapping to a highly rear-
ranged region of chr16 q11.2; this region is responsible for the
dependence of all fragments in the subproblem. We have
removed this subproblem from the subsequent analysis.

3.3.2 Novel adjacencies predicted by MultiBreak-
S V MultiBreak-SV returns the posterior probability of every
multi-breakpoint-mapping; we use these probabilities to compute
the probability than an adjacency is supported by k or more
multi-breakpoint-mappings (see Methods and Supplementary
Section 1.6). When we compute the probability that an adjacency
is supported by any multi-breakpoint—mapping (k = 1), 242 395
(98%) of the GASV clusters have an adjacency probability of
less than 0.01. These clusters consist of multi-reads that are more
often assigned an error rather than a mapping, and are consistent
with the observation of spurious alignments in the GASV clus-
ters. The remaining adjacency probabilities Z 0.01 are shown in
Figure 3. Most of the high-probability (P 2 0.9) predicted adja-
cencies are deletions, while more inversions and translocations
appear with lower probabilities. Since we used two methods to
determine deletion breakpoints, the deletions are better charac-
terized than the other types of novel adjacencies in our analysis.
When we compute the probability of adjacencies supported by
k = 5 or more mappings, there are 1034 adjacencies with a prob-
ability 2001; 1002 with a probability 20.9 (Fig. 3). Again, there
are more deletions than other types of adjacencies; however we

3.3.3 Comparison of predicted deletions to Illumina-based
assembly We compared the 997 deletions with adjacency prob-
ability greater than 0.9 for k = 5 to a CHMlTERT reference-
guided assembly using Illumina data (see Methods). A predicted
deletion in the reference with coordinates (a, b) is confirmed if
there is an assembly-to-reference alignment within 100 bp of a,
an assembly-to-reference alignment within 100 bp of b, and the
two alignments are within 10bp of each other in the assembly
(Supplementary Section 2.5 . 1). Otherwise, we map a and b to the
assembly using the assembly alignments, producing coordinates
a’ and b’ . A predicted deletion in the reference with coordinates
(a, b) is proposed if the length b — a in the reference is within
80% of the length b’ — a’ in the assembly (Supplementary
Section 2.5.1).

About 552 (55%) of the deletions are conﬁrmed by the assem-
bly; this number increases to 581 when the coordinates a and b
are within 100 bp of each other. An example of a conﬁrmed
deletion is shown in Figure 4(B). The large proportion of con-
ﬁrmed deletions is striking due to the differences between the two
analyses in terms of sequencing platforms (PacBio versus
Illumina) and the means of variant detection (resequencing
versus genome assembly). Of the remaining 445 deletions, 128
(29%) are proposed deletions in the assembly (Figure 4(C) and
Supplementary Tables 7—9). These predicted deletions suggest
that the novel adjacency coordinates should be next to each
other in the assembly, similar to Figure 4(B).

4 DISCUSSION

As long read technologies become more practical for large-scale
genome sequencing, there is a clear need for methods that
take advantage of these reads while allowing for the
higher single-nucleotide error rates in current long read technol-
ogies. In addition, methods that integrate these datasets with
existing short read data are also a priority. MultiBreak-SV
helps address this need using a probabilistic model that
considers many possible alternative alignments for each read.
MultiBreak-SV additionally provides a natural framework for

identifying SVs across multiple platforms. We have bench-
marked MultiBreak-SV on multiple types of simulated sequen-
cing data and compared it to other state-of-the-art variant
detection algorithms designed for paired read and multi-read
data. We have put forth a pipeline for identifying multi-
breakpoint-mappings from long reads, enabling novel adjacency
prediction from long read data. Here, we have shown that
MultiBreak—SV not only outperforms current approaches using
data from a single platform, but also enables hybrid approaches
that combine data from multiple sequencing platforms.

We applied MultiBreak—SV to whole-genome sequencing data
from CHMlTERT, a human cell line derived from a complete
hydatidiform mole, which a target for a high-quality ‘platinum’
genome assembly (Paciﬁc Biosciences, 2013). While probabilistic
approaches such as MultiBreak-SV are powerful, they are more
time-consuming than the parsimony-based methods we compare
to (Hormozdiari et al., 2009; Quinlan et al., 2010; Ritz et al.,
2010; Rausch et al., 2012). We have demonstrated that parallel
processing of the data makes MultiBreak-SV feasible the
CHMlTERT analysis. To evaluate our resulting predictions,
we compare them to novel adjacencies found in an Illumina-
based CHMlTERT assembly. We acknowledge that this assem-
bly may be incorrect and incomplete, thus we do not treat it as a
gold standard. Identifying a subset of the high-probability novel
adjacencies that may be used to augment the existing assembly
remains future work. Finally, since CHMlTERT is haploid, we
suspect that it is considerably easier to identify variants since
there should be no heterozygous events. It will be important to
evaluate MultiBreak-SV on PacBio long read data generated
from a diploid human genome when the data becomes available.

One of the challenges in single-molecule sequencing technolo-
gies is dealing with a higher per-nucleotide error rate. By con-
sidering many possible alignments for each read and constructing
a model which incorporates the error rate, as well as the expected
support for an adjacency, we are able to take advantage of the
length of the read while mitigating false positives due to high
error rates. This trade-off appears to be inherent to single mol-
ecule technologies. Upcoming technologies, such as Oxford
Nanopore, have suggested they can achieve read lengths greater
than 10 kb with per-base costs similar to short read technologies
(Brown, 2012; Jaffe, 2014), and read lengths from PacBio con-
tinue to increase while maintaining similar error proﬁles.

Detecting multiple breakpoints from the same DNA fragment
is not a strategy limited to single-molecule sequencing platforms.
Recent advances, such as long fragment read (LF R) technology,
allow short read sequencing platforms to mimic long reads
(Peters et al., 2012). The ‘Inﬁnipair’ technique holds the potential
of obtaining multiple linked short reads from a single sequence
fragment by inducing an electrical ﬁeld over Illumina ﬂow cells
(Schwartz, 2012). These advances in short read platforms further
motivate the need for designing algorithms for fragments with
more than two sequenced reads (t-multi-reads with ‘L'>2).

Sensitive alignment procedures to ﬁnd ambiguous alignments
from long reads and multi-reads are important for discovering
high-quality predictions. Many structural variation methods pro-
pose tiered alignment strategies to ﬁnd ambiguous alignments
(Sindi et al., 2012; Quinlan et al., 2010; Hormozdiari et al.,
2009); however we found that these strategies drastically
increased the total number of ambiguous alignments to consider,

effectively “drowning out” the signal from true variants
(Supplementary Section 2.3). Ultimately, more sensitive align-
ment pipelines will improve SV prediction from multi-breakpoint
reads. The HMM for identifying breakpoints within completely-
spanning BLASR alignments is one step towards this goal.

Complex SVs with multiple, co-located breakpoints have been
observed in both normal and cancer genomes (Sharp et al., 2006;
Malhotra et al., 2013). Given the complexity of structural
variation observed in humans, the ability to detect multiple
breakpoints on a single read is becoming increasingly critical.
In 2—3% of all cancer genomes (and up to 25% in some cancers)
speciﬁc chromosomal regions are seen to be greatly enriched for
nearby rearrangements via a process known as chromothripsis
(Korbel and Campbell, 2013). As researchers delve into increas-
ingly complex regions of the genome (with multiple co-located
rearrangements and/or dense repeat structure), probabilistic
methods that can assign conﬁdence to each call, while integrating
orthogonal sequencing platforms, will become a necessity. Our
method, MultiBreak—SV, provides a generalized framework for
such approaches.

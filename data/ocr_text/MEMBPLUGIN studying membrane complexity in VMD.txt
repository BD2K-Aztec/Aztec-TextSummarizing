ABSTRACT

Summary: Computer simulations are giving way to more complex and
accurate studies of biological membranes by molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. The analysis of MD trajectories comprises the bio-
physical characterization of membrane properties or the study of pro-
tein—lipid interactions and dynamics. However, there is a lack of
automated tools to analyse MD simulations of complex membrane
or membrane-protein systems. Here we present MEMBPLUGIN, a
plugin for the Visual Molecular Dynamics package that provides algo-
rithms to measure a host of essential biophysical properties in simu-
lated membranes. MEMBPLUGIN features are accessible both
through a user-friendly graphical interface and as command-line pro-
cedures to be invoked in analysis scripts.

Availability and implementation: MEMBPLUGIN is a VMD extension
written in Tcl. Multi-platform source code, documentation and tutorials
are freely available at http://membplugin.sourceforge.net.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although membrane lipids were previously thought to only play
a passive role in cellular processes, it is now known that they
actively modulate key cell membrane complexes such as lipid
rafts (Simons and Gerl, 2010). As a result, some lipids can regu-
late protein functionality (daCosta et al., 2013; Sadiq et al., 2013)
and some are involved in severe diseases (Fabelo et al., 2011).
The experimental and computational study of membrane lipids is
an emergent field of research (van Meer et al., 2008); thanks to
the refinement of lipid force field parameters, modern membrane
simulations and analysis tools (Supplementary Table Sl) are able
to yield accurate biophysical properties close to experimental
values (Klauda et al., 2010; Jo et al., 2009) and observables
that would otherwise be out of reach of experimental techniques.

Here we describe MEMBPLUGIN, an extension to the free
molecular visualization program Visual Molecular Dynamics

ties of membranes and membrane—protein interactions via mo-
lecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

2 METHODS AND FEATURES

The first release of MEMBPLUGIN provides five different com-
ponents for the analysis of planar bilayers, namely, the Order
Parameters, Membrane Thickness, Lipid Interdigitation, Area per
Lipid and T ilt Angle tools (Fig. 1A).

(1) The SCD Order Parameter tool (Fig. 1B) calculates the
carbon—deuterium order parameter, a value typically
derived in NMR experiments that reﬂects the orientational
mobility of each C—H bond along the aliphatic lipid tails,
and thus membrane ﬂuidity (Vermeer et al., 2007):
SCD = —% (3 0032 6 — l), where 6 is the instantaneous
angle between the C—H bond and the bilayer normal.

(2) The Membrane Thickness tool measures the distance w
between two density peaks along with the location of the
middle point between them, 20, formalized as the first and
second central moment of the mass density profile of a
chosen atom (i.e. phosphorus) along the membrane
normal. In addition, this tool can interpolate the lipid
head’s positions to compute a 2D thickness map, which
provides an average overview of the local membrane de-
formation along the simulation (Fig. 1C and D).

(3) The Lipid Interdigitation tool computes three different acyl
chain interdigitation measures, namely, I p, M2,, and IC. I p is
a correlation-based fraction that evaluates the overlap of
the two leaflets’ mass distributions along the membrane
normal: I?) = 4 f pa(z),0b(z)dz/ f [pa(z) —I— ,ob(z)]2dz, where
pa and ,0], represent the mass density profiles for each of
the leaflets. The definition ensures that 0 g 1,, g 1 (no to
complete mass overlap). wp is defined as the second central
moment of papb, indicates the width of the mass distribu-
tions overlap region. Finally, IC is a coordination-based
fraction built by counting the number of atoms that are in
contact with the opposite leaﬂet; contacts are defined geo-
metrically for a chosen set of atoms and cut-off distance
(e. g. 4A between heavy atoms).

(4) The Area per Lipid tool (Fig. 1E) calculates both the total
area per lipid and the area per lipid of each lipid species of

tilt angle distributions for two different membrane systems: UNSAT, rich in unsaturates and SAT, rich in saturates. The R ggplot2 library (W ickham,

2009) was used to render plots (E) and (F) out of MEMBPLUGIN’s output

the membrane under analysis. To this end, it uses a user-
customizable selection of one key atom (e.g. sterols) or a
triad of atoms (e. g. phospho- or sphingolipids). The x and y
coordinates of the former set of points are projected onto a
plane delimited by the simulation box, which is subse-
quently divided into polygons through a Voronoi diagram
using the qv0r0n0i program from the Qhull package (Barber
et al., 1996). Thereby, the area of each polygon is calculated.

(5) Finally, the Tilt Angle tool (Fig. 1F) computes the angle 6
between any user-defined vector (i.e. two atoms per lipid
species) and the membrane normal.

MEMBPLUGIN is used within VMD either in a mouse-
driven interactive fashion, or procedurally in user-written scripts.
(i) Interactively: after installation, the plugin becomes available in
VMD’s Analysis menu. MEMBPLUGIN’S manager provides
access to the analysis tools (Fig. 1A) and the corresponding
tool-speciﬁc settings (e.g. the set of atoms making up the lipids
for the system at hand). (ii) Procedurally: consistent with VMD’s
framework, each tool can be invoked as a Tcl command.
Therefore, scripts have access to the analytical features that
enable construction of complex workﬂows in a high-level
language.

3 CONCLUSION

MEMBPLUGIN automates the analysis of simulated lipid
bilayers through the calculation and visualization of a variety

of biophysical parameters commonly used in membrane and
membrane-protein simulations. It is worth noting that this first
release of MEMBPLUGIN provides convenient access to both
standard (e.g. order parameter, thickness maps) and novel algo-
rithms (e.g. measures of interdigitation). Despite the fact that
MD results are limited by the accuracy of simulations and thus
must be interpreted with caution, especially in large heteroge-
neous systems, they can provide good estimations of parameters
otherwise not measurable in experiments.

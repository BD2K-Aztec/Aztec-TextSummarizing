Abstract

Summary: Isotope tracer experiments are an invaluable technique to analyze and study the metab-
olism of biological systems. However, isotope labeling experiments are often affected by naturally
abundant isotopes especially in cases where mass spectrometric methods make use of derivatiza-
tion. The correction of these additive interferences—in particular for complex isotopic systems—is
numerically challenging and still an emerging field of research. When positional information is
generated via collision-induced dissociation, even more complex calculations for isotopic interfer-
ence correction are necessary. So far, no freely available tools can handle tandem mass spectrom-
etry data. We present isotope correction toolbox, a program that corrects tandem mass isotopomer
data from tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Isotope correction toolbox is written in the
multi-platform programming language Perl and, therefore, can be used on all commonly available
computer platforms.

1 Introduction

Isotope labeling experiments play a crucial role in exploring, study-
ing and understanding metabolic pathways in biological systems.
However, the obtained isotopolog and tandem mass isotopomer sig-
nals are biased by natural abundant isotopes of the native molecules
and of atoms introduced via derivatization (Antoniewicz, 2013).
Consequently, the natural abundance results in a distortion of the
experimental data. The correction of mass spectrometry data is still
an emerging field of research (Carreer et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2013;
Moseley, 2010; Rantanen et al., 2002; van Winden et al., 2002;
Wittman and Heinzle, 1999), as it is non-trivial and numerically
challenging, in particular, if a large number of isotopes are con-
sidered during the correction procedure. There exist several software
tools which are able to compute the contribution of intensities from
the natural abundant isotopes on the measured intensities and hence

are capable to correct the measured data. Pynac (Carreer et al.,
2013) (http://files.cesb.uky.edu/software/PYNAC/) is a correction
software written in the programming language Python. Pynac bene-
fits from the multi-platform capabilities of Python is highly flexible
by using text files for configuration and setup and can account for
any number of isotopes. However, it is not able to correct data from
tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Another prominent avail-
able program is IsoCor (Millard et al., 2012) (http://metasys.insa
toulouse.fr/software/isocorl). IsoCor is also implemented in Python
and is a fast and excellent tool to correct mass spectrometry data. It
supports the correction of the natural abundance of the tracer at un-
labeled positions and allows to take into account the isotopic purity
of the labeling source. Furthermore, in IsoCor, any isotope and not
only 13C can be used as tracer. Though IsoCor is also not able to
deal with tandem mass isotopomer data. In this application note, we

present a novel software tool named isotope correction
toolbox (ICT), which is also able to deal with ion fragmentation
and, hence, can correct mass spectra obtained by tandem mass
spectrometry.

2 Methods

I CT is written in the programming language Perl. Perl runs on all
commonly available operating system, such as Linux/Unix, BSD,
Mac OS and Windows. Hence, I CT can be used on virtually all com-
puter platforms. I CT is a command line tool. The input data (chem-
ical composition of the fragments and the measured intensities) must
be given in form of plain text files. After the execution of I CT, the
corrected data are provided to the user as text files, as well. The
main features of I CT are as follows:

0 I CT can correct tandem mass spectrometry data.

° I CT supports a batch execution mode which allows to quickly
correct many experimental datasets in a single run.

° Any labeling source can be used with I CT.

° Any element and number of isotopes can be considered with
I CT.

° I CT can account for effects caused by the natural abundance of
the tracer at unlabeled positions.

° I CT allows to consider the isotopic purity of the tracer.

The principal program ﬂow of ICT is illustrated in Figure 1.
After the input files are read, the correction matrix CM is generated
which relates the measured intensities, Imeas, with the corrected in-
tensity values, Icon:

CM X Icorr = Imeas- 

The generation of CM is done by a multi-step procedure. First,
for each considered isotope, all relevant N/n-pairs are computed,
where N and n are the number of the isotopes in the precursor and
the product ion, respectively. For each considered element, these iso-
tope N/n-pairs are combined to create sets of N/n-pairs. Next, these
sets of N/n-pairs are combined to obtain the complete list of relevant

isotope combination which affects the measured spectrum. During
these combining processes, all irrelevant entries are immediately
removed (Fig. 1), to reduce the amount of consumed memory
(RAM) and to speed up the execution time. For each set of isotope
combination, the probability of occurrence is computed (see
Supplementary Information for further details). The fragmentation
of the precursor can be considered as a drawing process where 11
samples are drawn from a pool of N elements, which affects the
probability of occurrence. The probability values are finally used to
create the correction matrix. A lookup table is utilized to identify
the index where a specific isotope combination contributes to the
correction matrix. The lookup table is realized by a hash table (asso-
ciative array). Hash tables are a native variable type in Perl and
allow fast access to data that are stored as key-value-pairs. In a last
step, Equation (1) is solved to obtain the corrected intensities Icorr
and the results are written to a file. Negative corrected intensities
which can arise from measurement uncertainties (Millard et al.,
2012) are set to zero (Moseley, 2010) during the solution process of
Equation (1 ).

3 Results

We have successfully used our program on Linux, Mac OS X and
Windows computers. To verify the results of I CT, we performed nu-
merous correction runs of non-fragmentation mass spectrometry
data and compared them with results, which we obtained by using
IsoCor. We found an excellent agreement between the corrected
data computed by I CT and Iso Cor. The verification of the correction
procedure for tandem mass spectrometry data was performed by
comparing the results of ICT with a large set of corrected data
which we obtained by utilizing a (slow and inefficient) Microsoft
Excel based method.

Typically, the correction for a smaller problem takes a fraction
of a second. For instance, running a batch of 585 correction
procedures taking into account the natural abundance of carbon
and silicon for a variety of compounds, such as amino acids and
low molecular weight organic acids, took approximately 20 s.
Larger problems, such as the correction of interferences caused
by the natural abundance of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen
and silicon for ethoximated/trimethylsilylated sedoheptulose-7-
phosphate (C29H73N1010P15i7), can usually be done within less
than 1 s.

4 Discussion and conclusion

We present a novel isotope correction tool that is freely available
and runs on virtually any computer platform. Our program supports
numerous features, including but not limited to batch processing,
considering the purity of the tracer, supporting any labeling source
and accounting for any number of isotopes. However, the main ad-
vantages of our program are that it can deal with precursor ion frag-
mentation and hence, unlike other available programs, can correct
tandem mass spectrometry data. I CT is an efficient and easy-to-use
tool that is freely available as open source software. It might be use-
ful to anyone who needs to correct the natural abundance in tracer
experiments.

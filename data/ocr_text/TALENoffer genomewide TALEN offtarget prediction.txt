ABSTRACT

Summary: Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (T ALENs)
have become an accepted tool fortargeted mutagenesis, but undesired
off-targets remain an important issue. We present TALENoffer, a novel
tool forthe genome-wide prediction of TALEN off-targets. We show that
TALENoffer successfully predicts known off-targets of engineered
TALENs and yields a competitive runtime, scanning complete mamma-
lian genomes within a few minutes.

Availability: TALENoffer is available as a command line program from
http://www.jstacs.deﬁndex.php/TALENoffer and as a Galaxy server at

1 INTRODUCTION

The DNA binding domain of transcription activator-like (TAL)
effectors is composed of highly conserved tandem repeats, where
amino acids 12 and 13 of a repeat [repeat-variable diresidue,
(RVD)] determine DNA binding speciﬁcity. Each repeat binds
to lbp of the DNA in a contiguous non-overlapping fashion
(Boch et al., 2009; Moscou and Bogdanove, 2009). Recently,
we developed TALgetter, a tool for predicting putative targets
of natural TAL effectors, and we showed that this tool achieves
an improved prediction accuracy compared with previous
approaches (Grau et al., 2013).

The DNA binding domain of TAL effectors can be fused with
a Fokl endonuclease domain to yield TAL effector nucleases
(TALENs), where homo- or hetero-dimers of TALENs need to
bind to opposite strands of the DNA in 5’—3’ orientation and in a
restricted distance range to speciﬁcally cut the DNA double
strand. TALENs have been established as a second genome-
editing technique besides zinc-ﬁnger nucleases (Gaj et al., 2013;
Miller et al., 2011). Although the binding of TALENs is highly
speciﬁc, undesired aﬂ- targets in addition to the targeted genomic
region remain an important issue (Hockemeyer et al., 2011;
Mussolino et al., 2011; Osborn et al., 2013; Tesson et al., 2011)
that may cause severe side effects. Hence, tools for the compu-
tational prediction of TALEN off-targets have been developed,
namely, idTALE (http://idtale.kaust.edu.sa) and Paired Target
Finder (PTF) [https://tale-nt.cac.cornell.edu, Doyle et al.
(2012)]. Here, we only consider PTF because the ‘Search for

custom input data.

In this article, we present TALENoffer, an alternative tool for
predicting TALEN off-targets. TALENoffer applies the statistical
model of TALgetter to the more complex problem of TALEN off-
target prediction. This requires novel methods for ranking off-
targets and accelerated scanning approaches to achieve acceptable
runtimes, which are explained in the following section.

2 METHODS

2.1 Statistical model

The statistical model of TALENoffer assumes that the probability of a
nucleotide of a target site depends on the RVD of the corresponding
repeat. In addition, it reﬂects that different RVDs contribute differently
to the activity of TAL effector constructs (Streubel et al., 2012) (details in
Supplementary Methods). Given RVD sequence y = y1,.. .,yL and
model parameters ,1, this model assigns each putative monomer target
site x = x0, . . . ,xL a likelihood P(x|y,,l). Based on the likelihood, we

deﬁne a relative score s(x | y, l) := L+rllog P(xl y, l)

2.2 Ranking and ﬁltering off-targets

Given two TALEN monomers with RVD sequences yl and y2 of length L1
and L2, respectively, a distance d between TALEN monomers and a pu-
tative off-target site x = x0, . . . , xL1+d+L2+1, we ﬁrst determine the relative
scores s1: s(xo,...,xL1|y1,l) and S2 = s(x‘il+d+L2+1,...,x‘il+d+1|y2,l)
of the two monomer target sites, where x0 denotes the complement of
nucleotide x. We deﬁne the score .9 of the complete off-target site x as
the sum s 2 s1 + S2 of the two relative scores. This scoring scheme
allows for ranking off-target sites, given TALEN monomers of different
lengths, although typically L1 2 L2.

We report off-targets yielding a score s that exceeds a threshold t =
s* + 2 log(q), where s* denotes the score of the best-matching theoretical
off-target site for the current pair of TALEN monomers. Parameter q
speciﬁes that the average likelihood over all positions of the off-target
site shall be at least q - 100 % of the average likelihood over all positions
of the best-matching site. We additionally require each monomer score s, to
exceed a threshold t,- = $2.“ + log(q - 0.9), where sf denotes the best mono-
mer score of y,. This allows for only mild compensation between the two
monomers of a common off-target site. In the TALENoffer application,
users may select pre-deﬁned or enter custom values of q (see also
Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, we limit the ranked sites that are
reported to a user-speciﬁed number. We consider homo- and hetero-
dimers of the TALEN monomers and both DNA strands because all
can lead to off-target effects.

2.3 Runtime optimization

Using a naive scanning approach for predicting TALEN off-targets, we
presumably shift a sliding window of width L1 +1 along the DNA
sequence and compute the score s1, given the ﬁrst TALEN monomer yl

Fig. 1. Speed-up strategy of TALENoffer. Two lookup tables of partial
scores are represented by boxes, where the light shaded part of lookup
table 2 serves as condition for computing the partial likelihood of the dark
shaded part. The rightmost part of the putative off-target site only needs to
be considered if both lookup tables indicate a score above the threshold

within this window. Whenever we ﬁnd a hit, i.e. s1 2 t1, we also scan the
reverse complement of the downstream sequence for sufﬁciently good hits,
given the second monomer yz within the user-speciﬁed distance range.

The scanning approach of TALENoffer is based on this naive approach
but uses a speed-up strategy, which is illustrated in Figure 1 for one
TALEN monomer. Given the TALEN monomer, we compute a partial
score for each possible 8mer preﬁx and store it in lookup table 1, together
with the information whether a target site with this preﬁx may yield a
sufﬁciently large total score s, (details in Supplementary Methods). For
lookup table 2, we proceed in complete analogy using partially overlapping
8mer inﬁxes. Both lookup tables can be accessed efﬁciently, given the preﬁx
and inﬁx of a putative monomer target site. Scanning input sequences for
off-target sites, we test whether both lookup tables indicate that the puta-
tive target site under the sliding window might exceed threshold t1. If this is
the case, we only need to compute the remaining score for the nucleotides
beyond lookup Table 2 to yield the total score s1. If s1 exceeds the threshold,
we apply the same strategy for putative target sites of the second monomer
on the opposite strand within the user-speciﬁed distance range.

In addition to this speed-up strategy, TALENoffer is multithreaded to
allow for simultaneously loading, parsing and seaming input data.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Finding known off-targets

For evaluating predictions, we use TALENs and reported off-
targets from several recent studies (details in Supplementary
Methods, Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Fig. S4).
For all of these datasets, the intended TALEN target is reported
on rank 1 by TALENoffer and PTF. However, we observe
differences between both tools for the predicted off-targets.

Tesson et al. (2011) designed a TALEN pair for targeting IgM in
Rattus norvegicus. The off-target reported by Tesson et al. (201 1) is
predicted by TALENoffer on rank 2 and by PTF on rank 6.

Mussolino et al. (2011) targeted CCR5 in human. The off-
target CCR2 is reported only by TALENoffer (rank 2) because
of an atypical A at position 0 of one monomer target site not
allowed by PTF.

Hockemeyer et al. (2011) targeted PPPIRIZC in human and
reported two off-targets, which are both predicted by
TALENoffer (ranks 47 and 195), whereas PTF predicts only
one of these off-targets (rank 159).

Osborn et al. (2013) targeted human COL7AI and report three
off-targets. Off-target GGT1 is reported by TALENoffer on rank
106 and by PTF on rank 72. PRMT2 is reported by TALENoffer
(rank 3) but not by PTF . The third off-target is reported by neither
approach due to the large number of 11 mismatch positions.

3.2 Runtime comparison

We compare the runtime of TALENoffer with runtime optimiza-
tion with that of PTF in Table 1 for example datasets of different

Table 1. Runtime of TALENoffer compared with PTF on example data-
sets of different sizes

 

 

Dataset (size) PTF TALENoffer
Arabidopsis thaliana lkb up (34 Mb) 12 s 4s

Homo sapiens exome (170 Mb) 1 min 5 s 13 s

Oryza sativa genome (373 Mb) 2 min 8 s 24 s

Homo sapiens genome (2.8 Gb) 17 min 57 s 3 min 5 s

 

Note: As an example TALEN, we use two TALEN monomers with 15 repeats
(details in Supplementary Methods) with a distance of 12—24 bp between monomer
target sites and with multithreading enabled. All values are measured on a standard
laptop (Intel Core i7, ULV, dual core 2GHz).

sizes. We ﬁnd that PTF requires 3.0—5.8 times the runtime of
TALENoffer on the same input datasets. Considering memory
consumption, PTF consistently allocates less memory than
TALENoffer. However, for all input datasets, TALENoffer re-
quires at most 2GB of memory, which allows for execution on
current standard computers (details in Supplementary Table 51).

4 CONCLUSION

We present TALENoffer, a novel tool for the genome-wide
prediction of TALEN targets and off-targets, which successfully
predicts known off-targets of engineered TALENs and yields a
competitive runtime. TALENoffer is implemented using the
open-source Java library J stacs (Grau et al., 2012) and is avail-
able as a command line program and as a Galaxy (Blankenberg
et al., 2010) web application, which can also be installed to a
local Galaxy server.

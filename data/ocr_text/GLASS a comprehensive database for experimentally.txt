Abstract

Motivation: G protein—coupled receptors (GPCRs) are probably the most attractive drug target
membrane proteins, which constitute nearly half of drug targets in the contemporary drug discov—
ery industry. While the majority of drug discovery studies employ existing GPCR and ligand inter—
actions to identify new compounds, there remains a shortage of specific databases with precisely
annotated GPCR—ligand associations.

Results: We have developed a new database, GLASS, which aims to provide a comprehensive,
manually curated resource for experimentally validated GPCR—ligand associations. A new text—
mining algorithm was proposed to collect GPCR—ligand interactions from the biomedical literature,
which is then crosschecked with five primary pharmacological datasets, to enhance the coverage
and accuracy of GPCR—ligand association data identifications. A special architecture has been
designed to allow users for making homologous ligand search with flexible bioactivity parameters.
The current database contains N500 000 unique entries, of which the vast majority stems from lig—
and associations with rhodopsin— and secretin—like receptors. The GLASS database should find its
most useful application in various in silico GPCR screening and functional annotation studies.
Availability and implementation: The website of GLASS database is freely available at http://
zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/GLASS/.

1 Introduction

 

G protein—coupled receptors (GPCR) represent one of the largest
families of transmembrane proteins that bind extracellular mol—
ecules and activate intracellular signal transduction pathways,
Which mediate many physiological functions through their inter-
action With heterotrimeric G proteins. Many human diseases,

including cancer and diabetes, have been found to be associated
With the malfunction of the biological roles of GPCRs (Dorsam and
Gutkind, 2007). Currently, ~30—5 0% of drugs on the market target
GPCRs, making them one of the most attractive membrane recep—
tors for drug development (Klabunde and Hessler, 2002;
Overington et 61]., 2006). While experiment—based assays for novel

chemical compounds remain the standard procedure for drug dis—
covery, in silico screening is gaining increasing acceptance as an im-
portant complementary method to narrow down the drug searching
scope and to guide experimental design. Another advantage of the
computational approach is due to its high speed and low cost, which
enables high—throughput and large—scale database screening
(Lipinski et al., 2001).

Both the experimental and computational drug discovery
approaches rely on existing GPCR—ligand experimental data to pro—
vide insight for screening and selecting new drugs. A variety of
GPCR—orientated databases, such as GPCRDB (Horn et al., 1998),
TinyGRAP (Beukers et al., 1999), GPCR-OKB (Khelashvili et al.,
2010), GDD (Gatica and Cavasotto, 2012) and GPCR-RD (Zhang
and Zhang, 2010), have been developed, which generated important
impacts on various molecule—level studies on the elucidation of
GPCR structure and function.

There are however very few databases that can provide compre—
hensive resources for GPCR—ligand interactions that are essential in
assisting GPCR virtual screening studies (van Laarhoven et al.,
2011; Weill and Rognan, 2009; Zhou and Skolnick, 2012). One dif-
ficulty in developing such databases is that the GPCRs can be associ—
ated with a large number of ligands in various binding affinities, and
the GPCR—ligand association data in many chemical libraries are
often mixed with various false—positives. A collection of GPCR—
ligand associations with stringent experimental validations and care—
ful human curation is essential to ensure the quality of the datasets.
Second, with the success of the sequencing and structural genomics
projects, the number of available GPCR and ligand interactions in-
crease rapidly. But most of the new studies are scattered in a wide
spread of publications and archives, which makes it difficult to keep
the databases up to date. For example, GLIDA (Okuno et al., 2008)
was a useful GPCR—ligand binding database designed for chemical
genomic drug discovery; but it has ceased updates to its server since
October 2010. The current GLIDA library contains around 39 000
GPCR—ligand entries, whereas the amount of unique GPCR—ligand
interactions available in the literature in our estimation is above
500 000 by the combination of the pharmacological database and
literature search. The missing of such a substantial amount of new
data significantly degrades the usefulness of the databases to the ex—
perimental and computational drug discovery studies.

In this study, we have developed a new GPCR—ligand association
(GLASS) database for use as a general platform in assisting GPCR-
related drug screening studies. Drawing from multiple primary data
sources, GLASS focuses on a comprehensive and yet precise collec—
tion of the experimentally validated GPCR—ligand interactions with
strong affinities. To ensure the completeness of the database and to
keep it up to date, we incorporate a newly developed text—mining
pipeline to search through PubMed literature to discover new
GPCR—ligand interactions, which are then crosschecked with the pri—
mary pharmacological datasets to ensure the quality of data collec—
tion. All the GPCR—ligand association data are manually curated
and made freely available to the community.

2 Data and Methods

The GPCR—ligand association data in GLASS consist of two major
resources. The first resource consists of five primary pharmaco-
logical datasets from ChEMBL (Gaulton et al., 2012), BindingDB
(Liu et al., 2007), IUPHAR (Sharman et al., 2011), DrugBank
(Knox et al., 2011) and PDSP (http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php),
which contain various bioactive ligand and protein interaction data.
The second is the GPCR—specific text mining from PubMed

abstracts. A flowchart of the GLASS construction is depicted in
Figure 1.

2.1 Database recombination pipeline

A list of all reviewed UniProt IDs pertaining to GPCRs was first col—
lected from UniProtKB (Magrane and Consortium, 2011). Data rele—
vant to each GPCR, such as species, gene name and primary
sequence, were simultaneously extracted. We used a combination of
synonymous GPCR names from IUPHAR and UniProtKB.

In the second step, flat line databases were downloaded from the
pharmacological databases of ChEMBL, BindingDB, IUPHAR,
DrugBank and PDSP. Data entries were filtered only for GPCR—
related ones using UniProt ID and compiled together. The ligands
without chemical identifiers were eliminated. Meanwhile, the statis—
tical analysis of the distributions among the Ki, Kd, IC50 and EC50
values revealed that the majority (>95 %) of the experimental ligand-
GPCR associations have the activity values below 10 uM
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, an activity filter was implemented,
i.e. the entries with a Ki, Kd, IC50 and EC50 higher than 10 uM
were excluded, in order to sieve out weak and suspicious GPCR—
ligand associations. Once an entry passes all criteria, records on the
pharmacological data (e.g. ligand activities), the references to the ori—
ginal literature of study, and the chemical identifiers such as SMILES
or InChI, are collected from the original pharmacological databases.

2.2 Text mining pipeline

The abstracts of all literatures were collected through NCBI Entrez
system (Maglott et al., 2011) using BioPython (Cock et al., 2009).
The mining process of the GPCR—ligand associations from the
retrieved texts contains two steps: identification of GPCR names,
ligand names and binding triggers and recognition of the GPCR—
ligand interactions (Fig. 1).

Step-1: Identiﬁcation of GPCR names, ligand names and binding
triggers. Two named entity recognition tools were applied to extract
GPCR and ligand names from the abstracts. First, SciMiner (Hur
et al., 2009) was used to identify the names of genes and proteins.
These names are then matched and associated with HGNC [HUGO
(Human Genome Organization) Gene Nomenclature Committee]
official symbols (Gray et al., 2014). Because SciMiner can simultan—
eously recognize both GPCR proteins and small peptides that bind
to the GPCRs, names returned by SciMiner are split into two catego—
ries. Entries that are present in the UniProt GPCR list were collected
as receptors, and those that are not present were collected as pos—
sible ligands. Since the same protein acronym can be shared by mul—
tiple distinct receptors, a scoring scheme based on the co—occurrence
of abbreviated symbols and longer descriptions in the same docu—
ment was employed in SciMiner to overcome the ambiguity of the
acronyms.

Second, we exploited ChemSpot 2.0 (Rocktaschel et al., 2012) to
extract the chemical names of small molecules and short peptides,
which is often considered to be more challenging than protein name
recognition due to the variation of naming systems used by different
literature. To increase the sensitivity of chemical recognition,
ChemSpot uses a hybrid pipeline integrating a condition random
field (CRF) model trained for IUPAC entry identification and a dic—
tionary—based approach built from ChemIDplus for extracting
drugs, abbreviations, molecular formulas and trivial names. The rec—
ognized chemical names are then matched and connected to an
InChI string (Rocktaschel et al., 2012), where common solvents
including water molecules and the named entities that were not
associated with identifiers in the program output were discarded.

GLASS Database

 

Fig. 1. Flowchart for the construction of the GLASS database

With both groups of GPCR and ligand entities, the frequency of
occurrences was calculated for each abstract, which was subsequently
stored in the database together with raw abstract texts and named en—
tity positions. The name frequency data were later used to sort text
mining results in the protein and ligand query pages. All ChemSpot
identifications are treated as possible ligands and are tested in Step-2.

Binding triggers are the key words that explicitly describe biolo—
gical relationship of the ligand and GPCR names, which are recog—
nized from the target sentences using regular expression match.
Three types of triggers are covered in our regular expression diction—
ary: (i) verbs that describe the biological phenomena, such as ‘bind’,
‘activate’, ‘antagonize’; (ii) nouns and adjectives that describe

properties of ligands, such as ‘agonist’, ‘antagonist’, ‘inhibitory’; (iii)
nouns that describe properties of the interactions, including ‘Ki’,
‘Kd’, ‘affinity’, ‘EC5 0’, ‘IC5 0’. A benchmark on 200 manually
labeled abstracts showed that the regular expression can retrieve the
correct ligand—GPCR binding triggers with a precision of 78.8% and
a recall of 86.0%.

Step-2: Recognition of ligand-GPCR associations. The associ—
ation of the GPCR and ligand names is recognized using a depend—
ency tree based machine—learning model that is trained on a set of
abstracts with known ligand—GPCR associations. The dependency
tree based classification was previously proposed by Ozgur and
coworkers to extract protein—protein interactions from text mining

Fig. 2. An illustrative example of the dependency syntax tree parsed from the
sentence ‘We present our studies to demonstrate that HM74A, but not HM74,
binds niacin at high affinities’. Here HM74A and niacin are associated where
HM74 and niacin are not. An arrow points from an origin (or a parent node) to a
word (or a child node) that is syntactically dependent on the origin. Arrows are
assigned with tags, describing what attributes child nodes contribute to their
parent nodes. After pruning the dependency tree, only the bold edges are left,
which connect a receptor name on one side and a ligand name on the other
side, and are represented as a chain of words and tags, or a path. Paths are gen-
erated for every possible pairs of GPCRs and possible ligands in a sentence

(Erkan et al., 2007; Ozgur and Radev, 2009). Here we extend the
idea for GPCR—ligand association recognition.

First, we collect all sentences that contain at least one GPCR
name, one ligand name and one binding trigger. These sentences are
then parsed into a tree of structured words with semantic predicate—
argument relationships, called a typed dependency parse tree (see
Fig. 2), using the Stanford CoreNLP parser (Manning et al., 2014).
For each sentence and every combination of a GPCR name, a ligand
name and a binding trigger, the dependency parse trees returned by
Stanford CoreNLP were pruned to retain the simplest tree that con—
nects all three words.

As illustrated in Figure 2, three paths were extracted from the
pruned tree: (i) connecting the GPCR name on one end and the lig-
and name on the other end; (ii) connecting the GPCR name and the
binding trigger; (iii) connecting the ligand name and the binding
trigger. These three paths were grouped together and 3310 groups
of paths, extracted from 100 abstracts in the training set, were ran—
domly selected from literature and manually labeled based on
whether a true interaction is present in the paths. Following Ozgur
et al (Erkan et al., 2007; Ozgur and Radev, 2009), given every two
groups of paths, each path from one group was aligned against its
corresponding one from the other group using the edit distance met—
ric. This alignment can enhance the consensus of the sentence struc—
ture and therefore improve the efficiency of classification.

Three similarity scores were calculated as the edit distances be—
tween all three pairs of aligned paths. A N x 3N matrix (N: 3310
being the number of paths in the training set) is constructed using
these pair—wise similarities, which is passed as a 3N—dimensional fea—
ture space to train a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT)
model. The training starts with an initial decision tree classifier
trained on the initial data, branching of which stops at the third
level. Based on this weak classifier, GBDT then iteratively calculates
the prediction errors against the training set, constructs new decision
tree classifiers trained on the prediction errors and adds them into
the model (Friedman, 2001).

The GPCR—ligand associations recognized by the GBDT model
in text mining are crosschecked with the data in the pharmaco—
logical datasets. Any conﬂicts between the two sources will be veri—
fied by manual checking before the data are integrated into GLASS.
Manual reading of original articles and comparison with original
databases are often needed at this step for ensuring the quality of the
data. Nearly 20% of GPCR—ligand associations, which are not
included in the current pharmacological datasets, have been ex—
tracted from literature after manual cross validation.

2.3 Architecture of the GLASS library

The GLASS database was built using MySQL, while the Internet
webpage was augmented with a combination of Perl and Python
CGI scripts to facilitate the communication of the interfaces with
the MySQL database.

For each GPCR—ligand association, relevant chemical informa-
tion, such as XlogP, molecular weight, hydrogen bond acceptor and
donor, 2D structure image, synonyms and IUPAC name, were ex—
tracted from PubChem using the compound identifier (CID) of each
ligand via their Chemical Identifier Exchange service. The 3D SDF
files were generated from respective canonical SMILES strings using
Open Babel (O’Boyle et al., 2011).

For the GPCRs from the human genome, the associated condi—
tions and diseases from experiments were compiled from TTD (Qin
et al., 2014) when available. The 3D structure information is pro-
vided for each GPCR by cross—linking to the PDB if the experimental
3D structures are available. A JSmol image is created for each
GPCR to allow users to view the 3D structure of the receptor.

To facilitate comparative interaction studies, GLASS provides an
interactive search engine to allow users to collect homology ligand/
compounds through either substructure or chemical similarity from
the experimentally validated data. Using the JSME molecular editor
(Bienfait and Ertl, 2013), users are allowed to draw a chemical
structure of the compounds, which is then converted into a SMILES
string. Subsequently, it is transferred to Open Babel for either a sub—
structure or similarity search against the indexed ligands. An SDF
file is pre-created containing all ligand indexes in order to expedite
the searching process. For the chemical similarity search, users are
able to select the Tanimoto coefficient cutoffs. The resultant ligands
are returned as SMILES strings. Finally, the SMILES strings are used
as probes to search against the database in order to collect homolo—
gous ligands, which are returned as images of the chemical structure
and their names. Tanimoto coefficients are returned, as well, if the
similarity search was selected.

experiments. Some associations appear more than once in different
experiments. After removing the redundant entries, there are
513 246 unique associations each containing a species—specific
GPCR paired with an interacting ligand (460 439 unique associ—
ations remain if removing the redundancy across species and ac—
counting for orthologues).

A total of 3048 GPCR entries in GLASS were extracted from
UniProt (Magrane and Consortium, 2011), where 681 GPCRs have
at least one ligand associations. The other 2367 GPCR entries have
no ligand associate data in the experiment literature as of the present
time. Among the GPCR’s with ligand associations, there are N754
different types of ligand/compound associations per receptor on
average; but the median value is only 77 due to the fact that several
receptor families have a dominantly high number of ligand associ—
ations (see below). The total number of unique ligands in GLASS is
277651. A summary of the current GLASS database is presented in
Table 1.

Most of the ligand associations in GLASS are skewed towards
the Class—A rhodopsin—like family of GPCRs, which makes up
~85% of the association data (Fig. 3). The top five receptors in the
rhodopsin-like family, all of which have more than 65 000 ligand as—
sociations, are from serotonin, adenine and adenosine nucleotide,
adrenergic, opioid and dopamine receptors. These receptors also
represent the set of the most popularly studied GPCRs in literature
due to their importance in pharmaceutical applications and re—
search. A histogram of the ligand associations for the entire Class—A
family is shown in Supplementary Figure S2.

the human GPCRs, containing over 100 000 entries. The other
non-rhodopsin-like GPCRs with more than 2 000 GPCR—ligand as—
sociations are the metabotropic glutamate and pheromone family
of receptors, both from the Class—C metabotropic glutamate/
pheromone family. There are only two members (UniProt ID:
Q88935 and P56726) from the Class—F family that have associated
experimental data, while little to no GPCR—ligand associations are
found for the GPCRs from the fungal mating pheromone (Class—
D), cyclic AMP (Class—E), slime mold, ocular albinism (OA) and
taste receptor (T2R) families. Supplementary Figures S3—S5 list the
detailed data distributions of ligand associations for Class—B, C
and F families. This highly uneven ligand association distribution
explains the reason that the median number of ligands per receptor
is much lower than the average.

3.2 Database features

The GLASS database is updated every month, and all data are made
freely available at: http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/GLASS/.
Three features have been developed for searching, browsing, or
downloading of the GPCR—ligand association data in GLASS, as
shown in Figure 4, which are outlined in the following.

3.2.1 Searching GLASS

An efficient search function is essential to the development of bio—
medical databases. GLASS provides three options on the home page
for searching the database based on three types of queries: (i)
GPCR—based, (ii) ligand—based and (iii) GPCR—ligand—based. Users
can choose these options by selecting the radio button of interest be—
fore or after typing the desired input (Fig. 4).

Using the GPCR—based search, users can search for a GPCR of
interest using a variety of inputs, including UniProt ID, gene name,
or associated medical conditions. Clicking on the ‘Search’ button
takes the user to a page listing all GPCRs that match the query;
clicking and following the link of the GPCR of interest will bring the
user to a detailed page with GPCR—related information, including
GPCR name, species, gene name, synonyms, associated diseases, pri—
mary sequence and its length, atomic structural model and database
identifiers. All ligands that are associated with the GPCR are listed
at the bottom of the page. Figure 5 presents an example of output of
the GPCR—based search from the human [32 adrenergic receptor.

The ligand—based search requires knowledge of the name, chem—
ical identifier, or PubChem ID of the ligand of interest. Clicking on
the ‘Search’ button will bring the user to a page of results of all lig—
ands matching the query. Clicking and following the link of the lig-
and of interest will bring up a detailed page with the ligand name,

properties, chemical identifiers, database identifiers, 2D chemical
structure and a list of GPCR targets with experimental data. An ex-
ample output involving the ligand, prenalterol, is shown in Figure 6,
where all GPCRs that bind with the ligand are listed at the bottom
of the page.

Although the GPCR—ligand association information can be
retrieved from the GPCR— and ligand—based searches, GLASS pro—
vides a third GPCR—ligand—based search option if the respective
GLASS ID of the interaction is known. In the above example, the
GLASS ID of the human [32 adrenergic receptor and prenalterol as—
sociation is ‘8792’. By searching on ‘8792’, the users will be brought
to a page containing GPCR and ligand information, as well as ex-
perimental binding affinity data. In this example, the free energy of
binding was reported to be 9.76 kcal/mol from the reference with
the PubMed ID 24063433.

In addition to the ligand—, GPCR— and ligand—GPCR—based
searching options, GLASS provides a target—based search for users
who wish to locate a particular ligand by either chemical similarity
or match of substructure (Fig. 7). Using the JSME chemical editor,
the user can manually draw a ligand of interest or import a MOL or
SDF file. Substructure search queries should be for the ligands of suf—
ficient chemical complexity, as it would otherwise match too many
ligands and result in an unreasonably long search. Searching by
chemical similarity, there are options to select for a percentage cut—
off. Results are returned with respective ligands and 2D chemical
structure images; Tanimoto coefficients are also provided for simi-
larity searches. All ligands found can be downloaded in SDF file for-
mat. An example to search homologies of morphine is illustrated in
Figure 7.

Fig. 7. Searching GLASS database for ligands using either the substructure simi-
larity (Left Panel) or chemical similarity (Right Panel). The users first specify the
ligand by importing a MOL or SDF file or draw the molecule into the JSME mo-
lecular editor. In this example, morphine is the query molecule. By clicking on
the ‘Fetch Compounds’ button, the substructure search pipeline will look for lig-
ands that have the molecule that the users specified as part of its chemical struc-
ture; the chemical similarity search pipeline will return all ligands that are at
least 70% chemically identical to the query (the cutoff is adjustable). While the
ligand name and chemical structure are provided for the users in both searches,
Tanimoto coefficients are seen only with the chemical similarity search

Additionally, the user can also browse all GPCRs as sorted by their
respective families as designated by UniProt (Magrane and
Consortium, 2011). According to this schema, the rhodopsin-like
family GPCR entries are further divided into the level of sub—families
due to the high volume of entries, while the rest of the families re-
main in one level.

3.2.3 Downloading GLASS

Tables of GPCR, GPCR—ligand and ligand data are all made avail—
able for download in TSV file format. A zipped SDF file of all
GLASS ligands in 3D format is available and ready for use in mo—
lecular docking experiments; physicochemical properties and mo—
lecular descriptors are included within the property tags for the
user’s convenience.

4 Summary

We have developed a new database, GLASS, which encompasses a
wide breadth of GPCR—related pharmacological data, gathered from
a multitude of data sources and PubMed literature mining. GLASS
contains over ten times more ligand and GPCR—ligand interaction
data than the leading databases, which makes GLASS the most com—
prehensive and up—to—date GPCR—ligand association repository in
the field. It is however the novel sets of data collection and feature
setting, rather than the sheer amount of data, which makes GLASS
database unique.

First, the data extraction procedure was augmented with a novel
text-mining pipeline, which makes it possible for automated

database updating. More importantly, careful manual crosschecking
of the existing datasets with the text—mining data increase both the
accuracy and the coverage of the GPCR—ligand data collections.
Nearly 20% of ligand association data are collected from the litera—
ture mining after manual literature validation following the auto—
mated text mining process. We have noticed that many of the
bioactive ligand associations have been described in literature but
were missed in most of the pharmacological databases. To address
the issue, users are given the option to browse through text-mining
results in order to discover missed GPCR—ligand interactions. This
will prove invaluable in cases where the missing data yields bioactive
ligands for a certain GPCR of interest that have chemical structures
distinct from those currently in databases.

Second, the current structure of GLASS database has been made
to retain the majority of GPCR—ligand pharmacological data after
some definitive filters to rule out false positives; this gives users
options to choose proper cutoff values for certain experimental par-
ameters, such as binding constants. This will avoid any subjective
pre—cutoffs that limit user’s ﬂexibility. Certain GPCR—ligand data—
bases, such as GLIDA (Okuno et al., 2008), only give a list of lig-
ands with biological activities as opposed to experimental
parameters. For example, a ligand could be designated as an agonist
for a GPCR, but we are left unaware of how it came to be as such.
The pre—cutoff setting makes it difficult to customize ligand datasets
by experimental values for analysis. GLASS database was designed
to ensure all of its extracted data available for user manipulation.
The presence of this option means that analyses can be performed
on individual GPCRs to elucidate their ligand preferences based on
various cutoff values.

One of the focuses of GLASS is to provide references to various
experimental and computational virtual screening studies. For
instance, an important approach to GPCR virtual screening is to col—
lect ligand profiles from homologous ligand—GPCR interactions
(Zhou and Skolnick, 2012), where the completeness of the ligand—
GPCR associations in GLASS will be essential to increase the
sensitivity and recognition power of the ligand profiles. With its
comprehensive coverage of datasets and consistent updates of data,
we expect that GLASS become an important primary GPCR re-
source and impart its usefulness in many other biomedical studies,
including in silico GPCR drug discovery, GPCR de—orphanization
and functional annotation.

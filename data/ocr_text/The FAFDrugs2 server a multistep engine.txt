ABSTRACT

Summary: The FAF-DrugsZ server is a web application that prepares
chemical compound libraries prior to virtual screening or that
assists hit selection/lead optimization before chemical synthesis or
ordering. The FAF-DrugsZ web server is an enhanced version of
the FAF-DrugsZ package that now includes Pan Assay Interference
Compounds detection. This online toolkit has been designed through
a user-centered approach with emphasis on user-friendliness. This
is a unique online tool allowing to prepare large compound libraries
with in house or user-defined filtering parameters.

Availability: The FAF-DrugsZ server is freely available at
http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/FAF-Drugs/.

1 INTRODUCTION

The most established method for the identiﬁcation of hit compounds
modulating the functions of a target is experimental high—throughput
screening (HTS). Alternatively or in parallel, screening can be
performed in silico (virtual ligand screening or VLS) in order to
prioritize compounds for in vitro screening. The screening process
involves measurement/prediction of activities of sometimes millions
of chemical compounds in vitro, on cells or in silico. The ﬁrst
two, in particular, are time consuming and costly, and as such, the
preparation of the compound collections is critical. Analyses of past
failures have led to a much better understanding of crucial properties
that distinguish any chemical from an interesting drug—candidate
or a relevant chemical probe. Thus, the concept of screening
high—quality compound collections in terms of improved ADMET
(absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) properties
and containing a reduced number of ‘nuisance compounds’ is
gaining momentum. Hence, we decided to develop a user—friendly
online tool dedicated to the preparation of compound collections.
In fact, such a service, freely available and able to handle several
thousands of compounds with either predeﬁned ﬁltering parameters

or user—tuned parameters, assisting decision making has not been
reported to date. Our online in silico ﬁltering engine is based on a
signiﬁcantly improved version of a previously reported stand—alone
package named FAF—Drugs2, standing for Free ADMET Filtering—
Drugs2 (Lagorce et al., 2008), which was successfully employed for
preparing compound datasets for different projects as in Reynes et al.
(2010). While many free online services are available to compute
molecular properties (Ertl et al., 2007; Tetko, 2003; Walker et al.,
2010), FAF—Drugs2 is the ﬁrst free web—based package capable
of preparing compound libraries through physicochemical rules,
functional groups and Pan Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS)
detection (Baell et al., 2010). In the present application note, we
describe the FAF—Drugs2 server highlighting the new functionalities
introduced as compared with the original stand—alone package.

2 THE FAF-DRUGSZ SERVER

2.1 Improvements of FAF-DrugsZ in the web server
version

FAF—Drugs2 client version requires as input the compound
collection in SD or SMILES ﬁle format and two parameter ﬁles, one
containing among others physicochemical thresholds and another
one listing the chemical substructures that have to be investigated.
Various output ﬁles are generated, e.g. SDF ﬁltered ﬁles or a
tabulated ﬁle reporting all the computed values/descriptors. The
main improvements on the server version as compared with the
FAF—Drugs2 stand—alone tool include: (i) a step before the ﬁltering
process to prepare and clean the electronic input molecular data
ﬁle, with removal of empty structures, salts, counterions, inorganics,
mixtures, duplicates. Further, we apply a standardization procedure
on eight common chemical groups using SMARTS search and the
ChemAxon Standardizer utility (see Supplementary Material). Yet,
in order to compute some descriptors the way they were originally
described, a rule—based protonation protocol is internally performed
with OpenBabel (O’Boyle et al., 2008). (ii) Novel, optimized and
user—deﬁned ﬁltering rules, with a major improvement of the logP
calculation through the use of the XLOGP3 program enhanced with
experimental logP values extracted from the PHYSPROP database
(Syracuse Research Database). (iii) More than 200 SMARTS
patterns used to search for undesirable moieties. (iv) Implementation
of PAINS ﬁlters optimized by our research group. Such moieties

have been described to appear as frequent hitters or promiscuous
compounds in many HTS experiments. (v) The ESOL solubility
estimation model (see Supplementary Material) and some others
useful features are now available such as various oral bioavailability
evaluations. (vi) Finally, an intuitive visualization of the results
through any web browser is now implemented. More explanations
about our ﬁltering engine protocol are detailed in the Supplementary
Material and the online userguide.

2.2 Implementation

The optimized FAF—Drugs2 engine has been embedded in the RPBS’
Mobyle Portal (Neron et al., 2009). Mobyle’s features makes it
the perfect solution for online toolkit implementation, because it
offers: (i) a centralized workspace for the end—user (bookmarked
results and parameters are stored on the server for further uses and
backup); (ii) on—the—ﬁy program results pipelining; and (iii) a user—
friendly interface and a robust tool to interact with end users and
control programs’ execution on the server side (storage and resources
quota, jobs tracking, etc.). The FAF—Drugs2 web server is organized
as a toolkit composed of three services: (i) Bank—Formatter (e.g.
converts SMILES input ﬁles to SD ﬁles format, see Supplementary
Material); (ii) Filter—Editor (customizes user—deﬁned ﬁlters); and (iii)
the FAF—Drugs2 ﬁltering service. The server has been validated and
optimized: (i) on 10000 molecules from the WEHI HTS library
(see Supplementary Material); (ii) to be fully functional on popular
operating systems and web browsers; and (iii) to run on our 800
nodes cluster (see Supplementary Material).

2.3 Interface features

SD ﬁles, as long as they do not exceed 50000 molecules, can
be submitted to the FAF—Drugs2 either by uploading input ﬁles
on the server or by pasting data in a dedicated window. Instead
of using the Filter—Editor service, users can also choose among
various physicochemical elsewhere—published pre—tuned ﬁlters;
among others REOS (Walters et al., 2002) or ZINC (Irwin et al.,
2005). Furthermore, users can decide to activate the PAINS and
functional group substructures detection. When the process is
terminated, while ﬁltering result ﬁles can be downloaded, various
analyses can be done directly in several internet browser windows,
like a statistical analysis of the main descriptor distributions
(Fig. 1a), a pie chart summarizing the results for the substructures
search (Fig. lb), a table detailing the results for each compound: the
ﬁltering options, the compound’s 2D depiction via the ChemAxon
molconvert tookit (Fig. 1c), the compound projection (magenta)
onto the ﬁrst plan of the principal component analysis of the orally
bioavailable (blue) DrugBank Small molecules (Fig. 1d) and a
radar plot depicting some molecular properties important for oral
absorption (Fig. 1e).

3 SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES

The FAF—Drugs2 web server is the ﬁrst free web—based application
devoted to compound library preparation and PAINS detection.
The service can also be used to evaluate drug—like properties, the
presence of an undesirable substructure and oral absorption of a
small set of compounds before synthesis. This service should be of
interest to both academic and private research groups.

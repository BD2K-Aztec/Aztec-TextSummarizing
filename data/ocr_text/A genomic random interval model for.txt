ABSTRACT

Motivation: Tumors exhibit numerous genomic lesions such as copy
number variations, structural variations and sequence variations. It is
difficult to determine whether a specific constellation of lesions
observed across a cohort of multiple tumors provides statistically sig-
nificant evidence that the lesions target a set of genes that may be
located across different chromosomes but yet are all involved in a
single specific biological process or function.

Results: We introduce the genomic random interval (GRIN) statistical
model and analysis method that evaluates the statistical significance
of the abundance of genomic lesions that overlap a speciﬁc locus or a
pre-defined set of biologically related loci. The GRIN model retains
certain biologically important properties of genomic lesions that are
ignored by other methods. In a simulation study and two example
analyses of leukemia genomic lesion data, GRIN more effectively iden-
tified important loci as significant than did three methods based on a
permutation-of—markers model. GRIN also identified biologically rele-
vant pathways with a significant abundance of lesions in both
examples.

1 INTRODUCTION

Microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies have
enabled biomedical researchers to characterize the genome of
individual tissue samples at a high resolution. In cancer gen-
omics, these technologies have been used to identify genomic
lesions in which the DNA of the tumor has been altered relative
to that of normal tissue from the same subject. Genomic lesions
include copy number changes, sequence mutations and structural
rearrangements. Genomic lesions may impact oncogenesis
(Mullighan et al., 2007) and clinical prognosis (Mullighan
et al., 2009). In this way, the development of the data collection
technologies and associated data analysis methods has

contributed profoundly to our understanding of the genomic
basis of cancer development and prognosis.

Several analysis methods have been developed to identify and
assign a statistical signiﬁcance (e.g. P-Value) to ‘hot spot’ loci
that are affected by copy number alterations at a high frequency:
the Genomic Identiﬁcation of Signiﬁcant Targets in Cancer
(GISTIC; Beroukhim et al., 2007) algorithm and its extensions
JISTIC (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2010) and GISTIC 2.0 (Mermel
et al., 2011); Signiﬁcant Aberration in Cancer (SAIC; Yuan
et al., 2012a); and TAGCNA (Yuan et al., 2012b). GISTIC is
one of the most widely used methods. It computes a statistic that
summarizes the frequency and amplitude of copy number alter-
ations at each marker of a speciﬁc microarray platform. It then
uses within-tumor permutation of the assignment of copy
number status to marker locus as a null statistical model to
evaluate statistical signiﬁcance. In this way, GISTIC obtains a
P-Value for each microarray marker locus, and signiﬁcant peaks
are subsequently identiﬁed from this proﬁle of P-Values. The
JISTIC method uses a modiﬁed algorithm for identifying peaks
in the P-Value proﬁle. The GISTIC 2.0 algorithm modiﬁes seV-
eral components of the original GISTIC algorithm, but GISTIC
2.0 still relies on permutation of markers (POMs) or bins of
markers to compute P-Values. SAIC and TAGCNA compute
statistics that describe the extent to which speciﬁc marker loci
are affected by copy number alterations and use POMs as a null
statistical model to determine statistical signiﬁcance. Each of
these methods has been successfully used for several applications
and thus represent important contributions in computational
cancer biology.

Nevertheless, each of these methods have some limitations that
should be addressed. First of all, these methods use a biologically
implausible statistical model of the null probability that a lesion
affects a locus. GISTIC, JISTIC, GISTIC 2.0, SAIC and
TAGCNA each use a POMs model for this purpose. POM per-
mutes the assignment of copy number status to marker locus
within each tumor. In this way, POM shatters single contigous
lesions into numerous probabilistically independent entities.
Consequently, many biologically important lesions are not iden-
tiﬁed as statistically signiﬁcant (Mermel et al., 2011). Secondly,
these methods are not readily applicable to genomic lesion data
collected by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). These methods
each require that the data be represented in the form of a
marker-by—subject matrix. With WGS, every ‘mappable’ base
pair in the genome is a ‘marker’ so the matrix will be large.

Genomic random interval model

 

Additionally, these methods were developed solely for copy
number alterations and do not provide a way to incorporate
other lesions, such as point mutations or structural rearrange-
ments that may be detected with WGS WVang et al., 2011).
Finally, these methods only evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance
of the frequency that individual markers are affected by a lesion,
but do not directly determine whether a given set of biologically
related genes scattered across the genome (such as a particular
pathway) have a statistically signiﬁcant abundance of genomic
lesions.

Therefore, we have developed the genomic random interval
(GRIN) statistical model for statistical analysis of genomic
lesion data. The GRIN model explicitly represents each genomic
lesion as an entity that affects one point locus, a set of point loci
or an interval locus along a chromosome. In this way, the GRIN
model retains the continuity of the genomic lesions and naturally
avoids the difﬁculties introduced by statistical models that do not
retain lesion continuity. Additionally, the GRIN model can ac-
commodate any genomic lesion that can be represented as a
locus on the reference genome. Copy number alterations are rep-
resented by intervals with distinct start and end loci; point mu-
tations are represented by their respective loci; and structural
rearrangements are represented by the loci of the associated
breakpoints. Finally, the GRIN model provides a computation-
ally feasible approach to evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of
the frequency that lesions affect a set of genes involved in a
particular biological process. Furthermore, like other methods,
GRIN also provides a mechanism to evaluate the signiﬁcance of
the frequency that lesions affect each point locus in the genome
and the locus of each individual gene in the genome.

The remainder of this work is organized as follows. In Section
2, we describe the GRIN model in detail. Section 3 evaluates the
performance of GRIN and other methods in a simulation study
and two example analyses from leukemia studies. Section 4 pro-
vides discussion and concluding remarks.

2 METHODS

2.1 Genomic lesion data

Genomic lesion data give the type and locus of each genomic lesion
observed for each tissue sample. Let Z = 1, ...,L index the L genomic
lesions and let (s1, 6;, a], v1) denote the subject s1, chromosome c1, start
locus a1 and end locus v1 of lesion 1. Table 1 gives an example of genomic
lesion data from a study of early T—cell precursor (ETP; Zhang et al.,
2012) leukemia and illustrates the mathematical notation of genomic
lesion data.

We wish to determine whether the lesions are signiﬁcantly concen-
trated at any particular locus in the genome, within any particular gene
in the genome or within the loci of a set of genes involved in a speciﬁc
biological process. To address these questions, we must deﬁne statistics
that describe the concentration of lesions around a speciﬁc locus, within a
speciﬁc gene and within a set of genes. We must also deﬁne a statistical
model to evaluate signiﬁcance.

2.2 Overlap statistics

Here, we deﬁne statistics that describe the abundance of lesions that
overlap one ﬁxed set of loci g. The ﬁxed set of loci g may be a single
point locus, the interval locus of an individual gene or the interval loci of
a set of biologically related genes that are in the same pathway or have a

common ontology. Note that the ﬁxed set of loci may be scattered on
different chromosomes throughout the genome. In general, g may be
represented as a set of g = 1, ..., G interval loci with the form
(cg, ag, bg) where cg is the chromosome of locus g, ag is the start position
of locus g and bg is the end of locus g. We will use the acronym FLI to
refer to one ﬁxed locus of interest within the ﬁxed set of loci g and the
acronym FLIs to refer to multiple ﬁxed loci within the set g.

First, we deﬁne a statistic that indicates whether each lesion 1 overlaps
each FLI g. Let I(-) be the indicator function that equals one if the
enclosed statement is true and equals zero if the enclosed statement is
false. For each lesion l: 1, ...,L and each FLI g: 1, ...,G, the
product

01g 2 KC] 2 Cg)1(ul S bg)I(Vl Z ag) (1)

indicates whether lesion 1 overlaps FLI g because I(cl = cg) indicates
whether the lesion and FLI are on the same chromosome, I(al 5 bg)
indicates that the lesion start locus is left of the FLI end locus and
I(vl Z ag) indicates that the lesion end locus is right of the FLI start locus.

The abundance of lesions that overlap g are described with statistics
that are functions of the lesion-FLI overlap indicators 01g in Equation (1).

2.3 The GRIN model

Here, we introduce the concept of a GRIN and use it to deﬁne the null
probability distributions for the descriptive statistics deﬁned above. A
GRIN with given length x base pairs on a chromosome c of length Kc
base pairs may occur at each of the u = 1, ...,Kc — x + 1 interval loci
(u, u + x — 1) with uniform probability 1/(Kc + x — 1) as shown in
Figure 1A. A GRIN may be fully described by its chromosome c, the
length Kc of chromosome c and its random start position U. Given 6, Kc
and x, the random start position U has a discrete uniform distribution
overu: 1, ...,Kc—x+1.

The probability that one GRIN on chromosome c overlaps one FLI
with index g (also on chromosome c) is a simple function of the FLI
start position ag, the FLI end position bg, the length x of the GRIN and
the length Kc of chromosome c. Figure 1A shows that a GRIN of given
size x with start position u between a, = max(1,ag — x) and
bg = min(bg,Kc — x + 1) will overlap FLI g, which begins at position

ag and ends at position bg. Therefore, the probability that the GRIN
overlaps FLI g is simply the proportion
@—@+1

Kc (8)

of the 1%,; = K; — x + 1 possible positions of the GRIN that overlap the
FLI. Equation (8) shows that the GRIN statistical model has the intuitive
property that the probability of overlap increases with the size of the
GRIN and the size of the FLI.

It is also straightforward to derive the probability that multiple inde-
pendent GRINs overlap multiple FLIs on the same chromosome. The
triangle diagram of Figure 1B geometrically represents the number of
FLIs that overlap a GRIN as a function of the GRIN size x and
GRIN start locus u. The shaded overlap regions are determined by
computing 13¢, a, and bg for each possible GRIN size x according to
Figure 1A as described above. A horizontal line at the given GRIN size x
deﬁnes the number of overlapping FLIs as a function of the GRIN start
locus u (Fig. 1B). In turn, the overlap function for a given GRIN of size x
deﬁnes the null probability distribution for the number of FLIs that
overlap a GRIN of the given size by the proportion of possible GRIN
start positions that overlap each possible number of FLIs (Fig. 1C).
Finally, the null distribution for the total number of GRIN—FLI overlaps
is determined by serial convolution of the distribution of the number of
FLI that overlap each GRIN as illustrated by the probability tree of
Figure 1D.

2.4 Null distribution of overlap statistics

We now derive the null probability distribution for each overlap statistic
listed in Section 2.2 by representing each lesion as an independent GRIN
of the same size on the same chromosome in the same subject.

The null probability Pr(ol. = m) that each lesion 1 overlaps m FLIs
is the probability that a GRIN of equal length on the same chromosome
overlaps exactly m FLIs. This probability is calculated as shown in
Figure 1B. The null probability Pr(o.. = m) that the total number of
overlaps 0.. equals m is determined by serial convolution of Pr(ol.) over
all lesions 1 = 1, ..., L as shown in Figure 1D.

The null probability Pr(hl = 1) that lesion 1 overlaps at least one FLI is
a Bernoulli distribution with success probability in = Pr(ol. > 0). The null
probability Pr(h. = m) that there are m lesions with at least one overlap is
determined by serial convolution of the Bernoulli(m) distributions over
all I: 1, ...,L lesions.

The null probability Pr(n, = m) that subject t has m lesions that over-
lap at least one FLI is determined by serial convolution of the
Bernoulli(m) distributions over that subject’s lesions 1, i.e. all I such
that s; = t. The null probability Pr(n. = m) that there are m subjects
with at least one overlap is determined by serial convolution of the
Bernoulli distributions with success probability y, = Pr(n, >0) over all
t = 1, ..., Tsubjects.

2.5 Questions addressed by GRIN analysis

For any particular FLI, the GRIN analysis method may be used to
compute a P-value to quantify the signiﬁcance of any of the overlap
statistics of Section 2.2 according to the GRIN null model of Section
2.3. In particular, the GRIN model may be used to calculate a P-value for
the total number 0.. of lesion—FLI overlaps as deﬁned in Equation (3), the
total number h. of lesions that overlap at least one FLI in Equation (4),
the number nt of lesions in each subject t that overlap at least one FLI as
deﬁned in Equation (6) and the number n. of subjects that have at least
one overlap as deﬁned in Equation (7).

In practice, GRIN may be used to screen multiple sets of ﬁxed loci by
performing a separate GRIN analysis for each distinct set of loci. For
example, a GRIN analysis may be performed with a particular KEGG
pathway (www.kegg.jp) as the set g. This gene-set GRIN analysis will
determine whether the lesions signiﬁcantly target the particular KEGG
pathway. A separate gene-set GRIN analysis can be performed for each
KEGG pathway as the set g to evaluate the signiﬁcance of lesion overlap
with each KEGG pathway.

A gene-level GRIN analysis may be performed by performing a test
with the locus of one individual gene as the set g. Each overlap statistic
and its corresponding P-value can be computed for this particular gene.
A separate GRIN analysis can be performed using the locus of each
individual gene as the set g to screen every gene in the genome.

A marker-level GRIN analysis may also be used to screen the entire
genome for ‘hot spot’ loci that have a signiﬁcant abundance of lesions.
Conceptually, one could perform a separate GRIN analysis with each
microarray marker or point locus serving as the ﬁxed set g. This ap-
proach would compute overlap statistics and P-values for each point
locus or microarray marker. Those loci with signiﬁcant P-values would
be identiﬁed as hot spots. However, screening the entire genome for hot
spots by performing a separate GRIN analysis for each point locus or
microarray marker in the genome is computationally prohibitive and
involves a massive statistical multiplicity.

Therefore, we use a different strategy to use GRIN to screen the entire
genome for hot spots that have a signiﬁcant abundance of lesions. The
chromosome c1 and endpoints (a1, bl) of each lesion deﬁne a set of bound-
aries that partition the genome into a set of r = 1, ..., R regions. Each
region r is a point or interval locus that can be represented by (or, a,, b,)
where or is the chromosome of region r, a, is the start locus of region r
and br is the end locus of region r. A separate GRIN analysis can be

applied with each region r as the set g to compute overlap statistics and
P-value for each region r. This strategy screens the entire genome for hot
spots with one GRIN analysis per region instead of one GRIN analysis
per marker. The number of regions R is on the order of the number of
lesions L. The number of lesions L is typically several orders of magni-
tude smaller than the number of markers. Thus, the strategy to perform
one analysis per region greatly reduces the computational burden and
statistical multiplicity of the analysis.

The test-per—region strategy to screen the entire genome for hot spots is
also more conservative than the test-per—marker strategy. For each region
r, the P-value from GRIN using the region r as the set Q will be greater
than or equal to the P-value from using any point locus within the region
as the set g. Let a, b and y be point loci on a chromosome of size K such
that y is between a and b, i.e. a 5 y 5 b. Equation (8) clearly indicates
that the probability that any GRIN overlaps the point locus y is less than
or equal to the probability that the same GRIN overlaps the interval
locus (a, b), which includes y. Thus, at every stage of the serial convolu-
tion used to compute the null distribution for an overlap statistic, the null
probability of overlap will be greater for the interval locus (a, b) than for
the point locus y. Therefore, for any of the overlap statistics, the P-value
for overlap with the interval locus (a, b) will be larger than the P-value for
overlap with the point locus y within the interval locus (a, b).

2.6 Comparison with other methods

The GRIN analysis method has several advantages over the analysis
methods mentioned in the introduction. First, GRIN can address a
broader spectrum of biological questions than do the other methods.
Second, GRIN works with a broader diversity of genomic lesions than
do the other methods. Third, the GRIN statistical model retains some
biologically important properties of genomic lesions that the other meth-
ods ignore. Finally, by retaining those biological properties, the GRIN
analysis method has some distinct statistical and computational
advantages over the other methods. These advantages are summarized
in Table 2 and described in detail below.

GRIN addresses a broader variety of biological questions than do the
other methods. The other methods identify hot spot loci within the
genome that have a signiﬁcant abundance of lesions. GRIN can also
identify hot spot loci as described in Section 2.5. Moreover, GRIN per-
forms this analysis with much less computation because it does not resort
to permutation. Section 2.5 also describes gene-level and gene-set level
analyses that GRIN can perform. The other methods do not perform any
analyses at the gene or gene-set level.

Additionally, GRIN works with a much broader variety of genomic
lesions than do the other methods. The other methods limit consideration
to copy number alterations or loss of heterozygosity (LOH). In contrast,
every lesion with a well-deﬁned interval or point locus on the reference
genome coordinate system can be included in a GRIN analysis. Copy
number alterations and LOH have an interval locus on the reference
genome; non-silent substitutions and indels have a point locus on the
reference genome; and each breakpoint of a structural rearrangement
has a point locus on the reference genome. Thus, all these types of gen-
omic lesions can be incorporated into a GRIN analysis. Furthermore,
GRIN can consider each type of lesion separately just as some other
methods consider ampliﬁcations and deletions separately.

The GRIN statistical model differs substantially from the POM model
used by other analysis methods. Figure 2 illustrates the POM and GRIN
models of chance for the genomic lesion data of one subject. The GRIN
model of chance constrains lesions to retain their size, continuity and to
stay located on the same chromosome (Fig. 2A). In contrast, POM as-
signs lesion status to markers by permutation (Fig. 2B). The GRIN
model of chance is constrained to retain many of the observed properties
of the lesions. Thus, the GRIN model generates data that more closely
resemble these characteristics of the real data than does the POM model.

Fig. 2. Illustration of GRIN and POM model realizations. The left
column of panel A has an illustrative set of genomic lesions of one sub-
ject. The lesions are shaded in gray and chromosomes are separated by
horizontal black lines. The subsequent 10 columns show 10 realizations of
the GRIN model generated from those lesions. Panel B has the same set
of genomic lesions and 10 realizations of the POM model generated from
those lesions

The two models have different statistical properties. Under the POM
model, every marker has an equal probability of being affected by a
lesion; this probability is equal to the proportion of markers that are
affected by a lesion in the observed data. In the example of Figure 2,
30% of the markers are affected by a lesion and thus the POM model
assigns every marker a 30% null probability of being affected by a lesion
by chance. In contrast, the GRIN model assigns a different probability of
being affected by chance to each marker. In the example of Figure 2A,
GRIN assigns a 100% probability of being affected by chance to markers
on the chromosome that has a whole-chromosome event and a 0% prob-
ability to every marker on the chromosome with no lesions. These stark
differences in null probabilities trickle through all calculations and may
ultimately deﬁne grossly distinct null distributions.

The differences between the two statistical models becomes more pro-
found when considering the number of lesions that affect entire genes or
sets of biologically related genes that may be scattered at different loci
across the genome. For instance, consider computing the null probability
that a lesion overlaps any portion of a gene locus that includes x markers.
For the example of Figure 2A, the probability of this event is approxi-
mately 1 — 0.7" under the POM model. For x = 10, this null probability is
0.97. Such large null probabilities make it difﬁcult for a gene-level

analysis with a POM model to identify anything as statistically signiﬁ-
cant. In contrast, the null probability of overlap under the GRIN model
is deﬁned by Equation (8). Under the GRIN model, the null probability
of overlap increases more gradually with the size of the gene and there is
no multiplicity due to consideration of multiple markers within the gene.

The GRIN model also requires less memory and computing time than
do methods that rely on the POM model. Methods that use the POM
model represent the genomic lesion data by a large matrix with one row
per marker and one column per subject. In contrast, GRIN represents the
genomic lesion data using the format shown in Table 1 and described in
Section 2.1. This format requires only four items of information per
lesion. The GRIN representation of the data clearly requires much less
memory than the matrix representation. GRIN also requires less comput-
ing time than does POM. For each lesion and FLI, GRIN updates the
overlap statistics and performs a simple convolution to update the null
distribution of those overlap statistics. Thus, the total number of such
operations is the product of the number of FLIs and the number of
lesions. However, the POM methods update the overlap statistics for
each subject and each marker within each permutation. Thus, the total
number of update operations is the product of the number of markers,
the number of subjects and the number of permutations. The permuta-
tion may be accurately approximated by a convolution in some settings.
However, the number of markers will greatly exceed the number of le-
sions in most applications, and thus, GRIN will typically require much
less computing time than POM methods.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulation study

We used simulation to evaluate GRIN, GISTIC 2.0, TAGCNA
and SAIC as methods for marker-level analysis of genomic lesion
data. We generated 100 independent datasets for each sample
size n: 10, 50 or 100 as described below. Each method was
applied to each of these 300 datasets.

For each subject, a set of random lesions and a set of targeted
lesions were generated. For each subject, the number of random
lesions was generated from a Poisson distribution with mean 5.
Each random lesion was assigned to a chromosome with prob-
ability proportional to chromosome size. Given the assigned
chromosome, the size of a random lesion was uniform. Given
the assigned chromosome and lesion size, the position of the
random lesion was uniform as shown in Figure 1A.
Additionally, each subject could have a targeted lesion centering
over RB1, TP53, CDKN2A and/or AMLl. For each subject,
each of these genes had a 50% probability of having a targeted
lesion. The endpoints of each targeted lesion were deﬁned by a
pair of observations generated from a scaled beta distribution
with mean equal to the midpoint of the targeted gene and a sum
of shape parameters equal to 1000. To address multiple testing,
we used the robust false discovery rate (FDR) estimation pro-
cedure (Pounds and Cheng, 2006) to compute q-values (Storey,
2002) for TAGCNA, SAIC and GRIN. For GISTIC 2.0, we
used the q-values that it reports.

The average power, FDR and area under the curve (AUC)
were computed for each method and sample size. The average
power at the q—value threshold of 0.01 was the proportion of base
pairs inside a target locus declared signiﬁcant at that level aver-
aged across simulation replications. The FDR was the average
proportion of regions declared signiﬁcant that did not overlap
one of the four targets mentioned above. The FDR was set to

zero in each simulation that a method had no signiﬁcant ﬁnd-
ings. The AUC was computed by averaging the AUC of the
proportion of target base pairs captured as a function of non-
target base pairs captured across all replications. Good perform-
ance is indicated by keeping the FDR below 0.01 and greater
power and AUC. We also recorded the average computing time
for each method.

Table 3 gives the simulation results. GRIN is the only method
to maintain the FDR level below 0.01 for all sample sizes. Under
our simulation model, lesions affect contiguous intervals of the
genome, which violate the POM model of chance (Fig. 2). Thus,
there are regions that will have a number of overlapping random
non-targeted lesions that is signiﬁcant against the POM model of
chance. The GISTIC 2.0, TAGCNA and SAIC methods all use
some type of POM model and thus obtain many false-positive
results.

GRIN also has the greatest statistical power in each of these
simulations (Table 3). The POM model uses lesions from the
entire genome to compute the probability that a lesion affects
any marker by chance. Thus, large lesions increase the null prob-
ability of overlap for every marker under the POM model. Under
the GRIN model, large lesions impact the null probability of
overlap only for loci on the same chromosome. Thus, other re-
gions of the genome can still have a small null probability of
overlap and be assigned a signiﬁcant P-value under the GRIN
model.

3.2 ETP leukemia

Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL)
has recently been recognized as a disease entity with a poor
prognosis (Coustan-Smith et al., 2009). Zhang et al. (2012) per-
formed WGS of matched tumor and non-tumor DNA for 12
childhood ETP-ALL cases. DNA deletions, ampliﬁcations,
structural rearrangements and sequence mutations were identi-
ﬁed for each tumor by comparison of its sequence data to that of
a paired control. Figure 3A shows the data.

We applied GISTIC 2.0, SAIC and TAGCNA to the DNA
copy number gains and losses of this dataset. We also performed
separate marker-level GRIN analyses on the losses and gains

using the total number of overlaps statistic deﬁned by
Equation (3). We accounted for multiple testing by using the
robust FDR method developed for one-sided tests with discrete
P-Values (Pounds and Cheng, 2006) to compute q-values (Storey,
2002) for SAIC, TAGCNA and GRIN. We used the GISTIC 2.0
q-values for that method. The results are shown in Figure 3B and
Supplementary Table S1 (the Table S1 tab of the ﬁle supplemen-
tal-tables.xlsx). For all analyses and methods, we deem results
with q 5 0.01 to be statistically signiﬁcant. TAGCNA and SAIC
failed to identify any locus as signiﬁcant. GISTIC 2.0 identiﬁed a
locus on chromosome 12 as having a signiﬁcant number of losses
(q = 0.004). Zhang et al. (2012) describe the biological relevance
of this loss to ETP-ALL. GRIN also determined that this locus
has a signiﬁcant number of losses (q = 0.0003). Moreover,
GRIN identiﬁed 11 loci with a signiﬁcant number of overlapping
losses and 16 loci with a signiﬁcant number of overlapping gains.
In this example, GRIN clearly identiﬁed the greatest number of
loci as signiﬁcant. This is consistent with the simulation study
showing that GRIN has greater statistical power than the other
methods.

We also performed marker, gene and gene-set GRIN analysis
of all genomic lesions (Supplementary Table S2). The marker-
level GRIN analysis identiﬁed 47 loci with a signiﬁcant number
of overlaps [deﬁned by Equation (3)] and 37 loci with a signiﬁ-
cant number of subjects with at least one overlap [deﬁned by
Equation (7)]. The gene-level GRIN analysis computed overlap
statistics and P-values for each of 29176 genes (Supplementary
Table S3). This analysis found that seven genes (AMLI, SUZIZ,
ET V6, JAK3, T RG@, FBX W7 and T RDDZ) have a signiﬁcant
number of overlaps and that three genes (AMLI, JAK3 and
SUZIZ) have a signiﬁcant number of subjects with at least one
overlap. These genes are targeted by a variety of lesion types
including structural rearrangements and sequence mutations as
well as copy number alterations. Zhang et al. (2012) describe the
biological relevance of these lesions.

Finally, we used GRIN to test the overlap of lesions with the
gene loci for each of 192 KEGG pathways (Supplementary Table
S4). This analysis found one pathway (dorsoventral axis forma-
tion) with a signiﬁcant number of overlaps. GRIN also found
three pathways (dorsoventral axis formation, melanoma and
acute myeloid leukemia) with a signiﬁcant number of lesions
that overlap at least one F LI [h. of Equation (5)]. GRIN found
that the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) pathway has a signiﬁ-
cant number of subjects with at least one overlap [deﬁned by
Equation (7)]. This result and the observation that ETP-ALL
has expression patterns similar to AML suggest that myeloid-
directed therapies may be effective treatment for ETP-ALL
(Zhang et al., 2012).

3.3 Hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia

Holmfeldt et al. (2013) performed a detailed study of hypodi—
ploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Hypodiploid acute lympho-
blastic leukemia is an extremely aneuploid tumor that exhibits
somatic loss of at least 10 whole chromosomes. Occassionally,
the tumor genome duplicates after the initial acquisition of
aneuploidy. Holmfeldt et al. (2013) studied 140 cases using a
variety of technologies; we use their WGS data for 20 subjects
(Fig. 3C) as our example below.

rectangles. The columns correspond to subjects, and rows correspond to genomic loci. The chromosome is indicated by the vertical gray and white bar to
the left. The type of lesion is indicated by the color legend at the bottom. Panel (B) shows the log10(q) values as horizontal bars with scale indicated at the
bottom. The log10(q) values for gains extend to the right and the log10(q) values for losses extend to the left. The methods are indicated by different colors
as shown in the legend at the bottom. The vertical black and white bar in the middle indicates chromosome. Panels (C) and (D) show the analogous
information for the hypodiploid leukemia dataset. The Manhattan-style plots are truncated at —log10(q) = 6

We applied marker-level GRIN and the other methods to the
copy number gains and losses of this dataset (Fig. 3D,
Supplementary Table S5). Again, we considered results with
q 5 0.01 to be statistically signiﬁcant. SAIC identiﬁed loss of
chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 13 and 14 and gain of chromosome
21 as signiﬁcant but did not identify any focal region as signiﬁ-
cant. TAGCNA identiﬁed the T-cell rearrangement and immu-
noglobin heavy (IGH) loci as regions with a signiﬁcant number
of losses. These loci are validated deletions that arise during
normal lymphoid development rather than alterations that are
speciﬁc to leukemic cells. GISTIC 2.0 found ﬁve loci with a sig-
niﬁcant number of gains and nine loci with a signiﬁcant number
of losses. Thirteen of these 14 loci are related to normal lymphoid
development; the other locus overlaps the RBI tumor suppressor
gene. GRIN identiﬁed 55 loci with a signiﬁcant number of losses
and 11 loci with a signiﬁcant number of gains. GRIN captured
every focal locus identiﬁed as signiﬁcant by GISTIC 2.0 or
TAGCNA except for the number of gains in the TRA cluster
(for which GRIN obtained q = 0.10). GRIN identiﬁed many
genes of known relevance to leukemia or other cancers such as
CDKN2A, CDKNZB, RBI and CREBBP.

We also applied GRIN to all lesions in the hypodiploid
dataset. The marker level analysis determined that 62 loci have
a signiﬁcant total number of overlaps and that 147 loci have a
signiﬁcant number of subjects with at least one overlap
(Supplementary Table S6). The gene-level analysis found that
1861 genes have a signiﬁcant number of overlapping lesions
and 2271 genes have a signiﬁcant number of subjects with an
overlapping lesion (Supplementary Table S7; note that many of
these genes belong to gene clusters). The gene-set analysis deter-
mined that 75 gene-sets have a signiﬁcant total number of over-
laps and 52 gene-sets have a signiﬁcant number of lesions that
overlap at least one F LI (Supplementary Table S8). Many of the
signiﬁcant gene-sets deﬁne biological processes related to cancer
(cell cycle, apoptosis, P53 signaling, etc), are involved in various
forms of cancer (chronic myeloid leukemia, melanoma, prostate
cancer, basal cell carcinoma, glioma, etc) or are involved in hem-
atopoietic processes (T-cell receptor signaling, B-cell receptor
signaling, hematopoietic cell lineage). No KEGG pathway had
a signiﬁcant number of subjects with at least one overlap accord-
ing to the GRIN model because such a large portion of each
subject’s genome is affected in this disease.

Genomic random interval model

 

4 DISCUSSION

Genomic lesion data can provide useful insights regarding the
development and prognosis of cancer. A thorough interpretation
of genomic lesion data includes a statistical analysis that allows
investigators to prioritize some ﬁndings by attributing other ﬁnd-
ings to random chance. The statistical challenge is to formally
deﬁne and apply a biologically meaningful model of chance. The
POM model has been used to develop analysis tools that have
been useful in some studies. However, the POM does not have an
explicit representation on the genome. Intuitively, it should be
possible to further improve performance by developing a statis-
tical model with an explicit genomic representation.

Therefore, we propose GRIN as a model and analysis method
that explicitly represents lesions as contiguous entities with dis-
tinct loci on the reference genome. With this explicit genomic
representation, the GRIN model achieves several statistical,
computational and practical advantages over the widely used
POM model. First, the multiplicity of the GRIN model is
much less than that of the POM model. Each lesion is one
random event under the GRIN model; however, there is one
random event for each marker in each tumor under the POM
model. In most applications, each tumor has orders of magnitude
fewer lesions than markers. Thus, by reducing the multiplicity by
orders of magnitude, GRIN simpliﬁes the technical interpret-
ation of the statistical analysis results. Additionally, GRIN de-
ﬁnes simple null distributions for statistics that measure the
abundance of lesions that overlap any ﬁxed locus or set of loci
in the genome. In this way, GRIN can simultaneously perform
marker, gene and gene-set level analyses. In contrast, the POM
model deﬁnes a simple null distribution only for the number of
lesions that affect a point locus. The POM model conceptually
deﬁnes a null distribution for the number of lesions that overlap
a gene or gene-set, but this null distribution must be approxi-
mated computationally by simulation or permutation.
Moreover, the statistical power of an analysis that uses the
POM model to determine the signiﬁcance of the number of le-
sions that overlap a gene or a gene-set would be extremely small
due to the multiplicity of the POM model described in Section
2.6. Thus, GRIN provides a computationally efﬁcient way to
evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of patterns such as lesions
affecting different loci within the same gene or gene-set.

There are a number of extensions and related problems that
should be explored in future research. The model proposed here
restricts the GRINs to have ﬁxed length. The GRIN model can
be generalized to allow GRINs to have random lengths. We are
currently exploring ways to incorporate random length GRINs
into our model. These models may further enrich our under-
standing of how to statistically interpret genomic lesion data.
The interpretation of any statistical analysis depends on the
underlying statistical model. These models will interrogate
statistical signiﬁcance against a more general concept of
randomness.

It is also interesting to consider how to integrate other sources
of genomic data to identify important loci in cancer. Some

methods have been developed that perform an integrative ana-
lysis of genomic lesion data and expression data. Witten et al.
(2009) and Witten and Tibshirani (2009) propose sparse canon-
ical correlation analysis method to characterize the relationships
between copy number and expression data. F ontanillo et al.
(2012) also propose methods to perform an integrated analysis
of expression and copy number data to identify important gen-
omic alterations in cancer. It may be possible to use GRIN in
conjunction with these methods in innovative ways to enhance
our ability to expand our understanding of cancer biology. For
example, GRIN may be used to identify speciﬁc pathways for a
focused exploration of the association of genomic lesions with
the expression of genes in those pathways.

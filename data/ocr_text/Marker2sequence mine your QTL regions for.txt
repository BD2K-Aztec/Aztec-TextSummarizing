ABSTRACT

Summary: Marker2sequence (M2S) aims at mining quantitative trait
loci (QTLs) for candidate genes. For each gene, within the QTL region,
M2S uses data integration technology to integrate putative gene
function with associated gene ontology terms, proteins, pathways
and literature. As a typical QTL region easily contains several
hundreds of genes, this gene list can then be further filtered using
a keyword-based query on the aggregated annotations. M2S will
help breeders to identify potential candidate genes for their traits of
interest.

1 INTRODUCTION

Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are regions on the genome statistically
associated with a phenotype. Plant breeders aim to introgress these
regions from a donor parent to improve a cultivar (Zamir, 2001).
However, a typical QTL region may contain hundreds of genes,
including genes negatively inﬂuencing the breeding goals. Complete
genome sequences of many crop plants are becoming available,
including the genome of important food crops such as tomato (the
International Tomato Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2012) and
potato (the Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2011). The
availability of structural and functional genome annotations makes
it possible to investigate the QTL region for genes positively or
negatively inﬂuencing the trait of interest. A tool that offers this
functionality is GBrowse (Stein et al., 2002). However, exploring
several hundreds of putative candidate genes with GBrowse will
still be a lot of work, as limited information is available for
each gene.

Identiﬁcation of putative candidate genes can be improved using
data integration approaches. Biologically relevant knowledge about,
for example, gene ontology (G0; The Gene Ontology Consortium,
2000), protein functions or metabolic pathways can be combined
with expert knowledge about the trait under investigation. The
basic principle of Semantic Web technology is to integrate different

types of data from different sources using standardized ontologies
(Berners-Lee et al., 2001). Important resources such as UniProt
(Redaschi and UniProt Consortium, 2009) and GO have become
available in a Resource Description Framework (RDF; http://www.
w3.org/TR/rdf—primerl) format allowing data integration against
these resources.

Our research aims to develop a tool, called Marker2sequence
(M2S), which plant breeders can use to identify the putative
candidate gene for their QTL. We describe how M2S uses semantic
data integration approaches to obtain available information for each
gene model and combine this with a keyword-based search function
to mine for the appropriate candidate gene. M2S, by design, can
work with any genome annotation, but we show the functionality of
M2S, using the tomato genome annotation.

2 DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

M28 is a web-based tool using Java EE 6 and the Struts framework
(V1.3.10). It runs on a Glassﬁsh (V3.1) application server. M2S relies
on the availability of a genome annotation and reference genetic
linkage map in RDF format. A utility, gff2RDF, has been developed
to perform the conversion of the tomato, potato and Arabidopsis
genome annotation and linkage maps to the RDF format. It is
available at https://github.com/PBR/gff2RDF. This utility extracts
for all genes their location, human readable description, associated
GO term identiﬁer and associated UniProt protein identiﬁers (Jain
et al., 2009) from the annotation. For Tomato, the EXPEN 2000 map
was used as reference linkage map (Fulton et al., 2002). The Jena
library (Carroll et al., 2004) is used to build the RDF model and write
it to disk. These graphs were loaded into a Virtuoso open-source
edition (version 6.1.3) (Erling and Mikhailov, 2007) triple store
together with the GO (version 2011_11_03) and UniProt (version
2011_10). Any triple store with a SPARQL endpoint can be used
with M2S.

M2S can handle three types of inputs (Supplementary Fig. S1).
The ﬁrst two inputs are two markers ﬂanking the QTL region
or a list of markers spanning the QTL region. These markers
should have a physical position on the genome sequence or a
position on the reference linkage map. The third input requires a
genomic region using the format Chr:start..stop. Either input leads
to a summary page divided into three sections; the top section
shows the alignment of the reference genetic map with the genomic
information, which helps to identify problems in the genetic map or
the assembly of the genome. The lower section consists of three
tabs. The ﬁrst tab contains a list of all genes in the speciﬁed

region, with their location and human readable description. The
second tab lists all the markers within the region. The third tab
shows the genetic map for the speciﬁed region. Each list can
be exported into a spreadsheet-compatible format or a pdf. The
gene list can be searched using a keyword through the box in the
middle section. This search is performed using SPARQL (http://
www.w3.org/TR/rdf—sparql-queryl) on all available resources and
returns any gene with a matching keyword in any of the queried
databases.

The details for each gene (Supplementary Fig. S2) include
information retrieved from the genome, the GO terms, the proteins
(UniProt), pathways (UniPathway) and literature associated with
these proteins. The G0 terms are obtained from the genome
annotation and, for tomato, from AFAWE (J ocker et al., 2008). This
data integration aids the end-user to determine whether this gene is
a good candidate for the trait of interest.

3 EXAMPLE

,B-Carotene content is a trait inﬂuencing the color of tomatoes
(Lincoln and Porter, 1949). Based on our QTL analysis, using
data from the Solanum lycopersicum X Solanum galapagense
LA0483 RIL population (Paran et al., 1995), this compound has
QTLs on chromosomes 3 (between TG130 and TG74) and 6
(between TG253 and TG314). M2S identiﬁed 2003 genes on
chromosome 3 and 988 genes on chromosome 6. A query with
the keyword ‘beta—carotene’ returns the gene Solch3 g007960.1.1
on chromosome 3 and the gene Solch6g074240.1.1 on
chromosome 6. The gene Solch3g007960.1.1 has the description
‘carotene beta-hydroxylase’, and is associated with the GO
term ‘carotene beta-ring hydroxylase activity’, the protein ‘beta—
carotene hydroxylase’ and the pathway for ‘carotenoid biosynthesis’.
The gene Solch6g074240.1.1 is associated with the GO
term ‘carotenoid biosynthetic process’, the pathway ‘carotenoid
biosynthesis’ and more speciﬁcally, it is part of ‘beta—carotene
biosynthesis’. Information for each gene can be quickly mined
using M28 and both genes are candidates for our trait of
interest.

4 CONCLUSIONS

M2S provide plant breeders with a way to obtain all annotated gene
models in a QTL region, to query, over multiple databases, within
the QTL region of interest and an extensive summary for each gene

model. M2S will help breeders to identify potential candidate genes
for their traits of interest.

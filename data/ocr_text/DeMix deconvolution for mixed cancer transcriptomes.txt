ABSTRACT

Motivation: Tissue samples of tumor cells mixed with stromal cells
cause underdetection of gene expression signatures associated with
cancer prognosis or response to treatment. In silico dissection of
mixed cell samples is essential for analyzing expression data gener-
ated in cancer studies. Currently, a systematic approach is lacking to
address three challenges in computational deconvolution: (i) violation
of linear addition of expression levels from multiple tissues when log-
transformed microarray data are used; (ii) estimation of both tumor
proportion and tumor-specific expression, when neither is known a
priori; and (iii) estimation of expression profiles for individual patients.
Results: We have developed a statistical method for deconvolving
mixed cancer transcriptomes, DeMix, which addresses the aforemen-
tioned issues in array-based expression data. We demonstrate the
performance of our model in synthetic and real, publicly available,
datasets. DeMix can be applied to ongoing biomarker-based clinical
studies and to the vast expression datasets previously generated from
mixed tumor and stromal cell samples.

tion, which is available at http://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~wwang7/

1 INTRODUCTION

Solid tissue samples frequently consist of two distinct compo-
nents, glandular epithelium and its surrounding stroma.
Traditional analytic approaches that ignore the presence of
tissue heterogeneity may suffer from inaccurate transcriptional
profiling and are likely to miss important genes that are related
to shaping cancers. To remove heterogeneity in tumor samples,
researchers can use laser capture microdissection (Emmert-Buck
et al., 1996) to physically isolate the different tissue components.
However, this technique is time-consuming, costly and requires
special equipment that is not available at all institutes. Thus, it is

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

of substantial interest to isolate expression data from mixed sam-
ples in silico.

In biomarker-based clinical trials, microarray gene expression
data are actively studied to profile transcriptions of hundreds of
cancer patients (Tsao et al., 2012). Current methods for dissect-
ing array-based expression data (Abbas et al., 2009; Clarke et al.,
2010; Erkkila et al., 2010; Ghosh, 2004; Gosink et al., 2007; Lu
et al., 2003; Qiao et al., 2012; Stuart 61 al., 2004; Tothill et al.,
2005; Venet et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2006) are limited in their
application to actual data for the three following reasons.

First, existing methods assume a linear mixture of expression
levels, as presented by log-transformed data. This assumption,
recently shown to be invalid, can distort the estimation of tissue-
specific expressions (Zhong and Liu, 2011). We describe this
linear assumption by AX :3, where A is a matrix of individual
tissue-speciﬁc expression, X is a vector of mixture proportions
and B is a vector of observed expressions. Zhong and Liu (2011)
showed that raw measured data should be used for input B.
When log-transformed ﬂuorescent intensity data are used in-
stead, the output A is underestimated. The convention of using
log-transformed expression data started because such data were
shown empirically to follow a normal distribution (Carvalho
et al., 2007), which is straightforward for model building and
parameter estimation. No available model-based methods are
designed to analyze data from heterogeneous tumor samples
before the data are log-transformed.

Second, the available methods do not provide a practical way
to jointly estimate both tissue proportions (X) and tissue-speciﬁc
expressions (A). Most methods require good knowledge of one of
these measures. The tissue-speciﬁc expressions (A) can be derived
from a set of genes with known expression proﬁles in all consti-
tuting tissue types (Lu et al., 2003; Qiao et al., 2012) or from a set
of genes that show significant enrichment in one of the tissue
types (Tothill et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006). Other methods
focus on deconvolution of gene expressions based on known
tissue proportions (Erkkil'a et al., 2010; Ghosh, 2004; Shen-Orr
et al., 2010; Stuart et al., 2004). Erkkila et al. (2010) implemented
a Bayesian model to assess the tissue proportions as well as gene
expression levels, using strong previous information on the pro-
portions. Qiao et al. (2012) took reference profiles from all tissue
components and allowed for adjustments in tissue-speciﬁc ex-
pression levels from the reference profiles. Clarke et a]. (2010)

developed a geometry-based method to estimate mixture propor-
tions without knowledge of all tissue-speciﬁc expressions, which
directly improved the method of Gosink et al. (2007), but did not
deconvolve individual gene expressions.

Third, previous methods have focused on estimating the mean
tissue-speciﬁc expressions for each gene and thus are not applic-
able to estimating individual expression levels in each sample and
each gene. Methods for in silico dissection of individual gene
expression proﬁles are urgently needed. It is straightforward to
compute these individual proﬁles in a matched design, where the
mixed sample and one pure tissue sample are obtained from the
same individual. In a more commonly observed unmatched
design, where tissue samples are derived from mixed and pure
tissues from different individuals, no methods are available to
deconvolve these individual proﬁles, yet downstream biomarker
analyses depend on the accuracy of these proﬁles.

To bridge the gap from current methods to actual applica-
tions, we propose a statistical approach for deconvolving
mixed cancer transcriptomes, DeMix. Our method supports the
analysis of mixed tissue samples under four data scenarios, with
or without reference genes, and with a matched or unmatched
design. Here, reference genes are a set of genes for which expres-
sion proﬁles have been accurately estimated based on external
data in all constituting tissue types. We anticipate that DeMix
can broaden the investigation of mixed samples and increase the
accuracy of downstream transcriptome analysis. The rest of this
article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we brieﬂy explain the
general framework of DeMix and describe four strategies in
detail. In Section 3, we conduct a simulation study and a valid-
ation study using publicly available data. We provide concluding
remarks and potential extensions of our method in Section 4.

2 METHODS

We let Nig and Tig denote the expression level for a gene g, g = l, . . . , G
from the pure normal and tumor tissues, respectively, which are derived
from sample i for i: l, ..., S. We do not observe the pure tumor ex-
pression T ,g. Instead, we observe Yig, which denotes the expression level
of a clinically derived tumor sample i for gene g. We let 7r,- denote the
proportion of tumor tissue in sample i, which is also unknown. We write

a linear equation on the raw measured data as
Yig =77iﬁg+(1_77i)Nig- 

Here, the 71,- for sample i represents the proportion of cells in tumor
tissues, which remains the same across genes. We further assume that
Nig ~ LN(uNg,o]2Vg) and Tig ~ LN(uTg,o%g) where LN represents
log2 Normal distribution because the log transformed data were
shown to empirically follow a normal distribution (Carvalho et al., 2007).

The fundamental challenge of deconvolution is how we predict T ’s,
given that we observe the Y’s and N ’s without previous information on
the T ’s and 71’s. If only a single sample were available, this would be an
unsolvable problem, as both 71’s and T ’s are unknown. However, simul-
taneous analysis of several samples can teach us: to what extent a gene is
component speciﬁc, in which component a gene is likely to be expressed
more or less, and how variable a gene is across samples. These elements
allow us to make predictions on the 71’s and T ’s. Note that the roles of
tumor and normal tissues can be swapped, i.e. we can observe the pure
tumor expression T ’s and make inference about the unobserved N ’s from
the heterogeneous sample Y’s. Another challenge lies in the distribution
of Y, which does not follow a log2 Normal distribution when both Nig
and Tig follow a log2 Normal distribution. With this in mind, our method

mainly consists of two steps: (i) given the Y’s and the distribution of the
N’s, we search for a set of {71, MT,02T} that maximize the likelihood of
observing Y; (ii) given the 71’s and the distributions of the T ’s and N ’s, we
estimate an individual pair of (T, N) for each sample and each gene.
Below, we describe these steps for speciﬁc data scenarios.

2.1 Data scenario 1: unmatched tumor and normal
samples, without reference genes

This is a general and common data scenario. We observe Yig, i = l, . . . , S
and a set of unmatched observations of normal samples. We ﬁrst obtain
the sample mean and variance (ﬁNg, 612%,) under the log2 Normal distri-
bution for the normal tissue samples. This allows us to initialize nig, which
cannot be observed from the unmatched samples (see the Appendix for
details). Unlike a mixture of normal distributions generating a normal
distribution (for log-transformed data), the distribution of Y as a mixture
of two log2 Normal distributions does not have a closed form. We, there-
fore, estimate 71, and 7,-g as follows.

(1) Obtain an optimal set of {7%,};11 along with {ﬁTg,6%g} using the
Nelder—Mead procedure (Nelder and Mead, 1965). This set should
maximize the likelihood for observing the expression levels Y’s, i.e.
 HgfyigO/ig) (see the Appendix for details).

(2) Given yig, 7%,, ﬁNg, ﬁTg, 612%,, (ﬁg, we further deconvolve yig into nig
and 7,-g. The values of 7,-g and nig are reconstituted gene expression
levels of pure tumor and normal tissue corresponding to subject i
and gene g. Given 7%,, we can write nig as a function of yig and 7,-g.
We search for a value of 7,-g that is most likely to be presented given
the LN distributions of N and T (see geometric illustration in
Supplementary Fig. S1):

A A2  _  A A2
argmaxlig¢(t,-g|uTg,ng)¢( lg1 _ ﬂilg lMNgsaNg) (2)
l

where ¢(-| u, 02) is a log2 Normal density with corresponding mean u and
variance 02.

Our algorithm initializes nig and iterates (usually a couple of times)
between Steps 1 and 2 (n,-g is updated using fig), until the change in fig
between two consecutive iterations is <l%.

2.2 Data scenario 2: matched tumor and normal samples,
without reference genes
We do not need to initialize a known nig, and can replace Step 2 with
fig = {yig — (1 — ﬁi)nig}/7%i- (3)
We estimate 7%,- by following the same steps described in Section 2.1.

The fig can have negative values for some genes, in which case we set 7,-g at
0 and exclude these genes from the likelihood computation.

2.3 Data scenario 3: unmatched tumor and normal
samples, with reference genes

We derive the tumor expression level distribution (with ﬁTg and 62Tg) for a
reference gene set, as denoted by G’. Then under the linear relationship
(1), we follow procedures as described in Section 2.1, except for the
Nelder—Mead optimization procedure in Step 1. Instead, to estimate 71,-,
we do the following:

argminm {yig — (1 — 7Ti)nig}/7Ti — ﬁTgll/‘inggs (4)
geG’
where H - II is a L1 norm.

DeMix

 

2.4 Data scenario 4: matched tumor and normal samples,
with reference genes
This is a most desirable but uncommonly observed data scenario. We ﬁrst

estimate 7%, using Equation (4) given ﬁTg and 62Tg for a set of reference
genes, then estimate ﬁg using Equation (3).

2.5 Methods for comparison

For comparison purposes, we implemented a linear model (LM) for the
log-transformed data. This model estimates tumor proportions and gene
expressions by assuming a normal distribution on the normal, tumor and
mixed tissue samples. Following a similar procedure as in DeMix, we
estimated associated parameters, as they maximize the likelihood of
observing the logz-transformed expression values from the mixed tissue
samples (see the Appendix for details). In addition, we present results
based on a non-mixture model (NM), which ignores tumor heterogeneity
(7% = 1 for all tumor samples).

2.6 Uncertainty measure

We applied a standard bootstrap method (Efron, 1979) to estimate the
uncertainty on the tumor proportion estimates 7%,. Given the set of genes
used for deconvolution, e.g. all genes denoted by G or reference genes
denoted by G’, we sampled these genes with replacement for m times
(m: 50) and obtained a set of estimates for each experiment:
{7%(1), ...,/7%(m)}. Then, we calculated the standard deviations of 7% as
standard errors.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulation

We used simulation to assess the performance of our approach in
estimating unobserved tissue proportions and reconstituting un-
observed tissue-speciﬁc expressions. Deconvolutions in matched
designs with or without reference genes and in unmatched de-
signs with reference genes are reported in the Supplementary
Materials (Supplementary Figs S2—S4). Here, we present results
from the unmatched design without reference genes (Section 2.1).

We simulated datasets as follows: 20 samples, 10 of pure
A-type and 10 of mixed tissues. For the 10 mixed tissue samples,
we assigned B-type tissue fractions, 7%,s, at evenly spaced values
from 0.1 to 0.9. In each sample, we simulated expression levels
for 2000 genes and randomly selected 25% (500 genes) to be
differentially expressed (DE) when comparing A-type with B-
type samples. We assumed the expression levels to follow
log2 Normal distributions with mean and variance as follows.
For A-type tissues, a vector consisting of means
,uNg, g = l, ...,2000 was generated independently from
N(7,22). For DE genes in B-type cell samples, the means of
the A-type tissue samples were added by ,Bg,g = l, ...,2000,
where we generated ,Bg ~N(4, 1.52). For non-DE genes, ,Bgs
were sampled from N(0, 0.22). Across 10 pairs of A and B-type
tissue samples, the sample-wise standard deviation at a given
gene was set at 0.2. Then, we mixed the 10 A-type and B-type
tissue sample expressions linearly at assigned proportions based
on Equation (1). By doing so, we created 10 heterogeneous sam-
ples along with 10 observed A-type tissue samples. The 10 B-type
tissue samples were hidden and used for validation. We repeated
this procedure to generate 200 replicate datasets.

In Figure 1, we present results of the biases and mean-squared
errors (MSEs) with respect to our estimation of B-type tissue
proportion 7%,s. Compared with LM, DeMix resulted in substan-
tially smaller biases and MSEs. LM performed worse at estimat-
ing proportions as the true proportion decreased. In contrast,
DeMix performed well across all values of 7%. This uniformity
in performance is desirable because the actual tumor proportions
will be unobserved in real data. As an example, at 7% = 0.1, we
observed biases of 0.02 for DeMix and 0.28 (14-fold larger) for
LM; at 7% = 0.9, the bias was 0.02 for both DeMix and LM.

To evaluate how well DeMix reconstituted the B-type tissue
expression level, we used an integrated relative mean-squared
error (IRMSE) to quantify the discrepancy between the true

expression (t,g) and the estimated pure tissue expression (ﬁg) for
sample i and gene g: A 2 A

IRMSE =   We estimated t,g using DeMix,
LM and NM, respectively. Figure 1 shows that our approach
outperformed the LM and NM in estimating pure gene expres-
sions. Again, as the actual B-type tissue proportion increased to
a value close to l, the LM and even the NM (no deconvolution)
provided gene expression levels close to the truth. This suggests
that DeMix provides the best improvement when analyzing het-
erogeneous samples with low to medium tumor proportions.
Without knowledge of the true gene expression levels, however,
we cannot obtain information on tumor proportions a priori,
which vary across samples. When the true B-type tissue propor-
tion was low, the LM performed better than the NM, but at a
degree that was not comparable with the performance of DeMix.
The monotonic trend in the bias from the LM can be explained
by our simulation settings. Here, we assume all differentially ex-
pressed genes were overexpressed in the tumor tissue as com-
pared with the normal tissue. When all tumor tissue
expressions are underexpressed compared with the normal
tissue expressions, however, this trend can be reversed
(Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).

3.2 Data example

To validate our method using real data under data scenario 1
(Section 2.1), we analyzed four public gene expression datasets,
which are generated by artiﬁcially mixing tissues at varying
proportions.

0 We downloaded dataset GSE19830 from the GEO website
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). This dataset was origin-
ally generated from rat microarray experiments (Shen-Orr
et al., 2010) with Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Arrays
and consists of 12 mixed samples of liver and brain tissues in
four proportions (Supplementary Table S1) and 3 samples
each from pure liver and brain tissues.

0 We obtained two datasets within GSE5350 from GEO:
Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays generated
by the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project
(MAQC Consortium, 2006). The RNA samples consist of
isolated 100% Stratagene Universal Human Reference
RNA (A) and 100% Ambion Human Brain Reference
RNA (B) and their mixtures in varying proportions. Ten
samples were processed using Affymetrix platform
(Affymetric Inc., 2012), and 10 samples were processed
using Illumina platform (Illumina Inc., 2009) denoted as
MAQC sites 1 and 3, respectively.

0 We downloaded Affymetrix array data from http://www.
affymetrix.com/support/technical/sample_data/gene_l_0_
array_data.affx. This dataset consists of samples with varying
proportions of human brain and heart tissues. We selected 18
samples with proportion ratios of 0/100% (three samples),
25%/75% (three samples), 50%/50% (six samples), 75%/
25% (three samples) and 100%/0 (three samples).

To summarize the probe intensities in all datasets, we used the
robust multi-array averaging (RMA) procedure (Irizarry et al.,
2003), as implemented in R (R Development Core Team, 2009)

and bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org). To maintain
computational efﬁciency and remove probes with high
background noise, we selected a subset of genes to be analyzed
by DeMix. We required the mean expression levels of these genes
in pure normal tissue samples to be in the upper quartile of the
expression levels of all genes. This provided us with 7000—14 000
probesets across all datasets.

With pre-processed raw measured data, we conﬁrmed that
assuming a linear mixture on the data before they are log-trans-
formed is appropriate, as compared with assuming it on the
log-transformed data. This can be done when we know T, N
and Y, from which we derive 7% =  Speciﬁcally, in dataset
GSE19830, we compared the differences in transcript abun-
dances between the pure liver and brain tissues (T —N), with dif-
ferences between the mixed and brain tissues (Y- N), both at the
original scale (Fig. 2a) and at the log 2 scale (Fig. 2b). The linear
relationship AX: B ﬁts well with the raw measured data, with a
few deviations in genes at extreme values, e.g. at IT — N | > 5000.
In the log-scale data, however, the linearity assumption does not
hold when the abundance ratio between two tissues is >2-fold.

First, we evaluated how well DeMix estimated tissue propor-
tions in these datasets (Fig. 3). Without using previous know-
ledge of tissue-speciﬁc expression from both components of the
mixture, as in other methods (Shen-Orr et al., 2010), DeMix
correctly estimated the unknown tissue proportions with a cor-
relation coefﬁcient, r, of 0.98. In contrast, LM consistently over-
estimated the tissue proportions, likely because of the concavity
property of log functions, as explained by Zhong and Liu (2011).
Of 47 samples, all estimates from GSE19830 and MAQC site 1
presented 95% conﬁdence intervals that included the truth, or
less often, with one boundary l—2% away from the truth (see
also Supplementary Table S1). We observed three samples from

Affymetrix and two samples from MAQC site 3 that presented
overestimated proportions. The ﬁrst overestimation was likely
caused by deviation from the linearity assumption, which we
diagnosed using scatter plots of (T —N) versus (Y—N)
(Supplementary Fig. S5). With the normalized raw measured
data, we still observed a curvature in the three samples, with
many data points at both extremes of the (Y—N) values unevenly
distributed on top of an expected line of 25% (the true propor-
tion). The second overestimation was likely caused by issues in
data quality. We compared the MA plots of all ﬁve samples
generated at the same proportion of 25% for the MAQC site 3
data (Supplementary Fig. S6). We observed larger variations in
probe intensities for samples 1 and 3 compared with those of the
other three samples (respective inter-quartile ranges of 0.19 and
0.18 versus 0.06, 0.08 and 0.05). We obtained similar results
when analyzing the four datasets with probesets presenting ex-
pression levels >26 in the normal samples (35—49% of all probe-
sets, Supplementary Fig. S7). We observed overestimation in
tissue proportions in the same ﬁve samples.

Next, we examined how well DeMix reconstituted pure tissue-
type expressions at four different proportions using the
GSE19830 data as an example. As shown in a heatmap

(Fig. 4a), DeMix removed mixed-in gene expressions from
brain tissue samples at different mixture proportions. It provided
individual gene expression levels from pure liver tissue that are
more homogeneous across 12 samples than they were before
deconvolution, and more similar to the actual gene expressions
in pure liver tissue. Figure 4b shows the estimated expressions
from pure liver tissue are highly correlated with the true expres-
sions (correlation coefﬁcient r>0.88). Within each sample, we
achieved greater accuracy when the gene expression levels were
high for pure samples, as low expression levels may be

overrepresented by a high level of background noise. We ob-
tained similar results from the other three datasets, and lower
correlation coefﬁcients in samples where the proportion esti-
mates were signiﬁcantly different from the truth (Supplementary
Fig. S8).

Finally, we illustrated the use of DeMix in ﬁnding DE genes,
again using the GSE19830 dataset as an example. Figure 5 shows
the number of signiﬁcant genes (found by a two-sample t—test)
between liver and brain tissue samples at varying cut-offs of the
P—values (Bonferroni corrected). At an initial cut-off of 0.05,
DeMix-based deconvolution found 4774 DE genes, which was
~l.3 times more than those found by LM (3598) and 9 times
more than those found by NM (523). We also directly compared
the observed pure brain and pure liver tissue samples. Given a
relatively small sample size (3 versus 3, as compared to 12 versus
3 from mixed samples), we found only 1900 genes, 2.5 times
fewer than the amount found with DeMix. Even though these
1900 genes largely overlapped with the 4774 genes found by
DeMix, the different sample size, and hence the different statis-
tical power, prohibited us from using these 1900 genes as truth.
The issue of small sample size is also supported by an observa-
tion that at a P—value cut-off of 30.001, the NM (not considering
heterogeneity) yielded a higher number of DE genes than the
‘pure’ samples. As we lowered the cut-off on P—value, we
found more DE genes with DeMix. We tested the homogeneity
among 12 deconvolved samples by performing two-sample t-tests
between six randomly selected deconvolved samples against the
remaining six samples. At a P—value cut-off of 0.05, we did not
ﬁnd any signiﬁcant DE genes. These results suggest that DeMix-
based deconvolution is able to make mean differences more dis-
tinct between two tissue samples and reduces variances across all
single tissue samples (Fig. 4a), both of which contributed to
increasing the power of detecting DE genes.

4 CONCLUSION

We have presented a novel statistical method, DeMix, for com-
putational dissection of gene expression levels from mixed tissue
samples, and in particular, for microarray data generated from
cancer patient samples. Our method addresses three existing
problems for in silica dissection: (i) model-based analysis of
raw measured data that follow a log2 Normal instead of a
normal distribution; (ii) estimation of both tissue proportions
and tissue-speciﬁc expression levels; and (iii) reconstitution of
patient-speciﬁc gene expressions. We also provide uncertainty
measures on estimated tissue proportions. DeMix provides prac-
tical solutions by requiring knowledge of gene expression of one
tissue type, which does not have to be matched, i.e. derived from
the same sample. Our solutions vary according to data scenarios,
to take advantage of all the available information. Both simula-
tion studies and analysis of actual data highlight the importance
of following a linear mixture of gene expression levels on data
before they are log-transformed, for which DeMix is the ﬁrst
method to do so. Our validation study showed that DeMix per-
forms accurately on expression data generated from both
Affymetrix and Illumina platforms. Our method can be applied
to analyzing newly generated expression data from biomarker
studies, as well as to re—analyzing data generated from previous
studies.

Our method is useful when there is little information on gene
expression levels in one of the mixing components, and at the
same time the mixing proportions, which could be obtained from
other sources such as pathologist estimates or from DNA copy
number data (Y au et al., 2010), are not available. We do not
require knowledge of reference genes. However, when such
knowledge is available, we have provided an alternative solution
to take advantage of the information. Even though our algo-
rithm requires a minimum of one gene as a reference gene, we
recommend using at least 5—10 genes to alleviate the potential
inﬂuence from outliers and to identify an optimal set of 7%s.
DeMix uses expression levels from thousands of genes to esti-
mate each 7% and is, therefore, robust to perturbations in the
expression of a minority of genes, arising from interaction with
surrounding tumor cells. DeMix can also use a list of selected
genes that are not affected by the tumor, when available, for the
estimation of proportions. If cell proportions are estimated reli-
ably, they can also be used to estimate mean expression levels in
both normal and tumor tissues for potentially perturbed genes,
based on the linear relationship AX = B on raw measured data.
When reference genes are considered, DeMix performed simi-
larly or better than PERT (Qiao et al., 2012) in estimating
tissue proportions with our validation data (Supplementary
Figs S9 and S10).

Our estimation procedure under matched or unmatched sam-
ples with reference genes is computationally efﬁcient. On a PC
with a 2.2 GHz Intel Core I7 processor, the computation of our
simulation data consisting of 20 matched samples and 2000 genes
in each sample takes ~l s. In contrast, it takes ~10 min to com-
plete the computation of the same data without knowledge of
any reference genes. We used the Nelder—Mead optimization
procedure that includes a numerical integration of the joint dens-
ity, which may explain this substantial increase in computation
time. DeMix takes a two-stage approach by ﬁrst estimating the

7%,’s and then estimating the means and variances of gene expres-
sions based on the 7%,’s. A joint model that estimates all param-
eters simultaneously will be able to further incorporate the
uncertainty measure of the tissue proportions. However, the es-
timation step from such a model can be computationally inten-
sive and may not be suitable for the analysis of high-throughput
data.

We identiﬁed a few considerations for the deconvolution
of microarray data. First, the assumed linear mixture of data
before they are log-transformed may not perfectly hold for
some samples, e.g. samples 1 to 3 from the Affymetrix data,
and for some genes, e.g. those with extreme expression
values such as <24 or >214. Second, our estimation method is
based speciﬁcally on log2 Normal distributions of the raw mea-
sured data for each mixture component. When this assumption
is violated, a deterioration of accuracy is to be expected.
Third, microarray technology has inherent limitations, such as
high background noise and inconsistent gene expressions
across experiments. Screening out genes with low expression
levels and accounting for batch effects must be tackled before
deconvolution. We found scale normalization using MAS5 can
obscure the actual linear mixture of expression levels, on which
the downstream deconvolution is based. Summarization using
RMA, together with quantile normalization, seemed to retain
our linearity assumption of the raw measured data most of the
time.

Our model assumes that a mixed sample consists of at most
two cellular compartments: normal and tumor, and that the dis-
tributional parameters of normal cells can be estimated from
other available data. These assumptions seem to us to be a lo-
gical place to begin, but there remain important situations where
more complex modeling may be needed. First, we assume pure
normal samples to be representative of the normal tissues in the
mixture samples, allowing for estimation of sample-speciﬁc ex-
pression values. This assumption can be violated as there are
sometimes perturbations of gene expression levels in tumor—stro-
mal interactions, as previously discussed. Second, both normal
and tumor tissues may in turn consist of different cell types, with
different transcriptional activity, and represented in proportions
that can be variable across samples. This has been studied in
Qiao et al. (2012), which used reference proﬁles from all cell
types. Extensions of our model to deconvolution of more than
two mixture components can address this issue without requiring
reference proﬁles from all mixing components and can be done
with a more computationally efﬁcient density integration and
optimization procedure. Currently, to identify 7%,’s, we assume
a roughly stable composition of one or multiple cell types within
each tissue component. With data from real tissue samples, it is
necessary to evaluate the extent to which this assumption is valid.
The variation in the composition of multiple cell types from
sample to sample will be captured by the variance of the distri-
bution of expression levels within each tissue, which is estimated
based on the data. When there exist multiple tumor subtypes, our
method should be applied separately to samples that belong to
the same subtype.

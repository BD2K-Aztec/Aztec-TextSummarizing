ABSTRACT

Summary: Correlating disease mutations with clinical and phenotypic
information such as drug response or patient survival is an important
goal of personalized cancer genomics and a first step in biomarker
discovery. HyperModules is a network search algorithm that finds fre-
quently mutated gene modules with significant clinical or phenotypic
signatures from biomolecular interaction networks.

Availability and implementation: HyperModules is available in
Cytoscape App Store and as a command line tool at www.baderlab.

1 INTRODUCTION

Establishing functional links between genetic variation and
human disease is a key goal of cancer genome sequencing
(Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2013) and genome-wide association stu-
dies (Hardy and Singleton, 2009). Complex diseases like cancer
are often driven by infrequent changes in multiple genes in
pathways (Vogelstein et al., 2013). Network analysis helps
interpret mutations in systems context and ﬁnd disease genes,
pathways and biomarkers for precision medicine (Barabasi
et al., 2011).

Discovery of modules (subnetworks) in biological networks
helps isolate systems with disease-related properties and reduces
interactome complexity. A growing number of methods are
available for this purpose. A landmark paper combines gene ex-
pression signatures with protein—protein interactions (PPI) to
ﬁnd predictive modules of cancer outcome (Chuang et al.,
2007). The NETBAG method studies genetic associations and
copy number variants to ﬁnd autism-related modules (Gilman
et al., 2011). HotNet detects frequently mutated pathways in
networks (Vandin et al., 2011, 2012). Net-Cox builds prognostic
cancer signatures in network analysis of gene expression data
(Zhang et al., 2013). The Reactome FI Cytoscape plugin
uncovers prognostic gene modules from networks and gene
expression data Wu and Stein, 2012). Network-based stratiﬁca-
tion predicts tumor subtypes from mutations in network regions
(Hofree et al., 2013). Such modules maximize a feature of genes

such as differential expression, disease mutation frequency or
enrichment of interactions.

Because clinical proﬁles of patients are increasingly available
in cancer genomics efforts such as the The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) pan-cancer project ONeinstein et al., 2013), new meth-
ods are needed to discover multivariate biomarkers in networks.
We recently analyzed cancer mutations in phosphorylation sig-
naling and found that kinase—substrate networks are informative
of patient survival and therapy response (Reimand and Bader,
2013; Reimand et al., 2013). In particular, we found network
modules with rare mutations in ovarian cancer patients with im-
proved prognosis. We created the HyperModules method to sys-
tematically discover clinically correlated modules from gene and
protein networks (Reimand and Bader, 2013) based on our ear-
lier work on functional subnetwork discovery (Altmae et al.,
2012; Reimand et al., 2008). Here we present the previously un-
available software in open-source Java as a command line tool
for automated work and a Cytoscape app for interactive graph-
ical analysis.

2 SOFTWARE

HyperModules assumes that clinically informative mutations of
complex disease occur in systems of closely interacting genes.
The greedy network search algorithm focuses on a local network
area, deﬁned by a central seed node (a mutated gene) and its
surrounding subnetwork. All mutated genes are sequentially con-
sidered as seeds in module discovery. Search starts from the seed
and grows the module toward increased beneﬁt by adding con-
nected genes that best improve clinical signiﬁcance. This object-
ive is driven by statistical tests where patients deﬁned by the
module are compared with other patients. Categorical clinical
variables are studied with Fisher’s exact test and survival times
with log-rank test. Cox regression is currently not supported;
however, we plan to add this feature in the future. To estab-
lish statistical signiﬁcance of detected modules, we build a null
distribution by searching networks with permuted gene
names. Each module of the true network is quantiﬁed with an
empirical P-Value reﬂecting the fraction of seed-speciﬁc modules
from shufﬁed networks exceeding the signiﬁcance of the true
module. This removes artifacts of the greedy strategy
and corrects for topological features such as highly connected
nodes.

The analysis pipeline is outlined in Figure 1. Interaction net-
works are loaded into Cytoscape using standard features
(Shannon et al., 2003). HyperModules requires gene mutations
and patient clinical information in two tables. The user selects

type of clinical analysis and columns in data table (survival time
or variable such as tumor relapse). Survival analysis requires
follow-up time and Vital status of patients. Detected modules
are studied further with network Visualization, survival curves
and data export. We tested HyperModules on protein networks
to ﬁnd survival modules with cancer mutations. We extracted
three human PPI networks of variable size from iRefWeb
(Turner et al., 2010), and ﬁve cancer mutation datasets from
the International Cancer Genome Consortium portal version
12 (Supplementary Fig. S1). For example, network analysis of
30 000 interactions with 121 liver cancer patients, 686 mutated
genes and 10000 permutations takes 10min on an 8-core com-
puter with 16 GB RAM. HyperModules is thus applicable to a
range of networks and mutation datasets.

3 EXAMPLE ANALYSIS

An example dataset is provided in Supplementary File Sl. It
comprises 183 ovarian cancer patients from the TCGA study
(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008) and the net-
work of 4823 kinase—substrate interactions from our earlier
study (Reimand and Bader, 2013). The ovarian cancer mutations
are restricted to 163 proteins with single nucleotide variants af-
fecting protein phosphorylation sites or kinase domains. Two
sets of modules were computed with 10000 network permuta-
tions and are shown in Supplementary Figures S2—S3. First, the
search for survival correlations in the kinase—substrate network
with log-rank test identiﬁed 19 modules, where associated pa-
tients have signiﬁcantly different survival rates compared with
other patients in the cohort (empirical P g 0.05). Second, the
categorical variable search with Fisher’s exact test revealed
ﬁvemodules with signiﬁcant enrichment of alive patients (empir-
ical P g 0.05). The modules are also summarized in
Supplementary Table S1.

4 DISCUSSION

HyperModules is a biological network-mining algorithm that
reveals modules of interacting genes with clinically informative
disease mutations. Diverse biomolecular interaction networks
can be analyzed, including PPI networks, gene regulatory
networks and curated biological pathways. Disease mutations
are also broadly deﬁned. Although we initially studied cancer

point mutations, other types of alterations such as copy
number and gene expression changes can be used.
HyperModules ﬁnds correlations with groups of genes where
mutations may be infrequent but the signature strengthens
through network integration. Such modules are not often directly
usable as biomarkers because of small sample size; however, we
believe that our approach helps discover genes and pathways as
potential multivariate biomarkers for further experiments.

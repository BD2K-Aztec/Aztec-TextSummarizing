ABSTRACT

Motivation: Individual research groups now analyze thousands of
samples per year at synchrotron macromolecular crystallography
(MX) resources. The efficient management of experimental data
is thus essential if the best possible experiments are to be
performed and the best possible data used in downstream processes
in structure determination pipelines. Information System for
Protein crystallography Beamlines (ISPyB), a Laboratory Information
Management System (LIMS) with an underlying data model allowing
for the integration of analyses down-stream of the data collection
experiment was developed to facilitate such data management.
Results: ISPyB is now a multisite, generic LIMS for synchrotron-
based MX experiments. Its initial functionality has been enhanced
to include improved sample tracking and reporting of experimental
protocols, the direct ranking of the diffraction characteristics of
individual samples and the archiving of raw data and results
from ancillary experiments and post-experiment data processing
protocols. This latter feature paves the way for ISPyB to play a
central role in future macromolecular structure solution pipelines
and validates the application of the approach used in ISPyB to
other experimental techniques, such as biological solution Small
Angle X-ray Scattering and spectroscopy, which have similar sample
tracking and data handling requirements.

1 INTRODUCTION

The advances made in bioinformatics, protein production,
puriﬁcation and crystallization techniques when the era of structural
genomics was at its height led to a greatly increased demand
for the collection of X—ray diffraction data at synchrotron—based
macromolecular crystallography (MX) beamlines. This, coupled

with the advent of user—friendly synchrotron beamline control
interfaces (Gabadinho et al., 2010; McPhillips et al., 2002; Skinner
at al., 2006), the increased use of robotic sample changers (Cipriani
et al., 2006; Cohen et al., 2002; Cork et al., 2006; Hiraki et al.,
2008; Jacquamet et al., 2009; Snell et al., 2004) and the ability to
automatically screen and rank the diffraction properties of crystals
using software such as DNA (Leslie et al., 2002) and WEB—ICE
(Gonzalez et al., 2008) ushered in the age of high—throughput
crystallography (HTX).

The most evident effect of HTX is that in the period 2000—
2009, there was a 3—fold increase in the annual rate of deposition of
macromolecular crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB;
http://www.pdb.org) (Berman et al., 2000). The overwhelming
majority (~85%) of these depositions are based on diffraction data
collected at synchrotron facilities (see http://biosync.sbkb.org/ for
details). However, the increase in PDB depositions tells us only
half of the story. During the same time period, the number of
individual samples being analyzed per year at the MX facilities
of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) rose by
more than an order of magnitude (currently > 100 000/year at the
ESRF) (Bowler et al., 2010), an increase signiﬁcantly boosted by
the emergence of fragment—based drug design as a tool for drug
discovery in the pharmaceutical industry (see Murray and Blundell,
2010 for a review). Increased automation has also meant that many
more samples are being tested for diffraction quality before any full
data collections are carried out (Bowler et al., 2010).

Given the huge increase in the numbers of samples analyzed
and the increased importance of the pre—screening of the samples,
the need for a Laboratory Information Management System
(LIMS) combining sample tracking and experiment reporting during
synchrotron—based MX experiments was clear. In 2001, a prototype
LIMS, PXWeb, was developed and deployed at the ESRF (Arzt
et al., 2005). The scope of PXWeb was rather limited and
functionality was conﬁned mainly to basic experiment recording
and reporting. In particular, no exchange of information between
PXWeb and other LIMS [i.e. for protein production (Pajon et al.,
2005), crystallization (Amin et al., 2006; Fulton et al., 2004), X—ray

ISPyB: an information management system for synchrotron macromolecular crystallography

 

crystallography (Harris and Jones, 2002)] or ‘electronic lab books’
(Prilusky et al., 2005) was possible.

Subsequent to the initial deployment of PXWeb at the ESRF, an
e—science resource for MX, e—HTPX, was initiated (Allan at al.,
2005). The aims of e—HTPX were to provide a uniﬁed set of tools
for structural biologists to plan, direct and document experiments in
a site—independent manner and to afford seamless ﬂow and storage
of information, from target selection to structure deposition in the
PDB, for each sample under study. As initial use of PXWeb at the
ESRF illustrated the need to increase the scope of the database and
highlighted restrictions imposed by the Zope (http://www.zope.org/)
technology used to underpin its web interface, a joint ESRF/e—HTPX
initiative was launched to reassess both the Use Cases deployed
and the technology upon which PXWeb was based. This resulted
in the development of an upgraded LIMS, Information System for
Protein crystallography Beamlines (ISPyB), (Beteva et al., 2006).
Compared with PXWeb, the initial version of ISPyB provided more
sophisticated sample tracking and experiment recording features
and facilitated the transmission of information from/to other LIMS.
In particular, enhanced communication with the ESRF beamline
control Graphical User Interface (GUI) MxCuBE (Gabadinho et al.,
2010) and an improved harvesting and display of results (including
data collection strategies) made experiment planning and execution
easier.

The development of ISPyB is currently a collaboration between
ESRF and Diamond Light Source (DLS). This collaboration has
produced a multisite, generic LIMS for synchrotron—based MX
experiments. Additional features beyond those reported by Beteva
et al. (2006) include:

(i) extended reporting of experimental/beamline parameters,
(ii) tracking of samples to/from the home
laboratory/synchrotron.
(iii) snapshots showing the disposition of a sample in the X—ray
beam.
(iv) logging and display of results from the analysis of absorption
edge scans and X—Ray ﬂuorescence emission (XFE) spectra.
(v) storage and ranking of the diffraction characteristics of
individual samples and (vi) archiving, display and download
of the results of the automatic processing of full diffraction
data sets collected (of Winter, 2010).

Taken together, this functionality allows the tracking of the
progress of a diffraction experiment in real—time and paves the way
for ISPyB to play a central role in future macromolecular structure
solution pipelines.

Access to ISPyB, its basic functionality and its role in
the semi—automated data—collection pipeline developed under
the auspices of the Structural Proteomics in Europe (SPINE;
http://www.spineurope.org) project have been reported elsewhere
(Beteva et al., 2006). Here, we take the opportunity to illustrate the
current status and functionality of ISPyB, to elucidate its underlying
data model and data ﬂow and to describe its means of communication
with other LIMS and applications external to the database.

2 METHODS

ISPyB is written in Java J2EE and uses the Jboss Application Server
(http://jboss.org/jbossas) and Struts Model—View—Controller (MVC) Web
Application Framework (http://struts.apache.org/). The End—User interface of

ISPyB is a pure web—based application that is accessible using any browser.
At the ESRF, the ISPyB database is MySQL (http://www.mysq1.com/),
whereas, at DLS, the database is Oracle (http://www.oracle.com/).
Communication with other databases is performed via web services (see
below).

The ISPyB data model (Fig. 1) was designed to be modular so that data
management and storage pertaining to new functionality can easily be added
as and when it becomes available. As experimental work at synchrotron
facilities is carried out in pre—deﬁned time slots on pre—deﬁned beamlines,
the ISPyB data model is based on the concept of an individual experimental
session (an ‘Experiment’ at ESRF, a ‘Visit’ at DLS). Data concerning
the scheduling of experimental sessions are retrieved from the appropriate
synchrotron User Ofﬁce management databases which are external to ISPyB
(Fig. 2).

Once an ‘experiment’ (or ‘visit’) has been scheduled, one, or more,
‘shipments’ can be associated with the session. A shipment consists
of one or more ‘dewars’ each comprising one or more ‘containers’ in

which the individual ‘samples’ to be studied in the experimental session
are held. ‘Containers’ are most commonly cryocanes or sample changer
baskets. Individual sample identiﬁers are constructed using a combination
of user—deﬁned sample names and protein acronyms. At the ESRF, protein
acronyms are contained in its User Ofﬁce Database (Scientiﬁc Management
Information System; SMIS) and are linked to information (protein name,
organism, safety class, etc.) provided during the beamtime application
process.

During an ‘experiment/visit’ ISPyB records, and makes available
immediately, all relevant experimental parameters for all data collections
and stores these along with the results of automatic sample evaluation or
post—operation data analysis. ‘Data collections’, each given an individual
identiﬁer (DataCollectionId) are referred to an individual sample. Several
types of data collection are possible: initial diffraction quality screening,
full diffraction data collections, absorption edge scanning and the collection
of XFE spectra. Depending on the data collection operation carried out, a
variety of different information and data are stored in the database.

The data ﬂow and application environment of ISPyB are shown in
Figure 2. The recording of experimental and beamline parameters and the
archiving of the results produced by software external to the database is
performed via the ISPyB Database Gateway Server (dbserver). Developed
to provide a simple, uniform and standard interface to ISPyB for trusted
client applications, this gateway is a lightweight Python HTTP server
communicating in Extensible Markup Language (XML) with its clients
and in Structured Query Language (SQL) with the ISPyB database.
Client applications include the Beamline Control Module (BCM) and any
downstream data processing software executed on the command of the BCM.
Typically, the client application will send a request consisting of a command
and associated XML, and the Database Gateway Server will return an XML
response.

Communication between ISPyB and external LIMS or other databases is
achieved using web services based on the Simple Object Access Protocol
(SOAP; http://www.w3.0rg/TR/2007/REC—soapl2—partl—20070427). Using
this technology, web services are simply an extension to an existing
application and do not require any particular conﬁguration or ﬁrewall
exception.

Web services facilitating information exchange between ISPyB and
external systems are implemented using a ‘message model’—based set
of XML Schema Deﬁnitions (XSDs), developed within e—HTPX (Allan
et al., 2005), that deﬁne what data can be exchanged. The same software
architecture forms the basis for an Application Programming Interface (API)
which allows the submission of information (i.e. sample and shipment
information for a particular experiment) through upload of a standard
spreadsheet.

The increased demand for the screening or collection of complete
diffraction data sets from crystals in their crystallization drops (Emamzadah
et al., 2009; Jacquamet et al., 2004), has driven the tighter integration of
ISPyB and external crystallization LIMS. Speciﬁc exchange mechanisms
have been developed for the EMBL Grenoble Crystallization Information
Management System (CRIMS, https://embl.fr/htxlab/) and the Protein
Information Management System (PiMS) (Morris et al., 2011) compliant
xtalPiMS application (Daniel at al., 2011). Since PiMS and xtalPiMS
reference the same data model and can even reference the same database,
these two applications can, in tandem with ISPyB, allow users to track data
pertaining to a particular sample from initial cloning experiments through
protein production and crystallization to diffraction data collection and
beyond.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Sample management

Sample management in ISPyB involves the tracking of samples
to/from and within the synchrotron and the recording of their

progress, including data logging, through the data collection
experiment.

Once a shipment has been created in ISPyB, transport
labels including unique barcodes are generated automatically
for all the individual components (currently, these are typically
transport dewars) of the shipment. These labels contain details
of the experimental session to which the shipment is assigned
speciﬁcally—date, beamline and experiment Local Contact (LC).
The component can also be linked, by the user, with a courier
company tracking number which is then also displayed in ISPyB.
When the labeled component arrives at the synchrotron, the
label barcode is scanned, the status of the component in ISPyB
automatically updated and an e—mail conﬁrming its reception sent
to both the dispatcher and to the LC for the experiment. When the
component is delivered to the beamline on which the experiment
is to take place, the barcode is again scanned and the status of the
component updated in ISPyB. After the experiment, the barcode
of the return label is scanned and linked to a courier company
tracking number, an e—mail containing a hyperlink to this sent to
the user and the status of the component updated in ISPyB. External
users are therefore informed of the arrival/departure of shipments,
of their exact whereabouts while they are at the synchrotron and
are able to track their progress between the home laboratory and
the synchrotron. Given the ‘experiment/shipment/container/sample’
hierarchy of the ISPyB data model (Fig. 1) this feature of the
database also allows the tracking of an individual sample’s location
at any given time. Dewar barcodes are read using Hand Held Dolphin
7600 barcode scanners (Honeywell Scanning and Mobility, USA)
that run a modiﬁed instance of the ISPyB web interface and transmit
information to the ISPyB database via wireless networks.

As described previously (Beteva et al., 2006), various information
can be associated with the individual samples in a shipment. Such
information can include:

(i) sample container barcode (see Section 2 for a deﬁnition of
‘containers’ ).

(ii) individual sample holder barcode.

(iii) position in the sample container.

(iv) unit—cell dimensions and space group.

(v) rudimentary experiment plan—this usually consists of the
minimum data resolution, as predicted from preliminary
screening, required for a full data collection to be carried out.

(vi) experiment type (single wavelength/multiwavelength,
direct/inverse beam, etc.).

(vii) additional comments deemed useful for the sample.

Uploading of sample information can be carried out by directly
typing it into the ISPyB interface; by uploading information
contained in an Excel spreadsheet or ﬁles in comma—separated values
(CSV) format; by transferring it, via web services, from an external
data base (see above); (at DLS only) by direct input into the GUI of
the BCM.

At the start of an experimental session, either the ‘prepare
experiment’ tab of the ISPyB interface or (at the ESRF only) the in
situ scanning (Cipriani et al., 2006) of the barcodes of each SPINE
sample holder is used to deﬁne the position of individual samples in
the sample changer. When the ‘prepare experiment’ tab is used, only
the position of a container in the sample changer is determined at the
beamline. The positions of individual samples in the container are

read from ISPyB. Sample name and sample changer positions are
then passed to the sample area in the GUI of the BCM along with any
relevant information (space group, unit—cell dimensions, minimum
resolution, etc.). If desired, the sample names can then be used to
provide the preﬁxes in the naming conventions for subsequent data
collection operations.

The sample tracking protocol described above cannot currently
be used for non—frozen crystals brought to the synchrotron in
crystallization plates. However, as for frozen crystals shipped to
the synchrotron in a transport dewar, information pertaining to each
individual sample can be entered into ISPyB via its ‘Sample’ tab.
ISPyB then associates all experimental details and results with a
given sample in the usual way. In the case that no sample information
is entered into ISPyB prior to a data collection operation, the ‘image
preﬁx’ given in the GUI of the BCM is used for the association of
experimental details and results.

3.2 Experiment recording and planning

3.2.] Experiment recording. Once a user has logged in to a BCM
connected to ISPyB, details of all data collection operations carried
out during the current experimental session are collected, archived
and made available in real—time via the ISPyB ‘Data Collection’ tab
(Fig. 3).

For each diffraction data collection carried out, a top level
summary displays diffraction image names, basic experimental
information and a summary of the results (unit—cell dimensions,
space group, completeness, resolution and quality) of automatic data
processing. For absorption edge scans, both the raw data for the
scan itself and the results of the Kramers—Kronig transformation as
implemented in CHOOCH (Evans and Pettifer, 2001) are accessible
(Fig. 3). For XFE spectra (Leonard et al., 2009), both the spectrum
itself (Fig. 3) and a full analysis of this are retrievable, the latter as
a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) page.

Lower level information is accessible by clicking on the relevant
‘image preﬁx’ in the ‘Data Collection’ tab. This information includes
optional crystal snapshots (Fig. 4), information tables giving fuller
details of experimental and beamline parameters and the results and
log ﬁles of any crystal characterizations carried out (see below).
When automatic data processing protocols are successful, log ﬁles
and ﬁles containing the resulting scaled and merged intensity data
can also be perused or downloaded (Fig. 3).

At both the ESRF and DLS, diffraction images are stored on
a central ﬁle system from which they are deleted periodically.
In order to restrict the space requirements of ISPyB, only Joint
Photographic Experts Group (JPEG; http://www.jpeg.org) format
thumbnails of diffraction images, and not the images themselves, are
stored indeﬁnitely. Diffraction images can thus only be downloaded
via ISPyB while they remain in central storage.

3.2.2 Experiment planning. As well as providing the extended
reporting of experiments carried out at synchrotron—based MX
facilities, the information stored in ISPyB also allows for real—time
(i.e. at the beamline) experiment planning.

Different crystals of the ‘same’ biological macromolecule often
show large variations in the quality of the diffraction data that can
be obtained from them (see Bowler et al., 2010 for a brief discussion
as to the reasons for this). In order to choose the best crystal from
which to collect diffraction data and thus, to increase the likelihood

that an experiment will produce a deﬁnitive result, preliminary
investigations of crystal quality are increasingly carried out in
MX. Such experiments at the ESRF and DLS currently use EDNA
(Incardona et al., 2009). Experimental details of characterizations
and the results of these (including proposed data collection
strategies) are stored in ISPyB (Fig. 4). For each individual EDNA
characterization, ISPyB provides snapshots showing the disposition
of the sample in the X—ray beam, details of the autoindexing
and integration of the test diffraction images, a series of test
image quality indicators and the results of data collection strategy
calculations carried out using BEST (Bourenkov and Popov, 2010).
When preliminary characterization is carried out successfully, the
resulting data collection plan is also provided to the BCM and can
be acted upon at the experimenter’s discretion.

The storage of the results of preliminary diffraction tests means
that, in contrast to the semi—automated data collection pipeline
described by Beteva and colleagues (2006), ISPyB can now be used
to directly rank the diffraction quality of a set of samples. Ranking
can be carried out for all samples (regardless of sample name root)
within a single session or, via a database search, across experimental
sessions for samples with the same protein acronym. Initial ranking
is carried out via the ‘Data Collection’ tab (see ‘Sample Ranking’
checkboxes, Fig. 3 middle panel) and results presented either as
a table or as a radar comparison chart (Fig. 5). If desired, further
ranking can then be carried out interactively using different weights
for different ranking criteria. After ranking, the data collection
strategies for selected samples can be exported to an XML format
ﬁle that can be subsequently read and used by the BCM to drive full
data collections for the samples chosen.

3.3 Searching and reporting

For each data collection session, reports can be produced in formats
(i.e. CSV) that allow users to update any home laboratory LIMS
they might use or as a PDF or word document.

Basic database searching functionality is available through the
‘Data Collection’ and ‘Sample’ tabs of the ISPyB interface. Searches
can be carried out, in particular, using the protein acronym as
a parameter and will return all information stored for individual
samples whose names contain this acronym, including whether
or not data collections have been performed. The results of all
searches can be exported as CSV ﬁles, a PDF ﬁle or a word
document. Generic dashboards allow the display of statistics relating
to beamline use. Currently, this functionality is rather limited
and, when necessary, speciﬁc bespoke searching of ISPyB by
database administrators can be carried out using SQL requests.
At DLS tools supplied with the Oracle system are exploited to
generate web page reports of both beamtime usage and of data
quality statistics derived from automatic data processing. These
can be copied into spreadsheet packages for detailed analysis and
presentation.

4 DISCUSSION

ISPyB was designed to optimize information transfer between
home laboratories and synchrotron—based MX beamlines before,
during and after experimental sessions. The particular strength
of ISPyB relates to sample management and the recording of
information during an experiment. However, when properly used,
the functionality of ISPyB should also allow for more successful

preﬁx’ directs the user to a full reporting of the experimental protocols used, the results of sample evaluations by EDNA (Fig. 4) and the results of automatic
data processing (bottom right). Mouse—over tool—tips are integrated into the HTML interface. In the examples above the tool—tip in the ‘Data Collection’ tab
shows a summary of the data collection parameters for a selected experiment while that for the data processing results gives information concerning both the

format and data content of downloadable ﬁles containing the reduced data.

and efﬁcient experimental sessions. The possibility to rank the
diffraction characteristics of samples means that, in principle, full
data collections should only be carried out on the samples best
suited to the experiment in hand. Moreover, the accessibility of
results and output ﬁles from the automatic, on—line data processing
protocols means that experimenters can also monitor the success
of data collection experiments in real-time (i.e. while still at the
beamline) and decide whether or not more data need to be collected
for a speciﬁc project.

ISPyB is a useful tool for those who operate synchrotron-
based MX facilities. It allows the generation of statistics on
what type of experiments are being carried out and, thus,
the elucidation of new trends that may drive improvements
in beamline functionality. A speciﬁc example of this is the
trend that many more samples are tested for diffraction quality
before any full data collections are carried out. This observation
has lead to the design of new beamlines and workﬂows for
MX that will be implemented as part of the ESRF Upgrade

S.Delageni re et al.

 

Although the growing needs of experimenters has resulted in
ISPyB becoming an integral part of MX experiments on the ESRF
and DLS Structural Biology beamlines, it is clear that the database
will need to evolve further if it is to meet the ever more challenging
requirements of Structural Biologists and synchrotron beamlines
dedicated to the MX technique. It is likely that many future projects
in Structural Biology will involve the screening of the diffraction
properties of several thousand rather than several hundred samples in
order to ﬁnd those most suitable for data collection. Such projects are
also likely to involve the combination of partial data sets collected
either from different crystals or from different parts of the same
crystal. Moreover, sample pre—screening will increasingly take place
at different beamlines—if not different synchrotron facilities—prior
to subsequent full data collections. Future developments to ISPyB
will certainly require workﬂows modiﬁed to take into account
previously collected data and, thus, a revised data model based on
projects rather than experimental sessions.

ISPyB has evolved from a database conﬁned to simple sample
tracking, experiment recording and reporting to a sophisticated
and interactive system for experiment planning, management and
execution. MX facilities at European synchrotron sources other than
the ESRF and DLS have expressed an interest in making use of
the database. This would enable ISPyB as a pan—European LIMS
at the hub of synchrotron—based macromolecular structure solution
pipelines.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: In cancer genomes, chromosomal regions harboring
cancer genes are often subjected to genomic aberrations like copy
number alteration and loss of heterozygosity. Given this, finding
recurrent genomic aberrations is considered an apt approach for
screening cancer genes. Although several permutation-based tests
have been proposed for this purpose, none of them are designed
to find recurrent aberrations from the genomic dataset without
paired normal sample controls. Their application to unpaired genomic
data may lead to false discoveries, because they retrieve pseudo-
aberrations that exist in normal genomes as polymorphisms.
Results: We develop a new parametric method named parametric
aberration recurrence test (PART) to test for the recurrence
of genomic aberrations. The introduction of Poisson-binomial
statistics allow us to compute small P-values more efficiently and
precisely than the previously proposed permutation-based approach.
Moreover, we extended PART to cover unpaired data (PART-up) so
that there is a statistical basis for analyzing unpaired genomic data.
PART-up uses information from unpaired normal sample controls
to remove pseudo-aberrations in unpaired genomic data. Using
PART-up, we successfully predict recurrent genomic aberrations
in cancer cell line samples whose paired normal sample controls
are unavailable. This article thus proposes a powerful statistical
framework for the identification of driver aberrations, which would
be applicable to ever-increasing amounts of cancer genomic data
seen in the era of next generation sequencing.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cancer genomes often exhibit chromosomal aberrations like copy
number alteration and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). A chromosomal
aberration potentially leads to the functional alteration of cancer
genes and could be a driver for oncogenesis. For example, if the copy
number of some locus is ampliﬁed, residing oncogenes would be
functionally activated. Conversely the presence of tumor suppressor
genes are associated with chromosomal deletion and LOH. However,
most aberrations are so—called passengers, which accompany driver
aberrations by chance and do not have any causal relationship with
oncogenesis. Therefore, it is important problem to discriminate
the driver aberrations from the passenger ones. Given that driver
aberrations recurrently occur around driver cancer genes whereas

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

passenger aberrations randomly exist across chromosomes, ﬁnding
recurrent chromosomal aberrations is deemed a powerful approach
for discovering driver aberrations and associated driver genes.

In the past decade, microarray technology has enabled genome—
wide proﬁling of copy number and homozygosity (Michels et al.,
2007). The application of microarrays to cancer genomes has
revealed prevalent aberrations in cancer cells, and produced a
large amount of genomic data, which are rich resources for the
identiﬁcation of potential driver loci (Beroukhim et al., 2010).
By examining the presence of aberrations across all chromosomal
positions in multiple samples, we have a binary aberration proﬁle
matrix whose rows and columns correspond to chromosomal
positions and samples, respectively. We wish to ﬁnd chromosomal
positions where a signiﬁcantly large fraction of samples are
subjected to aberration. There are a number of computational
methods to statistically screen for recurrent genomic aberrations,
most of which are based on permutation tests (Morganella et al.,
2011). For example, GISTIC calculates the value of statistic scoring
recurrence for each genomic position while the null distribution of
the statistic is obtained using null aberration proﬁle matrices, which
are generated by permuting positions of the binary aberration proﬁle
matrix for each sample. Finally, GISTIC reports the signiﬁcance of
recurrence at each position and predicts driver loci by detecting the
peaks of the signiﬁcance plot. (Beroukhim et al., 2007). Although
the permutation approach is successful in ﬁnding driver aberrations,
it is computationally intensive, especially when we need to calculate
small P—values precisely.

Usually, aberration proﬁling of a cancer genome is performed
by comparing a tumor sample with the paired normal sample. For
example, LOH is called for a position whose genotype changes from
a heterozygous state in a normal genome to a homozygous state in
the paired—tumor genome. When the paired normal sample is not
available, aberration proﬁling is also possible: LOH could be called
for a chromosomal segment that has successive homozygous state
in the tumor genome (Beroukhim et al., 2006). However, it has
been reported that we would confront false positive calls in such
unpaired experimental designs: an obtained LOH might be only a
polymorphic homozygous segment that exists in the paired normal
genome (Heinrichs et al., 2010).

To ﬁnd recurrent aberrations, we developed a novel parametric
test, parametric aberration recurrence test (PART). Using Poisson—
binomial statistics (Wang, 1993), PART can be used for efﬁcient
and precise calculation of small P—values, as compared with
the permutation approach. Moreover, we extend PART to cover
unpaired data (PART—up) to ﬁnd recurrent aberrations in unpaired
experimental designs. PART—up computes the signiﬁcance of
aberration recurrence by taking into consideration the false positive
rate, which is calculated from the unpaired normal sample data. By
applying PART—up to simulated and real data, we demonstrate that

our approach can identify recurrent genomic aberrations even in
unpaired datasets.

2 METHODS
2.1 PART

First, we introduce a simple parametric test to ﬁnd the recurrence of genomic
aberrations (e.g. LOH) given an aberration proﬁle matrix. Let R denote an
n x m input binary matrix, whose rows and columns index chromosomal n
positions and m samples. If the sample j has a genomic aberration at the
position i, we set Rl‘j = 1; otherwise, Rl‘j =0. The problem to be addressed is
to statistically test whether a genomic aberration recurrently appears at each
position. Namely, we need to calculate a P—value for a test statistic, which
is deﬁned as the count of aberrant samples in each position. For the position

i, it is given by
m
Si 2 ZRij.
i=1

To calculate the P—value, we assume a null model where the aberration at
each position appears with an equal probability within each sample, Pr(R,-j =
1)=pj, and the probability can be estimated by the aberration ratio of the

samplej:
1 n
Pi = ; 2R5-
i=1

Note that this null model is equivalent to the one generated by position
permutation in each sample, which is the approach taken by GISTIC
(Beroukhim et al., 2007). Under the null model, if the aberration rate is
constant across samples, that is p1 =p2 =  2pm, testing for aberration in
each sample can be done by using independent Bernoulli trials with the
equal success probability; in such a case, the test statistic 51-, which is the
sum of the independent Bernoulli trials, follows the binomial distribution.
However, in real data, the aberration varies across samples: some tumors have
more genomic aberrations during oncogenesis than others. Therefore, for
unequal pjs, testing for aberration at a position in each sample must consider
independent Bernoulli trials with unequal success probabilities. In this case,
the test statistic 5,- follows a general case of the binomial distribution, the
Poisson—binomial distribution (Wang, 1993) with the probabilistic function

PB(k=sl-;p1,p2,...,pm)= Z Hpj H (1 —pj),

GeijeG jeGC

where Fk is the set of all subsets of k integers that can be selected
from 1,2,...,m. For example, for m=3 and k=2, we have F2={{1,2},
{1,3}, {2,3}}. GC is the complement of G, that is GC={1,2,3,...,n}\G. Fk
will contain m!/(m—k)!k! elements, over which summation is infeasible
in practice unless m is small. However, efﬁcient calculations using a
discrete Fourier transformation or recursive formulae have been proposed
(Hong, 2011). Using the Poisson—binomial distribution, the P—value p(s,-) is
calculated by

Si
pm):l—ZPB(k;131,132,...,13m).
k=1
To calculate the cumulative distribution function, we use the DFT—CF
(the Discrete Fourier Transform of the Characteristic Function) method
implemented in the R poibin package (Hong, 2011).

2.2 PART-up

In unpaired experimental designs, the aberration proﬁle matrix of tumor
samples, R, may contain false aberration calls. Here, we address the problem
of how to test for the recurrence of genomic aberration in the presence of
false positive aberration calls. When the aberration proﬁle matrix of unpaired
normal samples from the same cohort is available, the Poisson—binomial
approach enables us to test for the recurrence of aberration by denoising the
false positive aberration calls.

Let S and T denote n X! and n x m binary matrices, and be referred to
as the false aberration proﬁle matrix and the true aberration proﬁle matrix,
respectively. S was prepared for l unpaired normal samples with the same
procedure as that used for R, and T is unobserved data that we can obtain by
removing false positive calls from R. We deﬁne the probability of aberration
at the position i of the sample j as plszr(R,-j=1), and use {pl-1,1912, ...,p,-m}
as the Poisson—binomial parameters. Note that we must compute the Poisson—
binomial parameters for each position by considering the existence of the
false positive aberration calls from normal samples.

Under the assumption that the false positive rate of aberration calls at
each position is constant across samples, the false positive rate piF can be
estimated from S: 131E223:ng / l . We also deﬁne the probability that the
aberration observed at the position i of the sample j is true: p; = Pr(T,-j = 1).
As an observed aberration must be either a true aberration or a false positive
aberration call, the following equation holds among these probabilities:

sz=P;+(1—P;)'P1‘F- (1)

Under the null model, the probability of true aberrations should be constant
within each sample, that is, 195219;. By noting this, we can take the average
of Equation ( 1) over positions:

szpjr+(1—P;)'PF7 (2)

where 191-: % 2272119,]- and 191:: %Z?=1piF. As 131-, 13F and 13? are available
from the data, we can calculate 13; from Equation (2):

 

A AF
AT AT pj_p
p: .2 A , (3)
l] J 1_pF

By substituting Equation (3) for Equation (1), we obtain:

13_._13j'(1—IA7,-F)—IA9F+IA7,-F
l — A
J 

Now, we have {13,1,13,-2,...,13,-m}, which are Poisson—binomial parameter
estimates adjusted for each position. Using these parameter estimates, the
P—value p(Sj) is calculated as described in the previous section.

2.3 Preparation of simulation data

Simulation data for benchmark tests were generated partially based on
a study by Guttman et al. (2007). Assuming unpaired experiments, we
simulate nxm and nxl binary matrices, R and S. In our simulation, we
assumed three types of aberrations: concordant true, non—concordant true
and concordant false positive aberrations. All types of aberrations exist in
R; therefore, we independently generated nxm binary matrices, RC, RH
and Rf. To obtain R, we combined them using Rl-j = max {R3, R3, R3}. These
matrices are illustrated in Figure 1. Only concordant false positive aberrations
exist in S.

0 Concordant true aberrations. RC contains concordant true aberrations
of width wC at row intervals speciﬁed by an integer set C, which
contains the row indices of aberration centers. For each interval,
aberrations recurrently appear in columns randomly sampled with
rate W. Note that this type of aberrations should be a target of PART
and the positions in the speciﬁed concordant intervals are used as
actual positives in benchmark tests.

0 Non—concordant true aberrations. Each column of RI1 has kl?“ non—
concordant true aberrations of length w“. For each aberration, we
sampled the interval length w/n ~ Geometric (1 /w“), and the interval
position randomly. The number of aberrations kl?“ was sampled for
each column so that kl?“ ~Poiss0n(kn).

° Concordant false positive aberrations. Intervals of concordant false
positive aberrations have width wf and are speciﬁed by the concordant
row interval set of size kf. The kf elements were randomly sampled
from 1 to n. For each of the concordant intervals, Rf and S have
aberrations in columns randomly sampled with rate rf.

In our simulation, we ﬁx the parameters as n: 1000, m: 100, 1:300,
WC 2 WI1 2 wf = 5 and C = {200, 400, 600, 800}. For the other parameters, kn,
kf, W and rf, several combinations of parameter values were examined, as
described later.

2.4 Preparation of real data

We obtain paired and unpaired LOH proﬁle matrices for 294 pairs of
colorectal cancer and normal samples. As a data source, TCGA (The Cancer
Genome Atlas) Level 3 SNP data proﬁled by Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 were
downloaded from the TCGA data portal site (http://tcga—data.nci.nih.g0v/
tcga/tcgaHome2.j sp). To obtain a paired LOH proﬁle matrix, we performed
LOH detection for each pair of the samples—based allelic imbalance (Staaf
et al., 2008). For SNPs whose genotypes are called heterozygous in the
normal genome, the ratio of allelic copy intensities was calculated as the
B allele frequency (BAF) score: B=b/(a+b), where a and b are the copy
number intensity for A and B alleles in the cancer genome. The BAF score
should be 0.5 if the position has no allelic imbalance. We then computed the
absolute deviation of the BAF score from 0.5 as the BAF’: B/ = |B—0.5|.
BAF/ was plotted along chromosomes and segmented using the circular
binary segmentation algorithm with parameter or 20.01 (Venkatraman and
Olshen, 2007). We assumed that chromosomal segments with B/ >0.1 are
subjected to LOH. To obtain the unpaired LOH proﬁle matrices, we applied
the basic Hidden Markov Model method proposed by Beroukhim et al.
(2006) to the cancer genome data. His method uses a hidden Markov model to
detect successive LOH while taking into account SNP intermarker distances.
LOH in unpaired samples was also detected by the same procedure.

We also prepared the unpaired aberration proﬁle matrices for the Sanger
cell line data. We obtained Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 data containing 764
cell lines and 466 unpaired normal samples from the Cancer Genome Project
site (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Archive/) (Bignell et al., 2010).
The unpaired LOH proﬁle matrices were obtained in the same way as the
TCGA data. The copy number ampliﬁcation and deletion proﬁle matrices
were obtained by binarizing the copy number proﬁles predicted by PICNIC
(Greenman et al., 2010).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulation data test

First, we numerically show that our Poisson—binomial approach
is statistically equivalent to the permutation approach adopted by
other methods. We prepared an LOH proﬁle matrix from the Sanger
cell line data, and compare PART P—values with those based on

RC Rn

10000 permutations of chromosomal positions for each sample.
The minus log scale P—value plot in Figure 2 shows that they
correspond with each other, although the permutation approach
has a limitation for the calculation of small P—values. We also
permutated chromosomal positions for each sample, apply PART to
the permutated data and plot a histogram of P—values. Supplementary
Materials Figure 81 shows that the histogram is close to uniform
distributions, demonstrating that our method successfully controls
the rate of false positives.

Next, we numerically compare the performance of PART
and PART—up. We simulated aberration proﬁle matrices; in each
simulation, we obtain a pair of true and false positive aberration
matrices. To generate matrices, we assumed three types of
aberrations: concordant true non—concordant true and concordant
false positive aberrations. In the true aberration matrix, concordant
true aberrations appear recurrently at speciﬁc positions whereas non—
concordant true aberrations appear randomly. Namely, concordant
true aberrations mimic drivers targeted by PART whereas non—
concordant true aberrations mimic passengers. As concordant false
positive aberrations mimic polymorphisms which exist in both
cancer and normal genomes, they appear recurrently at the same
position and frequency in both the true and false positive aberration
matrices. The simulation data were generated from a simulator
with four free parameters: kn for the number of non—concordant
true aberrations, kf for the number of concordant false positive
aberrations, rC for the rate of samples subjected to concordant true
aberration, and rf for the rate of samples subjected to concordant
false positive aberrations. A simulation instance is illustrated in
Figure 1.

We prepared 16 types of simulators with different parameter
settings and obtained 100 matrix pairs from 100 Monte Carlo trials
for each simulator. For each Monte Carlo matrix pair, we applied
PART to the true aberration matrices and PART—up to both the
matrices. The result for a Monte Carlo matrix pair is presented
in Figure 3. From the results pooled across the 100 Monte Carlo
trials, we calculated precision and recall for each method over the
whole range of signiﬁcance cutoffs to depict precision—recall (PR)
curves. Precision is deﬁned as the proportion of actual in predicted
positives, whereas recall is deﬁned as the proportion of predicted in
actual positives. We assumed positions within concordant intervals

overlapping the three matrices. Although the false positive aberration matrix S is not shown here, its simulation is similar to that of Rf

Fig. 3. An example of signiﬁcance plots for simulation data. PART and
PART—up were applied to the simulated data presented in Figure 1. The P—
values from PART (A) and PART—up (B) were plotted in minus 10g scales
across chromosomal positions

as actual positives and positions determined by a signiﬁcance cutoff
as predicted positives. The PR curve shows the discriminative ability
of each method to ﬁnd positions associated with true concordant
aberrations. For this type of benchmark tests, the receiver operating
characteristic curve is also popular; however, we chose the PR
curve because it is preferred for our case where the number of
actual positives is relatively small (Davis and Goadrich, 2006).
The heatmap in Figure 4 shows the PR curves for the 16 different
parameter settings. PART—up performs better in the presence of
more concordant false positive aberrations (i.e. when the parameters
controlling the frequency of concordant false positive aberrations,
kf and rf, are larger), while the performance of both methods are
attenuated by the presence of non—concordant true aberrations (i.e.
when the parameter controlling the frequency of non—concordant

up can successfully discriminate concordant true aberrations from
concordant false positive aberrations, suggesting its applicability to
genomic data obtained in unpaired experimental designs.

3.2 Real data test

In this section, we compare PART and PART—up using real
experimental data. First, we focus on TCGA colorectal cancer SNP
data that were obtained in a paired experimental design. To examine
the performance of PART—up, we prepared two types of LOH proﬁle
matrices in two different ways: paired and unpaired LOH proﬁle
matrices. The former was authentically obtained based on paired
genomes: LOHs were called by comparing genotypes between tumor
and paired normal genomes. The latter was approximately obtained
based only on tumor genomes: LOHs were calls for segments
that harbor successive homozygous calls in tumor genomes. An
unpaired LOH proﬁle matrix for normal samples was also prepared
for PART—up input.

We applied PART to the paired and unpaired matrices, and plot
minus log P—value across chromosomes. The paired LOH proﬁle
matrix produces a clear signiﬁcance plot, whereas the unpaired
LOH proﬁle matrix yields a noisy plot with many spikes, as shown
in Figure 5A and B. The spikes would reﬂect false positive LOH
calls for polymorphic homozygous segments that exist in normal
genomes. We also applied PART—up to the same unpaired LOH
proﬁle matrix from tumor samples combined with that from normal
samples. Figure 5C shows that PART—up successfully removes most
of the spikes and the result corresponds well to that from PART
applied to the paired matrix. This observation demonstrates that, if
the aberration proﬁles for unpaired normal samples are available,
PART—up performs as well for unpaired data as PART does for
paired data.

data. Minus log scaled P—values for the recurrence of LOH were plotted

was applied to the paired LOH proﬁle matrix. (B) PART was applied to the
unpaired LOH proﬁle matrix from the tumor samples. (C) PART—up was
applied to the unpaired LOH proﬁle matrices from the tumor and normal
samples

Next, we obtained unpaired LOH proﬁle matrices from a cancer
cell line dataset published by the Sanger institute (Bignell et al.,
2010). As paired normal controls are usually unavailable for cell
lines, it has been difﬁcult to ﬁnd recurrent aberrations in cell line
data. However, as the Sanger dataset is accompanied by hundreds
of unpaired normal sample data items, it can be subject to PART-
up. We apply PART and PART-up to the unpaired LOH proﬁle
matrices and the signiﬁcance plots are shown in Figure 6A and B.
As in the TCGA case, although PART produces a noisy plot,
PART-up produces a much clearer plot, revealing recurrent LOH
region in the cancer cell lines. We also applied PART and PART—
up to the unpaired copy number ampliﬁcation and deletion proﬁle
matrices, and these results are shown in Supplementary Materials
Figures S2 and S3. The comparison between the signiﬁcance plots
demonstrates that PART-up removes some spikes, which would
be from copy number polymorphisms in normal genomes. The
differences are less dramatic than in the LOH case, reﬂecting the low
rate of pseudoaberrations from normal genomes for copy number
aberrations as compared with LOH (see Supplementary Materials
Table S 1). As such, we conclude that PART-up successfully identiﬁes
recurrently aberrant regions from unpaired genomic data.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we presented a novel statistical method, PART,
to test the recurrence of genomic aberration. Although a

and unpaired normal samples

number of methods have been developed for similar purposes,
most of them take permutation approaches to assess statistical
signiﬁcance. Conversely, our method takes a novel parametric
approach by employing Poisson-binomial statistics. There are
pros and cons between the two approaches. Our parametric
approach needs less computational time and can calculate small
P-values more accurately than the permutation approach. This
property is important for genomic analysis, because we usually
need to calculate small P-values to correct large-scale multiple
hypothesis testing. Conversely although our approach must take
the count of aberrant samples as a test statistic, the permutation
approach is ﬂexible for the type of statistic and can enable
more biologically plausible tests. For example, the GISTIC
statistic takes into consideration aberration strength in addition
to recurrence (Beroukhim et al., 2007). However, in spite of
these differences, we found that PART and GISTIC produce
consistent results on the copy number data (See Supplementary
Note).

The most notable advantage of our parametric approach is
highlighted by the extension of PART to PART-up. Although it
is preferable that genomic aberration proﬁlings are performed in
paired experimental designs, it is not always possible to obtain paired
normal samples. However, PART-up is applicable only if data are
accompanied with unpaired normal samples from the same cohort,
which are generally easier to obtain. Although previously proposed
methods are not able to deal with such unpaired data, the introduction
of Poisson-binomial statistics enables us to test recurrent aberrations
in unpaired data while considering the rate of pseudo-aberrations
that originate from normal genomes. Although a method has been
proposed to call aberrations in individual tumor samples using the
pooled unpaired normal sample as a reference (Y amamoto et al.,
2007), testing for the recurrence of aberrations in a group of unpaired
tumor samples is a novel approach. It is expected that combining
these complementary approaches will reduce false positives and lead
to higher performance.

In this study, we applied our method to genomic aberration
proﬁles obtained by the microarray technology. The next— generation
sequence technology has result in a torrent of cancer genome
data (Meyerson et al., 2010). The current dataset is not only
large but also complex, in that the new technology can proﬁle
various types of genomic aberrations that cannot be captured by
the old technology: point mutations, short indels, translocations,
and so forth. A population—scale sequencing project targeting
thousands of normal genomes is also ongoing (1000 Genomes
Project Consortium, 2010); data produced by the project would be
used as unpaired normal sample controls for PART—up. Based on this
study, future studies would address the application of our Poisson—
binomial approach to a wider spectrum of genomic aberrations
revealed by the next—generation sequence technology.

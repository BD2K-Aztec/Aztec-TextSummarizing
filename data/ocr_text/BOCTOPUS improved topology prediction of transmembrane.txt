ABSTRACT

Motivation: Transmembrane 8 barrel proteins (T MBs) are found in
the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, chloroplast and
mitochondria. They play a major role in the translocation machinery,
pore formation, membrane anchoring and ion exchange. TMBs
are also promising targets for antimicrobial drugs and vaccines.
Given the difficulty in membrane protein structure determination,
computational methods to identify TMBs and predict the topology
of TMBs are important.

Results: Here, we present BOCTOPUS; an improved method for the
topology prediction of TMBs by employing a combination of support
vector machines (SVMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The
SVMs and HMMs account for local and global residue preferences,
respectively. Based on a 10-fold cross-validation test, BOCTOPUS
performs better than all existing methods, reaching a Q3 accuracy of
87%. Further, BOCTOPUS predicted the correct number of strands
for 83% proteins in the dataset. BOCTOPUS might also help in
reliable identification of TMBs by using it as an additional filter to
methods specialized in this task.

Availability: BOCTOPUS is freely available as a web server
at: http://boctopus.cbr.su.se/. The datasets used for training and
evaluations are also available from this site.

1 INTRODUCTION

Two types of transmembrane proteins are known to exist,
a—helical membrane proteins and transmembrane ,8 barrel proteins
(TMBs). The former class has been the major focus of computational
methods, as they are known to constitute 20—30% of a typical
proteome (Wallin and von Heijne, 1998). However, TMBs are
worthy of attention as they play an important role in the translocation
machinery of both inner and outer membrane proteins in bacteria,
chloroplast and mitochondria. Moreover, TMBs are involved in
transport of molecules, voltage gating, membrane anchoring, pore
formation and are also candidate molecular targets for development
of antimicrobial drugs and vaccines (Galdiero et al., 2007; Koebnik
et al., 2000; Paj 611 et al., 2006; Schulz, 2002). However, the number

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

of solved TMB structures in PDB is limited, since they are difﬁcult
to crystalize; consequently, better computational methods for the
topology prediction of TMBs are needed. Such a predicted topology
can function as a template for experimental investigations and can
further aid in elucidating the structure and function of putative
TMBs.

TMBs typically consist of a central pore region made up of
anti—parallel ,8 strands and residues in the ,8 strands follow a
strict dyad repeat pattern (Seshadri et al., 1998). The general
construction principles of TMBs (Schulz, 2002) have been employed
for the topology prediction and genome—wide identiﬁcation of
TMBs. However, the low number of known TMB structures and
a less prominent hydrophobicity proﬁle pose problems in the
development of computational methods for the identiﬁcation and
topology prediction of TMBs.

The computational methods in the realm of TMBs can be divided
into two parts (i) methods that aim to identify TMBs from genomic
data and (ii) methods that predict the TMB topology assuming that
the given sequence is a putative TMB. The ﬁrst group consists of
a variety of methods including methods that combine statistical
propensities and C—terminal pattern identiﬁcation (Berven et al.,
2004), empirical scores (Freeman and Wimley, 2010; Mirus and
Schleiff, 2005; Wimley, 2002), K —nearest neighbor methods (Hu and
Yan, 2008), SVMs (Park et al., 2005), Neural Networks (Gromiha
and Suwa, 2006; Gromiha et al., 2004), Hidden Markov Models
(HMM) (Deng et al., 2004; Martelli et al., 2002), amino acid
composition (Garrow et al., 2005; Gromiha et al., 2005a) and
secondary structure element alignments (Yan et al., 2011). The
HHomp method for the identiﬁcation of TMBs employs HMM—
proﬁle comparison and is based on the observation that almost all
,8—barrel OMP have a common ancestry (Remmert et al., 2009).

Methods aiming at the prediction of topologies include HMM—
based methods such as PRED—TMBB (Bagos et al., 2004), TMB—
HMM (Singh et al., 2011) and PROthb (Bigelow and Rest, 2006),
SVM—based methods such as TMBETAPRED—RBF (Du et al.,
2010), neural network—based methods such as TMBpro (Randall
et al., 2008) and methods based on statistical potentials such as
transFold (Waldispuhl et al., 2006). PROthb (Bigelow and Rest,
2006), TMBETA—NET (Gromiha et al., 2005b) and PRED—TMBB
(B agos et al., 2004) also predict the topology of the identiﬁed TMBs.
A comparison and evaluation carried out indicated that HMM—based
methods outperform methods based on other types of machine
learning (Bagos et al., 2005).

Here, we present an improved topology predictor for TMBs
named BOCTOPUS. BOCTOPUS is based on the ideas used in two

BOCTOPUS

 

recently developed methods for the topology prediction of oz—helical
membrane proteins; MEMSAT—3 (Jones, 2007) and OCTOPUS
(Viklund and Elofsson, 2008). BOCTOPUS uses a combination of
SVMs to predict the local structural preferences for a residue, and
a HMM model to create a topology model for a protein. Based on
a 10—fold cross—validation test, BOCTOPUS predicted the correct
number of transmembrane ,8 strands in 30 out of 36 TMBs in
the dataset and achieved an overall Q3 accuracy of 87%. The
primary use of BOCTOPUS is topology prediction of TMBs with the
assumption that all input sequences are TMBs. However, we show
that BOCTOPUS can reduce the number of false positives when it
is used along with specialized methods for TMB identiﬁcation such
as BOMP (Berven et al., 2004) or PSORTb (Yu et al., 2010).

2 METHODS
2.1 Training dataset

A non—redundant dataset was obtained from the OPM database (Lomize
et al., 2006). The dataset was homology reduced at 530% sequence identity
resulting in 36 TMB structures. Development and training of the SVMs
and HMMs used in BOCTOPUS was performed based on 10—fold cross—
validation. To further avoid inﬂuence by distantly related homologs, the
training was performed in such a way that all proteins belonging to the same
OPM family were put together in the same cross—validation set.

All residues in the dataset were annotated as either ‘I’ (inner—loop), ‘O’
(outer—loop) or ‘M’ (transmembrane 8 strand) based on the coordinate of
the Cat atoms and membrane boundaries obtained from the OPM database
(Lomize et al., 2006). Here, residues located within the membrane boundaries
but do not belong to a transmembrane 8—strand are labeled as ‘l’ or ‘0’ based
on the location of the initial residue. The annotated dataset is available from
the web server.

2.2 Training BOCTOPUS

The architecture of BOCTOPUS consists of two layers (Fig. 1). The ﬁrst
layer consists of three SVMs that predict the local preferences for a residue
to be in a particular location. The second layer consists of an HMM model
that predicts the topology. The dataset was divided into 10 sets such that
proteins belonging to the same super—family were in the same set. During
the training, nine sets were used to test the performance on the 10th set. In
contrast to what has been done in most earlier studies, this cross—validation
was maintained throughout the entire pipeline.

2.2.] Input features The input feature for BOCTOPUS is a position—
speciﬁc scoring matrices (PSSMs) obtained using PSI—BLAST version
2.2.18 (Altschul et al., 1997). Here, default parameters and three iterations of
searching the non—redundant nr—database, obtained from the NCBI website
in July 2010, was used. The log—odds value in the PSSM was transformed
into a PSSM proﬁle by dividing all number by 10 such that they lie between
:l:1.0.

2.2.2 SVMs training Three SVMs, as implemented in the libsvm interface
in the R e1071 package were trained to determine the preference of each
residue to be in the ‘I’, ‘O’ or  regions. Radial basis and linear kernels,
different windows sizes in the range of 1— 31 were tried (Supplementary
Material). The optimal window size was determined based on the highest
Matthews correlation coefﬁcient (MCC) (Matthews, 1975).

2.2.3 Optimization of the HMMs ‘lOM—proﬁle’ generated from the
probabilities produced by the three SVMs was used as the input for training
different combinations of HMM parameters. HMMs used in BOCTOPUS

Fig. 1. BOCTOPUS pipeline. Psi—blast is used to generate PSSM for a
given sequence. A) Three separate SVMs are used to predict the residue—
level preference for each amino acid to be I, M and 0, respectively. An
‘IOM—proﬁle’ is generated from the probabilities obtained from the SVMs.

are implemented in the modhmm package (Viklund and Elofsson, 2004) and
the HMM architecture is shown in Figure 1. The HMM describing the global
topology consists of a pre—barrel stage (P) describing the region before the
ﬁrst transmembrane 8—strand is detected. Further, a TMB is deﬁned by four
different states each representing the inner—loop, outer loop and the up and the
down strands (Fig. 1). The up and down strand states can handle 8—strands in
the range of 6—15 residues. To be consistent with structural properties known
from the available 3D structures, all protein topologies start in the ‘P’ or ‘i’
state and end in the ‘M’ (down strand) or ‘i’ state. The emission scores for
the states are the probabilities obtained from the respective SVMs. Based on
the emission scores, the most likely topology is predicted using the Viterbi
algorithm.

The transition probabilities between states are set to 1.0 to make the ﬁnal
predicted topology dependent only on the SVM output values and the HMM
architecture, but not on the distribution of topologies in the training dataset.
Thereby fewer parameters need to be optimized. The emission scores for
the ‘I’, ‘O’ and ‘M’ states are directly set to the probability scores obtained
from the respective SVMs. However, to accommodate for the variable length
of large outer—loops, small inner—loops and pre—barrel (deﬁned as the region
before the ﬁrst transmembrane beta—strand) part of the sequence, we found
that it was necessary to optimize the three states with self—loops. These three
states are shown in bold letters I, P and O with a self—loop (Fig. 1). The
four parameters tested per—state are the weights for ‘l’ and ‘0’ emissions
in determining the emission score and the transition probability to go to
the next state or self—loop. Each parameter was tested for values in the
range 0—1 with a step size of 0.1. Initially, the four parameters for each
state (i.e. I, P, 0) were optimized separately, keeping the parameters of the
other two states ﬁxed at 0.5 using the same cross—validation scheme as when
optimizing the SVMs. The best performing HMM parameters were chosen
based on the correct number of predicted strands on the training set. The
best HMM parameterspobtained for I and 0 states were then combined
and IO—optimized HMMs were obtained. IO—optimized HMMs were then

combined in all possible combinations with parameters obtained for the
P state.

2.3 Global topology prediction based on
cross-validated models

As mentioned above, for each round, training was performed on nine sets, and
the remaining set was used for testing. First ‘IOM—proﬁles’ were generated
for proteins in the test—set using SVMs trained only on the training sets.
However, as thousands of parameters provided identical (and perfect) results
on the training set, the topologies of the proteins in the test—set were then
determined by using a subset of these top performing HMMs (for details
see Supplementary Material). For the ﬁnal evaluation, 10000 HMMs were
randomly selected from a pool of the top performing HMMs to predict the
topology of the proteins in the test sets.

2.4 Evaluation

For per—residue accuracy performance Q2, Q3 and segment overlap (SOV)
(Rost et al., 1994) were used. Q2 is deﬁned as the two—state (membrane/not—
membrane) prediction accuracy. Q3 is deﬁned as the three—state prediction
accuracy for i, M, 0 states. In addition, the number and location of the
predicted strands was used to evaluate the performance per—protein. A protein
was deﬁned to have a correct predicted topology when the number of
predicted strands is correct and each predicted strand overlaps with at least
two residues with the observed strand. It should be noted that all results for
BOCTOPUS are based on the 10—fold cross—validation and are reported as
an average of a randomly selected set of 10 000 among the top performing
HMM parameters.

2.5 TMB identiﬁcation

The ability to identify TMBs was tested on a non—redundant (at sequence
identity 550%) representative dataset of 14 232 PDB entries obtained from
Freeman and Wimley (2010). Here, a protein was assigned as a TMB when
the number of strands predicted by BOCTOPUS is larger than a given number
(typically 8). Methods such as BOMP (Berven et 01., 2004), PSORTb (Yu
et al., 2010) and tmbetaNet (Gromiha et al., 2005b) have also been tested in
combination with BOCTOPUS for the identiﬁcation of putative TMBs.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Residue-level prediction accuracy

BOCTOPUS is a two stage computational method for the topology
prediction of TMBs. In the ﬁrst stage, three different SVMs are
trained to distinguish between ,8—strand/not ,8—strand, inner—loop/not
inner—loop, outer—loop/not outer—loop regions. Different window
sizes ranging from 1 to 31 were tested (Fig. 2).

The optimal window size was determined based on the MCC
values such that no statistically signiﬁcant improvement was gained
on further increasing the window size. Based on this criteria,
window size of 31, 19 and 21 was chosen for i, o and M SVMs,
respectively. P—values for determining the statistical signiﬁcance of
change in MCC values with increasing window size are given in the
supplementary information. This window size was maintained in all
cross—validation sets; however, the SVMs were trained separately in
each training set.

For each residue, the probabilities obtained from the individual
SVMs are used to generate an ‘IOM—proﬁle’, which are fed into the
HMM stage to produce the ﬁnal prediction.

When calculating the accuracy measures using the SVMs alone,
each residue is assigned to the region with the highest probability

(Section 3.1). The resulting probabilities for each state preference are
combined into an ‘IOM—proﬁle’ and then used by an HMM to predict the
global topology.

in the ‘IOM—proﬁle’. The Q2, Q3 and SOV scores for BOCTOPUS—
SVM are 90, 85 and 75%, respectively (Table 1). The Q2 and Q3
scores compete favorably with earlier methods, which have Q2
scores ~85% and Q3 scores up to 82%. However, the SOV score
is much lower than these methods, as most of the strands predicted
are too short.

3.2 Topology prediction using BOCTOPUS

In BOCTOPUS, the SVM predictions are used as input into a
HMM—like model to obtain the ﬁnal prediction. This step increases
the per—residue accuracy in particular as measured by Q3 and
particularly SOV (Table 1). It should be noted that, as many
parameters performed equally well in the optimization of the
HMMs, the predictions of the 10 test—sets shown here are the
average performance of a randomly selected set of 10000 among
the top performing HMM parameters. The SOV score (92%) of
BOCTOPUS is higher than any of the earlier methods. BOCTOPUS

Comparison of topology predictions. N o. strands is deﬁned as the number of sequences
where the number of predicted strands is equal to the number of observed strands.
Topology is deﬁned as if number of strands is correct and the predicted strands overlap
by at least two residues. Underpredicted (UP) is deﬁned as sequences where the number
of strands underpredicted, i.e. some strands are missed. Overpredicted (OP) is deﬁned
as sequences where the number of strands is overpredicted. BOCTOPUS-SVM shows
the accuracy measures without the HMM stage. Fraction of strands (FS) is deﬁned
as the number of observed strands that are correctly predicted to be at the correction
location. The total number of strands in the dataset is 540. BOCTOPUS results are
reported as an average of a randomly selected set of 10 000 among the top performing
HMM parameters and are based on the lO-fold cross-validation test. Detailed lO-fold
cross-validation test results per protein are given in Table 3.

predicts the correct number of strands on average for 30.1 out of
36 proteins (Table 2). Further, BOCTOPUS predicted on average
25.4 of these proteins with correct topology. Here, a topology
is deﬁned as correct when the number of predicted strands is
equal to the number of observed strands and all predicted strands
overlap the observed strand. Figure 3 shows the topology and
correct number of strands distribution for BOCTOPUS run on a
randomly selected set of 10000 among the top performing HMM
parameters. As shown, almost 65% of the 10 000 HMMs tested can

(Fig. 3).

In Figure 4, the most frequent incorrect predictions are shown.
The top six are proteins for which the number of strands was
predicted correctly but at least one predicted strand does not
overlap with its observed location. In 9 of 12 cases, the errors can
be attributed to overpredictions in the pre—barrel state (Table 3);

shorter than observed, resulting in one predicted strand to be shifted.
BOCTOPUS underpredicts the number of strands in two proteins
(2vqi_A and 1e54_E). These two proteins are also missed by
PROthb and TMBETAPRED—RBF that show the second highest
accuracy on our dataset (Table 2). For 2vqi_A, BOCTOPUS misses
two strands at the C—termini, in 3prn_C, Strands 10 and 11 are always
missed and for 1e54_E only 12 of 16 observed strands are predicted
correctly.

3.3 Multi-chain TMB topology prediction

Multi—chain TMBs are TMBs whose barrel composes of ,8—strands
from different chains. Such multi—chain TMBs were not discussed
in Section 3.2 because the grammar of multi—chain TMBs differs
from that of single—chain TMBs (Bigelow and Rost, 2006; Remmert
et al., 2010). For example, TOLC protein from Escherichia coli
(ltqq_A), Drug—Discharge Outer Membrane Protein, OprM from
Pseudomonas aeraginosa (1wp1_A), Multidrug Resistance (VceC)
protein from Vibrio cholerae (1yc9_A) have very long inner—loops.
A comparison of different prediction methods on multi—chain TMBs
shows that none of the methods, including BOCTOPUS, can predict

Topology prediction of proteins in the test dataset. BOCTOPUS was run on a randomly
selected set of 10 000 among the top performing HMM parameters. Columns 2 and 3
show the fraction correct topology and correct number of predicted strands. For each
protein, Columns 4—6 show the location of the most common errors. Strands that are
underpredicted (UP) or overpredicted (OP) are shown in Columns 4 and 5, while in
Column 6 the strand ids for predicted predicted strands that do not overlap (OV) with
the observed location is shown. Column 7 shows the frequency of the most common
error among the all mispredictions.

the correct topology for more than one or two of these proteins
(Table 4). Given the role played by these atypical TMBs as toxins
(Iacovache et al., 2006), further investigation of them in the future
will be important.

3.4 The BOCTOPUS web server

The BOCTOPUS web server uses amino acid sequence as input and
generates TMB topologies as output. Figure 5 shows an example
output from the BOCTOPUS topology prediction pipeline. The
lines show the per—residue probabilities for i, M and 0 regions,
respectively. The horizontal bars represent the predicted global
topology.

Prediction accuracy on multi-chain TMBs. Out of six multi-chain TMBs, BOCTOPUS
gets the number of 8 strands correct only for Haemophilus inﬂuenzae Hia autotransporter
(3emo_A). However, methods in the literature including BOCTOPUS are not optimized
to handle multi-chain TMBs.

3.5 TMB identiﬁcation based on BOCTOPUS
predictions

Although BOCTOPUS is best suited for topology prediction and
it initially assumes all input sequences to be putative TMBs, we
tested its ability to discriminate between TMBs and non—TMBs
in a dataset from Freeman and Wimley (2010). Here, a protein is
assigned as TMB if the number of predicted strands is larger than a
given number N. Figure 6 shows the TMB identiﬁcation results for
different methods combined with BOCTOPUS. The results for the
negative set are presented as an average of 10 separate BOCTOPUS
runs. For the proteins that are known to be TMBs (positive set),
the topology prediction results are taken from the cross—validation
test as descried above. Further, the results for PSORTb and other
methods mentioned here are obtained from the respective web
servers and the inherent homology was not eliminated in prediction.
In Table 5, BOCTOPUS(8) and BOCTOPUS(4) refer to cases where
the threshold for being a TMB is set at 8 and 4, respectively.
BOCTOPUS (8) alone misclassiﬁes 1374 non—TMBs as TMBs,
resulting in an MCC value of 0.14. Secondary structure analysis

TMB identiﬁcation based on the predicted topology by BOCTOPUS and state of
the art methods [performed on dataset obtained from Freeman and Wimley (2010)].
BOCTOPUS (4/ 8) is the case when sequences are predicted as TMB and the number of
predicted strands is 2 4 or 8, respectively. Five (out of 48) TMBs in the dataset (Freeman
and Wimley, 2010) are toxins and not classiﬁed to be transmembrane proteins by OPM
(Lomize et al., 2006) and PDBTM (Tusnady et al., 2005) and therefore were excluded
from the analysis. Six multi-chain TMBs are included in TMB identiﬁcation analysis.
Highest MCC is obtained by PSORTb + BOCTOPUS(8), where six of the eight FNs
are multi-chain TMBs.

of non—TMB proteins predicted as TMB shows that the regions
predicted as TM ,8—strands are enriched in ,8—strands. Based on DS SP
assignment for secondary structure, regions predicted as ‘M’ have
38.6% residues in ,8—sheets versus 10.3% for ‘I’ and ‘0’ residues.
The methods specialized in identiﬁcation of TMBs (for example:
BOMP, tmbetaNet and PSORTb) are better at identifying TMBs
than BOCTOPUS (Table 5). The number of false positives for these
methods vary between 53 for PSORTb to 2311 for tmbetaNET.
However, when these methods are used together with BOCTOPUS,
such that a protein is ﬁrst predicted by a TMB identiﬁcation method
and then checked by BOCTOPUS if the number of strands is Z 4 or
8, the number of false positives is reduced without a large decrease
in sensitivity. The highest accuracy is obtained when combining
PSORTb with BOCTOPUS(8). The number of false positives is

reduced from 53 to 16 with eight losses in TPs. Accordingly,
the MCC value increases from 0.61 to 0.75 (Table 5). Six of the
eight misclassiﬁed TMBs are multi—chain TMBs. This is due to the
fact that multi—chain TMBs generally consists of 2—4 ,8—strands per
chain. The other two TMBs misclassiﬁed as non—TMBs are Toluene
transporter Tqu (3bry_A) and Lipid A deacylase PagL (2erv_A).

4 CONCLUSION

Here, we present an improved topology predictor for TMBs named
BOCTOPUS that combines local per—residue predictions with global
preferences. BOCTOPUS is based on ideas previously implemented
for the topology prediction of HMPs where different residue
preference scores derived from sequence proﬁles are combined to
predict the global topology (Jones, 2007; Viklund and Elofsson,
2008). BOCTOPUS is benchmarked on a non—redundant dataset
with 36 TMBs with known 3D structure. Based on a 10—fold cross—
validation test, the prediction accuracy of BOCTOPUS is higher
than earlier methods both when measured on a per—residue and
a per—protein basis. BOCTOPUS predicts the correct number of
strands in 30 of 36 (83%) TMBs and obtains the correct topology
for 70% TMBs in the dataset. We also show that when BOCTOPUS
is combined with dedicated TMB identiﬁcation methods such as
BOMP (Berven et al., 2004), PSORTb (Yu et al., 2010) and
tmbetaNet (Gromiha et al., 2005b), it can reduce the false positive
detection of TMBs. However, the performance in multi—chain
TMBs is far from perfect indicating that the correct prediction and
identiﬁcation of such proteins is not a solved problem.

Abstract

Summary: The biomedical literature is a knowledge—rich resource and an important foundation for
future research. With over 24 million articles in PubMed and an increasing growth rate, research in
automated text processing is becoming increasingly important. We report here our recently de—
veloped web—based text mining services for biomedical concept recognition and normalization.
Unlike most text—mining software tools, our web services integrate several state—of—the—art entity
tagging systems (DNorm, GNormPlus, SR4GN, thhem and thar) and offer a batch—processing
mode able to process arbitrary text input (e.g. scholarly publications, patents and medical records)
in multiple formats (e.g. BioC). We support multiple standards to make our service interoperable
and allow simpler integration with other text—processing pipelines. To maximize scalability, we
have preprocessed all PubMed articles, and use a computer cluster for processing large requests
of arbitrary text.

Availability and implementation: Our text—mining web service is freely available at http://www.

1 Introduction

Managing the rapid growth of biomedical knowledge buried in text
such as literature, medical records and patents makes the develop—
ment of automated text—mining technology increasingly important.
For instance, the biomedical literature contains the latest reports of
scientific discoveries, but is represented in a highly unstructured for—
mat. Many text—mining systems have thus been developed in recent
years to help unlock this information, both for information retrieval
and for novel computational analyses. Text—mining approaches to
automatically recognize and extract key biological concepts are of
particular interest as this task is often considered to be a building
block for many integrated and sophisticated information extraction
and retrieval solutions.

Over the years, a number of biomedical named entity recognition
(NER) tools have been developed. The entities targeted include
genes/proteins (Hakenberg et 61]., 2011; Tsai et 61]., 2006; Wei et 61].,
2015; Wermter et 61]., 2009), chemical/drug (Leaman et 61]., 2014;
Rocktaschel et 61]., 2012), disease (Leaman et 61]., 2013), sequence
variation (Caporaso et 61]., 2007; Doughty et 61]., 2011; Wei et 61].,

2013b) and species/taxonomy(Gerner et 61]., 2010; Wei et 61]., 2012).
To use these tools, and in particular integrate them into existing
pipelines, one has to install the software and address many issues
including ‘lack of modularity, operating system incompatibility, tool
configuration complexity, and lack of standardization of inter—
process communications’ (Wiegers et 61]., 2014). Web—based text
mining services provide an alternative solution where the details of
the tool are hidden from users and no system installation or main-
tenance is required. Although one can access text—mining applica—
tions like Reﬂect (Pafilis et 61]., 2009) and MyMiner (Salgado et 61].,
2012) through web page visits, we are only aware of a few that offer
programmatic web APIs and can therefore be integrated easily:
Whatizit (Rebholz—Schuhmann et 61]., 2008), BeCAS (Nunes et 61].,
2013), Cocoa (http://npjoint.c0m/) and Acromine (Okazaki et 61].,
2010). In comparison to these tools, our web services are unique in
several aspects: (i) the entity taggers used offer highly competitive
performance in benchmarks for both mention and concept level re—
sults, typically via hybrid systems, as opposed to use dictionaries in
the previous systems; (ii) for system scalability, our method allows

users to submit multiple documents in a single request (instead of
one per request) and we process these batch requests using a com—
puter cluster when needed. Moreover, articles in PubMed—the most
common target document type—are preprocessed and handled spe—
cially so that their tagged results can be instantly retrieved and (iii)
for system interoperability, we support multiple formats including
BioC, a recently proposed XML format for BioNLP research
(Comeau et al., 2014) that complements several other existing plat-
forms such as UIMA (Kano et al., 2009).

2 Materials and Methods

Figure 1 describes the overall architecture of our web services, which
use standard HTTP method calls (often known as RESTful services)
and allow two access modes: (i) a batch—oriented processing function
for any raw text input (abstract, full text, patent, etc), submitted via
HTTP POST and (ii) instant retrieval of pre—tagged results of
PubMed abstracts via HTTP GET. For the batch—processing func-
tion, users may submit one or multiple documents per batch, and
large requests will be sent to a computer cluster for parallel
processing.

When retrieving pre—tagged results of PubMed abstracts, the re—
quest only requires the PMIDs of the requested abstracts. This 0p—
tion is provided because annotating biomedical literature is the most
common use case for such a text—mining service. From a technical
standpoint, the preprocessing is made possible by our previous sys—
tem PubTator (Wei et al., 2013a), which stores text—mined annota—
tions for every article in PubMed and keeps in sync with PubMed
via nightly updates. We show in Table 1 the five entity types we cur—
rently support, along with their associated tagger and respective
benchmarking performance (thhem for chemicals, SR4GN for
species, DNorm for diseases, thar for mutation/variations,
GNormPlus for gene/proteins). Figure 1 shows one example for each
access mode. For instance, the disease tagger (DNorm) is being re-
quested to process a text via the RESTful API using our JSON for-
mat. Once the request is submitted, our web service responds

immediately with a unique session ID, which can be used to check
the processing status. Once finished, the user can use the same ses—
sion ID to retrieve the result, as shown in Figure 1. The text-mining
output can be directly visualized using PubTator as shown in
Figure 2 where computer—tagged entities are highlighted in various
colors throughout the document.

To improve system interoperability, we support multiple formats
including BioC/XML (Comeau et al., 2014), PubTator/TXT (Wei
et al., 2013a) and PubAnnotation/JSON (Kim and Wang, 2012). By
doing so, our service becomes interoperable for different applica-
tions. To simplify programmatic access to our web services, we also
provide sample client code in Perl, Python and Java.

3 Usage

Since the inception of our web services on March 31, 2015, millions
of requests have been made, primarily through the HTTP GET ac-
cess mode. From interactions with some of our users, we learned
that the results of our text—mining services are being used in many
different research areas from biocuration, to crowdsourcing, to
translational bioinformatics. For instance, our web services are used
to provide initial annotations for the mark2cure crowdsourcing pro—
ject (https://mark2cure.org/) and our gene tagger results are used in
assisting the daily curation of HuGE navigator (Yu et al., 2008) a
knowledge base for human genome epidemiology.

4 Discussion and Conclusion

We previously developed a number of high performance NER tools
and made them open source for public use. In this work, we provide
a new way to access these tools in an interoperable and scalable
manner, making it simpler to integrate them into complex custom—
ized systems. Our format can be converted to new formats like
Open Annotation (Pyysalo et al., 2015) via existing converter. Since
providing instant access to the tagged results of PubMed abstracts is

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein interaction networks contain a wealth of
biological information, but their large size often hinders cross-
organism comparisons. We present OrthoNets, a Cytoscape plugin
that displays protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks from two
organisms simultaneously, highlighting orthology relationships and
aggregating several types of biomedical annotations. OrthoNets
also allows PPI networks derived from experiments to be overlaid
on networks extracted from public databases, supporting the
identification and verification of new interactors. Any newly identified
PPls can be validated by checking whether their orthologs interact
in another organism.

Availability: OrthoNets is freely available at http://wodaklab.org/
orthonets/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent technological advances have contributed to a rapid growth
in the amount of data on gene and protein interactions as well as on
protein and gene function (Costanzo et al., 2010; Gavin et al., 2006;
Krogan et al., 2006; Stelzl et al., 2005). Although organisms such
as yeast are comparatively well characterized, others—including
human—have data for only a small fraction of their predicted
genomes or proteomes. In this case, orthology relationships can be
used to transfer information on function and interactions from one
organism to another, thus assisting the prediction and validation of
new interactors (Yu et al., 2004).

The OrthoNets plug—in for Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003)
enables simultaneous Visual analysis of protein—protein interaction
(PPI) networks in multiple organisms. By default, the plug—
in provides direct access to updated networks from ﬁve model
organisms—yeast, mouse, human, ﬂy and worm—consolidated
from 10 major PPI databases (Razick et al., 2008) and available
from the iRefWeb resource (Turner et al., 2010) resource
(http://wodaklab.org/iRefWeb). Interactions are annotated with
supporting information, such as interaction type, experimental
detection methods and supporting publications. Interacting proteins
in OrthoNets are further annotated with domain architectures

disease information from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(OMIM) database (McKusick et al., 2006).

2 SIMULTANEOUS ANALYSIS OF INTERACTION
NETWORKS IN TWO ORGANISMS

Once the user speciﬁes genes or proteins of interest, OrthoNets
displays their full interaction neighborhoods as well as the
interaction neighborhoods of their orthologs (Fig. 1a). The organism
Views are synchronized, so that selecting a particular node in one
network will automatically select the corresponding orthologs in the
other network. Orthologs can also be identiﬁed by matching node
colors (Fig. lb). Orthology relationships are pre—computed using the
InParanoid method (O’Brien et al., 2005).

By default, proteins involved in chromatin modiﬁcation
(Kouzarides, 2007) are highlighted with a white border, which
reﬂects the focus of our research team, but the user may
accentuate any preferred group of proteins in this way. Pfam
domain architectures as well as various protein and interaction
annotations may be Visualized (Fig. lb—d). Of particular interest
are disease annotations from the OMIM database (McKusick
et al., 2006), which can be mapped onto the Visible network
as customized node shapes. Additional graphing tools are also
provided to help determine the most common diseases in the
neighborhood of a protein. This last feature may be used to infer
a disease association for the corresponding gene. OrthoNets also
enables two PPI networks to be overlaid (Fig. la, left panel), with
edge and node colors indicating PPIs that differ between or are
shared by the two networks. This allows the user, for example, to
compare newly detected interactions with those already in iRefWeb,
to easily identify new PPIs. Furthermore, the plug—in highlights
novel PPIs whose orthologs interact in the other selected organism
(conserved PPIs). Conserved PPIs may be prioritized for follow—up
experimental validation.

3 IMPLEMENTATION AND CUSTOMIZABILITY

OrthoNets data are stored in standard Cytoscape node or edge
attribute ﬁles, and tab—delimited text ﬁles. Files deposited into
the appropriate directory are automatically loaded by the plugin,
enabling the user to add their own set of gene, protein or interaction
annotations. In particular, the user may upload custom PPI networks

Fig. 1. (A) The network views (left: human, right: yeast): the user centers the human interaction network on the LEOl component of the Pafl complex,
associated with RNA Polymerase II (left panel). OrthoNets simultaneously centers the yeast network (right panel) on the yeast LEOl ortholog. Afﬁnity
puriﬁcation data (Mak et al., 2010) is overlaid on the human network: green edges denote those present in iRefWeb, purple edges indicate those found by
experiment, but not in iRefWeb and cyan are those found in both. Although the Wdr61 (hSki8) interactions are not found in iRefWeb, Wdr61 has been reported
as a subunit of the Pafl complex (Zhu et al., 2005). (B) Homology legend indicating the color coding of nodes displayed in (A). (C) Displays information

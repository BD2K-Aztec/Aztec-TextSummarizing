ABSTRACT

Summary: A wealth of large-scale genome sequencing projects
opens the doors to new approaches to study the relationship between
genotype and phenotype. One such opportunity is the possibility to
apply genotype networks analysis to population genetics data.
Genotype networks are a representation of the set of genotypes asso-
ciated with a single phenotype, and they allow one to estimate proper-
ties such as the robustness of the phenotype to mutations, and the
ability of its associated genotypes to evolve new adaptations. So far,
though, genotype networks analysis has rarely been applied to popu-
lation genetics data. To help fill this gap, here we present
VCF2Networks, a tool to determine and study genotype network
structure from single-nucleotide variant data.

Availability and implementation: VCF2Networks is available at
https://bitbucket.org/dalloliogm/vcf2networks.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genotype networks can be used to describe the evolutionary
properties of a set of genotypes associated with a qualitative
phenotype. They are derived from genotype—phenotype maps,
and have been used in a wide range of systems, from genetic
circuits (Espinosa-Soto et al., 2011), to RNA folding (Aguirre
et al., 2011; Fontana and Schuster, 1998), and to metabolic net-
works (Matias Rodrigues and Wagner 2009). In these cases,
genotype networks were used to predict the robustness of a
phenotype to mutations, and the potential of the underlying
genotypes to evolve new and innovative traits.

There have so far been few applications of methods based on
genotype—phenotype maps to empirical data (de Visser and

Krug, 2014), even though the advent of new sequencing technol-
ogies provides large datasets of genotype data associated with
phenotypes. To take advantage of such datasets, we developed
VCF2Networks, a tool to apply genotype networks analysis to
next-generation sequencing data. The tool permits the determin-
ation of genomic regions with high robustness of a given pheno-
type, i.e. mutations in this region affect the phenotype little or
have high potential to create novel phenotypes.

2 APPROACH AND IMPLEMENTATION

A genotype networks is a graph of all the genotypes associated
with a given phenotype. Each node of the graph represents an
individual’s genotype at a ﬁxed number of loci, whereas two
nodes are connected by an edge if their genotype differs at
only one locus. In particular, in VCF2Networks, the relevant
genotypes are single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) at multiple
loci. Figure 1 shows an example of a hypothetical genotype
network of five SNVs. Each node represents the genotypes
of the ﬁve loci, encoded as strings of ones and zeros, where a
zero represents the reference allele, and a one the alternative
allele.

In the previous literature, some properties of a phenotype’s
genotype network have been associated with phenotypic
robustness and the potential of the underlying genotypes to
bring forth new phenotypes Via DNA mutations. For example,
the number of nodes and the average node degree can be
interpreted as a measure of a phenotype’s robustness (Ibaﬁez-
Marcelo and Alarcon, 2014), while the diameters of some
networks can serve as proxy for innovative potentials (Ciliberti
et al., 2007). For a more complete review of genotype networks,
see Wagner, 2011.

VCF2Networks parses genotype files in the variant call
format (VCF) (Danecek et al., 2011), and produces tabular
output containing properties such as the number of nodes, aver-
age degree and diameter for each of the genotype networks gen-
erated. More documentation on the output produced, and a
discussion of best practices, is provided in the Supplementary
Materials S1.

3 USE CASE 1: IDENTIFYING REGIONS UNDER
SELECTION IN HUMAN POPULATIONS

The tutorial of VCF2Networks uses example data from the 1000
Genomes Project. In this case, we do not have real phenotypes,
but we can compare the genotype networks of different human
populations, as exempliﬁed by the command:

$: vcf2networks —ch lOOOgenomesdata.vcf —indiViduals
ind_annotations.txt —phenotype population —network_
size 11

The above command will parse the genotype data from a VCF
ﬁle (—ch lOOOgenomesdata.vcf), and split it into windows of 11
adjacent SNVs (—network_size 11). It will also read the pheno-
type of each individual from the ﬁle ind_annotations.txt, and
compute a genotype network according to the phenotype ‘popu-
lation’ deﬁned in the same ﬁle.

In a previous work (Dall’Olio et al, 2014), we showed that
genomic regions under selection tend to have more vertices,
greater average degree and greater average path length than re-
gions evolving neutrally. This is in agreement with theoretical
models, showing that high robustness facilitates the ability to
innovate and adapt (Ibaﬁez-Marcelo and Alarcon, 2014).
Thus, the above command can be used, in combination with
other methods, to identify regions under selection in the 1000
Genomes or any other data.

In the same work (Dall’Olio et al, 2014), we also derived
some guidelines to calculate genotype networks from human
population genetics data. Most importantly, the chosen size of
the network should take into account the number of samples
available. For example, we showed that for a sample size of
~850 individuals, a size of 11 SNVs is optimal (see
Supplementary Materials S1 for a discussion on choosing the
network size).

4 USE CASE 2: ROBUSTNESS OF CANCER
PHENOTYPES

It has been proposed that cancer phenotypes are characterized by
high genetic robustness and high genetic heterogeneity (Kitano,
2004; Tian et al, 2010). Genetic robustness allows cancers to
survive higher mutation rates, whereas genetic heterogeneity
may help them evolve new traits, such as drug resistance or
new tumorigenic characteristics. VCF2Networks can be used to
analyze multiple DNA datasets coming from the same cancer
patient, and identify regions with potentially high robustness

and evolvability. For example, deﬁning the phenotype as a
binary trait (tumor or normal), and running the following line:

$: vcf2networks —ch myvcf.vcf —indiViduals ind_annota-
tions.txt —phenotype cancer_status —network_size 5

The above command will generate a whole-genome scan of all
cancer samples in the data. As the number of samples is lower
than in 1000 genomes ﬁle, we use a network size of only ﬁve
SNVs. Regions showing high robustness (high average degree)
and high evolvability (high average path length and diameter)
may be important in the evolution of the cancer phenotype.

5 AVAILABILITY

VCF2Networks is available from the Python Package Index, and
can be installed through the python setuptools utilities (easy_
install vcf2networks). The home page of the project is https://
bitbucket.org/dalloliogm/vcf2networks/. VCF2Networks follows
the best practices as proposed in Seemann, 2013.

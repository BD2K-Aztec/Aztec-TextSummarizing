ABSTRACT

Motivation: One of the challenges in interpreting high-throughput
genomic studies such as a genome-wide associations, microarray or
ChlP-seq is their open-ended nature—once a set of experimentally
identified regions is identified as statistically significant, at least
two questions arise: (i) besides P-value, do any of these significant
regions stand out in terms of biological implications? (ii) Does the set
of significant regions, as a whole, have anything in common genome
wide? These issues are difficult to address because of the growing
number of annotated genomic features (e.g. single nucleotide
polymorphisms, transcription factor binding sites, methylation peaks,
etc.), and it is difficult to know a priori which features would be
most fruitful to analyze. Our goal is to provide partial automation of
this process to begin examining associations between experimental
features and annotated genomic regions in a hypothesis-free,
data-driven manner.

Results: We created GenomeRunner—a tool for automating
annotation and enrichment of genomic features of interest (FOI) with
annotated genomic features (GFs), in different organisms. Besides
simple association of FOls with known GFs GenomeRunner tests
whether the enriched FOls, as a group, are statistically associated
with a large and growing set of genomic features.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genomes encode the instructions for life, and within genomes
are many different features with different roles (e. g. genes,
CpG islands, microRNAs). High-throughput (HT) technologies
have enabled us to experimentally examine whether or not
genomic variations associate with certain conditions (e.g. disease).
These variations in features of interest (FOI) such as single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) come from various technologies
like genome-wide association (GWA) studies, peaks called from
ChIP—on—Chip and ChIP—seq experiments and other data from deep
sequencing experiments. Regardless of the type of data, each FOI
has genomic coordinates that uniquely identify it within the genome.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Tools to prioritize FOIs usually analyze local genomic features
(e.g. evolutionary conservation) of individual FOIs and do not
consider the set of experimentally identiﬁed FOIs as a whole.
Functional interpretation of FOI sets is often performed using gene-
and pathway-based tools adopted from microarray data analysis
(Dennis et al., 2003; Ji et al., 2008; Subramanian et al., 2005;
Wang et al., 2007). These tools perform mapping of FOIs to genes,
prioritize lists of FOIs and calculate gene- and pathway-enrichment
statistics. They, however, rely upon a gene’s role being known
and, for humans, approximately one-third of genes have no known
function (Wren, 2009). Plus, as projects like ENCODE are showing,
there are many non-coding regions of interest in the genome (Birney
et al., 2007). As such, we’re lacking a way to automatically explore
the genome and associate our FOIs with genomic features beyond
well-annotated gene regions.

The idea of automating genome exploration is not new
(Wren et al., 2005), but automated exploration of correlations is
complicated by the heterogeneous nature of the HT data versus
annotated genomic features (GF) types. Many efforts have been
devoted to developing tools for prioritizing individual SNPs (Cline
and Karchin 2011; Gauderman et al., 2007), but analysis of what
annotated genomic features other than well-annotated gene regions
may be associated with FOI sets has not received as much attention,
particularly with regards to data-driven exploration. The GREAT
tool, for example, associates genomic regions with their putative
target genes and calculates Gene Ontology enrichment statistics
(McLean et al., 2010), but is gene-centric, whereas GenomeRunner
is designed as a much more general-purpose association tool. Galaxy
has a variety of tools for operating on genomic intervals and SNP
prioritization (Goecks et al., 2010), and GenGen (Chen et al.,
2010; Wang et al., 2007) provides a set of Perl scripts for the
association of FOIs with genes, transcription factor binding sites,
microRNAs, EvoFold regions and other user-provided data but
requires programming skills and data formatting. GenomeRunner
differs from these tools in that it annotates SNPs and regions, and
automatically searches for any statistically signiﬁcant enrichment of
FOIs with multiple GFs.

2 FEATURES AND METHODS
2.1 The interface

GenomeRunner has an intuitive point-and-click interface for
querying of FOIs against a database of GFs. It accepts lists of
FOIs in a tab-delimited format where each region is represented
by chromosome name and a start and end coordinates. A user has
an option to annotate and calculate enrichment of a set of FOIs with
>750 GFs (hg19 database), including genes/exons/introns, upstream

promoter regions, DNAse clusters, empirically validated and
predicted conserved transcription factor binding sites, epigenetics
marks, empirical and predicted microRNAs and regions conserved
across organisms and more.

3 THE DATABASE

Tracks in UCSC genome browser are represented by tables
(Karolchik et al., 2004) available for download. As such they
represent an ideal mechanism for assembling genome annotation
into a single database and for querying associations of FOIs with
a GF of interest. We host selected UCSC tracks (Supplementary
Material) in a MySQL database available to all GenomeRunner
users, but there is also an option for local installation of this database.
GenomeRunner’s database is monthly synchronized with UCSC
data and new GFs are added for GenomeRunner’s analysis as they
become available.

3.1 Monte-Carlo simulations

Besides simple associations of individual FOIs with GFs,
GenomeRunner estimates the likelihood of observing associations
with individual GFs for a set of FOIs versus a set of random regions
with the same characteristics. GenomeRunner runs enrichment tests
against whole genome as a background by default; options for
loading user-deﬁned background are available. Each simulation is
done by selecting the same number of random points from within
a background and correlating them with the same GF. Parameters
of random simulations are evaluated and an observed number of
associations of FOIs with a GF are compared with a Gaussian’s
distribution of random simulations. A user has the option to generate
a ﬁle with random features/SNPs and run them as an input to evaluate
the performance of Monte-Carlo simulations.

3.2 Implementation

GenomeRunner was developed using Visual Basic 2010 and the
ALGLIB add-0n (http://www.alglib.net), and is distributed as an
executable program along with source code.

4 RESULTS

As a proof of principle of the potential of GenomeRunner
to discover associations, we ran an enrichment analysis of
all 5190 probes recognizing non-coding RNAs on Affymetrix’s
Human Gene 1.0 ST array. GenomeRunner found them enriched
within genes (P=3.04E-05) but signiﬁcantly underrepresented
in exon regions (P=5.25E—21), conﬁrming recently published
ﬁndings (Rearick et al., 2011). Another positive control was
validation of the H3K4me2 -DNAse hypersensitive site association

(Birney et al., 2007), (P<1.00E—32). More examples of
GenomeRunner analyses are shown in Supplementary Material.

5 CONCLUSION

GenomeRunner is designed to scan a large set of genomic features,
including non-gene regions such as ncRNAs and epigenetic marks,
in search of correlations with genomic F01. The open-ended
structure of GenomeRunner can and will be adapted to be included in
the Galaxy suite. Currently, human and mouse genome annotations
are available for GenomeRunner; and new organisms will be added
in the near future. Besides automatic correlation of FOIs with
known genomic features, GenomeRunner will calculate enrichment
against either the whole genome or a user-deﬁned background.
In summary, we provide the scientiﬁc community with a tool
for automated exploration of statistically signiﬁcant associations
between experimental FOIs and annotated genomic features.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The explosion of interest in non-coding RNAs, together
with improvements in RNA X-ray crystallography, has led to a rapid
increase in RNA structures at atomic resolution from 847 in 2005
to 1900 in 2010. The success of whole-genome sequencing has
led to an explosive growth of unaligned homologous sequences.
Consequently, there is a compelling and urgent need for user-
friendly tools for producing structure-informed RNA alignments. Most
alignment software considers the primary sequence alone; some
specialized alignment software can also include Watson—Crick base
pairs, but none adequately addresses the needs introduced by
the rapid influx of both sequence and structural data. Therefore,
we have developed the Boulder ALignment Editor (ALE), which
is a web-based RNA alignment editor, designed for editing and
assessing alignments using structural information. Some features of
BoulderALE include the annotation and evaluation of an alignment
based on isostericity of Watson—Crick and non-Watson—Crick base
pairs, along with the collapsing (horizontally and vertically) of the
alignment, while maintaining the ability to edit the alignment.

1 INTRODUCTION

The RNA Alignment Ontology (Brown et al., 2009) provides several
key recommendations that are essential for the development of a
user—friendly editor of alignments of a few dozen to a few hundred
sequences, consisting of a few hundred base pairs. These are: (i)
the incorporation of concepts introduced by the RNA Ontology,
in particular the Leontis—Westhof classiﬁcation system for non—
Watson—Crick base pairs (Leontis et al., 2002; Leontis and Westhof,
2001; Stombaugh et al., 2009), which are the building blocks
of tertiary motifs (Nasalean et al., 2009); (ii) the annotation of
speciﬁc regions within the structures (e. g. the P4 helix of RNase P),
which can be used to support alternative notions of correspondence
(sequence level versus structure level), including homology; and (iii)
the ability to perform both horizontal and vertical collapsing of the
alignment, allowing the user to focus on speciﬁc sequences or on
speciﬁc regions of the alignment. Several additional considerations
that are especially useful for curating large databases of structured
RNAs such as Rfam (Grifﬁths—Jones et al., 2003), the RNase P
database (Brown, 1999) and the tRNA database (Juhling et al.,
2009) are (i) the functionality to dynamically score an alignment

based on its ability to preserve features of a known structure,
including non—Watson—Crick pairing and to highlight mismatches
in a context, where the user can edit the alignment to resolve
these mismatches; (ii) to Visualize the secondary structure of any
sequence within the RNA family based on the consensus secondary
structure using standard tools that can be embedded in a web
context (Darty et al., 2009); and (iii) to exploit recently discovered
compositional preferences in RNA structural regions (Smit et al.,
2009) to indicate when an alignment is a plausible representative
of a putative secondary structure. Additional desiderata include a
high level of interactivity, for example, the ability to dynamically
rearrange rows of the alignments to juxtapose relevant groups, and
the ability to stretch, rotate and otherwise manipulate the picture of
the secondary structure, while keeping the bases aligned.

2 THE BOULDERALE SOFTWARE

BoulderALE is built on the PyCogent toolkit (Knight et al., 2007)
and combines these features into a single web application that
will greatly assist both in the curation of RNA family databases
and in the understanding of novel RNA structures. BoulderALE is
available at http://www.microbio.me/boulderale, and source code
and unit—tests can be obtained from sourceforge under the GPL
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/boulderale). The availability of the
source code will allow the developers of other RNA resources
to integrate BoulderALE in their own web sites. BoulderALE
fully implements several of the ROC recommendations, including
the ability to display and evaluate non—Watson—Crick base pairs,
annotate structural regions within the RNA interactively [including
automatic inference of these annotations from infernal (Nawrocki
et al., 2009) covariance models], horizontal and vertical collapsing
based on manual choices of sequences or regions, and display
and evaluation of secondary structures. Some other considerations
include automatically deciding which sequences or regions to
collapse, and fully implementing the RNA Alignment Ontology
correspondence concepts.

A typical workﬂow is as follows: ﬁrst, the alignment is input
as a Stockholm or FASTA ﬁle. Then, a list of valid base
pairs, including non—Watson—Crick base pairs, associated with one
reference sequence, is uploaded. A tab—delimited ﬁle including
locations of regions or motifs can also be uploaded. Alternatively,
the list of valid base pairs and features can be stored in the Stockholm
ﬁle. Using the secondary structure (including non—Watson—Crick
base pairs), it is then possible to highlight base pairs in the secondary
structure that do or do not match in the alignment, and the user can
then edit the alignment to optimize this matching. Base composition
metrics can also be produced, and the secondary structure can be

plotted. This workﬂow is illustrated in Figure 1. Finally, features
can be mapped onto the alignment, and BoulderALE allows the
alignment to be vertically or horizontally collapsed to focus the
user’s attention on speciﬁc taxa or regions of the sequence. In
practice, it is often useful to do this iteratively, cleaning up a
particular region of the alignment in each of several closely related
groups of sequences, then aligning the groups of sequences to
each other to reveal higher—level correspondences that rely more
on structure than on sequence.

3 COMPARISONS WITH OTHER SOFTWARE

There are other software packages that offer some overlapping
functionality with BoulderALE, but they are targeted for different
alignment problems. Jalview (Clamp et al., 2004), although web—
embeddable, lacks the ability to incorporate structural data. BioEdit
(Hall, 1999), although user—friendly and allowing for Watson—
Crick pairing, is restricted to the Windows platform and does not
allow for horizontal collapsing. S2S (J ossinet and Westhof, 2005)
allows for non—Watson—Crick base pairs; however, many users ﬁnd
its interface conventions counterintuitive, since it was primarily
designed for modeling RNA, and it cannot annotate and collapse
structural motifs. MultiSeq (Roberts et al., 2006) can do ﬁltering
and grouping of redundant sequences, but lacks a representation
of non—Watson—Crick base pairs. SARSE (Andersen et al., 2007)
and RALEE (Grifﬁths—Jones, 2005) allow for feature coloring,
however; they both lack the ability to annotate non—Watson—Crick
basepairing and horizontal collapsing. These examples are intended

to be illustrative rather than exhaustive, since there are several
sequence alignment editors to choose from, many of which are
optimized for speciﬁc tasks other than those addressed here.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, BoulderALE provides a user—friendly package that
allows rapid visualization of RNA sequence alignments that have
previously been inaccessible, especially through the collapsing of
features that rapidly focus the user’s attention on speciﬁc parts of
the alignment, while highlighting features allow users to identify
speciﬁc sequences or regions that require manual cleanup. We
believe BoulderALE will thus assist users in dealing with the ﬂood
of structural and sequence data now becoming available.

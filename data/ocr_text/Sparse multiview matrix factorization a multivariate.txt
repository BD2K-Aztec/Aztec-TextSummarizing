Abstract

Motivation: Within any given tissue, gene expression levels can vary extensively among individ—
uals. Such heterogeneity can be caused by genetic and epigenetic variability and may contribute to
disease. The abundance of experimental data now enables the identification of features of gene
expression profiles that are shared across tissues and those that are tissue—specific. While most
current research is concerned with characterizing differential expression by comparing mean
expression profiles across tissues, it is believed that a significant difference in a gene expression’s
variance across tissues may also be associated with molecular mechanisms that are important for
tissue development and function.

Results: We propose a sparse multi—view matrix factorization (sMVMF) algorithm to jointly analyse
gene expression measurements in multiple tissues, where each tissue provides a different ‘view’
of the underlying organism. The proposed methodology can be interpreted as an extension of prin—
cipal component analysis in that it provides the means to decompose the total sample variance in
each tissue into the sum of two components: one capturing the variance that is shared across tis—
sues and one isolating the tissue—specific variances. sMVMF has been used to jointly model mRNA
expression profiles in three tissues obtained from a large and well—phenotyped twins cohort,
TwinsUK. Using sMVMF, we are able to prioritize genes based on whether their variation patterns
are specific to each tissue. Furthermore, using DNA methylation profiles available, we provide sup—
porting evidence that adipose—specific gene expression patterns may be driven by epigenetic
effects.

1 Introduction

 

RNA abundance, as the results of active gene expression, affects cell
differentiation and tissue development (Coulon et 61]., 2013). As
such, it provides a snapshot of the undergoing biological process
Within certain cells or a tissue. Except for house—keeping genes, the

expressions of a large number of genes vary from tissue to tissue,
and some may only be expressed in a particular tissue or a certain
cell type (Xia et 61]., 2007). The regulation of tissue—specific expres—
sion is a complex process in which a gene’s enhancer plays a key
role regulating gene expressions via DNA methylation (Ong and

Corces, 2011). Genes displaying tissue—specific expressions are
widely associated with cell type diversity and tissue development
(Reik, 2007), and aberrant tissue—specific expressions have been
associated with diseases that originated in the underlying tissue
(Lage et al., 2008; van’t Veer et al., 2002). Distinguishing tissue—spe—
cific expressions from expression patterns prevalent in all tissues
holds the promise to enhance fundamental understanding of the uni—
versality and specialization of molecular biological mechanisms and
potentially suggest candidate genes that may regulate traits of inter—
est (Xia et al., 2007). As collecting genome—wide transcriptomic pro-
files from many different tissues of a given individual is becoming
more affordable, large population—based studies are being carried
out to compare gene expression patterns across human tissues (Liu
et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2011).

A common approach to detecting tissue—specific expressions con—
sists of comparing the mean expression levels of individual genes
across tissues. This can be accomplished using standard univariate
test statistics. For instance, Wu et al. (2014) used the two—sample Z—
test to compare non—coding RNA expressions in three embryonic
mouse tissues: they reported approximately 80% of validated
in vivo enhancers exhibited tissue—specific RNA expression that cor—
related with tissue—specific enhancer activity. Yang et al. (2011)
applied a modified version of Tukey’s (1949) range test, a test statis—
tic based on the standardized mean difference between two groups,
to compare expression levels of 127 human tissues, and results of
this study are publicly available in the VeryGene database. A related
database, TiGER (Liu et al., 2008), has also been created by com—
paring expression sequence tags in 30 human tissues using a bino—
mial test on expression sequence tag counts. Both VeryGene and
TiGER contain up—to—date annotated lists of tissue—specific gene ex—
pressions, which generated hypotheses for studies in the area of
pathogenic mechanism, diagnosis and therapeutic research (Wu
et al., 2009).

More recent studies have gone beyond the single—gene compari-
son and aimed at extracting multivariate patterns of differential
gene expression across tissues. Xiao et al. (2014) applied the higher-
order generalized singular value decomposition method proposed by
Ponnapalli et al. (2011) and compared co—expression networks from
multiple tissues. This technique is able to highlight co—expression
patterns that are equally significant in all tissues or exclusively sig-
nificant in a particular tissue. The rationale for a multivariate ap—
proach is that when a gene regulator is switched on, it can raise the
expression level of all its downstream genes in specific tissues.
Hence, a multi—gene analysis may be a more powerful approach.

While most studies explore the differences in the mean of expres—
sion, the sample variance is another interesting feature to consider.
Traditionally, comparison of expression variances has been carried
out in case—control studies (Mar et al., 2011). Using an F—test, sig—
nificantly high or low gene expression variance has been observed in
many disease populations including lung adenocarcinoma and
colorectal cancer, whereas the difference in mean expression levels
was not found significant between cases and controls (H0 et al.,
2008). In a tissue—related study, Cheung et al. (2003) carried out a
genome—wide assessment of gene expressions in human lymphoblas-
toid cells. Using an F—test, the authors showed that high—variance
genes were mostly associated with functions such as cytoskeleton,
protein modification and transport, whereas low—variance genes
were mostly associated with signal transduction and cell death/
proliferation.

In this work, we introduce a novel multivariate methodology
that can detect patterns of differential variance across tissues. We
regard the gene expression profiles in each tissue as providing a

different ‘view’ of the underlying organism and propose an ap—
proach to carry out such a multi—view analysis. Our objective is to
identify genes that jointly explain the same amount of sample vari—
ance in all tissues—the ‘shared’ variance—and genes that explain
substantially higher variances in each specific tissue separately—the
‘tissue—specific’ variances—while the shared variance has been ac—
counted for. During this process, we impose a constraint that the
factors driving shared and tissue—specific variability must be uncor—
related, so that the total sample variance can be decomposed into
the two corresponding components. The proposed methodology,
called sparse multi—view matrix factorization (sMVMF), can be in—
terpreted as an extension of principal component analysis (PCA),
which is traditionally used to identify a handful of latent factors
(LFs) explaining a large portion of sample variance separately in
each tissue.

The rest of this article is organized as follows. The sMVMF
methodology is presented in Section 2, where we also discuss con—
nections with a traditional PCA and derive the parameter estimation
algorithm. In Section 3, we demonstrate the main feature of the pro—
posed method on simulated data and report on comparison with al-
ternative univariate and multivariate approaches. In Section 4, we
apply the sMVMF to compare mRNA expressions in three tissues
obtained from a large twin population, the TwinsUK cohort. We
conclude in Section 5 with a discussion.

2 Methods

2.1 Sparse multi—view matrix factorization

We assume to have collected p gene expression measurements for M
different tissues. Ideally, the data for all tissues should be derived
from the same underlying random sample (as in our application,
Section 4) to remove sources of biological variability that can poten—
tially induce differences in gene expression profiles across tissues. In
practice, however, cross—tissue experiments rarely collect samples
from the same set of subjects or may fail quality control. In our set—
ting, therefore, we assume M different random samples, each one
contributing a different tissue dataset. The mth dataset consists of
nm subjects, and the expression profiles are arranged in an nm x p
matrix. All matrices are collected in X : {X(1), Xm, ..., X(M)},
where the superscripts refer to tissue indices. For each X0”), we sub—
tract the column mean from each column, such that each diagonal
entry of the scaled gram matrix, % (X(m))TX(m), is proportional to
the sample variance of the corresponding variable and the trace is
the total sample variance. We aim to identify genes that jointly ex-
plain a large amount of sample expression variances in all tissues
and genes that explain substantially higher variances in a specific tis—
sue. Our strategy involves approximating each ﬁXW) by the sum
of a shared variance component and a tissue—specific component:

 

1
n X(m) % SW) + T0”) (1)

shared variance component tissue—specific variance component
for m : 1,2,  ,M, where 1/,/nm is a scaling factor such that the
trace of the gram matrix of the left—hand—side equals the sample vari—

ance. These components are defined so as to yield the following
properties:

a. The rank of SW) and T0") are both much smaller than min(nm, p),
so that the two components provide insights into the intrinsic
structure of the data while discarding redundant information.

b. The variation patterns captured by shared component are uncor—
related to the variation patterns captured by tissue—speciﬁc

component. As a consequence of this, the total variance ex—
plained by SW) and To") altogether equals the sum of the vari—
ance explained by each individual component.

c. The shared component explains the same amount of variance of
each gene expression in all tissues. As such, the difference in ex-
pression variance between tissues is exclusively captured in tis—
sue—speciﬁc variance component.

We start by proposing a factorization of both SW) and To")
which, by imposing certain constraints, will satisfy the above prop—
erties. Suppose rank (5071)) = d and rank (T079) : r, where d, r
<< min(nm, p) following property (a). For a given r, To") can be ex—
pressed as the product of an nm X r full rank matrix WW) and the
transpose of a p X r full rank matrix V0”), that is:

T071) : W(m)(V(m))T : Z W(m)(vi(m))T : Z T6371) (2)
i=1 i=1

where the superscript T denotes matrix transpose, and the subscript j de—
notes the jth column of the corresponding matrix. Each T63”) :2 W/l-(m)
(VI-(M1))T has the same dimension as To") and is composed of a tissue—
specific LF. An LP is an unobservable variable assumed to control
the patterns of observed variables and hence may provide insights into
the intrinsic mechanism that drives the difference of expression
variability between tissues. The matrix factorization in (2) is not
unique, since for any r X r non—singular square matrix
R, To”) = w<m>(v<m>)T = (w<m>R)(R-1(V<m>)T) = WRVWUT.
We introduce an orthogonal constraint (W(m))TW(m) : I, so that the
matrix factorization is unique subject to an isometric transformation.
Similarly, we can factorize the shared component as:

d d
m m >l< T m * T m
S< >2 U< )(V) 2:11,: )(Vk) = 5(4) (3)
k=1 k=1
where U0”) is orthogonal and V* is tissue independent which we
shall explain. Each 58:1) has the same dimension as SW) and is com—
posed of one shared variability LF. The resulting multi-view matrix

factorization (MVMF) then is:

 

1 m N m * T m m T
MXH N U( )(V) +W( )(V( )) (4)

The matrix factorizations (2) and (3) are intimately related to the
singular value decomposition (SVD) of SW) and To”). Specifically,
U0") and WW) are analogous to the matrix of left singular vectors
and also the principal components (PCs) in a standard PCA. They rep—
resent gene expression patterns in a low—dimensional space where
each dimension is derived from the original gene expression measure—
ments such that the maximal amount of variance is explained. We
shall refer the columns of U0") and WW) as the principal projections
(PPJ). (V*)T and (Wm) )T are analogous to the product of the diagonal
matrix of eigenvalues and the matrix of right singular vectors. Since
the singular values determine the amount of variance explained and
the right singular vectors correspond to the loadings in the PCA which
quantifies the importance of the genes to the expression variance ex—
plained, using the same matrix V* for all tissues in the shared compo—
nent results in the same amount of shared variability explained for
each gene expression probe, such that property (c) is satisfied. We
shall refer to matrices V* and V0”) as transformation matrices.

A sufficient condition to satisfy property (b) is:

(U‘mbTWW) = 0.1x. <5)

This constraint, in addition to the orthogonality of U0") and
WW), results in the (d —l— r) PPJs represented by [U(m), WW”) being

pairwise orthogonal, which is analogous to the standard PCA where
the PCs are orthogonal. Intuitively, this means for each tissue, the
LFs driving shared and tissue—specific variability are uncorrelated.
The amount of variance explained in tissue m, 6'21, can be computed
as (subject to a constant factor):

a; = Tr{(s<m>)TS<m> + (T<m>)TT<m> + 2(s<m>)TT<m>} (6)

where Tr denotes the matrix trace. Recalling that SW) : U(m)(V*)T
and (U(m))TU(m) : I d, the amount of shared variance explained is:

0* = Tr{<S<m>)Ts<m>} = Tr{V*<V*)T} <7)

Likewise, recalling that To") : Iii/("1)(V(m))T and (W(m))TW(m) : 1,,
the amount of tissue—specific variance explained is:

am = Tr{<T<m>)TT<m>} = Tr{v<m><v<m>)T} <8)
Making the same substitutions into (6), we obtain:
a; = Tr{V*(V*)T + V<m>(v<m>)T + 2V*(U<m>)TW<m>(V<m>)T}
Substituting (5 ) into the above equation, we reach:
6:, = Tr{V*<V*)T + v<m><v<m>)T} = 0* + am <9)

which satisfies (b).

2.2 Sparsity constraints and estimation
The factorization (4) is obtained by minimizing the squared error.
This amounts to minimizing the loss function:

M
1
e = E : II—HXW — U<m><v*)T — W‘m)(V‘m))Tllz <10)
m=1 nm j:

where  . f refers to the Frobenius norm, subject to the following or—
thogonality constraints:

(U<m))TU<m) :1, (W<m>)Tv</<m> =1, (u<m>)TW<m> =0. (11)

For fixed U(m)(V*)T, the optimal To") : Iii/("1)(V(m))T is a low—rank
approximation of  ﬁXW) — SW)  , where each rank sequen—
tially captures the maximal variance remained in each data matrix
after removing the shared variability. Likewise, for fixed
W(m)(V(m))T, each rank of the optimal SW) : U(m)(V*)T sequen—
tially captures the maximal variance remained across all tissues after
removing the tissue—specific variance.

In transcriptomics studies, it is widely believed that the differ—
ences in gene expressions between cell and tissue types are largely
determined by transcripts derived from a small number of tissue—spe—
cific genes (Jongeneel et al., 2005). Therefore, it seems reasonable
that in our application of multi—tissue comparison of gene expres—
sions, for each PP], the corresponding column in the transformation
matrix should feature a limited number of non—zero entries. In such
a scenario, a sparse representation will not only generate more reli-
able statistical models by excluding noise features but also offer
more biological insight into the underlying cellular mechanism (Ma
and Huang, 2008).

In the context of MVMF, we induce sparse estimates of V* and
Wm) by adding penalty terms to the loss function E (U, W, V*, V) as
in (10). Specifically, we minimize:

M
e (U. W. V*, V) +2 - M- ||V*A*||1+ZZ IIV‘m)A‘m)II1 <12)

where  ||1 denotes the £1 norm. A* and AW) are d X d and r X r diag—
onal matrices, respectively. In both matrices, the lath diagonal entry

is a non—negative regularization parameter for the lath column of the
corresponding transformation matrix and the lath column tends to
have more zero entries as the lath diagonal entry increases. In prac—
tice, a parsimonious parametrization may be employed where
A* : 211,) and AW) : 221, for m : 1,  ,M so that the number of
parameters to be specified is greatly reduced. Alternatively, A* and
AW) may be set such that a specified number of variables are se—
lected in each column of 17* and V m).

The optimization problem (12) with constraints (11) is not
jointly convex in U0”), WW), V0") and V* for m : 1, 2, ..., M (for in-
stance the orthogonality constraints are non-convex in nature),
hence gradient descent algorithms will suffer from multiple local
minima (Gorski et al., 2007). We propose to solve the optimization
problem by alternately minimizing with respect to one parameter in
U0"), WW), V*, Wm) while fixing all remaining parameters and re-
peating this procedure until the algorithm converges numerically.
The minimization problem with respect to V* or V0") alone is
strictly convex, hence in these steps, a coordinate descent algorithm
(CDA) is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum (Friedman
et al., 2007). CDA iteratively update the parameter vector by cyclic—
ally updating one component of the vector at a time, until conver—
gence. On the other hand, the minimization problem with respect to
WW) or U0") is not convex. For fixed V* and Wm), the estimates of
WW) and U0") that minimize (12) can be jointly computed via a
closed form solution. Assuming we have obtained initial estimates
of V* and Wm), we cyclically update the parameters in the following
order:

(UW), W(m)) _, V(m) _, V*

Here U0") and WW) are jointly estimated in the first step, and in
the subsequent steps, Wm) and V* are updated separately, while
keeping the previous estimates fixed. A detailed explanation of how
each update is performed is in order.

First we reformulate the estimation problem as follows: we bind
the columns of U0") and WW) and define the nm x (d —l— r) augmented
matrix: [70”) : [U(m) , WW”); we then bind the columns of V* and
V0”) and define the p X (d —l— r) matrix: Wm) : [V* , V079]. As such:

1 m ~(m) ~(m) T 2
x< >—U (V ) ll;

 

M:

e (U, W, V*,V<m>) 2 ||

1 V”m

S
H

and the constraints in (1 1) can be combined into:

~ ("1)

~(m)
<U )TU = 1.1+.

Fixing Wm), the estimate of [70”) can be obtained by the reduced—
rank Procrustes rotation procedure which seeks the optimum rotation
of X0") such that the error  ﬁXW) — U(m)(l7(m))T  is minimal.
For a proof of this, see Zou et al. (2006). We obtain the SVD of ﬂ
X0") Wm) as PQRT and compute the estimate of [70”) by:
2W) T
U 2 PR .

Next, we fix U0”), WW) and V* while minimizing (12) with re-
spect to V0”). For each fixed m, varying V0”) only changes the ob—
jective function via the summand indexed (m). Hence, it is sufficient
to minimize:

|| 1
x/nm

This function is strictly convex in Wm), and the CDA is guaran—

 

X<m> — U<m><v*)T — w<m><v<m>ﬂlé +2||V(’”)A(m)ll1- <13)

teed to converge to the global minimum. We drop the superscript

(m) in the following derivation for convenience and denote the jth
column of the matrix V by V). In each iteration, the estimate of V,- is
found by equating the first derivative of (13) with respect to  to
zero. Hence:

 

1 T
—2( n X—UV*—WVT> W,+2A,--v(|V,-|)=o,

where V is the gradient operator. Substitute (11) and rearrange to
give:

Vi = XTW) — A) ' V(|Vi|)

We define the sign function 0(3)) which equals 1 if 3) > 0, —1 if
3) < 0 and 0 if 3): 0. First, note the derivative of the function |3)| is
0(3)) if 3) 7A 0 and a real number in the interval (—1, 1) otherwise.
Rearrange the previous equation to obtain the updated estimate in
each iteration:

where S),(3)) is a soft—thresholding function on vector 3) with non-
negative parameter 2, such that S),(3)) : 0(3)) -max{|3)| — 2, 0} and
Alim) is the jth diagonal entry of AW).

In the third step, we fix the estimates of U0”), WW) and Wm)
and minimize (12) with respect to V*. The objective function
becomes:

€+2-M- ||V*A*||1 (15)

where E is defined in (10). As in the second step, we use a CDA in

each iteration and the updated estimate of V;k is found by equating

the first derivative of (15) to zero. Specifically:

M 1<) <) <) ()TT
2171:;{lMX —U V—W (V  a}

+2-M-Ar-v<)v:<)=o,

 

where A: is the ith diagonal entry of A*. Applying (11), this can be
re-arranged into:

 

>l< M 1 m T m * >l<
M-V)=Z(Mx< >) U) )—M-A)-V(IV.-I),

Using the soft—thresholding and the sign functions, the updated

m=1

estimate in each iteration can be re—written as:

M T
v: 25A) 1: 1 x0“) UV") (16)
1 ,' Mm:1 /nm 1

The cyclic CDA requires initial estimates of V* and Wm), which

 

are obtained as follows. First, we set an initial value to V*, which ex—
plains as much variance in all datasets in X as possible. This
amounts to a PCA on the (23:1 nm) X p matrix X obtained by
binding the rows of all data matrices ﬁXW), m : 1, ...,M. We
compute the truncated SVD of X and obtain X : UDBT where D
contains the d largest eigenvalues of XTX. The initial estimate of V*
is then defined as:

M). 1
(V )T =MDBT, <17)

and UW) is defined by the corresponding rows of U in the SVD. For
the tissue—specific transformation matrices V0”), we compute the

The initial estimate of Wm) is defined as:

A summary of the estimation procedure is given in Algorithm 1.

The sMVMF contains two sets of parameters: the tissue—specific
sparsity parameters AW), A* and the (d, r) pair. Both d and r balance
model complexity and the amount of variance explained. We select
the smallest possible values of d and r such that a prescribed propor—
tion of variance is explained. For a fixed (d, r) pair, we propose to
optimize the model with respect to the choice of sparsity parameters
using a variable selection procedure called ‘stability selection’, which
is particularly effective in improving variable selection accuracy and
reducing the number of false positives in high—dimensional settings
(Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2010). Stability selection consists of fit—
ting the sparse model to a large number of randomly generated sub—
samples, each of which typically contains half of the subjects.
Variable selection results across all subsamples are collected to com—
pute empirical selection probabilities. A cutoff probability value is
then chosen and the variables whose selection probability (SP) is larger
than this threshold are selected by this procedure. One of the appeal—
ing features of this approach is that the ranking of variables, especially
the high-ranking variables, is generally insensitive to the choice of reg—
ularization parameters. An overview of the stability selection proced—
ure is given in Supplementary Material, Section A.

3 Illustration with simulated data

In this section, we present simulation studies to characterize how the
sMVMF method is able to distinguish between shared and tissue—
specific variance. We simulate shared and tissue—specific variance
patterns as illustrated by the middle and right panels in Figure 1. We
then test whether sMVMF correctly decomposes the total sample
variance (left panel) while detecting variables contributing to the
non-random variability within each variance component. We also
compare sMVMF with two alternative methods: standard PCA and
Levene’s test (Gastwirth et al., 2009) of the equality of variance be—
tween population groups.

3.1 Simulation setting

Our simulation study consists of 1000 independent experiments.
In each experiment, we simulate three data matrices or datasets
(tissues) of dimension n: 100 (samples) and p :500 (genes). Each
simulated data matrix X (m) is obtained via:

X(m) : y(m) + z(m) + Ev”),
where YO") is a component designed to control the shared variance,

Z0") is introduced to control the tissue—specific variance and E0”) is
a random error. They are all nxp random matrices. Since we

Fig. 1. Simulated patterns of sample variance: the total, non-random, sample
variance of 30 signal-carrying random variables is generated so that it can be
decomposed into the sum of shared and tissue-specific components. Rows
correspond to tissues (datasets) and columns correspond to 30 variables.
Brighter colours represent large variance and darker colours represent low
variance. Although by construction the underlying shared and tissue-specific
variances have very different patterns, sMVMF is able to discriminate be-
tween them

ultimately wish to test whether our method is able to distinguish be—
tween signal and noise variables, we assume that only the first 30
variables carry the signal, whereas the remaining 470 only introduce
noise.

We suppose that the shared variability is controlled by the acti—
vation of 3 LFs, each regulating the variance of a different block of
variables. To this end, we further group the 30 signal variables into
three blocks of 10 normally distributed random variables each
(numbered 1—10, 11—20 and 21—30), as illustrated in Figure 2A. We
design the simulations so that each of the first 30 variables in Y has
the same variance in different datasets; moreover, the variance de—
creases while moving from the first to the third block. Further de—
tails and simulation parameters are available in the Supplementary
Material, Section B. This procedure generates shared variance pat—
terns that look like those reported in the middle panel of Figure 1.

The variables in Z are also assumed to be normally distributed.
They are generated such that exactly 10 of them have the largest
variance across datasets. The resulting ‘mosaic’ structure of the
simulated variance patterns is illustrated in right panel of Figure 1.
The data matrices Y0”) and Z0") are generated such that the total
non-random sample variance of each variable in a tissue equals the
sum of its shared and tissue—specific variances, which is also illus—
trated in Figure 1. The random error term E0") is generated from in-
dependent and identical standard normal distributions for all
variables in all datasets. As a result of this simulation design, we are
able to characterize the true underlying architecture that explains
the total sample variance.

3.2 Simulation results

The data generated in each experiment were analysed by fitting the
sMVMF algorithm. To focus on the ability of the model to disentan—
gle the true sources of variability, we take d=3 and r: 1, which
equal the true number of shared and tissue—specific LFs used to gen—
erate the data. The regularization parameters A* and A("’) are tuned
such that each PP] consists of 10 variables, the true number of signal
variables.

For comparison, we propose two additional approaches that are
able to identify variables featuring dataset—specific sample variances,
although they do not attempt to model the shared variance. The first
method consists of carrying out a separate PCA on each dataset; for
each PCA/dataset, we then select the 10 variables having the largest
loadings in the first PC. The second method consists of applying a
standard Levene’s test of equality of population variances independ—
ently for each variable, which is then followed by a Bonferroni ad—
justment to control the family—wise error rate; if a test rejects the
null hypothesis at the 5% significance level, we select the variable
having the largest sample variance among the three datasets.

By averaging across 1000 experiments, we are able to estimate
the probability that each one of the 30 signal variables is selected by

(A) The true latent structure used to generate the data. (B) and (C) The esti-
mated probabilities that each variable has been selected as signal-carrier
using sMVMF and a stacked-PCA approach, respectively. sMVMF accurately
captures the true shared LF structure, whereas stacked-PCA tends to identify
variables with large variance but fails to identify the LF structure

each one of the three competing methods. The heatmaps (A—C) in
Figure 3 visually represent these selection probabilities. Here
sMVMF perfectly identifies the variables that introduce dataset—
specific variability. The results obtained using Levene’s tests are
somewhat similar, except for some variables in the first block
(indexed 3—8) and second block (indexed 14—17). By reference to
the middle panel of Figure 1, it can be noted that these variables are
precisely those featuring large shared variability by construction. On
the other hand, the PCA—based approach performs poorly because it
can only select variables that contribute to explaining the total sam—
ple variance but is unable to capture dataset—specific patterns. This
example is meant to illustrate the limitations of both univariate and
multivariate approaches that do not explicitly account for factors
driving shared and dataset—specific effects. sMVMF has been de—
signed to address exactly these limitations.

Both Levene’s test and the individual—PCA approach are not
designed to capture shared variance patterns. As a way of direct
comparison with sMVMF, we therefore propose an alternative
PCA—based approach that has the potential to identify variables
associated to the direction of largest variance across all three data—
sets. This method consists of performing a single PCA on a ‘stacked’
matrix of dimension (Mn) x p containing measurements collected
from all three datasets and obtained by coalescing the rows of the
three individual data matrices. By varying the cutoff value for
thresholding the loadings of the first PC, we are able to select the
top 10, 20 and 30 variables. We shall refer to this approach as
stacked—PCA.

Results produced by sMVMF and stacked—PCA are summarized
by the heatmaps (B) and (C) in Figure 2 and can be directly com—
pared with the true simulated patterns in (A). As expected, stacked—
PCA tends to select variables having large total sample variances,
whereas sMVMF can identify variables affected by each shared LF
which jointly explain a large amount of variance. This example
shows that sMVMF is able to identify the variables associated to the
LFs controlling the shared variance.

We also carried out a simulation, based upon the same setting,
with smaller signal—to—noise ratio, i.e. by sampling the random error
terms in E0") from independent normal distributions having larger
variance. The results were very similar to the previous setting, ex—
cept that Levene’s test was hardly able to identify any tissue—specific
genes. The heatmaps summarizing model performances are given in
Supplementary Material, Section C.

4 Application to the TwinsUK cohort

4.1 Data preparation

TwinsUK is one of the most deeply phenotyped and well—
characterized adult twin cohort in the world (Moayyeri et al.,
2013). It has been widely used in studying the genetic basis of aging

11—..1

Fig. 3. Three different methods—sMVMF, Levene's test and PCA—are used to
detect random variables whose variance pattern is dataset-specific. Each
heatmap represents the selection probabilities estimated by each method. (A)
sMVMF produces patterns that closely match the true tissue-specific vari-
ances shown in the right panel of Figure 1. (B) Levene's test performs well for
variables those variance is mostly driven by tissue-specific factors but fails to
detect those variables having a strong shared-variance component. (C) The
PCA-based method cannot distinguish between shared and tissue-specific
variability, and fails to recover the true pattern

procession and complex diseases (Codd et al., 2013). More import—
antly, it contains a broad range of ‘omics’ data including genomic,
epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles among others (Bell et al.,
2012). In this study, we focus on comparing the variance of mRNA
expressions in adipose (subcutaneous fat), lymphoblastoid cell lines
(LCLs) and skin tissues. The microarray data used in this study were
obtained from the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource
(Nica et al., 2011), with participants being recruited from the
TwinsUK registry. Peripheral blood samples were artificially trans—
formed from mature blood cells by infecting them with the Epstein—
Barr virus (Glass et al., 2013). All tissue samples were collected
from 856 female Caucasian twins (154 monozygotic twin pairs, 232
dizygotic twin pairs and 84 singletons) aged between 39 and 85
years (mean 62 years). Genome—wide expression profiling was per-
formed using Illumina Human HT-12 V3 BeadChips, which
included 48 804 probes. Log2—transformed expression signals were
normalized per tissue using quantile normalization of the replicates
of each individual followed by quantile normalization across all in-
dividuals, as described in Nica et al. (2011). In addition, we also had
access to 450K methylation data of the same adipose biopsies pro—
filed using Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip Kit
(Wolber et al., 2014). We only retained probes whose expression
levels were measured in all three tissues and removed subjects com—
prising unmeasured expressions in any tissue. Using the same nota—
tion introduced before, this resulted in three data matrices each of
dimension n : 618 and p :26 017. For each probe in each tissue, a
linear regression model was fitted to regress out the effects of age
and experimental batch, following the same procedure as in
Grundberg et al. (2012). Residuals in adipose, LCL and skin tissues
were arranged in n X p matrices X(1),X(2), X6), respectively, for
further analysis using the proposed MVMF method.

4.2 Experimental results

Non—sparse MVMF was initially fitted for all combination of par-
ameter pairs (d, r) in a grid. For each model fit, we computed the
percentage of variance explained in each tissue. These are shown in
the 3D bar charts presented in the Supplementary Figure S5. The
percentages of variance explained varied between 25.2%
(d = r = 1, LCL) and 87.3% (d = r = 160, skin). The following
analyses are based on the d = r = 3 setting, which explains at least
40% of expression variance across tissues. Given that there are
more than 26 000 probes, and this is much larger than the sample
size, this choice of parameters offers a good balance between dimen—
sionality reduction and retaining a large portion of total variance.
Although two other combinations of (d, r), i.e. (2, 4) and (4, 2), also
explain a similar amount of total variance, we have found that the
gene ranking results are not extremely sensitive to these values. For

more details on this sensitivity analysis, see Supplementary Material,
Section D.

The sparse version of our model, sMVMF, was then fitted to
each subsample in stability selection procedure to rank gene expres—
sions explaining a large amount of shared and tissue—specific vari—
ances respectively. A detailed description of the procedure is
presented in Supplementary Material, Section A. In summary, 1000
random subsamples were generated each consisting of 309 subjects
randomly and independently sampled without replacement from a
total of 618. N0 twin pair was included in any subsample to remove
possible correlations due to zygosity. sMVMF was fitted to each
subsample, where the sparsity parameters were fixed such that each
column of the transformation matrices comprised exactly 100 non—
zero entries. There were 3274 mRNA expression probes that were
selected at least once from any of the transformation matrices.

Probes that explain a large amount of expression variance exclu—
sively in one tissue are of particular interest. To make such probes
visually discernible, we propose a new visualization tool, the SPOW
(Selection PrObability Wheel) plot. The plot in Figure 4 consists of
3274 fan slices corresponding to probes that are selected at least once
in all subsamples, re—ordered by their selection probabilities in 
The wheel is further divided into four rings, representing shared, adi—
pose—, LCL— and skin tissue, respectively. Each ring is assigned a
unique colour spectrum to illustrate selection probabilities of the
probes: brighter colours denote a higher probability and darker col—
ours denote a lower probability. Probes featuring exclusively shared
or tissue—specific variability can be found along the radii where only
one part is painted in a bright colour and the other three parts are
coloured in black. The SPOW plots for the top 200 probes that
explain shared and tissue—specific variability, respectively, are
presented in Supplementary Figures S6—S9, where such probes can
be more easily captured.

Four groups of mRNA expressions were selected for further in—
vestigation, corresponding to shared—exclusive, adipose—, LCL— and
skin—exclusive expressions. Each group consisted of probes whose
selection probabilities were larger than 0.5 in the corresponding

Fig. 4. TwinsUK study: resulting SPOW plot. The wheel comprises four rings,
which correspond to shared, adipose-, LCL- and skin-specific variability from
the inner ring. It is also evenly divided into 3274 fan slices, corresponding to
3274 mRNA expression probes that are selected at least once in all sub-
samples. Probes are re-ordered by their selection probabilities in the trans-
formation matrix in the shared component. Brighter colour denotes higher
probability, whereas darker colour denotes lower probability. We are particu-
larly interested in probes with high SP exclusively in one ring

transformation matrix and less than 0.005 in the other transform—
ation matrices. These thresholds were set to give a manageable num—
ber of featured gene probes while tolerating occasional selection in
the other groups. This procedure selected 294 genes for further
study, including 114 adipose—exclusive, 83 LCL—exclusive, 64 skin—
exclusive and 33 shared—exclusive genes. We summarize the results
in Table 1. A Venn—diagram representation of the results is given in
Supplementary Material, Section E.

For each tissue, we performed an enrichment test by overlapping
genes in our list with genes contained in the TiGER and VeryGene
databases to examine the extent of agreement. In addition, a Gene
Ontology biological process pathway enrichment test (Ashburner et
al., 2000) and a Cytoscape pathway (CP) analysis (Saito et al.,
2012) were carried out to reveal the function of the pathways which
the 261 tissue—exclusive genes belonged to and FDR—corrected P val—
ues were reported (see Supplementary Tables T1 and T2 for full re-
sults). Below we present test results for each group of genes
separately for each tissue. We also report the SP for some selected
probes.

4.2.1 Skin-exclusive genes

Fifteen of the 64 genes from our skin—exclusive list are contained in
the combined TiGEIUVeryGene list, giving rise to significant enrich-
ment of our list with Fisher exact test P value P < 1046. The over—
lapping genes include serine protease family genes KLK5 (SP: 1.000)
and KLK7 (SP: 1.000), which are highly expressed in the epidermis
and related to various skin conditions, such as cell shedding (des—
quamation) (Brattsand and Egelrud, 1999). Another member
ALOX12B (SP: 1.000) controls producing 12 R—LOX, which adds
an oxygen molecule to a fatty acid to produce the 12 R—hydroperox—
yeicosatetraenoic acid that has major function in the skin cell prolif-
eration and differentiation (de Juanes et al., 2009). The skin—
exclusive genes have also been found significantly enriched in two
biological processes, namely epidermis development and cell—cell
adhesion (P < 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively).

4.2.2 LCL-exclusive genes

LCLs are not natural human cells: they are laboratory—induced im—
mortal cells that have abnormal telomerase activity and tumorigenic
property (Sie et al., 2009). Since neither TiGER nor VeryGene as—
sessed transcriptomic profile in LCL cells, we obtained LCLs data
from Li et al. (2010), in which the authors compared LCLs expres—
sion profile in four human populations and reported 282 LCL—spe—
cific expression genes. Nine of those genes are contained in our
LCL—exclusive gene list, giving a Fisher exact test P < 10‘“. These
include CDK5R1 (SP: 0.961) and HEY1 (SP: 1.000), which are
key genes in the transformation of B lymphocytes to LCLs (Zhao et
al., 2006). Pathway analysis of the LCL—exclusive genes reveals
several aging and cell—death—related pathways such as regulation of
telomerase (CP enrichment test, P=0.014), small cell lung cancer

(CP enrichment test, P: 0.019) and cell cycle checkpoints (CP en—
richment test, P = 0.021). These results show that our tissue—exclu—
sive genes represent tissue unique molecular functions and biological
pathways, which may be used to validate known pathways or dis—
cover new biological mechanisms.

4.2.3 Adipose-exclusive genes

ApoB (SP: 1.000) is the only member in our adipose—exclusive list
which is also contained in the list of known adipose—specific expres—
sion genes (Fisher exact test, P = 0.05). ApoB is one of the primary
apolipoproteins that transport cholesterol to peripheral tissues
(Knott et al., 1986) and it has been widely linked to fat formation
(Riches et al., 1999). In adipose, the selected genes are found signifi—
cantly enriched in triglyceride catabolic process pathway
(P: 0.022), which is in line with the fact that adipose tissue is the
major storage site for fat in the form of triglycerides. Pathway ana—
lysis reveals that genes in the adipose—exclusive list are significantly
enriched in triglyceride catabolic process pathway (P = 0.022),
which agrees with the fact that adipose tissue is the major storage
site for fat in the form of triglycerides. In addition, these genes are
enriched in inflammation pathways, such as lymphocyte chemotaxis
(P=0.016) and neutrophil chemotaxis (P=0.027). This coincides
with previous findings of the complex and strong link between me—
tabolism and immune system in adipose tissue (Tilg and Moschen,
2006).

For this tissue, we were also able to further investigate the causes
for the observed adipose—exclusive gene expression variability. One
possible explanation could be that environmental factors influenced
an individual’s epigenetic status, which subsequently regulated gene
expression (Razin and Cedar, 1991). As a mediator of gene regula—
tory mechanisms, DNA methylation is crucial to genomic functions
such as transcription, chromosomal stability, imprinting and X-
chromosome inactivation (Lokk et al., 2014), which consequently
inﬂuence an individual’s tissue development (Ziller et al., 2013). It
thus seemed reasonable to hypothesize that the expression of tissue—
exclusive genes could be modified by their methylation status in the
same tissue.

We sought to identify genes featuring a statistically significant
linear relationship between the gene’s methylation profile and its ex—
pression value from the same tissue. In adipose biopsies, where both
transcriptome and methylation data are available, we found that
68.4% (78 out of 114 genes) of the genes had expression levels sig—
nificantly associated with their methylation status using a linear fit
(Bonferroni correction, P < 0.05) (see Supplementary Table T3, for
full lists). We then wanted to assess whether a similar number of lin-
ear associations could be found by chance only by randomly select—
ing any genes, not only those that feature adipose—exclusive
variability and testing for association between gene expression and
methylation levels. This was done by randomly extracting the same,
fixed number (132) of expression probes and corresponding methy—
lation levels from adipose tissue and fitting a linear model as before.
By repeating this experiment 1000 times, we obtained the empirical
distribution reported in Supplementary Figure 810. This distribution
suggested that all the proportions were below 0.2, compared with
our observed proportion of 0.684, which provided overwhelming
evidence that DNA methylation was an important factor affecting
the expression of the tissue—exclusive genes. It was notable that the
adipose—exclusive variability of ApoB was regulated by methylation
at 50 bp upstream of the Transcriptional Starting Site (linear fit,
P : 2.1 x 10_5 ), which agreed with the findings that the promoter
of ApoB has tissue—specific and species—specific methylation property
(Apostel et al., 2002). Apart from ApoB, we also found that

methylation in Syk was associated with Syk expression level, which
was potentially involved in B cell development and cell apoptosis
(Ma et al., 2010).

5 Conclusion

The proposed sMVMF method facilitates the comparison of gene ex—
pression variances across multiple tissues. The primary challenge
of this task arises from the interference between substantial c0—
variability of gene expressions across all tissues and substantial vari—
ability of gene expressions featured only in specific tissues.
Characterizing tissue—specific variability can shed light on the biolo—
gical processes involved with tissue differentiation. Analysing shared
variability can potentially reveal genes that are involved in complex
or basic biological processes and may as well enhance the estimation
of tissue—specific variability.

sMVMF has been used here to compare gene expression vari—
ances in three human tissues from the TwinsUK cohort. Two hun—
dred sixty—one genes having substantial expression variability
exclusively featured in one tissue have been identified. Enrichment
tests showed significant overlaps between our lists of tissue—exclu—
sive genes and those reported in the TiGER and VeryGene data—
bases, which were established by comparing mean expression levels.
This confirms the link between tissue—specific expression variance
and the biological functions associated with particular tissues. In fu—
ture work, it would be interesting to explore the functions of the tis—
sue—exclusive genes from our list that have not been reported in
existing databases. We further showed adipose—exclusive expression
variability was driven by an epigenetic effect. Using these results as a
guiding principle, we expect our methods and results could improve
efficiencies in mapping functional genes by reducing the multiple
testing and enhancing the knowledge of gene function in tissue de—
velopment and disease phenotypes. Future works would consist of
investigating the outcome of tissue—exclusive expression variability,
for which we can perform association studies between expressions
of tissue—exclusive genes and disease phenotypes related to adipose
and skin tissues.

Abstract

Motivation: A simple static image of genomes and associated metadata is very limiting, as re—
searchers expect rich, interactive tools similar to the web applications found in the post—Web 2.0
world. GenomeD3Plot is a light weight visualization library written in javascript using the D3 li—
brary. GenomeD3Plot provides a rich API to allow the rapid visualization of complex genomic data
using a convenient standards based JSON configuration file. When integrated into existing web
services GenomeD3Plot allows researchers to interact with data, dynamically alter the view, or
even resize or reposition the visualization in their browser window. In addition GenomeD3Plot has
built in functionality to export any resulting genome visualization in PNG or SVG format for easy in—
clusion in manuscripts or presentations.

Results: GenomeD3Plot is being utilized in the recently released lslandviewer 3 (WV\AN.pathoge—
nomics.sfu.ca/islandviewer/) to visualize predicted genomic islands with other genome annotation
data. However, its features enable it to be more widely applicable for dynamic visualization of gen—
omic data in general.

Availability and implementation: GenomeD3Plot is licensed under the GNU—GPL v3 at https://

1 Introduction

In the study of an organism’s genome multiple data sources are often
integrated along side the genome to facilitate analysis (Langille
et 61]., 2009). Two often used methods for visualization are linear or
circular representations of the genome stacked with this additional
data as seen in tools such as GMOD (Stein et al, 2002) or Circos
(Krzywinski et 61]., 2009). However these often create either static
image or visualizations with limited interaction not taking advan—
tage of the advances in web browsers and their associated javascript
engines. Newer tools have been produced such as JBrowse (Skinner
et 61]., 2009) that bring dynamic interaction to these datasets, but un—
fortunately act more like a standalone tool, being complex to setup
and not integrating seamlessly in to existing analysis platforms.

Other tools such as Scribl (Miller et 61]., 2013) and Genome Maps
(Medina et 61]., 2013) lack a circular genome view, which is useful
for some types of microbial analyses (Dhillon et 61]., 2013).

GenomeD3Plot takes advantage of the well supported D3 library
(http://d3js.0rg/) used by hundreds of websites globally to allow
rapid creation of dynamic, interactive visualizations of datasets. The
goal in the development of GenomeD3Plot was to create a library
with minimal external dependencies that could be integrated in to
existing web applications just as a developer might include an image
or table. The use of JSON, a standardized and well supported data
format, to configure a visualization with GenomeD3Plot reduces the
burden on developers and lowers the complexity of use.

GenomeD3Plot

 

2 Features

GenomeD3Plot features an easy to use JSON based data language
for visualizations. In its simplest form, a developer needs only define
the tracks, give the size of the genome and the base pairs boundaries
of elements to visualize, GenomeD3Plot will create an SVG canvas
and plot the genomes and associated metadata as either a linear or
circular view

2.1 Track types
GenomeD3Plot contains four track types that may be displayed:

Standard Track—a set of start and end base pair to visualize regions
of a genome

Stranded Track—similar to a standard track but with an additional
strand parameter for each region to visualize the region above or
below the mid—point of the track

Plot track—A series of base pairs of equal distance to visualize con—
tinuous data such as average GC content

Glyph Track—Features to be shown at a speciﬁc base pair, with the
ability to dynamically stack as needed in a crowded visualization.

2.2 API

GenomeD3Plot features a rich API to allow developers to dynamic—
ally manipulate visualizations. Tracks can be hidden and added
back, the radius of tracks in a circular plot can be shifted, or the plot
can be zoomed or resized. To assist in seeing visualization updates,
elements animate in and out or to new locations on the plot.

In addition, callbacks can be configured to call javascript func—
tions or objects on mouseover, mouseout and click events allowing
for a rich interaction experience with other existing website
elements.

With just two function calls, a linear and circular plot can also
be tied together so that manipulation of one will cause a mirror al-
teration in the other, such as zooming or changing the visible region
of the genome.

2.3 Interactivity

GenomeD3Plot responds to drag and mousewheel events to control
the zoom level and visible region of a linear genome plot. In addition
there are optional drag bars to allow users to dynamically resize the
visualizations to better fit their screens. Hover tooltips can be auto—
matically added to regions to assist researchers in navigating the
visualization. When a circular and linear plot are linked together on
the same page, a shaded slice on the circular plot can also be shown
to assist researchers in navigating what region on the genome they’re
zoomed to on the linear plot. As well, double click events are cap—
tured to recentre the focused region.

2.4 Integration

GenomeD3Plot works best when integrated as a component of a
larger platform; it has recently been integrated as the visualization
component of a number of analysis pipelines and databases
including a new version of IslandViewer (Dhillon et al., 2015) and
the Pseudomonas Genome Database (Winsor et al., 2011). As well
it’s being used as a visualization tool in the Integrated Infectious
Disease Analysis (IRIDA) bacterial genome analysis platform (www.
IRIDA.ca).

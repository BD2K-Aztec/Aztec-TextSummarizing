ABSTRACT

Summary: UPDtool is a computational tool for detection and classifi-
cation of uniparental disomy (UPD) in trio SNP-microarray experi-
ments. UPDs are rare events of chromosomal malsegregation and
describe the condition of two homologous chromosomes or homolo-
gous chromosomal segments that were inherited from one parent. The
occurrence of UPD can be of major clinical relevance. Though high-
throughput molecular screening techniques are widely used, detection
of UPDs and especially the subclassification remains complex. We
developed UPDtool to detect and classify UPDs from SNP microarray
data of parent—child trios. The algorithm was tested using five positive
controls including both iso- and heterodisomic segmental UPDs and
30 trios from the HapMap project as negative controls. With UPDtool,
we were able to correctly identify all occurrences of non-mosaic UPD
within our positive controls, whereas no occurrence of UPD was found
within our negative controls. In addition, the chromosomal breakage
points could be determined more precisely than by microsatellite
analysis. Our results were compared with both the gold standard,
microsatellite analysis and SNPtrio, another program available for
UPD detection. UPDtool is platform independent, light weight and
flexible. Because of its simple input format, UPDtool may also be
used with other high-throughput technologies (e.g. next-generation
sequencing).

1 INTRODUCTION

In a normal diploid karyotype (46,XX or 46,XY, respectively),
each chromosome pair consists of one maternal and one paternal
inherited homologue. Uniparental disomy (UPD) is character-
ized by the presence of a chromosome pair or homologous
chromosomal segment that was inherited from solely one
parent. UPDs can be divided into maternal and paternal by

origin of the homologous chromosomes. Further subclassiﬁca-
tion is based on the information whether both homologous
chromosomes originate from the same (isodisomy) or both (het-
erodisomy) chromosomes of one parent. Also, mixtures of both
subtypes (combined iso- and heterodisomy) are possible. The
mechanisms leading to UPD are complex and were discussed
in detail in a recent review (Yamazawa et al., 2010). Generally,
UPD can affect each chromosome, and the incidence is estimated
to be ~l:3500 of live births. Phenotypes associated with UPD,
owing to either imprinting disturbance or unmasking recessive
mutations, have been described for nearly all autosomes
(Gardner et al., 2011). The pathogenesis of UPD is determined
by both epigenetic imprinting [e.g. Silver—Russell syndrome (chr.
7, maternal), Prader—Willi syndrome (chr. 15, maternal),
Beckwith—Wiedemann syndrome (chr. ll, paternal) and
Angelman syndrome (chr 15, paternal)] as well as unmasking
of autosomal—recessive diseases [e.g. isodisomy of chromosome
9 in Leigh syndrome (Tiranti et al., 1999)]. The clinical findings
of two of our positive controls with UPD (7) were published
previously (Eggermann et al., 2008).

Microsatellite analysis as well as methylation speciﬁc tests as a
genomewide screening tool for UPDs are laborious, expensive
and imprecise owing to the limited number of markers that are
available per chromosome. In contrast, the widely applied high-
throughput genotyping technologies such as whole-genome
high-density SNP microarrays or next-generation sequencing
provide hundreds of thousands of genotypes in one experiment.
Owing to homozygosity by descendants, microsatellite analysis
as well as UPD detection based on genotypes may be of limited
informative value in consanguineous families. Especially, trio
experiments are thought to render UDP detection possible
(Altug-Teber et al., 2005; Bruce et al., 2005). Genotype informa-
tion from children and their parents allows detection of inherit-
ance errors, also called Mendelian errors (ME). Causes for
unexpected calls can be found not only in genotyping errors
but also in UPD regions. Contrary to UPD regions, genotyping
errors are evenly distributed over all chromosomes and occur at
a low rate, e.g. <0.l% in an Affymetrix 50K array (Saunders
et al., 2007). Yet, detection of UPD and especially heterodisomic
regions as well as further subclassiﬁcation of UPD regions (e.g.
paternal, maternal) is still not routinely carried out. To our
knowledge, only SNPtrio, a webtool, is publicly available and
implements trio information for UPD detection (Ting et al.,
2007). Among the reasons for the development of UPDtool

were the need for a lightweight and ﬂexible tool with simple
input and output ﬁle format that might be used with different
genotyping techniques (microarrays but also next-generation
sequencing). UPDtool was implemented as a portable and plat-
form-independent software solution for detection of both hetero-
and isodisomic regions on tab-delimited SNP ﬁles.

2 METHOD AND RESULTS

We developed a novel algorithm for UPD detection, which is
brieﬂy summarized in the following. An UPD stretch contains
SNPs of same inheritance that can be both informative (i.e. MES)
and non-infonnative (i.e. inheritance of both parents cannot be
excluded). Each ME is used as starting point for a putative UPD
stretch and extended to both sides. This extension is stopped by
the occurrence of SNPs of different inheritance. To mitigate the
effect of random genotype detection errors, adjacent stretches
with the same inheritance mode are joined. Finally, all stretches

with less than a given number of MEs will be removed. The
mode of inheritance (maternal, paternal) depends on the pattern
of MEs found. For further subclassiﬁcation, all UPD stretches
are split into stretches of isodisomy and heterodisomy by the
fraction of homozygous and heterozygous SNPs that are
acquired using a sliding window approach. This additional in-
formation helps to detect loss of heterozygosity that is indicative
for an isodisomy, whereas a large fraction of genotypes that
could only be inherited from one parent indicates a heterodis-
omy. UPDtool does not evaluate allelic ratios and is therefore
not optimized for the detection of mosaicism. The whole work-
flow and an example of a combined hetero- and isodisomy are
depicted in Figure 1. For further details on workflow and ﬁle
formats, see the documentation of this software package.

To test the performance of UPDtool, we obtained microarray
data (Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0, Affymetrix) from
ﬁve trios that were previously characterized by microsatellite
analysis (Supplementary Table Sl, positive controls) and 30

Fig. 1. Overview on the algorithm used by UPDtool to detect UPDs and the results of two exemplary samples for chromosome 14. (A) Part A shows the
decision tree for detection and classiﬁcation of UPDs. The given parameters are the standard parameters used by UPDtool. (B) Part B is divided into two
subsections. The upper part shows the results of UPDtool for chromosome 14 in a control case, whereas the lower part illustrates some characteristic
features of different UPD types. In our positive control, the fraction of MEs in a 1k window is above 1% throughout chromosome 14. In addition, a
high fraction of genotypes identical to the mother indicate a heterodisomy from 20 to 24 MB and from 71 to 106 MB. From 24 to 70 MB, a high fraction
of homozygous genotypes points toward an isodisomy. Legend: FracHom=red line=fraction of genotypes in 1k window that is homozygous,
FracME: green line=fraction of MEs in a 1k window, FracIdentFather 2 blue line: fraction of genotypes within a 1k window where both alleles
are identical to the fathers” alleles, FracIdentMother= black line=fraction of genotypes within a 1k window where both alleles are identical to the
mothers’ alleles. All different lines start at 20.5 MB, as there are no genotypes available before this position on chromosome 14 owing to constitutional

HapMap trios (negative controls). All positive controls were pro-
cessed using the standard protocols given by the manufacturer
followed by a basic analysis with Genome analysis toolkit
(v. 4.1.1, Affymetrix). Copy number variations (CNV) were
ruled out before analysis, as CNVs might interfere with UPD
detection. For further analysis with UPDtool, the genotypes
were exported and converted to the input format using the
UPDconverter tool.

We were able to detect all non-mosaic UPDs present within
our positive controls (Supplementary Table S1). The breakpoints
between hetero- and isodisomy could be determined more pre-
cisely than by microsatellite analysis. Furthermore, we were able
to conﬁrm the rate of MEs found in the literature within our
reference cohort (rate of MEs: 0.00036 per patient, SD +/—
0.00013). All MEs found within the reference cohort were dis-
tributed evenly over all chromosomes and were evenly inherited
from both parents. The analysis of one trio took ~60 s. As an
internal control, we were able to safely detect previously identi-
ﬁed deletions that may mimic isodisomic stretches down to
100 kb (~20 MEs). Detection of small indels is considered to
be a measure for sensitivity representing the resolution of the
algorithm used. The overall results of UPDtool are comparable
with those of SNPtrio and microsatellite analysis
(Supplementary Table S1). However, SNPtrio divided at least
in our hands heterodisomic regions into multiple short stretches
of non-speciﬁed and isodisomic UPD.

3 CONCLUSION

UPDtool is a fast, lightweight and platform-independent tool for
detection and classiﬁcation of UPDs. We were able to detect
hetero- and isodisomies from maternal and paternal origin pre-
sent in our positive controls. All UPD stretches were identiﬁed
correctly, and breakpoints within a chromosome could be deter-
mined more precisely compared with microsatellite analysis.
Owing to the simple input format, UPDtool may likely be
used to analyze SNPs of other high-throughput platforms.

Moreover, UPDtool is easy to install because it is platform in-
dependent and portable. UPDtool currently does not evaluate
copy number data—for this reason, CNVs should be ruled out
by another bioinformatic method before UPD detection.

UPDtool was written in C#, and we provide a platform-inde-
pendent executable for windows and linux, both 32 and 64 bit.
The only requirement of UPDtool is an installation of the .NET
4.0 or Mono framework. For generation of images, R has to be
installed and added to the PATH environment variable. A data
converter for the widely used Genome-Wide Human SNP Array
6.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara) is provided. Additionally,
UPDtool comes with a tool that enables batch analysis of
larger cohorts.

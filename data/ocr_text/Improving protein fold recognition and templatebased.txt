ABSTRACT

Motivation: In recent years, development of a single-method fold-
recognition server lags behind consensus and multiple template
techniques. However, a good consensus prediction relies on the
accuracy of individual methods. This article reports our efforts
to further improve a single-method fold recognition technique
called SPARKS by changing the alignment scoring function and
incorporating the SPINE-X techniques that make improved prediction
of secondary structure, backbone torsion angle and solvent
accessible surface area.

Results: The new method called SPARKS-X was tested with the
SALIGN benchmark for alignment accuracy, Lindahl and SCOP
benchmarks for fold recognition, and CASP 9 blind test for structure
prediction. The method is compared to several state-of-the-art
techniques such as HHPRED and BoostThreader. Results show
that SPARKS-X is one of the best single-method fold recognition
techniques. We further note that incorporating multiple templates and
refinement in model building will likely further improve SPARKS-X.
Availability: The method is available as a SPARKS-X server at
http://sparks.informatics.iupui.edu/

1 INTRODUCTION

Given a query protein sequence with unknown structure, the most
reliable structure prediction technique is to recognize its matching
structural folds from existing known structures with or without
signiﬁcant sequence similarity (called homology modeling and fold
recognition, respectively). This approach is also known as template-
based modeling. Template-based modeling becomes increasingly
powerful because most popular structure folds (adopted by multiple
sequences) are known (Dai and Zhou, 2011; Kihara and Skolnick,
2003; Zhang et al., 2006).

However, recognizing structurally similar folds in the absence of
sequence similarity (fold recognition) is challenging, as revealed
from the critical assessment of structure prediction (CASP)

techniques. CASP experiments highlighted the importance of post-
treatment of models predicted by individual fold recognition
methods through the use of consensus predictions [For example,
ROBETTA (ChiVian et al., 2003), Pmodeller6 (Wallner et al. , 2007),
Fams-ace (Terashi et al., 2007), Phyre (Bennett-Lovsey et al.,
2008)] and/or constrained template—fragment recombination and
reﬁnement [For example, Chunk—TASSER (Zhou et al., 2007a),
I—TASSER (Zhang, 2007)]. The experiments also indicated a
convergence of techniques that can be broadly characterized as
mixing and matching of multiple fragments and templates (Bujnicki,
2006; Zhou et al., 2010). Examples of recently developed new
methods include the combined use of fragment and template
comparison (Zhou and Skolnick, 2010), non—linear scoring function
from conditional random ﬁeld model (Peng and Xu, 2009) and
proﬁle entropy (Peng and Xu, 2010), employment of predicted
torsion angles (Wu and Zhang, 2008; Zhang et al., 2008) and
a combined use of proﬁle—proﬁle alignment and pairwise and
solvation potentials (Lobley et al., 2009).

We have developed a series of single fold recognition methods
(SPARKS, SP2, SP3, SP4 and SP5) that are based on weighted
matching of multiple proﬁles that include sequence proﬁles
generated from multiple sequence alignment (Altschul et al., 1997),
predicted versus actual secondary structures (Rost et al., 1997;
Zhou and Zhou, 2004, 2005a), knowledge-based proﬁle (single-
body) score function (Zhou and Zhou, 2004), depth-dependent
sequence proﬁles derived from template structures (Zhou and Zhou,
2005a), predicted versus actual solvent accessible surface area (Liu
et al., 2007) and predicted versus actual dihedral angles (Zhang
et al., 2008). Statistically signiﬁcant improvement is observed for
the accuracy and sensitivity of fold recognition as the number of
matching proﬁles increases from 3 to 5 (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang
et al., 2008; Zhou and Zhou, 2004, 2005a). In particular, SPARKS,
SP3 and SP4 were ranked among the top performers for automatic
servers in CASP 6 (Tress et al., 2005; Zhou and Zhou, 2005b) and
CASP 7 (Battey et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2007) experiments.

One issue in the methods developed above is that matching
predicted 1D proﬁles of query sequence with actual proﬁles of
templates is based on simple difference matrices. It does not account
for the probability of errors in predicted 1D structural properties
such as secondary structure, backbone torsion angles and solvent
accessible surface area. In this article, we introduce energy terms

SPARKS-X for fold recognition

 

based on the estimated probability of a match between predicted
and actual 1D structural properties, a technique commonly used
in fold recognition based on hidden Markov models (Hargbo and
Elofsson, 1999). In addition, we take advantage of recently improved
accuracy in predicted secondary structure [Q3 = 81 — 82% by SPINE
X (E.Faraggi et al., submitted for publication)], torsion angles
[SPINE X (Faraggi et al., 2009b), mean absolute error = 33°
for w and 22° for ([5] and solvent accessibility (ASA) [correlation
coefﬁcient of 0.74 between predicted and actual values, Real-SPINE
3.0 (Faraggi et al., 2009a)]. The above proposed algorithm leads
to the new method called SPARKS-X in order to distinguish from
previous SP series methods.

We tested SPARKS-X alignment accuracy, fold recognition and
structure prediction by using several benchmarks, compared it to
several state-of-the-art techniques and participated in the automatic
server part of CASP (CASP 9). All results indicate that SPARKS—
X is one of the best single-method fold recognition servers.
The performance of the method can likely be further improved
signiﬁcantly by incorporating the techniques of multiple templates
and reﬁnement in model building that are employed in many other
automatic servers.

2 METHODS

2.1 Alignment score

The alignment score of SP5 for aligning query position i with the template
position j is (Zhang et al., 2008)

S(i,j) = — (1 _ Wstruc)Fa:gry(i) 'M::1?1p1ate(i)

3
t . se . k
—wmcF:.$;1,..</)-Mqu‘éry<z)—Zk=IWkAy+ssm (1)

with weight parameters (Wstruc, Wk) and a constant shift Sshjft. The ﬁrst term
in Equation (1) is the proﬁle—proﬁle comparison between the sequence
proﬁle from the query sequence and that from the template sequence.
F332,”) is the sequence-derived frequency proﬁle of the query sequence,
MtsggplateQ) and Maﬁ‘gwa) are the sequence-derived log odd proﬁle of the
template sequence and that of query sequence, respectively. These sequence
proﬁles are constructed by three iterations of PSIBLAST (Altschul et al.,
1997) searching (E value cutoff of 0.001) against non-redundant (NR)
sequence database, which was ﬁltered to remove low-complexity regions,
transmembrane regions and coiled-coil segments (Jones, 1999). The second
term in Equation (1) compares the sequence proﬁle from the query sequence
and that derived from the template structure (sequence proﬁles that would ‘ﬁt’
to the structure). 115335131”) is a depth-dependent sequence proﬁle generated
from the sequences of those structural fragments that are similar to 9-residue
segment structures of the template (Zhou and Zhou, 2005 a). The third term in
Equation (1) measures the difference A;- between the predicted 1D structural
properties of the query sequence and the actual properties of the template
(three-state secondary structure, real-value solvent accessibility and real
value torsion angles).

By comparison, the alignment score developed in this article for SPARKS-
X is as follows:

. . 1 . . . .
S(l’-]) : _ 2—00 [Faigfy(l) 'M’ts:1(111p1ate(])+Fts:I‘111plate(]) 'Maﬁgryaﬂ

+W1E(SSt(i)ISSq(i), Css,q(i))

4
+ZWkE<AI§ICk,q(i))+sshiﬁ. <2)
k=2

There are two major changes from Equation (1) in SP5 to Equation (2)
in SPARKS-X: the removal of sequence proﬁle derived from template

structure (designed sequences for templates) and replacement of simple
difference A;- by energy terms dependent on the predicted conﬁdence—
E(SSt(i)|SSq(j), Css,q(i)) and E(Akij|Ck,q(j)). Here, torsion angles ([5 and w
are treated separately so that the maximum value of k is 4. We dropped the
structure-derived sequence proﬁle (the main novel feature in SP3) because
we found that including this term no longer improves our results in our new
formulation.

The ﬁrst energy term for secondary structure (k: 1) is calculated based

on:

P(SSt|SSq,Css,q)) (3)
P(SSt)

where P(SSt|SSq, C554) is the probability of predicted secondary structure

SSq by SPINE-X with conﬁdence score C554 (Faraggi et al., 2009b) for a

native secondary structure SSt, and the reference probability P(SSt) is the

probability of secondary structure SS; in native proteins. For obtaining the

probabilities, secondary structures were predicted by SPINE-X (E.Faraggi,

submitted for publication) with three states for templates deﬁned according to

DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983). C554 is evenly divided into eight discrete

states.

The second energy term is based on

E(ss,|ssq,css,q)= —ln(

(4)

k
Emklchq): _m( m ICk,q) )

P°(Ak ICk,q)

where P(Ak ICk,q) is the probability of the predicted property having
difference of Ak to corresponding native values with conﬁdence score Cm;
and the reference probability P0(Ak|Ck,q) is obtained by comparing the
predicted one to all native values in the dataset. There are a total of three
terms with k=2 for real valued ¢, k=3 for real valued w, and k=4 for
the real value solvent accessibility. Real value torsion angles ((15 and 10) are
predicted by SPINE-X (Faraggi et al., 2009b). The difference for ([5 and
w are evenly divided into 18 bins, Cm are evenly discretized into eight
states. Real value solvent accessibility is predicted by Real-SPINE 3 (Faraggi
et al., 2009a). The difference values are divided into 20 states, and C44 is
employing 20 amino acids to represent the prediction conﬁdence. All energy
terms were obtained from a NR dataset of 2479 proteins with length <500
amino acids from the original SPINE database [25 % sequence identity cutoff,
X-ray resolution lower than 3 A and no unknown structural regions (Dor and
Zhou, 2007)].

2.2 Parameter training and template ranking

As in SP5, the Smith—Waterman alignment algorithm (Smith and Waterman,
1981) is used to optimize the score that matches the query proﬁles with
template proﬁles. To reduce the number of parameters, we set W2 = W3 (equal
weights for two torsion angles). All weight parameters and two gap penalty
parameters (gap opening g0 and gap extension ge) were trained on the Prosup
structural alignment benchmark (Domingues et al., 2000). The parameters
were trained using the Powell method by many repeats from different random
seeds (Press et al., 1992). The ﬁnal parameters used are W1 = 1.04, W2 = W3 =
0.23, W4 2 3.21, go 2 10.2, ge 20.69 and Sshjft = — 1.52.

The templates are ranked by the greater one of two Z-scores, which is
calculated based on the raw alignment score normalized by L“ or I“ with
L, the full alignment length, l, the non-end gap alignment length and a, a
free parameter. The fractional exponent is introduced to mimic the fractional
exponent employed in calculating domain—domain interactions (Zhou et al.,
2007b). We ﬁnd that 01:3 /4 yields a slightly improved (0.4% in TMscore
of built model for the SCOP_20 dataset, see below) ranking. This ranking
method is the same as used in SP3, SP4 or SP5 except that 01:1 was used
previously.

2.3 CASP 9 template library and model building

An automatically updated template library is used for the threading. When a
new protein is input to the library, it is ﬁrst divided into domains according
to the ‘Author’ parameters in DDOMAIN (Zhou et al., 2007b). The divided

domains are compared to existing domains in the library. If the sequence
identity is <40%, or the TM score [by TM align (Zhang and Skolnick,
2005)] between them is smaller than 0.5, the new domains and its chain
will be included in the library. The automatically updated library had 31 750
templates on July 15, 2010 at the completion of server predictions in CASP 9.

The model is built by modeller9v7 (Sali et al., 1995) using the alignment
generated by SPARKS-X. When there are gaps of >30 residues in the termini,
the program will be recalled to build a model for the missing parts in the
region. After that, these different models are linked and steric clashes are
removed by using the DFIRE potential functions (Yang and Zhou, 2008;
Zhou and Zhou, 2002).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Alignment accuracy

As in SP3 and SP4, SPARKS-X was optimized by using the Prosup
benchmark (Domingues et al., 2000) and tested in SALIGN (Marti-
Renom et al., 2004). The Prosup benchmark, prepared by Sippl’s
group, consists of 127 pairs of proteins with alignment by the
structural alignment program Prosup (Domingues et al., 2000).
The SALIGN benchmark (Marti-Renom et al., 2004) contains 200
selected pairs with an average pair sharing 20% sequence identity
or less and 65% (or more) of structurally equivalent Cu atoms
superposed with an rrnsd of 3.5A (Marti-Renom et al., 2004).
Reference alignment is obtained from the structural alignment
obtained from the TMalign program (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005)
[i.e. TM overlap].

Table 1 shows the alignment accuracy of different methods given
by different benchmarks. There is a consistent gradual improvement
(1—2%) from SP3, SP4 to SP5 but a much larger improvement from
SP5 to SPARKS-X (4—6%). This accuracy is comparable with the
recently developed BoostThreader (Peng and Xu, 2009) or the new
version of Raptor (Peng and Xu, 2010).

It is of interest to know the contribution to the overall accuracy
of SPARKS—X made by individual terms in Equation (2). Table 2
compares the accuracy made by individual scoring terms by
either adding to sequence proﬁle [Position Speciﬁc Scoring Matrix
(PSSM)] or removing from SPARKS-X. The results are obtained by
training with the Prosup benchmark and testing with the SALIGN
benchmark. It is clear that all three terms (secondary structure,
torsion angles and ASA) contributed to the accuracy of alignment.
Adding them to the PSSM increases the alignment accuracy while
removing them from SPARKS-X decreases the accuracy. The
contribution from ASA is the largest (5% adding to PSSM in
SALIGN or 4% removing from SPARKS—X in SALIGN). Smaller

but signiﬁcant contributions are observed for secondary structure
or torsion angles (3—4% for adding to PSSM and 0.4—1% for
removing from SPARKS—X). The results from training and testing
are consistent with each other.

3.2 Testing fold recognition with Lindahl benchmark

The purpose of improving alignment is to increase the ability
of recognizing the correct structural fold of a query sequence
from a template library. We employed the Lindahl Benchmark for
comparing SPARKS—X with different methods. The benchmark is a
large data set of 976 proteins, with 555,434, and 321 pairs of proteins
in the same family, superfamily and fold, respectively (Lindahl
and Elofsson, 2000). Here, the fold recognition sensitivity of each
method is tested by aligning each protein with the rest 966 proteins,
and checking whether or not the method can recognize the member
of same family, superfamily or fold as the ﬁrst ranked or within top
ﬁve ranked templates. Thus, the benchmark tests both the modeling
accuracy and the ranking methods for fold recognition.

Table 3 shows the fraction of correctly recognized matches for
proteins in the same family, superfamily, fold as the ﬁrst ranked or
within top ﬁve ranked templates given by various methods. Although
many published methods have been applied to this benchmark (Kim
et al., 2003; Shi et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2003; Zhou and Zhou, 2004),
we only list the most recent ones (Cheng and Baldi, 2006; Liu
et al., 2007; Peng and Xu, 2009; Zhou and Zhou, 2004, 2005a).
This is because of the time-dependent nature of sequence databases
for sequence proﬁles.

Table 3 indicates that the improvement over SP3, SP4, SP5 in
success rate of fold recognition by SPARKS—X exists in all three
levels (family, superfamily and fold) except the Top 1 ranked model
in superfamily where the success rate is similar between SP5 (59.8%)
and SPARKS—X (59.0%). The largest improvement over SP5 is
observed in fold level (7% absolute increase in Top 1 and 8%
absolute increase for the best in Top 5). This is somewhat expected
because the method was trained for remote homolog recognition
(structurally similar protein with <30% sequence identity in the
Prosup benchmark). Comparing to BoostThreader, SPARKS—X is
less successful in homology detection (family and superfamily in
Top 1) but more successful in fold recognition (2% improvement in
Top 1 and 10% improvement in Top 5) as trained.

The above success rates of matching sequences within the
same SCOP classiﬁcation are based on somewhat subjective SCOP
deﬁnition of family, superfamily and fold (Murzin et al., 1995).
A more direct measurement of accuracy is to calculate the accuracy
of the ﬁrst-ranked model built from the fold recognition alignment.
First, the model is built by transferring the Ca coordinates of the
template structures to the aligned residues in the query sequence.
Then, the constructed model is assessed by using the MaxSub score
between the model and the known native structure. MaxSub score
(Siew et al., 2000) between two structures is a measure of similarity
between them with 0.0 indicating no similarity and 1.0 a perfect
match. The value is calculated by searching for the largest subset of
well-superimposed residues (53.5 A). Table 4 reports the MaxSub
scores for the models built by SP3, SP4, SP5 and SPARKS—X
methods averaged over the number of proteins. Again SPARKS—
X improves over SP5, SP4 and SP3 in all levels. The relative
improvement of SPARKS—X over SF5 in MaxSub score is 12, 22
and 13% in family, superfamily and fold levels, respectively.

3.3 Testing fold recognition with SCOP-20 dataset

We built a SCOP-20 dataset by using domains of sequence
identity <20% and chain lengths >60 from SCOP 1.75. After

removing domains with Cu atoms only, we obtained 6367
domains. We also compared our results with HHPRED (Soding
et al., 2005) (version 1.5.1) and PRC (Madera, 2008) (version
1.5.6) because these two programs could be downloaded and
installed on our local machine. The proﬁles of the domains for
HHPRED are directly downloaded from HHPRED’s web page
(http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred). The proﬁles for PRC are
using proﬁles generated from three iterations of PSIBLAST. For
both these two predictors, default parameters were used. We would
like to emphasize that we have only assessed PRC with the
sequence proﬁles generated from PSIBLAST. Its performance may
be different if other proﬁles are employed.

First, we tested the ability of HHPRED and SPARKS—X to
recognize a match in the same family, same superfamily (after
removing family members from the templates) and same fold (after
further removing superfamily members) according to the SCOP
deﬁnition within top-N templates. Note that on a given search we
removed the query protein from the template library. Figure 1 shows
the success rates of recognizing at least one template within same
family, superfamily or fold as a function of the number (N) of top
predicted matching templates. At the family and superfamily level,
HHPRED has a higher success rate than SPARKS-X based on top
1—12 templates but a lower success rate afterwards. At the fold level,
SPARKS-X has a consistent higher success rate than HHPRED and
the difference becomes greater as more top templates are included.
Similar results are observed in the ROC curve when the true positive
rate is plotted as a function of the false positive rate (Fig. 2) for
all pairs of the SCOP-20 dataset. Here, true positives denote the
detection of the templates within the same classiﬁcation (family,
superfamily or fold). The performance of SPARKS -X is consistently
better than that of HHPRED at the fold level while HHPRED has a
higher true positive rate only at low false positive rate at the family
and superfamily levels.

To avoid somewhat subjective deﬁnition of family, superfamily
and fold, another way to compare the ability of recognizing structural
similarity is to directly calculate the structural similarity between
the target structure and the structure recognized without actually
building the model. Results of average TM score between query and
Top 1 template are shown in Table 5 where structural similarity is
measured by TM align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005). The table shows
that the average TM score given by SPARKS-X is about 3% higher
than that given by HHPRED when all templates are employed.
The difference between the TM scores given by SPARKS-X and
that given by HHPRED is larger if easily recognized templates
are removed. SPARKS-X’s average TM scores are 5, 14 and 16%
higher than that given by HHPRED when templates from same
family, superfamily and fold are excluded from the templates
library. This result indicates that SPARKS—X has a higher ability
than HHPRED or PRC to recognize structurally similar proteins
regardless if they are in the same family, superfamily or same fold.
The results in Table 5 can be further illustrated by a ROC curve
for all SCOP-20 templates (Fig. 3). The positives are deﬁned by
templates having TM score >05 to query structures by TM align

Fig. 3. As in Figure 2. However, the positives are deﬁned as those predicted
template structures with a TM score >05 to the query structure by TM align.
Three sets of results from top to bottom are shown: all pairs, excluding the
templates within the same family, and excluding those within the same family
and superfamily.

(i.e. to test the ability to recognize a similar structure). The ﬁgure
shows that the performance of SPARKS-X is consistently better
than that of HHPRED at detecting structurally similar templates
from all templates, without the same family members, and without
the same family and superfamily members. The difference between
the two methods is small at very low false positive rates (see the
insert of Fig. 3) but increases signiﬁcantly at low false positive
rates. The difference between Figure 3 and Figure 2 is because
family and superfamily members in SCOP are deﬁned according
to sequence evolution origins, rather than structural similarity. Our
results suggest that using structural similarity is more direct and
accurate assessment of the performance of structure prediction
techniques.

The results reported in Table 5 and Figure 3 are based on
direct structural comparison between target and template structures.
A more common comparison is to measure the accuracy of the
model built based on sequence template alignment. We found that
this will further improve the performance of SPARKS-X relative
to that of HHPRED/PRC because SPARKS-X uses local-global
alignment while HHPRED and PRC are based on local alignment.
As a result, SPARKS-X typically gives a longer alignment than
HHPRED and PRC. This leads to improved scores for models
built. For example, the average TM score of Top 1 model from
all templates for HHPRED and SPARKS-X are 0.476 and 0.517,
respectively. This is 9%, rather than 3% improvement based on
structural alignment of target and template structures (Table 5). We
also tested HHPRED with the option of ‘-mact 005’ because this
option leads to almost global alignment and better scoring models.
Although it does not change the ability of recognizing structurally
similar proteins (Table 5), this option indeed increases the average
TM score of Top 1 model from 0.476 to 0.502, which is 3% rather
than 9% behind SPARKS—X.

SPARKS-X for fold recognition

 

3.4 CASP9 blind prediction

SPARKS—X participated in CASP 9 blind test and ranked #21 within
automatic servers in SUM-Zscore, and #12 within independent
groups (after removing redundant servers). The majority of the
methods ranked before SPARKS -X are consensus techniques except
HHPRED and RAPTORX. If the total TM score of Top 5 models
(http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/casp9/) are employed as a
criterion, SPARKS—X is ranked #12 (#6 in groups). This comparison
of Top 5 models is meaningful as all top servers except HHPRED
series submitted ﬁve models. Moreover, if ranked by TM score plus
hydrogen bond score of Top 1 model, SPARKS—X is ranked #6 (#5
in groups) behind QUARK/Zhang-Server, ROSETTA, Seok—Server
and GWS only. This indicates that the models built by SPARKS—X
have better hydrogen bonds than many servers. As a reference, our
method can be compared to MUSTER (Wu and Zhang, 2008), an
extension to the SP4 server (Liu et al., 2007) by incorporating torsion
angles and hydrophobicity. The summed TM score of SPARKS—X
server is 5% higher than that of MUSTER.

4 DISCUSSION

We have reported a new fold recognition server called SPARKS—
X that is signiﬁcantly different from our previous versions in how
the proﬁle—proﬁle matching score is obtained. Moreover, we also
employed signiﬁcantly improved secondary structure prediction,
real value torsion angle prediction and solvent accessibility
prediction. All these techniques made an improvement over our
previous SP series possible. We found that predicted ASA contributes
the most to the overall accuracy of SPARKS—X.

One interesting observation is that SPAKRS-X performs
signiﬁcantly better in recognizing structurally similar proteins (3%)
and in building better models (3%) based on the large dataset
of SCOP-20 and the latest version of HHPRED available on
the web. On the other hand, limited CASP 9 blind prediction
suggests the opposite. The ofﬁcial average GDT score for
147 domains given by HHPREDB is 59.5, compared with
57.7 given by SPARKS-X (http://predictioncenter.org/casp9). This
3% improvement of HHPRED over SPARKS—X is likely due
to signiﬁcantly more sophisticated model building techniques
employed in the unreleased version of HHPRED by using distance
restraints derived from multiple templates together with alignment
conﬁdence. Furthermore, SPARKS-X is only 8% behind the best
automatic server in ofﬁcial average GDT score of Zhang server
(62.2). This 8% is likely due to combined effect of consensus
prediction from multiple fold recognition servers, the use of multiple
templates and model reﬁnement. This is an area of focus in our future
work for further improving SPARKS.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: It becomes widely accepted that human cancer is a dis-
ease involving dynamic changes in the genome and that the missense
mutations constitute the bqu of human genetic variations. A multitude
of computational algorithms, especially the machine learning-based
ones, has consequently been proposed to distinguish missense
changes that contribute to the cancer progression (‘driver’ mutation)
from those that do not (‘passenger’ mutation). However, the existing
methods have multifaceted shortcomings, in the sense that they either
adopt incomplete feature space or depend on protein structural data-
bases which are usually far from integrated.

Results: In this article, we investigated multiple aspects of a missense
mutation and identified a novel feature space that well distinguishes
cancer-associated driver mutations from passenger ones. An index
(DX score) was proposed to evaluate the discriminating capability of
each feature, and a subset of these features which ranks top was
selected to build the SVM classifier. Cross-validation showed that
the classifier trained on our selected features significantly outperforms
the existing ones both in precision and robustness. We applied our
method to several datasets of missense mutations culled from pub-
lished database and literature and obtained more reasonable results
than previous studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Human malignancies are believed to arise as a result of somatic
alterations within the cancer genome that leads to activation of
oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (Hanahan
and Weinberg, 2000; Stratton et al., 2009; Weinberg, 2002, 2006;
Weir et al., 2004). With the recent considerable improvement in
genome analysis technologies, diverse alterations including point
mutations, copy number increases and decreases, loss of allelic
heterozygosity and chromosome translocations in the genome
of a particular cancer type have gradually been speciﬁed.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Among these, the missense mutations (a point mutation that
results in a codon coding for a different amino acid) attract
increasing attentions in that they are recurrently identiﬁed
within the cancer genomes (Jones et al., 2008; Krawczak et al.,
2000; Parsons et al., 2008; Sjoblom et al., 2006). Although up to
hundreds of missense mutations were characterized in the
genome of some cancer type [e.g. brain, breast, colorectal and
pancreatic cancers, see http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/
cosmic/ and also (Jones et al., 2008)], only a small fraction of
these mutations are suggested to directly contribute to the neo-
plastic process (‘driver’ mutation), whereas the remaining bulk
consists of neutral polymorphisms which are believed to have no
direct effect on the tumorigenesis (‘passenger’ mutation)
(Stratton et al., 2009; Wood et al., 2007).

Differentiating driver mutation and passenger mutations is
critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible
for cancer progression and also provides prognostic and diag-
nostic markers as well as targets for therapeutic interventions.
However, the ability to distinguish these drivers is seriously lim-
ited by in vivo functional analyses alone. Therefore, this situation
has provoked a bunch of mathematical methods that assist in
prioritizing potential drivers for further analysis during the past
years. These methods can be mainly categorized into two classes,
the statistical method and the machine learning-based method.
The former is largely based on the assumption that mutations
that occur more frequently are more likely to be a driver muta-
tion [e.g. (Greenman et al., 2006; Parmigiani et al., 2007)], which
turned out to be somehow unreasonable according to recent re-
ports, for example, Wood et a]. (2007) pointed that it is the ‘hills’
(infrequently mutant genes) not the ‘mountains’ (frequently
mutant genes) that dominate the cancer genome landscape.
For the machine learning-based method, on the other hand, re-
searchers typically extract features related to the missense muta-
tions, train a classiﬁer using label-clear mutations and perform
classiﬁcations for the unknowns on the trained classiﬁer.
Through this routine, several groups have reported their results
so far (Carter et al., 2009; Krishnan and Westhead, 2003; Ng and
Henikoff, 2001; Ng and Henikoff, 2002; Sjoblom et al., 2006)
and claimed their performance is better than others based on
different classiﬁer tools, training data and, particularly, on dif-
ferent feature spaces.

The existing machine learning-based methods have shortcom-
ings on several aspects, especially on the feature space they
employ to construct the classiﬁer. For example, in Carter et al.

Extraction scheme for ‘driver' mutation identification

 

(2009) and Krishnan and Westhead (2003), features relating to
physicochemical properties of amino acids and structural traits
of proteins are predicted using computational software. The re-
liability as well as signiﬁcance of such kind of features are dubi-
ous (Krishnan and Westhead, 2003). Others may avoid the
predicted attributes by relying on the published databases that
contain structural traits or annotations they need (Jones et al.,
2008; Sunyaev et al., 2001). The applicability of these models is
limited because of the probable incompleteness of their cited
databases. The remaining work avoids the above ﬂaws at the
price of missing some important properties of the mutation
under investigation—they set up too simple rules for discrimin-
ation (Kaminker et al., 2007; Ng and Henikoff, 2001). The short-
comings mentioned here make questionable the reliability and/ or
robustness of prediction of the existing methods.

In this article, we comprehensively investigated the properties
relating to a particular missense mutation. Besides the previously
used features such as physicochemical changes upon the amino
acid substitution and binary categorical features extracted from
public annotated databases, we for the ﬁrst time systematically
studied all kinds of substitution scoring matrix (SSM) features
and protein sequence-speciﬁc (PSS) features to evaluate their
potential power of discrimination (see Section 2). A SSM (or
mutation matrix) is typically a 20 x 20 numerical matrix with
each element representing the similarity and distance of a par-
ticular pair of amino acids with respect to a particular physico-
chemical or biochemical property (Kawashima et al., 2008),
making it potentially a candidate feature for discrimination.
Some researchers (e.g. Carter et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2008)
have incorporated several well-known substitution matrices
such as PAM (Dayhoff et al., 1978), BLOSUM (Henikoff and
Henikoff, 1992) and Grantham Score (Grantham, 1974) as pre-
dictive features, but is much incomplete. We explored many such
substitution scoring matrices as candidate features and assessed
their distinguishing capability. The PSS features were widely
overlooked in the previous related studies. Instead, they use
structural or functional properties of proteins predicted by com-
putational tools. This scheme is of weak reliability since it easily
loses some essential information. To compensate this potential
information loss, we parse the protein sequences directly, by
which we obtained the sequence-speciﬁc features (k-gram fea-
tures, see Section 2).

To summarize, we proposed a set of 126 candidate predictive
descriptors for training a mutation classiﬁer, most of which have
not been used previously. These features describe a missense mu-
tation from multiple angles including amino acid residues, pro-
tein sequence proﬁles and functional annotations culled from
open databases (details in Section 2). A novel scoring system
(DX score) was employed to evaluate the performance of each
feature in distinguishing the positive from the negative.
Numerical experiments showed that support vector machine
(SVM) classiﬁer trained by the top-ranked 70 features got high-
est cross—validation (CV) accuracy and outperformed the previ-
ous methods both in precision and robustness. Among the
top-ranked 70 features, our proposed SSM and PSS features,
which were largely neglected or simply overlooked in the previ-
ous studies, take an overwhelming part (see Section 3). This
clearly demonstrates the signiﬁcance of them as predictive fea-
tures of a mutation classiﬁer. We tested the classiﬁer on several

distinct datasets collected from published databases along with
literature and got more sensible predictions than before.
Particularly, these novel predictive features are expected to sig-
niﬁcantly improve the current in silico studies of driver mutation
identiﬁcation.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 The whole framework and involved datasets

This work could be divided into two phases: the training phase and clas-
siﬁcation (test) phase. As illustrated in Figure l, the left box shows the
ﬂowchart of the training phase, i.e. data preparation, feature extraction
along with selection and classiﬁer training. Similarly, the right box illus-
trates the procedure of the classiﬁcation phase, which includes data col-
lection, feature extraction and mutation classiﬁcation. The GeneCards is
employed here to help map the referred gene name/ID to the protein
dataset (identiﬁed as Uniprot_sprot.dat in UniProtKB) in order to get
their sequences. The detail of conﬁguration and implementation of the
proposed system will be elucidated in the following sections and the
Supplementary Materials.

In the training phase, neutral polymorphisms (passenger mutations)
were obtained by picking out the records with type ‘Polymorphism’ in the
ﬁle humsavartxt (release 56.8) from the Swiss-Prot Variant Pages (http://
www.uniprot.org/docs/humsavar); cancer-associated variants (putative
driver mutations) were collected from the COSMIC site (v42, see
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/) by extracting those with
explicit missense mutation proﬁle, i.e. the information of the wildtype
residue, the mutant residue and the mutant position is complete; protein
sequences of human being were extracted from the ﬁle uniprot_sprot.dat
on the Swiss-Prot downloading site (http://www.uniprot.org/downloads).

In the test phase, the passenger mutations were collected from the
latest Swiss-Prot variant page (humsavartxt, release January 25, 2012)
by removing those that appeared in the training data; the driver muta-
tions consisting of four disjointed sets (EGFR, TP53, cosmic2+ and
breast/colon, see Section 3) were searched from a recent breast and colo-
rectal tumor resequencing study (Wood et al., 2007) and the latest version
of COSMIC (v57) held out of the training data. We constructed receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) and precision—recall (PR) curves (preci-
sion—recall, see Section 2.4) for EGFR, TP53 and cosmic2+ datasets
while conducted functional analysis for the breast/colon data, since the

ﬁrst three have been well studied experimentally whereas the last one
lacks substantial experimental validation.

Since the original paper provided the related gene names without cor-
responding protein sequences, we hence resorted to a particular database
GeneCards which refers to an online database that assists in identifying a
gene with multiple nicknames [see http://www.genecards.org/ and (Lancet
et al., 2008)]. By this method most of the referred mutations with only
gene name/ID offered can be mapped onto the annotated database (the
category of human in Uniprot_sprot.dat) and consequently the related
protein sequences can be obtained.

2.2 Feature extraction

We investigated a total of 126 attributes that describe a mutation on
several aspects. These attributes can be categorized into four groups: 15
of them are related to amino acid residue changes (AARCs), such as
change in mass, surface, volume, polarity and charge; 51 features are
extracted from dozens of published substitution scoring matrices; 31 of
them are PSS features and 29 annotated features are counted from public
databases. A summary of all the 126 features is shown in Supplementary
Table S1.

2.2.] AARC features The 20 amino acids that compose proteins
have a varied spectrum of physicochemical properties, such as molecular
mass, polarity, hydrophobicity and solvent accessibility. Therefore, a resi-
due change may affect a protein function on many aspects, e. g. its struc-
tural stability and solvent accessibility. We summarized these properties
based on two online amino acid information repositories from BMRB
(http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/referenc/aa_tables.html) and JenaLib (http://
www.imb-jena.de/IMAGE_AA.html) and got a total of 14 features, as
listed in Supplementary Table S3. Variables such as acidicity, polarity,
hydrophobicity and charge are assigned a descriptive integer based on
their chemical properties. For example, the amino acids {C, F, I, L, M, V,
W} and {D, E, G, K, N, P, Q, R, S, T} are assigned a value of —1 or +1
based on whether they are hydrophilic or hydrophobic, respectively;
whereas the remaining ones that are deemed neutral in hydrophobicity
are assigned a 0. The AARC feature for a missense mutation from residue
A,—> Aj is calculated as the difference of the two corresponding values in
this table.

2.2.2 SSM features A SSM (or simply a mutation matrix) is typ-
ically a 20 x 20 numerical matrix with each element describing the rate at
which one residue in a sequence changes into other residue over time. It
works for cases where proteins are evolutionarily related. It has originally
been designed as the basis for scoring schemes in the sequence alignment
and other types of comparative analysis. We employed these SSMs in our
tool under our assumption that the mutations between wild-type and
mutant proteins within the same cell follow processes similar to those
occurring during species evolution. The most commonly used substitution
matrices are the series proposed by Dayhoff et al. in the 1970s and
Henikoff et al. in the 1990s, respectively. Since the values in a substitution
matrix depict the similarity and distance of a particular pair of amino
acids with respect to a particular physicochemical or biochemical prop-
erty (Kawashima et al., 2008), it is a candidate predictive feature for
differentiation. We are not the ﬁrst to come up with this idea, the authors
in Carter et al. (2009) and Jones et al. (2008) have incorporated several
well-known substitution matrices such as PAM (Dayhoff et al., 1978),
BLOSUM (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992) and Grantham Score
(Grantham, 1974) as predictive features. In this article, we explored a
great many scoring matrices collected from the AAIndex database
(Kawashima et al., 2008). The hitherto latest version of AAIndex includes
a total of 94 amino acid substitution matrices, of which we picked 51
most relevant ones (see Supplementary Table S1). The SSM feature for a
missense mutation A,—> Aj is assigned as the element (1', j) of the asso-
ciated mutation matrix.

2.2.3 PSS features We adopted two methods to investigate the
whole sequence proﬁle of a given protein: the 2—gram encoding method
and 6-letter exchange group encoding method based on Wu et al. (1992,
1995); see also Wang et al. (2001). The 2—gram encoding method extracts
various patterns of two consecutive amino acid residues in a protein se-
quence and count the number of occurrences of the extracted residue
pairs. One can deﬁne k—gram (k> 3) features similarly. We limited our
study to k: 2, following the report of Wang et al. showing satisfactory
results using 2—gram features alone. Alternatively, a protein sequence can
be represented by a 6-letter exchange group {61, 62, 63, e4, 65, 66} with
e1 6 {D,E,N,Q}, 62 e {H,R,K}, 63 e {C}, 64 e {S,T,P,A,G}, es 6 {M,I,L,V},
e6 6 {F,Y,W}. Exchange groups represent conservative replacements
through evolution, with each group bearing similar chemical properties
(Supplementary Table S4, see also Dayhoff et al., 1978). The 6-letter
exchange group encoding method ﬁrst represents a protein sequence by
the 6-letter exchange group and then encodes the 6-letter sequence by
repeating the 2—gram encoding scheme. There are 202 + 62 = 436 possible
2—grams in total, which is a huge feature space for most applications. We
follow the method as described in Wang et al. (2001) to select the 30 most
relevant features (2— grams) based on a DX score (detailed in next section).
To compensate the possible information loss due to ignoring the rest of
the 2—grams, we calculate a linear correlation coefﬁcient (LCC) between
the values of the 436 2—grams with respect to the protein sequence
S and the mean value of the 436 2—grams in the positive training dataset
as [still following (Wang et al., 2001)]:

LCC(S) = 1:1 1:1 1:1

where 39- is the mean value of the j—th 2—grams, 1 5 j 5 436, in the positive
training dataset and 39- is the feature value of the j-th 2— grams with respect
to the protein sequence S, deﬁned as x]: cj/(len(S) — 1) in which cj and
len(S) are the number of the occurrence of the j-th 2—grams in the se-
quence S and the length of S, respectively. Note that in our study we
selected the 30 features only from the 400 2—grams but not from the
6-letter exchange group, since the latter is derived from PAM (Dayhoff
et al., 1978) and has been considered in the scoring matrix features al-
ready, as discussed above. However, we need the latter part to calculate
the LCC value. Finally, we got 31 PSS features in total.

2.2.4 Annotated features Following Jones et al. (2008), we ex-
tracted 29 features by retrieving several databases, including UniProt
KnowledgeBase, SwissProt variant page and COSMIC database. Note
that these features include 14 binary categorical features (features 98
through 111 in Supplementary Table S1) annotated in the ‘FT’
(Feature Table, see Supplementary Fig. S1) domain of the UniProt
KnowledgeBase, which means if the mutated gene in study is not included
in the database, these features are unavailable for the referring mutations.
For simplicity, we will next call these 14 features as additional features.
This situation largely restricted the applicability of the involved methods,
as mentioned above. We extracted these features for comparison, which
will be further discussed shortly.

2.3 Feature selection (DX score)

Feature selection is performed in order to remove the most irrelevant and
redundant features and ultimately and help improve the performance of
learning models. Different methods have been proposed to implement the
feature selection. Here we solve this problem based on the DX score as
shown above, where the author adopted it to pick out the most relevant
2—gram features (Wang et al., 2001). Intuitively, this DX score bears the
capability of assessing a feature’s discrimination power in general case.

Extraction scheme for ‘driver' mutation identification

 

By the following deﬁnition (see Solovyev and Makarova, 1993), the DX
score can be considered as a type of signal-noise-ratio:

: (m1 — m0)2

dim?) ’

where m1 and d1 (m0 and d0, respectively) are the mean value and the
standard deviation of the feature in the positive (negative, respectively)
training dataset. Intuitively, the larger the DX score, the feature more
likely separates the positive from the negative. We further point out that
the DX score is equal to the feature score (scaled by a constant) given by
the feature selection tool fselect.py of LIBSVM. In addition, the feature
selection result obtained by DX score is comparable to the SVM-RFE
algorithm, but is superior to the SVM-RFE in computational complexity.
The detail concerning these issues is presented in the Supplementary
Materials.

DX

2.4 Classiﬁcation using SVM

SVM algorithm was proposed by Vapnik as an effective learning ap-
proach for solving two-class pattern recognition problems (Boser et al.,
1992; Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). SVM as a typical supervised machine
learning method is attractive because it is not only well founded theoret-
ically but also superior in practical applications. In most of the pattern
recognition areas, SVM performs substantially better than that of other
machine learning methods, including Neural Network and Decision Tree
classiﬁer (You et al., 2010). In this study, we employed two SVM tools
LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) and SVMlight (J oachims, 1999) as clas-
siﬁers, depending on speciﬁc purposes. The updated version of LIBSVM
can perform the CV automatically, while SVMlight calculates a continu-
ous value reﬂecting the probability of each classiﬁcation, which facilitates
the ROC and PR analyses. The precision and recall statistics are
computed as: precision = TP/(TP + FF) and recall 2 TP/(TP + FN).
Furthermore, it is straightforward to build a classiﬁer using these two
software since all we need to do is to choose a kernel function and to set
the related parameters, certainly an input ﬁle with standard SVM format
is also required. After various trials of different parameters for best per-
formance, we chose the radial basis function with parameter
gamma 2 0.03 and other parameters remained default for both classiﬁers.

2.5 CV methods

Machine learning methods are generally evaluated by a statistical tech-
nique called CV. In n-fold CV, we ﬁrst collected a training dataset with
equal number of both types (drivers and passengers) and then randomly
partitioned the dataset into n subsets of approximately equal size, with
each subset still containing an equal number of mutations of both types.
Finally, 11 — 1 such subsets are combined for training the classiﬁer, which
is subsequently tested on the withheld data. This procedure is repeated
11 times with each subset playing the role of the test subset once. The
prediction accuracy of n-fold CV is deﬁned as the percentage of missense
mutations correctly classiﬁed in the test phrase, averaging on n times of
tests.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Optimization of the feature space

Preliminarily, we collected 29 492 neutral polymorphisms pos-
sessing domain ‘Main gene name’ (to differ from those records
simply identiﬁed as ‘n.a.’) from the Swiss-Prot website and 4881
cancer-associated missense mutations with explicit mutation pro-
ﬁle from the 42nd version of COSMIC database (details in
Section 2). By removing polymorphisms whose associated gene
overlaps with records in the cancer-associated dataset, we got

features used

Fig. 2. Performance of 5-fold CV by adding features sequentially. The
highest prediction accuracy was achieved using the top-ranked 70 features
with 5-fold CV and RBF as kernel function

23 956 polymorphisms. Using the GeneCards database, we
mapped most of the detected polymorphisms to the
UniProtKB database and ﬁnally extracted all the 126 features
for 23 888 polymorphisms and 4193 cancer-associated mutations,
respectively. In our conﬁguration, cancer-associated mutations
are labeled positive and neutral polymorphisms negative. To re-
lieve the unbalance of the training data, we randomly chose 4193
polymorphisms from the whole 23 888 ones and constructed the
training dataset with the two sets of equal size (4193 positive and
4193 negative).

Then we calculated the DX score of each feature of the train-
ing data and ranked them from high to low. Following Krishnan
et al. (Krishnan and Westhead, 2003), we obtained the ﬁnal fea-
ture space through the steps as follows: set up an empty feature
set ﬁrst, features are then added sequentially (with DX score
from high to low) into the basic set to test their impact on the
prediction performance, based on 5-fold CV accuracy. This pro-
cedure is illustrated in Figure 2, from which it can be seen that
the highest accuracy was achieved by adopting the top-ranked 70
features. We also tried several different folds and kernel func-
tions to repeat this procedure and got very similar results
(Supplementary Fig. S2). The top-ranked 70 features together
with their DX scores are listed in Supplementary Table S2.

3.2 Performance of the features in discrimination

Jones et al. (2008) and Parsons et al. (2008) adopted the same 58
predictive features to analyze missense mutations of human pan-
creatic cancer and glioblastoma multiforme respectively, while
Carter et al. (2009) selected 49 from 90 candidate predictive fea-
tures to perform driver mutation prediction. The two feature
sets stand for the hitherto most comprehensive ones in the
existing driver mutation identiﬁcation studies. The latter 49 fea-
tures largely overlapped with the former 58 ones, of which 41
features can be extracted (underlined ones in Supplementary
Table S1). The remaining features predicted by computational
algorithms are missed here because of software accessibility
issue. However, the extracted 41 features assumedly possess
the essential information contained in the 58 ones, since the pre-
dicted structural and functional impacts of the residue have al-
ready been implicitly included in the biochemical properties
of amino acids and the windows-based sequence composition

we compare two feature spaces, one composed of 41 features,
which we term ‘previous’, and our enlarged feature space, com-
posed of 70 features with feature selection, which we term
‘proposed’.

A summary of the feature selection result is presented in
Table 1, where ‘Hit’ refers to the number of previous features
ranking the top 70. It is apparent from Table 1 that the even-
tual feature set mainly consists of SSM and PSS features that
never or seldom used before, whereas only 12 out of the previ-
ously used 41 features were selected by the scoring (Fig. 3). This
implies many powerful discriminators were neglected in the pre-
vious work and on the other hand, the existing could not capture
the essential information of a missense and hence cannot serve as
effective discriminators.

To evaluate the performance of the selected features in discri-
minating between driver and passenger mutations, we performed
hierarchical clustering analysis to them. For clarity of illustra-
tion, we randomly extracted a subset of missense mutations of
each type from the original training data to do clustering ana-
lysis. Figure 4 [drawn by Cluster 3.0 (de Hoon et al., 2004) with
centroid linkage method] shows the effect of hierarchical cluster-
ing on 100 neutral polymorphisms plus 100 cancer-associated
missense mutations, represented by the above mentioned 70
features. The left patch mainly constitutes cancer-associated
mutations while the right patch is dominated by neutral poly-
morphisms. Apparently, the features which well separate the

3.3 Comparison of the prediction performance with
others’ work

A 5-fold CV experiment with carefully calibrated parameters was
performed on a large set of training data, which contained 4193
polymorphisms versus 4193 cancer-associated missense muta-
tions. Figure 5 shows the comparison of the prediction perform-
ance with previous work [referring to the 41 features proposed by
Carter et al. (2009), Jones et al. (2008) and Parsons et al. (2008)].
We have an overall 5-fold CV accuracy (Section 2) of up to
83.7%, which is better than or comparable to previous studies,
say Kaminker et al. (2007); Krishnan and Westhead (2003); Ng
and Henikoff (2001); and Yue and Moult (2006) report overall
error rate generally larger than 0.2. Other study which reports
higher accuracy than ours has applicability problem in some
cases. Speciﬁcally, the aforementioned 14 additional features
(7 of them were selected into the best 70 features, Table S1),
which were proposed by Jones et al. (2008), Parsons et al.
(2008) and Carter et al. (2009) individually, may be unavailable
for some referred mutations (see Section 2). To investigate the
role played by these additional features (14 and 7 features of

Fig. 6. ROC and PR curves calculated for previous and our proposed
method on (A) 117 EGFR and (B) 1029 TP53 missense mutations, each
with 4539 neutral polymorphisms held out of the training set

previous and our proposed feature space respectively) on the
classiﬁcation effect, we performed CV (with same folds and par-
ameter settings) with and without them on the same training set.
As expected, we generally got higher prediction accuracy with
these additional features than without them. However, our pro-
posed feature space consistently outperformed the previous in
both cases (Fig. 5).

To gain a test set, we picked out 117 EGFR and 1029 TP53
missense mutations (held out of the training data) which are
known as driver mutations for many human cancers from the
latest version of COSMIC database (v57). We compared the
performance of our method with the previous ones via ROC
and PR curves. To do this, we collected 4539 neutral variants
from the latest release of the ﬁle Humsavar.txt (see Section 2) as
passenger mutations. Figure 6 shows the ROC and PR curves
calculated for previous and our proposed method on the afore-
mentioned EGFR and TP53 driver mutations and passenger
ones. Our method is slightly superior to the previous one on
these two sets. In fact, both methods identiﬁed almost all the
drivers but ours has much higher speciﬁcity (true negative rate,
see Table 2).

However, the relevance of missense mutation of EGFR/ T P53
genes to oncogenesis has widely been veriﬁed. The possibility
that they possess signiﬁcant biochemical properties relevant to
cancer assumedly makes them easy to be identiﬁed as drivers. To
further assess the performance of our proposed method and pre-
vious ones, we test them on an extra mutation set. This extra test
dataset consists of 1113 missense mutations still culled from the
latest release of COSMIC. They should be absent from the train-
ing set and appear in at least two cancer samples (cosmic2+).
The collection of passenger mutations was compiled in a similar
manner. Figure 7 illustrates the ROC curves calculated for pre-
vious and our proposed method on the cosmic2+ driver set and
aforementioned passenger set. It can be seen from Figure 7 and

Finally, we applied the constructed classiﬁer to two published
datasets corresponding to human breast and colorectal cancers
to test its prediction capability (Sjoblom et al., 2006). The data-
sets contain 794 and 662 missense mutations of breast and colo-
rectal cancers, respectively, 642 and 502 of which can be covered
by both previous and our proposed method. Table 3 lists the
number of breast/colorectal mutations classiﬁed as drivers by
previous and our proposed method, where ‘Consensus’ refers
to the number of mutations simultaneously predicted to be dri-
vers by both methods. The number in each parenthesis represents
the total number of mutations to be classiﬁed for each case. The
details of the driver genes predicted by previous and our pro-
posed method are shown in Supplementary Figure S3.

There is a lack of straightforward way to assess which method
picked out more actual driver mutations due to the unavailability
of deﬁnite biological experiments (the original paper identiﬁed
drivers by a statistical method). Actually, this is a general
problem encountered by related researchers, as mentioned in

Fig. 8. Ontology annotations of driver genes predicted by previous and
our proposed method. Shown is the percentage of predicted driver genes
(of each cancer type) annotated with one of the three keywords: apop-
tosis, cell cycle and signaling pathway by the UniProtKB database. The
term colon refers to colorectal cancer

Section 1; see also Gonzalez-Perez and Lopez-Bigas (2011). We
hence resorted to published resources on protein sequence and
functional annotations to investigate the relevance of these mu-
tations. Concretely, we scrutinized the ontology annotations of
each predicted driver gene with respect to its biochemical proper-
ties in the UniProtKB database (Wu et al., 2006) by checking a
set of keywords appearing in the ‘KW’ domain (red rectangle in
Supplementary Fig. S1). These keywords involve biological pro-
cesses thought to be crucial for cancer progression (Hanahan and
Weinberg, 2000; Weinberg, 2006), including ‘apoptosis’, ‘cell
cycle’ and ‘signaling pathway’. Intuitively if one gene were anno-
tated with them, it more likely turns out to be a driver. As shown
in Figure 8, for both breast and colorectal cancer types, we
invariantly got higher percentages of driver genes annotated
with at least one of the three keywords.

On the other hand, our results revealed generally much fewer
driver mutations in both cancer types than previous study
(10.4% versus 16.4% for breast and 8.0% versus 11.3% for
colon, Table 3), which is more consistent with the fact that in
most cancer genomes passenger mutations take the bulk
(Stratton et al., 2009). Another evidence that supports our results
lies in three comment papers (Forrest and Cavet, 2007; Getz
et al., 2007; Rubin and Green, 2007), in which the authors
re—analyzed the data in Sjoblom et al. (2006) with corrected par-
ameters and obtained reduced number of candidate driver
mutations.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work, we dramatically enlarged the existing features used
for missense mutation classiﬁcation, and consequently improved
the prediction performance of previous classiﬁers that discrimin-
ate between driver and passenger mutations. Besides incorporat-
ing and extending existing features in relation to amino acid
properties and binary categorical features extracted from pub-
lished databases, we for the ﬁrst time, to our best knowledge,
systematically studied all kinds of SSM and investigated their
potential power in distinguishing missense mutations. In add-
ition, we are the ﬁrst to extensively explore the protein sequence
patterns instead of structural proﬁles predicted computationally.

This is justiﬁed in that protein structure prediction is largely
based on sequence alignment with proteins whose structures
are already known, hence we rationally expect less informa-
tion loss by parsing the sequences directly. Indeed, our feature se-
lection scheme conﬁrms the high performance of the SSM
and PSS features in separating driver mutations from passenger
ones.

The 5-fold CV experiments performed on a large set of train-
ing data consistently showed strong prediction capability of our
method, both in accuracy and robustness. By applying the
trained classiﬁer to several datasets of missense mutations
culled from published databases and literature, we obtained
more reasonable prediction results than previous studies (by
ROC and PR curves as well as functional relevance analysis).
Hence, our proposed novel feature extraction scheme is hoped to
signiﬁcantly improve the current work of driver mutation
identiﬁcation.

Another highlight of our work is that the feature extraction
scheme depends little on other computational software or data-
bases, which extended the applicability substantially. In prin-
ciple, given the mutation with associated protein sequence, our
system could automatically extract all the features except for the
14 additional ones as mentioned; while if the referred mutation
happens to be annotated in the UniProtKB database, then all the
126 features can be extracted without depending on any other
software or databases (although our tool only chooses the
top-ranked 70 ones for default). The reason that some data in
the classifying part cannot be covered lies in the fact that the
original paper did not provide the corresponding protein se-
quences but only a gene name/ID instead. In this case, we
have to map it to related databases to extract its protein sequence
ﬁrst. At this step, if one data use a very uncommon gene name/
ID then we cannot map it to the records in UniProtKB, even
under the help of GeneCards. Another reason of miss-covering is
we discarded the mutations at the beginning and end of a se-
quence in that windows-based amino acid residue sequence com-
position features could not handle them. In practice, such kind of
mutations with missing values can be treated as in Carter et al.
(2009).

Of note, only one of the 15 AARC features ranked within the
top 70, namely the number of hydrogen atoms of one amino
acid. This is probably because most information of the amino
acid has been already contained in the SSM features, for ex-
ample, the 42nd feature incorporates biochemical and biophys-
ical properties of amino acids to construct the WAC matrix (Wei
et al., 1997). A large part of SSM and PSS features were selected
by the DX scoring scheme, namely, 40 out of 51 and 21 out of 31
for the former and latter, respectively. What is attractive is one of
the sequence speciﬁc features LCC ranks very top—it gets the
fourth highest DX score. This again conﬁrms that PSS features
play a very signiﬁcant role on discrimination.

Our proposed method outperforms previous ones, whether or
not including the additional features (Fig. 5). However, both
methods got higher CV accuracy when including the additional
categorical features (features 98 through 111, Supplementary
Table S1). This clearly demonstrates their superior distinguishing
capability, and the superiority was further boosted by the facts
that half of this part was selected (7 out of 14) by DX score and
two features of them ranked the top 2. This is not surprising by

checking the description in Supplementary Table S2, namely,
they are annotated in the ‘FT’ domain (Supplementary Fig.
S1) as ‘MUTAGEN’ and ‘MOD_RES’ which refer to mutagenic
sites and modiﬁed residues, respectively. Intuitively, a mutation
with such features is more likely to be a deleterious substitution
or a disease-causing mutation. Considering the importance of
this part of features, we suggest that for a newly submitted mu-
tation for which the additional features are unavailable, one can
extract the remaining 63 features and leave the 7 specials (only 7
of them were selected into the ﬁnal feature set) empty, since most
of the existing software can handle the data with missing fea-
tures, for example, the SVMlight (Joachims, 1999).

Although our work rectiﬁes several shortcomings of the exist-
ing studies, further improvements are both needful and possible.
Particularly, the persistent update of related database cited in
this study is expected to improve the performance of our pro-
posed method. For example, new scoring matrix may expand the
feature space and make the classiﬁer more effective; the increas-
ing integrity of GeneCards database could improve the coverage
of our system, i.e. more mutations can be predicted in an auto-
matic sense. On the other hand, the number and signature of
driver mutations vary between cancer types. Therefore, classiﬁer
trained with data of same cancer type may be more effective to
classify mutations of that cancer. To make the training dataset
self-adaptive to a particular classiﬁcation problem will appear in
our future work.

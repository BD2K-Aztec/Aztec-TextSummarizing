ABSTRACT

Summary: GlycoPattern is Web-based bioinformatics resource to
support the analysis of glycan array data for the Consortium for
Functional Glycomics. This resource includes algorithms and tools
to discover structural motifs, a heatmap visualization to compare mul-
tiple experiments, hierarchical clustering of Glycan Binding Proteins
with respect to their binding motifs and a structural search feature on
the experimental data.

Availability and implementation: GlycoPattern is freely available on
the Web at http://g|ycopattern.emory.edu with all major browsers
supported.

1 INTRODUCTION

Glycans form complex structures since the 10 monosaccharides
found in animal glycans (Varki and Sharon, 2009) are coupled in
two possible anomeric forms (oz or ,6) and multiple glycosidic
linkages and include branched sequences unlike nucleic acids
and proteins. The number of glycans in the human glycome is
unknown but estimated to be >7000 (Cummings, 2009). The
interactions of glycans with glycan-binding proteins (GBP) are
important in many biological functions, including cell adhesion,
signaling and innate immunity, and most pathogens invade
mammalian cells and tissues via initial protein—glycan inter-
actions. Printed microarrays of deﬁned glycan structures are
interrogated with GBP detected by ﬂuorescence to determine
bound glycans. Knowing structures of glycans and the glycan
determinants within glycans that are bound or not bound by a
GBP provides valuable information about protein interaction
and speciﬁcity.

GlycoPattern is a publicly available Web-based resource that
allows investigators to analyze microarray data with the ability
to discover motifs, cluster GBPs based on binding afﬁnity to
deﬁned determinants, search the array for glycans or substruc-
ture using a text-based search, and perform a heatmap compari-
son on glycan array expression data from different experiments.
GlycanMotifMiner (Cholleti et al., 2012) is a frequent subtree
mining algorithm for motif discovery without using predeﬁned
motifs that we incorporated into GlycoPattern with other fea-
tures to help with the analysis, visualization and searching

of glycan array data. Campbell et al. (2014) describe several
glycomics databases and glycoinformatics tools, including
Glycosciences.de, UnicarbKB, GlycomeDB and Resource for
INformatics of Glycomes at Soka (RINGS). The Consortium
for Functional Glycomics (CFG) Database (Raman et al.,
2006) mentioned in the review is the only resource we are
aware of that contains Glycan Array data (among other types
of data) but it is not considered a platform for mining glycan
array data. RINGS (Akune et al., 2010) is a Web portal provid-
ing algorithmic and data mining tools to aid glycobiology re-
search that includes tools for drawing structures, mining glycan
subtrees, pathway prediction and glycan proﬁles, but is limited in
the tools available for mining across multiple glycan array ex-
periments. GlycoPattern was developed to provide broader
mining of glycan microarray data and to discover the speciﬁcity
of GBP.

2 METHODS

The current version of GlycoPattern supports only the CFG glycan array,
which reports GBP binding in relative ﬂuorescence units (RFU)
to deﬁned glycans. Users can copy and paste the average RFU values
corresponding to glycans from their experiments into GlycoPattern.
The data are sorted according to glycan number as speciﬁed on the
Mammalian Printed Arrays v4.0 through v5.1 (http://www.functionalgl
ycomics.org/static/consortium/resources/resourcecoreh8.shtml). The ap-
plication was developed using Python, HTML, J avascript, MySQL and
the Pylons Web framework.

2.1 Glycan notation

Many notations representing textual glycan nomenclature are available,
including International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)
(McNaught, 1997), Linear Notation for Unique description of
Carbohydrate Structures (LINUCS; Bohne—Lang et al., 2001), Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Chemical Function
mattori et al., 2003), LinearCode (Ehud et al., 2002), GLYDE-H
(Packer et al., 2008) and GlycoCT (Herget et al., 2008). We chose to
use the modiﬁed IUPAC condensed nomenclature from the CFG because
of the wide adoption of IUPAC in the Glycobiology community and the
inclusion of the anomeric carbon. For structure searches, GlycoPattern
can accept and display the modiﬁed IUPAC nomenclature for oligosac-
chaiides. Glycan structures are also displayed in symbols Warki and
Sharon, 2009), and we have developed J avascript code to dynamically
convert the modiﬁed IUPAC nomenclature into the symbolic represen-
tation using the HTML Canvas standard (Cabanier, 2014) without
requiring the need to store an image ﬁle on disk.

2.2 Motif discovery

A glycan array is interrogated with a GBP to determine the relative
binding strengths of all the glycans on the array (Smith et al., 2010).
The GlycanMotifMiner algorithm (Cholleti et al., 2012) functions by
automatically ﬁnding frequently occurring patterns in binding glycans.
The algorithm then incrementally discovers motifs of larger size and stops
when it cannot ﬁnd any motifs of next higher size. The algorithm uses a
threshold for the minimum number of glycans that contain the motif
along with a threshold for the maximum number of non-binding glycans
that contain the motif. Motifs are discovered and reported automatically
after data entry.

2.3 GBP-Motif hierarchical clustering

The protein—carbohydrate resource of the CFG has screened hundreds
of GBPs to determine speciﬁcity for a glycan motif or determinant.
GlycoPattern performs a hierarchical clustering from the results
of GlycanMotifMiner on any number of experiments to generate a den-
drogram showing the similarity of different GBPs for the determinant(s)
they recognize.

The GBP Dendrogram is useful for selecting GBPs to do more ﬁne-
grained analysis to determine the similarities among related GBPs, and to
rapidly screen a large database to identify reagents to detect speciﬁc
glycans.

2.4 GBP—glycan heatmap

The GBP—glycan heatmap feature allows the user to select two or more
experiments (including experiments from different CFG Array versions)
and perform a side-by—side comparison of the glycans bound by any
number of GBPs. GlycoPattern allows the user to hover over a cell in
the Heatmap and display the glycan structure in symbolic representation.
This feature allows the user to determine which features of a glycan
structure are recognized by highly similar GBPs selected using the
GBP-motif hierarchical clustering feature.

2.5 Glycan search

GlycoPattern allows users to search for glycan substructures within an
experiment. The user interface requires the use of the modiﬁed IUPAC
condensed nomenclature. The search supports hierarchical queries that
represent the branching in certain glycan sequences where branching
is noted with an opening and closing parenthesis around a sequence.
The search function parses the modiﬁed IUPAC condensed nomenclature
and converts it into Javascript Object Notation (J SON) format. When
searching for a branched input sequence, the search function ﬁnds any
match within a glycan structure for the input sequence rather than an
exact match. This is useful when dealing with sequences that have more
than two branch points from a single monosaccharide.

3 RESULTS

GlycoPattern is one of the few publicly available informatics
resources available for mining Glycan Array data. At the time
of writing, there are >50 international registered users that are
not afﬁliated with Emory University with >400 experiments
total. It was originally developed as a resource for the CFG,
but we plan to expand its capabilities beyond the CFG to
make it more accessible to the entire Glycobiology community.
In our planned future work, GlycoPattern will be adapted
to handle any deﬁned glycan library using a format such as

Glyde-II or CabosML (Kikuchi et al., 2005) to convert the struc-
tures into a GlycoPattern-readable format. Some of the authors
are members of the joint international consortium for the
Minimum Information Required for a Glycomics Experiment
Work et al., 2014) and are actively working on developing stand-
ards to represent glycan microarrays similar to the efforts of the
Minimum Information Required for a Microarray Experiment
(Spellrnan et al., 2002) and (Rayner et al., 2006). Once standards
are adopted, sharing, querying and analysis of data can be facili-
tated and will eventually lead to more maturity in the develop-
ment of bioinformatics tools for the glycobiology community.

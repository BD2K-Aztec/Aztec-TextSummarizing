ABSTRACT

Summary: Analysis of microbial genomes often requires the general
organization and comparison of tens to thousands of genomes
both from public repositories and unpublished sources. MicrobeDB
provides a foundation for such projects by the automation of
downloading published, completed bacterial and archaeal genomes
from key sources, parsing annotations of all genomes (both public
and private) into a local database, and allowing interaction with the
database through an easy to use programming interface. MicrobeDB
creates a simple to use, easy to maintain, centralized local resource
for various large-scale comparative genomic analyses and a back-
end for future microbial application design.

1 INTRODUCTION

The study of bacterial and archaeal genomes has rapidly progressed
from the analysis of single genomes to comparisons between
hundreds and thousands. Any type of biological analyses or
development of novel bioinformatic methods that uses more than
a handful of genomes requires a basic but non-trivial method for
obtaining, organizing and storing this genomic information. In the
past, this has been a problem primarily limited to large scale data
providers such as IMG (Markowitz et al., 2012), NCBI (Sayers et al.,
2011), GOLD (Pagani et al., 2011) and CMR (Davidsen et al.,
2010). Although many of these centers provide genomic data in
a variety of static formats such as Genbank and Pasta, these are
often inadequate for complex queries. To carry out these analyses
efﬁciently, a relational database such as MySQL (http://mysql.com)
can be used to allow rapid querying across many genomes at once.
Some existing data providers such as CMR allow downloading of
their database ﬁles directly, but these databases are designed for large
web-based infrastructures and contain numerous tables that demand
a steep learning curve. Also, addition of unpublished genomes to
these databases is often not supported. A well known and widely
used system is the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD)

project (http://gm0d.0rg). GMOD is an open-source project that
provides a common platform for building model organism databases
such as FlyBase (McQuilton et al., 2011) and WormBase (Yook
et al., 2011). GMOD supports a variety of options such as GBrowse
(Stein et al., 2002) and a variety of database choices including
Chado (Mungall and Emmert, 2007) and BioSQL (http://bi0sql.0rg).
GMOD provides a comprehensive system, but for many researchers
such a complex system is not needed. For example, Chado and the
simpler BioSQL schemas have over 130 and 20 database tables,
respectively. We propose a minimalistic system that is easy to set
up, requires minimal administration for automatic updates, focusing
on a lab based setting where unpublished genomes can be easily
added, and allowing individual users to work with an unchanging
snapshot of genomes from a given download date. To fulﬁll these
goals, we created MicrobeDB, an open-source project that has been
used in several comparative genome projects (H0 Sui et al., 2009;
Winstanley et al., 2009) and as a backend for previously developed
applications (Langille and Brinkman, 2009; Yu et al., 2010).

2 FEATURES

MicrobeDB offers an easy to access, manageable and centralized
database for microbial genomes. The main features of MicrobeDB
are automated downloading of archaeal and bacterial genomes from
NCBI, organized storage of the ﬂat ﬁles, annotations and genomic
metadata stored in a MySQL database, and a Perl API database for
interacting with the data. A single script (that can be scheduled to
run weekly, monthly, etc.) looks after downloading and storing new
genomes, parsing and loading the data into the MySQL database,
and cleaning up any old ‘Versions’ that have not been saved by
individual users.

2.1 Genome data source

By default all genomes available in the NCBI RefSeq database
(Pruitt et al., 2011) are downloaded using the Aspera downloader
(BeloslyudtseV, 2010). Users can optionally choose to include
incomplete genomes and/0r limit to a subset of genomes at the genera
or species level of their choice. In addition, users may download the
data in several formats beyond the standard gbk format required by
MicrobeDB such as fna, faa, gff, etc. After download, all genomes
are uncompressed into their original ﬁat ﬁles, and stored under a
date stamped central directory.

2.2 Annotation extraction and storage

The second step of each update parses annotations and metadata for
each genome and stores the information in a locally installed MySQL
database. Information is split into different levels of ‘objects’,
including Gene (e. g. accession, start position, end position, product,
name, etc.), Replicon (e. g. size, number of genes, replicon type,
etc.) and Genome Project (NCBI taxon id, NCBI genome project id,
GC%, habitat, pathogen, etc.) (Table 1). This information is obtained
from the Genbank formatted ﬁles for each genome, from metadata
tables from NCBI, or derived computationally (e.g. gene counts,
GC%, etc.) (Table 1). Additionally, a simpliﬁed version of the NCBI
taxonomy is stored for each genome and is associated with each
Genome Project object. The MicrobeDB schema is easily extended
so that users can add their own custom data ﬁelds if needed (e.g.
SNP positions, regulatory elements, etc.). The MySQL database can
be accessed using any MySQL client or through the MicrobeDB
Perl API that is supplied with MicrobeDB. The MicrobeDB Perl API
provides simple querying and retrieval of information in the MySQL
database from within the user’s own applications without having to
write actual SQL queries. In addition there are many free graphical
interfaces for interacting with MySQL databases that do not require
programming skills including web based such as phpMyAdmin
(http://phpmyadmin.net), and local desktop clients such as MySQL
Work Bench (http://www.mysql.com/products/workbenchl).

2.3 Unpublished genomes

Unpublished genomes (those not in NCBI) can be loaded into
MicrobeDB by placing their Genbank formatted ﬁles into a directory

and running a single script. MicrobeDB does not support genome
annotation or create Genbank ﬁles, but many programs are available
for production of these ﬁles such as RAST (Aziz et al., 2008) or
ARTEMIS (Carver et al., 2008). NCBI-speciﬁc metadata that is not
available for unpublished genomes is simply left as blank ﬁelds in
MicrobeDB without affecting functionality.

2.4 Stable versions of genomes

MicrobeDB keeps each update as a separate ‘Version’. This allows
users to save and work on a particular snapshot of genomes knowing
that the underlying dataset remains consistent. Each MicrobeDB
version has an associated download date and users can save a version
until their research is complete. Old unsaved versions that are no
longer needed will be automatically removed after each update is
completed to save storage space.

Overall, MicrobeDB provides support for researchers that require
a manageable local organization of bacterial and archaeal genomes
for either large comparative genome projects or for constructing new
bioinformatic applications.

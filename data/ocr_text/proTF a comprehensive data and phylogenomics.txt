ABSTRACT

Summary: Investigation of transcription factors (T F3) is of extreme
significance for gleaning more information about the mechanisms
underlying the dynamic transcriptional regulatory network. Herein,
proTF is constructed to serve as a comprehensive data resource
and phylogenomics analysis platform for prokaryotic TFs. It has
many prominent characteristics: (i) detailed annotation information,
including basic sequence features, domain organization, sequence
homolog and sequence composition, was extensively collected, and
then visually displayed for each TF entry in all prokaryotic genomes;
(ii) workset was employed as the basic frame to provide an efficient
way to organize the retrieved data and save intermediate records;
and (iii) a number of elaborated tools for phylogenomics analysis were
implemented to investigate the evolutionary roles of specific TFs. In
conclusion, proTF dedicates to the prokaryotic TFs with integrated
multi-function, which will become a valuable resource for prokaryotic
transcriptional regulatory network in the post-genomic era.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identiﬁcation, classiﬁcation and phylogenomics analysis of
transcription factors (TFs) within or among speciﬁc organisms
can help us to highlight how they evolutionarily conserved or
diverse in order to ﬁt in the ever-changing environment effectively
(Rodionov, 2007). In the past decade, a number of specialized TF
databases were established. The TRANSFAC and DBD databases
were released as a universal data source covering putative TFs for all
completely sequenced genomes and TrSDB contains the TFs derived
from nine eukaryotic species (Hermoso et al., 2004; Wilson et al.,
2008; Wingender, 2008). Within the plant kingdom, progressively
integrated and comprehensively annotated biological databases had

been constructed, such as plantTFDB (Guo et al., 2008), DPTF
(Zhu et al., 2007), RARTF (Iida et al., 2005), PlanTAPDB (Richardt
et al., 2007), TOBFAC (Rushton et al., 2008), DATFAP (Fredslund,
2008), GRASSIUS (Yilmaz et al., 2009) and PlnTFDB (Perez—
Rodriguez et al., 2009). Various information of TFs in animal are
abundantly explored by databases such as TFcat (Fulton et al., 2009),
Tde (Kanamori et al., 2004), FlyTF (Pfreundt et al., 2009) and ITFP
(Zheng et al., 2008). In addition, fungal TFs can be accessed from
FTFD (Park et al., 2008). Up to now, however, no comprehensive
platform for computational repository is available to provide access
to the large complete sets of prokaryotic TFs. RegTransBase is a
database of regulatory interactions in prokaryotes, which captures
the knowledge in public scientiﬁc literature and contains 1131 TFs in
the latest version (Kazakov et al., 2007). ooTFD is a database aimed
at capturing information regarding the polypeptide interactions,
which comprise and deﬁne the properties of TFs with limited species
and TF entries (Ghosh, 2000). ExtraTrain provides integrated and
easily manageable information for 679 816 extragenic regions and
for the genes delimiting each of them. For TF, it only contains 16 TF
families (Pareja et al., 2006). In addition, the currently developed
AraC—XylS only holds information about TF family AraC in bacteria
and the BacTregulators contains three TF families (TetR, AraC and
IclR) in bacteria and archaea (Martinez-Bueno et al., 2004; Tobes
and Ramos, 2002). DBTBS (Sierro et al., 2008), RegulonDB (Huerta
et al., 1998), TRACTOR_DB (Perez et al., 2007), cTFbase (Wu
et al., 2007) and ArchaeaTF (Wu et al., 2008) only aim to focus on
the TFs in Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, gamma-proteobacteria,
cyanobacteria and archaea, respectively.

Herein, a new TF database proTF is constructed to provide an
integrated useful resource for TFs research and facilitate further
investigation of transcriptional regulatory network in prokaryotes.
In comparison with other comprehensive TF databases, proTF
contains the following prominent characteristics: (i) offered an
extensively detailed annotation information of each TF entry in
all the completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes; (ii) employed
the workset as the basic frame to well organize the retrieved data
and save intermediate records; and (iii) implemented a number of
phylogenomics analysis tools to investigate the evolutionary roles
of speciﬁc TFs in or across different prokaryotic organisms. In
conclusion, proTF is dedicates to the prokaryotic TFs with multiple
integrated phylogenomics function.

2 IDENTIFICATION AND ANNOTATION OF TFs

To identify complete putative set of TFs in a given prokaryotic
genome, our previously well-established analysis pipelines in
cTFbase (Wu et al., 2007) and ArchaeaTF (Wu et al., 2008)
were applied to all the fully sequenced proteomes of prokaryotic
species available from KEGG. In brief, we start with the
collection of a set of well-characterized/putative TFs from Swiss-
Prot/TrEMBL databases (release 15.12) and a number of HMM
proﬁles corresponding to DNA—binding domains (DBDs) from Pfam
(version 24.0) and SUPERFAMILY (release 1.73). A combination
of BLAST-based and HMM-based search was adopted to obtain
signiﬁcant hits using the BLASTP and hmmpfam program with
an E-Value of 1e-10 and 0.01, respectively. All the identiﬁed TFs
were classiﬁed into different families according to categories of their
DBDs.

Once a putative TF was identiﬁed and classiﬁed, it was
extensively annotated using a number of bioinformatics tools
and databases. Particularly, the molecular weight and isoelectric
point of a given TF was identiﬁed using the PepStat program
implemented in the EMBOSS package (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
emboss). The InterProScan program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/
InterProScanl) was used to search its domain architectures. The
Gene Ontology terms were obtained from the InterProScan results
using InterPr02G0 (http://www.geneontology.org/external2g0/
interpr02g0). Sequence similarity alignment was performed using
the BLAST program against several major databases, including
PDB (http://www.pdb.org/), Uniprot (http://www.unipr0t.0rg/),
KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/genes.html), Swissprot (http://
www.expasy.ch/sprotl) and Refseq (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0V/
refseql).

3 WEB INTERFACE

proTF is a relational database hosts on an Apache HTTP server
running on Linux operating system. Various separate MySQL
database tables are retrieved by the Structure Query Language.
PHP is implemented for the connection of database and dynamic
production of user-friendly HTML front-end queries. The web
interface is organized in an operating system-independent way,
which has been tested to work properly in Internet Explorer 7.0,
Firefox 2/3 and Opera 10.00 browsers.

proTF presents a user-friendly web interface for researchers
to store and interrogate all the putative TFs entries. Users can
easily access the data by clicking a speciﬁc TF family or the
species in the browse page. In the search page, a multi-layered
query system is employed for users to retrieve the data based on
hierarchized keywords. The search can be performed Via locus tag,
family or species. Expression in separate ﬁelds can be combined
with the logical operator AND, OR or NOT. The list of registered
species is also arranged hierarchically according to taxonomy
to allow users to easily access the TF entry. In BLAST-based
search page, the BLAST program (http://indra.mullins.microbiol
.washington.edu/blast/Viroblast.php) is implemented to enable the
identiﬁcation of the homologs of the query sequences stored in
proTF. Either the full—length or the DBD region of the TF sequences
can be taken as database to perform BLAST search. In addition,
a number of advanced parameters (such as E-Value, matrix and
species) were also provided to allow users to perform more speciﬁc

BLAST searches. In the result table, basic information of each TF
entry matching the query will be listed in a table, in which gene IDs
and family IDs are linked to the detailed annotation of the gene and
family. By clicking on the entries, detailed annotation information
will be displayed, including basic sequence features, Gene Ontology
terms, gene domain organization and sequence homolog to other
relevant databases.

4 WORKSET AND PHYLOGENOMIC ANALYSIS

Workset, incorporated into proTF, is a signiﬁcant functionality
of having the TF genes and families well organized and
conducting a succession of phylogenomics analyses to investigate
the evolutionary relationship of speciﬁc TF family. Using workset,
users can append, remove and conﬁgure any retrieved results for
further data manipulation, comparative genomics and molecular
evolution analysis. Each workset is assigned with a speciﬁc ID either
generated by the server randomly or named by users themselves. It is
available to customize all the data in the workset through appending
or deleting the items. Moreover, a saved workset can be loaded again
by its corresponding ID to avoid rehandling the retrieved results.

Another prominent feature of proTF is that it can also serve as
a comparative genomics and molecular evolution analysis platform
for prokaryotic TFs. A number of phylogenomics analysis tools are
implemented to allow users to investigate a particular TF within
one prokaryotic genome or a bunch of TFs across different ones,
as well as the TFs items are stored in the workset. Particularly, the
ClustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) and MUSCLE program
(http://www.drive5.com/musclel) were employed to performing
multiple sequence alignment for the whole TF sequences or just
the DBD sequences of TFs at amino acid or DNA level. Multiple
sequence alignment result was graphically displayed using the
J alView program (http://www. j alView.0rg/). The QuickTree program
(http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/quicktreel) helps users
to investigate the evolutionary relationship of TF items stored in the
workset. The reliability of the phylogenetic tree can be evaluated
by the bootstrap method with replications (at default 100) and the
tree is Visualized using the ATV program (http://www.phylos0ft.org/
atV/).

5 PERSPECTIVES

Currently, proTF provided a complete list of centralized putative
prokaryotes TFs. It has contained a number of 127 838 TFs from
841 prokaryotic organisms. In future, more prokaryotes TFs from
sequenced organisms will be added into the platform to extend its
functionality. These existing entries will be updated to keep up with
the latest annotation information in linked databases. We believe that
the platform will provide a wealth of information and more robust
and reliable support for the scientiﬁc community to decipher and
gain the complete picture of the genetic regulatory networks.

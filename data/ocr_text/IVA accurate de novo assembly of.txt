Abstract

Motivation: An accurate genome assembly from short read sequencing data is critical for down-
stream analysis, for example allowing investigation of variants within a sequenced population.
However, assembling sequencing data from virus samples, especially RNA viruses, into a genome
sequence is challenging due to the combination of viral population diversity and extremely uneven
read depth caused by amplification bias in the inevitable reverse transcription and polymerase
chain reaction amplification process of current methods.

Results: We developed a new de novo assembler called IVA (Iterative Virus Assembler) designed
specifically for read pairs sequenced at highly variable depth from RNA virus samples. We tested
IVA on datasets from 140 sequenced samples from human immunodeficiency virus-1 or influenza-
virus-infected people and demonstrated that IVA outperforms all other virus de novo assemblers.

1 Introduction

The main challenge of assembling sequence data from an RNA virus
sample into a consensus sequence lies in the extremely variable read
depth from current sequencing approaches combined with the exten-
sive viral population diversity. An example is shown in Figure 1
where regions of the genome are represented with different read
depths, caused by the separate reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction amplification of overlapping regions of the genome
before library preparation. Further, there is a relatively high rate of
single base differences in the reads throughout the genome. These
properties of the data cause standard assembly algorithms to

produce multiple contigs covering the same region and, more signifi-
cantly, miss regions of the genome entirely (Yang et al., 2012).
Despite the availability of at least 40 genome assemblers (http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_assembly), VICUNA (Yang et al.,
2012) and PRICE (Ruby et al., 2013) are currently the only assem-
blers designed for virus data. VICUNA tackles the assembly problem
by first clustering the reads that should belong to the same contig,
using min hashes to infer similarity. Contigs are generated and then
merged to form the final output. PRICE begins with seed sequences,
which are iteratively extended by generating new sequence from
local assemblies of reads at contig ends. In addition, the RNA-seq

assembler Trinity (Grabherr et al., 2011) has been used to assemble
virus data because it can handle irregular read depth. Trinity con-
structs de Bruijn graphs from clusters of the reads, then resolves
each cluster into transcripts by tracing reads and their mates through
the graphs.

Our approach is similar to that of PRICE, except we extend con-
tigs more conservatively using consensus kmers from the reads in-
stead of using local assemblies. Also our new assembler, called IVA
(Iterative Virus Assembler), is a completely de novo assembler,
whereas PRICE must be provided with seed sequences to be ex-
tended into contigs.

2 Methods

A ﬂowchart describing the assembly process is shown in
Supplementary Figure 51 and full details are in the Supplementary
Material. Before assembling, adapter sequences are removed from
the reads using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014), followed by the
trimming of polymerase chain reaction primer sequences.

After trimming the reads, the most abundant kmer among the
reads is found using kmc (Deorowicz et al., 2013). This short seed
kmer is iteratively extended into a contig using reads that have a per-
fect match to that kmer, treating the reads as unpaired. A list of all
possible extension sequences is made (one sequence per overhanging
read). IVA identifies the kmer of length k among prefixes of the pos-
sible extension sequences, for largest possible k, such that the kmer
appears at least 10 times and is at least four times as abundant as
the next most common kmer of length k. In this way, the seed is it-
eratively extended until its length reaches the insert size of the read
pairs.

Contigs are extended in a similar manner to that of seed kmers.
Instead of using perfect string matches, reads are mapped to the con-
tigs with SMALT (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/
smaltl). During mapping, IVA also uses SAMtools (Li et al., 2009).

differences per mapped read compared to the IVA contig, the read depth and

Table 1. Summary of assembly QC results

Reads mapped as part of a perfect pair (in the correct orientation
and separated by the correct distance) and hang off a contig end are
used to extend the contig. The sequence added to a contig end is
constructed using the method described above for kmer extensions.

When no more contigs can be extended, they are cleaned as fol-
lows before generating a new seed. Contig ends are trimmed for
quality, and overlapping contigs are merged based on sequence simi-
larity found at their ends using nucmer (Kurtz et al., 2004).
Assembly stops either when a pre-defined maximum contig number
is reached or no new seeds can be made.

3 Results

We evaluated IVA, PRICE, Trinity and VICUNA with different
parameters on Illumina paired reads from 42 human immunodefi-
ciency virus 1 (HIV-1) samples and 98 Influenza A and B virus
samples. See the Supplementary Material for the full analysis. To
compare the assemblies for each sample, we picked the closest ref-
erence from a pool of genomes using Kraken (Wood and Salzberg,
2014). For the accession numbers and complete evaluation proced-
ure, see the Supplementary Material. We generated quality metrics
using (i) nucmer to compare contigs with a reference genome, (ii)
GAGE (Salzberg et al., 2012) analysis code and (iii) RATT (Otto
et al., 2011) to transfer annotation from the reference to the
assembly.

The ideal assembler output is defined as one contig for HIV-1, or
exactly one contig for each Influenza virus genome segment, with
the expected length compared to the closest reference and no dupli-
cation. IVA generated ideal assemblies for 57% of the HIV samples
and 21 % of the Influenza virus samples (Table 1 and Supplementary
Tables 51 and 52), significantly more than the other assemblers.
These low numbers are generally due to contigs of incorrect length
(Fig. 2a) or duplications in the assemblies (Fig. 2b, Supplementary
Figs S2 and S3, Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 51 and 52). IVA
had the smallest variation in these results, especially for the
Inﬂuenza virus samples (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs S2 and S3,
Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 51 and 52). The proportion of
each reference genome assembled into contigs was 89.8-98.3% for
HIV-1. The corresponding values for Inﬂuenza virus ranged from
89.8 (PRICE) to 98.8% (IVA). The mean per cent of HIV-1 annota-
tion features transferred by RATT from IVA assemblies was 99.0%
on both HIV-1 and Inﬂuenza virus samples. This was more than the
other assemblers, except VICUNA with alternative settings that
achieved 99.2% mean annotation transfer, at the expense of a dupli-
cation rate more than double that of IVA (Supplementary Table 51).
There were few assembly errors—Trinity produced none, and IVA
and VICUNA made one error each. The typical run time was under
10 h and none of the assemblers had excessive memory requirements

ples but was comparable to PRICE and faster than VICUNA on the
Inﬂuenza virus data.

4 Discussion

Considering the number of ideal assemblies produced by the
available tools, it can be seen that assembling RNA virus genomes is
challenging. However, IVA was consistently better at producing
single sequences representing the consensus sequence of each virus
population, especially on the Influenza virus data. In contrast, the
other tools tended to either produce multiple copies of parts
of each genome or miss entire regions from their output. In
summary, we developed IVA specifically to assemble short read
sequencing data from RNA virus samples and have shown that it
produces significantly higher quality assemblies than existing
approaches.

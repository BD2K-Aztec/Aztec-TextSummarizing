ABSTRACT

Summary: At the heart of many modern biotechnological and thera-
peutic applications lies the need to target specific genomic loci with
pinpoint accuracy. Although landmark experiments demonstrate
technological maturity in manufacturing and delivering genetic mater-
ial, the genomic sequence analysis to find suitable targets lags behind.
We provide a computational aid for the sophisticated design of se-
quence-specific ligands and selection of appropriate targets, taking
gene location and genomic architecture into account.

1 INTRODUCTION

Targeting genomic loci with high accuracy is essential for
modern molecular biology, such as for insertion of genetically
engineered material into genomes. Recent publications demon-
strate the maturity of techniques using triplex-forming peptide
nucleic acids (PNAs) for accurate, sequence-speciﬁc gene target-
ing. Chin et a]. (2008) apply PNAs in conjunction with donor
DNA to introduce heritable gene modiﬁcation and Rogers et a].
(2012) improve the delivery by linking the antennapedia trans-
port peptide (Antp) to the PNA to enable its transfer into the cell
nucleus after systemic administration of the compound.

In contrast to these biotechnological achievements, the deter-
mination of genomic targets that can be accurately targeted has
been hampered by the lack of dedicated computational tools able
to jointly optimize the choice of the target site and the design of
the delivery molecule (e. g. PNA) such that the number of pos-
sible collateral binding sites (off-targets) is minimized. Although
Rogers et a]. (2012) were able to demonstrate site speciﬁcity by
determining that the PNA—Antp conjugate did not alter the
nearby control gene 611, which contains a potential triplex
target site whose sequence diﬂers from that of the intended

target, they acknowledged the possibility of PNA binding occur-
ring at other genomic locations that have sequences similar to the
target. The extent to which applications of PNA-based delivery
may be hampered by a non-optimal target choice is demon-
strated by the fact that the sequence chosen by Rogers et a].
(2012) has almost 20000 identical copies across the mouse
genome, making off-target binding a near certainty. The intro-
duction of genetic material at any of these loci, but especially at
the 469 sites that are located within exons, would have unpre-
dictable (and probably undesirable) consequences.

This illustrates the need for a computational aid that takes
triplex-speciﬁc design features into account. Triplex formation
of conventional oligonucleotides relies on hydrogen-bonding of
the third strand in the major groove of the genomic DNA target
and potential in vivo roles of triplexes are reviewed in Buske et a].
(2011). In contrast, PNA-based targeting, as used by Chin et a].
(2008) and Rogers et a]. (2012), depends on strand invasion re-
sulting in a PNAzDNA-PNA triple-helix with a looped-out DNA
strand. The peptide backbone provides enhanced resistance to
nucleases, and PNAs show an increased afﬁnity for DNA com-
pared with oligonucleotides (Egholm et al., 1993). The target
site consists, in either case, of a sequence of consecutive purines
that provide the hydrogen donor and acceptor groups that sta-
bilize the triple-helix. Suitable genomic targets thus exhibit a
dominant polypurine-polypyrimidine characteristic (poly-
R-poly-Y).

2 DESCRIPTION OF TRIPLEX-INSPECTOR

Triplex-Inspector is a computational tool for sequence-speciﬁc
ligand design and appropriate target selection to increase the
accuracy of triplex-based genomic manipulations. The software
takes a genomic locus of interest and searches for all putative
triplex target sites, leveraging our exhaustive search algorithm
Triplexator (Buske et al., 2012). Each of these putative targets
is subsequently examined for their uniqueness by searching the
genome for any locus with high-sequence similarity to them (illu-
strated in Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. 81). Although we do
not present any experimental validation, we demonstrate that
Triplex-Inspector greatly facilitates avoiding targets that are
clearly sub-optimal because of the presence of (near-) perfect
off-targets.

histogram shows off-target risk of individual positions for the region of interest (SubFGl), whereas inner tiles show putative target sites and their
genome-wide copy number. Feature-annotated (e. g. chromatin accessibility and exons) outer chromosome slices show off-target abundance pooled for

all same-length primary targets

The user can separately customize the parameters (e.g. length
and mismatch-rate) used in the target site search and uniqueness
assessment. Off-targets with high similarity to the target site (high-
risk off-targets) can be detected by using the same parameter set-
ting used during the target site search. Relaxing the off-target
search criteria allows the detection of less similar (e.g. shorter)
off-target sites, giving a more complete picture of the overall
risk for cellular toxicity and other unintended consequences.

Off-target sites need to be assessed in their genomic context.
For example, off-targets located in exons might be considered
more hazardous than occurrences in gene deserts. Triplex-
Inspector allows interactive ﬁltering of relevant target sites
based on gene annotation data. The target-ligand design can
be further optimized by taking chromatin organization into ac-
count. Triplex-Inspector allows DNase I hypersensitivity data to
be used to highlight genomic regions where off-target binding
is more likely (or less likely) because of chromatin accessibility
(or inaccessibility).

A single set of criteria for choosing the optimal triplex target
site in any given application does not currently exist. Manual,
interactive data inspection is, therefore, essential. Triplex-
Inspector aggregates all results into an interactive web browser
application allowing intuitive data manipulation and visualiza-
tion that can be shared across different platforms. Triplex-
Inspector optionally generates a circos plot (Krzywinski et al.,
2009) for each target site cluster that allows the user to visually
assess its properties (Fig. 1B). Once the user has identiﬁed a
target with acceptable off-target risk, Triplex-Inspector outputs
the sequences of matching ligands based on the model of Vekhoff
et al. (2008). A comparison of Triplex-Inspector to existing tools
is available in the Supplementary File.

3 DEMONSTRATING THE BENEFIT OF USING
A COMPUTATIONALLY GUIDED DESIGN
PROCESS

We identify a target for the supFGl reporter construct with sub-

stantially fewer off-targets than the 18 826 sequence copies of the
heuristically chosen 10 nt target site used by Rogers et al. (2012).

To ﬁnd this more suitable target, we use Triplex-Inspector to
examine the 30 nt poly-R-poly-Y region in the supFGl construct
for any subsequence of at least 10 nt that qualiﬁes as target under
the binding model from Rogers et al. (2012). Leveraging the
software’s ability to ﬁnd all off-targets for every candidate
target site, we ﬁnd a 10 nt site located 2nt downstream of the
heuristically chosen target that has about half as many exact
copies in the genome.

An optimal target would be unique in the genome and long
enough to bind the matching ligand effectively. The ligand
should also not contain any subsequences that could bind to
off-targets. For example, the 30 nt poly-R-poly-Y region in the
supFGl construct is unique in the mouse genome, but Triplex-
Inspector ﬁnds that it contains subsequences of length 2 10 nt
that match >100 000 off-target sites. These problematic subse-
quences are found mainly in the right side of the region (18—30 nt,
Fig. 1B).

Introducing a strategic mismatch at positions that engage the
most in off-target binding, e.g. positions 7 and 24 (Fig. 1B,
marked with an asterisk), is likely to disrupt the binding stability
of shorter subsequences and, therefore, reduces off-target effects.
As the optimal balance between uniqueness and off-target risk,
Triplex-Inspector identiﬁes a 23 nt subsequence (2—25), which is
the shortest unique sequence with no equally stable Ojftarget (as
deﬁned by the number of nucleotide triads formed in the triplex).
Tolerating non-exonic off-targets reduces the length requirement
to 20 nt (424) with a total of 38 copies across the genome of
which 18 are located in introns. If TFOs can be administered to
target cells in a (liver) tissue-speciﬁc way, then the number of off-
targets, which are accessible based on DNase I hypersensitivity
data, drops to two. See the Supplementary File for additional
examples targeting biologically important loci.

In conclusion, the achievable speciﬁcity of gene targeting is
governed by the choice of the primary target site. The ligand
design process needs to identify potential off-targets and assess
their risk on the basis of their sequence, accessibility and prox-
imity to functional elements. Computational tools are required
to process this information optimally and supersede heuristic
decision making. Triplex-Inspector addresses this need and aids

ABSTRACT

Summary: Emerging evidence has revealed phased siRNAs
(phasiRNAs) as important endogenous regulators in plants.
However, the integrated prediction tools for phasiRNAs are still limited.
In this article, we introduce a stand-alone package PhaseTank for
systematically characterizing phasiRNAs and their regulatory net-
works. (i) It can identify phasiRNAs/tasiRNAs functional cascades
(miRNA/phasiRNA—>PHAS loci—>phasiRNA—>target) with high sensi-
tivity and specificity. (ii) By one command analysis, it generates com-
prehensive annotation and quantification of the predicted PHAS genes
from any given sequences. (iii) PhaseTank has no restriction with re-
gards to prior information of sequence homology of unrestricted or-
ganism origins.

Availability and implementation: PhaseTank is a free and open-
source tool. The package is available at http://phasetank.source-
forge.net/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Secondary phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs) play crucial roles in
post-transcriptional regulatory networks in plants (Fei et al.,
2013). Well-characterized trans-acting siRNAs, as a special sub-
group of phasiRNAs, are initiated by miRNA-mediated cleavage
and converted to dsRNA, yielding siRNAs in a 21-nt phase
(Allen and Howell, 2010; Axtell, 2013a; Fei et al., 2013).
Currently, eight T AS loci have been identiﬁed in Arabidopsis,
and T A53 is experimentally validated to suppress the juvenile-
to-adult transition (Hunter et al., 2006). Moreover, phasiRNA-
mediated regulation of NB—LRR encoding disease-resistance
proteins appears to be widespread in dicots (Zhai et al., 2011).
However, the signiﬁcance and broad roles of phasiRNAs remain
unclear in plants (Fei et al., 2013).

Next-generation sequencing technology provides a powerful
tool for genome-wide screening of phasiRNAs Wang et al.,
2009), and several methods were proposed correspondingly
(Axtell, 2010, 2013b; Chen et al., 2007; Gupta et al., 2012; Li
et al., 2012). However, no methods could systematically identify
phasiRNAs and their regulatory cascades, and none reports the

detailed annotation and quantiﬁcation of candidate PHAS loci
(Fei et al., 2013).

In this study, we present a novel tool PhaseTank to identify
PHAS loci, which contains our new sights and also incorporates
the advantages of the previous methods. We propose that the
relative small RNAs production (RSRP) of PHAS loci is higher
than that of the transcripts processed by random cleavage, inas-
much as the PHAS loci should generate considerable
phasiRNAs to maintain their biological functions (Allen et al.,
2005). In our method, the phased ratio, abundance and number
of a phasiRNA cluster are considered as three main contributors
to score a candidate PHAS loci. Additionally, PhaseTank could
detect both triggered miRNAs and phasiRNA targets for pre-
dicted PHAS loci. Therefore, PhaseTank employs a new ﬁlter
and scoring system to perform de novo prediction of PHAS loci
and their regulatory cascades on a genome-wide scale.

2 APPROACH

2.1 Computing RSRP

The RSRP of a sequence is calculated as the following steps.
First, we calculate the small RNAs production of sequence 1'
(SRP,) using Equation (1).

SRPi=Ai/Li (1)

where A,- is the abundance of mapped reads onto sequence i, and
L,- is the length of the sequence 1'. Second, RSRP,- is computed as
Equation (2):

RSRP, = In L (2)

 1 SRP,

where N is the total number of the sequences.

2.2 Deﬁnition of siRNA and phasiRNA clusters

The siRNA cluster is referred to the genomic region that contains
at least four sRNA hits with a maximum separation distance of
100-nt (Supplementary Fig. S1) (Johnson et al., 2009). Similarly,
we deﬁne phasiRNA cluster as a speciﬁc region that contains at
least four phased reads with a maximum separation distance of
84-nt. To set the phasiRNA cluster, every position in a given
sequence is successively assigned as a ‘2l-bin cycle’ (Axtell,
2010) (Supplementary Fig. S2). We then search for the most

abundant bin and the 2l-nt reads mapped to this bin. These
reads are used to search phasiRNA clusters.

2.3 Computing phased score

Phased score is the core indicator in PhaseTank, and it consists
of three main factors, namely, phased ratio, number and abun-
dance. Larger phased score of a sequence indicates higher pos-
sibility that it will be a true PHAS gene. Speciﬁcally, in a
phasiRNA cluster, phased ratio is the abundance of the highest
abundant bin_x divided by the total abundance (Axtell, 2010).
Phase drift for 1 ~ 2 position(s) is considered if the second abun-
dant bin is bin _y (y = x:l: l or 2). Phased number is the distinct
number of 2l-nt phased reads, and the abundance of these reads
represents phased abundance. The phased score for each
phasiRNA cluster is calculated as Equation (3):

P_Score = P_Rati0 >l< P_Number >l< ln (PAbundcmce) (3)

where P is the abbreviation of ‘phased’.

2.4 Searching triggered miRNAs

MiRNA-directed T AS loci cleavage often occurs at 9—1 lnt pos-
itions from the 5’ terminal (Allen and Howell, 2010). According
to the prediction results of CleaveLand4 (Addo-Quaye et al.,
2009), one miRNA is deﬁned as a phase-trigger, if its cleavage
site occurs almost at the phased positions (one position shift).

3 WORKFLOW AND IMPLEMENTATION

The workﬁow of PhaseTank is illustrated in Supplementary
Figure S3. First, the reads are mapped to the references using
bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009). Then PhaseTank excises siRNA
clusters based on the mapping information and keeps the clusters
with top 5% RSRP value. For these clusters, PhaseTank
searches the most abundant bin as phased sites. The
phasiRNA clusters are excised accordingly from these sites and
then processed into the ﬁltering system. The phased score of the
ﬁltered clusters are then computed as Equation (3). By setting
advanced options, PhaseTank can predict miRNA-mediated
cleavage and phasiRNA targets using CleaveLand4 (Addo-
Quaye et al., 2009). Finally, the phasiRNA cascades of each
predicted PHAS gene are reported in a text ﬁle.

PhaseTank is written in Perl (5.8 or later versions), and has
been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and Fedora 17. To run it, users
should properly install the software, such as bowtie (Langmead
et al., 2009), samtools (Li et al., 2009), RNAplex (Tafer
and Hofacker, 2008), MathzzCDF and R (see http://phasetank.
sourceforge.net/).

4 RESULTS

The RSRP values of the Arabidopsis transcripts are shown in
Supplementary Figure S4. Consequently, the RSRP values of
the known 22 PHAS loci ranked top 1539 of the 41391 tran-
scripts. Herein PhaseTank processes clusters with the top 5%
RSRP value for further prediction.

We found that 22 PHAS genes reported by previous studies
(Chen et al., 2007; Howell et al., 2007) were supported by the
reads libraries (Supplementary Table S5). PhaseTank was then
performed in Arabidopsis, with 21 and 18 PHAS genes being
detected using genome and cDNA data, respectively, including
all eight known T AS loci (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). To
estimate the sensitivity, PhaseTank was compared with the recent
published software ShortStack (Axtell, 2013b) in different tissues
using cDNA sequences of Arabidopsis. Evidently, the average
sensitivity of PhaseTank (77.90%) was signiﬁcantly higher than
that of ShortStack (26.92%) (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table
S8). Meanwhile, the sensitivity of PhaseTank reached 95.45%
with the use of genome sequence, whereas that of ShortStack
was only 54.54% (Fig. 1B, Table 1, Supplementary Tables S6
and S9). Moreover, we selected 210 other annotated ncRNAs as
true negatives to assess the speciﬁcity of the two programs
(Supplementary Table S5). Among the ncRNAs, 2 and 17 were
predicted as PHAS genes by PhaseTank and ShortStack, respect-
ively, with corresponding 99.04% and 91.04% speciﬁcity (Table
l and Supplementary Table S5). The comparisons of other char-
acteristics of both tools are listed in Table 1. Moreover,
PhaseTank also identiﬁed a rarely reported miR393b triggered
cascades (Fig. 1C) (Si-Ammour et al., 2011).

We further tested PhaseTank in tomato (Solanam lycopersi—
cam) using the genome data as well. Among the 19 reported
tomato PHAS genes (Shivaprasad et al., 2012), PhaseTank was
able to detect 13 of them (Supplementary Table S10).
Furthermore, PhaseTank also discovered 10 miRNA-initiated
cascades in tomato (Supplementary Fig. S11), and two of
which have been reported by Shivaprasad et al. (2012).

5 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, our results demonstrate that PhaseTank is an ef-
fective and highly applicable tool for comprehensive annotation
and quantiﬁcation of regulatory cascades involved in phasiRNA
pathways. Therefore, PhaseTank would help to elucidate the
function and evolution of this special class of small RNAs in
land plants.

ABSTRACT

Summary: We developed new software environment for the metabo-
lome analysis of large-scale multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assays.
It supports the data format of four major mass spectrometer vendors
and szL common data format. This program provides a process
pipeline from the raw-format import to high-dimensional statistical ana-
lyses. The novel aspect is graphical user interface-based visualization to
perform peak quantification, to interpolate missing values and to nor-
malize peaks interactively based on quality control samples. Together
with the software platform, the MRM standard library of 301 metabolites
with 775 transitions is also available, which contributes to the reliable
peak identification by using retention time and ion abundances.
Availability and implementation: MRMPROBS is available for
Windows OS under the creative-commons by-attribution license at

1 INTRODUCTION

Many metabolomics studies rely on the “large-scale’ multiple
reaction monitoring (MRM) assay. Wide-targeted analysis is
an example; >1000 MRM transitions (precursor—product ion
pairs) are monitored per single run using high-end machines.
For MRM assays, we previously reported an objective strategy
for metabolite identification from large-scale chromatographic
data (Tsugawa et al., 2013). This report highlights its recent fea-
tures, especially new algorithms for peak detection, normaliza-
tion, and their new graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

Peak quantification is the most important and sensitive process
during MRM assays. There is no inherent universal algorithm that
can perfectly recognize peak edges because they depend on chro-
matographic conditions; each research group has its own criteria
for recognition (Sugimoto et al., 2012). For the accurate detection
of peak-left and peak-right edges, in practice, multiple chromato-
grams must be checked and compared using a visualization tool.
This process is also necessary to avoid misidentifications. For this
purpose, we developed an interactive chromatogram viewer that

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

can overlay multiple chromatograms in each window to visualize
our peak detection algorithm (Fig. 1). Moreover, it can interpolate
missing values (Supplementary Information), and it can adjust
signal changes or metabolite-dependent drifts using locally
weighted least-square regression (locally estimated smoothing func-
tion, LOESS) and cubic spline with quality control (QC) samples.

Together with these features, standard MRM measurements
were made available on the PRIMe (Platform for RIKEN
Metabolomics) Web site (http://prime.psc.riken.jp) for 301 me-
tabolites (755 transitions); their precursor—product ion pairs, re-
tention time and ion abundances are provided. The retention
time and ion abundances are particularly useful for the accurate
identiﬁcation of metabolites because these features are compar-
able across certain instrument types (Kind et al., 2013) as long as
the experimental conditions are similar. The algorithmic high-
lights are introduced below.

2 PEAK DETECTION AND VISUALIZATION

The peak detection algorithm is fully refurbished. On scanning a
given chromatogram, three median values are computed to evalu-
ate noise: AF for the amplitude, FF for the ﬁrst-order derivative
and SF for the second-order derivative. The scan detects the max-
imum amplitude differences between two adjacent points and the
maxima of the first- and second-order derivatives at each point. The
derivatives are calculated by using the ﬁve-point cubic Savitzky-
Golay ﬁlter (Savitzky et al., 1964). Only values below 5% of the
maximum are applied to compute their medians, i.e. AF, FF and
SF. When a computed median is near zero, 0.0001 is used instead.

Peaks are detected by their AF, FF and SF. The left edge is
recognized when the amplitude and the first-order derivative both
exceed AF and FF in two adjacent points. To locate the edge more
accurately, the local minimum of the adjacent five-point window is
explored by back-tracking from the detected start position. The tip
of the peak is recognized when the sign of the ﬁrst-order derivative
changes and the second-order derivative is less than SF. The right
edge is recognized by the same criteria as the left edge.

When ‘peak area’ is used for quantification, manual curation
is necessary to adjust the peak edges. This manual process may
be skipped if ‘peak height’ is used instead; however, visualization
continues to be necessary for verification. The system can sim-
ultaneously display up to 15 MRM chromatograms from desig-
nated file sets or metabolites in each single window (Fig. 1).

This drawing style facilitates the speedy checking of the peak-
picking results and the curation of the peak-left and peak-right
edges. It also helps to locate misidentiﬁcation.

3 QC SAMPLE-BASED NORMALIZATION

In long-term studies, a QC sample, or the standard, is necessary
for normalizing the signal intensity. A mixture of all subject
samples can serve this purpose (Dunn et al., 2011). Our software
uses the LOESS and the cubic spline for normalization. In our
program, measurement data are iteratively ﬁt to the preselected
standard by the LOESS of the second-degree least-squares with a
robust tri-cubic weight function (Cleveland et al., 1979). After
the ﬁt, a correction curve for the whole analytical run is inter-
polated by the cubic spline. Lastly, the entire dataset is aligned to
the spline result. This procedure adjusts the attenuation of the
peak response over an analytical run (Fig. 2).

4 DATA IMPORT AND EXPORT

As in our previous work (Tsugawa et al., 2013), we used a
common ﬁle format (ABF format; Reifycs Inc.) for rapid data
retrieval for efﬁcient data access to MRM data. To convert
MRM raw data ﬁles to the ABF format, the ﬁle-format con-
verter supports four vendor formats with the data sufﬁxes (.D)
for Agilent Technologies, (.LCD) for Shimadzu, (.Wiff) for AB
SCIEX and (.Raw) for Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc. The converter
is independently and freely available at http://www.reifycs.com/
english/Abeonverter/. License information is available on the
same page. In addition, our program supports the szL data
format, which is used by open-source ﬁle translators such as
ProteoWizard (Chambers et al. 2012). Through this software,
data import from Waters (.Raw) became possible indirectly. As
for the output, all results including data tables and statistical
analyses such as principal component analysis (PCA) can be ex-
ported in tab-separated text and image formats (JPEG, PNG,
BMP, TIFF and GIF) for PCA.

5 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

We created a suite of GUI for our MRMPROBS program to
deal with the entire process pipeline from data import to statis-
tical analysis. The platform, originally developed for metabolo-
mics, can be applied to lipidomics and proteomics studies. Its
advantage is efﬁcient, on-demand visualization, yielding more

compound, and (b) an internal standard and the LOESS/cubic spline. The
QC variables of Fig. 2a (left) are gradually increasing along the analytical
run. On the other hand, Fig. 2b (right) shows the ﬂat proﬁle, meaning
that the program successfully corrects the amplitude drift. Data are taken
from our previous report on S.cerevisiae (Tsugawa et al., 2013)

objective quantiﬁcation and identiﬁcation of a large number of
targeted metabolites. Application to our previous dataset on
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Tsugawa et al., 2013) yielded 152 me-
tabolites successfully.

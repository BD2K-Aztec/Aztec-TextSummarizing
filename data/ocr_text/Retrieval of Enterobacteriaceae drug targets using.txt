Abstract

Motivation: The identification of potential drug target proteins in bacteria is important in pharma—
ceutical research for the development of new antibiotics to combat bacterial agents that cause
diseases.

Results: A new model that combines the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique with biolo—
gical filters composed of a set of protein properties associated with bacterial drug targets and simi—
larity to protein—coding essential genes of Escherichia coli (strain K12) has been created to predict
potential antibiotic drug targets in the Enterobacteriaceae family. This model identified 99 potential
drug target proteins in the studied family, which exhibit eight different functions and are protein—
coding essential genes or similar to protein—coding essential genes of E.coli (strain K12), indicating
that the disruption of the activities of these proteins is critical for cells. Proteins from bacteria with
described drug resistance were found among the retrieved candidates. These candidates have no
similarity to the human proteome, therefore exhibiting the advantage of causing no adverse effects

 

or at least no known adverse effects on humans.

1 Introduction

Members of the Enterobacteriaceae family are globally ubiquitous
organisms found in soil, water and vegetation and are part of the
normal gut microbiota of many animals, including humans. These
gram—negative bacteria include a large number of genera (e.g.
Klebsiella, Proteus, Serratia, Enterobacter and Escherichia), are
among the most abundant commensal microorganisms in humans,
are the most frequent cause of invasive diseases in patients of all ages
and acquire drug resistance at a concerning rate (Guerrero et 61].,
2014). Their ubiquity and frequent acquisition of mobile genetic
elements that give them a selective advantage drives human hosts to
be regularly exposed to new bacteria strains with novel genetic rep—
ertoires including antibiotic resistance. Resistant gram—negative bac—
teria are responsible for many nosocomial infections and healthy

non-hospitalized patient infections and are a major concern due to
the severity of the infections they cause, the ease of developing
multi—resistance and the absence of new therapeutic agents active
against this group of pathogens (CDC, 2013; WHO, 2014). The de—
velopment of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a growing phenom-
enon in the twenty—first century and is one of the world’s most
pressing public health concerns (Martins et 61]., 2013). Recent re—
ports have described the spread of carbapenem—resistant or carbape—
nemase—producing Enterobacteriaceae as being associated with high
mortality rates and having the potential to spread widely. The first
report of a carbapenem—resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae
was in 2001 in the United States; in Europe, the first case of infec—
tion, which was of US origin, was reported in 2005 in France, and in
2006, a case was first reported in Colombia and then in Brazil and

2001)

New antibiotics are needed as drug resistance continues to grow,
but little progress has been observed in the development of new anti—
biotics to combat bacterial infections, mainly because many
pharmaceutical companies are withdrawing from antibacterial
research and development likely due to the scientific challenges
associated with manufacturing a novel antibacterial drug, the low
return on investment that currently affects most pharmaceuticals
and the difficulties associated with the discovery of new drug
targets in bacteria (Lewis, 2013). Typically, a drug target is a mo—
lecular structure, such as a protein or a nucleic acid, through which
a drug modulates its therapeutic activity, and it can be a molecule in
the human body that causes disease for some reason or a molecule
from a disease—causing microorganism (Imming et al., 2006;
Overington et al., 2006). In this study, we will focus only on drug
targets that are proteins from species of the Enterobacteriaceae
family.

Different approaches can be applied for selection of a good
candidate to therapeutic target like models based on sequence to
function (Geyer et al., 2005), comparative genomics (Abadio
et al., 2011), metabolic pathways (Huthmacher et al., 2010),
structure—to—function (Darapaneni et al., 2009) and data mining
(Bakheet and Doig, 2010; Chanumolu et al., 2012). The most
common approach to assist new drug target identification has
been based on the determination of high sequence similarity
using the BLAST algorithm which is a good initial starting point,
but structure similarities are also important along with other
explicit or hidden correlations even for proteins with low se—
quence similarities (Haupt and Schroeder, 2011). New drug
targets can also be identified by establishing correlations between
known protein signatures with contiguous patterns of 10— to
50—residue—long amino acids associated with a particular structure
or function in proteins (Sheridan and Venkataraghavan, 1992),
as annotated on public resources such as InterPro (Hunter et al.,
2012). The model that we are proposing here in one of the only
few methods that is able to predict the existence of potential
drug targets based on the biological function, the domain and
functional sites of a protein (Bender et al., 2009; Santos et al.,
2013). Hopkins and Groom (2002) identified 130 InterPro entries
to be sufficient for the prediction of all of the human ‘druggable’
proteome.

Herein, we propose a model to identify potential antibiotic
drug targets of the Enterobacteriaceae family by exploring seman-
tic similarities across InterPro entries annotated to known
Enterobacteriaceae drug targets. In this model, we first specified a
drug target vector space model (VSM) using the known
Enterobacteriaceae drug targets and their associated InterPro entries
and applied the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique to
this dataset to create a reduced drug target space that reveals latent
correlations between the known drug targets that are impossible to
perceive by strictly direct queries onto relational databases. Through
the projection of the Enterobacteriaceae proteome vectors onto the
reduced drug target space and the application of the cosine metric to
the vectors’ angles, we were able to retrieve a set of potential antibi—
otic drug targets that incorporate the latent structural and functional
correlations between the known drug targets. The final set of
Enterohacteriaceae—specific antibiotic drug target candidates was
defined by filtering some of the protein properties associated with
bacterial drug targets and determining the similarity to protein-
coding essential genes of Escherichia coli (strain K12) and with the
human proteome.

2 Methods

2.1 Data collection and generation

The protein drug targets for all of the bacteria were downloaded
from DrugBank, and the Enterobacteriaceae complete proteome
was downloaded from UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot (Magrane and
Consortium, 2011); both of these datasets were downloaded in
April 2014. A MySQL relational database was built using the large
downloaded XML files, all of the data were integrated, and a data—
set of 414 Enterobacteriaceae antibiotic drug targets with 1173
unique InterPro entries (Hunter et al., 2012) and another dataset of
33 500 Enterobacteriaceae query proteins (Enterobacteriaceae com—
plete proteome, excluding the known Enterobacteriaceae antibiotic
drug targets) with 5 839 unique InterPro entries, were obtained.

The InterPro entries were collected from the database ‘Cross—
references’ lines in UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot. From the ‘Ontologies’ sec—
tion of UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot, we collected the list of manually
annotated keywords associated with each protein in our datasets
that we used for knowledge of some sequence properties, such as
subcellular location and molecular functions. The enzyme commis-
sion numbers (EC number) were collected from the ‘Description’
lines in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, where the enzyme classes for primary
EC numbers 1—6 correspond to oxidoreductases, transferases, hydro—
lases, lyases, isomerases and ligases, respectively.

The protein—coding essential genes were downloaded from the
database of essential genes (DEG; Luo et al., 2014). The database
contains 609 protein—coding essential genes of E.coli (strain K12).

Each Enterohacteriaceae—specific antibiotic drug target candidate
was subjected to BLASTp analysis against each E.coli (strain K12)
protein—coded essential gene and the human UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot
database, using the NCBI BLAST web server (http://blast.st—va.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

2.2 Singular value decomposition

For the establishment of the model, the first step was to convert
each protein from the dataset of Enterobacteriaceae antibiotic drug
targets and the dataset of Enterobacteriaceae query proteins to a
multidimensional binary feature vector, in which each descriptor
represented an InterPro entry. Each drug target was represented in a
VSM, which is one of the most commonly used models of informa-
tion retrieval in real—life systems (Salton, 1988). This algebraic
model was originally created for the representation of text docu—
ments as vectors in a V—dimensional vector space, where V repre—
sents the number of words or terms in the document, i.e. the number
of axes in the space and the documents points or vectors in this
space. Here, the drug targets are treated as documents, and the
InterPro entries are treated as terms. One of the important proper—
ties of these column vectors for our model is that they are very
sparse vectors because one drug target is associated with only one or
a few InterPro entries, which insinuates the application of latent se—
mantic indexing (LSI), an effective method in the text mining do—
main (Eldén, 2006) and most recently in biological studies (Santos
et al., 2011) revealing the implicit semantic structure in the usage of
words in a document, returning query results that are conceptually
similar in meaning even if the documents do not share a specific
word or words with the search criteria (Deerwester et al., 1990;
Dumais and Nielsen, 1992). LSI uses the mathematical technique
SVD, a commonly used technique for the analysis of multivariate
data that rearranges the vector space by eliminating the noise from
the original matrix in such a way that the more relevant associative
relationships become more visible and thereby establishing a

non—evident relationship between the clustered elements (Berry
et al., 1995; Chen et al., 2008; Eldén, 2006).

A close analysis of each vector revealed that many
Enterobacteriaceae antibiotic drug targets contained only one fea—
ture that would not even be repeated for another drug target. For
this reason, a matrix (M) with dimensions 243—by—290 was gener—
ated using the drug target multidimensional binary feature vectors
associated with more than one InterPro entry, and the SVD of the
matrix was computed using MATLAB. SVD factorizes M as
M = US VT, where U is the orthogonal matrix with the left singular
vectors of M, representing M’s columns (drug targets), V is the
orthogonal matrix with the right singular vectors of M,
representing M’s lines (InterPro entries) and S is the diagonal matrix
of the same dimension as M, with r> 0 diagonal elements, which
are the singular values of M, sorted by convention with the highest
singular value in the upper left index of the S matrix, where r is the
rank of M (the number of linearly independent columns or rows of
M). The highest singular values are directly associated with more
significant characteristics within the drug targets (Eldén, 2006).
If we use the notation M : U(SVT), M stands out as a linear
combination of U, where this U matrix is the base that represents
the columns of M and S VT represents the relationship between the
columns of M, denoting the relationship between the drug targets
(Eldén, 2006). Considering only the [a most significant singular
values of M, where k < r, matrix M can be approximated by a low—
dimensional matrix (Mk) given by Mk : UkSkaT. The dataset repre—
sented by a smaller number of singular values shows a tendency to
cluster elements that would not be grouped if the original dataset
was used.

3 Results

A reduced space of Enterobacteriaceae antibiotic drug targets was
defined using the Sk(Vk)T components of the Mk matrix with a rank
corresponding to the 13 largest singular values of M, where k < r. The
drug target matrix SVD was computed, and its dimensionality was
reduced to the 65 largest singular values of this matrix, a value that
is sufficiently high to fit all the data in the real structure and to re—
move the sampling error and unimportant data. The choice of the
number of singular values that are to be used for the construction of
Mk after SVD is critical and normally empirically decided. The sin-
gular value spectrum is easily visualized in a 1D plot, and the height
of any singular value is indicative of its importance for explaining
the data. We drew a 1D plot for the relative singular value spectrum
(Fig. 1) and applied Cattell’s graphical method to help decide on the
significant values (Cattell, 1966).

Cattell’s principle assumes that if the original variables are linear
combinations of a determined number of underlying variables, the
plot will tend to decrease sharply for the singular values associated
with the core variables and then much more slowly for the remain-
ing ones; thus, the significant singular values to be retained are those
corresponding to the sharp dropdown line (Cattell, 1966). Everitt
and Dunn (2001) proposed an alternate heuristic approach for
deciding the significant singular values that recommends the analysis
of the relative variances of each singular value and ignoring the sin-
gular values with a relative variance that is lower than 0.7/11, where
n is the number of proteins in the original matrix. We combined the
two heuristics to obtain the [a value of 65. By representing the data
into this SVD subspace, we created a semantic VSM, in which the
known drug targets are represented by vectors that express the linear

combination of the relevant descriptors, revealing the hidden struc—
ture of the data (Fig. 2).

Using the Uk of the truncated matrix Mk, each
Enterobacteriaceae query protein (q) was projected onto the
reduced Enterobacteriaceae antibiotic drug target space to obtain
the equivalent vector qk using the equation qkquUk, which was
proposed by Eldén (2006). The pairwise semantic similarity was
determined by calculating the cosine between each pair of query
protein and drug target. The numeric similarity between two
vectors can be measured by the cosine of the angle that they
form, with the cosine of the angle yielding a value in the real
range [—1.0, +1.0], where +1.0 is associated with identical
vectors or similar proteins, 0.0 represents orthogonal vectors or
dissimilar proteins, and a negative value close to —1.0 indicates
vectors in the opposite direction (Singhal, 2001). For determining
the dataset of Enterobacteriaceae potential drug targets, the 0.2
cosine similarity between each pair was considered, a value
that aims to retrieve the topologically closely related
descriptors with no evident feature relationship. By applying the
described model and using the referred cosine cut—off value,

we recovered 13 092 Enterohacteriaceae—specific antibiotic drug
target candidates.

Latent semantic relations are the consequence of InterPro entries
sharing among proteins. Within this framework, and to make such
relations more explicit, the InterPro entries that didn’t repeat and
their associated drug targets were removed from the original matrix.
For this reason, this model was developed with 290 drug targets, out
of a total of 415. The robustness of this model was thoroughly eval—
uated and sensitivity and specificity values were determined taking
into consideration the context of the model and the choices that
were done while modelling the problem. After removal of several
test sets and their subsequent projection in the reduced spaced cre—
ated by the remaining drug targets, the model was able to classify
the test sets as drug targets (the cosine between any pair of test pro—
tein and its most similar drug target present in the model was >09).
As it is known beforehand that the model fails to classify 125 (415 —
290) drug targets because their projection in the reduced vector
space is the null vector, the sensitivity of this model is 70% (290/
415). The specificity is 100% because we are considering a non—
target to be any protein that doesn’t share any InterPro entry with
the 290 drug targets of the model.

In 2010, Bakheet and Doig (2010) identified many protein prop—
erties associated with bacterial drug targets. We refined our list of
Enterohacteriaceae—specific antibiotic drug target candidates by
applying some of these properties (Fig. 3). The first chosen property
that was filtered was the existence of catalytic activity because drug
targets are most likely to be enzymes (Bakheet and Doig, 2010), and
this filtering resulted in 7989 candidates. It has also been revealed
that the preferred subcellular location for bacterial drug targets are
the cytoplasm and periplasm, which is a logical approach because
the highest percentage of known bacterial drug targets have these
preferred locations (Bakheet and Doig, 2010). Gathering the candi—
dates based on this former filter resulted in 1127 Enterobacteriaceae
antibiotic drug target candidates. After applying a set of keywords
related to antibiotic response, cellular processes of transcription,
translation, replication and bacterial cell biosynthesis, a list shaped
based on the properties identified by Bakheet and Doig (2010), no
more candidates were excluded, which means that the model de—
veloped preserved the most relevant drug target properties in the
Enterobacteriaceae family.

Antibiotic drug targets are ideally protein—coding sequences es—
sential to the pathogen, have a unique function in the pathogen, are
present only in the pathogen and are able to be inhibited by a small
molecule. The importance of a unique protein as a candidate to drug
target is determined on the basis of its functional importance, for ex-
ample, if it is essential in cell survival or if it is an enzyme that cata—
lyses a reaction in which either a substrate or product is uniquely
consumed or produced. Even if a small drug molecule can modulate
an identified candidate, if it is not involved in critical functions in
the pathogen, this modulation will have no serious consequence on
their survival or growth. Targeting an essential protein for a parasite
may provide an effective way to control infection; thus, proteins
encoded from pathogen essential genes serve as potential drug tar—
gets. Essential genes are the minimal set of genes that code for cen—
tral cellular processes required for the viability or fertility of an
organism so they are indispensable for the survival of an organism,
and their functions are, therefore, considered a foundation of life
(Chen et al., 2012; Gerdes et al., 2006). A sequence similarity search
of the 1127 Enterobacteriaceae antibiotic drug target candidates
against the E.coli (strain K12) protein—coding essential genes using
the BLASTp tool, returned 860 candidates similar to a protein—
coding essential gene (identity >70%), with 19 E.coli (strain K12)

protein—coding essential genes and 620 proteins in the
Enterobacteriaceae family with a known human host, as described
in HAMAP (Pedruzzi et al., 2013), similar to protein—coding essen—
tial genes. For similarity determination, only the sequences with a
query cover higher than 70% and E—values lower than 10—20 were
considered.

Enterobacteriaceae antibiotic drug target candidates that are
essential gene products or that are similar to protein—coding essential
genes were checked for similarity to the human proteome to identify
potential targets that may cause adverse effects in patients. A list of 99
proteins were found not to be similar to any human protein (identity
<20%), indicating that when modulated by an antibiotic drug, they
have little chance of causing known adverse events in their human
hosts or at least no known adverse events. This list is available in
Supplementary Material. Out of these Enterobacteriaceae antibiotic
drug target candidates with a human host, some proteins are from
eight bacteria with described drug—resistance in HAMAP: E.coli
017zK52zH18 (strain UMN026/ExPEC), Klehsiella pneumonia
subsp. pneumoniae (strain ATCC 700721/MGH 78578), Salmonella
choleraesuis (strain SC—B67), Salmonella agona (strain SL483),
Salmonella newport (strain SL254), Salmonella paratyphi A (strain
AKU_12601), Salmonella heidelherg (strain SL476) and Salmonella
schwarzengrund (strain CVM19633). The Enterobacteriaceae antibi—
otic drug target candidates in bacteria with a human host hold eight
different functions: 3—oxoacyl—[acyl—carrier—protein] synthase 3 (KAS
III), UDP—N—acetylglucosamine acyltransferase (prA), D-alanine—
D-alanine ligase B, serine acetyltransferase (SATase), 2,3,4,5—
tetrahydropyridine—2,6—dicarboxylate N—succinyltransferase (THP
succinyltransferase), ribosomal—proteinalanine acetyltransferase,
ribosomal—protein—serine acetyltransferase and thioredoxin-2
(Trx2).

Fatty acids are a main source of energy in bacteria and play an
important role in the formation of cell membranes (Heath et al.,
2001), making the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway an attractive but
still largely unexploited target for the development of new antibac—
terial agents (Lee et al., 2012) with successful validated antibiotic
targets, such as KAS III from E.coli, which is inhibited by the
approved drug Cerulenin (http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/
DB01034) that irreversibly binds to it (Heath and Rock, 2004;
Wright and Reynolds, 2007). This enzyme is essential for bacterial
fatty acid synthesis in both gram—negative and gram—positive bac—
teria (Lai and Cronan, 2003). There is no reference in the literature
of inhibition studies in this enzyme for the Enterobacteriaceae, fam—
ily such as Klehsiella pneumoniae strains, with the exception of
E.coli. This is a encouraging potential antibiotic drug target for this
bacterial family.

prA catalyses the first step of the biosynthesis of Lipid A, a
phosphorylated glucosamine disaccharide with a long—chain satu—
rated fatty acid that serves as a hydrophobic anchor for the lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane of gram—negative bacteria
(Lee et al., 2013). The outer membrane of gram—negative bacteria is
an effective permeability barrier against external pernicious agents,
and in the Enterobacteriaceae family, LPS molecules occupy the
outer leaflet of the outer membrane, creating a highly ordered
monolayer with low fluidity, which is a structure that is shown to
create a poor partition of hydrophobic molecules into the hydropho—
bic interior portion of isolated LPS (Vaara and Nurminen, 1999).
E.coli leA gene mutants have severe defects in the biosynthesis of
lipid A, making them extremely susceptible to hydrophobic antibi—
otics, probably due to the lack of a continuous LPS layer in the outer
leaﬂet and the resultant compensatory presence of glycerol—
phospholipids patches in this leaﬂet or even transient ruptures,

Fig. 3. Diagram of the proposed model to identify potential antibiotic drug targets (DT) in the Enterobacteriaceae family. A drug target vector space was specified
using the known Enterobacteriaceae drug target proteins and their associated InterPro entries and SVD was applied to this dataset to create a reduced drug target
space that reveals latent correlations between the known drug targets. Th rough the projection of the Enterobacteriaceae proteome vectors (query proteins) onto
the reduced drug target space and the application of the cosine metric to the vectors’ angles, we were able to retrieve a set of potential antibiotic drug targets
(Enterobacteriaceae drug target candidates PM) that incorporate the latent correlations between the known drug targets. The final set of Enterobacteriaceae-
specific antibiotic drug target candidates (Enterobacteriaceae drug target candidates w/human host) was defined by application of a set of biological filter

allowing the diffusion of hydrophobic molecules (Vaara and
Nurminen, 1999). The use of E.coli mutants defective in the first
step of lipid A biosynthesis has shown that the lipid A domain of
LPS is essential to the growth and viability of cells (Galloway and
Raetz, 1990; Heath et al., 2001). Consequently, prA, the enzyme
catalysing the first step of the biosynthesis of lipid A, is a note-
worthy target for therapeutic intervention in gram-negative bacteria
that cause diseases.

D-Alanine-D-alanine ligase B is one of two D-alanine-D-alanine
ligases that exist in E.coli, is produced by the essential gene ddlB
and is an isoenzyme of the encoding ddlA gene product (Zawadzke
et al., 1991), which synthesizes D-alanyl-D-alanine, a dipeptide that
is then added to the precursor subunit of peptidoglycan and that
provides the site of peptidoglycan framework cross-linkage
(Ellsworth et al., 1996). Peptidoglycan is a structure that is unique
to bacterial cells, is essential to the maintenance of the structural in-
tegrity of the cell and is a structure that most bacterial cells contain
and other organisms do not have. This combination of major
uniqueness and cell survival essentiality makes peptidoglycan an ex-
cellent target for antibiotics. In fact, D-alanine-D-alanine ligase is an
antibacterial drug target, and E.coli D-alanine-D-alanine ligase A is a
long-known declared target of cycloserine (http://www.drugbank.
ca/drugs/DB00260), which inhibits both D-alanine-D-alanine ligases
but exhibits high toxicity to the human host (Batson et al., 2010).
This ddlB essential gene is preserved in over 80% of diverse bacterial
genomes (Gerdes et al., 2003), highlighting this gene’s product,
which is ubiquitous in prokaryotes possessing peptidoglycan, as a
good drug target.

SATase carries out the first step in the pathway of cysteine bio-
synthesis, catalysing the transference of an acetyl group to L-serine
into O-acetyl-L-serine, which will later be converted into L-cysteine

(Kredich and Tomkins, 1966 ). L-cysteine is required for cell growth
in some bacteria, such as E.coli, and also operates as a sulphur
donor for the synthesis of other cellular molecules, such as
L-methionine, glutathione, coenzyme A and molybdenum cofactor
(Sekowska et al., 2000). Because SATase is one of the key enzymes
for the biosynthesis of cysteine in E.coli, encoded by the essential
gene cysE (Gerdes et al., 2003), and is not crucial in humans as
L-cysteine is the produced in several reactions in these organisms, it
may serve as a potential novel target for developing new antibiotic
drugs.

The biosynthesis of lysine in bacteria occurs via the diaminopi-
melate-lysine pathway with THP succinyltransferase acting as a key
enzyme in this E.coli lysine biosynthetic pathway (Simms et al.,
1984). This pathway generates an important intermediate, namely
diaminopimelate (Danks et al., 2013), which is a building block of
peptidoglycan in the cell wall of many gram-negative bacteria
(Hutton et al., 2007). THP succinyltransferase is of special interest
as a bacteria-specific drug target because it is the product of an es-
sential gene, is involved in cell wall synthesis and is absent in mam-
malian cells because mammals lack the ability to biosynthesize
lysine that is therefore one of the nine essential amino acids that
must be provided through diet. This is a potential drug target that
has yet to be exploited.

Acetylation is a post-translational modification that is less preva-
lent in bacteria than in eukaryotes (Cain et al., 2014). In E.coli, the
essential genes rimI and rimL encode two N-acetyltransferases,
namely ribosomal-protein-alanine acetyltransferase and ribosomal-

function of this post—translational modification remains to be deter—
mined; however, because one of the roles established for N—acetyl—
ation in eukaryotes is protein stability, the same possibility has been
assumed for bacteria (Cain et al., 2014). Ribosomal proteins are the
protein components of the ribosomal subunits that are involved in
protein biosynthesis, and assuming that the raised possibility is a
true fact, an inhibition of these N—acetyl—transferases would cause
major damage to bacteria, making these excellent potential drug tar—
gets. In addition, the lack of protein similarity to the human prote—
ome makes the antibacterial drugs to be used to inhibit these good
candidates to drug targets and causative of no known adverse
effects.

Protection from oxidative stress and efficient redox regulation
are essential for bacteria that can grow in aerobic environments.
Thioredoxins are small ubiquitous redox proteins that are found in
nearly all organisms and that comprise the thioredoxin system, an
antioxidant system acting against oxidative stress through its disul—
fide reductase activity that regulates the protein dithiol/disulfide bal—
ance, and in E.coli, it constitutes a critical system for the
maintenance of cellular protein disulfide/dithiol redox control (Lu
and Holmgren, 2014; Stewart et al., 1998). Disulfide bonds in pro—
teins play numerous important roles, namely stabilization of the
proteins, or are formed transiently as part of a catalytic or regula—
tory cycle (Ritz and Beckwith, 2001). Trx2 is the product of the
ter essential gene in E.coli (Miranda—Vizuete et al., 1997), is an
oxidative stress—induced protein and play a role in the cellular
defence against oxidative stress (Collet et al., 2003). The important
redox roles of Trx2, the identified essentiality of its coded gene and
the lack of similarity to the human proteome make this protein a no—
ticeable candidate as an antibiotic drug target.

4 Conclusions

There is a race against time to develop new antibiotics to combat
bacterial agents causing diseases. This rushes the need to discover
new antibiotic drug targets. We propose a model for the identifica—
tion of potential antibiotic drug targets that incorporate the latent
structural and functional correlations between the known drug tar—
gets in the Enterobacteriaceae family, using the SVD technique fol—
lowed by fine—tuning of the results with a set of most relevant
protein properties associated with bacterial drug targets and similar—
ity to E.coli (strain K12) protein—coding essential genes. The applica—
tion of this model to the Enterobacteriaceae family proteome
returned 99 proteins candidates that have no similarity to the human
proteome and holding eight different functions. Of these, some pro—
teins are from eight bacteria with described drug resistance.

It is now a known fact that drugs almost invariably inﬂuence
more than one target to some extent as either a consequence of
structural similarities between the intended target and other pro—
teins, through allosteric effects on other proteins or due to genuine
multivalent target binding and if this occurs the result is usually a
series of unwanted side effects in addition to the desired therapeutic
effect. We adopted the criterion that if two proteins share <20% se—
quence identity, they are considered not to be similar and so no ad—
verse events to the human host would arise from a potential
inhibitor against a proposed candidate to bacteria drug targets. One
concern is that two proteins that fall in this cut—off value may have
similar binding sites; regions in the proteins’ structures
deeply related to their pharmacology (Durrant et al., 2010; Ho Sui
et al., 2012). This is a limitation of the current method and it is im-
portant to compare the various protein molecules in both the

pathogen and the host at the binding site level to remove target can—
didates that may have very high similarity with the human
proteome.

Predicting individual drug targets candidates is already of value
but this single protein strategy may ﬂaw due to drug resistance de—
velopment from a single amino acid mutation in the target protein
(Hopkins, 2008). But one must not forget that the essential nature
of a drug is its polypharmacology, therefore a drug that might be de—
veloped or repositioned for one of these target candidates will poten—
tially exhibit bioactivity against a series of other relevant targets in a
pathogen, preventing or delaying drug resistance. The findings from
this model should now be addressed with a structure—based systems
biology approach to identify off—targets related to the proposed tar—
get candidates on a proteome—wide scale (Ng et al., 2014; Pei et al.,
2014; Xie et al., 2014).

This model paves the way for the discovery of novel bacterial
drug targets for therapeutic intervention and has allowed the identi—
fication of a set of, still to be exploited, drug target candidates,
incorporating the latent structural and functional correlations be—
tween the known drug targets, a distinguishing feature among other
models for drug target retrieval.

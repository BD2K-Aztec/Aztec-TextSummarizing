ABSTRACT

Motivation: A popular method for classification of protein domain
movements apportions them into two main types: those with a
‘hinge’ mechanism and those with a ‘shear’ mechanism. The intuitive
assignment of domain movements to these classes has limited the
number of domain movements that can be classified in this way.
Furthermore, whether intended or not, the term ‘shear’ is often inter-
preted to mean a relative translation of the domains.

Results: Numbers of occurrences of four different types of residue
contact changes between domains were optimally combined by logis-
tic regression using the training set of domain movements intuitively
classified as hinge and shear to produce a predictor for hinge and
shear. This predictor was applied to give a 10-fold increase in the
number of examples over the number previously available with a
high degree of precision. It is shown that overall a relative translation
of domains is rare, and that there is no difference between hinge and
shear mechanisms in this respect. However, the shear set contains
significantly more examples of domains having a relative twisting
movement than the hinge set. The angle of rotation is also shown to
be a good discriminator between the two mechanisms.

1 INTRODUCTION

Multi-domain proteins can be regarded as comprising quasi-
globular regions connected by linkers that allow their relative
movement. Consequently, domain movements are often engaged
in protein function in a wide variety of contexts, including
catalysis, transport, signaling and immune response (Bennet
and Huber, 1984; Gerstein et al., 1994; Schulz, 1991). In many
of these cases, domain movements occur on the binding of a
ligand. For example, in multi-domain enzymes, the binding of
the substrate in the interdomain cleft causes the domains to close
trapping the substrate in the specific environment necessary
for catalysis. Well-known examples include citrate synthase
ONiegand and Remington, 1986), liver alcohol dehydrogenase

(Eklund et al., 1981) and Fl-ATPase [3 subunit (Abrahams
et al., 1994).

Experimentally determined information on protein domain
movements at the atomic level comes from the structures of pro-
teins in different states solved primarily by X-ray crystallography
and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These different
states may relate to function when they are within the functional
cycle, but they may also be due to differences in the experimental
conditions under which the structures were solved, or could be
due to natural or engineered mutations. These structures, de-
posited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000),
are a rich source of information on protein domain movements.
Thus, multiple structures of proteins have been used to analyse
and classify domain movements in a number of studies over the
past 20 years (Amemiya et al., 2011; Brylinski and Skolnick,
2008; Gerstein et al., 1994; Hayward, 1999; Qi and Hayward,
2009; Sinha et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 2013).

The concepts of hinge and shear mechanisms in domain move-
ments were first described by Gerstein et al. (1994) in their
inﬂuential review article. Subsequently, the DataBase of
Macromolecular Movements (DBMM) appeared online with
further examples (Gerstein and Krebs, 1998). Hinge motions
were described as those where the domains approach each
other perpendicular to the plane of the interface. Shear move-
ments, in contrast, have a preserved domain interface where the
domains have a relative movement along the plane of the inter-
face. Hinge movements would allow for large relative movement
of the domains, whereas shear movements would be limited by
the preserved side-chain packing at the interface. Although few
details were given, it seems that these assignments were made
intuitively, probably using molecular graphics software to com-
pare the open and closed structures. This approach obviously
limits the number of cases that can be classiﬁed in this way,
and is also open to criticism in that it is not reproducible.
Despite these limitations, the fact remains that, for some pro-
teins, domain closure occurs through a simple ‘pacman’ opening-
closing movement, whereas for others the movement is more
complex with the two domains remaining in contact during the
domain movement. To investigate this further, one would need
to develop an automatic method for assigning hinge and shear
that uses quantitative and reproducible methods. With this
method, one would be able to classify a much larger number
of domain movements allowing the further investigation of
these two types of mechanisms. To do this, quantities are
required that capture the essential difference between hinge and
shear movements. The descriptions used in the articles that

anisms. The arrows indicate the direction of movement from the closed

describe the hinge and shear movements point to two alternative
approaches: one based on the relationship between the domain
interface and the movement, the other based on residue contact
changes (e. g. Via ‘interdigitating sidechains’, or newly established
contacts, see Fig. 1). In this article, we have taken the latter
approach.

In our previous work (Taylor et al., 2013), changes in inter-
domain residue contacts that occur in the domain movement
were used to deﬁne four types of elemental contact changes:
maintained, exchanged partner, exchanged pair and new.
A maintained contact change is where the same pair of residues
is found to be in contact in both conformations. An exchanged-
partner contact change is one where the same residue is found to
be in contact with two different residues in the two conform-
ations, as would occur in a sliding movement. An exchanged-
pair contact change is one where the residue contact pair in one
conformation and the residue contact pair in the other conform-
ation have no residues in common, as would occur in a see-saw
movement. A new contact change is one where there is a contact
pair in one conformation but no contact pair in the other con-
formation and might occur in an open to closed domain move-
ment. Counting the number of instances of each elemental
contact-change type is non-trivial, but a solution was found by
the use of so-called ‘dynamic contact graphs’ (Taylor et al.,
2013). If a domain movement is predominantly shear, one
would expect it to have a relatively large number of either main-
tained or exchanged-partner contact changes, whereas if a
domain movement is predominantly hinge, then one would
expect it to have a relatively large number of exchanged-pair
or new contact changes.

Here machine learning is used, which uses the number of in-
stances of each of these four types of contact changes for each
domain movement to ‘1earn’ from the DBMM to make hinge
and shear assignments optimally. The movements in a much
larger dataset can then be assigned to hinge and shear categories
automatically. In a sense, this approach has allowed us to extract
some essence of the subjective approach used to assign hinge and
shear movements in the DBMM so that these assignments can be
made to a larger dataset.

The language, and the ﬁgure used in the review article by
Gerstein et a]. (1994) to depict the shear movement, appears to
have led to an interpretation of a shear movement to mean a
relative translational movement of the domains, i.e. there is little
or no rotational movement involved. Figure 1 illustrates hinge
and shear movements based on the ﬁgure and descriptions given
in the review article (Gerstein et al., 1994). A similar ﬁgure has

appeared in a review article on protein ﬂexibility and drug design
(Teague, 2003).

One might wonder why it is important to make a distinction
between a rotational motion and a translational motion in the
context of protein domain motions. The key point is that rota-
tions will be locally controlled at speciﬁc hinge sites, whereas a
translational motion would not be controlled at speciﬁc sites.
Sites where control over a functional movement is exercised
are potential target sites for therapeutic molecules. For example,
a drug molecule binding to a single hinge site in an enzyme might
prevent domain closure and subsequent catalysis of the natural
substrate occurring just as effectively as an inhibitor that binds to
the active site. The assignment of a domain movement as occur-
ring Via a translation would seem to preclude it from this form of
alternative drug-site targeting.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The basic data are the 2035 unique domain movements from the non-
redundant database of protein domain movements, NRDPDM (Qi et al.,
2005). The domain movements were determined by the DynDom pro-
gram (Hayward and Berendsen, 1998; Hayward and Lee, 2002). These
unique movements come from 1578 families, which means that some
domain movements are from the same family. Individual cases from
this dataset are available to browse at http://www.cmp.uea.ac.uk/
dyndom. To simplify the analysis, only those cases with two domains
were used. Of the 2035 cases, 1822 are two-domain proteins. This dataset
will be referred to as ‘NRDPDM2d’.

DBMM (Gerstein and Krebs, 1998) is available online (http://www.
molmovdb.org) and has 37 examples of domain motions classiﬁed as
‘predominantly shear’ and 75 examples of domain motions classiﬁed as
‘predominantly hinge’.

2.1 Residue contact deﬁnition

Contact between residue i and residue j means any heavy atom of residue
i is within 4A of any heavy atom of residue j. However, before the set of
pair-wise contacts between residues in each domain and for each con-
formation is determined, residues at the boundaries of the domains as-
signed by DynDom as bending regions were removed, as were residues
close to the interdomain screw axis (any heavy atom of the residue within
5.5 A of the axis). The reason for this is that they would be expected to
have maintained contacts irrespective of the nature of the domain
movement.

2.2 Counting the number of elemental contact changes
in a domain movement

Let {(ali,bli)}, i = 1, N1 be the set of ordered pairs of residue numbers
corresponding to residues, an from domain A, and b1, from domain B,
making a contact in conformation 1. Let {(aZi, bzi)}, i = 1, N2 be the
equivalent set for conformation 2. From these two sets, a ‘dynamic con-
tact graph’ (DCG) can be created as described by Taylor et a]. (2013).
A DCG is a directed graph, an example of which from citrate synthase is
shown in Figure 2A. In a DCG, each node of the graph represents a
residue of which there are two types: those in domain A and those in
domain B. An edge joins the two nodes when there is a contact between
the residue in domain A and the residue in domain B, with the edge
direction being from the node in A to the node in B if a contact exists
in conformation 1 (ah—>b1i) and in the opposite direction if the contact
exists in conformation 2 (a2i<—b2i). Figure 2B shows the ‘elemental
DCGs’ and the elemental contact changes they represent, namely, main-
tained, exchanged-partner, exchanged-pair and new. As outlined by

a residue in domain B with the residue number written in the square. An
arrow from a residue in A to a residue in B indicates a contact between

ental DCGs to give Nmaim = 10, Nexchpart = 2, thpair = 2 and
Nnew = 6. The prediction value for this domain movement is 0.55,
which puts it in the Mixed class

Taylor et al. (2013), any complex DCG can be decomposed into these
elemental DCGs, which allows us to count the number of elemental con-
tact changes involved in the movement. The number of elemental contact
changes, Nmaim, Nexchpart, Nexchpair and Nnew [referred to collectively as
N Where N : (Nmaint Nexchpart Nexchpair Nnew)]9 is the primary input for
the logistic regression.

2.3 Logistic regression

Matching domain pairs between DBMM and NRDPDM2d To
perform logistic regression, pairs of structures representing the domain
movement in NRDPDM2d need to be matched to pairs of structures in
DBMM. NRDPDM is organized by protein family within which the
structures are grouped according to a conformational clustering proced-
ure (Qi et al., 2005). We considered there to be a match between a pair of
structures in NRDPDM2d and DBMM if both DBMM structures (iden-
tiﬁed by PDB accession code and chain identiﬁer) are found in the same
NRDPDM family.

 

Logistic regression procedure Let Ni represent a four-component
ve'Ctor   : Nmaint,i9  : Nexchpart,i9  : Nexchpair,i and
N21: Nnew,i9 Where Nmaint,i9 Nexchpart,i9 Nexchpair,i and Nnew,i9 denOte
Nmaint, Nexchpart, Nexchpair and Nnew in domain movement i, respectively.
Let ti = 0 when the DBMM assignment for domain movement i is

 

predominantly hinge, and ti = 1 when the DBMM assignment for
domain movement i is predominantly shear. Given labelled training
data D = {(N’,ti)}, logistic regression constructs a decision rule that can
be used to distinguish between objects belonging to two classes. The 10-
gistic regression model is of the form:

logit(y(N)) = w - X + b (1a)

where

iogit(p)=iog(i) (1b)
1 — p

w is a four-component vector of regression coefﬁcients and b is a scalar
bias parameter. The optimal value of the regression coefﬁcients is deter-
mined by minimizing the cross-entropy training criterion:

L
= _%Z[tilog (yi)+<1 — elog (1 — yo] (2)
i=1

where yi = y(Ni), L is the total number of domain movements in the
training set (i.e. the total number of NRDPDM2d domain movements
corresponding to the DBMM set).

The output of the logistic regression model can then be regarded as an
estimate of the Bayesian a posteriori probability of class membership, i.e.

Y(N) % P(t = 1 IN) (3)

2.4 Translation and Chasles’ theorem

Chasles’ theorem (Chasles, 1830) states that the most general displace-
ment of a rigid body is a screw movement about a unique screw axis. That
is, given a rigid body in two different positions (and orientations), the
body can be taken from one to the other by a screw movement about a
unique screw axis. The DynDom program (Hayward and Berendsen,
1998) determines this screw axis. DynDom produces a PDB-formatted
ﬁle that contains the structures superposed on one domain together with
an ‘arrow molecule’ that depicts the interdomain screw axis. This ﬁle
allows the calculation of distances between the structures and the inter-
domain screw axis and can be used for visualizing the domain movement
using molecular graphics software. DynDom also gives the rotation angle
and translational displacement along the axis that occurs in the screw
movement. If the movement is a pure rotation about an axis, then this
screw axis is the rotation axis. If a body undergoes a rotation about a
structural hinge but also undergoes a translation in the plane of the ro-
tation, then the interdomain screw axis will not coincide with the original
hinge axis. Thus, we test for the screw axis being located outside the body
of the protein. If this is the case, then we can be sure that there is no
control over the rotation being exercised at the axis location, and conse-
quently any rotation about a structural hinge must be accompanied by a
translation in the rotation plane. The location of the interdomain screw
axis was previously used to deﬁne a ‘mechanical hinge’ (Hayward, 1999),
it being a bending region (a region of the backbone connecting the two
domains within which the rotational transition occurs) with any one of its
Cu-atoms within 5 .5 A of the interdomain screw axis. In proteins not all
bending regions are mechanical hinges, but those that are can be thought
of as controlling the domain movement much as the hinge of a door helps
to determine the location of its rotational axis. An interdomain screw axis
that has at least one mechanical hinge has been called an ‘effective hinge
axis’ (Hayward, 1999). DynDom also determines the percentage closure.
Those with a percentage >50% are annotated here as having a closure
motion; those with a percentage 550% are annotated as having a twisting
motion.

The signiﬁcance tests made are described in the Supplementary
Material.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Prediction of hinge and shear

Of the 37 ‘predominantly shear’ domain movements in the
DBMM, 21 were also in NRDPDM2d, and of the 75 ‘predom—
inantly hinge’ domain movements in the DBMM, 41 were also in
NRDPDM2d. To improve statistics, we used the DynDom pro-
gram directly on structures provided at the DBMM, which gave
an extra two examples to add to the 21 from NRDPDM2d in the
shear category and an extra 13 to add to the 41 in NRDPDM2d
in the hinge category. The training set can be found in the
Supplementary Material. The Ni were calculated for each of
the 77 domain movements in the training set, and logistic regres-
sion was carried out as described in the Methods section. Logistic
regression produced the following model:

 

1
y(N) _ 1 + e“ (4a)
where
a = — 0.23 87Nmaim — 0.0356Nexchpart + 0.4249Nexchpair (4b)

+ 0.2122Nnew + 0.1467

To determine whether this model corresponds well to the
DBMM assignments, a receiver-operating characteristic curve
(ROC) curve was determined. A ROC curve plots the true-positive
rate against the false-positive rate. A true positive is a shear
correctly predicted shear, and a false positive is a hinge incorrectly
predicted shear. The true-positive rate is the number of true posi-
tives to number of shear in the dataset, and the false-positive rate
is the number of false positives to number of hinge in the dataset.
Figure 3A shows the ROC curve. The area under the ROC curve is
0.83, indicating that the logistic function is a good discriminator
between hinge and shear movements. To conﬁrm this result, a
leave-one-out cross-validation approach was used, the ROC
curve of which is shown in Figure 3B. The area under this ROC
curve is 0.77, conﬁrming that the logistic function is able to give a
good predictor for hinge and shear. Regularized logistic regression
(Cessie and Houwelingen, 1992) and kernel logistic regression
(Cawley et al., 2007; Cawley and Talbot, 2008) were also tried,
but these did not improve on the results obtained using conven-
tional logistic regression.

Before Equation 4 was applied to the NRDPDM2d, the 412
cases where N = 0, were removed, i.e. those cases where Nmaim,
Nexchpan, thpair and Nnew are all equal to zero. The removed
movements are those classiﬁed as ‘No-contact’, as there are no
domain contacts in either conformation. These cases would not
be expected to be classed as either shear or hinge according to
Gerstein et al., and no such case was found among the 77
DBMM examples. Equation 4 was applied to the remaining
1410 movements in the NRDPDM2d.

Figure 4A shows a histogram for the frequency distribution of
the prediction values y. As can be seen, there is no obvious clus-
tering, but there are pronounced peaks at certain values of y. The
peaks labelled a,b,c,d,e are due to domain movements where
N = (0 0 0 Nnew), Nnew = 1,2,3,4,5, respectively. In our previous
work (Taylor et al., 2013), these domain movements are in the
‘Pure new’ class (the most populous after the ‘No-contact’ class),

Fig. 3. ROC curves for the prediction of hinge and shear using logistic
regression. A predictor for shear and hinge was constructed and tested
against predominantly shear and predominantly hinge assignments in the
DBMM. The ROC curve for the logistic function, given in Equation 4,
gives the unbroken line; the convex hull of the unbroken line is the
broken line. (A) The area under the ROC curve is 0.83, and the area
under the convex hull is 0.86. (B) The ROC curve for a leave-one-out

area under the convex hull, 0.80

meaning that in one conformation there are no contacts between
the domains and in the other conformation there are exactly
Nnew pairwise residue contacts. For these cases, the larger the
Nnew, the more ‘hinge-like’ they seem to become in terms of their
y value (decreasing with increasing Nnew), although arguments
based on the presence or absence of contacts alone might con-
clude they are all equally domain movements Via a hinge mech-
anism; for all of these, y<0.45. The peak f, at y = 0.470, is due
to the predominance of examples with N = (1 0 0 1), which are
from the ‘Combined maintained new’ class (the third most popu-
lous class). The peak g, at y = 0.523, is from the ‘Pure main-
tained’ class with N = (1 0 0 0) where only one pairwise residue
contact is maintained between the domains in the domain
movement.

Given that we would like to include all cases in the ‘Pure new’
class as examples of a domain movement Via a hinge mechanism,
but to be sure that we are excluding weak examples from our
classiﬁer, the domain movements were put into three classes as
follows:

‘Hinge’, for cases with 0 g y g 0.45; ‘Shear’, for cases with
0.55 g y g 1.0; ‘Mixed’, for cases with 0.45 <y<0.55.

It is important for the comparisons we intend to make that the
two main classes, hinge and shear, have a high precision.

Fig. 4. Prediction value distributions. ‘Hinge’, ‘Mixed’ and ‘Shear’ are in
the prediction value regions 0.0—0.45, 0.45—0.55 and 0.55—1.0, respec-
tively. (A) Histogram of prediction values. The spikes indicated by ‘a’,
‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’, ‘e’, ‘f’ and ‘g’ correspond to N = (0 0 0 1), N = (0 0 0 2),
N=(0003),N=(0004),N=(0005),N=(1001)andN=(10
0 0), respectively. (B) The rotation angle plotted against prediction value.
The same peaks can be seen and offer an explanation for their existence.
For example, the peak at ‘a’ for prediction value 0.411 corresponding to
N = (0 0 0 1) means there are a large number of domain movements with
various angles of rotation that are all able to break a single residue con-
tact pair

The precision of a class can be calculated as the proportion of
cases correctly predicted to be in that class (true-positive results)
to the total number cases predicted to be in that class. Of the 61
DBMM cases predicted hinge, 48 were actually predominantly
hinge according to DBMM, giving a precision of 79%. The
numbers are low for the calculation of the precision of shear
prediction. Only 12 DBMM cases were predicted shear, with 9
of them actually classed as predominantly shear by DBMM,
giving a precision of 75%. The natural boundary of 0.5 (so
hinge for 0 g y g 0.5 and shear for 0.5<y g 1.0) lowers the pre-
cision for the shear class to below 70%. These results support our
choice of 0.45 and 0.55 as the classiﬁcation boundaries and show
that we are able to assign hinge and shear to domain movements
automatically with a high degree of correspondence with assign-
ments made using the intuitive method.

Applying the predictor to the 1410 examples, 884 are the hinge
class (63%), 361 in the shear class (26%), with the remaining 165
in the mixed class (12%). Out of the whole set of 1822 domain
movements, 23% are in the No-contact set, 49% hinge, 20% for
shear, and 9% mixed. This means we have a 10-fold increase in
the number of examples over the number previously available
allowing us to study hinge and shear mechanisms using statistical
methods to measure the signiﬁcance of our results. The result of
applying the predicator to the training set can be found in the
Supplementary Material.

3.2 Rotation angle as indicator of hinge and shear

Figure 4B shows the rotation angle plotted against the prediction
value. One can discern a general trend for the rotation angle to
increase with decreasing prediction value, i.e. the motions
become more hinge-like. Large rotations occur below a predic-
tion value of 0.45 in the hinge region. Most of the peaks there
correspond to the peaks indicated in Figure 4A and also corres-
pond to the ‘Pure new’ class. In fact, nearly 80% of those peaks
in hinge are where Nnew is larger than Nmaim, Nexchpart, and
Nexchpair. Figure 5 shows histograms for the rotation angles for
the four categories. One can immediately see that for shear, ro-
tations do not exceed 25°. For these cases, there is nearly always
either predominance in the number of maintained, Nmaim, or the
number of exchanged-partner contact changes, Nexchpart, indicat-
ing that for a preserved-interface movement the angle of rotation
is limited to 25°.

Also of interest in Figure 5 is the slight increase in the number
of hinge examples where the angle of rotation is close to 1800.
Some of these are examples of domain swapping (Bennett et al.,
1994).

Figures 4 and 5 suggest that the angle of rotation is predictive
of whether a domain movement is hinge or shear. Figure 6 shows
the extent to which rotation can be used for predicting hinge or
shear. In Figure 6A, the blue line gives, among all domain move-
ments (excluding non-contact cases) with rotation angles greater

3.3 Translation in domain movements

If the shear concept relates to translational movement, then one
would expect a large proportion of the shear set to have an
interdomain screw axis located outside the body of the protein.
However, of the 361 shear examples, only ﬁve (1.4%) have an
axis outside the body of the protein (using a cut-off distance of
5.5 A between the axis and any heavy atom of the protein). For
the 884 hinge examples, 9 (1.0%) have an axis outside the body
of the protein. The rarity of axes located outside the body of the
protein indicates that translational movements are rare overall. If
there is any truth in the concept of shear indicating a transla-
tional movement and hinge indicating a rotational movement,
then at least one would expect there to be signiﬁcantly more
cases of remote axes in the shear set than the hinge set.
Signiﬁcance testing on this gave a z-value of 0.56, which gives
p(z Z 0.56) = 29% for the probability that this difference (1.4%
versus 1%) or greater occurs by chance. This result suggests that
shear movements are just as likely to have a rotational axis
within the body of the protein as hinge movements, implying
local control, and that shear movements do not involve the rela-
tive translation of one domain relative to the other at least with-
out a rotation occurring about an axis within the body of the

protein, i.e. translation is in the axis direction. Considering trans-
lation in the axis direction, the mean absolute value for the hinge
set is 1.47A (SD = 3.1 A), whereas for the shear set the mean is
0.35A (SD = 0.37 A). Thus, there is signiﬁcantly more transla-
tion along the axis in the hinge set than the shear set, but this is
likely to be because of the fact that the rotations are larger
among the hinge set. Comparing the pitch would make more
sense. The mean absolute value of the pitch for the hinge set is
0.043 A/degree (SD = 0.095 A/degree), whereas for the shear set
the mean is 0.044A/degree (SD = 0.058 A/degree). Again the
difference is not signiﬁcant (P = 58%).

We also have tested whether the shear set is signiﬁcantly more
likely not to have an effective hinge axis compared with the hinge
set. For shear, 61 examples do not have an effective hinge axis
(16.8%), whereas the corresponding value for hinge is 117
(13.2%). With a P = 4.7%, this would be signiﬁcant at the 5%
level and suggests that for shear, interactions at the preserved
domain interface help control the domain movement, whereas in
hinge, it is more likely to be the backbone connections between
the domains.

3.4 Twisting movements

The presence of exchanged-partner contact changes is a strong
indicator for a shear movement. In our previous work, it was
argued that when this type of contact change occurs in isolation,
then under certain assumptions concerning the shape of the do-
mains and the location of the hinge axis, this is most likely to
occur Via a ‘sliding twist’ movement. A new contact change or an
exchanged-pair contact change would most likely occur Via either
an open-closed or see-saw domain movement. These movements
would be closure movements under the same assumptions. This
would suggest that twisting movements are more likely to occur
in the shear set than the hinge set. For shear, 114 have a pre-
dominantly twisting movement (32.0%), whereas the corres-
ponding value for hinge is 192 (21.7%). With a P = 0.012%,
this difference is highly signiﬁcant, showing that twisting move-
ments are more prevalent in the shear set.

3.5 Website

We have produced a website (see http://www.cmp.uea.ac.uk/
dyndom/interface) where the domain movements are organized
according to whether they are in the no-contact, shear (called
‘Interface—preserving movement’, see Discussion section), hinge
(called ‘Interface—creating movement’) or mixed set. Each class
comprises a list of protein names together with a pair of PDB
accession codes and chain identiﬁers that specify the domain
movement. The link provided takes one to a page where the
molecular graphics applet, Jmol (http://jmol.sourceforge.net/),
is used to display the movement and to indicate the residues
that make contact in each conformation. There is also a link
to the corresponding DCG classiﬁcation page and the
DynDom page for that domain movement which gives details
on the residues comprising the domains, the location of the hinge
axis, the hinge-bending residues, the angle of rotation, percentage
closure, as well as many other details. A link to the DynDom
family page is also provided, which gives a conformational ana-
lysis of closely related structures and their domain movements.

Quantitative method for the assignment

 

4 DISCUSSION

The concept of hinge and shear mechanisms in domain move-
ments was introduced nearly 20 years ago. Assignments of
domain movements to these mechanisms were made by an intui-
tive method that is necessarily subjective. This has limited its
application to a small number of domain movements. In the
past 20 years, the PDB has grown 30-fold in size and with it
the number of implied domain movements. The NRDPDM
database contains 2035 unique domain movements, and it
would be an onerous task to analyse all of these conform-
ational pairs using molecular graphics software, for the purpose
of assigning hinge and shear mechanisms. Therefore, an object-
ive, quantitative method that can be implemented computation-
ally for rapid assignment is needed. The difﬁculty in achieving
this lies in the translation of a subjective method to a quantitative
method. There are two pieces of information we can use for
this purpose: the description of the subjective method used,
and the actual assignments themselves. The description sug-
gested that quantities based on the number of instances in
each of the four types of residue contact changes from our
previous work (Taylor et al., 2013) could be used in distin-
guishing between preserved interfaces and interface creation.
The assignments themselves were used as training data to
combine these quantities using logistic regression so as to
optimally reproduce the original assignments. The results
suggest that we have indeed succeeded in creating a quantitative
method for computational assignment of hinge and shear
mechanisms. Using this approach, we have managed to
classify a much larger set of domain movements into hinge
and shear resulting in a 10-fold increase in the number of ex-
amples over the number previously available with a high degree
of precision.

The term ‘shear’ and the ﬁgures used to illustrate the shear
mechanism have led many to interpret a domain closure to occur
Via a relative translation of one domain relative to the other.
Although this is possible, our results have shown that this is
rare overall, and no more likely to occur among the shear set
than the hinge set. We suggest that the term ‘shear movement’ is
better referred to as ‘interface-preserving movement’ and ‘hinge’
as ‘interface—creating movement’. These more prosaic terms are
still broadly consistent with the original concept but should not
lead to misinterpretation.

Our analysis has shown that for proteins with domain move-
ments classiﬁed as shear, the movement does not involve a sig-
niﬁcant translation of the two domains but a rotation about an
axis within the body of the protein just as for a protein undergo-
ing a domain movement Via the hinge mechanism. We have
shown that maintained and exchanged-partner contact changes
are strong indicators for shear, whereas exchanged-pair and new
contact changes are strong indicators for hinge. The ﬁnding that
there are signiﬁcantly more twisting movements in the shear set
than in the hinge set is consistent with the notion that a twisting
movement can preserve the domain interface. This offers one
explanation of how a rotational movement can preserve an inter-
face without relative translation. However, not all predominantly
interface-preserving movements occur Via a twisting motion;
many can still occur Via a closure motion by rotation about
well-deﬁned hinges.

The case of citrate synthase illustrates how a ‘predominantly
shear’ movement as designated by DBMM would still be appro-
priately described as hinge-bending even though it is in our
mixed class (prediction value of 0.55) with slightly more inter-
face-preserving features than interface creating. Figure 2A shows
the DCG for citrate synthase. There are 10 maintained contact
changes, 2 exchanged-partner contact changes, 2 exchanged-
partner contact changes and 6 new contact changes. It has a
well-deﬁned hinge axis created by mechanical hinges, one of
which is a ‘hinged-loop’ (Hayward, 1999), a loop ﬂanked by
two bending regions through which the hinge axis passes. This
hinged-loop clearly helps control the domain movement just as a
hinge would in a protein conventionally regarded as undergoing
closure Via hinge bending, e.g. lactoferrin. The domain move-
ment in citrate synthase is also an example of a protein that
undergoes closure (84%) Via hinge bending, but one that pre-
serves some part of the domain interface.

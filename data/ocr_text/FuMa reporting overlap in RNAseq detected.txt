Abstract

Summary: A new generation of tools that identify fusion genes in RNA-seq data is limited in either
sensitivity and or specificity. To allow further downstream analysis and to estimate performance,
predicted fusion genes from different tools have to be compared. However, the transcriptomic con-
text complicates genomic location-based matching. FusionMatcher (FuMa) is a program that re-
ports identical fusion genes based on gene-name annotations. FuMa automatically compares and
summarizes all combinations of two or more datasets in a single run, without additional program-
ming necessary. FuMa uses one gene annotation, avoiding mismatches caused by tool-specific
gene annotations. FuMa matches 10% more fusion genes compared with exact gene matching due
to overlapping genes and accepts intermediate output files that allow a stepwise analysis of corres-
ponding tools.

1 Introduction

A new generation of bioinformatics tools has been released that
aims to detect fusion genes within RNA-seq data; however, the cur-
rent tools are limited in either sensitivity or specificity, making their
results impractical for downstream analysis and subsequent valid-
ation (Carrara et al., 2013). As shown in other domains of high
throughput sequencing analysis, using a consensus of tools may im-
prove performance by compensating for individual tool error pro-
files (Ewing et al., 2015; Goode et al., 2013). Since no single tool
shows superior detection performance, a consensus-based fusion
gene detection in RNA-seq can improve both downstream analysis
as well as overall performance. Moreover, to identify limiting fac-
tors and promote improvement of current algorithms, an accurate
estimation of sensitivity and specificity is required, for which an ac-
curate fusion gene comparison is crucial. Therefore, comparing

validated and in silico predicted fusion genes in an automated fash-
ion and summarizing identical fusion genes in two or more datasets
in an easy and accessible way is a desirable feature.

Ideally, sensitivity/specificity estimation should be based upon
the identified genomic breakpoints provided as two chromosomal
locations. However, the nature of RNA-seq complicates this strat-
egy, as reads may span exon junctions and breakpoints are more
likely to be expected in introns because of their relative large size,
introducing additional uncertainty when trying to pinpoint the exact
genomic position of the DNA breakpoint. For instance, using exact
position-based matching (EPM) results in poor overlap between
tools (Supplementary Section S6). A less conservative strategy used
in DNA-seq analysis involves comparing genomic intervals (Layer
et al., 2014), which can be defined by adding ﬂanking regions to

each breakpoint to increase the likelihood of matching fusion events
called by multiple programs. In RNA-seq analysis this strategy is
also not sufficient, because the intervals are not related to the organ-
ization of the transcriptome. In addition, transcriptome annotations
differ substantially between sources which frequently result in
inconsistent results in RNA-seq analysis (Zhao and Zhang, 2015),
intron sizes are differing and lastly, a substantial number of genes do
overlap with each other (Sanna et al., 2008) due to opposite strand
positioning. Therefore, we designed a new method, FuMa, which
boosts the current fusion gene matching functionality of the
Chimera package (Beccuti et al., 2014), to address the challenges
outlined above.

2 Methods

Here, we present FuMa, a computer program that reports identical
fusion genes detected in RNA-seq, where matching is based on a
user provided gene-name annotation. For two or more datasets,
FuMa enlists all possible combinations of datasets that can be com-
pared with each other. The iterative procedure starts by comparing
all 2-dataset combinations. Every such comparison results in a new
virtual dataset, containing only the matching fusion genes.
Consequently, for comparisons with a larger number of datasets, in-
put datasets and merged datasets will be compared with each other
such that all possible combinations are tested, by comparing only
two virtual datasets at a time.

Because several factors complicate matching using genomic
positions, our solution is based on gene-name comparisons. Each
breakpoint of a fusion gene consists of two genomic locations.
We define the genomic locations of a breakpoint as left and right,
where left < right, while sorting is applied first on chromosome
name and, in case of equality, on genomic position. When the left
and right locations are identical to the lexicographical order, we
denote the acceptor—donor order as forward, otherwise as re-
verse. For each fusion gene a list of genes overlapping each asso-
ciated genomic location from the user provided gene annotation
(BED format) is added with the HTSeq library (Anders et al.,
2015). This step ensures that all fusion genes are annotated with
consistent genomic identifiers rather than those provided by the
detection tools themselves. Since genes frequently overlap and
multiple genes may be annotated upon one location, we add
genes as a list to use them for set-theory-based matching rather
than exact gene matching (EGM). FuMa has two matching meth-
ods, subset-based matching (FuMa-s, default) and overlap-based
matching (FuMa-o) further explained in Supplementary Section
S1 and S2. Using FuMa-s, matching within any two datasets
(both input- versus input- and input- versus merged dataset) is
applied as follows:

° For each fusion gene in both datasets, remove entries that do not
have gene annotations associated to both locations.

° Per dataset, merge duplicates such that a dataset contains only
unique fusion genes. Two fusion genes are considered a duplicate
by the match-function, which will later be explained as criterion
used for matching fusion genes.

° Iterate over all fusion genes in both datasets such that all fusion
genes of the ﬁrst dataset are compared with all fusion genes of
the second dataset. Assessing whether two fusion genes are iden-
tical is done by the match-function where two fusion genes are
considered identical if: one of the left gene lists is a subset of the
other left gene list AND one of the right gene lists is a subset of
the other (Supplementary Table S1). Depending on the chosen

parameters, the order of the genomic locations (forward or re-
verse) or the strands of the breakpoint may be taken into account
as additional constraints. The comparison of any two virtual
datasets will produce a ‘merged’ dataset that only includes
matched fusion genes present in both input datasets. When two
fusion genes match, the left and right gene sets of a matched fu-
sion gene will be the intersect of the left or right gene sets of the
input fusion genes. The intersect is chosen over the union to pre-
vent gene lists from ‘growing’ after multiple iterations of match-
ing (Supplementary Section 52).

3 Results

FuMa was tested on publicly available data (Berger et al., 2010;
Edgren et al., 2011) and results provided as part of the Chimera
package (Beccuti et al., 2014) (Supplementary Section S6).
Concordance of the matching methods was assessed using RefSeq
gene annotation. While EPM reported less than half of the overlaps
of FuMa, EGM performed better but was still outmatched by
FuMa. Specifically, EGM missed 11.1—15.4% of the fusion genes
due to not accounting for overlapping genes (Fig. 1) and import-
antly, five of the missed fusions had been validated. FuMa-o also re-
ported a matching intergenic fusion event in a large gene that likely
represents a false positive.

4 Discussion and conclusion

Accurate comparisons of identical fusion genes between different al-
gorithms are desirable to increase confidence in in silico predictions
and to allow performance analyses as well as in-depth evaluations of
the algorithms used. Therefore, we developed FuMa, a software
package that makes use of a gene name and set-theory-based strat-
egy, taking into account the transcriptome to reduce uncertainty and
produce a human and computer understandable output
(Supplementary Section SS). FuMa is publicly available, available
for Galaxy (Goecks et al., 2010) and available as R package compat-
ible with Chimera (Beccuti et al., 2014). FuMa focuses on compar-
ing breakpoints within annotated genes and is more sensitive
compared with EPM and EGM. In addition, FuMa can handle inter-
mediate results of several detection tools and thereby allows an
evaluation of the interim steps of an algorithm. Last, we find limited
overlap between ChimeraScan, Defuse and FusionMap (Ge et al.,
2011; Iyer et al., 2011; McPherson et al., 2011) in the Edgren data-
set (Supplementary Fig. S4), which is in line with earlier reports
(Beccuti et al., 2014) indicating that further improvements in detect-
ing fusion genes in RNA-seq data are needed.

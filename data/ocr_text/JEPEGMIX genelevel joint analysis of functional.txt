Abstract

Motivation: To increase detection power, gene level analysis methods are used to aggregate weak
signals. To greatly increase computational efficiency, most methods use as input summary statis-
tics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Subsequently, gene statistics are constructed
using linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns from a relevant reference panel. However, all methods,
including our own Joint Effect on Phenotype of eOTL/functional single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) associated with a Gene (JEPEG), assume homogeneous panels, e.g. European. However,
this renders these tools unsuitable for the analysis of large cosmopolitan cohorts.

Results: We propose a JEPEG extension, JEPEGMIX, which similar to one of our software tools,
Direct lmputation of summary STatistics of unmeasured SNPs from MlXed ethnicity cohorts, is cap-
able of estimating accurate LD patterns for cosmopolitan cohorts. JEPEGMIX uses this accurate LD es-
timates to (i) impute the summary statistics at unmeasured functional variants and (ii) test for the joint
effect of all measured and imputed functional variants which are associated with a gene. We illustrate
the performance of our tool by analyzing the GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics from the multi-
ethnic Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Schizophrenia stage 2 cohort. This practical application sup-
ports the immune system being one of the main drivers of the process leading to schizophrenia.

1 Introduction

 

Univariate analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
has emerged as the main tool for identifying trait/disease-associated
genetic variants (Burton et al., 2007). However, most variants re-
ported by complex trait GWAS are common single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) with weak or moderate effect sizes, which
account for only a small fraction of the overall phenotypic
variation (Manolio et al., 2009). This is due to the fact that, due
to their small effect sizes, most common causal variants are unlikely
to be detected in GWAS (Yang et al., 2010).

A reasonable approach to increase the power to detect true asso-
ciation signals with small effect sizes is to aggregate them by jointly
analyzing multiple SNPs. To leverage information from multiple
SNPs, multivariate association tests (Ehret et al., 2012; Wood et al.,
2011; Yang et al., 2012) have been also proposed. However, these
methods typically test all SNPs, regardless of their functionality.

Given that functional SNPs are likely to jointly impact on gene ex-
pression, to increase detection power, our group proposed JEPEG

a Gene; Lee et al., 2015b), which (i) uses only summary association
statistics, (ii) imputes summary statistics of unmeasured functional
SNPs and (iii) boosts detection power by jointly analyzing measured
and imputed functional variants. However, similar to direct imput-
ation methods based on summary statistics, e.g. DIST (Lee et al.,
2013) and ImpG (Pasaniuc et al., 2014), it is only applicable to homo-
geneous cohorts. To overcome this limitation, concurrently with
Adapt-Mix (Park et al., 2015) and DISSCO (Xu et al., 2015), our
group developed DISTMIX (Direct Imputation of summary STatistics
of unmeasured SNPs from MIXed ethnicity; Lee et al., 2015a). It ex-
tends DIST capabilities to the analysis of mixed ethnicity cohorts by
estimating their linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns as a mixture of
the LD patterns from the constituent ethnicities of large reference
panels, e.g. 1000 Genomes data (1KG) (Altshuler et al., 2010). Here,
for the gene level analysis of the ever more common (and well pow-
ered) mixed ethnicity cohorts, we propose JEPEG for MIXed ethni-
city cohorts (JEPEGMIX), which adapts the LD estimation strategy
used by DISTMIX, while retaining all JEPEG advantages.

2 Methods

Similar to DISTMIX, to accurately estimate LD patterns for mixed eth-
nicity cohorts, JEPEGMIX first estimates the ethnic proportions of
study cohorts using study allele frequency (AF) information [see
Supplementary Text 51 in supplementary data (SD) for details].
(Alternatively, when AF information is not available, user can pre-
specify the proportions based on the ethnic composition information
typically provided by published studies.) Next, using the estimated/user-
specified ethnic proportions, the software estimates LD patterns of the
study cohort as a weighted mixture of the LD matrices of all ethnic
groups in a reference panel (Supplementary Text 52 of SD). Finally, it
uses these estimated mixture LD patterns and association summary stat-
istics to (i), when necessary, rapidly and accurately impute summary
statistics of unmeasured functional SNPs (Supplementary Text S3 of
SD) and (ii) jointly test the effect of measured and imputed functional
SNPs associated with each gene (Supplementary Text S4 of SD).

3 Results

To estimate false positive rates, null hypothesis cosmopolitan cohorts
were simulated using haplotypic patterns from 1KG (see
Supplementary Text S5 of SD). When compared with JEPEG,
JEPEGMIX maintains the false positive rates at or below nominal
thresholds (Supplementary Fig. 51 in SD). We obtained gene-level
statistics by applying the method to association summary statistics
from the large-scale cosmopolitan Psychiatric Genomics Consortium
Schizophrenia stage 2 (PGC SCZ2) cohort (Schizophrenia Working
Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014). A subsequent
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (www.ingenuity.com) of the 61 signifi-
cant JEPEGMIX genes (Supplementary Table 51 in SD), i.e. those
with false discovery rate q-values < 0.05, yields a large number of im-
mune pathways and only one (in italics) which is neurologically
related (Table 1). The pattern is maintained even when excluding the
21 genes located in the immune related Major Histocompatibility
(MHC) region from chromosome 6p (Supplementary Table 52).

4 Conclusions

For multi-ethnic cohorts, unlike existing methods, JEPEGMIX con-
trols the Type I error rates at or below nominal levels. Due to ridge
adjustment being inversely related to the size of 1KG relevant

subpopulations (Supplementary Text S2 of SD), at present the method
is rather conservative. However, the conservativeness is expected to
become negligible with the advent of extremely large reference panels
(http://www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org). Thus, to the capa-
bilities of JEPEG, JEPEGMIX adds the much needed applicability to
the analysis of large cosmopolitan cohorts, which are the state-of—the-
art in detecting genetic signals. For such cohorts, it (i) imputes un-
measured functional SNPs, (ii) pools in a synthetic variable the infor-
mation of measured and imputed SNPs from the same functional
category and (iii) combines these synthetic variables in a gene-level
Mahalanobis test. JEPEGMIX application to PGC SCZ2 cohort sug-
gests that, in the etiology of SCZ, the immune system might play a
more substantial role than currently accepted.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Advances in typing methodologies have recently reformed
the field of molecular epidemiology of pathogens. The falling cost of
sequencing technologies is creating a deluge of whole genome
sequencing data that burdens bioinformatics resources and tool de-
velopment. In particular, single nucleotide polymorphisms in core gen-
omes of pathogens are recognized as the most important markers for
inferring genetic relationships because they are evolutionarily stable
and amenable to high-throughput detection methods. Sequence data
will provide an excellent opportunity to extend our understanding of
infectious disease when the challenge of extracting knowledge from
available sequence resources is met. Here, we present an efficient and
user-friendly genotype classiﬁcation pipeline, CanSNPer, based on an
easily expandable database of predefined canonical single nucleotide
polymorphisms.

Availability and implementation: All documentation and Python-
based source code for the CanSNPer are freely available at http://

1 INTRODUCTION

Whole genome sequencing of pathogen isolates will continue to
improve epidemiological investigations and microbial forensics
through the ability to reconstruct genetic relationships among
isolates. The vast amount of information generated by whole
genome sequencing can overcome the hurdles of other less-
informative rich epidemiological typing methods in establishing
genetic relationships among pathogens. The overall goal is to
identify similarities among strains that are a result of vertically
inherited variation indicative of recent common descent.
Confounding sources of polymorphisms must, however, be
addressed, including sequencing errors and sequence polymorph-
isms introduced through horizontal transfer of sequences by both
homologous and non-homologous recombination. No single
typing method handles all levels of bacterial diversity.
Multilocus sequence typing has been used for a decade as a port-
able sequence-based method for identifying clonal relationships
among bacteria with various amount of recombination. In highly
monomorphic and slowly evolving bacterial species such as

M ycobacterium tuberculosis or Bacillus anthracis, identiﬁcation
of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in comparison
with a deﬁned archetypal strain, could provide more robust phyl-
ogeny and higher resolution. In such pathogens, the inheritance
pattern of speciﬁc sets of SNPs is strictly clonal (Achtman, 2012).
Several SNP detection technologies developed for this purpose
over the past decades, e.g. based on real-time PCR or micro-
arrays are predicted to be replaced by next-generation sequen-
cing. For example, relationships among isolates of Francisella
tularensis, Coxiella burnetii, Yersinz'a pestis and Bunthracis are
amenable for characterization using speciﬁc sets of SNPs, often
denoted canonical SNPs (canSNPs). It has been demonstrated
that a small number of SNPs can be used to deﬁne genetic
groups efﬁciently and to infer evolutionary relationships within
F.tularensis (Chanturia et al., 2011; Gyuranecz et al., 2012;
Karlsson et al., 2013; Svensson et al., 2009; Vogler et al., 2009,
2011a), C.burnetii (Hornstra et al., 2011; Karlsson et al., 2014),
Y.pestis (Morelli et al., 2010; Vogler et al., 2011b) and
Bunthracis (Okinaka et al., 2008; Simonson et al., 2009; Van
Ert et al., 2007).

Using the new low-cost sequencing technology for SNP detec-
tion, there are vast amounts of data that can be used to
characterize an isolate and its relationship with others. Whole-
genome sequence typing is a powerful tool for genotyping and
molecular epidemiological analysis but not completely accessible
for scientists with limited computer skills (Engelthaler et al.,
2011; Gillece et al., 2011; O’Farrell et al., 2012). The current
bottleneck is time and computationally intensive generation of
high-quality genome sequences. To take advantage of the new
low-cost sequencing technology, sequence information must be
presented and analyzed in a way that, for example, public health
experts in epidemiology can easily interpret. Therefore,
alternative methods are needed for Whole-genome sequence
typing data to be used in real time. Here, we present an analysis
pipeline for easy genotype classiﬁcation of clonal pathogens. This
program should have vast applications in clinical genomic re-
search and will aid the expanding efforts to identify and trace
pathogens during outbreaks.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

We developed a pipeline for the analysis of canonical SNPs in
draft genomes of clonal pathogens. CanSNPer is a fast and light-
weight tool written in Python for genotype classiﬁcation of
pathogens based on canonical SNPs. A user-customizable

conﬁguration ﬁle speciﬁes all parameter settings. Installation in-
structions are provided with the software distribution together
with sample data and expected outputs. CanSNPer has depen-
dencies on external software progressiveMauve (Darling et al.,
2010) and The Environment for Tree Exploration toolkit
(Huerta-Cepas et al., 2010). CanSNPer analysis could also be
performed directly in a web browser as a Galaxy tool
(Blankenberg et al., 2010; Giardine et al., 2005; Goecks et al.,
2010).

2.1 Building reference canSNP database

CanSNPer uses a local SQLite3 database to store information
on canonical SNPs, the canSNP tree structure and reference
sequences for each organism. The local database is created
by the user, using a series of CanSNPer arguments.
Preconstructed typing schemes for Y.pestis, F .tularensis,
B.anthracis and C.burnetii are available for download with the
software. Users may extend the local database by creating their
own typing schemes in CanSNPer according to a predeﬁned spe-
ciﬁcation. The tree speciﬁcation ﬁle must only contain the root
of the tree on the ﬁrst line, and each node in the tree has its own
line with all its ancestors listed, separated by semicolon in order.

2.2 Classiﬁcation of sequences

CanSNPer is designed to easily extract known canonical SNPs
from a query draft sequence for classiﬁcation of the pathogen
isolate. The query is aligned to reference genomes for the selected
reference organism using progressiveMauve (Darling et al.,
2010). CanSNPer will by default run all alignments in parallel
for a signiﬁcant speed increase if there are many reference se-
quences to a single organism. The state of each canSNP is deter-
mined, and the canSNP tree is traversed to ﬁnd a classiﬁcation.
The pipeline uses a recursive and greedy tree walking algorithm
and can classify a query sequence as either a leaf or as an inter-
mediate node, if no more canSNPs could be determined as
derived. The tree walking algorithm is also designed to handle
the forcing of a number of nodes. If a region is missing in the
query sequence in which one of the canSNPs is located,
CanSNPer can be set to allow a mismatch in the tree and still
ﬁnd a classiﬁcation if there are derived canSNPs further down
the tree.

2.3 Visual genotype presentation

A visual representation of all SNPs in the canonical SNP tree for
the query sequence can easily be generated. The visualization
uses the Environment for Tree Exploration toolkit for Python
(Huerta-Cepas et al., 2010) to draw a phylogenetic canonical
SNP tree (Fig. 1). The complete canSNP tree for the analyzed
genome sequence is visualized, and the derived SNP variants are
indicated by larger ﬁlled circles.

3 CONCLUSION

The ability of rapid and cost-efﬁcient generation of whole
genome sequence data of pathogens will transform treatment
and epidemiological studies once clinicians have access to user-
friendly analysis tools. We have presented the CanSNPer

software written in Python to automatically genotype clonal bac-
terial pathogens using genome sequencing data. The identiﬁca-
tion of strain-speciﬁc SNP markers in pathogens permits the
development of rapid diagnostics to greatly assist in the investi-
gation of biocrimes and natural outbreaks that may require the
analysis of hundreds or even thousands of specimens, including
environmental and clinical samples. The database can be easily
modiﬁed to handle other organisms of interest or similar SNP
classiﬁcation problems, such as cancer samples. Of interest for
future improvements of the pipeline is the optimization of the
classiﬁcation algorithm and adding additional organisms.

In conclusion, our strategy permits the identiﬁcation of SNPs
that are diagnostic for narrowly deﬁned pathogen genetic lin-
eages. The use of strain-speciﬁc SNPs for high-throughput gen-
otyping may prove to be a valuable tool to assist in real-world
forensic and epidemiological studies.

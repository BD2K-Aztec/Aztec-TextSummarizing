ABSTRACT

Motivation: One common task in structural biology is to assess the
similarities and differences among protein structures. A variety of
structure alignment algorithms and programs has been designed
and implemented for this purpose. A major drawback with existing
structure alignment programs is that they require a large amount of
computational time, rendering them infeasible for pairwise alignments
on large collections of structures. To overcome this drawback, a frag-
ment alphabet learned from known structures has been introduced.
The method, however, considers local similarity only, and therefore
occasionally assigns high scores to structures that are similar only in
local fragments.

Method: We propose a novel approach that eliminates false posi-
tives, through the comparison of both local and remote similarity,
with little compromise in speed. Two kinds of contact libraries
(ContactLib) are introduced to fingerprint protein structures effectively
and efficiently. Each contact group of the contact library consists of
one local or two remote fragments and is represented by a concise
vector. These vectors are then indexed and used to calculate a new
combined hit-rate score to identify similar protein structures effectively
and efficiently.

Results: We tested our method on the high-quality protein structure
subset of SCOP30 containing 3297 protein structures. For each
protein structure of the subset, we retrieved its neighbor protein struc-
tures from the rest of the subset. The best area under the Receiver-
Operating Characteristic curve, archived by ContactLib, is as high as
0.960. This is a significant improvement compared with 0.747, the best
result achieved by FragBag. We also demonstrated that incorporating
remote contact information is critical to consistently retrieve accurate
neighbor protein structures for all-,8 query protein structures.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although assessing the similarities and differences between
protein structures is a common practice in structural biology,
efﬁciently performing this comparison is critical in some appli-
cations. For example, once a new protein structure is determined,
researchers often need to infer its function or evolution by study-
ing proteins of similar structures. A few databases, such as
SCOP (Chandonia et al., 2004; Murzin et al., 1995) and

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

CATH (Orengo et al., 1997), maintain hierarchical classiﬁcations
of known protein structures. The need to obtain structures simi-
lar to the new protein from these databases motivates the neigh-
b0r protein structure retrieval problem: given a query protein
structure and a database of protein structures, retrieve all the struc-
tures in the database that are similar to the query structure.

One intuitive solution to the neighbor protein structure re-
trieval problem is to align the query protein structure and
every protein structure of the database using a pairwise protein
structure alignment tool. One successful approach of pairwise
protein structure alignment is to represent protein structures as
3D coordinates and to ﬁnd the optimal residue mapping and
orientation (rotation and translation) together, as stralign
(Akutsu, 1996), Combinatorial Extension (CE) (Shindyalov
and Bourne, 1998), Local-Global Alignment (LGA) (Zemla,
2003), secondary-structure matching (SSM) (Krissinel and
Henrick, 2004), TMalign (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) and
SPalign (Yang et al., 2012) proposed. An orientation-free ap-
proach is possible by encoding each structure as a 2D matrix
of residue—residue interaction distances; comparison between
two structures can be performed by an ‘alignment’ of their re-
spective matrices as proposed in DALI (Holm and Sander,
1993). One drawback of adopting these approaches is inefﬁ-
ciency, especially when the protein structure database is large.
Either using 3D coordinates or using distance matrices, solving
the pairwise protein structure alignment problem is NP-hard
(Kolodny and Linial, 2004). Thus, all the aforementioned pair-
wise protein structure alignment tools adopt heuristic approaches
without global optimality guarantee. Unfortunately, such heur-
istic approaches are still time-consuming (Aung and Tan, 2007;
Kolodny et al., 2005).

The concern for efﬁciency has prompted the use of 1D protein
structure proﬁles, which often perform well. In particular, the
current state-of—the-art method called FragBag (Budowski-Tal
et al., 2010) has been shown experimentally to be fast and accur-
ate on average. Speciﬁcally, FragBag represents a protein struc-
ture as a proﬁle that contains counts of structure fragments in a
fragment alphabet learned from known structures. Then, neigh-
bor protein structures can be retrieved by comparing the proﬁles
efﬁciently. One drawback, however, is that although FragBag is
capable of delivering good average accuracy, its accuracy is
sometimes signiﬁcantly worse than the average accuracy, as
shown in Section 3.1. This accuracy drop occurs when two struc-
tures are similar in many local fragments but differ signiﬁcantly
in their overall structure; because FragBag compares only local
contacts, it fails to identify the large non-local discrepancy in
these structures.

In this article, we present ContactLib, a complete contact
group library deﬁned in Section 2, which is to be used as ﬁnger-
prints of protein structures. FragBag (Budowski-Tal et al., 2010)
and local feature frequency proﬁle (LFFP) (Choi et al., 2004) are
two promising tools that are closely related. Our ContactLib is
different from FragBag and LFFP in following ways: (i)
FragBag and LFFP are developed on general structure frag-
ments, whereas ContactLib introduces both local and remote
contact groups eliminating potentially weak contact groups; (ii)
FragBag and LFFP use 3D coordinates or 2D distance matrices,
whereas ContactLib introduces lD distance vectors that can be
efﬁciently indexed; (iii) FragBag and LFFP require a predeﬁned
word alphabet, whereas ContactLib avoids such word alphabet
and introduces some freedom of specifying similarity thresholds
at runtime; and (iv) FragBag and LFFP use word frequency
proﬁles and distance functions from the text information re-
trieval problem, whereas ContactLib introduces a combined
hit-rate scoring function for the neighbor protein structure re-
trieval problem. Because the word alphabet of LFFP is not pub-
licly available, we focus on comparing ContactLib and FragBag
in this article.

As an initial study, we built two ContactLibs: ContactLib-9L,
which models local contacts, and ContactLib-3R, which models
remote contacts. Using one or both of ContactLib-9L and
ContactLib-3R, we tested our method on the high-quality protein
structure subset of SCOP30 (Chandonia et al., 2004; Murzin et al.,
1995) containing 3297 protein structures. For each protein struc-
ture, we retrieved its neighbor protein structures from the rest.

According to the Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curve analysis (Fawcett, 2006) in Section 3.1, the best area
under the ROC curve (AUROC), archived by ContactLib, is
as high as 0.960. This is a signiﬁcant improvement compared
with 0.747, the best result achieved by FragBag (Budowski-Tal
et al., 2010). Speciﬁcally, when ContactLib-3R is used, 75% of
the AUROCs is >0.936 and the lowest AUROC is 0.504. When
ContactLib-9L is used, 75% of the AUROCs are >0.823 and 3%
of the AUROCs are <0.5. However, when FragBag is used, 75%
of the AUROCs are >0.657 and 10% of the AUROCs are <0.5.
Therefore, the worst-case AUROC is signiﬁcantly improved by
using ContactLib, and ContactLib-3R is even able to guarantee
an AUROC higher than a random method, which has an
AUROC equals to 0.5.

We also demonstrated that incorporating remote contact in-
formation is critical to consistently retrieve accurate neighbor
protein structures for all-,8 query protein structures, which is
more challenging than that for all-or query protein structures,
in Section 3.2. Moreover, we demonstrated that if two contact
groups have similar structures with low root mean square devi-
ation (RMSD) values, they tend to have similar distance vectors,
which are used to index contact groups, in Section 3.3. Finally,
we discussed several future extensions and applications of
ContactLib in Section 4.

2 CONTACTLIB NEIGHBOR PROTEIN
STRUCTURE RETRIEVAL

In this section, we ﬁrst deﬁne a contact group. Then, we build a
comprehensive library of contact groups as ﬁngerprints of all

existing protein structures and we call such a contact group li-
brary ContactLib. We also propose an indexing technique for
ContactLib, which may be applied to neighbor contact group
retrieval. Finally, we introduce a combined hit-rate score to
retrieve neighbor protein structures.

A contact group in this article refers to a small collection of
residues that may have a high density of contacts among the
residues. As two residues in contact should not be far apart,
we require that all residues are within a sphere. The position of
each residue here is represented by its Co, atom. A local contact
group models contact within a protein structure fragment and a
remote contact group could involve two or more structure frag-
ments. Owing to chemical and physical constraints within limited
sphere space, it is rare for a contact group to contain a large
number of fragments. For conciseness, we require a remote con-
tact group to involve exactly two fragments. Hence, we deﬁne a
contact group as follows:

DEFINITION 1 (contact group): a contact group is a set of residues,
represented by the respective C, atoms, of either a single fragment
with l1 residues, called a local contact group, or a pair of fragments
with l2 residues, called a remote contact group, such that all the C,
atoms are located within a sphere of radius r.

Here, we set [1 = 9 and I2 = 3 as we ﬁnd that they are sufﬁ-
cient to accurately model a local and a remote contact group,
respectively. The fragment length of nine has also been used and
shown to be the optimal fragment length to model protein struc-
ture fragments (Maadooliat et al., 2012; Simons et al., 1997).
Moreover, the radius of the sphere is set to be r = 16 A, so
that it is large enough to capture most contacts. Then, we
deﬁne a ContactLib as follows:

DEFINITION 2 (ContactLib): a ContactLib is a contact group
library containing local and/or remote contact groups in all protein
structures of the search protein structure database.

We use the contact groups to ﬁngerprint protein structures. To
create an efﬁcient and effective index of the ContactLib, we
devise a strategy to represent a contact group by a low-dimen-
sional vector. Before deﬁning such a representation, we examine
the number of dimensions or the degree of freedom of a contact
group; that is, we want to know how many values are necessary
to reconstruct a contact group.

We determine the dimension of a contact group as follows: a
protein structure can be represented by bond angles, bond
lengths and dihedral angles (Cui et al., 2013; Rice and
Brunger, 1994). The ﬁxed bond length and bond angle structures
have been widely used in modeling protein structures (Canutescu
et al., 2003; Guntert and Wuthrich, 1991; Li et al., 2008; Simons
et al., 1997). The peptide dihedral angles (i.e the S2 angles) are
also rounded to either 0 or JT. Because <2% of the S2 dihedral
angles have a value closer to 0, it is treated as a rare case (Engh
and Huber, 2006). Hence, it is acceptable to use S2 2 It as a good
approximation, which results in the distance between two adja-
cent Co, atoms to be 3.8 A. If we connect any two adjacent C,
atoms by such a pseudo bond, the number of dihedral angles in
this pseudo molecule of a local contact group is [1 — 3, and the
number of bond angles in it is [1 — 2. Thereafter, the dimension
required to represent a local contact group is 2l1 — 5 = 13.

Fingerprinting protein structures effectively and efficiently

 

Similarly, the number of dihedral angles in the pseudo molecule
of a remote contact group is 2l2 — 3, the number of bond angles
in it is 2l2 — 2 and the number of bond lengths between non-
adjacent C, atoms in it is l. Thereafter, the dimension
required to represent a remote contact group is
(2l2 — 3) —l— (2l2 — 2) —l— l = 4l2 — 4 = 8. The number of dimen-
sions is proportional to the number of residues in the contact
group.

Given the desired number of dimensions, we create distance
vectors to represent contact groups. Denote D(a, b) as the dis-
tance between two points a and b. Given a local contact group of
a single protein structure fragment {P1, P2, ..., P11}, the distance
vector is deﬁned as

V1={D(P,-,P,-+g)11:i,i+g 5 mg: 2’2k :1}

For a remote contact group of a protein structure fragment pair
{P1,P1, ...,P}2,P2,P2,...,P122}, we deﬁne the distance vector as
follows:

D(P},P}+2)|1 51,14 2 512

D(Pf, P3+2)|1 5 i, i + 2 512
D(P},P§+1)|1§i<l2

D(P§,P}+,)|1 5 i<l2

D(Pl,» Pi)

D(Pi , Pl)

Here, V1 and V2 have 13 dimensions and 8 dimensions, respect-
ively. In addition, our deﬁnition of V1 and V2 covers different
types of distances (as shown in Fig. la and b). One critical fea-
ture of V1 and V2 is that if two contact groups have similar
structures with low RMSD, they should have similar pairwise
distances (Hohn and Sander, 1993) and hence similar V1 or V2,
as described in Section 3.3.

The number of similar contact groups shared by two proteins
can be used as an indicator of their structure similarity. Here, we
introduce an index to efﬁciently ﬁnd all contact groups that are
similar to a query contact group in ContactLib by using a l3-by-
256 table of bit vectors for a local ContactLib and an 8-by-256
table of bit vectors for a remote ContactLib. Here, each row of
the table represents a dimension of the distance vector. For each
dimension of the distance vector, the value space is discretized
into 256 bins, and each column represents a bin. Each element of
the table is a bit vector indicating if a contact group belongs to
the associated bin on the associated dimension for all contact
groups of the ContactLib. Then, these tables can be effectively
used to retrieve the set of contact groups in a particular bin along
a given dimension. Contact groups in m consecutive bins along a
particular dimension (or column) can be calculated by bitwise
OR operations, and then contact groups in m consecutive bins
along all dimensions (or rows) can be calculated by bitwise AND
operations. Here, we carefully choose a parameter m, such that
contact groups similar to the query contact group are within m
bins from the query bins along each dimension.

To compare two structures, we introduce a combined hit-rate
score to rank and select protein structures in the search database.
We observed that, for a pair of similar protein structures, most of
the contact groups for one structure tend to have similar contact
groups from the other structure. Conversely, for a pair of dis-
similar protein structures, the opposite scenario was observed.

Local contact group Remote contact group

Fig. 1. Captured distances of local and remote contact groups: each circle
represents a C0, atom, each solid line represents a pseudo bond between
two adjacent C, atoms (captured implicitly in our distance vector)
and each dashed line represents a distance captured by our distance
vector

These observations suggest a combined hit-rate score for a pair
of protein structures, as the geometric mean of the similar con-
tact group hit-rates of the two protein structures:

5: @112
n1 n2

where h1 is the number of hit contact groups for the ﬁrst protein
structure that have similar contact groups from the second pro-
tein structure, h2 is the number of hit contact groups for the
second protein structure that have similar contact groups from
the ﬁrst protein structure, n1 is the number of contact groups for
the ﬁrst protein structure and n2 is the number of contact groups
for the second protein structure.

In summary, we ﬁnd all pairs of neighbor contact groups be-
tween the query protein structure and the search database using
our indexes of ContactLib, and then we calculate the combined
hit-rate score to rank and select protein structures in the search
database. Let p be the number of contact groups in a query, q be
the number of contact groups in the database and N be the
number of structures in the database. Recall that m is the
number of consecutive bins that deﬁnes similarity on a dimen-
sion of the distance vector, and lis the dimension of the distance
vector. For each query contact group, 0(m) bitwise OR oper-
ations and 0(l) bitwise AND operations are performed, and each
bitwise OR or AND operation takes 0(q) time. Thus, the run-
time complexity to ﬁnd all similar contact group pairs between
the query protein structure and the search database is
0(pq(m + l)), and the combined hit-rate scores can be calculated
simultaneously. Moreover, the runtime complexity to rank struc-
tures according to the combined hit-rate scores is 0(N log N).
Therefore, the running time for our neighbor protein structure
retrieval method is 0(pqm + N log N). Here, the indexes can be
prebuilt, and the runtime complexity is not included.

3 RESULT

For performance analysis of our neighbor protein structure
retrieval program, we used the high-quality protein structure
subset of SCOP30 1.75B (Chandonia et al., 2004; Murzin
et al., 1995) that has a minimum Summary PDB ASTRAL
Check Index (SPACI) of 0.5. In this article, we simply refer
this dataset as SCOP30. Then, we built the local contact group
library, ContactLib-9L, and the remote contact group library,
ContactLib-3R, of SCOP30. For each protein structure of

SCOP30, we retrieved its neighbor protein structures from the
rest of SCOP30. For reference, there are 3297 protein structures
in SCOP30, 375 299 local contact groups in ContactLib-9L and
6 309 469 remote contact groups in ContactLib-3R.

To ﬁnd neighbor protein structures of each query protein
structure, we used SCOP (Murzin et al., 1995) and the best align-
ment found by six popular protein structure alignment tools:
DALI (Holm and Sander, 1993), CE (Shindyalov and Bourne,
1998), LGA (Zemla, 2003), SSM (Krissinel and Henrick, 2004),
TMalign (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) and SPalign (Yang et al.,
2012). Speciﬁcally, we considered two protein structures as
neighbors if and only if both protein structures are from the
same SCOP superfamily and the best pairwise structure align-
ment has a structure alignment score (SAS) (Kolodny et al.,
2005) below 2.0 A. Such neighbor protein structures tend to
have globally similar structures and functional features, but are
not necessary to have similar sequences. Because different SCOP
levels and SAS thresholds conduct similar conclusions, we focus
on the aforementioned neighbor protein structure deﬁnition in
this article. For the best alignments with SAS below 2.0 A, 50%
are contributed by SPalign, 31% are contributed by LGA and
16% are contributed by SSM.

The accuracy of neighbor protein structure retrieval is evalu-
ated by the AUROC, which has been used in many research
areas (Fawcett, 2006), including the protein structure alignment
area (Budowski-Tal et al., 2010; Kolodny et al., 2005). For in-
stance, an AUROC of 0.9 means that a neighbor protein struc-
ture should be scored higher than a non-neighbor protein
structure with a probability of 0.9, and a random method has
an AUROC equals to 0.5. When the query protein structure does
not have any neighbor protein structures in SCOP30, the
AUROC is not deﬁned. Thus, such cases are eliminated in our
analysis.

3.1 General ROC curve analysis

In this experiment, we demonstrate that ContactLib signiﬁcantly
outperforms FragBag for the neighbor protein structure retrieval
problem in terms of AUROC. For ContactLib-9L and
ContactLib-3R, we tested m 6 {2,4, 8, 16, 32, 64} (recall that m
is the number of neighboring bins we should use around the
query bin along each dimension). For FragBag, we tested the
bag-of—words datasets of lengths between 9 and 12 and of all
sizes from the FragBag Web site (Budowski-Tal et al., 2010).

The AUROC of our combined hit-rate score, using
ContactLib-9L and ContactLib-3R, are shown in Figure 2a.
We see that the best accuracy of ContactLib-9L is achieved
when m = 32, where the average AUROC is 0.876. Moreover,
the best accuracy of ContactLib-3R is achieved when m = 8,
where the average AUROC is 0.956. Thus, the best result for
ContactLib-3R is 9% more accurate on average than that for
ContactLib-9L. This indicates that remote contacts carry critical
information that is not carried by local contacts and are capable
of identifying neighbor protein structures more accurately.

The AUROC of the neighbor protein structure retrieval that
deﬁned on different SAS thresholds are also shown in Figure 2a.
Speciﬁcally, when the SAS threshold of 3.5 A is used, the best
average AUROCs of ContactLib-3R and ContactLib-9L are
0.918 and 0.819, respectively; when the SAS threshold of 5.0 A

Fig. 2. ROCcurve analysis: (a) the highest average AUROC is 0.876
when the ContactLib-9L with m = 32 is used; the highest average
AUROC is 0.956 when the ContactLib-3R with m = 8 is used; (b) the
highest average AUROC is 0.747 when the FragBag with an Euclidean
distance function, a fragment length of 10 and a bag size of 100 is used

is used, the best average AUROCs of ContactLib-3R and
ContactLib-9L are 0.906 and 0.804. Moreover, the AUROC of
the neighbor protein structure retrieval that deﬁned on different
SCOP levels are used in our experiment but not shown here.
Although the results are slightly different, our neighbor protein
structure retrieval method, with either a local or a remote contact
group library, is always capable of delivering high accuracies
with high AUROCs.

We also combined ContactLib-9L and ContactLib-3R to re-
trieve neighbor protein structures from SCOP30 (Chandonia
et al., 2004; Murzin et al., 1995). This is done by linearly com-
bining the score for ContactLib-9L with m = 32 and the score
for ContactLib-3R with m = 8. When a weight of 1 : 16 is used
between ContactLib-9L and ContactLib-3R, the average
AUROC is improved slightly to the highest value of 0.960.
Thus, ContactLib-3R contributes more than ContactLib-9L to
deliver more accurate results.

For comparison, we tested bag-of—words for FragBag
(Budowski-Tal et al., 2010) with different fragment lengths and
bag sizes as shown in Figure 2b. Different experiment settings,
such as eliminating the query protein structures that do not have

any neighbor protein structures in SCOP30, lead to a few new
observations. First, the Euclidean distance function performs
signiﬁcantly more accurately than the cosine distance function.
Moreover, the choice of FragBag, with different fragment
lengths or different sizes, has no signiﬁcant impact on the accur-
acy obtained. According to our result, the optimal FragBag is the
one with a Euclidean distance function, a fragment length of 10
and a bag size of 100, that has an average AUROC of 0.747.

By comparing Figure 2a and b, we ﬁnd that our ContactLib
outperforms FragBag (Budowski-Tal et al., 2010) in terms of
AUROC. This is further supported by looking at the AUROC
distributions of ContactLib and FragBag in Figure 3.
Speciﬁcally, when ContactLib-3R is used, 75% of the
AUROCs are >0.936 and the lowest AUROC is 0.504. When
ContactLib-9L is used, 75% of the AUROCs are >0.823 and 3%
of the AUROCs are <0.5. However, when FragBag is used, 75%
of the AUROCs are >0.657 and 10% of the AUROCs are <0.5.
Recall that a random method has an AUROC equals to 0.5.
Although FragBag is capable of delivering good average accur-
acy, the worst case may not be acceptable for many accuracy
sensitive applications. In our experiment, the worst-case
AUROC is signiﬁcantly improved by using ContactLib, and
ContactLib-3R is even able to guarantee an AUROC, which is
higher than a random method.

Therefore, the best accuracy is archived when ContactLib-3R
with m = 8 is used. If only the top three ranked protein struc-
tures according to our combined hit-rate score are considered,
there is a probability of 58% that we found at least one neighbor
protein structure. The probability is increased to 73% when only
the top 10 are considered. The excellent result suggests that
ContactLib-3R can be used as a highly accurate and efﬁcient
ﬁlter to remove most unrelated protein structures while keeping
many neighbor protein structures.

3.2 ROC curve analysis of all-or and all-,8 proteins

To understand the inﬂuence of secondary structure to the neigh-
bor protein structure retrieval problem, we studied the AUROC
of those all-or and all-,8 query protein structures in the previous
section. From the 1574 query protein structures in the previous
section, there are 157 all-or protein structures and 313 all-,8 pro-
tein structures.

The AUROCs of our neighbor protein structure retrieval with
ContactLib-3R and ContactLib-9L for m e {2, 4,8, 16, 32, 64}
are shown in Figure 4. Comparing the AUROCs of all-or and
those of all-,8 query protein structures, the AUROCs of all-or
query protein structures tend to be higher. Comparing the
AUROCs of ContactLib-9L and ContactLib-3R, the impact
on the type of query protein structures is signiﬁcantly smaller
when ContactLib-3R is used. This is because our remote contact
groups are also capable of modeling hydrogen bonds in or-helices.
However, local contact groups are incapable of modeling hydro-

Therefore, the neighbor protein structure retrieval problem for
all-,8 query protein structures is more challenging than that for
all-or query protein structures, and incorporating remote contact
information is critical to produce accurate results consistently for
all-or and all-,8 query protein structures.

Fig. 4. ROC curve analysis of all-oz and all-,8 query protein structures: the
AUROCs of all-oz query protein structures tend to be higher than those of
all-,8 query protein structures; the impact on the type of query protein
structures is signiﬁcantly smaller when ContactLib-3R is used than when
ContactLib-9L is used

3.3 Correlation analysis of distance functions

In this experiment, we demonstrated that if two contact groups
have similar structures of low RMSD values, they tend to have
similar distance vectors (deﬁned in Section 2). This was done by
studying the correlations among RMSD, the Euclidean distance
between distance matrices D(lll) and the Euclidean distance be-
tween distance vectors D(V). The data shown in Figure 5 were
collected from similar local contact groups, with RMSD <2.0 A,
from 100 random pairs of proteins, such that each pair of
proteins belonged to the same SCOP domain.

From Figure 5a, we ﬁnd a strong correlation between D(V)
and D(lll) for local contact groups with RMSD <2.0 A. This is
also true for remote contact groups. Speciﬁcally, the correlation
coefﬁcients are 0.98 and 0.96 between D(V) and D(lll) of local
and remote contact groups, respectively. Therefore, our distance
vector is as good as the distance matrix, which is used by the
popular and successful pairwise protein structure alignment tool,
DALI (Holm and Sander, 1993), to capture similar contact
groups.

Although both of RMSD and pairwise distance matrix have
been shown to be capable of capturing similarities between pro-
tein structures, they are not required to have strong correlations.
This is also supported by our results. From Figure 5b, we ﬁnd
that small values of D(V) suggest small values of RMSD among
local contact groups. Speciﬁcally, the correlation coefﬁcient is
0.92 between D(V) and RMSD between local contact groups.
However, neither D(V) nor D(lll) has such strong correlations
to RMSD between remote contact groups, and the correlation
coefﬁcients are ~0.6.

3.4 Running time

Our protein neighbor retrieval program is not only accurate, but
it is also fast. On a computer with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7
2.80GHz CPU, both of our program with ContactLib-9L and
FragBag (Budowski-Tal et al., 2010) ﬁnishes in less than a
second. With ContactLib-3R, our program ﬁnishes in 5.1 s on
average on the same computer. Here, we assumed that our

program was in server mode, such that both ContactLib-9L
and ContactLib-3R were loaded in memory only once. For ref-
erence, note that the ContactLib-9L binary ﬁle has a size of 43
MB and the ContactLib-3R binary ﬁle has a size of 494 MB.
Therefore, when retrieving neighbor protein structures,
ContactLib is capable of delivering a signiﬁcantly faster running
time than pairwise protein structure alignment tools are, with
little compromise in accuracy.

4 DISCUSSION

In conclusion, we have shown that ContactLib is an effective and
efﬁcient neighbor protein structure retrieval method. Most im-
portantly, ContactLib was able to maintain a consistent level of
accuracy in our tests. The key to consistently retrieve accurate
neighbor protein structures for all-,8 query protein structures is
incorporating remote contact information in ContactLib. This is

unmatched by existing neighbor protein structure retrieval
method, FragBag (Budowski—Tal et al., 2010).

However, our method can be improved in several ways. One
possibility is to discover and study new types of contact groups.
We will look for new deﬁnitions of distance vectors representing
remote contact groups based on free energies (Zhou and Zhou,
2002). Another promising extension of ContactLib would be to
use contact groups to improve pairwise protein structure align-
ment tools, such as TMalign (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005). One
such case is provided in Figure 6, which shows two alignments
between SCOP proteins d2cufa1 and d3k2aa_, drawn by The
PyMOL molecular graphics system (Schrédinger, 2010). The
alignment shown in Figure 6b was found by TMalign, and the
alignment shown in Figure 6a was found by our neighbor protein
structure retrieval method with two extra steps. First, we clus-
tered the rotation and transition matrices that yield the RMSD
of similar contact groups between SCOP proteins d2cufa1 and
d3k2aa_, found by our neighbor protein structure retrieval
method. Second, we used the representative rotation and transi-
tion matrix of the largest cluster to generate the alignment.

We will also look for new applications for ContactLib. One
promising application for ContactLib is the ‘structural BLAST’
approach of PrePPI (Dey et al., 2013), whose performance de-
pends mainly on the accuracy and on the speed of its neighbor
protein structure retrieval. Moreover, ContactLib is also capable
of ﬁnding neighbor protein structures if the query protein struc-
ture is only partially known in the process of protein structure
prediction (Zhang et al., 2010) or determination (\Nuthrich,
1990). Then, ContactLib may use the incomplete Co, — Co, pair-
wise distance matrix to ﬁnd template candidates to enable it to
predict or to determine the query protein structure.

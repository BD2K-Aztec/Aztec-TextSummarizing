ABSTRACT

Motivation: Copy number variation (CNV), a major contributor to
human genetic variation, comprises 21 kb genomic deletions and
insertions. Yet, the identification of CNVs from microarray data is
still hampered by high false negative and positive prediction rates
due to the noisy nature of the raw data. Here, we present CNVineta,
an R package for rapid data mining and visualization of CNVs
in large case—control datasets genotyped with single nucleotide
polymorphism oligonucleotide arrays. CNVineta is compatible with
various established CNV prediction algorithms, can be used for
genome-wide association analysis of rare and common CNVs and
enables rapid and serial display of logz of raw data ratios as well
as B-allele frequencies for visual quality inspection. In summary,
CNVineta aides in the interpretation of large-scale CNV datasets and
prioritization of target regions for follow-up experiments.
Availability and Implementation: CNVineta is available as an
R package and can be downloaded from http://www.ikmb.uni-
kiel.de/CNVineta/; the package contains a tutorial outlining a typical
workflow. The CNVineta compatible HapMap dataset can also be
downloaded from the link above.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many recent research ﬁndings suggest that copy number variation
(CNV) plays a major role in genetic variability and hence
human disease (Manolio et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009).
However, while methodologies for large—scale association studies
of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are well established,
a comprehensive framework for the analysis and interpretation of
genome—wide CNV predictions in large case—control datasets is
still lacking (Manolio et al., 2009). CNV prediction algorithms for
data derived from SNP microarrays have improved considerably
over the last few years, but many predicted segments are still
false positives (Winchester et al., 2009) and can only be excluded
through visual inspection in analogy to the mandatory inspection

of genotyping assay scatterplots derived from SNP—based genome—
wide association studies (GWAS; WTCCC, 2007). In addition,
false negative rates tend to be high (Barnes et al., 2008) which
can, for example, cause problems when rare CNV candidates are
overlooked in the data. Current visualization tools such as the
Affymetrix® Genotyping Console work well with small datasets and
are suitable for cancer diagnostics and similarly small—sized sample
sets. The difﬁculties in bridging the gap between packages for CNV
prediction, association analysis and visualization for distinguishing
genuine signals from false positive/negative predictions in generally
noisy datasets have hindered many scientists from conducting
genome—wide CNV analysis of their existing large GWAS datasets.

We here present CNVineta, an R package capable of handling
CNV data derived from large datasets with implemented analysis
tools for the detection and visualization of disease—associated
rare (Supplementary Fig. S4) and common CNVs (Supplementary
Figs SS, S6). CNVineta was designed to allow researchers to access
large datasets from standard desktop computers. We hope that
CNVineta will empower scientists to perform genome—wide CNV
screening and quickly evaluate raw data of candidate CNVs in
existing GWAS datasets.

2 FEATURES OF CNVINETA

2.1 Input and output

In order to allow for rapid access to both predicted CNV data and
raw data, as logz of raw data ratios (LRR) and B—allele frequencies
(BAF), CNVineta requires the CNV prediction output from third
party tools [e. g. Affymetrix® Power Tools (APT), QuantiSNP
(Colella et al., 2007), etc.] as well as the LRR and BAF to be
converted to the CNVineta ﬁle format. The ﬁle format consists
of (i) a single large binary data ﬁle with binary data on LRR and
BAF for all samples; (ii) a SNP array annotation ﬁle; (iii) a sample
annotation ﬁle; (iv) a segment annotation ﬁle containing data on
predicted CNVs; and (v) a RefGene ﬁle with standard annotations
for all genes in the human genome [UCSC refGene table (Karolchik
et al., 2009)].

A detailed description of the CNVineta input ﬁle format and a
conversion workﬂow are available in the online tutorial of CNVineta
as well as in the package vignette. As an example for the CNVineta
workﬂow (Fig. 1A).

Fig. 1. Workﬂow and screenshots from CNVineta. (A) Workﬂow. Before
starting the CNV screening, the SNP array data has to be processed
with a third—party CNV prediction algorithm. Subsequent CNV association
screening can be performed for rare and/or common CNVs. The functions
automatically generate result tables and graphs for all regions that were
identiﬁed as associated by CNVineta. The visual data mining can be
performed in a stepwise fashion. (B—D) Plotting results for a known common
deletion at the IRGM gene locus (McCarroll et al., 2008) in the Affymetrix®

(upper panel) and BAF (lower panel). (D) Heat map. To obtain a sample set—
wide impression of the particular CNV and in order to identify potential false
positive and negative CNVs that should be subjected to further follow—up,
heat maps of LRR data can be generated.

2.2 Handling and visualization of CNVineta objects

CNVineta combines CNV prediction and raw data of the entire
dataset. CNVs can be visualized in user—deﬁned regions of the
human genome across all samples using the regional overview
option (Fig. 1B). As CNVs often overlap and vary in size, a graphical
overview quickly allows for an orientation of the CNV structure
at a particular region in the entire sample set. To demonstrate
CNVineta’s compatibility with large datasets, a regional overview
of the proximal part of the chromosome 15q region (13 Mb) in
1587 samples is shown in the Supplementary Figure Sl.

2.3 Genome-wide screening of rare and common CNVs

Analysis methods for genome—wide screening of rare and common
CNVs are implemented. To reduce the complexity of the CNV
predictions, CNVineta minimizes the genomic positions for

association analysis. To this end, the array marker set is reduced
to those markers, where a predicted CNV in any sample either
starts or ends (Supplementary Fig. S2). In CNVineta, these markers
are so—called atoms. The collated atoms are then used to scan
genome wide for rare CNVs and/or common CNVs using a logistic
regression model. The latter analysis method allows for the inclusion
of covariates, e. g. gender, age and/or EIGENVECTORs that can help
to remove confounding genotyping batch effects and/or population
stratiﬁcation (Price et al., 2006). LRR and BAF plots of samples
with CNVs at the candidate regions as well as heat maps can
automatically be generated. Primary, temporary and resulting data
can all be processed by existing and/or custom R functions.

3 CONCLUSIONS

In this application note, we introduce CNVineta, an R package
designed to meet the needs of scientists working with large—
scale CNV data derived from SNP arrays. While many recently
published CNV analysis programs focus on CNV prediction
algorithms, CNVineta aims at handling, visualizing and mining these
CNV predictions. The CNVineta workﬂow, outlined in detail in the
online tutorial and Figure 1A, allows for in—depth data mining of
a given dataset for associated rare as well as common CNVs for a
phenotype of interest. Previous studies on CNVs in large sample sets
genotyped with SNP arrays identiﬁed a large number of apparently
false positive and negative CNV calls, which hampered an accurate
interpretation and follow—up. CNVineta aims to overcome these
difﬁculties by combining the visualization of CNV calls and the
respective raw data.

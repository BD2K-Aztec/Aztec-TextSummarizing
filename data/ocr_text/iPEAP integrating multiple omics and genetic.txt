ABSTRACT

Summary: A challenge in biodata analysis is to understand the
underlying phenomena among many interactions in signaling path-
ways. Such study is formulated as the pathway enrichment analysis,
which identifies relevant pathways functional enriched in high-
throughput data. The question faced here is how to analyze different
data types in a unified and integrative way by characterizing pathways
that these data simultaneously reveal. To this end, we developed
integrative Pathway Enrichment Analysis Platform, iPEAP, which
handles transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and GWAS
data under a unified aggregation schema. iPEAP emphasizes on the
ability to aggregate various pathway enrichment results generated
in different high-throughput experiments, as well as the quantitative
measurements of different ranking results, thus providing the
first benchmark platform for integration, comparison and evaluation
of multiple types of data and enrichment methods.

1 INTRODUCTION

As the advent of post-genomic era, omics science and high-
throughput technology have generated massive data.
Quantitative methods are developed to better relate the underline
pattern of the data to biologic concepts, like Gene Ontology
terms, biological functions or pathways and so forth. Among
them, biochemical pathways are the primary focus, and they
are extensively used to interpret biological data in a network
viewpoint (Kamburov et al., 2011). In particular, pathway
overrepresentation and enrichment analyses have become import-
ant approaches for the interpretation of data from various
high-throughput experiments, which aim at projecting a set of
genes, proteins or metabolites onto predefined groups, calculating
significance of correlation for each group and then ranking them

according to the statistic. Correlation statistics can be defined in
many ways, and various pathway enrichment analysis algorithms
were proposed, like overrepresentation analysis (Draghici et al.,
2003), gene set enrichment analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005),
network topology-based approaches SPIA (Draghici et al., 2007),
DEAP (Haynes et al., 2013) and so forth.

With rapid accumulation of massive and various types of omic
and genetic data, the major challenge for pathway analysis now
becomes how to analyze different types of data for a given
experiment in a unified way and interactively mining the under-
line functions under these data simultaneously. For a given set of
samples, multiple types of high-throughput data, such as the
transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and genome-wide
association study (GWAS) data can be generated at the same
time. These data describe the samples from different perspectives,
and each of them can be complementary to each other to obtain
the unbiased enrichment pathway list. There are a few works
existed on the integrative pathway analysis like integrative
GWAS and gene expression analysis in prostate cancer (Jia
et al., 2012), IMPaLA (Kamburov et al., 2011), MAPE (Shen
and Tseng, 2010) and so forth. But traditionally only one path-
way enrichment algorithm or one speciﬁc integration method
was provided. To the best of our knowledge, integrative bench-
mark platforms allowing multiple enrichment and integration
algorithms to handle multiple omic and genetic data, together
with easy-to-use user interface, are absent.

To tackle the multiple data integration problem, we presented
a software iPEAP, namely integrative Pathway Enrichment
Analysis Platform, to perform integrative pathway enrichment
analysis. It is a Java based, user-friendly, graphical tool with the
aim of integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics
and GWAS data for pathway level analysis. Furthermore,
various state-of-art pathway enrichment analysis algorithms
for the single data type as well as the quantitative evaluation
measurements and tools for pathway ranking were incorporated
into iPEAP, which are useful for the access, evaluation and
comparison of different approaches in one platform.

2 METHODS

iPEAP guides users to follow the following pipeline, i.e. data type selec-
tion, data input, enrichment analysis, ranking aggregation and evaluation
to perform the integrative pathway enrichment analysis (Fig. 1).
The calculated pathway ranking is displayed as a table including pathway

way graphs are accessible by double clicking the pathway ID or title. The
hit genes/metabolites in pathway are shown in an adjacent window by
clicking the corresponding pathway record, together with their expression
values, which can be the reads per kilobase per million (RPKM)/frag-
ments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) values
or the calculated differential expression values. Linkouts to other network
sources like STRING (Franceschini et al., 2013), MetPA (Xia and
Wishart, 2010), IMPaLA (Kamburov et al., 2011) and KOBAS (Wu
et al., 2006) are also provided. Users can also compare and evaluate the
pathway rankings using two tools ListComparer and RankEvaluator, re-
spectively, which were developed in iPEAP (See Supplementary
Material). For the ﬁrst time three quantitative measurements, i.e.
NDCG (normalized discounted cumulative gain) (J arvelin et al., 2002)
ERR (expected reciprocal rank) (Chapelle et al., 2009) and P (proportion)
(Tsai et al., 2007) were included in iPEAP to evaluate ranking results (See
Supplementary Methods). In addition, various state-of—art pathway en-
richment algorithms were also incorporated for handling transcriptomics,
proteomics, metabolomics and GWAS data, respectively (Supplementary
Table S1). Two integration schemas, i.e. RobustRankAggreg (Kolder
et al., 2012) and RankAggreg (Pihur et al., 2007) can be selected to inte-
grate different pathway rankings into one unbiased overall ranking. Some
simple aggregation methods such as min, median and mean are also
provided (Willett, 2013) (See Supplementary Methods).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Application to multiple types of data

To illustrate the use of iPEAP as an integrative tool, we analyzed
two cases with multiple types of data integration from two
established studies. One case is focused on non-genotoxic
carcinogenesis where the human hepatocarcinoma cell line
HepG2 was exposed to the environmental carcinogen 2, 3, 7,
8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Both the transcriptomics and
metabolomics proﬁles were integrated with iPEAP, helping to
understand the molecular mechanisms induced by toxic com-
pounds in vitro in human cells (J ennen et al., 2011). Another one
is a non-targeted metabolomics study associated with the single
nucleotide polymorphism loci on two cohorts, namely the
German KORA F4 Study (n = 1768) and the British Twins UK
study (n = 1052) (Suhre et al., 201 1). In this case, the metabolomics
and GWAS proﬁle were integrated to study the functional path-
ways using iPEAP. The integrated pathway enrichment results for
two cases are listed in Supplementary Table S4 and S7, respect-
ively. Both of them obtained more reasonable and novel biological
results compared with that only one single type of data was used.

3.2 iPEAP for pathway ranking evaluation and
comparison

Using the built-in tools and quantitatively ranking evaluation
measurements in iPEAP, ranking comparison and evaluation
can be easily carried out to further interpret the pathway ranking
results. In our study, three transcriptomics datasets, namely
lung adenocarcinoma, breast cancer and hepatic cell treated
with palmitate, initially used by (Draghici et al., 2007),
were applied as the benchmark data to evaluate three classical
pathway enrichment algorithms, namely overrepresentation
analysis, gene set enrichment analysis and SPIA, using the
built-in tool RankEvaluator. We evaluated the top 20 pathways
of the nine ranking results, using three measurements as NDCG,
ERR and P, respectively, provided the ﬁrst time a quantitative
evaluation of distinct pathway enrichment algorithms, as shown
in Figure 2.

In summary, iPEAP provides a powerful platform to analyze
different types of high-throughput data and investigate their
pathway-level mechanism in an integrative fashion.

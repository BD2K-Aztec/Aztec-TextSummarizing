ABSTRACT

Motivation: For biological pathways, it is common to measure a gene
expression time series after various knockdowns of genes that are
putatively involved in the process of interest. These interventional
time-resolved data are most suitable for the elucidation of dynamic
causal relationships in signaling networks. Even with this kind of data it
is still a major and largely unsolved challenge to infer the topology and
interaction logic of the underlying regulatory network.

Results: In this work, we present a novel model-based approach invol-
ving Boolean networks to reconstruct small to medium-sized regulatory
networks. In particular, we solve the problem of exact likelihood
computation in Boolean networks with probabilistic exponential time
delays. Simulations demonstrate the high accuracy of our approach.
We apply our method to data of Ivanova et al. (2006), where RNA inter-
ference knockdown experiments were used to build a network of the
key regulatory genes governing mouse stem cell maintenance and dif-
ferentiation. In contrast to previous analyses ofthat data set, our method
can identify feed back loops and provides new insights into the interplay
of some master regulators in embryonic stem cell development.
Availability and implementation: The algorithm is implemented in the
statistical language R. Code and documentation are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

The inference of signaling networks from biological data is of fun-
damental importance for a systemic understanding of regulatory
processes. The statistical methods that have been developed for
that purpose can be grouped according to the type of data that
they expect as input. Many approaches use gene expression data.
Some methods are based solely on static observations of the
unperturbed system; they exploit the fact that fluctuations of

interacting components are dependent (Basso et al., 2005;
Van Driessche et al., 2005). The use of perturbation data greatly
improves network reconstruction (Frohlich et al., 2008;
Niederberger et al., 2012; Tresch et al., 2008). To resolve the
order of events in a signaling cascade, time-resolved measure-
ments after perturbation yield further improvements (Friedman
et al., 2000; Grzegorczyk et al., 2008). Boolean networks are an
appropriate tool for dealing with this type of data (Ideker et al.,
2000; Kauffman, 1969; Shmulevich et al., 2002; Silvescu and
Honavar, 2001). The most difﬁcult problem lies in accounting
for the mostly unknown time delays with which the signal is
propagated through the network (Papin et al., 2005).

In this work, we propose Boolean networks with probabilistic
time delays as a novel statistical network inference method. There
have been attempts to calculate the likelihood of a Boolean net-
work in special cases by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling (Anchang et al., 2009) and for dynamic
nested effects models (Faihnezger et al., 2013; Frohlich et al.,
201 1). Exact results were so far obtained only under strong restric-
tions on the logic functions involved, as in the context of conjunc-
tive Bayesian networks (Beerenwinkel and Sullivant, 2009;
Beerenwinkel et al., 2007). By analytically marginalizing over
the unknown delay times, we derive our main result, an exact
and efﬁcient recursive likelihood formula for a broad class of
Boolean networks with exponentially distributed time delays
that may include feedback loops. We evaluate our method in vari-
ous simulation scenarios for its ability to recover the unknown
topology. The method is then applied to a murine stem cell knock-
down data set by Ivanova et al. (2006), which consists of a set of
whole genome gene expression time series after the knockout of six
genes (Essrb, Sox2, Nanog, Tcll, Oct4 and Tbx3) that are con-
sidered key regulators in the maintenance and differentiation of
mouse embryonic stem cells. Our analysis reveals more feedback
loops than previously detected.

2 METHODS

We aim to model central aspects of dynamic signaling networks, namely,
combinatorial regulation, and time delayed responses in gene activity.
All signaling components are considered either active or inactive, i.e.
they are represented as binary variables. The activity of each component
is modeled as a Boolean function of its parent variables in the network.

Exact likelihood computation in signal network reconstruction

 

Signaling in biological networks occurs with time delays, which are suit-
ably modeled by the Boolean networks introduced later in the text.

2.1 Boolean networks with unknown time delays and
interventions

Let g = {1, .. . , N} be a set of N signaling components that dynamically
interact with each other via transcriptional regulation, and let [F = {0, 1}
be a Boolean ﬁeld. Our model represents intracellular gene regulation by
a directed graph given by an adjacency matrix F e ngg. It is understood
that Pi]- = 1 whenever iis a parent, i.e. a regulator of j. At each time point
t, a gene j e g is characterized by two Boolean variables Aj(t) and Bj(t).
The induction state variable Aj(t) tells us whether gene j is either tran-
scribed at its basic rate or whether it exhibits altered transcription
(Al-(I) = 0 or 1, respectively). The activity state variable Bj(t) reports
whether the signaling molecule j is in its basic functional state or whether
its function is altered at time point t (Bl-(I) = 0 or 1, respectively, see
Fig. 1). It helps to think of the induction states as genes and their expres-
sion, and the activity states as the corresponding gene products (proteins)
and their activity as transcription factors. Although protein activity
can be measured in some instances, it is generally hard to obtain time-
resolved data. Therefore, we will infer the activity variables from the
expression of their known target genes. The induction state Aj(t) of j at
time t is determined instantaneously by the activity states B,(t) of its
parents 1' 6 pa (j) g g via a Boolean function : [Imam —> IF,
A10) =J}(Bi(l); 1' 6 pa 0)) a j E Q, I E [0, 00) (1)
If pa(j) = 0,  is a constant. The family {ﬁlj e g} of Boolean functions
is denoted by .7-'. The changes in the activity state of gene j are
transmitted to changes in the corresponding activity state with a constant
time delay  e [0, oo),
A-(t — d) for t Z d-
Bjm = {Aj-(O) J else J
Let A = {dJ-Ij e g}. The graph F, together with .7: and A deﬁne the
dynamics of all binary variables in the model.

To completely specify the Boolean network, we need to initialize the
values of A j(t) at t = 0. Through an intervention experiment, some induc-
tion states are actively set to 1, Aj(0) = 1 (e.g. by a gene knockdown),
whereas the rest of the variables are initialized by 0. At the same time, all
feedback to an actively perturbed induction state variable Aj is blocked,
which is reﬂected by the removal of all incoming edges to A].

Fig. 1. Schematic of the model for a ﬁxed time point t: A,- and B,- are the
induction and activity states, respectively, of each regulator {1, 2, 3}. The
delays in signaling between an alteration of the gene state and an ensuing
alteration of the activity state are given by A 2 (di). Given all parent—
child relationships of the network, .7: = {f1,f2,f3} is the family of Boolean
functions. Functions for nodes with <2 parents (A1 and A2) are constant

In practical situations the delay times A are rarely known. We account
for this fact by considering the delay times as unknowns for which we
specify their prior distribution. The prior is a product of independent
exponential distributions, one for each individual delay time,

0 otherwise

Here, A = (2]) is a tuple of appropriately chosen positive hyperparam-

eters, and a complete parametrization of the model is given by the tuple

M = (mac, A).

2.2 The likelihood function

Let B = {Bl-($1,); j e g, k = 0, . . . , K} the observations of the binary state
variables Bj at K + 1 time points 0 = ro<rl <rz<  <rK. Given a
parametrization M of the model and some initial activation pattern,
one seeks to calculate the probability of observing B, by integration
over the unknown delay times,

P(Bll‘, f, A) = / P(Bll‘, .7-', A) . 71(A; A) (4)

The major technical achievement of this article is the closed-form solu-
tion of the integral in Equation (4) for arbitrary Boolean networks (pos-
sibly including cycles) that satisfy a rather general admissibility condition
(Supplementary Material S1). The class of Boolean networks that can be
inferred includes all acyclic networks, and all networks that allow each
node to switch only once, yet it is substantially larger. As the derivation of
this result requires tedious calculations and elaborate notation, we just
give the algorithm for the likelihood calculation in Algorithms 1 and 2
and refer to Supplementary Methods S2 for details. We also prepared
a table of all symbols as Supplementary Materials S6. Some quantities
arising during the calculation become extremely small, which bears the
risk of underﬂow errors. Therefore, all necessary computations were per-
formed in log space instead of using standard ﬂoating point arithmetic
(Supplementary Material S3). Having scored a Boolean network, we
search the space of all admissible signaling graphs by Markov Chain
Monte Carlo as outlined in Husmeier (2003) (Supplementary Material S5).

Our framework easily allows the modeling of a series of intervention
experiments. Each intervention will produce its own sequence of state
observations B, and each sequence will be evaluated separately by actively
initializing the expression states of perturbed variables with 1 and block-
ing all feedback to this state by the removal of all incoming edges.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Performance on synthetic data

Having in mind the application to stem cell differentiation
data with six genes (see Section 3.2), we manually chose ﬁve repre-
sentative topologies with six nodes for our simulation studies with
an OR as sole Boolean function. The delay times dg for each gene
g were sampled uniformly from the interval [1, 30] min. The
measurements were generated after t = {0, 15, 30, 45, 60} min.
For each topology, we then calculated the binary activity patterns
Bg(t) for each single gene knockout g. The local probability dis-
tributions L‘ = {P(Dlej); j e Q} are taken as

P(Dlej) "V N(D'; M = 31:02)

for a e {0.006,0.12,0.24,0.36,0.46,0.58}. We assume that
vague prior knowledge about the delay times is available by
choosing the hyperparameter Ag of the exponential delay time
prior such that their expected value equals the respective true
delay time dg.

For each topology, we started 100 MCMC runs with 2000
steps (see Supplementary Material S3 for details on the
MCMC method). The likelihood requires the summation over
all possible state sequences B e [FNXK. This makes calculations
infeasible even for medium-sized networks. We address this
problem by restricting the model space search to state sequences
that are in the immediate vicinity of the best scoring state
sequence Bmax. To ﬁnd Bmax, we exploit the fact that in our
model, the hidden state variables Bj change their value from 0
to 1 at most once in their time course (due to the monotonicity
of the chosen Boolean function, OR). This means that for each
Bj we can summarize its time course by denoting the time at
which the state change occurs by the random variable T]- called

change point. The contribution of the hidden state 31- to
P(DlB, z) is

K K
P(DxrolBjek» = H P(DjeknBj = 6e]. > T,» (5)

k:1 k:1
where 6(tk > Tj) = { (1) is? > Tj is the indicator function.

Thus, there are at most K + 1 different time courses for
Bj [(0,0, . . . ,0), (0,0, . . . ,0,1), . . . (0,1,1, . . . ,1), (1,1, . . . ,1)].
Enumerating these, we ﬁnd the time course for Bj that maximizes
the term in (5). Doing so for all j e 9, we ﬁnd the best scoring
state Bmax. Figure 2 shows the results for all ﬁve topologies. The
model shows a good overall performance for low and moderate
noise levels. It performs best on tree topologies (Fig. 2E), which
are often encountered in biological pathways. Another frequent
pathway motif is the feed-forward loop, as modeled in Figure 2B.
The addition of feedback to the linear topology in Figure 2A
decreases performance, but it still remains at a reasonable level.
Figure 2F shows the results on a biological network from litera-
ture [of the stem cell differentiation pathway from Anchang et al.
(2009)]. Speciﬁcity and sensitivity are comparable with the
simpler topologies A—E.

3.2 Application to stem cell differentiation data

Our model calls for time series measurements of protein activities
after single gene knockouts. Data of that kind are still sparse.
We circumvented this problem and increase the applicability
of the method by treating the binary activity state variables
as hidden variables. Our data consist of time series of measure-
ments D = (Dj(tk)) of the activity states Bj(tk), j e Q, at a ﬁnite
number of K + 1 time points 0 = t0<t1 <‘E2<  <‘EK.

The data Dj(tk) can be thought of as a noisy possibly repli-
cate quantiﬁcation of the hidden activity states B = {Bj(rk);
j e 9, k = 0, . . . ,K}. We relate measurements to their underlying
activity state through time-independent local probability
distributions L‘ = {P(Dlej); j e 9}. Given the hidden induction
states B and the local probabilities L‘, the probability of obser-
ving D is

N K
P(DIB,£) = Ill—[P(DjeolBjek» (6)

j:1 k:1

Equation (6) assumes independence of observations. The likeli-
hood then becomes

P(DlI‘, L‘, 7-", A) = Z P(DlB, L‘)(B|I‘, 7-", A) (7)

BEFNXK

Thus, we can apply the method to the dataset of Ivanova et al.
(2006) who used short hairpin RNA loss of function techniques
to downregulate genes whose expression patterns suggest self-
renewal regulatory functions in mouse embryonic stem cells.
Genome-wide gene expression time series measurements after
t: 0, l, ...,7 days were obtained after knockdown of each of
the following genes: Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, Tbx3, Esrrb and Tcll.
These genes are known to play a major role in stem cell differ-
entiation and are therefore called ‘major genes’. Anchang et al.
(2009) built a model with this knockdown data using dynamic
nested effect models.

The major genes represent the nodes in our network. The vari-
ables Aj(t) and Bj(t) correspond to their gene and protein activ-
ities, respectively. Because the activity states Bj(t) are not directly
measured by Ivanova et al. (2006), we use the expression activity
of gene groups under the regulatory control of the major genes
[the E—Genes in the nested effect model of Anchang et al. (2009)]
as a proxy for their protein activity. To get the local probabilities
P(Dlej) needed in the case of assuming hidden Bj(t), we use data
from 122 genes given as discretized time series representing ad-
missible patterns [see the Supplementary Materials of Anchang
et al. (2009) for details]. In accordance with our deﬁnition, genes

in their basic state were assigned the value 0, and assumed the
value 1 on activation. We kept the grouping of the 122 genes into
six groups of genes depending on Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, Tbx3,
Esrrb or Tcll discovered from the E—Genes graph from
Anchang et al. Because the data contain time series representing
the undifferentiated cell culture (the negative control), and the
cell culture undergoing normal differentiation (the positive con-
trol), we ﬁltered for genes whose expression differed more than
two-fold at the last time point between the two control experi-
ments. Then, we assigned to each gene at each time point a
probability to belong to the basal or the active state, according
to whether its expression resembled more the negative or positive
control (a likelihood ratio was calculated under the assumption
of Gaussian expression distributions). Using the gene groups
deﬁned earlier, we calculated a likelihood ratio for each major
gene to be active versus inactive as the product of the corres-
ponding likelihood ratios of the assigned genes (this was done
separately for each time point and each knockout). The likeli-
hood ratios are then converted into a probability of being active
(at a certain time point, in a certain knockdown experiment),
which corresponds to the input required for our model.

In this application, we only use the Boolean function
AND, leading to monotonic activity states B. As described in
Section 3.1, we chose the state sequence Bmax that maximizes
P(DlB, L‘).

Using the same MCMC procedure as in the simulation setting
(Supplementary Material S5), the stationary chain comprised 155
unique models. We used model averaging and calculated the
weighted frequencies of each edge. Each model was weighted
by its number of occurrences in the Markov chain, resulting in
a probabilistic adjacency matrix (Fig. 3A). Tcll has the lowest
connectivity, whereas Nanog has the highest. To compare the re-
sults of our model with the model from Anchang et al. (Fig. 3C),
we converted the probabilistic adjacency matrix into a graph by
drawing all edges with a probability >0.5 (Fig. 3B). The most
striking difference of Figure 3B compared with Figure 3C is the
presence of cycles. In particular, the major genes Oct4, Sox2,
Nanog and Esrrb form a maximal clique of the graph.

Exact likelihood computation in signal network reconstruction

 

The two graphs essentially agree on the position of Tc11, which in
both cases is targeted by Tbx3 and Esrrb. Also, Tbx3 is located
mostly upstream of the Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Esrrb clique in both
graphs. Still, it is puzzling why our method ﬁnds a highly inter-
connected feedback-loop rich structure, whereas Anchang et al.
ﬁnd a sparser solution. The method in Anchang et al. assumes an
acyclic graph structure, and hence by deﬁnition cannot ﬁnd
cycles. As our simulation studies have shown that the model
can accurately predict circular structures in regulatory graphs,
the feedback in this network might be higher, and the signaling
hierarchy less pronounced than previously thought. This is
conﬁrmed by a different approach to mouse embryonic stem
cell network reconstruction (Zhou et al., 2007) that also discovers
a large amount of interplay between the key regulators of stem
cell differentiation. Zhou et al. have also reconstructed a mouse
embryonic stem cell network based on transcription factor
binding sites, protein interactions and literature annotation.
They show bidirectional interactions of Oct4 with Nanog and
Sox2 coinciding with our ﬁnding (Fig. 3D).

4 CONCLUSION

In this work, we developed an algorithm that permits us to
analyze gene knockdown time series experiments, which have
high dimensional readouts (such as gene expression). To elucidate
the interplay of the major regulators, all of them need to be per-
turbed and measured individually. On the side of methods devel-
opment, we have solved the problem of calculating the likelihood
function for data generated from a Boolean network with prob-
abilistic exponentially distributed time delays (Algorithm 2). The
likelihood function can be used for network reconstruction, as has
been demonstrated in our simulation studies. Having a closed
form solution for the likelihood has several further applications
that we did not mention so far. It is possible to sample the joint
distribution P(BlI‘, 31-", A) rather efﬁciently, because many obser-
vations B can be excluded a priori knowing F and .7-". This allows
for accounting for some hidden variables Bk among the observed
B by integrating them out. Furthermore, it is possible to calculate
the expectation of a certain Bj to be on or off in a given time
interval. As an application, we have devised a method to apply
it to data in which the values of the Boolean network can only be
observed indirectly (Algorithm 1). We analyzed murine stem cell
differentiation data of Ivanova et al. (2006) for the purpose of
signaling network reconstruction. Comparison with a previous
reconstruction attempt in Anchang et al. (2009) revealed a
much richer feedback structure than expected. Our method sug-
gests regulatory feedback loops that lead to a better understand-
ing of the dynamic interplay of some master regulators in murine
embryonic stem cell development. We expect our method to ﬁnd
numerous applications, as protein abundance data become
increasingly available (Frohlich et al., 2009).

ABSTRACT

Summary: DisGeNET is a plugin for Cytoscape to query and analyze
human gene—disease networks. DisGeNET allows user-friendly
access to a new gene—disease database that we have developed
by integrating data from several public sources. DisGeNET permits
queries restricted to (i) the original data source, (ii) the association
type, (iii) the disease class or (iv) specific gene(s)/disease(s). It
represents gene—disease associations in terms of bipartite graphs
and provides gene centric and disease centric views of the
data. It assists the user in the interpretation and exploration of
the genetic basis of human diseases by a variety of built-in
functions. Moreover, DisGeNET permits multicolouring of nodes
(genes/diseases) according to standard disease classification for
expedient visualization.

Availability: DisGeNET is compatible with Cytoscape 2.6.3 and
2.7.0, please visit http://ibi.imim.es/DisGeNET/DisGeNETweb.html
for installation guide, user tutorial and download

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the most challenging problems in biomedical research is to
understand the underlying mechanisms of human diseases. Great
effort has been spent on determining genes associated to diseases
(Botstein and Risch, 2003; Kann, 2010). However, there is more
and more evidence that most human diseases cannot be attributed
to single genes but arise due to complex interactions between
multiple genetic variants and environmental risk factors (Hirschhorn
and Daly, 2005). Several databases have been developed storing
associations between genes and diseases such as Online Mendelian
Inheritance in Man (OMIM; Hamosh et al., 2005). Each of these
databases focuses on different aspects of phenotype to genotype
relationships. For instance, PharmGKB is specialized on how
genetic variation is related to drug response (Altman, 2007), whereas
the toxicogenomics database CTD stores information about the
effect of environmental chemicals on human health (Mattingly et
al., 2006). Hence, integration of different databases is needed to
allow a comprehensive view of the state of the art knowledge within
this research ﬁeld. It is widely established in bioinformatics to
represent associations between biomedical entities as networks and
to analyze their topology to get a global understanding of underlying

relationships (Butts, 2009; Goh et al., 2007; Yildirim et al., 2007).
Cytoscape is a widely used Java—based, open—source software for
networks visualization and analysis (Shannon et al., 2003). The
Cytoscape framework is extendable through the implementation of
plugins. Up to now, a vast variety of plugins has been developed
ranging from advanced network analysis tools to webservices. In
the following, we present DisGeNET, a new Cytoscape plugin to
query, integrate and visualize networks of human gene—disease
associations.

2 OVERVIEW

2.1 The human gene—disease database

We compiled a comprehensive database of human gene—
disease associations by integrating data from various expert
curated databases and text—mining derived associations including
Mendelian, complex and environmental diseases (Bauer—Mehren et
al., submitted for publication). We created bipartite graphs called
OMIM, UNIPROT, PHARMGKB, CTD, CURATED (combining
data from the curated databases), LHGDN (from the text—
mining data only) and ALL (including all available gene—disease
associations). Moreover, we calculated two network projections for
each bipartite graph in order to generate a disease and gene centric
data representations. These projections allow an enhanced view on
the genetic basis of complex diseases. We furthermore classiﬁed all
diseases into one of 26 possible disease classes following the MeSH
hierarchy (Bauer—Mehren et al., submitted for publication).

2.2 Gene—disease networks within Cytoscape

The gene—disease networks are bipartite graphs with two types
of nodes (gene and disease) (Goh et al., 2007; Newman, 2003).
Gene and disease nodes are connected through edges if the
according gene—disease association is covered in the gene—disease
database. We allow displaying multiple edges between nodes, each
representing a unique association found in the original data sources.
Moreover, we colour the edges according to the association type
following our gene—disease association ontology (Bauer—Mehren et
al., submitted for publication). The disease and gene projection
networks are monopartite graphs only containing either gene or
disease nodes. Nodes are connected through edges if the two
genes (diseases) share a disease (gene) in the bipartite gene—
disease network. Thus, this representation allows studying diseases
with similar genetic origin or genes associated to similar diseases.
DisGeNET can be started from the plugins menu in Cytoscape. The
main panel consists of three tabs, one for the gene—disease networks
called ‘Gene Disease Network’ and one for each projection, namely
‘Disease Projections’ and ‘Gene Projections’. The ‘Gene Disease

Fig. 1. (A) Cytoscape screenshot of DisGeNET. The diseases Alzheimer Disease and Myocardial Infarction and their shared genes are displayed (in yellow).
(B) The same network is shown with nodes coloured according to the disease classes of the nodes.

Network’ tab contains three drop—down menus allowing a restriction
to (i) source, (ii) association type and (iii) disease class. The
two projection panels only contain two drop—down menu options
to restrict the query to source and disease class. DisGeNET
incorporates an advanced search function for each of the three
network types. The user can search for a gene or a disease of
interest and even for any set of diseases or genes by using the
wild card symbol (asterisk). The search box can be either used
to create new networks or to select nodes of already generated
networks. DisGeNET makes use of the Cytoscape VizMapper to
create visual styles for the networks. Gene nodes are coloured in
blue and disease nodes in magenta (Fig. 1A). The node size increases
with increasing number of associated diseases, respectively genes.
Edges are coloured corresponding to the association type. Moreover,
disease and gene nodes can be coloured according to the disease
class by using the ‘Colour nodes with disease class’ button. Since
it is possible to have diseases and genes assigned to more than
one disease class, multicolour pie charts can be overlaid onto (and
removed from) nodes (Fig. 1B).

2.3 Use cases

Some exemplary use cases showing the utility of DisGeNET
are available at http://ibi.imim.es/DisGeNET/DisGeNETweb.html#
UserGuide and in the Supplementary Material section.

They address problems such as: (i) which are the genes
annotated to breast neoplasm in expert—curated databases?; (ii)
do comorbidities of Alzheimer disease and myocardial infarction
observed in patients reﬂect in a common genetic origin?; or (iii)
which are the diseases that are associated to post—translational
modiﬁcations such as phosphorylation?

3 CONCLUSION

DisGeNET is a coherent tool for easy analysis and interpretation
of human gene—disease networks. It allows user—friendly access to

a comprehensive database comprizing gene—disease associations
for Mendelian, complex and environmental diseases. DisGeNET
displays gene—disease association networks as bipartite graphs and
provides gene centric and disease centric views of the data. It assists
the interpretation and exploration of human diseases with respect
to their genetic origin. Diverse options for generating subnetworks,
as well as an advanced search tool, facilitate not only the analysis
of single diseases but also the study of sets of diseases or certain
disease classes speciﬁed through their associated genes. Herein,
the multicolouring of gene and disease nodes offers a convenient
visualization of disease classiﬁcations in the networks. We plan
regular updates of the underlying gene—disease association database
as well as the integration of further data sources.

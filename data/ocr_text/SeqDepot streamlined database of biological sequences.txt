ABSTRACT

Summary: Assembling and/or producing integrated knowledge of se-
quence features continues to be an onerous and redundant task des-
pite a large number of existing resources. We have developed
Squepot—a novel database that focuses solely on two primary
goals: (i) assimilating known primary sequences with predicted feature
data and (ii) providing the most simple and straightfonivard means to
procure and readily use this information. Access to >28.5 million
sequences and 300 million features is provided through a well-
documented and flexible RESTful interface that supports fetching spe-
cific data subsets, bulk queries, visualization and searching by MD5
digests or external database identifiers. We have also developed an
HTML5/JavaScript web application exemplifying how to interact with
Squepot and Perl/Python scripts for use with local processing
pipelines.

Availability: Freely available on the web at http://seqdepot.net/. REST
access via http://seqdepot.net/api/v1. Database files and scripts may
be downloaded from http://seqdepot.net/download.

1 INTRODUCTION

Primary sequences and their associated features are vital to all
bioinformatics research. Invariably, determining gene and pro-
tein function begins with sequence similarity searches (Altschul
et al., 1997) followed by identifying intrinsic features that strictly
depend on the sequence itself. Many computational tools and
libraries exist for elucidating intrinsic features such as signal pep-
tides (Petersen et al., 2011), transmembrane regions (Cserzo
et al., 2003; Sonnhammer et al., 1998), protein domains (Haft
et al., 2013; Letunic et al., 2012; Punta et al., 2012), motifs
(Attwood et al., 2012; Jacobs et al., 2009), subcellular location
(Emanuelsson et al., 2007) and structural elements (Lees et al.,
2010). When considered together and in context, these higher
level details synergistically improve the understanding of macro-
molecular function.

Obtaining such functional details requires building a compu-
tational pipeline that analyzes sequences with the desired toolset
and/or fetching results from external servers. Developing a
custom pipeline is computationally expensive. Moreover,

predicting intrinsic features produces the same results for identi-
cal sequences, and recomputing this information wastes valuable
resources (Rattei et al., 2010). Many public resources such as
Pfam (Punta et al., 2012), SMART (Letunic et al., 2012) and
Gene3D (Lees et al., 2010) provide precomputed results; how-
ever, signiﬁcant effort must be exercised to properly map se-
quence identiﬁers, handle coverage discrepancies and integrate
results from independent resources.

Squepot addresses the aforementioned issues by consolidat-
ing a wide array of precomputed features across known protein
space in a single database. Squepot enables users to rapidly
retrieve and process with minimal effort both primary and in-
trinsic feature data for existing sequences, which makes it differ-
ent from other tools (e.g. InterPro) that dynamically compute
this information for novel sequences.

InterPro (Hunter et al., 2012) and Similarity Matrix of
Proteins (SIMAP; Rattei et al., 2010) aggregate large masses of
precomputed data for classifying all proteins in UniProt
(Consortium, 2012) into families and calculating all-versus-all
sequence similarity analyses, respectively; however, simply ob-
taining and consuming features for a given set of sequences is
neither straightforward nor streamlined. InterPro’s web interface
permits querying a single sequence per request or up to 25 per
request via web services. If precomputed matches do not exist,
then the sequences are queued for analysis with InterProScan
(Quevillon et al., 2005), which may take 30 minutes per sequence
to complete. SIMAP provides several avenues for data access
including the web browser, database ﬂat ﬁles and most notably
via a powerful SOAP-based web service. Sequence searches with
the web browser are limited to a single sequence with a maximum
of 500 hits, and effectively using SOAP interfaces requires non-
trivial programming. Exported results (e.g. ﬂat ﬁles) from both
InterPro and SIMAP for all predictive tools are merged into a
ﬁxed number of ﬁelds and necessitate additional parsing logic to
disentangle and properly structure the data of interest.

As high-throughput sequencing projects exponentially reveal
additional sequences, researchers are required to analyze larger
amounts of sequence data. Even with the vast number of data-
bases and web services available today, one must expend consid-
erable time and effort fetching sequences and features, installing
diverse software packages, generating results, restructuring data
and even building local databases. There remains a compelling
need for a single resource that both maps raw sequences to
precomputed feature data at scale and is easily queried and

processed by both humans and computers. Squepot ﬁlls this
gap with the overarching goals of being both comprehensive and
extremely simple to use.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

All data are stored in a MongoDB (http://mongodb.org) data-
base. An ‘Aseq’—a unique amino acid sequence regardless of its
source or species—constitutes the core document entity. Each
Aseq is uniquely identiﬁed by an ‘Aseq ID’ (amino acid sequence
identiﬁer)—a 22—character string derived by encoding the binary
MD5 digest of the uppercase sequence characters with a slightly
modiﬁed Base64 scheme. This scheme removes terminal padding
characters and converts all forward slashes and plus signs to
URL ‘friendly’ underscores and dashes, respectively. Each
Aseq contains basic descriptors including its sequence, length
and status. Aseqs are further decorated with predicted features
and external database references.

Raw sequences and precomputed features hosted by the
SIMAP project (Rattei et al., 2010) are downloaded, parsed
and inserted into the database. Identiﬁers and sequences con-
tained in the NCBI non-redundant, UniProt (Consortium,
2012) and Protein Data Bank (Rose et al., 2013) databases are
subsequently merged to provide additional coverage and cross-
referencing capabilities. Adding to the many predictive features
precomputed by SIMAP (Rattei et al., 2010), we also predict
transmembrane regions with the Dense Alignment Surface TM
ﬁlter (Cserzo et al., 2003) and Extra Cytoplasmic Function
domains (Staron et al., 2009). The entire database is publicly
accessible via a RESTful (Epresentational state transfer)
Application Programming Interface (API). Updates are per-
formed on a quarterly basis to integrate novel sequences and
associated features. This includes refreshing precomputed data
with results from current versions of each feature prediction tool.

3 FEATURES

3.1 Comprehensive

Squepot contains >28.5 million unique amino acid sequences
sourced from major sequence databases and >300 million intrin-
sic features.

3.2 Non-redundant

By deﬁnition, all Aseqs are non-redundant and source-agnostic.
Thus, all derived data associated with a speciﬁc sequence is easily
consolidated in a single document.

3.3 Intrinsic identiﬁers

Aseq IDs solely depend on the full-length ungapped sequence
characters (i.e. intrinsic) and may be easily generated independ-
ent of any external database. Such universally unique and size-
efﬁcient identiﬁers are permanently stable and ideal for mapping
sequences between databases.

3.4 Flexible well-documented RESTful API

The REST API encapsulates the gateway to all data within
Squepot and has been designed to make accessing, visualizing

and consuming relevant data extremely easy. The data for any
given Aseq may be retrieved by requesting a URI with the gen-
eral form http: / /seqdepot.net/api/v1 /aseqs / {id} . {format}?{par-
ameters}, where {id} is a supported identiﬁer type, {format} is
the desired output format (json, png or svg for JSON, PNG
image or SVG image, respectively) and {parameters} optionally
modiﬁes the response (e. g. limit the ﬁelds returned). To visualize
the domain architecture for a sequence, simply replace {format}
with either png or svg to produce a PNG or SVG image ﬁle of
the predicted biological elements. Textual results and error mes-
sages are encoded in J SON (http://json.org). Virtually every pro-
gramming language contains libraries for transforming J SON
encoded data into native data structures with a few lines of
code. This completely circumvents the need to write custom par-
sers and requires minimal effort to process results in downstream
applications. Complete documentation covering all aspects of the
REST API including several examples is located at http://seqde
pot.net/api.

3.5 Visualization

Generate raster or vector images visualizing the full domain
architecture for any Aseq.

3.6 Bulk querying
Supports up to 1000 queries per request.

3.7 Cross-referencing

Aseqs may also be referenced using the hexadecimal MD5 digest
of the sequence or a variety of external database identiﬁers
including UniProt (Consortium, 2012), GenBank (G1) or
Protein Data Bank (Rose et al., 2013) identiﬁers.

3.8 Utility scripts

Perl and Python modules and a companion script, sdQuery.pl,
facilitate interacting with Squepot and performing many
common tasks including the following: parse FASTA ﬁles,
generate Aseq IDs, fetch sequences and/or precomputed data,
cross-reference sequences, download visualizations and much
more.

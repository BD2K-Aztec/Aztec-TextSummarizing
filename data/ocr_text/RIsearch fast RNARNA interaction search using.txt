ABSTRACT

Motivation: Regulatory, non-coding RNAs often function by forming a
duplex with other RNAs. It is therefore of interest to predict putative
RNA—RNA duplexes in silico on a genome-wide scale. Current com-
putational methods for predicting these interactions range from fast
complementary-based searches to those that take intramolecular
binding into account. Together these methods constitute a trade-off
between speed and accuracy, while leaving room for improvement
within the context of genome-wide screens. A fast pre-filtering of pu-
tative duplexes would therefore be desirable.

Results: We present Rlsearch, an implementation of a simplified
Turner energy model for fast computation of hybridization, which
significantly reduces runtime while maintaining accuracy. Its time
complexity for sequences of lengths m and n is 0(m-n) with a
much smaller pre—factor than other tools. We show that this energy
model is an accurate approximation of the full energy model for
near-complementary RNA—RNA duplexes. Rlsearch uses a Smith—
Waterman-Iike algorithm using a dinucleotide scoring matrix which
approximates the Turner nearest-neighbor energies. We show in
benchmarks that we achieve a speed improvement of at least 2.4x
compared with RNAplex, the currently fastest method for searching
near-complementary regions. Rlsearch shows a prediction accuracy
similar to RNAplex on two datasets of known bacterial short RNA
(sRNA)—messenger RNA (mRNA) and eukaryotic microRNA (miRNA)—
mRNA interactions. Using Rlsearch as a pre-filter in genome-wide
screens reduces the number of binding site candidates reported by
miRNA target prediction programs, such as TargetScanS and
miRanda, by up to 70%. Likewise, substantial filtering was performed
on bacterial RNA—RNA interaction data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) form an abundant class of genes
involved in both regulation and housekeeping functions, often
in complexes with proteins and/or through interactions with

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

other RNAs (Amaral et al., 2008). The potential for ncRNAs
is becoming apparent, e. g. in the mammalian genome where the
protein coding regions account for ~1.2% (International Human
Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004) while the majority of the
genome is transcribed (The ENCODE Project Consortium,
2007). Even in smaller genomes, such as fungi strains of
Aspergillus, ‘only’ 45—50% of the genome encodes proteins
(Galagan et al., 2005), leaving plenty of room for ncRNAs
which could hold the potential for improvements to microbial
industrial production, such as has already been investigated in
Streptomyces (D’Alia et al., 2010). Also in mammalian produc-
tion systems such as Chinese hamster ovary cell lines, ncRNAs
receive increasing attention (Barron et al., 2011).

Computational screens for structured RNAs result in thou-
sands of candidates on a genome-wide scale and it is of interest
to predict possible RNA interaction partners of these sequences
(Gorodkin et al., 2010; Gorodkin and Hofacker, 2011). These
candidates are predicted from sequence and structure-based
alignments, by using a combination of thermodynamic and evo-
lutionary constraints (such as compensating base pair changes)
(Pedersen et al., 2006; Torarinsson et al., 2006, 2008; Washietl
et al., 2005; Weinberg et al., 2007). A principal problem, how-
ever, is to obtain experimental data for each of these candidates,
such as the full-length RNA sequence and its function. Another
factor is that many ncRNAs are expressed at extremely low
levels. For example, the regulatory antisense RNA of the
GAL10 operon in yeast is functional and expressed as one
copy per 14 cells (Houseley et al., 2008). Coping with such low
expressed ncRNAs on a high-throughput experimental scale is
still an intractable task.

One approach toward functional analysis of ncRNA candi-
dates is to search for possible interactions with other RNAs, as
a substantial class of ncRNAs function by duplex formation with
other RNAs, of which microRNAs (miRNAs) are a popular
example. However, not only small ncRNAs interact by base pair-
ing, but also long ncRNAs. For example, Staufen 1-mediated
messenger RNA decay (SMD) can be initiated by imperfect
base pairing between Alu elements in a lncRNA and in the
3’-UTR of an SMD target (Gong and Maquat, 2011).
Translational regulation by short RNAs (sRNAs) is also a
common mechanism existing in bacteria WVaters and Storz,
2009). A well-known example is the MicC-ompC messenger
RNA (mRNA) interaction causing translational repression
(Chen et al., 2004; Vogel and Papenfort, 2006).

Rlsearch

 

It is furthermore of interest to use the homology information
from multiple structural alignments of ncRNA candidates for
interaction prediction. Recent computational approaches that
address this are PETcofold (Seemann et al., 2011) and ripalign
(Li et al., 2011). Other methods that work on pairs of single
sequences include PairFold (Andronescu et al., 2005), RNAup
(Miickstein et al., 2006) and inteRNA (Alkan et al., 2006).
However, such approaches which take both intra— and intermo-
lecular base pairings into account seem in general to be less suit-
able for genome-wide interaction screens.

It is therefore relevant to develop fast methods to search for
putative RNA—RNA interactions not only for existing ncRNA
candidates, but also to ﬁnd novel RNAs which, for example,
hold the potential to be lineage speciﬁc or perform lineage-
speciﬁc functions (Bentwich et al., 2005; Ohhata et al., 2011).

The computational prediction of RNA—RNA interactions is a
rapidly growing research area. As discussed in Seemann et al.
(2011), several classes of algorithms with increasing complexity in
time and memory were developed. Here, we consider algorithms
that use a thermodynamic energy model for predicting intermo-
lecular interactions, while ignoring intramolecular structures. An
early method was RNAhybrid (Rehmsmeier et al., 2004) which
makes use of the full energy model, only excluding intramolecu-
lar base pairings and multiloops. This yields a complexity of
0(m-n) in memory and 0(12 -m - n) in time, with m and n
being the lengths of query and target, respectively, and l the
maximum loop length. Hodas and Aalberts (2004) explicitly
noted the analogy between Smith—Waterman sequence alignment
(Smith and Waterman, 1981) and intermolecular RNA pairing.
Their implementation in BINDIGO handles different loop types
with different states and dynamic programming (DP) matrices. A
recent and faster method is RNAplex (Tafer and Hofacker, 2008;
Tafer et al., 2011), which uses a simpler energy model in the ﬁrst
‘scanning phase’. It approximates larger loops with a linear
model, thereby discarding the length-dependent term and thus
the factor [2 in time complexity. It also reduces memory con-
sumption to a linear scaling. In a second step, the full energy
model can be used on sub-sequences to reﬁne potential binding
sites. Even though RNAplex decreases time complexity while
maintaining a thermodynamic model, applying it to
genome-wide screens is still a computationally demanding task.

Here, we simplify the energy model even further, with the goal
of designing a screening method for RNA—RNA interactions
that can be used as a pre-ﬁlter for computationally complex
methods in genome-wide screens. Consequently, our goal here
is to search for near-complementary regions. To our knowledge,
the fastest tool for such a task is RNAplex which recently was
extended to use the information from multiple sequence align-
ments as well as pre-computed accessibility proﬁles. However,
when searching for near-complementary regions, the energy
model of RNAplex can be simpliﬁed further. Here, we introduce
Rlsearch, which implements a simpler state model that essen-
tially takes all stacked base pairs into account, but averages
costs over loop openings, internal loops and bulges. This is rea-
lized by an alignment-like algorithm that treats dinucleotides as
the elementary unit of a 36 x 36 scoring matrix. An additional
layer of heuristics can be used for genome-wide searches, which
reduces the search space by ﬁrst identifying short stretches of
complementarity and extending those with RIsearch. It is

beyond the scope of this work to fully address this additional
step. One major consideration here is the G—U wobble, which
has been addressed earlier, e. g. in GUUGle (Gerlach and
Giegerich, 2006).

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 The algorithm

The underlying algorithm of Rlsearch can be seen as an extension of the
Smith—Waterman—Gotoh algorithm (Gotoh, 1982; Smith and Waterman,
1981) for local sequence alignment. To ﬁnd putative interaction sites, we
look for complementarity rather than similarity/identity. A similar idea
has been used in the so-called ‘individual base pair model’ introduced by
TargetRNA (Tjaden et al., 2006; Tjaden, 2008). The crucial difference
is that our scoring scheme is based on dinucleotides instead of single
nucleotides. This allows us to reﬂect the main properties of the
nearest-neighbor free energy model, which is widely applied for RNA
folding (see below for details on the scoring scheme). It can also be con-
sidered as a scoring scheme taking di-residue substitutions into account
with gaps being an explicit part of the scoring scheme (Akbasli, 2008). An
alignment approach making use of di-residue substitutions, but with
other gap scoring was introduced as well (Crooks et al., 2005).

When neglecting intramolecular base pairing, the only structural elem-
ents that need to be considered are stacked pairs, bulges and interior
loops. Contributions from dangling ends and terminal mismatches are
excluded to keep the algorithm simple and fast. We use a three-state
model (Fig. 1), with an M—state for consecutive matches (stacked pairs)
and mismatches (interior loops) and Bq/Bt states for gaps (bulges) in
either sequence (query q or target 1). All interactions come from the
I(nitiation)—state and terminate in E(nd). All scores S are deﬁned in one
scoring matrix, where S(q,-_1, qi; tj+1, 1]) denotes the energy for stacking
the base pair (q,, 1]) on (qi_1, tj+1). q,- refers to the ith nucleotide in the
query, tj to the jth nucleotide in the target. Both are indexed in 5’ - to 3’ -
direction from 1 to m, respectively, n. As two RNA strands interact

(developed for and) proven useful before in the pairwise alignment of
amino acid sequences using doublets, hereby taking into account correl-
ation of neighboring residues (Akbasli, 2008). Here, the dashes indicate
bulges or asymmetric internal loops, but are equivalent to gaps when the
state model is applied to sequence alignments. States are represented by
circles, transitions by connecting arcs. The number of pairs in the circles
indicate the index increments to reach that state, e.g. for the Bq—state
(bulge in query) only the q(uery) index is incremented, thus ‘(+1,0)’,
while the M—state is reached by (mis)matching two residues, so both in-
dices are updated. In a DP matrix, this corresponds to moving diagonally
for transitioning into the M—state, and horizontally/vertically for the
B—states. Indices along the t(arget) sequence are decremented as the two
interacting RNA strands run in opposite directions. See recursion in the
text for further description

running in opposite directions (antiparallel), target indices are decre-
mented when query indices are incremented.

For each of the main states, we maintain one table (DP matrix) where
M i, j contains the maximum score of an interaction that ends ungapped at
position i of the query and j in the target. Accordingly, Bq and Bi hold
maximum scores for sub-alignments ending in a gap.

To lower memory usage from 0(m - n), we split the algorithm in two
steps. In the ﬁrst step, RIsearch scans for possible interaction sites. By
approximating loop energies with a linear (afﬁne) model, only two rows
of each DP matrix need to be stored. All scores for the current row only
depend on the previous row, achieving a linear space requirement. During
this phase, we store for each row the maximum score and its position in
the query (EJ- and EJ’.). This results in a space complexity of
0(6 - m + 2 - n) with m and n being the lengths of the query and target
sequence, respectively. This approach introduces an ambiguity, as each
position in the target can only be linked to one position in the query. If
there are multiple sites within the query that bind to the same region of
the target, the weaker interaction might be missed. In practice, however,
this does not cause problems when the query is a short sequence. In the
second step, all entries in E that exceed a given threshold are processed.
For this, a region of 40 nt (or a user-speciﬁed amount) downstream of the
identiﬁed positions is taken into account to compute the actual structure
and free energy of the duplexes. In this way, RIsearch needs only mar-
ginally more time to identify suboptimal interactions.

This approach is similar to RNAplex. We reach a further simpliﬁca-
tion by (i) not using an extra state for interior loops, and (ii) also ap-
proximate small interior loops with the afﬁne model instead of relying on
the look-up tables. (iii) RNAplex seems to incorporate dangling end con-
tributions even though this is not stated in their paper. Fewer states lead
to a less complex recursion and other differences are due to algorithmic
design (most notably our dinucleotide matrix). This also holds true for a
comparison with BINDIGO that distinguishes different types of bulges
and interior loops depending on their size and degree of asymmetry and
includes terminal stacks, thus leading to a more complex recursion.

The RIsearch recursion is given as

Mi—l,j+1 + S(Qi—I, 611'; 0+1, tj)
BC]i—1,j+1 + S(qi—l, qi; —, tj)
My = max Bti—1,j+1 + S(_:Qi; 1141,11)
S(—:€Ii; —, tj
0
{ Mi—1,j + S(qi—l, 6111113 —)
BQi—l, j + S(Qi—l: qt; —, -)
Mi,j+1 + S(Qi, —; 1141,11)
{311141 + S(—, —; Ij+1, tj)
Ej = In?" MU 1' S(qz‘a —§ 11': —)}

quJ = max

Btid' = max

Entries in the M—state (ungapped) can come from (i) the M—state by
extending the previous alignment with one residue on both strands, mean-
ing either a stacking of a new pair, or the symmetric extension of an
interior loop (or opening, closing an interior loop). The entries can (ii/
iii) come from a dash (gap) in either sequence, reﬂecting the closing of a
bulge or the closing or continuation of an asymmetric interior loop. (iv) A
new alignment can be started and (v) 0 is given if this pair should not be
part of the interaction. In the implementation, the latter two cases are
merged into one, implicitly handled by the scoring matrix. All scores
S(—,q,-; —, 1]) where q,- and tj do not form a Watson—Crick or wobble
base pair, and therefore should not start an alignment, are set to zero.
Elements in Bq and Bi can either come from the M—state by opening a
new ‘gap’ or from the same state by extending an existing ‘gap’. As
mentioned before, the row maximum is stored in a one-dimensional

array EJ- and the corresponding position i within the query in  One
possibility to allow a position in the target to be related to more than one
position in the query is to make these arrays two-dimensional, giving
room to store the second and third best interaction in Ezd- and E3,j.

2.2 Scoring matrix

Values for the 36 x 36 scoring matrix (Supplementary Fig. S1) are derived
from the Nearest Neighbor Database (NNDB) (Turner and Mathews,
2010). The NNDB contains parameters, determined from optical melting
experiments, that allow prediction of free energy changes of the different
RNA structural elements (stacked pairs, loops) and are widely used in
software for RNA folding. It provides complete nearest-neighbor sets,
including rules and parameter values, along with tutorials. Considering
the current and previous position of the two sequences allows us to apply
stacking energies for the base pairs. Bulge and interior loop energies
usually contain a length-dependent term, but are here approximated by
an afﬁne model. Figure 2a shows that the afﬁne ‘gap’ model is exact for
bulge sizes 2—6, and over-penalizes larger loops. A single-nucleotide bulge
in our model receives the bulge opening cost and possibly a penalty for
terminal A—U or G—U pairs. This is not the case for the full energy model,
in which the stacking energy of the enclosing base pair is awarded. The
look-up tables for interior loops of sizes 1 x 1, 1 x 2 and 2 x 2 cannot be
incorporated into our scoring scheme. Instead, all energies have to be
approximated by an afﬁne model with opening and extension penalties,
as depicted in Figure 2b. Interior loops with >14 nucleotides are
over-penalized.

We created two matrices, one based on the so-called Turner 1999
energy parameters (Mathews et al., 1999) and one based on the Turner
2004 set (Mathews et al., 2004). The latter is the default, but the user can
choose either. Energy contributions of stacking and bulges are largely
identical, the scoring differs for interior loops. Supplementary Table S1
shows the free energies of example duplexes as modeled by RIsearch and
other methods.

There are some ambiguous cases in the scoring matrix, for example in
S(—, —; C, G). We cannot tell whether it is the extension of a bulge
(0.4 kcal/mol) or the asymmetric extension of an already asymmetric in-
terior loop (0.6 in T04 and 0.48 in T99). For this case, we decided to just
assign the bulge loop extension penalty, as larger loops are already
over-penalized.

Rlsearch

 

To favor short stable interactions, the user can choose a per-nucleotide
penalty [like in Tafer and Hofacker (2008)], which is then directly inte-
grated in the scoring matrix.

2.3 Data and benchmarking

We benchmarked our method on several datasets containing simulated
data and two real-life datasets of bacterial sRNA and human miRNA
with their respective targets. Accuracy and runtime of RIsearch were
compared with previous methods. We mainly focused on a comparison
with RNAplex, because it belongs to the same class of algorithms and has
already been benchmarked against a variety of other tools.

2.3.] Simulated data This dataset consists of random sequences of
different lengths (20—50 nt, in steps of 5nt) covering a variety of
GC-contents (~10, 30, 50, 70 and 90%). For each class, 1000 sequences
were generated. First, the perfect complement was derived. Then, this
hypothetical optimal binding partner was mutated stepwise as follows:
A random position in the sequence was chosen to be substituted with
75% probability, deleted with 17% or a nucleotide inserted (8%).
The number of repetitions is length dependent to ensure a wide range
of Levenshtein distances (LDs) between the optimal and the mutated
target, yielding 1000 - (length + 6) duplexes for each combination of
length and GC—content.

For each of these duplexes, we calculate the minimum free
energy (MFE) with different tools, namely DuplexFold from the
RNAstructure package (Reuter and Mathews, 2010), which implements
the NNDB 2004 rule set, RNAplex (Tafer et al., 2011) and RNAcofold
(Bernhart et al., 2006b), which both use the Turner 1999 parameters and
RIsearch with the 2004 matrix.

2.3.2 Speed data To benchmark time (and also memory) consump-
tion, we use three different sets of sequences. Random data as well as
genomic sequences of various lengths and different number of query
sequences are contained in those. For details, see Section S2.1 in the
Supplementary Material.

2.3.3 sRNA data This dataset comprises a total of 17 sRNA—
mRNA interactions with experimentally veriﬁed binding site positions.
It has been used before as a benchmark set by Busch et al. (2008), Chitsaz
et al. (2009) and lately by Tafer et al. (2011), from which sequences were
taken. Query and target sequences are on average 147 nt and 179 nt long.
The speciﬁc sRNA—mRNA interactions appear in the table in Section 3.
Since RNAplex was previously benchmarked on a range of tools (Tafer
and Hofacker, 2008; Tafer et al., 2011), we only compare RIsearch (both
parameter sets) with RNAplex (with and without taking into account
accessibility). Accessibility proﬁles were computed by RNAplfold
(Bernhart et al., 2006a) with parameters as suggested by Tafer
(RNAplfold -W 240 -L 160 -u 40 -O.)

For this benchmark we do not consider suboptimal duplexes initially,
but only whether the ﬁrst reported hit corresponds to the experimentally
veriﬁed interaction site. We present the deviation between predicted and
experimentally veriﬁed duplex boundaries as was also done by Tafer et al.
(2011). To evaluate the performance, we additionally calculated the sen-
sitivity (SEN, also called true-positive rate) and the precision [also called
positive predictive value (PPV)] and the harmonic mean of both (also
known as F—measure) as was also done by Kato et al. (2010) and Salari
et al. (2010). The deﬁnitions are

TP TP

E =— PP :—
SN TP+FN’ V TP+FP’

_2-SEN-PPV
T SEN + PPV

We counted true positives (TPs), false positives (FPs) and false nega-
tives (FNs) by comparing the veriﬁed interacting base pairs with pre-
dicted ones. An alternative measure is the Matthews correlation
coefﬁcient (Matthews, 1975), which in this case [since the number of

true negatives (TNs) is orders of magnitudes higher than TP, FP and
FN] reduces to the geometric mean of the sensitivity and the PPV:
«/ SEN - PPV (Gorodkin et al., 2001). For cases where the ﬁrst prediction
did not overlap the experimentally veriﬁed location, we then also com-
puted suboptimal solutions.

2.3.4 miRNA data We examine a subset of human microRNAs
causing mRNA repression from TarBase GDapadopoulos et al., 2009).
This dataset of 27 interactions has been used before to benchmark
RNAplex (Tafer and Hofacker, 2008). The mature miRNA sequences
from miRBase 17 (Kozomara and Grifﬁths-J ones, 2011) are used as
query and the 3’ -UTRs of the respective mRNAs from UCSC hg19 (aver-
age length 2294 nt) are used as target. The experimentally conﬁrmed
binding sites were collected from the original papers and mapped to
the extracted sequences. For some miRNA—mRNA pairs, there is more
than one veriﬁed interaction site. The majority have only one or two
binding sites (13 and 9), few have up to four, the interactions including
KRAS and NRAS forming the exception with eight and nine possible
binding sites, respectively (Johnson et al., 2005). The 27 miRNA/UTR
pairs were scanned with RNAhybrid, RNAplex and RIsearch, allowing
for suboptimal hits. For RIsearch, we used the 1999 energy parameters,
as the other two methods also use them. An interaction counts as ‘re-
covered’ when the predicted target region overlaps any of the annotated
binding sites. For interactions with more than one experimentally veriﬁed
binding site, we considered the one ranked highest (according to their
predicted free energy) for each method.

We used the same 27 interactions to test performance on large-scale
screens. Instead of only the 3’ -UTR sequence, we used the whole
repeat-masked chromosome where the known target is located. We also
included GUUGle as well as TargetScanS (Garcia et al., 2011) and
miRanda (Enright et al., 2003), which both are speciﬁcally designed for
miRNA target prediction. In this screen, we excluded RNAhybrid, be-
cause it requires to ﬁll in the entire DP matrix several times to predict
suboptimal duplexes, which makes it too slow for scanning whole
chromosomes. For each of the ﬁve methods, we count the number of
hits which have the same or better score than the best hit that overlaps an
annotated target site. Two different measures were used to evaluate the
methods. For the ﬁrst measure, we ranked all methods individually for
each miRNA—mRNA pair, where the method yielding the lowest hit
count ranks ﬁrst (using fractional ranking). Given k interactions, let
cg,,- be the count and rgJ the rank of method g in the ith interaction.
The rank product (Breitling et al., 2004) is given as the geometric mean:
RP(g) 2 (Hill rg, ,-)1/k. Because this is an ordinal measurement, we deﬁne
a second measure, the relative hit score, which takes account for the
degree of difference between the hit counts of the different methods.
We ﬁrst ﬁnd the maximum count N for each interaction:
N,- = maxg{cg,,-} and deﬁne RHS(g) = 2le (N,- — cg,,-)/N,-.

To demonstrate the efﬁcacy of RIsearch as a ﬁlter, we ﬁrst use
RIsearch (with free energy threshold of —11kcal/mol) and apply
TargetScanS and miRanda on the pre-ﬁltered data. We measure the re-
duction in candidate regions compared with the raw results of the two
miRNA target predictors. We compare this with the ﬁlter abilities of
GUUGle (requiring a seed match of at least seven nucleotides) and a
combination of the two.

3 RESULTS
3.1 General ranking of duplexes

To evaluate the accuracy of the scoring scheme, we created a set
of random sequences for different combinations of length and
GC-content as described above. We address not only score
(energy) computations, but also the ranking by the various
tools. In Figure 3a, we show how the different methods deviate

in their scoring. RNAcofold was included here because it con-
siders intramolecular base pairs resulting in lower energies for
sequences that are further away from perfect complementarity.
The energy deviation to the other tools increases with LD.
RIsearch typically yields higher energies; however, the results
are ranked similarly to the other methods. When comparing
duplex free energies as computed by RIsearch and DuplexFold
(Fig. 3b), we get a Pearson product-moment correlation coefﬁ-
cient r of 0.99 (P-value <2.2e—16). The Spearman’s rank cor-
relation coefﬁcient ,0 ranges between 0.98 and 0.99. Furthermore,
when looking at the 5% highest ranking duplexes (those with the
lowest AG), the overlap in candidates is quite substantial
(Fig. 30). Even though the free energies computed by RIsearch
deviate from energies computed by a method using the full
energy model (see comparison with DuplexFold in Fig. 3d), we
have shown that the general ranking of the duplexes correlates
well with the ranking by DuplexFold. See Supplementary Figure
S2 for sequences of other lengths and GC-content.

3.2 Runtime and memory benchmark

As RNAplex has already been shown to be much faster than
alternative methods, we only compare the performance of
RIsearch to RNAplex on different datasets.

On a small dataset of 19 bacterial sRNAs and 100 target
sequences (each 1200 nt long), RNAplex takes around 25 s to
predict all optimal duplexes, whereas RIsearch only needs 9 s

on a standard laptop (Intel C2D @253 GHz) (Supplementary
Table S2).

To prove that whole-genome scans become feasible, we quer-
ied whole human chromosome 1 with one miRNA and got a
speedup of 181-fold. With more sequences in the query, this
drops drastically. From the data shown in Supplementary
Table S3, it seems that RNAplex uses a substantial amount of
time for the initialization. But also after correcting for that,
RIsearch still shows a signiﬁcant speedup.

To get a more complete picture, we generated random se-
quences with lengths of 10, 100, 1000 and 25 nt (the latter to
represent ncRNAs of the type miRNA or small interfering
RNA) as queries as well as target sequences in order of magni-
tude steps between 1000 and 1 GB. The speedup of RIsearch
over RNAplex grows with decreasing query and increasing
target lengths (Supplementary Table S4). The extreme speedups
we see for large target sequences should be noted with caution, as
they reﬂect the same initialization issue as mentioned above. This
overhead in the initialization cannot be explained with more
advanced options to RNAplex, parameters were chosen to
yield fastest runtimes. The overhead might just be an implemen-
tation issue.

Overall, we observe a worst case speedup of around 2.4.
Peak-memory consumption is typically reduced by a factor
1.44, i.e. RIsearch uses ~69% of the memory that RNAplex
uses. With short target sequences (~1000 nt), this drops
to 43%.

For all of these benchmarks the simple version of RNAplex
was used, i.e. not taking into account accessibility. We also tested
the version including accessibility proﬁles and found it substan-
tially more resource demanding than the regular RNAplex,
which itself in its current implementation is considerably
slower than RIsearch (Supplementary Section S22).

3.3 Locating sRNA interaction sites

The precision of RIsearch (with 99 and 04 Turner parameters)
was compared with RNAplex (with and without accessibility) on
a real-life dataset of 17 bacterial sRNA—mRNA interactions.
Although RNAplex-a (with accessibility) predicts 16 interactions
that overlap the known binding sites, RIsearch with both energy
parameter sets and RNAplex-c (without accessibility) each re-
cover 12 of the known interaction sites (Table 1). There are
two cases (chB-STM4351 and MicC-ompC) where each of
those three methods predicts the same energetically more stable
interaction than the annotated one. When measuring the amount
of overlap of predicted and annotated base pairs (Supplementary
Table S5), RNAplex-a performs best in all measures, with an
average sensitivity and PPV (0.787 and 0.736) higher than
RIsearch04 (0.656 and 0.641) and the other methods (ranging
behind), because it only misses one interaction, not ﬁve.
However, if suboptimal solutions are additionally taken into ac-
count, RIsearch04 has a better average sensitivity of 0.919, com-
pared with 0.846 and 0.917 for RNAplex with and without
accessibility, respectively. RIsearch (with its default scoring
matrix) then also outperforms RNAplex in terms of PPV
(RIsearch04: 0.898, RNAplex-a: 0.785 and RNAplex-c: 0.821),
F—measure and Matthews correlation coefﬁcient. In all

For each sRNA—mRNA interaction, we report the binding site (begin and end positions in both sequences) as given in the literature and as predicted by the four methods.
All methods searched only for the single best-scoring interaction. RNAplex-a uses pre-computed accessibility proﬁles and only misses one interaction (in bold and gray text).
RIsearch (with 99 and 04 Turner parameters) and RNAplex-c do not take into account accessibility information and instead use a ﬁxed per-nucleotide penalty of 0.3 kcal/mol.

These three methods miss ﬁve interactions each, though different ones.

measurements, the 2004 Turner parameters lead to a higher pre-
diction accuracy than the 1999 parameters in RIsearch.

3.4 Locating miRNA target sites in genomic sequence

We also compared the recovery rates of RIsearch, RNAplex
and RNAhybrid for 27 human miRNA—target UTR duplexes.
Predicted binding sites were ranked according to their free energy
and we report the highest ranking prediction that overlaps
an annotated binding site in Table 2, as it has been done by
Tafer and Hofacker (2008). For 23 of the interactions, the
three methods report the same binding site as the highest scoring
true-positive hit. For example, TarBase contains four possible
binding sites for the let-7e miRNA in the 3’-UTR of SMClA
mRNA. They constitute the top ranking candidates of all the
methods tested here, but in different order. The interaction
that has been experimentally veriﬁed (Kiriakidou et al., 2004)
is ranked ﬁrst by RIsearch and second by the other methods.
In this benchmark, RNAhybrid performs best, known target
sites are ranked higher and predicted more accurately in position.
RNAplex is slightly better than RIsearch in ranking the real
interactions (on average 1.92 compared with 2.07), while
RIsearch predictions are generally closer to the veriﬁed binding
site. The frequent one-nucleotide deviation in position could be
an artifact of the different handling of dangling ends and ter-
minal mismatches.

When screening the whole chromosome, we observe very
different levels of speciﬁcity (Supplementary Table S6).
TargetScanS fails to ﬁnd 2 out of the 27 interactions, because
it requires a perfect seed match that is not present in those target

sites. With default parameters, miRanda misses three inter-
actions. We have not tried any other parameter setting.
GUUGle alone performs worst (in terms of RP and RHS), but
when combined with RIsearch or RNAplex, respectively, we get
an miRNA target predictor comparable to the specialized meth-
ods. In this combination, RIsearch scores best in RHS and
slightly behind the two specialized methods in RP.

When applying this combination as pre-ﬁlter for TargetScanS
and miRanda, we achieve on average a reduction of candi-
dates by around 37% for both tools. RIsearch without the
GUUGle-preﬁlter accounts for an average reduction of 27%
for miRanda candidates and 35% for TargetScanS, in some
cases of up to 70% (Supplementary Table S7). The degree of
reduction seems dependent on the GC-content of the miRNA
(see Supplementary Material, page 11).

The prediction of thousands of potential miRNA targets is in
agreement with a recent hypothesis of miRNA response elements
connecting mRNAs, transcribed pseudo genes and long ncRNAs
in large-scale regulatory networks (Salmena et al., 2011).

3.5 Filtering using RIsearch

Here, we illustrate how RIsearch can be used as ﬁlter for the
more complex algorithms, such as IntaRNA or RNAup. We
extracted the sequences from Escherichia coli and Salmonella
typhimurium according to the IntaRNA paper (Busch et al.,
2008). In Figure 4, we show a receiver-operating characteristic
curve of the recall against search space reduction given different
energy cutoffs, with an area under the curve of 0.817. It shows
that with a rather conservative cutoff of —10kcal/mol, we can

Fig. 4. RIsearch as ﬁlter for bacterial sRNA—mRNA interactions. The
color key refers to RIsearch energy cutoffs. TNR (or speciﬁcity) is syn-
onymous with the search space reduction we can achieve with different
cutoffs. Recall (or sensitivity, TPR) shows how many of the known inter-
actions we retain

already ﬁlter out 16.1% of the candidates. With —11.5kcal/mol,
we still retain all true targets, while reducing the search space by
27.5%. Considering that IntaRNA uses around 9 h 40 min
(and RNAup even 18h 50 min) to compute all 47.726 duplexes,
while RIsearch takes <18 s, this shows how genome-wide
searches can be speeded up.

4 DISCUSSION

RIsearch is a fast method to search for near-complementary base
pairing in genomic sequence by using a simpliﬁed energy model.
In a runtime benchmark, we show that RIsearch is at a minimum
a factor of 2.4 faster than RNAplex, the currently fastest method
for predicting near-complementary duplexes and also has a lower
memory consumption. Remarkably, our simpliﬁed model gives
good energy estimates for complementary duplexes interspersed
with small bulges and interior loops. Even though RIsearch sys-
tematically computes an energy differing by a small factor com-
pared with the full Turner energy model, the reported energies
strongly correlate (r: 0.99) with the energies computed by the
full model in DuplexFold. When ranking random duplexes by
their predicted energies, RIsearch shows on average an overlap
of 94% with DuplexFold and RNAplex within the highest
ranking duplexes.

In our evaluation of prediction accuracy on the sRNA—
mRNA and miRNA—mRNA datasets, we show that RIsearch
achieves a similar or better sensitivity and precision for predicted
base pairs as other compared methods. However, considering the
accessibility of binding sites with RNAplex can increase the re-
covery rate of the veriﬁed sRNA—mRNA interactions. Other
approaches, such as IntaRNA and RNAup, also account for
accessibility by computing intramolecular base pair probabilities
in both sequences. This, however, comes at the expense of
runtime. In contrast, the objective of RIsearch is the fast
search for potential RNA—RNA duplexes. One application
is pre-ﬁltering in genome-wide screens. When RIsearch is used
as a pre-ﬁlter for specialized miRNA target predictors, such as
miRanda and TargetScanS, the number of target site candidates
can be signiﬁcantly reduced, which in turn results in a better
precision of the miRNA target prediction.

Problems with developing methods that should be applied on a
genome-wide scale include reliable testing. We face a lack of
experimentally veriﬁed interactions. For many miRNAs for ex-
ample, target genes have been identiﬁed, but the actual binding
site positions within their 3’-UTR are unknown (Lindow and
Gorodkin, 2007). Even for known target sites, the extent of the
interactions is not clear, for examples of bacterial sRNA target
sites, see Sharma et al. (2007). Even though we could benchmark
on a limited dataset, benchmarking the accuracy of genome-wide
searches for RNA—RNA interactions is currently hard given the
limited amount of known interactions. In particular, it is not
possible to reliably calculate the false-discovery rate unless
follow-up experiments are carried out. Another factor is the es-
timation of P—values, which requires a background model for
RNA—RNA interaction to distinguish true positives from
random hits. This, however, depends on incorporating reliable
shufﬂing schemes, e. g. based on dinucleotide composition, simi-
lar to those for de novo prediction of ncRNA genes (Gorodkin
and Hofacker, 2011).

Rlsearch

 

RIsearch was developed as a tool, which can conduct a fast
initial screen in genomic sequence and aid in the overall goal of
mapping all potential RNA—RNA interactions in, e.g. the human
genome. However, it is beyond the scope of this work to set up
such a pipeline, which most likely involves additional methods,
taking the full energy model into account, as well as the devel-
opment of a framework for computing P-values. The estimation
of P-values by TargetRNA points to a direction for this. For
further future directions, prediction of RNA—RNA interactions
could be combined with high-throughput experimental data,
such as done for RNA structure prediction (Deigan et al.,
2009; Kertesz et al., 2010; Underwood et al., 2010).

The introduced simpliﬁcations will make a hardware imple-
mentation of the algorithm, e.g. with a ﬁeld-programmable gate
array, more feasible. Hardware accelerated versions of the
Smith—Waterman algorithm have been shown to be magnitudes
faster than traditional software implementations (Li et al., 2007).

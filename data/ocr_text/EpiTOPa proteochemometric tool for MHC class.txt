ABSTRACT

Motivation: T-cell epitope identification is a critical immuno-
informatic problem within vaccine design. To be an epitope, a peptide
must bind an MHC protein.

Results: Here, we present EpiTOP, the first server predicting MHC
class II binding based on proteochemometrics, a QSAR approach
for ligands binding to several related proteins. EpiTOP uses a
quantitative matrix to predict binding to 12 HLA-DRB‘I alleles. It
identifies 89% of known epitopes within the top 20% of predicted
binders, reducing laboratory labour, materials and time by 80%.
EpiTOP is easy to use, gives comprehensive quantitative predictions
and will be expanded and updated with new quantitative matrices
over time.

1 INTRODUCTION

T—cell epitope identiﬁcation is a challenging immunoinformatic
problem within vaccine design. To be an epitope, a peptide should
bind a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein. For MHC
class I, epitopes typically comprise 8—10 residues. The MHC class II
binding site is open-ended, allowing much longer peptides to bind,
although only nine amino acids occupy the site. Many computational
methods have been developed for T—cell epitopes: see Flower
(2008). Many work well and are widely used by immunologists
and vaccinologists.

Most available epitope prediction methods separately address
peptides binding particular MHC proteins, developing models
for a single target allele. For MHC class II, only the generalized
artiﬁcial neural network (ANN)—based server NetMHCIIpan uses
both peptide and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) sequence
information (Nielsen et al., 2008). Recently, we developed a
proteochemometrics-based approach to MHC class II prediction
(Dimitrov et al., 2010). Proteochemometrics, a quantitative
structure-activity relationships (QSAR) approach originally
developed by Wikberg (Lapinsh et al., 2001), deals with ligands
binding to several related proteins. In conventional QSAR, the

X matrix of descriptors includes only information from ligands.
In proteochemometrics, the X matrix contains information from
proteins and ligands. A single proteochemometric model could
potentially predict peptide binding to many MHC proteins.

We have developed and validated several models for binding
to several HLA-DRBl alleles, and now make the best model
available in the server EpiTOP. It uses a quantitative matrix (QM)
to predict peptide afﬁnity to 12 HLA—DRBl proteins: DRB1*0101,
DRB1*0301, DRB1*0401, DRB1*0404, DRB1*0405, DRB1*
0701, DRB1*0802, DRB1*0901, DRB1*1101, DRB1*1201,
DRB1*1301 and DRB1*1501.

2 ALGORITHM

The EpiTOP algorithm was described in detail elsewhere (Dimitrov
et al., 2010). Brieﬂy, the QM was derived from 2666 known
binders of different length, binding to 12 HLA—DRBl alleles, and
which were extracted from the Immune Epitope database (IEDB)
(September 2008) (Peters et al., 2005). Peptides are described
using three z-scales per residue broadly corresponding to volume,
hydrophobicity and polarizability (Hellberg et al., 1987). Nonamers
are encoded by a sequence of 27 z-descriptors (9 positions x 3 z-
scales), forming the L block. HLA-DRBl alleles are encoded by
54 descriptors (18 positions X 3 z-scales), forming the P block. We
use only polymorphic residues within the binding site that interact
with the peptide. The model also contains cross-terms for adjacent
peptide positions (L12 block) and peptide—protein cross-terms (LP
block). The LP block contains cross-terms for peptide—protein amino
acid interactions in pockets 1, 4, 6, 7 and 9. The afﬁnities of binders
were assessed as pIC 50 values.

The QM was derived using the iterative self-consistent (ISC)
algorithm (Doytchinova and Flower, 2003). Brieﬂy, the initial
training set included all nonamers with anchors (Tyr, Phe, Trp, Leu,
Ile, Met and Val) at position 1 (n = 10670). This was used to extract
the ﬁrst model. The optimum number of principal components
(PCs) was derived by cross-validation in seven groups. The ﬁrst
model was used to predict pIC50s of the initial set and the best
predicted nonamers from each parent peptide formed a second
training set. This second set was used to produce the second model,
which predicts p] C 50s of the initial training set. The best predicted
nonamers from each parent peptide were selected and placed in a
third training set. The selection procedure was repeated until the
peptides in consecutive derived training sets were the same at the
99% level.

Protein sequences are submitted to EpiTOP in one letter format.
A protein is divided into overlapping nonamers. Only nonamers

bearing anchor residues at position 1 are assessed, the rest being
omitted as non-binders. The binding afﬁnities of the nonamers are
predicted using the derived proteochemometric QM. In the results
page, nonamers are arranged in descending order according to
pIC50. Results can be expressed using six different cutoffs: top 5%,
10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and all binders.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

EpiTOP 1.0 is a web-based application written in PHP and HTML,
and integrating the MySQL database environment. It is freely
accessible via http://www.pharmfac.net/EpiTOP. EpiTOP identiﬁes
peptides binding to HLA-DRB1 alleles within protein sequences,
with options to vary HLA allele and cutoff.

4 PERFORMANCE

Three test sets were used to benchmark EpiTOP performance:
AntiJ en, IEDB and Lin’s datasets. The evaluation based on AntiJ en
and IEDB datasets was performed under conditions similar to
those an experimental immunologist might use: the complete
protein sequences were submitted to a server and the results
recorded. Five thresholds were used: top 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%
and 25% of predicted binding nonamers. Identiﬁed binders are
shown as a percentage of all binders (sensitivity). The predictive
ability of EpiTOP was compared to eight other servers: SVMHC
(Donnes and Elofsson, 2002), ProPred (Singh and Raghava, 2001),
RANKPEP (Reche et al., 2004), IEDB—ARB (Bui et al., 2005),
IEDB—SMM_align (Nielsen et al., 2007), MHC2Pred (http://www
. imtech.res.in/raghava/mhc2predl), NetMHCII (http://www.cbs.dtu
.dk/services/NetMHCII) and NetMHCIIpan (Nielsen et al., 2008).
SVMHC, ProPred, RAN KPEP, IEDB—ARB, IEDB—SMM_align and
EpiTOP are QM-based methods; MHC2Pred uses SVM, NetMHCII
and NetMHCIIpan are ANN based. Some of the servers do not
predict binding to all DRB1 alleles used in the test sets. Only servers
IEDB, NetMHCIIpan and EpiTOP make predictions for all 12 DRB1
alleles. Although many methods give quantitative predictions, in our
evaluation they were used as classiﬁcation methods. Each server was
evaluated only on the alleles it predicts.

The evaluation using Lin’s dataset was performed in terms of
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) statistics (Bradley, 1997).
Two variables sensitivity and I-speciﬁcity were calculated at
different thresholds. The area under curve (AUC) is a quantitative
measure of predictive ability and varies from 0.5 for random
prediction to 1.0 for a perfect prediction. The performance of
EpiTOP was compared to that of four other servers: SVMHC,
ProPred, IEDB—SMM and NetMHCIIpan (Nielsen and Lund, 2009).

AntiJen and IEDB datasets used for benchmark are given

as Supplementary Data I. Lin’s dataset is freely accessible at
http://bio.dfci.harvard.edu/DFRMI. The detailed results are given
as Supplementary Material II.
AntiJen benchmark dataset: the AntiJen dataset consisted of
116 epitopes belonging to 29 proteins and binding to 6 HLA—DRB1
alleles (Supplementary Material I). It was extracted from the AntiJ en
database (Toseland et al., 2005). These epitopes bind to DRB1*0101
(22 binders), DRB1*0301 (7 binders), DRB1*0401 (62 binders),
DRB1*0404 (1 binder), DRB1*1101 (2 binders) and DRB1*1501
(22 binders).

The total number of binders is 4540. Time of evaluation: January 2010. Allele-speciﬁc
performance is given in Supplementary Material 11.

The results from the evaluation based on AntiJ en test set are

shown in Table 1. For the top 5% cutoff, EpiTOP is sixth in
sensitivity, for the top 10%—ﬁfth and for the top 15—25%—third
after NetMHCIIpan and NetMHCII.
IEDB benchmark dataset: the dataset extracted from the Immune
Epitope database (December 2009) consisted of 4540 epitopes,
originating from 167 proteins (Supplementary Material I). The
peptides from this set bind to 12 DRB1 alleles: DRB1*0101 (2051
binders), DRB1*0301 (190 binders), DRB1*0401 (392 binders),
DRB1 *0404 (159 binders), DRB1*0405 (244 binders),
DRB1*0701 (336 binders), DRB1*0802 (153 binders), DRB1*0901
(160 binders), DRB1*1101 (275 binders), DRB1* 1201 (24 binders),
DRB1* 1302 (243 binders) and DRB1*1501 (313 binders).

The results from the evaluation based on IEDB are given in

Table 2. At the time of the evaluation (January 2010), SVMHC was
not accessible and it was excluded from the study. For the top 5%
cutoff, EpiTOP is third in sensitivity; for the top 10% it is fourth; for
the top 15%, third together with RANKPEP; and for the top 20%
and 25 %, it is second after NetMHCIIpan.
Lin ’s benchmark dataset: Lin’s dataset (http://bio.dfci.harvard
.edu/DFRMLI/) consists of 103 overlapping peptides derived from
four protein antigens—bee venom phospholipase A2, dog lipocalin,
tumor antigen LAGE—l and viral antigen HIV NEF (Lin et al., 2008).
The binding afﬁnities to seven HLA-DR molecules (DRB1*0101,
*0301, *0401, *0701, *1101, *1301 and *1501) were measured
using a competition assay. We excluded allele DRB1* 1301 as
several servers did not predict binding to it.

Results from this evaluation are shown in Table 3. AUC values for
SVMHC, ProPred, IEDB-SMM and NetMHCIIpan are taken from

a previous study (Nielsen and Lund, 2009). EpiTOP has the second
best result after NetMHCIIpan.

Identiﬁcation of the peptide binding core: EpiTOP was tested to
identify the peptide binding core on a set of X-ray data for peptide-
DRB1 allele complexes (Nielsen et al., 2008). EpiTOP performance
was compared to those of TEPITOPE (Sturniolo et al., 1999), IEDB—
SMM, NetMHCIIpan and NetMHCII, published by Nielsen and
Lund (2009; Table 4).

EpiTOP identiﬁed 8 out of 11 binding cores correctly (73%). Two
of the misaligned cores (MRMATPLLM and MRADAAAGG) are
second best binders with predicted pIC50 values very close to the
best binders (Supplementary Material II).

5 DISCUSSION

We undertook a rigorous evaluation of the performance of EpiTOP
across three datasets, comparing it to that of either four or eight
other servers, using either recall statistics or ROC analysis. Overall,
EpiTOP compares very favourably with other more specialized
models. For the AntiJ en and IEDB datasets, EpiTOP performs sub-
optimally only at the highest speciﬁcity; since it is strongly inclusive
and much broader in its predictive potential, other much more highly
focused, allele-speciﬁc models outperform it at this highly stringent
level. At more permissive thresholds, and within statistical error,
EpiTOP performs identically to best-in—class servers.

For Lin’s dataset, the ﬁve tested binders were much close in
performance: within the limits of error, EpiTOP performs sub-
optimally only for DRB1*0101. It is interesting to note that EpiTOP
is very much the best model for DRB1*0301.

For the identiﬁcation of binding cores, EpiTOP again performs
well, but interestingly core identiﬁcation correlates inversely with
overall statistical perform, perhaps suggesting that much remains to
be understood regarding class MHC—peptide interaction.

Taken together, results from these various benchmarking exercises
both validate EpiTOP and indicate that development of a synergistic
meta-server, which integrates results from several servers should
prove a useful exercise, hopefully yielding signiﬁcant overall
enhancements.

6 CONCLUSION

EpiTOP is the ﬁrst proteochemometrics-based server for T—cell
epitope prediction. It is a tool for performing preliminary
computational analyses of large datasets for accelerated epitope-
based vaccine design. It is easy to use, gives comprehensive
quantitative predictions and will be expanded and updated with
new QMs.

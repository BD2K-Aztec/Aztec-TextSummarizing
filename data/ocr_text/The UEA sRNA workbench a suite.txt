ABSTRACT

Summary: RNA silencing is a complex, highly conserved mechanism
mediated by small RNAs (sRNAs), such as microRNAs (miRNAs),
that is known to be involved in a diverse set of biological functions
including development, pathogen control, genome maintenance and
response to environmental change. Advances in next generation
sequencing technologies are producing increasingly large numbers
of sRNA reads per sample at a fraction of the cost of previous
methods. However, many bioinformatics tools do not scale
accordingly, are cumbersome, or require extensive support from
bioinformatics experts. Therefore, researchers need user-friendly,
robust tools, capable of not only processing large sRNA datasets in
a reasonable time frame but also presenting the results in an intuitive
fashion and visualizing sRNA genomic features. Herein, we present
the UEA sRNA workbench, a suite of tools that is a successor to the
web-based UEA sRNA Toolkit, but in downloadable format and with
several enhanced and additional features.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNA silencing is a complex, highly conserved mechanism mediated
by small RNAs (sRNAs) (Chapman and Carrington, 2007). sRNAs,
such as micro RNAs (miRNAs), are typically 20—24 nt in length and
act as guide molecules to regulate gene expression. Next generation
sequencing (NGS) technologies have become the de facto way to
generate sRNA datasets. These datasets often come from several
samples, each consisting of millions of distinct reads. Therefore,
there is an increasing need for computational tools for exploring
and analysing such data.

 

IThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two authors
should be regarded as joint First Authors.
*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Several tools have been developed for NGS sRNA analysis (see
Li et al. (2012) for a recent overview of tools for miRNA analysis).
These are typically command—line driven, focused on a speciﬁc
application (e. g. miRNA detection) and often require installation
of supporting software packages. In addition, many of them lack
tools for visualizing results.

Herein, we present the UEA sRNA workbench, a suite of
interactive J ava—based sRNA analysis tools, which provides an
easy—to—use, well—documented platform to create workﬁows for
processing sRNA NGS data. The workbench is a successor to the
web—based UEA sRNA Toolkit (Moxon et al., 2008), which, since
its establishment in 2009, has received an average of 12000 page
views per month and processed over 5400 sRNA datasets. As well as
being downloadable, the new workbench provides many improved
features compared with the toolkit, with new tools for visualizing
data and processing multiple datasets. In addition, the workbench is
limited only by local memory whereas the toolkit had strict datasize
limits due to the nature of its web—based interfaces. The workbench
can also be command—line driven to allow users to easily plug it into
existing pipelines (Studholme, 2011).

2 DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKBENCH
2.1 Helper tools

° Adaptor remover removes adaptor fragments from raw short
read sequence data and outputs data to FASTA format.

° Filter produces a ﬁltered version of an sRNA dataset,
controlled by several user—deﬁned criteria, including sequence
length, abundance, complexity, transfer and ribosomal RNA
removal.

° Sequence alignment provides a graphical front—end for the
PatMaN (Priifer et al., 2008) sequence alignment tool.

2.2 Computational analysis tools

° miRCat (miRNA categorization) predicts mature miRNAs
and their precursors from an sRNA dataset and a genome.

Fig. 1. Workﬂow examples from the UEA sRNA workbench (data from
Rajagopalan et al. (2006)). (a) After miRCat has classiﬁed miR164, a
secondary structure plot is generated through the Hairpin Annotation tool.
(b) After SiLoCo predicts the miR164 locus in four sRNA samples (including
the sample used in (a)), output is sent to VisSR for visualization. Reads of
lengths 19, 20—21 and 22—23 are coloured pink, red and green, respectively.
(c) ta—siRNA prediction of a TAS gene. The locus is visualized using VisSR

The algorithm uses the technique in Moxon et al. (2008)
for predicting miRNA precursor hairpins. The algorithm has
been enhanced to handle animal datasets and to use multi-
threading hardware, improving run-time performance. Users
are presented with a table containing details of predicted
miRNA candidates and precursors. miRNA candidates are
reported as they are discovered allowing users to immediately
begin down-stream analysis. miRNAs in miRBase (Grifﬁths—
Jones, 2010) are also reported as such.

0 SiLoCo (short interfering RNA locus comparison) compares
sRNA expression levels by grouping sRNAs into loci based
on genomic location (Moxon et al., 2008). SiLoCo has been
extended to allow comparison of multiple samples. The output
is displayed in a table containing normalized abundance of the
sequences and a weighted count on the number of occurrences
in the genome. In addition, the mean abundance score for
the locus and the maximum fold change between normalized
abundances over each sample are reported.

0 ta-siRNA (trans-acting short interfering RNA) prediction is an
implementation of an algorithm proposed in Chen et al. (2007)
for prediction of phased ta—siRNAs in plant sRNA datasets.
Users are presented with the coordinates of the TAS loci and
the phased sRNAs (Fig. lo).

0 miRProf (miRNA proﬁler) determines normalized expression
levels of sRNAs matching known miRNAs in miRBase. This
tool has been enhanced for comparison of miRNA expression
levels across multiple samples. Users are presented with a
table containing raw, normalized and weighted counts of
miRNAs. Users can also combine results through several
criteria including miRNAs containing mismatches, miRNAs
found in different organisms and miRNA variants.

2.3 Visualization tools

Hairpin annotation generates a secondary structure from
an RNA sequence and highlights regions of interest using
RNAplot (Hofacker et al., 1994). This tool can be activated
from miRCat to display predicted miRNA precursors with
both the miRNA and the rr1iRNA>I< highlighted (Fig. 1a).
Alternatively, a user can input long and up to 14 short
sequences to generate a secondary structure. For each
displayed miRNA precursor, the minimum free energy of the
structure is also reported.

VisSR (visualization of sRNAs ) Visualization of sRNA features
can be used to gain insight into their likely biogenesis or
function. To do this, VisSR uses components from GenoViz
(Helt et al., 2009) to generate a visual representation of
sRNAs and user-imported genomic features. Arrows are used
to depict the strand to which a short read maps to, colour
is used to represent the size class of the short read and
thickness illustrates abundance. VisSR can be activated from
various tools to display predicted sRNA loci with each sample
displayed in separate tiers (Fig. 1b), phased sRNAs for both
strands in separate tiers and all unphased 21nt sRNAs in a
further tier (Fig. lo), and predicted miRNAs with miRNA* if
present with the precursor as it appears on the genome. Output
is generated in an image format, suitable for publication.

3 DISCUSSION

The relative low cost of NGS has generated an abundance of sRNA
data necessitating a demand for dedicated bioinformatics support.
The sRNA workbench enables biologists to gain an understanding of
the sRNAome in plants and animals through the efﬁcient processing
of large NGS sRNA datasets, complemented with easily accessible
visualization tools. It is hoped that these tools will enable biologists
to shed light on the key molecular pathways involved in RNA
silencing.

Abstract

Motivation: The generation of a large volume of cancer genomes has allowed us to identify dis—
ease—related alterations more accurately, which is expected to enhance our understanding regard—
ing the mechanism of cancer development. With genomic alterations detected, one challenge is to
pinpoint ca ncer—driver genes that cause functional abnormalities.

Results: Here, we propose a method for uncovering the dominant effects of cancer—driver genes
(DEOD) based on a partial covariance selection approach. Inspired by a convex optimization tech—
nique, it estimates the dominant effects of candidate cancer—driver genes on the expression level
changes of their target genes. It constructs a gene network as a directed—weighted graph by inte—
grating DNA copy numbers, single nucleotide mutations and gene expressions from matched
tumor samples, and estimates partial covariances between driver genes and their target genes.
Then, a scoring function to measure the cancer—driver score for each gene is applied. To test the
performance of DEOD, a novel scheme is designed for simulating conditional multivariate normal
variables (targets and free genes) given a group of variables (driver genes). When we applied the
DEOD method to both the simulated data and breast cancer data, DEOD successfully uncovered
driver variables in the simulation data, and identified well—known oncogenes in breast cancer. In
addition, two highly ranked genes by DEOD were related to survival time. The copy number ampli—
fications of MYC (8q24.21) and TRPS1 (8q23.3) were closely related to the survival time with
P—values=0.00246 and 0.00092, respectively. The results demonstrate that DEOD can efficiently
uncover cancer—driver genes.

1 Introduction

 

By building systematic knowledge about genetic alterations in can—
cer, we can enhance our understanding concerning the mechanisms
of cancer development and so can identify actionable target genes
for cancer treatment. Genomic events in cancer are a mixture of

driving events that promote cancer development and passenger
events that represent random somatic alterations (Beroukhim et 61].,
2007). Hence, it is important to distinguish the two events since ef—
fective therapies against cancer should target dominant driver genes
that promote cell migration and invasion into malignant derivatives

Dominant effects of cancer-driver genes

(Danussi et 61]., 2013). Although many methods based on aberra—
tions in genome sequences, such as copy number changes or muta-
tions, have been proposed to address this challenge, limitations still
remain. For example, Beroukhim et al. (2007) developed an analytic
approach (GISTIC) for identifying significantly aberrant regions of
genomes that are frequently found in multiple tumors. However, the
identified aberrant regions were often large and contained many
neighborhood genes of cancer—driver genes. By incorporating prior
knowledge, several frameworks were designed to represent the po—
tential effects of disease—causing alterations. Using eight sequence—
based and three structure—based predictive features, a prediction
method was developed to estimate the probability of the damaging
effect of a missense mutation (Adzhubei et 61]., 2010). A similar ap—
proach (Kumar et 61]., 2009) was developed to assess the probability
that a non—synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism or a single
amino acid substitution affects protein functions. A scoring function
measuring the effect of a particular mutation was described to cover
activation of neighborhoods in a local pathway (Ng et 61]., 2012).
However, following this method, pathway information was used to
define the existence of edges in the network so that interactions in
only known pathways were considered in the scoring function.

Since disease—causing genetic alterations can be observed from
several data types, such as copy numbers, gene expressions or muta—
tions, various statistical approaches to integrate different data types
were developed. Bayesian network—based methods such as
CONEXIC (Akavia et 61]., 2010) and Multi—Reg (Danussi et 61].,
2013) recommend the highest scoring candidate driver within the
aberrant regions. For example, in CONEXIC, genes in significant
copy number aberrant regions were initially identified as candidate
drivers by using the JISTIC method (Sanchez—Garcia et 61]., 2010), a
modified version of GISTIC. Then, for each candidate, a Bayesian
scoring function was used to measure the inﬂuences of the candidate
driver on the genes in its module, which was constructed by the
Module Networks algorithm (Segal et 61]., 2003). In this process, re—
lationships between driver genes and their target genes were calcu—
lated based on the expression levels of the genes. Hence, the effects
of copy number changes of driver genes on the expression levels of
target genes were not fully incorporated.

In this study, we propose a method for uncovering the dominant
effects of cancer—driver genes (DEOD) on their target genes by incor—
porating both chromosomal changes and expression changes. We first
describe a statistical graph estimation model to construct a gene net—
work from an integration of matched copy number, gene expression
and mutation data. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem,
which minimizes a least square error under a sparsity constraint. To
measure the dominant effect of each gene throughout the entire net—
work, a scoring function is proposed to compare the downstream con—
sequences of a gene’s activity to inﬂuences from upstream regulators.

We first tested the performance of our method using the simu—
lated datasets, which are generated based on the principle of a con-
ditional multivariate normal distribution. Then, we applied the
proposed method to breast cancer data. From TCGA, we collected
genes from three groups, which consist of genes having significant
genomic alteration of copy numbers, mutations or expression
changes. Then, the method was used to uncover the driver genes
that make a dominant contribution to the union of the three types of
alterations. Based on the estimation of directional interaction behav—
iors, the dominant drivers are correctly pinpointed with the highest
scores of contributions, which increase our confidence in the predic—
tion of novel drivers. The results demonstrated that our method effi—
ciently uncovers the dominant behaviors of driver genes under the
investigated conditions.

2 Methods

An overview of the workﬂow is presented in Figure 1. We first
describe a statistical graph estimation model based on a convex opti—
mization technique (Fig. 1A and B). For each gene, it estimates the
incoming effects from the other genes, which are edge scores in a
network in Figure 1C. We then propose a scoring function to meas—
ure the dominant effect of a gene throughout an entire network in
Figure 1D.

2.1 A partial covariance selection model

The entire network is represented as a directed—weighted graph,
(G : (V,IE), where a set of nodes V represents genes, and a set of
edges IE represents the relationships among these genes. We propose
a partial covariance selection (PCS) model to construct a gene net—
work as a directed—weighted graph by integrating DNA copy num-
bers, gene expressions and single nucleotide mutations from the
same matched samples, and protein—protein interactions (PPI). For
each gene, expression changes of the gene are modeled as a combin—
ational effect of DNA copy number changes and DNA sequence mu—
tations of other genes in the network. We assume that alterations in
gene expression are affected by chromosomal aberrations in cancer,
because several studies have shown that copy number aberrations
often influence the expression of genes via changes in expression of
the driver gene (Akavia et 61]., 2010; Cervigne et 61]., 2014).
Furthermore, expression changes of a particular gene in cancer
might not only be inherent from its own copy number or mutation

sets of DNA copy numbers, gene expressions and mutations, and PPl. (B) A
convex optimization problem is formulated to obtain the partial correlation to
represent directional influences from regulators to their targets. All genes in
the network are considered as candidate targets, and a solution to the opti-
mization problem represents weights of influence from regulators to target
genes. (C) For each pair of genes jand [with a non-zero partial correlation co-
efficient, a partial covariance W),- is expressed as a partial correlation between
the copy number change of regulator gene 9, and expression change of the

Finally, we describe a driver score for each gene 9,: by comparing the down-
stream consequences (red edges in D1) of a gene's activity to the incoming
influences (green edges in D1) from its regulators. The colors of the edges in
D1 match with the colors of the equation in D2

status, but also driven by the effects of alteration in copy numbers
and mutations of its dependent neighbors. Based on this assumption,
we simultaneously estimate the weights of all incoming inﬂuences
for each gene by solving the following convex optimization problem
in Equation (1). In the optimization problem, the expression of each
gene can be rewritten as a linear combination of the copy numbers
and the mutation status of its incoming neighbors. In other words,
although each patient could have a different combination of dele—
tions, amplifications and mutations, the optimization problem as—
signs more weights to the most relevant combination of copy
number changes and mutation effects.

Let k and n denote the numbers of cancer samples and genes, re—
spectively. For the ith cancer sample, let 32,-,- denote the gene expres—
sion value of gene g,- and x,; denote the copy number of gene g).
or); = 1 —1— pi] is a damaging coefficient of mutations (multiple muta—
tions for some samples) occurring in the ith sample of gene 1, where
pi; is the sum of the probabilities of damaging effects of the muta—
tions and is calculated using a PolyPhen—2 web server (Adzhubei
et 61]., 2010) and a SIFT algorithm (Kumar et 61]., 2009) that predict
the harmful effect of a mutation occurring in DNA sequences.
Then, we can write the linear relationships mentioned above as
3/), : Z721 ocilxilpll- —1— p0,. Note that cg; is multiplied to x,;. The reason
for adding a value of 1 to pi; in cg; (cg-l : 1 —I— p”) is that the copy
number has still the same value when there is no mutation in the cor—
responding sample, while a higher aberration value is assigned to
the copy number when there is a mutation with a harmful effect.
Thus, our goal is to find the minimum of the least square error func—
tion subject to an 11 norm constraint on p*,- in Equation (1).

where degree(g,-) is the degree of gene g,- in the PPI network. The
right side in the constraint inequality of Equation (1), ranging from
1 to 2, denotes the expected weight of the total incoming effect from
its neighbors to gene gj. For each gene 1', an n—dimensional vector
(p17, p27, . . . , pm), obtained by solving the problem in Equation (1),
represents the weights of incoming effects from the other genes, and
pi,- represents that expressions of gene j itself can be affected by its
own copy number status with mutation effects. p0,- denotes the inter—
cept adjusting the fitness between random variables. Note that an
optimization variable p),- is a partial correlation coefficient represent—
ing the directional relationship between genes 1 and 1'. Consider
the ordinary correlation ﬂu between two random variables X1 and
X2. If X1 and X2 are correlated with n — 2 other variables
X3, X4, . . . ,Xn, we may regard ﬂu as a mixture of a direct correl—
ation between X1 and X2 and an indirect portion due to the presence
of other variables correlating with X1 and X2. The partial correl-
ation measuring the direct portion of the total correlation can be
defined as a correlation between X1 and X2 after removing effects
due to other variables by a linear regression. Therefore, the least
square linear regression coefficients are proportional to the partial
correlation coefficients (for a detailed description, see Fujikoshi
et al., 2010).

An accurate solution to Equation (1) is critical for the robust esti—
mation of relationships among genes in the large—scale network.
Although the objective function in Equation (1) is convex, the 11
norm in the sparsity constraint is a non—smooth function and deriva—
tive—based optimality conditions such as Lagrangian multipliers and

Karush—Kuhn—Tucker (KKT) conditions are not, in general, directly
applicable. An extension of function differentiation such as the sub—
differentiation might be required due to the non—smoothness. The 11
norm constraint can be decomposed as 2" inequality constraints
(Tibshirani, 1996). However, the direct application of the procedure
for handling 2" constraints might not be practically useful for the
large—scale problem. To overcome this issue, we applied the pro—
jected gradient method (Gafni and Bertsekas, 1984) to obtain the
optimal solution. A partial covariance between the copy number sta—
tus of gene g; and the expression value of gene g,- is defined as

wlj Z lpli0(x*,l)0(3’*ai)|’ (2)

where 0(x*I1) and 0(y*I,-) are standard deviations of the copy num—
bers of gene g; and the expressions of gene g,- across all cancer and
normal samples, respectively. Note that the normal samples are used
to measure changes of each gene between normal and cancer condi—
tions (see Supplementary Fig. S1). The partial covariance w),- incorp-
orates three statistical measurements, a directional correlation pl,-
from a regulator g; to its target g], copy number changes of regulator
g; and expression changes of target g], and it is used as the edge score
in the network.

2.2 A scoring function for cancer—driver genes

The alteration of a gene may change cell physiology by directly or
indirectly activating transcriptional cascades involving transcription
factors, master regulators and signaling proteins. The local invasion
might be spread out to normal tissues surrounding the tumor, result—
ing in cell proliferation, migration and differentiation (Akavia et 61].,
2010; Danussi et 61]., 2013).

In this study, we propose a scoring function to measure the po—
tential effect of driver genes throughout the entire network. By com—
paring the downstream effects of a gene’s activity to the inﬂuences
from its upstream regulators, the cancer—driver score of gene gf is
defined as

DS(gf)
—, Eou > M + Ein
DriverScore(gf) = 1 4‘ US(gf) t(gf) (gf) (3)

0, otherwise,

where Eout(gf) : 2,6](gf)wﬂ and Ein(gf) : Ziel(gf)wif denote the
total direct outgoing and incoming edge scores for the gene gf,
respectively, and where Hg) and ﬁg) denote index sets for the
incoming and outgoing neighbors of gf, respectively. M : £22121
Ein(g,-) denotes the mean value of Ein(g,-) of all 11 genes. It implies
that gf is more likely a dominator if its outgoing effect is greater
than the sum of its incoming effect and the mean value of the incom—
ing effects of all genes. US(gf) describes the effects on gf from
its local upstream regulators and DS(gf) describes the effect on
downstream targets driven by the regulator gf. We assume that each
regulator can be activated by the direct neighbors on its upstream
cascades, and then produces carry—over effects on its direct and
indirect targets on the downstream of the regulator. US(gf) is
defined as

U5(gf) = (1 + Wff) Z Wifa
(Elks?)

where wff denotes a partial covariance representing the effect of the
copy number status on its own expression values, and in the net—
work, it is a self—loop that can be either an incoming or an outgoing
edge for gf. Therefore, wff is used to emphasize the effect of the copy
numbers to its own gene expressions in both US(gf) and DS(gf)

network, and L(m) is the index set of downstream target genes of gf,

is the total inﬂuence to gene g,- from its direct incoming neighbors
and it describes how strong g,- is affected by the regulator gf via its
intermediate targets on the paths from gf to g,. If the affection score
is high, the outgoing inﬂuences of g,- on its downstream targets
would be more valuable, where I A (g) is an index set of direct—active
incoming edges into gene g], which are on the paths from gf to g,.
Indeg(g,-) is the number of all incoming edges into gene gj. Note that
if an intermediate target gene g,- is located m distance from its focus—
ing regulator gf, then outgoing effect of g,- should be scaled with i,
which means that target genes longer distances from gf have less
contributions to the accumulation of DS(gf).

To select candidate—driver genes, we estimate a threshold value
of DriverScore(gf) based on a P—value obtained by comparing the
observed network with random networks. A random network is
generated from a random copy number matrix and gene expression
matrix, where the copy number or expression values are randomly
permuted in each matrix. The null hypothesis is that gene expression
values are independent of copy numbers and mutations. By taking
the ratio of random networks (Nmax>obs), in which the maximum
driver score from the random network is larger than the observed
driver score, to the total number of random networks (Nan), P—value
is calculated as (NmaX>ObS/Na11).

Suppose that we have an n—dimensional multivariate normal

distributed random variable Y : (321,322,  ,yn)T ~N(u,2).

Consider partitioning Y :  into x1 : (321,322,  ,yp)T and
x2 : (yp+1,yp+2, . . . ,yn)T with a similar partition of a mean vector
and a covariance matrix Iu :  and Z :   Then,

For a comprehensive review of the conditional distribution, see
Johnson and Wichern (2007). Assuming the conditional distribution
of the partitioned multivariate normal random variables, we con—
structed six simulation datasets: five case datasets (cancer samples)
with different covariance matrices and one reference dataset
(healthy samples). Each dataset represents matched samples of copy
numbers with mutation effects and gene expressions. Each dataset
consists of 500 genes (variables) with 100 samples. For each gene 1',
we draw the mean u,- and the standard deviation 0',- from the uniform
distributions on the observed range of normal data [—0.5, 0.5], and
then calculate the correlation coefficient pi,- for each pair of genes

(1', i). Let u = (111,112, . . . ,u500)T denote the mean vector, and
Z : {01,-}LI21IWI500 denote the covariance matrix, where 0'),- : jail-070',-
is the covariance between genes 1' and j. The reference data were
simulated from joint normal distribution N111, 2). For each of the
case datasets, 10 of 500 genes were selected as driver genes and 200
of the remaining 490 genes were selected as target genes. For each of
the 10 drivers, 20—35 targets were randomly selected from the 200
target genes. For the selected 210 (drivers and targets) genes, mean
values were shifted. For correlations, significantly higher correl-
ations between each driver and its own targets were assigned to rep—
resent interactions between the driver gene and its targets, and
slightly higher correlations were assigned among the 10 driver genes
and among the 200 target genes to represent alternations on the part
of the entire network. In the covariance matrix of the illustration ex-
ample in Figure 2A and B, correlations between each driver and its
own targets are colored in blue, and correlations among drivers and
among targets are colored in red and magenta, respectively. Let Id
and It denote sets of indexes for the driver genes and the target
genes, respectively.

In Figure 2A, if the highlighted part of the entire network repre—
sents a complete graph and the correlation coefficients for all pairs
in that part are similar enough, then the covariance matrix tends to
be symmetric positive semi—definite and the simulation process can
be easily constructed without any theoretical complications.
Unfortunately, the significant part forms an incomplete graph struc—
ture and correlations between the drivers and their own targets are
sufficiently higher than the correlations either between targets or be—
tween drivers. In addition, drivers may share only some of their tar-
gets (in Fig. 2A, driver 328 is connected to its targets 322, 323 and 326
while it is not connected to y1, 324 and 325). Due to this kind of ran—
domness, the covariance matrix itself is neither positive definite nor
positive semi—definite. Hence, we need to find the nearest positive
definite matrix of the covariance matrix.

The problem of finding the nearest positive definite matrix can
be formulated as the following optimization problem

 : minimize  — 
X—XTZO

In other words, any positive definite X satisfying  — X : 8(2))
can be a positive approximation of 21 in the given norm. We applied
the following analytic result from Higham (1988) that gives the so—
lution to the problem of positive approximation in the Frobenius
norm. Let 2) E Rm" be an arbitrary matrix, its symmetric and

skew—symmetric parts be A : (E —l— 225/2 and B : (E — 215/2,
respectively, and A : UP be a polar decomposition. Then, according
to the theorem in Higham (1988), X1"; : (A +P)/2 is the unique
positive approximation of 21 in the Frobenius norm, and the ap—
proximation error is estimated as

8142?: Z Ill-(A)2+||Bllizp,

1,-(A)<0

where A : YAYT is a spectral decomposition of A,
A : diag(21,22,  ,2”) and YTY : I. The performances of the
DEOD method on the simulated datasets with 500 genes are sum—
marized in Figure 2C. When five different covariance matrices were
used, the prediction accuracies varied. An area under the curve
(AUC) value of the true positives and false positive rates was highest
when 6 = 0.8. Although the accuracy decreases when the covariance
decreases, DEOD still gives a high AUC value for even 6 = 0.4, dem—
onstrating that DEOD can successfully uncover a large fraction of
driver genes.

3.2 Analysis on breast cancer data

3.2.1 Datasets

The matched copy number, gene expression and mutation datasets
of the breast cancer samples were downloaded from the TCGA data
portal (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/). We used 506 cancer samples
without missing values in both copy numbers and gene expressions,
and 58 normal samples. We collected 11 852 genes in the union of
the following three datasets.

° A total of 2592 genes located in copy number aberrant regions
were obtained by the GISTIC method (Beroukhim et 61]., 2007).
The copy number value of a gene in a sample was determined
using the hg19 build of the genome (Kent et 61]., 2002).

° Differentially expressed 649 genes forming the condition—speciﬁc
subnetwork were obtained by applying our previously developed
method, WMAXC (Amgalan and Lee, 2014).

° A total of 10 895 genes containing somatic mutations in at least
one of the 506 cancer samples were selected. In 506 samples, a
total of 40 978 mutations occurred.

In terms of PPI data, we downloaded the Human Protein Reference
Database released in 2010 (Prasad et 61]., 2009), which contains
39240 PPI from 9617 genes. We used 21 350 interactions among
the above 11 852 genes.

3.2.2 Driver genes of breast cancer

When we applied the DEOD method to the breast cancer data, 186
genes with a P-value < 0.05 (the driver score > 18.09) were selected
as candidate—driver genes. The P—value was obtained by comparing
with 30 random networks. A list of the 186 genes is shown in
Supplementary Table S1. The 10 highest scoring drivers are shown
in Table 1, and all 10 genes are previously known oncogenes in
breast cancer or in other cancer types, or their cellular changes are
related to cancer. MYC, MDM4, TRPS1, ZNF217, PAX5 and
BANP are known to contribute to breast cancer progression, and
ADAMTSL4, ORAOV1 and AVPR1B have functional roles in other
cancers or cancer—related biological processes. Also, F—box only pro—
tein 31 (FBXO31) is suggested as a candidate tumor suppressor gene
(Kumar et 61]., 2005).

For each of the 186 candidate cancer—driver genes, gene g,- is se—
lected as its target gene if the partial covariance w),- between the
driver gene g; and the gene g,- is > 0.05 in Equation (2). The numbers
of target genes for 186 candidate—driver genes are shown in

Top 10 genes are listed with scores by DEOD, copy number status and
cytobands. They are previously known to be related to breast cancer or other
cancer types, and supporting literatures are shown in the last column.

Supplementary Table 81, which varies from 11 to 4529 with the
mean number :242. To check whether the target genes of a driver
gene are collaboratively working for particular biological functions
or pathways, we performed a functional enrichment test for the tar—
get genes of each drivers. We applied a hypergeometric test followed
by a Benjamin—Hochberg test for multiple comparison corrections
using KEGG pathways (Kanehisa et al., 2000) and Gene Ontology
(GO) terms (Carbon et al., 2009). Target genes of 184 out of 186
genes (98.9%) were enriched with at least one KEGG pathway or
one GO term. The average number of enriched terms was 24. The
numbers of enriched terms are shown in Supplementary Figure S3,
and the list of enriched KEGG pathways for the ten highest scoring
drivers is shown in Supplementary Table 82. The enriched terms in-
clude cancer—related pathways such as ECM—receptor interaction,
P53 signaling pathway and TGF—ﬂ signaling pathway. This result
implies that the target genes of the candidate—driver genes consist of
functionally related genes, and the identified driver genes might play
significant roles in the dysregulation of cancer—related pathways.

In addition, we checked the pathways in which 186 drivers
were enriched. As shown in Supplementary Table S3, 15 KEGG
pathways and four GO terms were enriched, including the ERBB
signaling pathway, a well—known breast cancer—related pathway.
Interestingly, enriched pathways include pathways of other cancer
types such as non—small cell lung cancer, glioma, melanoma, bladder
cancer, pathways in cancer, small cell lung cancer and prostate
cancer.

3.3 MYC deregulation in breast cancer
DEOD identified MYC, a potent activator of tumorigenesis, as the
highest—scoring driver gene. The driver score of MYC was signifi—
cantly higher compared with the second ranked gene. MYC is a
transcription factor and a key regulator of cell growth, proliferation,
metabolism, differentiation and apoptosis (Xu et al., 2010). Its de—
regulation has been found in many cancer types including breast
cancer (Liu et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2010). Both genomic and func—
tional analyses of MYC responsive genes suggest that MYC regu—
lates up to 15% of all humans genes (Chen and Olopade, 2008).
Our analysis showed that the chromosomal region of MYC was
significantly amplified and that the number of MYC downstream
targets is relatively large. 1098 targets are directly affected by MYC.
Figure 3 shows the relationships between the copy number status
of MYC and the expressions of its direct targets. The MYC target
network is enriched with several GO terms such as cell differen—
tiation (P—value:4.427E—21), regulation of cell proliferation

the indexes of the driver and its targets) between the copy numbers and mu-
tation effects of MYC and expression levels of its targets, whereas the sam-
ples are ordered according to the copy numbers of MYC

(P—value : 4.976E — 22), cell migration (P—value : 4.986E — 13) and
cell adhesion (P—value : 3.910E — 19). In addition, 44 KEGG path-
ways were enriched, including well—known breast cancer—related
pathways such as complement and coagulation cascades
(q—value < 1.0E — 31), focal adhesion (q—value : 3.76E — 05) (Zhang
and Chen, 2010), cytokine—receptor interaction (q—value :
1.14E — 05) (Huan et al., 2013), ECM—receptor interaction
(q—value:4.64E—05) (Krupp et al., 2011) and TGF-ﬂ signaling
pathway (q—value: 1.51E — 04) (Scollen et al., 2011). A complete
list of enriched pathways from the KEGG pathways is shown in
Supplementary Table 82.

We further analyzed the relationship between the copy number
changes of MYC and the survival time. Clinical information on
1040 breast cancer patients was downloaded from the TCGA data
portal on October 20, 2014. We first estimated the most aberrant
1% of all copy number values in cancer samples (0.840 for amplifi-
cation and — 0.707 for deletion), and used them as threshold values
to decide samples with copy number aberrations. Then, for each
candidate—driver gene, the survival time of a group of patients whose
copy number status passes the threshold was compared with that of
a group of the same number of patients whose copy number status
was on the opposite of the aberrant group. Survival curves were esti—
mated by a Kaplan—Meier analysis at a series of time points of days,
and the difference between two survival plots was evaluated by a log
rank test. The mean survival time of the high amplified group (158
patients) is shorter (3350 days) than that of the low amplified group
(4354 days) with P—value: 0.00246, which implies that amplifica-
tion of MYC copy number is significantly related to the survival
time. When we performed the survival time analysis for the other
nine candidate—driver genes in Table 1, a similar relationship was

found in the amplifications of TRPS1 (P—value : 0.00092), which is
the third highest scoring dominator in our result and a well—known
oncogene playing an important role in the control of cell cycle and
proliferation during breast cancer development (Wu et 61]., 2014).
The Kaplan—Meier curves for these two genes are shown in Figure 4.
The survival analysis of all the 186 candidate—driver genes was
shown in Supplementary Table S4. Out of 186 genes, the copy num—
bers of 26 genes (16%) were related to the survival time with signifi-
cant P—values. When the threshold for copy number aberration was
estimated based on 5% and 3%, 37 genes (19.8%) and 20 genes
(10.7%) were related to the survival time, respectively
(Supplementary Table S5).

3.4 FBXO31 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene

In addition to the well—known oncogenes, FBXO31 was identified as
a high-scoring dominator. A previous study hypothesized that
FBXO31 is a candidate tumor suppressor in breast cancer, which in—
duces cellular senescence and has consistent properties of tumor sup—
pressors by generating Skp Cullin F—box containing complex (SCF
complex) (Kumar et 61]., 2005 ). To support the above hypothesis, we
further investigated FBXO3 1.

Our analysis shows that in many cancer samples, the chromo—
somal regions of FBXO31 were significantly deleted and FBXO31
was down—regulated, and copy numbers were related with expres—
sion levels (Luff: 0.1231). A target network of FBXO31 includes 740
positively related genes and 788 negatively related genes. Figure 5
displays the relationships between the copy number status of
FBXO31 and the expressions of its direct targets. Target genes of
FBXO31 were significantly enriched with cancer—related GO terms
such as cell differentiation (P : 1.04E — 16), cell development
(P : 6.60E — 09), cell adhesion (P : 2.77E — 05), cell migration
(P : 8.77E — 05 ) and regulation of cell proliferation
(P : 1.084E — 12). Also, 13 KEGG pathways were enriched, includ—
ing breast cancer—related pathways such as p52 signaling and pri-
mary immunodeficiency. A complete list of the pathways is given in
Supplementary Table S2. In conclusion, our findings support the no—
tion that FBXO31 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in breast
cancer.

3.5 Analysis on brain cancer

We compared DEOD with a Multi—Reg (Danussi et 61]., 2013)
method, which is a modified version of CONEXIC (Akavia et 61].,
2010) and was developed by the same research group. We down—
loaded the 242 matched copy number (HG-CGH-244A CN Array),
gene expression (HT HG—U133A or Agilent G45 02A—07) and muta—
tion datasets of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) samples from the

TCGA data portal, which were previously used in Multi—Reg. In
Danussi et al. (2013), using Multi—Reg, 83 genes were recommended
as GBM—driver genes. We used 191 cancer samples without missing
values in both copy numbers and gene expressions. Chromosomal
locations of genes were determined using the hg18 build of the gen-
ome. For the analysis, we used 8362 genes included in the PPI net—
work with 31 485 interactions. When we applied DEOD to GBM
data, 48 genes were selected as candidate GBM cancer—driver genes
(driver scores > 49.01 and P—value < 0.05). A complete list of the 48
genes is given in Supplementary Table S6. The top 10 ranked genes
include well—known oncogenes and tumor suppressors of GBM such
as EGFR, CDKN2A, PTEN, PDGFRA and CDKN2B. For compari-
son with Multi—Reg, we applied the functional enrichment test of
GO terms and KEGG pathways to 48 genes identified by DEOD
and 83 genes identified by Multi—Reg. As a result, 107 and 87 path—
ways were enriched for DEOD and Multi—Reg, respectively. The en—
riched terms include many cancer—related terms such as glioma and
p53 signaling pathways (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8), showing
that both methods recommend GBM—related genes.

In Danussi et al. (2013), the target genes of the identified drivers
were compared against the gene expression signatures of GBM sub—
types in order to show functional properties of candidate—driver
genes. We performed the same analysis with 48 candidate—driver
genes identified by DEOD. For this task, we obtained three groups
of genes whose expression signatures were associated with mesen—
chymal, proneural and proliferative GBM subtypes (Carro et 61].,
2010). Among the 140 mesenchymal, 242 proneural and 181 prolif-
erative genes obtained, 92, 137 and 103 genes were included in the
set of 8362 genes. The candidate drivers selected by Multi—Reg and
DEOD were, respectively, classified into the three molecular signa—
ture groups based on the enrichment of their target genes in the sub—
type—related genes using a hypergeometric test (q—value < 0.05).

numbers of candidate drivers associated with the subtypes; 77 and
58% of candidate—driver genes of DEOD and Multi—Reg, respect—
ively, were related to subtypes.

In addition, we analyzed the relationships between the survival
time and the copy number changes of candidate—driver genes identi—
fied by DEOD and MultiReg. Copy number data (Genome—Wide
Human SNP Array 6.0) and clinical information of 523 GBM pa—
tients were downloaded from the TCGA data portal on March 12,
2015. Similar to the survival time analysis on breast cancer data, the
most aberrant 1% copy numbers of all copy number values in the
GBM data were selected as the threshold values (0.5093 for amplifi-
cation and — 0.8576 for deletion). We found that the copy number
changes of 13 out of 48 driver genes (27.1%) selected by DEOD and
14 out of 83 driver genes (16.8%) selected by Multi—Reg were
related to the survival time with significant P—values. (See
Supplementary Table S9 for a list of genes, P—values, and the number
of samples with copy number aberrations.) Also, fractions of candi—
date—driver genes related to the survival time were shown in
Supplementary Table S10 for the different thresholds of 5%, 3%
and 1%. Across the three thresholds, higher fractions of candidate—
driver genes identified by DEOD were related to the survival time
than those by MultiReg.

4 Discussion

The main advantages of DEOD are as follows: Based on an optimal
combination of copy number deletions and amplifications with mu-
tation effects, DEOD estimates a large—scale graph by integrating
different data types. Different from other methods, DEOD measures
genetic alterations and directional relationships between genes
across different data types (copy number aberration with mutation
effects of regulators to expression change of their targets). A convex
minimization method with a strong theoretical validation of opti—
mality, projected gradient, was implemented to select incoming
edges of each gene as a partial correlation effect from the other genes
in the entire network. A partial covariance is then taken into ac—
count as a combination of three statistical measurements, the partial
correlation from a regulator to its target, copy number changes of
the regulator, and differential expressions of the target to represent
edge scores in the network. For each gene, the scoring function
measures all effects of the candidate—driver gene on the entire net—
work by comparing the accumulation of contributions in down—
stream cascades to the total direct incoming effect from its
upstream.

We further investigated the effect of mutations on gene expres—
sions. For this task, we ran the complete procedure on the breast
cancer data after removing the damaging coefficients of mutations,
09,-, in Equation (1). In this modified experiment, 216 genes were se—
lected as candidate—driver genes with the threshold score of 10.8609,

and the driver scores of several genes with mutations in the multiple
samples were significantly decreased. For example, the driver score
of USH2A decreased from 24.2752 to 1.107 because 27 samples
were mutated in this gene with a high probability of damaging ef-
fects. The numbers of samples with mutations in the driver genes are
shown in Supplementary Table S1. Also, 47 genes were removed
from the original list of drivers and are listed in Supplementary
Table S11. When we manually checked the 10 genes in the list from
literature in PubMed, they were previously known to be related to
breast cancer, showing that mutation information is another import-
ant source in finding driver genes.

Similarly, we investigated the effect of the PPI network. The bin—
ary interactions in the PPI network were used to describe the ex—
pected total incoming effect of each gene in the network. In
Equation (1 ), genes that have high degrees in the PPI network would
be expected to have more total incoming effects due to the inequality
constraint. We ran the DEOD method on breast cancer without PPI.
After excluding the PPI information, 32 candidate drivers whose
driver scores were less than the threshold score of 10.2955 were
removed from the original list of drivers and are listed in
Supplementary Table S12. A comparison statistic for the incom—
ing effects of genes is given in Supplementary Table S13. The
incoming effects and degrees of the genes were higher when the PPI
information was included than when the PPI information was
excluded. This result shows that integration of the PPI information
in DEOD successfully incorporated the observation that
cancer genes have a higher degree in the PPI network (Jonsson and
Bates, 2006).

Our results showed that only some of candidate—driver genes
were related to the survival time in both breast cancer and GBM.
For example, although PTEN is a well—known GBM—driver gene and
the deletion of PTEN is one of the hallmarks in GBM development,
the relationship between the copy numbers and the survival time
was not significant in our study (P—value : 0.0596) and its prognos—
tic significance still remains controversial (Carico et 61]., 2012; Xu et
61]., 2014). Also, the statistical significance of the survival analysis
depends on the thresholds for copy number aberrations, as shown in
Supplementary Tables S5 and S10. For example, in breast cancer,
the copy numbers of FBXO31 were related to the survival time
when the threshold was chosen based on 5% of all the copy numbers
(P—value : 0.04375, the number of samples with aberrations : 262),
while its P—value was not significant when 1% was used
(P—value : 0.22730, the number of samples with aberrations : 61).
There might be several complex relationships between genes and the
survival time. One possible explanation might be the combined ef—
fects of a gene and other molecules (Gross et 61]., 2014) and another
reason might be the chromosomal positions of aberrations or the
role of aberrant domains within the gene (Minaguchi et 61]., 2001).
More analyses are required to reveal the complex relationships be—
tween genes and the survival time.

In this study, we explained the activities of genes based on copy
number changes and mutations, although other molecules or genetic
changes such as microRNAs, transcription factors and methylations
also play significant roles in cancer development. Hence, the identi—
fied driver genes in this analysis may represent a partial list of those
genes that drive changes of cellular activities in cancer. Indeed, the
PCS method can be used to measure relationships between any ex—
planatory factors and response variables. Hence, it is possible to ex—
tend the DEOD method so that driver genes can be identified from
several different types of molecular changes. The extension of the
DEOD method will be our future work to enhance the understand—
ing of cancer development.

In addition to the DEOD method, we designed a novel data
simulation scheme based on conditional multivariate normal ran-
dom variables given a group of specific variables. Compared with a
simulation scheme used in our previous work (Amgalan and Lee,
2014), the novel scheme has the advantages of simulating incom—
plete—directed subgraphs in an entire background graph.

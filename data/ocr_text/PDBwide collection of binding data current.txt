ABSTRACT

Motivation: Molecular recognition between biological macromol-
ecules and organic small molecules plays an important role in various
life processes. Both structural information and binding data of biomo-
lecular complexes are indispensable for depicting the underlying
mechanism in such an event. The PDBbind database was created
to collect experimentally measured binding data for the biomolecular
complexes throughout the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It thus provides
the linkage between structural information and energetic properties of
biomolecular complexes, which is especially desirable for computa-
tional studies or statistical analyses.

Results: Since its first public release in 2004, the PDBbind database
has been updated on an annual basis. The latest release (version
2013) provides experimental binding affinity data for 10776 biomole-
cular complexes in PDB, including 8302 protein—ligand complexes and
2474 other types of complexes. In this article, we will describe the
current methods used for compiling PDBbind and the updated
status of this database. We will also review some typical applications
of PDBbind published in the scientific literature.

Availability and implementation: All contents of this database are
freely accessible at the PDBbind-CN Web server at http://www.
pdbbind-cn.org/.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biological macromolecules (proteins and nucleic acids) often
execute their functions via molecular recognition with other
biological macromolecules or organic small molecules. Charac-
terization of the interactions between molecular complexes is
thus helpful for interpreting the mechanism of various life
processes. Modern X-ray crystallography and multidimensional
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques have produced a
wealth of structural information of molecular complexes. The
worldwide Protein Data Bank (PDB) holds the largest open

resource for experimentally determined biomolecular structures
(Berman et al., 2003). It has been growing rapidly during the past
20 years or so. By June 2014, over 100 000 structures had already
been deposited into PDB. A number of derivative databases
based on PDB have been developed with their own scopes and
emphases, such as PDBsum (Laskowski, 2001), Relibase + (Hen-
dlich et al., 2003), Het—PDB Navi (Yamaguchi et al., 2004) and
scPDB (Kellenberger et al., 2006). These databases provide
annotated protein—ligand complex structures or their special
features, such as binding pockets and ligand molecules. Collec-
tively, the structural information provided by these databases
allows visual examination of interactions between a wide range
of molecular complexes.

On the other hand, energetic properties are also indispensable
for obtaining an in-depth understanding of such events. Here,
the major problem is that energetic data, such as binding data,
are often scattered in the huge pool of literature so that they are
difﬁcult to access. To tackle this problem, some existing
databases started to incorporate binding data; for example,
ChEMBL (Gaulton et al., 2012) and PubChem (Bolton et al.,
2008; Wang et al., 2014) are perhaps the two most comprehen-
sive databases in this category. They currently provide a large
amount of experimental binding data of diverse bioactive com-
pounds as well as relevant information on molecular targets,
experimental conditions, etc. Other databases were created with
a focus on binding data, e.g. BindingDB (Liu et al., 2007) and
PDSP Ki (Roth et al., 2000). Obviously, the rich knowledge of
the interactions between bioactive small molecules and their po-
tential targets provided by these databases is widely welcomed by
chemical biologists and medicinal chemists.

Nevertheless, the link between structural information and
energetic properties is desirable especially for theoretical and
computational studies on molecular recognition. This link is
missing, or at least not the primary focus of the databases men-
tioned above. With more and more successful applications of
computational methods to modern drug discovery (Manetti
et al., 2008; Schames et al., 2004; Wlodawer, 2002), the require-
ment for a combined knowledge of structures and binding data
has become increasingly urgent. To fill the gap between struc-
tural information and energetic properties of biomolecular
complexes, a practical strategy is to collect experimentally
measured binding data for the biomolecular complexes deposited

in the PDB. Currently, PDBbind (\Nang, et al., 2004, 2005)
and binding MOAD (Benson et a]. 2008; Hu et a]. 2005)
are two outstanding databases created for this purpose. Both
of them are based on a systematic sampling of the entire
PDB. A few early databases also belong to this category, includ-
ing LPDB (Roche et a]. 2001), PLD (Puvanendrampillai et a],
2003) and AfﬁDB (Block et al., 2006), but they are much
smaller in size and have undergone virtually no updates since
original release. A summary of current databases collecting
structural information and/or binding data of protein—ligand
complexes in all three categories is given in the Supplementary
Table S1.

The PDBbind database was originally developed by Prof.
Shaomeng Wang’s group at the University of Michigan
and was first released to the public on May, 2004. Since 2007,
this database has been maintained and further developed by
our group at the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry in
China under a mutual agreement with the University of
Michigan. Since then, the database has been released through
the PDBbind-CN Web server at http://www.pdbbind-cn.org/
and http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/. Over the years, we have
regularly updated the PDBbind database to keep pace with
the growth of PDB itself. The methods for compiling the
database have also been improved along the way. The latest
release of PDBbind, i.e. version 2013, provides binding data
for >10 700 molecular complexes in the PDB, making it the
largest collection of its kind to date. In all, >2400 registered
users from some 40 countries access this database regularly.
There are also a large number of anonymous users around the
world. In this article, we will describe the current methods used
for compiling the PDBbind and its updated status. We will also
review some typical applications of PDBbind published in the
scientiﬁc literature to illustrate the signiﬁcant value of this
database.

2 METHODS FOR COMPILING THE PDBBIND
DATABASE

2.1 Classiﬁcation of biomolecular complexes

The ﬁrst step of our entire workﬁow is to classify the valid
biomolecular complexes deposited in the PDB. This task is
fairly complicated, as PDB itself does not provide a clear and
systematic classiﬁcation on whether a PDB structure is a
‘complex’. Our early experience was that keyword-based analysis
of the text annotations in PDB ﬁles missed too many true
complexes. Thus, we have developed a classiﬁcation scheme
completely based on the structural information given in the
PDB ﬁle. This scheme is automated by a set of in-house
programs, and has been continuously reﬁned over the past
years. The basic ﬂowchart of our current scheme is shown in
Figure 1. The input is a standard PDB-format structure ﬁle.
Our program will then classify the given structure as a non-com-
plex (pure protein or nucleic acid molecule), a complex but not in
our interests or a valid complex. Valid complexes include four
major categories, i.e. (i) complexes formed between protein and
small-molecule ligand, (ii) complexes formed between nucleic
acid and small-molecule ligand, (iii) complexes formed between

two protein molecules and (iv) complexes formed between
protein and nucleic acid.

The ﬂowchart shown in Figure l is basically self-explanatory.
Yet, a few issues need to be explained in more detail. First, our
scheme relies on a dictionary to distinguish ‘valid’ organic
ligand molecules from biological cofactors/coenzymes, inor-
ganic ions, buffer components, organic solvent molecules and
other miscellaneous ‘heterogens’ included in PDB ﬁles. This
dictionary is compiled based on the standard ‘Chemical
Component Dictionary’ provided by the PDB. It has been
updated annually along with the PDBbind database itself.
Second, the deﬁnition of a ‘valid’ protein—protein complex is
also a bit complicated. In our scheme, a valid protein—protein
complex must be formed by at least two peptide chains from
two different protein molecules. A homodimer or multimer of
the same protein molecule is not counted. Each peptide chain in
the complex should have at least 20 amino acid residues. This
cutoff is chosen because Trp-cage, which has 20 residues, is
arguably the smallest functional protein. Our program also
examines the number of interacting residues on the binding
interface of two peptide chains. Here, we follow Tsai’s
method (Tsai et al., 1996) to deﬁne interacting residues. A
valid protein—protein complex must have at least 10 interacting
residues at each side. Otherwise, the binding interface is prob-
ably the result of a crystal packing rather than a meaningful
molecular recognition process.

As of January 1, 2013, there were 87085 experimentally
determined structures released by the PDB. Classiﬁcation of
these structures by our scheme is given in Table 1. Four cate-
gories of valid complexes, including 29 008 protein—ligand com-
plexes, 5341 protein—protein complexes, 3852 protein—nucleic
acid complexes and 717 nucleic acid—ligand complexes, were
considered in the following steps.

2.2 Collection of binding data

The second step of our workﬁow is to collect binding afﬁnity
data from the scientiﬁc literature for biomolecular complexes
classiﬁed as ‘valid’. Our focus is the ‘primary reference’ provided
in each relevant PDB structure ﬁle. This strategy offers a good
chance to obtain the desired binding data by examining a single
article and has been proven to be effective over the years. The
real challenge at this step is that binding afﬁnity data as well as
relevant information (such as binding assay method and experi-
mental settings) have to be retrieved from the given reference
manually. Virtually no journals offer such data in a standard
format. To reduce labor, we have developed a set of computer
scripts to conduct a keyword-based search through the full text
of a given article. Only the articles containing clues of binding
data will be examined manually. Each such article is then exam-
ined independently by two persons. Binding data will not be
formally recorded unless both persons obtain a consistent
result. This quality-control practice effectively reduces human
mistakes in our data to a low level.

It needs to be reemphasized that every single binding data in
the PDBbind was retrieved from an original reference rather
than copied from other data resources. Up to now, we have
processed >24 000 scientiﬁc publications in total. We actually
mark where the binding data were found in the original

reference. Thus, if someone is suspicious of any data in our data-
base, we can easily ﬁnd its origin in our archives and make a
correction when necessary.

We record three major forms of binding data: the dissociation
constant (Kd), the inhibition constant (K) and the concentration
at 50% inhibition (IC50). If multiple forms of binding data of a
given complex are available, we actually record all of them but
present the end user with only the most preferred data with a
priority order of Kd>Ki>IC50. Similarly, if the binding data of
a given complex is measured under different experimental set-
tings, we present the end user with only the data measured at
room temperature and neutral pH or a condition closest to this
setting.

The overall ‘yield ratio’ at this step is 25—30%, i.e. binding
data can be found for 25—30% of the valid complexes identiﬁed
at the previous step. In addition to binding data, we also record
the basic structural and biological/chemical information of each
complex, such as release year, resolution and R-factor of the
crystal structure, protein name, protein sequence, ligand name,
ligand structure, enzyme commission (EC) number and so on.
Although such information is also available from other

databases, such as PDB, integration of such information helps
the user to ﬁnd the desired information more conveniently.

2.3 Further processing of datasets

A major motivation for creating the PDBbind database is to
provide high-quality datasets for the development of molecular
docking and scoring methods for structure-based drug design.
The protein—ligand complexes with known binding data
compiled through the previous steps, which we call the ‘general
set’, are not recommended to serve directly as such a dataset.
This is because many complexes still may have a problem either
with their structures or binding data, and thus, are not ‘healthy’
enough for docking/scoring studies. The size of the general set is
also too large for this purpose.

Therefore, as an additional feature of PDBbind, we provide
users a set of protein—ligand complexes selected out of the gen-
eral set since the ﬁrst public release (version 2004). We call this
dataset the ‘reﬁned set’. A fairly complicated set of rules is
applied to the selection of the reﬁned set with considerations of
(i) the quality of the complex structures, (ii) the quality of the
binding data and (iii) the biological/chemical nature of the com-
plex. This set of rules has also evolved over the years to become
more and more stringent. The current rules have been described
in detail in our recent publication (Li et al., 2014a). In PDBbind
version 2013, 2959 protein—ligand complexes are included in the
‘reﬁned set’. In addition, to make the reﬁned set readily readable
by most molecular modeling software, the original PDB struc-
tural ﬁle of each complex is split into a protein molecule and a
ligand molecule. Both partners in each complex are processed
properly and saved in standard formats (such as PDB, M012 and
SDF). All these processed structural ﬁles together with the bind-
ing data can be downloaded as a package from our PDBbind-
CN Web site.

Furthermore, a subset of protein—ligand complexes, which we
call the ‘core set’, is selected out of the reﬁned set as a standard
benchmark for evaluating docking/scoring methods. This is be-
cause there is considerable sample redundancy in the reﬁned set.
For example, nearly 10% of the protein—ligand complexes in the
reﬁned set are formed by HIV-l protease. Our opinion is that a
standard benchmark needs to control sample redundancy, other-
wise the evaluation results could be biased. Since PDBbind
version 2007, we have started to compile the core set through
systematic sampling of the reﬁned set. The rules for selection of
the core set have also evolved during the past years. The current
rules have been described in our recent publication (Li et al.,
2014a). The core set in PDBbind version 2013 contains 195
protein—ligand complexes in 65 families. The core set can also
be downloaded as a package from our PDBbind-CN Web site.

Protein—protein complexes and protein—nucleic acid complexes
have been added to PDBbind since version 2008 (Table 2).
In version 2013, there are already 1804 protein—protein
complexes and 587 protein—nucleic acid complexes with known
experimental binding data. Computational studies on the
molecular recognition between biological macromolecules need
high-quality datasets as well. We are now working on deﬁning
the rules for selecting these two types of complexes. Reﬁned sets
for these two types of complexes will be provided in PDBbind in
the near future.

2.4 Design of Web site interface

The PDBbind database is now accessible at the PDBbind-CN
Web server (http://www.pdbbind-cn.org and http://www.
pdbbind.org.cn/). Users can browse, analyze and search the con-
tents of PDBbind on this Web interface. The basic interface is the
‘BROWSE’ page, where users can view all entries in PDBbind
one by one. This page provides binding data and other basic
information of each complex. Users can view the 3D structure
of the complex, or only the binding pocket, the protein molecule
or the ligand molecule with various display options powered by a
Java plug-in ‘MarvinView’ released by ChemAxon (Fig. 2A). On
this page, hyperlinks to some external databases, including PDB,
PDBsum and PubChem, are also provided so that users can get
other information about the complex conveniently. Under
mutual agreement, users can also ﬁnd the binding data provided
by PDBbind on the Web pages of PDB, PDBsum and PubChem.

A text-based search function is provided on the ‘DATA’ page,
which enables three search methods. A number of queries can be
used, including complex subset type, PDB code, protein name,
ligand name, EC number, release year, resolution, binding data
and so on. Users can save outcomes as an Adobe PDF or
Microsoft Excel table, and download the related structure ﬁles
(Fig. 2B). Substructure or similarity search of the organic ligand
molecules is provided on the ‘STRUCTURE’ page. A user can
input a SMILES text string, or draw a structure with the
MarvinSketch plug-in to conduct the structure search
(Fig. 2C). This search is carried out over all organic ligand mol-
ecules in the PDB, not limited to the scope of the PDBbind. The
latest release of PDBbind contains >11000 organic ligand mol-
ecules from the PDB. A sequence-based search of protein or
nucleic acid molecules is provided on the ‘SEQUENCE’ page.
Users can carry out a BLAST similarity search among all protein
and nucleic acid sequences throughout the PDB. A user can
input a sequence in the FASTA format to conduct the search.
The outcomes can be viewed online or can be downloaded
(Fig. 2D).

3 UPDATES OF PDBbind AND FACTS OF THE
CURRENT RELEASE

As the PDBbind database was released at our PDBbind-CN
Web server in 2007, we have been able to update it on an
annual basis to keep up with the growth of the PDB. To conduct
an update, we download the entire PDB in the ﬁrst week of each
year, and then complete the classiﬁcation, data collection, data
processing and Web design steps in the next few months. The
newly released version is therefore named after the release year.
Table 2 gives a summary of the basic information of each version
after 2007. One can see that the binding data in PDBbind has
increased around 15% each year. Compared with version 2007,
the binding data in the current release (version 2013) have almost
tripled. Originally, PDBbind only included complexes formed
between protein and organic ligand molecules because this type
of complex is of direct interest for drug discovery. An ambitious
expansion since version 2008 also includes complexes formed
between biological macromolecules, i.e. protein—protein com-
plexes and protein—nucleic acid complexes. Thereafter,

aThis table does not include early versions of PDBbind before 2007.

bThis is an estimated number, as version 2014 was under compilation at the time of writing.

PDBbind has become a true PDB-wide collection of binding
data.

The latest release of PDBbind is version 2013, which provides
the experimental binding data and structures of 10 776 molecular
complexes in the PDB. Among them are 8302 protein—ligand
complexes, 1804 protein—protein complexes, 587 protein—nucleic
acid complexes and 83 nucleic acid—ligand complexes (Table 2).
The binding data in this version include 4682 Kd values, 3028 K
values and 3066 IC50 values, spanning over 15 orders of magni-
tude from 0.29 fM to 400 mM. The distribution of these binding
data for four categories of complexes is shown in Figure 3. One
can see that all three types of binding data are signiﬁcantly
populated for protein—ligand complexes, whereas the binding
data for the other three categories of complexes are primarily
reported as Kd values in the literature.

4 TYPICAL APPLICATIONS OF THE PDBbind
DATABASE

Since the public release of PDBbind in 2004, it has been used by
a growing number of researchers worldwide. We have noticed
that the registered PDBbind users have quite different back-
grounds. Sometimes they use the PDBbind data in ways
beyond our original expectation. According to our survey,
>120 studies using PDBbind data have already been published
in the literature. We will brieﬂy review some typical applications
below. Hopefully, our descriptions will inspire the readers to
invent even more ingenious ways of applying the PDBbind
database.

4.1 Development and validation of docking/scoring
methods

A primary motivation for creating the PDBbind database is to
provide high-quality datasets for developing and validating scor-
ing functions and docking methods. Indeed, a fair number of
research groups use our database in this way. For example,
Olson et a]. developed AutoDock Vina, a new program for mo-
lecular docking and virtual screening (Trott and Olson, 2010)

with ~100-fold speedup and improved binding pose predictions
as compared with the previous AutoDock 4. The scoring func-
tion in the AutoDock Vina was calibrated on the PDBbind
reﬁned set. Other recently published scoring functions, which
used protein—ligand complex datasets from PDBbind include
NNScore (Durrant and McCammon, 2010), DSX (Neudert
and Klebe, 2011), PHOENIX (Tang et a]. 2011), LISA (Zheng
et a]. 2011), B2BScore (Liu et a]. 2013), SFCscore (Zilian and
Sotriffer, 2013), ID-Score (Li et al., 2013a), KECSA (Zheng et a].
2013) and many others.

Our group has also applied PDBbind extensively in this area.
For example, we have developed the CASF benchmark, i.e.
comparative assessment of scoring functions, over the past
years. The ﬁrst published study was CASF-2007 (Cheng et al.,
2009). An updated study, i.e. CASF-2013, was recently published
(Li et al., 2014a, b). This benchmark aims at providing an object-
ive and systematic evaluation of scoring function performance,
which can be shared among the community. The PDBbind core
set served as the primary test set in this benchmark. Another
example was a test of the MM-PB/SA method on a set of 24
protein—ligand complexes selected from the PDBbind database
(Li et a]. 2010). All of these complexes have multiple conform-
ations determined by an NMR technique so that the standard
conformational sampling method in MM-PB/SA can be
evaluated.

Here, we want to mention in particular that the PDBbind
reﬁned set as well as the core set is compiled by a set of standards
reﬂecting the commonsense in docking/ scoring studies, which we
expect to serve the majority in this community. The users of
course have the freedom to make selections among the rough
data provided by PDBbind based on their own standards.
For example, if one is particularly interested in complexes in
which a metal ion mediates the interactions between protein
and ligand, he/she can compile a subset of such protein—ligand
complexes out of the general set or the reﬁned set in PDBbind.
The users are welcome to do so, and we hope that they are
willing to share their selections with others. However, for
obvious reasons, we cannot respond to every request of this
type from the users.

4.2 Analysis of drug—target interactions and
structure-based drug design

The protein—ligand complexes included in PDBbind cover a wide
range of validated and potential drug targets and many bioactive
organic molecules. Such information can be used to study the
complex interactions between drugs and their targets. One
example is the application of network pharmacology to predict
drug effect and toxicity resulting from multi-target interactions.
Hsin et a]. (2013) presented an interesting computational
approach that combines two machine learning systems and

multiple molecular docking methods to assess binding potentials
of a given compound against multiple target proteins in a com-
plex molecular network. Both systems were built and validated
by using the PDBbind reﬁned set (version 2007).

Ligands with known binding data in PDBbind were also used
to build a statistical model for discriminating drugs and non-
drugs by Garcia-Sosa et a]. (2012). In their study, a probabil-
ity-based approach was introduced for quantitative classiﬁcation
of compounds as drugs and non-drugs. Disease and organ-spe-
ciﬁcity was also taken into account. In addition to demonstrating
good predictive power, their classiﬁcation model is chemically

Liu et a]. (2009) presented a quantitative model regarding the
relationship between the intrinsic disorder in protein structure
and its biological function. Their predictions were validated by
genome-wide surveys on both the level of disorder in protein
functions as deﬁned by the GO ontology (The Gene Ontology
Consortium, 2000) and binding data from PDBbind. Their re-
sults indicate that both catalytic and low-afﬁnity proteins prefer
ordered structures; while only high-afﬁnity proteins can have
disordered structures. Their results also suggest that binding af-
ﬁnity can be tuned by increasing structural disorder to maximize
the speciﬁcity of promiscuous interactions. This study provides a
new point of view for understanding the mechanism of protein—
ligand interactions.

Recently, we conducted a statistical survey of the so-called
characteristic interaction patterns (CIPs) on protein—protein
binding interfaces from PDBbind (Li et al., 2013b). Common
CIPs shared by different protein—protein binding interfaces
were analyzed with the annotated functions from the GO ontol-
ogy. We concluded that protein—protein interfaces having
common CIPs with high conservation scores are usually asso-
ciated with identical or similar biological functions. Based on the
detection of CIPs at a protein—protein binding interface, we also
proposed a fragment-based strategy for designing small-molecule
inhibitors of protein—protein interactions by using the large
library of protein—ligand complex structures in PDBbind. By
comparing the CIPs at protein—protein interfaces with those at
protein—ligand interfaces, appropriate fragments were truncated
from known ligand molecules and then assembled to form com-
plete ligand molecules. We applied this strategy to the de novo
design of Bcl-2 family proteins, a familiar protein—protein

interaction target (Ding et al., 2013). A number of designed mol-
ecules were synthesized and tested, and some of them proved to
be effective binders of the Mcl—l protein.

5 SUMMARY

The PDBbind database aims to provide a PDB-wide collection of
binding data for various biomolecular complexes. Since its ﬁrst
public release in 2004, the PDBbind database has been updated
on an annual basis. The latest release (version 2013) provides
experimental binding data for 10 776 biomolecular complexes
in PDB, including 8302 protein—ligand complexes and 2474
other types of complexes. All contents are freely accessible at
the PDBbind-CN Web server (http://www.pdbbind-cn.org/).
This database offers a valuable knowledge basis for computa-
tional studies of molecular recognition, structure-based drug
design, statistical analysis of drug—target interaction network
and many other applications. The PDBbind database is expected
to reach a new level in terms of size and data quality in the
coming years.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Plant microRNA prediction tools that use small RNA-
sequencing data are emerging quickly. These existing tools have at
least one of the following problems: (i) high false-positive rate; (ii) long
running time; (iii) work only for genomes in their databases; (iv) hard to
install or use. We developed miR-PREFeR (miRNA PREdiction From
small RNA-Seq data), which uses expression patterns of miRNA and
follows the criteria for plant microRNA annotation to accurately predict
plant miRNAs from one or more small RNA-Seq data samples of the
same species. We tested miR-PREFeR on several plant species. The
results show that miR-PREFeR is sensitive, accurate, fast and has
low-memory footprint.

1 INTRODUCTION

Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are ~21-nt-long non-coding RNAs
that play important roles in transcriptional and post-transcrip-
tional regulation of gene expression (Zhang et al., 2006).
Recently developed genome-wide miRNA annotation tools all
use small RNA-Seq data to quantify the expression of annotated
miRNAs and to predict novel ones Wang et al., 2009; Yang and
Li, 2011; Hackenberg et al., 2011; Axtell, 2013). These tools
suffer from several of the following problems. First, these tools
usually have variable sensitivity and high false-positive (FP) rate
when applied to different species. Second, most of existing NGS-
based tools are slow. Third, most existing command-line—based
tools are not user friendly. Web-server tools, such as
miRanalyzer (Hackenberg et al., 2011), are easy to use. But
they usually only work for genomes in their databases, which
inhibit users to analyze new genomes. In addition, most of
web-server tools also have other problems listed here. Thus,
there is a need for a plant miRNA prediction tool that has
good performance (high sensitivity, low FP rate and accurate),
works for all plant genomes, runs fast, has a small memory foot-
print and is easy to use.

miR-PFEFeR uses expression patterns of miRNAs and fol-
lows the criteria for plant microRNA annotation (Meyers et al.,

2008) to accurately predict plant miRNAs from one or more
small RNA-Seq data samples. It has high sensitivity and low
FP rate. miR-PREFeR is much faster and uses less memory
than existing tools. Using miR-PREFeR requires minimum in-
formatics expertize: it has low dependency on other programs;
there is no need to compile or install the pipeline; it provides a
checkpoint feature, which makes it easy to continue an unﬁn-
ished job from where it was stopped; and the documentation is
publicly available. The miR—PREFeR pipeline is in the process of
being incorporated into the MAKER-P genome annotation
engine (Campbell et al., 2014).

2 DESCRIPTION OF THE PIPELINE

The miR-PREFeR pipeline takes a FASTA format genome ﬁle
of a species and one or multiple SAM format small RNA-Seq
read alignment ﬁles of the same species as input. Users can input
an optional annotation ﬁle in GFF 3 format to specify regions
that are already annotated. The output includes the following:
(i) An HTML table that summarizes the results of the predicted
miRNAs. It contains the number of predictions, the length dis-
tribution of the predicted mature miRNA sequences, the list
of all pre-miRNA sequences and their secondary structures
and the detailed read mapping proﬁles against the pre-miRNA
sequences. In addition, this table provides search links to
mirBase (Kozomara and Grifﬁths-J ones, 2011). (ii) Separate
ﬁles for easy downstream analysis. Details about the ﬁles can
be found in the Supplementary File.

The pipeline ﬁrst generates candidate regions and candidate
mature sequences of each candidate region based on the align-
ment depth. In the next step, these regions are folded using
RNALfold (Lorenz et al., 2011). Regions with qualiﬁed stem-
loop structures are then examined using published plant miRNA
annotation criteria (Meyers et al., 2008). The primary criteria is
that the small RNA-Seq data should provide evidence of precise
miRNA/miRNA* excision. Other criteria are mainly related to
structure characteristics of the miRNA/miRNA* duplex. In add-
ition to the annotation criteria, expression information from
multiple small RNA-Seq data samples (if the input contains
more than one sample) is also used to improve the accuracy of
the prediction. Details of the method can be found in the
Supplementary File.

By default, the pipeline makes a checkpoint after each major
step of a job, and makes checkpoints periodically within the
time-consuming folding stage. Users can easily set the checkpoint
granularity in the conﬁguration ﬁle. This provides users an easy
way to restart unﬁnished jobs. For example, it is possible that a

job running on a high-performance computing system is killed
because of resource limits, or the laptop that the user works on
runs out of battery. By restarting a job from the latest checkpoint
other than starting it from the beginning, a lot of time/resources
can be saved for long-running jobs on large plant genomes. As
far as we know, miR-PREFeR is the ﬁrst microRNA prediction
tool that provides such a useful feature.

3 IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS

miR-PREFeR is implemented using Python. There is no need for
the users to install it, and it works under Linux/MacOS/
Windows. The pipeline is able to use multiple CPUs/cores auto-
matically. This makes the pipeline much faster than existing pro-
grams and is easier for the users to use their computational
resources.

We benchmarked miR-PREFeR and several popular or newly
developed NGS-based miRNA prediction tools including
ShortStack (Axtell, 2013), miRDeep-P Wang and Li, 2011),
miRanalyzer (Hackenberg et al., 2011), miRDeep2
(Friedlander et al., 2012), miRDeep* (An et al., 2013) and
MIReNA (Mathelier and Carbone, 2010). The features of the
tools can be found in Supplementary Table S1. We used two
datasets from Arabidopsis thaliana to evaluate the performance
of the tools. The ﬁrst dataset, Athl-2, which contains two sam-
ples, is the dataset used in the ShortStack paper (Axtell, 2013).
The second dataset, Athl-6, contains six published samples from
different tissues/conditions. The details of the datasets can be
found in the Supplementary Table S2. Table 1 shows the per-
formance of each tool on the two datasets. miRanalyzer has the
best sensitivity, but the numbers of predictions are large on both
datasets. It is likely that most of these predictions are F P predic-
tions. It should be noted that miRanalyzer tries to detect anno-
tated miRNAs that are saved in its own database. This is why its
sensitivity is higher than all other tools. miRDeep2, miRDeep*
and MIReNA have low sensitivity on both datasets, which indi-
cates that they should not be the ﬁrst choice for annotating plant
miRNA. ShortStack is designed to be speciﬁc; thus, it has the

lowest F P rate and reasonable sensitivity. miR-PREFeR has the
second highest sensitivity and low F P rate. The predictions from
miR-PREFeR have large intersections with predictions from
ShortStack (See Supplementary Fig. S4). Details about the data-
sets and experiments from more species (maize, Medicago,
papaya and peach) can be found in the Supplementary File.

Most of the predictions from miR-PREFeR correspond to
previously annotated miRNAs. In all, 77.8% of the miR-
PREFeR-predicted miRNAs have the same start positions as
their annotations. In all, 81% of the predictions have the same
lengths as the annotations. The high consistency was also
observed in a large-scale study about miRNA isoforms in
A.thaliana (Jeong et al., 2013). On the other hand, other tools
show much lower consistency with previously annotated
miRNAs. More detailed analysis can be found in section 3.1 of
the Supplementary File.

miR-PREFeR achieves 4 x ~37 x speedup compared with
ShortStack, which can annotate other types of small RNAs
and is the second fastest tool (see Supplementary Tables S4
and S5). miRDeep—P and MIReNA have long running time on
both datasets. Without manually parallelizing the jobs, it is even
difﬁcult to run the two tools on small genomes on a personal
computer. miR-PREFeR uses less memory than the other tools
on both datasets.

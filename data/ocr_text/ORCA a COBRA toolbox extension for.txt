ABSTRACT

Summary: Over past decades, constraint-based modelling has
emerged as an important approach to obtain referential information
about mechanisms behind biological phenotypes and identify physio-
logical and perturbed metabolic states at genome-scale. However,
application of this novel approach to systems biology in biotechnology
is still hindered by the functionalities of the existing modelling software.
To augment the usability of the constraint-based approach for various
use scenarios, we present ORCA, a Matlab package, which extends
the scope of established Constraint-Based Reconstruction and
Analysis metabolic modelling and includes three unique functionalities:
(i) a framework method integrating three analyses of multi-objective
optimization, robustness analysis and fractional benefit analysis,
(ii) metabolic pathways identification with futile loop elimination and
(iii) a dynamic flux balance analysis framework incorporating kinetic
constraints.

Availability and implementation: ORCA is freely available to
academic users and is downloadable from https://sourceforge.net/
projects/exorca/; a mini-tutorial is supplied in the package for training
purposes as well as a software manual.

1 INTRODUCTION

The recent advance in high-throughput technology has vastly
increased the availability of the biological information, for
reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMs).
These can serve as a detailed representation of biological reaction
networks and their functional states. For investigating GSMs
in both academic and industrial settings, the Constraint-Based
Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) software (Schellenberger
et al., 2011) has been established as a popular tool since 2007.
Nevertheless, the systematic application of GSMs for model-
driven discovery has much scope to be further developed. For
example, although the original COBRA toolbox does include a
variety of methods for modelling GSMs, it still lacks ready-made
functions for users to model the competition between multi-
objectives, commonly encountered in bioengineering. This indi-
cates that there is an urgent need to develop novel simulation

methodologies and tools, to interrogate and interpret the infor-
mation in the GSMs in integrative, systemic and meaningful
ways. To facilitate this emerging direction in research, we have
developed a number of MATLAB functions, collectively pack-
aged and named as ORCA (mOdel-dRiven disCovery and
Analysis) toolbox, supplementary to the existing COBRA func-
tions. These ORCA functions are intended to take advantage of
existing COBRA models, for us to (i) obtain information on the
capability of an interesting microorganism for desired metabolite
production, (ii) understand the correlation between the perturb-
ation of the surrounding metabolism, and the preferable metab-
olite synthesis, and (iii) investigate how dynamic changes of
external metabolite concentrations in the environment affect
the yield of desirable metabolites in a reactor. The tool has
been used to elucidate the inherent potential of several promising
biocatalysts for microbial fuel cell electricity production and
some of the base mathematics of ORCA have been discussed
in the literature (Mao and Verwoerd, 2013a, b, c).

2 FEATURES

ORCA conducts flux balance analysis (FBA)—based methods
with multi-objective formulation and extends the robustness ana-
lysis of COBRA into a framework context (Fig. 1). It incorpor-
ates a simple algorithm excluding the futile ﬂuxes encountered
during FBA and allows identification of the pathways pertaining
to the metabolite of interest. ORCA also includes an updated
version of the ‘dynamicFBA (dFBA)’ of COBRA. The incorp-
oration of kinetic properties of the environment nutrient uptake
was proposed in the literature (Mahadevan et al., 2002). In our
updated version, limitations on biomass growth resulting from,
for example, nutrient depletion can be incorporated by rate-
of—change constraints and substrate uptake rates modelled by
Michaelis—Menten or Hill-equation kinetics. The new ‘dFBA’
function allows for unlimited number of substrates and products
to be taken into account by automatically forming correspond-
ing ordinary differential equations (ODEs). A listing of individ-
ual functions and a full discussion of how ORCA complements
COBRA are provided in the Supplementary file.

2.1 Reconciliation functions

Because several modifications are to be accommodated in the
COBRA model before the ORCA modelling, we have included
a number of reconciliation functions to help set up modelling
environments, such as the formulation of multi-objectives and

setting proper uptake rates of external metabolites for different
cultivation conditions. In addition, ORCA includes several func-
tions that compare models between COBRA and Optﬂux, an-
other highly recognized FBA modelling software (Lakshmanan
et al., 2012). This helps to resolve a different tolerance in accept-
ing various SBML formats, as we encountered in the use of
Optﬂux and COBRA.

2.2 Core function 1: optimizeM

This function examines the production potential of a GSM for a
preferable metabolite. The user can specify any desirable intra-
cellular metabolites included in the GSM. This function auto-
mates implementation of three analyses: (i) pareto optimality
analysis, (ii) bivariate robustness analysis and (iii) fraction bene-
fit analysis (Supplementary ﬁle for details of these analyses).

2.3 Core function 2: fatmin

This function iteratively implements our previously published
algorithm Flux variability analysis with target flux minimization
(FATMIN) (Mao and Verwoerd, 2013c). FATMIN is devised to
eliminate futile loops in a metabolic network and characterize all
the alternate optimal solutions or equivalent phenotypic states in
a metabolism. In particular, FATMIN results characterize the
network mechanisms underlying the robustness due to alterna-
tive metabolic pathways. If a series of flux levels for synthesis of
desirable molecules spanning from the lowest (control state) to
highest are used in running FATMIN, the function can scan for
potential metabolic switches in the metabolism. These metabolic
switches represent the transitions between phenotypic behaviours
and can provide indirect information about a system’s tolerance
to different levels of perturbation. The distinct phenotypic be-
haviours also indicates the suitability of the microorganism for
desirable chemical production. Furthermore, the resultant lists of
reactions from FATMIN can be visualized in a context of path-
ways and subnetworks by calling a recently published COBRA
extension Paint4Net (Kostromins and Stalidzans, 2012).

2.4 Core function 3: dFBA

Different from the steady state assumption that numerous prop-
erties are unchanging in time, dynamic FBA can examine time-
dependent properties of a model by coupling a model to the
bioreactor process in order to reveal the dynamic interactions
between the cell and the environment (Mahadevan et al.,
2002). In ORCA, dFBA consists of a suite of functions that
provide a basic dynamic flux balance modelling framework,
combining a steady-state intracellular model of the metabolism
with a list of selected component-linked ODEs and Michaelis—
Menten or Hill function uptake kinetics. In practice, different
simulation conditions demand change or addition of dynamic

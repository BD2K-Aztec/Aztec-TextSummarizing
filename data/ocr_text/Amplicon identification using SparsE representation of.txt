ABSTRACT

Motivation: Pyrosequencing is a cost-effective DNA sequencing tech-
nology that has many applications, including rapid genotyping of a
broad spectrum of bacteria. When molecular typing requires to geno-
type multiple DNA stretches, several pyrosequencing primers could be
used simultaneously but this would create overlapping primer-specific
signals, which are visually uninterpretable. Accordingly, the objective
was to develop a new method for signal processing (AdvlSER-
M-PYRO) to automatically analyze and interpret multiplex pyroseq uen-
cing signals. In parallel, the nucleotide dispensation order was
improved by developing the SENATOR (‘SElecting the Nucleotide
dispensATion Order’) algorithm.

Results: In this proof-of—concept study, quintuplex pyrosequencing was
applied on eight bacterial DNA and targeted genetic alterations under-
lying resistance to ,B-Iactam antibiotics. Using SENATOR-driven dispen-
sation order, allgenetic variants (31 of31 ; 100%) were correctlyidentified
with AdvlSER-M-PYRO. Among nine expected negative results, there
was only one false positive that was tagged with an ‘unsafe’ label.
Availability and implementation: SENATOR and AdvlSER-M-PYRO
are implemented in the AdvlSER-M-PYRO R package (http://sites.
uclouvain.be/md-ctmaﬁndex.php/softwares) and can be used to im-
prove the dispensation order and to analyze multiplex pyrosequencing
signals generated in a broad range of typing applications.

1 INTRODUCTION

Pyrosequencing is a DNA sequencing technology based on pyro-
phosphate release during nucleotide incorporation. The four pos-
sible nucleotides are sequentially dispensed in a pre-determined
order. The ﬁrst chemiluminescent signal produced during nucleo-
tide incorporation is detected in the pyrosequencer and displayed
as a pyrosequencing signal (also known as pyrogramTM).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The number of incorporated nucleotides at each position is com-
puted from the corresponding peak height in the pyrosequencing
signal. It has to be emphasized that the current pyrosequencing
method should not be confused with high-throughput sequencing
platforms, which also use pyrosequencing reactions. This article
is clearly restricted to the analysis of pyrosequencing signals
obtained with the pyrosequencing PyroMark technology com-
mercialized by QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany).

Pyrosequencing has many applications, including rapid geno-
typing of a broad spectrum of bacteria (Ronaghi, 2001; Ronaghi
and Elahi, 2002) and human single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) genotyping (Aquilante et al., 2006; Butoescu et al., 2014;
Koontz et al., 2009; Langaee and Ronaghi, 2005). Despite the
increased use of next-generation sequencing for studying gen-
omic diversity, pyrosequencing as deﬁned here remains a cost-
effective solution for genotyping short DNA stretches within
bacterial genomes. This has previously been demonstrated by
detecting SNPs associated with quinolone resistance and clus-
tered in short DNA sequences known as quinolone resistance-
determining region (Deccache et al., 2011). Considering that
antibiotic resistance mechanisms are often linked to several hot-
spots located a small distance apart in the nucleotide sequence of
a single gene as well as in several distinct genes (Hawkey, 1998),
extended DNA-based identiﬁcation of antibiotic resistance
requires therefore analyzing successively, or at best, in parallel,
resistance determinants spread at different locations.

Anyway, pyrosequencing reactions have to be conducted one
by one, a procedure which substantially increases analytical
expenses and technician workload. The alternative is to use seV-
eral pyrosequencing primers simultaneously (Aquilante et al.,
2006; Pourmand et al., 2002). However, the unavoidable conse-
quence of this solution is that overlapping primer-speciﬁc signals
are created, which are not Visually interpretable. Another com-
plementary issue is the need to select the nucleotide dispensation
order for taking maximum advantage of all nucleotide sequence
differences between the respective genetic targets.

Regarding the ﬁrst issue related to multiplex signal interpret-
ation, it is worth stating that complementary mPSQed and the

SparsE representation of multiplex PYROsequencing

 

MultiPSQ softwares were recently developed to help researchers
designing and analyzing multiplex pyrosequencing assays
(Dabrowski and Nitsche, 2012; Dabrowski et al., 2013). The
mPSQed software is used to deﬁne pyrosequencing primers,
which generate unique uniplex pyrosequencing ﬁngerprints
and prevent the occurrence of competing signals from SNPs at
different locations. The MultiPSQ software enables the analysis
of multiplex pyrogramTM originating from various pyrosequen-
cing primers. MultiPSQ computes the similarity between multi-
plex pyrosequencing raw data and ﬁngerprints resulting from
any combination of theoretical uniplex pyrosequencing signals
generated from a known sequence. The goal is to select the com-
bination leading to the highest similarity. While MultiPSQ was
claimed to suit the analysis of multiplex pyrosequencing signals
generated by an unrestricted number of sequencing primers for
identifying an unlimited number of polymorphisms, the applica-
tion was practically validated on duplex signals (i.e. pyrosequen-
cing reactions performed with two pyrosequencing primers).

In this study, the new SENATOR method was developed to
improve the nucleotide dispensation order to be used all along
the multiplex pyrosequencing experiment. Irrespective of the
location of the pyrosequencing primer, the dispensation order
is a crucial feature for avoiding similarities between uniplex
pyrosequencing signals. The SENATOR function considers all
unique nucleotide sequences (UNS) expected to be found within
each genomic region of interest, hence improving the selection of
a dispensation order that produces uncorrelated uniplex pyrose-
quencing signals. The global multiplex pyrosequencing signal is
then interpreted using a new signal processing method based on a
sparse representation of the pyrosequencing signal. The problem
solved by sparse representation consists in creating a compact
signal representation in terms of a linear combination of signals
in an over-complete dictionary [i.e. a dictionary including a
number of signals (p) that exceeds the dimension of the signal
space (n)].

Sparse representation was recently used to develop AdVISER-
PYRO, a new method dedicated to the analysis of low pyrose-
quencing signal intensities and complex signals from several
target amplicons (Ambroise et al., 2013). While used for rapidly
identifying mycobacterial species-speciﬁc signals after pyrose-
quencing, AdVISER-PYRO showed high prediction perform-
ances. In this article, AdVISER-M-PYRO is used as a modiﬁed
and updated version of original AdVISER-PYRO. AdVISER-
M-PYRO is designed to enable the analysis and interpretation
of multiplex pyrosequencing signals. Considering the steady
increase of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing bacteria
(ESBL) worldwide and the occurrence of large ESBL-related
outbreaks, a speciﬁc, high-throughput and multiplex DNA-
based identiﬁcation methods would have outstanding clinical
relevance. This new analytical application was therefore selected
as a proof-of—concept for SENATOR and AdVISER-M-PYRO.

In this study, AdVISER-M-PYRO was used to interpret pyrose-
quencing signals generated during quintuplex pyrosequencing ex-
periments (i.e. pyrosequencing reactions performed with ﬁve
speciﬁc pyrosequencing primers) to genotype SNPs within
blaTEM and blaSHV beta-lactamase resistance genes [9]. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst time that quintuplex pyrose-
quencing signals are produced and reliably translated in sequences
corresponding to each of their ﬁve respective targets.

2 METHODS

As a proof-of—concept, the new procedure for improving the selection of
a nucleotide dispensation order and the new signal processing method
were both applied to DNA extracted from four conﬁrmed ESBL clinical
bacteria of three different species (i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumo-
niae, Enterobacter cloacae), and four reference strains (ATCC700603,
ATCC35218, DSM22313 and DSM22314), including three antibiotic-re-
sistant and one antibiotic-susceptible strains. The method was used to
generate and analyze quintuplex pyrosequencing signals resulting from
simultaneous pyrosequencing of 11 unique SNPs distributed through
three and two genomic regions of blaTEM and blaSHV beta-lactamase
resistance genes (Cohen Stuart et al., 2010), respectively. A multiplex
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out in 50,11 of a reaction
mixture containing the extracted DNA as template, primers and
Power SYBR ® Green reagents (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk,
The Netherlands). Ampliﬁcation was performed on a 7900HT Fast
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk, The
Netherlands). Pyrosequencing was then carried out with a pyrosequencer
PyroMark Q96 ID Sequencer from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) on PCR
products by using a mixture of the ﬁve pyrosequencing primers.
Dispensed nucleotides produced distinct pyrogramT M peaks, each
peak height being proportional to the number of identical nucleotides
consecutively incorporated.

2.1 SENATOR: SElecting nucleotide dispensATion
ORder

Dispensation of selected nucleotides is carried out all along a pyrosequen-
cing experiment and is absolutely mandatory to produce a pyrosequen-
cing signal. For all uniplex pyrosequencing applications, this order of
dispensation is determined using commercial software. As said above,
this is, however, not applicable when designing multiplex applications.
Consequently, the new SENATOR method was developed for selecting
a suitable nucleotide dispensation order.

In a ﬁrst step, a list was compiled with all UNS expected to be
found within each genomic region of interest (i.e. three well-deﬁned
regions in blaTEM and two in blaSHV genes). Then, a series of dis-
pensation order candidates was randomly generated and each dispen-
sation order was evaluated. Accordingly, all theoretical UNS-based
pyrosequencing signals were generated using an internal R function,
and pairwise correlation coefﬁcients between theoretical pyrosequen-
cing signals were computed to identify the maximum correlation
value. At the end of this analysis, the dispensation order producing
the smallest maximum correlation was selected. Parameters of the
SENATOR function include the length of the dispensation order as
well as the number of dispensation order candidates to be evaluated.
The length of the dispensation order can be chosen by trial and error
but depends on the number of UNSs. When this number increases,
a longer dispensation order is usually required to avoid the occurrence
of perfectly correlated signals between distinct UNSs. If adequately
selected, a longer dispensation order should indeed produce larger dif-
ferences between highly similar UNS signals. On the other hand,
a longer dispensation order increases the turnaround time and cost
of the pyrosequencing reaction. Increasing the number of dispensation
order candidates increases the probability of identifying an optimal
dispensation order but at the expense of longer computational time.
On an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2640M CPU @ 2.80GHz computer, the
computation times for a list of 27 UNS and a dispensation order
including 15 nt were 23 and 46s for 1000 and 2000 candidates, respect-
ively. Considering that SENATOR computation time is low compared
with PCR and pyrosequencing time, it is therefore recommended to
test a sufﬁcient number of candidates.

2.2 AdvISER-M—PYRO

In the ﬁrst step, of the AdvISER-M-PYRO algorithm development,
a standardized learning dictionary was created that included theoret-
ical pyrosequencing signals corresponding to all UNSs expected to be
found within each genomic region of interest. For some UNSs, available
experimental pyrosequencing signals (i.e. a signal obtained after
carrying out uniplex pyrosequencing analysis of a gene of interest)
were used to enrich the dictionary. Each experimental pyrosequencing
signal was standardized by dividing the whole signal (i.e. the
global pattern integrating all successive peak heights) by the ﬁrst
peak height that was representative of the incorporation of a single
nucleotide.

In a second step, the multiplex pyrosequencing signal was
modeled as a sparse representation of the signals from the dictionary.
For the y testing signal of length n, the issue for sparse representa-

tion was to ﬁnd a vector ,8 (13,-, j = 1, . . . , p) minimizing the following
function:
n p
Zoi—Zﬁjxyfﬂnﬁjnl, (1)
i=1 j=1

where xij is i—th element of the j-th signal, ||,8j||1 is the L1 —norm of vector
,8]- and A is a shrinkage parameter. In this study, the L1— penalty was set
at 0.05 because this value delivered high performance in a previous
application of AdvISER-PYRO (Ambroise et al., 2013). In this study,
all penalized regression models were built using the penalized function of
the corresponding R package (Goeman, 2008). Considering that the
signal contribution of each UNS should have a positive value, an add-
itional constraint imposing this prerequisite was implemented through the
‘positive’ parameter of the penalized function. The sum of regression
coefﬁcients corresponding to each UNS was computed and recorded as
the UNS contribution to the signal. The contributions of each genomic
region to the signal were also computed by summing the corresponding
UNS contributions.

While not implemented with the previous AdvISER—PYRO version,
the third step was a key feature of current AdvISER-M-PYRO. The
main reason is related to the hierarchical structure of the UNS list in
case of multiplex application. Considering that all UNSs belong to a
restricted number of genomic regions, it is therefore required to select
a single UNS for each genomic region. This selection was carried out
by iteratively removing pyrosequencing signals from non-contributive
UNSs from the standardized dictionary. This iterative process was

sequentially applied on each genomic target, starting ﬁrst with those
with the highest contributions. At each iteration, a new penalized
regression model was built and the UNS with the lowest contribution
was identiﬁed and removed to obtain a reduced dictionary. This itera-
tive process was stopped when a single UNS was obtained for each
genomic target.

Finally, UNSs with a contribution lower than the ‘Signiﬁcant
Contribution Threshold’ (SCT) parameter were also removed from the
reduced dictionary. The SCT parameter was ﬁxed at 1 to avoid
false-negative results. However, this low SCT value is likely to result in
false-positive value and UNS contribution <2 were therefore tagged with
an ‘unsafe’ label.

The ultimate step was to build a last penalized regression model with
the ﬁnal reduced dictionary. A correlation coefﬁcient (r) was computed
between predicted values of the penalized regression model and peak
heights of the observed multiplex pyrosequencing signal. Considering
that a low correlation coefﬁcient is indicative of a signiﬁcant difference
between the observed multiplex pyrosequencing signal and the selected
combination of uniplex pyrosequencing signals from the dictionary, this
coefﬁcient was used to assess the global conﬁdence of the predicted UNS
combination.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Nucleotide dispensation order selection

A list of all UNS expected to be found for each genomic region
of interest was ﬁrst compiled (Table 1). Because each genomic
region can either be present or absent and because of the number
of possible variants in each genomic region, the number of dis-
tinct genetic proﬁles in each bacteria can be as high as 5250 in
total (i.e. 5*14*3*5*5).

As all pyrosequencing experiments were designed with reverse
primers only, the reverse complement sequence was computed
for each UNS. SENATOR was used to select a suitable dispen-
sation order by integrating the list of all possible UNSs. Various
lengths (between 10 and 20 with incremental steps of 2) of the
dispensation order were tested and candidates (n = 1000) were
generated and compared for each length. A nucleotide dispensa-
tion order (AGTGCGTACGTACA) of 14 nt was ﬁnally selected
as it produced non-correlated uniplex pyrosequencing signals,

Fig. 1. Theoretical pyrosequencing signals obtained with UNS expected to be found in each genomic region of interest. For SHV238, only 4 of the

13 theoretical pyrosequencing signals are shown to preserve readability

while also limiting the length of the dispensation order.
Theoretical pyrosequencing signals generated with the selected
dispensation order showed an average pairwise correlation coef-
ﬁcient of 0.12 (range: —0.54—0.93), avoiding collinearity between
signals contained in the dictionary and used as predictors in the
regression models. Based on the selected dispensation order,
all pyrosequencing signals are therefore deﬁned as the global
pattern integrating l4 successive peak heights generated by the
pyrosequencer (Fig. 1).

3.2 AdvISER-M—PYRO

Five genomic regions of interest within blaTEM and blaSHV
were characterized for eight selected bacteria (Table 2).
Uniplex pyrosequencing signals were generated and were used
to enrich the dictionary, as explained in the Methods section.
Sanger sequencing analysis was used as a gold standard to
ensure correct UNS-signal matching in the reference dictionary.
In this proof-of—concept study, the dictionary included 65 pyro-
sequencing signals (i.e. 27 theoretical and 38 experimental
signals). The dictionary consisted therefore of a matrix with
65 columns (i.e. one column for each signal) and 14 rows

(i.e. one row for each dispensed nucleotide). All signals from
the dictionary were processed the same way through the subse-
quent steps of AdvISER—M-PYRO, irrespective of their theoret-
ical or experimental nature.

Multiplex pyrosequencing signals were then analyzed and
automatically converted into their respective contributing genetic
target, using AdvISER—M-PYRO. As shown in Table 3, a high
global conﬁdence of the predicted UNS combination was ob-
tained for each multiplex pyrosequencing signal (R>O.99), irre-
spective of corresponding signal-to-noise ratio. All genetic
variants (31 of 31; 100%) were identiﬁed with AdVISER-M-
PYRO among which 29 of 31 (93.5%) were tagged with a
‘safe’ label (i.e. with a contribution >2) and 2 of 31 (6.5%)
with an ‘unsafe’ label (i.e. with a contribution <2). All these
identiﬁcations were perfectly concordant (31 of 31; 100%) with
Sanger sequencing and uniplex pyrosequencing results.

Among the nine expected negative results, there was only one
false-positive UNS, which corresponded to strain ATCC700603
and was tagged as ‘unsafe’ label. The contribution of this false-
positive result to the signal was small (1.14). It is of note that
increasing the SCT parameter to a value >1 . 14 (but <1.34) would
lead to a perfect concordance between Sanger Sequencing and

multiplex pyrosequencing but such tuning is likely to result in
overoptimistic results and was therefore not used in the present
proof-of—concept study. While reducing the number of pyrose-
quencing from 40 (uniplex) pyrosequencing reactions down to 11
reactions (i.e. eight quintuplex and three uniplex for conﬁrming
‘unsafe’ tagged results), AdvISER—M-PYRO produced high-
quality results.

3.3 Illustration of AdvISER—M—PYRO

Figure 2 illustrates the results obtained with AdVISER-M-PYRO
when applied on two distinct pyrosequencing signals generated
with resistance genetic determinants from strains DSM22314 and
R021, respectively. When the over-complete dictionary was used,
the pyrosequencing signal generated with former and latter
strains was correctly converted into three (DSM22314, upper
left panel) and ﬁve (R021, upper right panel) corresponding
UNSs. In both cases, the correlation coefﬁcient between pre-
dicted values of the penalized regression model and the 14
values of the pyrosequencing signal was 0.999.

The presence of a new mutation was simulated by removing all
signals corresponding to UNSs TEM238-TGGAGCCGGTG
and TEM238-TGGAGCCGGTA from the dictionary. In both
cases, AdvISER—M-PYRO was prompted to create, from the
library, an irrelevant combination of UNS signals to match the
multiplex pyrosequencing signals (bottom panels of Fig. 2).
Considering the high number of UNSs in each genomic region
characterizing this proof-of—concept study, the irrelevant
combination matched closely the pyrosequencing signal.
Consequently, the correlation coefﬁcient between predicted
values of the penalized regression model and the 14 values of
the pyrosequencing signal remained high (0.994 for DSM22314
and 0.997 for R021). As these conﬁdence values were higher than
those found with some correctly interpreted signals (i.e. 0.991
and 0.996 obtained with correct identiﬁcation of ATCC700603
and MMA55, respectively), the correlation coefﬁcient appeared
to be totally inappropriate to detect such misinterpretation in the
present application.

3.4 Impact of the AdvISER—M—PYRO
enriched dictionary

To assess the impact of having an enriched dictionary, all
multiplex signals were analyzed with a dictionary excluding all

experimental pyrosequencing signals generated by genuine
sample analyses. This reduced dictionary restricted, therefore,
the analysis to a comparison of sample signals with 27 theoretical
pyrosequencing signals. With this limited library, the analysis
produced a high number of uncorrect (15 of 31; 48.4%) and
false-positive identiﬁcations (6 of 9; 66.6%). In addition, all
global conﬁdence indexes were signiﬁcantly reduced (0.848 <R
<0.987).

4 DISCUSSION

Pyrosequencing is a cost-effective DNA sequencing technology
that can be used for genotyping short DNA stretches within
bacterial genomes. When the genotyping application requires
analyzing multiple DNA stretches for diagnostic relevance,
each pyrosequencing reaction must be carried out successively
or in parallel, which increases reagent costs and technician
work load. An alternative would consist in performing multiplex
PCR followed by a multiplex use of pyrosequencing primers but
visual interpretation of the resulting multiplex signals is tedious,
time-consuming and mostly unreliable.

In this study, AdvISER—M-PYRO was, therefore, developed
and used to test the feasibility of analyzing and automatically
interpreting signals resulting from quintuplex pyrosequencing of
SNPs located within blaTEM and blaSHV beta-lactamase resist-
ance genes, all being ﬁrst ampliﬁed by multiplex PCR. The huge
(11 = 5250) number of possible genetic proﬁles characterizing
each bacterial strain made this case study highly challenging.
Nonetheless, it enabled us to demonstrate the feasibility and
strengths of the new analytical approach while also clarifying
its potential limitations.

Dealing with a huge number of potential genetic proﬁles cre-
ates the possibility that any new mutation, being by deﬁnition
not yet included in the original dictionary, produces a multiplex
pyrosequencing signal, which may coincidentally match an irrele-
vant combination of UNS signals already present in the library
(as illustrated in bottom panels of Fig. 2). This would unavoid-
ably lead to misleading interpretation of the pyrogramTM, result-
ing in genetic sequences assigned to wrong resistance
determinants. Moreover, the high correlation coefﬁcient between
the recorded signal and model predictions would prevent the
operator from detecting such misinterpretation, but would also
lead to overlooking this yet unidentiﬁed mutation. Occurrence of

those issues is, however, less probable when the multiplex pyr-
osequencing application targets a limited number of well-deﬁned,
highly stable and reproducible genetic alterations, such as these
found in human multiple SNP genotyping.

In other applications, a regular update of the dictionary is
compulsory for integrating newly discovered UNSs. In the cur-
rent application, the dictionary was therefore updated to reﬂect
exactly the state of the art, as for today. Deﬁning the upper
threshold for the number of various genetic proﬁles minimizing
the risk of misinterpretation would be highly valuable and
extremely useful when designing new multiplex applications.
This is unfortunately hardly achievable, except on a case-
by—case basis, as too many factors inﬂuence directly the quality
of genotyping results, among which the quality of the
pyrogramTM (i.e. the signal-to-noise ratio), the number of gen-
omic regions targeted in the application, the length of the sig-
nals (i.e. the length of the target sequence that determines
the number of dispensed nucleotides), and the pairwise correl-
ation between uniplex pyrosequencing signals referenced in the
dictionary. The same factors also inﬂuence the optimal number
of genomic regions to be considered in the updated dictionary
for ensuring a reliable multiplex identiﬁcation of SNPs.
Including more than ﬁve genomic regions in a multiplex appli-
cation is perfectly feasible but with an increased risk of ‘unsafe’
results. The respective contribution of each genomic region
in sparse representation of the multiplex result decreases when
additional genomic regions are included. Likewise, the latter
would increase the total number of UNSs, hence the probability
of ﬁnding UNSs that are so similar that they cannot reliably
be discriminated from one another, irrespective of the selected
dispensation order.

In addition to its regular update on the basis of new data from
the literature, the dictionary needs also to integrate experimental
uniplex pyrosequencing signals generated by the analysis of
genuine target samples. In the present study, using a dictionary
only based on theoretical signals, decreased signiﬁcantly the per-
formances of AdVISER-M-PYRO. To be able to include experi-
mental pyrosequencing signals appears therefore to be a clear
and signiﬁcant beneﬁt of AdvISER—M-PYRO, compared with
the MultiPSQ software. Moreover, the SCT parameter of
AdVISER-M-PYRO enables to discard less contributing UNS,
hence avoiding false-positive results, which can not be prevented
by MultiPSQ.

In summary, an essential prerequisite of AdVISER-M-PYRO
is to build an over-complete dictionary based on a list of all
UNSs expected to characterize the genotyping application, and
to update it regularly if necessary. When a compiled over-
complete dictionary is available, multiplex pyrosequencing
produces highly reliable results, as shown in the current proof-
of—concept study. Most UNSs were correctly identiﬁed and
tagged with a ‘safe label’, enabling to reduce substantially the
total number of pyrosequencing reactions from 40 to 11. This
novel multiplex pyrosequencing approach, which integrates the
selection of the nucleotide dispensation order with SENATOR
and the signals interpretation with AdVISER-M-PYRO reading
software, enables therefore to lower the global turnaround time
of genotyping and to decrease substantially analytical reagent
costs while providing reliable target-speciﬁc results.

Fig. 2. Four examples of multiplex pyrosequencing signal identiﬁcation with AdvISER—M-PYRO. The pyrosequencing signal is represented by vertical
black lines. The contribution of each atom is represented with gray boxes stacked on top of the other. In both upper panels, an over-complete dictionary
was used and signals were correctly converted into corresponding UNS. In both bottom panels, some signals were intentionally removed from
the dictionary to demonstrate that an incomplete dictionary can lead to signals misinterpretation, hence resulting in misleading translation into non-

corresponding UNS

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The cell nucleus is a highly organized cellular organelle
that contains the genetic material. The study of nuclear architecture
has become an important field of cellular biology. Extracting quantita-
tive data from 3D fluorescence imaging helps understand the func-
tions of different nuclear compartments. However, such approaches
are limited by the requirement for processing and analyzing large sets
of images.

Results: Here, we describe Tools for Analysis of Nuclear Genome
Organization (TANGO), an image analysis tool dedicated to the
study of nuclear architecture. TANGO is a coherent framework allow-
ing biologists to perform the complete analysis process of 3D fluores-
cence images by combining two environments: ImageJ (http://imagej.
nih.gov/ijl) for image processing and quantitative analysis and R
(http://cran.r-project.org) for statistical processing of measurement
results. It includes an intuitive user interface providing the means to
precisely build a segmentation procedure and set-up analyses, with-
out possessing programming skills. TANGO is a versatile tool able to
process large sets of images, allowing quantitative study of nuclear
organization.

Availability: TANGO is composed of two programs: (i) an ImageJ
plug-in and (ii) a package (rtango) for R. They are both free and
open source, available (http://biophysique.mnhn.fr/tango) for Linux,
Microsoft Windows and Macintosh OSX. Distribution is under the
GPL v.2 licence.

1 INTRODUCTION

The nucleus is a heterogeneous and compartmentalized organelle.
The spatial localization of genes and nuclear compartments within
the nucleus affects cellular functions, such as regulation of gene
expression, DNA replication and repair (Austin at al., 2010). The
underlying mechanisms are still a matter of extensive investigation.

Nuclear organization can be studied using several imaging
techniques. For example, immunocytochemistry and ﬂuores-
cence in situ hybridization (FISH) allow the selective ﬂuorescent
labeling of protein-enriched compartments and chromosomal
domains, respectively. Though recent microscopes facilitate the

acquisition of large sets of 3D images, the automatic processing
and analysis of those images remains a difficult task.

Several software programs have already been developed.
CellProfiler (Kamentsky et al., 2011), which is one of the most
popular, only performs 2D analysis. FishFinder (Shirley et al.,
2011) and NEMO (Iannuccelli et al., 2010) perform 3D analysis
but have limited image processing and analysis capabilities.

To overcome these limitations, we have developed Tools for
Analysis of Nuclear Genome Organization (TANGO), an image
analysis framework, which permits biologists to perform the com-
plete analysis process of 3D ﬂuorescence images: image
processing, quantitative analysis and statistical processing. A
potential application is the study of radial position variations of
various structures (such as genes or centromeres) with respect to
the nuclear membrane or to nucleoli, throughout the cell cycle.

2 IMAGE PROCESSING

2.1 Data organization and general workﬂow

The input data of TANGO consists of multichannel Z-stack
images of microscopy ﬁelds, containing one or several nuclei.
Each channel corresponds to a ﬂuorescent marker and can be
associated with a biological compartment of interest (further
termed structure). All image files compatible with Bio-formats
(http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats) (>100 formats) can be
imported to TANGO. The processing workﬂow is composed of
two successive steps (Supplementary Fig. S1): segmentation of
nuclei, followed by segmentation of structures within each nu-
cleus (when needed). This results in an hierarchical organization
of data: fields contain nuclei, which contain structures, which can
contain segmented objects. This pre—defined workﬂow simplifies
the workload: TANGO only requires specification of the number
of channels, then the deﬁnition of associated structures. For per-
formance and usability, all images and parameters are stored in a
MongoDB database, a highly powerful document-oriented
system (http://mongodb.org).

2.2 Segmentation/Processing chains

Segmentation, i.e. detection of nuclei and nuclear structures, is
achieved by applying a processing chain to the associated image.
A processing chain is composed of three steps: pre-processing,
segmentation and post-processing, as detailed in Supplementary
Figure S2. Each step is a combination of one or several process-
ing operations. TANGO contains rapid 3D implementations of
>30 commonly used filters (such as top-hat, Laplacian of

different levels of objects: (a) nuclei, 0)) structures contained in the selected

Gaussian or morphological ﬁlters) and several segmentation
algorithms (such as seeded watershed or hysteresis thresholding)
including those we have developed (listed in Supplementary Table
S1). Moreover, programmers can easily add their own processing
operations as ImageJ plug-ins. By taking advantage of this large
collection, processing chains can be precisely adapted to the var-
iety of structures to be analyzed, including the nucleus itself and
structures composed of spot-like or larger objects. Although one
must have a minimal knowledge in image processing to deﬁne a
processing chain, no programming skills are required: for each
step, users choose speciﬁc plug-ins and adjust their parameters
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Robustness over ﬁeld-to-ﬁeld or cell-
to-cell intensity variations can be increased by using methods to
automatically compute thresholds instead of constant values,
which is essential for automation of segmentation procedures in
a high-throughput context. Once deﬁned, processing chains that
have been validated for a speciﬁc type of structure can be re—used
in different experiments as templates.

2.3 Manual intervention

When automatic processing fails to correctly segment objects, a
manual intervention is possible. Segmented objects can be
merged, split, erased or created with semi-automatic procedures.

3 DATA ANALYSIS
3.1 Data browsing

Figure 1 shows the data browsing tab that allows one to rapidly
access the data (images and measurement results) related to each
object or structure contained in each nuclei. Raw and segmented
images can be visualized as grayscale stacks, overlay stacks or 3D
representations (Supplementary Fig. S3). Nuclei and objects can
be annotated to deﬁne different sub-populations.

3.2 Quantitative image analysis

Quantitative image analysis is the process of computing numer-
ical information describing each structure and the relationships
between them. Voxel—based measurements quantify the staining
pattern of a ﬂuorescence signal within a segmented structure

(e.g. mean intensity inside or outside objects, radial autocorrel-
ation, layer measurements) or the co-localization of two signals.
Segmentation-based measurements provide morphological de-
scriptors of objects (e.g. volume, elongation) or descriptors of
spatial relations between several objects, including overlap,
border-to-border distance between pairs of objects or radial
localization within the nucleus. TANGO includes a large collec-
tion of 3D measurements, some of which are rarely encountered
in image analysis software (listed in Supplementary Table S2),
and programmers can easily add their own plug-ins. Analysis
results are stored in the database and can be exported to for-
matted text ﬁles compatible with statistical processing software.

3.3 Statistical processing with R

A part of TANGO is implemented as an R-package.
Measurement results can be directly imported from the
TANGO database to R as indexed dataframe objects and thus
can be processed using the wide panel of functions provided by
R. When analyzing data, it can be useful to visualize the images
associated to a subset of the studied population. To do so, sub-
populations of nuclei and objects can be deﬁned in R and will be
highlighted in TANGO. This can be accomplished through the
use of interactive plots (Supplementary Fig. S4). Finally, rtango
is compatible with a ﬂow-cytometry r-package (ﬂowcore) that
implements speciﬁc data visualization and analysis tools, thereby
providing a complete solution for image cytometry.

4 CONCLUSION

TANGO is a versatile software, which, owing to a large collec-
tion of 3D processing operations and measurements as well as a
convenient data visualization and analysis system, allows biolo-
gists to obtain quantitative information regarding the organiza-
tion of the nucleus. We have successfully detected and analyzed
various types of FISH (e.g. BAC probes or chromosome terri-
tories) and immunocytochemistry (e.g. centromeres or nucleoli)
signals. TANGO is integrated into Image] and R, both of which
are modular open-source software widely used in the scientiﬁc
community, allowing one to beneﬁt from the rich potential
of the two environments when using TANGO (Supplementary
Fig. S5).

In their paper in Bioinformatics, Yang and Song (2010a) proposed a
Bayesian probit regression model for gene selection. Their model is
an extension of Lee et al. (2000) specially adapted to overcome
a problem of singular matrix which is frequently encountered
under situations with large number of covariates and (relatively)
small number of observations. Yang and Song (2010a) showed
that their method permits simple simulations with ﬂexible initial
parametrization. Besides, their algorithm proved to be efﬁcient
through two well-known datasets. In the case of singularity of the
covariance matrix of the g—prior (Zellner, 1986), the computation of
the posterior distributions proposed by Yang and Song (2010a) has
a technical issue. In this comment, we highlight a speciﬁc formula
that yield intractable computation, in some cases, and we offer a
solution.

Following notations of Yang and Song, the matrix of selected
covariates is denoted by Xy. The matrix X)’,Xy coincides with the
covariance matrix of the g-prior distribution for the coefﬁcient
parameter ,8;,. There are two standard cases in which the matrix
X§Xy is singular, and where conventional approaches do not work:

(1) If the number of observations is lower than the number of
selected variables, n <py.

(2) If the matrix Xy is not of full rank, which is the case if some
variables are linear combinations of others.

In these cases, Yang and Song (2010a) proposed to replace the matrix
(X;Xy)_1 by its Moore—Penrose generalized inverse (X;Xy)+.
They obtained a modiﬁed form of the g-prior, namely the gsg-
prior (see West, 2000). They proposed to use a collapsed Gibbs
sampler (see for instance van Dyk and Park, 2008) by integrating
,6), out from the joint posterior distribution. Details are given in the
supplementary material (Yang and Song, 2010b). In their calculus
for the distribution of ﬂy, the inverse of the following matrix

A = X;{(1,,+h11’)—1+c—11,,}x,,,

is used in their Equation (A 7) given by
_ ﬂ’yAﬂy —2/3’yB _ z’(1,, +h11’)-1z

_ (ﬂy—A_IB)’A(,By—A_IB) Z’(In+h11’)_1Z—B’A_1B (A7)

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

However, A is not invertible if XéXy is singular. An idea should be

to use A+ instead of A‘1 to adapt (A 7). But even using A+, it is
not clear to us that we can recover a Gaussian density for ,6), since
we have

,33,A,3,, — 2,3;3 7s (,3, —A+B)’A(,By —A+B) —B’A+B.

Therefore it seems intractable to express the distribution of ,8),
and to integrate out this parameter.

The method proposed by Yang and Song (2010a) can be clearly
applied when X)’,Xy is invertible and it has demonstrated good
performances. Note that in the invertible case the gsg-prior coincides
with the g-prior [as it is underlined by Yang and Song (2010a)],
and the proposed model can be Viewed as an extension of that of
Lee et al. (2000). To avoid the case where n <py, Yang and Song
suggested the use of small prior values for m, restricting the number
of genes. Another solution is to ﬁx the number of selected covariates,
as in Baragatti (2010). It appears computationally advantageous and
it reduces the effect of the variable selection coefﬁcient c used in
the g-prior. Eventually, concerning the case where the Xy matrix is
not of full rank, it would be of interest to consider an alternative
prior for ﬂy, by combining the approach of Baragatti (2010) with
the concept of ridge regression (Baragatti and Pommeret, 2011).

Conﬂict of Interest: none declared.

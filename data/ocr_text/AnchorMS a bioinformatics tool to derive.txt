ABSTRACT

Summary: Mass spectrometry is being increasingly used in the struc-
tural elucidation of mega-Dalton protein complexes in an approach
termed MS3D, referring to the application of MS to the study of
macromolecular structures. This involves the identification of cross-
linked residues in the constituent proteins of chemically cross-linked
multi-subunit complexes. AnchorMS was developed to simplify MS3D
studies by identifying cross-linked peptides in complex peptide mix-
tures, and to determine the specific residues involved in each cross-
link. When identifying cross-linked peptide pairs (CLPP), AnchorMS
implements a mathematical model to exclude false positives by
using a dynamic score threshold to estimate the number of false-posi-
tive peak matches expected in an MS/MS spectrum. This model was
derived from CLPPs with randomly generated sequences. AnchorMS
does not require specific sample labeling or pre—treatment, and
AnchorMS is especially suited for discriminating between CLPPs
that differ only in the cross-linked residue pairs.

Availability: AnchorMS was coded in Python, and is available as a free
web service at cbio.ufs.ac.za/AnchorMS.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many essential protein complexes are composed of multiple sub-
units, where an understanding of the structural arrangement and
interactions between the constituent subunit proteins is needed for
a mechanistic insight into the function of the complex. However,
large multi-subunit protein complexes are often not amenable to
structural elucidation by traditional methods such as X-ray crys-
tallography or nuclear magnetic resonance. Mass spectrometry
(MS) has been applied to enzymatic digests of chemically cross-
linked protein complexes to identify cross-linked peptides. The
identity of cross-linked peptides and the cross-linked residues in-
dicates possible interaction surfaces. This allowed the determin-
ation of the orientation and contact points of subunits within large
protein complexes, such as the 15—subunit 670-kDa complex of
Pol II with TFIIF (Chen et al., 2010).

This approach is termed ‘MS3D’ and requires specialized soft-
ware for the analysis of the MS and the MS/MS spectra
(Rappsilber, 2011; Stengel et al., 2012). Perhaps the most chal-
lenging aspect of this type of analysis is the correct identiﬁcation
of low-abundance cross-linked peptide pairs (CLPPs) in complex

sample mixtures. A number of software tools have been released
to address this difficulty, but many are orientated toward niche
experimental designs and sample treatments (Mayne and
Patterton, 2011).

Furthermore, some implement sophisticated scoring schemes
and probability models to estimate the rate of false-positive iden-
tiﬁcation. Generally, these are either trained on speciﬁc empirical
datasets (Li et al., 2012; McIlwain et al., 2010; Walzthoeni et al.,
2012), or mathematically derived from theoretical principles of
gas-phase peptide chemistry Oiu and F reitas, 2007; Zhang et al.,
2002). However, if the experimental training dataset is insufﬁ-
ciently diverse, bias may be introduced into the resulting scoring
scheme or probability model.

AnchorMS was developed as an alternative general tool for
identifying CLPPs in MS and MS/MS spectra.

2 MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR FALSE-POSITIVE
MATCHES

The identiﬁcation of CLPPs involves the comparison of observed
spectra (b— and y-series) with spectra predicted for all possible
CLPPs in the sample, which is based on the known sequences of
the proteins in the sample and the cross-linking reagent speciﬁ-
city. F alse-positive peak matches occur when the peak value of
non-identical peptide ions is sufﬁciently similar within a given
tolerance. In complex sample mixtures, a fraction of the peptides
and CLPPs, as well as their fragmentation ions, is likely to have
similar mass to charge ratios (m/z values). We considered how
often such similar m/z values occurred in a typical MS3D experi-
ment, and simulated this in silico.

To avoid the introduction of bias, we used randomly generated
CLPP sequences of varying lengths, assuming a uniform distri-
bution of residues. A range of precursor charges (1+ to 5+) and
tolerance values (in ppm and in Da) was also selected. Fragment
charge states, up to and including the precursor charge, were
considered. A decoy CLPP was generated for each randomly
generated CLPP by shufﬂing the original sequence. This allowed
the comparison of two CLPPs with identical amino acid com-
positions, a condition most likely to produce identical fragment
masses, and thus similar MS/MS spectra. The predicted MS/MS
spectrum for each CLPP and its decoy were compared, and the
relationship between the number of false-positive peak matches
was investigated as a function of precursor size, precursor charge
and the matching tolerance.

Figure 1 shows a mathematical model for the number of false
positives derived from the aggregated simulation data. A clear
dependence was observed between the number of false peak

shown for different precursor ion charges and matching tolerances.

matches and the CLPP length, ion charge and tolerance. The
difference in the number of false-positive matches observed be-
tween absolute and relative tolerance modes was particularly
noticeable. The model is not dependent on residue composition,
and considers the aggregate of the residue compositions that
were sampled.

AnchorMS implemented this calibrated mathematical model
as a dynamic false-positive threshold, which is calculated for
each putative CLPP spectrum assignment. Those that score
below the threshold value are excluded by AnchorMS.

3 IDENTIFYING THE CROSS-LINKED RESIDUES

The identity and position of the cross-linked residues in a CLPP
is clear-cut when there is only one residue that is reactive to the
cross-linking reagent in each of the peptides. Here, the number of
direct MS/MS peak-to-peak matches indicates the best CLPP
identiﬁcation. A similar method is used in the identiﬁcation
of post-translational modiﬁcations (Beausoleil et al., 2006).
However, in the case of multiple reactive residues on each pep-
tide, several cross-linking combinations are possible. AnchorMS
approaches this ambiguity by also considering the number of
unique MS/MS peaks associated with each possible combin-
ation. The cross-linking combination with the largest number
of unique peaks that match the experimental MS/MS spectrum
is selected as the correct match.

4 USING AnchorMS

AnchorMS is implemented as a set of Python scripts with a PHP:
Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) front-end. The source code is
available under a GNU General Public License (GPL-3.0). The
AnchorMS web service is freely accessible at cbio.ufs.ac.za/
AnchorMS.

The AnchorMS web page displays a series of numbered activ-
ities to systematically guide the user through all steps required

for an analysis. The residue sequences of the proteins involved in
the cross-linking experiment must be uploaded as FASTA
format, and the cross-linking reagent and protease used for di-
gestion must be selected. Custom reagents and protease can also
be deﬁned. The MS and MS/MS spectra data ﬁles must be up-
loaded in text formats widely used in proteomics (ms2, mgf,
szML, szata or szL) (Mayne and Patterton, 2011).
The allowed post-translational modiﬁcations and the matching
tolerance values must also be selected. The instrument mass ac-
curacy must be supplied, which is applied to both precursor and
fragment ions, and signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the discriminating
power of AnchorMS. AnchorMS will identify cross-linked pep-
tides based on the MS peak list, and conﬁrm the assignment
using the MS/MS peak lists. The positions of cross-linked resi-
dues are then identiﬁed using the MS/MS peak lists. AnchorMS
reports the identiﬁed CLPPs, as well as the residues that were
cross-linked. The number of matching peaks in the MS /MS spec-
trum, as well as the number of unique matching peaks expected
for a speciﬁc cross-linking conﬁguration, where several are pos-
sible, is also reported. The false-positive match threshold value is
also displayed for each identiﬁed CLPP. Additionally, the max-
imum distance between cross-linked residues is inferred and
displayed. This value may be used for further structure analysis.
When the analysis has been completed, a link to the web page
listing the results is e-mailed to the user. This results page
remains available for a period of time.

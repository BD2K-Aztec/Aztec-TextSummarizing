ABSTRACT

Motivation: The determination of absolute quantities of proteins in
biological samples is necessary for multiple types of scientific inquiry.
While relative quantification has been commonly used in proteomics,
few proteomic datasets measuring absolute protein quantities have
been reported to date. Various technologies have been applied
using different types of input data, e.g. ion intensities or spectral
counts, as well as different absolute normalization strategies.
To date, a user-friendly and transparent software supporting large-
scale absolute protein quantification has been lacking.

Results: We present a bioinformatics tool, termed aLFQ, which
supports the commonly used absolute label-free protein abundance
estimation methods (T opN, iBAQ, APEX, NSAF and SCAMPI) for LC-
MS/MS proteomics data, together with validation algorithms enabling
automated data analysis and error estimation.

Availability and implementation: aLFQ is written in R and freely avail-
able under the GPLv3 from CRAN (http://www.cran.r-project.org).
Instructions and example data are provided in the R-package. The
raw data can be obtained from the PeptideAtlas raw data repository
(PASSOO321 ).

1 INTRODUCTION

A variety of quantitative proteomic methods have been estab-
lished to measure the relative abundance of proteins across sam-
ples. Although relative quantiﬁcation methods are useful to
compare the same proteins between multiple biological samples,
they do not provide the possibility to directly compare the data
with other datasets or compare different proteins within a dataset
with each other and they, by deﬁnition, do not provide absolute
quantitative data. Further, speciﬁc applications, such as differ-
ential equation-based modeling of biological systems or deter-
mination of subunit stoichiometry of protein complexes depend
on absolute protein quantities.

The current gold standard for LC-MS/MS—based absolute
protein quantiﬁcation is the use of stable isotope-labeled stand-
ard (SIS) peptides or proteins in precisely determined concentra-
tions (Brun et al., 2009). These standards are spiked into the
biological sample of interest and the absolute concentration of
the endogenous peptides, and proteins can directly be determined
by calculating the ratio of the measured intensities of the spiked-
in heavy and the endogenous light forms. For economic reasons,
usually only few proteins are quantiﬁed using SIS peptides in a
single study. To overcome this limitation, multiple absolute
label-free methods have been developed in recent years, which
allow the estimation of absolute protein abundances for all or a
signiﬁcant fraction of the identiﬁed proteins (Lu et al., 2007;
Ludwig et al., 2012; Malmstrom et al., 2009; Schwanhausser
et al., 2011; Silva et al., 2006). For a recent discussion and
comparison of the methods, see Ahrne et al., (2013). What
these methods have in common is that they either use the
linear log—log correlation between absolute protein abundance
and experimentally estimated protein intensity or an estimate of
the total protein concentration of the sample. However, they
differ in their protein intensity inference strategy and to date
each requires its own computational framework. Here, we
provide aLFQ, an open-source implementation of algorithms
supporting the estimation of protein quantities by any of the
aforementioned methods, and additionally provide automated
workﬁows for data analysis and error estimation.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

aLFQ was implemented in R as a modular S3 package. An ex-
ample workﬁow for model selection, depicting the individual
functions and sequential arrangement, is shown as diagram in
Figure 1. Detailed information on the various workﬁows and
example datasets are provided in the Supplementary Material
as well as in the R-package itself.

aLFQ consists of three main modules. The import module
provides uniﬁed access to the results of common proteomic
quantiﬁcation tools (see Supplementary Material). In addition,
an input table with the SIS anchor peptides or anchor proteins
and sample-speciﬁc absolute abundances or an estimate of the
total protein concentration is required.

The ProteinInference module enables inference of pro-
tein quantities from precursor intensities, transition intensities or

spectral counts. If the dataset contains targeted proteomics data,
the paired precursor and fragment ion signals, the transitions are
ﬁrst summarized to the precursor level using one of multiple
algorithms. To summarize precursor intensities or spectral
counts to protein intensities, the TopN (Ludwig et al., 2012;
Malmstrom et al., 2009; Silva et al., 2006), iBAQ
(Schwanhausser et al., 2011), APEX (Lu et al., 2007), NSAF
(Zybailov et al., 2006) and SCAMPI (Gerster et al., 2014) meth-
ods are provided, enabling direct comparability of the quantita-
tive results.

The AbsoluteQuantification module provides absolute
protein-abundance estimation from a linear correlation of a set
of predeﬁned anchor proteins or peptides. For this, label-free
anchor protein intensities and independently determined accur-
ate anchor protein concentrations are both log transformed and
a ﬁrst order linear least-squares regression is calculated. The
abundance of all other proteins in the dataset can be estimated

based on this regression. The error of the abundance estimation
arises from biological and technical variation as well from the
protein and peptide intensity estimators. To estimate the error of
the predicted protein concentrations, bootstrapping and Monte
Carlo cross-validation are performed, with minimization of the
mean-fold error (MFE) as objective function.

3 EXAMPLE APPLICATION

An example dataset was produced for this study and is delivered
with the aLFQ R-package. The Universal Proteomic Standard 2
(UPS2, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) consists of 48 pro-
teins spanning a dynamic range of ﬁve orders of magnitude
in bins of eight proteins. The sample was measured in a com-
plex background in shotgun and targeted MS modes (see
Supplementary Material). The example data can be accessed
using the following commands:

library(aLFQ)
data(UPSZMS)

An exemplary integrated workﬂow termed ALF (Fig. l)
(Ludwig et al., 2012) conducting peptide and protein inference
model selection can be executed with the following command:

ALF (UPSZ_SRM)

The workﬁow evaluates the performance for each combin-
ation of TopX transitions and TopN peptides. The resulting
MFEs are depicted in a levelplot, and the model with the
lowest error is selected for estimation of the concentrations of
the target proteins.

4 CONCLUSION

aLFQ enables automated absolute label-free protein abundance
estimation based on input data from various mass spectrometric
measurement modes and analysis software tools. Different quan-
tiﬁcation methods can be applied in a single framework, and
thanks to its implementation in the statistical programming lan-
guage R, it is accessible to a wide audience of biologists and
bioinformaticians. Thus, aLFQ enables easy and fast comparison
and selection of the most suitable quantiﬁcation method and
additionally provides an estimation of the absolute abundance
estimation error.

ABSTRACT

Summary: RDP3 is a new version of the RDP program for
characterizing recombination events in DNA-sequence alignments.
Among other novelties, this version includes four new recombination
analysis methods (3SEQ, VISRD, PHYLRO and LDHAT), new
tests for recombination hot-spots, a range of matrix methods
for visualizing over-all patterns of recombination within datasets
and recombination-aware ancestral sequence reconstruction.
Complementary to a high degree of analysis flow automation,
RDP3 also has a highly interactive and detailed graphical user
interface that enables more focused hands-on cross-checking of
results with a wide variety of newly implemented phylogenetic tree
construction and matrix-based recombination signal visualization
methods. The new RDP3 can accommodate large datasets and
is capable of analyzing alignments ranging in size from 1000x10
kilobase sequences to 20 x 2 megabase sequences within 48 h on a
desktop PC.

Availability: RDP3 is available for free from its web site

RPD3 is a computer program for statistical identiﬁcation and
characterization of historical recombination events. Given a set
of aligned nucleotide sequences, RPD3 will rapidly analyze
these with a range of powerful non-parametric recombination
detection methods (including BOOTSCAN, MAXCHI, CHIMAERA, 3SEQ,
GENECONV, SISCAN, PHYLPRO and VISRD; Boni et al., 2007;
Gibbs et al., 2000; Lemey et al., 2009; Padidam et al., 1999,
Posada and Crandall, 2001; Weiller, 1998). It will provide a
detailed breakdown of recombination breakpoint locations, and
the identities of recombinant and parental sequences. For further
downstream analyses, the program enables users to save edited

sequence alignments with (i) recombinant sequences removed;
(ii) recombinationally derived tracts of sequence removed; or
(iii) recombinant sequences split into their constituent parts.

An important strength of RDP3 that makes it applicable to a
variety of recombination analysis problems is that, unlike many
other recombination detection programs such as SIMPLOT (Lole
et al.,1999), DUAL BROTHERS (Minin et al., 2005), ijMM (Schultz
et al., 2006) or SCUEAL (Kosakovsky et al., 2009), it does not screen
predeﬁned sets of potentially recombinant (or query) sequences
against other predeﬁned sets of non-recombinant (or reference)
sequences. RDP3 instead treats every sequence within an input
alignment as a potential recombinant and systematically screens
large numbers of sequence triplets and/0r quartets to identify sets
of three or four sequences that contain a recombinant and two
sequences resembling its parents. Such an approach means that
RDP3 can simultaneously detect the entire scope of recombination
evident within a dataset (i.e. not just that occurring between the
reference strains or species) enabling its use in the characterization of
complex recombinants such as those derived through recombination
between parental sequences that were themselves recombinant.
The drawback of such a ﬂexible, exploratory framework is that
it can often be difﬁcult to assess the uncertainty associated with
inferred recombination patterns. However, with its wide range
of cross-checking tools, RPD3 is complementary to probabilistic
recombination analysis approaches.

1 NEW FEATURES IN RPD3

Although the graphically intensive and highly interactive RPD3
interface remains superﬁcially unchanged from that of its
predecessor, RPD2 (Martin et al., 2005a, b), it includes simple
point-and-click access to a multitude of powerful new features.
Among these are three new non-parametric recombination detection
methods (3SEQ, VISRD and PHYLPRO; Boni et al., 2007 ; Lemey et al.,
2009; Weiller, 1998), a parametric recombination rate estimation
method (LDHAT; McVean et al., 2004), two new tree construction
methods (Maximum likelihood with PHYML and Bayesian with
MRBAYES; Guindon and Gascual, 2003; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck,
2003), two recombination hotspot-tests (Heath et al., 2006), a test of
recombination induced protein mis-folding (Lefeuvre et al., 2007;

Voigt et al., 2002), recombination-aware methods for reconstructing
ancestral sequences (Arenas and Posada et al., 2010) and a range
of matrix methods for visualizing overall patterns of recombination
within datasets (J akobsen and Easteal, 1996; Lefeuvre et al., 2009;
McVean et al., 2004).

In addition to the new methods implemented in RPD3, another
important improvement over RPD2 is the way in which RPD3
automatically scans alignments for recombination signals and then
infers the minimum numbers of recombination events needed to
account for these signals. RPD3 implements a range of heuristic
recombinant sequence identiﬁcation methods based on the PHYLPRO
(Weiller, 1998), VISRD (Lemey et al., 2009) and subtree—prune
and regraft methods (that identify recombinants sequences as
those which ‘jump’ between the branches of phylogenetic trees
constructed from different fragments of the same sequence
alignment; Beiko and Hamilton, 2006; Heath et al., 2006).
RDP3 also automatically checks detected recombination signals
to determine whether they might not be better accounted for
by sequence misalignment than recombination. Misalignments
introduce homoplasy and are a common cause of false positive
recombination signals. Misalignments are automatically detected in
RPD3 by separately realigning recombinant sequences with each of
their identiﬁed parents (RPD3 uses CLUSTALW to do this; Chenna
et al., 2003) and comparing these pair-wise alignments to those
of the corresponding sequence pairs in the full multiple sequence
alignment. By more accurately identifying recombinant sequences
and discounting recombination signals attributable to sequence
misalignments, RPD3 signiﬁcantly outperforms RDP2 for overall
quantitative assessments of recombination patterns such as those
carried out in the new breakpoint hot-spot and protein folding
disruption tests.

In addition to streamlined tools for managing, testing and
editing information on detected recombination events, RPD3 also
provides a range of new tools for users to cross-check how
accurately the program has identiﬁed (i) groups of recombinants
supposedly sharing traces of the same recombination events;
(ii) recombinant and parental sequences; and (iii) recombination
breakpoint positions. These include heat-plots indicating how
closely the recombination patterns in two recombinants resemble
one another in relation to their supposed parental sequences, color
coded phylogenetic trees for identifying recombinants and parental
sequences and MAXCHI (Maynard Smith, 1992) and LARD (Holmes
et al., 1999) breakpoint matrices for manually identifying breakpoint
positions.

All of the automated recombination detection methods in RPD3
have been rigorously speed optimized and as a result the program is
able to analyze datasets containing up to 40 million nt within 48 h on
a standard 2 GHz processor with 2 GB of RAM. Such large datasets
might, for example, consist of 20 full bacterial genome sequences,
or 1000 full viral genome sequences. With default program settings
datasets containing 100 10 kb long sequences can be analyzed within
10min.

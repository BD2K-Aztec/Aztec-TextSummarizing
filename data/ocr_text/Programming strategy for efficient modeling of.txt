ABSTRACT

Motivation: Heterogeneity is a ubiquitous property of biological sys-
tems. Even in a genetically identical population of a single cell type,
cell-to-cell differences are observed. Although the functional behavior
of a given population is generally robust, the consequences of hetero-
geneity are fairly unpredictable. In heterogeneous populations, syn-
chronization of events becomes a cardinal problem—particularly for
phase coherence in oscillating systems.

Results: The present article presents a novel strategy for construction
of large-scale simulation programs of heterogeneous biological enti-
ties. The strategy is designed to be tractable, to handle heterogeneity
and to handle computational cost issues simultaneously, primarily by
writing a generator of the ‘model to be simulated’. We apply the strat-
egy to model glycolytic oscillations among thousands of yeast cells
coupled through the extracellular medium. The usefulness is illustrated
through (i) benchmarking, showing an almost linear relationship be-
tween model size and run time, and (ii) analysis of the resulting
simulations, showing that contrary to the experimental situation, syn-
chronous oscillations are surprisingly hard to achieve, underpinning
the need for tools to study heterogeneity. Thus, we present an efficient
strategy to model the biological heterogeneity, neglected by ordinary
mean-field models. This tool is well posed to facilitate the elucidation
of the physiologically vital problem of synchronization.

1 INTRODUCTION

Quantitative modeling of the dynamic behavior of living systems
has to be realistic in terms of both biochemistry and biophysics,
and in the description of the structural complexity of living
matter. Compared with equivalent problems in other parts of
natural science, complexity in biological systems is increased be-
cause structural elements with similar function, e. g. the cells in a
tissue, are not completely identical. Although biological function
seems stable and robust, the functional consequences of various
kinds of heterogeneity in cellular systems are rather difficult to

predict, and are fairly unexplored in the literature. This article
describes a new programming strategy aiming to model hetero-
geneous populations of biological entities. From a modeling
perspective, cellular heterogeneity entails a huge increase in the
number of parameters and variables, as (i) diversity among cells
is introduced by allowing kinetic parameters to vary (even for
systems with identical metabolic networks, where kinetic expres-
sions and the species are the same for all cells), and (ii) the chem-
istry in each individual cells is described through unique sets of
corresponding species. Most reactions of a metabolic network
are composite reactions where rates may depend on several elem-
entary rate constants and/or stationary concentrations varying
from cell to cell.

The programming strategy has been designed to produce code
that is computationally effective and at the same time manage-
able for the programmer. This is accomplished by writing a code
generator program, which automatically generates C—l——l— code
from descriptions of cell interactions, the metabolic network
and the kinetic parameters. The strategy handles spatial as well
as temporal models and allows for easy change of scale and of
chemical composition.

The strategy was developed to study the dynamics of oscilla-
tory behavior in a population of heterogeneous cells. Notably,
usual mean-field models, per definition, neglect the problem of
intercellular signaling and synchronization, vital for biological
function, which are at the heart of the presented strategy. The
modeling is illustrated through the classical example of metabolic
oscillations in a stirred suspension of yeast cells first studied by
Chance et al. (1964). In this system, thousands of modeled cells
are coupled by exchange of chemical species through a common
extracellular environment. A model of a single cell embedded in a
cell solution (Hald and Sorensen, 2010) is used as an illustrative
example. The strategy allows for the generation of a large
number of cells, each with distinct properties. The overall com-
partments and reaction network are given in Figure 1. Because
the system easily can be scaled up to a very large system
[> 100.000 ordinary differential equations (ODEs)], we briefly
discuss powerful features to speed up computations.

We illustrate the usefulness of the strategy by analyzing and
comparing the resulting model simulations using various meth-
ods. The yeast system is a particular simple example of an inter-
acting cellular system. Glycolytic oscillations within individual
cells give rise to oscillations in the concentrations of extracellular

species. If extracellular oscillations can synchronize the individ-

ual cells, the whole system will be phase locked in an oscillatory
state. This is precisely what is observed in the experimental

system. Simulating systems of 1000 cells on the basis of two well-
established kinetic models (Hald and Sorensen, 2010; du Preez
et al., 2012a), however, did not produce in-phase oscillations
even with periodic forcing with extracellular acetaldehyde
(ACAX). The results show that realistic kinetic models of a
large population of heterogeneous oscillators are sometimes sur-
prisingly hard to synchronize. Thus, it underpins the need for this
type of modeling to facilitate understanding of the physiologic-
ally vital synchronization process in populations of cellular
oscillators.

2 METHODS

The central part of the method is a generator program, which takes input
(see Fig. 2) in the form of descriptions of kinetic expressions of reactions
within and between the different compartments. In the yeast system, a cell
and the extracellular medium constitute two functional units, where indi-
vidual cells also constitute individual compartments. Note that cells need
not be of the same size nor need they be connected in the same way. The
generator program processes the input before the generation of a simula-
tor program (here in C++ code), which can then be compiled and exe-
cuted. The processing stages reduce the risk of introducing errors during
manual coding, but the main point is it allows for an efficient reduction in
the computational costs of the C++ program owing to an increase in
system enlargement.

In this descriptive example, we use three primary techniques to reduce
computational load:

(a) To solve the system of ODEs, a Krylov iterative method of
CVODE as the linear solver is used. This iteration is an inexact
Newton iteration using the current Jacobian, but this is done
through the matrix-free J x 2 product, where J is the Jacobian
and z is an arbitrary vector.

(b) To reduce the sheer number of ﬂoating-point arithmetic, elimin-
ation of common sub-expressions (CSE) in a list of mathematical
expressions is performed.

(c) As each cell constitutes a single compartment, the code should be
very amenable to parallelization. This is implemented using
OpenMP on a single computer with shared memory.

Introduction of heterogeneity and handling of large-scale systems are
facilitated by the use of object-oriented programming (OOP), which is
well suited to this task (see the Supplementary Information for a brief
description of GOP).

computational costs. Implementation of cost-reducing sub-programs is
facilitated by a model generator, which is written in Python. The
Python library, SymPy, allows for symbolic manipulations of mathemat-
ical expressions. This is used to (i) eliminate common sub-expressions
(CSE) within a set of mathematical expressions and (ii) generate symbolic
expressions of partial derivatives to produce a function that calculates
J x z. The model generator works in three stages:

0 Input: Compartment descriptions, i.e. models, stoichiometry and ini-
tial conditions, are given in turn to the model generator. From this
input, the ODEs and stoichiometric matrix are produced.

0 Process: Here, cost-reducing or information-enhancing manipula-
tions may be performed on the input.

0 Output: As this stage writes out the C++ program, it consists of
somewhat messy production code.

0 The C++ code is organized as follows (Fig. 2):

— Setup phase: Initialize variable vector and system objects to be
collected in a hierarchical data structure (see below). The data
hierarchy is important for introduction of heterogeneity generated
at this stage.

— Initialize solver and output structures.

— Solve system and produce output.

The generated (yet readable) C++ code is compiled and executed.

The Supplementary Information contains the Python code that is used
to implement the strategy and a more technical description of the ﬁles.
Here, a short presentation of the yeast system will be followed by a sec-
tion that describes the strategy in a more conceptual frame.

2.2 Yeast system

The modeling of a population of yeast cells is based on a previously
published mean-ﬁeld model of global synchronous glycolytic oscillations
within a well-stirred population of yeast cells [refer to Hald and Sorensen
(2010) for details]. Experimentally, a global [NADH] oscillation is
observed, indicating that the individual cells must be well synchronized
(Dane et al., 1999, 2001). Thus, this full-scale model describes in detail
the behavior of transient oscillations in a single modeled cell on fermen-
tation of a pulse of glucose and addition of cyanide. This system is
modeled by 22 ODEs (17 reactions and 85 parameters, see
Supplementary Information). By definition, however, a mean ﬁeld
cannot be used to study the synchronization process. To study the
effect of intercellular heterogeneity, many cells have to be simulated
each with distinct properties. This is introduced by varying cytosolic vol-
umes and enzymatic activities, i.e. the Vmax values of all enzymes within
the fermentation network. Km values, etc., can be considered to be con-
stant among monoclonal cells. The parameter values are drawn from a
normal distribution, with mean and standard deviation (SD) as given by
the literature (any detailed knowledge about parameters in individual
cells could also be set explicitly). This is in contrast to stochastic differ-
ential equations (SDEs) where noise is introduced explicitly to the ODEs
of the system. Here, models of thousands of distinct yeast cell oscillators
that couple through a common extracellular medium by linear diffusion
processes (see Fig. l) are used to illustrate the power of the strategy.

2.3 Kinetic expressions and options

Each functional unit, i.e. a yeast cell compartment or the extracellular
compartment, is described by a single generic set of ODE expressions.
Thus, the two functional units of the system can be described succinctly
and similarly through sets of expressions describing reaction kinetics,
stoichiometry and initial conditions. Compartments are coupled through
metabolites that may cross the plasma membrane. A set of placeholder
variables describes these metabolites across every cell in the system.

From the input, the model generator must produce an internal repre-
sentation of (i) internal and external variables (relative to the compart-
ment), (ii) parameters and (iii) ODEs (as some reaction models are used
to in more than one ODEs, individual model expressions are also stored).
The representations must be in SymPy format (docs.sympy.org) to allow
for symbolic manipulations of the data.

Heterogeneous parameters within cells are given along with the cor-
responding SD to the model generator. The model generator simply re-
moves these parameters from the global list and treats them separately on
writing out the C++ model code (see below).

2.4 Model processing stages

The input data may be manipulated in various ways to decrease run
times. Here, we perform the following manipulations: (i) symbolic deriv-
ation of all partial derivatives needed to produce the non-zero content of
the J acobian (using sympy.diff), i.e. afagyj”, where f(y),- is every ODE and y]-
is every variable within f(y),-; and (ii) a search for all common sub-expres-
sions across a list of mathematical expressions (using sympy.cse). CSE on
such expressions may significantly decrease calculation load during run
time.

 

2.5 Generation of C++ code

After input processing, the collected information is provided to a set of
writer modules that writes out the C++ code. Designing the ‘writer
modules’ is very similar to writing a normal simulation program, e. g. con-
necting the model with a solver, and will not be described [see e.g.
Hindmarsh et al. (2005)]. Only features essential to the strategy used in
the C++ code are described below.

2.5.] Initial conditions and variable vector All variables are orga-
nized and initialized in a vector, y (see Fig. 3A): on initializing y, the
values of the n1 intracellular variables are stored in a particular sequence
(each variable is given an ‘enum’ to facilitate readability), and the n1
variables of each cell are stored in a back-to-back manner. The end of
y contains the values of the n X extracellular variables (also in an ‘enum’-
given sequence). This gives a system size of N = nee”, -n1+ nX, where
ncells is the number of cells. Each element is therefore easily accessed by
formulae. To reduce calculation load during run time, the starting vari-
able index of each cell is stored in the data hierarchy (for the ith cell, Ci:
index = c, -n1). Any variable can then be accessed safely and without
copying in C++ code by:

const double & vname = y[index + variable_enum]

This organization is key for (i) optimization of cache coherence, (ii) read-
ability and (iii) fast and safe data retrieval across multiple cells.

Fig. 3. Variable and parameter organization. (A) Variables are stored in a
1D vector, y. Intracellular variables from every cell are stored in a par-
ticular sequence, and cells are stored back to back, ending with the extra-
cellular variables. This provides for access by formulae and optimization
of cache coherence. (B) Parameters are stored in a data hierarchy where
system-wide parameters are kept in a hierarchy object at the top-most
level, constant parameters for the cell or extracellular compartments in
two middle-level objects and the heterogeneous parameter values at the
individual cell objects at the bottom level. The four different colors illus-
trate four different classes

2.6 Data hierarchy

Variable indexes and parameters are also organized to maximize run-time
efﬁciency and readability. Data are stored at relevant levels in a data
hierarchy that resembles the morphological hierarchy and chemical struc-
ture of the system (see Fig. 3B).

The hierarchy is build such that any parameter is only stored once in
the hierarchy but applies to all downstream objects. Thus, a parameter
stored in a higher-level object (e.g. the top-most hierarchy object, here
simply called Hierarchy) applies to all downstream types. In effect,
higher-level objects contain the lower-level objects as nested lists (we do
not use an inheritance hierarchy even though the hCell—type ‘is a’ cCell-
type as well). As cells may be heterogeneous, variability is introduced as
different parameter values in the multiple objects of hCell type that de-
scribe individual cells. This implies that a class is generated for each type
of object in the hierarchy, i.e. four classes describe the yeast system (dif-
ferent shades in Fig. 3B).

(i) The top-most Hierarchy class contains all ‘global’ system param-
eters (none in this example) and single cCell and xComp objects as data
members. (ii) The extracellular xComp class only contains parameters
speciﬁc for the extracellular compartment as members. (iii) The ‘constant’
intracellular cCell class contains constant cell parameters as well as a
vector of cell objects. (iv) Lastly, data members of the ‘heterogeneous’
intracellular hCell class are parameters to be heterogeneous among the
cells as well as the index where the local cell variables are found within the
variable vector, y. Classes with ‘constant’ parameters (all except the hCell
class) are only instantiated once. In contrast, the hCell class is instantiated
ncells times, and each object is given individual values for the parameters
to be heterogeneous among cells.

2.6.] Introduction of heterogeneity In this example, the values of
heterogeneous parameters are drawn from a normal distribution, with
mean and SD given by the user (see above). The heterogeneous para-
meters are then given to the hCell object at the point of instantiation.
Other mathematical distributions or functions may also be used. These
hCell objects are collected in a vector used to instantiate the cCell object.
Thus, object instantiation works from bottom-up as we collect lower-level
objects into higher-level objects of the data hierarchy.

The y = f(y) function is evaluated by traversing the data hierarchy
from top to bottom; data from each object are extracted. At the ODE
level, all relevant data are available to calculate y (see listing 1 in the
Supplementary Information). Note that by accessing parameter values,
variables and indexes as references to const doubles or const ints, copying
of data is eliminated and computational load is reduced.

The J X 2 function, which returns the matrix-free J X 2 product, re-
quires proper indexing and non-zero Jacobian information. The deriv-
ation of symbolic expressions of partial derivatives reduces this task to an
indexing problem, which is expedited by use of the data hierarchy. Again,
traversing the data hierarchy provides relevant variable indexing and
parameter data (Fig. 3) needed to calculate this vector (see Supplemen-
tary Information for technical details).

2.6.2 Parallelization Traversing the data hierarchy in the f(y) and
J X 2 functions makes the code very amenable to parallelization. In this
example, we use OpenMP to handle the distribution of calculations
among processors. See the python code for an example of implementa-
tion. Consult Chapman et al. (2007) regarding details.

2.6.3 Storing large datasets The HDF5 ﬁle format was used to store
large datasets fast and efﬁciently in a binary format. Moreover, HDF5
offers a number of third-party bindings, including python, Matlab, IDL,
etc. See python code for an example of implementation, and refer to the
HDF Group (2011) for further information.

2.7 Measuring synchronization

Synchronization between the heterogeneous cells was monitored by prob-
ing the long-time distribution of phases, <1). The instantaneous phase is
derived as the argument of the Hilbert transform, H, of each individual

[NADH] oscillation, i.e. ¢,(t) = arctan(W). As a measure of

global synchronization at time t, the mean phase distance (mpd) between
oscillators was calculated as in Gil et al. (2009):

3 RESULTS

The main result in this article is the python code that generates
the C++ code to be compiled and run (see Supplementary
Information). To illustrate the power of the proposed program-
ming strategy, we also include some basic run-time ﬁgures.

Our basic test runs included heterogeneity in all Vmax values of
enzymatic reactions (with an SD of 5% relative to the value of
Vmax, see below), as these parameters are heterogeneous among
cells. Simulating an experiment of 30 min, corresponding to con-
sumption of 25 mM dissolved glucose, Figure 4 shows that run-
time scales almost linearly with system size.

3.1 Enhancing run-time performance

Run-time reductions are, of course, dependent on the particular
system and the chosen size. We chose 10 000 cells (16 006 ODEs)
as a benchmark system size to illustrate the power of our three
basic run-time reduction schemes (i) CSE, (ii) Krylov solver and
(iii) parallelization. Table 1 shows bench-marked run times of the

Fig. 5. Heterogeneity desynchronizes oscillations. A total of 1000 cells
were simulated. In (A), the heterogeneity constant k = 0.01 (see text); in
(B and C), k = 0.05; and in (D), k = 0.2. In C, a forcing ﬂow of ACAX
was introduced (see inset). Upper panel: Phase-/period-plots of individuals

the amplitude. Note that the phases are extremely sensitive on heteroge-
neity, whereas the periods remain more constant (except for D). Lower
panel: The averaged [NADH] of all cells (blue curves) clearly show that
global oscillations diminish with increasing heterogeneity. The mean
phase distance (red curve) is high throughout the oscillatory domain.
With a forced ACAX ﬁow (C), global sinusoidal [NADH] oscillations
are present, as a small proportion of cells oscillate in-phase, reﬂected in
oscillations of the otherwise high mean phase distance

normal conﬁguration (All), without any optimizations (None)
and without just a single optimization.

In this case, excluding CSE only increases run time ~ 10%. In
general, this increase will depend on the number of identical
sub-expressions found (in some models, up to a factor of 6 can
be gained). Excluding parallelization with eight cores increases
run time by a factor of ~ 3, and excluding the Krylov-enhanced
solver using a Jacobian information yields a factor of ~ 3.5.
Excluding all optimizations did not decrease performance
proportionally.

3.2 Synchronization

Heterogeneity in the population of yeast cells was simulated by
drawing a parameter value, Pvalue, from a normal distribution,
with an average equal to the Pvalue in the model from Hald and
Serensen (2010) and an SD set to k - Pvalue, where 0 g k g 1. If

lead to a very fast re-entrainment of the simulated [NADH] signal

real-time cytometric data had been available, a more realistic
distribution could have been obtained by the method of
Hasenauer et al. (2011). To keep run times within 20 min, we
choose ncells = 1000. In simulations, we used k = 0.01, 0.05 and
0.2, and observed increasingly low levels of total synchronization
as shown in upper and lower panels of Figure 5A, B and D
[under similar growth conditions as in our experiments,
Johnston et al. (1979) estimated up to 30% differences in cell
size]. The red curves in the lower panels of Figure 5 show that the
mean phase distance between oscillators was high throughout the
oscillatory period, and that the rate of desynchronization corre-
lated with level of heterogeneity. Desynchronization is partly a
consequence of the lack of phase synchronization between indi-
vidual oscillators, causing a lack of oscillations in ACAx, the
main synchronizer of the system (see Fig. 6A). Introducing an
external oscillatory ACAx ﬂow to simulate an oscillatory ACAx
flux from synchronized cells led to forced oscillations in global
[NADH] oscillations as shown in Figure 6 (no and maximal
forcing correspond to Fig. 5B and C, respectively). Even
small-amplitude [ACAx] oscillations produced global [NADH]
oscillations, with a roughly linear amplitude relationship (Fig.
6A—note that for [ACAx] to be non-negative, the amplitude
cannot increase much further). Global [NADH] oscillations
correlate with a narrowing phase distribution (Fig. 5C and 6).
This clearly shows that a heterogeneous population can remain
fairly unsynchronized in terms of its phase distribution but still
display global oscillations when most of phase angles cluster
around the natural global frequency.

As global oscillations are observed experimentally, despite the
high degree of heterogeneity, [ACAx] must indeed oscillate
(Richard et al., 1996; Hald and Serensen, 2010). Usually, a
phase-resetting, i.e. a synchronizing, perturbation by cyanide
acting on ACAx is required to achieve global oscillations besides
the addition of glucose. A phase-resetting signal was modeled at t
= 5 min by forcing [ACAx] for a single period. This, however, did
not synchronize the cells (data not shown), corroborating the
fact that the intrinsic oscillators of the model mostly are too
insensitive to ACAx. Moreover, a 1800 phase shift in the forcing
ﬂow of ACAx led to an instant quench of oscillations followed
by swift re—entrainment to the forcing (Fig. 6B). Overall, this
indicates that the oscillator sensitivity to ACAx is too low, and
that the forcing mostly entrains the otherwise non-oscillatory or
low-amplitude cells to display coherent global oscillations.

strategy was applied to a recently developed open-ﬂow model (du Preez
et al., 2012a). (A) Global [NADH] signal in a system of 1000 heteroge-

This problem is not particular to the metabolic model chosen
here. We also applied the modeling strategy to a recent open-
ﬂow model (du Preez et al., 2012a, b), which also failed to show
global synchronous oscillations on introduction of heterogeneity
ofk = 0.05 (see Fig. 7).

It is beyond the scope of this article to elucidate the current
lack of our understanding of synchronization in yeast, but the
prospects of the proposed modeling strategy for studying the
effects of heterogeneity should be evident.

4 DISCUSSION

This article presents a ﬂexible and efﬁcient strategy for generat-
ing large-scale models of heterogeneous biological systems from
existing single-cell models. A heterogeneous yeast population
model was implemented as an example of the concept. The pos-
sibility of introducing various forms of heterogeneity at any
structural level facilitates numerical studies of the question
posed in the introduction: How does biochemical and morpho-
logical diversity affect the overall functions and synchronization
of a biological system?

The implemented model generator of heterogeneous cell popu-
lation models was used to study the synchronization processes
using previously established models of (i) transient mean-ﬁeld
oscillations in a stirred suspension of yeast cells (Hald and
Serensen, 2010) and (ii) a recent open-ﬂow model of the yeast
system (du Preez et al., 2012a). This demonstrates the relative
ease of switching between models on creation of a semi-generic
model generator (the C++ code—generating modules are depen-
dent on the particular problem and have to be revised between
very different models). In the former system, we also showed that
the phase of individual cellular oscillations is very sensitive to
heterogeneity, whereas the frequency is more robust. The lack of
in-phase synchronization leads to lack of [ACAx] oscillations, i.e.
the cells do not synchronize in the model as opposed to the
global synchronous signal achieved experimentally. Thus, the
details of the synchronization process within a yeast cell popula-
tion are clearly not quantitatively understood.

Owing to incomplete knowledge of the distribution of model
parameters for the actual yeast cells, we use a random sample of
parameter values to describe the cell heterogeneity. This should

not be confused with treating incomplete knowledge of the
system environment using SDEs for the simulations (Kampen,
1992). Our particular aim is to investigate synchronization
among many heterogeneous oscillators, not the study of
random ﬂuctuations in single oscillator in a heterogeneous
medium, where the SDE approach would have been appropriate
(Bachar et al., 2012). Applying an SDE description of the entire
ensemble of oscillators would increase the computational load
prohibitively. Thus, for the present method, the ODE description
is fully retained, and any detailed knowledge of actual morphol-
ogy and parameter values for the individual cells can be seam-
lessly implemented.

4.1 Modeling concept

The ﬂexibility and efﬁciency of the presented strategy mainly
stem from the introduction of a model generator: a program
that generates code to be compiled instead of writing compilable
code directly. This may, at ﬁrst, seem complicated and time-
consuming, but it does have major advantages, as it provides a
platform for model processing, customization and readability.
Here, the symbolic mathematical library, ‘SymPy’, was used
both to build a matrix-free J X 2 function needed for the
Krylov-based solver and to perform CSE on all lists of mathe-
matical expressions. Moreover, the model generator automati-
cally generates C++ code dependent on selected levels of
heterogeneity or custom-made sub-routines (e.g. CSE). Finally,
the modularity of the model generator increases code readability
and minimizes error introduction, i.e. no system-wide changes
are required when changing subsets of the model.

Three code optimizations were performed (Table l): (i) a
Krylov iterative method as solver, which led to an ~4—times
reduction in run time. The requirement of the J X z sub-routine
requires most work compared with the other optimizations, but
it also had the biggest return. (ii) CSE only led to ~10% reduc-
tion. However, in other systems with more sub-expressions and
reuse, we have observed up to ~6-times reductions in run times
(Hald et al., 2012). CSE is easily implemented, but may also be
the slowest sub-routine of the model generator if many expres-
sions are searched. (iii) Parallelization does not, in itself,
require use of a model generator, but the efﬁciency is
enhanced by the data hierarchy of the strategy that allows
for easy threading in a shared-memory multiprocessor compu-
ter. In the yeast system, parallelization to eight cores led to
~ 3-times reduction in run time. Finally, simulation run times
are reduced by letting the generated model trade RAM for
speed, as all information that can be calculated before the
actual solving of ODEs is stored within the data hierarchy.
The efﬁcacy of this approach compared with usual simulator
setups is harder to quantify, but the hierarchical structure of
our strategy obviously (i) facilitates optimization of cache
coherence, (ii) helps optimization of parallelization schemes,
(iii) allows for easy data access for the y =f(y) and J X z
sub-routines and (iv) improves readability.

The novelty of the proposed strategy is more conceptual
than technical: without resorting to a completely new
domain-speciﬁc language, the existing computational resources
are used in the construction of a model generator. The model-
ing concept is independent of particular implementations or

run-time systems, but different implementations naturally
require a rewrite of the presented code. A natural set of
future extensions would be to generate code for other ODE
integrators and to develop a modeling environment that may
generate model code in different formats that can be imported
by existing simulation environments. The amount of work
required for such extensions depends on the match between
the current and new backends.

4.2 Synchronization of heterogeneous oscillators

Introducing heterogeneity in the activities of intracellular
enzymes (Vmax) of a model consisting of 1000 cells led to desyn-
chronization. Increasing levels of heterogeneity showed that the
phase of oscillations was particularly sensitive on heterogeneity
in Vmax values as compared with the frequency (Fig. 5). The
uniform phase distribution led to a lack of [ACAx] oscillations,
i.e. absence of coupling signal, although most individual cells
showed independent oscillations. This ﬁnding has recently been
demonstrated experimentally using optical tweezers during feed-
ing with a transient glucose pulse (Gustavsson et al., 2012). The
initial conditions of the cells were identical under each simula-
tion, but differences in the initial transient (during ﬁlling of inter-
mediary metabolite pools) might disallow for a synchronization
event. However, introducing a ‘global’ forcing event of [ACAx]
after 5 min, i.e. a phase-resetting signal, did not synchronize cells.
Only by external forcing of [ACAx] during glucose consumption,
global [NADH] oscillations could be observed. These arose from
forcing the subset of oscillators that showed weak or no oscilla-
tions (Fig. 6). This suggests that the glycolytic oscillator sensitiv-
ity of real cells on [ACAx] is larger than in the model, a ﬁnding
consistent with the experimentally reported [ACAx] amplitude of
only 5—8 uM (Dane et al., 2007). We have previously measured
1800 phase-shift responses from a yeast cell suspension forced
with [ACAx] at their natural frequency [Fig. 1 in Dane et al.
(2007)]. These experiments showed a weak amplitude response
and fast re—entrainment to the new phase in ~8 cycles owing to a
combined phase and amplitude response. The simulation of a
1800 phase shift in forced [ACAx] (Fig. 6) showed an even stron-
ger re—entrainment to the forcing frequency because the system
shows no intrinsic [ACAx] oscillations. Thus, low-amplitude and
non-oscillating cells are just driven by the forcing.

As this synchronization problem occurred in two of the most
recent quantitative models of yeast synchronization, the
modeling strategy highlights a fundamental problem in global
synchronization of heterogeneous populations. However, our
simulations do show that a complete in—phase synchronization
is unnecessary to observe oscillations. As long as the phase dis-
tribution is clustered (Fig. 5C), global oscillations might be
observed.

The degree of heterogeneity is currently not known in detail.
However, it is fair to assume that after the exponential growth
phase, cells in all kinds of cell cycle phases are present in the
suspension, leaving the cells very heterogeneous in terms of pro-
tein content and size.

5 CONCLUSION

A novel strategy for construction of temporal (or spatio-tem—
poral) large-scale models of heterogeneous biological entities
has been presented. The strategy was illustrated by modeling a
single cell type in a stirred suspension, but coupled cells of dif-
ferent types could be modeled by the same principle. The strategy
is particularly well suited to study synchronization processes in
heterogeneous cell populations. Large models of coupled cells
tend to be stiff and have off-diagonal couplings in their
Jacobians. However, the present strategy is ﬂexible enough to
allow for system-speciﬁc implementations of user-deﬁned proces-
sing to enhance run-time performance. Simulations of 1000 yeast
cells in two recent models of yeast cell oscillations showed that
the sensitivity of the core glycolytic oscillator on [ACAx] most
likely is too weak in the models to allow for globally synchro-
nized oscillations.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Fine-mapping experiments from genome-wide asso-
ciation studies (GWAS) are underway for many complex diseases.
These are likely to identify a number of putative causal variants,
which cannot be separated further in terms of strength of genetic
association due to linkage disequilibrium. The challenge will be
selecting which variant to prioritize for subsequent expensive
functional studies. A wealth of functional information generated from
wet lab experiments now exists but cannot be easily interrogated
by the user. Here, we describe a program designed to quickly
assimilate this data called ASSIMILATOR and validate the method
by interrogating two regions to show its effectiveness.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome—wide association studies (GWAS) have been enormously
successful in identifying regions associated with a variety of
complex traits and diseases. Fine—mapping studies are underway
for many of these disorders and are likely to identify a number of
putative causal variants. The challenge then will be to prioritize
which variants to select for the expensive functional studies
required to fully translate how these variants affect risk. In many
cases, it is expected that the likely causal variants will be single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers that are in complete
linkage disequilibrium and which cannot be prioritized further based
on genetic evidence alone. SNPs within genes which affect the
resulting protein or lie in a regulatory region would be obvious
candidates for functional studies but, in many complex diseases,
the causal SNPs identiﬁed to date map to intergenic, non—coding
regions and it is more challenging to prioritize these based on likely
function (Barton et al., 2008; Thomson et al., 2007; Wellcome Trust
Case Control Consortium, 2007).

There is now a wealth of information available from the
ENCyclopaedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) international
consortium (Birney et al., 2007; ENCODE Project Consortium
2004) hosted by the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC)
through their Genome Browser (Kent et al., 2002). These
data have been generated from wet lab experiments including

Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (ChIP—Seq), DNase
hypersensitivity and histone modiﬁcation studies, and thus may
provide better evidence of putative function compared with
predictive algorithms used previously to infer function at a locus. An
enormous amount of data is available including studies in different
cell lines and different cell compartments, but currently these sites
cannot be easily interrogated by the user simultaneously. Other
potential resources for prioritizing SNPs for functional studies are
now becoming more widely available and include eQTL studies
and programs which predict likely effects of non—synonymous
polymorphisms. Here, we describe a program designed to quickly
assimilate all available data for SNPs or locations entered by
the user, called ASSIMILATOR. Importantly, the ability to enter
SNPs using base pair position will allow the interrogation of novel
variants identiﬁed, for example, by the 1000 Genomes project
(http://www.lOOOgenomes.org) even if an rs number has not yet
been assigned. We also validate the method by interrogating SNPs
in two regions: one associated with colorectal cancer (Pomerantz
et al., 2009) and one with type II diabetes (T2D) (Gaulton et al.,
2010). We show that, based on the information drawn together
by ASSIMILATOR, we would have prioritized the subsequently
conﬁrmed causal SNPs for functional investigation from both
previous studies.

2 METHODS

Written in Perl, ASSIMILATOR retrieves, queries and processes information
for the desired SNPs from the UCSC Genome Browser’s public MySQL
database and displays this in a simpliﬁed, user—friendly manner. All
available ENCODE tracks are queried in addition to predeﬁned tracks,
such as mRNAs, ESTs and CpG islands. In addition, eQTL data hosted by
the Pritchard laboratories (http://eqtl.uchicago.edu), PolyPhen2 functional
annotation (Adzhubei et al., 2010) and SNP location relative to the gene are
displayed. Multiple systems have been designed to improve the efﬁciency
of data retrieval such as an XML—based track database, which minimizes the
number of database queries and multi—threading support to query multiple
SNPs simultaneously, reducing processing time with minimal reduction in
individual performance.

The output can be viewed in a standard web browser and allows the user to
quickly identify SNPs, which could be functionally important. To add extra
functionality, the ability to view selected SNPs in NCBIs dbSNP (Sherry
et al., 2001) and in the UCSC Genome Browser has been incorporated into
the output. To efﬁciently display features for a SNP in the UCSC Genome
Browser, only tracks that contain features in the SNP region are displayed.
The user interface has been designed to allow further mining of the output
(Fig. l) to display information from the multiple cell types and links to
external data. This includes the ability to view the detailed experimental data
thereby allowing users to assess the biological relevance of the results in the

Fig. 1. Examples of ASSIMILATOR output showing results for (a) Pomerantz et al. with the causal SNP highlighted and (b) Gaulton et al. showing the
evidence that the SNP is in a region of open chromatin. In addition, an example of results for a SNP without an rs number, as might be the case for novel
SNPs identiﬁed via the 1000 Genomes project (http://www.lOOOgenomes.org), is shown.

context of the thresholds and criteria used. ASSIMILATOR automatically
queries any new tracks appearing from the ENCODE project on UCSC and
includes these in the analysis. To further ensure ASSIMILATOR stays up to
date, an option is available, which searches all UCSC database versions for
ENCODE tracks and automatically uses the latest suitable version [currently
March. 2006 (NCBI36/hgl8)]. The ENCODE data release policy places
restrictions on the publication of ENCODE data; therefore, the date at which
the data becomes unrestricted is also displayed to aid the user.

To analyse the data, a hierarchical approach can be employed by the user,
where isolated evidence for conservation across species, evidence of histone
modiﬁcation or mapping to a methylated region might be assigned a low
weighting by the user; conversely, consistent evidence for a region being
active, such as evidence for histone modiﬁcation, DNase—l hypersensitivity
and open chromatin in the same cell line, coupled with evidence that a SNP
lies within a transcription factor binding site (TFBS) would receive a higher
weighting and could help to prioritize that SNP for functional work and may
inform the design of such studies.

3 RESULTS

To verify the usefulness of ASSIMILATOR, we used information
from a published study by Pomerantz et al. who found that
an intergenic SNP, rs6983267, associated with colorectal cancer,
showed functional evidence for interaction with the M YC gene
(Pomerantz et al., 2009). We used the SNP Annotation and Proxy
Search (SNAP) tool (Johnson et al., 2008) to generate a list of
SNPs highly correlated with rs6983267 (r2 >0.8). This generated
a list of 15 SNPs that were subsequently used as the input
to ASSIMILATOR. The results are shown in Figure la clearly
indicating that rs6983267 has the strongest a priori evidence of
function. Not only is it in an active region of the genome, but also it is
one of only two SNPs to lie in a TFBS. Additionally, AS SIMILATOR
correctly identiﬁed the same TFBS as the published data.

Similarly, a recent study by Gaulton et al. (2010) looking at
open chromatin across the genome identiﬁed a SNP associated with
T2D in an open region. As a further proof of concept, supplying
ASSIMILATOR with the same SNP revealed three lines of evidence
showing bioinformatically that the SNP was in a region of open
chromatin (Fig. lb). This selection was achieved quickly and easily
using our programme.

4 CONCLUSIONS

ASSIMILATOR provides a user—friendly interface with which to
collate and assess the wealth of experimental evidence available
for SNPs in order to prioritize efﬁciently for functional studies.
ASSIMILATOR does not try to make assumptions about the
likelihood of a SNP being functional and as such allows the
user to make their own judgements about the candidacy of a
SNP. ASSIMILATOR will also quickly and easily incorporate new
data added to the ENCODE project ensuring that it maintains its
relevance. With the wealth of information emerging from genome
annotation studies, the task of manually mining the thousands
of data points would be daunting. Here, we provide a one—stop
solution that quickly and efﬁciently allows the user to view only
relevant studies for their SNPs of interest and to mine that data with
ease.

We have validated the program using published data and have
shown that it allows the correct prioritization of a SNP subsequently
shown to be the causal variant in a region associated with colorectal
cancer. It thus provides an efﬁcient portal to gather the essential
information on which to base decisions regarding priorities for
functional work. We have made ASSIMILATOR freely available
through our web site as a download and we are also developing a
web—based interface which will be found at the same location.

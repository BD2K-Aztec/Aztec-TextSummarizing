Abstract

Motivation: For most research approaches, genome analyses are dependent on the existence of a
high quality genome reference assembly. However, the local accuracy of an assembly remains dif—
ficult to assess and improve. The gEVAL browser allows the user to interrogate an assembly in any
region of the genome by comparing it to different datasets and evaluating the concordance. These
analyses include: a wide variety of sequence alignments, comparative analyses of multiple gen—
ome assemblies, and consistency with optical and other physical maps. gEVAL highlights allelic
variations, regions of low complexity, abnormal coverage, and potential sequence and assembly
errors, and offers strategies for improvement. Although gEVAL focuses primarily on sequence in—
tegrity, it can also display arbitrary annotation including from Ensembl or TrackHub sources. We
provide gEVAL web sites for many human, mouse, zebrafish and chicken assemblies to support
the Genome Reference Consortium, and gEVAL is also downloadable to enable its use for any or—
ganism and assembly.

1 Introduction

Reference genomes are the foundation for genomic biology. As more
and more de novo sequencing projects are being conducted, and
more draft genomes released, the continued challenge is to create
sufficiently complete and correct assemblies that can be confidently
used as references by the research community. Although it has been
over a decade since it was announced that the Human genome was
completed, this statement referred to the then achievable quality of
sequence resolution. There remained errors and lack of sequence
coverage for important regions, for example many areas encoding
multi-gene families (IHGSC, 2004, Horton et 61]., 2008). Since then,
genome assemblies of varying quality have been produced for many
more species and individuals, often resulting in annotation errors

with negative influence on their research use (Denton et 61]., 2014).
Groups such as the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC, genomer-
eference.org) lead efforts to curate and resolve genome assembly
issues, and maintain the best quality genome references possible for
key research species (Church et 61]., 2011).

Depending on the project, groups that tackle creating a genome
reference may have at their disposal multiple alternative assemblies
together with resources such as clone libraries, collections of short
reads, cDNA sequences, RNAseq data, physical maps, optical maps
or genetic markers. These datasets help in repairing and reorganiz-
ing genomic regions or to create a strategy to infuse new sequence
into a draft assembly. In parallel, research biologists who observe
discrepancies between their data and the genome reference would

pings indicate incorrect orientation of paired ends. (B) Two clone components are used to build this region of the assembly. The green box indicates a reliable
overlap region (red would indicate high variation). (C) Orange indicates an incomplete transcript mapping. (D) Six Single molecule genome maps (orange/red)
can be compared to in silico digest (purple). Red regions indicate discordance. In this case, a ~7.5 kb block variation is shared between three maps and the refer-
ence, whilst three other maps share two fragments. Furthermore, in the ~39 kb digest block, all six maps indicate a size of ~45—47 kb, giving evidence of missing
sequence (~7—8 kb). (E) Comparative analysis between HuRef and YH2 assemblies, reveal this missing sequence (dotted box) as well as the region of variation

benefit from being able to assess evidence supporting the reference
in the region.

Current public genome browsers include many of these types of
datasets in their analysis repertoire, but usually focus on gene anno—
tation (Cunningham et al., 2014, Rosenbloom et al., 2014). They
also represent major assembly builds released every few years and
neither reflect uncertainties in the sequence itself, nor more recent
improvements. Here we introduce the gEVAL Browser project, a
collection of software and frequently updated databases for key spe—
cies that takes a tiling path as the backbone, conducts analyses using
new sources of data and regularly releases the results in a web inter—
face for users to evaluate sequence integrity and create strategies for
sequence management.

2 Overview

The web based gEVAL browser and the underlying back end data—
bases use the Ensembl project as a framework to build on (Birney
et al., 2004). Supporting the GRC, it features the current, previous
and in-progress official reference genomes of human, mouse chicken
and zebrafish while also hosting assemblies of these species not
found in other public genome browsers including those curated by
the Genome in a Bottle Consortium (Zook et al., 2015)
(Supplementary Table S1), and 16 lab and wild derived mouse
strains from the international Mouse Genomes Project (Adams
et al., 2015). Other species present but less frequently updated in—
clude pig (Sus scrofa), rat (Rattus norvegicus) and three helminth
species (Echinococcus multilocularis, Strongyloides ratti,
Schistosoma mansoni) (Supplementary Table S1).

There are chromosomal, regional overview, detailed region and
comparative browser views, in addition to lists of anomalies.
Individual analysis tracks displaying a wide variety of glyphs can be
selected interactively. Common tracks include clone library end se—
quences (Fig. 1A), cDNA alignments (Fig. 1C), genetic markers and
self-alignments within the genome. Additional tracks available for
some assemblies include issues in regions under review by the GRC,
exact clone or sequence component placements and quality of

overlaps between neighbouring assembly components (Fig. 1B). The
glyphs are coloured to indicate discrepancies and offer pop—up
menus that reveal further information and navigational options. All
tracks incorporate navigational links to access adjacent s regions,
allowing the user to ‘walk’ along the genome from one feature/issue
to the next. Custom external user—sourced tracks can also be added
by attaching datasets stored in trackhubs or genome browser sup—
ported file formats (GFF, BED).

Comparative genome analysis is invaluable for revealing con-
served regions between organisms. Uniquely in gEVAL, comparative
analysis focuses on genomic alignments among the different assem—
blies available for the same species (Fig. 1E). This is useful in captur—
ing sequence differences caused by both variation as well as
misassembly, and aids the improvement of one assembly with com—
ponents/guidance from another (Supplementary Figure S1).

Unique to gEVAL, it integrates general annotation with long
range information produced from recent technologies such as single
molecule genome/optical maps (Howe and Wood, 2015 ; Teague
et al., 2010; Supplementary Table 82). These maps prove invaluable
for scaffolding assemblies but are also useful for capturing genome—
wide structural variation (Mak et al., 2015) (Fig. 1D). In addition to
presenting evidence, gEVAL can suggest specific sequences from an
aligned resource to fill reference gaps, or can suggest inversions or
other rearrangements such as expansions or contractions of tandem
repeats.

3 Conclusion

gEVAL is a web—based browser that allows easy detailed evaluation
of genome assemblies through its tools and pre—computed analyses,
and suggestion of fixes. It is a key tool used by the GRC for the im—
provement of the primary vertebrate reference genomes. It is widely
used externally for evaluating detailed regions of these genomes in
different assembly versions, and also by other reference assembly
projects, e.g. the respective international genome consortiums
of pig (Groenen et al., 2012; Warr et al., 2015), chicken (Schmid
et al., 2015) and mouse (Adams et al., 2015). To enable this use the

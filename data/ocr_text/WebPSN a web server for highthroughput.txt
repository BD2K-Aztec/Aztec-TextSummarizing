Abstract

Summary: We developed a mixed Protein Structure Network (PSN) and Elastic Network Model—
Normal Mode Analysis (ENM—NMA)—based strategy (i.e. PSN—ENM) to investigate structural com—
munication in biomacromolecules. The approach starts from a Protein Structure Graph and
searches for all shortest communication pathways between user—specified residues. The graph is
computed on a single preferably high—resolution structure. Information on system’s dynamics is
supplied by ENM—NMA.

The PSN—ENM methodology is made of multiple steps both in the setup and analysis stages, which
may discourage inexperienced users. To facilitate its usage, we implemented WebPSN, a freely
available web server that allows the user to easily setup the calculation, perform post—processing
analyses and both visualize and download numerical and 3D representations of the output. Speed
and accuracy make this server suitable to investigate structural communication, including alloster—
ism, in large sets of bio—macromolecular systems.

Availability and implementation: The WebPSN server is freely available at http://webpsn.hpc.

1 Introduction

Concepts and methods borrowed from graph theory are being in-
creasingly used to study several aspects of structural biology, includ—
ing structural communication that comprises allosterism. The
graph—based approach defined as Protein Structure Network (PSN)
has been implemented in the freely available Wordom software
(Seeber et 61]., 2011). It computes network features (e.g. nodes, hubs,
links, etc.) and shortest communication pathways on ensembles of
structures generally derived from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simu-
lations. With this approach, information on system’s dynamics par—
ticipates both in building the Protein Structure Graph (PSG) and in
searching for the shortest communication pathways.

In a recent development of the method intended for high-
throughput investigations, the PSG is computed on a single high-
resolution structure rather than an MD trajectory and information
on system’s dynamics (i.e. cross—correlation of atomic motions) is
supplied by Elastic Network Model—Normal Mode Analysis (ENM—
NMA) (Raimondi et 61]., 2013) (see Supplementary Methods for
detailed information). The approach, hereafter indicated as PSN—
ENM, is powerful and fast but complex in the setup and analysis
steps. To foster wide usage, the method was therefore implemented
in a web server (WebPSN) that provides the user with a friendly
graphical interface for setting the input and visualizing the output,
while hiding all computation and data management steps.

2 Features of the WebPSN server
2.1 Workflow of the PSN—ENM method

The structural communication between two distal sites is inferred
from the computation of the shortest paths (i.e. chains of pairwise
linked nodes) between pairs of non—linked nodes (by default, the
two extremities must be separated by at least five nodes). Figure 1
shows a workflow of the PSN—ENM approach implemented in the
WebPSN server (see Supplementary Methods for more detailed in-
formation). The first step consists in performing the PSN analysis on
a single high—resolution structure, which means building the PSG.
The latter is searched for the shortest paths between pairs of nodes.
The algorithm first defines all possible communication paths be—
tween selected node pairs and then it filters the results according to
cross—correlation of atomic motions, as derived from ENM—NMA.
Filtering consists in retaining only the shortest path(s) that contains
at least one residue correlated (i.e. with a cross—correlation value
20.6) with either one of the two extremities (i.e. the first and last
amino acids in the path). Meta paths made of the most recurrent
nodes and links in the path pool (i.e. global meta paths) are worth
computing to infer a coarse/global picture of the structural commu—
nication in the considered system (Raimondi et al., 2013). In detail,
meta paths are made of nodes present in 25% of the considered
path pool (i.e. ‘frequent nodes’), and of links satisfying both condi-
tions of being present in 25% of the paths and of connecting ‘fre—
quent nodes’.

Selection of single pathways can be additionally done on the
basis of a number of indices (see below the ‘Output’ section). To fa—
cilitate path analysis, the WebPSN server allows the grouping of
similar paths into clusters. The user can then focus on the structural
communication described by a given cluster, e.g. the most populated
one, by considering the cluster meta path or the cluster center.

2.2 Input

The WebPSN server needs a protein structure in the Protein Data
Bank (PDB) format as an input. The user can either specify the PDB
ID for retrieval from the data bank (http://www.rcsb.org) or upload
a structure of interest from the local computer. The server allows
also to upload more than one structure, which is instrumental
in the parametrization of non—yet parametrized residues (see
Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. S1).

Those residues selected for the computation of PSG and commu—
nication pathways are interactively highlighted on the protein struc—
ture in the Jmol applet (implemented using the javascript version of
Jmol, i.e. JSmol, Supplementary Fig. S1).

Depending on the users’ expertise, a basic or an advanced input
mode can be chosen.

It is possible to follow the whole PSN—ENM procedure, which
leads to the computation of both PSG and communication path—
ways, or compute just the PSG. Thus, the ENM method is activated
only if the ‘PSN—Path’ option is selected (see Supplementary
Methods and Supplementary Fig. S1).

Advanced setting is available as well for PSN, ENM and PSN—
Path for expert users (see Supplementary Methods).

2.3 Output

Results can be both interactively visualized on the web page and
downloaded. Web 3D visualizations (i.e. by the JSmol applet) in-
clude PSG, hub distribution, meta paths and centers of the three
most populated clusters, which can be selected through a predis—
posed box (see Supplementary Methods for an explanation of the
graphical representations).

Fig. 1. Flowchart of the approach. The top image is the 3D representation of a
PSG. Nodes are spheres centered on the Cor-atoms, whose diameter is pro-
portional to the number of links made by the node. The middle image is the
3D representation of a global meta path. Sphere (i.e. node) diameters and link
thickness are, respectively, proportional to node and link frequencies in the
pool of paths. The bottom image shows the 3D representation of a cluster
meta path (left) and of the center of a path cluster. Whereas in the cluster
meta path (left) sphere diameters and link thickness are proportional to node
and link frequencies in the cluster paths, in the cluster center (right), all
spheres and links are equi-dimensional. The 3D protein representations have
been drawn by the PyMOL 0.99rc6 software

An interactive table lists all pathways with a number of associ—
ated indices, such as: (i) path length, (ii) mean square distance ﬂuc—
tuations between all node pairs in a path (p) (MSDFp), which is a
measure of path stiffness (see Supplementary Methods; Raimondi
et al., 2013); (iii) hub content; (iv) fraction of user—defined relevant
amino acid nodes; (v) correlation score, i.e. the ratio between num—
ber of correlated residues and path length (the latter excludes the
two extremities); (vi) average similarity score (according to the
clusterization method) between the path and each path in the clus—
ter; and (vii) number of the cluster the path belongs to (notice that
such number increases with decreasing cluster population). The
table can be sorted by any of these indices, or filtered according to
index cutoff values chosen by the user. Any predicted pathway can
be visualized on the 3D structure by clicking the path itself in the
table.

The output page shows also the distribution of (i) path length;
(ii) MSDFp index; (iii) hub content; (iv) correlation score; (v) node
frequency in paths; and (vi) frequency of four amino acid fragments
in the predicted paths. A table is shown as well listing the number of
nodes, hubs and links in the PSG or in each node cluster as well as
the number of paths, nodes and links in those paths.

Downloads are available both for the 3D representations of the
output (as pymol and VMD scripts) and the numerical data (as csv
and plain text files). The downloadable zip files also contain an out—
put manual explaining the meaning of output files and numerical
data.

2.4 Tutorial: a PDZ2 domain as a case study
The PSN—ENM approach has been validated on a PDZ2 domain in

its free state and in complex with a C—terminal peptide (Raimondi
et al., 2013).

WebPSN for high-throughput investigation of structural communication 781

 

Collectively, predictions by the PSN—ENM method were signifi-
cant and valuable. The statistical significance of such predictions
was verified through a two—tailed Fisher’s exact test, which gave a
P—value of 6.4 X 10—3, and the computation of sensitivity, which re—
sulted equal to 0.786.

The tutorial and almost all default settings of WebPSN are based
on the study on PDZ2.

3 Concluding remarks

The WebPSN server implements the PSN—ENM method for a fast
and user—friendly systematic scanning of the shortest communication
pathways between all residue pairs in a biomolecular system.

High speed and accuracy make the WebPSN server suitable to
high-throughput investigation of the structural communication,

including allosterism, in biomacromolecular systems in different
functional states.

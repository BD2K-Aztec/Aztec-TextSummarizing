ABSTRACT

Summary: Iterative similarity searches with PSI-BLAST position-
specific score matrices (PSSMs) find many more homologs
than single searches, but PSSMs can be contaminated when
homologous alignments are extended into unrelated protein
domains—homologous over-extension (HOE). PSI-Search combines
an optimal Smith—Waterman local alignment sequence search, using
SSEARCH, with the PSI-BLAST profile construction strategy. An
optional sequence boundary-masking procedure, which prevents
alignments from being extended after they are initially included, can
reduce HOE errors in the PSSM profile. Preventing HOE improves
selectivity for both PSI-BLAST and PSI-Search, but PSI-Search has
~4-fold better selectivity than PSI-BLAST and similar sensitivity
at 50% and 60% family coverage. PSI-Search is also produces
2- for 4-fold fewer false-positives than JackHMMER, but is ~5% less
sensitive.

Availability and implementation: PSI-Search is available from
the authors as a standalone implementation written in Perl for
Linux-compatible platforms. It is also available through a web
interface (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/sss/psisearch) and SOAP and REST
Web Services (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices).

1 INTRODUCTION

PSI—BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) uses an iterative strategy to
construct a protein proﬁle, in the form of a position—speciﬁc score
matrix (PSSM), which dramatically improves homology detection
in diverse protein families. Improved versions of PSI—BLAST
have more accurate statistics and more sensitive consensus proﬁles
(Agrawal et al., 2009; Altschul et al., 2005, 2009; Bhadra et al.,
2006; Li et al., 2011; Przybylski and Rost, 2008; Stojmirovic
et al., 2008), but the most common cause of PSI—BLAST errors is
contamination of the PS SM by extension of an homologous domain
into a non—homologous region (homologous over—extension, HOE)
(Gonzalez and Pearson, 2010a). Even searches with a single well—
deﬁned domain do not guarantee uncontaminated proﬁles (Kim
et al., 2010). Some HOE errors can be reduced by ‘proﬁle cleaning’;
HangOut (Kim et al., 2010) focuses on long insertions, but requires
insertion boundaries to be speciﬁed by the user, thus assuming a
priori knowledge of the domain structure of the query protein.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Here we present PSI—Search, an iterated proﬁle search application
for identifying distantly related protein sequences. PSI—Search is
similar to PSI—BLAST, but substitutes a rigorous Smith—Waterman
local alignment (Smith and Waterman, 1981) search strategy
(SSEARCH, Pearson, 1991) to produce optimal local alignment
scores from the proﬁle PSSM. PSI—Search includes an optional
alignment boundary—masking procedure that reduces HOE errors
in the PSSM proﬁle. SCANPS (Walsh et al., 2008) implements a
similar iterative search strategy using Smith—Waterman alignments;
however, it does not currently scale to large protein databases and
does not include boundary masking.

2 METHODS

In PSI—Search, library searches are performed with ssearch, selected hit
sequences from the result are processed with an automated sequence
boundary—masking procedure, and PSSM proﬁles are built using blastpgp.
The PSI—Search iteration workﬂow (Fig. 1a) iterates through search and
alignment/PSSM construction steps:

(1) The initial iteration is a normal ssearch run with a sequence input.

(2) During the second iteration, aligned sequences with statistically
signiﬁcant scores from the previous search are retrieved using
fastacmd; details of the alignment boundaries are stored; sequence
regions outside the boundaries are masked with ‘X’s to remove
potential HOE regions; masked sequences are formatted into BLAST
indexes using formatdb with an additional 10000 random protein
sequences created by makeprotseq (Rice et al., 2000); and a PSSM
checkpoint constructed with a blastpgp search; ﬁnally ssearch is run
with the input sequence, using the generated PSSM, to complete the
second iteration and output alignments.

V

Further iterations repeat Step (2). To avoid HOEs, PSI—Search always
uses the alignment boundary information from the ﬁrst signiﬁcant
alignment in which a library sequence appears. Thus, if the ﬁrst
signiﬁcant alignment with a library sequence aligns residues 25—125
at iteration i, later alignment boundaries at iteration i +1 and beyond
are ignored; only the initially aligned region (25—125) is used to form
the PSSM.

3 RESULTS

Five iterative search strategies—PSI—BLAST (standard and
HOE—reduced), PSI—Search (standard and HOE—reduced) and
J ackHMMER (Eddy, 2011)—were evaluated on the RefProtDom
(Gonzalez and Pearson, 2010b) benchmark queries (500 sampled
domain—embedded sequences) against the RefProtDom benchmark
database using an E—value threshold of 0.001. JackHMMER is
another iterative search tool that uses Hidden Markov Models

Fig. 1. (a) HOE—reduced PSI—Search iteration workﬂow. (b) Fraction of
true—positives versus false—positives found by PSI—BLAST, PSI—BLAST
HOE—reduced, PSI—Search, PSI—Search HOE—reduced, and JackHMMER.
Weighted true—positives and false—positives are calculated as 1 / 500 Zioo tpf
(or ﬁ9f)/t0tdlf where tpf (or fpf) is the number of true positives (or false
positives) at iteration 5 and totalf is the total number of homologs for query
f in the RefProtDom benchmark database. Alignments containing HOEs
with >50% of the alignment outside the homologous boundary are counted
as both true and false positives

(HMMs) (Johnson et al., 2010) rather than a PSSM. The output
alignments from the ﬁfth iteration were classiﬁed into true
positives (TPs) and false positives (FPs, Fig. 1b). At 50% family
coverage, PSI—Search reduces the weighted fraction of errors
from 4.5% (PSI—BLAST) to 2.9% (PSI—Search). Reducing HOE
improves sensitivity even more, to 1.7% for HOE—reduced PSI—
BLAST and 0.5% for HOE—reduced PSI—Search. At 50% coverage,
JackHMMER performs very well using its statistical alignment
envelope, producing only 1% weighted FPs, but its selectivity is
worse than PSI—Search or HOE—reduced PSI—Search at 60% and
75% coverage. Overall, HOE—reduced PSI—Search is 9—fold more
selective than PSI—BLAST. At the end of iteration 5, 78.3, 79.5, 77.3,
78.8 and 82.5% of weighted homologs are found by PSI—BLAST,
PSI—Search, HOE—reduced PSI—BLAST, HOE—reduced PSI—Search

and JackHMMER respectively. Thus, (i) HOE—reduction greatly
improves search selectivity with a small cost in sensitivity in both
PSI—BLAST and PSI—Search; (ii) Both PSI—Search and JackHMMER
are more sensitive and selective than PSI—BLAST; (iii) HOE—
reduced PSI—Search is more selective, but slightly less sensitive,
than JackHMMER. JackHMMER is the most sensitive tool, but
HOE—reduced PSI—Search is the most selective iterative tool.

Abstract

Summary: The use of sodium bisulfite (BS) treatment followed by hybridization to an Illumina
lnfinium BeadChip (HumanMethylation450 and MethylationEPlC) is a common method for inter—
rogating 5—methylcytosine (5mC) at single nucleotide resolution. However, standard treatment of
DNA with BS does not allow disambiguation of 5mC from an additional cytosine modification, 5—
hydroxymethylcytosine (5th). Recently, it has been demonstrated that paired BS and oxidative
bisulfite (oxBS) treatment on the same sample followed by hybridization to an lnfinium microarray
permits the differentiation of 5th from 5mC. Nevertheless, estimation of 5th and 5mC from
tandem—treated arrays has been shown to produce irregular estimates of cytosine modifications.

Results: We present a novel method using maximum likelihood estimation to accurately estimate
the parameters of unmethylated cytosine (5C), 5mC and 5th from lnfinium microarray data given

the signal intensities from the oxBS and BS replicates.

Availability and Implementation: OxyBS is an R package available on CRAN.

1 Introduction

5 —methylcytosine (5 mC) is an essential epigenetic mark that controls
gene expression or gene expression potential (Jones, 2012). 5mC is
the most widely studied epigenetic mark, and assays are available
for mapping 5mC genome—wide at a single base resolution (Bock,
2012). Although whole—genome bisulfite sequencing offers a com—
plete characterization of the epigenome, DNA methylation micro-
array after bisulfite (BS) treatment has been the most commonly
used genome—wide application (Bock, 2012). Additional modifica-
tions to cytosine that modulate normal gene function have been
implicated in disease development (Tahiliani et 61]., 2009). Indeed,
the ten—eleven translocation family of proteins has been shown to
function as enzymes capable of altering the methylation status of

DNA by oxidizing 5mC to 5—hydroxymethylcytosine (5th).
Emerging evidence has suggested that 5th may act both as a
transient intermediate in the process of 5mC demethylation and a
functional epigenetic mark that regulates transcription (Bachman
et 61]., 2014; Vasanthakumar and Godley, 2015).

Treatment of DNA with BS alone is unable to disambiguate
5th from 5mC. A growing appreciation for the role of 5th in
biological processes and disease prompted the addition of an oxida—
tion step prior to BS treatment (oxBS) that selectively oxidizes
5th to resolve ‘true’ 5mC levels. Paired BS and oxBS treatment on
the same samples followed by hybridization to the Illumina 450K
array now permits the differentiation of 5th from 5mC (Field
et 61]., 2015; Stewart et 61]., 2015). However, na'ive estimation of
5th via the difference in values between oxBS and BS signals

results in some estimates with negative values and summed cytosine
modification triplet estimates [unmodified cytosine (5C), 5mC and
5th] that exceed a value of 1.0. In the context of cytosine modifi—
cations, negative values of 5th and triplet sums exceeding 1.0 do
not represent valid biological observations and these inconsistencies
may represent artifacts of random assay noise.

2 Materials and methods

Here, we present an R package entitled OxyBS (oxidative bisulfite and
bisulfite) that provides utilities for processing paired BS and oxBS
Illumina Infinium array data and provides accurate estimations of cyto—
sine modifications. Furthermore, there are several helper functions
available that process data into BS—methylated, BS—unmethylated,
oxBS—methylated and oxBS—unmethylated signals. Normalization and
background correction of raw signals from each BS and oxBS con—
verted sample is achieved using the FunNorm procedure available in
the R/Bioconductor package minfi (version 1.14.0) (Aryee et al., 2014).
Our software applies a novel technique for estimating unmethylated
proportions (5C), 5mC and 5th. Brieﬂy, each cytosine (i.e. CpG)
corresponded to a data vector (S 35, R 35, 50x35, RoxBS), with Rk rep-
resenting total signal (unmethylated —l— methylated) and S k representing
Methylated signal (13 E{BS, OxBS}); we used maximum likelihood to
fit the data—generating model.

estimating parameters n1 (unmethylated proportion), n2 (5mC pro—
portion) and n3 (5th proportion). Note that this method explicitly
disallows negative proportions although we did observe numerically
zero values of 5th (n3 < 10—16).

The software is amendable to parallelization and is recommended
for users as implementation of OxyBS for large sample sizes can be
computationally intensive. The output is a user—friendly array con—
taining estimates of 5C, 5mC and 5th for each CpG on the array.
A guide to use of OxyBS is available: https://github.com/
Christensen—Lab—Dartmouth/OxyBS.

A similar method has been developed to simultaneously estimate
5th, 5mC from BS—seq, oxBS—seq and TAB—seq experiments (Qu
et al., 2013). Key features of our OxyBS software are its implementation
in R and its compatibility with the popular Illumina Infinium arrays.

3 Results

To compare the performance of our proposed OxyBS method versus
a naive calculation, we analyzed sample data from the OxyBS R pack—
age, paired BS—oxBS data from GSE73895 and data simulated for
‘true’ cytosine modification triplets (5 C, 5mC and 5th) based on a
Dirichlet distribution fit to the data in GSE73895. First, we used the
sample data provided in the OxyBS CRAN package (30 Cst X 30

samples) and estimated 5th values using a naive approach
(5th:betaBS—betanBS) and our proposed OxyBS algorithm.
Results clearly demonstrate that the naive method produces negative
values, whereas our proposed method does not (Fig. 1A). Next, we
expanded our analysis to include data from GSE73895, a study of 30
glioblastomas, and examined the percentage of probes that had nega—
tive values of 5th via na'ive calculation. Figure 1B shows that the
percentage of negative 5th values in the naive calculation
approaches 40% across all across Infinium probe type and CpG is—
land strata (top panel), and the bottom panel shows the distribution
of negative 5 th values resulting from the naive approach.

We assessed the difference between the ‘true’ cytosine triplets and
observed values obtained from the naive and proposed OxyBS
approaches using median absolute deviation (MAD). In addition to the
aforementioned na'ive approach (na'ive0, 5th : betaBS —
betanBS), we also considered na'ive approaches that set 5th to
zero when betaBS < betanBS: na'ive1 (betanBS used as a proxy for
5mC) and na'ive2 (betaBS as a proxy for 5mC). All estimations of
simulated data (described in Supplemental information) were stratified
by Infinium probe type and CpG island status (5000 values for each
strata). MAD was then calculated as the median of the sum of the ab—
solute deviations across 5 C, 5mC and 5th. Using the 5000 simulated
values for each strata, our proposed OxyBS method had the best per—
formance (MAD is minimized across all strata, Supplemental Figure
51). Notably, the results are comparable when betaBS < betanBS and
the betanBS data is ignored as in na'1've1 and na'ive2 (Supplemental
Figure 51). Qualitatively identical results were obtained for root—mean—
squared—error (RMSE, data not shown).

Estimations of negative values from paired BS and oxBS arrays
likely reﬂect values of zero for 5th and are technical artifacts. Here
we demonstrate that operationalizing the negative 5 th values from
a naive calculation in a usable manner results in more error than using
the OxyBS method, which enforces appropriate constraints on the
data. The OxyBS tool can readily be applied to both the Illumina
450K and MethylationEPIC arrays as well as sequencing data with

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The detection of genomic regions unusually rich in a given
pattern is an important undertaking in the analysis of next-generation
sequencing data. Recent studies of chromosomal translocations in
activated B lymphocytes have identified regions that are frequently
translocated to c-myc oncogene. A quantitative method for the iden-
tification of translocation hotspots was crucial to this study. Here we
improve this analysis by using a simple probabilistic model and the
framework provided by scan statistics to define the number and loca-
tion of translocation breakpoint hotspots. A key feature of our method
is that it provides a global chromosome-wide nominal control level to
clustering, as opposed to previous methods based on local criteria.
While being motivated by a specific application, the detection of un-
usual clusters is a widespread problem in bioinformatics. We expect
our method to be useful in the analysis of data from other experimental
approaches such as of ChlP-seq and 4C—seq.

Results: The analysis of translocations from B lymphocytes with the
method described here reveals the presence of longer hotspots when
compared with those defined previously. Further, we show that the
hotspot size changes substantially in the absence of DNA repair pro-
tein 53BP1. When 53BP1 deficiency is combined with overexpression
of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, the hotspot length in-
creases even further. These changes are not detected by previous
methods that use local significance criteria for clustering. Our
method is also able to identify several exclusive translocation hotspots
located in genes of known tumor supressors.

Availability and implementation: The detection of translocation hot-
spots is done with hot_scan, a program implemented in R and Perl.

1 INTRODUCTION

The identiﬁcation of genomic regions that are unusually rich in a
given pattern is a recurring problem in bioinformatics, wide-
spread in the analysis of data generated by deep-sequencing.
An example of this is the detection of regions with an unlikely
high clustering of chromosomal translocation breakpoints
(Hasan et al., 2010; Jankovic et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2011).
Recurrent chromosomal translocations are associated with hem-
atopoietic malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma and
with some sarcomas and carcinomas (Kumar-Sinha et al.,
2008; Kuppers, 2005; Kuppers and Dalla—Favera, 2001;
Nussenzweig and Nussenzweig, 2010; Rabbitts, 2009). There is
growing evidence that translocations are not random. Among
basic determinants of these events are the existence of chromo-
some territories, active transcription and most prominently tar-
geted DNA damage (Chiarle et al., 2011; Hakim et al., 2012;
Klein et al., 2011). DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are ne-
cessary intermediates in chromosome rearrangements, and they
occur in the cell during normal metabolic processes, and can be
induced by genotoxic agents or during physiological DNA re-
combination in lymphocytes. The majority of human lymphomas
are of mature B cell origin, and many of them carry balanced
chromosomal translocations that involve immunogloban genes
(Kuppers, 2005). This susceptibility is most likely dependent on
activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the B lymphocyte-
speciﬁc enzyme that initiates class switch recombination (CSR)
and somatic hypermutation (SHM), two processes necessary for
antibody diversiﬁcation (Ramiro et al., 2006; Revy et al., 2000).
AID initiates SHM and CSR by deaminating cytosines in im-
munoglobulin genes during stalled transcription (Chaudhuri
et al., 2004; Pavri et al., 2010; Storb et al., 2007;). Several
DNA repair pathways process the resulting U:G mismatch to
introduce mutations or produce targeted DSB (Di Noia and
Neuberger, 2007; Stavnezer et al., 2008). Besides being targeted
to immunoglobulin genes, AID targets a large number of non-
immunoglobulin genes (Liu et al., 2008; Pavri et al., 2010;
Yamane et al., 2011). AID-induced DSBs are recognized
by DNA damage response proteins and repaired by non-
homologous end joining, a process that can fail and result
in chromosomal translocations (Gostissa et al., 2011;
Nussenzweig and Nussenzweig, 2010; Zhang et al., 2010).

cells revealed many discrete sites throughout the genome that are
targeted by AID. Some of these targets are known translocation
partners identiﬁed in mature B cell lymphomas (Chiarle et al.,
2011; Klein et al., 2011). Mutations in the components of DNA
repair pathways that process AID-induced breaks can lead to
defective CSR, and the most severe defect is documented in
53BP1-deﬁcient B cells. 53BP1 is a DNA repair protein that
regulates DSB processing and is required for genomic stability.
It does so by facilitating distal DSB joining and by protecting
DNA ends from resection (Bothmer et al., 2011; Bunting et al.,
2010; Diﬁlippantonio et al., 2008). The landscape of AID-
induced translocations in 53BP1-deﬁcient B cells is different
from the one found in wild-type cells. Deep sequencing of trans-
location capture libraries from primary 53BP1-deﬁcient B
lymphocytes has shown that the proﬁle of translocation hotspots
changes most likely owing to increased DNA end resection
(Jankovic et al., 2013).

A quantitative method to determine the clustering of trans-
locations was essential for the analysis of chromosomal re-
arrangements in Klein et al. (2011) and Jankovic et al. (2013).
Translocation hotspots were determined by using a technique
similar to that used to deﬁne the coordinates of enriched pro-
tein-binding regions in ChIP-seq experiments. A translocation
cluster is deﬁned by concatenating closely spaced adjacent break-
points, and its signiﬁcance is then determined by using a test
based on the negative binomial distribution. This method as-
sumes that the observed breakpoints are realization of a
Bernoulli process. By taking advantage of this model, here we
consider a different approach for the detection of hotspots based
on the use of scan statistics (Balakrishnan and Koutras, 2001;
Glaz et al., 2001). The scan statistic is well suited for this
task because it provides a genome-wide level to breakpoint
clustering. Using our method, we are able to show that trans-
location hotspots induced by AID in activated B lymphocytes
are longer than those previously identiﬁed by the local method.
Furthermore, our method shows that long hotspots are more
frequent in the absence of 53BP1. The frequency of the long
hotspots is further increased if AID is overexpressed in 53BP1-
deﬁcient B cells. We also discover a set of hotspots exclusively
found by the scan statistic and discuss the potential biological
relevance of our ﬁndings.

2 METHODS

Several methods have been developed to detect clustering of events when
the observations arise from a spatial or temporal point process. This
section describes the application of the scan statistic for the detection
of genomic regions with a particularly high density of translocations.
We also describe explicitly a technique previously used by Klein et al.
(2011) and J ankovic et al. (2013), which attributes a local signiﬁcance
level to a hotspot. A major difference between these methods is that the
scan statistic provides a global chromosome-wide control level to
clustering.

2.1 Scan statistic approximations

We model the occurrence of translocation breakpoints in a chromosome
of length N as realization of an independent and identically distributed
sequence of 0—1 Bernoulli random variables, 51, . . . , SN with 1P{$j = 1} =1)
and 1P{Sj=0}=1—p, 1 51‘ 5 Nfor 0<p< 1. The event {51: 1} occurs if

there is a translocation breakpoint at the j-th base. We refer hereafter to
this model as the global chromosome null hypothesis, H0. A study of the
adequateness of H0 as a description of the datasets considered throughout
is included as Supplementary Material. Let m be a positive integer and
then let Yi=  Sj, 1 5 i5 N— m+ 1, be the running number of
successes in a window of width m. The scan statistic Sm is deﬁned as the
maximum number of successes within any of the N — m + 1 consecutive
windows,
Sm _ 15i$§§1+1{Y1-}'

The signiﬁcance of a cluster of translocation events in a window of
width m can be assessed by the probability of the tail event {Sm 2 y}.
Small probabilities for this event indicate departures for the Bernoulli
model consistent with H0 and could therefore be used to detect hotspots.
A considerable effort has been made to derive the distribution of Sm
under H0. Still in this simple case, its form has remained elusive.
Several approximations and asymptotics for the distribution of the scan
statistic have been derived under the Bernoulli model, particularly when
the number of observed events in N trials, a, are known. Following Naus
(1974) and Glaz et al. (2001), the conditional probability lP’{Sm Z yla}
may be approximated by the function

(0(y)=2Xa:H(i;a,m,N)+(yg-a-1)H(y;a,m,N), (1)

i=y

with H(y; a, m, N) as the hypergeometric distribution,

Hw’mrm=<:”><]::;")/<Zl

Although the expression in (1) already provides a method to quantify
the signiﬁcance of a cluster, the following asymptotic version allows for
an efﬁcient implementation. For sufﬁciently large m and N, the function
in (1) may be approximated by

a N
N2 bi;a,0+ ——a—1 b ;a,0, 2

too)  )(ym )(y) ()
where b(y; a, 0) denotes the Binomial distribution for a trials and success
probability 0 < 0 = m / N < 1. This approximation is ensured by weak con-
vergence of the hypergeometric distribution toward the binomial law for
large populations and becomes accurate in the current application where
N>1 x 106 and m 2 500. Furthermore, for large values of a, namely, for
1000 5 a 5 10000, as is the case for most chromosomes in the datasets
considered here, the summation in (2) may be evaluated as

a
 a, a, 2F1(1,y—a; wil)’

with 2F1 as Gauss hypergeometric function, that is, for |z| <1 and n1 n2,

and (n),- as the ith Pochhammer symbol of n e N, i. e.
(n),-=n(n+1)---(n+i— 1). Note that the second argument of 2F1 is
always negative or zero because y 5 a. The series deﬁning 2F1 is thus
ﬁnite. With this simpliﬁcation, the desired P—value

I3=P{Sm Zyla}

is approximately

N - — ' + '— + —— — .

We observe that (2) is the approximation for the probability
of {Sm 2 y | a} described by Wallenstein and Neff (1987) in the

Translocation hotspots via scan statistics

 

well-known continuous case, namely, when N points are drawn uniformly
from [0, 1), and Sm is the largest number of points to be found in any
subinterval of [0, 1) of length m. Despite the existence of several other
approximations for the probability of {Sm Z yla}, Glaz (1989) observes
that this approximation is precise when the right side of (2) 50.01 and
recommends its use in this regime.

The detection of chromosomal translocation breakpoints via scan stat-
istics has also been considered by several authors in the analysis of leu-
kemia (Berger et al., 2013; Busch et al., 2007; Hasan et al., 2010; Reiter
et al., 2003; Wielmels et al., 2002). These analyses are based on the
method described by Segal and Wiemels (2002), by following a large
deviation approximation for the probability of {Sm 2 y} described in
Loader (1991). Although being derived by using rather different argu-
ments, Naus and Wallenstein (2004) observe that this approximation and
the one in (1) produce similar results.

2.2 Hotspots

The procedure outlined in Section 2.1 provides a signiﬁcance test for the
existence of hotspots, still their actual number and location have to be
determined. Here we describe a method to infer the coordinates of these
events.

A chromosome-wide scan with a window of width m leads to the
consideration of the following sequence of local null hypotheses. For
i=1,...,N—m+1,

HQ, : 5,, . . . , 5,1,”, are i.i.d. Bernoulli(8,)
random variables with 8, =1).

Let y, be the observed number of translocation events in the ith
window, w,. The hypothesis Hg,- is rejected at a prescribed level cry if
13,-=1P’{Sm 2 y, | a} 5 0m, with 13,- computed according to (3). This signiﬁ-
cance criterion conditionally supports the one-sided alternative

Ha,- : 5,, . . . , SH”, are i.i.d. Bernoulli (8,)
random variables with 8, >1)

against the null, Ho,
This procedure partitions the chromosome into two regions:

SB={w, :13,- <OtH,iE [1,N—m+1]} and 28°.

The connected components of SB are prospective hotspot candidates
formed by one or more scanning windows of width m. To actually ac-
count for the bias involved while considering the simultaneous rejection
of the multiple hypotheses involved in a given component of 28, we ad-
justed the corresponding P-values by using the Benjamini—Yekutieli cor-
rection (Benjamini and Yakutieli, 2001). This correction accounts for the
possibility of having a positive dependence structure among the con-
sidered set of hypotheses from overlapping scan windows. A similar con-
trol of the false discovery rate associated with a large number of tests
produced by the scan statistic has previously been considered while scan-
ning for clusters in random ﬁelds by Perone Paciﬁco et al. (2007). Denote
by pf the adjusted P-value for the ith window, so that for the control level
cm, the corrected P-values deﬁne set

SB*={w,:p;-“ 5aH,ie[1,N—m+l]}ng.

The inclusion follows because 13, 5 pf. Depending on the value of m,
each element of 28* may end on a translocation event or not. In the latter
case, the extra bases starting after the last translocation event are deleted.
Let SBT be the remaining connected regions in 28* after trimming, consist-
ing of segments that start and end with a translocation breakpoint event.
Let K be the length of a generic element of SBT , which may be thought as
being obtained while scanning with the scan statistic Se. Following
Section 2.1, the P-value of this segment is then computed by using (3)
and taking 0=£/N.

The method just described proceeds in two steps. The ﬁrst one detects
possible hotspot regions while scanning with Sm for m and 05H ﬁxed. Most

of the resulting events are then shortened in such a way to end at a
breakpoint at a second stage. The resulting segment of ﬁnal length K
may be thought of as being elicited with the scan statistic Se. This seg-
ment is ﬁnally classiﬁed as a hotspot if its P—value is 5aH. Hotspots were
deﬁned by taking 05H = 0.05 and by using several initial window widths.
We denote hereafter by SS", the procedure based on the scan statistic with
window m (in base pairs).

2.3 A local approach to hotspot detection

The probabilistic model for the occurrence of translocations described in
Section 2.1 is implicit in previous work made by Klein et al. (2011) and
J ankovic et al. (2013) while analyzing hostspots. The data consisting of
the genome translocation breakpoints are represented as a Bernoulli pro-
cess with success probability p, estimated as a/N with N as the genome
length and a as the total number of observed translocation events.
Suppose (x,), i=1, ...,a, are the coordinates of the translocations and
let L, for i = 1, ... , a — 1 be the number of bases between x, + 1 and x,+1
inclusive. The random variable L, records therefore the length until the
next translocation starting at x,+ 1, namely, K, =x,+1 — x, — 1. The in-
dependence of the underlying Bernoulli process implies that L, is a geo-
metric random variable with parameter P, i.e. lP’{L, =£,} =(1 — 1))13“1 p,
E, Z 1. Small values for

ML.- s 6,} =1 — (1 —p)£" (4)

may thus be used to detect unusual short distances between successive
translocation events. In this sense, a hotspot can be deﬁned by concate-
nating adjacent segments for which 1P{L, 5 5,} 5 05,, where or, is a given
signiﬁcance level speciﬁed in advance. Suppose that a given sequence
of adjacent segments of widths 5,, 6,4,1, . . . , 5,4,, is identiﬁed as a
hotspot. Let

r r
Lg: E Li+j and  E £i+j,
j=0

j=0
so that the signiﬁcance of this hotspot may be quantiﬁed by the P—value
1‘; = 1P{L’T < K}.

1 — Z

This probability is directly available because L}? is a negative binomial
random variable with parameters r + 1 and a/N, i.e.

_      a>k—r
P = ,- = = — — — -
k=r+l k=r r N N
This method was used by Klein et al. (2011) and J ankovic et al. (2013) to

deﬁne a set of potential hotspots by taking or, =0.01. Any candidate of
this set is then identiﬁed as a hotspot if

(i) it has more than three translocation breakpoints,
(ii) it has at least one read from each of the two sides of the bait,
(iii) at least 10% of the translocations come from each side of the
bait,
(iv) 17 5 1 x 10-9.

Hereafter, we refer to this procedure as the local method and denote it
by NBac. We describe results obtained with NBom and NBOIO5.

2.4 TC—Seq and ChIP libraries

The TC-Seq datasets analyzed here are those described by Klein et al.
(2011) and J ankovic et al. (2013). These are deposited at Sequence Read
Archive (SRA) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under accession num-
bers SRA061477 and SRA039959. These datasets are from four different
translocation libraries: (i) a library from activated B cells infected with
AID-expressing retrovirus (denoted hereafter as AID”), (ii) a library
from AID-deﬁcient B cells (denoted as AIDT/T), (iii) a library from

53BP1-deﬁcient B cells infected with AID retrovirus (denoted as
53BP1_/_AID”) and (iv) a library from 53BP1-deﬁcient AID-deﬁcient
B cells (denoted as 53BP1_/_AID_/_). The list with the translocation
breakpoints passed on to hot_scan in BED format was generated by
mapping onto the reference genome as described in Klein et al. (2011).
The association between translocation hotspots and RNA polymerase
II (PolII) accumulation was examined by using ChIP-seq experiments
deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus database http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/geo under the accession number GSE24178.

2.5 Simulation study

Non-hotspot segments are rather long and characterized by the occa-
sional occurrence of sparsely distributed breakpoint events. Hotspot seg-
ments are much shorter and present a higher breakpoint rate. To simulate
data with these features, we considered a simple two state hidden Markov
model with Bernoulli emission probabilities. Let s1 and s2 be the hidden
states that specify the instances in non-hotspot and hotspot regions, re-
spectively. Conditionally on being at $1 or .92, the observations are con-
sistent with H0 as stated in Section 2.1. The dynamics between .91 and s2 is
governed by the transition probability matrix

11 1-n
P= .
l—v v

Denote by T1 and T 2 the waiting time at $1 and .92, respectively. It is
immediate from the form of the transition matrix that 1P{ T1 > t} = if , for
t Z 1. This implies that 1P{T1=t}= #4 — if = n"1(1 — 1;); hence, T1 is a
geometric random variable with parameter 1 — n, and its expected value
is therefore 1E[T1] = 1/(1 — n). Arguing in the same fashion gives
E[T2]=1/(1 — 1)). Note that E[T1] and E[T2] correspond to the mean
length of a non-hotspot and a hotspot segment, respectively. Let ,81
and ,82 be the probability of observing a breakpoint at any given base,
conditionally on being at .91 or .92. The parameters 1;, v, ,81 and ,82 can be
set to reproduce the breakpoint characteristics observed in our data. Let
11 and 12 be the observed mean length of a non-hotspot and a hotspot
segment, respectively. Taking 11 =E[T1] and 12 =E[T2] leads to

=‘L’1—1

 

‘L’ — 1
and = 2—.
11 12
Let £1 and £2 be the mean number of observed breakpoints in a non-
hotspot and a hotspot segment. Because the number of breakpoints in a
given segment is a Binomial random variable, it follows that

.31=:—: and 1322—-

To asses the performance of the methods described here, we simulated
data resembling the AID” and the 53BP1_/_AID” conditions. The
former represents a relatively simple task and the later a more challenging
one owing to a higher breakpoint frequency in non-hotspot regions. Both
datasets gave similar estimates for 11 and 12, namely, 11 = 6.5 x 106 and
12 = 4154 leading to n = 0.9999998 and v = 0.9997592. For the 53BP1_/_
AID” data, we found that £1 = 692.061 and hence ,81 = 1.065 x 104. For
the AID” data, we found that g, = 176.03055 and thus 13, = 2.708 x 10—5.
For both datasets, we found approximately that £2 = 12.462, which gives
,82 = 0.003. Harder inferential tasks may be considered with these param-
eters by taking ,81 closer to ,82.

2.6 Enrichment analysis

The analysis of genes targeted by AID that are discovered by the pro-
cedures in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 was made by using WebGestalt Wang
et al., 2013). The set of genes targeted by AID was compared with the
mouse genome using the hypergeometric test, followed by correction for
multiple testing using the Benjamini & Hochberg method at a signiﬁcance
level of ToplO. The high-level functional classiﬁcation was based on Gene

Ontology (GO) Slim for all three major GO term categories, namely,
biological process, cellular component and molecular function.

2.7 Software implementation

The genome-wide scan for hotspots according to the method described in
Section 2.2 is implemented by a program we call hot_s can. hot_scan
is written in Perl and R, and depends on the Perl modules
ParallelzzForkManager and Math::GSL::SF, available via CPAN search
(http://search.cpan.org). The former is required for simple parallelization
and the latter to evaluate the hypergeometric function in (3).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Scan statistic and local method: simulated data

A fair amount of hotspots simulated as described in Section 2.5
was partially identiﬁed by hot_scan and the local method.
Differences are due to single breakpoint events that are classiﬁed
as being part of a hotspot or a non-hotspot region. A ﬁner de-
scription about the performance of each method may thus be
obtained by studying the ability of correctly classifying each
breakpoint. To this end, we simulated 100 chromosomes, each
having on average ~20 hotspots according to both conditions in
Section 2.5. The results found with the local method and
hot_scan at various window widths are summarized in
Figure 1. Figures 1A and B present the Receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) curves for the classiﬁcation of breakpoints into
hotspot and non-hotspot regions by varying the nominal control
level from 0.0001 to 0.5. Both methods are speciﬁc, as reﬂected
by the small false-positive rates. This is owing to the fact that
both methods correctly classify almost all non-hotspot break-
points as such. As a consequence, the observed ROC curves
raise rapidly. An analysis of the true-positive rate shows that
the performance of hot_scan may be superior, but this de-
pends on the scanning window width. For the easiest datasets
(Fig. 1A), both procedures show similar true-positive rates. This
is revealed by the open circles that correspond to the ROC values
at the  lCVCl fOI' NB, sszooo, $82500 and 885000. At these
window widths, hot_scan presents a higher rate of true posi-
tives for the hardest datasets (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, win-
dows as small as 500 bp present a much smaller true-positive rate
than the local method for both data conditions. The graphs in
Figures 1C and D show that both techniques are able to control
the type I error rate at the nominal level. Interestingly, ho t_s—
can method presents lower error rates than the local procedure
for all window widths considered, except for the 5000 window at
small control levels (Fig. 1D).

3.2 Scan statistic and local method: real data

The methods described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 are compared by
plotting the distribution of the hotspot lengths identiﬁed in real
data samples. Because the observed hotspot lengths vary across
several orders, we considered the logarithm of their actual length.
The results obtained by analyzing the four datasets described in
Section 2.4 are presented in Figure 2. The analysis done with
SS5000 shows that the hotspot length distribution is roughly
described by two components, one with a mean length of 167 =
Les'lzj base pairs and the other with mean length equal to
4154 = Le8'3321. Supplementary Table S1 presents the means,

variances and the weights of these components. Let 0 < y < 1 and
1 — y be the weight of the short and long hotspots components,
respectively. While the mean position of these components re-
mains almost the same, the relative weight of long to short hot-
spots, ,o= y/ (1 — y), does show signiﬁcant changes. A
comparison of the AID” dataset (Fig. 2D) and the 53BP1_/_
AID” dataset (Fig. 2B) reveals that the relative frequency of long
hotspots is higher in the absence of 53BP1. Indeed, the value for
,0 in the 53BP1‘/‘AID” sample is 1.95, while for the AID”
sample, it is four times smaller, namely, ,o=0.51. We conclude
that 53BP1 decreases the proportion of long hotspots. A similar
effect of 53BP1 deﬁciency is observed in the absence of AID. The
53BP1_/_AID_/_ sample (Fig. 2A) is characterized by ,o= 1.08,
while the AID_/_ sample (Fig. 2C) by ,0 = 0.3. We conclude that
in the absence of 53BP1, longer hotspots are more frequent re-
gardless of AID expression. This effect can be attributed to the
role of 53BP1 in DNA end protection. In the absence of this
protein DNA, end resection is increased, resulting in longer hot-
spots as suggested previously (J ankovic et al., 2013). A compari-
son of the plots that present the AID_/_ and AID” samples
(Figs 2C and D, respectively) shows no substantial changes in
the proportion of short to long hotspots, with ,o=0.3 and
,o=0.5. However, in the absence of 53BP1, the frequency of
longer hotspots increases signiﬁcantly when AID is overex-
pressed (Figs 2A and B). Thus, proper DNA repair that is de-
pendent on 53BP1 ensures the predominance of short hotspots,
even when AID is overexpressed. Figure 2 shows that all these
features are observed while scanning with windows of width

Fig. 2. Hotspot length distributions. A presents the distributions for the
53BP1—/—AID—/— sample, B for 53BP1‘/‘AID”, C for AID‘/‘ and D
for AID”. The distributions for the hotspots determined with SS5000,
SS2500 and SSZOOO are shown as continuous lines, whereas those for
NB0,05 and NBOIOI as dashed lines. Each graph corresponds to a
(Gaussian) kernel density estimate of the underlying distribution

2000, 2500 and 5000, where hot_scan is shown to be more
powerful (Fig. 1).

Most of these results are not observed when analyzing the
same data by the local method described in Section 2.3. This
becomes clear by inspection of the dashed lines in Figure 2,
which correspond to the length distributions for hotspots de-
tected by NBom and NB0.05. Even at ca, =0.05, for which one
would expect longer hotspots, the local method is unable to
detect the changes in the frequency of the long hotspots to the
extent brought by hot_scan. It is important to note that by
following (4), the local method would classify two consecutive
breakpoints as being part of a hotspot if their distance is smaller
than ln (1 — ac)/ln (1 — p). Using larger values for ca, allows thus
for larger gaps. Values >0.05 would, however, correspond to
tests with type I errors higher to what is commonly acceptable.

The results in Figure 2 present the differences in the hotspot
lengths deﬁned by the scan statistic and the local method.
However, they do not provide any information about the relative
positions of the hotspots detected by either technique. To address
this aspect, we analyzed the relative hotspot positions for all four
datasets described in Section 2.4. As an example, Figure 3 pre-
sents the hotspots for chromosome 9 estimated via NBom, SS500,
SS2500 and SS5000. A comparison of the hotspots found by NBom
(Fig. 3A) and those by the scan statistic with a relatively small
window, namely, by SS500 (Fig. 3C), shows that the hotspots
deﬁned by either method share the same location. However,
the analysis with SS2500 and SS5000 (Figs 3D and B) reveals the
existence of longer hotspots, which include one or few smaller

Fig. 3. Relative position for the hotspots in chromosome 9. The circular plots in A, B, C and D show, respectively, the hotspots inferred by the local
method and the scan statistic with w = 500, 5000 and 2500. The innermost track presents the hotspots for the AID” data, the next track shows those for
the AID_/_ sample, then those for 53BP1_/_AID” and the outermost track for 53BP1_/_AID_/_. Traces in E—H present few examples of the actual
translocation breakpoints and the estimated hotspots by both techniques for the AID” data. The hotspots by the scan statistic (with w = 5000) are
shown in pink and those by the local method in blue. The actual locations of these segments within the chromosome are identiﬁed with the labels (a)—(d)
in A and B. The segment in F corresponds to the full extension of the F [1'] gene. Circular plots were made with circos (Krzywinski et al., 2009), by plotting
the signiﬁcance of each hotspot along the radial axis as —log ([7) in A and —10 g ([3) in B, C and D. Owing to the sparsity of the translocation hotspots, all
the hotspot regions in B were expanded by using a scaling factor equal to 10 000. The same regions deﬁned in B were also expanded in A, C and D to

which only becomes apparent at larger scales. These features are

clearly overseen by the NB method because of its local nature. and S2).

Few examples of the scaling effect are shown by the examples
in Figures 3E, G and H. These results are consistent with
those observed for other chromosomes (Supplementary Figs S1

Translocation hotspots via scan statistics

 

Overexpression of AID in the absence of 53BP1 results not
only in the increase in the number of translocation but also de-
ﬁnes larger regions where these events cluster. In addition, AID
overexpression in 53BP1_/_ cells results in elongation of pre-
existing hotspot regions. This is apparent when comparing the
outermost track and the neighboring one on the circular graph
that corresponds to the analysis with SS500 (Fig. 3C) for the
53BP1_/_AID_/_ and the 53BP1_/_AID” data. The analysis
of the same data with a larger scanning window, namely, with
SS2500 and SS5000, gives a similar result, but the affected regions
are much larger (Figs 3D and B). The length of most hotspots in
this situation is greatly reduced in 53BP1 sufﬁcient samples. This
is apparent for the hotspots from the 53BP1_/_AID” and the
AID” data. Interestingly, the effect of 53BP1 correlates with the
signiﬁcance of the hotspots.

We conclude that hotspot length is dependent on 53BP1, and
that AID overexpression in the absence of 53BP1 results in trans-
locations that cluster over large regions.

3.3 Exclusive hotspots

Most of the more prominent hotspots are deﬁned by both the
scan statistic and the local method (Figs 3A and C and
Supplementary Figs S1A, C and S2A and C). However, both
methods reveal exclusive clustering regions (Supplementary
Tables S2 and S3). To identify AID-dependent hotspots that
are exclusive to each method, we compared the AID” and the
AID_/_ data. We found 36 exclusive hotspots with hot_scan
(Supplementary Table S2) and 27 exclusive hotspots with NB0.05
and NB<0,01 (Supplementary Table S3). The exclusive hotspots
obtained by the scan statistic were deﬁned using different
window widths (50, 100, 150, 250, 500, 1000, 2500 and
5000 bp). Regions that are identiﬁed as exclusive AID hotspots
were also analyzed for several biologically relevant markers.
First, we analyzed whether our exclusive hotspots correlate
with replication protein A (RPA) binding sites in activated B
cells (Hakim et al., 2012; Yamane et al., 2011). The sites of
RPA accumulation have been shown to overlap well with AID
targets genome-wide, and it was proposed that RPA marks AID-
induced DNA double-strand breaks. Further, we analyzed the
overlap with sites where RNA Polymerase II (PolII) accumu-
lates, as it was shown that transcription is necessary for AID
targeting (Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007). We also analyzed
the overlap with known fragile regions, namely, by the early
replicating fragile sites and common fragile sites (CF S) (Barlow
et al., 2013). The results of all these comparisons are summarized
in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3. A total of 20 of the 36
(55.5%) exclusive hotspots found by the scan statistic were
common to all sites. Notably, all of these sites are associated
with the P011] signal (Supplementary Table S2). On the other
hand, only 8 of the 27 (29.6%) exclusive hotspots of the local
method fall within these sites, and 6 are associated with the P011]
signal (Supplementary Table S3). Thus, the hotspots deﬁned by
the scan statistic show higher correlation with active transcrip-
tion, RPA accumulation and CF S than those deﬁned by the local
method.

AID leads to the accumulation of somatic mutations in a large
number of non-immunoglobulin genes (Nussenzweig and
Nussenzweig, 2010). An analysis for the presence of SHMs in

1 496 058 bp from activated B cells Wamane et al., 2011) revealed
a number of non-immunoglobulin genes with AID-dependent
mutations: Il4ra, Grap, HistIhIc, Ly6e, Gadd45g and [141'].
Three of these, namely, Il4ra, Grap and Ly6e, were detected as
genes with AID-dependent hotspots by both methods, but a hot-
spot in HistIhIc (mutation rate in IgIc-AID Ung_/_: 79.7 x10_5)
was only found by hot_scan (Supplementary Table S2 and
Supplementary Fig. S3). Three other genes associated with
chromosomal translocations were detected exclusively by
hot_scan, namely, FliI, Dlx5 and Birc3. The Fli] (Friend leu-
kemia integration 1) gene (Fig. 3F) is translocated in 90% of
Ewing sarcomas and is important in tumorigenesis (Riggi and
Stamenkovic, 2007). Dlx5 (distal-less homeobox 5) is implicated
in T-cell lymphomas (Tan et al., 2008). Finally, the Birc3 (bacu-
loviral IAP repeat-containing 3) gene encodes an apoptosis in-
hibitor that is associated with MALT lymphomas (Dierlamm
et al., 1999). A complementary enrichment analysis Wang
et al., 2013) for the genes identiﬁed by hot_scan is included
in Supplementary Figures S5 and S8 and Supplementary Tables
S4 and S5. The functional categories associated with the scan
statistic hotspots indicate that the top ranked genes are import-
ant in B lymphocytes.

4 DISCUSSION

Here we describe a method for the identiﬁcation of chromosomal
translocation hotspots. In contrast to a previous procedure,
which we refer here to as the local method, the control level
for the detection of a cluster is deﬁned on a chomosome-wide
basis by using scan statistics. We show via simulations that scan
statistics perform equally well as the local method in datasets
where the hotspots are relatively obvious. Scan statistics are su-
perior than the local method in more challenging situations,
characterized by a higher translocation rate outside hotspot re-
gions. This depends on the width of the scanning window, and its
choice requires some calibration. We present a method that is
able to accomplish this.

We show that inferences made with scan statistics have im-
portant consequences in the analysis of translocation hotspots in
primary B cells. The previous study by J ankovic et al. (2013)
showed that 53BP1 deﬁciency results in an increase of rearrange-
ments to intergenic regions and changes the frequency and dis-
tribution of translocations in y3, y1 immunoglobulin switch
regions and other 16 prominent hotspots. Our analysis adds to
these ﬁndings by showing that the 53BP1 deﬁciency results in the
overall enrichment of longer hotspots. These results support the
previous conclusion that 53BP1 prevents the resection of DNA,
thus resulting in shorter hotspots (Jankovic et al., 2013). Our
analysis here also shows that an increased amount of AID results
in a substantial enlargement of pre-existing hotspot regions.
These changes can only be observed with wider scanning win-
dows (i.e with w = 2000, 2500 and 5000), and are not detected by
previous methods because of their local characterization of clus-
tering. The success of the scan statistic here is brought by its
ability to detect events spread across several scales as is shown
by the analyses made with several scanning window widths. Our
analysis with the scan statistic is able to identify several exclusive
hotspots whose authenticity is supported by independent

experimental approaches. Some of these exclusive events are
localized in genes that are known to be relevant in tumorigenesis.

The approach presented here may be applied to a variety of
questions related to the detection of unusual clustering of a given
pattern throughout the genome. Few recent examples of particu-
lar interest are the detection of enriched genomic interaction re-
gions such as those deﬁned via ChIP-seq experiments (Ma and
Wong, 2011), 4C-seq experiments (Simonis et al., 2006) and
DNA—DNA contact sites (de Wit and de Laat, 2012). We
expect our method to be especially useful for the analysis of
data where a global signiﬁcance to clustering can be considered.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput profiling in biological research has re-
sulted in the availability of a wealth of data cataloguing the genetic,
epigenetic and transcriptional states of cells. These data could yield
discoveries that may lead to breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treat-
ment of human disease, but require statistical methods designed to
find the most relevant patterns from millions of potential interactions.
Aberrant DNA methylation is often a feature of cancer, and has been
proposed as a therapeutic target. However, the relationship between
DNA methylation and gene expression remains poorly understood.
Results: We propose Network-sparse Reduced-Rank Regression
(NsRRR), a multivariate regression framework capable of using prior
biological knowledge expressed as gene interaction networks to guide
the search for associations between gene expression and DNA methy-
lation signatures. We use simulations to show the advantage of our
proposed model in terms of variable selection accuracy over alterna-
tive models that do not use prior network information. We discuss
an application of NsRRR to The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets on
primary ovarian tumours.

model is available at http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~gmontana

1 INTRODUCTION

Widespread adoption of high-throughput molecular proﬁling
technology by the biological research community has resulted
in a vast public resource of paired genomic data, where thou-
sands of measurements of different types are available for the
same biological samples. This in turn presents the opportunity to
develop appropriate statistical tools to infer relationships be-
tween such paired datasets in different biological contexts
(Minas et al., 2013). Here we are particularly interested in iden-
tifying associations between paired DNA methylation proﬁles
and expression levels of genes obtained from cancer samples.
DNA methylation involves addition of a methyl group to
cytosines in DNA. Where this is concentrated in promoter re-
gions, it tends to lead to silencing of expression of the

downstream gene. The association between DNA methylation
and gene expression is far from straightforward, and DNA
methylation has also been shown to be associated with active
transcription of genes (Suzuki and Bird, 2008). Aberrant DNA
methylation has been observed in almost every type of cancer
and patterns of DNA methylation have been linked to changes in
gene expression that associate with the development of drug
resistance. Obtaining insights into the links between DNA
methylation and gene expression in cancer is expected to be par-
ticularly helpful in moving towards addressing the issue of
acquired drug resistance, which remains one of the main unmet
clinical needs in cancer medicine (Vaughan et al., 2011).

A number of efforts have been made recently to address the
problem of detecting associations between DNA methylation
and gene expression proﬁles. By far, the most common scenario
involves the mapping of loci with DNA methylation to genes,
and using some measure of association between the levels of
DNA methylation and the levels of expression of the same
gene. Example measures of association include Pearson’s correl-
ation coefﬁcient (Rhee et al., 2013) and maximal information
coefﬁcient (Stone et al., 2013). In case—control designs, a
common approach consists in ﬁrst identifying differentially
methylated sites and differentially expressed traits, often using
standard two-sample univariate statistical tests (e. g. a t-test), and
then comparing the two resulting lists to detect potential overlaps
(Gervin et al., 2012)

In this article, we take a predictive modelling approach in
which we aim to identify a subset of DNA methylation measure-
ments that are highly predictive of a subset of gene expression
traits across a set of heterogeneous biological samples that, none-
theless, share some characteristic of interest (e.g. patients with
the same disease, and for which control samples may not be
available). The precise mechanisms by which DNA methylation
inﬂuence gene expression are far from fully understood, particu-
larly when it comes to inter- and intra—genic methylation (Suzuki
and Bird, 2008), and trans-acting regulation in which the 3D
structure of chromatin enables interactions between non-
adjacent regions of the genome (Lazarovici et al., 2013). A
recent study investigating genome-wide epigenetic and transcrip-
tional changes following acquisition of platinum resistance in
ovarian cancer cell lines showed that only a small proportion
of genes with an increase in DNA methylation had a correspond-
ing down-regulation of gene expression (Zeller et al., 2012). For
this reason, and to identify patterns of regulation where multiple

sites of methylation can drive a systematic alteration of a func-
tional expression program (akin to a higher eukaryotic equiva-
lent of a bacterial operon), we do not wish to restrict our
discovery to only those interactions for which each CpG locus
is mapped to a gene and directly related to that same gene’s
expression level. Instead, we would like to be able to identify
clear relationships between varying levels of DNA methylation
at any loci and corresponding changes in expression of any
genes, ideally with some relevance to some biological function.
The simplest approach to this problem would consist of ﬁtting all
possible univariate linear regression models, in which each gene
expression value is regressed on each DNA methylation level,
and all the resulting pairs are ranked based on the magnitude
and/or statistical signiﬁcance of the regression coefﬁcients. We
will refer to this method as mass-univariate linear modelling
(MULM). Such an approach, however, has two major draw-
backs: ﬁrst, because of the large number of hypothesis tests
that are simultaneously carried out, the experiment-wide signiﬁ-
cance level would be far too stringent; second, all predictors and
responses are modelled as statistically independent while also
ignoring any functional relationship between genes.

To tackle these limitations, we present a multivariate regres-
sion model for the simultaneous selection of highly predictive
DNA methylation predictors and the most predictable gene ex-
pression proﬁles. The high dimensionality and the small sample
size pose the challenging problems of coefﬁcient estimation and
variable selection. Models involving dimension reduction tech-
niques in conjunction with 61 penalization on the coefﬁcients,
such as sparse partial least squares (sPLS), have been explored
in related applications, including the integrated analysis of paired
‘omics’ data (16 Cao et al., 2008). In this work, we adopt a
reduced-rank regression (RRR) approach, which assumes a
linear association between DNA methylation and gene expres-
sion variables; the predictor vectors are projections of the methy-
lation variables matrix into a lower dimensional space, and the
response vectors are projections of the gene expression variables
into a lower dimensional space.

In light of the complex interactions between nucleic acids, pro-
teins and metabolites in all organisms, networks have become
fundamental in the understanding of biological systems. In fact,
these networks appear to underpin biological processes found
throughout living things. For instance, in a recent methyla-
tion—gene expression study, while validating the ﬁndings of
top-ranking gene pairs, a substantially larger proportion of
them were found to be connected in the Protein—Protein
Interaction (PPI) network compared with the expected number
from a random distribution (J oung et al., 2013). Multiple inter-
acting components work together in functional modules to bring
about disease phenotypes or other traits (Calvano et al., 2005).
From a statistical standpoint, the utilization of prior information
encoded in biological networks provides a form of regulariza-
tion, and has been shown to improve inference from high-
dimensional datasets (Chuang et al., 2007). We seek to improve
variable selection accuracy and the interpretability of our regres-
sion model by guiding variable selection to highlight sets of co-
methylated and co-expressed genes that are known to co-operate
in enacting some biological processes. This is achieved by extend-
ing our previous work (Vounou et al., 2010, 2012) on penalized
regression through the use of an additional penalty function on

 

Fig. 1. Illustration of the NsRRR principle: predictor variables (X) and
response variables ()0 are each organized into a network via an adjacency
matrix encoding prior information on relatedness of the variables. A set
of predictor variables (e.g. dark coloured X’s) will be selected by the
NsRRR model if they show an association with a set of response vari-
ables (e.g. dark coloured Y’s). Within the sets of selected predictors and
responses, variables are more likely to be selected together if they are also
connected in the respective networks (as is the case with both the dark X’s
and the dark Y’s)

the regression coefﬁcients, which incorporates prior information
regarding the functional relatedness between predictor variables
and between response variables, respectively. We call the result-
ing model Network-sparse Reduced-Rank Regression (NsRRR).
When the response variable is univariate, incorporating such
structural information to encourage the selection of mutually
interacting genes has been shown to give improved variable se-
lection result in terms of both accuracy and interpretability (Li
and Li, 2008; Azencott et al., 2013). Here we extend this principle
to multivariate responses arising when studying genome-wide
expression levels. An illustration of the NsRRR principle is
given in Figure l, in which trivial networks of predictor variables
and response variables are shown, with an example of possible
sets of selected variables highlighted in a darker colour. For
example, if variation in the levels of the darker response variables
is explained by variation in the darker predictor variables, they
are likely to be selected in the NsRRR model because each set is
also connected within its respective network topology.

The remainder of the article is organized as follows: In Section
2, we introduce the NsRRR model, the estimation algorithm and
a procedure for parameter tuning. In Section 3, we report on
extensive simulation studies set up to explore the properties of
the model, and compare its performance on alternative
approaches using both artiﬁcial and real datasets. In Section 4,
we present an integrative analysis of ovarian cancer data con-
taining genome-wide proﬁles of both DNA methylation and
gene expressions.

2.1 Problem formulation

We denote by X* the n X p design matrix of DNA methylation pre-
dictors, and by Y* the n X q response matrix of gene expression meas-
urements. We normalize the columns of the data matrices to have zero
mean and unit length, and denote the resulting matrices by X and Y,
respectively. We write X]- for the n—dimensional column vector extracted
from the jth column of X, and likewise Yk for the km column of Y.

Network-guided regression for integrative data analysis

 

The prior information to describe functional relatedness of the vari-
ables is expressed in the form of biological networks. These networks
quantify the relatedness between any two genes, and can be built using
a number of external sources. The application we present here was de-
veloped in the context of identifying systematic epigenetic regulation of
pathway-level gene expression programs, and so chose to use a measure
of the functional similarity based on shared pathway annotations between
the genes mapped to each data entity (see Section 4). However, in other
contexts there might be a number of alternative networks that could be
advantageous for informed variable selection. For example, a regression
task looking to use gene co-expression patterns to infer the functional
roles of unknown genes or proteins might use the networks to encode
sequence similarity or shared protein domains.

We denote by G, =(Vx, Ex) the DNA methylation network and by
Gy =(Vy, By) the gene expressions network. The vertex set Vx contains
the p predictors in X, and the edge set E, is given in terms of a weighted
adjacency matrix Wx on Vx. The edge weight is a real number in [0,1].
A large weight indicates the corresponding genes pair is strongly func-
tionally related.

2.2 Network-driven sRRR

The standard regression model links the predictors and responses by
Y=X C + E, where C is the p X q coefﬁcient matrix in which the (j, k)
entry quantiﬁes the association between the jth DNA methylation and km
gene expression, and E is the matrix of random errors with zero mean. An
estimate of C, denoted by C, is traditionally obtained by minimizing the
loss function ||Y — X Cllzf, where ||.| I; denotes the Frobenius norm
(Reinsel and Velu, 1988). When p 5 n so that X’ X is invertible, a
closed form solution exists, i.e. C =(X’X)_1X Y, which is of full rank.
However, minimizing the squared loss on the multivariate responses does
not account for the dependence structure in the responses.

Our proposal is to impose a rank constraint on the coefﬁcient matrix
C, i.e. rank(C) = R 5 min{p, q}. For a given R, C can be expressed as the
product of two matrices B and A, each having full rank,

R R
C=BA = 219%“) = 2 C") (1)
r—l

— r=l

where B is a p X R matrix whose rm column is b“), and A is an R X q
matrix whose rm row is a“). The p X q matrix C“) denotes the rm layer of
C, ranked in decreasing order of the strength of association. A desirable
feature of the matrix decomposition C = BA is that it allows separate
evaluation on the effect of each predictor and each response: for instance,
the jth entry of b“) quantiﬁes the contribution of the jth DNA methylation
site and the km entry in of a“) quantiﬁes the effect on the km gene ex-
pression in the rm rank. The rank constraint gives rise to a reduction in
the number of parameters to estimate and accounts for the multivariate
nature of the response variables.

Minimizing with respect to the empirical loss ||Y — XBAI I27, the esti-
mates B and 141 can be obtained as, respectively,

3 = (mo—1X YH(R),/1 = (H<R>)’ (2)

where H“) is the q X R matrix in which the rm column is the normalized
eigenvector corresponding to the rm largest eigenvalue of
Y’ X (X ’ X)_1X ’ Y. The normalization condition ensures that (1) is uniquely
deﬁned because otherwise for any R X R non-singular square matrix T,
we have matrices B and 141 such that: C =BA =(BT)(T‘1A)=B/I.

The constraint on H‘R), which guarantees uniqueness of (1), can be
reformulated through B and 111. Note that the real matrix Y’ X (X X)_1X ’ Y
is symmetric and thus normal. By the spectral theorem, we have:

YX(XX)‘1X Y= H(R)(®2)(R)(H(R))’ (3)

where (@2)(R) is the R X R diagonal matrix whose diagonal corresponds
to the eigenvalues of Y’X(X’X)_1X’ Y. Pre-multiplying (3) by (H(R))’

and post-multiplying by H‘R), while noting (AH(R))’H(R) =1, we have:
(H‘R))’ Y’ X()r7 X)_1X YH(R) =(®2)(R). As such, B must satisfy:

B’XIXB = (H(R))’ Y X(X’ X)-1 y YH<R) 2 (@2)(R) (4)
Because the columns of H‘R) are orthonormal vectors, 141 must satisfy:
1313/ = (H‘R))’H1R) = I. (5)

Equations (4) and (5) imply that (XB)/1 corresponds to the singular
value decomposition of Y— E, in which the R linear combinations of X
via (XB) are orthogonal and thus linearly independent, and so do the
columns of 

The computation in (2) and (3) involve estimating the inverse covari-
ance matrix, (X ’ X)—1 , which may not exist when n < p. A common option
consists of taking (X’ X + yI)_1, where I is the identity matrix and y is a
tuning scalar parameter (Chen et al., 2012). Here we set (X ’ X)—1 equal to
I, which is also commonly done in high-dimensional settings (Tenenhaus
et al., 2014; Witten et al., 2009), and does not require parameter tuning.
Moreover, this parameterization can be interpreted as applying an ex-
treme de-correlation. This can be seen by taking a large yin the shrinkage
estimator above while preserving the variances. Other alternatives include
using a generalized inverse, but this would be too computationally
demanding in our setting.

In our context, we expect that any existing association will only involve a
small subset of DNA methylations and a small subset of gene expressions,
which need to be identiﬁed. Variable selection can be carried out by adding a
penalty on the £1 norm of the regression coefﬁcients, which leads to a con-
tinuous shrinkage of the coefﬁcient estimates towards zero (Tibshirani,
1996). We propose the use of an additional penalty that regularizes the so-
lution by taking into account the functional relatedness among genes as
encoded by the given networks. To our knowledge, this would be the ﬁrst
model, which gives network-regularized sparse association between DNA
methylation and multiple-gene expression measurements. The RRR model
grants us the ﬂexibility of applying separate penalties for the coefﬁcients
associated to the DNA methylations variables and the gene expression vari-
ables. As such, we propose to minimize the following objective function:

R R
Hy_gguwwe+23adu+adu) @
r=l r=1

where PX (b(’)) is the penalty accounting for the pattern in DNA methylation,
and Py (am) accounts for the pattern in gene expression. Both penalty func-
tions have a similar expression of form,

mwm=mmWMHLw0 m

involving an 61 penalty and a normalized Laplacian penalty. When the
Laplacian penalty is not included, the model reduces to the sRRR model.
We write  for the node degree of X]- deﬁned as  = ZN wjxt, where
t~j if and only if w}; 75 0. The vertex degree is a measure of centrality, so
that nodes with large degree (‘hub nodes’) correspond to the active genes,
which interact with many others. Similarly, we deﬁne Wy and  . The
normalized Laplacian penalty regularizes the coefﬁcients by prior infor-
mation encoded in Gx and Gy. For the coefﬁcients associated to DNA

methylations, this penalty is deﬁned as

 

b b
L b = w?“ —J — l 2 8
()M;;Mﬂ§ ﬂ? 0
that is, it penalizes the square of normalized difference between bj and b, if
the jth and 1th predictors are connected in Gx, based on the assumption
that functionally related variables exert similar effects. Here, we have
dropped the superscript r for convenience.

The Laplacian penalty is in the form of the sum of squares, which is a
strictly convex function. This enables (8) to smooth the estimates 1;]- and
I), such that bj/ and bl/M become clqse (Chung, 1997). In particu-
lar, if a sparse solution includes positive bj and 1), =0, the normalized

Laplacian penalty (8) can drive 1;, towards a non-zero value thus to
encourage the selection of the jth and 1th methylation altogether. As
such, the functionally related pair is selected, and the prior structural
knowledge has been accounted toA guide the selection of a biologically
plausible model. The coefﬁcients 1) are rescaled according to the vertex
degree to highlight the importance of high centrality nodes, while ensur-
ing each variable is equally penalized regardless of its node degree in Gx
(Chung, 1997). The regularization parameter u, a non-negative real
number, controls the strength of this smoothing effect. As [1. increases
from zero, the normalized 17]" and I), get closer to each other if the cor-
responding variables are connected via paths in G X. As [1. goes to inﬁnity,
the individual coefﬁcient 1;]- tends to a weighted mean of the correlation
coefﬁcients between the responses and the predictors indexed {1: t~j},
where the weighted mean is computed with respect to the nodes degrees.
Further details on the smoothing effects imposed by the graph penalty as
[1. goes to inﬁnity, can be found in Supplementary Material, Section A.

The smoothing effect triggered by M. has a decisive impact on the
topological patterns of the selected variables by the NsRRR. When
11:0, no smoothing effect occurs, as the penalty terms acting on the
networks are not taken into account; as [1. increases, the selected variables
tend to fall into several densely connected subgraphs, or ‘communities’ in
the given networks. On the other hand, when p. is sufﬁciently large, the
model is enforced to select variables with large node degrees, which usu-
ally lie in one or few components of the networks. Here, a component
refers to a subgraph in which every pair of nodes is connected via paths
and which is disconnected to the nodes not in the subgraph. The optimal
amount of regularization that the prior knowledge contributes to the
statistical model depends on graph density, component structure and
how informative the networks are with respect to the data. The issue of
parameter tuning will be addressed in Section 2.4.

2.3 Estimation algorithm

In this section, we outline the key steps in the estimation procedure to
obtain 13 r and fl“), which minimize (6) subject to penalties (7) and (8) and
under the constraint conditions (2) and (4). We begin with the rank-one
NsRRR model. We introduce Lagrange multipliers 6a and 6;, to solve the

constraint optimization problem. After rearrangement, (6) becomes:
—2aY’Xb + aa’b’b + agaa’ + abb’b + Px(b) + Py(a) (9)

where 6,, and 6;, are constants such that 6/1; = 62 and 6363’ = I and 62 is the
largest eigenvalue of Y’ XX’ Y. Note that (9) is biconvex, and therefore, it
can be solved by recursively ﬁxing one of b and a and optimizing with
respect to the other one alone, using a co-ordinate descent algorithm
(Friedman et al., 2007). A full derivation of the algorithm can be found
in the Supplementary material, Section C, with the pseudocode given in
Algorithm 1.

Once the estimates corresponding to the ﬁrst rank have been obtained,
the higher rank estimates can be extracted one at a time by ﬁrst regressing
out the ﬁtted responses predicted by the selected predictors found at the
current rank, and then re—ﬁtting the model, as follows. Starting with
r = 1, and Y“) = Y*, suppose the rm rank coefﬁcients 1; r and fl“) have
been obtained, and a decision has been made on which X’s and Y’s have
been selected (see Section 2.4). We deﬁne the submatrices Xsub and Ysub
from X * and Y"), respectively, as consisting of the selected variables only.
A rank-one RRR is then ﬁt on (Xsub, Ysub) and the ﬁtted response Ysub is
obtained. The submatrix Ysub in Y") is substituted by Y5“), — Y5“), and we
call the resultant matrix Y0“). Finally, we normalize the columns of
Y‘“r 1) and denote the output by Y. The (r+ 1)” rank estimates are ob-
tained by applying the unit-rank NsRRR algorithm on the updated re-
sponse matrix Y and the same X matrix as in the previous computations.
This procedure is applied for each subsequent rank r.

2.4 Parameter tuning procedures

The rank-one NsRRR model has three regularization parameters, i.e. Aa,
Ab and it. In our setting, the ﬁrst two parameters control the number of
non-zero coefﬁcients, whereas it varies the degree of regularization that is
imposed by the network structure. These regularization parameters are
traditionally determined by a cross-validation procedure in which the
model ﬁt is assessed by its prediction error. Nonetheless, Ag and A], opti-
mized in such a way often result in many noise variables being selected, in
particular, when p, q> >n as in our case. When no prior connectivity
knowledge is used, so that 11:0, a data resampling procedure called
stability selection can be adopted to improve variable selection accuracy
(Meinshausen and Biihlmann, 2010). Stability selection consists of ﬁtting
the sparse regression model to a large number of subsamples of the data
matrices, where each subsample generally comprises half of the subjects.
Variable selection results across all subsamples are integrated to compute
empirical selection probabilities 13X and 131/. The sets of important vari-
ables are deﬁned as 3X: {1' :  Z 71X} and 191/: {k :13]: Z 71y}, where 71X
and 71y are real numbers in [0, 1]. One of the appealing features of this
procedure is that the ranking of the variables, and in particular the high-
ranking variables, is generally insensitive to the particular choice of the
regularization parameters (Meinshausen and Biihlmann, 2010; Vounou
et al., 2012). For our model, we propose a hybrid cross-validation strat-
egy to search for an optimal [1. within a set 8 of possible candidate values,
which uses an internal stability selection procedure for ranking the
selected variables corresponding to each [1. value.

Speciﬁcally, we use a 10-fold cross-validation. For each fold, we denote
the training dataset as Dtrain and the testing dataset as Dtest. Within each
fold, we ﬁrstly generate M subsamples extracted without replacement
from Dtrain, each consisting of half the subjects in Dtrain. For each sub-
sample, we ﬁt a rank-one NsRRR model with ﬁxed Ag and A], and iden-
tify variables corresponding to the non-zero entries of Z; and fl. To assess
the prediction error of a model ﬁtted on the selected variables, we ﬁt a
rank-one RRR model using those variables and evaluate the prediction
error in Frobenius norm. Ultimately, we select the value of the p. corres-
ponding to the minimum prediction error. This procedure is repeated for
all 10 folds, and during this process, we keep track of the number of times
that each [1. has been deemed optimal across the 10 X M subsampled
data. The candidate with the most counts is the chosen 1).. Once ﬂ. is
obtained, we apply again a stability selection procedure by taking [1. = ﬂ.
and selecting Ag and A], to achieve the same sparsity previously obtained
in SX and Sy.

3 SIMULATION STUDIES

In this section, we present simulation studies to characterize
the power of NsRRR model to detect the true predictors and
responses, and compare its performance with the sparse sRRR
model that does not take any prior knowledge into account,
and to a MULM approach in which a linear model is ﬁtted
for all possible combinations of predictors and responses. The
sRRR estimation algorithm is also related to the sPLS algo-
rithms (lé Cao et al., 2008; Vounou et al., 2010), and they
have similar performance in variable selection tasks. We pre-
sent two types of simulation studies: (i) using randomly gen-
erated variables and (ii) using variables extracted from a real
dataset.

In all simulations, we use n = 100, p = 1000 and q = 1000 so
that n < < p and q. For each study type, we perform ﬁve sets of
simulations, corresponding to different signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs) (0.01, 0.005, 0.0025, 0.001 and 0.0005). In each case,
we randomly generate 2000 datasets, each consisting of data
matrices X, and Y as well as networks GX and GK The signal-
carriers variables are always known, so the performance of each
model can be evaluated by comparing the number of correctly
identiﬁed predictors and responses while controlling for the
number of falsely detected variables. For the simulations of
type (I), we generate the n X p predictor matrix X by simulating
from independent uniform distributions in the unit interval. The
associations between X and Y are introduced by assuming that
exactly 80 predictors and 80 responses contribute to the non-
random associations. For simplicity, we further assume the
non-random associations have rank-one. By (1), we obtain the
responses as Y=Xba+n-E, where E is a p X q matrix of
random errors, generated from independent standard normal
distributions, and n is a positive real number set to achieve the
desired SNRs. Because causal methylation sites tend to down-
regulate gene expressions, we generate the non-zero entries of b
and a such that the signal carrying X’s and Y’s are negatively
correlated. For the simulations of type (II), we use real DNA
methylation and associated gene expression data obtained from
the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), as further described in
Section 4. Starting from the full matrices, each artiﬁcial dataset is
generated by randomly extracting an n X p submatrix X from the
methylation matrix and an n X q submatrix Z from the gene
expression matrix; we then permute the columns of Z to
obtain 2 so as to remove any potential association; ﬁnally, we
compute the response matrix Y as before by assuming a linear
model of form Y= Xba+ 772. We normalize the columns of X
and Y to have zero mean and unit Euclidean norm, as required
by NsRRR and sRRR.

As for the network generation, we randomly partition the
signal-carrying variables into clusters of 10 variables, and like-
wise partition the non—signal—carriers into clusters of 10, re-
sulting in 100 clusters for X and the same number for Y.
Assuming the probability that a pair of nodes are directly
connected is independent to all other pairs, we generate the
networks Gx and Gy using a set of three probability param-
eters: pC is the probability of connection between variables
belonging to the same cluster; pCC is the probability of con-
nection between signal-carriers or non—signal-carriers belonging
to different clusters; pSN is the probability of connection

between a signal-carrier and a non—signal—carrier. We generate
networks such that signal-carrying variables are relatively den-
sely connected, whereas there are few links between these vari-
ables and the non—signal-carriers. Speciﬁcally, we set pC = 0.4,
pCC = 0.13, pSN = 0.04 to give an experimental average prob-
ability of connection of 0.12, matching that of the networks in
the analysed data in Section 4.

We ﬁt the rank-one NsRRR and sRRR models, as well as
the MULM to each dataset, and we tune the parameters to
ensure that exactly 160 X’s and 160 Y’s have non-zero coefﬁ-
cients for each model that is ﬁtted. Note that the sparsity level
does not affect the relative performance of the three models as
long as the same sparsity is retained for all models so that the
results are comparable. Initial test runs showed that the opti-
mal ,u. for the simulated datasets, using the procedure
described in Section 2.4, was rarely >5. Therefore, in the ex-
periments presented here, we restrict the search of ,0. to a
range of values in ®=(0.5, 1,2, 3, 5). Because in our experi-
ments we generate a total number of 20 000 simulated data-
sets, the ,u. parameter is optimized only once for each
simulation scenario, using the search procedure of Section
2.4, at a ﬁxed SNR value of 0.0005. This approach reduces
the computational burden without introducing any bias.
However, as a result of this, the performance of NsRRR
may be suboptimal in some cases. For type (I) simulations,
we obtain ,0. = 3 and type (II) simulations we obtain ,0. =2. We
compute the empirical selection probabilities for all variables
within each simulation set. By varying the threshold from 1 to
0 and deﬁning the important variables as those with selection
probabilities greater than the threshold, we can construct the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for X and Y,
respectively. In a ROC curve, the proportion of signal-carriers
classiﬁed as important variables (true-positive rate) is plotted
against the proportion of non—signal-carriers classiﬁed as im-
portant variables (false-positive rate). The area under curve
(AUC) can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly
chosen signal carrying variable having larger selection prob-
ability than a randomly chosen variable carrying no signal,
which will be used as the evaluation criterion for model
comparison.

The results of these studies are summarized in Figure 2, where
the AUC is plotted against the SNR. The ﬁrst column (plots A
and C) summarizes the performance of variable selection in the
space of predictors for simulation types (I) and (II), respectively,
whereas the second column (plots B and D) corresponds to
analogous performance levels in the space of responses. For
type (I) simulations, we observe that the sRRR and NsRRR
models, which are based on a global search for association, con-
sistently outperform the MULM approach, which is based on
pairwise testing. When the SNR is >0.005, the difference in per-
formance between sRRR and NsRRR models is only marginal.
However, as the SNR continues to decrease down to 0.0005,
NsRRR model continues to maintain a much higher perform-
ance compared with the sRRR model. This demonstrates that
incorporating prior knowledge in the form of a connectivity
matrix can enhance the power of variable selection and outper-
form the models that ignore this additional information. Similar
patterns are observed in plots C and D, which correspond to type
(II) simulations.

4 AN APPLICATION TO OVARIAN CANCER

Aberrant DNA methylation in cancer has been proposed as a
mechanism for facilitating the plasticity of gene expression states
that enables tumour cells to adapt to chemotherapies, ultimately
resulting in acquired drug resistance in cancer. Acquired drug
resistance is the greatest unmet clinical need currently facing suf-
ferers of a number of cancers, notably including ovarian cancer
(Vaughan et al., 2011). Identifying common associations between
gene expression and DNA methylation in ovarian cancer could
yield insight into the mechanisms by which tumour cells can
exploit epigenetic dysregulation to adapt to changes in their
surroundings. Therefore, this could indicate certain paths to
acquired drug resistance.

We apply NsRRR to a paired dataset, containing genome-
wide measurement proﬁles of both gene expression and DNA
methylation for 349 primary ovarian tumours. DNA methyla-
tion levels are obtained from the ratios of background-corrected
methylated and unmethylated probe intensities measured by
Illumina HumanMethylation27k BeadArrays, downloaded
from TCGA (2011). Gene expression levels are obtained by
applying robust multi-array average (RMA) normalization
(Irizarry et al., 2003) to raw data CEL ﬁles from Affymetrix
HT-HGU133A GeneChips, also downloaded from TCGA.

The functional relatedness between variables is encoded into
networks based on shared pathway annotations. Pathway anno-
tations are downloaded from Consensus Pathway DB (CPDB), a
repository of pathway-level information from multiple data-
bases, representing the consensus across the community regard-
ing which genes are involved in which biological processes
(Kamburov et al., 2011). As the functional annotations are pro-
vided at the gene level, we ﬁrst ﬁnd which gene corresponds to
each CpG site represented in the DNA methylation dataset,
using the manufacturer’s annotations (which are based on prox-
imity). Similarly, we ﬁnd which gene corresponds to each

probeset in the gene expression dataset, again using the manu-
facturer’s annotations. As such, weights between the methylation
sites inherit the weights of the corresponding genes. We construct
a weighted adjacency matrix describing the pairwise relationships
between variables 1' and j based on Dice’s coincidence index
(Dice, 1945): W,.J-=2|IﬂJ|/(|I| + |J|), where I and J are the set
of CPDB pathway annotations for the gene mapping to variable
i and j, respectively. The number of elements in set A is denoted
by |A|. Each Wy- score takes on a maximum value of 1 when the
two annotation lists are identical, and a minimum value of 0
when there is no overlap between the two lists.

We apply the algorithm introduced in Section 2.4 to search for
the optimal ,u. for our data from a broad range of candidates
values, ®=(0, 0.5, 5, 50, 500, 5000). The maximum value of ,u.
was purposely chosen to be large to include the case of an ex-
treme penalization. We set the number of subsamples in each of
the 10 folds to M = 200 and ﬁx 2,, and A], such that exactly 200
predictors and 200 responses are selected in each subsample. We
present the full table of results in Supplementary Table STl. The
optimal ,u. parameter in this case was found to be ,0. = 50. Next,
we use stability selection procedure involving 5000 random sub-
sampled datasets, ﬁtting an NsRRR model to each one where ,u.
= 50 and exactly 200 X’s and 200 Y’s are selected. Estimates for
the importance of each variable are given by the empirical selec-
tion probability throughout the subsamples. Here, we beneﬁt
from the robustness of the data resampling scheme in
Section 2.4, which allows us to ﬁx the number of selected vari-
ables in each subsampled data while not affecting much of the
ﬁnal ranking of the variables. Following the terminology of
Section 2.4, we obtain a set SX of 200 predictor variables with
P(Xj) > 0 and a set SY of 4371 response variables with P( Yk) > 0.
For more manageable down/stream analysis, a subset of the se-
lected response variables S Y = Yk, P( Yk)>0.5 is chosen, which
represents 116 gene expression probes whose levels are robustly
and reliably predicted by the levels of S X. A list of the Affymetrix
and Illumina probe identiﬁers and corresponding gene symbols
for the selected variables (S X, S Y) is given in Supplementary
Table ST2. As the 200 top-ranking probes and 116 gene expres-
sions all have large selection probabilities (all >05), and they
constitute a manageable list of variables for further investigation,
we decide not to proceed to the higher rank estimates of the
NsRRR model.

Using the stability selection, it is also possible to extract a
matrix of empirical association probabilities (I), in which (DJ-k
denotes the probability that the jth methylation and the km
gene expression are simultaneously selected across the sub-
samples. Interestingly, CDj = CIDj/k, Vj,j’ e Sx, Vk, indicating that
the set of selected predictor variables are always selected to-
gether, regardless of which response variables were selected.
We illustrate this in Supplementary material, Section C (Figure
l), plotting the association scores (DJ-k across allAresponse vari-
ables k, for the ﬁrst three predictor variables in S X. These asso-
ciation proﬁle plots show that each of the selected predictor
variables show exactly the same pattern of selection probabilities
across the response variables.

As pathway co-annotation scores are used in the variable se-
lection process, it would be expected that the sets of predictor
and response variables selected in the NsRRR models would fall
into densely connected regions in the networks. In fact, the 200

selected predictors correspond to a densely connected subnet-
work of GX, where the average probability of connection is
0.9932, much higher than that for GX, 0.116. For the 116 selected
response variables, 107 of them comprise a large component in
which every node is connected to all other nodes via paths. The
average probability of connection for this large component is
0.143, higher than that for Gy, which is 0.125.

To explore the biological implications of the NsRRR results,
we tested the selected sets of variables for enrichment of CPDB
pathway terms based on the hypergeometric distribution. Of par-
ticular note, we found that the ‘mTOR signalling’ pathway was
enriched (p = 0.059), indicating greater membership among the
selected response variables than would be expected by chance.
This observation is interesting because mTOR signalling has
been implicated in many cancers, and more speciﬁcally, has
been shown to activate survival pathways that can lead to plat-
inum resistance in ovarian cancer (Peng et al., 2010).

One of our hypotheses relating to this study was that genes
with expression predicted by DNA methylation at a range of loci
are likely to be affected by pharmacological manipulation of the
genome-wide state of DNA methylation. Such manipulation can
occur through treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibi-
tor 5-aza—dC, principally through the loss of methyl groups at
CpG sites across the genome. Three studies were identiﬁed with
published genome-wide gene expression proﬁling data in cancer
cell lines both pre- and post-treatment with 5-aza—dC (Mueller
et al., 2007; Dannenberg and Edenberg, 2006; Khamas et al.,
2012), with Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession numbers
GSE47l7, GSE5230 and GSE32323, respectively. Normalized
data from each study were downloaded from GEO and analyzed
individually through application of the statistical package linear
models for microarray data (LIMMA) (Smyth, 2004), obtaining
empirical Bayes-moderated t-statistics for the difference in ex-
pression of each gene (in each study) following treatment with
5-aza—dC. Systematic changes in the expression levels of the genes
selected in our NsRRR model were evaluated in each of the 5-
aza-dC treatment studies using the mean-rank gene-set enrich-
ment test of (Michaud et al., 2008) (as implemented in the
‘geneSetTest’ function of the Bioconductor package limma).
This test evaluates the statistical signiﬁcance of the tendency
for genes in the list to be highly ranked among the study’s dif-
ferentially expressed genes. Interestingly, the results indicated
that the set of genes coming out of our analysis was systematic-
ally up-regulated on treatment with 5-aza-dC in all three separate
studies (P = 0.01, 0.02 and 0.002, respectively). The combination
of these results is highly signiﬁcant (P: 2.7 X 10‘4), incorporat-
ing the three sets of evidence using Fisher’s method. This result is
particularly important in that it illustrates that the set of genes
identiﬁed through our application of NsRRR as having expres-
sion levels predicted by DNA methylation proﬁles in ovarian
cancer, display consistent alteration in expression following al-
teration of the genome-wide state of DNA methylation in three
different cancer cell lines. Therefore, it is highly likely that the
expression of this set of genes is controlled by the state of DNA
methylation, and the results obtained from our application of
NsRRR reﬂect a real biological phenomenon.

Finally, we investigated aberrant expression of the genes cor-
responding to our response variables in a range of cancer types.
Using the CancerMA database it was found that most of the

genes with expression levels predicted by the selected DNA
methylation probes were over- or under-expressed in some
cancer types, with a number repeatedly displaying the same
effect in many different cancer types. For example, the gene
GATM was selected as a response variable, and this gene
shows consistent down-regulation of expression in many cancer
types, which is illustrated in Supplementary Material, Section C
(Figure 2), with a Forest Plot showing the distributions of base-2
log fold-changes of measured expression in cancer samples com-
pared with normal tissue, for a large number of independent
studies spanning nine different cancer types. This information
suggests that the genes we have identiﬁed as having expression
levels predicted by methylation of a set of loci in a cancer dataset,
and that are likely to show increased expression following treat-
ment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, may have func-
tional roles in malignancy.

5 DISCUSSION

The components of biological systems can be organized into
functional modules in which the constituent members work to-
gether to enact one process, such that alteration of a number of
individual members, as may occur in disease, can result in a
similar functional consequence (Zanzoni et al., 2009). Using net-
work topologies for incorporating prior knowledge about biolo-
gical systems into large-scale data analysis can highlight
important functional patterns hidden in the data. This more sys-
tems-level approach to multivariate data analysis, incorporating
prior knowledge, offers an improvement in robustness and reli-
ability over single-gene models (Efroni et al., 2007) There are also
advantages in terms of interpretation of the results, as it is easier
to plan laboratory experiments targeting a speciﬁc function than
it is a long list of individual genes. In our context, it is being able
to identify modules in which the methylation status of function-
ally related genes could predict the expression level of another
set of functionally related genes would be particularly useful,
and might be indicative of a mechanistic link between the two
functional units.

One example of an intuitive network would be a binary encod-
ing of PPIs: that is, two genes are connected in the network if and
only if their protein products interact (Li et al., 2012). Such a
network may be particularly suitable when the NsRRR model is
being applied to datasets involving a subset of genes that is
enriched for interaction, but for genome-wide analysis tasks
the network may be too sparse to be sufﬁciently informative
for the regression model. We propose a means of encoding func-
tional relatedness of the variables in the form of networks of
pathway annotation similarity.

We applied NsRRR to multivariate analysis of paired gene
expression and DNA methylation datasets from primary ovarian
tumours. We discovered a set of genes for which the expression
levels are predicted by the levels of methylation at a set of CpG
loci, mapping to a different set of genes. An encouraging result
came in the form of conﬁrmation in three independent gene ex-
pression proﬁling datasets that expression of the predicted genes
was signiﬁcantly up-regulated following treatment with the DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza—dC. Thus, pharmacological al-
teration of the state of DNA methylation was found to alter the
state of expression of the predicted genes. A number of the genes

in question were found to show aberrant expression proﬁles in a
number of cancers. So, although further clinical consequences of
this observation are yet to be established, these results may shed
light on the mechanism of action of epigenetic therapies that aim
to undo the aberrant DNA methylation patterns acquired by
cancer cells and give an indication of potential consequences of
these treatments. This is further suggested by the observation that
the set of genes with expression predicted by DNA methylation
proﬁles was enriched for mTOR signalling, which has been shown
to promote survival of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells. A
further point to note is that the genomic loci for which methyla-
tion levels predicted expression of these genes were found to map
to a different set of genes: therefore, this regulatory behaviour is
unlikely to reﬂect a direct mechanism of regulating expression via
DNA methylation, and it is perhaps more likely that there is a
downstream functional link between these two sets of genes. That
such a pattern was identiﬁed further justiﬁes the decision to take a
multivariate approach to the analysis of genome-wide levels of
gene expression and DNA methylation.

In our application, we extracted only variables associated to
the ﬁrst rank of the NsRRR model. Further rank estimates could
have been extracted following the procedure in Section 2.3.
For the unpenalized RRR model, there are well-established
approaches to guide the selection of the rank including graphical
procedures such as the rank trace plot (Izenman, 2008). In the
NsRRR model, an additional rank will generally be considered
as long as the current selection probabilities are sufﬁciently high,
and no further ranks would be explored as soon as the selection
probabilities fall below a given threshold.

The statistical methods presented in this article build on our
previous work on variable selection for linear regression models
with high-dimensional responses within the framework of pena-
lized least squares (Vounou et al., 2010, 2012). An analogous
Bayesian approach could also be developed, for instance, by ex-
tending the Bayesian RRR model proposed by Geweke (1996).
The original model was not suitable for settings in which the
sample size is much smaller than the number of variables, and
the regression coefﬁcients were assigned improper and ﬂat priors,
while the prior distribution of the covariance of random errors
was assumed to be an inverse-Wishart. Variable selection could
be obtained through double-exponential priors (Park and
Casella, 2008), and prior information regarding the pairwise re-
lationships between predictors and responses could be leveraged
by means of Markov random ﬁelds priors (Stingo et al., 2011).
A Bayesian counterpart of the NsRRR would constitute future
work.

Finally, it should be noted that the proposed model can be
applied to a broader range of applied problems involving the
search for association between two high-dimensional measure-
ments observed on the same random sample, including the de-
tection of expression quantitative trait loci.

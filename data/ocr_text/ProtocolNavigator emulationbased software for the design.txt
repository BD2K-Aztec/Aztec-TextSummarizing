ABSTRACT

Motivation: Experimental reproducibility is fundamental to the pro-
gress of science. Irreproducible research decreases the efficiency of
basic biological research and drug discovery and impedes experimen-
tal data reuse. A major contributing factor to irreproducibility is diffi-
culty in interpreting complex experimental methodologies and designs
from written text and in assessing variations among different experi-
ments. Current bioinformatics initiatives either are focused on compu-
tational research reproducibility (i.e. data analysis) or laboratory
information management systems. Here, we present a software tool,
ProtocolNavigator, which addresses the largely overlooked challenges
of interpretation and assessment. It provides a biologist-friendly open-
source emulation-based tool for designing, documenting and reprodu-
cing biological experiments.

Availability and implementation: ProtocolNavigator was imple-
mented in Python 2.7, using the WX module to build the graphical
user interface. It is a platform-independent software and freely avail-
able from http://protocoInavigator.org/index.html under the GPL v2
license.

1 BACKGROUND

Reproducibility is a fundamental tenet for all scientiﬁc endeav-
our that ensures the credibility of ﬁndings. It is particularly im-
portant for data serving as the basis for the development of
therapeutics, an extremely costly process. Recent studies show
an alarming increase of irreproducible biological research
(Begley and Ellis, 2012) and decrease of biological data reuse
(Editorial, 2011).

Prominent reproducibility initiatives in bioinformatics are
focused either on Taverna-like Molstencroft et al., 2013) ‘data
analysis’ centric computational research or laboratory informa-
tion management systems like ‘data curation-management’ infra-
structures (Rocca—Serra et al., 2010). Much less emphasis has
been given to facilitating the capture, interpretation and identi-
ﬁcation of methodology variation of biological research

(Editorial, 2013). For “long tail’ biologists ONallis et al., 2013),
where the majority of biological experiments are undertaken, the
practice variation (how individual researchers have executed the
method) among experimentalists remains idiosyncratic and
changes frequently. In the absence of a well-structured method-
ology or standard operating procedure, the design of an experi-
ment is crucial for interpretation and identiﬁcation of variability.
Therefore, illustrating the design in an understandable and ﬂex-
ible manner is critical when addressing the challenges of repro-
ducibility (Millard et al., 2011). However, the experimental
design is an abstract representation of the strategies undertaken,
and at present, is conveyed by written narratives or interpersonal
conversations. Both these approaches are unreliable, as they
depend on a shared language, overlapping experiences and align-
ment of mental models (Eriksson and Webster, 2008).

2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Addressing these challenges, here we introduce
ProtocolNavigator. Centred on cell biology research, this soft-
ware provides an interactive environment where experimentalists
can emulate their laboratory practice on a virtual laboratory
bench. As a result of “acting out’ the experiment, the design of
the experiment is automatically depicted onto a canvas as a map
with action icons and tracks for navigation. It is thus more read-
ily adopted than software designed to simply capture metadata,
which requires ﬁlling in forms or building workﬁows, and yet
provides no immediate understanding about the experimental
design and sample handling processes.

ProtocolNavigator consists of three panels with linked func-
tionality and display. Using the Inventory panel, the user creates
an ‘inventory’ of instances with detailed descriptions of items
such as instrumentation, materials and reagents. Importantly,
this inventory can be reused, adapted and shared. Using the
Bench panel (similar to a laboratory workbench), the previously
created instances from the inventory are applied to different ex-
perimental samples at certain time points. The time-integrated
action-based documentation approach in ProtocolNavigator is
unique in enabling researchers to capture their real-life labora-
tory practice (e. g. temporal variation of activity). The Map panel
automatically depicts the practice map or design of the experi-
ment, with spatiotemporally linked set of branches and activity
icons for retrieving both action details and experiment-derived
data. The linking of laboratory practice with actual experimental

data on a jargon-independent map inherently provides a good
foundation for different disciplines to communicate and identify
experimental design and the underlying practice variation—an
essential requirement for reproducibility.

Importantly, the fully navigable map can be shared with col-
leagues and, therefore, introduces a unique capacity for in silico
collaborative and coordinated experimental design optimization
and planning, potentially reducing experiment iterations and
associated costs. The map can be converted and printed into a
time-stamped sequential description of steps suitable for carrying
out the procedure at the physical bench or for publication. The
data ﬁle underpinning the map can be easily parsed and
reformatted.

3 CASE STU DY

3.1 Measurement of nanoparticle redistribution in a
proliferating tumour population - establishing the
principle of a ‘conserved signal’

The researchers’ goal is to establish the appropriate experimental
designs to determine how a biophotonics signal from the nano-
particles is diluted over time as a tumour population proliferates.
Two alternate protocols were designed using ProtocolNavigator
and discussed among the interdisciplinary research team.

In design terms, the ﬁrst approach (Fig. 1A) achieves a time
course for the tumour cultures achieved by seeding the cells at
staggered time points (on sequential days), and labelling each
population with nanoparticles 24h post seeding. Thus, all the
samples are delivered on the same day for ﬁnal measurement

Fig. 1. ProtocolNavigator screenshot showing two alternate experimental
designs for the labelling and tracking of tumour systems. Staggered seed-
ing (A) versus Continuous sampling (B). (A) Cells were seeded (stock
culture ﬂask icon) and then labelled (paint icon) with ﬂuorescently
labelled nanoparticles, including a corresponding unlabelled control.
The biology and cell labelling are both established in a staggered
manner. Cell seeding and labelling was done in a paired fashion at
0—23.59 h; 24—47.59 h; 48—7159 h; 72—9559 h, followed by wash (water
droplet icon) to remove the remnant labels from the medium. Flow cyt-
ometer data acquisition (laser icon) was performed for all eight vessels
(tubes) on the 5th day, i.e. at 120 h. (B) Here, cells were seeded in all eight
vessels at time Oh and then labelled with nanoparticles (four vessels;
23.59h later) again with corresponding unlabelled control (four vessels).
Thereafter, data acquisition was performed on vessels (one from ﬂuores-
cently labelled and one from control) 48, 72, 96 and l20h post seeding.
For both scenarios ‘A’ and ‘B’, eight ﬂow cytometer FCS ﬁles were
acquired of cells exposed to nanoparticles and control for varying num-
bers of days. Experiments are available in Supplementary Information for
download and navigation through ProtocolNavigator

using a ﬂow cytometer. The second approach (Fig. 1B) uses a
continuous sampling approach, where cells are seeded identically
in different vessels at the single time point and the cultures are
labelled and processed for measurement using ﬂow cytometry on
ﬁve subsequent days. In both cases, the cell culture is sampled
after 2, 3, 4 and 5 days of growth and, in both cases, the biologist
is able to adequately monitor the growth parameters of the cul-
tures as well as the attenuation of nanoparticle signals (ﬂuores-
cence per cell). The staggered approach is classically used when
the perturbing agent to be added is a small molecule or ‘drug’,
where uptake by the cell is assumed to be invariant each time. It
might also be preferred if it is important for data acquisition to
occur on the same day for convenience or to ensure control of
instrument performance.

However, from a nanoparticle perspective there is a funda-
mental ﬁaw in the staggered design: the uptake of ‘particulates’
by cell is innately variable (Summers et al., 2011), and as a result,
the effective cellular labelling is not uniform. This presents un-
predictability of the initial nanoparticle uptake per cell, and thus
the starting signal, leading to a misinterpretation of the conse-
quential signal processing and implementation of the ‘conserved
signal’ principle. Thus, a continuous sampling approach (Fig.
1B) was chosen, so that the computational researchers could
apply this signal conservation principle. The experiment was con-
ducted following the designed protocol, the resulting ﬂow cyto-
metry data (FCS ﬁles) was linked to the map, and the map and
data were shared with the computational members of the team
for successful analysis.

This experience conﬁrmed that for the computational re-
searchers to easily interpret and use these experiment-derived
data, visual perception and understanding of the experimental
design and provenance information was critical. For example,
understanding the crucial differences between the arrow-
marked datasets (derived after 3 days of nanoparticle labelling
in both experimental designs) was more apparent with visual
representation compared with only a narrative text-based de-
scription of the experimental metadata.

4 CONCLUSION

Although ProtocolNavigator has been primarily developed for
basic cell-based research, new instruments or materials can be
added as per prospective users’ demand. Importantly, the emu-
lation-based documentation and automatic design depiction con-
cept introduced here is applicable across many research
environments where practice, design and interdisciplinary com-
munication are serious concerns (e.g. clinical trials or animal
studies). By linking practice variation with experimental data,
ProtocolNavigator not only introduces an intuitive mechanism
for identifying key factors for reproducibility but also the foun-
dation to convey best practices in quantitative terms.

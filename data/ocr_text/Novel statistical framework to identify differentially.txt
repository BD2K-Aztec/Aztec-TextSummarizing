ABSTRACT

Motivation: Tests of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from
microarray experiments are based on the null hypothesis that genes
that are irrelevant to the phenotype/stimulus are expressed equally
in the target and control samples. However, this strict hypothesis is
not always true, as there can be several transcriptomic background
differences between target and control samples, including different
cell/tissue types, different cell cycle stages and different biological
donors. These differences lead to increased false positives, which
have little biological/medical significance.

Result: In this article, we propose a statistical framework to
identify DEGs between target and control samples from expression
microarray data allowing transcriptomic background differences
between these samples by introducing a modified null hypothesis
that the gene expression background difference is normally
distributed. We use an iterative procedure to perform robust
estimation of the null hypothesis and identify DEGs as outliers.
We evaluated our method using our own triplicate microarray
experiment, followed by validations with reverse transcription—
polymerase chain reaction (RT—PCR) and on the MicroArray Quality
Control dataset. The evaluations suggest that our technique (i) results
in less false positive and false negative results, as measured by the
degree of agreement with RT—PCR of the same samples, (ii) can
be applied to different microarray platforms and results in better
reproducibility as measured by the degree of DEG identification
concordance both intra- and inter-platforms and (iii) can be applied
efficiently with only a few microarray replicates. Based on these
evaluations, we propose that this method not only identifies more
reliable and biologically/medically significant DEG, but also reduces
the power-cost tradeoff problem in the microarray field.

1 INTRODUCTION

Microarray technology is widely used for gene expression analysis
of biological samples that undergo different treatments or represent
different phenotypic groups. The treated sample or the group of
interest is called the ‘target’, and the other sample/ group is called the
‘control’. One of the most important usages of such an experimental
design is to identify genes that are differentially expressed between
target and control. This is usually achieved by statistical tests using
biological replicates (replicates using different biological cases) and
technical replicates (replicates of a single case on multiple arrays)
(Allison et al., 2006).

Usually t—test or analysis of variance on the equality of mean
microarray gene expression measurement between the target group
and the control group are employed to identify differentially
expressed gene (DEG) (Cui et al., 2003). Fold change (FC) method
is also used as a simple and empirical alternative. More sophisticated
tests, such as shrinkage methods (Budhraja et al., 2003; Cui et al.,
2005; Smyth et al., 2005; Tusher et al., 2001) are available and
possess greater power. All of these methods are based on the null
hypothesis that genes that are irrelevant to the phenotype/stimulus
are expressed equally in the target and control samples. However,
this strict hypothesis is not always true, as there can be several
transcriptomic background differences between target and control,
including different cell/tissue types, different cell cycle stages and
different biological donors. These differences lead to increased
false positives, which have no biological/medical signiﬁcance, when
traditional statistical tests are employed. For example, when the
sample size is large, the testing of gene expression differences
between brain tissue samples and blood samples will identify most
genes as DEG. Following the traditional framework investigators
will also exhaust their ﬁnancial resources to maximize the sample
size in order to gain greater power for the identiﬁcation of smaller
gene expression differences (Allison et al., 2006). However, the
small differences they seek may be simply explained by the
aforementioned transcriptomic background differences, which are
irrelevant to the phenotype or stimulus of interest.

To overcome the problems that can be encountered when using
the traditional statistical testing framework, we propose a new
approach to identify DEG in the presence of different transcriptomic
backgrounds. We extend and broaden the traditional null hypothesis
of no difference to normal distributed differences and identify

DEG as outliers of the null hypothesis distribution. Interestingly,
this extended/broadened null hypothesis can be tested easily and
efﬁciently with few replicates. We evaluated our method using our
own triplicate microarray experiment, which was further validated
by reverse transcription—polymerase chain reaction (RT—PCR) and
on the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) dataset (Shi 61 611.,
2006). This evaluation suggests that our method (i) results in fewer
false positives and false negatives, as measured by the degree of
RT—PCR concordance, (ii) can be applied to different microarray
platforms and results in better reproducibility as measured by DEG
identiﬁcation concordance both within and between platforms and
(iii) can be applied efﬁciently with few microarray replicates. Based
on these evaluations, we hypothesize that the proposed method not
only identiﬁes more reliable and biologically/medically signiﬁcant
DEG but also reduces the power—cost tradeoff problem in the
microarray ﬁeld.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Cell culture

A human gastric cancer cell line, KATO—III, which was maintained as
described previously (Ling et 611., 2007), was used in these experiments.
Antibiotic and antimycotic drugs were not used in culture in order to avoid
their possible effects on gene expression. Cells in the logarithmic growth
phase were used. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured by standard
methods for 3 days after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA—P;
Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA).

2.2 RNA preparation

Total cellular RNA was extracted from cultured cells using IsoGen (Nippon
gene, Toyama, Japan), which is an acid guanidinium thiocyanate—phenol—
chloroform method, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
cells were suspended in 400 ul IsoGen lysis buffer at room temperature,
mixed with 80 ul chloroform and precipitated in isopropanol with 20 ug
glycogen (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The RNA pellet was resuspended
in RNase—free water, and the concentration of RNA was measured by a
spectrophotometer (GeneQuant pro, Biochrom Ltd, Cambridge, UK). Five
micrograms of RNA were treated with 5 U of RNase—free DNase I (TaKaRa
Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan) for 30 min for the removal of DNA contamination. To
conﬁrm the absence of residual DNA, the RNA samples were subjected to
degenerate oligonucleotide primed—PCR ampliﬁcation, as described below.
As a result, no PCR product was detected in the samples that were examined.
After phenol extraction and precipitation in isopropanol, the pellet was
resuspended in 10 ul of RNase—free water.

2.3 RNA ampliﬁcation with T7 RNA polymerase

To initiate ﬁrst strand cDNA synthesis, 1 ul of 100 pmole/ul
oligo(dT)24—T7 primer (TaKaRa) (5/—pGGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGA
CTCACTATAGGGAGGCGGTTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTTTTT—3/) was
added to 10 ul of a solution containing 5 ug total RNA. The solution was
then incubated at 65°C for 10min, chilled on ice and equilibrated at room
temperature for 10min. Then, the ﬁrst and second cDNA strands were
synthesized as described previously (Luo 61611., 1999; Kan 61611., 2001) with
a modiﬁcation of the incubation temperature from 42°C to 37°C during ﬁrst
strand synthesis. After phenol/chlorofonn extraction, the aqueous layer was
collected and puriﬁed by isopropanol precipitation two times. The pellet
was then resuspended in 8 ul of RNase—free water. The MEGAscript in vitro
Transcription Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) was used for cRNA production
with T7 RNA polymerase. After the addition of 211.1 of 10x reaction
buffer, 2 ul each of 100 mM adenosine triphosphate, cytidine triphosphate,
guanosine triohosphte and uridine triphosphate and 2 ul T7 RNA polymerase

to 8 ul of cDNA, the solution was incubated at 37°C for 5 h. Then, 1 ul of
RNase—free DNase I was added, and the solution was incubated at 37°C for
15 min. After mixing with 400 ul IsoGen lysis buffer at room temperature,
chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation were performed. The
cRNA pellet was then resuspended in 50 ul of RNase—free water.

2.4 Microarray analysis

The Human Cancer Chip Version 4.0 microarray (IntelliGene, TaKaRa)
was used. This array is spotted with 886 cDNA fragments from
human genes, including 588 that have been identiﬁed as cancer
related. A complete list of the genes is available on the TaKaRa web
site (http://bio.takara.co.jp/catalog/Catalog_d.asp?C_ID=C1219). cDNA
microarray analysis with an array scanner (Affymetrix 428; Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA, USA) and ImaGene 5.0 software (BioDiscovery, El
Segundo, CA, USA) was carried out as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Brieﬂy, the probe was T7 ampliﬁed and cRNA labeled in the same way as in
Ling’s protocol (Ling etal., 2007). Hybridization and washes were performed
as previously described (Kan et 611., 2001) with some modiﬁcations.
After heat denaturation, the probe was cooled at room temperature. Each
post—hybridization wash was performed for 5min. Expression proﬁling
that incorporated dye swapped, with Cy5—labeled test cDNA and Cy3—
labled reference cDNA, was used to check for non—speciﬁc reactions. The
microarray analyses with normal labeling and dye swapped were each
performed in triplicate. We adopted the global normalization by ImaGene.
Up— and downregulation in array spots were deﬁned by the T/R>2.0 and
<05, provided that signal counts of T (Cy3) and R (Cy5) were >500.

2.5 RT—PCR analyses

All signiﬁcantly DEGs and many randomly selected unchanged genes
identiﬁed by Takara’s build—in fold change method are validated (totally
278 genes) by quantitative RT—PCR with a LightCycler (Roche Applied
Science, Mannheim, Germany) using cDNA that was prepared from mRNA
for microarray analysis. The primers were designed based upon the
sequence described in the Human Organized Whole Genome Database
(http://howdy.jst.go.jp). We treat the rest of 886 genes as non—DEGs in
subsequent data analysis.

2.6 MAQC dataset preprocessing

The MAQC dataset is a benchmark of several commonly used microarray
platforms. Normalized data from ﬁve high—throughput platforms mentioned
on the MAQC ofﬁcial web site (Yang etal., 2002) were downloaded. These
platforms include ABI (Applied Biosystems, 5791 Van Allen Way Carlsbad,
CA 92008, USA), AFX (Affymetrix, 3420 Central Expressway Santa Clara,
CA 95051, USA), AG1 (Agilent Technologies, one color, 395 Page Mill
Road, 94303 Palo Alto, CA, USA), GEH (GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ
08540, USA) and ILM (Illumina, 9865 Towne Centre Dr, San Diego, CA
92121—1975, USA). The National Cancer Institute platform was not included
for two main reasons: (i) a reproducibility that is known to be signiﬁcantly
lower than that of other platforms; and (ii) the observed signal truncation,
in which the signal above 3.7e4 is truncated as 3.7e4, is problematic, since
many of the signals are above the truncation threshold. For every platform,
there were three test sites with ﬁve technical replicates each. Missing data
and negative values were replaced by the mean value of the within group
signal.

2.7 Signal normalization and variance stabilization
transformation

There are many issues with signal normalization across multiple arrays

(Bolstad et 611., 2003; Quackenbush et 611., 2002; Yang et 611., 2002). In this

study, quantile normalization, which forces the signal of every chip to be

equal at every quantile point (Bolstad et 611., 2003) was selected as it is

superior to other known methods (Bolstad etal., 2003).

Statistical framework to identify DEG genes

 

Plenty of methods have been proposed as the best way to stabilize signal
variance when technical replicates are used (Huber et 611., 2002; 2003;
Motakis et 611., 2006). Here, the Box—Cox power transformation, which is
based upon the observation of the within group signal—variance plot, was
used. The log—scaled signal, sg, and the corresponding within group variance,
vg, across genes support a desired linear regression model, lnvg = 611mg + b.
As Cox—Box power transformation takes the form of s; = (5"; — 1)/k. And
k = (2 —61)/2 can be determined from the estimated linear regression model.
Since k is a tuning parameter that characterizes the signal—variance response
of a particular microarray platform, it can also be estimated from published
data of the same type of microarray before the experiment. This ‘signal’ is
referred to as the quantile normalized and variance stabilized, transformed
signal in the later context.

2.8 Identifying DEG

As previously mentioned, under the null hypothesis, the difference in the gene
signal of the g—th gene between target and control samples is modeled as (1g ~
N (0,03), and the variance—stabilized sample mean signal difference of the g—
th gene between target and control samples is modeled as (1;, ~N(dg, 012).
Such a hierarchical null model has a simple one parameter marginal
distribution (1;, ~N(0, 03 +0?) =N(0, 02), which eases the corresponding
inference and signiﬁcance testing.

The real distribution of (1;, across genes is a mixture of genes under the
null hypothesis (non—DEG) and genes under alternative hypotheses (DEG).
To estimate the scale parameter 0 of the normal distribution under the null
hypothesis in the presence of pollution (DEG), robust estimators have to be
employed. When the number of genes is large (>5000), the median absolute
deviation (MAD; 37% Gaussian asymptotic efﬁciency) estimator is used
for speed, and, when the number of genes is not large (<5000), the Qn
(82% Gaussian asymptotic efﬁciency) estimator (Kan et 611., 2001) is used
for efﬁciency. After that estimation, the Z test is used to calculate the raw
signiﬁcance (P—value) of each gene, and the FDR procedure (Benjamini etal.,
1995) is performed as a ﬁnal multiple testing correction.

The distribution of (1;, using our own three replicates is shown in Figure 2.
The center peak of the distribution is mainly contributed by the genes under
the null hypothesis, while the outliers of the distribution are contributed by
DEG. An intuitive description for our method is that the center peak is ﬁtted
with a zero—centered normal distribution with outliers (DEG) detected using
the estimated normal distribution.

It is worth to mention that the asymptotic statistical power
P~1/e2 = 1/(e§+012)=1/(e§+ef_1/N), where 012_1 is the measuring
variance/error when one sample is used and N represents the sample
size and ~ means ‘in proportion to’. If the term 03 is not small then
increasing/decreasing N does not increase/decrease the power signiﬁcantly
due to the mathematical property of the above sample size power function.
Thus, our method is efﬁcient in the case of small sample size as P ~1/(og +
012_1),N = 1. We also reduce the power—cost tradeoff problem in microarray
ﬁeld by arguing that large sample size will be a waste as P ~1/og, N 2 00.

We summarize our procedure as follows:

(1) Quantile normalization of multiple chips signal.

(2) Perform variance stabilization transformation.

(3) Calculate average target—control signal difference.

(4) Robust estimation of the total variance by MAD or Qn.
(5) Access raw signiﬁcance by Z test.

(6) Perform false discovery rate multiple testing correction.

2.9 The triplicate dataset

This experiment included one pair of samples with three technical replicates.
Each replicate contained a two—color microarray and a dye—swapped, two—
color microarray. To minimize the potential dye bias problem, we ﬁrst
averaged the signal of the two dyes from each replicate on a log scale.

Quantile normalization was then used to normalize the signal of the three
replicates.

To estimate the parameters of the Cox—Box power transformation (Box
et 611., 1964) that was mentioned in the method part, a regression of the
log—transformed signal variance against the log—transfonned signal mean
that was estimated from the three technical replicates was performed. The
simple linear regression model ﬁt the data well (Fig. 1). Seventy—two percent
of the log—scaled estimated variance could be explained by the regression
model. The estimated regression model was lnvg = 2.4821nsg —7.142, thus
the Cox—Box transformation that was used was sg, =(sg_0'241 — 1)/ —0.241.
In addition, we also performed Kolmogorov—Smimov normality test of
the differences of non—DEG signal strength (N = 800, P—value=0.053),
indicating that our core hypothesis approximately holds.

Our result was ﬁrst compared with commonly used methods with three
replicates, using RT—PCR as the gold standard. Fold change is a widely used
method for the identiﬁcation of DEG. The criterion used here was an at least
2—fold difference between target and control samples, using Takara’s build—in
procedure which perform background subtraction ﬁrst and then calculate fold
changes. The t—test (Microsoft Excel, unequal variance) was performed on
both untransformed data and variance—stabilization transformed (VST) data.
Each method was tested using two FDR cutoffs, which were 0.05 and 0.1.
The results of this comparison are shown in Table 1. The fold change method
performed poorly, as demonstrated by a 45.8% false positive rate and 60.5%
statistical power. The t—test on the original data showed very low power
with >50% false positives, while the t—test on the variance—stabilized data
performed slightly better. Although it had a higher statistical power, more
than half of its positive ﬁndings were not of sufﬁcient size and were not
conﬁrmed by RT—PCR. Our method shows the best balance between false

positives and false negatives, as demonstrated by a false positive rate around

We also evaluated our method using both two replicates and one replicate
(Tables 2 and 3, respectively). When two replicates were used, the statistical
power remained around 80%, which is acceptable. When only one replicate
was used, the power was around 70%, but the variation was large. These
observations suggest that our method can be used when few replicates
are performed or are possible. In this situation, one replicate can be tried,
two replicates will be acceptable and three replicates will be better (see
Supplementary Material for details).

2.10 The MAQC dataset

The MAQC dataset was used to evaluate the portability of our method to
other microarray platforms and the reproducibility of DEG identiﬁcation
on both an intra— and inter—platform basis. Reproducibility was deﬁned as
the percent overlap of genes on the DEG list for test site Y that were
also present on the DEG list for test site X. For the ease of reading, the
site—to—site reproducibility was summarized with the platfonn—to—platform
reproducibility by arithmetical averaging corresponding site—to—site pairs.

A comparison of the reproducibility of the t—test used by the MAQC paper
(Shi etal., 2006) and our method revealed that reproducibility is positively
correlated with the size of the DEG list. An intuitive example is that, when all
the genes in both platforms are DEG, the reproducibility will reach 100%.
To make the comparison fair, the DEG signiﬁcance threshold of the two
methods was adjusted to produce approximately the same number of DEGs.
Two comparisons were carried out: (i) DEG identiﬁed by the MAQC paper
using a t—test with P < 0.001 and FC > 2, which indicated that P < 0.3 should
be used with our method to generate a similar number of DEG; and (ii) DEG
identiﬁed by our method using P < 0.05, suggesting that the t—test should
use P <5e—9.

The reproducibility of our method and the t—test are shown in Tables 4—7.
When the size of the DEG list is large (36% of total genes), the reproducibility
of both the t—test and our method are high (most platform pairs >70%) and
our results (average reproducibility = 78.7%) are slightly more reproducible
than that of the t—test (average reproducibility=77.4%). When a stricter
threshold is applied with a reduced number of DEGs (17% of total
genes) the situation changes. Our method results in a signiﬁcantly more
reproducible DEG (average reproducibility = 72.8%) than that with the t—test
(average reproducibility = 59.5%). In addition, our method demonstrated its
robustness of reproducibility against threshold changes. These observations
lead to the conclusion that our method is portable among different platforms
and results in higher reproducibility than that of the t—test intra— and
inter—platforms.

3 DISCUSSION

In this article, we present a statistical framework to identify DEGs
from microarray experiments in the presence of transcriptomic
background differences between target and control samples.
We evaluate its performance by our own triplicate microarray
experiment followed by RT—PCR validation and a comparison
with the MAQC dataset on multiple microarray platforms. Our
method can reduce both false positive and false negative (in
biological/medical sense) results and can be applied effectively with
fewer replicates compared with other methods. The technique is also
portable across different microarray platforms. Its reproducibility is
not only higher than the traditional t—test, but is also robust, since
it is not greatly affected by the signiﬁcance cutoff threshold. This
method brings new insight to the signiﬁcance of DEGs and may
provide supporting evidence for those DEGs that would be accepted
by more biomedical investigators.

The deﬁnition of statistical signiﬁcance depends on how the
null hypothesis is deﬁned. Currently, most methods deﬁne the
null hypotheses as dg =0 and develop a corresponding testing
framework. This null hypothesis, however, is too idealistic and
sensitive if its biological meaning is seriously considered. In reality,
cells or biological tissues can never be exactly the same, especially
after undergoing different treatments: (i) suppose we have highly
matched cells lines, and the cell expression network changed as a
whole after the treatment. We can image that expression level goes
up and down across different genes, but only those leading genes
indicated by obvious response to the treatment is of our interest while
the rest result from background expression differences; (ii) many
experimental designs are not so perfect that they compare different
cells at different time points, different tissues and different status
(e. g. cancer and nearby tissue). Another example is the benchmark

datasets created by MAQC consortium compares human universal
RNA against human brain RNA. Slight variations in dg around zero
should be allowed, otherwise the null hypothesis will be always
rejected when the sample size is large enough, which would result
in many meaningless positive ﬁndings. Therefore, in this article, the
null hypothesis was loosened to become more realistic and robust,
as indicated by dg ~N(0, 0(2)).

The marginal distribution of the sample—averaged target—control
difference was still normally distributed, even with the addition

of the unknown variance 0%. Given that the number of genes in

microarray experiment is usually large, the overall variance ozcan

be estimated using the transcriptome—wide distribution of dé. The

robust estimators MAD or Qn were selected to estimate 03 in the
presence of DEG pollution. Although MAD is easy and quick to
calculate, it has a low Gaussian efﬁciency (37 %). On the other
hand, the Qn calculation is computationally slow but has a high
Gaussian efﬁciency (82%) (Croux et 611., 1992). Both MAD and Qn
have the maximum 50% breakdown point, at which their maximum
robustness is indicated.

Our method assumes that the mean target—control difference of the
g—th gene is distributed as 61 g, ~N (dg, 012). In order to ensure that this
assumption can be approximately held, the signal should be properly
normalized and transformed. In this article, quantile normalization
and the Box—Cox power transformation were selected. Extensive
comparison between these two methods and other methods was not
performed, since they work well enough on our dataset (Fig. 1).

The RT—PCR signiﬁcance cutoff was set to a 2—fold change, which
is consistent with that used by the fold change methods. This cutoff
is arbitrary but generally acceptable by biomedical investigators.
The high degree of concordance of our results with those obtained
in the RT—PCR analyses suggests that the DEGs identiﬁed by high—
throughput microarray experiments using our method can be trusted
and applied to other situations with little risk.

Our ﬁndings demonstrate that the reproducibility/portability of
our method is higher than that of t—test. This is because t—test
requires estimation of individual gene variance which is inaccurate
and unstable in small sample size, thus its reproducibility is limited.
On the contrary, our method estimates one common variance
(contributed by both background variance and measuring variance)
across thousands of genes and thus is more stable and reproducible.

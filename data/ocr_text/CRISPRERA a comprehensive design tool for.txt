Abstract

Summary: The CRISPR/CasQ system was recently developed as a powerful and flexible technology
for targeted genome engineering, including genome editing (altering the genetic sequence) and
gene regulation (without altering the genetic sequence). These applications require the design of
single guide RNAs (ngNAs) that are efficient and specific. However, this remains challenging, as it
requires the consideration of many criteria. Several ngNA design tools have been developed for
gene editing, but currently there is no tool for the design of ngNAs for gene regulation. With accu—
mulating experimental data on the use of CRISPR/CasQ for gene editing and regulation, we imple—
ment a comprehensive computational tool based on a set of ngNA design rules summarized from
these published reports. We report a genome—wide ngNA design tool and provide an online web—
site for predicting ngNAs that are efficient and specific. We name the tool CRISPR—ERA, for clus—
tered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat—mediated gditing, repression, and activation

(ERA).

1 Introduction

The bacterial adaptive immune system, CRISPR (clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats), was recently developed as a
powerful and multi—purpose technology for genome engineering,
including editing (modifying the genomic sequence) (Cong et 61].,
2013; Mali et 61]., 2013), and regulation (repressing or activating eX—
pression of genes) (Gilbert et 61]., 2013, 2014; Qi et 61]., 2013). The
system is highly programmable, utilizing a single protein, the nucle-
ase Cas9 for editing or the nuclease—deficient dCas9 for regulation.
A single guide RNA (ngNA) is required for precise and program—
mable DNA targeting (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014). Effective

and specific genome engineering requires careful design of ngNAs,
which remains a major challenge. Computational tools have been
used to facilitate the design of ngNAs for CRISPR editing but not
for other applications such as transcriptional regulation. These com—
putational tools should enable automated ngNA design and off—
target site validation (Bae et 61]., 2014; Doench et 61]., 2014; Heigwer
et 61]., 2014; O’Brien and Bailey, 2014; Xiao et al., 2014). A major
goal of our designer tool is to address the discrepancy for designing
ngNAs that allow efficient and highly specific repression or activa—
tion of genes and for generating genome—wide ngNA libraries for
genetic screening in different organisms.

Fig. 1. CRISPR-ERA workflow and example. The CRISPR-ERA algorithm takes input information, including types of genome manipulation, organism, and gene
name or genome location, and then computes and evaluates ngNAs within the targeted genome region. By default, for editing, the algorithm chooses ngNA
sequences within coding region; for repression, the algorithm computes ngNA binding sites within a 3kb region centered at TSS (or the sense strand of the 5’
end of the gene for bacteria only); for activation, the algorithm computes ngNA binding sites up to 1.5 kb upstream of TSS. In this figure, mouse gene Sox2 is
shown as an example. E, efficacy score; 8, specificity penalty score (Supplementary Methods)

Here, we describe CRISPR—ERA webserver, an automated and
comprehensive ngNA design tool for CRISPR—mediated editing,
repression, and gctivation (ERA) (Fig. 1). CRISPR-ERA utilizes a
fast algorithm to search for genome—wide ngNA binding sites and
evaluates their efficiency and specificity using a set of rules summar—
ized from published data for CRISPR editing, repression and activa—
tion (Cong et al., 2013; Doudna and Charpentier, 2014; Gilbert
et al., 2014; Qi et al., 2013; Ran et al., 2013). The design features
are annotated and the target sites can be visualized in a genome
browser. We also provide a local version for the generation of
whole—genome ngNA libraries.

2 Methods

For each target gene or genomic site, CRISPR—ERA first searches
all targetable sites in that particular organism for patterns of
NZONGG (N: any nucleotide). Each target sequence is then calcu—
lated for two scores (Supplementary Methods): (i) an efficacy score
(E—score) based on the sequence features such as GC content
(%GC), presence of poly—thymidine (which is a terminator for ef-
fective transcription of ngNAs), and location information such as
the distance from target gene transcriptional start sites (T55); and
(ii) a specificity score (S—score) based on the genome—wide off—target

binding sites. For each ngNA design, we compute the genome—
wide sequences that contain an adjacent NRG (R:A or G)
protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site and zero, one, two, or three
mismatches complementary to the ngNA using Bowtie (Langmead
et al., 2009), which are regarded as off—target binding sites. The
penalty score for NAG off—target is smaller than NGG off—target.
The ngNAs are finally ranked by the sum of E—score and S—score
(Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S1).

We implement a user—friendly web server (http://CRISPR—ERA.
stanford.edu) that hosts the web application for the ngNA designer
tool. The webserver will host a broad category of sequenced organ—
isms. Currently, it provides ngNA design service for nine most
commonly used prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms including
Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Drosopbila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio,
Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens, etc.
(Supplementary Table 81.). The web application enables rapid
searching in the pre—assembled ngNA database using an indexing
searching approach (Supplementary Methods). The program out—
puts the sequence, target location, off—target details of the possible
ngNAs, their E— and S—scores etc. Results can be visualized using
the UCSC genome browser to highlight the custom tracks
(Supplementary Fig. 82 and S3).

3 Conclusions

CRISPR—ERA enables easy, fast, and predictive design of ngNAs
for broad applications of CRISPR in genome editing, gene repres—
sion and activation. The tool can be applied to other types of
CRISPR applications such as genome imaging (Chen et al., 2013)
and CRISPR synthetic circuit design (Kiani et al., 2014), and ex—
panded to other organisms. We also provide the source code for the
generation of whole—genome ngNA libraries, useful for genome—
wide screening based on CRISPR, CRISPRi or CRISPRa (Gilbert
et al., 2014, Shalem et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013).

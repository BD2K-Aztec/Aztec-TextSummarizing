ABSTRACT

Summary: NetDS is a novel Cytoscape plugin that conveniently
simulates dynamics related to robustness, and examines structural
properties with respect to feedforward/feedback loops. It can
evaluate how robustly a network sustains a stable state against
mutations by employing a Boolean network model. In addition, the
plugin can examine all feedforward/feedback loops appearing in a
network and determine whether or not a pair of loops is coupled.
Random networks can also be generated to evaluate whether or
not an interesting finding in real biological networks is significantly
random.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) is a free open—source software
platform that is used to visualize complex networks. Many
Cytoscape plugins have been developed for structural analysis of
biological networks. For example, MCODE (Bader and Hogue,
2003), BiNoM (Zinovyev et al., 2008) and NeMo (Rivera et al.,
2010) were developed to search speciﬁc sub—structures in a network
including active parts or densely connected regions. Network—Motif—
Finder (Taylor et al., 2007) has also been employed to uncover
simple network motifs such as small—scale feedforward loops. The
motif search function was further extended in NetMatch (Ferro et al.,
2007) by enabling a user to query more ﬂexible forms of motifs.
Plugins to analyze the dynamics of a biological network also exist.
For example, PerturbationAnalyzer (Li et al., 2009) can evaluate
the propagation effect of perturbations on interaction networks by
computing changes in the equilibrium state. SimBoolNet (Zheng
et al., 2010) can examine the dynamics of a signaling transduction
pathway using a Boolean network.

However, there are no plugins that may be used to investigate the
relationships between the structural characteristics of networks and
network dynamics. Considering that the dynamical behavior of a
biological network is closely related to its structural characteristics
(Kremling et al., 2008; Kwon et al., 2007; Prill et al., 2005), there is a
pressing need to develop such plugins that can analyze relationships
between the structural characteristics and dynamics of a network.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In particular, recent studies indicate that the ability of a network to
sustain a stable state against mutations is greatly affected by complex
motifs such as feedback loops (FBLs) and feedforward loops (FFLs)
harbored by the network. For example, robust networks tend to have
a larger number of positive FBLs and a smaller number of negative
FBLs (Kwon and Cho, 2008b) The number of FBLs involving a
node is also positively correlated with the functional importance of
the node (Kwon et al., 2007), and the coherent coupling of FBLs
is a design principle of a robust cell signaling network (Kwon and
Cho 2008a). FFLs are needed for robust carbohydrate uptake in
Escherichia coli (Kremling et al., 2008). Inspired by those studies,
we have developed a plugin, NetDS, to analyze the structural
characteristics of biological networks with respect to FBLs or FFLs
and to compute dynamics related to robustness.

A random Boolean network (RBN) model is employed which
has been effectively used for investigating the complex dynamics
of biological networks (Kauffman et al., 2003; Kwon et al., 2007;
Shmulevich et al., 2003). In fact, SimBoolNet has already been
implemented in an RBN model to simulate the dynamics of signaling
transduction. More speciﬁcally, SimBoolNet observes the response
of downstream molecules simulated for a user—speciﬁed stimulus for
a signal receptor. However, it cannot provide any dynamics related to
attractors to which a network will converge since it simply provides
the time—series of changes of node values. As such, the robustness of
the network against perturbations cannot be calculated. To overcome
this limitation, NetDS was designed to analyze the converging state
of a network and its robustness against perturbations. In terms of
structural analysis, NetDS can analyze both the FBLs/FFLs that
appear in a network and detailed properties such as the sign of an
FBL, the signs of simple paths comprising an FFL, and the coherence
of coupled FBLs or FFLs. In addition, FBL/FFLs containing speciﬁc
nodes cannot be easily checked with existing plugins. Altogether,
NetDS provides a combined analysis of structural properties with
respect to FBL/FFLs and dynamics related to robustness.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 A Boolean network model

A Boolean network is represented with a directed graph G(V, A), where V
is a set of Boolean variables and A is a set of ordered pairs of the Boolean
variables called directed links. Each v,- e V has a value of 1 (‘on’) or 0 (‘off’)
which represents the possible states of the corresponding elements. A directed
link (vi, vj) has a positive (‘activating’) or negative (‘inhibiting’) relationship
from v,- to vj. The value of each variable v,- at time t+ 1 is determined by the
values of kl- other variables with a link to v,- at time t by the Boolean function
f,- : {0, l}ki —> {0, 1}; all variables are synchronously updated (See Supporting
Deﬁnitions in Supplementary Material for more details).

2.2 Robustness-related dynamics

In NetDS, we focus on converging dynamics and network robustness against
perturbations in terms of Boolean dynamics. Given a Boolean network
G(V, A) with V={v0,v1, ..., vN_1 }, a state of G is deﬁned as a vector of values
v0 through vN_1. A state trajectory starts from an initial state and eventually
converges to either a ﬁxed—point or limit—cycle attractor. These attractors
can represent diverse biological network behaviors such as multi—stability,
homeostasis and oscillation. Therefore, the change in the converging attractor
can be interpreted as a loss of robustness. Here, we considered two types of
perturbations: an initial—state perturbation and an update—rule perturbation.
We deﬁne the robustness of a node v,- against the initial—state perturbation and
the update—rule perturbation, denoted as ys(v,-) and yr(v,-), respectively. Based
on them, the robustness of a network G against the initial—state perturbation
and the update—rule perturbation, denoted as ys(G) and yr(G), respectively, is
calculated (See Supporting Deﬁnitions in Supplementary Material for more
details).

Unfortunately, it is very time—consuming to compute converging attractors
over all possible initial states. To reduce the computation time, we introduced
a more effective algorithm in NetDS by avoiding redundant computations
(See Supporting Pseudo—codes in Supplementary Material). Based on the
module used to compute the converging attractor, NetDS can calculate
ys(v), yr(v), ys(G), and yr(G) efﬁciently (See Supporting Pseudo—codes in
Supplementary Material).

2.3 Detection of FBLs and FFLs

In NetDS, a user can search FBLs and FFLs for a speciﬁed length (See
Supporting Deﬁnitions in Supplementary Material for more details). This
function was simply implemented using a breadth—ﬁrst search, which is a
kind of graph traversal method. For a dense large network, it will take a long
time to detect all FBLs and FFLs. Therefore, the maximum length of the
FFLs or FBLs should be speciﬁed as a constraint.

2.4 Generation of random Boolean networks

When a real biological network is loaded into Cytoscape, NetDS can
analyze the dynamics and FBL/EFL structures of the network. However,
extensive simulations over a number of random networks are needed to
determine whether or not some observations in the real biological network
are signiﬁcantly random. To this end, NetDS provides three random network
generation models: a Barabasi—Albert model (Barabasi and Albert, 1999),
a Erdos—Re’nyi model (Erdbsand Rényi, 1959) and a Erdos—Re’nyi variant
model (See Supporting Pseudo—codes in Supplementary Material).

3 APPLICATION EXAMPLE

NetDS shows the analysis results about robustness—related dynamics
and FBL/FFLs—related structures through individual control panels
in Cytoscape (Fig. 1). The efﬁciency of NetDS was demonstrated
through some case studies where the results of the previous studies
were validated by NetDS (See Supporting Results in Supplementary
Material for more details).

4 CONCLUSION

Many recent results have shown that robust behavior against
perturbations is closely related to structural properties with respect to
the FBL/FFLs in biological networks. In this regard, we developed a
novel Cytoscape plugin that can compute network robustness against
initial—state or update—rule perturbations and examine FBL/FFLs
harbored in a network. NetDS is the ﬁrst Cytoscape plugin
to investigate the relationships between dynamic and structural
properties in a network. In the future, NetDS will be extended to
include a variety of perturbation types and update—rules that can be
applied to dynamics analysis.

Fig. 1. A sample NetDS—based analysis on cell differentiation regulatory
network (Huang and Ingber, 2000). NetDS has two control panels. One is to
examine dynamical properties (ﬁnding attractors and calculating robustness)
and the other is to detect structural properties with respect to FBL and FFL.
A relationship between dynamical properties and structural properties can be
discovered.

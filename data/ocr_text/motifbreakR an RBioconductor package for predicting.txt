Abstract

Summary: Functional annotation represents a key step toward the understanding and interpret-
ation of germline and somatic variation as revealed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), respectively. GWAS have revealed numerous genetic risk
variants residing in non-coding DNA associated with complex diseases. For sequences that lie
within enhancers or promoters of transcription, it is not straightforward to assess the effects of
variants on likely transcription factor binding sites. Consequently we introduce motifbreakR, which
allows the biologist to judge whether the sequence surrounding a polymorphism or mutation is a
good match, and how much information is gained or lost in one allele of the polymorphism or mu-
tation relative to the other. MotifbreakR is flexible, giving a choice of algorithms for interrogation of
genomes with motifs from many public sources that users can choose from. MotifbreakR can pre-
dict effects for novel or previously described variants in public databases, making it suitable for
tasks beyond the scope of its original design. Lastly, it can be used to interrogate any genome cura-
ted within bioconductor.

1 Introduction

Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are typically short DNA
sequence motifs that facilitate binding of a specific transcription fac-
tors via protein—DNA interactions (Stormo, 2000). There are some
software tools that facilitate the scoring of non-coding variants with
respect to either predefined or user-specified motifs. RegulomeDB,
HaploReg and FunSeq each enable assessment of the effects of single
nucleotide variants on predicted binding sites (Boyle et al., 2012;
Khurana et al., 2013; Ward and Kellis, 2012). Each of these pack-
ages has strengths, but does not provide the analysis independent of
its other functions. Many users generate their own motifs, but users
are limited to built-in motif collections and functions. The functions

are largely unavailable to non-human data sets. We hereby intro-
duce an R/bioconductor software package called motifbreakR that
addresses these major concerns. Implementation in R has the advan-
tage of universality: R and bioconductor are widely used for bio-
informatics and well supported across different platforms including
Galaxy (Tenenbaum, 2015).

2 Features

2.1 Germline or somatic variants

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be generated from an-
other R package such as FunciSNP (Coetzee et al., 2012), or read in
directly from .bed or .vcf files. The SNPs then need to be converted

Fig. 1. Example of motifbreakR output from plotMB function for a previously
published SNP (Hazelett et al., 2014). Genomic sequence and coordinates are
at the bottom of the display; the positions of the matches represented (light
blue boxes). The position of the SNP within the motif is indicated with red
bounding box and alternate allele below, and as red text on the motif logo
position bar above. The motif logos generated from motifstack are shown
above using the color conventions of the genomic sequence below

to GRanges objects. This is accomplished within motifbreakR in
one of two ways, via the snps.from.rsid and snps.from.file functions.
MotifbreakR will produce a GRanges table with match statistics
describing the percent of maximum score for a matrix for both al-
leles of the SNP, the matrix values for each allele (useful for deter-
mining the severity of the disruption), the strand, whether the
disruption is strong or weak. The package also includes a plotting
function based on the gviz and motifstack packages as shown for
SNP 1310486567 in Figure 1.

2.2 Comprehensive positional weight matrices

Once a SNP list is converted to GRanges, selection of PWMs proceeds
by subsetting from the Motibe package or from one of the included
motifList-compatible libraries. Any motifList object can be passed to
motifbreakR. Motibe provides access to ScerTF (Spivak and
Stormo, 2012), FlyFactorSurvey (Zhu et al., 2011), hPDI (Xie et al.,
2010), all the selex-generated motifs from (Jolma et al., 2013),
UniPROBE (Newburger and Bulyk, 2009) and JASPAR (Stormo,
2000). In addition to these, we have included motifs from Encode
(Kheradpour and Kellis, 2014), Homer (Heinz et al., 2010),
Factorbook (Wang et al., 2012) and HOCOMOCO (Kulakovskiy et
al., 2013). Importantly, MotifbreakR generates pseudocounts based
on the number of observations listed for each motif in these databases,
but defaults to 20 observations when this information is lacking.

2.3 Choice of algorithms

There are three algorithms accessible via the ‘method’ argument.
The first is the standard sum of log probabilities (method: ‘log’).
The second and third are the weighted sum and information content
methods (method=‘default’ and method=‘ic’). The default was
previously described (Hazelett et al., 2014); the ic method is based
on relative entropy but renders very similar conclusions. The meth-
ods are extensively documented in the vignette. For all three meth-
ods, motifbreakR scores and reports the reference and alternate
alleles of the sequence, and the effect (strong, weak or neutral). The

match scores are scaled as a fraction of scoring range [0,1] of the
motif matrix.

2.4 Extensible to model organisms

It is straightforward within the motifbreakR package to specify any
of the research model organism genomes in BSgenome (currently 22
in number), including mouse, zebrafish, and fruit ﬂy. This may be
done both at the level of reading in SNP lists and during invocations
of motifbreakR. To our knowledge, no other software currently
offers this functionality.

3 Conclusion

In principle, a SNP label contains all the information necessary to
characterize a variant or mutation, since it points to information in
external databases somewhere. Our package makes it possible to
rapidly explore TFBS disruptions for a large number of SNPs within
the R framework, with no need to install third party software or
massage arcane output files for downstream analysis. Although the
intention is to study the relationship of human variation to disease,
use of motifbreakR is not limited to this application. Indeed, one
may access any genome in BSgenome, and query it with custom
SNPs and PWMs, or specify organism-specific sets of PWMs from
Motibe. motifbreakR uses a highly efficient information content-
based algorithm for discriminating between truly disruptive variants
versus neutral. Because motifbreakR is designed to work with the
existing bioconductor framework, we believe it to be the most flex-
ible and extensible package available for this type of analysis.

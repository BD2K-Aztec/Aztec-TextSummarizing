ABSTRACT

Motivation: The identification of cell cycle-regulated genes through
the cyclicity of messenger RNAs in genome-wide studies is a difficult
task due to the presence of internal and external noise in microarray
data. Moreover, the analysis is also complicated by the loss of syn-
chrony occurring in cell cycle experiments, which often results in add-
itional background noise.

Results: To overcome these problems, here we propose the LEON
(LEarning and OptimizatioN) algorithm, able to characterize the ‘cycli-
city degree’ of a gene expression time profile using a two-step cas-
cade procedure. The first step identifies a potentially cyclic behavior
by means of a Support Vector Machine trained with a reliable set of
positive and negative examples. The second step selects those genes
having peak timing consistency along two cell cycles by means of a
non-linear optimization technique using radial basis functions. To
prove the effectiveness of our combined approach, we use recently
published human fibroblasts cell cycle data and, performing in vivo
experiments, we demonstrate that our computational strategy is able
not only to confirm well-known cell cycle-regulated genes, but also to
predict not yet identiﬁed ones.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cell cycle progression is achieved by a highly regulated temporal
program of gene expression where transcription is coordinated in
a series of consecutive interdependent waves. Such ‘just-in-time’
strategy is suggested by the experimental observation that genes
are expressed at peak levels at the time they are needed (Breeden
et al., 2003). To study genes regulated in a cell cycle-dependent
manner, researchers have deeply used messenger RNA expres-
sion proﬁling microarrays of synchronously growing cells pro-
gressing through the cell cycle. Nevertheless, the genome-wide

identiﬁcation of cycling genes is a difﬁcult task for a number of
reasons, including cell synchronization loss and intrinsic micro-
array noise. The most critical experimental issue is the degree of
synchronization as well as its loss during a time course sampling.
This is the reason why various computational methods have been
proposed to correct such experimental artifact. The key problem is
that the loss of synchronization results in a ‘ﬂattening’ of the time
proﬁle due to the presence of cells in different stages of the cell
cycle. To overcome this problem, Bar-Joseph et al. (2008) have
recently developed a combined experimental and computational
approach to recover ‘true’ cell cycle expression proﬁles. A number
of different techniques have been proposed in the literature for the
identification of cycling genes in many organisms, all of them
relying on a cyclicity scores based on the degree of regulation
(magnitude) and/or on a shape parameter (Fourier analysis).
Unfortunately, there is a remarkably poor overlap between the
gene sets identiﬁed as cyclic in different experiments even for the
same organism (Zhao et al., 2001). Therefore, none of them can be
considered as the ‘best method’ and this ﬁeld is still an open area
of research.

Here, we provide a new tool to identify cycling transcripts by
integrating different features of gene expression time proﬁles. In
fact, the LEON (LEarning and OptimizatioN) algorithm com-
bines, in two separate steps, information contained in the ampli-
tude of the response (learning step) and information contained in
the shape of the response by considering the consistency of peak
timing between minima and maxima along two cell cycles (opti-
mization step). In particular, this last feature is suitable to over-
come the loss of synchronization problem, as peak timing of
upregulation or downregulation is not signiﬁcantly affected by
such artifact. In other words, the shape of the expression proﬁle
of the population of cells changes as a consequence of different cell
progress rate, but the up or down expression peak positions in
time remain approximately the same. This property is illustrated
in Figure 1 through the example used by Bar-Joseph et al. (2008)
where raw and deconvolved data display the same peak timing.
The authors hypothesize that cell progress rates are distributed as
a Gaussian with a mean of 1 (average time) and that observed
expression values result from a convolution with such Gaussian
kernel. Because the Gaussian kernel function is symmetric around
the mean, if a certain group of cells has a cell progress rate, say
1 — d, there is also a ‘symmetric’ group of cells having a progress
rate 1 + d. The total effect of these contributions leaves the

same position in time both in raw and deconvolved data

maxima points (and the minima points) in the same time

To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we used recently
published human ﬁbroblasts cell cycle data (Bar-Joseph et al.,
2008) and performed in vivo experiments to validate our compu-
tational predictions.

2 METHODS

The LEON algorithm identiﬁes cycling genes by a two-step procedure.
The ﬁrst step computes a suitably trained Support Vector Machine
(SVM) classiﬁer to decide whether a given proﬁle is cycling or not and,
accordingly, a binary cyclicity score of c = lor c = 0 is assigned. The
second step consists in an optimization-based approach, which identiﬁes
consistency of peak timing along two cell cycles and accordingly assigns
to each gene a cyclicity score p between 0 and 1. The SVM prediction and
the optimization procedure are then combined into a single overall score
pcomb characterizing the degree of cyclicity for each transcript.

2.1 First step: SVM classiﬁcation

The SVMs, ﬁrst described by Vapnik in the 90s Wapnik, 1998), have
been successfully applied to a large number of pattern recognition prob-
lems, including classiﬁcation of microarray data (Brown et al., 2000).
Each expression proﬁle vector with n time samples can be seen as a
point in an n-dimensional space. To separate in this space cycling genes
from non-cycling genes, the simplest approach is to consider a linear
decision boundary region (i.e. a hyperplane) that separates the two
given classes (positive and negative examples) in the original n-dimen—
sional space. In our case such simple rule is not satisfactory, as the ‘best’
hyperplane separating the two classes still misclassiﬁes a large number of
genes. Therefore, we adopted the common approach of mapping the
dataset into a higher dimensional space (the so-called feature space).

 

Fig. 2. Examples of SVM decision boundary regions. (A) linear and a3)
non-linear

This point is illustrated in Figure 2. Then, a reliable subset of cycling
and non-cycling genes was used as positive and negative examples for the
training set. On this basis, the ﬁrst step of LEON algorithm, classiﬁes all
genes as ‘cyclic’ or ‘not cyclic’ (see Fig. 3) using an SVM (see Section 3).

2.2 Second step: non-linear optimization-based gene
expression proﬁle analysis

Cyclicity of a time series can be characterized in many ways. A common
choice is the use of the ﬁrst Fourier coefﬁcient (Spellman et al., 1998), but
often the shape of a time series is different from a pure sinusoid.
Additionally, owing to the already mentioned synchronization loss, the
shape of the curve is also different between two subsequent cycles of the
same transcript.

Among the many possible alternatives, we selected a feature that is
independent from the overall shape and robust with respect to the loss of
synchronization problem (see Fig. 1), as previously described. Such fea-
ture is the distance in time dmin between two subsequent minima and the
distance dmax between two subsequent maxima (illustrated in Fig. 4).
Therefore, cell cycle time series having dmin and dmax near to the dupli-
cation time A, namely, the time needed by a cell to complete a cell div-
ision cycle obtained by ﬂow cytometry [Fluorescence-Activated Cell
Sorting (FACS)] analysis, are considered good candidates for being asso-
ciated to cycling genes.

Unfortunately, microarray time series are noisy and provide expression
values only at sampling times. To robustly evaluate peak times, data were
preprocessed to reduce noise and then values outside the range of sam-
pling times were extrapolated. By doing so, we could obtain a precise
estimation of times at which maxima or minima are attained.

Therefore, we needed an appropriate mathematical tool to get a
smooth continuous representation of the experimental data that enables
us to estimate unobserved time points. Radial basis functions (RBFs) are
tools to approximate functions by linear combinations of terms based on
a single univariate function (the RBF).

The use of RBFs is motivated by the fact that they have excellent ap-
proximation properties (as shown, 6. g. in Girosi and Poggio, 1990) and are
widely used also in the bioinformatics ﬁeld (Chen et al., 2011; Chiang and
Ho, 2008; Takasaki et al., 2006). They are usually applied to approximate
data that are only known at a limited number of points—as for the case of
microarray experiments—so that the approximating function can be eval-
uated often and efﬁciently. In fact, once the RBFs are generated, one can
resample the curve to estimate expression values at any time points.

The second step of LEON algorithm consists in the approximation and
resampling of (noisy) expression time proﬁles using a linear combination
of RBF. When estimating RBFs from expression data, we did not ﬁt each
time course individually. Owing to noise and missing values, such an
approach could lead to overﬁtting. Instead, we constrained the RBF co-
efﬁcients to have good smoothness (or regularity) properties (see Section
3.2) based on the same training set (golden standard genes) used for
SVM. Then, a cyclicity score 1) can be computed for each gene using a
non-linear optimization-based method to ﬁnd optimal parameter values
of the RBFs. That is, a set of optimal RBF parameters (the same for all

tionale behind this choice is to determine the set of parameters that best
represent the biological process under analysis. Then, for a given gene, we
calculated the RBF approximation and executed a cyclicity analysis to get
a score 1). Precisely, once the smoothed expression proﬁle is computed,
the cyclicity score 1) is deﬁned as follows:
_ mmax ‘I' mmin
_ 2
mmax :1_Idmax _ AI,
A

where dmax, dmin are, respectively, the distances in time between the two
maximum peaks and the two minimum peaks of the approximation curve
and A is the duplication period. A score value close to 1 indicates a high
consistency of peak timing and, therefore, a good indication of the pres-
ence of a cyclic behavior. To ﬁnd optimal parameters values, we evalu-
ated the performance of the smoothing algorithm by generating a
Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve according to the 1)
score (Fig. 5). Then, a global optimization algorithm (namely, the
PRICE algorithm see e.g. Brachetti et al., 1997; Liuzzi et al., 2003)
found the parameters giving the best ROC curve (larger area under
curve) obtaining A.U . C. = 0.86. The ﬁnal RBF coefﬁcients were
151 = 4 x 104, 12 = 1 x 104, a = 2, and the number of RBFs used
was 8. The overall algorithm scheme is illustrated in Figure 6.

2.3 Combined cyclicity score

In sum, the proposed methodology is the following: ﬁrst, we decided
whether a given gene expression is sufﬁciently ‘ﬂuctuating’ (cycling
genes usually have such a kind of expression). Then, we identify among
those ﬂuctuating genes, the ones that are cycling by means of a peak
consistency analysis. In particular, the SVM is used to extract the infor-
mation contained in the amplitude of ﬂuctuations and to get rid of bad
shaped expression proﬁles (e.g. ﬂat proﬁles) that usually identify not
cycling genes. Then, the 1) score, which is related to the consistency of
peak timing along two cell cycles, identiﬁes those genes that are cycling.

Once each gene in our test set was classiﬁed (c score) by the learning
machine (ﬁrst step) and the 1) score for that gene was calculated (second
step), we built a combined score as follows:

_ 6 +1)
pcomb — 2

 

where c is the SVM output related to the gene under analysis (6 = 1
cyclic, c = 0 not cyclic). Then we ranked genes according to their pcomb
value. Ideally, the ﬁrst gene in the list should be the one classiﬁed as
cycling (c = 1) and with a pcomb score equal to 1, whereas the last one
should be the one classiﬁed as non-cycling (c = 0) and with a pcomb score
equal to 0.

As a preliminary step, we generated synthetic data to evaluate the dif-
ferentiating ability of the proposed method. To produce realistic synthetic
data, we followed the approach of Zhao et al. (2001). The authors propose
an algorithm to generate synthetic time series by assuming that cell cycle-
regulated genes are transcribed at one invariant time and that synchrony
deteriorates with time, leading to the attenuation of simple pulses into
smooth peaks that dampen out with time. Using this algorithm, we gen-
erate 1000 synthetic time courses covering two cell cycles, and 1000 ran-
domly ﬂuctuating proﬁles, obtained by random time shufﬂing of cyclic
data. Then, we generated, using the same algorithm, 50 positive and 50
negative synthetic examples for the learning step. We also added to all
synthetic data a multiplicative white Gaussian noise having 10 and 20%
of noise standard deviation. We applied the proposed method to such data
and computed ratios of genes scored >05 and <05 for cyclic (Rc) and
non-cyclic (Rnc), respectively, and obtained a ratio of Rc/Rnc = 1/
0.997 = 1.003 with 10% of noise and a ratio of Rc/Rnc = 1/0.993 = 1.007

with 20% of noise thus, indicating a high differentiating power on synthetic
data, slightly favoring positive examples (cyclic genes).

To test our methodology on real experiments, we used microarray data
taken from Bar-Joseph et al. (2008), which consist of a population of
synchronized foreskin ﬁbroblast cells at 2h intervals after their release
from double-thymidine blockarrest (two cell cycles). The list of all genes
and the corresponding scores are reported in Supplementary Table S2.
We computed the pcomb score of the 480 genes indicated as cyclic by Bar-
Joseph et al. (2008) and the resulting pcomb score distribution is reported in
Figure 7. The picture shows a clear bimodal distribution composed of a
group of high pcomb score (dark bars) and a group of low score (light
bars). Two main features of the score distribution (Fig. 7) indicate a good
performance of the proposed methodology: ﬁrst, the low values (ﬂat
proﬁle genes) are almost uniformly distributed, thus indicating that the
value of score 1) does not add any information, consistently with the ‘ﬂat’
nature of the time series revealed by the c score. Second, the high values
(ﬂuctuating proﬁle genes) are skewed toward the maximal value 1, thus
indicating that the score 1) actually provides additional information about
cyclicity. In other words, the combination of the two scores performs
better then each single one.

To further verify LEON performance, we also used an independent
source to check cyclicity. We considered the Cyclebase database
(Gauthier et al., 2009) where human genes are classiﬁed as cyclic using
cell cycle expression data of HeLa cells (Whitﬁeld et al, 2002).
Supplementary Table S3 reports, for each gene of the low pcomb score
group, the annotation and the Cyclebase classiﬁcation. We found 91
genes, of which 18 are classiﬁed as cyclic, 44 non-cyclic and 29 not clas-
siﬁed. Therefore, not considering the unclassiﬁed genes, we found 71% of
the genes in this group classiﬁed by Cyclebase as non-cyclic, in good
agreement with our analysis. Moreover, among the genes for which a
Cyclebase ranking is not available, we considered PRKDl for in vivo
validation, and we actually found a non-cyclic pattern (Fig. 8).

3 IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 SVM classiﬁcation

We selected 50 gene expression proﬁles as positive examples,
compiled from the literature that had been shown to be cell
cycle-regulated in cells synchronized experiments (Supplemen-
tary Table S1). Known cell cycle-regulated genes were limited
to those regulated at the messenger RNA level during a continu-
ous human cell cycle, as determined by traditional experimental
methods. We selected also 50 proﬁles generated by a random
time shufﬂing procedure, considered as negative ones. Even-
tually, we obtained a sample of 100 genes each one having
dimension 17 (time points).

Then, we trained the SVM using the LIBSVM software, a
library for SVMs developed by the Machine Learning Group
at National Taiwan University (Chang et al., 2008) and selected
a radial basis kernel. The parameters C and gamma were deter-
mined by a standard k—fold cross-validation procedure (with
k: 5) combined with a grid search. This procedure is done to
prevent overﬁtting problems (Bishop et al., 1996; Hsu et al.,
2010). In particular, we ﬁrst divided the training set into ﬁve
subsets of equal size. Sequentially one subset was tested using
the classiﬁer trained on the remaining four subsets. Thus, each
instance of the whole training set was predicted once, so the k-
fold cross-validation accuracy is the percentage of data that are
correctly classiﬁed. Various pairs of C and values (selected from
a suitably chosen grid) were tried and the one with the best k—fold
cross-validation accuracy was picked. The ﬁnal values were

where q) is a suitably chosen RBF, aj are the coefﬁcients of the

inverse multiquadric RBF in our experiments:

«#0) = (r2 + 0’)

where a is a positive scalar. This choice was mainly motivated by
the fact that the multiquadric function showed the best perform-
ance in expression proﬁle approximation. To ﬁnd the approxi-
mation, we solved the following regularized problem:

The number of RBFs, the RBF parameter a and the regulariza-
tion parameters 11 and 12 were the same for all the approxima-
tions and were obtained by means of a global optimization
algorithm. The idea behind this approach is that of determining
the values of the parameters that better represent the biological
process under analysis. For a given choice of m, 0, t1 and t2, we
computed the expression proﬁle approximations and the corres-
ponding scores p of the genes in the dataset used for the training
of the SVM.

3.3 Cell culture, synchronization and FACS analysis

Early passage of human foreskin ﬁbroblasts was grown in
Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% Fetal
Calf Serum (FCS). For G0/G1 synchronization, cells were ar-
rested with 0.5% FCS (48 h) and then released in 10% FCS.
Cells were harvested at speciﬁc time points following serum
stimulation and were processed. The progression of cells through
the cell cycle was monitored by ﬂow cytometric (FACS) analysis
of replicate samples of propidium iodide-stained cells (Gurtner
et al., 2008).

reaction (RT-PCR). Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol
reagent (Gibco BRL) and following the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The ﬁrst strand of complementary DNA was synthesized
according to manufacture instructions of the M-MLV RT kit
(Invitrogen). PCR was performed with HOT-MASTER Taq
(Eppendorf) using 2ml of complementary DNA reaction. The

4 RESULTS

4.1 In vivo validation of LEON predicted cell cycle-
regulated genes

Using LEON algorithm we selected 50 genes having the highest
pcomb score and excluded 5 genes that were identiﬁed as cycling
also by Bar-Joseph et al. (2008). Among the remaining 45 new
putatively cycling genes, we experimentally validated the cell
cycle-dependent expression of 9 of them. To this purpose, pri-
mary human ﬁbroblasts prepared from human foreskin were
grown to ~50% conﬂuence and synchronized in Go by serum
deprivation. Cultures were then released from arrest, and cells
were collected at different time points covering one complete cell
cycle (Fig. 8A).

We used RT-PCR to measure the expression level of the nine
genes with higher combined score (see Supplementary Table S2
and Fig. 7) along synchronized cell populations. None of these
genes result to be cell cycle-regulated in the study by Bar-Joseph
et al. (2008), demonstrating the strength of the LEON algorithm
in identifying cell cycle-expressed genes. As shown in Figure 8B
(RT-PCR) and Supplementary Figure S1 (densitometric ana-
lysis), the expression of these nine genes is cell cycle-regulated
being maximum on S phase for six and on G1 phase for four of
them, respectively.

Interestingly, the expression of two of these genes, NCORl
and EDF-l, is already known to be cell cycle-regulated further

conﬁrming the predictive power of the LEON algorithm

the expression level of four genes with a low combined score. Of
note, the expression of these genes is not regulated during the cell
cycle further demonstrating that the LEON algorithm speciﬁc-
ally identiﬁes the cell cycle gene expression. We measured cyclin
A and cyclin B1 as well as GAPDH and aldolase genes as posi-
tive and negative controls, respectively. It is well known that
cyclin A and B1 expression is cell cycle dependent being high
in S phase and in G2, respectively (Pines and Hunter, 1989,
1990). On the contrary, the expression of GAPDH and aldolase
genes is constant during the cell cycle (Eisenberg and Levanon,
2003). As expected, cyclin expression is cell cycle dependent,
whereas GAPDH and aldolase expression is constant. These re-
sults demonstrate that our approach is successful in identifying
cell cycle-regulated genes.

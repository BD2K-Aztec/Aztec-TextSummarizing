ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput measurement techniques for
metabolism and gene expression provide a wealth of information
for the identification of metabolic network models. Yet, missing
observations scattered over the dataset restrict the number of
effectively available datapoints and make classical regression
techniques inaccurate or inapplicable. Thorough exploitation of the
data by identification techniques that explicitly cope with missing
observations is therefore of major importance.

Results: We develop a maximum-likelihood approach for the
estimation of unknown parameters of metabolic network models
that relies on the integration of statistical priors to compensate
for the missing data. In the context of the Iinlog metabolic
modeling framework, we implement the identification method by an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and by a simpler direct
numerical optimization method. We evaluate performance of our
methods by comparison to existing approaches, and show that our
EM method provides the best results over a variety of simulated
scenarios. We then apply the EM algorithm to a real problem, the
identification of a model for the Escherichia coli central carbon
metabolism, based on challenging experimental data from the
literature. This leads to promising results and allows us to highlight
critical identification issues.

1 INTRODUCTION

To further our understanding of the cellular processes shaping
the response of microbial cells to changes in their environment
requires the study of the interactions between gene expression
and metabolism. In recent years high—throughput datasets
comprising simultaneous measurements of metabolism (ﬂuxes,
metabolite concentrations) and gene expression (protein and mRNA
concentrations) have become available (Hardiman et al., 2007; Ishii
et al., 2007). These datasets provide a rich store of information
for modeling the dynamics of the biochemical reaction systems
underlying cellular processes. In particular, they promise to relieve
what is currently a bottleneck for modeling in systems biology,
obtaining reliable estimates of parameter values in kinetic models
(Ashyraliyev et al., 2009; Crampin, 2006).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Notwithstanding these experimental advances, parameter
estimation remains a particularly challenging problem, among other
things due to incomplete knowledge of the molecular mechanisms,
noisy and partial observations, heterogeneous experimental methods
and conditions, and the large size of networks (Marucci et al.,
2011). As a consequence, the models may not be identiﬁable, may
not generalize to new situations due to overﬁtting, and nonlinear
rate functions may make them cumbersome to analyze. This has
led to the proposal of simpliﬁed kinetic modeling frameworks,
including linlog kinetics (Visser and Heijnen, 2003), loglin kinetics
(Hatzimanikatis and Bailey, 1997), power—law kinetics (Savageau,
1976), and more recently, convenience kinetics (Liebermeister and
Klipp, 2006).

Linlog models are a particularly interesting choice for modeling
metabolism (Heijnen, 2005; Visser and Heijnen, 2003). Simulation
studies on the level of both individual enzymatic reactions (Heijnen,
2005) and metabolic networks (Costa et al., 2010; Hadlich et al.,
2009; Visser et al., 2004) have shown that they provide reasonable
approximations of classical enzymatic rate laws. Moreover, with
the help of a recent genome—scale linlog model of yeast metabolism,
parametrized using previously—published kinetic models, it has been
possible to identify key steps in the network, that is, reactions
exerting most control over glucose transport and biomass production
(Smallbone et al., 2010).

A major advantage of linlog models is that, when measurements
of ﬂuxes, enzyme concentrations and metabolite concentrations are
available, the parameter estimation problem reduces to multiple
linear regression (Nikerel et al., 2006). Power—law models, up
to a logarithmic transformation, and loglin models also have
this convenient property. However, the performance of regression
approaches quickly degrades in the presence of missing data, as
is often the case in high—throughput datasets due to experimental
limitations or instrument failures.

In order to deal with this problem, we propose in this article
a maximum—likelihood method for the identiﬁcation of linlog
models of metabolism from incomplete datasets. The speciﬁc
contributions of the paper are 2—fold. On the theoretical side, we
develop a method for the optimization of the likelihood based
on Expectation Maximization (EM) (Dempster et al., 1977). The
method is constructed for linlog models, but is more generally
applicable to other approximate kinetic models whose identiﬁcation
can be formulated as a regression problem. In particular, we derive
analytical expressions for the expectation step that are well—suited
for numerical maximization. This guarantees the applicability of
the approach even when modeling large networks. We show by
means of simulation experiments on synthetic data that our approach

Identification of metabolic network models from incomplete high-throughput datasets

 

outperforms both regression and a reference method from statistical
literature for dealing with incomplete data, multiple imputation
(Rubin, 1976, 1996). In comparison with earlier work on treating
incomplete high—throughput datasets (Oba et al., 2003; Scholz
et al., 2005), our aim is not to estimate the missing values, but
rather to improve the estimation of the model parameters from the
incomplete datasets. This is a different problem that necessitates the
development of novel methods.

On the biological side, we apply the method to a linlog model
of central metabolism in Escherichia coli, consisting of some 23
variables. We estimate the 100 parameters of this model from a hi gh—
throughput dataset published in the literature (Ishii et al., 2007). The
data consists of measurements of metabolic ﬂuxes and metabolite
and enzyme levels in glucose—limited chemostat under 29 different
conditions such as wild—type strain and single— gene mutant strains or
different dilution rates. Standard linear regression is difﬁcult to apply
in this case due to missing data, which disqualiﬁes for 7 reactions
too many datapoints, leaving a dataset of size inferior to the number
of parameters to estimate. Application of our approach allows one
to compute reasonable estimates for most of the identiﬁable model
parameters even when regression is inapplicable.

2 PARAMETER ESTIMATION IN LINLOG MODELS

The dynamics of metabolic networks are described by kinetic models
having the form of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
(Heinrich and Schuster, 1996):

X=N~v(x,u,e) (1)

where x E R1 denotes the vector of (nonnegative) internal

metabolite concentrations, M E R1: the vector of external metabolite
concentrations, 8 €R$ the vector of enzyme concentrations, and
v : 1&1er +m —> Rm the vector of reaction rate functions. N E anm
is a stoichiometry matrix.

The reaction rates v are nonlinear and generally complex functions
of x, M, and 8, with many kinetic parameters that are difﬁcult
to reliably estimate from the data. This has motivated the use
of approximate rate functions, like the linear—logarithmic (linlog)
functions considered in this paper (Heijnen, 2005; Visser and
Heijnen, 2003). The linlog approximation expresses the reaction
rates as proportional to the enzyme concentrations and to a linear
function of the logarithms of internal and external metabolite
concentrations. This leads to the rate equation

v(x, 14,6): diag(e)- (a —i—Bx -ln(x) —i—B“ -ln(u)) (2)

where the logarithm of a vector means the vector of logarithms
of its elements. For conciseness, in the sequel we shall drop the
dependence of v on (x, (4,6) from the notation. An in—depth discussion
of linlog models and comparison with other approximative rate
functions can be found in the review by Heijnen (2005).

We are interested in the estimation of the (generally unknown)
parameters a E Rm, BC 6 Km” and B“ E Rm Xp from q experimental
datapoints (v(k),x(k),u(k),e(k)), k=1,...,q. That is, the data used
for parameter estimation are parallel measurements of enzyme
and metabolite levels as well as metabolic ﬂuxes. The datapoints
(v(k),x(k),u(k),e(k)) are obtained under different experimental
conditions, for instance different dilution rates in continuous cultures
or different mutant strains. Notice that in practice reaction rates are

most of the time measured at (quasi—)steady state (see also Section 6).
That is, on the time—scale of interest the derivatives of metabolite
concentrations vanish and Equation (1) can be rewritten as N - v = 0.

For the purpose of parameter estimation, it is convenient to
rewrite (2) in the form of a regression model:

T
61
(3f =[1ln(x)Tln(u)T]- (Bx)T (3)
e 

where the ratio of two vectors (here v/e) denotes elementwise
division. Let us use an upperbar to denote the mean of a
quantity over its q experimental observations, for instance: W:
(1 /q) 22:1 120‘) /e(k). By the linearity of (3), it holds that

aT

(TvﬂlmeTl- (Bx)T . (4)
e (3“)T

This allows (3) to be reformulated as a mean—removed model

v T T moo—m T (Bx)T
(2_(2>) :[ln(u)—ln(u):| '|:(B“)T:| (5)

and we obtain the following parameter estimation problem:

where 8 E Rq Xm is measurement noise on W.

Notice that the parameter vector at no longer appears in the
regression problem, but an estimate of it can be recovered from
estimates of C: [Bx B“]T by way of Equation (4).

In the remainder of the article, we make the assumption that
each column 8.,- of 8 follows a Gaussian distribution, indicated
by 8.i~t/V(0,Egi), where 228, is diagonal, i.e. the measurement
errors in different experiments are mutually uncorrelated. We further
assume that 8.1' is independent of 8 J- for i# j . Then, Problem 1 can be
subdivided into m independent subproblems, one for each reaction i:

W.i=Y-C.i+8.i (7)

where w,- and 8.,- are the ith columns of W and C, respectively.

The values of the parameter matrices BC and B“ admit
an interesting biological interpretation. Notice that one can
immediately ﬁnd values XOER1,£€ R11, eOERﬂld v06
Rm such that vo/eozv/e, lnx0=ln(x), and lnit0=ln(it). As a
consequence, Equation (5) can be rearranged into the common
relative formulation of linlog models,

where 1m is an m X 1 vector of ones, (v0,x0,u0,eo) is a so—called
reference state (Heij nen, 2005) and BC , B8 are matrices of elasticity
constants, where

Bg=diag(e—0).BX, Bg=diag(e—0).B“. (9)
V0 V0

The elasticities, introduced in the context of Metabolic Control
Analysis (MCA) (Heinrich and Schuster, 1996), describe the
normalized local response of the reaction rates to changes in
metabolite concentrations. The interest is that they can thus be
immediately computed from the values of BC and B“ found by the
solution of Problem 1, and the equality 80/120 =1/(v—/e).

Although straightforward in theory, solving the regression
problem (6) encounters two complications in practice.

(i) Since the measurements are carried out at (quasi—)steady
state, we have N -v(x, M, e) :0. This introduces dependencies
among the data and thus reduces the information content
of the data matrix Y, in the sense that Y becomes rank
deﬁcient. Like in earlier work (Nikerel et al., 2009), we
use standard approaches to solve this problem. We notably
rely on principal component analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe, 1986;
Nikerel et al., 2009) applied to the data matrix Y to reduce
the model order, i.e. the number of independent parameters,
and ensure well—posedness of the regression problem (see
Supplementary Section S1 for technical details). In summary,
we use singular value decomposition (SVD), a technique
decomposing the data matrix into dominant and marginal
components according to a variance criterion. For the purpose
of linear regression, this corresponds to decomposing the
parameter vector into a reduced number of components that
can be determined with certainty based on the data, while the
remaining components are poorly determined, i.e. they are
‘nonidentiﬁable’, and are discarded with negligible effect on
the ﬁt. We note in passing that the columns of W and Y are
zero—mean, an important requirement for the correctness of
the outlined analysis.

(ii) The high—throughput datasets contain a substantial amount of
missing values, due to experimental limitations or instrument
failures. If, for any given reaction, we only used the
datapoints in which all relevant metabolite concentrations,
enzyme concentrations and metabolic ﬂuxes playing a
role in that reaction are available, then a large amount
of data would have to be thrown away. In practice,
we would run the risk that the parameters cannot be
reliably identiﬁed. The development of a method that is
capable of maximally exploiting the information contained
in incomplete datasets for solving Problem 1 is the main
subject of the article and will be fully developed in the later
sections.

3 LIKELIHOOD-BASED IDENTIFICATION OF
LINLOG MODELS FROM MISSING DATA

For every reaction i, we are concerned with the problem of
estimating the unknown parameters 8. ,- of the model given in (7)
in the case where some entries of Y are unknown. We address the
estimation problem by a maximum—likelihood approach, which is

known to yield optimal (unbiased and minimum variance) estimates
for our problem setting in the case where Y is fully known. As the
problem is identical for all reactions i, in the remainder of the section
we will drop for simplicity index -i from the notation.

Let J be the set of indices (row, column) corresponding to the
known entries of Y, i.e. (j,k) E J if and only if k is available. It

is convenient to introduce the decomposition Y = Y —i—Y, where

. ij, ifg,k)€j, ~ 0, if(j,k)ej,
Yj k = ’ .  k = .
’ 0, otherw1se; ’  , k , Other W186.

Matrix Y is fully determined: Once measurements 52 of Y are
collected, we treat Y :52 as ﬁxed parameters of the regression
problem. Matrix Y collects the unknown entries of Y. We model
these missing data as unobserved independent random variables,
whose prior distributions encode our generic knowledge about them.
Assuming that the a priori distributions are not known (worst case),
we deﬁne a Gaussian prior for each quantity that is missing in
an experiment based on the measurements of the same quantity
available from other experiments. For every (j,k) 92’ J and k =
{YI-gk : (j’ ,k) E J} (assumed nonempty), we let

%,k N  
,Uvj,k =mean(?»7§,k), (10)
O'Lk =Std(@j,k).

We can now formulate the estimation problem.

PROBLEM 2. Given measurements W=w and Y :52, compute the
estimate 8=argmaxclog3(8), with 3(8) =fW|§,C(w), where, for
any 8, fW|§,C(-) is the probability density function of W given Y :52
corresponding to model (7)—(10).

Note that 3(8) is a likelihood function for a linear model with
missing data, in the sense that it is deﬁned with respect to available
data Y only. One can express 3(8) by marginalization,

log21c>=log / fwlmawvmcmdi (11)

where ley,y,C(-) is the standard likelihood function for model (7)
given Y :52 and )7, with )7 varying over all possible values of Y,
and fylyx is determined by the prior (10). The explicit solution
to the integral is reported in Supplementary Section S2. A direct
approach to solving Problem 2 is to maximize (11) by numerical
optimization. However, the function is not convex in 8, whence its
direct optimization is prone to end up in local minima and the use
of global optimization strategies is required.

Alternatively, we propose to tackle Problem 2 by an Expectation—
Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). EM provides
a general methodology for the optimization of a likelihood function
with missing information. It is based on an iterative two—step
procedure that, for the problem at hand, we implement as follows.
Let us deﬁne the random variable Z = Y - 8, so that model (7) becomes
W = Y - 8+Z—i—8. Note that Z~ t/V(,U.5,,C, Bic), where for any given

8, mean and variance can be derived from (10). Let 80 be an initial
guess of 8. At every iteration ﬁ:1,2,3,..., compute an updated

estimate 8E from the estimate 85—1

performing the following EM steps:
Expectation: compute

at the previous iteration by

Q(C|3£_1)=EI10gfz,W|y,c(Z,w)I§,313—1,w]
(12)
=f10gfz,W|y,c(z,w)fz|y,ei1,W(Z)dZ-

Maximization: solve

8’3 =argmaxQ(8|8£_1). (13)
C

In (12), fZWW’C is the joint probability density function of Z and

W given Y :52 and 8, while fZligth is the probability density
function of Z given Y :52, W=w and 815—1. These quantities are
easily expressed in terms of model (6) and the priors deﬁned in (10)
(see Supplementary Section B).

It can be proven that, at every iteration E, the EM algorithm
increases the value of 3 (8’5), and eventually converges to a
maximum of 3 (Little and Rubin, 2002). While this is not
necessarily a global maximum, EM has proven effective in many
applications (Graham, 2009; Horton and Kleinman, 2007). A key
property is that convergence to a maximum is achieved even if (13)
is not solved exactly: It sufﬁces that 8’5 is such that Q(8£|8£_1)Z
Q(8‘€_1 |8£_1), which is easily achieved even by a local optimization
algorithm. In practice, we can use the explicit expression of 3
in Problem 2 for stopping the iterations, e. g. when the relative

improvement on 3 falls below a speciﬁed threshold 13> 0:
12(65—28’3—51/128515 r.

To complete the implementation of the algorithm, one must express
Q(CIC£_1) in a form convenient for maximization. As explained
in Supplementary Section S2, one can express (12) as an explicit
function of 8 for any given 85—1. In compact form:

Q(c|e’3—1)o< —KL(fC|1fei-1)—H(fei-1 )—I—10g(KfC) (14)

where fc stands for a Gaussian distribution with variance Efc =
[2;1+E;:]_1 and mean Mfc = Efc (28—1 ~(w—y-8)—I—E;: pic),
Kfc is a function depending on 8 via Mfc and Efc, and the
proportionality factor that we dropped (indicated by the presence of
cc in place of 2) depends on 85—1 but not on 8. Finally, KL(- | | -) and
H (-) are the Kullback—Leibler distance between distributions and the
entropy of a distribution, respectively, for which, in the Gaussian
case at hand, explicit formulas are available (Cover and Thomas,
2006; Stoorvogel and van Schuppen, 1996). A slight technical
complicacy is needed in case Bic is singular (see Supplementary
Section S2 for all the mathematical details).

The availability of the closed—form expression (14) allows us
to implement EM efﬁciently, i.e. with an explicit maximization
problem that is solved numerically at all iterations. Once the
parameter estimates are obtained, several methods from the literature
can be used to assess the accuracy of the results by inferring
conﬁdence intervals. Examples are randomized methods such as
bootstrapping (Manly, 1997) and the proﬁle likelihood method
by Raue et al. (2009). This method derives conﬁdence intervals
using a threshold on a function called the proﬁle likelihood. In our

application, this is obtained separately for each parameter Cj by re—
maximization of (11) with respect to all parameters 816%, for all
values Cj in a neighborhood of 81-.

4 VALIDATION ON SYNTHETIC DATA

Before applying the EM algorithm to actual biological identiﬁcation
problems, we test the performance of the method on simulated
data. For this purpose, a synthetic model has been developed, a
simpliﬁed variant of the linlog model of E.80[i central metabolism
studied in Section 5 below. The model, in the form (2), contains 17
variables, representing internal and external metabolites involved
in 25 reactions, and 78 parameters (see Supplementary Section S3
for the model equations). We generate data matrices Y from this
model by means of simulation, for different percentages of missing
data and experimental noise. Using the model structure and the
simulated data, we solve Problem 1 for each reaction independently,
as described in Section 3.

In order to assess the added value of our speciﬁc implementation
of likelihood optimization, we ﬁrst compare the performance of
the EM algorithm of Section 3 with the direct maximization of
the loglikelihood (11) implemented with a general—purpose MATLAB
optimization routine. This method will be referred to as MaxLL in
the sequel.

Second, we compare the likelihood—based identiﬁcation
approaches with standard methods, notably linear regression
(referred to as Rg) and the commonly—used multiple imputation
(MI) method (Rubin, 1976, 1996). Regression is performed based
on full datasets only, i.e. it does not consider an experimentally—
determined datapoint (v(k),x(k), u(k),e(k)) when at least one of the
measurements is missing. MI is based on imputation of missing
data by random draws of the missing values, i.e. non—zero elements
of Y, from the a priori distribution deﬁned in (10). Both methods
thus exploit only part of the information contained in an incomplete
dataset and provide a lower limit for quantifying the performance
of the methods proposed in Section 3.

Third, we compare the results of EM with the least—squares
identiﬁcation of the model on complete datasets (a method referred
to as RgF, where F stands for Full datasets). Though inapplicable
to real data with missing measurements, the method is statistically
optimal. Hence, it provides us an upper performance bound that
can be used to assess the role of missing data in performance
degradation, separately from the role of noise.

Most of the high—throughput datasets available in the literature
have been obtained when metabolism is at (quasi—)steady—state
(Section 2). In order to mimic available experimental data as closely
as possible, simulated data obtained from the synthetic model
should therefore be steady—state data. We generated steady states of
(1)—(2), and recorded the corresponding metabolite concentrations
and metabolic ﬂux values for 30 different conditions, each consisting
of a random change in the enzyme concentration with respect to a
reference value.

We compared performance of the ﬁve methods described above
(EM, MaxLL, MI, Rg, RgF) on datasets with different amounts
of missing data (40% and 75%) for the metabolite concentrations
and noise levels (10% and 20%) for w. The only difference
with the dataset used for the reference method RgF is that the
latter has no missing data. A noise level of 10% means that the
distribution used to generate the noise has a standard deviation

 

i189

equal to 10% of the values in w. The percentages of missing data in
the simulation study are comparable to those observed in practice
[Section 5 and (Ishii et al., 2007)]. For every different combination
of missing data percentage and noise level, a dataset was generated
by homogeneously distributing missing data among columns of Y,
the indices for each column being chosen at random. For every
simulated scenario, randomly generated noise was added to w in the
dataset.

For all of the above scenarios, identiﬁcation of each reaction was
addressed separately, in accordance with the discussion of Section 2.
For every reaction, we ﬁrst tested the identiﬁability of the synthetic
linlog model by PCA of the full data matrix Y. In our simulation, 9
reactions out of the 25 composing the model were detected as having
nonidentiﬁable parameters. For those reactions, identiﬁcation of a
reduced—order model

w=Y*-8*—i—8 (15)

was performed in place of the identiﬁcation of the original model.
Y * E Rq X r , with r 5 n —i—p, is a reduced—order data matrix obtained by
linear transformation of Y, and 8* E Rr is a parameter vector, smaller
than 8, that is ‘identiﬁable’, in the sense that it is well determined
by the data (see Supplementary Section S3).

We implemented the different parameter estimation algorithms
in MATLAB, using the lscov function for the regression—based
methods and fminsearch for global optimization in MaxLL and
the maximization step in EM. Both EM and MaxLL require an initial
guess of the parameters to be speciﬁed. We proposed 10 different
initial parameter vectors, including the estimation obtained with the
baseline method Rg where available. In order to draw statistics for
the estimation performance, each of the ﬁve algorithms was applied
on 100 Monte—Carlo repetitions of the identiﬁcation problem. The
complete performance test over all methods, conditions and 100
repetitions took about 7 h 40 min in MATLAB 7.4.0 on a Linux PC
workstation (1862 MHZ, 2 GB RAM).

The most informative results from all identiﬁcation methods are
summarized by boxplots of the ratio of the estimated parameter
values 8 over the reference parameter values cref used to simulate
the data. The closer the ratio to 1, the better the estimates. Ensemble
statistics are drawn for all parameters corresponding to the same
reaction. Figure 1 is dedicated to the scenario with 40% missing data
and 10% noise, whereas Figure 2 reports on 75% missing data and
20% noise. Complete results for all reactions under all conditions
can be found in Supplementary Section S3.

Since the individual reactions of the model involve only a small
subset of metabolites, each of the m identiﬁcation subproblems
consists of the estimation of a limited number of parameters, mostly
2 or 3. For the case with 40% missing data, Rg can therefore
be performed in all runs for every reaction of the model. On the
contrary, with 75% missing data, regression cannot be applied to 6
reactions which is apparent from the absence of the Rg statistics for
2 reactions in Figure 2.

In comparison with the other methods, multiple imputation (MI)
gives the worst results (largest bias) in 3 out of the 4 reactions
shown in Figure 1, and in 5 out of 6 reactions in Figure 2. In
reactions 11 of Figure 1 and 22 of Figure 2, the relatively small
biases are accompanied by an estimation uncertainty wider than for
EM and MaxLL. This could be explained by a restricted use of
information contained in the distribution of missing data. Indeed,
MI only considers random draws from the distribution while EM

datasets (RgF). (A—D) Boxplots for reactions 3, 4, 11 and 18 of the network,

and MaxLL are based on all possible values taken by missing data
through integration of the distribution.

Analysis of Figure 1 reveals that, for 40% missing data and
10% noise, the performance of EM and MaxLL is almost identical
and similar to that of regression (Rg and RgF), with limited
improvements on Rg, i.e. slightly smaller variability. In some cases,
such as for reactions 11 and 18, their performance approaches the
optimal, unattainable bound provided by RgF, i.e. they have similar
bias and variability.

Performance improvements of likelihood—based methods over Rg
become more signiﬁcant when identiﬁcation is performed on the
dataset with higher percentage of missing data and larger noise.
Figure 2A—D show results for reactions where Rg was applicable.
Both EM and MaxLL substantially reduce estimation variability in
reactions 3, 17 and 22. At the same time, due to the larger amount
of missing data, performance loss with respect to RgF is more
signiﬁcant. Turned another way, this shows the accuracy that could
be recovered were all datasets complete.

Figure 2E and F show the results when Rg fails to produce
estimates and cannot be used to initialize EM and MaxLL
optimization. Still, EM provides estimates of the right order of
magnitude and, for the case of Figure 2E, of the right sign in at
least 75% of the runs (box entirely above 0), while the median has
the right sign and is reasonably close to 1. The estimation of the sign
provided by MaxLL is less reliable (box crossing 0).

Overall, we conclude that the EM—based approach provides the
most accurate estimates under all simulated conditions. We will
therefore apply this method to the identiﬁcation of the linlog model
of an actual metabolic network from a published high—throughput
dataset.

5 APPLICATION TO CENTRAL METABOLISM IN
E.COLI

The network of central carbon metabolism in E.80[i has been
studied for a long time from different perspectives, which makes
it an ideal model system for our purpose. A rather precise idea of
the structure of the network exists, several kinetic models of the
network dynamics are available [(Bettenbrock et al., 2005; Kotte
et al., 2010) and references therein], and recently a high—throughput
dataset containing the required information for solving Problem 1
has been published (Ishii et al., 2007). The network we consider here
gathers enzymes, metabolites and reactions that make up the bulk of
E. coli central carbon metabolism, including glycolysis, the pentose—
phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and anaplerotic
reactions such as glyoxylate shunt and PEP—carboxylase (Fig. 3).
The dataset used for identiﬁcation of this network was
obtained by experiments with 24 single—gene disruptants that were
grown at a ﬁxed dilution rate of 0.2 th in a glucose—limited
chemostat, and with wild—type cells at 5 different dilution rates

(Ishii et al., 2007). The authors collected data using multiple high—
throughput techniques, in particular DNA microarray analysis
and 2D differential gel electrophoresis (2D—DIGE) for genes and
proteins, capillary electrophoresis time—of—ﬂight mass spectrometry
(CE—TOFMS) for metabolites, and metabolic ﬂux analysis. They
thus obtained a dataset consisting of metabolite concentrations,
mRNA and protein concentrations for the enzymes, and metabolic
ﬂuxes under 29 different experimental conditions. A large number
of different metabolites were measured in the experiments, with
missing data in varying amounts, from 0 to 80% of the observations,
28% on average for the metabolites considered below.

From the reactions listed in (Ishii et al., 2007), we have
constructed a linlog model of the form (2), with 11:16 internal

metabolites, p=7 external metabolites and measured cofactors,
and m=31 reactions (see Supplementary Section S4). Each of the
reactions is catalyzed by a single enzyme, which may actually stand
for several enzymes in the case of isoenzymes, enzyme complexes
or lumped reactions. Reactions have been simpliﬁed or lumped
together when a shared metabolite has not been measured, which
precludes estimation of the corresponding elements in the parameter
matrices Bx and B“. In comparison with an earlier linlog model of
E. coli central carbon metabolism (Visser et al., 2004), we extended
the scope to include the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the glyoxylate
shunt, but due to the above—mentioned simpliﬁcations our model is
more coarse— grained.

An identiﬁability analysis was performed by several rounds of
missing data imputation using the a priori distribution deﬁned
in Equation (10) and PCA, which led in each case to the same
result: 7 out of 31 reactions were detected as having nonidentiﬁable
parameters. For those reactions, the model has been reduced as
described in Equation (15) using a data matrix Y completed by
the means ,uLk of the a priori distributions. For every individual
reaction, the reduced model has a parameter vector 8* that is now
entirely identiﬁable.

Apart from the distribution of the a priori missing data, given
by Equation (10), application of EM requires information about
the distribution of 8, the error on the ratios of ﬂuxes and
enzyme concentrations. The Ishii dataset provides several replica
measurements for a reference experimental condition: wild—type
cells grown in a glucose—limited chemostat with a dilution rate of
0.2h_1. These data were used for the computation of the variance
of 8. In order to assess the accuracy of the estimated Bx and B“, we
computed for each parameter a 95% conﬁdence interval, by means
of the proﬁle likelihood method outlined in Section 3. Running the
EM method on the model and the data took about 220 s using the
implementation of Section 4. The computation of the conﬁdence
intervals for all parameters required about 23 min.

Contrary to the simulation studies reported in Section 4, a
reference or ‘real’ model for the evaluation of the results does not
exist in this case. However, a priori biochemical knowledge on
the signs of the elasticities is available, i.e. elasticities are positive
for substrates and negative for products. This information can be
compared with the estimated signs of the elasticities, and their
conﬁdence intervals, computed from the parameter matrices using
the relations in Equation (9). The results are shown in Table 1.
Similar unshown results are obtained by means of the MaxLL
method.

We observe that the EM method obtains estimates for all
reactions, including the 7 cases where the insufﬁcient amount
of data made regression not applicable. However, 26 of the 100
non—zero elasticities of the model are not identiﬁable from this
dataset. Moreover, out of the remaining 74 elasticity estimates, more
than half of them have signs that are not statistically signiﬁcant,
in the sense that the 95% conﬁdence interval straddles 0. This
is most likely due to the fact that the magnitude of noise in
metabolite concentrations is comparable to the magnitude of relevant
information. For example, for PEP the standard deviation over
all experimental conditions equals the standard deviation of the
replicates in a single condition (0.06mM versus 0.05 mM). This
precludes the estimation of an unambiguous sign.

Of the elasticities with statistically signiﬁcant signs, 20 out of
34 are correct, in the sense that they have the expected positive

or negative sign. The remaining elasticities, distributed over 9
reactions, are incorrectly estimated. Let us now discuss what we
believe are potential sources of these errors, giving information that
could be used to single out erroneous estimates a priori.

We ﬁrst note that for 3 of these 9 reactions (GapA;ng, Mdh
and Edd;Eda, see Table 1), only very few complete datapoints
are available (between 3 and 5) and regression mostly fails in
these cases. In addition, all of these reactions involve at least
one metabolite missing in >70% of the experimental conditions.
The combination of very few complete datapoints and a high
percentage of missing metabolite measurements obviously makes
model identiﬁcation extremely difﬁcult and it is fair to say that here
we reach the limit of the applicability of our method, or of any
method for that matter, due to the lack of data.

Second, 4 reactions are known to operate close to equilibrium:
Pgi, FbaA,FbaB, TpiA and GpmA,Gme;Eno (Visser et al., 2004).
Theoretically, these reactions are not identiﬁable, as their elasticities
are not independent (Visser et al., 2004), but PCA did not detect
this. Most likely, this is due to the above—mentioned noise in
metabolite concentrations, which decreases their correlations. A
cautious, preemptive strategy would be to reduce the model for
any reaction known to be close to equilibrium and eliminate the
corresponding dependent variables.

The errors in the signs of some elasticities in the remaining 2
reactions (PtsG and PykA,Pku) are less straightforward to explain.
It is unlikely that they can be attributed to the EM method, given
that regression is applicable here with a relatively large number of
complete datapoints available (14 and 11, respectively) and gives the
same results. Alternatively, they may be explained by a modeling
error or a hidden variable, for instance an unknown cofactor, biasing
the estimation results. It is also possible that the approximations of
the linlog model are not suitable for these reactions, for instance
because there are large variations in metabolite concentrations
between conditions, driving the system far from the reference state.

In summary, EM gives reasonable results for a fairly complicated
model on a challenging dataset. Even though some puzzling issues
remain, we believe that these can be safely attributed to the inherent
difﬁculty of the identiﬁcation problem.

6 DISCUSSION

In this work, we have addressed the problem of estimating
parameters of approximate models of metabolic networks from
incomplete datasets. Even with the largest datasets available at
present, such as those reported in (Ishii et al., 2007), the absence
or corruption of a large number of measurements may reduce
the effective number of datapoints to a handful of experimental
conditions, thus making simple regression techniques ineffective
or even inapplicable. Making full use of all the available data is
therefore essential to render identiﬁcation well—posed and improve
the quality of the estimated models.

To this aim, we have proposed a maximum—likelihood method
for the identiﬁcation of linlog metabolic network models that
compensates for the missing data by the use of statistical priors. We
developed an algorithm that attains maximization of the likelihood
based on Expectation Maximization, a well accepted paradigm for
the numerical optimization of likehood functions in the presence
of unobserved variables. A simpler implementation based on
direct likelihood maximization via general—purpose numerical

optimization algorithms was also considered and found slightly
less powerful. The performance of EM was compared to that
of an existing method of reference, namely multiple imputation,
and to worst—case and best—case scenarios given by least—squares
regression on the sole complete datapoints and on complete datasets,
respectively. We showed that EM outperforms multiple imputation
by a wide margin. In comparison with worst—case regression, it
reduces the estimation variability and is able to produce reasonable
estimation results even when regression on incomplete datasets is
inapplicable. It also approaches the ideal performance of regression
on complete datasets for low rates of missing data, regardless of
noise.

Based on these ﬁndings, we applied EM to the identiﬁcation of
a linlog model for the central carbon metabolism in the bacterium
E.coli from the experimental data presented by Ishii et al. (2007).
Even with the large amount of incomplete datapoints, due to the
difﬁculty of experimentally measuring metabolite concentrations,
EM was able to estimate many of the model parameters (elasticities)
in agreement with the current understanding of the system. This
is even true for reactions where the reduced number of complete
datapoints impairs the applicability of least squares regression. On
the other hand, the challenging quality of the data sheds light on
the performance limits of the method, which tends to fail when
large measurement noise makes the estimation of small parameters
statistically unreliable, when the same variable cannot be measured
in most conditions, or when reactions operate near equilibrium.

Overall, results from the simulations and the application on real
data showed that our EM approach is able to make the most of
incomplete, noisy high—throughput datasets for the estimation of
parameters in approximate kinetic models. In the future, we expect
to improve performance by developing a number of technical points,
including approximate analytical/dedicated numerical solutions for
the EM maximization steps, the reﬁnement of the identiﬁability
analysis via SVD of incomplete data matrices (Brand, 2002), and
a more detailed modeling of measurement noise. It is worth noting
that, while the method has been developed for linlog models, it is
more generally applicable to any other metabolic network model
that can be put in a form linear in the parameters by straightforward
manipulations, such as generalized mass action models that provide
advantages when some metabolite concentrations approach 0
(del Rosario et al., 2008; Savageau, 1976). In addition, estimated
parameters of approximate metabolic models, such as elasticities
of linlog models, provide useful hints for the identiﬁcation of more
detailed nonlinear kinetic models.

From a broader perspective, the application of the EM method to a
unique multi—omics dataset for E. coli carbon metabolism allowed us
to isolate issues that are critical for the appropriate exploitation of the
data for parameter estimation. These issues may need to be taken into
account during the design of the experiments. One such issue is that a
high percentage of missing data for some of the individual variables,
even at a relatively low average percentage over the entire dataset,
was found to be much detrimental to the identiﬁcation results. This
may inﬂuence sampling strategies, especially for metabolites that
are difﬁcult to measure. Another issue is the identiﬁability problems
caused by steady—state measurements, which cannot always be
resolved by genetic mutation or by varying physiological conditions.
From this perspective time—resolved observations of the network
dynamics, although much more demanding experimentally, carry
great promise (Hardiman et al., 2007).

Abstract

Summary: The TOPDOM database—originally created as a collection of domains and motifs
located consistently on the same side of the membranes in oc-helical transmembrane proteins—has
been updated and extended by taking into consideration consistently localized domains and motifs
in globular proteins, too. By taking advantage of the recently developed CCTOP algorithm to deter-
mine the type of a protein and predict topology in case of transmembrane proteins, and by apply-
ing a thorough search for domains and motifs as well as utilizing the most up-to-date version of all
source databases, we managed to reach a 6-fold increase in the size of the whole database and a
2-fold increase in the number of transmembrane proteins.

Availability and implementation: TOPDOM database is available at http://topdom.enzim.hu. The
webpage utilizes the common Apache, PHP5 and MySOL software to provide the user interface for
accessing and searching the database. The database itself is generated on a high performance

 

computer.

1 Introduction

Protein domains can fold independently from other parts of pro-
teins and have distinct functions. A function linked to a domain
may be important in several processes, therefore one domain may
appear in different proteins (Patthy, 1991). Since domains can only
be functional in appropriate conditions, a particular domain in
various proteins should be located in the same environment, i.e. in
the same subcellular location or in organelles which interiors
have similar physical—chemical properties. Identifying those pro-
tein domains that consistently appear in the same location
may help the annotation of unknown proteins with the same or
similar domains (Deng and Chen, 2015; Mitchell et al., 2014; The
UniProt Consortium, 2014) or the topology prediction of trans-
membrane proteins (TMPs; Dobson et al., 2015a; Tusnady and
Simon, 2001).

During process of cytosis, membranes keep their initial orienta-
tion; therefore, all cellular space can be defined as one of the follow-
ings: inside (cytoplasmic) or outside (extra-cytoplasmic) space. A
detailed description of the various membranes and their sidedness
can be found on the homepage of TOPDB database (http://topdb.
enzim.hu; Dobson et al., 2015b).

Here, we report the update of the TOPDOM database, origin-
ally developed for gathering domains consistently located on the
same side of TMPs (Tusnady et al., 2008). The update was per-
formed by extending the examination with globular proteins and
using exhaustive search for domains and motifs in all proteins ei-
ther having a precise location relative to the membranes (e.g. the
localization ‘Mitochondrion’ is not precise but ‘Mitochondrion
matrix’ is) or being transmembrane. Moreover, we applied statis-
tical significance test to select those domains and motifs that are

consistently on the same side of the membrane either in TMPs or
in non-TMPs.

2 Methods and databases

Amino acid sequences were downloaded from UniProt/SwissProt
(2016_01). CCTOP algorithm was used to discriminate between
TMPs and non-TMPs and to predict topology for TMPs. For non-
TMPs Swissknife (v1.72; Hermjakob et al., 1999) was used to ex-
tract their subcellular localizations. Four domain and motif data-
bases were utilized to identify domains and motifs in amino acid
sequences with the appropriate search methods. They are Pfam 29.0
(hmmer 3.1b2; Finn et al., 2015; Mistry et al., 2013), Prints 42_0
(fingerPRINTscan v3.596; Attwood et al., 2003), Prosite 20.122
(ps_scan rev. 1.79; Sigrist et al., 2013) and Smart 06/08/2012
(hmmer 3.1b2; Letunic et al., 2004). A bootstrap method was de-
veloped to filter significant hits by random shuffling the amino acid
residues on the same side of the membrane in proteins and searching
the domains in the randomized sequences as well. The randomiza-
tion and searching was repeated ten times, and the average and
standard deviation were calculated from the ten search results. A hit
was reported significant if the real counts were greater than the aver-
age plus three times the standard deviation. The final database was
transferred to our web server and imported into an SQL database.
Along with the latter, an Apache server provides the user interface
by using PHP and Bootstrap CSS to ensure functionality across dif-
ferent browsers, operating systems and platforms.

3 Results and discussions

The first version of TOPDOM (Tusnady et al., 2008) was heavily
based on the UniProt (The UniProt Consortium, 2014) annotation.
The discrimination and topological information of TMPs as well as
the identified domains and motifs were taken from the corresponding
CC, FT and DR lines of the UniProt entry. Now, the TOPDOM data-
base has been improved in three ways. First, instead of using the top-
ology annotation of UniProt, we used CCTOP prediction method to
differentiate between TMPs and non-TMPs and to predict the top-
ology of TMPs. Running CCTOP resulted in 77.036 TMPs and
among the rest of the proteins 194.875 non-TMPs with annotated
and unambiguous location was identified using the localization infor-
mation from UniProt. ﬁ—barrel proteins are not involved in the cur-
rent release of the TOPDOM database, since the topology prediction
of [i—barrel proteins is far less accurate than that of oc-helical TMPs.
Second, an exhaustive search for domains and motifs were applied on
all of these 271.911 proteins, bringing 1.538.118 hits. The locations
of the hits could be determined using their sequence position and the
topological and localization information provided by CCTOP and
UniProt/SwissProt for TMPs and non-TMPs, respectively. The third
enhancement concerns the generation of the final database. Formerly,
those domains and motifs were selected that could be identified with
more than 90% frequency on a particular side of the membrane.
Now, we calculate the significance of the hits by a bootstrap method
and select those domains and motifs whose count is greater than three
and the significance level of the hits are over 99%.

Both the large-scale application of CCTOP (on the whole
UniProt/SwissProt) and the scanning of motifs and domains requires
massive computation, therefore these calculations are performed on
our 256 CPU core HPC computer, and the final database is de-
posited to the publicly available web server. Moreover, since
TOPDOM, CCTOP and the generation of the transmembrane sub-
set of UniProt are circularly dependent on each other, the generation
of the database was iterated twice. All of these steps can be done
automatically; therefore, we plan to update the TOPDOM database
following the UniProt updates. The logic and the physical places of
data generation process are delineated in Supplementary Figure S1.

Altogether 6.374 consistently located domains and motifs were
identified from the four source databases (Pfam: 4.134, Prints: 540,
Prosite: 1.370, Smart: 330). 2.007 out of them can be found in
TMPs. The new version of TOPDOM is more than six times larger
than the previous one and more than two times larger regarding
TMPs only.

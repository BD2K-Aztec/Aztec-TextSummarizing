ABSTRACT

WebGLORE is a free web service that enables privacy-preserving con-
struction of a global logistic regression model from distributed data-
sets that are sensitive. It only transfers aggregated local statistics
(from participants) through Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure to a
trusted server, where the global model is synthesized. WebGLORE
seamlessly integrates AJAX, JAVA Applet/Servlet and PHP technolo-
gies to provide an easy-to-use web service for biomedical researchers
to break down policy barriers during information exchange.
Availability and implementation: http://dbmi-engine.ucsd.edu/web
glore3/. WebGLORE can be used under the terms of GNU general
public license as published by the Free Software Foundation.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the biomedical context, a major challenge to ensure sufﬁcient
power of a predictive model is to obtain enough samples. This is
especially important for scenarios like rare disease prognosis,
where individual institutions do not have enough observations.
With the massive adaptation of electronic health records, it be-
comes possible to combine information across institutions to
build powerful global models. There are, however, reality chal-
lenges in combining raw data because of the privacy concern.
To address privacy challenges, researchers proposed many
privacy-preserving models to facilitate data sharing, including
models using generalization, noisy perturbation and a hybrid
of both techniques. Please refer to Fung’s review Fung et a].
(2010). These models try to enforce conﬁdentiality through intro-
ducing ‘indistinguishability’, however, may alter values in the
original data. Results based on such perturbed data cannot be
reliably trusted, for example, in applications like medical surveil-
lance and healthcare decision support. An alternative solution is,
instead of releasing data, to share model through secure multi-
party computing, which approaches leverage security enhanced
protocols (e. g. transmitting aggregated statistics) to offer a prac-
tical solution and shed lights on building accurate predictive
models without disclosing sensitive raw data. In this manuscript,
we target at constructing a collaborative framework for logistic
regression through secure multiparty computing. We focus on

horizontally partitioned data, i.e. using information from locally
hosted databases containing different observations that share the
same attributes (i.e. horizontal partitions of stackable sets of
patient records), which is most common for cross-institutional
studies.

2 METHOD

The authors have previously studied distributed logistic regression models
theoretically but there was no practically useful collaborative software
framework developed for biomedical data analysts to deploy in real
healthcare environment. To close the gap, we developed a software as a
service that allows data analysts to easily construct models across differ-
ent sites. The foundation of this work is based on our previous research:
Grid LOgistic REgression (GLORE) (building shared models without
sharing data) Wu et al., 2012) and expectation propagation logistic re-
gression (explorer): distributed privacy-preserving online model learning
Wang et al., 2013).

3 FRAMEWORK

To avoid sensitive data transferring, we developed a heavy-client
light-server framework in which raw data related computation
tasks are conducted locally. Our system is platform independent
and the client-side functionality can be interoperated in a wide
variety of environments to cope with arbitrary WebGLORE par-
ticipants. To ensure wide accessibility of our framework, we de-
veloped signed communications between Servlets and Applets
using JAVA. Participants only need a web browser to join the
collaborative global model construction through Applets. These
Applets are embedded in the web pages to handle local compu-
tation so that local data never leave their host institutions.
Because only signed Applets can execute and communicate
with Servlets, we can easily check the validity of inputs from
participants on the server side.

WebGLORE uses a three-layer structure. The front-end con-
sists of AJAX-supported web pages, which dynamically reﬂect
the user status (in preparation, prepared, ofﬂine) and task
status (created, ﬁnished). After passing the validity check (i.e.
task name, expiration date, model parameters), an initiator can
invite participants, who have similar type of data and want to
build GLORE together. Once a task is created, invited partici-
pants will receive emails from the server; each one is provided
with a unique link (e.g. hashed by task name and participant’s
email). Our system also memorizes existing collaborators
and stores their emails in a list to be quickly retrieved in
the invitation panel. After some participants conﬁrm

attendance, the task creator (initiator) can trigger the compu-
tation at any time so that the server starts to interact with all
participants.

When the computation begins, WebGLORE works in an
asynchronized manner. In each iteration (Newton—Raphson
step), the server combines intermediary results collected from
participants. The server renews and distributes the value of glo-
bally estimated parameters of the current iteration. The opti-
mization terminates when it meets the accuracy requirement or
the iteration number exceeds the maximum iteration limit. Each
participant can retrieve reports for the global model or the local
model to compare with. These reports contain important statistic
graphs and variables, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, area under the
Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Hosmer—
Lemeshow tests. We also plot the ROC curve and the reliability
diagram for the models. Finally, WebGLORE provides each
participant with an interface to test additional local observations
using the global model. Because WebGLORE does not access
individual records, users have to handle missing data, check
attribute consistency and ensure data quality.

We picked the myocardial infarction dataset (1253 records),
which was collected in Edinburgh, UK (Kennedy et al., 1996), to
demonstrate our system. These records were partitioned (314,
313, 313 and 313) in four sites. We selected nine non-redundant
features in this dataset including pain in left arm, pain in right
arm, nausea, hypoperfusion, ST elevation, new Q waves, ST de-
pression, T wave inversion and sweating. The binary response
indicates the presence of disease. We listed two tables from the
WebGLORE report. Table 1 summarizes the model performance

 

 

 

in terms of discrimination and calibration. Various metrics like
Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), F-score, sensitivity, speci-
ﬁcity and type-I error were listed for discrimination. Regarding
calibration, the web service calculates the calibration error, also
known as, Brier score (i.e. mean squared error from predictions
to observations) and conducts two types of Hosmer—Lemeshow
tests (H-test and C-test) to evaluate the goodness of ﬁt. Table 2
shows information regarding estimated parameters. A small P-
value (3 0.05) indicates the corresponding parameter plays a
signiﬁcant role in prediction.

Results in tables mentioned earlier in the text match exactly
with those of a logistic regression model that was trained on
the combined data from all four individual datasets, which val-
idates our system. In addition, WebGLORE (Fig. 1) generates

Abstract

Motivation: Reconciliation methods aim at recovering the evolutionary processes that shaped the
history of a given gene family including events such as duplications, transfers and losses by com—
paring the discrepancies between the topologies of the associated gene and species trees. These
methods are also used in the framework of host/parasite studies to recover co—diversification scen—
arios including co—speciation events, host—switches and extinctions. These evolutionary processes
can be graphically represented as nested trees. These interconnected graphs can be visually messy
and hard to interpret, and despite the fact that reconciliations are increasingly used, there is a
shortage of tools dedicated to their graphical management. Here we present Syle, a reconciliation
viewer which implements classical phylogenetic graphic operators (swapping, highlighting, etc.)
and new methods to ease interpretation and comparison of reconciliations (multiple maps, mov—
ing, shrinking sub—reconciliations).

Availability and implementation: Syle is an open source, cross—platform, standalone editor avail—
able for Windows and Unix—like systems including OSX. It is publicly available at wmnN.sylvx.org.

1 Introduction

 

Reconciliation methods compare gene trees and species trees to re—
cover the history of gene families. Such a history is composed of spe—
ciation events, duplications, losses, transfers and other evolutionary
events affecting particular genes at specific times in evolution (Page
et 61]., 1998). Reconciliation methods are also used in co—diversification
studies where the phylogeny of parasite species is compared to
that of host species infected by these parasites. Here a different set of
evolutionary events is considered including co—speciation events, dupli—
cations, extinctions and host switches. Few tools are currently available
to visualize reconciliations: Tarzan/CoRe—PA (Merkle et 61]., 2005),
Jane (Conow et 61]., 2010) and PrIMETV (Sennblad et 61]., 2007) pack—
ages use a two dimensional Euclidean slanted layout for the

representation of reconciliations; the 3DPE editor (Kim et 61]., 2007)
uses a 2.5D representation of a slanted layout, crossing species (X) ver—
sus evolutionary distance (Y) versus paralogs (Z). In spite of these
powerful tools for illustrating how a ‘guest’ tree (e.g. a gene history)
evolves inside a host tree (e.g. a species tree), these interconnected
graphs can be visually hard to interpret when the number of evolution—
ary events depicted is high. Another issue is that the available viewers
lack the ability to compare reconciliations obtained under different
settings (e.g. different event costs) or to compare reconciliations for dif-
ferent genes families (or parasite taxa) on the same species tree. The
goal of Syle is the graphical management of such drawings and the
generation of publication—ready illustrations.

2 Methods

Syle is written in Tcl/Tk. The required input is a species tree (Newick
format) and one or several reconciliations in the format outputted by
Mowgli (Doyon et al., 2010). Mowgli is included and dynamically
linked to Syle. TERA (Scornavacca et al., 2014) and NOTUNG
(Vernot et al. 2008) output can be imported. Syle output format is
PostScript or SVG (easily editable with many drawing package and
keeping a high quality graphics). The reconciliation graphs are based
on a species tree (host) using a rectangular layout with a variable thick—
ness line, and a gene history (parasite tree), embedded in the species
tree, which is composed of horizontal segments linked by vertical versa—
tile connectors. The algorithm displaying reconciliations is based on
vertical translation of segments following evolutionary events. For in—
stance, both segments of a duplication are shifted, one upwards and
the other downwards. This offset is then inherited by all the subsequent
nodes and is cumulative with posterior events.

3 Results

Syle’s consists of three toolboxes (Fig. 1). The first one is related
to maps. A map is a resizable and scrollable display space showing a
species tree with one superimposed gene reconciliation. The user can
add/remove maps and choose which reconciliation to display on a
given map from the reconciliation toolbox (see below). Both the spe—
cies tree and its gene reconciliation are updated by applying a tool
(e.g. zoom) from this map toolbox. The second toolbox is specific to
reconciliations. In order to display a reconciliation, first, the user

needs to target one or several map(s) from the map toolbox, and sec—
ondly, select a reconciliation from the list of available ones. The
reconciliation toolbox offers graphical operators such as highlight-
ing (line thickness, dash line, foreground color), shrinking, transla-
tion or annotation that can be applied to internal nodes of a
reconciliation. These operations take into account evolutionary
events, including horizontal transfers. For instance, setting a new
color to an internal node of a reconciliation also updates the color
of all the subsequent horizontal transfers and their descendants.
Reconciliations can be synchronized, meaning that a graphical
modification on a reconciliation from a given map can be automat—
ically conducted on a selection of maps displaying the same recon—
ciliation. The third toolbox is dedicated to the species tree. A species
subtree can be swapped, hidden, highlighted, colored and anno-
tated. Like reconciliations, species trees from several maps can be
synchronized.

4 Discussion

The main feature of Syle is the ability to manage multiple inter—
active maps of reconciliations. Synchronous highlighting operations
between juxtaposed maps ease their comparison. Zooming, annotat-
ing (color, text), shrinking sub—parts of the trees help in the inter—
pretation of chains of events. The Syle method for displaying
reconciliations is based on upward and downward translations of
segments linked by versatile connectors. Displaying reconciliations
having a high number of evolutive events, such as a set of successive

side stacks maps. Duplications are represented by blue squares, losses by red crosses and transfers by arrows (variable colors). The ‘host-parasite’ dataset used
in the figure consists of the Ficus/fig wasp dataset by Cruaud et al. (2012). Two maps are in use: the one on the left displays a species tree with a superimposed
reconciliation having a color coding based on transfers. The second map displays a reconciliation for the same gene but with different costs for evolutionary

duplications, within one (short) species tree segment is still a chal—
lenge (superimpositions of a high number of graphical items in a
small drawing area). More elaborated methods available in the field
of information visualization will be useful, such as the production of
symbolic views (e.g. replacing a set of duplications by one ‘hot spot’
in the tree) or tree navigation tools based on Focus —1— Context distor—
tion such as the accordion zoom (Munzer et al., 2003). Another
challenge is a global view of multiple genes histories on a single
map/species tree. In this context, ﬂattening or smoothing reconcili-
ation graphs and its evolutionary events will be required to avoid
messy visualizations and graphical operators acting locally, manu—
ally or automatically must be developed. In the short term, one pri—
ority is the ability to import reconciliations from other packages
such as PrIMETV (Sennblad et al., 2007).

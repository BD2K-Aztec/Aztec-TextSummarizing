ABSTRACT

Summary: One approach to infer functions of new proteins from their
homologs utilizes visualization of an all-against-all pairwise similarity
network (A2ApsN) that exploits the speed of BLAST and avoids the
complexity of multiple sequence alignment. However, identifying func-
tions of the protein clusters in A2ApsN is never trivial, due to a lack of
linking characterized proteins to their relevant information in current
software packages. Given the database errors introduced by auto-
matic annotation transfer, functional deduction should be made from
proteins with experimental studies, i.e. ‘reference proteins’. Here, we
present a web server, termed Pclust, which provides a user-friendly
interface to visualize the A2ApsN, placing emphasis on such “refer-
ence proteins’ and providing access to their full information in source
databases, e.g. articles in PubMed. The identification of ‘reference
proteins’ and the ease of cross-database linkage will facilitate under-
standing the functions of protein clusters in the network, thus promot-
ing interpretation of proteins of interest.

1 INTRODUCTION

A common practice to formulate hypotheses for a protein of
unknown function includes searching for annotations among
homologous proteins. Although sequence similarity does not ne-
cessarily correlate with functional similarity (Clark and Radivo-
jac, 2011), all-against—all pairwise similarity network (A2ApsN)
works best to illustrate functional relationships among large
numbers of proteins (Atkinson et al., 2009), and meanwhile
avoids computational complexity and problems of aligning
non-homologous sequences (Frickey and Lupas, 2004).
Software packages, such as CLANS (Frickey and Lupas,
2004), Pythoscape (Barber and Babbitt, 2012) and Cytoscape
(Shannon et al., 2003), provide powerful repositories to
manage the A2ApsN. However, they require either programming
basics or expertise in program setups to generate the network
(detailed comparison in the Supplementary Material). Numerous
efforts aim to visualize the protein—protein interaction (PPI) net-
work (Agapito et al., 2013). But these packages build the net-
work by PPI data (not by sequence similarity) and assign
functions by analysing the network structure, such as dissecting

functional modules (Sharan et al., 2007). Given the high misan-
notation rate in current databases (Schnoes et al., 2009), the
simple protein descriptions that current packages offer are some-
what suspect, which hinders the understanding of the protein
clusters. Thus, to avoid working with a network of uncertainty,
one has to tediously verify the functions of nodes in the network
before getting into interesting biology.

Here, we developed a web server named Pclust for visualiza-
tion of the A2ApsN, which emphasizes those “reference proteins’
with experimental studies. Pclust works with the Seq2Ref server
(Li et al., 2013) to identify the “reference proteins’ and highlight
them in the network. The web interface bypasses the pain of
software installation and the requirement of programming ex-
pertise. The highlighted “reference proteins’ and easy access to
their functional studies simplify the process of relating functions
to protein clusters, thus facilitating hypothesis driven research of
proteins of interest.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Preparation of the protein network

According to the type of user inputs, the protein sets shown in the
A2ApsN are taken from (i) Seq2Ref BLAST results; (ii) user input se-
quences; or (iii) user customized data (e.g. http://prodata.swmed.edu/
pclust/help/format.html#custom). If a single sequence is given, proteins
will be taken from its BLAST result against NR. To speed up A2ApsN
generation, CD-HIT (Fu et al., 2012) (optional, default identity cutoff:
95%) reduces the redundancy of the protein set that is used for all-
against-all BLAST clustering.

2.2 Reference protein detection

Proteins either detected by BLAST or input by the user are submitted to
the Seq2Ref server to detect “reference proteins’. As the user input format
is ﬂexible, we submit protein sequences to the Protein Identifier Cross-
Reference (PICR, Wein et al., 2012) service to detect their IDs in PDB,
Swiss-Prot and RefSeq databases.

2.3 Protein network generation

A2ApsN is calculated with force-directed graph drawing algorithms im-
plemented by Vivagraph (https: //github.com/anvaka/V ivaGraphJ S) and
rendered using WebGL library (supported by most browsers). Reference
proteins are colored according to the data sources. Keyword search of the
annotations, adjustment for the link number and on—the—ﬂy reference
panels describing functional studies are implemented by asynchronous re-
quest to our server through AJAX (Asynchronous J avaScript and XML).

3 RESULTS

Pclust has four modes; a user can specify the input as (i) a single
sequence; (ii) multiple sequences; (iii) a Seq2Ref result link; and

Fig. 1. Snapshot of an A2ApsN from Pclust (web link: http://prodata.swmed.edu/wenlin/server/paper_data/pclust/ﬁgl). Protein nodes are colored,
hierarchically, brown (input by the user, if applicable), red (selected by mouse), purple (with PDB structures and their articles), green (with PubMed
articles), yellow (with Swiss-Prot functional comments), blue (with PDB structures of no article, such as those from structural genomics) and light blue
(without any reference, smaller size). A “preview’ panel and a “detailed Info’ panel appear for the protein on which your mouse hovers and your mouse
clicks, respectively. Batch selection of proteins is available by inputting the gi numbers (if applicable) separated by commas, and keyword search is
available for annotations from the NCBI protein database. By default, Pclust will include the ﬁrst quarter or 5000 (whichever is smaller) network links
(ordered by E-value) and report the corresponding E-value cutoff; a panel to adjust network links by varying the E-value cutoff or the link number is also
available. To know more about the control panel, please refer to: http://youtu.be/XkaEg2jGOc

(iv) customized network data. (The input interface is shown in
Supplementary Fig. S1.) The flow chart for each mode is avail-
able in Supplementary Figure S2—S5. The four above modes are
designed to provide A2Apst (i) for any single sequence; (ii)
with an advanced interface similar to CLANS; (iii) for previously
generated Seq2Ref jobs; and (iv) with a customized input that
grants users the flexibility to design. An email is required to keep
track of the job submission. Once the network is ready, an email
containing the result link will be sent to the provided address.

Figure 1 (current E-value cutoff: 2e—38) shows the interface
for an A2ApsN, as well as an example where the input protein
(brown node), annotated as “mandelate racemase’ (gil 17987990),
should be a “fuconate dehydratase’, as previously described
(Schnoes et al., 2009). (Another practical case is available in
the Supplementary Material.) Merely reading the brief protein
descriptions within the cluster, such as “RTS beta protein’,
“mandelate racemase’ and “enolase superfamily member’ (as in
the CLANS interface), results in confusion about the function of
the cluster. Pclust alleviates this confusion by highlighting the
reference proteins and referring to their annotation sources
linked by our server (details available in the Supplementary
Material). For example, the cluster circled in Figure 1 containing
the questionable “mandelate racemase’ (brown) includes two
solved crystal structures of known fuconate dehydratases with
provided links to their experimental data. Thus, with the con-
venience of locating reference proteins in A2ApsN and accessing
their database links, more accurate hypotheses about the func-
tion of protein queries can be generated, potentiating biological
discovery.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Genetic correlations are the genome-wide aggregate
effects of causal variants affecting multiple traits. Traditionally, genetic
correlations between complex traits are estimated from pedigree stu-
dies, but such estimates can be confounded by shared environmental
factors. Moreover, for diseases, low prevalence rates imply that even if
the true genetic correlation between disorders was high, co-aggre-
gation of disorders in families might not occur or could not be distin-
guished from chance. We have developed and implemented statistical
methods based on linear mixed models to obtain unbiased estimates
of the genetic correlation between pairs of quantitative traits or pairs
of binary traits of complex diseases using population-based
case—control studies with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorph-
ism data. The method is validated in a simulation study and applied to
estimate genetic correlation between various diseases from
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data in a series of bivariate
analyses. We estimate a significant positive genetic correlation be-
tween risk of Type 2 diabetes and hypertension of ~0.31 (SE 0.14,
P = 0.024).

Availability: Our methods, appropriate for both quantitative and binary
traits, are implemented in the freely available software GCTA (http://

1 INTRODUCTION

Recently, we have developed new methods to estimate the
proportion of variation in quantitative traits Wang et al., 2010,
2011) or in liability to disease that is associated with single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Lee et al., 2012, 2011). The
methods use very distant relationships between individuals so
that estimates are unlikely to be confounded with shared
family environment effects. The methodology can be extended
to estimation of the genetic covariance and hence genetic

correlation between different disorders that is tagged by SNPs
to provide estimates of genome-wide pleiotropy. Evidence for a
genetic correlation between disorders estimated directly by inter-
rogation of the genome could have an important impact on the
design of future genetic and functional studies for medical nos-
ology and may provide new insights for novel treatments across
disorders.

The aim of this study is to estimate genome-wide pleiotropy
using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) case—control
data for different diseases or disorders. For binary disease
traits, we derive valid statistical approaches to obtain unbiased
estimates of comorbidity interpretable on the scale of liability to
disease. We develop computationally efﬁcient algorithms for
estimation. The method is applied to estimate the genetic correl-
ation between hypertension (HT) and type 2 diabetes (T2D),
bipolar disorder (BD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), BD
and T2D or HT and RA from Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium ONTCCC) GWAS data.

2 METHODS
2.1. Bivariate linear mixed model and efﬁcient AIREML

We used a standard bivariate linear mixed model (Thompson, 1973). The
models can be written as

y1 = X1b1 + Zlg1 + e1 for trait 1 and y2= Xzbz + Zzgz + e2 for trait 2,

where y is a vector of observations for trait, b1 and b2 are vectors of ﬁxed
effects, g1 and g2 are vectors of random polygenic effects for each indi-
vidual in both trait 1 and 2 and el and e2 are residuals for trait 1 and 2,
respectively. X and Z are incidence matrices for the effects b and g,
respectively. The variance covariance matrix (V) is deﬁned as

ZIAZ’zcz

2 2
V = ZIAZ’lagl + 1091 grgz
Z2AZ’20§2 + 1032 ,

Z2AZ’1cég2
where A is the genomic similarity relationship matrix based on SNP
information (Yang et al., 2010) and I is an identity matrix, 0;, of and
083%, which are genetic variance, residual variance and covariance be-
tween g1 and g2. Lee and Van der Werf (2006) showed that the method of
average information (AI) matrices derived directly from the V is much
more efﬁcient computationally than the original AI algorithms (Gilmour
et al., 1995; Johnson and Thompson, 1995). Following equation (8) in
Lee and Van der Werf (2006), the AI matrix for the bivariate model can
be derived as

2.2. Correlation on the scale of liability is approximately
the same as that on the observed risk scale

For disease traits when the y phenotype vectors contain only 1 for cases
and 0 for controls, a liability threshold model can be written to link
unobserved continuous liability to the observed discrete scale of disease
(Falconer, 1965)

l=g*+e* (1)

where l is a vector of liability phenotypes which are distributed as N(0, 1)
in the population, g* is a vector of random additive genetic effects on the
liability scale which are distributed N (0, 053*) and e* is a vector of random
residuals on the liability scale distributed with N(0, 03*). The probit link
function links liability to the probability of y = 1, and g* on the scale of
liability can be approximated by a linear function of g on the observed
0—1 scale (Dempster and Lerner, 1950). Using this linear approximation,
the correlation between two diseases is the same on both the observed and
liability scale (Gianola, 1982; Hoschele et al., 1987). When samples are
ascertained (typical in case—control studies), the genetic value on the
observed scale can be deﬁned with an ascertainment correcting factor
as (Lee et al., 2011)

Pﬂ—P)*
EU:Eﬁ,

where gcc is genetic values on the observed scale in a case—control study,
c is a constant, K is the disease prevalence in the population, P is the
proportion of the sample that are cases and z is the height of the standard
normal probability density function that truncates the proportion
K. From equation (2), the covariance between genetic values on the
observed scale with ascertained samples can be written as

P1(1— P1)Z P2(1— P2)
K1(1— K1) 2K2(1— K2)

gcc g6+2 (2)

 

COV(gcc1 :gcc2) g 21 (KN/(gig?) 

From equation (3) it is clear that that even when samples are ascer-
tained, the correlation is the same on both observed and liability scales,
because an approximate linear relationship exists between the genetic
values on the different scales.

2.3. Simulation study

In order to conﬁrm the derivation that the genetic correlation is approxi-
mately the same on both observed and liability scales when samples are
ascertained, we performed a simulation study. The simulation procedure
was similar to that in Lee et al. (2011) except that two traits were sirnu-
lated with a genetic correlation between them (described in the
Supplementary material).

2.4. Application to genome-wide genotype data

We applied our method to estimate genetic correlation between HT and
T2D, BD and RA, BD and T2D, or HT and RA using WTCCC GWAS
data (W TCCC, 2007), following stringent quality control (QC) as
described in the supplementary material. Since there are two control
groups in the WTCCC data, i.e. 1958 cohort controls and NBS controls,
we used 1958 cohort controls for the ﬁrst trait, and NBS controls for the
second trait. In a conﬁrmation study, we swapped the control groups i.e.
NBS for the ﬁrst trait and 1958 cohort for the second trait.

We estimated a test statistic by dividing the square of the estimated
genetic correlation coefﬁcient by its approximate sampling variance and
calculated a p-value from this test statistic assuming that it is distributed
as a chi-square with 1 degree of freedom.

3 RESULTS

In simulations the estimated genetic correlation on the observed
scale was close to the true values when using various
combinations of true heritability and population prevalence
(Supplementary Table S1). This conﬁrms that the estimated gen-
etic correlation is approximately the same on both observed and
liability scales [Equation (3)]. Previously we have shown that if
misdiagnosis occurs between the two disorders, then the expect-
ation of the estimate of the genetic correlation coefﬁcient can be
non-zero even when the true genetic correlation is zero WV ray
et al., 2012).

The estimated genetic correlation between HT and T2D was
0.31 (SE = 0.14 and p-value = 0.023) (Supplementary Table S2),
indicating that genetic factors for HT and T2D are positively
correlated. However, estimates for genetic correlation between
BD and RA, BD and T2D, or HT and RA were not signiﬁcantly
different from zero (Supplementary Table S2). In a conﬁrmation
study switching control groups between the ﬁrst and second trait
(Supplementary Table S2), the genetic correlation between
HT and T2D was 0.32 (SE=0.14 and P=0.024). Again, none
of other analyses had signiﬁcant genetic correlations
(Supplementary Table S2). None of the parameter estimates dif-
fered signiﬁcantly between our original and conﬁrmation ana-
lyses. We previously demonstrated that the application of our
stringent QC process resulted in estimated genetic variance not
signiﬁcantly different from zero if we conduct a dummy
case-control analysis using these two control sets but treating
one set as a cases (Lee et al., 2011) (h2=0.06, SE 0.11).

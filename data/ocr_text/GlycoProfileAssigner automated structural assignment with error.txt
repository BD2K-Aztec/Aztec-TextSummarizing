Abstract

Motivation: Sequencing glycan structures is a difficult problem that requires the use of multiple ex-
perimental approaches. One powerful approach to glycan sequencing is the combination of liquid
chromatography with sequential exoglycosidase digestions; however, interpreting this can be diffi-
cult and time-consuming. To aid this process, we introduce GlycoProfileAssigner, software for
automated structural assignment of glycan profile data from liquid chromatography experiments.

Results: GlycoProfileAssigner has been tested on human IgG data, and can retrieve the correct

structure in 14 out of 16 peaks tested.

1 Introduction

The study of glycans and glycoproteins is central to understanding a
wide range of biological problems. The majority of human proteins
are glycosylated (Wong, 2005) by oligosaccharides attached to as-
paragine (N-glycans) or serine/threonine (O-glycans). Glycosylation
is also the single most important post-translational modification
observed on biotherapeutic proteins (Walsh and Jefferis, 2006).
Glycans affect the stability, safety and efficacy of biotherapeutics
and understanding which glycans are present on a glycoprotein is
vital to understanding its function.

Glycan structures are challenging to analyze, because a large var-
iety of possible monosaccharide linkages and complex isomeric
branched structures may exist for any given monosaccharide com-
position. A large range of analytical tools have been developed to
elucidate glycan structures, including liquid chromatography, mass
spectrometry, and capillary electrophoresis (Mittermayr and
Guttman, 2012). These approaches are often supplemented with
exoglycosidase digestions to reduce glycan structures by sequentially
removing defined monosacharrides to a well-defined sugar core
(Royle et al., 2006).

GlycoProfileAssigner is a software tool that assists in the
interpretation of HILIC-HPLC and UPLC data. HILIC (Buszewski
and Noga, 2012; Hydrophobic interaction chromatography) is
a technique that separates structures on the basis of their
hydrophilicity. For glycan data, this is roughly equivalent to glycan
size. HPLC and UPLC are High and Ultra performance liquid
chromatography respectively. For glycan LC experiments, chroma-
tographic retention times can be expressed in normalised
Glucose Units (GU) for comparability across different experimental
setups.

Combining LC—derived GU data with sequential enzyme diges-
tions is a powerful method for analyzing the glycan structures
and their relative abundances in a biological sample. The main
difficulty with the current U/HPLC approach is that assignment of
glycan structures is difficult and time consuming as it can require
manually ascertaining the correct digestion pathways for dozens of
glycans between five or more digestion panels. GlycoProfileAssigner
aims to aid this process by offering a fast and accurate method of
enumerating and scoring glycan structure assignments (Royle et al.,
2008).

2 Design and implementation

GlycoProfileAssigner calculates the correct structural assignments
using GU and enzymatic digestion information. Supplementary
Fig. S1 outlines the process GlycoProfileAssigner uses to assign and
estimate assignment error for glycan structures. For the assignment,
glycan digestion profiles are ordered from least to most digested,
and a rough GU-based assignment step is used to determine a start-
ing list of potential glycan structures. This step uses Glycobase
(Campbell et al., 2008) data to assign structures with a matching
GU value :0.30 to each peak. Following this step code derived
from GlycoDigest (Gotz et al., 2014) is used to identify assigned
structures which would be degraded by the applied glycosidases,
which are then removed. Finally profiles are made consistent by
removing glycan structures that do not correspond to structures in a
more digested profile. For example, the most digested profile in
Supplementary Fig. S1 has M3 as the only assigned glycan after di-
gestion with ABS, BKF, BTG and GUI-I. The next most digested pro-
file has the enzymes ABS, BTG and BKF applied (Supplementary
Table S3 describes the specificities of the abbreviated enzymes).
Since these profiles come from the same undigested sample, all gly-
cans in the second most digested profile must digest to M3 on the
application of GUH. Therefore, any glycans that do not match this
criterion are removed.

Finally, glycan error values are calculated. Error values are cal-
culated as: err = abs(AGUeXpected — AGUobserved)

To calculate error values, peaks are matched across digestions by
simulated digestion of structures in peaks, e.g. A1 and A2 in the
ABS, BKF, BTG digestion panel will digest to M3 in the ABS, BKF,
BTG, GUH digestion panel. An observed GU shift is then calculated
as the difference in GU values between the peaks. The expected GU
shift is calculated by observing the monosaccharide units removed in
the simulated digestion, and using Supplementary Table S1 values to
calculate an expected GU shift. Errors are added to each other cu-
mulatively over the entire set of digest panels. The assignments and
error values can then be exported to a CSV file from the
GlycoProfileAssigner GUI.

3 Results

3.1 Structural assignment of human IgG glycans

To validate and demonstrate GlycoProfileAssigner, we compared
GlycoProfileAssigner’s scored assignments to a manually assigned
human serum immunoglobulin G glycan profile, analyzed using
UPLC.

The output of the manual assignment, compared to
GlycoProfileAssigner is shown in Supplementary Table S2. The table
shows the GU values of the UPLC profile peaks, with their manually
assigned peaks in the middle column and the GlycoProfileAssigner
scored output on the right. In 14 out of 16 peaks, the
GlycoProfileAssigner predictions include the correct glycan structure
in its predictions. Glycobase assumes that peak GU will vary by no
more than 0.05 of a GU for the same peak in a different digest. In
the case of the peak at GU 6.75 in this data, the variation was
slightly higher, leading to an incorrect structural assignment. In the
case of the peak at GU 6.38, the recorded GU values in Glycobase
differed too much from the observed value seen here, so FA2[6]G1
was not assigned.

Looking at GlycoProfileAssigner scores in Supplementary
Table 52, it can be seen that the structure with the lowest estimated
error is not always the correct structure, particularly in the case of
bisected and sialylated glycans, but, in general, correct assignments
will have an error of under 0.5.

4 Discussion

GlycoProfileAssigner is not the first time automated structural as-
signment software has been developed. AutoGU (Campbell et al.,
2008) was the original work on this topic; however, this software
was limited to experimentally observed glycan digestions.
GlycoProfileAssigner represents a major advance on this software
by being able to predict the activity of any common glycosidase on
any N- or O-glycan structure, and by including an assignment score
to estimate the likelihood of a correct assignment.

GlycoProfileAssigner does have some limitations: it assumes a
single glycan structure per chromatographic peak, and that all en-
zymatic digestion steps run to full completion. Applying
GlycoProfileAssigner to under-digested profile data, or profile data
where glycan structures are not separated into unique peaks will re-
sult in poor quality assignments.

GlycoProfileAssigner can also be a powerful tool in conjunction
with mass spectrometry data. The GlycoProfileAssigner GUI dis-
plays the theoretical mass of all the predicted assignments, allowing
them to be easily compared with MS experimental data.

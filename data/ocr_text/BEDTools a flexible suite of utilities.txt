ABSTRACT

Motivation: Testing for correlations between different sets of
genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research.
However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-
based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are
routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and
flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these
data in an efficient manner.

Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the
comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features
in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format
(GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence
alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools
are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets
(e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom
genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one
another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating
routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer
intricate questions of large genomic datasets.

Availability and implementation: BEDTools was written in C++.

1 INTRODUCTION

Determining whether distinct sets of genomic features (e.g. aligned
sequence reads, gene annotations, ESTs, genetic polymorphisms,
mobile elements, etc.) overlap or are associated with one another is
a fundamental task in genomics research. Such comparisons serve
to characterize experimental results, infer causality or coincidence
(or lack thereof) and assess the biological impact of genomic
discoveries. Genomic features are commonly represented by the
Browser Extensible Data (BED) or General Feature Format (GFF)
formats and are typically compared using either the UCSC Genome
Browser’s (Kent et al., 2002) ‘Table Browser’ or using the Galaxy
(Giardine et al., 2005) interface. While these tools offer a convenient
and reliable method for such analyses, they are not amenable to
large and/or ad hoc datasets owing to the inherent need to interact
with a remote or local web site installation. Moreover, complicated

analyses often require iterative testing and reﬁnement. In this sense,
faster and more ﬂexible tools allow one to conduct a greater number
and more diverse set of experiments. This necessity is made more
acute by the data volume produced by current DNA sequencing
technologies. In an effort to address these needs, we have developed
BEDTools, a fast and ﬂexible suite of utilities for common operations
on genomic features.

2 FEATURES AND METHODS

2.1 Common scenarios

Genomic analyses often seek to compare features that are discovered
in an experiment to known annotations for the same species. When
genomic features from two distinct sets share at least one base pair
in common, they are deﬁned as ‘intersecting’ or ‘overlapping’. For
example, a typical question might be ‘Which of my novel genetic
variants overlap with exons?’ One straightforward approach to
identify overlapping features is to iterate through each feature in
set A and repeatedly ask if it overlaps with any of the features in
set B. While effective, this approach is unreasonably slow when
screening for overlaps between, for example, millions of DNA
sequence alignments and the RepeatMasker (Smit et al., 1996—2004)
track for the human genome. This inefﬁciency is compounded when
asking more complicated questions involving many disparate sets of
genomic features. BEDTools was developed to efﬁciently address
such questions without requiring an installation of the UCSC or
Galaxy browsers. The BEDTools suite is designed for use in a UNIX
environment and works seamlessly with existing UNIX utilities (e. g.
grep, awk, sort, etc.), thereby allowing complex experiments to be
conducted with a single UNIX pipeline.

2.2 Language and algorithmic approach

BEDTools incorporates the genome-binning algorithm used by the
UCSC Genome Browser (Kent et al., 2002). This clever approach
uses a hierarchical indexing scheme to assign genomic features
to discrete ‘bins’ (e.g. 16 kb segments) along the length of a
chromosome. This expedites searches for overlapping features,
since one must only compare features between two sets that
share the same (or nearby) bins. As illustrated in Supplementary
Figure 1, calculating feature overlaps for large datasets (e.g.
millions of sequence alignments) is substantially faster than using
the tools available on the public Galaxy web site. The software
is written in C++ and supports alignments in BAM format
(Li et al., 2009) through use of the BAMTools libraries (Barnett
et al., http://sourceforge.net/projects/bamtoolsl).

2.3 Supported operations

Table 1 illustrates the wide range of operations that BEDTools
support. Many of the tools have extensive parameters that allow
user-deﬁned overlap criteria and ﬁne control over how results
are reported. Importantly, we have also deﬁned a concise format
(BEDPE) to facilitate comparisons of discontinuous features (e.g.
paired-end sequence reads) to each other (pairToPair), and to
genomic features in traditional BED format (pairToBed). This
functionality is crucial for interpreting genomic rearrangements
detected by paired-end mapping, and for identifying fusion genes or
alternative splicing patterns by RNA-seq. To facilitate comparisons
with data produced by current DNA sequencing technologies,
intersectBed and pairToBed compute overlaps between sequence
alignments in BAM format (Li et al., 2009), and a general purpose
tool is provided to convert BAM alignments to BED format, thus
facilitating the use of BAM alignments with all other BEDTools
(Table 1). The following examples illustrate the use of intersectBed
to isolate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that overlap
with genes, pairToBed to create a BAM ﬁle containing only those
alignments that overlap with exons and intersectBed coupled with
samtools to create a SAM ﬁle of alignments that do not intersect
(-v) with repeats.

$ intersectBed —a snps.bed —b genes.bed > out.bed
$ pairToBed —abam reads.bam —b exons.bed > out.bam

$ intersectBed —aba.m reads.ba.m —b repeats.bed —v |
samtools View — > reads.noRepeats.sa.m

Other notable tools include coverageBed, which calculates
the depth and breadth of genomic coverage of one feature set
(e. g. mapped sequence reads) relative to another; shuﬁ‘leBed,
which permutes the genomic positions of BED features to allow
calculations of statistical enrichment; mergeBed, which combines
overlapping features; and utilities that search for nearby yet non-
overlapping features (closestBed and windowBed). BEDTools also
includes utilities for extracting and masking FASTA sequences
(Pearson and Lipman, 1988) based upon BED intervals. Tools
with similar functionality to those provided by Galaxy were
directly compared for correctness using the ‘knownGene’ and
‘RepeatMasker’ tracks from the hg19 build of the human genome.
The results from all analogous tools were found to be identical
(Table 1).

2.4 Other advantages

Except for the novel paired-end functionality and support for
alignments in BAM format, many of the genomic comparisons
supported by BEDTools can be performed in one way or another
with available web-based tools. However, BEDTools offers several
important advantages. First, it can read data from standard input
and write to standard output, which allows complex set operations
to be performed by combining BEDTools operations with each
other or with existing UNIX utilities. Second, most of the tools
can distinguish DNA strands when searching for overlaps, which
allows orientation to be considered when interpreting paired-end
mapping or RNA-seq data. Third, the use of BEDTools mitigates
the need to interact with local or public instances of the UCSC
Genome Browser or Galaxy, which can be a major bottleneck
when working with large genomics datasets. Finally, the speed

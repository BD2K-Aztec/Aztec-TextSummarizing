ABSTRACT

Motivation: With the rapid development of high-throughput
sequencing technologies, the genome-wide profiling of nucleosome
positioning has become increasingly affordable. Many future studies
will investigate the dynamic behaviour of nucleosome positioning
in cells that have different states or that are exposed to different
conditions. However, a robust method to effectively identify the
regions of differential nucleosome positioning (RDNPs) has not been
previously available.

Results: We describe a novel computational approach, DiNuP,
that compares nucleosome profiles generated by high-throughput
sequencing under various conditions. DiNuP provides a statistical
P-value for each identified RDNP based on the difference of read
distributions. DiNuP also empirically estimates the false discovery
rate as a cutoff when two samples have different sequencing
depths and differentiate reliable RDNPs from the background noise.
Evaluation of DiNuP showed it to be both sensitive and specific
for the detection of changes in nucleosome location, occupancy
and fuzziness. RDNPs that were identified using publicly available
datasets revealed that nucleosome positioning dynamics are closely
related to the epigenetic regulation of transcription.

1 INTRODUCTION

As a basic unit of the eukaryotic genome, the nucleosome is formed
by an octamer of histones and the surrounding 147 bp of DNA
(Kornberg and Lorch, 1999; Luger et al., 1997). Nucleosomes
play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of diverse
cellular processes through covalent modiﬁcations of histone tails
(Heintzman et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2005) and positioning of
nucleosomes (Jiang and Pugh, 2009; Li et al., 2007). Although
previous studies have focused primarily on the former mechanism,
the relative location of the DNA and the histone octamer, or
the nucleosome positioning, is also a determining mechanism

for epigenetic regulation through controlling the accessibility of
transcription factor binding sites (Mellor, 2006; Workman and
Kingston, 1998). In addition, in the process of gene transcription,
the frequency of nucleosome unwrapping and formation can reﬂect
the rate of Pol II elongation (Luger, 2006; Schwabish and Struhl,
2004). As a result, if genome—wide nucleosome proﬁles for cells
exposed to different conditions are known, then researchers can
better understand the dynamic behaviours of the transcriptional
machinery.

With the rapid development of high—throughput sequencing
technologies, genome—wide nucleosome proﬁles have been
generated for several organisms at a single—nucleotide resolution
(Kaplan et al., 2009; Mavrich et al., 2008; Schones et al., 2008;
Shivaswamy et al., 2008; Valouev et al., 2008, 2011), which provides
an opportunity to study nucleosome positioning dynamics in cells
that are in different states or that are exposed to different conditions.
To identify regions of differential nucleosome positioning (RDNPs),
Shivaswamy et al. (2008) introduced the concept of a nucleosome
score to indicate the stability of the nucleosome position and then
compared scores for yeast samples before and after heat shock. In
addition, a fold change calculation can be an intuitive method for
identifying regions with sequencing read number changes. However,
those approaches have several limitations. First, to the best of
our knowledge, none of the previous studies provided a statistical
measurement, e.g. a P—value, to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the
difference in the nucleosome positioning changes. Second, both the
fold change calculation and the nucleosome score comparison are
sequencing—depth independent, which would affect the robustness
of the results, especially when the sequencing depth is low.

To address these limitations, we present a novel method called
differential nucleosome positioning (DiNuP) in this article. DiNuP
takes advantage of the single—nucleotide resolution of nucleosome
proﬁles, and it directly compares the distributions of sequenced
nucleosome—DNA centres along the genome between different
samples to detect genomic regions with differential nucleosome
positioning without introducing any intermediate concepts (such as
the nucleosome score or the positioned nucleosome). DiNuP also
calculates P—values and empirically estimates the false discovery
rate (FDR), to evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of the identiﬁed
difference. Moreover, DiNuP provides various parameters with
which to characterize the physical properties of those identiﬁed
regions. When applied to publicly available nucleosome proﬁles for
yeast (Kaplan et al., 2009), DiNuP reliably detected differences in
nucleosome positioning in a sequencing—depth—dependent manner,

and the detection of nucleosome position differences in the
functionally important regions implies a close relationship between
nucleosome positioning and eukaryotic transcriptional regulation.

2 METHODS

2.1 Estimation of the FDR

We ﬁrst randomly choose 1% of all of the sliding windows to be the
estimating region. Next, the reads of each paired window were combined and
then re—sampled based on the initial ratio of that window’s number of reads.
Most of the re—sampled windows are expected to have no differences except
for the differences in the sequencing depths. The Kolmogorov—Smirnov (K—
S) test is then used to calculate the difference between these re—sampled
windows, and the P—values are ranked from small to large. Finally, a speciﬁc
percentile of the ranked P—value is used as an FDR estimation. The FDR that
is obtained by this method accounts for both the sequencing depth and the
background noise, giving a robust cutoff when identifying RDNPs.

2.2 Evaluation in simulated datasets

To evaluate the reliability and accuracy of DiNuP, we simulated different
types of differential nucleosome positioning and used DiNuP to detect the
simulated regions. First, to facilitate the computation, we chose a 20 kb region
as the control and simulated the nucleosome proﬁle region. Data were also
obtained from (Kaplan et al., 2009). Second, regions with a length of 200 bp
were randomly selected to simulate repositioned variation from 0 to 100 bp,
an occupancy change percentage from 0 to 100% and a positioning degree
change from 0 to 0.5. The background noise was then added by applying a
coordinate disturbance of 3 bp to the residual part of the 20 kb region. Third,
DiNuP was used to identify the region of differential nucleosome positioning
between the simulated region and the original region, repeating every degree
of the simulation 1000 times. If the detected region was in accordance with
the simulated region, then it was a true—positive hit; otherwise, it was a
false—positive hit. The FDR was calculated as the ratio of the number of
true—positive hits to the number of all positive hits.

2.3 Evaluation in real datasets

Three physical properties that we deﬁned, the repositioned variation,
the occupancy change and the positioning degree change, were used
to characterize three major types of differential nucleosome positioning:
changes in nucleosome location, changes in occupancy and changes in
fuzziness. We calculated those three properties in each 200 bp sliding window
(10 bp as a step) separately. For each property, windows with values that were
larger than a speciﬁc cutoff were regarded as the positive condition. Positive
windows identiﬁed by DiNuP as differential windows were regarded as true
positives; otherwise, they were regarded as false negatives. Windows with
no obvious change (i.e. 5 bp for repositioned variation, 20% for occupancy
change and 0.05 for positioning degree change) were then regarded as the
negative condition. The negative windows identiﬁed by DiNuP as differential
windows were then regarded as false positives; otherwise, they were regarded
as true negatives. Since the number of true negatives and false positives are
constant values in our deﬁnition, we used the ratio between false positives
and outcome positives as the FDR.

2.4 Physical properties

Zhang et al. (2009) deﬁned the nucleosome positioning degree of a certain
genomic site as the ratio of the number of reads for a 20 bp window to that
of a 160 bp window centred around that location. A positioning degree of 1.0
indicates that this site is a nucleosome that is perfectly positioned, whereas
a positioning degree of 0.05 indicates that this site is a nucleosome that is
poorly positioned. The change in the positioning degree can be obtained by
calculating the average difference in the positioning degree between samples.
First, each identiﬁed RDNP was divided into 160 bp regions with a step of

10 bp. Second, the largest positioning degree of each short region was used
to represent the degree of this region. Third, the average degree of each 160
bp region was used to represent the positioning degree of the whole region.
Finally, the difference between the samples was deﬁned as the change in the
positioning degree.

2.5 Analysis of identiﬁed RDNPs

Because the identiﬁed regions can overlap more than one gene, we assigned
a summit (the candidate driver location) of each RDNP to its corresponding
genomic feature. Yeast promoters were deﬁned as the region from —350 bp
upstream from the transcription start site (TSS) to +50 bp downstream from
the TSS. Using this deﬁnition, 22% of the RDNPs should occur randomly
within promoters. The ratio of real hits to random hits was used to represent
the enrichment. The P—value signiﬁcance was calculated using the binomial
test. Moreover, if one identiﬁed RDNP overlapped with one gene, we then
put this gene into a gene list and used DAVID to perform GO analysis.
In addition, we used Transcription factor (TF) data with intermediate—
conﬁdence conservation and a binding criterion of 0.005. The signiﬁcance
of TF enrichment was calculated using the binomial test. Gene expression
data for yeast grown in YPD medium and YPGal medium were obtained
from (Komili et al., 2007; Verstrepen et al., 2008). The signiﬁcance of
the overlapping between genes proximal to RDNPs and genes that were
differentially expressed was calculated by a hypergeometric test.

2.6 Software implementation

DiNuP is implemented in Python and is freely available. It runs from a
command line and inputs the following parameters: —t for the ﬁrst ﬁle of
nucleosome proﬁles; —c for the second ﬁle of nucleosome proﬁles; ——name
for the name of the run; —f for enabling DiNuP to calculate physical properties;
——windowsize for the size of the sliding window (default 200 bp); ——fdr for the
FDR cutoff to detect RDNPs; ——pvalue for setting a P—value cutoff; ——region

the format of the input ﬁle; ——bias for the simulation of the experimental bias
(default 3 bp); ——times for the number of times to calculate the K—S test and
take the average P—value as the signiﬁcance of the difference (Default 3);
——wig for whether to save signiﬁcant P—values into the wiggle ﬁle; —a for
setting the average nucleosomal DNA length for Sample A and —b for setting
the average nucleosomal DNA length for Sample B; ——fold for additionally
applying fold change method; ——fcutoff for the cutoff of fold change method
(Default 2).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Strategy to detect RDNP

There are three major types of differential nucleosome positioning:
changes in nucleosome location, occupancy and fuzziness (Fig. 1A).
Our strategy was designed to capture all three types based solely on
the changes in the distribution of nucleosome sequencing reads. To
date, all publicly available nucleosome proﬁles that were generated
using high—throughput sequencing technology include sequences for
only one end of nucleosome—DNA fragments. To represent the whole
nucleosome, each read was extended toward its 3’ end by 147 bp, as
described previously (Zhang et al., 2008, 2009). We took the centre
of the extended read (dyad) to represent the precise nucleosome
location in the following steps (Fig. 1A).

For two samples, we scanned the whole genome with a sliding
window (200 bp as the default window size and 10 bp as the
default step), and for each sample, the location coordinates (relative
to the window’s midpoint) of the derived dyads in each window
were treated as a numeric list. Since the two—sample K—S test is a
non—parametric approach for determining whether two numeric lists

example of reducing experimental bias by giving coordinate disturbances.
The read distribution is obtained from reads within the sliding window
(yellow). D is the largest distance between the cumulative distributions

are derived from the same distribution, we applied this approach
to test whether the nucleosome positions in each window were
different between the two samples. In this way, the centre of each
window is assigned a P—value to indicate the signiﬁcance of the
difference. To evaluate and eliminate the effect of sequencing depth
and background noise, we used a sampling method to empirically
estimate the FDR, which provided a robust cutoff for comparing the
different pairs (see Section 2). Consecutive regions with P—values
smaller than the cutoff and having a certain length (5% as the default
FDR and 70 bp as the default minimum length) are identiﬁed as
candidate RDNPs. The ﬁnal length of each identiﬁed region will,
thus, be the default minimum length plus the size of the sliding
window.

To analyse the performance of this strategy, we checked
the consistency between the regions of change in the proﬁle
and the identiﬁed candidate regions. As expected, most of the
candidate regions have obvious differences in the nucleosome
proﬁles (Supplementary Fig. S1). However, we also observed
some candidate regions with similar proﬁles between samples. An
example region is shown in Figure 1B. Nucleosome proﬁles for
Sample A and Sample B are generated in the same way as described
in a previous study (Zhang et al., 2008). In the window chr5:
327, 340—327, 540 (yellow), Sample A has 248 dyads at location
327, 443 (24.3% of the dyads) in the window, while Sample B
has only 3 dyads at location 327, with 443 (0.7% of the dyads)

in the window. Although our strategy provides high sensitivity
to detect even single—nucleotide changes between samples, such
differences may not be biologically meaningful. Potential artifacts
that arise from MNase treatment, PCR ampliﬁcation or sequencing
biases (Zhang and Pugh, 2011) can cause such small changes. To
eliminate these artifacts, we introduced coordinate disturbances (3
bp as the default) by adding a random number to the location of
the dyads for each sliding window within the candidate region,
and then we re—calculated the differences. This step ﬁlters out the
majority of artifacts from the predicted RDNPs because the read
distribution of the two samples has been transformed to be more
similar (Fig. 1B). Finally, our strategy identiﬁes a list of genomic
regions with signiﬁcantly different nucleosome proﬁles.

3.2 Method evaluation

To systematically inspect the performance of DiNuP when
identifying different types of nucleosome positioning dynamics,
including changes in location, occupancy and fuzziness, we used
computational simulations to evaluate the performance of our
method by comparing simulated datasets with a real dataset that
has an equivalent genomic coverage of 200x (see Section 2). Since
our approach has a very low false—positive rate, we use a true—
positive rate and a FDR as measurements of performance. In the
simulation of the repositioning, DiNuP has a sensitivity of 96.6%
and an FDR of 1.2% when the simulated variation is only 20
bp (Fig. 2A and B). This result indicates that our approach can
identify even mild nucleosome repositioning. In addition, DiNuP
has a sensitivity of 83.4% and an FDR of 3.9% with a 2—fold
occupancy change (Fig. 2C and D), demonstrating that our approach
can also detect this type of change. We use the positioning degree,
which has been described previously (Zhang et al., 2009), to
represent the nucleosome fuzziness. The results of the positioning
degree simulation show that the DiNuP has a high sensitivity and
a low FDR when detecting changes in the positioning degree. For
example, when the positioning degree change is 0.2, the sensitivity
of DiNuP is 98.7% and the FDR is 1.9% (Fig. 2E and F). In general,
the simulation results demonstrate that DiNuP performs well in
identifying different types of differential nucleosome positioning.

In addition to characterizing the reliability of DiNuP, we also
assessed the effect of the sequencing depth on the ability to identify
RDNPs by read sampling (Fig. 2A—F). The results indicate that the
sequencing depth affects the performance of DiNuP to a large extent;
for example, when the sequencing depth decreases from 200 to 10 X,
the sensitivity for identifying repositioning by 30 bp decreases from
97.2 to 78.1%, the sensitivity for identifying a 3—fold occupancy
change drops from 94.9 to 49.5%, and the sensitivity for identifying
a positioning degree change of 0.1 decreases from 94.0 to 58.6%. In
other words, the ability of DiNuP to detect RDNPs improves with
increasing sequencing depth.

We also evaluated the performance of DiNuP under different
cutoffs in real datasets (see Section 2). The evaluation results show
that DiNuP has a high sensitivity for the identiﬁcation of different
types of differential nucleosome positioning (Fig. 3A, C and E;
Supplementary Fig. 83A, C and E). In addition, the evaluated
speciﬁcity of DiNuP is also very high (more than 98%). We then
compared DiNuP with the fold change method based on both the
simulation and the real biological datasets. Except for the occupancy
change (where the standard was deﬁned by the fold change), the

fold change method performs much worse than DiNuP for both
changes in nucleosome location and fuzziness (Fig. 3B, D and
Figs; Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3B, D and F). Furthermore,
the FDR of DiNuP is also lower than the fold change method
under different cutoffs (Supplementary Table S1). This superiority
of DiNuP arises from its natural characteristics, and an example
region is shown in Supplementary Figure S4.

3.3 Physical properties of RDNPs

A previous study has deﬁned some physical properties of single
nucleosomes, such as the positioning location, the occupancy and
the fuzziness (Mavrich et al., 2008), all of which may change
under different conditions. To obtain a better understanding of
RDNPs, we deﬁned three parameters, the repositioned variation,
the occupancy change and the change in the positioning degree,
to characterize the identiﬁed regions (Table 1). The mean location
difference of nucleosomal dyads between samples within a certain
RDNP was deﬁned as the repositioned variation. In addition,
nucleosome occupancy changes or the change in the number of
bound nucleosomes were measured by calculating the fold change

in the number of reads between samples. Finally, to represent the
change from fuzzy nucleosomes to phased nucleosomes, a parameter
for the change in the nucleosome positioning degree was introduced
(see Section 2).

Assuming that there is a mechanistic driving force (e. g. TF binding
or Pol II elongation) behind each RDNP, we deﬁned two additional
parameters to characterize potential mechanisms. To identify the
location that might be related to the cause of the differential
nucleosome positioning, the genomic site with the most signiﬁcant
P—value calculated by DiNuP was deﬁned as the candidate driver
location. Based on the perspective that different drivers could cause
changes with different ranges, we merged adjacent RDNPs and used
the length of the merged region to represent the effective width
(Table 1). In addition to analysing the RDNPs in a quantitative way
using the parameters provided above, we were also able to classify
the regions into different groups based on one or several physical

are interested only in speciﬁc types of RDNPs.

3.4 Use of DiNuP to analyse public datasets

To our knowledge, Kaplan et al. (2009) generated nucleosome
proﬁles with the greatest sequencing depth among the publicly
available datasets for yeast grown in three culture media. These
media were YPD, YPGal and YPEtOH, and the sequencing had
genomic coverage of 294x, 152x and 187x, respectively. We
applied DiNuP to compare the nucleosome proﬁles of pairs of these
three datasets. When comparing the YPD medium samples and the
YPGal medium samples, 698 RDNPs were identiﬁed using an FDR
cutoff of 5%, which is equivalent to ~2.2% of the yeast genome.
After assigning each region to its relevant genomic feature, 228
regions are found to be within promoters (Fig. 4A), with a fold
enrichment of 1.54 and a P—value signiﬁcance of 8.9 X 10—11
relative to the background (see Section 2). Based on the assumption
that dynamic nucleosome positioning is related to genes that are
responsive to different environmental signals, we also assigned
each identiﬁed region to its neighbouring genes and performed
gene ontology (GO) analysis using DAVID (Huang da et al.,
2009). As expected, the identiﬁed RDNPs are proximal to genes
that are signiﬁcantly enriched in GO terms, including oxidative
phosphorylation, the galactose metabolic process and the generation
of precursor metabolites and energy (Fig. 4B). Moreover, 9 out of
11 genes with the GO annotation of the galactose metabolic process
were identiﬁed as having differential nucleosome positioning.

We next examined whether differential nucleosome positioning is
closely related to the binding of transcription factors. An enrichment
score was calculated by comparing the number of functional cis—
elements measured by ChIP—chip (MacIsaac et al., 2006) within
RDNPs and the number that would be within the elements by chance.
We observed that several transcription factors with important roles
in regulating the glucose and galactose metabolic processes were
signiﬁcantly enriched in the identiﬁed RDNPs (see Section 2)
(Supplementary Table S2). For example, among the 20 conserved
binding sites of GAL4, 7 of them are within RDNPs, with a
fold enrichment of 16.1. Moreover, when the relationship between

includes the genes that are proximal to all of the identiﬁed RDNPs. Group 1
includes the genes that are proximal to RDNPs that have an effective width
shorter than 400 bp, Group 2 includes the genes proximal to RDNPs that have
an effective width longer than 400 bp but shorter than 700 bp and Group 3
includes genes proximal to RDNPs that have an effective width longer than
700 bp. (D) Venn diagram of the RDNPs obtained for the YPD_YPGal pair
and RDNPs obtained for the YPD_YPEtOH pair

RDNPs and differential gene expression was examined, 43% of the
genes that were proximal to the RDNPs were differentially expressed
(Fig. 4C), with a signiﬁcant P—value of 4.8 X 10‘5 (see Section
2). However, for more than half of the genes that were proximal
to RDNPs, their expression levels in YPD medium and YPGal
medium were almost the same. This result suggests that nucleosome
positioning dynamics has a close relationship with gene transcription
but cannot determine the absolute expression level.

To assess the properties of the identiﬁed RDNPs, the parameters
that are deﬁned in Table 1 were used to classify these regions into
groups. We found that most of the regions were in the unrepositioned
group (reposition variation smaller than 20 bp) and that six out
of nine identiﬁed galactose response genes were accompanied by
severe positioning degree changes. In accordance with a previous
report that nucleosome remodelling is always restricted to one or two
individual nucleosomes (Shivaswamy et al., 2008), we observed that
more than 80% of the identiﬁed RDNPs had effective widths that
were shorter than 400 bp. Interestingly, there was an increase in the
percentage of differentially expressed genes among genes that were
proximal to RDNPs when the effective width of the RDNPs was
increased (Fig. 4C). For example, 25 out of 37 of the genes that
were proximal to RDNPs with an effective width that was longer
than 700 bp were differentially expressed, whereas only 264 out
of the 610 genes that were proximal to RDNPs with an effective
width shorter than 400 bp were differentially expressed. This result
suggests that extensive changes in nucleosome positioning might
be more directly and closely associated with gene expression than
slight nucleosome positioning changes.

We further compared the nucleosome proﬁles of yeast that
was grown in YPD medium and YPEtOH medium. The results

show that the identiﬁed RDNPs are also slightly enriched in
promoters (Supplementary Fig. SSA) and that the genes surrounding
RDNPs are signiﬁcantly enriched in GO terms, including the
vacuolar protein catabolic process, oxidation reduction and the
monosaccharide metabolic process (Supplementary Fig. S5B). After
obtaining two lists of RDNPs for different pairs, we then asked
whether differential nucleosome positioning is cell—type speciﬁc.
By comparing the RDNPs of the YPD—YPGal pair and the YPD—
YPEtOH pair, unique differential regions in each pair were obtained
(Fig. 4D). Seven out of nine galactose response genes were found to
be speciﬁcally proximal to RDNPs for the YPD—YPGal pair. Genes
that were proximal to unique RDNP in the YPD—YPGal pair also
included a larger percentage of differentially expressed genes than
the genes that were not proximal to these regions. In summary, our
analysis shows that the identiﬁed RDNPs are within functionally
important regions and that differential nucleosome positioning is
closely related to the epigenetic regulation of transcription. The
identiﬁed RDNPs for this dataset can be obtained in Supplementary
Table S3.

It is reported that nucleosome proﬁles may vary between
biological replicates in some genomic regions (Zhang and Pugh,
2011). To systematically inspect the role of the variation between
replicates, we applied DiNuP to all possible 15 pair—wise
comparisons of the six biological replicates of YPD medium. Even
with a stringent cutoff (FDR 0.01), dozens of or even hundreds
of RDNPs can still be identiﬁed. After carefully checking the
identiﬁed regions, we found that nucleosome proﬁles in these
regions are largely different (Supplementary Fig. S6). To check
whether the variability between replicates shows any biological
meaning, we picked genes that were proximal to the identiﬁed
RDNPs and analysed the functional enrichment of those genes.
As a result, none of the gene lists obtained from the 15 pairs is
enriched in any of the GO terms. We further checked whether those
identiﬁed RDNPs are randomly distributed by summarizing the
number of shared RDNPs among 15 pairs (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Then, 75% of the identiﬁed RDNPs were in only one or two
pairs, indicating that the variability between biological replicates
is largely random. This variation could be mainly caused by a
bias in the MNase treatment, PCR ampliﬁcation or sequencing,
which cannot be corrected solely based on a computational method.
Considering the experimental bias, when comparing nucleosome
proﬁles between samples, some nucleosome positioning changes
might not be biologically meaningful. However, if the compared
samples were treated with the same experimental strategy of
nucleosome proﬁling, then this variability would not largely affect
the identiﬁcation of RDNPs with real biological meaning.

4 DISCUSSION

When comparing the nucleosome proﬁles of different samples, it is
important to ﬁrst make the samples comparable to each other. DiNuP
uses the K—S test to calculate statistical P—values between sliding
windows and estimates the FDR from the background P—value for
use as the cutoff to achieve this goal. After reducing the number
of potential artifacts, genomic regions with P—values consecutively
lower than the cutoff were then identiﬁed as RDNPs. It is worth
noting that, when using different FDRs or minimum length cutoffs,
the number of identiﬁed RDNPs can differ greatly. Therefore, the

cutoff chosen depends on the features of the identiﬁed regions that
are preferred by the user.

Because DiNuP is designed to capture the most signiﬁcant
read distribution changes, it should strike a balance between the
detection of different types of nucleosome positioning changes at a
certain FDR cutoff. In the identiﬁcation of short—range nucleosome
occupancy change, although regions with different occupancy levels
may have similar read distributions, the K—S test can identify the
differences in both boundaries around the occupancy change region.
After combining the differential signals on the boundary of sharp
nucleosome occupancy changes, regions with differential occupancy
levels can be identiﬁed. However, in terms of long—range nucleosome
occupancy change, as the differential signals on the boundaries can
be too far away from each other to be combined as an RDNP, our
method will have limitations in the accurate identiﬁcation of regions
with long—range occupancy changes. As a result, we implemented
the fold change method into the software package of DiNuP and
provided an option to users who are especially interested in detecting
occupancy changes. Nevertheless, DiNuP is, in general, an effective
and robust method for identifying RDNPs.

Another important factor that inﬂuences the detection of
differential nucleosome positioning is sequencing depth. To evaluate
this effect, we sampled datasets with different levels of genomic
coverage and used DiNuP to detect RDNPs. Assuming that the
results obtained from the datasets with the deepest sequencing
depth were the most reliable results, we used these RDNPs as a
standard to determine the level of consistency between the regions
identiﬁed using datasets with lower sequencing depths and those
identiﬁed using the standard dataset (Supplementary Fig. S8). With
an FDR cutoff of 0.01, the consistency percentage dropped to ~60%
with a genomic coverage of 50, indicating that the sequencing
depth indeed affects the detection of RDNP to a large extent.
From this perspective, we argue that a minimum sequencing depth,
i.e. a genomic coverage of 20 or 30, is required for the accurate
identiﬁcation of differential nucleosome positioning; otherwise,
genomic regions that are identiﬁed as different may not be truly
different but instead may appear different as a result of random
discrepancies or background noise.

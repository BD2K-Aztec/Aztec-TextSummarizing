ABSTRACT

Summary: GeneReporter is a web tool that reports functional
information and relevant literature on a protein-coding sequence of
interest. Its purpose is to support both manual genome annotation
and document retrieval. PubMed references corresponding to
a sequence are detected by the extraction of query words
from UniProt entries of homologous sequences. Data on protein
families, domains, potential cofactors, structure, function, cellular
localization, metabolic contribution and corresponding DNA binding
sites complement the information on a given gene product of interest.
Availability and implementation: GeneReporter is available at
http://www.genereporter.tu-bs.de. The web site integrates databases
and analysis tools as SOAP-based web services from the EBI
(European Bioinformatics Institute) and NCBI (National Center for
Biotechnology Information).

1 INTRODUCTION

In face of next— generation sequencing and high—throughput analyses,
the link between obtained data and existing knowledge is crucial.
Automatic annotation pipelines provide useful evidence of potential
functions for genes and proteins, but in a last essential step, the
scientist must manually evaluate the available information. Usually,
the necessary evidence is derived from scientiﬁc publications,
databases and in silico predictions. Thus, tools that provide a
combination of all of these relevant data for a gene or protein of
interest are of high practical impact. In this context, GeneReporter
offers a customizable workﬂow for the integrated application of
protein sequence analysis and document retrieval.

A large number of diverse text—mining tools exist that provide
different strategies and interfaces to satisfy the extensive data—
mining demands in biomedical sciences (Krallinger et al., 2010).
GeneReporter identiﬁes citations related to a gene or protein
sequence of interest. The UniProt annotations of homologous
sequences are used to derive keywords such as gene names,
synonyms and species. These keywords provide the query terms for
a subsequent literature search in PubMed (Sayers et al., 2010). In

data transfer and processing. Input and output is depicted as rectangles, web
services are depicted as rounded rectangles.

this way, GeneReporter extends and replaces MineBlast (Dieterich
et al., 2005), a similar tool which is discontinued. In comparison
with other tools that connect literature to sequence information,
like quickLit (Gilchrist et al., 2008) and Metis (Mitchell et al.,
2005), GeneReporter is characterized by highly customizable query
options, the integration of InterPro and the direct access to the
original EBI and NCBI databases.

2 REQUESTING LITERATURE AND SEQUENCE
ANALYSIS

The user can enter up to 10 nt or protein sequences to submit
a query on the GeneReporter web site. Two different types of
analyses are provided: (i) homology-based document retrieval
searches information on homologous sequences from the UniProt
Knowledgebase (UniProt Consortium, 2010) and citations from
PubMed. (ii) Analysis of the protein sequences requests protein
annotations from InterPro (Hunter et al., 2009), Phobius (Kall et al.,
2007) and PrediSi (Hiller et al., 2004). The complete workﬂow is
depicted in Figure 1. An example for an application is given as
Supplementary Material.

Using homology—based document retrieval, the ﬁrst step is a
BLAST search in UniProtKB, where the user can select the desired
algorithm. NCBI—BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) and WU—BLAST
(Lopez et al., 2003) result in a different ranking of homology
matches, and therefore yield different query word extractions from
the respective UniProtKB entries. PSI—BLAST (Altschul et al.,
1997) is the most sensitive algorithm and beneﬁcial for sequences
that fail to result in signiﬁcant hits with the other algorithms. Either
Swiss—Prot or the complete UniProtKB can be chosen as BLAST

target database. The UniProtKB entries of the resulting BLAST
hits are parsed for gene names, synonyms and species names,
which are used as query terms for the subsequent PubMed request.
This literature search can be further speciﬁed, e.g. by additional
query terms and years of publication. The option ‘organism—speciﬁc
search’ adds the respective species name to the PubMed search
string. Query and result options and the construction of the PubMed
queries are described in detail in the Supplementary Material.

For further analysis of the protein sequence, GeneReporter
submits a query to InterProScan that matches the sequence against
InterPro. This database comprises predictive signatures that assign
protein families, various domains and functional sites for a protein
of interest. The input sequence can also be analysed by Phobius
and PrediSi, which search for putative transmembrane regions and
signal peptides.

To assure long—term up—to—date datasets and analysis tools,
GeneReporter utilizes standardized web services from the EBI
(Goujon et al., 2010), the NCBI (Sayers et al., 2010) and our
institute. The processing time of a query strongly depends on these
services. The web service providers bind the access of their services
to certain rules in order to avoid overload and abuse of their
resources. To match these rules, a local queuing system monitors
and limits the number of simultaneous queries. Details on cut—offs
and limits are provided as Supplementary Material.

3 RESULTS

The results are summarized on an overview page. For each query
sequence, this page provides a link to a detailed view of the obtained
data for the requested services. The result overview page can be
bookmarked and results can be retrieved from this URL for at least
24 h. For further analysis, results can be downloaded as Excel or
tab—delimited text ﬁles.

The detailed view provides one result tab for each requested
service. The BLAST result tab shows homologous protein
sequences. It is complemented with annotations from the UniProt
database, e.g. organism name and GO terms, in order to facilitate
their evaluation. The PubMed result tab shows gene—related citations
ordered by the respective PubMed queries. Query words that were
matched within title and abstract are marked in bold. For each
query word combination, the link ‘This query in PubMed’ performs
the corresponding query on the PubMed web site. This allows
the manual modiﬁcation and speciﬁcation of the automatically
generated queries with all the sophisticated features of the PubMed
search interface. Furthermore, GeneReporter provides citations from
UniProt entries of the BLAST hit sequences. In general, these
references comprise the key papers on the respective gene or
protein. Figure 2 shows the PubMed tab of an example search for a
hypothetical protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa C3719.

The output from InterPro, Phobius and PrediSi requests is given
in additional tabs. The InterProScan and Phobius output includes
graphical visualizations of signature matches and transmembrane
regions within the proteins of interest.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identification of protein—ligand binding sites is critical to
protein function annotation and drug discovery. However, there is no
method that could generate optimal binding site prediction for different
protein types. Combination of complementary predictions is probably
the most reliable solution to the problem.

Results: We develop two new methods, one based on binding-spe-
cific substructure comparison (T M-SITE) and another on sequence
profile alignment (S-SITE), for complementary binding site predictions.
The methods are tested on a set of 500 non-redundant proteins har-
boring 814 natural, drug-Iike and metal ion molecules. Starting from
low-resolution protein structure predictions, the methods successfully
recognize >51% of binding residues with average Matthews correl-
ation coefficient (MCC) significantly higher (with P-value <10‘9 in
student t—test) than other state-of-the-art methods, including
COFACTOR, FINDSITE and ConCavity. When combining TM-SITE
and S-SITE with other structure-based programs, a consensus ap-
proach (COACH) can increase MCC by 15% over the best individual
predictions. COACH was examined in the recent community-wide
COMEO experiment and consistently ranked as the best method in
last 22 individual datasets with the Area Under the Curve score 22.5%
higher than the second best method. These data demonstrate a new
robust approach to protein—ligand binding site recognition, which is
ready for genome-wide structure-based function annotations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Proteins perform the biological functions through interactions
with other molecules (called ligands). The identiﬁcation of specific
ligand-binding site (LBS) on proteins is often the first important
step toward understanding the function of protein molecules,
or for rational design of new therapeutic compounds to modu-
late the protein functions (Greer et al., 1994; Hubbard, 2006).
Due to the technical difficulties and high cost associated with
experimental determination, however, the structural details for

protein—ligand interactions are unknown for most proteins.
Even for the proteins with experimentally solved 3D structure,
there are nearly 40% of proteins (i.e. 35 633 out of 90 424) in
the PDB which lack biologically relevant ligand-binding inf orma-
tion, as shown in BioLiP (Yang et al., 2013). Accurate prediction
of ligand—protein binding is therefore required for both biological
and therapeutic studies.

A variety of methods have been developed for computational
prediction of protein LBSs; these methods can be generally cate-
gorized into two groups, i.e. sequence-based (Capra and Singh,
2007; Fischer et al., 2008; Lopez (2161]., 2011; Rauselletal., 2010) or
3D structure-based (An et al., 2005; Brylinski and Skolnick, 2008;
Capra et al., 2009; Hendlich et al., 1997; Laskowski, 1995; Roche
et al., 2011; Roy et al., 2012; Roy and Zhang, 2012; Wass et al.,
2010) methods. Most of the sequence-based methods rely on the
residue conservation analyses under the assumption that the
ligand-binding residues are functionally important and therefore
conserved in evolutionary process (Capra and Singh, 2007). This
approach has the advantage of generating prediction from se-
quence alone but the precision of predictions is low (typically
around 35% at 20% recall) because many non-binding residues
can also be of high degree of conservation due to the diverse roles
(e.g. to keep the fold stable).

For the structure-based methods, two different approaches
prevail. In the first approach, the ligand-binding pocket is iden-
tified by recognizing the surface cavities on the 3D structural
model of the target protein (An et al., 2005; Capra et al., 2009;
Hendlich et al., 1997; Laskowski, 1995). It has the advantages of
ab initio modeling of the LBSs as predictions are made without
using templates, but the false positive rate can be high, especially
for the low-resolution models generated from protein structure
predictions. The second structure-based approach is to infer
ligand-binding information from the known template proteins,
which have similar global and/or local structure to the query
(Brylinski and Skolnick, 2008; Roche et al., 2011; Roy et al.,
2012; Roy and Zhang, 2012; Wass et al., 2010). As shown in
the recent community-wide CASP experiments (Schmidt et al.,
2011), this type of template-based approaches represent by far
the most accurate methods, especially for targets which have
close homologs in the ligand—protein complex structure data-
bases. Nevertheless, no individual methods can generate sufﬁ-
ciently accurate predictions for different targets. For instance,
the template-based methods do not outperform ab initio pocket
identification methods for distant-homologous targets; and the

Complementary methods for ligand-binding site prediction

 

performance of pocket-based methods can be signiﬁcantly
degraded in the targets without high-resolution models, where
sequence-based methods may have their advantage.

In this work, we aim to develop a reliable approach which
could generate highly accurate ligand-binding predictions for dif-
ferent categories of protein targets. We ﬁrst design a new struc-
ture-based algorithm (TM-SITE) which derives LBSs from
structure-related templates with the alignments built on bind-
ing-speciﬁc substructures matches. Second, a new binding-spe-
ciﬁc sequence proﬁle alignment method (S-SITE) is developed
for evolution-based LBS recognition. Finally, we design
COACH to combine the prediction results of TM-SITE and S-
SITE with other available LBS tools by the support vector ma-
chine (SVM) training. Because one of the major objectives in this
work is for genome-wide function annotation following the se-
quence-to-structure-to-function paradigm, we will examine and
test our methods on low-resolution structure models generated
by the state-of-the-art protein structure predictions (Roy et al.,
2010; Zhang, 2007; Zhang, 2008). All the algorithms and data
developed in this work are freely accessible at our website.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Datasets

Our benchmark testing dataset consists of 500 non-redundant proteins
that harbor 814 ligands (410 natural ligand, 238 drug-like ligand and 164
metal ions). This set of proteins are taken from the previous benchmark
study (Roy et al., 2012; Roy and Zhang, 2012), but one protein (PDB ID:
3cq3) was removed because its ligand (GOL) is not biologically relevant
as evaluated in BioLiP (Yang et al., 2013). Ligands in this benchmark are
more comprehensive, including metal ions and other ligands from the
BioLiP database. In addition, a set of 400 non-redundant proteins with
at least 5 residues bound to known ligands are collected from BioLiP as
the training set to train our methods. None of proteins in the training set
has a sequence identity >30% to the proteins in the test set.

For each protein, the structural models are generated by the standard
I-TASSER pipeline (Roy et al., 2010) where all homologous templates
with a sequence identity >30% to the query sequence are excluded from
the template library. This sequence identity cutoff is also used to ﬁlter
out all ligand-binding templates when generating the LBS predictions.
The two datasets of proteins, together with the binding-ligands and the
I-TASSER models can be downloaded at http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.
umich.edu/COACH/benchmark.

2.2 TM-SITE

TM-SITE is designed to derive the LBSs by structurally comparing the
query with the proteins of known LBSs (called template). There are gen-
erally two types of structural comparisons. The global comparison aligns
the entire structure of two proteins which is most robust to recognize the
similarity of two folds; but the alignment on the ligand-binding regions,
which is important for LBS predictions, can be distracted by the struc-
tural variations in the regions far away from the binding pockets. On the
other hand, the local comparison based on the binding residue structures
is more sensitive to detect the similarity of speciﬁc binding pockets; but it
has a high false positive rate due to the too small number of residues
involved in the comparisons. TM-SITE takes an intermediate approach
balancing the two comparisons, i.e. to compare the structures of a sub-
sequence from the ﬁrst binding residue to the last binding residue (called
SSFL) on the query and template proteins. A ﬂowchart of TM-SITE is
depicted in Figure 1A, which consists of three steps of SSFL generation,
binding template identiﬁcation and LBS selection.

binding site prediction

2.2.] SSFL generation For templates, an SSFL library is pre—calcu—
lated for all proteins in the BioLiP database by collecting the residues
associated with the known ligands. For the query, various surface cavities
are ﬁrst identiﬁed by ConCavity (Capra et al., 2009) which detects the
cavities based on the shape of the structural surface. For each identiﬁed
cavity, residues that have any heavy atoms within 2.5A to the cavity’s
mesh points are considered as putative binding residues. The cavities with
>15 putative binding residues are deﬁned as putative binding pockets
which are then used to determine the SSFL of the query. If there is no
cavity with >15 binding residues, the largest cavity is used for the query
SSFL deﬁnition.

2.2.2 Binding template identificatiOn For a given query protein, we
use TM-align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) to thread the query SSFL
structure through the SSFL library by optimal structural alignments.
The match between each pair of query and template SSFL structures is
evaluated by a composite scoring function which counts for both global
and local, structural and sequence similarities, i.e.

2
1 + e—[L,(o.4Lg+0.3L,+0.2JSD)+TM]2 _

 

qstr = 19 
where LC is the fraction of template binding residues that are aligned to the

1’!
query structure by TM-align. L =  accounts for the local

i=11+(di/d0)
structure similarity between the binding pockets of query and template
proteins, where n is the number of the aligned residue pairs associated with
the binding pockets of the template and d,- is the distance of i—th residue

1’!
pair. L, =  B(Rf.’, Rf.) measures the evolutionary relation between the
'—1

aligned binding residue pairs where B(Rf.’,Rf.) is the normalized

BLOSUM62 score for the i—th aligned residue pair. I SD is an evolutionary
conservation index deﬁned as the average Jensen—Shannon divergence
score over the predicted binding residues, which is calculated from multiple
sequence alignments (see Supplementary Materials for detail). Here, I SD
should not be considered redundant to Ls, since Ls is deﬁned for the pair-
wise conservation between the query and the structure template from
BioLiP, but I SD is for the conservation between query and all other hom-
ologous sequences detected from sequence database by PSI-BLAST

(Altschul et al., 1997). Finally, TM 2 2 is the harmonic average

of the two TM-scores returned by TM-align when aligning the query and

 

template SSFLs, where TM, and TMq are TM-scores normalized by query
and template lengths, respectively. The format of Equation (1) and the
weighting parameters have been determined by extensive trial and error on
the 400 training proteins, which results in the best performance on the
ligand-bind site recognitions according to the average Matthews’s correl-
ation coefﬁcient (MCC) values.

All proteins in the template SSFL library with a qstr score >0.65 are
collected as putative templates; if no proteins have a qstr> 0.65, the pro-
tein with the highest qstr will be selected. Meanwhile, a second scan using
the entire query structure as a probe is conducted through the BioLiP
library based on TM-align (Fig. 1A). All proteins, which are missed by
the ﬁrst SSFL-based scan but hit by the whole-chain based scan, are
added to the putative template pool. Since the whole-structure based
scan has lower speciﬁcity, a lower cutoff, qstr> 0.57, is used in the
second structure scan.

2.2.3 LBS clustering and selection To select the ligand-binding resi-
dues on the query, all ligands bound with the proteins in the putative
template pool are projected to the query structure based on the corres-
ponding alignments from TM-align. These ligands are then clustered
based on the spatial distance between their geometric centers, where an
average linkage clustering algorithm is conducted with a distance cutoff
4A. At the beginning, each ligand sample is treated as a cluster. Two
clusters are merged into one when their distance is below the cutoff. For
clusters containing multiple ligands, the cluster distance is computed as
the average over the pair-wise distances of the geometric centers between
all the ligands from the ﬁrst cluster and all the ligands from the second
cluster. The cluster merging iteration starts from the cluster pairs of the
closest distance, and stops when no cluster pairs have the distance smaller
than the distance cutoff (4 A).

For each cluster, a set of consensus binding residues, which usually
correspond to one binding pocket, are deduced from all the ligands in the
cluster based on the maximum voting. The residues receiving >25%
votes, i.e. more than a quarter of templates in the cluster have the
same residues as the binding site, are considered as the ﬁnal predicted
LBS residues in the binding pocket. This clustering procedure and cutoff
selections are similar to the ones used by previous methods, including
3DLigandSite (Wass et al., 2010), COFACTOR (Roy et al., 2012; Roy
and Zhang, 2012), FINDSITE (Brylinski and Skolnick, 2008) and
FunFOLD (Roche et al., 2011). A conﬁdence score of the predicted
binding residues, associated with speciﬁc ligand-binding clusters, is
deﬁned by

2

CS! 2 1 + e—[2612?+0-2ln(1+ﬂ)+0.2anTa] _ 1» (2)

 

where m is the number of template ligands in the cluster and M is the
total number of templates selected. qggfx is the maximum of qstr score
from the templates in the cluster as calculated by Equation (1). JSDTa is
the average JDS score for the predicted LBS residues from the ligand
cluster. Again, this form of scoring function was decided by trial and
error on our training set proteins. In the ﬁnal TM-SITE predictions,
the binding pockets are selected and ranked based on the CS, score,
with the binding residues sorted by the number of votes in each binding
pocket. In our training data, a prediction with CS,> 0.35 has average
false positive and false negative rates below 0.16 and 0.13, respectively.

2.3 S-SITE

S-SITE is another template-based method, which detects protein tem-
plates and the LBSs using binding site speciﬁc, sequence proﬁle—proﬁle
comparisons. The procedure of S-SITE is illustrated in Figure 1B, which
consists of three steps of sequence proﬁle generation, template identiﬁca-
tion and LBS selection.

2.3.] Profile generation To obtain the proﬁle of the query protein,
PSI-BLAST is used to thread the query sequence through the NCBI
sequence database for constructing multiple sequence alignments. A
position-speciﬁc frequency matrix (PSFM) is then computed from the
multiple sequence alignments. Similarly, the template proﬁles, which
are represented by the position-speciﬁc scoring matrices (PSSM), are
pre-constructed by the PSI-BLAST searches for all proteins in the
BioLiP library.

2.3.2 Template identification To detect homologous templates from
BioLiP, the query proﬁle PSFM is compared with the template proﬁle
PSSMs in the library using the Needleman—Wunsch dynamic program-
ming algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970). The score for aligning
the i—th residue in the query to the j—th residue in template is deﬁned as

20
5,,- = 253,13}, + 3(sgl, SJ?) + 2b;B(Rf!, R11), (3)
k=1
where  k (or PJ’.’ k) is the i,k-th (j,k-th) element in the query PSFM (or the
template PSSM); s? (or SJ?) 6 {H, E, C} is the three-state secondary struc-
ture (‘H’ =alpha helix, ‘E’ =beta strand and ‘C’ =random coil) of i—th
(or j—th) residue in the query (or template); the secondary structure for
templates are assigned by STRIDE (Heinig and Frishman, 2004) using
the PDB structures. For query, its secondary structure is predicted by
PSIPRED (Jones, 1999). 6(x, )2) equals to 1 if x = y, or 0 otherwise; b} = 1
if the j—th residue is at the binding site in the template, or b} = 0 otherwise;
B(Rf.’, R11.) is the normalized BLOSUM62 similarity score for residues
R? in query and RJ’. in template with value in [0,1] (see Supplementary
Materials). Overall, the ﬁrst term in Equation (3) accounts for the query-
to-template proﬁle alignments, the second for the secondary structure
match, and the third for evolutionary relation of residues in the LBSs.
The quality of a template match is estimated by

2
qseq = 1 + e—(0.5AS+0.5L,L,+0.2JSD) _ 1’ (4)

 

where AS = %§Si,, is the proﬁle-alignment score normalized by the
i=1
query sequence length L following Equation (3). LC, Ls and J SD are
similar to that deﬁned in Equation (1) but with the alignments generated
from the ligand-binding speciﬁc proﬁle—proﬁle comparisons. All proteins
in BioLiP with a qseq score above 0.5 are selected as the putative tem-
plates. If the number of putative templates is below 10, the top 10 tem-
plates with the highest qseq score will be returned for the next step of LBS
selection analysis.

2.3.3 LBS selection by maximum voting The residues on the query,
which are aligned with the binding residues on the templates following the
sequence proﬁle—proﬁle alignments, are assigned as putative binding
residues in the S-SITE prediction. Since the binding sites of different tem-
plates will match with different query residues, a consensus voting scheme is
applied to select the most consensus binding residues. The residues receiv-
ing >25 % votes are considered as the ﬁnal binding residues by S-SITE.
A conﬁdence score CSS is deﬁned for the binding residues:

2 1, (5)

CSS 2 1 + e‘[61233X+0.11n(1+m+0'2JSDsa] —

 

where qgggx is the maximum value of qseq among all the putative tem-
plates, N is the number of the selected templates, JSDSa is the average
Jensen—Shannon divergence score of all the predicted LBS residues. Here,
the conﬁdence score CSS is in a similar format as that of TM-SITE (CS,)
but no clustering is conducted in S-SITE since the templates detected
from the sequence proﬁle comparison are converged in most cases.
Based on the training data, a prediction with CSS> 0.25 has average

false positive and false negative rates below 0.24 and 0.21, respectively.

2.4 Control programs for LBS prediction

Three methods representing different prediction principles are used as
control in this study. First, ConCavity (Capra et al., 2009) is an ab initio
prediction method which identiﬁes LBSs from the surface cavity of the
target structure with score combining residue conservation information.
FINDSITE (Brylinski and Skolnick, 2008) is a template-based approach
which derives the query binding sites from template proteins identiﬁed by
the threading programs (Skolnick et al., 2004). COFACTOR (Roy et al.,
2012; Roy and Zhang, 2012) is a structural comparison approach which
identiﬁes ligand-binding residues by global and local matches of the query

Complementary methods for ligand-binding site prediction

 

and template structures. The ConCavity and FINDSITE are publically
available programs and COFACTOR was developed in our lab. All the
methods are run using default parameters.

2.5 COACH

COACH is a Ensensus approag to LBS prediction that combines the
multiple prediction results of algorithms from TM-SITE, S-SITE,
COFACTOR, FINDSITE and ConCavity, with the architecture pre-
sented in Supplementary Figure S1. To generate a prediction, the query
sequence along with the structure are provided as input and fed into the
individual programs. The top-scoring predictions from each of the pro-
grams are combined using a linear SVM as implemented by the software
SVM-light (J oachims, 2006).

The probability of a residue to be a binding residue is calculated from
individual methods, which are used as the feature vectors for the residue.
For TM-SITE and S-SITE, the probabilities are computed as the con-
ﬁdence score of the ligand cluster or templates (i.e. CS, and CSS) multi-
plied by the ratio of votes on the residue. The probabilities for
FINDSITE and COFACTOR are taken from the default conﬁdence
scores. For ConCavity, the probability is calculated by a linear combin-
ation of the residue conservation score and the distance of the residue to
the predicted binding pockets. Finally, all feature vectors are fed into
SVM to make consensus prediction, with classiﬁers trained on the 400
non-redundant training proteins, which have sequence identity <30% to
the proteins in the test set.

The linear kernel in SVM-light was used with the optimal value of the
cost parameter C selected based on an exhaustive grid search. To avoid
over-training, a 10-fold cross-validation procedure was applied as fol-
lows. The training set was randomly divided into 10 subsets of equal
size, where 9 subsets are used to train the SVM and the remaining
subset was used as validation to calculate the average MCC. For each
parameter C in the grid space, such random sample division was repeated
by 10 times and an overall MCC was calculated as the mean of the 10
average MCCs. The parameter C with the highest overall MCC was
ﬁnally selected for SVM training.

2.6 Evaluation

The LBS prediction results are mainly evaluated by the Matthews
correlation coefﬁcient (MCC), precision and recall:

 

MCC : TPXTN—FPXFN
¢(TP+FP)(TP+FN)(TN+FP)(TN+FN)
. . _  6
prec1s1on _ —TP+FP 9 ( )
_ TP
recall _ —TP+FN

where TP (FF) is the number of true (false) binding residues in the pre-
diction, and TN (FN) is the number of true (false) non-binding residues.
In general, MCC represents a score combining both the accuracy and
coverage of the prediction which has a better balance of both aspects than
the individual precision and recall values. The MCC equation was also
used in the CASP ofﬁcial evaluation for protein—ligand binding site pre-
diction (Schmidt et al., 2011).

Another measure to combine precision and recall is the Area Under the
Curve (AUC) value of the true positive rate versus false positive rate plot, or
the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) plot. This measurement has
been used in another community-wide blind experiment, CAMEO (http://
www.cameo3d.org), for accuracy evaluation. Since MCC and AUC con-
tain similar information, we will mainly use MCC for our benchmark/
training data, and AUC for CAMEO experiment in our data analysis.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Accuracy of the I-TASSER structural models

Because the quality of the receptor models has impact on the
structure-based methods for LBSs prediction, we computed

TM-score and RMSD of the I-TASSER models for the 500
testing proteins. In Supplementary Figure S2, we present the
histogram distribution of the TM-score and RMSD of the ﬁrst
I-TASSER models. It is shown that the majority of the proteins
(290%) can be modeled with a correct fold (TM-score > 0.5) and
65% have a RMSD below 6A, although all close homologous
templates were excluded in the model generations. The average
TM-score and RMSD for the proteins in the test dataset is 0.77
and 6.4 A, respectively. Nevertheless, there are still 38 cases
which have incorrect folds with a TM-score below 0.5, and 176
cases with RMSD higher than 6A. Even in those with a correct
fold, the local structure associated with the LBSs have structural
deviations with an average RMSD=2.8A to the native holo-
structures. These represent a set of models in a typical range of
accuracy of the template-based protein structure predictions
(Zhang, 2009).

3.2 Summary of individual methods

The MCCs for TM-SITE and S-SITE are summarized in ﬁrst
two columns of Table 1. The average MCC score for TM-SITE
is 0.48, with precision 0.57 and recall 0.49, respectively. The
MCC and precision values of TM-SITE are higher than that
of S-SITE (MCC=0.45, precision=0.45 and recall=0.58), al-
though TM-SITE has a slightly lower recall. The difference in the
MCC values is statistically signiﬁcant which has a P—value <10’3
in the Student’s t—test (Supplementary Table S1). This data dem-
onstrate the usefulness of structural information in I-TASSER
models that were taken by TM-SITE for template detection,
while S-SITE is based on the sequence proﬁle comparison. The
higher value of recall in the S-SITE predictions is partly due to
the fact that many S-SITE predictions contain residues from
multiple ligand-binding pockets, since no clustering was per-
formed in S-SITE. The clustering procedure in TM-SITE
increases the speciﬁcity and thus MCC of the predictions. In
S-SITE, since the templates are mostly converged, we found
that the clustering on the S-SITE predictions did not increase
the overall MCC score but there was a slight increase in precision
(0.52) and reduction in recall (0.49).

The TM-SITE predictions also outperform the three other
control methods, with the average MCC value 14% higher
than FINDSITE and COFACTOR, and 84.6% higher than
ConCavity. The P—value in the Student’s t—test is below 10*9 in
all the comparisons (Supplementary Table S1). The precision of
TM-SITE and COFACTOR is similar while the recall of TM-
SITE is higher, which is partly due to the fact that the TM-SITE
prediction is made based on a combination of multiple templates,
while COFACTOR prediction is on a single top-scoring
template. ConCavity’s recall (0.51) is slightly higher than TM-
SITE (0.49), while its precision is very low due to over-predic-
tion, resulting in a low MCC value 0.26.

In Supplementary Figure S3, we present a head-to-head com-
parison of TM-SITE versus the four other methods based on
MCC. Out of the 500 test proteins, there are 345, 354, 347 and
400 cases where TM-SITE has equal or higher MCC than
S-SITE, COFACTOR, FINDSITE and ConCavity, respectively.
Interestingly, although S-SITE has a higher average MCC score
than COFACTOR and FINDSITE, it has similar number of
cases in which it outperforms TM-SITE. This indicates that
the S-SITE algorithm is probably less complementary to

TM-SITE compared to other methods, since several common
terms (including the binding residue coverage and the J SD
score) have been used in both methods for template recognitions.
In addition, the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients (PCC) between
TM-SITE and other methods are reported in Supplementary
Figure S3. TM-SITE has the highest PCC with COFACTOR,
probably because both methods use structural alignment and the
same template library. As expected, ConCavity has the lowest
PCC with TM-SITE as it is a template-free method.

In the lower part of Table 1, we also list the MCC results of
the programs when the experimental structure of the receptor
proteins is used. As expected, the performance of all the struc-
ture-based methods is improved due to the increase of structural
accuracy of the receptor proteins. S-SITE has no change since it
only uses the sequence proﬁle information. Nevertheless, it has a
comparable or superior result than other structure-based meth-
ods from FINDSITE, COFACTOR and ConCavity.

3.3 Why TM-SITE/S-SITE work better than
other methods?

The method with the closest overall performance to TM-SITE is
COFACTOR, but TM-SITE still has an MCC value 14% (using
I-TASSER models) and 10.9% (using experimental structure)
higher than COFACTOR on the 500 tested proteins.

A major advantage of the TM-SITE is the use of the SSFL
residues for structural alignments, which helps increase the sensi-
tivity and speciﬁcity of the template detections, compared to either
the global or local structural comparison taken by COFACTOR.
Figure 2 shows an illustrative example from the phosphatidylino-
sitol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase protein (PDB ID: 2cth),
which has the ligand molecule N-(5-(4-Chloro-3-(2-Hydroxy-
Ethylsulfamoyl)-Phenylthiazole-2-Yl)-Acetamide bound with
Residues S567, W573, 1592, Y628, I640, E641, 1642, V643,
A646, N711, M713, F721, 1723 and D724. We ﬁrst run I-
TASSER which generates the ﬁrst model with a TM-score:
0.74 and RMSD: 19.8 A. Based on the I-TASSER model, the
ConCavity program detects 3 putative binding pockets, each
with more than 15 associated binding residues, which result in
an SSFL deﬁnition from residue M565 to residue P787
(Fig. 2B). Despite the high RMSD of the global I-TASSER
model, the SSFL region has high accuracy with a RMSDSSFL =
3.8 A, which provides an opportunity for the accurate SSFL

structure matches to the structures in BioLiP. Following the
SSFL-based TM-align alignment, seven templates, including
2x6kA, 2x6iA, 2x6jA, 2x6jB, 2x6kB, 3ls8A and 2x6fB, have a
qstr score above 0.65, where 16 binding residues, including
M565, A566, S567, P571, 1592, K594, D602, Y628, 1640, E641,
1642, V643, D645, M713, 1723 and D724, are transferred as puta-
tive LBS residues to the query (Fig. 2E). After the ligand clustering
and the maximum vote, 14 residues receiving >25% votes (M565,
A566, 1592, K594, D602, Y628, 1640, E641, 1642, V643, D645,
M713, 1723 and D724) are eventually selected, which have a CS,
score=0.57, signiﬁcantly higher than the default conﬁdent CS,
cutoff (0.35). This prediction results an MCC score=0.64 with
precision = 0.64 and recall: 0.64, respectively.

COFACTOR uses either the local-binding site or the entire
structure comparison. The former comparison does not result in
signiﬁcant hits since a large number of possible 3D motifs have
been aligned in the query structure which generates similar
scores. The global structure comparison picks up two templates
from 1n38A and 1n3 5A, which have a completely different bind-
ing pocket although they have a similar fold to the query protein.
These hits result in an LBS prediction with an MCC =—0.01 for
COFACTOR, in this example.

Accordingly, ConCavity has selected 76 residues as the bind-
ing residues which also results in a low MCC = 0.32, due to the
low precision value (=0.14) although 11 out of the 14 native LBS
residues are included in the ConCavity prediction. FINDSITE
failed to identify the correct binding residues since most of the
templates have only a weak homology to the query protein and
the threading alignment by FINDSITE selected an incorrect tem-
plate (with a TM-score: 0.26).

The second advantage of TM-SITE is the composite scoring
function balancing both structural and sequence similarities in
the SSFL region which is essential for recognizing the correct
templates and binding sites. One of the major differences be-
tween the scoring functions of TM-SITE and FINDSITE is

that the evolutionary information and local structure similarity
of binding site are not considered in FINDSITE. These two
terms are calculated by Lg and L; in TM-SITE (Equation 1).
If we turned off these two terms, the performance of TM-SITE
would be signiﬁcantly degraded with the average MCC value
reduced from 0.48 to 0.43. Similarly, the JSD score was not
considered in score-function of CAFACTOR although it was
used for initial binding residue screening. If we turned off the
J SD term in Equation 1, the MCC value is also reduced.

In the example of Figure 2, although S-SITE takes a similar
threading approach to FINDSITE, by using the proﬁle—proﬁle
alignment for template screening, it recognizes a set of binding
residues, including M565, A566, S567, P571, 1592, K594, D602,
Y628, 1640, E641, 1642, V643, D645, A650, M713, 1723 and
D724, which has an MCC score (0.64) much higher than
FINDSITE (0.0). A detailed analysis shows that the binding-
speciﬁc conservation scores, including LS and J SD in
Equations (1) and (4), dominate the proﬁle—proﬁle comparisons
and therefore plays an important role in the query-template
alignment selections. We also tried to replace Equations (1)
and (4) by the global structure similarity TM-score and the
threading Z—score, respectively. The performances of TM-SITE
and S-SITE are dramatically reduced by 21% and 59%, respect-
ively. These data demonstrate the extreme importance of a
balanced scoring function combining different effects from
global and local, structural and evolutionary information of lig-
and—protein binding.

3.4 Combination of different methods by COACH

In the last column of Table 1, we list the prediction results of
COACH, which combines the predictions from the ﬁve individ-
ual algorithms using the SVM. The average precision and recall
of the COACH predictions are 0.54 and 0.63, respectively, which
result in an overall MCC=0.54. This MCC value is 12.5%
higher than the best individual prediction from TM-SITE or
107.7% higher than the prediction by ConCavity. The improve-
ments made by COACH are mainly attributed to the comple-
mentary property of the individual component predictors, as
highlighted by the head-to-head comparison between TM-SITE
and other methods shown in Supplementary Figure S3.
Although the best individual prediction by TM-SITE outper-
forms that by other methods for most proteins (see the number
of data points located in the upper triangle), there are still a
considerable number of proteins where TM-SITE performs
worse than others. Thus, a combination of the results provides
the opportunity to pick up the cases that are incorrectly predicted
(mostly having weak scores) by one program but correctly pre-
dicted (mostly having high scores) by others.

Supplementary Figure S4 presents head-to-head comparisons
of COACH versus all individual programs. Indeed, COACH has
dominantly more number of proteins that have a higher MCC
than any of the individual programs. We note that the consensus
approach in COACH is different from most of the meta-server
approaches in the protein structure prediction which are de-
signed to select the models from individual programs (Ginalski
et al., 2003; Wu and Zhang, 2007). Therefore, the ﬁnal model in
the meta-server predictions for a speciﬁc protein should be iden-
tical to that by some individual program. In COACH, however,
the LBS predictions are combined from different programs.

Thus, none of the COACH predictions is identical to that of
the individual programs, which can be seen in Supplementary
Figure S4 whereby there are almost no points on the diagonal
lines of the comparisons. The PCC values between COACH and
other methods are listed in Supplementary Figure S4, which are
approximately associated with the contribution of the compo-
nent methods to COACH. As shown in the ﬁgure, TM-SITE
has the highest PCC with COACH, meaning that it contributes
the most to COACH, followed by COFACTOR, S-SITE,
FINDSITE and ConCavity, respectively.

As shown in Supplementary Table S1, the P—values in the
Student’s t—test between COACH and other methods are all
<10’14, demonstrating that the improvement from consensus is
statistically signiﬁcant.

3.5 Test of COACH in blind experiments

CAMEO (Continuous Automated Model EvaluatiOn) is a com-
munity-wide ligand-binding experiment, which was designed to
evaluate computational methods in a continuous base. Every
week, a set of pre—released sequences from the PDB are collected
and sent to the online service systems with the LBS prediction
generated before the experimental structure is released. The pre-
diction results are evaluated based on the subsequently released
PDB structures. The CAMEO experiment is complementary to
the CASP experiment but has the advantage to assess the parti-
cipating methods on a large number of targets and in a continu-
ous base, whereby the CASP experiment has often too few
targets to draw a reliable conclusion on the ligand-binding pre-
diction (Schmidt et al., 2011). Instead of the MCC score, the
AUC score of the ROC plot has been used by CAMEO for
the evaluation of the LBS predictions.

COACH participated in CAMEO since December 7, 2012.
Figure 3 summarizes the ofﬁcial assessment results of the LBS
predictions by COACH in the last 22 weeks, together with other
7 predictors, which contains results on 1203 released proteins.
The detailed AUC values are listed in Supplementary Table S2,
taken from the ofﬁcial CAMEO website http://www.cameo3d.
org/ligand_binding/weekly_summary.html. Because the number
of targets modeled by different predictors can be different
(Supplementary Table S2), we use the ‘average accuracy’ for
the comparison in Figure 3, whereby COACH has generated

predictions for all the targets. As shown in Figure 3, the COACH
predictions achieve the highest AUC score among all the pre-
dictors in each of the 22 weeks. Overall, the mean AUC of
COACH is 0.87, which is 22.5% higher than the second best
predictor (‘naive _pocket’). We have also made an internal assess-
ment of TM-SITE and S-SITE on the same set of proteins, which
achieves an AUC score 0.82 and 0.78, which are 15.5% and 10%
higher than the ‘naive _pocket’ program, respectively. Again,
TM-SITE outperforms S-SITE in these sets, which demonstrates
the advantage of using structure information over sequence pro-
ﬁles. The AUC of TM-SITE is 10.4%, 12.7% and 64.3% higher
than that of COFACTOR, FINDSITE and ConCavity, respect-
ively, which are consistent with the data in our benchmark tests
although the assessment here is based on AUC whereby the
benchmark analysis was on the MCC values.

In Figure 4, we present four examples of the successful
COACH predictions in the CAMEO experiment for the proteins
bound with four typical categories of ligands (poly-nucleotide,
peptide, organic and ion-like). These examples are from (A)
DNA binding ETS domain of the human protein FEV in com-
plex with DNA (PDBID: 3zp5A); (B) beta’-COP/Insig—2 com-
plex (4j82A); (C) Glutathione transferase homolog from
Lodderomyces elongisporus bound with CIT (4iva); and (D)
R39-imipenem Acyl-enzyme bound with Mg2+ ion (4benA).
The I-TASSER models for the receptors all have correct fold
with a TM-score >05 in these examples (Xu and Zhang,
2010). The BioLiP library contains biologically relevant ligands
of both small molecules (e.g. metal ions and organic molecules)
and big molecules (e.g. nucleotides and peptides); these provide
the opportunity to predict resides bound with various ligand
types through the template-based modeling. As a result, the
ﬁnal models of binding sites have the AUC=0.9, 0.93, 0.97
and 0.97, respectively, which are 32.4%, 52.4%, 27.6% and
73.2% higher than the best predictions from the other server
groups.

3.6 Setting up of online COACH server

An online COACH server is set up and made freely available
at http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/COACH/. To use the
server, users can provide either sequence or 3D structure of the
query protein. If the query sequence is provided, I-TASSER
(Roy et al., 2010) will be used to construct 3D models for the
query, which are then used by the individual COACH programs
for the structure-based LBS predictions. The ﬁnal LBS models
will be created by the SVM-based combinations. If a 3D model
of the target is provided, the structure will be directly used for the
LBS predictions.

Starting from a given 3D structural model, the COACH pre-
diction typically takes ~1—10h depending on the size of the
query proteins. An additional time will be needed for the I-
TASSER structure prediction (~5—20 h), if the users only pro-
vide the sequence. After the prediction is completed, an email
alert is sent to user with instruction to access the results, which
will be kept on the COACH website for 3 months. For each
target, the top 10 COACH predictions are listed, together with
the conﬁdence score, ligand cluster size, the representative
ligand—protein templates, and the consensus LBS residues.
Supplementary Figure S5 shows an illustration of the COACH
results, taken from a snapshot of http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.
umich.edu/COACH/CH000001/. Except for the consensus LBS
predictions by COACH, up to top 5 predictions for the compo-
nent predictors are also summarized in the same web page.

4 CONCLUSION

Accurate identiﬁcation of LBSs is essential to protein function
annotation and drug discovery. Inspired by the fact that no
individual methods can generate the optimal prediction for all
proteins, we have developed two complementary algorithms,
TM-SITE and S-SITE, for protein—ligand binding site predic-
tions. TM-SITE is built on the structural comparison of a
subset of continuously distributed residues associated with the
binding pockets in the query and template proteins, while
S-SITE is based on the binding-speciﬁc sequence proﬁle—proﬁle
alignments. Starting from the low-resolution 3D models gener-
ated by protein structure predictions, the LBS prediction meth-
ods are tested on a set of 500 non-redundant proteins harboring
814 natural, drug-like and metal ion ligands, where the correct
LBSs with an MCC above 0.5 are generated for 302 and 243
cases, by TM-SITE and S-SITE, respectively. Among the suc-
cessful predicted cases, 125 cases are predicted by either TM-
SITE or S-SITE which demonstrate the complementary feature
of the two algorithms.

The methods are controlled with three state-of—the—art meth-
ods from COFACTOR (Roy and Zhang, 2012), FINDSITE
(Brylinski and Skolnick, 2008) and ConCavity (Capra et al.,
2009). The TM-SITE predictions have an average MCC 0.48
which is 14% higher than COFACTOR and FINDSITE, and
84.6% higher than ConCavity; the differences correspond to
P—values <10’11, <10’9, <10’53, respectively, in Student’s t—test.
The detailed data analysis showed that the major advantages of
the methods are attributed to the binding-speciﬁc substructure
alignment search for the template recognition, and the composite
potential appropriately balancing multiple scoring matrices from
both global and local, structural and sequence comparisons.

Complementary methods for ligand-binding site prediction

 

Due to the complementarity of the LBS prediction methods,
the best predictions are shown to be generated by a consensus
of different programs, as collected by a new meta-LBS
predictor COACH which outputs the residue-speciﬁc ligand-
binding probability by the SVM technique. In the same testing
set of 500 non-redundant proteins, COACH generates predic-
tions with the MCC value 12.5% higher than the best individual
algorithms. COACH is also tested in the community-wide
CAMEO experiments, which was ranked as the best method in
each of the past 22 weeks with an overall AUC score of 0.87,
22.5% higher than the second best method from other
predictors.

An online server for COACH has been set up and made freely
available at http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/COACH. As a
meta-server approach, it contains predictions from ﬁve individ-
ual programs from TM-SITE, S-SITE, COFACTOR,
FINDSITE and ConCavity. We plan to update the COACH
server by combining new algorithms when they become avail-
able. In our benchmark test, the COACH program combing
all ﬁve programs indeed outperforms that only combining the
three internal methods from TM-SITE, S-SITE and
COFACTOR with the average MCC increased by ~5%. Thus,
the inclusion of new algorithms will undoubtedly increase the
accuracy and coverage of COACH for protein—ligand binding
site predictions. Such high reliability and robustness with predic-
tions covering various categories of targets is paramount to the
ongoing genome-wide structure-based function annotations.

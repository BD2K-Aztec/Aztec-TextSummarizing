ABSTRACT

Summary: phangorn is a package for phylogenetic reconstruction
and analysis in the R language. Previously it was only possible to
estimate phylogenetic trees with distance methods in R. phangorn,
now offers the possibility of reconstructing phylogenies with distance
based methods, maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood (ML)
and performing Hadamard conjugation. Extending the general ML
framework, this package provides the possibility of estimating
mixture and partition models. Furthermore, phangorn offers several
functions for comparing trees, phylogenetic models or splits,
simulating character data and performing congruence analyses.
Availability: phangorn can be obtained through the CRAN
homepage http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phangorn/index
.html. phangorn is licensed under GPL 2.

1 INTRODUCTION

With more than 20 packages devoted to phylogenetics, the R
software (R Development Core Team, 2009) has become a standard
in phylogenetic analysis (see http://cran.r-pr0ject.0rg/web/Views/
Phylogenetics.html for an overview). However so far it was only
possible to estimate phylogenetic trees with distance methods in R.
The phangorn package permits to estimate maximum likelihood
(ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) trees. Besides reconstructing
phylogenies, the package also focuses on assessing the congruence
of different trees.

2 METHODS

The phangorn package interacts with several other R-packages, especially
with the ape package (Paradis et al., 2004). From ape, phangorn inherits
the tree format (class phylo which has become a standard), which allows
use of the excellent plotting facilities within ape. phangorn deﬁnes its
own data format to store character sequences, but offers functions to convert
between formats from other packages (ape and seqinr) or with common
data structures (data . frame and matrix) in R. The data format is kept
very general allowing nucleotides (DNA, RNA), amino acids and general
character states deﬁned by the user. For example, it is easy to deﬁne a format
for nucleotide data where gaps are coded as a ﬁfth state or for binary data.
All the different ML and MP functions described below can handle these
general character states.

MP is an optimality criterion for which the preferred tree is the tree that
requires the least changes to explain some data. In phangorn, the Fitch

and Sankoff algorithms are available to compute the parsimony score. For
heuristic tree searches the parsimony ratchet (Nixon, 1999) is implemented.
Indices based on parsimony like the consistency and retention indices and
the inference of ancestral sequences are also provided.

The ML function pml returns an object of class pml containing all the
information about the model, the tree and data. The function opt im. pml
allows to optimize the tree topology, the edge lengths as well as all model
parameters (e. g. rate matrices or base frequencies). The speed and accuracy of
phylogenetic reconstruction by ML are comparable to PhyML (Guindon and
Gascuel, 2003) using nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) rearrangements
(see Supplementary Materials). As the results are stored in memory it is
possible to further investigate, plot or summarize these objects. The following
lines compute and display (Fig. 1) a phylogenetic tree based on the data of
Rokas et al., 2003 using a GTR+F(4)+I model (Kelchner and Thomas,
2007):
data(yeast)
tree <— NJ(dist.logDet(yeast))
fit <— pml(tree, yeast, k=4, inv=.2)
fit <— optim.pml(fit, opthizTRUE,
optGamma=TRUE, optInvaRUE, model="GTR")

BS <— bootstrap.pml(fit, opthizTRUE)
plotBS(fit$tree, BS, type="phylogram")

For nucleotide data all models implemented in ModelTest (Posada, 2008)
are available (e.g. "JC" or "GTR"). Moreover any reversible model can
be speciﬁed by the user for different character states. For amino acids, the
main common rate matrices are provided, e. g. WAG (Whelan and Goldman,
2001) or LG (Le and Gascuel, 2008). Additionally rate matrices can also be
estimated. For instance Mathews et al., 2010 used the function opt im . pml
to infer a phytochrome amino acid transition matrix. There are several
methods implemented to compare different ML models with for example
likelihood ratio-tests, AIC or BIC as in ModelTest or the SH-test (Shimodaira
and Hasegawa, 1999).

As phangorn is implemented in the high-level language R it is easy to
extend the general ML framework. phangorn also contains mixture models
(Pagel and Meade, 2004) and partition models. The function pml Part
allows estimation of partitioned ML models and has a ﬂexible yet simple
formula interface. For example, the command pml Part (edge + Q ~

rate + bf, fit) speciﬁes which parameters are optimized in each
partition individually (here the rate parameter and the base frequencies) or
for all partitions together (the edge weights of the tree and rate matrix Q).

phangorn eases the analysis of splits. For instance, the Hadamard
conjugation (Hendy, 2005) is a helpful tool to analyze relations between
observed sequence patterns (spectra) and edge weights. The edge weight
spectra can be constructed from DNA or binary data or from a distance
matrix. These spectra can be Visualized using a Lento plot (Lento et al.,
1995) to present the supporting and conﬂicting signals for the splits of a
dataset (Fig. 2). Splits can easily be exported to SpectroNet (Huber et al.,
2002) or Splitsgraph (Huson and Bryant, 2006) and Visualized as a network.

phangorn is distributed with two tutorials. The ﬁrst explains how to
perform phylogenetic analysis (in R type vignette ( "Trees" )) and the
second vignette ( " phangorn— special s " ) shows how to deﬁne data
with general character states and to estimate rate matrices for those states.
phangorn depends only on other R packages which are also available from
the CRAN repository and is portable to run on different operating systems.
Since phangorn is written in R, results can be easily extended and further
processed using the graphical and statistical capabilities of R.

3 CONCLUSION

phangorn offers a wide range of methods to reconstruct phylogenies,
to compare phylogenetic trees, to test different phylogenetic models
and perform split analysis to evaluate conﬂicting phylogenetic
signal. Moreover the phangorn package provides a ﬂexible
framework for prototyping new phylogenetic methods.

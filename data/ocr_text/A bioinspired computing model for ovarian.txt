Abstract

Motivation: Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in women in the western
world for 2013. In ovarian cancer, benign tumors turn malignant, but the point of transition is diffi-
cult to predict and diagnose. The 5-year survival rate of all types of ovarian cancer is 44%, but this
can be improved to 92% if the cancer is found and treated before it spreads beyond the ovary.
However, only 15% of all ovarian cancers are found at this early stage. Therefore, the ability to
automatically identify and diagnose ovarian cancer precisely and efficiently as the tissue changes
from benign to invasive is important for clinical treatment and for increasing the cure rate. This
study proposes a new ovarian carcinoma classification model using two algorithms: a novel dis-
cretization of food sources for an artificial bee colony (DfABC), and a support vector machine
(SVM). For the first time in the literature, oncogene detection using this method is also
investigated.

Results: A novel bio-inspired computing model and hybrid algorithms combining DfABC and SVM
was applied to ovarian carcinoma and oncogene classification. This study used the human ovarian
cDNA expression database to collect 41 patient samples and 9600 genes in each pathological
stage. Feature selection methods were used to detect and extract 15 notable oncogenes. We then
used the DfABC-SVM model to examine these 15 oncogenes, dividing them into eight different
classifications according to their gene expressions of various pathological stages. The average
accuracyof the eight classification experiments was 94.76%. This research also found some
oncogenes that had not been discovered or indicated in previous scientific studies. The main
contribution of this research is the proof that these newly discovered oncogenes are highly related
to ovarian or other cancers.

1 Introduction

Ovarian cancer is a common gynecological cancer which is the fifth
leading cause of cancer deaths in women in the western world
(Jemal et al., 2002). The overall 5-year survival rate for ovarian
cancer is about 44%, a statistic that has remained unchanged in
America for the past 25 years (Meng, 2014). Ovarian cancer pa-
tients generally go through three major pathological stages: benign,
borderline and invasive. For those whose ovarian cancer is diag-
nosed in the early pathological stage, the survival rate is higher.
However, the transition from a symptomatic benign ovarian tumor
(OVT) to a cancerous malignancy is difficult to diagnose and esti-
mate. CA125 is commonly used for ovarian cancer screening, but its
specificity or sensitivity is insufficient for early detection (Nossov
et al., 2008). Many recent scientific studies have noted that gene ex-
pressions are highly related to the identification of ovarian cancer
stages (Roel et al., 2013; Schwede et al., 2013). In these studies, the
microarray has been used extensively and shown to be a promising
tool. Microarray analysis has revealed specific genes, called onco-
genes, which biological experiments have apparently indicated are
causally related to ovarian cancer. Based on this same analysis, path-
ologists have further observed the variations of gene expressions in
these specific ovarian genes and compared the levels of gene expres-
sion in different pathological stages and conditions. Biological and
statistical computing can be used to represent gene expressions for
such comparisons, particularly during the progressive states as a
tumor transitions from benign to invasive ovarian cancer tissue.
Therefore, gene expression analysis has become increasingly import-
ant because of its excellent performance in both bioinformatics and
biomedical studies of the human genome system.

However, gene expression analysis is a complex process and re-
quires a large dataset in order for enough useful information to be
extracted. Thus, computer-based analysis and classification of dis-
eases can be helpful for diagnostics. The support vector machine
(SVM) is one artificial intelligence method which has recently be-
come popular, mainly because it can process classification and
predication via different core parameters and is more capable of
making predictions using different types of datasets (Chen, 2012,
2014). In addition, the SVM formalism is also a graphical and math-
ematical tool for the design, specification, simulation and verifica-
tion of systems. In recent years, the bio-inspired algorithm has
become increasingly useful as an optimization tool (Chen et al.,
2013). By simulating biologically peculiar social behavior, such as
mating or foraging, bio-inspired algorithms quickly search for the
optimal solution and achieve the effect of stable convergence.
Therefore, this study proposes to apply the parameter optimization
method, i.e. a discretized food source for an artificial bee colony
(DfABC) algorithm, to an SVM model to develop a hybrid DfABC-
SVM classification model which achieves fast convergence and has
good prediction capability when handling complex and varying
types of ovarian cancer datasets. In addition, the proposed model is
compared with those of several pioneering studies regarding ovarian
carcinoma prediction.

The microarray is one of the most important tools for studying bio-
logical expression. It is a novel biological technique for gathering
large numbers of gene expression from cell or tissue samples.
A microarray can help cancer researchers quickly identify genes that
are differentially regulated during cancerous progression, and dis-
cover related oncogenes from diagnosed cancers and other diseases

(Slonim and Yanai, 2009). Because of the large number of gene ex-
pressions in a microarray, dependence on artificial data not only
causes imprecise analysis of the results but also requires that a great
deal of time and money be spent on calculation and classification.
To solve these problems, recent scholars have used statistical, clus-
tering and classification methods to develop algorithms that apply
to microarray analysis (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2010).

Recent studies have developed new feature extraction and classi-
fication methods to detect various oncogenes by mining the micro-
array data of ovarian cancer. Shah and Kusiak (2007) integrated the
genetic algorithm (GA) and SVM to assist in the prediction of ovar-
ian, prostate and lung cancers. The experimental results showed that
the hybrid SVM model had better prediction capabilities than the
traditional decision tree classification method. Lee (2008) developed
a fuzzy model with SVM to predict ovarian cancer. The experimen-
tal results illustrated that the accuracy of the hybrid SVM model sur-
passed that of both regression analysis and the conventional SVM
model. Later, Lai et al. (2009) adopted the SVM technique to de-
velop a bio-statistical system for gene expression analysis, and found
21 notable oncogenes. In addition, the average accuracy of the pro-
posed model is 89% with a cross-validation approach. Using a dif-
ferent strategy, Tsai et al. (2011) integrated an artificial neural
network and t—tests to select more important oncogenes and enhance
the accuracy rate of ovarian cancer prediction. Tung et al. (2012)
applied a hybrid neural fuzzy inference system to the diagnosis of
ovarian cancer. The experimental results showed that the hybrid sys-
tem performed better than both the conventional decision tree and
the neural network model. Therefore, the adoption of SVM and a
hybrid system approach to the classification of ovarian cancer is
straightforward in this research.

3 Research methodologies

3.1 Support vector machine

SVM has recently become a popular artificial intelligence method,
mainly because SVM can process classification and predication
through different kernel functions and suitable parameters. It is also
more capable of predicting different types of datasets. SVM was first
proposed by Vapnik and Cortes in 1995, and has been applied and
improved upon by many scholars in different studies. Chaudhuri
and De (2011) proposed integrating fuzzy set theory into the SVM
model because better prediction results could be obtained via fuzzy
processing of the parameters. Many scholars have also used SVM to
work with other artificial intelligence models to improve its accur-
acy (Sue and Li, 2012).

In the past, the methods for modifying, adjusting and setting
SVM core parameters have been time-consuming and have often not
been objective. In addition, successful parameter settings cannot be
generalized to apply to different types of datasets. Therefore, this re-
search proposes integrating the DfABC parameter optimization
method into the SVM model. The goal is to develop a DfABC-SVM
classification model which results in fast convergence and accurate
predictions, and is capable of handling different types of datasets.

3.2 Artificial bee colony algorithm

The Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) proposed by Karaboga
and Basturk in 2007 is a popular and widely used bio-inspired algo-
rithm derived from observations of the foraging behavior of bees.
During the foraging stage, bees are classified into one of three types:
Employed, Onlooker or Scout. Each type has a different task and
function. The ABC algorithm simulates the pattern and defines half

of the bee group as Employed bees, and the other half as Onlooker
bees. The food source represents the relative optimal solution of the
desired parameter.

a. Employed bee

Among the different kinds of bees, Employed bees are respon-
sible for going to the food source, returning to the hive, and dancing
on a particular area to inform the Onlooker bees regarding the loca-
tion, distance and nectar content of the food source. After one iter-
ation, the Employed bees will find another new food source near the
current food source and compare the fitness values of these two
food sources. In the end, they will select the food source with largest
fitness value. Equations (1) and (2) are the fitness value and calcula-
tion of the new food source, respectively:

fit," 2

1

m (1)
where fit,- is the fitness value of 2th food source and  = 1 — classifi-
cation accuracy. The classification accuracy is the value generated
by the prediction processed after the parameter combinations of
2th food source are substituted into an SVM model. This shows
that the food source fitness value of the first iteration is randomly
generated.

Vii = X") + 0170(2) — ij) (2)

where i represents the location of the current food source and Vi,-
represents the location of the new food source with the ith param-
eter solution. X,,- represents the location of the current food source
with the jth parameter solution. 0,,- is a randomly generated value
between [—1,1]. Xkl- is another food source near to the current food
source and is randomly generated with the ith parameter solution.

b. Onlooker bee

Onlooker bees decide which food source to target based on
the food source information provided by the Employed bees. The de-
cision is made using a probabilistic selection method; that is,
the greater the value of the food source as calculated by probabilistic
selection, the more likely it will be chosen by an Onlooker bee.
The calculation of probabilistic selection is shown here as
Equation (3).

prob,- = 0.9 X  (3)
i=1ﬁtl'

where prob,- is the probability that the ith food source will be
chosen, fit,- represents the fitness value of each food source, and fit,-
represents the fitness value of the ith food source. SN represents the
total number of food sources.

c. Scout bee

The purpose of the Scout bee is to avoid the possibility of bees
falling into a local optimization. Hence, there is one restricting con-
dition. The meaning of this restriction value is that, if the fitness
value of a certain food source has not changed within the restricted
number of iterations, it will be considered as falling into local opti-
mization. When that occurs, the Employed bee will give up this food
source and shift its role to Scout bee to search for a new food source.
Equations (4) and (5) are the calculations for the restriction value
and new food source, respectively:

Limit = SD X D (4)

where SN is the total number of food sources; D is the dimension of
the problem to be solved.

X:- =X’

min

+rand<o.1><X{...x —X’.'.....> <5)

where j is the number of parameters to be optimized [1,2, . . . . . ., j];
X:- is the value of jth parameter of 2th food source; X7min and Xinax
are the lower and upper limits of parameter 7'.

3.3 Discretization of food sources for an ABC

Although ABC is already a stable bio-inspired algorithm, improve-
ments to several aspects of it will significantly increase its parameter
optimization effectiveness. Li et al. (2012) tried to improve the
global optimization of the Employed bee and Onlooker bee in the
ABC algorithm and obtained a good result. Kashan et al. (2012)
also proposed an improved ABC algorithm that is binary-based,
overcoming the original ABC algorithm’s ability to process only
continuous numerical optimizations. In the probabilistic choice
method of the original ABC algorithm, the fitness values of food
sources are easily distributed diversely. Such a distribution greatly
reduced ABC’s divergence speed, especially in conditions when sev-
eral identical excellent food sources exist. If, in the first iteration,
the calculated fitness values of five food sources are within 1%
of each other, directly applying Equation (1) to calculate the second
iteration fitness value will obtain values that are quite close. Under
such conditions, the food sources will tend to clump. Thus, the num-
ber of iterations increases, affecting the convergence speed of the
probabilistic choice stage.

To solve the above problems, this research proposes a new algo-
rithm: a DfABC. The issue of food source fitness values clumping in
certain areas can be solved by classifying the fitness values.
Moreover, this algorithm provides a new way of calculating a prob-
abilistic choice. Food sources that are classified into different areas
will be calculated by different probabilistic choice methods for selec-
tion. The classification and probabilistic choice methods are
described as follows.

Step 1. Discrete distribution of food source fitness values

This step focuses on making the food source fitness values originally
distributed at both ends more discrete, so that fewer food source fit-
ness values are too close, thus resulting in a decrease in iterations.
First, we sort the set of food source fitness values so that larger food
sources are sorted to the front. Next, in accordance with the size of
the food source fitness values, we provide one appropriate weight
value w,, w,- E W to each food source 5,, s,- E S. If the food source fit-
ness values are the same, the given weight values will also be the
same. Finally, we multiply  and w,- to calculate the fitness value of
the new food source dis,-, dis,- 6 Dis. Through this step, food source
fitness values that are too close will be separated. Equation (6) is
used to make the food source fitness values more discrete, as
follows:

dis,- 2  X W,- 

where dis,~= the fitness value of the new food source while  is the
fitness value of the original food source; is the w,- weight value that
varies in accordance with the size of the fitness value of the original
food source.

Step 2. Normalization of the fitness value of new food source dis,-

The ABC algorithm defines the fitness value of a food source as
being between [0,1]; hence, in Step 2 the fitness value of a new
food source is defined to be between [0,1] through normalization.
This attempt uses the common statistical method of normalization

of the maximum/minimum value to adjust the fitness values of all
food sources to be between [0,1] and save the adjusted value 11,- to
the N set, shown here as Equation (7).

dis,- — Min{Dis}

"1 Z Max[Dz's] — Min{Dis} (7)

 

Step 3. Grouping the normalized fitness value of food source 11;

To ensure that an excellent food source is easily selected and
to avoid Onlooker bees choosing a poor food source, this study
processes interval cutting and grouping based on “good” and “bad”
food source fitness values. The distribution of food sources is discre-
tized, and the food source fitness values are distinguished as either
“good” or “bad.” Doing so can avoid the repeated selection of
certain food sources, which, in turn avoids the dilemma of local
optimization. Thus, Step 3 is further divided into two steps.

Step 3.1 Cutting the intervals to m parts

First of all, this research uses the equal-width discretization method
to cut the interval [0,1] of the normalized food source fitness value
ni, ni EN to the imth interval im 6]. The interval distance of each
interval is calculated using Equation (8), and the upper limit 14,-,” of
each interval im is calculated using Equation (9).

Max{N} — Min{N}

Interval_range = (8)
herein Interval_range represents the interval distance (boundary
range) between each group after cutting; m is the number of inter-
vals of food sources; and max{N} and min{N} represents the max-
imum and minimum values of the N set of normalization of food
source fitness values, respectively.

14,-,” = m x Interval_range (9)

wherein 14,-,” represents the upper boundary value of the interval
distance of the mth interval; m is the number of intervals of food
sources; and Interval_range represents the interval distance (bound-
ary range) between each group after cutting.

Step 3.2 Distributing n; to appropriate interval jm

In this step, we distribute the normalized food source fitness value 11,-
to the appropriate interval in accordance with the upper boundary
value of each interval. If n,- is smaller than the upper boundary value
of the first interval, 11,- belongs to the first interval. If n,- is greater
than the upper boundary value of the first interval but smaller than
the upper boundary value of the second interval, 11,- belongs to the
second interval. The rest may be deduced by analogy to distribute
all 11,-.

Step 4. Probabilistic calculation

This step is to apply the grouped, normalized food source fitness
value 11,- to different probabilistic choice methods to calculate the
probability that a given 11,- will be chosen. First, we determine the
best interval 14,-1 of food source fitness values and provide it with
the best probabilistic choice method. Next, we select a few groups
(g groups) of good food source fitness values and apply a suitable
probabilistic choice method. The remaining food source fitness val-
ues will be discarded.

Step 5. Obtain the better probabilistic set

The above steps generate one set of better probabilistic choice values
of food sources, which is to be used for the next iteration so that
better food sources can be quickly obtained. This increases conver-
gence speed and avoids local optimization. By repeatedly running

the above steps until we reach the maximum number of iterations,
we will find the optimal parameter combination for this model.

4 Experimental design and results

4.1 Dataset

A cDNA microarray is a kind of biochip, which includes fluores-
cence spots to represent the expressions of many known genes. Each
labeled fluorescence spot is denoted as a gene and is obtained by
hybridizing the test and reference sample labeled with Cy3 and Cy5,
with the gene expressions represented as the ratio of Cy3 and Cy5
ﬂuorescence intensity. In this article, all gene expressions have been
digitalized as numerical data from cDNA microarrays. The ovarian
cDNA expression database used in this article was provided by the
surgical and pathological units at China Medical University
Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. All microarrary procedures were per-
formed in a dust/climate-controlled laboratory at the China Medical
University. The gene expression database contains 9600 gene ex-
pressions obtained from the ovarian tissues of 41 patients at differ-
ent pathology stages and collected over 2001—2003, defined by
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classifications as
benign OVT (13 samples), borderline tumors (BOT—6 samples),
ovarian cancer at stage I (OVCA-I—7 samples) and ovarian cancer
at stage III (OVCA-III—15 samples). Despite the small sample popu-
lation, 9600 genes/chip were obtained for each sample, thus provid-
ing sufficient data for analysis. A sequence-verified human cDNA
library containing 9600 human cDNA clones was provided by the
National Health Research Institute of Taiwan. The clones were ori-
ginally obtained from the Minimum Information About a
Microarray Experiment (MIAME) consortium libraries through its
distributor (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL; Brazma et al.,
2001). In addition, given the high cost of the biochips, the results
can be considered as representative. Table 1 summarizes the detailed
dataset of ovarian carcinoma, and the appendices provide partial
datasets. Appendix A represents the gene expressions from the lst to
27th genes of these 41 patients, with rows representing individual
patients and columns representing each gene expression. Appendix
B represents the gene expressions from the 95 75th to 9600th genes
of these 41 patients.

4.2 Feature extraction

This study’s experimental gene expression database includes many sam-
ples at OVT, BOT, OVCA—I and OVCA-III stages. Based on the distri-
butions of expressions at different cancer stages, this article divides the
15 genes into 8 different classifications, each with a specific goal:

1. Classiﬁcation I (C1): to predict each stage throughout the entire
dataset.

2. Classiﬁcation II (CH): to predict only the OVT stage throughout
the entire dataset.

3. Classiﬁcation III (Cm): to predict only the BOT stage throughout
the entire dataset.

4. Classiﬁcation IV (CIV): to predict only the OVCA-I stage
throughout the entire dataset.

5. Classiﬁcation V (CV): to predict only the OVCA-III stage
throughout the entire dataset.

6. Classiﬁcation VI (CV1): to predict the OVT and BOT stages of
ovarian carcinoma, as opposed to the other stages (OVCA-I,
OVCA-III), throughout the entire dataset. We believe it is very
important to investigate which key gene will inﬂuence the ovar-
ian carcinoma to progress from the OVT stage to the BOT stage.

7. Classiﬁcation VII (CV11): to predict the BOT and OVCA-I stages
of ovarian carcinoma, as opposed to the other stages (OVT,
OVCA-III), throughout the entire dataset. We believe it is very
important to investigate which key gene will inﬂuence the ovar-
ian carcinoma to progress from the BOT stage to the OVCA-I
stage.

8. Classiﬁcation VIII (CVHI): to predict the BOT and OVCA-III
stages of ovarian carcinoma, as opposed to the other stages
(OVT, OVCA-I), throughout the entire dataset.

Selected features are important in enhancing the performance of
ovarian carcinoma classification and oncogene detection. After
applying the feature selection methods [ID3, J48, Information Gain
(IG)], this study obtained the significant features listed in Table 2
for the input variables of the proposed DfABC-SVM model.

4.3 Comparative study

The proposed DfABC-SVM model and other AI approaches were
developed in MATLAB R2009 on a PC (Intel I7 six-core CPU, 4 G
RAM, Windows 7 OS). Throughout the initial experiment, the par-
ameter values used in the proposed DfABC-SVM were set as fol-
lows. The ratio of the training and testing datasets of the model was
7:3. Furthermore, the clusters (m) of the DfABC-SVM was set as
5 of these 8 classifications. The number of iterations was set to
500 rounds, and it can also finish the training if the fitness reach the
convergence.

We constructed and tested our proposed DfABC-SVM model.
The test results are summarized in Tables 3—5. These three tables
summarize the experimental results of a conventional SVM model
and three hybrid bio-inspired computing methods for comparison:
the GA-SVM (Genetic Algorithm), PSO-SVM (Particle Swarm
Optimization) and ABC-SVM (Artificial Bee Colony) models. Our
proposed DfABC-SVM model was shown to successfully predict
ovarian cancers: the accuracy rates for different classifications were
all higher than 83.3%. The prediction performance with training
and testing dataset are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.

In Classification I, the proposed DfABC-SVM model performed
better than all other competitors, with a prediction accuracy rate of
91.6% when classifying ovarian cancer from the entire dataset.
From Classification II to Classification V, the proposed DfABC-
SVM model also outperformed all competitors when classifying
ovarian cancer for each stage (from OVT to OVCA-III), with an
average prediction rate higher than 83.3%. In addition, the pro-
posed model outperformed its competitors in regards to the ID3 fea-
ture selection method. From Classification VI to Classification VIII,
the goal was to investigate prediction accuracy within the hybrid
stages, and it was also important to know which gene would be the
key factor influencing the development of ovarian cancer. As the
experimental results show, the prediction accuracy of the proposed

IG feature selection method. Therefore, from these results we con-
clude that the proposed DfABC-SVM model is a good reference
model for predicting ovarian cancer.

This research presents several key findings regarding the implica-
tions and determinants of ovarian cancer prediction:

tions fewer than other methods but still obtains highly-accurate
ovarian cancer predictions.

2. Experimental results show our proposed bio-inspired computing
approach has a high average accuracy rate of 94.76% for

4. This study empirically demonstrated that a bio-inspired comput-
ing approach achieved better prediction accuracy than other
evolutionary approaches, such as GA or PSO. Furthermore, bio-
inspired computing approaches have rarely been used for predic-
tion, especially in the biomedical domain or for ovarian cancer.

5 Genes discussion and implications

As shown in Table 2, the average expression of gene STAT2 is
remarkable at Classifications II, VI, VII and VIII. Classification II is
the OVT stage. Classification VII includes the BOT and OVCA-1
stages of ovarian carcinoma, as opposed to other stages (OVT,
OVCA-III). STAT2 is a member of the STAT family which is
involved in cytoplasmic transcriptional activators and signal trans-
ducers. It is activated to regulate gene expression in response to
cytokines, interferons and growth factors. After phosphorylation by
the receptor associated kinases, activated STAT2 forms a hetero-
dimer with Stat1 and translocates to the nucleus for regulating the
transcription of many different genes. According to relevant biolo-
gical studies, STAT2 is also significantly related to colorectal, skin,
cervical and breast cancers (Liang et al., 2012; Uluer et al., 2012).

The average expression of gene GNB1 is especially significant at
Classifications II, IV and VII. Classification IV is specifically the
OVCA-I stage of ovarian carcinoma. GNB1 is a subunit of the heter-
otrimeric G-protein and integrates signals between receptors and
effector proteins such as modulators or transducers in various
transmembrane signaling systems. It is a key player in the mem-
brane-mediated signal transduction cascade and has been recently
found to be associated with breast cancer pathology measure-
ments and ovarian cancer outcomes (Fridley et al., 2014; Wazir
et al., 2013).

The average expression of gene ZNF509 is especially significant
at Classification II. Localized to the nucleus, ZNF509 is a Kruppel
Csz-type zinc finger protein that contains a DNA-binding domain
and may play a role in transcriptional regulation (Siggs and Beutler,
2012).This study marks the first time that ZNF509 has been shown
to have any connection to cancer.

The average expression of gene NMT2 is especially significant at
Classification 1111, i.e. the BOT stage of ovarian carcinoma. Cloned

from a human liver library, NMT2 catalyzes the myristoylation of
proteins and diversifies their biological functions in signal transduc-
tion and oncogenesis (Selvakumar et al., 2007). NMT2 activity and
protein expressions are higher in human colorectal cancer, gallblad-
der carcinoma and brain tumors (Selvakumar et al., 2007).
Attenuation of NMT2 activity may prove to be a novel therapeutic
protocol for cancer.

The average expression of gene POFUT1 is especially signifi-
cant at Classification IV. POFUT1 adds O-fucose through an
O-glycosidic linkage to conserved serine or threonine residues in
EGF domains, and plays a critical role in the Notch signaling path-
way which regulates cell growth, differentiation and cancer metasta-
sis (Hu et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013). Recent studies have shown
that POFUT1 is significantly upregulated in oral cancer (Yokota
et al., 2013).

The average expression of gene PAPPA is especially significant at
Classification VI, i.e. the OVCA-III stage of ovarian carcinoma.
PAPPA is a plasma metalloprotease involved in regulating the activ-
ity of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signal pathway via the
cleavage of IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). Recent reports reveal
that overexpression of PAPPA could promote ovarian and lung
cancer cell tumorigenicity in vivo, thereby establishing a novel
tumor growth-promoting role for PAPPA (Boldt and Conover,
2011; Pan et al., 2012).

The average expression of the gene COL1A2 is especially signifi-
cant at Classification VI, i.e. the OVT and BOT stages. COL1A2
is the fibrillar collagen found in most connective tissues. It can
strengthen and support many tissues in the body, such as cartilage,
bone, tendon and skin. Type I collagen is the most abundant form in
the human body. Several mutations in this gene are associated with
multiple diseases. It also plays an important role in tumor develop-
ment. Some studies have related COL1A2 to colorectal, hepatocellu-
lar and breast carcinomas (Loss et al., 2010).

The average expression for gene CXCL12 is also especially re-
markable at Classification VI. The stromal cell-derived factor 1,
known as C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12), is a chemokine
protein and plays a role in many diverse cellular functions such as
tumorgenesis, metastasis, inﬂammation response and angiogenesis.
Multiple transcript variants encode different isoforms for this gene.
CXCL12 has recently been shown to be related to breast, ovarian,
colon, pancreatic and prostate cancers (Obermajer et al., 2011;
Popple et al., 2012).

The average expression of gene ARHGAP20 is also especially
significant at Classification VI. Expressed primarily in the brain,
ARHGAP20 belongs to the Rho protein family and is involved in
the regulation of Rho-type GTPases, an enzyme that catalyzes
the hydrolysis of GTP. It is a direct downstream target of Rap1 and
induces inactivation of Rho, resulting in neurite outgrowth
(Yamada et al., 2005). ARHGAP20 has recently been reported as a
tumor suppressor gene in human breast cancer and B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (Herold et al., 201 1).

The average expression of gene PFKFB3 is also especially
remarkable at Classification VI. PFKFB3 has the highest kinase/
phosphatase activity ratio of all PFK-2 isoforms, consistent with
its role as a powerful activator of glycolysis. It is known to
be activated by mitogenic, hypoxic and inflammatory stimuli.
Importantly, PFKFB3 protein expression is elevated in most tumor
types. Silencing of PFKFB3 in tumor cells reduces tumor cell gly-
colysis and growth (Calvo et al., 2006). In particular, high expres-
sion of the PFKFB3 protein product was noted in lung, breast,
colon, prostatic, pancreatic and ovarian adenocarcinomas (Clem
et al., 2013).

The average expression of gene Bc12 is especially significant at
Classification VII, which includes the BOT and OVCA-1 stages
of ovarian carcinoma. An integral outer mitochondrial membrane
protein, Bcl-2 is the founding member of the Bcl-2 family, and regu-
lates programmed cell death or apoptosis. Bcl-2 family members
have been widely implicated in cancer. Bcl-2 is often classified as an
oncogene because of its specific anti-apoptotic property by prevent-
ing the activation of the caspases. The concept that impaired apop-
tosis is central to tumor development is now widely embraced.
Some studies, have related BCL2 to ovarian, prostate, colorectal,
liver and lung cancers (Shirali et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2011a, b;
Zhao et al., 2012).

The average expression of gene DHX9 is especially remarkable
at Classification VII. DHX9 belongs to the DEXH family of helicase
superfamily 2, and performs critical functions for unwinding dou-
ble-stranded DNA and RNA driven by the hydrolysis of ATP in a 3’
to 5’ direction. It also serves as a transcriptional activator and plays
a critical role in RNA metabolism. Recent evidence has suggested
that DHX9 plays an important role in the regulation of immune
responses (Zhang et al., 2011a, b). Furthermore, some studies have
reported that dysregulation of DHX9 expression is related to lung
and breast cancers (Jain et al., 2013).

The average expression of gene CCND3 is especially significant
at Classification VIII, i.e. the BOT and OVCA-III stages of ovarian
carcinoma. CCND3 is a member of the cyclin protein family
involved in regulating cell cycle progression and shows the most
broad expression pattern of the D-type cyclins. Its activity is
required for the regulation of the G1/S phase transition of the cell
cycle. Furthermore, high levels of CCND3 have been related to a
poor prognosis for several types of cancer, including melanoma,
lymphoma and bladder carcinomas (Beltran et al., 2012; Schmitz
et al., 2014).

The average expression for gene SMAD2 is also especially sig-
nificant at Classification VIII. SMAD2, known as Smad family
member 2, has been found to be activated by TGF-b. It forms
heteromeric complexes with SMAD4 and regulates multiple signal-
ing pathways, such as cell proliferation, differentiation and
apoptosis.SMAD2 has recently been reported to be associated
with gastric, colorectal and lung cancers (Fleming et al., 2013;
Liu et al., 2012).

The average expression of gene MTMR2 is also especially
remarkable at Classification VIII. MTMR2 is a protein tyrosine
phosphatase which removes phosphate groups from substrates and
modifies their activity. Mutations in the gene MTMR2 are respon-
sible for severe autosomal recessive peripheral neuropathies, such as
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B1 (CMT4B1; Luigetti et al.,
2013). This study marks the first time that MTMR2 has been shown
to have any connection to cancer.

6 Conclusion

In this study, a novel bio-inspired computing model and hybrid
algorithms of DfABC and SVM were applied to the classification
of ovarian carcinoma and the prediction of oncogenes. The aver-
age accuracy of predicted target oncogenes in eight classifications
was over 94.76%. According to the literature, 13 oncogenes are
reportedly related to various cancers, and five genes (PAPPA,
CXCL12, PFKFB3, GNB1 and Bcl-2) are associated with ovarian
cancer at different pathologic stages. In addition, two oncogenes
(ZNF509 and MTMR2) are first time to associate with the
cancer.

This research seeks to develop a new bio-inspired algorithm to
quickly search for specific ovarian cancer biomarkers, which is typ-
ically a laborious process, and the resulting specificity and sensitivity
is typically insufficient for the early detection of ovarian cancer.
Improving the survival probability for ovarian cancer patients re-
quires the precise location of efficient tumor markers as tumors tran-
sition from benign to invasive. Thus, future work will focus on
confirming the expressions of these genes using experimental meth-
ods such as real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochem-
istry. We believe that our discovery of new stage-specific genes can
allow for the development of a rapid screening platform for onco-
genes and thus improve early diagnosis of various types of cancer.

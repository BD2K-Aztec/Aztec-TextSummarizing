ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein phosphorylation, driven by specific recognition
of substrates by kinases and phosphatases, plays central roles
in a variety of important cellular processes such as signaling and
enzyme activation. Mass spectrometry enables the determination of
phosphorylated peptides (and thereby proteins) in scenarios ranging
from targeted in vitro studies to in vivo cell lysates under particular
conditions. The characterization of commonalities among identified
phosphopeptides provides insights into the specificities of the
kinases involved in a study. Several algorithms have been developed
to uncover linear motifs representing position-specific amino acid
patterns in sets of phosphopeptides. To more fully capture the
available information, reduce sensitivity to both parameter choices
and natural experimental variation, and develop more precise
characterizations of kinase specificities, it is necessary to determine
all statistically significant motifs represented in a dataset.

Results: We have developed MMFPh (Maximal Motif Finder for
Phosphoproteomics datasets), which extends the approach of the
popular phosphorylation motif software Motif-X (Schwartz and Gygi,
2005) to identify all statistically significant motifs and return the
maximal ones (those not subsumed by motifs with more fixed
amino acids). In tests with both synthetic and experimental data,
we show that MMFPh finds important motifs missed by the greedy
approach of Motif-X, while also finding more motifs that are more
characteristic of the dataset relative to the background proteome.
Thus MMFPh is in some sense both more sensitive and more
specific in characterizing the involved kinases. We also show that
MMFPh compares favorably to other recent methods for finding
phosphorylation motifs. Furthermore, MMFPh is less dependent on
parameter choices. We support this powerful new approach with a
web interface so that it may become a useful tool for studies of kinase
specificity and phosphorylation site prediction.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein phosphorylation plays Vital roles in numerous key cellular
processes including the regulation of enzyme activation and protein
localization and degradation, as well as the propagation of signals

through pathways that control higher-level cellular activities such
as proliferation, migration, differentiation and death (Cohen, 2000;
Ficarro et al., 2002; Manning et al., 2002; Turk, 2008). The
importance of phosphorylation is underscored by the fact that
15—25% of eukaryotic genes encode kinases (Manning et al. , 2002).

Investigations into phosphorylation have been greatly enhanced
by the advent of high-throughput mass spectrometry, which
enables large-scale phosphoproteomics studies identifying peptides
phosphorylated under particular conditions (Kettenbach et al. , 2011;
Matsuoka et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2011). Such sets of identiﬁed
phosphopeptides in turn provide information about the speciﬁcities
of the kinases involved, revealing common patterns of amino acids
underlying speciﬁc kinase-substrate recognition. Databases such as
Phospho.ELM (Dinkel et al., 2010), PhosPhAt (Heazlewood et al.,
2008) and PHOSIDA (Gnad et al., 2007, 2011) collect sets of
identiﬁed phosphopeptides for different kinases, and have enabled
the development of methods to predict and classify kinase-substrate
relationships, e. g. Scansite (Obenauer et al. , 2003), NetPhosK (Blom
et al., 2004), GPS (Xue et al., 2005), KinasePhos (Wong et al., 2007)
and NetPhorest (Miller et al., 2008).

In general, a phosphoproteomics study provides the opportunity
to identify kinases that might be present in a sample, as
well as to characterize the speciﬁcities of the kinases. Since
a phosphoproteomics dataset can contain a large number of
phosphopeptides produced by a mixture of different kinases, a
typical ﬁrst step is to aggregate and summarize the phosphopeptides
in a manner that reveals more general patterns of phosphorylation.
Phosphorylation motifs represent common amino acids up- and
down-stream from an identiﬁed phosphorylation site. For example,
if we see a number of phosphopeptides with a proline two residues
before a phospho-serine and an arginine immediately following the
phospho-serine, we could summarize them with the motif Px§R
(where ‘x’ indicates that any amino acid is allowed). A position-
speciﬁc scoring matrix could further reﬁne such a motif, indicating
the frequencies of amino acids at the non-ﬁxed positions (e. g. if that
‘x’ tended to be an acidic residue). Matching such summaries against
databases then provides evidence that particular kinases have been
active, while the amino acid patterns of the motifs give additional
insights into the kinase speciﬁcities.

Several motif—ﬁnding algorithms for phosphoproteomics have
been developed, taking advantage of the fact that a motif is
anchored by a phosphorylation site, to do better than more
general motif ﬁnders (e. g. those employed to identify transcription
factor motifs). The basic problem was ﬁrst addressed by Motif-X
(Schwartz and Gygi, 2005), which employs a greedy algorithm to
incrementally build up a motif from statistically over-represented
position/amino acid pairs. Motif-X was demonstrated to identify

MMFPh

 

protein phosphorylation motifs including validated substrates and
new motifs from HeLa cell nuclei mass spectrometry dataset
and tyrosine phosphorylation immunoafﬁnity datesets, and to
outperform a number of general-purpose motif-ﬁnding algorithms.
It has been employed in subsequent studies including sumoylation
site prediction (Xue et al., 2006) and phosphoproteomic analysis
of organisms including mouse (Villen et al., 2007), Drosophila
(Zhai et al., 2008) and yeast (Wilson-Grady et al., 2008).
MoDL (Ritz et al., 2009) adopted a fundamentally different
approach, formulating the problem as one of compactly encoding
the phosphorylated peptides, and employing an information—
theoretic approach to ﬁnd a good encoding. It was demonstrated
to successfully uncover compact sets of informative motifs,
both known and novel, in several published human and mouse
phosphoproteomic datasets. Motif-All (He et al., 2011) employed
a data mining approach to uncover all motifs that have sufﬁcient
support and are statistically signiﬁcant under an odds ratio
assessment. The approach was demonstrated on the PhosPhAt
database of Arabidopsis phosphorylation sites. Most recently, F-
Motif (Chen et al., 2011), an approach that incorporates clustering
into the Motif-X-style iterative, greedy selection of motifs and
reduction of foreground, was demonstrated to outperform Motif-X
and MoDL on four synthetic datasets extracted from Phospho.ELM
and a large-scale experimental dataset from mouse.

We present here an approach called MMFPh (Maximal Motif
Finder for Phosphoproteomics) that pursues the Motif-X goal
of identifying motifs comprised of over-represented amino
acid/position pairs, but does so by performing a complete search
instead of making greedy choices. Thus MMFPh identiﬁes all
statistically signiﬁcant, sufﬁciently frequent motifs, while Motif—X
(and likewise F-Motif) may miss some due to greedy choices and
foreground reduction. The greedy approach is justiﬁable in cases
of a few kinases with distinct speciﬁcities, though we show that
even there it can miss motifs; this problem can only get worse with
larger sets of phosphopeptides or with highly overlapped motifs.
Furthermore, we show that the complete approach is much more
stable over the choice of the key parameter, the minimum occurrence
threshold. As its name suggests, MMFPh returns only those motifs
that are maximal, not subsumed by motifs with more ﬁxed amino
acids, as for example §P would be by RX§P. This ensures that
in addition to being more sensitive, we are also in some sense
more speciﬁc. We show that the relative coverage by maximal
motifs (occurrences in the phosphopeptides versus the rest of the
proteome) can be better than that of the non-maximal ones. However,
recognizing that a more general motif (e. g. g P) might capture some
of the identiﬁed phosphopeptides not matching the more speciﬁc
motifs (e.g. Rx§ P), we also reassess for the possibility of a residual
motif among the unmatched phosphopeptides (e. g. those with an g P
but not the up-stream R).

To summarize our contribution, MMFPh is a complete approach,
identifying all maximal, statistically signiﬁcant and sufﬁciently
frequent motifs. Its completeness and maximality stand in contrast to
Motif—X and F-Motif, and result in better speciﬁcity and sensitivity.
MoDL pursues a different goal, but to some extent (as demonstrated
by (Chen et al., 2011)) these contrasts carry over, as MoDL can
miss important motifs, as well as make speciﬁcity and sensitivity
trade-offs. While Motif-All also seeks completeness, it employs a
different signiﬁcance assessment from that of Motif—X, rendering
it harder to directly assess the importance of completeness. It also

does not restrict to maximal motifs and does not identify residual
motifs. The conference publication of Motif-All (He et al., 2011)
did not rigorously demonstrate its utility. In contrast, we use
both synthetic datasets and large-scale experimental datasets to
thoroughly substantiate the importance of completeness (including
biologically relevant speciﬁcities missed by greedy methods),
characterize relative coverage of data versus background, and assess
stability over parameter choices. In some cases, the differences
between MMFPh and Motif-All do not matter much if at all.
However, in others, they apparently lead to Motif—All ﬁnding many
more motifs than MMFPh, and many more than are biologically
supported. Furthermore, Motif-All can require substantially more
time to ﬁnd the motifs. Finally, in contrast to both MoDL and
Motif-All, we provide a convenient web server so that the wider
community may easily ﬁnd, characterize and Visualize motifs
present in phosphoproteomics datasets.

2 METHODS

MMFPh takes as input a foreground dataset of phosphorylated peptides,
along with a corresponding background set of phosphorylatable peptides.
The goal is to ﬁnd motifs capturing patterns of amino acids that are over-
represented in the foreground relative to the background.

We represent a motif in terms of a set of ﬁxed amino acids at nearby
positions up- and down-stream from a phosphorylation site. For example,
the motif m: {(—2, P),(0, S),(+1,R)} has a phosphorylated S, with a ﬁxed
P two positions up-stream and a ﬁxed R one position down-stream. We
index a motif with a position to obtain the ﬁxed amino acid type there; e. g.
m_2 = P. If a position is not speciﬁed in the motif, then any amino acid is
acceptable. We write this as x (rather than the more formal I); e. g. m_1 = x.
For simplicity, we often write a motif as a string with the phosphorylation site
underlined and x in each unspeciﬁed position; our example is thus Px§R.

We assess three aspects of motif over-representation: frequency, statistical
signiﬁcance and maximality. The ﬁrst two are as in Motif-X (Schwartz
and Gygi, 2005): the motif must appear a sufﬁcient number of times in
the foreground, and its ﬁxed amino acids must be surprisingly abundant in
the foreground according to a binomial model based on the background.
In addition, we require a motif to be maximal, in that no other motif is
extended from it. For example, if we identiﬁed Px§R, we would not also
identify Px§ or §R. The two more general motifs might have attained their
over-representation from the more speciﬁc one, and would also appear in
many more background peptides (potential false positives). We would only
want to return Px§ along with Px§R if the former were over-represented
when we excluded the peptides of the latter; i.e. if Px§[-IR] were over-
represented (‘-I’ is logical not, here indicating that any residue other than R
is allowed at +1). Thus after ﬁnding the initial maximal motifs (here, ngR),
we reassess the non-maximal motifs to see which can yield maximal residual
motifs (here, Px§[-IR] and [-IP]x§R).

Figure 1 summarizes the MMFPh approach, and the following subsections
detail the main steps.

2.1 Preprocessing

The foreground is a set of experimentally determined phosphopeptides, each
with an indicated phosphorylation site. MMFPh rebuilds and/or truncates
each peptide to a speciﬁed length of 2d + 1, with d residues (defaulting
to 6) up-stream and d more down-stream from the phosphorylation site.
Alternatively, a preprocessed set of peptides of this format can be directly
provided. MMFPh rebuilds with respect to a speciﬁed proteome, by searching
for each peptide in a list of proteins. In the case of ambiguity (i.e. two or more
proteins contain the same peptide), it simply uses the ﬁrst. If a reconstructed
peptide is duplicated, only one copy is kept.

Fig. 1. Maximal motif ﬁnder for phosphoproteomics datasets (MMFPh). The
foreground and background peptides have been preprocessed to peptides of
uniform length, in a ﬁxed window around the (potential) phosphorylation
sites. An iterative cycle grows motifs by testing each possible extension
by ﬁxing one more amino acid in a motif discovered in a previous cycle.
In the example, we are attempting to extend the motif §P. We see among
the foreground peptides containing this motif some A at —1 (indicated by
the yellow cell), even more P at —2 (orange cell) and still more K at +3
(red cell). The extensions (—2, P) and (+3, K) are over-represented relative
to the expected number predicted by a binomial distribution based on the
ﬁltered background, but (—1,A) is not. In general, all frequent, statistically
signiﬁcant extensions are added to the queue. We return all maximal motifs
(those for which there is no extension), and reassess the non-maximal to ﬁnd
maximal residual motifs (those that are frequent and statistically signiﬁcant
among the peptides that do not contain their extensions)

The background is a set of peptides that are potentially phosphorylatable,
each again of length 2d+1 and centered at a serine, threonine or tyrosine.
Typically the background set is constructed by scanning a speciﬁed proteome
for all such peptides. Alternatively, an empirical background can be provided,
e. g. a set of peptides collected from other mass spectrometry runs. Empirical
background peptides are reconstructed as described for the foreground. For
both proteome-based and empirical backgrounds, only a single unique copy
of each peptide is kept.

2.2 Motif growing

Figure 1 summarizes the ﬂow of our algorithm; detailed pseudocode is
provided in the Supplementary Material (Algorithm 1). We maintain a
queue Q of motifs to grow, initially just the center (phosphorylated) serine,
threonine or tyrosine. At each iteration, we dequeue a motif m and ﬁlter the
foreground and background to these peptides containing it (i.e. matching
each of its ﬁxed positions), giving F ’ and B’ . We then consider each possible
extension of m to include an amino acid a at a non-ﬁxed position i, and check
whether the extension is sufﬁciently frequent and statistically signiﬁcant.

Frequency: the number cm of occurrences of amino acid a at position i in
the ﬁltered foreground F ’ must be sufﬁciently large, at least a user-speciﬁed
threshold 00cc.

Statistical signiﬁcance: the probability of observing cm occurrences of a
at i in F ’ must be sufﬁciently small, at most a user-speciﬁed threshold 051g,
according to a probability model derived from the distribution of amino acids
at i in the ﬁltered background B’ . We employ the same binomial probability
model as Motif-X (Schwartz and Gygi, 2005); we write it here as:

P<x;n,p)=Z(:)pk<1—p)"—k (1)
k=x

where x is the number of occurrences out of n (here cm out of IF’ I), with
a background probability of p (here the background count dig out of IB’ |).
We note that the threshold Osig should be set sufﬁciently low to account for
multiple hypothesis testing.

If these tests are satisﬁed, the extended motif is added to the queue unless it
has already been there. Note that there are multiple ways to grow to a motif of
more than one ﬁxed position (e.g. g —> Px§ —> Px§R or g —> §R —> ngR).
If none of the possible extensions is added to the queue, the original motif
is maximal; otherwise, it is non-maximal and will be reassessed (below) for
a possible residual motif upon excluding its extensions.

In summary, MMFPh explicitly considers all extensions at each iteration,
and evaluates them with respect to all the foreground and background
peptides that contain the motif. Thus, unlike the greedy approach of Motif-X,
it is complete and guaranteed to ﬁnd all signiﬁcant maximal motifs.

2.3 Residual motif identiﬁcation

As discussed above, we only want to return maximal motifs, as they are more
speciﬁc than the motifs from which they are extended. But the more general
non-maximal motifs may also appear in some foreground peptides that do
not contain the more speciﬁc extensions. To account for that possibility,
we reassess the non-maximal motifs to see if, after excluding the peptides
containing their extensions, they are frequent and statistically signiﬁcant (the
same criteria as in the growing algorithm). Detailed pseudocode is provided
in the Supplementary Material (Algorithm 2).

To reassess a non-maximal motif, we ﬁrst ﬁlter the foreground and
background to contain only these residues not containing its (maximal)
extensions. We then essentially re-do the growing of the motif, ensuring that
each extension used to build it remains sufﬁciently frequent and statistically
signiﬁcant among the remaining peptides. We look at each such extension
(position and amino acid) separately; if any is valid, then the motif is residual.
The test is the same as in the growing algorithm—ﬁlter the foreground
and background and then count and test the number of occurrences of the
extension.

We store maximal residual motifs in a separate set from maximal non-
residual motifs. In the results, we either write them using the ‘not’ notation
illustrated above, or rely on the context of the extensions to indicate which
ﬁxed amino acids are eliminated.

2.4 Scoring

In sorting through the identiﬁed motifs, it is helpful to have an overall score
assessing each. While Motif-X scores a motif by summing the negative
logarithm of the binomial probability of each of its ﬁxed positions, that is not
appropriate here because, as we have discussed, there may be multiple ways
to grow a motif and thus multiple different such scores. Instead, we use a
score that is similar to log-odds (Krogh, 1998), assessing the degree of over-
representation of the motif in the foreground relative to the background.
Rather than estimating position-speciﬁc probabilities, we simply use the
numbers of occurrences of the entire motif in the foreground and background:

F’/F
, c (2)

B /Bc
where, as above, F ’ and B’ are the ﬁltered foreground and background,
respectively, according to the motif m. Since we separately consider S, T

and Y motifs, we ﬁlter the initial foreground according to the center residue
(F c and BC).

Score(m) = log

 

2.5 Clustering

We use hierarchical clustering to organize the motif results and help show
‘meta—motif’ patterns. Each pair of motifs is globally aligned by the algorithm
of (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970), forcing phosphorylation sites to align
to each other. We employ a scoring model that includes an independent
gap penalty (default —8) and standard substitution matrix (e. g. Blosum—62)
extended with scores for the ‘x’ positions (default: x to x scores 0, while x

MMFPh

 

to a ﬁxed amino acid scores —4). We then employ average-linkage clustering
based on these pairwise alignments.

2.6 Implementation and web server

The MMFPh motif-identiﬁcation algorithm is implemented in platform-
independent Java SE 1.6. Post-processing scripts generate logos (Schneider
and Stephens, 1990) with WebLogo (Crooks et al., 2004) and visualize
the hierarchical clusters with Jalview (Waterhouse et al., 2009). We
have implemented a web interface, available at www.cs.dartmouth.edu/
~cbk/mmfphl, via which users can specify a foreground dataset and set
the parameters controlling the motif identiﬁcation and post-processing.

3 RESULTS

To demonstrate MMFPh’s utility in uncovering motifs, we present
a series of tests with both synthetic and experimental data.

3.1 Synthetic datasets

We ﬁrst applied MMFPh to synthetic datasets so that we know
a form of ‘ground truth’—the speciﬁc kinases giving rise to
the phosphorylated peptides. To this end, we use the benchmark
synthetic datasets from the Motif-X and F—Motif papers, augmenting
the results provided there with results for MMFPh and the other
new method Motif-All. We compare and contrast the results from
the different methods below, and provide lists of identiﬁed motifs
in Supplementary Material 1 (Spreadsheet 1). As we discussed,
MoDL (Ritz et al. , 2009) pursues a somewhat different problem and
thus would require a different metric for comparison, so we do not
benchmark against it here. For consistency, we use the backgrounds
speciﬁed in the F-Motif paper. We use the default 10‘6 as the
signiﬁcance threshold, 20 as the occurrence threshold for MMFPh,
Motif—X and Motif-All, and G = 15, T = 15 for F-Motif.

3.1.1 Five designed motifs Five motifs (RxgxxP, RxgxxI,
K§xxxI, TngxE and Dxx§QxN) were planted in a foreground
in a manner such that other discovered motifs can be treated as
false positives (Schwartz and Gygi, 2005). As Table 1 summarizes,
MMFPh outperforms the other methods, ﬁnding all the true positives
and only six false positives. F—Motif missed a number of the true
positives and found a large number of false positives. Motif—All
found even more false positives, 11 of which are extensions of the
planted motifs but 87 of which are unrelated to the planted motifs.
In addition, Motif—All took 27 min to discover these motifs, whereas
MMFPh required only 15 sec.

3.1.2 Phospho.ELM single-kinase datasets Separate foreground
datasets for four different kinases (PKA, PKC, CK2 and CDK) were
generated from Phospho.ELM, using either the substrates reported
for all species or restricting them to human proteins (Chen et al.,

Method True positives False positives
MMFPh 5 6
Motif-X 5 7
Motif-All 5 98
F-Motif 2 26

 

2011). Following our standard protocol, we removed duplicates in
these datasets before performing motif analysis. Corresponding all—
species or human-only backgrounds were used.

Table 2 enumerates the numbers of different motifs discovered
by the different methods. In almost every dataset, MMFPh found
additional novel or more speciﬁc motifs than Motif—X and F—Motif.
For example, for PKA, MMFPh found RxRxxg, which was missed
by Motif-X and F—Motif due to the greedy approach and foreground
reduction, eliminating peptides covered by the motif RRx§ which
happened to have been found before RxRxxg. Similarly, for CDK,
MMFPh found Px§ P, which Motif-X missed by ﬁnding §PxK
beforehand. (In both cases, MMFPh found both motifs.) For PKC,
MMFPh found two previously reported motifs missed by the others:
§xxR and §F (Nishikawa et al., 1997), and for CK2, it found more
speciﬁc extensions of §xxE and several additional novel motifs
with down-stream D and E. Overall, MMFPh missed eight motifs
found by Motif—X or F—Motif, four of which were replaced by more
speciﬁc extensions and the rest of which were deemed statistically
insigniﬁcant (and found by the other methods due to the order-
dependent foreground reduction). Motif-All found all the motifs
from the other methods, but in the all-species dataset also found a
very large number of extra motifs (as we observed with the designed
motifs). Most of these do not appear to be particularly informative;
e. g. whereas other methods found at most 3 motifs for CDK, Motif—
All found 29, and for CK2, almost half of their 33 motifs are with
a single up- or down-stream D or E, deemed insigniﬁcant under our
scoring.

3.1.3 Phospho.ELM mixture A foreground was constructed
(Schwartz and Gygi, 2005) from 43 ATM substrates, 184 Casein
II substrates, 41 CaMK II substrates and 30 MAPK substrates, as
deposited in Phospho.ELM. With either a human-only or all-species
background, Motif-X was reported to ﬁnd six motifs and F-Motif
seven motifs.

With either background, MMFPh found 11 motifs, including 5
more speciﬁc extensions of the motif §xxE, a potential Casein II
motif with the critical E at position 3 and additional acid residues
down-stream (Kuenzel et al. , 1987). MMFPh did not ﬁnd the motifs

§P (MAPK) and Rxx§ (CamK II). This is due to the imbalance in
the number of occurrences of different kinase-speciﬁc peptides in
this artiﬁcially constructed dataset—it does not include consistently
representative levels of the diversity of peptides for each, leading
to statistical insigniﬁcance of the less-represented motifs within
the entire foreground. We note that the greedy reduction step
enabled recovery of these under-represented motifs only because
their speciﬁties are distinct. Motif—All found 22 motifs, in either
background, and missed §P. Most of its additional motifs, which
were insigniﬁcant under the binomial model, simply placed a single
D or E at the various up- and down-stream positions.

3.2 Experimental phosphoproteomics datasets

We have applied MIVIFPh to a variety of phosphoproteomics
datasets. We summarize here results on three previously studied
datasets from other labs, and then do a more detailed case study
on one of our own datasets. Detailed motif lists are provided in
Supplementary Materials 2 (Spreadsheet 2 for data from other labs;
Spreadsheet 3 for our case study).

We compare against the well-established Motif-X method
(Schwartz and Gygi, 2005), to enable evaluation of the importance
of complete versus greedy searches (the key difference between
the two approaches). To ensure that we control for implementation
details other than the search method, we implemented an option in
MMFPh to enable it to perform the Motif-X greedy search; we call
this version GrMFPh (Greedy Motif Finder for Phosphoproteomics
datasets). We have used GrMFPh with a variety of different
datasets and found only minor differences between its results
and those of Motif-X, presumably due to different background
proteomes and some small undocumented implementation details.
Here we use a background based on the Human IPI database
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/IPI/IPIhuman.html).

3.2.1 Distinct phosphorylation sites of CDK1 substrates We
tested MMFPh and Motif-X on the dataset from (Holt et al., 2009),
which had 547 distinct phosphorylation sites (15mers). We set
900c=20 and Gsig=10_6. Table 3 (right) lists the motifs found by the
two methods: GrMFPh found eight motifs and MMFPh found all
those plus ﬁve additional ones extending the fairly general g P to be
more speciﬁc (still deeming the residual motif to be signiﬁcant). The
minimal consensus motifs reported in the paper, g P, EP, §PxK and
EPxK, were found, but an additional preference for R down-stream
was not found.

3.2.2 DNA damage-regulated phospho-SQ and TQ sites We
rebuilt the 905 DNA damage-regulated phospho-SQ and TQ sites
from (Matsuoka et al., 2007) to 13mers and applied both GrMFPh
and MMFPh at 90cc=20 and 931g: 10‘6. Table 3 (right) lists the
identiﬁed motif. GrMFPh found eight motifs. Of these, MMFPh
returned three as maximal signiﬁcant, identiﬁed more speciﬁc
extensions for another three while deeming the general motif to
be signiﬁcant as a residual motif, and replaced the ﬁnal two with
more speciﬁc extensions (deeming the more general motif not to be
signiﬁcant as a residual motif). In particular, MMFPh motifs provide
more speciﬁc characterizations of up- and down-stream D and E (e. g.
EQE in addition to EQ), along with enrichment of S around §Q sites
(e.g. Sx§Q and §QGXS) as described in the original publication.

3.2.3 TCR-responsive phosphorylation sites We compared
GrMFPh and MMFPh on a compilation of TCR-responsive

phosphorylation sites from (Mayya et al., 2009). In that paper,
the foreground and background were examined for occurrences of
putative motifs for seven kinases. In contrast, Motif—X and MIVIFPh
work in the ‘opposite’ direction, extracting signiﬁcant motifs from
the given dataset. After preprocessing the dataset of 21mers, we
obtained 5297 S-centered, 1028 T—centered and 164 Y—centered
unique phosphorylation sites. To match the fairly general motifs
from the paper, we increased the occurrence threshold to ~6% of
the foreground size, to 900c=300 for S-centered and 90cc=60 for
T—centered peptides. N0 Y—centered motifs were found, even with
an occurrence threshold of 10.

GrMFPh found 11 motifs (6 S-centered and 5 T—centered),
whereas MMFPh found 72 motifs (55 S-centered and 17 T—centered),
including 10 of the GrMFPh ones (deeming the ﬁnal motif found
by GrMFPh to be insigniﬁcant, perhaps an artifact of the greedy
reduction step). The GrMFPh motifs cover 10 of the putative motifs
explored in the paper, whereas the MMFPh motifs cover 12. All
other putative motifs are either statistically insigniﬁcant or contain
few instances in the dataset. The additional MMFPh motifs include
more speciﬁc extensions with up- and down-stream D and E. They
also include several motifs that are potentially representative of other
kinases; e.g. Dxx§ of CK1 (Pulgar et al., 1999), §PxxS of GSK—3,B
(Fiol et al., 1987; Hardt and Sadoshima, 2002) and Rxxx§ of (Arora
et al., 2010). Moreover, MMFPh’s results cover all the S-centered
dataset and 75% of T—centered dataset, whereas Motif-X covers only
78% and 65%, respectively.

3.2.4 NCI—H23 non-small cell lung cancer cells dataset Finally,
we perform a case study analysis of a set of 14 769 phosphopeptides
from NCI—H23 non—small cell lung cancer cells (Kettenbach and
Gerber, 2011). After preprocessing, this represents 9817 unique
13mers. We used the default signiﬁcance threshold of 10‘6. We
ﬁrst present some motifs discovered at an occurrence threshold of
100 (roughly 1% of the dataset), and then characterize trends over
a range of thresholds.

Discovered motifs at an occurrence threshold of 100 One of the
reasons to ﬁnd motifs is to identify which kinases may be active

Fig. 3. Logos for two residual motifs identiﬁed by MMFPh

within the conditions underlying a dataset. MIVIFPh ﬁnds a number
of motifs that are supported by previous literature as capturing the
speciﬁcities of particular kinases; some are illustrated in Figure 2.
For example, the substrate of Dyrkla is believed to include an
R at positions —2 or —3 and a P at position +1 (Campbell and
Proud, 2002; Himpel et al., 2000). Pim1 and Pim3 both prefer to
phosphorylate S and T with R or K at positions —3 and —5 (Hutti
et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2008). Casein kinase II has been found to
phosphorylate peptides with the motif SDxE (Tuazon and Traugh,
1991). An Rxxi motif consistent with protein kinase A (PKA)
substrates (Shabb, 2001) was also found. We note that GrMFPh
misses three of these seven motifs.

In addition to growing maximal motifs, MMFPh reassesses motifs
that have been extended, to see if the residual motifs (explaining
the peptides not containing its extensions) are maximal. Most such
motifs (e.g. SP, RxxS and SxE) are deemed insigniﬁcant with
respect to their more speciﬁc extensions. However, one interesting
residual motif (Figure 3, left) is the MAPK1 motif PxSP, also
extended to SxPxS P. This motif is highly overlapped with the
two Dyrkla motifs, which indicates that MMFPh has the ability to
identify similar motifs. Another interesting residual motif (Figure 3,
right) is SxxxSP, which was extended to SPxxSP. (Note that
GrMFPh does not ﬁnd either of these.) In addition to the P, the
+1 position also has a (smaller) preference for R and L, rendering
the residual motif signiﬁcant. These motifs may be capturing
substrates of GSK—3,B, which phosphorylates such peptides in
various transcription factors, such as c-Jun, c-myc, L—myc and the
microtubule—associated protein tau (Chen et al., 1999; Hanger et al.,
1992; Litersky et al., 1996; Yang et al., 1993).

Fig. 4. Hierarchical clustering of MMFPh motifs from the NCI—H23 dataset

previously described motif, may help reﬁne our understanding of
the speciﬁcity of various kinases. The richness of the MMFPh
motifs relative to the GrMFPh motifs supports this endeavor.
MMFPh found a total of 225 motifs, listed in Supplementary
Materials 3 (Spreadsheet 3). Figure 4 summarizes these motifs
within a hierarchical clustering (Blosum—62, x:x=0, xzﬁxed=—4,
gap=—8), providing logos for some of the sub-trees. For example,
our Pim1/Pim3 and PKA motifs (Figure 2) are in the second cluster,
along with other motifs that have up-stream R/ K preferences and
no down-stream ones. Our Dyrkla motif is in the following cluster,
along with others that prefer P at +1 and have some up-stream
preferences. The ﬁnal two clusters concentrate on down-stream
speciﬁcities, such as with our casein kinase II motif.

We compared the motifs identiﬁed by MMFPh with those
identiﬁed by GrMFPh. Table 4 summarizes the number of motifs
found by each algorithm (and of those, how many the other
algorithm also found), categorized by number of ﬁxed positions
in addition to the phosphorylation site. The vast majority of the
225 MMFPh motifs at 90cc=100 have 2 ﬁxed positions; 18 have
1 (all T-centered); and 3 have 3. GrMFPh ﬁnds a total of 37
motifs, roughly equally split between one and two ﬁxed positions.
GrMFPh ﬁnds only 3 of MMFPh’s one-position motifs, 21 of its
two-position motifs, and none of its three-position motifs. Whereas
MMFPh only returns a few of GrMFPh’s one-position motifs (all
T-centered), that is because it extended all of the one-position S-
centered motifs to more speciﬁc two-position motifs, and found only
ﬁve residual motifs (ExP, PxS P, S PxxxP, S PxxS and SxxxS P) to
be signiﬁcant under reassessment. The single two-position GrMFPh
motif missed by MMFPh is S PxxR. Upon further investigation, this
appears to be an artifact of extending SP with the greedy method.
While only 238 of the 3225 SP peptides contain the R (failing
the signiﬁcance test), the greedy reduction step has eliminated
many of the peptides that match motifs discovered during previous
iterations, leaving 112 of 939 SP peptides that contain the R, which
is signiﬁcant.

Each cell indicates a number of motifs. Columns specify numbers of
ﬁxed amino acids. Rows specify MMFPh motifs, MMFPh motifs also
found by GrMFPh, GrMFPh motifs and GrMFPh motifs also found by
MMFPh.

In general, motif identiﬁcation seeks to compactly represent
the common amino acid patterns in the foreground dataset. We
say that a phosphopeptide is covered if it matches the pattern
of at least one motif; the number of covered phosphopeptides
then serves as a measure of sensitivity. For the NCI-H23 dataset,
87% of the phosphopeptides are covered by MMFPh motifs, while
slightly more, 90%, are covered by GrMFPh motifs. This is because
MMFPh ﬁnds more speciﬁc motifs; as we discussed above, it
extends 12 of the GrMFPh one-position motifs to two-position
motifs and deems the residual motifs not to be maximal upon
reassessment. Supplementary Table 1 provides coverage statistics
for all the non—maximal GrMFPh motifs versus their MMFPh
extensions. In most cases, the extensions cover roughly the same
set of foreground peptides. For example, the non—maximal GrMFPh
motif SxxxE has 17 MMFPh extensions; these include 3 each at
positions +1 and +2, 2 each at positions +5 and +6, and one
extension at each of various other positions. Atotal of 936 of the 963
original phosphopeptides match at least one of these 17 extensions.

We can likewise characterize the coverage of background
peptides. As might be expected, in general, the extended MMFPh
motifs cover fewer background peptides than the non—maximal
motifs from which they are extended (Supplementary Table 1).
In cases where MMFPh extensions cover less foreground, such as
KxxS which is extended only to KxxS P, the marked improvement
in reduced background coverage might be worth it, here giving a
roughly ﬁve—fold improvement in the ratio between the size of the
covered foreground and that of the covered background.

Stability analysis Both MMFPh and GrMFPh require setting
a minimum occurrence threshold 9000 for the number of
phospopeptides covered by a motif. For MMFPh, this is with respect

to all foreground peptides; with GrMFPh, for those remaining
uncovered by previously identiﬁed motifs. Consequently, the choice
of this parameter has relatively little effect on MMFPh compared
with GrMFPh. We ran both MMFPh and GrMFPh with occurrence
thresholds ranging from 100 (%1% of the foreground) to 1000
(N10%). Figure 5 summarizes the trends. We see that requiring
more occurrences shifts MMFPh from motifs that have more ﬁxed
positions to those that have fewer ﬁxed positions, but that cover
roughly the same foreground phosphopeptides. The coverage is
extremely stable over most of the range, only decreasing much
with very large thresholds (as would be expected). GrMFPh, on the
other hand, shows a strong dependence on the exact setting of the
parameter. It ﬁnd mostly motifs with a single ﬁxed position, and
simply ﬁnds fewer and fewer of them with an increased threshold,
and thereby rapidly degrades in foreground coverage.

In practice, it may be hard to decide a priori upon a proper value
for 90cc. An advantage of the MIVIFPh approach is that identiﬁed
maximal motifs are independent in terms of their coverage. Thus
maximal motifs identiﬁed at one occurrence level persist at any
higher level, up to their actual number of occurrences. (Residual
motifs are, however, dependent, and must be reassessed.) Thus
our implementation supports a scan over a range of thresholds,
presenting trends as in Figure 5, and allowing the user to drill down
and examine motifs at a level that strikes a desired balance in the
trends (number of motifs, ﬁxed positions).

In this dataset, the 200-occurrence level makes a good contrast
with the 100-occurrence level that we have characterized so far. As
detailed in Table 4, most of the two-position motifs do not meet
the higher threshold and are replaced by one-position motifs, all
of the three-position motifs are dropped in favor of two-position
motifs, and some of the one-position are dropped. Some new motifs
are introduced; e.g. SxD had 9 extensions at 9000 = 100 covering
652 of its 772 instances and thus did not pass reassessment, but
it had 0 extensions at 200. Whereas the 200-occurrence motifs
are less speciﬁc than the 100-occurrence ones, they still cover
the foreground equally well (Figure 5, right). Finally, we again
ﬁnd (Supplementary Table S2) that the maximal MMFPh motifs
cover most of the foreground covered by the non—maximal GrMFPh
motifs that they extend, and often much less of the background.
In particular, whereas non-maximal SP has a large number of
extension with about the same coverage, most of the other non-
maximal motifs have only a few extensions, and sacriﬁce a bit of
foreground coverage for a 2- to 4-fold improvement in the ratio of
foreground to background coverage.

We also studied the stability of the motif-ﬁnding results under
variation in the statistical signiﬁcance level or the background

proteome. The results are as would be expected and easily
summarized, thus provided in the Supplementary Material (Fig. S1).
The tighter the signiﬁcance threshold, the lower the foreground
coverage. GrMFPh is relatively more stable to 931g as it tends to
ﬁnd motifs with just one ﬁxed position at a very tight threshold.
Subsetting the background even to 25% of the original proteome has
little effect on the motifs found and their coverage (Supplementary
Fig. S2).

4 CONCLUSION

We have developed and demonstrated a new method, MMFPh, that
identiﬁes all signiﬁcant maximal motifs in a phosphoproteomics
dataset, to summarize the data and help identify involved kinases
and characterize their speciﬁcities. Tests with both synthetic and
experimental datasets demonstrate the importance of employing
a complete search rather than a greedy search, obtaining better
speciﬁcity, sensitivity and stability to parameter choices. To enable
the wider community to take advantage of this approach, we provide
a web server that ﬁnds motifs, aggregates and summarizes the
supporting peptides, and presents logos and hierarchical clusters
to aid analysis.

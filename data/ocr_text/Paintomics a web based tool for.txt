ABSTRACT

Motivation: The development of the omics technologies such as
transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics has made possible
the realization of systems biology studies where biological systems
are interrogated at different levels of biochemical activity (gene
expression, protein activity and/or metabolite concentration). An
effective approach to the analysis of these complex datasets is
the joined visualization of the disparate biomolecular data on the
framework of known biological pathways.

Results: We have developed the Paintomics web server as an easy-
to-use bioinformatics resource that facilitates the integrated visual
analysis of experiments where transcriptomics and metabolomics
data have been measured on different conditions for the same
samples. Basically, Paintomics takes complete transcriptomics and
metabolomics datasets, together with lists of significant gene or
metabolite changes, and paints this information on KEGG pathway
maps.

Availability: Paintomics is freely available at

1 INTRODUCTION

Biological research in the post-genomics era has been characterized
by the extensive use of omics technologies. The general availability
of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics platforms,
together with the development of user-friendly data analysis
solutions (Da Wei Huang and Lempicki, 2008; Medina et al., 2010)
has boosted the adoption of high-throughput approaches towards
the understanding of the relationships between the genome and
the phenotype. Integrated approaches that combine transcriptome,
proteome and metabolome proﬁling have gained popularity and
have proven to provide novel insights in the understanding of the
biological systems (Cho et al., 2008; Heijne et al., 2005; Kolbe
et al. , 2006). A ﬁrst approach to the interpretation of complex omics
experiments is the joined Visualization of the data on templates that
collect previous knowledge. Graphical display is an effective tool to
assist human reasoning and when different layers of biomolecular
activity are presented in the context of the biological pathways they
operate, much can be gained at the interpret ability of these large
datasets.

To date, the number of bioinformatics tools that offer integrated
Visualization of omics datasets is limited. KaPPa—View (Tokimatsu
et al., 2005) and MapMan (Thimm et al., 2004) are plant-speciﬁc
tools that display metabolite and transcript levels on predeﬁned
pathway blocks. The MassTRIX software (Suhre and Schmitt—
Kopplin, 2008) translates NMR spectra into metabolic compounds
and maps them into KEGG pathways together with genome
information. The tool is specially suited for exploring the metabolic
repertoire of sequenced genomes but does not incorporates gene
expression measurements. A recent development is ProMeTra
(Neuweger et al., 2009) that accepts pre—computed and custom-
made pathway maps in scalable vector graphics (SVG) format
and is able to display dynamics data. The application is restricted
microbial genomes and offers direct access to different omics
experimental databases. Although these tools make an interesting
use of Visualization strategies, we found that available resources
are either restricted to speciﬁc biological domains and/or have
limitations for representing omics measurements.

We have developed Paintomics to provide a simple but effective
resource for integrated Visualization in genomics studies where
transcriptomics and metabolomics data are generated on the same
set of samples. Basically, the application accepts gene expression
and metabolite quantiﬁcations and displays data on KEGG maps.
The main distinctive features of Paintomics are: painted KEGG
maps supported for a large range of organisms; joint Visualization
of different types of omics data, displaying both signiﬁcant and
non—signiﬁcant changes; computation of pathway enrichment based
on both transcriptomics and metabolomics data; interactive images
with link-outs to KEGG info and experimental values; and easy to
download mapped data for further analysis. Paintomics is available
at http://www.paintomics.0rg.

2 THE PAINTOMICS APPLICATION

Paintomics is a platform-independent web application built on Perl
and Python scripts running on an Apache web server. A simple
web-form requires users to upload gene expression and metabolite
concentration ﬁles, optionally provide lists of signiﬁcant features,
and indicate the organism under study. Paintomics directly supports
over 100 top species of different biological kingdoms and offers user
the possibility to request any other organism present in the KEGG
database. Once data are submitted, Paintomics parses input ﬁles to
match gene identiﬁers and metabolite names to the KEGG database.
Generally, Paintomics will accept EntrezGene ID, although for a
number of species different identiﬁers are supported. Regarding
metabolites, ambiguity frequently exists for the assignment of
supplied compound data and KEGG metabolite names. In this case,

metabolites), while increased concentrations are found on the second part of the pathway (red-colored metabolites). Black entry boxes represent signiﬁcant

regulation.

the user is prompted to manually assign compounds to KEGG
descriptions or let the application choose the closest name(s). In
the next step, the application will show matching results for the
submitted data. A general summary is presented with the number of
genes and metabolites of the selected species present in the current
KEGG database version, the number of features matched by the
input ﬁles and how many of those were labeled as signiﬁcant. This
summary gives users a broad feeling of the coverage achieved by
the submitted data. Additionally, a per-pathway table is presented
with matched and signiﬁcant ﬁgures for both genes and metabolites
together with the P-Value of pathway enrichment based on the
Fisher’s exact test. This table is sortable by any of its columns
to facilitate browsing of the pathways according to the user main
interests. The user can then select which speciﬁc pathways to paint.

Pathways are painted locally at the Paintomics server overlaying
the users data on the KEGG image templates using SVG technology.
At each matched feature, a box is painted with as many sections as
columns present in the input ﬁles, each section colored according to
its correponding expression or concentration value. This aids in the
Visualization of different samples (conditions or a time course) on
the same image. Signiﬁcant features are highlighted by a black box

and gene names are shown for all proteins present in the indicated
organism. Images retain KEGG link-outs to gene and compound
records to fully beneﬁt from up-to-date pathway information. For
browsers supporting SVG technology, additional interactivity is
available such as box enlargement and display of actual numerical
values on mouse pass-over. Images can be downloaded in different
formats with a simple click, as well as all matching information
used to paint each speciﬁc pathway. In order to offer reliable
information, Paintomics database is automatically updated on a
monthly basis.

3 USE CASE

To illustrate the usage and knowledge discover facilitated by
Paintomics, we used the tool to analyse a recent study of Arabidopsis
thaliana that surveyed metabolomic and transcriptomcis changes on
Arabidopsis leaves in response to manipulation of the thiol-disulﬁde
status (Kolbe et al., 2006). This study aimed at the understanding
of the role of redox signals in the regulation of metabolic processes.
Gene expression and metabolic data were downloaded from the
publication site. The dataset contained 6390 named genes and

90 metabolites comprising sugars, amino acids and organic acids.
Signiﬁcant genes were selected as those with at least a 2-fold
expression change, while the list signiﬁcant metabolites was directly
obtained from the author’s analysis.

Paintomics was fed with data ﬁles and run with default
parameters, selecting A. thaliana at the species check-box. A total
of 60 pathways where obtained with at least one matching entry.
From the Visual analysis of these maps, conclusions on the co-
regulation of transcripts and metabolites can be drawn. For example,
citric acid map shows the down-regulation of the ﬁrst part of the
pathway (citrate, isocitrate, cis-asconitate and 2-0x0glutarate), while
metabolites on the second part (malate, fumarate and succinate)
had increased levels (Fig. 1). These changes were accompanied
by the signiﬁcant upregulation of genes on this second half of
the cycle such as citrate synthase (CSY3), malate dehydrogenase
(PMDH2) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH2-2), pointing to a
coordinated activity of genes and metabolites. Connections between
the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and the pyruvate metabolism
additionally reveal a decrease in pyruvate and phosphoenol
pyruvate levels upon DTT treatment, which was accompanied
by a signiﬁcant upregulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
(IAR4), malate dehydrogenase (IDH2) and phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxilase (PCKl) enzymes that catalyze the conversion of these
compounds toward acetyl-CoA, oxolacetate and ﬁnally malate.
Interestingly, this pattern of metabolite balance at the TCA cycle was
also observed by the authors although their transcriptomics analysis
did not reveal any signiﬁcant changes of genes in these pathways.
These results led authors to postulate that changes in ﬂuxes and
metabolite concentrations in these pathways were most likely due of
post-translational mechanisms. The integrated Visualization offered
by Paintomics did reveal the coordinated state of transcript and
metabolite levels.

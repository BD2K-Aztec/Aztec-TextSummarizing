ABSTRACT

Motivation: In early drug development, it would be beneficial to
be able to identify those dynamic patterns of gene response that
indicate that drugs targeting a particular gene will be likely or not
to elicit the desired response. One approach would be to quantitate
the degree of similarity between the responses that cells show when
exposed to drugs, so that consistencies in the regulation of cellular
response processes that produce success or failure can be more
readily identified.

Results: We track drug response using fluorescent proteins as
transcription activity reporters. Our basic assumption is that drugs
inducing very similar alteration in transcriptional regulation will
produce similar temporal trajectories on many of the reporter proteins
and hence be identified as having similarities in their mechanisms of
action (MOA). The main body of this work is devoted to characterizing
similarity in temporal trajectories/signals. To do so, we must first
identify the key points that determine mechanistic similarity between
two drug responses. Directly comparing points on the two signals
is unrealistic, as it cannot handle delays and speed variations on
the time axis. Hence, to capture the similarities between reporter
responses, we develop an alignment algorithm that is robust to noise,
time delays and is able to find all the contiguous parts of signals
centered about a core alignment (reflecting a core mechanism in drug
response). Applying the proposed algorithm to a range of real drug
experiments shows that the result agrees well with the prior drug
MOA knowledge.

1 INTRODUCTION

The ability to measure the abundance and degree of modiﬁcation of
many macromolecules in cells has allowed researchers to examine
cells for molecular characteristics that indicate susceptibility to
particular drugs (Chen et al., 1991; Scherf et al., 2000; Sirota
et al., 2011). This approach has produced a number of very
useful guidelines to the use of therapeutics; however, it has failed

in instances where the drug induces changes in the type and/or
abundance of proteins that either pump drugs out of the cell or
allow the drug—targeted activity to be provided in an alternative
way that is not affected by the drug (Sergina et al., 2007; Yusuf
et al., 2003). For these reasons, the ability to examine the molecular
dynamics of cells’ responses to drugs becomes of primary interest.
In addition, identifying dynamic patterns will help to detect whether
drugs targeting a particular gene produce the desired response. One
possible way to achieve this goal would be to develop a way to
quantitate the degree of similarity between the responses that cells
show when exposed to drugs, so that consistencies in the regulation
of cellular response processes that produce success or failure can be
more readily identiﬁed.

1.1 Analysis of gene transcription dynamics

A considerable amount of research using ﬂuorescent proteins as
transcription activity reporters has examined transcription in living
cells in both single—cell and multicellular organisms (Chalﬁe et al.,
1994; Hunt—Newbury et al., 2007). Since ﬂuorescent imaging can
be performed in ways that do not destroy cells, ﬂuorescent reporters
are very effective tools when studying the time evolution of gene
expression. Inserting DNA cassettes with a particular promoter
driving expression of a ﬂuorescent protein into egg cells or partially
differentiated intermediate cells in ways that allow the cassette to
become incorporated in the cell’s genome allows one to follow
that cell and its daughter cells’ developmental course. This kind
of information can be used to specify in which cell types and in
how many cells a speciﬁc gene is active throughout the stepwise
course of development and provides clues to gene function. By
using a very similar approach on cells with reporters responding
to drugs, it is possible to determine which and how many cells are
altering the transcription level of a given gene during the course
of the cell population’s response to the drug. As cells’ responses to
drugs can take days to run their course, it is expected that a drug
that mobilizes a change in the transcriptional regulation of a gene
or genes in a cell will produce a distinguishable temporal trajectory
of change in both the level of transcriptional change in cells and
the number of cells showing altered expression level in a population
of treated cells. It is further expected that sets of drugs that induce
the same or a very similar alteration in transcriptional regulation
will produce similar temporal trajectories on many of the reporter
proteins, allowing them to be identiﬁed as having similarities in their
mechanisms of action (MOA).

Drug alignment

 

Note that this trajectory is conditioned by the presence and activity
status of the gene product that the drug is targeted to interact
with, as well as those gene products affected by the activity of
the targeted gene. This contextual conditioning insures that the
temporal trajectories induced by a drug at a speciﬁc dose will only
be highly similar across cells having highly similar contexts of the
drug responsive genes. Similarly, a second drug targeted to the same
gene would be expected to provoke a highly similar response at a
dose of similar potency in any of the set of cell lines that respond
similarly to the ﬁrst drug if the interaction between the second drug
and the gene was very similar to the interaction of the ﬁrst drug
with the gene. Should this be true, the two drugs could be said to
have the same MOA for cells bearing the shared context. This kind
of analysis is not intended for the type of large screens associated
with drug discovery, where a single type of outcome such as reduced
cell growth rate or cell death at one or two time points is used. It
is intended to be used on candidate and existing drugs to develop a
more speciﬁc characterization of the processes affected by the drug
and the particular molecular context that allows the drug to produce
the desired cellular consequences.

The idea of using gene expression data to explore drug
relationships was also explored in Lamb et al. (2006). Using
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, compounds whose gene expression
patterns correlate strongly with a query signature are considered
to be similar or to have strong connections in the connectivity
map, a collection of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data from
multiple cell lines treated with bioactive small molecules. Iorio et al.
further developed this idea by building a drug similarity network
and identifying network communities using graph theory. Hu and
Agarwal and Sirota et al. extended the idea for drug repositioning
by paring drugs and diseases whose gene expression patterns are
negatively correlated. There are several major differences between
their work and our approach. First, the mRNA data used in
their studies are only collected at one time point (6 or 12h)
after the compound treatment. There is no dynamic or temporal
data. In our experience, temporal data are critical in comparing
the detailed MOA of different drugs. Many drugs do not even
show a distinguishable response until 15 h into the experiment
(Fig. 7). Therefore, the compound connections discovered in Hu and
Agarwal (2009); Iorio et al. (2010); Lamb et al. (2006); and Sirota
et al. (2011) could be strongly time dependent. Second, similarity
requirements are different. For example, in Lamb et al. (2006),
two compounds with distinct MOAs could be viewed as similar
if they share similar clinical indications; however, in our case, two
compounds are considered similar only if they interact with a similar
set of pathways. And the similarity is cell line dependent. In this
sense, our requirement for similarity is much more stringent and
speciﬁc. Finally, we note that to use the proposed method, a set of
putative pathways affected by the testing drugs should be formulated
ﬁrst and subsequently a set of reporter proteins should be selected
to monitor the corresponding pathway activities. The method is
hypothesis—driven and requires prior knowledge.

In our adaptation of this methodology, imaging is performed using
a robotic imaging device (ImageXpress Micro, Molecular Devices).
Multichannel imaging of sets of adherent cells with various reporters
cultured in 384 well plates can be performed every hour, and at
typical initial cell loading levels, these cultures can be followed for
50h. Two typical ﬂuorescent images are shown in Figure 1a and b,
where nuclei are detected in the blue channel and promoter reporters

drug case); (b) 43h after the drug Lapatinib was added (post—drug case);
(c) calculation of population change/shift and fold change: g(x) and f (x)

respectively

are detected in the green channel. The objective of image processing
is to extract gene—expres sion levels from the population of cells in the
ﬂuorescent image and follow these intensity distributions over time.
To do so, we use morphological image processing, in particular, the
watershed transformation (Dougherty and Lotufo, 2003). Although
the image processing is rather involved, overall it breaks down
into three major components: nuclei channel segmentation reporter
channel segmentation, and measurement of cell—by—cell promoter
activity levels. Brieﬂy, to extract the promoter activity level for each
cell, one needs to ﬁrst identify the position of cells in the image and
then identify the area of the image covered by each cell’s cytoplasm.
As the cells can be either compact or spread out, we estimate the
promoter activity by measuring the sum of the green ﬂuorescent
protein (GFP) intensity (arbitrary camera intensity units) in all the
pixels within the cell area and report the log2 transformed, summed
intensity values for each cell. To achieve this, we ﬁrst process the
nuclei (blue) channel to locate all nuclei present in the image, and
then process the reporter (green) channel to determine the activity
level of the reporter for each cell. We refer to Hua et al. (2012) for
full imaging details.

Live cell imaging analysis provides two distinct types of cell—by—
cell information that are not easily measured over long time spans
by other means: (1) the extent of change in promoter activity in the
treated population relative to that of the untreated, control population
and (2) the percentage of cells in the treated population shifted into
a position in the expression level distribution not occupied by the
untreated control population, as a consequence of drug activity. An
example of how these two measurements are calculated is presented
in Figure lc, where g(x) (control or pre—drug case) and f (x) (post—
drug case) represent the log2 GFP intensity distributions for the
cells in Figures 1a and b, respectively. The percentage of population
change can be calculated by the difference in area between g(x)
and f (x) (the gray area in Fig. lc). Similarly, the fold change
can be calculated as the mean difference between the shifted cells
and the control case. Note that when fold change is positive, the
corresponding population change will be denoted as positive and
when fold change is negative, the corresponding population change
will be denoted as negative.

1.2 What information on mechanistic similarity is
available in drug response trajectories?

In order to produce metrics of comparison for the similarity of
transcription responses induced by drugs, a model of how cellular

responses to a drug will shape the trajectories is required. A
conceptual model (Fig. 2) of drug response by transcription reporters
in one molecularly homogeneous cell line responding to a series of
drugs that target protein regulators acting on pathways of interest
facilitates a simpliﬁed consideration of the informational content of
a trajectory. In this example, we start with a set of four genes (A,
B, C and D) that are suspected of contributing to the regulation
of a cellular process that we wish to inhibit. We know that a
set of genes (E, F and G) are all strongly expressed when this
process is operational and that suppression of expression of gene
G produces a reduction in cell proliferation, a desired result of
intervention, in these cells. We also have a series of drug compounds,
1, 2, 3 and 4, known to interfere in activation of the transcription
factors B, A, D and C, respectively. In such a setting, Figure 2a,
the important question to address is whether an examination of
the dynamics of response to each drug by promoter reporters for
genes E, F and G would produce sufﬁcient understanding of the
process mechanisms to determine which genes are driven by a
similar regulatory mechanism? As changes in the number of cells
making a regulatory decision that leads to altered expression levels
allow fairly intuitive interpretation of the dynamics, we will examine
this aspect of the conceptual model to illustrate the mechanistic
characteristics of the applied drugs that can be inferred through this
approach.

If a technical replicate (TR) had been run, examining the effect
of drug 2 on the gene F reporter, we would expect the kind of
trajectories labeled D2 and D2’ in Figure 2b. (Levels of similarity for
replicates in actual experiments are shown in Fig. 6.) If the cell line
that these drugs are being tested on is molecularly homogeneous,
repeated testing should produce very similar timings of when the
cell line will show a detectable amount of population change, how
rapidly the population—change trajectory increases and how many
cells respond to the drug eventually. These three characteristics,
time of onset of detectable transcription alteration, rate of population
change increase and ﬁnal percentage of responded cells, deﬁne a
dynamic population response signature that can be systematically
compared across a variety of drugs.

If two processes have no overlapping use of components, then the
effects of drugs targeting one of the processes should not produce
a response from members of the other process. The expected result
for this situation is shown in Figure 20. Drug 4 affects Process 2
(gene C), but not Process 1 (genes D, B and A), so drugs acting on
Process 1 produce no effects on the Process 2 reporter. Similarly,
Figure 2d shows that all the three drugs acting on Process 1 produce
changes in the furthest downstream reporter for Process 1 and have
no effect on the Process 2 reporter.

When drugs are acting on different parts of the same process,
it is possible that the dynamic signatures may be similar. The
level of similarity may also vary between reporters placed at
different locations along the process, due to differences in both
the time required and the step efﬁciencies in carrying out
intervening activation/inactivation, transcription and translation
processes. Differences due to the intrinsic properties of the drugs,
rates of cellular uptake, efﬂux and enzymatic transformation to an
active form, where required, could also alter the dynamics of cell
response. In Figure 2b, we see that the reporter F’s responses to
Drugs 1, 2, 3 and 4 can be ordered by D2 > D1 > D3 > D4.
Furthermore, the onset times of detectable population change also
follow the same order. These can be seen if (1) Drug 2’s inactivation

are not shown in this graph occur in the dashed connections between the

F; (2) Drug 1’s inactivation of transcription factor gene B adds only
a single additional transcription step to achieve down—regulation of
gene A and (3) Drug 3’s rate of inactivation of transcription factor
gene D is lower than that of Drugs 1 and 2 on genes A and B, but
the inactivation is very rapidly transmitted from gene D to gene B
once achieved. These hypothetical situations and results illustrate
the general approaches that could be used to evaluate how the key
characteristics of population change relate to cellular drug response
dynamics.

1.3 Rationale for drug response comparisons

The three characteristics of a population—change trajectory
mentioned in the previous section correspond to three different
phases. First is the dormancy period, where the population change
is relatively constant and small. In this period, the cell lines are
usually making the necessary conditions ready for the target GFP
to show activity. For example, D1 in Figure 2b has a dormancy
period of ~20 h. Next comes the responding period, where the right
conditions have been prepared and reporters start to be affected by
the drug intervention. In this period, we usually see an increase of
the population change level. The rate of change depends on a number
of factors, including drug dosage. Finally comes the stabilizing
period, where the drug has reached its potential and population
change is slowed down, eventually reaching a certain level. The
ﬁnal proportion of changed cells depends on the overall efﬁcacy of
the drug. Note that the three steps described here do not necessarily
happen for every GFP reporter. For example, if the test drug is
ineffective, then the treated cell line will remain in the dormancy
period without any signiﬁcant population change.

The most informative region is carried in the responding period
described above, which is directly affected by a drug’s sensitivity and
efﬁcacy. From a previous study, we know that fold change difference
can be conﬁdently detected (P—value = 0.05) when the population
change is >7.25% (Hua et al., 2012). Hence, we deﬁne the core
response on a population—change trajectory to be the region >7.25%.

Drug alignment

 

We believe that it is meaningful to study a drug’s MOA only if it
is able to induce a sufﬁcient population change at some time point
during the whole experiment.

The following descriptions summarize the key points that
determine the mechanistic similarity between two drug responses:

1. The most informative region on a population—change
trajectory is contained in the core region. The onset times
for the core region to happen may vary from drug to
drug; however, after the onset time, two population—change
trajectories should proceed side by side if they are induced
by two drugs with very similar MOAs. The longer time they
continue, the better mechanistic similarity between the two.
Here in, we deﬁne the core containing alignment of two
population—change trajectories to be the longest contiguous
alignment that contains at least one pair of points in the core
region.

2. Noisy measurements or a slight stretch/compression in time
can break an originally longer contiguous alignment into
several smaller pieces. Hence, we should allow small gaps
around the core containing alignment region described in
Point 1. In other words, the similarity comparison for two drug
responses should start from the core containing alignment
and iteratively search its adjacent regions earlier or later in
time, with a small gap allowed (e. g. 2h). In the end, the
different sections should be aggregated together to reﬂect
overall similarity level.

3. Due to the 2—dimensional (2D) nature of the drug response
data (population change and fold change), similarity requires
the responses to be close on both dimensions. However, in
reality, we often observe that when population change is small,
the variation of fold change is quite large. Therefore, we
require 2D similarity when population change is >7.25%;
otherwise, we only require similarity on the population—
change dimension.

To capture the similarities between reporter responses, we need
an algorithm that is robust to noise, time delays and is able to ﬁnd all
the contiguous parts of signals centered about the core mechanism.
Directly comparing points on the two signals is unrealistic, as it
cannot handle delays and speed variations on the time axis, as shown
in Figure 3a. Another popular approach, dynamic time warping
(DTW) (Aach and Church, 2001; Sakoe and Chiba, 1978), is based
on the concept that the similarity between two time series should be
computed by locally deforming the time axis in order to minimize
the cumulative difference between the aligned points. There are
several disadvantages for the DTW—type algorithms. First, for global
DTW, all the points on one signal must be mapped to points on the
other signal. Thus, outliers cannot be skipped and they can severely
distort the alignment. Even though efforts have been made to relax
the global alignment constraint, e.g. the open—end DTW algorithm
(Tormene et al., 2009), where the head or the tail sections can be
left unaligned, it is still difﬁcult to avoid the middle portion outliers
in the signal. Second, DTW algorithms tend to have many—to—one
mappings for the alignment. Therefore, when the two signals are
different in amplitude, it is often the case that a large portion of
one signal will be mapped to a single point on the other signal
to minimize the overall cumulative distance between the two. A

global DTW alignment is shown in Figure 3b. Many superﬂuous
and spurious matches are seen at the ending sections, making the
alignment very counterintuitive.

An alternative solution is shown in Figure 30, where the two
signals are aligned based on the concept of longest common
substring (LCSS), which belongs to the class of edit distance
problems (Bergroth et al., 2000; Hirschberg, 1977). LCSS ﬁnds the
longest string that is a substring of two strings. In this article, we
extend this approach to real—valued signals in a recursive fashion
and call it recursive RLCSS (RLCSS). The beneﬁt of RLCSS
is that the aligned signals are contiguous and only one—to—one
mapping is allowed, which satisﬁes our assumptions of biological
similarity. Furthermore, small gaps (52 h) are allowed between
different sections to account for noisy measurements.

2 SYSTEMS AND METHODS
2.1 LCSS on time series

The original LCSS model refers to a 1D sequence with discrete values, i.e.
strings. For example, the sequences ABAB and BABB have their LCSS to
be BAB. Our data are 2D and real—valued. The ﬁrst dimension is population
change and the second is fold change. These reﬂect two important aspects of
the same cell population over time. Therefore, it is natural to consider both
dimensions simultaneously when deﬁning similarities.

Formally, let A=((ax,1, aw), ..., (awn, ay,m)) and B=((bx,1, byJ), ...,
(lam, by,n)) be two drug responses, where x is the dimension for population
change, y is the dimension for fold change, m is the length of A and n is the
length ofB. LetA[1, ...,i] =((ax,1,ay,1),..., (ax,,-,ay,,-)).

Given an integer 8, a real value k e[0,1] and a pair of non—negative real
values a =(81,82), we deﬁne the length of the LCSS between the 2D time
series A and B to be the largest element in matrix Ra’s, where the element
3 is deﬁned by

0 ifi=0 orj=0
1+Rl3jelaj—l if laxJ _bx,jl £817
.. lay,i_by,j1582a
R275 li—jl :8, lam-I 2k, lbw-l 2k, (1)
Orif lax,i— x,j|§81ali_j158,
and lax,t| Sk 0r lbx,j| Ska
0 otherwise,

where the constant 8 controls the ﬂexibility of matching in time, the constant
vector 8 controls the matching threshold and k determines the population
change threshold which fold change constraint will be applied (i.e. the
population threshold for the core mechanism). Throughout the article, we will
set k=0.0725, because fold change difference can be conﬁdently detected
(P—value = 0.05) when population change has reached 7.25% (Hua et al.,
2012). Intrinsic to equation (1) is that Rg’fe depends only on the previous
diagonal element and the current element—wise distance. Hence, R22" can

be efﬁciently found by ﬁlling the table starting from 1232. After the table
has been ﬁlled, the actual common substring can be found by going back
diagonal—wise from the largest entry in the table until a 0 entry is reached
(the trace—back path shown in Table 1). Intuitively, equation (1) says that two
drug responses are similar either: (1) if population change is large enough,
data along each dimension must be similar or (2) if population change is
not large enough, only population change has to be similar, because the
measurement on fold change is no longer reliable. The requirement is made
to be consistent with Condition 3 described in Section 1.3. For illustrative
purposes, a numerical example is shown in Table 1.

By deﬁnition, the substring must be contiguous. This differs from the
concept of longest common subsequence, where the subsequence is not
necessarily contiguous (for example, the longest common subsequence
between ABACD and BABD is BAD or ABD). Furthermore, different

choices of 8 and s will lead to different alignment results. A small 8 will
restrict the alignment points to be close in time. In fact, 8 =0 degenerates to
the calculation of direct matching (Fig. 3a). For a, a very small threshold will
lead to almost no alignment between the two signals, whereas a very loose
threshold will lead to every pair of points being aligned as similar. Therefore,
an appropriate choice of 8 and e is important for the application of LCSS
alignments. A good choice of the two values depends on the application.
Thus, we will have a detailed discussion in Section 3.

2.2 RLCSS algorithm

The LCSS algorithm described in the previous section is not yet sufﬁcient
for drug response comparisons. First, there is no guarantee that the LCSS
will intersect with the region where sufﬁcient population change has been
reached and, therefore, cannot be called the core mechanism described in
Section 1.3. Second, even if the core mechanism is found, small gaps should
be allowed around it to compensate for noisy measurements. For these two
reasons, we deﬁne an algorithm that will use the LCSS concept recursively
to identify the core containing alignment as well as its surrounding pieces.

1. For a pair of 2D sequences A and B, ﬁll the dynamic programming
(DP) table as described in equation (1). Find the longest trace—
back path (ending with the largest element in the DP table). If its
corresponding matched points contain any member that has sufﬁcient
population change on both sequences (27.25%), then record the
trace—back path; otherwise, keep searching the second longest trace—
back path in the DP table until it satisﬁes the population change
threshold requirement. Denote that track—back path to be T, where
(p, q) is the pair of starting time indices and (s, t) is the pair of ending
indices. Stop and go to Step 2. If no such trace—back path exists, exit

trace—back path are within the time gap allowed from (p, q), then add
the newly found trace—back path to the beginning of T ; otherwise,
continue to search for the second LCSS until it meets the time gap
constraint. Update (p,q) so that it represents the starting indices of

trace—back path is within the time gap allowed from (s,t), then add
the newly found trace—back path to the end of T ; otherwise, continue
to search for the second LCSS until it meets the time gap constraint.
Update (s,t) so that it represents the ending indices of the newly

Note that by aligning the head sections and tail sections separately, it is
guaranteed that the time order will not be destroyed. Figure 4 shows a graphic
illustration of the RLCSS algorithm.

between the time series A and B, is given by

Note that S5,€(A,B) is always between 0 and 1—the larger the value, the
greater the similarity.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we apply the RLCSS algorithm to drug response data.
To test its performance, we need to know a priori the MOAs of the
testing drugs and see whether the alignment results agree with our
prior knowledge. For instance, if we know that Drugs X and Y have
very similar effects on some cell line (due to similar MOAs), can
the proposed RLCSS algorithm capture their similarities and claim
they are similar? Conversely, if Drugs X and Z are very different
in their MOAs, is the RLCSS algorithm also able to claim that they
are dissimilar?

To test the performance of the proposed RLCSS algorithm, we
consider the results of a study in which the detailed MOA of each

drug has been performed (Hua et al., 2012). In this study, ﬁve
drugs (Lapatinib, LY294002, Temsirolimus, U0126 and AG1024)
are tested against the colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116
(ATCC Number: CCL—247). Referring to Figure 5 and ranking drug
responsiveness across the drugs for HCT116, one observes responses
over most reporters but with decreasing percentages of cells shifted
for Lapatinib (EGFR/ERBB2), LY29004 (PI3K) and Temsirolimus
(mTOR). This similarity of action with decreasing efﬁcacy falls
directly along a survival signaling pathway headed by an activated
receptor heterodimer, ERBB2/ERBB3, and then proceeds along
the canonical PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The remaining drugs’
inhibitory powers would be ranked U0126 (MEK1/2) and AG1024
(IGF1R)—AG1024 not shown in the ﬁgure because it acts on an
unrelated kinase. All of these second tier drugs deliver very low
reductions of transcription of MKI67, the current ‘gold standard’
(Gerdes, 1990; Scholzen and Gerdes, 2000) in tumor pathology for
determining the proliferative state of a tumor. The results show that
Lapatinib, LY294002 and Temsirolimus have similar MOAs in the
sense that they all target the same survival pathways. On the other
hand, U0126 and AG1024 have very dissimilar MOAs compared
with the three previously mentioned drugs.

We design several sets of experiments to test whether the proposed
RLCSS algorithm reaches the same conclusions as just described.
First, to get a sense of the variation presented in the drug response
data, we test RLCSS on a set of technical replicates (TRs), with
the idea that TRs should exhibit high degrees of similarity among
each other. Furthermore, by studying the TRs, we can ﬁnd a proper
range for the two key parameters in the RLCSS algorithm. Second,

we test RLCSS on Lapatinib, LY294002 and Temsirolimus, since
they are related in their MOAs, and the degree of similarity should
be high, but not as high as with the TRs. Last, we test RLCSS on
Lapatinib, U0126 and AG1024, because Lapatinib is very different
from the last two in their MOAs. We set the parameter k=0.0725
in equation (1) and the time gap to be 2h for all experiments.

3.1 RLCSS performance on real data

3.1.] T Rs to determine 6 and e For RLCSS to work in practice,
a proper set of values must be determined for 6 and €=(81,82).
6 controls the maximum time delay allowed for the matching.
In practice, the experiment lasts around 30—50 h and we know
that transcription is a relatively slow process. It usually takes
about 8—12h for a reporter to show some activity after the initial
treatment. Therefore, in our application, we set 6 to be between
8 and 12h, which should be enough to compensate for the time
delays of different drugs. Moreover, we observe that RLCSS is
usually insensitive to 6 variations in the sense that changing 6 in that
range does not change the alignment results signiﬁcantly (Table 2).
8 determines the threshold for similarity. The idea for determining
a is to set it to be large enough to compensate for the discrepancies
in TRs. Herein, we set a to be the value so that the worst case TRs
similarity is at least 75% (Fig. 6c and d). In practice, we have found
that it is enough to account for the biological variations with 81 close
to 0.09 and 82 close to 0.8, as we show in Table 2.

Figure 6a and b shows a set of 4 factor on the reporter MKI67 on
the cell line HCT116 after treatment with Lapatinib, and Figure 6c
and d shows the RLCSS alignment for the worst case TR similarity.
The pairwise alignment results are summarized in Table 2. The
alignment results are not affected at all by the different choices of
6 ranging from 10h to 12h for all the pairwise alignments except
dupl and 4, indicating that the RLCSS algorithm is very robust to 6
variations. As seen in Figure 6d, the RLCSS algorithm successfully
identiﬁes the time delays between the two replicates.

3.1.2 Lapatinib, LY294002 and Temsirolimus We design the
second set of experiments to show the utility of RLCSS on
three drugs with similar MOAs. As described in Section 1.3, it
is meaningless to compare drug responses on reporters whose
responses have not changed enough during the whole experimental
span. Therefore, we select the reporters whose responses show at
least 7.25% population change for at least two out of the three
drugs. The similarity comparison table of the three is summarized
in Table 3. The three drugs show considerable amount of similarity
with each other, especially on ERBB3 and MKI67, the two key
reporters that reﬂect the MOA of drugs on cell line HCT116 (Hua
et al., 2012). We also observe that Lapatinib is closer to LY294002
than it is to Temsirolimus. The result is also consistent with our prior
knowledge that LY294002 is closer to Lapatinib than Temsirolimus
in their actual positions of attack (Fig. 5).

3.1.3 Lapatinib, U0126 and A01024 The third set of
experiments is intended to test whether the RLCSS algorithm
is able to detect mechanistic differences between drugs. As we
know from earlier discussion, Lapatinib is very different from
U0126 and AG1024 in their MOAs. The similarity results of the
three drugs are summarized in Table 4. Ranking by the closeness to
Lapatinib, the order of similarity is U0126 and AG1024. Figure 7a
and b shows the ﬁve drugs’ responses on reporter ERBB3. Note that

3.1.4 Detect apoptosis It is possible that the reporter responses
are different in the beginning, but later in time behave similarly
due to a common process, e.g. apoptosis. This is because once a
cell has determined to go through apoptosis, all the reporters will

UNBS1415 is a drug that induces apoptosis on the lung carcinoma
cell line A549 (ATCC Number: CCL—185). In Figure 8a and b, we
can see that the initial responses are quite different for different
reporters; however, later in time, all responses seem to converge to
the same behavior after 25—30 h. In Figures 80 and d, we see that

RLCSS algorithm successfully identiﬁes the similarity later in time,
which is exactly what we expect.

3.2 RLCSS performance on synthetic data

We conduct two simulation studies to evaluate the performance of
the RLCSS algorithm. As mentioned in Section 1.3, the population—
change trajectory usually has three different phases: the dormancy
phase the active responding phase and the stabilizing phase. The
shape of the curve can be represented by the family of logistic
curves, which are often used to model population dynamics in a
resource limiting environment. Hence, to model population change,
we use the logistic function p(t)=—1/1—l—Ke_r(t_t1), where t is
time, p(t) is the population change at time t, K and r are positive
numbers controlling the shape of the curve and t1 is an arbitrary
time to shift the entire logistic curve along the time axis. In a
similar vein, the fold change can also be modeled as logistic curves
with q(t)=—1/1—l—K’e_r'(t_ti), where we set K’zK, r’>r and
{ti |p(ti)=—0.0725}. r’ > r guarantees the fold—change dimension
to have a sharper transition than the population—change dimension,
as is often seen in our experiments (Fig. 6), and by requiring p(ti ) =
—0.0725, we assume that the fold change starts to decrease quickly
when enough population change has accumulated. Note that in ideal
situations, fold change should have a sudden drop as soon as one
single cell has responded to the drug; however, in practical situations,
such change cannot be detected reliably until a considerable
amount of population change has happened (Hua et al., 2012).
Throughout the simulations, we set K ’ =K = 100, r = 0.3, r’ :1 and
t=0, 1, ...,40. The choice reﬂects closely real experiment data.
Given two drug responses, A = (p(t, t1 = 0),c1(t)) and B = (p(t, t1 =
r),q(t)), we ﬁrst show the effect of the parameter 6 on different

Fig. 9. Effect of 8 on different delays r, with e =(0.09,0.8)

delays r=1,2,...,20. Note that q(t) in A and B are different and
are dependent on the respective p(t). As shown in Figure 9, we see
a big decrease in similarity between A and B when the delay r is
larger than 6 —l— 1. This is expected because 6 in the RLCSS algorithm
controls the ﬂexibility of matching in time, and if the delays are too
large compared with 6, the RLCSS will not capture such similarities.
In our drug experiments, we have found that 6 :11 is sufﬁciently
large to handle all the possible delays. We also note that for a given
delay r, the different 6 do not change similarity score when 6 Z r.
For example, when r=5, changing 6 from 8 to 11 does not affect
the similarity score at all. This indicates that the RLCSS algorithm
is robust to 6 and the conclusion is consistent with the results shown
in Table 2.

In the second simulation, we show the performance of the RLCSS
algorithm with respect to noise. Let A = (p(t, t1 :0), q(t)) —l—N(0, o)
and B = (p(t, t1 = 5), q(t)) —l—N(0, o), where N(0, o) is Gaussian white
noise with 0 mean and a standard deviation. As shown in Figure 10,
the performance of the RLCSS algorithm deteriorates with increased
noise level. However, at the noise level a 20.0725 encountered in
real experiments, we see that 97% of cases have a similarity of 0.75
or more (Fig. 11). This indicates that the false—negative rate is only
3% for the TR experiment.

3.3 Concluding remarks

The proposed RLCSS algorithm aligns reporter response dynamics
in order to facilitate identiﬁcation of mechanistic similarities in
drug responses. As opposed to 1D discrete alignment algorithms, it
operates on 2D real—valued data corresponding to population change
and fold change. It achieves three desirable aims: robustness to
noise, robustness to time delays and the ability to ﬁnd contiguous
parts of signals centered abut the core mechanism. Its performance
has been tested on TRs, drugs with similar MOAs, drugs with

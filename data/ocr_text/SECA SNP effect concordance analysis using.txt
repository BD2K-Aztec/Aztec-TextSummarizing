ABSTRACT

Summary: The genomics era provides opportunities to assess the
genetic overlap across phenotypes at the measured genotype level;
however, current approaches require individual-level genome-wide
association (GWA) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype
data in one or both of a pair of GWA samples. To facilitate the dis-
covery of pleiotropic effects and examine genetic overlap across two
phenotypes, l have developed a user-friendly web-based application
called SECA to perform §NP effect concordance analysis using GWA
summary results. The method is validated using publicly available
summary data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.

1 INTRODUCTION

Epidemiological and clinical studies indicate many human com-
plex disorders co-occur within an individual, whereas family and
twin studies suggest correlations in familial and genetic liabilities.
Since 2007, >1700 genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
have been performed to identify common single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs), associated with >890 phenotypes (disease
endpoints or quantitative traits) (Hindorff et al., 2011; www.
genome.gov/gwastudies, accessed September 18, 2013). A sur-
prising ﬁnding of GWAS is that many loci show pleiotropic ef-
fects by being associated with more than one distinct phenotype.
A study of 1380 genes and 1687 SNPs listed in the NHGRI
Catalog of Published GWAS (www.genome.gov/gwastudies, ac-
cessed February 4, 2011) found 16.9% of genes and 4.6% of
SNPs show pleiotropic effects (Sivakumaran et al., 2011).
Identifying and taking advantage of genetic overlap across
phenotypes can improve detection of genetic risk factors because
when risk is correlated across phenotypes, pooled analyses will
be better powered than individual-disorder analyses. Genetic
overlap can also help determine whether our current classiﬁca-
tion and categorization of diseases are valid or whether genetic
similarities traverse current divisions. Understanding pleiotropic
effects is also important for drug development. For example, if a
gene has opposing effects on different common diseases, drug
development and marketing will be greatly complicated.

Knowledge of pleiotropic associations could help to predict
and avoid adverse side effects.

Polygenic prediction, or genetic risk score (GRS), analysis
(Purcell et al., 2009) and bivariate linear mixed model (bivari-
ate-GCTA) analysis (Lee et al., 2012) have recently been de-
veloped to assess the genetic overlap across phenotypes.

GRS analysis requires GWAS summary results for a discovery
sample (datasetl) to construct a score in an independent target
sample (datasetZ) by forming the weighted sum of associated
alleles (i.e. a GRS) within each subject (thus requiring individ-
ual-level GWA SNP genotype data for the target sample).
Association between the GRS and a phenotype in the target
sample implies genetic overlap between the discovery and
target phenotypes.

The bivariate-GCTA approach requires individual-level popu-
lation-based GWA SNP genotype data for both the discovery
and target sample to estimate the genetic correlation explained
by SNPs between pairs of quantitative traits or pairs of binary
traits. For example, the SNP-based genetic correlation (rg SNP)
will be positive when the cases of one (discovery) trait show
higher genetic similarity (i.e. pairwise genetic relationship esti-
mated from genome-wide SNP genotype data) to the cases of
the other (target) trait, than they do to their own (discovery)
controls.

The sharing of individual-level genotype and phenotype data
requires application, material transfer agreement, informed con-
sent and ethical consideration (McGuire et al., 2011). Given most
large GWA studies meta-analyze summary results from multiple
independent samples, the sharing of individual-level GWA SNP
genotype data is often difﬁcult, if not impossible. Therefore, to
overcome these challenges, I have developed a user-friendly web-
based application called SECA to perform SNP effect goncor-
dance analysis using GWAS summary results.

2 METHODS

SECA analyzes two sets of GWAS summary results (Supplementary Fig.
S1), each containing ﬁve essential columns: (i) reference SNP cluster ‘rs’
ID (SNP), (ii) effect allele (EA), (iii) non-effect allele (NEA), (iv) P-Value
from association test (P) and (V) regression coefficient (BETA), odds ratio
(OR) or signed z-score (ZSCORE) for the EA relative to the NEA.
SECA ﬁrst aligns the SNP effects across the two GWAS summary
results (datasetl and dataset2) to the same EA, and extracts a subset of
independent SNPs Via linkage disequilibrium (LD) clumping using the
PLINK program (Purcell et al., 2007). The default clumping procedure is
‘P-Value informed’. The approach iterates from the ﬁrst to last SNP on
each chromosome sorted from smallest to largest P-Value in dataset] (P1)

that has not already been clumped (denoting this as the index SNP) and
forms clumps of all other SNPs that are within 1 Mb and in LD (r2> 0.1)
with the index SNP based on HapMap or 1000 Genomes Project (1 kGP)
genotype data. A second round of LD clumping is performed to ensure
none of the round 1 index SNPs within 10 Mb of each other are in long-
range LD (r2>0.1). The default approach identiﬁes the subset of inde-
pendent SNPs with the most signiﬁcant association P-values in dataset].
An alternate LD clumping approach identiﬁes an effectively random
subset of independent SNPs by setting all dataset] P-values (P1) to 0.5
during the clumping rounds.

Restricting to SNPs associated with P1 5 {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,
0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0} in dataset], SECA ﬁrst performs exact binomial
statistical tests using the R statistical package (R Development Core
Team, 2009) to determine whether there is an excess of SNPs associated
in both datasets for the subset of SNPs associated with P2 5 {0.01, 0.05,
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0} in dataset2. For each ofthe 144
SNP subsets (generated using these 12 x 12 P-value threshold combin-
ations), binomial tests of associated SNPs in dataset] (P1) and dataset2
(P2) are performed. A binomial test ‘heatmap’ plot is generated to graph-
ically summarize the proportion of SNP subsets with an excess [observed
(obs) 2 expected (exp)] or deﬁcit (obs< exp) number of associated SNPs,
and empirical P-values (adjusted for testing all 144 subsets) are calculated
via permutation. The permutation procedure ﬁrst creates uncorrelated
datasets by randomly shufﬂing the observed SNP effect (BETA) and
corresponding P-value (P) between SNPs in dataset], and then repeats
the analysis of the 144 SNP subsets. A permuted P-value (PBTsig_pemuted)
is estimated for the observed number of binomial tests with obs 2 exp and
PBT5 0.05 (nBTsig), and for the single most signiﬁcant excess (PBijn-
permuted). We note that for polygenic traits, a well-powered GWAS
should produce an excess of smaller P-values Wang et al., 2011).
Therefore, instead of specifying P2 as the expected proportion of SNPs
with P1 and P2, the proportion of SNPs associated in dataset2 (irrespect-
ive of its P-value in dataset]) is used as the ‘overlap’ (null) probability (i.e.
‘expected proportion’) in the binomial tests. For example, the observed
proportion of total SNPs with P151 and P250.05 is used as the ex-
pected proportion of SNPs with P15 {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5,
0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0} and P25 0.05.

SECA next performs Fisher’s exact statistical tests to determine
whether there is an excess of SNPs where the effect directions (BETA,
OR or ZSCORE) are concordant across dataset] and dataset2 for each of
the 144 SNP subsets. Fisher’s exact tests of SNP effects in dataset] (e.g.
0R1) and dataset2 (0R2) are performed on 2 x 2 tables containing the
number of SNPs with OR1<1 (BETAl/ZSCORE1<0) and OR2<1,
0R1 21 (BETAl/ZSCOREI 30) and OR2<1, OR1<1 and ORzzl
and 0R1 21 and 0R2 Z 1. A Fisher’s test ‘heatmap’ plot is generated
to graphically summarize the proportion of SNP subsets with concordant
(Fisher’s test odds ratio, ORFTZ 1) and discordant (ORFT< 1) SNP ef-
fects, and an empirical P-value (PFTsig_permuted) is calculated via permu-
tation for the observed number of subsets (nFTsig) with nominally
signiﬁcant concordance (ORFT Z 1 and PFT 5 0.05). A permuted P-
value is also estimated for the single most signiﬁcant concordant test
(PFTrnin-permuted)°

In addition to a summary of the above analyses, SECA reports de-
tailed results from binomial and Fisher’s tests for three practical subsets
of SNPs, which are nominally associated (P2 5 0.05) in datasetZ and (i)
genome-wide signiﬁcant (P1 5 5 x 10‘8), (ii) genome-wide suggestive
(P1 5 1 x 10‘s) and (iii) nominally associated (P1 5 0.05) in dataset].

A ‘grid’ search is also performed across 150 P-value thresholds to
identify the subset of SNPs overlapping dataset] and dataset2 that pro-
duce the minimum binomial test ‘pleiotropic’ P-value and minimum
Fisher’s test (effect concordance) P-value. The search is performed at 5
equidistant P-value {P1, P2} increments for the interval [5 x 10‘s,
9 x 10—8], i.e. {5 x 10—8, 6 x 10—8, 7 x 10—8, 8 x 10—8, 9 x 10—8}; 9 equi-
distant increments for each of the intervals [1 x 10‘7, 9 x 10‘7], [1 x 10‘6,

9 x10_6], [1 x 10—5, 9 x10_5], [1 x 10—4, 9 X10_], [1 x 10—3, 9 x10_3];
and 100 increments of 0.01 between 0.01 and 1.0. The results from all
150 x 150222 500 SNP subsets are output to enable post hoc examin-
ation of SNP overlap and concordance across the full range of statistical
signiﬁcance in dataset] and dataset2.

Additionally, SECA generates quantile—quantile (Q-Q) and true dis-
covery rate (TD R) plots for dataset2 P-values (P2) stratiﬁed (conditioned)
on dataset] P-values (P15 {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0}) to visualize
whether there is an excess of overlapping ‘pleiotropic’ SNPs. A leftward
shift in the Q-Q or TDR curve corresponds to an excess of SNPs with
smaller P-values. In the presence of pleiotropy, we expect the Q—Q and
TDR curves for dataset2 SNP P-values (P2) to deviate further left of the
identity line because we condition on them having smaller P-values (P1)
in dataset]. Finally, ‘pleiotropy—informed’ conditional false discover rate
(FDR) results are output for dataset2 P-values (P2) stratiﬁed on dataset]
P-values (P15 {1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01,
0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001}). These results may identify SNPs associated in
dataset2 after conditioning on their association signiﬁcance (P1) in data-
setI and help prioritize SNPs for follow-up studies. Coincidently,
Andreassen et al. (2013) developed in parallel (but without accompanying
software), similar Q-Q and TDR plot and FDR-based approaches to
identify pleiotropic effects. An overview of the SECA approach is pro-
vided in Supplementary Figure S2.

Resources to customize LD clumping, an alternate version of SECA
(iSECA), which assumes the SNPs in dataset] to be independent, and an
R script allowing users to alter the number of replicates (default = 1000)
for the permutation of binomial and Fisher’s test P-values are also
provided.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Time-to—event regression models are a critical tool for
associating survival time outcomes with molecular data. Despite
mounting evidence that genetic subgroups of the same clinical dis-
ease exist, little attention has been given to exploring how this hetero-
geneity affects time-to-event model building and how to
accommodate it. Methods able to diagnose and model heterogeneity
should be valuable additions to the biomarker discovery toolset.
Results: We propose a mixture of survival functions that classifies
subjects with similar relationships to a time-to-event response. This
model incorporates multivariate regression and model selection and
can be fit with an expectation maximization algorithm, we call Cox-
assisted clustering. We illustrate a likely manifestation of genetic het-
erogeneity and demonstrate how it may affect survival models with
little warning. An application to gene expression in ovarian cancer DNA
repair pathways illustrates how the model may be used to learn new
genetic subsets for risk stratification. We explore the implications of
this model for censored observations and the effect on genomic pre-
dictors and diagnostic analysis.

1 INTRODUCTION

In cancer genomic studies, unobserved heterogeneity obfuscates
the effort to build accurate descriptive models of risk stratiﬁca-
tion. In ovarian cancer, for example, Vaughan et al. (2011) argue
that the set of patients with the same clinical disease have distinct
molecular diseases. With respect to inference, this implies that
the same regression models may not be valid for every patient
and further that it is unclear which patients should be considered
together (Kobel et al., 2008). Therefore, a major statistical task is
to organize patients into previously unknown classes while sim-
ultaneously ﬁtting their time-to-event models.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The examples throughout the article are taken from our on-
going analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),
which has the goal of cataloging all of the genomic alterations in
cancer. For each patient, there is a tremendous amount and var-
iety of data: 12000 genes in expression arrays, 1 million single-
nucleotide polymorphism genotypes, exome and whole-genome
sequences, methylation of thousands of CpG islands and the
expression of microRNA. From this plurality of data, we antici-
pate that exploratory methods will serve to extract and charac-
terize genetic subgroups relevant to survival time clinical
outcomes.

For summarizing the impact of a genetic signature, one often
stratiﬁes patients to demonstrate separation between class-
deﬁned survival curve estimates. Unfortunately, as Na et al.
(2009) review, current methods either awkwardly dichotomize a
continuous score at a post hoc threshold or rely on hierarchical
clustering to deﬁne subgroups with no necessary relation to sur-
vival. In that sense, it is desirable to have a method that identiﬁes
genetic subgroups supervised by their survival times.

The standard methods for dealing with non-homogenous
time-to-event data do not apply when our goal is to discover
unknown subgroups. Continuous frailty models (Aalen, 1988)
treat all individuals separately and therefore do not produce sub-
groups. O’Quigley and Stare (2002) emphasize the use of random
effects and stratiﬁed regression models when subgroups are
known. Classiﬁcation and regression tree methods have been
adapted for survival responses (Lostritto et al., 2012; Segal,
1988). However, these methods partition the predictor space to
form a single piecewise functional estimate, and our interest is in
the subgroups that exist in similar regions.

Some treatment of heterogeneity relevant to survival time
where a subgroup of patients does not expire appears in the
cure rate model literature (Farewell, 1982). Our situation is dis-
tinct in three ways: a subgroup may have variable time-to-event
outcomes (cured patients have inﬁnite survival times), the vari-
ables of interest to each mixture component may be distinct and
the set of patients in each subgroup is not known.

In this article, we propose a discrete mixture regression model
that synergizes with potential heterogeneity in time-to-event
data. Concretely, we assume that observations belong to un-
labeled classes with class-speciﬁc proportional hazards (PH) re-
gression models relating their genetic covariates to survival time
outcomes (Section 3). This conditional semi-parametric model
leads to a surprising variety of model effects, which we illustrate

in Section 2. In Section 4, we describe an algorithm and the
considerations for ﬁtting the model. Simulations highlight the
use of censored data (Section 5) and a data analysis demonstrates
a single-pathway hypothesis-driven model (Section 6). Our dis-
cussion (Section 7) again emphasizes the exploratory role that
this analysis may address.

2.1 Genetic heterogeneity

There is evidence that distinct molecular subgroups lead to the
same clinical presentation of ovarian cancer (Cooke et al., 2010;
Kobel et al., 2008; Konstantinopoulos et al., 2008; Vaughan
et al., 2011). This form of genetic heterogeneity may arise be-
cause the commonalities leading to cancer may aggregate within
pathways and not on the level of genes (Jones et al., 2008). In the
following case study, we highlight the ability of the mixture to
produce unusual associations between covariates and survival
and how it may augment our understanding of subgroup
discovery.

Suppose that X ~ N(O, 1) represents a single typical normal-
ized gene expression measurement and that patients do have
survival times arising from two distinct hazard models,
h1(t|x) = h0(t) exp(—2x) and h2(t|x) = h0(t) exp(+2x). These
hazards represent an extreme version of heterogeneity in

expression; in one class, the gene has a protective effect and in
the other it is equally deleterious.

Assuming the baseline hazard is exponential (h0(t) = 1), we
generate 1000 complete survival times, Y, under each of these
hazards and plot them on the log scale with their randomly gen-
erated expression in Figure 1A. Without knowledge of the true
classes, ﬁtting a standard Cox regression to these data ﬁnds no
signiﬁcant relationship between Yand X (,3 = —0.0314, P = 0.1).
This effect is strong enough that the relationship is easily identiﬁed
if the true classes are known (31 = 1.93, P<0.001 and
32 = —2.12, P<0.001).

A standard diagnostic technique to estimate non-linear rela-
tionships between Y and X is to use a smoothing estimate on
the added variable plot (Fig. 1B). In this case, it fails to identify
any important effects. Estimating a time-varying effect is another
diagnostic for assessing PH (Grambsch and Therneau, 1994).
Again it does not discern any non-proportional effect
(P = 0.116) or time-varying effect (Fig. 1C). So, by the standard
analyses, this important gene would not be identiﬁed for further
study.

With respect to gene expression analyses, this is a case where
differential expression (DE) models that look for mean difference
will fail: there is no true underlying survival difference between
classes that may be attributed to X (Fig. 1D). This means that
models that try to estimate a rule 1{X> c} that can classify patients
are not applicable. So, the mixture reﬂects a different way to

model risk in gene expression. The question remains about
whether this kind of example exists in real data. We present a
gene that does just this in the following illustration.

2.2 Cytoreduction and epiregulin

We draw known class labels from a measured surgical covariate,
which is presently used as a biomarker. Cytoreduction, the
amount of tumor remaining after surgery, is a measure of success
of surgical debulking, which is a component of primary therapy
in ovarian cancer. Patients who are suboptimally cytoreduced
have a clinically signiﬁcant amount of residual tumor that will
seed future recurrent disease and progression (Bhoola and
Hoskins, 2006).

Using the TCGA study to be introduced in Section 6, we sep-
arate the patients into optimal and suboptimal categories and
provide a kernel smoothing estimate of their hazards (Fig. 2).
The estimated hazards are clearly non-proportional [P2 0.007,
Grambsch and Therneau (1994)], reﬂecting the early protective
effect of optimal cytoreduction and its transient nature.

Fitting separate models in each subgroup, we searched for genes
whose relationship with survival inverts over classes ﬁnding epir-
egulin (interaction P = 0.004), which has been recently highlighted
as a progression marker (Amsterdam et al., 2011). In optimally
cytoreduced patients, increased expression is detrimental to sur-
vival (,8 = 0.156,P = 0.014); in suboptimal patients, increased
expression is protective (,8 = —0.452,P = 0.012). In Figure 2,
we have plotted the estimated survival for high and low epiregulin
expression for optimal and suboptimal patients. Noting that epir-
egulin has been shown to inhibit epithelial tumor cells and stimu-
late cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (Toyoda et al., 1995), the
surgical outcomes may indicate a more epithelial or more ﬁbrous
tumor; a fair biological explanation is that epiregulin expression
leads to the inhibition of tumor burden (a better prognostic out-
come), or the stimulation of ﬁbroblasts that leads to cancer
progression.

Thus, these effects do exist and imply surprisingly deep biolo-
gical connections. Following a genomic survey, this type of effect
is an ideal target for functional studies. Given that we want to
identify genetic subgroups with different prognoses, we should
favor a model that admits unknown and possibly dramatically

different survival experiences. The mixture model should let us
estimate labels and should be able to resolve non-PH.

3 METHODS

Let (Yi,6,-,x,-), i: 1,  ,n be an independent right-censored sample
with regression covariates x,- = (xil, xiz, . .. , xip)’, where 8,- : 1 indicates
that the complete time has been observed. We will denote the collections
of survival times, censoring indicators and covariate vectors as
Y: (Y1,  , Y”), A = (61,  ,6”) and x = (x1,  ,xn), respectively.

To account for heterogeneity, we propose that each patient arises from
one of K latent classes with probability nk,k = 1,  ,K, 2k nk = 1.
We assume Cox’s PH model (Cox, 1972) within each class k, so that
the covariate vector x enters the model log-linearly Via a class-speciﬁc
hazard: log hk(t|x) = log h0k(t) + x’ ,Bk. For a general introduction to the
Cox regression, see Hosmer et al. (2011). In particular, recall that a right-
censored observation following a PH model has the density

my, 61x) = make)emanated—Hake)more», (1)

where h0k(t) and H0k(t) are the baseline hazard and baseline cumulative
hazard for the kth class. The mixture density may be written as

n K
f(Y, Alx) = H Ewan-aim). (2)
i=1 k=1
If we also observe the latent class U 2 (U1, U2, . . . , Un), where
U,- ~ Multinomial(7r), U,- 6 {1,2, ...,K} and uik = 1{U,:k}, we may
write the density of the complete data as

n K
f(Y, Alx, U) = H H WWI/2.6.6.91”. (3)
i=1 k=1

To estimate the regression coefﬁcients and baseline hazard parameters,
we propose maximizing this likelihood Via the expectation maximization
(EM) procedure (Dempster et al., 1977) described in Section 4.

The discrete mixture leads to the model’s interpretation as organizing
observations into clusters that are not known a priori. This type of clus-
tering should not be confused with clustered survival data, which typically
refers to the case where class labels identifying multiple observations from
the same source (e.g. treatment centers or year of diagnosis) are known.
Instead, observations are gathered according to their best-ﬁtting regres-
sion model.

Additionally, our mixture relaxes the PH assumption; we only need to
assume that hazards are proportional within their given clusters. The
practical interpretation of this property is highlighted in the example
given in Section 2.2. Continuous frailty (Aalen, 1988) and random effects

Cox-assisted clustering

 

models (O’Quigley and Stare, 2002) are other common methods for
accommodating heterogeneity, but they still rely on the PH framework.

In addition to presenting a novel approach for handling heterogeneity
and subgroup discovery for time-to-event data, our approach offers a
new contribution to the ﬁnite mixture model literature (McLachlan and
Peel, 2000; Friihwirth—Schnatter, 2006). The problem of ﬁnite mixtures
has been explored in mixed effects models (Qin and Self, 2006), general-
ized linear models (W edel and DeSarbo, 1995) and discrete-time survival
models (Muthén and Masyn, 2005); our approach extends the idea to PH
regression.

4 ALGORITHM: COX-ASSISTED CLUSTERING

We refer to the following algorithm for maximizing the mixture
likelihood as Cox-assisted clustering (CAC). For convenience, we
write the parameters to be estimated as at = (m, m, . . . ,er), the
mixing proportions, h = {h01(t), ...,h0K(t)}, the set of baseline
hazard functions and ,6 = (,61, ..., ,BK), the coefﬁcient vectors.
We further abbreviate the hazards at their evaluation points:
hOki = h0k(Yi) and HOki = H0k(Yi)-

The complete data likelihood with mixing parameters It and
class-speciﬁc parameters h and ,6 may be separated into a mixing
distribution part and a component distribution part:

10gL(7t,h,/3; YA, le) =10gL1(7r; U) +10gL2(h,/3; Y,AIU,x)-

The ﬁrst is simply

n
E Z Siuik 10g hOki + SiuikXZ-ﬁk — uikHOkieXp(x1/3k)-
k=1 i=1

(5)

To compute the maximum likelihood estimate, we follow an
EM approach that estimates and optimizes the observed data log
likelihood by plugging ﬁik = E(u,-k| Y,, 8,, x) into the complete
data likelihood. Supposing that the current values of the param-
eters at the mth iteration are ﬁg"), thg,  and ,BO"), the algo-
rithm proceeds as follows.

In the E-step, conditional mean is

uik =

after the application of Bayes rule. We note that, unlike the
standard Cox regression setting, computing the baseline hazard
is necessary to compute the conditional means. It can be shown
that if we assume a common baseline hazard across clusters, the
E-step update depends only on the current estimates of It and ,6.

In the M-step, the update for mixing proportions 71} is
straightforward:

n

To update h, we make a proﬁle likelihood argument that leads
to a partial likelihood (Johansen, 1983). Suppose we hold ,Bk
constant. Maximizing over hOk, we obtain proﬁle estimates of
the hazards as a function of the 61cm“) that are similar to
Breslow (1974):

The proﬁled M-step objective is a partial likelihood weighted
by the ill-k:

Each component indexed by k may be maximized separately
to obtain the 61cm“) update using standard statistical software.
The M-step is operationally equivalent to ﬁtting K-weighted Cox
models. Finally, one iterates between the E and M step until the
increment in log-likelihood is small.

4.1 Starting conditions and number of classes

As an iterative procedure, the EM algorithm requires initial
values 13(0), Jim). For analyses that begin with strong biological
hypotheses, the corresponding parameters may be set directly.
An alternative is to choose starting parameters by assigning ob-
servations to speciﬁc classes and estimating the initial 13(0) and
am). This is equivalent to setting an initial value for every ﬁik and
running the algorithm forward. This assignment may be random;
one may set a randomly selected ﬁik to 0.8, say, and divide the
remaining weight among the other classes. In practice, we use
multiple random starts and pick the best by the ﬁtted log-
likelihood.

As in other clustering problems (F raley and Raftery, 1998), we
select the number of classes using the Bayesian information cri-
terion (BIC). Let L(K) = L(hK, ,6 K, JTK; Y, 8, U |x), where we have
added the K subscript to emphasize the dependence. The BIC
criterion is expressed as

BIC(K) = —210g L(K) +pKlog(n), (11)

where p is the dimension of X and n is the number of observed
patients. The value of K minimizing BIC(K) is a penalized com-
promise between ﬁt and complexity. Also, while Volinsky and
Raftery (2000) propose weighting by the number of observed
events, log(Zl-8,-), because log(n) is always larger, the standard
BIC is a more conservative criterion.

As a measure of model sensitivity to additional clusters, we
consider an adaption of the DF BETA statistic (Hamilton, 1992).
Given a model ﬁt for K classes, each patient 1' can be assigned a

parameter vector 13(17EK) ) given their assigned class,  . For each
component j, we simply consider the average change over K:
n

_ ~(K) _ _ ~(K—1)
DFBETA(j, 10:11-12: ﬁj(u‘ﬁ)(ﬁ(fl();l  (12)
1= j i

This statistic will be large when the coefﬁcients change dra-
matically between cluster numbers. Conversely, if the (K+ 1)th
cluster simply subdivides an existing cluster, the statistic will be
small.

 

 

5 SIMULATION STUDIES

Although there are several properties of the model and algorithm
to highlight, we focus on its treatment of censored data and a
demonstration of its estimation ability. Let true class indicator
U,- 6 {1,2} be evenly split among 2n observations with a single
covariate (X 1, . . . , X 2”) ~ N (11.12”, [2”) independent normal with
mean ,u. 2 0 and variance 1. As is common in gene expression
studies, we will work with sealed and centered X, so ,u. reﬂects the
sensitivity of the analysis to this standardization.

The relationship between survival and X is controlled by
,6 Z 0, where the ﬁrst class has ,61 = ,6 and the second class has
,62 = —,B. The survival time for the ith patient is then
T ,- =  where 6,- ~ Exponential(1). The censoring time is

generated from C,- ~ Uniform(0, A), where A depends on the
choice of ,u. and ,6 and a target censoring rate. Finally, the
observed survival time is Y,- = min(T,-, C,).

We set n=200 patients in each class and set ,6 = 3 so that
,61 = +3 and ,62 = —3. We target 40% censoring by setting
A = exp(0.99) for ,u. = 0 and A = exp(12.83) for ,u. = 5. For
this simulation, we run our algorithm at the true number of
clusters K: 2.

We study the same scenarios over 1000 simulations. In
Table 1, we report the estimated ,Bk (choosing 131 5 132 for iden-
tiﬁability) alongside the oracle estimator that knows the true
classes. Intuitively, if the data are perfectly classiﬁed, the oracle
estimate will have properties consistent with the well-studied Cox
model estimate. Thus, the accuracy, the proportion of patients

assigned to their true class, is an ideal measure of loss of per-
formance due to uncertainty. Considering the standard Cox
model in this heterogeneity setting, the median parameter esti-
mate for the ,u. = 0 case is 1.8e-05 (range —0.26—0.28) implying
that heterogeneity has masked all detectable association with the
covariate of interest.

The results imply that the clustering algorithm works well des-
pite heavy censoring and mean mis-speciﬁcation. We note a bias
toward larger absolute parameter estimates (13634631 >,80mcge,1)
that we believe comes from the algorithm greedily reinforcing
what it has already learned. A censoring bias in the ,u. = 5 scen-
ario appears as [BCAC’Z is smaller than it should be; this group is
more likely to be censored so it has a lower effective sample size.
Variation in per cluster censoring rates is a novel data consider-
ation, and we recommend tracking the number of events in each
cluster (see for example Section 6). When the cluster sizes are
generated by Z, U,- ~ Binomial (2n, 1 / 2), the estimates are simi-

lar and the standard errors increase reﬂecting the variation in U,-

(Supplementary Material).

To consider the ability of CAC to identify heterogeneity, we
tested the above ,u. = 0 scenario with the DF BETA statistic
noting that DFBETA(K=2) is greater than DFBETA(K=3)
in all cases; the median DFBETA(K=2) was 60 (IQR: 92),
implying the model was much more sensitive to two clusters
than one, whereas the median DFBETA(K=3) was 0.91
(IQR: 0.21), implying that two clusters are sufﬁcient.
Conversely, if we generate data where all patients come from
the same class, DFBETA(K=2) is larger than
DFBETA(K=3) in 61.2% of cases with medians 0.83 and
0.81, respectively. This implies that, along with appropriate con-
text and judgment, the DFBETA statistic is a useful tool for
diagnosing heterogeneity.

6 DNA REPAIR EXPRESSION SUBGROUPS IN
OVARIAN CANCER

Because of its frequency among gynecological cancers, its high
lethality and poor options for treatment Waughan et al., 2011),
serous ovarian cancer was a pilot target for molecular character-
ization in TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network,
2011). The study collected banked surgical samples from n = 503
patients with highly annotated clinical follow-up whose cancers
had been surgically debulked and who had been treated with
platinum-based chemotherapy (Bhoola and Hoskins, 2006).

Platinum resistance is an important concept in the treatment
of ovarian cancer because these cancers respond poorly to any
type of chemotherapy (Bookman, 2005). Although resistance is
not an ideal predictive marker because it is deﬁned through treat-
ment, the development of an independently queried molecular
model is precisely the promise of a large repository study like
TCGA.

One unaddressed complication is the expectation of genetic
heterogeneity: patients with similar survival outcomes may
have dissimilar molecular proﬁles. If this heterogeneity appears
to take the form of subgroups and mixtures (as in the illustra-
tions), we anticipate that our model and algorithm will be able to
address it.

Cox-assisted clustering

 

Therefore, we demonstrate the use of our model to explore
possibly heterogenous data by modeling a potential mechanism
of platinum resistance in TCGA patients. Because recent reviews
of resistance highlight the homologous repair pathway for repair-
ing DNA damage (Martin et al., 2008; Cooke and Brenton,
2011), we focus on modeling the function of this set of genes.
The homologous repair pathway is deﬁned by Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotation (hsa:03440)
(Kanehisa et al., 2010) and corresponds to 27 unique gene
symbols.

We ﬁt our model for K : 2, . . . , 10 using 100 random starts
for each K and selecting the best ﬁt by log likelihood. By BIC, we
select K: 5 clusters (Supplementary Material). Survival times
are truncated at 60 months of observation to reduce the inﬂuence
of 76 patients who are observed beyond the time of interest. In
total, 186 of 503 (37%) patients are censored before 60 months.

Table 2 describes the quality of the cluster ﬁts by the relative
weight of each cluster (Ziﬁik), the number of patients assigned
(11) and the mean posterior probability for patients in their as-
signed clusters. The number of events in each cluster and the
restricted mean (up to 60 months) are listed.

We observe that, although they have the largest number of
patients assigned, clusters 4 and 5 have the smallest mean pos-
terior probabilities, implying that their members are less similar
internally. The clustering appears to be driven by the poor prog-
nosis patients in clusters 1, 2 and 3. Noting the presence of cross-
ing survival functions, the ﬁve class log-rank test is signiﬁcant
(P: 1.26e—09).

With respect to low posterior probabilities, we observe that the
algorithm makes intuitively reasonable use of the censored ob-
servations. We plot the maximum posterior probability for each
patient by their survival time in Figure 3A. Because censored
patients do not have deﬁnitive events, the algorithm is less cer-
tain about which cluster to assign them. Patients with the least
follow-up time have maximum posterior probability close to 0.2
(i.e. 1 of 5), and as they are observed, longer the certainty of their
maximum assigned cluster rises. To wit, the hardest to classify
patients are the least observed.

Within each cluster, we check model diagnostics and look for
inﬂuential points. Noting that there was moderate evidence
(P : 0.059) for non-PH (Grambsch and Therneau, 1994) when
considering all the patients as a single group, after ﬁtting our
model, the within-cluster tests are all strongly insigniﬁcant. All
inﬂuence statistics for all genes in each cluster are smaller than 1
standard deviation, implying no leverage points.

Because the mixture allows different clusters to have different
baseline hazard functions, in Figure 3B, we used a kernel
smoothing algorithm to Visualize their estimates (Muller and
Wang, 1994). We emphasize the non-proportionality of the haz-
ards for clusters 3 and 5: patients in cluster 3 have a sudden
acceleration in their hazard after 30 months, which may be con-
sistent with the loss of effect in platinum chemotherapy.

In Figure 3C, we have plotted the estimated coefﬁcients for
clusters 3 and 5. Keeping in mind that the linear predictor in the
Cox model scales hazard relative to the cluster-speciﬁc baseline
hazard, we highlight three genes. RPA4’s coefﬁcients
(133,135) : (+7.13, — 5.90) imply that it has a strong deleterious
effect in cluster 3 (exacerbating the jump in hazard), while it has
a strong protective effect in cluster 5. Contrast this change with

Note: Clusters are ordered by mean months of survival following surgery estimated
by restricted mean.

RPA3 (—0.96, + 6.24), which only increases risk in cluster 5, and
TOP3A (—7.54, — 0.54), which is protective in cluster 3 only. At
this point in the analysis, these genes are good candidates for
follow-up studies: we have identiﬁed their effect speciﬁc to a
subgroup of patients.

Further, the clustering model may still recover a sense of DE
for survival data. Because we have learned risk classes, we may
consider DE across clusters. We focus on DE across clusters 3
and 5, SHFMl (Bonferroni adjusted t-test, P:0.011), RPA3
(P:0.011) and RAD51L3 (P: 0.020), all have signiﬁcant
shifts in expression. Notably, RPA4 and TOP3A do not show
signiﬁcant DE, implying that they ﬁt into the class of variables
that only differ in regression model effects.

Representative of prognostic signature development, Kang
et al. (2012) conducted a study of selected DNA repair pathways
and produced a risk signature in this dataset. To compare with
their model (using 151 genes across eight pathways) and a typical
Cox model approach (using the 27 gene homologous repair path-
way), we stratiﬁed patients based on survival to 3.7 years [as in
Kang et al. (2012)] and produced receiver operating characteris-
tic plots for all of the signatures (Fig. 4A). While the standard
Cox model underperforms at area under the curve (AUC) 0.61
(comparable with a clinically derived model reported by Kang
and colleagues), the K: 5 CAC model has AUC 0.73 compar-
able with Kang’s model (AUC 0.70).

The key advantage of the CAC approach is the ability to de-
scribe risk sets. By itself, the Cox model describes continuous risk
and must be dichotomized post hoc for survival curve plots of
high- and low-risk subsets. In Figure 4B, we have illustrated the
typical continuous risk score plot that describes sensitivity of
high- and low-risk sets to the cutpoint. The CAC model naturally
separates patients into risk classes (clusters 3 and 5 are high-
lighted, Fig. 4C) and these can be further described by processing
their continuous risk scores.

Based on our analysis, we conjecture that we are able to iden-
tify a subgroup of patients (cluster 3) who experience a signiﬁ-
cant increase in hazard around month 30. We are able to identify
genes whose expression leads to increased risk speciﬁc to a sub-
group or whose relationship inverts across clusters. There is a
tremendous amount of untapped information remaining in the
ﬁtted model. For example, every pairwise comparison between
clusters should be informative as well as their holistic

7 DISCUSSION

In this article, we have presented a model for heterogeneity in
time-to-event data. Although its actual formulation is straight-
forward, the treatment of unknown classiﬁcation, a consider-
ation of the implications for censoring, the effect on genomic
predictors and diagnostic analysis have not been previously con-
sidered. Finally, we have presented a novel and informative ana-
lysis in Section 6, which begins to identify the set of survival-
associated and subgroup-dependent alterations in expression.

Admirably, this model relaxes the whole model PH assump-
tion to conditional PH given cluster membership. In an explora-
tory situation, the utility of this ﬂexibility cannot be overstated.
Both our simulated and applied analysis highlight that our
understanding of censoring has been augmented and the use of
information in the model is intuitively simple.

In a data analytic View, informaticists are familiar with un-
supervised clustering analysis and class-label supervised cluster-
ing analysis. Our algorithm may be seen as a way to use a
survival time (possibly censored) to supervise the clustering of
gene expression data. This clustering property is distinct from
ensemble-type methods [e.g. Jordan and Jacobs (1994)], where

covariate information may be used to reweight components. As
we saw with its treatment of posterior class probabilities, the
mixture believes each observation comes from a single compo-
nent, while averaging over weak learners or hidden layers may be
relevant to a more admixed sample.

With respect to developing ovarian cancer biomarkers, our
data analysis has shown an example where class identiﬁcation
leads to risk stratiﬁcation. We might further identify high- and
low-risk classes within the assigned clusters as is standard prac-
tice, but this is no longer a required post-processing part of the
expression analysis. The CAC algorithm has also given us its
posterior weights allowing a concrete measure of uncertainty
for downstream analyses.

In the TCGA project, as in many other cancer genomic stu-
dies, there are issues of both high-dimensional data and variable
selection. As presented, the CAC regression framework does not
incorporate these, but it can be extended with additional study.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Copy number variants (CNVs) are a major source of gen-
etic variation. Comparing CNVs between samples is important in elu-
cidating their potential effects in a wide variety of biological contexts.
HD-CNV (hotspot detector for copy number variants) is a tool for
downstream analysis of previously identified CNV regions from mul-
tiple samples, and it detects recurrent regions by finding cliques in an
interval graph generated from the input. It creates a unique graphical
representation of the data, as well as summary spreadsheets
and UCSC (University of California, Santa Cruz) Genome Browser
track files. The interval graph, when viewed with other software or
by automated graph analysis, is useful in identifying genomic regions
of interest for further study.

Availability and implementation: HD-CNV is an open source Java
code and is freely available, with tutorials and sample data from http://
daleylab.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

A copy number variant (CNV) refers to a large (:1 kb) segment
of the genome that is either duplicated or deleted. CNVs are
found between individuals and between tissues of the same or-
ganism because of germline mutation and/ or somatic mosaicism,
and can signiﬁcantly impact genetic variability, gene expression,
phenotypic variability, disease, cancer, evolution and adaptation
(Zhang et al., 2009). They may also be referred to as copy
number abberations, changes, differences or polymorphisms de-
pending on the discipline, context and the level of speciﬁcity. At
the genome scale, CNVs can be detected using a variety of meth-
ods, including microarray and next-generation sequencing ana-
lysis. After detection, ﬁnding CNVs present in many samples
(recurrent CNV regions) can indicate commonly inherited
CNVs or mutation hotspots generating CNVs. Finding unique
CNV events can indicate potential candidate mutations relevant
to disease or other phenotypic variants. We introduce HD-CNV,
which takes any collection of CNV calls as input, detects recur-
rent regions based on percentage overlap and creates a unique
graphical visualization of clusters of overlapping CNV regions
across samples. Other software exists to analyse overlapping
CNV calls and ﬁnd recurrent copy number variable regions
among samples (Cazier et al., 2012; Forer et al., 2010; Kim
et al., 2012; Subirana et al., 2011; Wittig et al., 2010).

HD-CNV is unique, in that it analyses CNV events using interval
graphs (Lekkerkerker et al., 1962) and gives a visual karyotype
for quick identiﬁcation of recurrent and unique CNVs across the
genome.

2 METHODS

HD-CNV imports pre-formatted CSV ﬁles containing previously de-
tected CNV events. CNV events are treated as nodes in an interval
graph. Interval graphs, in general, are used to represent regions (intervals)
on a real line, and edges are added where intervals overlap (Lekkerkerker
et al., 1962). Here, edges are added between nodes that share the
user-speciﬁed base pair overlap required to consider two CNV events
part of a ‘merged region’ (default 40%) (Fig. 1). Users also indicate the
overlap required for a ‘family’ (region with highly similar CNV events,
default 99%).

Once the graphs have been built, the Bron Kerbosch Clique Finder
algorithm (Bron et al., 1973) returns all cliques (groups of nodes com-
pletely interconnected), which are reported as merged regions. Merged
regions, therefore, contain a collection of CNV events, which each over-
lap all others in the merged region by the minimum overlap speciﬁed and
indicate the genomic location in which that group of overlapping CNVs is
found. They can be of any size from two to the number of detected CNVs
depending on the input, and they will be detected by HD-CNV with
100% accuracy.

Human sample data were collected from Complete Genomics
(Drmanac et al., 2010) publicly available diversity dataset, which includes
CNV calls from their assembly software platform (version 2.0.0.26) for 46
individuals from diverse genetic backgrounds (including individuals from
China, Japan, Kenya, Italy, USA and Nigeria). HD-CNV was applied
to the data, and the graph ﬁles generated were visualized using Gephi
(Fig. 2). Within each circular graph (one per chromosome), clusters
(merged regions) are visible as circular substructures, whose size is pro-
portional to the number of CNV events in the merged region. With 12 100
unique CNV events, HD-CNV runs in 62 s on an 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7
with 16GB of random access memory.

Fig. 2. Karyotype of CNV events in human chromosomes numbered 1—22, X and Y, as visualized from HD-CNV generated graph ﬁles. Graph: each graph
represents events for one chromosome. The size of the graph is relative to the total events observed on that chromosome. Node: a dot indicates a CNV event
(ampliﬁcation or deletion), and all nodes are the same size. Edges: lines connect CNV events whose genomic regions overlap by at least 40%. Colour: dark
indicates events with a high number of overlap with other events, while light indicates some level of overlap and medium is almost no overlap

3 APPLICATION

HD-CNV identiﬁes recurrent CNV regions and allows for
high-level visualization of the relative number of CNV events on
each chromosome, clusters of overlapping CNV events and iso-
lated CNV events. It can be used for qualitative exploratory ana-
lysis on data from any organism, and it does not require
additional reference data or annotation. Statistical analysis can
be done up- or downstream as appropriate for the dataset. It can
be used to compare CNV calls from multiple programs for con-
cordance or discordance as in, for example, tumour/normal
sample comparisons. It has been tested on data from different
species (human and mouse) and data from different CNV calling
platforms. HD-CNV generates various output ﬁles, including:

‘Graph ﬁles’ can be used for large scale visualization, allowing
quick identiﬁcation of areas for further study. CNV events, or
merged regions from the graph, can be found in the track ﬁles.

‘UCSC Genome Browser track ﬁles’ contain the merged re-
gions and the original CNV events, including base pair locations,
which allows cross referencing with other genomic data and
features.

4 RESULTS

We have used our program to analyse CNVs detected in humans
from a diverse genetic background (Fig. 2). The darker clusters
indicate a CNV event that is recurrent in all samples, which may
indicate CNVs common among many human populations.
Individual nodes, and smaller clusters, show rare CNV events
that may be limited to certain individuals and sub-populations.
This genome-scale visualization gives a summary of copy
number variability in this large sample set on each chromosome.

As an increasing number of investigators are able to detect
CNVs in large numbers of samples, HD-CNV will facilitate ana-
lysis and visualization of the data and direct researchers to
regions of interest for veriﬁcation and further biological study.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Deciphering the modus operandi of dysregulated cellular
mechanisms in cancer is critical to implicate novel cancer genes and
develop effective anti-cancer therapies. Fundamental to this is meticu-
lous tracking of the behavior of core modules, including complexes
and pathways across speciﬁc conditions in cancer.

Results: Here, we performed a straightfonzvard yet systematic identi-
fication and comparison of modules across pancreatic normal and
cancer tissue conditions by integrating PPI, gene-expression and
mutation data. Our analysis revealed interesting change-patterns in
gene composition and expression correlation particularly affecting
modules responsible for genome stability. Although in most cases
these changes indicated impairment of essential functions (e.g. of
DNA damage repair), in several other cases we noticed strengthening
of modules possibly abetting cancer. Some of these compensatory
modules showed switches in transcription regulation and recruitment
of tumor inducers (e.g. SOX2 through overexpression). ln-depth ana-
lysis revealed novel genes in pancreatic cancer, which showed sus-
ceptibility to copy-number alterations (e.g. for USP15 in 17 of 67
cases), supported by literature evidence for their involvement in
other tumors (e.g. USP15 in glioblastoma). Two of the identiﬁed
genes, YWHAE and DISC1, further supported the nexus between
neural genes and pancreatic carcinogenesis. Extension of this assess-
ment to BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast tumors showed specific differ-
ences even across the two sub-types and revealed novel genes
involved therein (e.g. TRIM5 and NCOA6).

1 INTRODUCTION

Cancer is the outcome of an intricate interplay of dysregulated
mechanisms that are otherwise responsible for maintaining the
genomic integrity of the cell. Although our current knowledge of
these mechanisms is inadequate to fully understand cancer, im-
mense efforts are underway to identify novel ‘cancer genes’
(oncogenes) and implicate known ones for novel roles in
cancer—for example, the recent implication of SOX2 as a fre-
quently ampliﬁed gene resulting in fusion and ampliﬁcation of

transcription factor MYCLl involved in small-cell lung cancer
(Rudin et al., 2012).

Methods for computational identiﬁcation of disease genes
look mainly for genes that are differentially expressed, have simi-
lar expression proﬁles with known disease genes, are ‘central’ or
‘reachable’ in disease molecular networks or have disease asso-
ciations in literature (reviewed in Doncheva et al., 2012). Some
examples include ENDEAVOUR (Tranchevent et al., 2008) and
GeneRanker (Gonzalez et al., 2008).

A crucial distinguishing factor of cancer genes is that they
belong to core mechanisms responsible for genome stability
and cell proliferation (e. g. DNA damage repair and cell cycle)
and function as highly synergetic or coordinated groups.
Therefore, critical to implicating novel genes is the identiﬁcation
of core modules including pathways and complexes dysregulated
in cancer. For example, Lage et al. (2007) identiﬁed disease com-
plexes and used them in a Bayesian predictor to rank genes
involved in epithelial ovarian cancer. Kim et al. (2009) traced
back paths through the human protein interaction (PPI) network
from differentially expressed genes (target) to genes harboring
mutations (causal) and successfully applied this approach to
identify disrupted pathways in glioblastoma multiforma. On
the other hand, Liu et al. (2012a) used an interaction enrichment
analysis to identify pairs of genes whose relationships differed
between normal and cancer. Through their Gene Interaction
Enrichment and Network Analysis (GENIA), the authors cate-
gorized interaction proﬁles as cooperative (expressions corre-
lated), competitive (expressions anti-correlated), redundant
(suppression of both causes dysfunction) and dependent (expres-
sion of one is dependent on the other), and then mined these
proﬁles in breast and pancreatic cancers to identify dysregulated
pathways. Liu et al. (2012b) incorporated gene expression into
annotated pathways to quantify ‘pathway activity’ patterns in
cancer. Subsequently, the authors extracted these patterns
using a feature-selection model on a PPI network to construct
a ‘pathway interaction network’. Sub-networks in this pathway
network represented distinct pathways and their cross-talk in
cancer.

Apart from identifying modules, it is necessary to understand
the modus operandi or the underlying ‘program’ driving these
disruptions, and this requires systematic tracking of the behavior
of these modules under cancer conditions. For example, Zhang
et al. (2012) mined tightly connected gene co-expression sub-net-
works across >30 cancer networks (cell lines) and tracked aber-
rant modules as frequent sub-networks appearing across these
cancers. However, studying multiple cancers simultaneously
makes it challenging to discern clearly the intricate underlying

mechanisms; different genes are involved in different cancers and
even different cancer sub-types, and their roles across these can-
cers are also different. What is required, therefore, is a systematic
method to track gene and module behavior across speciﬁc con-
ditions in a controlled manner (e. g. between normal and a cancer
type or between speciﬁc cancer sub-types).

In addition, it is important to effectively integrate ‘multi-
omics’ data into such an analysis—for example, from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA): http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/.
Multi-omics data integration as such has attracted attention
during the past few years—for example, Chu and Chen (2008)
combined PPI and gene expression data to construct a cancer-
perturbed PPI network in cervical carcinoma to study gain- and
loss-of—function genes as potential drug targets. Masica et al.
(2011) correlated somatic mutations and gene expression to iden-
tify novel genes in glioblastoma multiforma (e. g. SYNEl, KLF 6,
F GF R4 and EPHB4). Zhang et al. (2012) integrated DNA
methylation, gene expression and microRNA expression data
in 385 ovarian cancer samples from TCGA and performed
‘multi-dimensional’ analysis to identify disrupted pathways.
Magger et al. (2012) combined PPI and gene expression data
to construct tissue-speciﬁc PPI networks for 60 tissues and
used them to prioritize disease genes. Finally, Zhao et al.
(2012) proposed an iterative model to combine mutation and
expression data and used it to identify mutated driver pathways
in multiple cancer types.

Putting all these ﬁndings together, we note (i) it is crucial to
study the behavior of modules across speciﬁc conditions in a
controlled manner to understand the modus operandi of cancer
mechanisms and to implicate novel genes; and (ii) although most
existing methods concentrate on ‘mountain’ genes that show dis-
tinct aberrant behavior in cancers, there are many more ‘hills’
that often do not display such drastic changes Wood et al.,
2007). These ‘hills’ are contours, and they may not be identiﬁable
through their own behavior, but their changes are quantiﬁable
when considered in conjunction with other genes (e.g. as mod-
ules); these genes may not be differentially expressed, but they
are differentially co-expressed with other genes. These points are
substantiated further in the following analyses.

1.1 An initial analysis

We performed an integrated analysis combining 29 600 inter-
actions among 5824 proteins from Biogrid (Stark et al., 2011)

and 39 paired normal and tumor gene expression samples from
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients (Badea
et al., 2008) to study the behavior of genes and their modules
in the tumor vis-a—vis normal (more details later).

We computed the gene expression correlationwise distribution
of physically interacting gene (protein) pairs for normal
and tumor conditions (co-expression is measured as Pearson cor-
relation; we use the terms genes and proteins interchangeably)
(Fig. 1a). We noticed a signiﬁcant reduction in correlation of
gene pairs in tumor vis-a—vis normal—a reduction in 8701
highly correlated interactions (of absolute correlation Z 0.50).
This comprised a possible loss of positively correlated ‘acceler-
ators’ (interactions driving normal cellular processes) and nega-
tively correlated ‘brakes’ (interactions suppressing tumor
inducers and genome instability). Interestingly, the analysis of
‘jumps’ (increase or decrease) in correlation revealed two inter-
actions, RBPMS—RHOXF2 and SMNl—TMSB4X, displaying
extreme jumps [from :l:(0.9,1) to :l:(0.9,1)] (Supplementary
Files). Among these, RHOXF2, with no noticeable change in
expression level (mean of 4.67 and 4.34, respectively), has been
recently implicated as a cancer promoter (Shibata—Minoshima
et al., 2012).

We next extracted 529 modules of interacting genes from the
PPI network, and we computed a correlationwise distribution of
these modules for normal and tumor (Fig. 1b). We noticed a
reduction in correlation for 79 modules (of correlation 2 0.4),
two of which included the cancer-promoter SOX2 contributing
to the reduction.

Taking these ﬁndings into account, we hypothesize that mod-
ules displaying differential behavior constitute cancer modules,
and they harbor cancer genes. We devise a systematic method to
identify these modules and genes by tracking their behavior
across speciﬁc conditions. We apply our method to two case
studies—normal versus PDAC and BRCA1 versus BRCA2
breast tumors. We call our method CONTOUR [Cancer
(Onco) geNes from disrupTed mOdUles and their
Relationships].

2 METHODS

Using the human PPI network as a backbone, we infer two tissue condi-
tion-specific PPI networks, one for normal and one for tumor, by incor-
porating expression and mutation proﬁles of genes in the two conditions

Dysregulated modules and novel genes in cancer

 

(Fig. 2). Next, adopting a maximal clique-merging approach, we extract
distinct modules from the two conditional networks. We then match
normal and tumor modules to identify key ones displaying changes in
gene composition or co-expression, and we isolate genes involved therein.
We evaluate these genes for potential roles in cancer.

2.1 Inferring normal and tumor PPI networks

Using human protein interactions, we ﬁrst construct the generic PPI net-
work H : (VH, EH), where VH is the set of proteins and EH is the set of
interactions. Every interaction e = (p, q) e E H has a weight r(p, q)
(between 0 and 1) reﬂecting the reliability of the interaction.

2.1.] Expression proﬁles By integrating gene expression and muta-
tion proﬁles, we construct two tissue condition-specific PPI networks from
H—the normal H N and tumor H T networks as follows. Let E be the set
of all possible gene pairs. First, consider the normal (N) condition.
We compute the correlationwise frequency distribution pEH for the
interacting gene pairs E H g E: we construct bins of size 0.10 in the
range [0,1] by including all gene pairs (p, q) 6 EH into bin pg: if
x 5 |PCC((p,q),N)| <x + 0.10, where |PCC((p,q),N)| is the absolute
Pearson correlation of (p,q) under the normal condition (the last bin
also includes pairs with correlation 1). Similarly, we calculate a second
distribution pE\EH, for the non-interacting gene pairs, E\EH. Now, given
these two distributions, the probability that a pair (p,q) with correlation
in [x, x + 0.1) coinciding with an interaction is,

lio‘x)
Pap. q) = Pr[(p, q) e EHip] =  (1)
ipEHi + |PE\EH|

where |p(Ex11| and |p(Ex\)EH| are the frequencies of the bins containing (p,q) in

the two distributions, respectively (for derivation, see Supplementary
Files).

2.1.2 Mutation proﬁles For every gene, p e VH, let l(p) (between 0
and 1) represent the likelihood of p to be involved in tumorigenesis by
undergoing mutations. We expect this likelihood to be related to the
interactivity of p. So, we infer the mutation coeﬂicient for every pair
(p, q) e E as MCC(p, q) = max{l(p),l(q)}. As aforementioned, we com-
pute the mutation coeﬂicientwise frequency distributions 10EH and 10E\EH
for the gene pairs in EH and E\E H, respectively. We infer the probability
that any pair (p,q) with mutation coefﬁcient in [x,x + 0.1) coinciding
with an interaction as,

where Mg"; and I10(Ex\)EH| are the frequencies of the bins containing (p,q) in

We then infer the weight rN(p, q) in H N by sealing r(p, q) with a
combined naive Bayesian probability (see Supplementary Files for deriv-
ation) as,

rN(p, q) = r(p, q)*
PP(p9 g) * P1/I(p9 g) 
PP(p9q)*PiP(p9q)+(1 _Pp(p9q))*(1 _P¢(p9q)).

The weights in the tumor PPI network H T are inferred similarly.

We reﬂect the expression and mutation ‘landscapes’ of genes onto their
interactions in the two conditions. We capture these landscapes through
the expressionwise and mutationwise frequency distributions of gene
pairs. So, by re—weighting the interactions in the generic PPI network
based on these distributions, we infer the two conditional PPI networks.
We do not change the topology of the network, only re-weight the inter-
actions. Note here that (i) we assume independence between expression
and mutation proﬁles of genes, although this is not necessarily the case
(see Masica et al., 2011); and (ii) in the normal condition, mutation pro-
ﬁles may not be available; therefore, setting M CC(p, q) = 0, Equation (2)
evaluates to a constant |EH| / |E| for every (p, q) e E H. But, in general, this
formulation covers conditions where mutation proﬁles are available.

 

2.2 Identifying modules from the PPI networks

Our module-identiﬁcation algorithm is based on clique-merging, similar
to the ones previously proposed for identifying complexes from PPI net-
works (Liu et al., 2009; Srihari and Leong, 2013). Our algorithm works in
two steps: in the ﬁrst step, it ﬁnds all maximal cliques from the PPI
network and ranks them in non-increasing order of their weighted inter-
action densities, and in the second step, it merges highly overlapping
cliques to build modules.

We identify the set C of all maximal cliques of size at least k in the PPI
network using a fast depth-ﬁrst search with pruning-based algorithm
(CLIQUES) by Tomita et al. (2006). Next, for every clique C e C, we
calculate its weighted interaction density dw(C) as,

(p2) r(p, q)

d = L 4
.16) I CI ( )

2

We rank these cliques in non-increasing order of their weighted densities,
{C1, C2,  , Cm}, and go through this ordered list repeatedly merging
highly overlapping cliques to build modules. Speciﬁcally, for every
clique C,- in the list, we repeatedly look for a clique C]- (j>i) such that
the overlap |C,- ﬂ CjI/ICj| Z to, a predeﬁned overlap-threshold. If such a

C]- is found, we calculate the weighted inter-connectivity 1,, between the
non-overlapping proteins of C,~ and  as follows,

r(p, q)
PE{Ci\Cj}s qE{Cj\Ci}

MC” C” lCi\le-le\Cz-l (5)
If IW(C,-, Cj) Z tm, a predeﬁned merge-threshold, then  is merged into C,~
forming a module, else C]- is discarded.

We capture the effect of differences in interaction weights between
normal and tumor through the weighted density-based ranking of cliques.
Weighted density assigns higher rank to larger and stronger cliques.
Therefore, we expect cliques with lost proteins or weakened interactions
(expected in tumor) to go down the rankings resulting in altered module
generation, thereby capturing changes in modules between normal and

tumor.

2.3 Comparing modules across conditions

Let S 2 {S1, S2,  ,Sn} and T 2 {T1, T2,  , Tm} be the sets of modules
identiﬁed from the networks H N and H T, respectively. For each S,- e S,
we calculate its module correlation density as follows,

Z P CC((P, Q),N)
dcc(Si) = Aqes‘.

The correlation densities for tumor modules T are calculated similarly.

We identify the set I‘(S, T) of disrupted or altered module pairs by
modeling it as a maximum weight bipartite matching (Gabow, 1976) as
follows. We ﬁrst build a similarity graph M 2 (VM, EM), where
VM 2 {S U T}, and EM 2 U {(Si, Tj) : J(S,-, Tj) Z t], ACC(S,-, 7}) Z 6},
where J(S,-, Tj) = |S,- (1 EMS, U le is the Jaccard similarity and
ACC(S,-,  = Idcc(S,-) — dcc(TJ-)| is the differential correlation density be-
tween Sl- and I}, and t J and 8 are thresholds. Every edge (Si, Tj) is
weighted by J(S,-, Tj). We next identify the disrupted module pairs
I‘(S, T) by ﬁnding the maximum weight matching in M, and we rank
them in non-increasing order of their differential density Ace.

Finally, we infer genes involved in cancer as O = {g : g e S,- U 7},
(Si, Tj) e I‘(8, T )} ranked in non-increasing order of ACC(S,-, 7}).

To identify altered modules, we match normal and tumor modules by
setting a high t J, which ensures that the module pairs either have the same
gene composition or have lost or gained only a few genes (6. g. if
|S,-| = 8, |Tj| = 9, then t] = 2/3 requires at least an overlap of 7).
Among these, the module pairs showing higher differential correlation
are ranked higher. Further, we expect cancer genes to be harbored within
these module pairs and rank them likewise.

2.4 Preparation of experimental data

We gathered Homo sapiens PPI data inferred from multiple low- and
high-throughput experiments deposited in Biogrid v3.1.93 (Stark et al.,
2011). To minimize false-positives, we used a scoring scheme, Iterative-
CD (Liu et al., 2009) with 40 iterations, to assign a reliability score to
every interaction in the PPI network. The score (between 0 and 1) reﬂects
the reliability of interactions by accounting for the number of common
neighbors shared among the proteins in each pair. Discarding low-scoring
interactions (<0.20) resulted in a PPI network of 29 600 interactions
among 5824 proteins (average node degree 10.165). We gathered 39
matched pairs (78 total) of normal and tumor gene expression samples
resected from 36 PDAC patients, from studies by Badea et al. (2008)
(NCBI GEO accession GSE15471). We gathered pancreatic mutation
proﬁles from the Supplementary Materials of Jones et al. (2008). These
authors identiﬁed four kinds of mutations, viz. somatic, homozygous
deletion, ampliﬁcation and driver mutations, of which genes with somatic
and driver mutations were assigned mutation scores (between 0 and 1)
that reﬂected the likelihood of these mutations in driving tumorigenesis.
We collated these scores and assigned a score of 1 to all deleted and
ampliﬁed genes to construct mutation proﬁles for 1169 genes in pancre-
atic cancer.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Experimental settings and initial validations

We ﬁrst tested our module-extraction procedure on the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPI network, as the available ‘gold
standard’ set of complexes in yeast is reasonably complete and
well-deﬁned. After testing a range of parameters, setting k=4,
t0 = 0.50 and tm = 0.25 resulted in the best recall (sensitivity) of
72% and precision (speciﬁcity) of 83% and a Gene Ontology-
based functional coherence of 76% for the modules. Therefore,
we maintained these settings for our experiments. We also note
that by relaxing the parameters to to = 1/3 and tm = 1 / 10, the
functional coherence was maintained at 61%, indicating the

modules corresponded to larger complex-groups and pathways
(details in Supplementary Files).

3.2 Analyzing disruptions in tumor PPI network

The normal H N and tumor H T networks displayed roughly equal
numbers of interactions, as well as average scores (weights)i
27 277 and 27 266 interactions with average scores of 0.208 and
0.210, respectively. Figure 3a shows no signiﬁcant differences in
the score distributions of the two networks (Kolmogorov—
Smirnov test: D NT 2 0.1556 <Ka=0,05 = 1.36). However, examin-
ing these interactions more carefully, we found 3746 interactions
that showed changes in scores. Of these, we extracted those with
score changes 2 0.10, which included 176 interactions showing
decrease (weakening) and 135 interactions showing increase
(strengthening) of scores from normal to tumor. Similar analysis
using expression correlations (Fig. 3b) identiﬁed ~8700 inter-
actions showing lower correlations and ~2100 interactions
showing higher correlations in tumor than normal
(Kolmogorov—Smirnov test: D NT 2 23.11 >Ka=0,05 = 1.36).

DAVID-based (Dennis et al., 2003) functional analysis of
genes involved in these 311 (2 176+ 135) interactions showed
signiﬁcant enrichment (P<10_20) for the following biological
process terms: mitotic cell cycle, cell division, DNA repair, chro-
matin modiﬁcation, anaphase-promoting complex-dependent
mechanisms and ubiquitin-protein ligase activity during cell
cycle. We found key DNA damage repair (DDR) and cell
cycle players, including BRCAl (homologous recombination
during DDR), RAD21 (DDR and cell cycle), FANCA (part of
F anconi anemia group, closely related to BRCAl-pathways),
INO80 (chromatin remodeling) and MCM2 (DNA replication)
involved in these interactions. The pair TGFBRl-TGFBR2,
showing an increase from 0.34 to 0.56, is involved in transform-
ing growth factor (TGF)-,B signaling and is implicated in pancre-
atic cancer (Jones et al., 2008). RAD21, involved in at least four
of the rescored interactions, is a key player in DDR and has been
implicated in breast cancer OK an et al., 2012).

3.3 Analyzing disruptions in tumor modules

We next performed a comparative analysis of normal 8 and
tumor T modules to understand disruptions at the module
level. Overall we noticed that the total number of modules, as
well as average modules sizes, were almost the same across the
two conditions (Table 1). The reason is that the interaction
scores were roughly the same (Fig. 3a), resulting in similar
module generation in both conditions.

But Table 1 also shows an overall decrease in correlation in
tumor modules, which was not entirely unexpected given our
analysis in Section 1.1. Further, this decrease had affected
mainly the highly correlated modules (Fig. 4). In particular,
there was a reduction in 45 (of 66) modules with correlation
3 0.4 from normal to tumor. DAVID-based analysis of these
45 modules (Fig. 5) showed signiﬁcant enrichment (P<10_°3)
for core signaling pathways, including KRAS signaling, TGF-
,6-signaling, Wnt-signaling, P53-apoptosis, cell cycle and DNA
repair; these pathways are genetically altered in 80% of pancre-
atic tumors (Jones et al., 2008).

Next, we computed the set of matching modules 1‘(8,’D,
giving |F(8,T)| = 452, for t] = 0.67 and 8 = 0.10. We further

giving |F’(8, T)| = 240 and |F”(S, T)| = 212. We computed the
absolute differential correlation Ace of these subsets, as shown in
Table 2. Interestingly, this demonstrated a marginal increase in
correlation for 212 modules in tumor vis-a-vis normal, with a
maximum increase of 0.353. However, DAVID-based analysis
showed enrichment for similar terms in both 1"(8,’D and
F” (8, T), which was not speciﬁc enough to differentiate the
roles of the two subsets and, therefore, whether compensatory
or tumor-driving mechanisms coming into play. This prompted
further in-depth analysis of the modules.

3.4 In-depth analysis of disrupted modules

Of the 452 module pairs in F(8, T), 431 had the same gene com-
positions, and of these, 226 showed decrease and 205 showed
increase in their correlations in tumor.

3.4.1 Modules with the same gene compositions Among the 205
strengthened modules, we noticed a few interesting cases of mod-
ules in tumor being strongly (positive and negative) regulated by
different transcription factors from the ones in normal. For ex-
ample, the module (RUVBLl, RUVBL2, HJURP and CENPA)
showed a weak correlation density of —0.086 in normal, indicat-
ing inactivity of the module. We found this module was (weakly)
regulated by the transcription factor-complex TAL 1—TCF4 with
the gene correlations with TALl being (0.34, —0.21, 0.31 and
0.64) and with TCF4 being (0.48, —0.41, 0.34 and 0.47).
However, in tumor, the correlation of the module had strength-
ened to 0.758, a steep increase of 0.844. Further, the gene cor-
relations with TALl had decreased to (—0.35, 0.06, —0.64 and
—0.50), whereas with TCF4 had increased steeply to (0.89, 0.69,
0.87 and 0.91), and TALl and TCF4 had themselves become
anti-correlated (—0.25). This indicated an increase in activity of
the module with strong positive regulation by TCF4.
Interestingly, Jones et al. (2008) identiﬁed TCF4, a component
of the Wnt/Notch signaling pathway, as an altered gene in 100%
of pancreatic tumors.

3.4.2 Modules with changes in gene compositions Analysis of the
remaining 21 module pairs that changed gene compositions re-
vealed an interesting swapping phenomenon—new genes had

replaced existing genes, forming physical interactions with the
remaining ones in these modules in tumor. For example, the
normal module (HDAC2, HDAC1, MTA2, MTA1, CHD4
and BCL11B) had changed to (HDAC2, HDAC1, MTA2,
MTA1, CHD4, SIN3A and SOX2) in tumor with BCL11B
replaced by SIN3A and SOX2, and the module correlation had
increased by 0.137. SOX2 regulates transcriptional network of
oncogenes (Chen et al., 2012) and is implicated in small-cell lung
cancer (Chen et al., 2012; Rudin et al., 2012); SIN3A is a tran-
scriptional repressor implicated in breast cancer (Ellison-Zelski
and Alarid, 2010), whereas BCL11B is involved in lymphoid
malignancies (Satterwhite et al., 2001). We hypothesize that
these gene-swapping events in modules were indicative of
tumor disruptions; therefore, they are relevant to understand
cancer.

In our computational model, modules change gene compos-
itions only when the ranking of constituting cliques changes,
resulting in altered clique-merging between conditions (Section
2.2). The cliques are re-ranked only when their constituting inter-
actions are rescored. A total of 311 interactions were re-scored
between normal and tumor (Section 3.2), and these constituted
53 cliques (of sizes 5—7) of the total ~5470 cliques present in each
network. The jumps in ranks (average 4) noticed for these 53
cliques were higher than the jumps (average 1) noticed for the
remaining cliques. These 53 cliques contributed to modules that
showed changes in gene compositions.

DAVID-based functional analysis of the 311 rescored inter-
actions showed signiﬁcant (P<10_2°) enrichment for key
genome-stability mechanisms, including DDR and cell cycle (re-
visit Section 3.2). The 21 altered modules showed signiﬁcant
(P<10T66) enrichment for these mechanisms, and also for the
following Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathways (P<10_°3): cell cycle, DNA replication, Wnt-sig-
naling, TGF-,6 signaling and P53-based apoptosis, all of which
have been implicated in the Jones et al. (2008) study on pancre-
atic cancer. In addition to this, of the 31 genes that had swapped,
six (TP53, KRAS, SFN, SMAD4, CDKN2A and ARID1A) are
implicated in pancreatic cancer, and 19 are included in KEGG
pathways in cancer (Supplementary Files). These observations
provide evidence that the gene-swapping events in our model
are strongly indicative of genes and modules relevant to cancer.

We next describe an example of a gene-swapping event to aid
interpret its relevance to cancer mechanisms. Figure 6 shows a
normal-tumor module pair in which F AM175B was replaced by
TP53. This was the consequence of a weakened FAM175B-
clique displaced in ranking by a strengthened TP53 clique. It is
known that the expression level of TP53 is low in normal cells,
whereas DNA damage triggers increase in TP53 expression,
which is responsible for activating transcription of DNA repair
proteins. FAM175B is a member of the BRISC complex, respon-
sible for recruitment of BRCA1—BARD1 heterodimer to sites of
DNA damage at double-strand breaks. We noticed the TP53-
expression level had increased from 5.86 (normal) to 6.56
(tumor) (Table 3), and the correlation of the module (RAD51,
BRCA1, TP53, SUMOl and UBC) had increased from 0.123
(normal) to 0.352 (tumor). This indicated activation of DNA
repair proteins, RAD51 and BRCA1 in the presence of TP53,
which are components of the homologous recombination
double-strand break repair pathway. The correlation of the
module (FAM175B, BRCC3, BRE and BARD1), which repre-
sented the BRISC complex, had reduced from 0.381 (normal) to
0.144 (tumor). This indicated possible impairment of DDR
mechanisms observed in cancer cells.

3.5 Evaluating predicted genes in PDAC

3.5 .1 Evaluation against ‘gold standard’ We evaluated our pre-
dicted genes against three gold standard (benchmark) lists for
pancreatic cancer, namely, OMIM (pancreatic #260350)
(Hamosh et al., 2004), COSMIC Classic (Bamford et al., 2004)
and the Jones et al. (2008) study. We gathered our predicted
genes from module pairs showing differential correlation
Z 0.10, giving 143 genes.

We calculated recall (sensitivity) values as the fraction of
benchmark genes covered by the top R-predicted genes. When
R: 143 (taking all predicted genes), the recall values were
OMIM: 78% (7/9), COSMIC: 67% (12/18) and Jones: 43%
(37/86) (Fig. 7a). When R = 25, the recall values were OMIM:
78% (7/9), COSMIC: 55% (10/18) and Jones: 19% (16/86). The
top 7 genes (R = 7) belonged to all the three benchmarks. Finally,
ﬁve of our predicted genes, coding for transcription factors JUN,
SMAD3, CEBPA, F OS and STAT3, were conﬁrmed recently as
biomarkers in PDAC Minter et al., 2012).

3.5.2 Assessment using differential expression of genes There
were 2559 differentially expressed genes in the PPI network
(adjusted P <0.001) of which 1362 (or 53.23%) belonged to at
least one module. The top three-enriched terms for these 1362
genes were the biological processes (P<10_2°): cell cycle, DNA
repair and chromatin modiﬁcation, and the KEGG pathways
(P<10_°3): KRAS signaling, Wnt-signaling and P53-based
apoptosis; these processes and pathways are genetically altered
in at least 80% of pancreatic tumors (Jones et al., 2008). The top
three enriched terms for the remaining 1197 differentially ex-
pressed genes were the biological processes (P<10_1°): cytoskel-
eton organization, actin ﬁlament-based process and intracellular
transport, and the KEGG pathways (P<10TO3): regulation of
actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion and endocytosis; these are rele-
vant to cancer cell migration and metastasis Wamaguchi and
Condeelis, 2007). These genes were failed to be drawn into

modules because of lack of sufﬁcient interactions, in particular
the membrane interactions; these interactions are involved in
intracellular transport, response to cell migratory stimuli and
metastasis. On the other hand, there were 39 genes that did
not show signiﬁcant differential expression, yet belonged to mod-
ules that showed differential correlation of at least 0.10, and
participated in cell cycle and DNA repair which are relevant to
cancer—for example, BRE and BRCC3 (Table 3). This reiterates
our motivation to track differentially co-expressed modules to
identify genes in cancer.

3.5.3 Evaluation of novel genes We next evaluated our
top-ranking novel genes for potential involvement in PDAC.
Table 4 (lower portion) lists 25 genes for which we found three
independent evidence for potential roles in pancreatic cancer: (i)
frequency of copy number alterations (CNA) summing-up copy
number gain (T), loss (1) and neutral loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) (—) from the International Cancer Genome Consortium

(ICGC) portal (http://dcc.icgc.org/web/); (ii) Q-value signiﬁcance
for amplication/deletion events at the chromosomal loci of these
genes across >3000 tumors from Tumorscape-GISTIC (http://
www.broadinstitute.org/tumorscape/); and (iii) preliminary lit-
erature pointing toward their roles in other cancers. Low
Q-values (<0.25) suggest ampliﬁcation/deletion events at the
loci are enriched by selective pressures, and focal events affect
relatively small regions of genomic DNA, spanning a few hun-
dred kilo base pairs to a couple of mega base pairs. These two
factors together are strongly indicative of presence of cancer
genes (Beroukhim et al., 2010). For example, USP15 showed
CNA in 17/67 (25.37%) donors with a signiﬁcant Q-value of
0.0255. FAM175B, encountered earlier in Figure 6, showed
CNA in 7/64 (10.94%) donors with a signiﬁcant Q-value of
0.00318. ZWINT showed 9/27 (33.34%) CNA, and recently
Zhang et al. (2012) noted that RNAi-based depletion of
ZWINT impaired homologous recombination (HR).

We found literature evidence for ﬁve of the genes, PSMA4,
SF3A2, PCNA, PSMC2 and EEF 1A1. These were among the
top 25 identiﬁed copy-number alterations yielding to cancer
liabilities owing to partial loss (CYCLOPS) genes studied by
Nijhawan et al. (2012). These authors noted that copy-number
losses that target tumor suppressor genes often involve multiple
neighboring genes that may not contribute directly to cancer
development, but their loss renders cancer cells highly vulnerable
to further suppression of those genes. These genes form the weak
links supporting cancer cells, and their targeted inhibition can be
an effective anti-cancer therapy. Interestingly, Nijhawan et al.
(2012) also found signiﬁcant enrichment for ‘proteasome’ and
‘splicesome’ among CYCLOPS genes, which supported our
enrichment analysis (Supplementary Files).

Further, the gene YWHAE was also found by two popular
gene-prioritization methods, ENDEAVOUR (Tranchevent
et al., 2008) and GeneRanker (Gonzalez et al., 2008) (Fig. 7b).
YWHAE is involved in many vital cellular processes, such as
metabolism, protein trafﬁcking, signal transduction, apoptosis
and cell cycle regulation. It acts as a tumor suppressor and its
expression is upregulated coordinately with p53 and BRCA1,
and it belongs to neurotrophin signaling pathway required for
neurogenesis (GeneCards: http://www.genecards.org/) (Safran
et al., 2002). One of our predicted genes DISCl is a regulator
of multiple aspects of neurogenesis, and it participates in
Wnt-mediated neural progenitor proliferation. The identiﬁcation
of DISCl and YWHAE further supports the nexus between
neural genes and pancreatic carcinogenesis (Biankin et al., 2012).

Finally, PCNA is a known biomarker for cell proliferation in
several cancers, and EEF1A1 has been recently implicated as a
biomarker in prostrate cell transformation and a possible hall-
mark of cancer progression (Scaggiante et al., 2012).

3.6 Differential genes in BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumors

We extended our investigation to one more case study involving
breast cancer conditions between BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumors.
Although at the onset one might not expect to see drastic differ-
ences between the two sub-types like in the case of normal versus
PDAC, surprisingly our analysis revealed some interesting quan-
tiﬁable differences between modules in the two tumors.

We obtained gene expression data from 19 BRCA1 and 30
BRCA2 familial breast tumor samples from the study by
Waddell et al. (2010). The application of our method generated
541 and 537 modules in the two tumors, respectively, with 22
module pairs showing changes both in gene composition and
expression correlation. We list here top ﬁve novel candidate
genes from these modules (Table 5) along with their proportion
of somatic mutations from ICGC ‘breast cancer’ cases (note that
ICGC is not restricted to only these two tumors; therefore, the
actual proportion might be higher) and also the Q-value signiﬁ-
cance from Tumorscape.

Hatakeyama (2011) discusses the roles of tripartite motif
(TRIM) proteins in regulating carcinogenesis. Several TRIM
members have been implicated in different cancer types, includ-
ing TRIM68, co-located with TRIM5 on chromosome 11, is

noted for overexpression in pancreatic cancer. Mahajan et al.
(2008) note possible involvement of NCOA6 in breast, colon
and lung cancers.

4 CONCLUSION

Modules including complexes and pathways work in additive,
compensatory and alternative ways to counter genome destabi-
lizing agents. Cancer is an outcome of coordinated dysfunction-
ing of these very modules; therefore, countering it necessitates an
even more coordinated and systematic approach. The consider-
able differences in module behavior between normal and cancer
and even between two sub-types of the same cancer depict the
complexity and speciﬁcity of roles that genes undertake in these
conditions. In this context, the point highlighted in Section 1, viz.

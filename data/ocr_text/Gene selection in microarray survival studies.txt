ABSTRACT

Motivation: Univariate Cox regression (COX) is often used to select
genes possibly linked to survival. With non-proportional hazards
(NPH), COX could lead to under— or over-estimation of effects.

The effect size measure c=P(T1<T0), i.e. the probability that a
person randomly chosen from group G1 dies earlier than a person
from G0, is independent of the proportional hazards (PH) assumption.
Here we consider its generalization to continuous data c/ and
investigate the suitability of c/ for gene selection.

Results: Under PH, 0/ is most efficiently estimated by COX. Under
NPH, c/ can be obtained by weighted Cox regression (WHE) or a
novel method, concordance regression (CON). The least biased and
most stable estimates were obtained by CON. We propose to use
0/ as summary measure of effect size to rank genes irrespective of
different types of NPH and censoring patterns.

Availability: WHE and CON are available as R packages.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, many studies aimed at ﬁnding prediction models
which link high—dimensional gene expression data to a survival
outcome (e. g. Beer at al., 2002; Bhattacharjee et al., 2001;
Rosenwald et al., 2002). A comparative analysis of methods used in
this context can be found in a paper by Bgzsvelstad et al. (2007). All
these methods are extensions of the basic Cox proportional hazards
regression model (COX) (Cox, 1972). This semi—parametric model
assumes that the hazard rate Ai(t|x,-) of subject 1’ at time t given a
row vector xi of log gene expression measurements is of the form

Mt lxi) = l0(t)eXP(Xii3),

where 20(t) is an unspeciﬁed baseline hazard function. Thus the
elements of ,8 are log hazard ratios (HR) associated with a unit
increase in log gene expression or a doubling of gene expression.
COX assumes proportional hazards (PH), which means that we
consider a constant effect of gene expression on survival over the
whole period of follow—up. In a typical microarray study comprising
a large number of genes the assumption of PH cannot be veriﬁed
for each gene, though it is unlikely that PH hold for each gene.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Consequently, ignoring the PH assumption and applying COX based
methods could lead to under— or over—estimation for a considerable
number of genes, meaning that some genes may be falsely declared
important for predicting survival, while at the same time relevant
genes are missed. If some genes exhibit non—proportional hazards
(NPH) then their HRs, estimated while ignoring time—dependency,
are not comparable to those of genes with PH or of genes exhibiting
different patterns of NPH. Nonetheless, very few theoretical studies
have considered the possibility of NPH and its consequences on gene
selection or prediction (Xu et al., 2005) and to our knowledge its
occurrence has never been addressed in applied studies. By contrast,
in classical applications a large body of literature exists which
deals with COX under NPH (Abrahamowicz and MacKenzie, 2007;
Collett, 2003; Marubini and Valsecchi, 1995) and the importance to
cope with the possibility of NPH was often emphasized (Valsecchi
et al., 1996). With gene expression as predictor, this has been a
neglected area of research.

Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1 show examples of genes
with PHs, converging hazards (CH) and diverging hazards (DH)
from the study of Bhattacharjee et al. (2001). For the gene with
PH (left column) the correlation of scaled Schoenfeld residuals
(Grambsch and Therneau, 1994) with the rank of time is close to 0.
For the other genes the correlation is considerably larger indicating
violation of the PH assumption. The middle column of Figure 1
shows a gene with CH, where the effect fades away with time,
whereas the gene depicted in the right column exhibits DH, i.e. an
effect increasing with time. In the Bhattacharjee study, genes with
DH are found more often than genes with CH. NPH may arise from
time—dependent effects of genes on survival, but could also result
from model misspeciﬁcation, e.g. from omitting a strong clinical
covariate or another gene. This may particularly happen in univariate
analyses.

1.1 Alternatives to COX in case of NPH

To cope with an apparent time—dependent effect of gene expression
on survival, one may model the functional form of the time—
dependency by an interaction of gene expression with arbitrary
functions of time. Suitable functions of time could be found, e.g.
by fractional polynomials or penalized regression (cf. Lehr and
Schemper, 2007) or restricted cubic splines (Hess, 1994), or by a
simple interaction with a monotonic function, e. g. the logarithm,
of survival time (Ng’andu, 1997). In this article, we do not follow
any of these approaches, because ﬁnding the best functional form
of time—dependency for a huge number of predictors may lead to
numerous problems like multicollinearity or multiple testing issues,

to name just two. Other options to cope with NPH, like stratiﬁcation
or separate modeling for different time periods (Moreau et al., 1985),
are also not feasible with microarray data. Furthermore, all these
options do not allow a comparison or ranking of genes with respect
to their ability to predict short or long survival.

In this article, we propose a semi—parametric generalization of
the well—known concordance probability as a summary measure
of effect size suitable to rank genes when some of the genes
may exhibit a time—dependent effect on survival. The concordance
probability 6 will be reviewed and its generalization 6’ presented in
Methods section, where we also introduce two methods to estimate
6’ : concordance regression (CON) and weighted Cox regression
(WHE). In Results section we present results from a simulation study
comparing the performance of COX, WHE and CON in estimating c’
under various conditions, and in producing gene lists in microarray
experiments. We will also present results of analyses of three data
sets, and close with a discussion in Section 4.

2 METHODS

2.1 The effect size measure c’ for continuous data

An intuitive non—parametric measure of separation of the survival
distributions of two groups is the concordance probability c=P(T1 < T 0),
deﬁned as the probability that a randomly chosen survival time T1 from
group G1 is smaller than a randomly chosen survival time T0 from group
Go. With uncensored data c is equivalent to the non—parametric two—sample
test statistics of Wilcoxon (1945) and Mann and Whitney (1947), and to
the area under an ROC curve (Hanley and McNeil, 1982). Assuming PH,
one can directly use the Cox regression coefﬁcient 3C associated with a
single binary covariate as an estimate of the log odds of c, i.e. 3C has
the interpretation of 10g(c/(l— c)). This interesting relationship is shown in
detail in the Appendix. Under NPH this connection to 3C no longer applies,
but 0 still is a measure with an intuitive interpretation. However, as recently
demonstrated, 0 can be approximated also under NPH by using weighted
estimation in Cox regression (Schemper et al., 2009).

Since gene expressions are continuous rather than binary, the deﬁnition of
c has to be generalized to continuous data. Assume that X denotes the logz
expression of some gene of interest. Then, such a generalization of 0 could
be deﬁned as

C/=P(T,-<Tj|x,-=xj+l),

where T,- and T]- are the survival times of randomly chosen subjects
with logz expressions x,- and xj, respectively. Since a one—unit increase

in X corresponds to a doubling of gene expression, c’ corresponds to
the probability that survival time decreases if gene expression is doubled.
Similarly, y=log[c//(l —c/)] are the log odds that the survival time
decreases if gene expression is doubled. Often, gene expression data are
standardized to a common measure of spread (e.g. the standard deviation)
across all genes and then our deﬁnition of c’ applies to a change of 1
SD. For convenience, we now assume that the log odds of concordance
I‘(x,-,xj) =logit [P (T ,- < lexl- >xj)] between two subjects with arbitrary logz
gene expression values x,- and xj are proportional to (x,- —xj). This assumption
corresponds to the linearity assumption of a PHs model, and implies that
I‘(x,-,xj)/(x,-—xj)=y irrespective of the actual values of x,- and xj. Even
under mild departures from this assumption, y may still be a useful summary
measure if redeﬁned as the expectation of I‘(x,-,xj)/(x,- —)Cj) over all pairs of
values (xi,xj):

y=E(x,-,x,-> [F (Maxi) / (Xi —Xj)]

= ffr(x,,xj)/(x,-—xj)dF(xi)dF(xj)

This quantity can be transformed into the generalized concordance
probability by c/ =exp(y)/ [l +exp(y)].

Our deﬁnition of c’ has some similarities with the concordance probability
deﬁned for time—to—event settings as CP(X, T) =P(T,- < lexl- >xj) (Genen,
2007, p. 89). CP(X, T) is purely non—parametric and could also be used with
gene expression data. Under PHs, Genen and Heller (2005) have developed
a modiﬁcation of CP(X, T) which is not sensitive to censoring. However, we
prefer c’ here, because unlike CP(X, T), c’ assumes a higher concordance
probability with higher difference in gene expression.

2.2 Estimation of c’

2.2.] Concordance regression We now propose to model c’ via its
log odds y by P(T,-<Tj|x,->xj)=exp(xiy)/[(exp(xiy)+exp(xjy)]. The
associated log likelihood and its derivative can be written as

my):2w—log[exp(xiy)+exp(xjy)]},
(iaj)

a“ )/a _Z x__xieXP(xi)/)+xjexp(xj)/)
y “(m ’ exp(x.-y)+exp(x,-y) ’

 

where summation is over all available pairs (i , j) such that t,- < tj. These pairs
(1', j) will in the sequel be denoted as ‘risk pairs’ (as opposed to ‘risk sets’
in COX), and subjects may appear in multiple risk pairs. In our model the
dependent variable is the concordance of the risk pair (i , j) and hence, setting
the ﬁrst derivative of the log likelihood to zero yields a direct estimate of
the log odds of concordance of t,- <tj related to a one—unit increase in X.
Therefore, we denote this method as concordance regression. Our approach is
semi—parametric as it does not require approximating or knowing the survivor
function S(T|X). Once an estimate )9 has been computed, 5’ can be derived
by
5/ =€XP()9)/ {1 +6Xp()9)}-

Despite the continuous nature of gene expression, in practical problems
ties in gene expression may occur. In this case, we omit risk pairs with x,- 2x]-
from the likelihood, since they do not contribute information about y or c’ .

In case of censoring, we omit all risk pairs where t,- is censored, because it
is not clear whether the true underlying survival time is less than tj. Therefore,
censoring leads to an overrepresentation of some subjects compared to others.
In order to obtain an unbiased estimate of c’ despite this overrepresentation,
we weight the risk pairs by their inverse sampling probabilities. Suitable
weights are deﬁned by

ME) = [N(0)S(ti) — 1]/[N(ti) — 11000—1,

with S(t) denoting the left continuous version of the Kaplan—Meier estimate
of the survivor function at time t, N (t) the number of patients at risk at t,
and G(t) denoting the probability to be still under follow—up at t, estimated

by Kaplan—Meier but with the meaning of the status indicator reversed. The
ﬁrst term of the weight, [N (0)S(t,-)— l] / [N (ti)— 1], restores the number of
comparisons of a subject failing at time t,- with subjects surviving that time
that would have arisen had censoring not occurred. The second term of the
weight, G(t,-)_1, puts more weight on later event times compared to earlier
times, and thus corrects the attenuation in observed events due to earlier
censorship. It permits reconstructing the density of event times in the time
range covered, i.e. till the last event. The weights w(t,-) are introduced into
the score function

Ban/8y: ZDg-wm) [xi —
(llj)

where Dl‘j is deﬁned as 1 if t,- <tj and t,- is uncensored, and 0 else. In a
censored sample, the inﬂuence of the subjects on the likelihood is not equal;
subjects with a long follow—up will contribute more information than those
who are censored early. This unequal weighting will not bias point estimates
unless, at the same time, censoring depends on gene expression and the
effect of logz gene expression is not linear. While the ﬁrst assumption can
be ruled out in most applications, linearity is a standard assumption also in
COX, and thus does not distinguish our method from others. Since only the
combined violation of both assumptions may lead to biased point estimates,
our proposed estimate can be seen as a doubly robust estimate. However,
unlike in COX, one cannot use the negative inverse of the second derivative
of the likelihood as variance estimate, since summation is done over risk pairs
and not over risk sets. Proper variance estimates can be obtained either by
the jackknife or by a robust sandwich estimate (Lin and Wei, 1989; Themeau
and Grambsch, 2000), but variance estimation will not be pursued here.

2.2.2 Weighted Cox regression Recently, Schemper et al. (2009) have
shown that by introducing weights into the score function of Cox’s partial log
likelihood, an approximative estimate 3W of the log odds of concordance y is
obtained that works well over a wide range of underlying values. The validity
of the approximation is independent of the type of non—proportionality. The
weights that are introduced are deﬁned by w(t,-) = S (ti)G(t,-)_1, with S (ti) and
G(t,-) as deﬁned above.

Another related approach was proposed by Xu and O’Quigley (2000).
These authors also introduce weights into the score function, but their weights
are deﬁned by w(t,-) =S(t,-)/N(t,-), which can be rewritten as w(t,-) = G(t,-)_1.
Their aim was to provide an average regression effect independent of the
pattern of censoring. One advantage of the approach of Schemper et al.
(2009) is the intuitive interpretation of 3W as log odds of concordance y.

2.2.3 Software WHE has been implemented in an R package
coxphw and a SAS macro WCM available at CRAN.r—project.org
and http://wwwmuw.ac.at/msi/biometrie/programs, respectively. CON for
estimation of c’ has also been implemented in an R package concreg and
is available upon request from the authors.

2.3 Gene selection based on c’

Under PH, all three methods (COX, CON and WHE) will approximately
supply similar estimates. Under NPH, however, we may expect differences
between COX and CON or WHE, but similarity of the latter. We now assume
that gene selection is done based on univariate regressions, and assume that
from all candidate genes, the top—ranked are selected for further analysis. In
our context, we rank genes by their absolute effect size c/+ = 0.5 + IC/ —0.5|,
estimated via lﬁc |, lﬁwl or |79| supplied by COX, WHE or CON, respectively.
A threshold on c/+ can be deﬁned to produce a list of ‘signiﬁcant’ genes,
and the false discovery rate (FDR) associated with that list evaluated. This
procedure is known as FDR thresholding as proposed by Tusher et al. (2001).

3 RESULTS

We evaluated COX, WHE and CON by simulating trials assessing
the association of gene expression with survival. The ﬁrst series of

simulations aimed at comparing the methods in univariate models
considering expression of only one gene the same time (‘univariate
evaluation’). These simulations should reveal differences of the
methods in estimating the generalized concordance probability 6’
under PH and various types of NPH. A second series simulated
typical gene expression studies, where we considered a large number
of genes with partly correlated expressions competing for selection
in the same study (‘multivariate evaluation’).

3.1 Simulation study: univariate evaluation

In this series of simulations, we investigated the effect of the
following factors on the distribution of c’ estimates in a factorial
design, generating 2000 samples of 200 observations for each cell:
time—dependency (PH, CH or DH), strength of effects (‘small’,
‘medium’ or ‘large’) and presence and amount of censoring (0, 33,
67%). We generated logz gene expression values from a standard
normal distribution, and survival time y from a Weibull distribution
with shape parameter 61:2 and scale parameter 1920.5. Gene
expression was linked to survival time by applying an algorithm
of MacKenzie and Abrahamowicz (2002). For time—dependency we
considered PH with ,8(t)= ,80, CH with a time—dependent log HR
of ,8(t)=,80[1—l—2.88/(1—l—5t)], and DH with ,8(t)=,80(1—l—1.86t).
,80 was determined for pre—deﬁned population values for c’ of 0.60
(‘small’ effect size), 0.66 (‘medium’ effect size) and 0.80 (‘large’
effect size). Under PH, these choices correspond to ,80 values of
log(1.5), log(2) and log(4). Further details of these computations are
given in the Supplementary Data, Section 4.1 and Supplementary
Figure 5. To simulate censoring we drew a uniformly distributed
follow—up time z from U[0, t] and deﬁned the observed survival
time as t=min(y,z) with status indicator I(z > y). We determined ‘1:
to obtain proportions of censored times of 33 and 67%.

Figure 2 shows boxplots of the estimates of c’ by COX, WHE
and CON. The dashed reference lines indicate population values
of c’. In case of PH all three methods provide approximately
unbiased estimates of c’, irrespective of the effect size and amount
of censoring, and COX shows slight efﬁciency advantages. In case
of NPH (CH, DH) however, WHE and CON have clearly lower
bias than COX, which over— or under—estimates depending on the
combination of censoring and the type of NPH. With increasing
censoring all three methods show variance inﬂation of similar
magnitude. When censoring is combined with time—dependent
effects a part of the bias can be attributed to the discrepancy of the
population value of 6’ given follow—up is restricted to a maximum
time I compared to the unrestricted c’. Across all scenarios, the
largest observed discrepancy was 0.023.

3.2 Simulation study: multivariate evaluation

The aim of the second series of simulations was to see how
the methods compare in selecting those genes which truly are
related to survival, if a large number of genes are competing
for selection. We simulated gene expressions of 1925000 features
according to a scheme outlined by Binder and Schumacher (2008),
and assumed that only the ﬁrst 72 genes had an additive effect
on the log hazard, with an equal number of 24 genes exhibiting
PH, CH and DH. From each group, we chose eight genes to
have a ‘large’ effect size and 16 genes to have a ‘small’ effect
size. As in the univariate simulation, we simulated survival times
from a Weibull (2, 0.5) distribution with the distribution function

denoted by F W (t). We linked standard normally distributed gene
expressions to survival times, assuming that the hazard of subject i
at time t is )II-(t)=)to(t)exp [ZEZIngﬂg(t)]. The time—dependent
log HR of gene g was deﬁned as ,Bg(t)= ,80 in case of PH,
,Bg(t)=,80[1—l—2.88/(1—l—5t)] for CH, and ,8g(t)=,80(1—l—1.86t) for
DH. The constants ,80 were set such that average regression effects
,0: fﬂg(t)dFW(t) of 0.4 (‘large’ effect size) and 0.2 (‘small’ effect
size) resulted. For each combination of censoring (0, 33, 67%) and
sample size (200, 800) we generated 200 data sets and assessed the
variability of results.

Each data set was analyzed using COX, WHE and CON and for
each gene 6’ was estimated. Genes were ranked by 3+ and the m
top genes were considered ‘selected’. Figure 3 shows some results
when m is set to 72, the number of genes truly associated with
survival. Results for other choices of m are given in Supplementary
Figures 9—14 and Supplementary Tables 3—8.

The average number of correctly selected genes which
corresponds to the true positive rate, TPR, under various censoring
proportions and sample sizes is graphically compared in Figure 3.
The TPR is signiﬁcantly highest for CON in scenarios with
no or 33% censoring (all paired t—tests yielded P < 10—6, cf.
Supplementary Table 9). Although CON estimates are on average
least biased, their variability is higher than that of WHE or
COX, which leads to the impaired performance of CON with
67% censoring. This could be due the unequal weighting of the
contributions to the likelihood, which can be severe when there

The total number of selected genes was 72 for each method and each scenario. The effect sizes (ES) were set to ‘small’ for 48 and to ‘large’ for 24 out of 5000 candidate genes. Total
numbers of correctly selected genes were statistically compared between the methods by paired t-tests. PH, proportional hazards; DH, diverging hazards; CH, converging hazards;

%c, percent censored; ES, effect size; N, sample size.

aThe signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01) highest total number of true positive genes is set in boldface.

If the number of selected genes m is varied, the TPR and similarly
the false positive rates change. These changes concern all methods
alike, such that we can conclude that the superior performance of
CON is independent of a particular choice for m. Generally, TPRs
are higher with a sample size of 800 compared to 200, but the general
conclusions do not change (Supplementary Fig. 7).

In Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 8, we investigate which type
of time—dependency is favored by the methods, and whether this
depends on censoring and/or sample size. Ideally, genes with equal
effect sizes should be selected with equal probability, irrespective
of the type of time—dependency (PH, DH or CH), and the censoring
pattern. We learn that this ideal situation is best accomplished by
CON, which yields the best balance between genes from all types
of time—dependency. By contrast, WHE selects CH genes more than
others, and with COX the proportions of selected genes of different
type change with increasing amount of censoring. These results are
independent of the sample size, which affects the number of selected
genes in all methods and with all types of genes in the same manner.

3.3 Application to real-life studies

We applied univariate COX, WHE and CON to all genes of
three microarray data sets and evaluated differences in gene
selection. Beer et al. (2002) studied the association of survival
and gene expression proﬁles of microarray data of 86 patients
with early—stage lung adenocarcinomas. Similarly, Bhattacharjee
et al. (2001) investigated correlation of gene expression from lung
adenocarcinomas with a survival endpoint in 125 patients. In a study
by Rosenwald et al. (2002) the survival and gene expressions of
240 patients with diffuse large B—cell lymphoma were analyzed. For
information regarding pre—processing we refer to our Supplementary
Data, Section 3.

In each data set we ranked genes by their estimated absolute effect
size 5’+. We determined the threshold value E’HZSO) such that a
predetermined number of 250 ‘selected’ genes exceed this value
in their absolute effect size. The number of false positive selections
FP was estimated as the average number of selected genes (with

E’HZSO) as threshold) in 100 versions of the data set that resulted

from permuting the survival information. The proportion of genes
not linked to survival was estimated as

G
ﬁo=ZHejg e(qzs.q7s>}/(0.SG),
g=l

where c125 and c175 are the 25th and 75th percentiles of the
permutation distribution of 5’ across all G genes and B permutations,
and 5;, is the original data estimate of gene g (Storey, 2002).
Estimates of E for the three data sets are g/igen in Supplementary
Table 1. The FDR250 was then calculated as FDR250 = FP >< Jig / 250.

Results are summarized in Table 2. In all three data sets
approximately half of the genes have a negative effect on survival,
i.e. 5’ < 0.5. The range of 5’ varies considerably between the three
data sets, with the largest range in the Beer data set (0.254—0.828
computed by CON) and the smallest range in the Bhattacharjee data
set (0.412—0.591 computed by CON). The correlation of the absolute
effect size estimates 5’+ from WHE and CON is close to 1 for all
data sets, whereas it is considerably smaller when correlating WHE
or CON with COX estimates.

If the 250 genes with the largest absolute effect size estimates
5’+ are selected the best agreement in gene selection is observed
between WHE and CON: 71, 79 and 69% in the three data sets. The
proportion of genes selected by all three methods is ~50% in all
three data sets. The smallest FID\R250 values were obtained by COX
in the Beer data (0.389), WHE in the Bhattacharjee data (0.841) and
CON in the Rosenwald set (0.369). These data dependent advantages
of the methods were also observed with higher or lower numbers
of selectedgenes (see Supplementary Table 2). In the Bhattacharjee
data the FDR250 estimate from COX selection was larger than 1, a
situation which was already anticipated by Tusher et al. (2001).

The table summarizes the number of observations and events (‘No. of obs/No. of events’), the correlation of the estimated absolute effect size (‘Cor of 5’ _I_’), the estimated false
discovery rate (‘FDR250’) and the number of genes selected in common by COX, WHE and CON when 250 genes are selected based on the estimated absolute effect size. Further

results can be found in the Supplementary Data, section 3.

have shown that it is a suitable measure to compare effect sizes
between genes irrespective of PHs. In case of PHs, c’ can be directly
computed from the Cox regression coefﬁcient BC. In case of NPH,
this relationship no longer holds. We have shown by simulation that a
novel method, CON, supplies an empirically unbiased estimate of c’ .
WHE as recently proposed approximates this value very well in most
but not all cases, and has some efﬁciency advantages over CON. Cox
regression in general fails to provide a consistent estimate of c’ in
case of NPH, and this bias is further modiﬁed by censoring. With
large proportions of censored survival times, CON estimates may
become inefﬁcient due to unequal weighting of the contributions
to the likelihood. As we have demonstrated, truncating weights of
CON at a high, e. g. the 95th percentile may then be applied to reduce
the variability of the estimates, while the amount of bias introduced
is still negligible.

If an association analysis of high—dimensional data with survival
involves a gene selection step, then a gene ranking based on
estimates of c’ may be preferable to a gene ranking based on Cox
regression coefﬁcients, because the former does not rely on the
assumption of PHs. By contrast, the gene ranking by Cox regression
does not only depend on the true effect size of the genes, but also on
the realized follow—up distribution. Thus these rankings may not be
reproducible under different follow—up schemes. We have shown by
analysis of simulated and three real data sets that gene rankings by
estimates of 6’ provided by CON or WHE may yield different results
than gene rankings by log HR estimates from Cox regression. The
rankings from WHE and CON were more similar than compared to
gene rankings from Cox regression, and the agreement of the former
two with Cox regression in an absolute sense was low in all three
data sets. We have also shown that FDR thresholding based on c’ is
straightforward.

Our investigation focused on gene selection. This was motivated
by our own experience, that most often the microarray platform
is mainly used to screen the whole genome for suitable candidate
genes. Gene expression data, reduced to a set of, say, 50—400
candidate genes, is then re—determined using a high—sensitivity
platform such as real time polymerase chain reaction, and only
from these validated expression values statistical models, often on
an even further reduced set of genes, will be developed. For some
of the methods for prediction of survival from high—dimensional
data it was proposed to use gene selection as a ﬁrst step, e. g.
supervised principal components regression (Bair and Tibshirani,
2004; Bair et al., 2006). Application of the methods investigated

in this contribution in combined selection and prediction models
like the LASSO (Park and Hastie, 2007; Tibshirani, 1997), ridge
regression (Verweij and van Houwelingen, 1994) or partial least
squares regression (Park et al., 2002) is in principle straightforward.
However, our investigation leaves the question open whether the
modest improvements in gene selection observed with WHE or
CON can contribute to improved estimation of prediction models.
Nevertheless, we consider the robustness of these methods to NPH
as being of particular advantage for real—life applications.

Thus, one may replace Cox regression by WHE or CON at any
stage of model development, to obtain prediction models without
having to assume PHs. As ﬁnal result, such prediction models supply
cross—validated risk scores to assess and compare different levels
of risk between subjects. An evaluation of the association of the
risk scores with survival using c’ may improve interpretation as it
allows quantifying the impact of the genetic information on survival,
provides a direct comparison of subjects and at the same time is
robust to violations of the PHs assumption.

APPENDIX A

A.1 EQUIVALENCE OF c/(1—c) AND THE HAZARD

RATIO UNDER PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS
Assume that Sj (t),  (t) and XI (t) denote the survivor function,
the density and the hazard function in group j, j={0, 1} at time t.
Under PH we assume that the hazard ratio is constant over time,
6(t)=)tl(t)/)to(t)=6. Thus it follows that S1(t)=S0(t)9. Deﬁne as
C=P(T1< T0)=ff1(t)SO(l). Then

c/(1 —a =P<TI < T0)/P(T0 < TI): /f1(t)50(t)//f0(t)51(t)

=f9l0(t)50(t)6+1//}~0(t)50(t)9+1=9-

Since 6=exp(,BC), we have c=exp(,8C) / [1 —l—exp(,BC)], thus under
PH we can use ,BC from a Cox regression analysis to estimate 6.

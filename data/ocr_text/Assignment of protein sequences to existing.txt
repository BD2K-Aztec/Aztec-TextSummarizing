ABSTRACT

Motivation: Automating the assignment of existing domain and pro-
tein family classifications to new sets of sequences is an important
task. Current methods often miss assignments because remote rela-
tionships fail to achieve statistical significance. Some assignments are
not as long as the actual domain definitions because local alignment
methods often cut alignments short. Long insertions in query se-
quences often erroneously result in two copies of the domain assigned
to the query. Divergent repeat sequences in proteins are often missed.
Results: We have developed a multilevel procedure to produce nearly
complete assignments of protein families of an existing classification
system to a large set of sequences. We apply this to the task of as-
signing Pfam domains to sequences and structures in the Protein Data
Bank (PDB). We found that HHsearch alignments frequently scored
more remotely related Pfams in Pfam clans higher than closely related
Pfams, thus, leading to erroneous assignment at the Pfam family level.
A greedy algorithm allowing for partial overlaps was, thus, applied first
to sequence/HMM alignments, then HMM—HMM alignments and then
structure alignments, taking care to join partial alignments split by
large insertions into single-domain assignments. Additional assign-
ment of repeat Pfams with weaker E-values was allowed after stronger
assignments of the repeat HMM. Our database of assignments, pre-
sented in a database called PDBfam, contains Pfams for 99.4% of
chains >50 residues.

Availability: The Pfam assignment data in PDBfam are available at
http://dunbrack2.fccc.edu/ProtCid/PDBfam, which can be searched
by PDB codes and Pfam identifiers. They will be updated regularly.

1 INTRODUCTION

Clustering proteins of known structures into families or super-
families is a long-standing task of particular importance in
understanding structure—function relationships and for protein
structure prediction by homology. Usually, protein classiﬁcation
in the PDB is accomplished at the level of domains—substruc-
tures that recur as functional units in different protein contexts.

Structure-based domain classiﬁcations of the PDB, such as
SCOP (Murzin et al., 1995) and CATH (Orengo et al., 1997),
are constructed by comparing the available protein structures in
the PDB and creating classiﬁcations of new folds and

superfamilies manually. Existing structure-based classiﬁcations
cover only a portion of the PDB. The most recent SCOP release
(V. 1.75A) is 2 years behind the PDB and only covers 61% of
current PDB entries. CATH was last updated in November 2011
and covers 64% of the current PDB.

Sequence-based approaches, such as Pfam (Sonnhammer
et al., 1997), ProDom (Servant et al., 2002), InterPro (Hunter
et al., 2009), SMART (Schultz et al., 1998) and SUPfam (Pandit
et al., 2002), can be readily applied to new structures because
most new structures ﬁt into existing sequence clusters. In this
way, they are well suited for rapid and automated classiﬁcation
of new structures in a way that structure-based classiﬁcations are
not. Some differences between sequence-based and structure-
based classiﬁcations occur when a single sequence domain is
structurally two or more domains with separate hydrophobic
cores or a single structural domain is two sequence domains
(Zhang et al., 2005). Structure-based methods are often superior
in recognizing remote relationships between families, as these
relationships may be apparent only from structural similarity
and in the absence of any recognizable sequence similarity.
Even with structural information, it may be difﬁcult to distin-
guish between divergent and convergent evolutionary relation-
ships (Tress et al., 2005).

Our aims in this article are two fold: ﬁrst, to develop a general
procedure that can be used to make rigorous assignments of
existing protein family classiﬁcation systems for any set of pro-
tein sequences, and second, to perform this task for the entire
PDB. For the PDB, we wish to deﬁne a method that can be run
automatically on a weekly or monthly basis. We have thus
chosen the sequence-based domain classiﬁcation given by
Pfam, as new proteins in the PDB can be readily assigned to
existing Pfams, without manual intervention required by
structure-based classiﬁcation systems.

Pfam is a database of protein families, in which each family is
represented by a hidden Markov model (HMM) created from
manually curated multiple sequence alignments (Sonnhammer
et al., 1997). The Pfam classiﬁcation of protein families has
gained widespread acceptance among biologists because of its
wide coverage of proteins and a sensible naming convention
related to protein functions and commonly used names
(Pkinase, SH2, etc.). Pfam was recently used in the Protein
Structure Initiative to select targets and divide them among dif-
ferent high-throughput centres (Dessailly et al., 2009). Some
Pfam families are seeded by structures in the PDB (Finn et al.,
2010). Two or more related Pfam families are grouped into a
Pfam clan (Finn et al., 2006). Such relationships are often

identiﬁed through structural similarity, as they are in the struc-
tural classiﬁcation systems.

Several assignments of Pfam domains to the PDB are currently
available, including Pfam itself (Punta et al., 2012), SIFTS
(Velankar et al., 2005) and the RCSB (Research Collaboratory
for Structural Bioinformatics), covering 45, 87 and 94% of
unique sequences in the PDB, respectively. Each of the currently
available sources of Pfam assignments to the PDB suffer from
one or more of a number of problems. First, because they use
only the original PDB or UniProt sequences against the Pfam
HMMs, they miss many potential assignments that occur when
the sequence is not closely related to any single Pfam family. It is
likely that sequence methods based on proﬁle—proﬁle compari-
son may identify these relationships and provide higher levels of
statistical signiﬁcance. Second, in some cases, these sources also
provide completely overlapping assignments, sometimes when
two different Pfams in the same clan align to the same region
of a PDB sequence with good E-values. If we want to cluster at
the family level and then the superfamily level, this produces
discrepancies. Third, some proteins have long insertions relative
to the Pfam HMM deﬁnition, and HMMER may produce two
alignment segments, one on either side of the insertion. These
two segments cover non-overlapping regions of the HMM, and
together should comprise a single Pfam assignment. However,
the publicly available sources simply list these separately, and
they cannot easily be distinguished from repeated domains in
the same protein. Fourth, some protein structures are composed
of two chains that together comprise a single Pfam domain, i.e.
two non-overlapping regions of the same Pfam HMM. Pfam,
SIFTS and the RCSB do not properly account for domains
split by insertions or split between different chains.

We overcome some of the deﬁciencies of other Pfam databases
using several strategies. The ﬁrst is to use consensus sequences
derived from PSI-BLAST proﬁles and to run these through the
Pfam HMM library. Such sequences can be fed to the Pfam
HMMs like any protein sequence, and they usually produce
more complete alignments with better E-values than the original
sequences. Similar techniques have been used by us previously
(Kahsay et al., 2005) and by others (Przybylski and Rost, 2008).
Secondly, we utilize HHblits (Remmert et al., 2012) to produce
HMMs for PDB sequences and their parent UniProt sequences,
and then apply HMM—HMM alignment of these HMMs against
the Pfam HMMs using HHsearch (S6ding, 2005). The third ap-
proach is to utilize structure alignment of statistically conﬁdent
and complete structures in Pfam families with weak hits in the
same Pfam families—either those with poor E-values and/or
alignments that cover only a portion of the Pfam HMM. This
allows us to verify whether a weak assignment is correct and to
extend short alignments.

Finally, we have developed a procedure for optimally combin-
ing assignments from these multiple sources into Pfam architec-
tures for each protein in the PDB. The procedure combines
non-overlapping or minimally overlapping partial assignments
to the same Pfam into single assignments, thus, accounting for
large insertions or domains split across multiple protein chains.
We assign additional repeat domains at weaker E-values if the
same repeat family is assigned earlier in the procedure at an
E-value better than the general cut-off.

We explore the properties of the regions and proteins that
cannot be assigned to a Pfam domain and the interactions be-
tween Pfam domains in the biological assemblies of structures in
the PDB, according to our Pfam assignments. Regions not as-
signed to Pfams have a greater tendency to be disordered in
protein structures and to have lower rates of regular secondary
structure than regions assigned to Pfam domains. The number of
Pfam—Pfam interactions is increased by the number of assign-
ments made using the methods described here but are also crit-
ically dependent on the usage of biological assemblies from
crystal structures rather than the asymmetric units.

The Pfam assignments can be searched through the ProtCID
server (http://dunbrack2.fccc.edu/protcid) by PDB codes,
Pfam codes and sequences. Downloadable ﬁles of the Pfam as-
signments and those proteins that cannot be assigned are also
available on the website http://dunbrack2.fccc.edu/ProtCID/
PDBfam.

Our procedure is general and can be applied to other domain
classiﬁcation systems and other target sequence sets. Even if the
target sequence set is not the PDB, structural information may
still be used for proteins in the sequence set that can be readily
aligned with proteins of known structure.

2 METHODS

2.1 Searching Pfam through PSI-BLAST consensus
sequences and HHsearch

Pfam v26 ﬁles Pfam-A.hmm and Pfam-mam were downloaded from
the Pfam website and were used as HMMER3 proﬁle databases (Finn
et al., 2010). The PDB sequences (Berman et al., 2000) were parsed from
pdbx_seq_one_letter_code records in the PDB XML ﬁles (Westbrook
et al., 2005). UniProt sequences were downloaded from the UniProt web-
site (Bairoch et al., 2005). The XML ﬁles from the SIFTS database
(Velankar et al., 2005) were used to ﬁnd the residue correspondence be-
tween the UniProt and PDB sequences.

For each unique PDB sequence, we used one iteration of our modiﬁed
PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) from MolIDE (Wang et al., 2008) to
generate a proﬁle from sequences in the UniRef90 database (Li et al.,
2000). The parameters for PSI-BLAST were ‘-e 10 -h 0.0001 -v 5000 -b
5000 -N 25 -f 16’. A PSI-BLAST proﬁle is a position-speciﬁc scoring
matrix (PSSM), which provides a log-odds score and percentage of oc-
currences for each of the 20 amino acid types at each position in the query
sequence. A consensus sequence is a 1D simpliﬁcation of a PSI-BLAST
proﬁle obtained by substituting the 20—dimensional vector in each residue
position by the highest scoring or most common amino acid observed at
that position. In this article, a ‘percentage consensus sequence’ is com-
posed of the most frequent residues in each column, whereas a ‘PSSM
consensus sequence’ is composed of the highest scoring amino acid at
each position. We also applied the same procedure to the full UniProt
sequences from which PDB sequences are derived, as identiﬁed by SIFTS.
We, thus, have the following six sets of sequences: PDB sequences,
PDB percentage consensus sequences, PDB PSSM consensus sequences,
UniProt sequences, UniProt percentage consensus sequences and
UniProt PSSM consensus sequences. In this article, we denote those se-
quences as PDB, PDB-percent, PDB-pssm, UNP, UNP-percent and
UNP-pssm, respectively. We ran HMMER3 on all six sets of sequences
against Pfam A and Pfam B HMM models. We refer to these six sets of
alignments as ‘HMMER hits’.

We ran HHblits on unique sequences in the PDB and UniProt
sequences to generate HMMs on database uniprot20_29Marll, which
is a database of HMMs created from a clustering of UniProt sequences

at 20% identity (Remmert et al., 2012). We searched the Pfam HMMs
with the HHblits—derived PDB and UniProt HMMs with HHsearch
(S6ding, 2005) to generate Pfam to PDB alignments through HMM—
HMM alignments. We refer to these as ‘HH hits’.

2.2 Pfam E-value and FATCAT P—value cut-offs

To determine the cut-off of HMMER E—values and structure alignment
P-values for each Pfam A present in the six sets of alignments, we col-
lected those Pfam hits with HMMER E—value of <10—5, HMM coverage
>09, and then selected the alignment with the largest number of match
states assigned to residues with Cartesian coordinates in the PDB struc-
tures as the representative hit. A total of 5134 Pfams were selected. With
HMMER3, we aligned each PDB sequence of these representative hits to
all of the 5134 Pfam HMMs. The resulting data points were divided into
the following two classes: same clan and different clan, depending on
whether the two Pfams were in the same or different clans according to
the clan deﬁnitions in the Pfam v26 MySQL database.

Smoothed density function curves were calculated using kernel density
estimates (Sheather and Jones, 1991) in the R project (http://www.r-
project.org/) by calculating probability density estimates of same clan
and different-clan prediction as a function of log10(E-value):

N
f(A) = $2 Kh(A — A.)
i=1

where A,- is log10(E-value), and K}, is a Gaussian kernel with bandwidth h:

K ( ) 1 ex (_X2)

x = — —

h \/ 271k p 112

The probability at A is calculated using Bayes’ rule:

P(A | same)P(Same)
P(A lsame) P(Same) + P(A |diff)P(diﬁ)

where P(Alsame) and P(Aldiff) are calculated from f(A) using the same
clan and different-clan sets of E—values, respectively. P(same) and P(diff)
are the percentages of data points from the same-clan class and the
different-clan class. From a value of A such that P(samelA)>95%, we
selected a threshold for the Pfam E-values of 10—5 (see ‘Results’ section).

To select a Pfam E—value threshold for HH hits, we applied the same
procedure on the HH alignments, which contains 5387 Pfam hits.
The threshold of HHsearch E—value for P(samelA)>95% is 10—4 (see
‘Results’ section).

We performed structure alignment with the FATCAT program (Ye
and Godzik, 2003) of each structure with every other structure in the 5134
Pfam set. The data points consisting of log10(P-values) were deﬁned as
either same clan or different clan. Kernel density estimates and Bayes’
rule were used to obtain P(samelA) where A is the log10(P-value) from
FATCAT. From the value of A such that P(samelA) > 95%, we selected a
threshold for the FATCAT P—values of 10—3 (see ‘Results’ section).

 

P(SamelA) =

2.3 General greedy algorithm

From any set of alignments of PDB sequences to Pfam HMMs, we use
the same general procedure based on a simple greedy algorithm to create
a unique assignment of a Pfam to each residue in a PDB sequence. Such
an assignment constitutes a Pfam ‘architecture’ or arrangement of do-
mains in the PDB sequence, allowing only for short overlaps.

For a given PDB sequence, we start by assigning the hit with the best
E—value. If there is any region in the query of >30 amino acids that occurs
within the boundaries of the alignment to the best HMM but which is not
aligned to HMM match states, we create a ‘split assignment’. A split
assignment indicates that match states in the HMM align to separate
non-contiguous regions of the query sequence. The residues in the
inserted region of the query are then ‘unassigned’, which means they

are available for subsequent assignments. For each additional hit in
order by E-value (best to worst), we check whether it overlaps the current
Pfam assignments by >10 residues on either end. If it does not, then an
assignment is made. Again, long insertions in the query result in split
assignments and the insertions are unassigned.

If at any time, the same Pfam model aligns more than once to a query
sequence, we check if the HMM match states align only once to the query
and in order allowing short overlaps of <10 amino acids in the HMM. If
yes, then we combine them into one assignment to the HMM. The as-
signment is split if there are >30 residues between the assigned regions,
and the intervening residues are left unassigned. If the assignments to the
Pfam cover the HMM match states more than once, then there is more
than one copy of the Pfam in the sequence (e.g. repeated domains), and
multiple assignments of the Pfam are made.

We also check whether the same Pfam aligned to different sequences
within the same PDB entry. In some cases, these hits do not overlap in the
HMM by >10 amino acids, and they are then combined into a single
assignment.

In our procedure, we always used HMMER hits ﬁrst, then HH hits.

2.4 Using structure alignments to improve Pfam
assignments

We use structure alignment to verify whether Pfam—PDB alignments with
weak E-values are correct and to extend short alignments to Pfam
HMMs. To do so, we need to identify structures (or domains within
structures) that cover Pfams in their entirety with good E-values.
We call such structures exemplars for their Pfams. Only a subset of
Pfams in the PDB has such high-quality alignments.

To identify exemplars, we ﬁrst applied the greedy algorithm on all
Pfam alignments in the six sets of sequences and consensus sequences
with a conservative HMMER E—value of 510—5, obtaining split and
combined Pfam assignments. Some split assignments may be possible
where one component has signiﬁcant E—value, whereas the other is
weaker. Therefore, we continue the greedy algorithm with alignments
with E—value of >10_5 if the same Pfam has already been assigned to
the PDB sequence, up to an E—value of 1.0. We continued the greedy
algorithm with the HH hits with an E-value cut-off of 10—4. The reason
for applying the HMMER alignments before the HH alignments is dis-
cussed in the ‘Results’ section. For Pfams assigned in this procedure, we
identify an exemplar structure, deﬁned as the structure with the largest
number of match states assigned to residues with Cartesian coordinates in
the PDB entry, with a coverage of the Pfam HMM of at least 80%.
HMM coverage is the number of the sequence residues with coordinates
aligned to a Pfam HMM match state divided by the length of the model.
In the event of a tie, the structure with the best E-value is used.

We divided the HMMER Pfam hits of all six sets into two
non-overlapping sets: {Strong Hits} and {Weak Hits}. Strong hits are
those hits with E-value of 510—5 and <10 residues missing from the N
or C terminal end of the HMM, whereas weak hits comprise the remain-
ing alignments. For each hit in {Weak Hits}, we checked whether there
are exemplar structures for that Pfam and/or other Pfams in the same
clan. If there are, we perform structure alignments with the FATCAT
program (Ye and Godzik, 2003) on the region(s) of the weak hit structure
not previously aligned to the {Strong Hits}. We performed this procedure
separately for HH Pfam hits with E—value of 510—4.

If the FATCAT P-value is better than 10—3, we create an alignment of
the PDB query to the Pfam HMM through the exemplar structure
through a transitive alignment. For residue pairs AB and BC, (A to
B)+ (B to C) =(A to C). Here, A to B is the HMM to exemplar align-
ment, B to C is the structure alignment of the exemplar to the weak
assignment and A to C is HMM to the weak assignment. Once this
alignment is created, we move the alignment from {Weak Hits} to a
new set {Struct Hits}.

2.5 The full algorithm for assigning Pfams to PDB
sequences

The full procedure of creating Pfam assignments to PDB sequences is as
follows. We have in hand six sets of alignments, {HMMER Strong Hits},
{HH Strong Hits}, {HMMER Struct Hits}, {HH Struct Hits},
{HMMER Weak Hits} and {HH Weak Hits}, the last two containing
those weak hits (too short and/or too weak an E-value) for which struc-
ture alignment was not possible or did not produce a signiﬁcant align-
ment. We use the {HMMER Strong Hits} ﬁrst in the greedy algorithm
until no more assignments can be made, and then continue with the
{HH Strong Hits}. Second, we continue the greedy algorithm with the
alignments in the {HMMER Struct Hits} and {HH Struct Hits} sets in
that order until no more assignments can be made. Third, we apply the
greedy algorithm to the remaining {HMMER Weak Hits} and
{HH Weak Hits} with E-value of 510—5 (HMMER) or 510—4 (HH).
These hits have strong statistical signiﬁcance but >10 residues missing
from the N or C terminal end of the HMM. Fourth, we proceed with the
remaining {HMMER Weak Hits} and {HH Weak Hits} up to a value of
1.0, but we only add these if the same Pfam has already been assigned in
one of the earlier steps. Some of these will be combined with earlier
assignments to produce split assignments. Some will be repeated domains.
Pfam B assignments are treated as weak hits and added only if the
E-value is better than the appropriate threshold.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Establishing E-value and P—value cut-offs

We investigated the HMMER3 E-value level at which Pfam as-
signments are likely to be reliable. We created a set of 5134
Pfams with E-values to unique PDB sequences £10-5 and
HMM coverage 290%. The associated PDB for each sequence
was the one with the largest number of match states assigned to
residues with Cartesian coordinates in the PDB entry. We
aligned the PDB sequences against the other 5133 Pfams in the
set with HMMER3 and classiﬁed the resulting alignments and
E-values depending on whether the PDB sequence and the Pfam
belonged to the same clan or different clans, according to Pfam
v. 26. The probability density functions and classiﬁcation func-
tions versus log10(E-value) are shown in Figure la. The classiﬁ-
cation function refers to how likely the Pfam of the query
sequence and the Pfam of the hit HMM belong to the same or
different clan as a function of log10(E-value). A hit has equal
probability of being in the same clan as a different clan when
the E-value is 0.01 (10g10= —2). When the E-value is 10‘s, the
probability that a sequence belongs to the same clan is >95%. In
this article, we deﬁne a Pfam assignment to be a strong assign-
ment when its E-value is 310—5.

The same analysis was performed for the HHsearch align-
ments, using a set of 5387 Pfams with E-value of 310—4.
Figure lb shows the classiﬁcation functions for the HH hits.
When HHsearch’s E-value of 210—4, the probability of being
in the same clan is >95%.

FATCAT provides a P—value for the signiﬁcance of the struc-
tural similarity between two proteins. We ran FATCAT on all
pairs of structures in the set of 5134 PDB structures used for the
evaluation of HMMER. The P—values were also divided into two
classes: same clan and different clan. The probability density and
classiﬁcation functions are shown in Figure 10. When the P—value
is <0.001, the probability that two structures are in the same clan

is >95%. FATCAT suggests a P—value cut-off of 0.05 for two
similar structures with 95% conﬁdence interval. Our cut-off is
more restrictive because we are trying to identify not only similar
structural patterns but also probable homology. In this article,
we use the more strict P—value cut-off of 0.001.

3.2 Comparison of HMMER and HHsearch

To determine the relative utility of HMMER3 and HHsearch for
assigning Pfams to the PDB, we performed alignments of PDB
sequences and UniProt sequences against the Pfam HMMs using
both programs. We ﬁrst calculated PSI-BLAST proﬁles using
one round of search on UniProt90 for all unique protein se-
quences in the PDB. From these proﬁles, we determined consen-
sus sequences using the most common amino acid in each
position (given in the PSI-BLAST proﬁle output in percentage
terms) and the highest PSSM scoring amino acid. The means and
SDs of the sequence identities between PDB and PDB-percent
and PDB-pssm are 65.1 :l: 10.0% and 63.3 :l: 11.2%, respectively.
We ran HMMER3 with the original PDB and UniProt
sequences and their consensus sequences as queries against the
HMMs in Pfam-A. A probability density estimate of the
E-values from the original sequences demonstrated a maximum
in the density at an E-value of 10‘”, whereas the consensus
sequences were shifted to a mode at 10‘”. At a poor E-value
of 10‘s, the original sequences have almost twice as many hits as
the consensus sequences, which have all been shifted to higher
statistical signiﬁcance. A total of 38% of the consensus align-
ments were longer than the original-sequence alignments,
whereas only 10% were shorter. Most of the shorter assignments
occurred when the alignments of the consensus sequences are
broken down into two or more fragments, when the original
PDB sequence alignment was not. These fragments will be
joined in the application of the greedy algorithm.

We applied the greedy algorithm on the alignments to Pfam
from the original PDB and UniProt sequences alone and a set
combining these alignments with those from the consensus PDB
and Uniprot sequences. The set of assignments from the com-
bined consensus and original sequence alignments contains 371
more Pfam-As than the original PDB and UniProt sequences
and increases residue assignments by 4%.

It is often assumed that HMM—HMM alignments should be
better than sequence-HMM alignments; therefore, we compared
the Pfam assignments from the consensus sequences with
HMMER3 (described earlier in the text) and those from
HMM—HMM alignments produced by HHsearch using the gen-
eral greedy algorithm by HMMER3 given these E-value cut-offs.
HHsearch produced assignments to 2% more entries and 2%
more sequences than HMMER3. HHsearch did produce a
much larger number of weak hits, by >65% compared with
HMMER3. This indicates that HHsearch may be most useful
when HMMER3 fails to make any assignment. HHsearch pro-
duced 60% fewer assignments of repeats than HMMER3 did
(1881 versus 5006). HMMER and HHSearch assignments to
the PDB are compared in Table 1.

However, the most signiﬁcant drawback of the HHsearch as-
signments was the tendency to assign more remotely related
Pfams in a Pfam clan compared with the HMMER3 assign-
ments. We compared Pfam assignments from HMMER3 and

aEntities are unique sequences in a PDB entry. So an asymmetric unit that is a
homooligomer of any size has a single protein entity sequence.

HHsearch with 280% overlap on the PDB sequence. A total of
120517 (91.6%) of 131585 domain assignments were with the
same Pfam in the two sources, whereas 10 629 assignments
(8.1%) were to different Pfams within the same clan. Only 439
assignments (0.3%) belonged to different clans. Because
HHsearch is expected to ﬁnd more remote hits than HMMER,
it seems likely that the HMMER assignment is correct, whereas
the HHsearch assigns a more remotely related Pfam. As we want
to make correct assignments at the Pfam level and the clan level,
we prefer the HMMER assignments over the HHsearch assign-
ments, when both are statistically signiﬁcant.

3.3 Structure alignments

Both HMMER3 and HHsearch produce many alignments to
PDB sequences with weak E-values and/or alignments shorter
than the Pfam model deﬁnition. We investigated whether we
could conﬁrm some of the weak hits and extend short alignments
by comparing structures. We deﬁne exemplars as structure/Pfam
pairs with good HMMER E-values (310—5) or HH E-value
(310—4) to the Pfam and HMM coverage of at least 80%. A
total of 81% of Pfams in the PDB have exemplars. The struc-
tures of weak Pfam hits were aligned to the exemplar structures

in the same clan, including the Pfam of the weak hit. A total of
7381 structure assignments were added to our Pfam assignments
by replacing the original alignment to the HMM by a transitive
alignment through the structure alignment. The number of PDB
residues aligned to Pfam HMMs for these sequences rises by
36%. An example is shown in Figure 2.

The ability of structure alignments to verify weak Pfam assign-
ments varies with the statistical signiﬁcance of the Pfam align-
ment. At E-values better than 10‘“), >80% of structure
alignments are statistically signiﬁcant (P-values of <0.001);
these alignments are used solely to extend the Pfam domain as-
signments. At E-values of >001 and <10, about one-third of
assignments are conﬁrmed by structure alignment.

3.4 Pfam architectures for the PDB

Several domain assignments through Pfam and other classiﬁca-
tions are publicly available. In Table 2, these assignments are
compared with our Pfam assignments (‘PDBfam’) computed
with the full procedure described in the ‘Methods’ section. Our
method combines HMMER alignments to PDB and UniProt
sequences and their PSI-BLAST consensus sequences,
HHsearch alignments of HMMs of the PDB and UniProt se-
quences, FATCAT structure alignments for weak and/or short
hits and a greedy algorithm. We provide the number of entries
with at least one domain assignment by each method and the
number of unique sequences with assignments and residues
within unique sequences with assignments. In our Pfam assign-
ments, there are 6379 Pfam-As. Our PDBfam assignments cover
part or all of 98% of unique PDB sequences and 99.4% of all
unique sequences with length >50. Pfam itself provides a ﬁle,
pdbmap, which has domains listed for only 34188 PDB entries.
For these same 34188 entries, we have made 64 832 domain as-
signments, whereas Pfam has only 38 927 assignments. We also
detected about three times as many repeats. The coverage of
PDB sequences from the other well-known data resources are
also given in Table 2. SIFTS covers 87% of PDB sequences by
mapping PDB sequences to UniProt sequences. As not all PDB
sequences in the PDB map to UniProt, SIFTS does not cover a
signiﬁcant portion of the PDB. Pfam assignments from the
RCSB website contain a list of Pfam hits from HMMER3

Fig. 2. Structure alignments verify and expand the Pfam assignments for the PDB entry 2EAB. Left: the initial Pfam assignments from the consensus
sequences. Right: the Pfam assignments to the exemplar 1H54. Middle: the Pfam assignments of 2EAB after structure alignment

based on an E-value cut-off. Many of its assignments overlap
completely in the PDB sequence, usually because they are differ-
ent Pfams from the same clan.

To get a fair assessment of the RCSBs coverage, we used the
same criterion we applied to our data—no >10 residues of over-
lap between Pfam assignments. The structure protein classiﬁca-
tion systems CATH and SCOP have much lower coverages
because they are built manually and updated infrequently. Our
Pfam assignments to the PDB cover a larger percentage of
entries, unique sequences (entities) and residues than other avail-
able assignments. Perhaps more important than the number of
entries or sequences with at least one assignment is the number of
domain assignments made. Each assignment may lead to the
identiﬁcation of new interactions of known structure available
in the PDB. The RCSB makes 68 767 domain assignments after
removing overlapping assignments. In PDBfam, we have 79 201
domain assignments to unique sequences in the PDB, for an
increase of 15%.

3.5 Split Pfam architecture assignments

One feature of structures that we have accounted for in our Pfam
assignments is the presence of large insertions, relative to the
multiple sequence alignments that deﬁne the Pfam models.
Such insertions often result in separate alignments from
HMMER3 or HHsearch covering different parts of the PDB
sequence and different parts of the Pfam HMM. These are not
accounted for on the Pfam website, where they are often listed
as distinct architectures containing two copies of the Pfam
(e.g., “IMPDH x 2”) rather than one that is split by an insertion.
In our current dataset, we have 5023 split domains (1.9% of the
total) of which 966 domains are multichain domains.

Our split assignments come in a number of forms because of
the ways that domains can be inserted or split up in the PDB
sequences. Table 3 displays the different formats of split domains
in our assignments, where X and Y are two Pfam IDs. The
format of the chain Pfam architecture for proteins with an
inserted domain is given on Line 1 as Domain] [ Start-End]_
D0main2_D0mainI[Start-End], where Domain] is a split
domain and Start and End are positions within the HMM.
Line 2 shows the format when there is a long insertion that is

not assigned to a Pfam. Line 3 represents those structures where
two portions of the HMM are in reverse order in the PDB struc-
tures. Line 4 of the table denotes those structures where a Pfam is
split between two different chain sequences in the structure (e.g.
in this case, entity_id 2 and 3 in the PDB XML ﬁle).

3.6 Unassigned sequences and regions

There are 2043 unique sequences (from 4405 sequences including
redundancy) that can not be assigned to any Pfam by our pro-
cedure. A total of 945 of these unique sequences (46%) have
weak Pfam assignments—HMMER E-value of >10_5 or
HHsearch E-value of >10_4 and no structure alignment with
FATCAT P—value of <10_3 up to E-values of 10. The remaining
1098 sequences (54%) are short peptides with length 321, of
which 263 sequences are part of UniProt sequences, but not
covered by Pfam strong hits. We investigated the properties of
the 18% of the ~13 million residues in unique protein sequences
in the PDB that are not assigned to any Pfam by our method.
Figure 3 shows the histograms of the lengths of unassigned re-
gions [either N or C terminal regions (Fig. 3a) or internal regions
(Fig. 3b) and completely unassigned sequences (Fig. 30)]. More
than 90% of unassigned regions/entities are short peptides with
length <50. Figure 4 shows the secondary structures for the un-
assigned regions. The last bar in each ﬁgure is for proteins and
protein regions with Pfam assignments. The percentage of N and
C terminal unassigned regions that is disordered is more than
that for Pfam-assigned regions (10%). The secondary structures
of the internal unassigned residues are closer to that of Pfam
assignments but still have a higher proportion of coil and/or
disordered residues. For completely unassigned sequences, the
percentages of residues in coil or disordered are somewhat
higher for shorter sequences than for Pfam assignments, espe-
cially in the amount of disorder.

3.7 PFAM interactions

Pfam assignments have been used previously to catalogue the
physical interaction of different domain families within the
PDB (Finn et al., 2005; Stein et al., 2011). With a larger and
more accurate set of assignments, we have investigated the
number of such interactions that are now present in the PDB.

Less than 50% of the asymmetric units of crystal structures
correspond with the PDBs annotated ‘biological assemblies’
(Xu et al., 2006) that either come from the authors of each struc-
ture or are assigned using the PISA software (Krissinel and
Henrick, 2007). Although these biological assemblies are not
100% accurate (Xu et al., 2008), they provide a better dataset
to tally the number of Pfam interactions than the asymmetric
units. For example, an asymmetric unit for a structure may be a
monomer, whereas its biological assembly is a dimer. Such an
interaction would be missed if only the asymmetric unit is con-
sidered. The converse may also be true—an asymmetric unit may
consist of multiple chains, whereas the biological assembly is a
monomer. An incorrect interaction is counted in this case.

The numbers of interchain and intrachain interactions of
Pfams are given in Table 4. An interaction is deﬁned if there

are at least ﬁve pairs of residues with any atomic distance <5 A
or at least 10 pairs of residues with CB/Coc distance <12 A and at
least one atomic distance <5 A. The column ‘PDBfam (all BA)’
gives our results for the biological assemblies in the entire current
PDB. For instance, there are 3499 Pfams involved in homodimeric
interactions between chains (or as heterodimers of two proteins
containing the same Pfam domains). There are 3958 pairs of
Pfams in physical interactions across two protein chains. If we
consider interchain and intrachain relationships together, there
are 3576 same-pfam interactions, and 6132 Pfam pair interactions
involving 3982 Pfams.

The 3DID database also uses Pfam to determine the preva-
lence of domain interactions in the PDB (Stein et al., 2011). We
parsed the 3DID Pfam interactions directly from the text ﬁle
(3did_ﬁat_Apr_3_201l.dat) available from 3DID. This ﬁle

contains Pfam interactions for 35449 entries. 3DID contains
interactions present in asymmetric units and does not utilize
the biological assemblies of the PDB. Table 4 compares our re-
sults with theirs. To accomplish this, we calculated the number of
Pfam interactions in the same set of 35 449 PDB entries in both
the asymmetric units [PDBfam(ASU)] and in the biological
assemblies [PDBfam(BA)]. The 3DID results are given in
the last column [3DID(ASU)]. Because we have more Pfam
assignments for these entries, we have more Pfam interactions
in the asymmetric units. However, when using the biological
assemblies, the number of interchain Pfam interactions
(both same-pfam and diff-pfam) are reduced from those of
the ASU.

The interactions in biological assemblies provide more accur-
ate estimates of our structural knowledge of how proteins inter-
act with each other, and how this information might be used to
investigate protein—protein interaction networks (Aragues et al.,

2005). In Table 5, we show the Pfams that interact with :30
other Pfams within the PDB. Several of these are domains that
typically bind short peptides from other proteins, including
MHC I, Pkinase, WD40 and eﬁ1and domains. Many are also
repeat modules that serve as protein—protein interaction
scaffolds.

4 DISCUSSION

One potential use for the assignments in PDBfam is in programs
that perform searches of the PDB with a query sequence or
structure and return lists of structures that contain similarities
to the query above some threshold. Examples include fold rec-
ognition servers, such as FFAS (Jaroszewski et al., 2005), and
structure similarity search servers, such as FATCAT. Often the
list of hits returned consists solely of the PDB entry and chain,
residue numbers and sequence or structure alignments. It is,
therefore, difﬁcult to know whether the hits are related to each
other or whether they share any functional relationship with the
query. SCOP and CATH designations are sometimes provided,
which solves the ﬁrst problem, but SCOP and CATH represent
less than two-thirds of the PDB, and their utility for this purpose
is, therefore, limited. We believe that our Pfam domain assign-
ments and associated clan information may be used to provide
both relationships among the hits (shared Pfams or clans) and
functional information of the hits (e.g. Pkinase).

Protein domain classiﬁcation is also useful in the analysis of
the interactions of protein domains with each other. Our
ProtCID server provides information on clusters of similar inter-
faces between homologous proteins or protein pairs in multiple
crystal forms in the PDB (Xu and Dunbrack, 2011). Assignments
that are as accurate and complete as possible allow for better
identiﬁcation of biologically relevant interfaces in multiple crys-
tal forms. Each Pfam in the PDB has a webpage in ProtCID
listing all PDB entries that contain that Pfam, the chain archi-
tecture of the protein containing the Pfam, and the chain archi-
tectures of any other protein sequences in the same entry. Thus,
looking up a Pfam in ProtCID provides information on other
domains that the Pfam may interact with, either within the same
chain or in protein complexes.

anams includes same Pfam—Pfam interactions within and between chains. All inter-
actions are involved in annotated biological assemblies in the PDB.

Our assignments using Pfam have some limitations. We have
deﬁned a pipeline using a combination of available methods that
is relatively efﬁcient and can be applied automatically on a regu-
lar basis. It is possible that different choices might increase the
representation slightly (e.g. different ways of deﬁning the con-
sensus sequences or the use of several structure alignment pro-
grams). But the coverage is high as it is, and exploring further
avenues is likely to be a case of rapidly dwindling returns.

Pfam does not have models for some kinds of proteins. For
instance, about half of the entities >250 amino acids that do not
have Pfam assignments in our results are virus proteins, espe-
cially virus capsids. Pfam is organized into clans, and these may
in most cases be useful for inferring structural relationships at the
superfamily level. But many clans have HMMs of very different
lengths; therefore, the structural domains are not likely to be
completely consistent across clans. Also, it is likely the case
that some superfamily relationships evident in SCOP and
CATH are missed by the Pfam clans. We cannot make assign-
ments to many peptides, either because the parent UniProt se-
quence is not known or does not exist or because the peptide
belongs to the region of a protein that is not within a Pfam
domain. It is likely that intrinsically disordered protein regions
have less coverage in Pfam than folded domains, and many pep-
tides bound to proteins come from these regions. Nevertheless,
our assignments cover 99.4% of unique sequences in the PDB
>50 amino acids. We believe they will be useful in numerous
applications in structural bioinformatics and structure
prediction.

Finally, the procedure we have outlined for PDBfam is sufﬁ-
ciently general that it may be used to make assignments of other
domain classiﬁcation systems to any set of target sequences.
Because of the power of HMMs to represent proﬁle families,
such a classiﬁcation of domains should be represented as a set

of HMMs. With the program HHblits, this is straightforward to
do even if the classiﬁcation system is based on a small number of
sequences. Further, structural information also signiﬁcantly im-
proves the results. If the target sequences are not of known struc-
ture, then they may be assigned to known folds through the
sequence search methods used here. This should be done at strin-
gent levels of statistical signiﬁcance so as not to add another
layer of uncertainty to the assignment process. If the domain
classiﬁcation system is structure based, then the other side of
the equation is already satisﬁed. We can imagine a number of
further applications that will be presented later, including Pfam
assignments to human proteins and assignment of SCOP do-
mains to the entire PDB on an ongoing basis.

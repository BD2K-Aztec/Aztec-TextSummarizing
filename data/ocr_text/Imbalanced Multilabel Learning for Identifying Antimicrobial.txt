Abstract

Motivation: With the rapid increase of infection resistance to antibiotics, it is urgent to find novel in-
fection therapeutics. In recent years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been utilized as potential
alternatives for infection therapeutics. AMPs are key components of the innate immune system and
can protect the host from various pathogenic bacteria. Identifying AMPs and their functional types has
led to many studies, and various predictors using machine learning have been developed. However,
there is room for improvement; in particular, no predictor takes into account the lack of balance
among different functional AMPS.

Results: In this paper, a new synthetic minority over-sampling technique on imbalanced and multi-
Iabel data sets, referred to as ML—SMOTE, was designed for processing and identifying AMPs’ func-
tional families. A novel multi-Iabel classifier, MLAMP, was also developed using ML—SMOTE and grey
pseudo amino acid composition. The classifier obtained 0.4846 subset accuracy and 0.16 hamming

loss.

1 Introduction

With rapid increase in the infection resistance of antibiotics, it is urgent
to ﬁnd novel infection therapeutics. Over the past decade antimicrobial
peptides (AMPS) have been utilized as potential alternatives for ﬁghting
infectious diseases. AMPS are key components of the innate immune
system and can protect the host from various pathogenic bacteria. In
invertebrates and vertebrates, AMPS have dual roles: rapid microbial
killing and subsequent immune modulation (Wang, 2014). These effects
result ﬁom AMP inducing multiple damages in bacteria by disrupting
bacteria membranes (Malmsten, 2014), by inhibiting proteins, DNA and
RNA synthesis, or by interacting with certain intracellular targets (Bahar
and Ron, 2013). Therefore, AMPS were developed increasingly for new
drugs. Some examples of using AMPS in therapeutics have been report-
ed. Popovic et al. found that peptides with antimicrobial and anti-
inﬂammatory activities had therapeutic potential for treatment of acne

vulgariS (Popovic, et al., 2012). Yancheva et a1. synthesized a novel
didepsipeptide with antimicrobial activity against four of ﬁve tested
bacterial strains of Escherichia coli Hancheva, et al., 2012). Conlon et
al. demonstrated that peptides with antimicrobial activity from ﬁog Skin
could stimulate insulin release, and hence had potential aS an incretin-
based therapy for Type 2 diabetes mellituS (Conlon, et al., 2014). In
addition, AMPS have been used aS anticancer peptides in cancer therapy
(Gaspar, et al., 2013).

A surge in research on AMPS haS promoted the development of vari-
ouS databases and prediction toolS. APD2 Wang, et al., 2009) iS a syS-
tem dedicated to establishing a glossary, nomenclature, classiﬁcation,
information search, prediction, design, and statistics of AMPS. It gath-
ered 2,544 AMPS ﬁom the literature. CAMP (Thomas, et al., 2010;
Waghu, et al., 2013) holdS 6,756 antimicrobial sequences and 682 3D
structures of AMPS, together with prediction and sequence analySiS
toolS. Niarchou et a1. (Niarchou, et al., 2013) tested all subsequences
ranging from 5 to 100 amino acids of the plant proteins in

UniProKB/SwiSS-prot and constructed an AMP database for plant Spe-
cieS, named C-PAmP. Zhao et a1. developed LAMP, a database used to
aid the discovery and design of AMPS aS new antimicrobial agents. The
database contains 3,904 natural AMPS and 1,643 synthetic peptides
(Zhao, et al., 2013). DBAASP was a manually curated database built by
Gogoladze et al., and it collected those peptides for which antimicrobial
activities against particular targets have been evaluated experimentally
(Gogoladze, et al., 2014).

Generally, AMPS are Short peptides with 10—50 amino acids
(Malmsten, 2014) and have very low sequence homology to one another.
So it iS challenging to identify AMPS and itS activities by automatic
tools. Researchers made considerable efforts in this regard. In these
studies, the support vector machine (SVM) was usually used as predic-
tion engine (Joseph, et al., 2012; Khosravian, et al., 2013; Lata, et al.,
2010; Niarchou, et al., 2013). Besides, nearest neighbor Wang, et al.,
2011) or k-nearest neighbor algorithm Oﬁao, et al., 2013), random for-
estS (RF S) (Joseph, et al., 2012), decision tree model (Lira, et al., 2013),
and hidden Markov models (HMMS) (Fjell, et al., 2007) were also ap-
plied aS claSSiﬁerS. Some predictors were only used to identify whether
novel peptides are AMPS (Khosravian, et al., 2013; Lata, et al., 2007;
ViShnepolSky and PirtSkhalava, 2014; Wang, et al., 2011). In addition to
these Simple binary claSSiﬁerS, there were some multi-claSS claSSiﬁerS.
Lira et a1. (Lira, et al., 2013) created a decision tree model to classify the
antimicrobial activities of synthetic peptides into four classes: none, low,
medium, and high. Joseph developed ClaSSAMP to predict the propensi-
ty of a peptide sequence to have antibacterial, antiﬁmgal, or antiviral
activity (Joseph, et al., 2012). KhamiS et al., studied 14 AMP families
and sub-families. They selected a Speciﬁc description of AMP amino
acid sequence, and identiﬁed compositional and physicochemical proper-
tieS of amino acids to distinguish each AMP family (KhamiS, et al.,
2015). Furthermore, Xiao et al. proposed a two-level multi-label claSSiﬁ-
er, iAMP-2L, which identiﬁes not only whether a peptide iS an AMP, but
also itS ﬁinctional activities (Xiao, et al., 2013).

Although these methods have their own advantages and did play an
important role in the research, they have following problems. Firstly,
most models only identiﬁed whether a new sequence iS AMP, but not itS
type. Secondly, it iS hard to search Short peptides in the database because
AMPS usually have only 5—50 amino acids. Methods based on Blast
search and gene ontology (Lin, et al., 2013) are often ineffective. Last
but not least, classifying AMPS’ ﬁmctionS iS a multi-label classiﬁcation
(MLC), especially when the number of AMPS with different activities
does not distribute evenly. From APD2 (Wang, et al., 2009), it iS seen
that antibacterial peptides occupy more than 90% of all AMPS, which iS
a highly unbalanced MLC. None of aforementioned automatic models
considered the unbalanced amounts among various activities.

In the past two decades, the topic of learning from multi-label data
setS (MLDS) haS drawn Signiﬁcant attention from researchers. Moreover,
MLC methods are increasingly applied in various ﬁelds, such aS seman-
tic annotation of images (Zhang and Zhou, 2007), categorization (Liu
and Chen, 2015), and bioinformatics (Cheng, et al., 2014; Chou, 2015;
Chou and Shen, 2007 ; Chou and Shen, 2008; Chou, et al., 2011; Chou, et
al., 2012; SadaSivam and Duraiswamy, 2015; Shen and Chou, 2007;
Shen and Chou, 2009; Shen and Chou, 2010; Shen and Chou, 2010; Wu,
et al., 2012; Yu, et al., 2013). The existing MLC methods can be
grouped into two categories: (1) problem transformation methods, which
transform MLC either into one or more Single-label classiﬁcation or
regression problem, and (2) algorithm adaptation methods, which extend
Speciﬁc learning algorithms in order to handle MLDS directly
(TsoumakaS, et al., 2010). Numerous MLC algorithms were proposed,
such aS AdaboostMH and Adaboost.MR (Schapire and Singer, 2000),

ML-KNN (Zhang and Zhou, 2007), ClaSSiﬁer chains (Read, et al., 2009;
Read, et al., 2011), and Multi-label Naive Bayes (Zhang, et al., 2009).

MLC often haS serious issues of unbalanced data setS, in which the
numbers of samples from minority classes are substantially fewer than
from majority classes. For example, in subcellular localization prediction
(Lin, et al., 2013), the number of the cytoplasm proteins iS 44 times the
number of the melanosome proteins. A Similar Situation occurs in many
studies (Liu and Chen, 2015; Wan, et al., 2012; Wu, et al., 2011; Xiao, et
al., 2011). Standard machine learning algorithms often cannot achieve
ideal performance when trained on unbalanced data set. One approach to
address this issue iS to adapt existing classiﬁer learning algorithms to
strengthen learning with regard to the minority classO(u, et al., 2013).
Another approach iS to artiﬁcially sample the claSS distribution (Dong
and Wang, 2011; Luengo, et al., 2011; Tahir, et al., 2012). Combining
both approaches can also achieve strong claSSiﬁerS (Zhang, et al., 2012).
Unquestionably, the sampling approach continues to be popular (Chawla,
2010). Various over- and under-sampling methods have been proposed
(Bunkhumpompat, et al., 2009; Chawla, 2010; Chawla, et al., 2002;
Chawla, et al., 2003; Dong and Wang, 2011; Gao, et al., 2011; Gao, et
al., 2011; Luengo, et al., 2011; Seiffert, et al., 2008; Zhang, et al., 2012).
Among them, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchinque)
(Chawla, 2010; Chawla, et al., 2002) iS a state-of-art over-sampling
methods. Chawla (Chawla, 2010) argued that SMOTE creates effective
regions for learning the minority claSS rather than being subsumed by the
majority claSS samples around them. In bioinformatics, some studies
have applied SMOTE to balance the skewing benchmark datasetS (Jia, et
al., 2016; Jia, et al., 2016; Liu, et al., 2015; Xiao, et al., 2015). In addi-
tion, Similar approaches have been recently introduced to handle the
unbalanced datasetS, such aS Monte Carlo sampling (Jia, et al., 2016) and
ﬁlSion ensemble approach (Liu, et al., 2016; Qiu, et al., 2016).

Although the aforementioned methods have some succeSS in address-
ing unbalanced data sets, they have not achieved a satisfactory result in
processing multi-labeled and imbalanced datasetS Simultaneously. Few
works address the imbalance problem in MLC. He et a1. (He, et al.,
2012) took into account the imbalance in predicting subcellular localiza-
tion of human proteins. Charte et a1. (Charte, et al., 2015) built an under-
sampling and oversampling algorithm on MLDS. Those studies improved
the multi-label classiﬁcation performance; however, they have some
drawbacks in how to addreSS the multi-label character of the new syn-
thetic instance. In this paper, we tackle the imbalanced problem by a
novel oversampling model referred to aS ML-SMOTE, which iS a syn-
thetic minority oversampling on MLDS. We developed a new tool aS a
two-level AMP predictor based on ML-SMOTE. For a peptides se-
quence, we ﬁrst identify whether it iS an AMP. If yeS, we then predict
what potential activities it haS. The ﬁrst-level iS a binary predictor, and
the second-level predictor iS an unbalanced and multi-labeled multi-
classeS predictor. The result Shows ML-SMOTE can adjust the label set
distribution to improve the performance of the predictor.

2 Methods

2.1 Benchmark Dataset

The benchmark data set SBemh used in this study was taken from Xiao et
a1. Oﬁao, et al., 2013). The data set can be formulated aS

SBench = §+ U S— (1)

where 8+ contains 879 AMPS, and 8‘ contains 2,405 non-AMPS. The
879 AMPS are formulated aS

SJ“ = U15=1 Si (2)

where Si contains 770 antibacterial peptides, 82 140 anti-cancer/tumor
peptides, S3 366 antifungal peptides, S4 84 anti-HIV peptides, and SS
124 antiviral peptides.

2.2 Sequence Encoding Scheme

To develop a powerﬁil method for classifying AMPS and their ﬁmctional
families according to the sequence information, one of the keyS iS to
formulate the peptides with an effective mathematical expression that
can truly reﬂect the intrinsic correlation with the target to be identiﬁed.
However, when comparing with other protein ﬁmctional predictions, the
challenge iS identifying how AMPS deal with Shorter peptides. For a
peptides sample P of L amino acids

P = R1R2R3  

where Rt (1 S i S L) represents the i-th residue, L iS usually between 5
and 50.

In this study, we formulated an amino acids sequence by using Chou’S
PseAAC(Chou, 2005; Chou, 2001) with the grey model (GM) (Deng,
1989). According to Chou’S general PseAAC formula (Chou, 2009;
Chou, 2011), the peptides P in Eq. 3 can be represented aS

pk  I3an (4)

where T iS a transpose operator, while the subscript Q iS an integer and
itS value aS well aS the components p1, p2,  depend on how to extract
the desired information from the amino acid sequence of P.

In our study, we use the GM(1,1) model, which iS an important and
generally used model in GM. GM(1,1) ﬁrstly converts a series without
any obvious regularity into a strict monotonic increasing series by using
the accumulative generation operation (AGO). ThiS proceSS can reduce
the randomness and enhance the smoothness of the series and minimize
any interference from the random information. Let uS assume that

x<°> = (x<°>(1),x<°>(2), ...,x<°>(n)) (5)

P = [131 p2 

iS a non-negative original series of real numbers with an irregular distri-
bution. Then

X“) = (x<1>(1),x<1>(2), ...,x<1>(n)) (6)

iS viewed aS the ﬁrst-order accumulative generation operation (1-AGO)
series for Xw) , and the components in X“) are given by

x<1>(k) = 23,960) (i), k = 1,2, (7)

The GM(1,1) model can be expressed by the following grey differen-
tial equation with one variable:

ﬂ“) (1) _
dt + aX — b (8)
where a and b are elements of parameters vector (i , that iS
a = [6% blT (9)

In Eq. 8, —a iS the developing coefﬁcient and b the inﬂuence coefﬁ-
cient. They can be solved using a least square estimator.

a = [a, b]T = [BTB]‘1BTY (10)

where

—o.5(x<1>(1) + 269(2)) 1

B = —0.5(x(1)(2.) + x<1>(3))  (11)
—0.5(x(1)(n  1) + xm (11)) 1
x<°>(2)
y = We) (12)
(mm)

The coefﬁcients —a and b Should carry some intrinsic information
contained in the discrete data sequence Xw) sampled from the system
investigated. In View of this, we incorporate these coefﬁcients into the
general form of PseAAC (Eq. 4) to reﬂect the correlation between the
peptide sequence and prediction labels. In order to translate an amino
acid sequence expressed with alphabets in Eq. 3 into a non-negative real
series in Eq. 5, we need the amino acid numerical codes. In the same
manner aS that Shown in Oﬁao, et al., 2013), we also use the numerical
value of the following ﬁve physical-chemical properties for each of the
20 amino acids: (1) hydrophobicity; (2) pk1 (Ca — COOH); (3) pk2
(NH3); (4) PI (25 0C); and (5) molecular weight. Finally, we used a 30-
D features vector to represent a peptide; i.e., instead of Eq. 4, we now
have

P = [131: P2:  : P20: p21:  p3olT (13)

where p,- (1 S i S 20) are the frequencies of 20 amino acids; and p21
and p22 are the coefﬁcients of Eq. 10 when amino acids are coded by
hydrophobicity numerical values; p23 and p24 are the coefﬁcients of Eq.
10 when amino acids are coded by pk1 numerical values, and SO on.

2.3 ML-SMOTE algorithm

In Eq. 2, the AMP ﬁinction family data set iS an unbalanced MLD, in
which the antibacterial peptides have nine times the amount of the anti-
HIV peptides. How to handle the MLC in unbalanced MLD iS essential
for improving prediction performance.

Let X C Rm denote an m-dimenSionS real vector of instance and let

Y = (11,12, ...,lq} (14)
be a claSS label set. MLD can be represented aS
D={(XJ)| xEXJ'EY} (15)
We deﬁne the sample set with the j-th (1 S j S q) label as
D“) = {(xwmwﬂ (MW) e D and 11- 6 W“) (16)

If “DJ-1” >> “DJ-2”, the claSS ljl iS a majority claSS and the claSS ljz iS a
minority claSS.

Different ﬁom SMOTE (Chawla, et al., 2002) in a Single label data
set, the new synthetic instance maybe have one or more labels. Hence, in
(Charte, et al., 2015), Charte et al. compared random undersampling
(RUS) and random oversampling (ROS) based on Label Power-set (LP)
and Multi-Label (ML), respectively. However, their LP-RUS and LP-
ROS methods can only work well when the label density iS low. Moreo-
ver, because their ML-ROS just clones the minority claSS samples, it iS
ineffective when these samples Simultaneously have the majority claSS
label, which happens often in MLD. In thiS study, we propose a novel
oversampling model named ML-SMOTE. In the following algorithm

3 Results

After the sequence feature retrieval and ML-SMOTE preproceSSing aS
described above, a two-level AMP predictor named MLAMP was con-
structed, in which the Ensemble of ClaSSiﬁer Chains (ECC) algorithm
Waghu, et al., 2014) was adopted aS the prediction method (Fig. 1). We
used the canonical implementation of ECC provided by the MULAN
(TsoumakaS, et al., 2010; Wen, et al., 2016) multi-label learning in the

Weka micholls, et al., 2016) library And for ECC, the binary and multi-
claSS learners are implemented on the Weka platform using the Random
Forest (RF) algorithm (Breiman, 2001).

dataset 5+ for training the 2nd-level predictor.

MLAMP iS a two-level prediction engine (See Fig.1). The ﬁrst level of
MLAMP predicts a query peptide aS AMP or non-AMP by using the RF
algorithm. It belongs to the case of Single-label classiﬁcation. The fol-
lowing four measures were used for examining the performance of a
Single-label predictor, they are: (1) overall accuracy or Acc; (2)
Mathew’S correlation coefﬁcient or MCC; (3) sensitivity or Sn; and (4)
Speciﬁcity or Sp.

where TP represents the true positive; TN, the true negative; FP, the false
positive; FN, the false negative.

Although Eq. 20 was often used in the literature to measure the pre-
diction quality of a method, they often lack intuitiveneSS, especially to
biologists, particularly the MCC. According to Chou’S formulation, these
four measures can be expressed aS (Chen, et al., 2016; Lin, et al., 2014)

where N+ stands for the total number of AMP samples investigated,
whereas N: for the number of AMP samples incorrectly predicted to be

of non-AMP; N‘ for the total number of non-AMP samples investigated,
whereas N; for the number of non-AMP samples incorrectly predicted to
be of AMP. With such a formulation aS given in Eq. 21, the meanings of
sensitivity, Speciﬁcity, overall accuracy, and Mathew’S correlation coef-
ﬁcient and their scopes would become more intuitive and easier-to-
understand, particularly for the Mathew’S correlation coefﬁcient, aS
concurred by a series of studies published very recently (Jia, et al., 2016;
Jia, et al., 2016; Jia, et al., 2016; Lin, et al., 2014; Liu, et al., 2016; Liu,
et al., 2016; Liu, et al., 2016; Qiu, et al., 2016; Xiao, et al., 2016)

If a query peptide iS predicted aS AMP, the second level of MLAMP
will start to claSSify itS ﬁmctional families. ThiS proceSS belongs to the
case of multi-label classiﬁcation. Hamming loss, Subset Accuracy, Ac-
curacy, Precision and Recall are the mostly used evaluation metrics for
the performance of a multi-label classiﬁer (Lin, et al., 2013; TsoumakaS,
et al., 2010; TsoumakaS and katakiS, 2007; Xiao, et al., 2013). Suppose
ILk iS the subset that contains all the labels for the kth sample Pk; IL?( is
the subset that contains all the predicted labels for the kth sample Pk; N iS
the total number of samples; and M iS the total number of labels. In thiS
study, N=879 and M=5. The ﬁve metrics have been clearly deﬁned aS
follows (Chou, 2013):

where || II is the operator acting on the set therein to count the number of
itS elements, and

if all the labels in ILk are
A(I[.k, 11.2) = { ’ indentical to those in IL}; (23)
0, otherwise

When assessing a predictor, the following three cross-validation
methods are often used in the literature: independent data set test, sub-
sampling (K-fold cross-validation) test, and jackknife test. However, aS
elaborated in (Chou and Zhang, 1995), among the three cross-validation
methods, the jackknife test iS deemed the least arbitrary and most objec-
tive because it can always yield a unique result for a given benchmark
data set. Hence, the jackknife test was adopted in this study to examine
the anticipated succeSS rates of the current predictor. The proceSS of
jackknife test can be explained aS follows:

Input: multi-label dataset T={Pi | 1S i SN}.

Output: predicted label set.

For i: 09N

T iS divided into testing dataset Ts= {Pi},
and training dataset Tr=T-TS.
Generate new training dataset Tr’ by using ML-SOMTE on Tr.
Train model on Tr’ by using ECC algorithm.
Predict the label set of Pi by the model trained above.

Table 1 compares the performance of MLAMP with an existing meth-
od iAMP-2L in the ﬁrst-level result on the benchmark 839"“ (Eq. 1),
where overall accuracy Ace and MCC achieved by MLAMP are higher
than those achieved by iAMP-2L.

To ﬁirther demonstrate the power of the MLAMP predictor, we com-
pared it with other claSSical predictors on an independent dataset SIM

containing 920 AMPS and 920 non-AMPS. ThiS comparison was used for
independent testing in (Thomas, et al., 2010; Xiao, et al., 2013). The
results listed in Table 2 were obtained by MLAMP, iAMP-2L Oﬁao, et
al., 2013) and CAMP (Thomas, et al., 2010) on SIM. AS Shown in Table
2, the performances achieved by MLAMP iS remarkably higher than the
performances reported by iAMP-2L Oﬁao, et al., 2013) and CAMP
(Thomas, et al., 2010) in all metrics (Sn, Sp, Ace and MCC).

Furthermore, in the second level prediction, MLAMP also obtained
better performance than iAMP-2L. Some different metrics were used
from Single-label classiﬁcation, in particular- Hamming loss, Accuracy,
Precision, Recall and Subset Accuracy (TsoumakaS, et al., 2010) were
commonly applied in MLC. Table 3 gives the detailed jackknife test
results on the AMP dataset 8+ (Eq. 2). Especially MLAMP gained a
0.4846 succeSS rate in the strict assessment of subset accuracy and this
performance was 5% higher than that by iAMP-2L.

Why can these metrics be improved SO remarkably by using
MLAMP? There are two key reasons. The ﬁrst reason iS probably the
new peptide feature coding model (see Eq. 13). Table 4 sorts the 30
features in decreasing order after analyzing the benchmark data set
839"“ by the feature selection tool minimal-redundancy—maximal-
relevance (mRMR) (Kolde, et al., 2016). AS Shown in Table 4, those
features generated by the grey model include more information than
amino acids frequency, especially their biochemical properties. And one
can draw a conclusion that some physicochemical properties of amino

acids may play an important role in AMP, such aS molecular weight, PI
and Pk2. The second reason points to the new ML-SMOTE model. The
AMP dataset 8+ iS an imbalance MLD, and previous studies did not take
it into account. After processing the training dataset 8+ by the ML-
SMOTE model, the balance property of the new synthetic training data
set was improved, which can help the machine learning obtained a better
performance.

4 Conclusion

Due to increasing antibiotic resistance, AMPS, which are key compo-
nents of innate immune system, are becoming more and more important
in drug development. Efﬁciently and effectively identifying AMPS and
their ﬁinctional types haS become an urgent research topic. The results
reported in this study indicate that the novel predictor, MLAMP, pro-
vides an accurate and useﬁil tool for researchers to ﬁnd new infection
therapeutics.

MLAMP obtained a better prediction performance than that of a pre-
vious method. The primary reason for our good performance iS our for-
mulation model’s peptide extraction features. Since AMPS usually have
5—50 amino acids, our model (Eq.13) iS good for formulating Short pep-
tides. It includes the internal relationship of amino acids sequence in
various physical-chemical properties. The second reason iS the ML-
SMOTE model, which does a good job of handling the lack of balance
problem in multi-label data sets. Compared with other methods, the
sample synthetized by using ML-SMOTE retains the multi label distribu-
tions. It not only accumulates minority samples but also keeps the label
density of MLD. In the ﬁiture, the MLSMOTE model can be extended to
aSSist with imbalance and multi-label data setS for other problems.

For practical applications, a user-ﬁiendly web-server for MLAMP has
been established at http://www.ici-bioinfo.cn/1V1LA1V1P, which allows
users to easily obtain their desired results without the need to follow the
complicated mathematical equations involved in developing the predic-
tor. Users can submit a peptide sequence to the webserver and subse-
quently the webserver will return the predicted result in real time. Alter-
natively, users can choose the batch prediction by entering their e-mail
address and their batch input ﬁle of many peptide sequences. They will
quickly receive an email Showing the predicted results from seconds to
hours depending on the number of sequences.

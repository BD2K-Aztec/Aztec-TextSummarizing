Abstract

Motivation: In practice, identifying and interpreting the functional impacts of the regulatory rela—
tionships between micro—RNA and messenger—RNA is non—trivial. The sheer scale of possible
micro—RNA and messenger—RNA interactions can make the interpretation of results difficult.
Results: We propose a supervised framework, pMim, built upon concepts of significance combin—
ation, for jointly ranking regulatory micro—RNA and their potential functional impacts with respect
to a condition of interest. Here, pMim directly tests if a micro—RNA is differentially expressed and if
its predicted targets, which lie in a common biological pathway, have changed in the opposite
direction. We leverage the information within existing micro—RNA target and pathway databases to
stabilize the estimation and annotation of micro—RNA regulation making our approach suitable for
datasets with small sample sizes. In addition to outputting meaningful and interpretable results, we
demonstrate in a variety of datasets that the micro—RNA identified by pMim, in comparison to sim—
pler existing approaches, are also more concordant with what is described in the literature.
Availability and implementation: This framework is implemented as an R function, pMim, in the
package sdeeq available from http://wva.el|ispatrick.com/r—packages.

1 Introduction

 

Micro-RNA (miRNA) are a class of small non-coding RNA mol-
ecules which down—regulate gene expression. Through basepairing,
miRNA down—regulate the expression of genes by inhibiting
their translation or promoting the degradation of their target mes—
senger-RNA (mRNA). Dysregulation of miRNA can lead to a
variety of human diseases with miRNA being shown to play a crit—
ical regulatory role in many cellular pathways and functions such as
developmental timing, cell death, cell proliferation, immunity and

patterning of the nervous system (Mo, 2012). As such, investigating
the functional impacts of miRNA may further the understanding of
many diseases.

One of the first steps to understand how a miRNA could regulate
a biological process is predicting which mRNA can directly interact
with a miRNA. Irrespective of a particular dataset or condition,
there eXist many computational algorithms for predicting the target
genes of miRNA, such as TargetScan (Lewis et 61]., 2005), miRBase
(Griffiths—Jones et 61]., 2008) and PicTar (Krek et 61]., 2005).

These algorithms essentially attempt to identify whether a mRNA
contains the binding motif of a miRNA. This remains an active area
of research as there is generally not a large consensus between algo—
rithms (Jayaswal et 61]., 2009).

Attempting to identify a miRNA that is regulating a set of genes
in response to a particular condition or treatment is also an estab—
lished problem. A simple approach for identifying candidate
miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships is to identify a differentially
expressed (DE) miRNA and look for large negative pair—wise correl—
ations between that miRNA and the genes that it is predicted to
bind to (Havelange et 61]., 2011; Li et 61]., 2011) Another common
approach is to identify a DE miRNA and then use predicted binding
target information to perform an enrichment analysis on the DE
genes or miRNA-mRNA correlations (Nam et 61]., 2009; Xu and
Wong, 2013). An important but often overlooked factor to both of
these approaches is the combination of the significance from the test
on the miRNA with the test on its targets. Not combining these tests
may produce results that are overly conservative as two p—value cut—
offs are performed instead of one (Yang et 61]., 2014). This could re—
sult in biologically significant signal being missed.

As miRNA can potentially target hundreds or even thousands of
genes, if a miRNA and its targets are identified as DE then further
pathway enrichment analysis is often performed to make any results
biologically interpretable. This adds another level of statistical com—
plication and yet another P—value cutoff. Practically this style of ana—
lysis often produces a list of DE miRNA, a list of DE miRNA targets
and a list of pathway analyses for each miRNA. These nested lists
can quickly become unmanageable, in some sense broadening an ex—
ploratory analysis instead of focusing it.

Instead of performing functional pathway analysis as an after
thought, directly considering how miRNA interact with annotated
pathways may help the interpretation of their function. It is well
documented that the predicted gene targets of miRNA are often over—
represented for annotated functional pathways (Maragkakis et 61].,
2009; Wang, 2008). Likewise, annotated pathways are over—
represented for predicted gene targets of miRNA (see Supplementary
Section S3 for further explanation). This observation suggests that
pathway databases contain stable information about miRNA-mRNA
regulatory networks. If leveraged effectively, this information could
improve both the power and interpretability of results.

To this end, we propose an integrative analysis for pathways,
Micro-RNA and mRNA (pMim) incorporating publicly available bio—
logical network information and miRNA target predictions together
with experimental RNA—seq and miRNA—seq data. This novel frame—
work is the first to allow for the joint ranking of interesting miRNA
and pathways by directly testing for miRNA that target a group of
genes from a specific biological pathway in response to a treatment or
condition. This approach produces one list of biologically interpret—
able results instead of the multiple lists generated by the previously
described methods. Also, due to its simplicity it is free of the statistic—
ally demanding task of estimating complex miRNA-mRNA inter-
actions making it suitable for datasets with small sample sizes.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 pMiM: Pathway, miRNA and mRNA integration

A framework for integrating various data sources to identify regula—
tory miRNA and their targets, pMim, is described below. This
framework will be utilized to form three specific methods cMimDE,
pMimDE and pMimCor. The method cMimDE is proposed as a
method to identify regulatory miRNA and their targets in an experi-
ment. The concept of mir—pathways is then proposed and used to

develop pMimDE and pMimCor as methods for identifying regula-
tory miRNA that may be targeting a group of genes that share a
common biological function.

We first describe in detail the input data sources and notation be—
fore describing the methods in detail. Let Y be a pg by 11 matrix cor—
responding to gene expression estimates for pg genes in 11 samples,
where the 11 samples are divided into two conditions where for sam—
ple j, y(j) : 1 or 2. Similarly let Z be a matrix of expression esti—
mates for pm,- miRNA and the same matched 11 samples. Assume
there also exists some pm,- by pg matrix M, where M),- is equal to one
if the ith miRNA is predicted to bind to the jth gene and is zero
otherwise. Furthermore, assume there exists some functional or
pathway annotation of the genes and represent this as a pf by pg ma—
trix F, where F),- is equal to one if the jth gene is in the ith group and
zero otherwise.

Prior to integration, the information from matrices Y and Z are
reduced to summary statistics. The vectors of test statistics tY and t2
are calculated for whether each of the genes and miRNA, respect—
ively, are DE between conditions. The pm,- by pg matrix K contains
the probabilities of observing the negative correlations between each
of the miRNA and genes. When combining information from tests,
Stouffer’s method (Stouffer et 61]., 1949) or a one—sided Pearson’s
method (OSP) (Pearson, 1934) will be used for testing if any or all of
tests have shown change respectively. Further details regarding the
summary statistics and combination methods are described in
Supplementary Section Sl.

2.1.1 cMimDE: Classic miRNA and mRNA integration using DE

A common approach for highlighting interesting miRNA-mRNA re-
lationships is to first identify a DE miRNA and then use predicted
binding target information to perform an enrichment analysis on the
DE genes or miRNA-mRNA correlations (Xu and Wong, 2013).
This is similar to taking the maximum of the DE miRNA P-value
and the enrichment analysis P—value. Taking the maximum of two
P—values will result in dramatic reduction of power for the combined
P—value. In the following, cMimDE is proposed as both a formaliza—
tion and improvement of this approach.

The method cMimDE tests whether a miRNA is DE and its target
genes are DE in the opposite direction. For simplicity, consider finding
miRNA with negative log fold change and genes with positive log fold
change. A gene set test can then be performed to test whether the tar—
get genes of the ith miRNA are up—regulated using Stouffer’s method

'2 q>-1(P(t,Y > 0))
s=¢ﬂwﬂ , (D

where q) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard nor—
mal distribution. This gene set test could also have been performed
using any method that is favoured, such as by using Fisher Method,
a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, over-representation test or gene set en-
richment analysis (Subramanian et 61]., 2005).

To identify those miRNA that are negatively DE and whose tar—
get genes are positively DE we can then combine the vectors t2 and s
using OSP, where

PfMimDE = P<U < —210g ((1 — P(t,-Z < 0))(1 — 5,)» (2)

and U is distributed as a chi—squared distribution with 211 degrees of
freedom. This test will rank similarly to taking the maximum of the
two P-values from the miRNA DE and its corresponding gene set test.

2.1.2 pMimDE: Pathway, miRNA and mRNA integration using DE
In addition to finding miRNA that are potentially regulating their tar—
get genes it may be of interest to find miRNA that are regulating a set
of genes that also share some common biological function or out—
come. This test can be implemented by performing gene set tests on
the genes that lie in the intersection of the binding target predictions
of a miRNA and a biological pathway. These intersections will be
referred to as mir—pathways. Stouffers method can again be used to
perform this gene set test and find evidence of whether a set of genes
in a particular mir—pathway (i.e. genes that are both targeted by the
ith miRNA and also belong to the lath functional pathway) are up—
regulated. Let the matrix S have entries that correspond to these tests

Sik whose corresponding mir—pathways contain less than two inter—
secting genes will be defined as empty.

These gene set tests, S, can then be combined with the miRNA
test statistics tZ using OSP. However, as using OSP is similar to tak-
ing the maximum of two P—values, then as multiple gene set tests are
being performed on the target genes of each miRNA, it can be ex—
pected that one of the P—values of these gene set tests will be smaller
than the miRNA P—value due to multiple testing. This will result in
the ranking of the minimum combined P-values for each miRNA
being very close to the ranking of the miRNA P—values. To account
for these multiple testing issues a multiple testing correction will be
applied to each row of S before combining using OSP. Many of the
mir—pathways may contain similar genes and hence their expression
may be correlated. A conservative approach will be taken, ignoring
this correlation and performing a row-wise Benjamini-Hochberg
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) correction to S and calling
uussﬂh

To identify those miRNA that are negatively DE and whose tar—
get genes are both positively DE and share some common biological
function the elements of the matrix 5de can now be combined with
the elements of the vector tZ using OSP, where

U is chi—squared distributed with 211 degrees of freedom and

PPM"MDE is a pm,- by pf matrix.

2.1.3 pMimCor: Pathway, miRNA and mRNA integration using
correlation

Finding sets of genes that are DE in the opposite direction to a
miRNA is very similar to requiring the expression of genes to be
negatively correlated with the expression of their corresponding
miRNA between conditions if a true relationship exists. In the fol—
lowing, the method pMimDE is extended to simply require that the
expression of a miRNA and gene be negatively correlated. As the
correlation between the expression of a miRNA and its targets is ex—
pected to be negative, the test described for pMimDE can be modi-
fied by replacing the definition of Sik with

2.2 Data

Four datasets with matched miRNA—Seq and RNA—Seq samples will
be used to evaluate the proposed methods. The first, Notch, consists
of matched mRNA and miRNA enriched cortical samples from
three wild type mice and three conditional Note/92 knockout mice.
In this dataset, Note/92 has been conditionally deleted in the brain
with a nestin—cre driver. Cortical samples were isolated from
matched mutant and control adult mice The other three are from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and were chosen to represent a
broad spectrum of cancers. These datasets were analysed from a
prognostic perspective and were hence split into groups to represent
good prognosis (GP) and poor prognosis (PP). The ovarian serous
cystadenocarcinoma data (Ovarian) has 26 matched mRNA and
miRNA enriched samples in GP and 23 in PP. The skin cutaneous
melanoma data (Melanoma) has 19 matched mRNA and miRNA
enriched samples in GP and 21 in PP. While the lung adenocarcin-
oma data (Lung) has 16 matched mRNA and miRNA enriched sam-
ples in GP and 17 in PP. Further information on how these datasets
were processed and split into prognosis groups can be found in
Supplementary File S1.

2.3 Evaluation

Three approaches will be used to evaluate the performance and via—
bility of the proposed methods cMimDE, pMimDE and pMimCor.
For these evaluations TargetScan (Lewis et al., 2005) and KEGG
(Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) are used as the predicted binding target
and pathway databases respectively. Both databases are accessed via
the R packages multiMiR (Ru et al., 2014) and KEGGdb (Carlson,
2014)

2.3.1 Evaluating signal in the data

One of the key limitations of working with small sample sizes is the
inability to use sampling methods, such as cross—validation, to im—
prove confidence about results. However, the experimental data is
not the only input into our proposed methods. As pMimCor and
pMimDE rely on large pathway and target matrices, we propose
that these are resampled instead.

Inferring data-specific micro-RNA function

2825

 

A method for evaluating the output of pMimCor when run on
the four evaluation datasets is described as follows:
Resampling scheme:

pMimCor is implemented using KEGG and TargetScan as inputs.
The number of significant mir—pathways are calculated at an ar—
bitrary P—value cut—off. This is then repeated one hundred times,
finding the average number of significant mir—pathways, after
randomly reassigning the genes for each pathway in KEGG, re—
assigning the target genes for each miRNA in TargetScan, and re—
assigning genes in both KEGG and TargetScan.

The P—values have not been adjusted for multiple testing across
miRNA. If there is signal related to miRNA regulation in the data,
the binding target predictions are accurate and there exists anno—
tated phenotypes that are associated with miRNA regulation then
resampling the pathway and/or target matrices should reduce the
number significant mir-pathways found. The probit rank transform-
ation is used when estimating the probability of a miRNA-gene cor-
relation in the Notch dataset while the Fisher transformation is used
in the TCGA datasets.

2.3.2 Evaluation via literature search
The performance of the proposed methods will be assessed by their
concordance with results from a literature search. For example, the
Notch experiment was designed to study the loss of N ate/92 function
in the brain in the context of neurodegeneration. With this in mind,
PubMed can be used to identify miRNA that have been associated
with neurodegeneration. This information will allow the concurrent
verification of the relationships between miRNA regulation, the loss
of N ate/92 function and any effect on neurodegeneration and the ef—
fectiveness of our proposed analysis framework.

The strategy for performing and evaluating the literature search
is outlined as follows:

Literature search strategy:

A PubMed search was performed for each miRNA that was
observed in the data. Each miRNA was included in the following
analysis if it had at least one publication referring to it in the ab—
stract. A second batch of searches was performed searching for
each miRNA and a key word, e.g. ‘neurodegeneration’. A
miRNA was then classified as being associated with neurodegen—
eration if it had at least one hit on this search. Treating this infor—
mation as an approximation of the truth, it was then used to cal—
culate the number of true positives (TP) and false positives (FP)
for four methods; miRNA DE, a moderated t—test on just the
miRNA data; cMimDE, a classic miRNA and mRNA integration
using just miRNA and gene DE; pMimDE and pMimCor, path—
way, miRNA and mRNA integration using DE correlation
respectively.

As pMimDE and pMimCor have many P—values for each
miRNA, the minimum of these for each miRNA was taken to
provide a rank for the miRNA.

A miRNA is labelled as TP for a method if that method identifies it
as interesting and it had a hit in the search. Alternatively, a miRNA
is labelled as FP if the method identifies it as interesting and it did
not have a hit in the search. This approach will be biased towards
previous research and/or methodology. The search terms
‘Melanoma’, ‘Ovarian’ and ‘Adenocarcinoma’ were used for the
Melanoma, Ovarian and Lung datasets respectively.

2.3.3 Evaluation of prognostic performance
To further assess the concordance of the miRNA identified by each
of the methods and their corresponding target genes a prognostic

strategy will be used. If a miRNA is regulatory with respect to a con—
dition of interest, its target genes should be viable prognostic
markers.

Prognostic strategy:

The three most significant miRNA from each method are selected
after being applied to a complete dataset. The samples of the
dataset are then split into five folds. Four of these folds are used
to calculate differential gene expression with respect to progno—
sis. The 10 most significantly DE genes that are also targeted by
the three significant miRNA are then used to build a classifier
using diagonalized linear discriminant analysis (DLDA) trained
on the four folds. This classifier is then tested on the remaining
fold. The process is repeated for each fold and replicated 100
times. A classification error is then calculated.

This prognostic strategy is applied to the Melanoma, Ovarian and
Lung datasets. The four methods for selecting the three most signifi-
cant miRNA are the same as those outlined in the literature search
strategy. Classification errors are also calculated using the top 1'
most differentially expressed genes within the training set, for
i = 2, 3, . . . ,5 0, to give perspective on the impact of the number of
genes used.

3 Results

A resampling scheme was used to evaluate if there is miRNA regula—
tion in any of the datasets and to illustrate the importance of having
accurate predicted binding target and pathway matrices when
implementing pMimDE and pMimCor. Table 1 shows the results
from the resampling scheme applied to four different datasets.
Randomising either the pathway (KEGG) or predicted binding tar—
get (TargetScan) matrices reduces the number of mir—pathways that
are called significant in all four datasets. Randomising both matrices
reduces the number of mir—pathways further. This suggests that both
KEGG and TargetScan matrices contain information pertinent to
miRNA regulation. This is also suggestive that miRNA may be regu—
lating gene expression in each of the datasets. While observed in all
datasets this pattern is observed most strongly in the Melanoma
data, with the number of identified mir—pathways dropping 80%
from 92 to 18 mir—pathways after randomization.

In order to compare the miRNA rankings of four methods;
miRNA DE, cMimDE, pMimDE and pMimCor, a strategy based on
broad literature searches is used. Methods which rank highly
miRNA that have been associated with the conditions in each of the
datasets in the literature would be considered favourable. Figure 2
plots the TP against FP for the region of small FP for each of the
four datasets. Full ROC curves can be found in Supplementary File
S1. For this region of small FP, pMimCor performs better than or
comparably to all other approaches in every dataset. This is because

against False Positives (FP) for the small FPR regions of the ROC curves in
Supplementary Figure 4. The plotted lines are for four methods, miRNA DE
(black), cMimDE (green), pMimDE (blue) and pMimCor (red). This is per-
formed on four datasets (a) Notch, (b) Melanoma, (c) Ovarian and (d) Lung

for any FP it generally has a higher TP, i.e. its curve is higher than
the others. In the Melanoma dataset all methods appear to perform
comparably. In the remaining three datasets pMimCor performs
most favourably with a simple miRNA DE test generally performing
worst. The method pMimCor appears to be identifying more
miRNA that have been associated each of the datasets in the litera—
ture than the other methods.

The prognostic strategy is used to compare the concordance of
the miRNA identified by each of the methods and their correspond—
ing target genes. If a miRNA has been identified as a prognostic
marker its target genes should also be able to predict prognosis.
Figure 3 shows boxplots of the classification error rates of these tar—
get genes for each of the cancer datasets. These error rates were cal—
culated after training a DLDA on the 10 most DE targeted genes of
each method. The choice of this number is shown to be not too in—
ﬂuential on the results in Supplementary Figure S5. In all three data—
sets cMimDE, pMimDE and pMimCor deliver error rates less than
0.5. In the Melanoma dataset all miRNA based methods perform
similarly, with simply taking the 10 most DE genes performing dra-
matically worse. In Lung all the integration based methods;
cMimDE, pMimDE and pMimCor, perform favourably to the other
two approaches who have error rates of 50%. Both pMimDE and
pMimCor appear most preferable in the Ovarian dataset.
Supplementary Figure S5 demonstrates that these results are rela—
tively robust to the choice of the number of genes under consider—
ation. Unsurprisingly, methods that integrate both miRNA and gene
data show greater concordance in behaviour between their identified
miRNA and genes.

Our proposed methods pMiMDE and pMimCor rank both
miRNA and pathways concurrently which can improve biological
interpretation. To illustrate this Table 2 lists the top 10 mir—path—
ways identified by pMimCor in the Notch dataset. In this dataset,
NotchZ has been conditionally deleted in the brain of mice using a
nestin—cre driver. Cortical samples were isolated from matched mu—
tant and control adult mice. The affected mir—pathways are consist—
ent with known Notch function in the nervous system. Notch
signalling has been associated with ALS (Praline et al., 2010) and
Alzheimers disease (Chavez—Gutierrez et al., 2012), and loss of

N otchZ leads to neurodegeneration in the olfactory system
(Rodriguez et al., 2008). Furthermore, Notch signalling is known to
play important roles in axon guidance, synaptic plasticity and learn—
ing and memory (Alberi et al., 2013). Notch signalling also possesses
significant cross talk with other signalling pathways, including the
jade-STAT pathway (Kamakura et al., 2004). Finally, Notch sig-
nalling regulates growth and differentiation, and as such is impli—
cated in many cancers (Balint et al., 2005; Santagata et al., 2004;
Wang et al., 2006). In keeping with this, Notch is a key regulator of
neurogenesis in the brain (Imayoshi et al., 2010). The identified mir-
pathways are therefore consistent with the existing literature, and
provide a biological context for understanding how misregulation of
miRNA in N otchZ mutants can affect neuronal function.

4 Discussion

The key strength of pMimDE and pMimCor is to rank both miRNA
and pathways concurrently, i.e. rank the top mir—pathways. As such,
these may be considered favourable approaches for integration as
they facilitate interpretation and directly address the biological ques—
tion. However, quantitatively assessing the performance of these
rankings is not trivial in the absence of the known truth. As such, we
have assessed the performance of the proposed methods via three
evaluation techniques. While individually these techniques are sug—
gestive at best, concurrently they provide a more complete picture of
each methods performance.

Our proposed method has recently been applied to an experi—
ment using microarrays to investigate the associations between
miRNA and gene expression with BRAF mutations and patient
prognosis in stage III metastatic melanoma (Tembe et al., 2014). In
comparison to other state of the art methods used in the analysis,
our approach provided insights that could not be easily made using
the other approaches. It has been our experience that the joint rank-
ing of miRNA and pathways provided by pMim makes the informa—
tion from studying miRNA-mRNA interactions more easily
accessible and interpretable.

The Notch dataset is previously unpublished and has a small
sample size yet still identifies signal concordant with the predicted
phenotype. This is promising in two ways. Firstly, it demonstrates
the benefits of using a predefined network structure as opposed to
one derived empirically. Deriving a large complex network using six
samples would generally be ill advised. However, using the prede—
fined mir-pathways, pMimCor is able to identify signal, demonstrat—
ing that small samples experiments can still be informative even
when calculating correlations on only six samples. Secondly, as this
dataset is unpublished and still identifies signal concordant with the
literature, it protects against publication bias in the evaluation
approach.

In both the literature search strategy and prognostic strategy the
integration approaches; cMimDE, pMimDE and pMimCor, gener-
ally perform better than using only the gene or miRNA data. This
potentially demonstrates the value of integrating data to ask com—
plex questions. Alternatively, there are arguments why both of the
evaluation strategies should be biased towards the integration
approaches and it is reassuring to observe the results concordant
with these expected biases. In the literature search strategy a
miRNA may be more likely to have been associated with a condition
in the literature if that miRNA and its targets have been observed as
changed. Whilst in the prognostic strategy, as the miRNA for each
method are chosen outside of cross—validation performance could be
biased towards those methods that use gene information.

A table of the top 10 mir-pathways identiﬁed by pMimCor in the Notch dataset. The table consists of four columns; the miRNA that was identiﬁed as changed,
the direction the miRNA expression changed, a signiﬁcance score of the mir-pathway and the pathway contained the target genes.

The general framework described in this paper has some natural
extensions. It is possible to extend pMim to cover experiments with
multiple conditions by combining the p—value from testing the equal—
ity of group means (using a one—way ANOVA) of the miRNA ex-
pression with the correlations between the miRNA and the genes in
a mir-pathway. Also, many significance combination approaches
can be modified to include weights including Stouffer’s method
(Liptak, 1958). Weights could be included to increase the impact of
genes that are thought to be highly influential on the biology in
question.

Our integration approach has raised some statistically interesting
questions that should warrant further investigation. To transcend
the typical modularized analysis framework, our approaches make
use of P—value combination methods to combine significance. By
combining significance from a DE test of one miRNA with tests on
multiple gene sets, pMim suffers from an issue associated with cor—
recting for multiple comparisons. While there has been some re—
search into correction for multiple comparisons in the presence of
correlated pathways (Holmans et al., 2009), this methodology could
be extended further to account for having correlated summary stat—
istics from multiple miRNA. It would also be interesting to establish
whether it is more appropriate to correct for multiple testing before
or after utilising a P—value combination method like Fisher or OSP.

In addition to considering how individual miRNA regulate a set
of gene, miRNA are also known to act in groups to regulate genes.
One broad group of statistical methods aims to identify groups of
genes that are potentially being regulated by a miRNA or group of

miRNA. Such methods include canonical correlation analysis
(Witten and Tibshirani, 2009), nonnegative matrix factorization
(Zhang et al., 2011), multivariate random forests (Jayaswal et al.,
2011) and integrative Bayesian analysis (Wang et al., 2013).
Statistically these methods can be thought of as ways of identifying
relationships between a high dimensional multivariate response and
high dimensional multivariate covariates. Unfortunately, as these
methods are attempting to identify large complex networks their re-
sults are very dependent on sample size. As with the simpler univari-
ate tests, the interpretation of the outputs from these methods can
quickly become intimidating due to the many pathway analyses
being performed on multiple lists of results. For datasets with suffi—
cient sample size, our framework may be used as a first pass of ana—
lysis before implementing more sophisticated or intricate
approaches.

We can easily incorporate other functional databases into the
pMim framework. The framework is not restricted to any specific
databases such as the TargetScan and KEGG databases that were
used as the predicted binding target and pathway databases respect—
ively in this paper. Depending on the question of interest and the
desired interpretation, scientists could easily substitute the pathway
database with other functional relevant databases such as those on
GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005) or DAVID (Dennis et al., 2003).
The resampling scheme outlined in the evaluation, as well as a fur—
ther strategy outlined in Section 3 of the supplementary file, could
both be used to assess the viability of any alternate predicted binding
target or functional database. We have included an evaluation of the

5 Conclusion

We described a general framework, pMim, for integrating miRNA
expression, gene expression and annotation information. From this
framework three methods were proposed, cMimDE, pMimDE and
pMimCor. The method cMimDE is a formalization and mild im-
provement of previously described approaches for identifying regu-
latory miRNA. The methods pMimDE and pMimCor are both
novel methods for identifying if a miRNA is regulating a set of genes
that also share some common biological function. Each of these
methods relies on a predefined network structure derived from
miRNA binding target predictions and/or biological pathway anno—
tations making them suitable for use on experiments with limited
replication. The proposed pMimDE and pMimCor are the first
methods to jointly rank miRNA and pathways in relation to a condi—
tion of interest which greatly facilitates biological interpretation.

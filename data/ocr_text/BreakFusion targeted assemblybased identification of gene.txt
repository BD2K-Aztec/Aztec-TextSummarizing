ABSTRACT

Summary: Despite recent progress, computational tools that identify
gene fusions from next-generation whole transcriptome sequencing
data are often limited in accuracy and scalability. Here, we present
a software package, BreakFusion that combines the strength of
reference alignment followed by read-pair analysis and de novo
assembly to achieve a good balance in sensitivity, specificity and
computational efficiency.

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite recent progress, bioinformatics tools that analyze RNA-seq
data are often limited in accuracy and scalability. Alignment-based
tools (Garber et al., 2011) typically predict such large numbers
of candidates that further examination of the data is impractical.
Furthermore, many ﬁndings are artifacts derived from a large
number of erroneous short reads produced by the next-generation
sequencing (NGS) instruments or are read misalignments produced
by the sequence aligners. Assembly-based approaches (Martin and
Wang, 2011) can potentially achieve higher accuracy because they
leverage dependency among reads and are less sensitive to errors
in individual reads. With sufﬁcient coverage, longer and higher
quality sequences can be assembled from short reads, resulting in
improved speciﬁcity. However, existing assembly-based approaches
(Garber et al., 2011; Grabherr et al., 2011; Robertson et al., 2010;
Trapnell et al., 2010) potentially lack sensitivity to rare events such
as gene fusions because they are designed to reconstruct entire
transcriptomes, rather than focus on novel sequences. We reason
that a targeted transcriptome assembly strategy that focuses on
assembling novel junction sequences can potentially achieve a better
balance in sensitivity, speciﬁcity and computational efﬁciency.

2 METHODS

Here we present an NGS Bioinformatics pipeline, BreakFusion that
implements a targeted assembly approach for novel transcriptomic sequence
discovery.

BreakFusion consists of ﬁve steps, as illustrated in Figure 1. The input is
one or a set of whole transcriptome BAM ﬁles that contains mapped paired-
end RNA-seq reads. The mapping can be performed using a set of algorithms
such as BWA and TopHat, preferably including known splice junctions in the
references to achieve good alignment. Step 1 identiﬁes splicing breakpoints
using a read-pair algorithm such as BreakDancer (Chen et al., 2009) or any
splice mapping algorithm such as TopHat-Fusion (Kim and Salzberg, 2011).
Step 2 locally assembles short reads that are anchored around each breakpoint
using TIGRA and produces a set of splice junction contigs that are supported
by both mapped and one-end—anchored reads (Mills et al., 2011). TIGRA is
a de Bruijn graph-based assembler that is specially designed to construct all
possible allelic sequences at loci of heterogeneous origin. It is sufﬁciently
sensitive to identify low abundance alleles as long as their constituent
kmers are observed at least twice in the reads. Step 3 aligns the junction
sequences to the genome using BLAT (Kent, 2002). Step 4 summarizes BLAT
alignments into a single chimeric score that quantiﬁes the likelihood of an

assembled junction sequence containing bonaﬁde breakpoints relative to the
genome. Step 5 annotates the breakpoints using UCSC databases and ﬁlters
the breakpoints by mainly two factors: (i) the chimeric scores computed in
Step 4, and (ii) the self-chain alignment annotation, which indicates whether
the breakpoints are caused by misalignment in duplicated regions.

Most steps in the BreakFusion pipeline are performed by previously
published and well-attested algorithms. The chimeric scoring system in
Step 4 is novel to this work. By default, BLAT does not produce a single
hit for transcripts that span two chromosomes or distances >750 000 bp.
Instead, it reports individual alignments for each of the sub-segments, with
no direct indication of the existence of the chimeric structure and the level of
conﬁdence associated with it. To overcome such limitation, we ﬁrst remove
hits that are not unique (i.e. map to multiple regions). We then chain the
remaining alignments into longer ones if they can form 1-m0notonic maps
(Brudno et al., 2003). We compute scores for chained alignment using the
same BLAT formula that is used for each constituent alignment. We identify
the best and the second best alignment after chaining, and compute a chimeric
score using the following equation:

L40) L40)
1 —e 10

0:6 0

9

Where q* is the alignment score of the best chained alignment, q’ the second
best, and q0 is the length of the query sequence. This equation produces
scores between 0 and 1.0. The score becomes high when the best alignment
well explains the entire query sequence (q* approaches qO) and the second
best alignment is appreciably worse (q’ <<q*). The constant 10 makes the
scores sensitive to differences at the 10-bp scale.

3 RESULTS

To test BreakFusion’s performance, we compared it with TopHat-
Fusion and defuse (McPherson et al., 2011) using four publicly
available RNA-seq datasets: a prostate cancer cell line (NCIH660)
and a matched lymphoblastoid cell line (GM12878) (Sboner
et al., 2010), a breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) (Edgren et al.,
2011) and a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line (K—562)
(Berger et al., 2010). BreakFusion achieved better sensitivity and
speciﬁcity tradeoff in these tests (Supplementary Data). It also used
substantially less CPU time. We further applied BreakFusion to
analyze RNA-seq data for 155 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
samples as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. This
dataset was also analyzed by the Genome Sciences Centre at the
BC Cancer Agency (BCCA) using Tran-Abyss (Robertson et al.,
2010), which resulted in 67 instances of experimentally validated
fusions. BreakFusion was able to rediscover all these fusions and
additionally predicted eight new instances of fusions, which were
subsequently conﬁrmed by the BCCA group (Supplementary Data).

4 DISCUSSION

To the best of our knowledge, BreakFusion is the ﬁrst approach
that performs targeted assembly on RNA-seq data for fusion
identiﬁcation. The results of our experiments indicate that
BreakFusion has achieved sensitivity and speciﬁcity comparable

or better than other tools, and is clearly more computationally
efﬁcient. This, in our view, represents a methodology improvement
that will beneﬁt many projects that utilize NGS RNA sequencing
data. Besides fusion discovery, in principle, BreakFusion can be
applied to identify novel alternative splicing events.

The component programs of BreakFusion are efﬁciently
implemented in C++ and per]. It ﬁnished analyzing 155 TCGA
AML BAM ﬁles in <2 h using 155 CPUs with 4GB RAM
each. BreakFusion is freely available for academic use at http://

ABSTRACT

Summary: The large amount of data produced by proteomics
experiments requires effective bioinformatics tools for the integration
of data management and data analysis. Here we introduce a suite
of tools developed at Vanderbilt University to support production
proteomics. We present the Backup Utility Service tool for automated
instrument file backup and the ScanSifter tool for data conversion.
We also describe a queuing system to coordinate identification
pipelines and the File Collector tool for batch copying analytical
results. These tools are individually useful but collectively reinforce
each other. They are particularly valuable for proteomics core
facilities or research institutions that need to manage multiple mass
spectrometers. With minor changes, they could support other types
of biomolecular resource facilities.

1 INTRODUCTION

Mass spectrometry (MS)—based proteomics offers a remarkably
powerful technology for identiﬁcation of proteins in complex
biological samples. Bioinformatics tools are essential to this process
(Nesvizhskii, 2010). Proteomics services are often provided through
shared MS instrumentation with the support of external computing
resources. Core facilities often struggle to manage the volume of
data that these instruments can generate, resulting in irregular or
non—existent backup plans and long delays separating sample receipt
and information release for end—users. Existing freely available
tools such as TPP (Keller et al., 2005), CPAS (Nelson et al.,
2011) and CPFP (Trudgian et al., 2010) focus only on data
analysis by providing a set of tools for peptide identiﬁcation and
validation. A Laboratory Information Management System may
offer some capabilities for integration of instrument data backup
and data analysis, but these services usually catalog samples and
bench procedure more effectively than they manage bioinformatics
workﬂows, with little support for proteomics studies. We addressed

these challenges by developing a suite of tools to support production
proteomics. These tools are in daily use at the Vanderbilt Mass
Spectrometry Research Center and the Jim Ayers Institute for
Precancer Detection and Diagnosis. They are now freely available
with source code to commercial, government and academic users.

2 SOFTWARE OVERVIEW

The workﬂow of these supporting tools is illustrated in Figure 1. The
Backup Utility Service (BUS) tool offers automated backup of raw
data to ﬁle servers. The ScanSifter tool reads these proprietary format
ﬁles and converts them to open format ﬁles, which are submitted to
a queuing system and identiﬁed by database search engines such as
SEQUEST (Eng et al., 1994) and MyriMatch (Tabb et al., 2007).
The identiﬁcation results can be retrieved using the File Collector
tool, enabling batch copying search results to local computer or
network drives. We also provide an instrument ﬁle naming utility
to quickly generate ﬁlenames in a standard consistent fashion as
opposed to manually entering each ﬁlename into the instrument
control software. Each tool can be used separately to fulﬁll its
function. Combining these tools offers an integrated solution for
production proteomics.

2.1 Backup utility service (BUS)

The BUS tool automates ﬁle backup from instruments to sets of ﬁle
servers. It operates as a conﬁgurable, scheduled Windows service,

Supporting tool suite

 

seeking ﬁle system changes and copying updated ﬁles on a regular
basis. A graphical user interface facilitates the conﬁguration process.
BUS is a Windows application written in C# and should be installed
in each computer that controls a mass spectrometer. It can be used
in either a standalone desktop or web service—coordinated capacity.
In the latter case, the metadata of archived ﬁles are stored in an
Oracle database or a free Oracle database Express Edition; a script
to initiate the Oracle database is provided in the distribution package.
This database can then assist the ScanSifter for data conversion to
forestall additional ﬁle copy steps.

2.2 ScanSifter

ScanSifter is a data conversion tool to transcode and ﬁlter mass
spectra. It reads and writes a variety of formats via use of the
ProteoWizard (Kessner et al., 2008) library. Currently, it supports
spectral data in proprietary formats from Bruker and Thermo; adding
other formats supported by ProteoWizard requires few changes. It
exports data in szL (Deutsch, 2008), szML (Pedrioli et al.,
2004), szata, MGF and DTA formats. It can also translate ﬁles
from MGF or XML—based formats to the others.

ScanSifter implements several algorithms for recognizing mass
spectra that can be ﬁltered prior to export. By default, the software
will output all mass spectra, but users can, for example, export
only MS/MS/MS scans. Noise spectra can be ﬁltered by imposing a
minimum required peak count or total ion current (TIC). In special
cases, a researcher may be interested in scans that correspond to
a narrow range of precursor m/z values, and this ﬁlter is also
implemented.

Two versions of ScanSifter are included in the distribution
package: ScanSifter Web and ScanSifter Desktop. The former is
installed in a Microsoft IIS server to provide web services that
read input ﬁles from designated network directories. Alternatively,
it can be conﬁgured to read a BUS database and ﬁnd archived raw
ﬁles automatically. The converted ﬁles are stored in ﬁle servers and
subsequently processed by identiﬁcation tools. ScanSifter Web can
coordinate the use of shared ﬁle servers among multiple labs. If
multiple ScanSifter jobs are submitted at the same time, they will
be queued for processing.

ScanSifter Desktop is a standalone Windows application written
in C#/.NET. Besides the ﬁltering features described above, it
provides three algorithms to enable the removal of duplicate spectra
during data conversion. The ﬁrst algorithm adapts the scoring
approach for MyriMatch (Tabb et al., 2007) to recognize similar
spectra. The second algorithm computes a normalized dot product
for spectral comparison, as is typical in spectral library search. The
third algorithm treats m/z values of two spectra as two groups,
and calculates the distance between the distributions of these two
groups through the Kolmogorov—Smirnov test. If duplicate spectra
are observed during data conversion, only the spectrum with the
highest TIC is retained and exported to the output ﬁle.

2.3 Identiﬁcation pipeline and queuing system

A queuing system and web interfaces to run peptide identiﬁcation
pipelines are included in the distribution package and should be
installed in a Linux server. The queuing system is written in Perl and
coordinates with the TORQUE resource manager or Moab Cluster
Manager. Web interfaces to run database search by SEQUEST (Eng
et al., 1994) and MyriMatch (Tabb et al., 2007) are provided.

Sequence tagging—based modiﬁcation search by TagRecon (Dasari
et al., 2010) is also enabled. A FASTA database maintenance tool
is provided to upload new sequence databases and view the status
of current databases. The queuing system can separate LC—MS/MS
experiments to many tasks, maintaining a target number of running
jobs for a cluster. Status queries and error logs are ﬁelded by provided
support tools.

2.4 File Collector

The File Collector tool enables batch copying search results and
spectral ﬁles from ﬁle servers to local computer or network drives.
It is a Windows application written in C#/.NET. Filters such as ﬁle
type or ﬁle name are enabled. A conﬁguration ﬁle is used to specify
the source ﬁle locations. Network resources are not required to be
mounted as drive letters; the system supports UNC path description.

3 SUMMARY

Handling data for multiple mass spectrometers requires support
tools. We developed these tools to enable analysis of data from
several instruments operating continuously in our laboratories.
We hope that these systems for data transport and computing
coordination will be broadly useful to others in their present
form or with slight modiﬁcations. All applications are released
under an open source license to accommodate both academic
and commercial users. The queue management and data archival
tools could easily be applied in other biotechnologies with
minimal modiﬁcation. As high—throughput instrumentation becomes
ubiquitous, the challenges of managing these data ﬂows will
only increase. Software systems such as these will only grow in
importance to shared instrument facilities.

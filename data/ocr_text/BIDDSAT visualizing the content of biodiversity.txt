ABSTRACT

Summary: In any data quality workflow, data publishers must
become aware of issues in their data so these can be corrected.
User feedback mechanisms provide one avenue, while global
assessments of datasets provide another. To date, there is no publicly
available tool to allow both biodiversity data institutions sharing their
data through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility network
and its potential users to assess datasets as a whole. Contributing
to bridge this gap both for publishers and users, we introduce
BloDiversity DataSets Assessment Tool, an online tool that enables
selected diagnostic visualizations on the content of data publishers
and/or their individual collections.

Availability and implementation: The online application is
accessible at http://www.unav.es/unzyec/mzna/biddsat/ and is
supported by all major browsers. The source code is licensed

1 INTRODUCTION

Established in 2001 as an outcome of the OECD ‘Mega Science
Forum Working Group’ with the aim of ‘making the world’s primary
data on biodiversity freely and universally available Via the Internet’,
the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, http://www
.gbif.0rg) is currently considered to be the largest initiative in
providing access to collections of biodiversity records (Lane, 2003;
Saarenmaa, 2005; Scholes et al., 2012; Telenius, 2011). It is deﬁned
as a network of biodiversity data institutions (data publishers) that
own and manage digital collections of primary biodiversity data
(PBD) (Johnson, 2007) and make them publicly available on the
Internet. Coordinated at the International Secretariat in Copenhagen,
Denmark, GBIF acts as a worldwide proxy for PBD owned and
shared by participant institutions. In order to optimize information
query and retrieval and to serve as a common gateway to the data,
GBIF builds a searchable index (http://www.gbif.org/informatics/
infrastructure/indexingl). The institutions that j oin the GBIF network
remain the owners of their own records’ intellectual property rights
and host the authoritative version of the records. Therefore, GBIF
does not modify the original data, it being the data publishers’
responsibility for any data quality issue that might appear in their

own datasets. However, GBIF ﬂags data for which it encounters
issues on a record-by-record basis.

To enable effective interoperability of the heterogeneous data
sources that form its network, GBIF has adopted the DarwinCore
standard (Wieczorek et al., 2012) for sharing and indexing the
biodiversity data made available by the publishers. This standard,
available at http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/, deﬁnes elements describing,
i.e. the most basic pieces of the PBD—locality and taxonomic
identiﬁcation of the observed organism (Johnson, 2007)—as well as
other data such as time of collection, collector and curator names and
collection codes, and is used to map each publisher’s data structure
to a common data model.

In order to explore the reliability and usability of the biodiversity
information, recent trends in Biodiversity Informatics are shifting
from raw data accrual to developing quality and ﬁtness-for-use
assessments on the available data (see for example, Boakes et al.,
2010; Yesson et al., 2007), seeking clues on issues that could
impact those features. One of the aims of such assessments
is to generate sets of recommendations for data holders about
where to invest efforts or how to improve their content. To be
effective, these recommendations must reach the data managers at
the data publisher institution, and this brings the need for both a
straightforward assessment of the published data and an effective
feedback mechanism. Although being of prime importance, there
are still no fully suitable or reliable mechanisms by which data
publishers could easily access to the data they share from the users’
perspective (Hill et al., 2010; J etz et al., 2011).

This article presents the development of an online web application
that contributes to bridging this gap. BloDiversity DataSets
Assessment Tool (BIDDSAT) is an online PBD Visualization
environment in which some basic techniques are applied to the
content of data publishers and/or collections of the GBIF network.
This allows exploring the content of such datasets and ﬁnd tell-tale
patterns or biases that may reduce its quality or usability. With these
Visualizations, the source of error can also be detected, allowing data
publishers to ﬁx the issues at the source.

2 OVERVIEW

2.1 Data sources

Through an agreement with GBIF, we were granted access to
images of the full index of the data derived from its global network
of data publishers (more information available at www.gbif.org/
inforrnatics/infrastructure/retrievingl). These images are snapshots
of the database at the time of release and are structured as a group of
MySQL (http://www.mysql.com/) tables. We focused on three tables

of many available: ‘occurrence_record’, which holds the primary
records, and ‘taxon_concept’ and ‘taxon_name’, which are used to
de-codify taxonomic concepts and names that had been codiﬁed to
save space.

2.2 Data extraction

A series of routines have been developed as batch SQL extractions,
to get summary ﬁles for certain aspects of the content of the index
for each data publisher and each collection: spatial, temporal and
taxonomic distribution of records, as well as some other metadata. In
order to check the evolution of the information (the global correction
and data acquisition patterns), we have been mining several (though
not all) index images since May 2008 and have extracted these
summaries for each version of the database.

2.3 Data visualization interface

The Visualizations are built on the summary ﬁles. A series of
PHP (http://www.php.net/) webpages implement the scripts that
perform the data Visualizations: some of them make use of the
Google Charts API (http://code.google.com/apis/chart/) to enable
interactive graphic representations of the summary ﬁles’ content,
while others transform the content of such ﬁles to prepare two
special graphic types: maps and chronhorograms (Ariﬁo and Otegui,
2008), built upon the ImageMagick IMagick PHP extension (http://
www.imagemagick.orgl). A form gives access to the individual
Visualizations after selecting the desired version of the GBIF index,
the data publisher to be assessed and, optionally, the collection
within that publisher. Since the application is designed to check
individual collections or individual publishers as a whole, it is not
possible to select more than one collection or publisher at a time. The
ﬁelds for publisher and collection selection have an autocomplete
feature written with AJAX.

3 APPLICATION

This application Visualizes and assesses several aspects of the
content of the data publishers, which are based on recent advances
in data quality and ﬁtness-for—use analyses as well as on previous
work developed by the authors. The application is focused on
assessing the status of the three aspects of the PBD: geospatial,
temporal and taxonomic information, but some metadata issues are
also addressed, such as the volume of the collection/publisher or the
distribution of types of record. The Visualizations make it possible
to detect patterns—either ‘good’ (natural) or ‘wrong’ (artifactual)—
and issues, and in most cases the discovery of ‘wrong’ trends leads
to unveiling methodological issues in the datasets.

When processed by GBIF’s internal mechanisms, a data
publisher’s records pass through a standardization process and
some information is codiﬁed for performance reasons. If the
original data are not structured according to the standard schema,
some inconsistencies might appear in the process, leading to

interoperability issues. The content of a publisher is assessed as it is
once the records have gone through these processes, thus detecting
the ﬁnal status of the records as available to end users. Although there
are other tools to assess the quality of a set of data, the collection-
centric perspective of this tool allows for the effective detection of
patterns that would not arise when records are checked one by one.

4 CONCLUSION

Our online application tries to contribute to bridge biodiversity
data quality researchers and data managers in the GBIF network,
by allowing Visual exploration of a data publisher’s collection of
records. Being a web-based, openly available application, everyone
can access the assessments and, thus, anyone can contribute spotting
issues to the improvement of the available biodiversity data quality.
Our future roadmap points to the development of new quality
assessments and the establishment of an effective communication
channel with the data publishers themselves.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Repetitive DNA makes up large portions of plant and
animal nuclear genomes, yet it remains the least-characterized
genome component in most species studied so far. Although the
recent availability of high-throughput sequencing data provides neces-
sary resources for in-depth investigation of genomic repeats, its utility
is hampered by the lack of specialized bioinformatics tools and ap-
propriate computational resources that would enable large-scale
repeat analysis to be run by biologically oriented researchers.
Results: Here we present RepeatExplorer, a collection of software
tools for characterization of repetitive elements, which is accessible
via web interface. A key component of the server is the computational
pipeline using a graph-based sequence clustering algorithm to facili-
tate de novo repeat identification without the need for reference data-
bases of known elements. Because the algorithm uses short
sequences randomly sampled from the genome as input, it is ideal
for analyzing next-generation sequence reads. Additional tools are
provided to aid in classification of identified repeats, investigate phylo-
genetic relationships of retroelements and perform comparative ana-
lysis of repeat composition between multiple species. The server
allows to analyze several million sequence reads, which typically re-
sults in identification of most high and medium copy repeats in higher
plant genomes.

Implementation and availability: RepeatExplorer was implemented
within the Galaxy environment and set up on a public server at http://
repeatexplorer.umbr.cas.cz/. Source code and instructions for local
installation are available at http://w3lamc.umbr.cas.cz/lamc/
resources.php.

1 INTRODUCTION

In spite of the recent progress in genome sequencing technolo-
gies, accurate quantiﬁcation and sequence characterization of
repetitive DNA in complex plant and animal genomes remains
a challenging task. Most of the existing bioinformatics tools
either require completed genome assemblies for repeat identiﬁ-
cation or rely on similarity searches to databases of known re-
petitive elements. However, the number of fully assembled

genomes is still small, and many exhibit poor assembly quality
across repetitive regions where highly repetitive elements are
mostly omitted. On the other hand, database scanning enables
repeat identiﬁcation in any type of sequence data, but it in prin-
ciple does not allow detection of novel repetitive elements that
lack similarity to the database. Consequently, both of these
methods work well for extensively investigated groups of
model species but their application to a broader range of diverse
taxa is limited.

A principally different approach for global repeat analysis that
allows for de novo repeat identiﬁcation and is suitable for utiliz-
ing unassembled reads was developed by Novak et al. (2010). It
is based on ﬁnding and quantifying similarities between individ-
ual sequence reads typically obtained by next-generation sequen-
cing of randomly sheared genomic DNA. These similarities are
used to construct a graph in which the vertices correspond to
sequence reads, overlapping reads are connected with edges and
their similarity scores are expressed as edge weights. Graph top-
ology is then analyzed to identify and separate clusters of fre-
quently connected reads that represent individual families of
repetitive elements. This strategy proved to be efﬁcient in analyz-
ing repeat composition of both plant (Macas et al., 2011; Novak
et al., 2010) and animal (Pagan et al., 2012) genomes.

Here we report on the development of a computational pipe-
line implementing an improved version of graph-based clustering
and a number of additional tools for downstream analysis of the
identiﬁed repeats. All tools were adapted to run under the online
data analysis platform Galaxy (Goecks et al., 2010), which pro-
vides a user-friendly web interface and facilitates easy execution,
documentation and sharing of analysis protocols and results.

2 DESCRIPTION OF TOOLS

A schematic representation of the RepeatExplorer components is
depicted in Figure 1. Sequence reads are uploaded and
pre-processed using tools included in the Galaxy platform.
Optionally, RepeatExplorer tools can be used to manipulate
read names (e.g. adding speciﬁc codes for different datasets
that are later merged) and to perform random sampling of
single or paired-end reads to reduce the size of analyzed data.
The main component of RepeatExplorer is the clustering pipe-
line, which performs all-to-all similarity comparisons of sequence
reads followed by their graph-based clustering to identify groups
of reads derived from repetitive elements. These groups are

further characterized with respect to their proportion in the
genome and similarity to known repetitive elements and con-
served protein domains. Cluster graph layouts are calculated,
which in combination with the results of similarity searches,
can be used for manual classiﬁcation and annotation of repeats
in individual clusters (Novak et al., 2010). As the clustering pro-
cedure tends to split large repeats into several clusters, there is a
separate re—clustering tool for user-aided merging of clusters.
This can be performed taking into account read similarities be-
tween clusters and information about paired-end reads, if
available.

A set of tools is provided for identiﬁcation, extraction and
analysis of sequence regions corresponding to conserved do-
mains of retrotransposon proteins. The domains are identiﬁed
in contigs assembled from reads in individual clusters based on
their similarity to a representative set of reference sequences.
The domains can be further submitted to tools that facilitate
multiple sequence alignments and calculation of phylogenetic
trees.

The tools can be combined within the Galaxy environment
to generate analysis workﬂows aimed at speciﬁc tasks.
Example workﬂows are provided and further explained in the
RepeatExplorer manual (available online), covering the topics
of global repeat characterization in a single species, compara-
tive analysis of repeat composition between multiple species
and phylogenetic analysis of Long terminal repeat (LTR)-
retrotransposon sequences. They can be used to better under-
stand principles of analysis or as templates that can be modiﬁed
and re-used for user-provided data.

3 PERFORMANCE

Several million reads can be analyzed in one run on the current
RepeatExplorer server conﬁguration, which allocates up to
16GB RAM for individual processes. The actual number of
reads that can be processed depends on the number of similarity
hits they produce because all read overlaps must be loaded into
the computer memory during the graph-based clustering step
(Blondel et al., 2008). About 3.4 x 108 similarity hits is the cur-
rent limit of the server, which corresponds, for example, to the
number of hits generated by about 2 million Illumina reads
(100 nt) from the highly repeated genome of pea (Pisum sativum).
Proportionally larger numbers of reads can be analyzed for spe-
cies with lower repeat content like soybean (Novak et al., 2010),
where the limiting number of hits is produced by about 3 million
reads. It should be noted that the proportion of satellite DNA is
often the main factor affecting total number of similarity hits
because its repeated units have highly conserved sequences and
can occur in the genome in millions of copies. Should the current
RepeatExplorer server conﬁguration be limiting for users requir-
ing analysis of larger datasets, they are welcome to set up their
own instance of the server using the provided source code.

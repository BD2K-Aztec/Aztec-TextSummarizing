ABSTRACT

Summary: We present iAnn, an open source community-driven plat-
form for dissemination of life science events, such as courses, con-
ferences and workshops. iAnn allows automatic visualisation and
integration of customised event reports. A central repository lies at
the core of the platform: curators add submitted events, and these
are subsequently accessed via web services. Thus, once an iAnn
widget is incorporated into a website, it permanently shows timely
relevant information as if it were native to the remote site. At the
same time, announcements submitted to the repository are automat-
ically disseminated to all portals that query the system. To facilitate the
visualization of announcements, iAnn provides powerful filtering

options and views, integrated in Google Maps and Google Calendar.
All iAnn widgets are freely available.

1 INTRODUCTION

Getting a clear overview of bioinformatics events is not a trivial
task (Schneider et al., 2010). Although several efforts have been
made in this direction (e. g. Schneider et al., 2012), ensuring that
information is accurate and reliable, yet secure from malicious
attack, requires curators to sift carefully through Internet content

to identify and annotate pertinent events. In addition to collect-
ing information from other portals, emitting sources typically
create announcements about their own events. Current methods
for dissemination of events in the life sciences are, however, frag-
mented and uncoordinated: some announcements never reach
parts of their intended target audience, and many spam unin-
tended recipients. Ideally, announcements should reach all po-
tential event participants, without troubling those for whom they
are irrelevant or inappropriate. In practice, however, announce-
ments are typically posted simultaneously to several different
sites in an attempt to reach the widest possible audience. This
process is both time-consuming for those posting the announce-
ments and bombards recipients with duplicate information about
the same event from multiple sites; it also makes it difﬁcult to
change the announcement details (e.g. a deadline extension for
submission of posters), as it is practically impossible to ensure
that updates are propagated to every resource to which the
original announcement was sent. In consequence, recipients
may be misinformed or confused by announcements of the
same event with contradictory dates, speaker changes and
so on, which may ultimately damage the reputation of the
emitting source. A central point that collects data from event
organizers would address many of these problems and provide
a valuable resource for life science event organizers and partici-
pants, course trainers and so on.

2 THE IANN PLATFORM

The iAnn platform provides an integrated coherent solution that
coordinates efforts between announcement-emitting sources,
maximizing dissemination of relevant information in an up-to-
date fashion. iAnn only displays minimal information, such as
title, date and location of an event; the majority of information

Fig. 1. Screenshot taken on 1 May 2013 of an iAnn ﬁlter showing 48
upcoming events at institutions associated with the GOBLET organiza-
tion. iAnn, by default, shows a maximum of 300 world-wide life science
events. Those at GOBLET-associated organizations are shown here inte-
grated in Google Maps (available at http://goo.gl/Lnwa); an event
hosted at The Genome Analysis Centre is clicked, displaying minimal
information and a link to the source

must be gained from the event site itself, which should be accur-
ately maintained by the emitter. iAnn’s philosophy is that an
event should be curated only once. The ﬁltering functionality of
iAnn allows reported events to be tailored to better ﬁt a given
target audience.

To accomplish our philosophy, iAnn provides (i) a common
gateway for entering and annotating announcement information
(the interface to annotate announcements is only accessible to
authorised curators); (ii) a centralized repository of annotated
data; and (iii) a suite of Web services and widgets that can be
embedded in external websites, and display pre—programmed ﬁl-
tered lists of announcements, with no need for manual input
from the external website maintainers. Features like this are al-
ready available in news portals, such as Research Gate (http://
www.researchgate.net/) or Lanyrd (http://lanyrd.com/), includ-
ing the use of submission forms for events and community cur-
ation. Such portals, however, do not provide the richness of
different ﬁltering options, the complete access to all events via
Web services, or the ready-made integration iAnn offers through
Google Maps and Google Calendar. iAnn is thus unique in
that it provides easy integration and access to event data
either through Web services or widgets. These widgets are
speciﬁcally designed to work with some of the most popular
content-management systems, including Drupal, J oomla and
WordPress. The functionality currently provided includes (i) a
list view, showing details of the name of the event, the date and
the institution submitting the event; (ii) a map view, integrated in
Google Maps, displaying all relevant events as clickable pivots
(once choked, the corresponding event information is released, as
illustrated in Fig. 1), with a link to the original event or course
page; and (iii) a calendar view, where iAnn-ﬁltered events can
also be viewed in Google Calendar.

Events are never deleted from the system; widgets by default
hide out-of—date events, although users can disable this ﬁlter and
see all deposited events. By 1 May 2013, the total number of
deposited events in the iAnn registry since the beginning
amounted to 1273. Curation of events follows a two-step process,
with one curator recording the event information and a different
one validating the information entered before making it public to
the registry. A robust monitoring procedure is also in place that
checks potential failures of iAnn services. This is done through a
daemon program that has the capacity to automatically reboot
the service should it go down.

3 IANN COMMUNITY

Announcement data can be posted via the iAnn event-reporting
form (http.'//iann.pro/node/I2) or can be directly emailed to event-
s@iann.pro. Once received, iAnn curators review and annotate
the announcement if the event does not exist in the central re-
pository. Posts are welcomed by any individual or organization
involved in the life sciences. The iAnn project ofﬁcially started in
summer of 2011 and has since garnered strong support. Working
with diverse organizations has given us ﬁrst-hand experience
with community-driven input from the ﬁelds of bioinformatics,
computational biology, biocuration and proteomics. As part of
this community-wide support, we are developing a standard
sharing protocol for announcement exchange. Future versions

of iAnn will thus include an agreed exchange format, an ontol-
ogy and a minimum speciﬁcation for scientiﬁc announcements.

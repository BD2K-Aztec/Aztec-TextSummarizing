ABSTRACT

Summary: A program package to enable genome-wide association
of copy number variants (CNVs) with quantitative phenotypes in
families of arbitrary size and complexity. Intensity signals that act
as proxies for the number of copies are modeled in a variance
component framework and association with traits is assessed
through formal likelihood testing.

Copy number variants (CNVs) have recently attracted increasing
interest as a source of phenotypic variation in humans, with both
rare and common CNVs being associated with different complex
diseases (e.g. Diskin et al., 2009; Walters et al., 2010) and gene
expression levels (Henrichsen et al., 2009). The availability of
high-coverage SNP arrays and the development of methods for
making CNV calls from SNP data are now being exploited to
evaluate genome-wide association with CNVs (e. g. Glessner et al.,
2009). At present, FBAT (Ionita—Laza et al., 2008) is the only other
available algorithm that performs association test of normalized
signal intensity measurement variations, reﬂecting CNVs in family—
based datasets. The family-based association test implemented in
FBAT uses only the within—family variation. Although that is one
of the possible approaches to control for population stratiﬁcation,
disregarding the between-family variation might lead to decreased
statistical power (Aulchenko et al., 2007). famCNV uses information
from both within- and between-family variations, while population
stratiﬁcation issues can be detected and corrected using standard
methods. Although qualitative CNV calls from existing algorithms
can be incorporated as multiallele loci in a family-based association
test, direct testing of the underlying quantitative CNV measurement

has been shown to be more robust in identifying genuine associations
in many cases (McCarroll and Altshuler, 2007; Stranger et al., 2007).
Moreover, quantitative trait designs are less likely to be affected by
differential errors that can arise in case-control studies. We have
implemented a Java program, famCNV, that uses intensity signals
such as the log2 ratio from array comparative genomic hybridization
(aCGH) or the log ratio of observed to expected signal intensity
(LRR) from Illumina genotyping arrays. The quantitative trait of
interest is analysed in a variance component framework to model
the resemblance among relatives and to remove possible bias from
familiality (Abecasis et al., 2000). A linear mixed model is ﬁtted
to data to partition the total phenotypic variance into a polygenic
component 0% determined by additive genetic effects and a residual
variance 082 determined by the unique individual environment,
including measurement errors. The variance covariance matrix 52
for the subjects in each family is $2 =2<I>og +loez, where 2<I> is the
matrix of the expected proportion of alleles that are identical-by-
descent among the family members used to correct for the sample
structure and l is an identity matrix.

Variance component analysis allows simultaneous modeling of
the trait mean as ,u = y +A,B, where y is the trait mean, A is a matrix
of covariate effects and ,8 the corresponding regression coefﬁcients.
The test is evaluated by comparing the likelihood of the full model,
where signal intensities are included in the mean model and the
likelihood of the null model where the effect of the signal intensities
is constrained to zero. Twice the difference between the logarithms
of the full and the null likelihoods asymptotically follows a chi-
square distribution with one degree of freedom and can be used to
evaluate the difference in goodness-of-ﬁt between the two models
(Amos, 1994).

When using data from genotype arrays, the B Allele frequency
(BAF—representing the proportion of the total signal deriving from
the B allele) can also be included in both the full and null models, to
control for misleading differences in an LRR distribution between
genotypes that may have arisen due to errors during the array
normalization process (Peiffer et al., 2006).

The identiﬁed loci, either via the reported P-Value or via meeting
a threshold for the false discovery rate (FDR; Storey and Tibshirani,
2003), are expected to reﬂect probes that are both genuinely copy

number-variable and whose copy number is associated with the
quantitative trait under examination. To evaluate this approach,
we used famCNV to identify CNVs that were associated in cis
with variation in gene expression. We applied our approach to a
cohort of 154 nuclear families, including 732 subjects for which
both genotyping and gene expression data were available (Carlsson
et al., 2009). For all siblings, gene expression levels were measured
in subcutaneous adipose tissue using Affymetrix U133Plus2.0
microarrays and DNA from peripheral blood was genotyped using
the Illumina 610K—Quad array. As quantitative traits, we selected
28 580 transcripts with known position in the genome and 275 348
SNPs for which intensity data were available. For each of these
transcripts, our preliminary analysis focussed on SNP markers lying
within the transcript plus 10 kb upstream and downstream. The
median (ﬁrst—third quartile) number of markers tested per transcript
was 10 (6—21).

Using this dataset, 189 probes were identiﬁed as putative CNV
loci associated with transcript level of the neighbouring gene
(161 different transcripts), at FDR of 10%. We performed an
in—silico experiment to determine whether these regions have
been independently identiﬁed as copy number-variable in other
studies. The probe locations were checked against CNVs and indels
catalogued in the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV, version 9).
We selected from the database CNVs and indels detected through
aCGH and sequencing studies, and determined the number of
our association signals that were included in the DGV-reported
boundaries. Figure 1 shows the results for CNVs identiﬁed by
famCNV at different FDR levels, demonstrating that the proportion
lying within reported CNVs rises with an increasingly stringent
signiﬁcance threshold.

As a second level of validation of the presence of common CNVs
at the predicted loci, we examined the overlap between the CNV
regions identiﬁed by famCNV in the family study and the calls made
by an alternative CNV prediction algorithm, chHap (Coin et al.,
2010), in an independent dataset of Caucasian ancestry. For this,

we used a cohort of 902 adult French subjects genotyped using
the Illumina Human CNV370-du0 array (Meyre et al., 2009). N0
phenotypic data were considered by canap, as this analysis was
aimed solely at conﬁrmation of the presence of common structural
variants.

For this comparison, we ﬁrst limited the CNV calls of canap to
those that spanned at least two SNPs and were present in at least
ﬁve samples. We found that the regions identiﬁed by famCNV at
5% FDR were enriched 6.7-fold (P < 0.01) for probes that intersect
with chHap CNV calls, when compared to the frequency observed
in 100 random datasets of probes not found to show association with
transcript levels by famCNV (FDR>80%). Similarly signiﬁcant
results were obtained after applying a wide range of alternative
CNV-calling criteria to canap.

The package is entirely written in the Java language and is
therefore executable on all supported operating systems. The
variance component algorithm follows the QTDT implementation
(Abecasis et al., 2000). Files can be imported into famCNV in
the PED and MAP ﬁle formats as used by the PLINK package
(Purcell et al., 2007). For analysis of gene expression data, transcript
locations can be provided to allow the restriction of the analyses
within a user-deﬁned window around each transcript. To help
distinguish between putative rare and common CNVs, famCNV also
calculates the Gini coefﬁcient (Gini, 1921) to determine whether
the positive contribution to the ﬁnal chi-square statistics has been
determined by a uniformly distributed effect or by a small number
of strongly associated families.

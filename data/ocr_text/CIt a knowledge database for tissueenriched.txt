ABSTRACT

Motivation: Due to the development of high-throughput
technologies such as microarrays, it has become possible to
determine genome-wide expression changes in a single experiment.
Although much attention has been paid to identify differentially
expressed genes, the functions of tens of thousands of genes in
different species still remain unknown.

Results: C-It is a knowledge database that has its focus on
‘uncharacterized genes’. C-It contains expression profiles of various
tissues from human, mouse, rat, chicken and zebrafish. By
applying our previously introduced algorithm DGSA (Database-
Dependent Gene Selection and Analysis), it is possible to screen
for uncharacterized, tissue-enriched genes in the species mentioned
above. C-It is designed to include further expression studies, which
might provide more comprehensive coverage of gene expression
patterns and tissue-enriched splicing isoforms. We propose that C-It
will be an excellent starting point to study uncharacterized genes.

1 INTRODUCTION

The development of high—throughput technologies such as DNA
microarrays and Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE)
has revolutionized proﬁling of complex transcriptomes, enabling
researchers to determine the transcription level of all known,
unknown or putative genes within one experiment. During the last
years, numerous genome—wide expression studies were performed
to analyze the regulation of genes in different developmental stages,
diseases or tissues. Due to the rapidly decreasing costs of next—
generation sequencing, it is expected that the number of such
expression studies will dramatically increase within the next years.

Differentially expressed genes identiﬁed by these experiments
became a starting point to characterize putative functions,
interactions and biological roles of identiﬁed genes. Recent studies
reveal that the number of genes encoded in higher organism (e.g.
human) is not as high as initially expected; the current number of
protein—coding genes is predicted to be between 20 000 and 25 000

(Collins et al., 2004). Yet, a considerable number of putative genes
is still not characterized (Uchida et al., 2009), which is in part due
to the current mode of data processing. Researchers tend to exclude
genes with unknown annotations from further analysis even if they
show a speciﬁc expression proﬁle suggesting a distinct function
in the process under examination (Pawlowski, 2008). Pawlowski
(2008) assumes that one of the reasons for this bias is caused by the
tendency to focus on certain well—known signaling pathways. Such
a focus facilitates further evaluation and manipulation of processes
under study because of available knowledge and tools. However,
there is no doubt that characterization of unknown genes is needed
to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biology
in a system—wide manner (Ideker et al., 2001; Kitano, 2002).

C—It is a knowledge database focusing on uncharacterized genes
to build a starting point for biologists to study genes with unknown
functions. The database implements literature information from the
PubMed database to identify genes that lack publication records.
Based on the assumption that genes are likely to fulﬁll important
functions when their expression is enriched in a certain tissue,
C—It uses the tissue expression information of UniGene (Wheeler
et al., 2003) expressed sequence tags (EST) proﬁles to identify
tissue—enriched genes. Since evolutionary conservation of gene
expression proﬁles usually indicates important functions of genes
in a speciﬁc tissue, we implemented our algorithm ‘Database—
dependent Gene Selection and Analysis’ (DGSA; Uchida et al.,
2009). This algorithm identiﬁes tissue—enriched genes by using EST
proﬁles in all available tissues of organisms that biologists typically
use for their research [Mus musculus (mouse), Ratms norvegicuis
(rat), Gallus gallus (chicken) and Danio rerio (zebraﬁsh)] as well
as human (Homo sapiens). C—It combines microarray and SAGE
data to give users integrated access to comprehensive transcriptional
proﬁles. Furthermore, C—It is linked with a custom version of
the exon array analyzer (EAA; Gellert et al., 2009) to allow
tissue—enriched alternative splicing analysis.

2 METHODS

2.1 Identiﬁcation of tissue-enriched genes

The UniGene proﬁles from human, mouse, rat, chicken and zebraﬁsh were
downloaded from the NCBI ftp—server (UniGene Build #222, #182, #181,
#42, #117, respectively). To take into account differences in the sampling
depth (the total number of ESTs) of each tissue, the EST counts of each
UniGene cluster were normalized by the total EST count of the tissue to
transcripts per million (TPM) and imported into MySQL tables for displaying
the gene expression across all tissues. Our DGSA algorithm was applied to
these normalized TPM values. In brief, the DGSA deﬁnes a gene as enriched
in a tissue if the tissue is in the top 20% compared with all UniGene tissues.

C-It

 

In other words, the TPM of the tissues of each UniGene cluster were sorted
and the highest 20% tissues were considered as enriched for the cluster.
Additionally, our ‘further rules’ which are part of the DGSA were applied to
all UniGene clusters. The additional rules exclude genes that are ubiquitously
expressed in multiple organs: (i) genes must be expressed in <50% of total
tissues; (ii) sum of gene EST must be <400; and (iii) at least 25% of gene
EST must be expressed in the target tissue. The DGSA is less conservative
than other approaches, for example, the one developed by Audio and Claverie
(1997) identiﬁes tissue—‘speciﬁc’ rather than tissue—‘enriched’ genes. This is
more applicable to C—It because its intention is to provide genes that are
highly expressed in a tissue of interest across several species.

2.2 Homolog gene clusters

To identify homologs across the selected ﬁve organisms, the HomoloGene
database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene, Release 64) from
NCBI was utilized. Because HomoloGene does not include UniGene cluster
IDs, we employed the ‘gene2unigene’ dataset from NCBI to map the clusters
to their corresponding Entrez Gene ID (GI). In the case of ambiguous
mapping from GI to UniGene, C—It uses the rank of the ‘best’ UniGene
cluster. This is, depending on the user—deﬁned search option, the cluster
with the highest or lowest rank (searching for enriched or depleted genes,
respectively).

2.3 Additional expression studies

For microarray data, raw data were downloaded from the BioGPS project
(http://biogps.gnf.org/; Lattin et al., 2008; Su et al., 2002; Walker et al.,
2004) and normalized by RMA provided by the R package ‘affy’ (Gautier
et al., 2004). The SAGE libraries from the Mouse Atlas of Gene Expression
(Siddiqui et al., 2005) were downloaded and normalized to TPM as described
above. SAGE tags were mapped to their corresponding genes by using
SAGEgenie (Boon et al., 2002). To identify tissue—enriched isoforms, C—It
was linked to a custom version of the EAA with datasets from various tissues
downloaded from the Affymetrix web site (http://www.affymetrix.com) and
the BioGPS project (Wu et al., 2009).

2.4 Literature data

To determine the characterization level of a gene, literature information based
on the PubMed database was obtained through the ‘gene2pubmed’ dataset
provided by NCBI. As it has been deﬁned previously (Uchida et al., 2009),
publications that include more than 100 GIs were considered as articles that
report screening results (e. g. microarrays, sequencing) and excluded from the
publication counts. To identify publications that deal with speciﬁc tissues,
datasets for the linkage between the PubMed IDs and a collection of tissue
terms based on the MeSH were downloaded from the MeSH database.

2.5 Implementation

The web server itself runs on Ubuntu 8.04 with an Apache 2 server using
PHP and MySQL. An automated script has been set up to update UniGene
expression proﬁles and literature information every 2 months.

2.6 Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
RT—PCR experiments are described elsewhere (Uchida et al., 2009).

3 RESULTS

Despite major attempts to understand the cellular function of
genes in the heart a large number of heart—enriched genes exist,
for which no speciﬁc function has been assigned (Uchida et al.,
2009). To determine the total number of uncharacterized genes,

we utilized the ‘gene2pubmed’ dataset and found that >26% of the
human protein—coding genes in the NCBI Entrez database have no
publication in PubMed. Another recently published study yielded a
slightly higher number of genes without publication using a similar
approach (Wren, 2009). Reduction of stringency criteria by three
publications per gene increases the proportion of uncharacterized
genes to over 41% (Table 1). In other words: a signiﬁcant number
of all protein—coding genes are only poorly characterized, which
emphasizes the need to develop new tools for further analysis.

Construction of C—It was based on EST expression proﬁles
from the UniGene database, which were used to identify tissue—
enriched genes employing our previously introduced DGSA
(Uchida et al., 2009) to all available tissues. We included the
expression proﬁles of human, mouse and rat as well as the more
distantly related organisms, chicken and zebraﬁsh, into C—It. By
utilizing HomoloGene, C—It displays evolutionary—conserved, tissue—
enriched genes in up to four organisms. Expression patterns of
genes in functionally similar tissues are often conserved between
different organisms, which often indicates that these genes fulﬁll
important biological functions in the respective tissues. Hence,
the identiﬁcation of evolutionary—conserved, tissue—enriched genes
serves as an additional ﬁlter to exclude false positive (i.e. non—
expressed) genes. In addition, C—It provides the possibility to exclude
genes that are expressed in other tissues. This feature can be
used, for example, to ﬁlter genes that are enriched in two similar
tissues.

Literature information from the PubMed database provided a
measure for uncharacterized genes. A gene with no or only few
published articles was deﬁned as ‘uncharacterized’, while we
assume that the function of a gene mentioned in many articles
is known. Of course, this approach cannot rule out that a gene
is mentioned in articles without further investigation or has been
studied under a synonym not listed in NCBI. However, we reason
that this approach usually gives a good estimation of a gene at
the level of characterization. In addition to PubMed, we used the
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) classiﬁcation to identify articles
related to a speciﬁc tissue. This approach allows a user to ﬁlter
for genes that are uncharacterized with respect to the tissue of
interest.

To gain further information on gene expression patterns, large—
scale transcriptomics studies can be added. Furthermore, pre—
calculated exon array data can be viewed to identify tissue—enriched
alternative splicing isoforms. Using this information, it is possible
to obtain a comprehensive overview of the expression patterns of
uncharacterized genes. All data mentioned above were integrated
into C—It for querying by the web interface (see Table 2 for all

proﬁles of ﬁve organisms by using information from the HomoloGene
database to identify homologs; this step allows identiﬁcation of evolutionary—
conserved genes. PubMed articles and MeSH terms were used to classify
uncharacterized genes. Additional expression studies from microarrays,
SAGE and exon arrays were included to build a comprehensive source of
expression analyses.

acquired data sources). A simpliﬁed overview of the database
scheme is shown in Figure 1.

3.1 Web interface

The web interface of C—It enables screening for uncharacterized
genes in various different tissues. A list of uncharacterized, tissue—
enriched and species—conserved genes can be generated in four steps:
ﬁrst, a user must select a tissue of interest from the top page of C—It.
Currently, 78 tissues are available in the UniGene proﬁles of ﬁve
organisms used in this study. Depending on the availability of the
selected tissues in ﬁve organisms, it is possible to choose up to
four organisms for further analysis. This step also requires to set
thresholds for the maximum number of articles published about the
gene. The default settings are less than ﬁve publications and less than

three publications listed in the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
category of the selected tissue.

After all parameters are speciﬁed, C—It generates a Venn diagram
showing the number of uncharacterized, tissue—enriched genes in
user—deﬁned organisms (Fig. 2). The user can deselect previously
chosen organism(s) to deﬁne which overlap of the Venn diagram will
be shown in the list. If no organism is deselected, genes enriched in
all selected organism will be displayed. To gain more evidence about
the tissue enrichment, other transcriptomic data from exon arrays,
microarrays and SAGE data can be added to the list. The ﬁnal list
can be sorted by each column and is linked to expression diagrams
for all ﬁve organisms. These diagrams show all expression proﬁles
of the selected gene for a direct comparison between different tissues
and, if available, across SAGE and microarrays. If a gene maps to
several UniGene clusters, SAGE tags or micorarray probe sets, the
expression of all datasets is shown in the diagrams. In the case of
exon array data, the number of differentially expressed exons, if
any, for the selected gene is linked to a custom version of EAA,
which enables identiﬁcation of tissue—enriched isoforms. For better
handling, the ﬁnal list can be downloaded as a comma—separated
text ﬁle or opened in a new window without surrounding boxes.
The work ﬂow of C—It is schematically shown in Figure 3.

In addition to the above described work ﬂow, C—It can also be
queried by single gene or a set of genes. To quickly obtain the
expression proﬁles of a gene of interest, we implemented an option
to search by G1 or Symbol. C—It displays the number of publications
and all available expression studies of the queried gene and its
homologs, if available. Another possibility is to query C—It for a
set of genes by uploading a list of GIs. C—It uses these genes as
starting point. In the following steps, the list can be ﬁltered for
tissue—enrichment and publication records, similar to the work ﬂow
described above.

3.2 Validation

We previously validated the power of DGSA for heart—enriched
genes (Uchida et al., 2009). In this study, we searched for genes
that are uncharacterized in mouse and enriched in brain or liver
using C—It. The parameters for literature information were set to the
maximum stringency, therefore only genes without any publication
published, both with and without the MeSH ﬁlter, were considered.

RT—PCR analysis of the eight randomly selected genes revealed
strong enrichments in selected tissues compared with 14 other
murine adult tissues (Fig. 4).

3.3 Comparison to other publicly available databases

There are a number of publicly available databases that allow
identiﬁcation of tissue—speciﬁc expression of individual genes. Some
of these databases, such as TiGER (Liu et al., 2008), BodyMap
(Hishiki et al., 2000) and TissueDistributionDBs (Kogenaru et al.,
2009), utilize EST proﬁles, while others such as GeneSpeed
(Kutchma et al., 2007) use micorarray data. These databases use
different approaches to identify the tissue—speciﬁcity or tissue—
enrichment of genes. C—It uses datasets from EST proﬁles, SAGE
libraries and microarrays to eliminate biases arising from different
technologies, thus providing a comprehensive overview of the
transcriptomic data. The currently available databases, e. g FastDB
(de La Grange et al., 2007) and ASTD (Koscielny et al., 2009),
which list alternative splicing isoforms, are mostly based on
sequencing data. In addition, the USCS Genome Browser (Kent

at al., 2002) and the BioGPS project include heatmaps showing
differences in exon array signals across several tissues. However,
these databases do not apply appropriate algorithms to identify
differentially expressed exons; thus, it remains difﬁcult to locate
alternatively spliced transcripts. Our C—It integrates exon array data
calculated by the EAA (Gellert et al., 2009) to identify differentially
expressed exons in a tissue—enriched manner. Furthermore, C—It is
the ﬁrst knowledge database focusing on uncharacterized genes. To
the best of our knowledge, no other database includes literature
information to identify genes without known functions.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we describe the construction of the new knowledge
database C—It, which focuses on genes without known functions.
We employed expression proﬁles of the UniGene database of human,
mouse, rat, chicken and zebraﬁsh and applied our DGSA algorithm
to each proﬁle to identify genes that show tissue enrichment
in various species. Literature information was used to identify
genes that lack assigned functions. We included different types

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The existence of families with many individuals affected
by the same complex disease has long suggested the possibility of
rare alleles of high penetrance. In contrast to Mendelian diseases,
however, linkage studies have identified very few reproducibly linked
loci in diseases such as diabetes and autism. Genome-wide associ-
ation studies have had greater success with such diseases, but these
results explain neither the extreme disease load nor the within-family
linkage peaks, of some large pedigrees. Combining linkage informa-
tion with exome or genome sequencing from large complex disease
pedigrees might finally identify family-specific, high-penetrance
mutations.

Results: Olorin is a tool, which integrates gene flow within families
with next generation sequencing data to enable the analysis of com-
plex disease pedigrees. Users can interactively filter and prioritize
variants based on haplotype sharing across selected individuals and
other measures of importance, including predicted functional conse-
quence and population frequency.

1 INTRODUCTION

Next generation sequencing has rapidly become the standard
approach for identifying mutations responsible for Mendelian
diseases (Bamshad et al., 2011). Although software and file for-
mats for the processing of raw sequence data are relatively robust
(Danecek et al., 2011; Li et al., 2009), there is currently a lack of
easy-to—use software for downstream analysis of these data. For
some study designs, such as focused analysis of fully penetrant
de novo mutations or autosomal recessive inheritance, exome
sequence data can be analysed and filtered relatively simply.
Increasingly, however, sequence-based approaches are being
applied to complex diseases, which are unlikely to follow a
simple genetic model, such as autism (Neale et al., 2012), and
to more complicated scenarios, such as large pedigrees with
incomplete penetrance. These studies require new tools to
enable the diverse community of researchers working on such
families to interactively and comprehensively analyze next gen-
eration sequence data. Figure 1 shows how our new program,
Olorin, integrates within-family linkage analysis with exome
sequencing in a user-friendly package.

2 FEATURES
2.1 File formats

Olorin uses four types of data file: two that provide information
about the gene flow calculated by MERLIN (Abecasis et al.,
2002), one defining the pedigree structure, and a list of variants
identified by sequencing. MERLIN’s haplotyping functionality is
used to compute haplotype inheritance within the pedigree.
Details of the genomic markers used in the estimation of haplo-
types, and pedigree information about the relationships between
individuals and their disease status are read from standard.map
and.ped MERLIN format files. All variants identified from
sequencing across samples need to be provided as a single variant
call format (VCF) file (version 4.0 or greater) (Danecek et al.,
2011).

2.2 Workflow

2.2.1 Selecting individuals On loading data, Olorin automat-
ically generates an interactive pedigree using standard conven-
tions for information such as sex and disease status. Users can

Fig. 1. Olorin uses patterns of gene ﬂow estimated by MERLIN to iden-
tify genomic regions shared by affected individuals in large pedigrees.
This information is combined with next generation sequence data, and
only those variants that lie within shared regions are analysed. Users can
further reﬁne the list of variants using Olorin’s realtime ﬁltering tools

ﬁltering panel, (D) genome-wide segments display, highlighting shared segments in green and (E) the variants table

obtain additional information, such as whether a particular
individual has been sequenced, via a mouseover popup box.
To begin ﬁltering variants, the user ﬁrst needs to select individ-
uals to be used in searching for shared genomic segments by
clicking on them in the pedigree (Fig. 2).

2.2.2 Initial variant ﬁltering After selecting individuals, the
user can customize the analysis via a ﬁltering dialog (Fig. 2).
First, they set the minimum number of individuals required to
share a segment. This enables searches for variants of incomplete
penetrance if the threshold is set below the total number of affected
individuals in the pedigree. Next, the user can select which infor-
mation ﬁelds from the VCF will be included for subsequent ﬁlter-
ing and display. A population frequency cut-off can also be
speciﬁed at this point if (as is often the case) the study design is
focused on variants expected to be rare in healthy individuals.

2.2.3 Dynamic variant ﬁltering Olorin populates an analysis
table (Fig. 2) with variants found in the shared segments. This
table can be sorted on any column, and variants in the table
can be ﬁltered out in real time using a number of ﬁltering
tools (Fig. 2), which are dynamically generated based on the
user-selected data ﬁelds. Olorin can show variants discovered
in any or all of these individuals, depending on the genetic
model under consideration.

2.2.4 Predicted variant eﬂects Because the ‘consequence’
strings in the VCF information ﬁeld contain a wealth of parse-
able information, Olorin supports further processing of two vari-
ant consequence string formats: the UKlOK analysis pipeline
format and the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor format
(McLaren et al., 2010). Because each variant can have multiple
consequences, Olorin automatically selects and displays only the
most damaging effect for each variant, showing the remainder
via a popup box.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

Olorin is written in Java and will work on any platform with
Java 1.6 or later installed. The interactive pedigree is drawn using
the PedVizAPI (Fuchsberger et al., 2008). The genome-wide
sharing plots are generated using source code from the visualiza-
tion tool, IdeogramBrowser (Muller et al., 2007).

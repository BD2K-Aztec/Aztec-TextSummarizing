ABSTRACT

Summary: adephylo is a package for the R software dedicated to the
analysis of comparative evolutionary data. Phylogenetic comparative
methods initially aimed at accounting for or removing the effects
of phylogenetic signal in the analysis of biological traits. However,
recent approaches have shown that considerable information can
be gathered from the study of the phylogenetic signal. In particular,
close examination of phylogenetic structures can unveil interesting
evolutionary patterns. For this purpose, we developed the package
adephylo that provides tools for quantifying and describing the
phylogenetic structures of biological traits. adephylo implements
tests of phylogenetic signal, phylogenetic distances and proximities,
and novel methods for describing further univariate and multivariate
phylogenetic structures. These tools open up new perspectives in
the analysis of evolutionary comparative data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Evolutionary comparative data consists of biological traits observed
in several taxa forming the tips of a phylogenetic tree.
Phylogenetic proximity most often engenders non—independence in
the distribution of traits between closely related taxa, challenging
the assumption of independence among observations required by
classical statistical tools used for modeling relationships between
traits. This phylogenetic autocorrelation, often referred to as
phylogenetic signal, has initially been perceived as a source of
nuisance in the analysis of life histories (Harvey and Page],
1991). Consequently, phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs)
ﬁrst focused on partialling out the effects of phylogenetic signal in
the correlative analysis of biological traits (e.g. Felsenstein, 1985;
Grafen, 1989; Rohlf, 2006). However, precious information can be

gained from studying the phylogenetic signal, e.g. for identifying
different selective regimes (Butler and King, 2004; Hansen, 1997;
Hansen et al., 2008), detecting shifts in correlation patterns on a
phylogeny (Revell and Collar, 2009) or inferring changes in rates of
evolution (O’Meara et al., 2006). Moreover, phylogenetic signal can
also indicate interesting evolutionary processes such as divergence
of life histories, trade—offs or niche conservatism (Jombart et al.,
2010). The R package adephylo aims to complement existing PCMs
by implementing tools for describing the phylogenetic signal and
uncovering phylogenetic patterns from evolutionary comparative
data.

2 FUNCTIONALITIES

This package extends and replaces implementation of phylogeny—
related methods in ade4 (Dray and Dufour, 2007), a package
dedicated to multivariate analysis. As an R package (R Development
Core Team, 2009), adephylo beneﬁts from an incomparable
diversity of statistical and computational tools, along with
speciﬁc packages devoted to phylogenetics (see http://cran.r—
project.org/web/Views/Phylogenetics.html). In particular, the ape
package (Paradis, 2006; Paradis et al., 2004) implements a wide
array of tools including tree reconstruction, graphics, trait simulation
and modeling of phylogenetic data, whereas the phylobase package
(Bolker et al., 2010) has been developed for handling, plotting and
manipulating phylogenetic comparative data.

To maximize data interoperability, adephylo uses objects both
from ape and phylobase. Phylogenies can be reconstructed or read
in from Newick format in ape, and data can be matched with tips,
nodes or even edges using phylobase. adephylo implements different
tools for Visualizing, testing and describing the phylogenetic signal
in multivariate datasets. The function table .phylo4d offers
various options for plotting phylogenies and traits (Fig. 1), allowing
for a direct Visual assessment of phylogenetic structures. The
package proposes four different metrics of phylogenetic dependency
including the one underlying Abouheif’s test (Abouheif, 1999),
which seems particularly efﬁcient for detecting phylogenetic signal
(Pavoine et al., 2008). These metrics allow integrating phylogenetic
information in tests of phylogenetic autocorrelation (Abouheif,
1999; Gittleman and Kot, 1990) or autoregressive models (Cheverud
and Dow, 1985). As they require intensive computations, these
metrics have been implemented using compiled C code: this permits
to compute phylogenetic dependencies between all pairs of tips even

Fig. 1. Analysis of the maples data (dataset maples). This ﬁgure shows
the phylogenetic tree along with the four traits identiﬁed as phylogenetically
structured (Inﬂ, Bif, Dom and HTTL.P) and the ﬁrst global principal
component of the pPCA of the data based on Abouheif’s metric (PCl). All
variables are centerd and scaled. Positive and negative values are represented
using black and white symbols, respectively, with a size proportional to the
absolute value. See Appendix A (Supplementary Material) for details of the
analysis.

in large phylogenies (i.e. including thousands of tips). These metrics
can be used to code the phylogenetic structure either under the form
of a matrix of distances (distTips), proximities (proxTips)
or as orthonormal bases (orthobasis .phylo). These different
representations of phylogenetic information give rise to a diversity
of methods for the analysis of phylogenetic comparative data.

Phylogenetic proximities are used in the Abouheif’s test
(Abouheif, 1999; Pavoine et al., 2008), which provides a non—
parametric procedure for detecting phylogenetic signal. Abouheif’s
test is implemented by the function abouheif .moran, which
performs independent Monte Carlo tests for each trait of the analyzed
dataset. This approach can be used together with other classical tests
of phylogenetic signal such as Pagel’s k (Freckleton et al., 2002;
Page], 1999) and Blomberg’s K (Blomberg et al., 2003), the latter
being implemented in the R package picante (Kembel et al., 2010).

As a complement to testing procedures, adephylo implements
tools for describing phylogenetic structures. The decomposition
of a quantitative trait onto an orthonormal basis describing the
topology of the tree (Ollier et al., 2005) is implemented by
the function orthogram. This approach proposes a series of
statistical tests as well as a visual description of the phylogenetic
signal, allowing to infer where phylogenetic dependence occurs
in the tree. The function orthobasis .phylo extends this
approach by proposing new orthonormal bases based on different
phylogenetic metrics; therefore, allowing considerable ﬂexibility in
the description of phylogenetic relationships.

Lastly, adephylo also implements the phylogenetic principal
component analysis (pPCA; J ombart et al., 2010), a novel method
for investigating phylogenetic structures in multivariate comparative
data. The function ppca performs the analysis, while other
procedures (summary, plot, screeplot and scatter) allow
for extracting useful information and plotting results of a pPCA.

adephylo is distributed with a tutorial and nine published
datasets that are used to illustrate speciﬁc methodological points. In
Appendix A (Supplementary Material), we illustrate some features of
adephylo using the maples data published in Ackerly and Donoghue
(1998). We ﬁrst test for the presence of phylogenetic signal in
the data using the function abouhei f . moran, revealing four
phylogenetically structured traits (Fig. 1). Using pPCA, we unveil a
phylogenetic pattern opposing taxa from either side of node 1, which
is remarkably similar to the four traits identiﬁed as phylogenetically
structured, and points to the likely ancient divergence in life histories
of the species considered (Fig. 1).

3 CONCLUSION

The adephylo package provides tools for a new approach of
evolutionary comparative data, which complements usual PCM by
quantifying, testing and describing the phylogenetic signal. Being
embedded in the R environment, adephylo beneﬁts from the access
to a wide range of computational, statistical and graphical tools
along with very complete packages devoted to phylogenetics, freely
available to the scientiﬁc community. The advantages of such an
integrative approach have already been acknowledged (e. g. Holland,
2007), and we hope this new package will contribute to building a
unifying platform for the analysis of biological data within the R
software.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: To understand the molecular mechanisms of neurons, it is
imperative to identify genomic dissimilarities within the heterogeneity
of the neural system. This is especially true for neuronal disorders in
which spatial considerations are of critical nature. For this purpose,
Hirudo medicine/is provides here an ideal system in which we are able
to follow gene expression along the central nervous system, to affiliate
location with gene behavior.

Results: In all, 221.1 million high-quality short reads were sequenced
on the Illumina Hiseq2000 platform at the single ganglion level.
Thereafter, a de novo assembly was performed using two state-
of-the—art assemblers, Trinity and Trans-ABySS, to reconstruct a
comprehensive de novo transcriptome. Classification of Trinity and
Trans-ABySS transcripts produced a non-redundant set of 76 845
and 268 355 transcripts (>200 bp), respectively. Remarkably, using
Trinity, 82% of the published medicinal leech messenger RNAs was
identified. For the innexin family, all of the 21 recently reported genes
were identified. Spatial regulation analysis across three ganglia
throughout the entire central nervous system revealed distinct patterns
of gene expression. These transcriptome data were combined with
expression distribution to produce a spatio-transcripto map along
the ganglia chain. This study provides a resource for gene discovery
and gene regulation in future studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Following the complete set of transcripts is elemental for un-
covering novel molecular components, and for studying physio-
logical and pathological conditions. Next-generation sequencing
technologies provide cost-effective means for quantifying the
transcriptome. Recent technological advances have revolutio-
nized the ﬁeld, making it possible to analyze the transcriptome of
selected sets of cells within an organism, leading to the collection
of data at a high spatial-transcriptomic resolution. Exploring
gene expression profiles quantitatively in combination with the
cellular physical distribution in an intact model may provide
the link between genomic information, contextual function and
behavior. In the brain, associating gene regulation of collections
of neurons within their spatial organization and role is of special
importance to the study of health and disease. Particularly

it is important in neurodegenerative diseases where loss of func-
tion is highly correlated with abnormalities in form (Gaggelli
et al., 2006; Kanaan et al., 2012; Seixas et al., 2012).

To perform such mapping, the nervous system of the medi-
cinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis was selected. This system, a favor-
able model for investigating development, regeneration and
repair, provides a useful model due to its simple structure and
distinct behaviors (Coggeshall and Fawcett, 1964). The central
nervous system (CNS) of the leech consists of a chain of ganglia
that has been characterized anatomically and physiologically,
and presents high similarity between ganglia (Coggeshall and
Fawcett, 1964). Each such ganglion contains 400 neurons,
most with known function and connections (Macagno, 1980;
Meriaux et al., 2011). Previous gene expression studies on leech
CNS have resulted in the characterization of specific genes
(Harvey et al., 1986; Wysocka—Diller et al., 1989). Attempts
have been made to clone genes of interest via the candidate
gene approach (Blackshaw et al., 2004; Vergote et al., 2004,
2006). Recently, an expression sequence tag database was con-
structed and is now available to the scientific community
(Macagno et al., 2010). Yet, functional genomic studies in the
Hmedicinalis are in their infancy (Kandarian et al., 2012;
Macagno et al., 2010).

Recent approaches in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis
accommodate low amounts of total RNA, multiple condition
comparisons and overcome the de novo assembly challenge
(Birol et al., 2009; Grabherr et al., 2011; Robertson et al.,
2010; Sadamoto et al., 2012; Simpson et al., 2009; Vijay et al.,
2013; Zhao et al., 2011). Here, an RNA-seq method is used to
study transcription along the leech CNS. The transcriptome of
three ganglia is examined: close to the head, mid-body and close
to the tail. This choice of three representative ganglia enables
querying of gene expression profiles and linking gene expression
with CNS spatial organization, at the single ganglion level. The
choice of three biologically distinct conditions and not the
common two-condition differential analysis (Leng et al., 2013)
adds a level of complexity, enabling the identification of latent
patterns of expression.

In the current study, a transcriptome of the adult leech
Hmedicinalis CNS was produced. A non-redundant set of
transcripts has been identified and analyzed in various forms,
including gene—isoform relationships, functional relationships,
full-length analysis and gene ontology. To verify the full-length
analysis and coverage level, the innexin family, which has been
previously studied in the leech, was tested (Hmedicinalis and
Hirudo Verbcma) (Anava et al., 2009; Dykes and Macagno,
2006; Dykes et al., 2004; Kandarian et al., 2012; Phelan, 2005;

Gene function in the ganglia chain

 

Yen and Saier, 2007). A differential expression analysis over the
three spatially distinct regions has been used to identify patterns
of gene expression. The gene expression proﬁles were character-
ized and classiﬁed into nine major patterns, demonstrating dom-
inant expression distributions along the ganglia chain.

In the present study, advantage is taken of a simple model, the
leech CNS, together with a novel differential expression
approach, to combine the transcriptome with the spatial conﬁg-
uration, thus, producing a spatio-transcripto map of the CNS.
Resultant data provide a highly useful functional and genomic
resource for future systemic studies. Moreover, the strategy for
transcriptome analysis presented here may be helpful in other
similar transcriptome studies.

2 METHODS

2.1 Leech RNA

As described in the Workﬂow (Supplementary Fig. S1), RNA has
been extracted from three adult medicinal leeches (Supplementary
Fig. S2). All were obtained from a Hmedicinalis colony grown in
France at Ricarimpex Farm. Leeches are maintained in our animal
facility in tanks populated with about 20 leeches in a controlled en-
vironment, at 16°C and 12 h/12h day/night cycle. Before use, leeches
were placed on ice for 30 min and then dissected dorsally. Three
ganglia were harvested from each leech (numbers 2, 10 and 19)
(Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2). For technical replicas, ganglion
number 10 was harvested from three additional leeches, pooled
together for RNA isolation and separated into three samples for
RNA-seq.

2.2 RNA isolation and quality control

Total RNA was extracted from each ganglion using RNeasy Lipid Tissue
(Qiagen). The quality and quantity of each RNA sample was assessed by
Agilent’s 100 Bioanalyzer pico chip. RNA samples contained a concen-
tration of 45—170pg/M1.

2.3 RNA ampliﬁcation

RNA has been ampliﬁed using Ovation Kit v2.0 (NuGEN). Before amp-
liﬁcation, all samples were lyophilized using a SpeedVac instrument and
then suspended in 5 11.1 of nuclease-free water.

2.4 Illumina sequencing and quality control

Complementary DNAs (cDNAs) were quantiﬁed using Nanodrop and
Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 Chip (Supplementary Table S1). Two micro-
grams (in 100 11.1) of cDNAs were fragmented using Bioruptor instrument
with three 10 s (‘on’) cycles of sonication interrupted by 90 s pauses (‘off).
The library preparation proceeded with the ‘END-REPAIR’ reaction
from the NEB kit (NEBNext) and then with TruSeq DNA/ RNA library
preparation. cDNA libraries were loaded on a high-sensitivity chip and
quantiﬁed on the QuBIT instrument (Supplementary Table S2), to pre-
pare the two 6-plex pools that were separated into two pools
(Supplementary Fig. S2). The two pools were quantiﬁed (molarity) on
Bioanalyzer with the High Sensitivity DNA kit and diluted. The cDNA
libraries were generated using messenger RNA-seq (mRNA-seq) assay
for transcriptome sequencing on Illumina Hiseq2000. Three cDNA
libraries were generated from the total RNA of ganglion number 19
and three cDNA libraries were generated from the pooled total RNA
of ganglion 10 in equal amounts, and sequencing was performed in one
lane to generate 50 bp single end (SE) reads. A similar procedure was
carried out for ganglia numbers 2 and 19. Library construction and

sequencing was performed by a commercial service provider (IGA,
Applied Genomics Institute). The sequenced data generated in this
study were deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (record GSE45569
or in Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accession number SRR799260—71).

2.5 De novo assembly

Various programs for de novo assembly of the 50 bp SE sequence reads
were tested to generate a non-redundant set of transcripts/transcripts.
Among the various programs available, the publicly available program
Trinity (version trinityrnaseq_r2012-03-17) (Grabherr et al., 2011) was
used. Trinity has been developed for assembly of short reads using de
Bruijn graph algorithm by single k-mer. Trinity was executed in the inch-
worm method and default assembly parameters were used. The publicly
available program, Trans-ABySS (version 1.3.2) (Robertson et al., 2010),
which has been developed for assembly of short reads using de Bruijn
graph algorithm by multiple k-mer, was used as well. It has been sug-
gested (Robertson et al., 2010) to use the assembly of ABySS (version
1.3.2) (Ning Leng et al., 2012) followed by Trans-ABySS. Assembly of
transcripts generated by ABySS into transcripts using Trans-ABySS with
default parameters for SE sequence reads and k-mer values of (25—50)
was performed.

2.6 Mapping reads and estimating counts

The Bowtie algorithm (Version 0.12.7) (Langmead et al., 2009) was used
to map short reads to the reconstructed transcriptome. After mapping
read counts were estimated by two state-of—the-art tools. First, RNA-Seq
by Expectation-Maximization (RSEM) (Version 1.1.21) (Li and Dewey,
2011), and then, as recommended by the Cufﬂinks pipeline (Version
2.0.2) (Roberts et al., 2011; Trapnell et al., 2010; Trapnell et al., 2012),
Tophat (Version 2.0.4) (Langmead et al., 2009; Trapnell et al., 2009) for
splice junction mapping, followed by estimating read counts using cuff-
links. To obtain a reasonably sized set of transcripts, a smaller set was
deﬁned by ﬁltering out transcripts estimated by RSEM with mean counts
of <3 and >5000 across all samples. This range based on the x—y correl-
ation as presented in the scatter plots (Supplementary Fig. S3) has led to
~20 % of ﬁltered out transcripts. Those transcripts were irregular, such as
ribosomal RNAs or polymerase chain reaction duplicates, products of
ampliﬁcation.

2.7 Full-length and coverage analysis

Identifying whether reconstructed transcripts are full-length is notori-
ously difﬁcult. For de novo assembly, the task is even harder, as there
is no reference to work with. Usually for de novo assembly, the alternative
for organism transcripts is a close organism transcript. This was accom-
plished here in a few steps. First, published genes were examined and then
innexin genes were analyzed as a well-studied family in the leech
(Kandarian et al., 2012). Blast results of Trinity and Trans-ABySS assem-
blies were used to detect innexin genes in our reconstructed assemblies.
Innexins with an E—value cutoff set to €_10 were chosen ﬁrst, after which,
for maximizing conﬁdence, only the innexin genes with an E—value of 0.0
were chosen, ﬁltered for a perfect match, otherwise the innexins may be
aligned to >1 transcript (innexins show high levels of similarity among
themselves). For further analysis, only innexin genes that both Trinity
and Trans-ABySS reconstructed were used. For the coverage analysis, the
same innexin genes reconstructed by both Trinity and Trans-ABySS were
used and then Bowtie was used for mapping the raw reads to the innexins.

2.8 Gene—isoform relationship

De novo assembled transcriptomes present a unique challenge in obtain-
ing an accurate gene—isoform relationship. Therefore, the RSEM (Li and
Dewey, 2011) tool ‘rsem-generate-ngvector’ was used to cluster isoforms
based on measures directly relating to read mapping ambiguity. This tool

ﬁrst calculates the ‘unmappability’ of each transcript—the ratio between
the number of k-mers with at least one perfect match to other transcripts
and the total number of k-mers of this transcript where k is a parameter.
Then, an Ng vector is generated by applying a K-means algorithm to the
‘unmappability’ values with the number of clusters set to 3. This ensures
that the mean ‘unmappability’ scores for clusters are in ascending order.
All transcripts with lengths <k are assigned to cluster 3.

2.9 Functional relationships and gene ontology

To establish functional and evolutionary relationships, BLASTX (version
2.2.23) was used to identify sequence conservation. Both Trinity and
Trans-ABySS assemblies were run against Swiss-Prot and non-redundant
databases downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI). Best hits were used as DAVID (Jiao et al., 2012)
input for detecting enriched gene ontology for the assemblies. Results of
the single best hit were extracted and hits with an E—value of €_10 were
considered signiﬁcant.

2.10 Differential expression

Two approaches were implemented to determine the differential expres-
sion of the transcripts. Initially, EBSeq (Version 1.1.3) (Leng et al., 2013),
which uses an empirical Bayesian approach to accommodate multiple
condition comparisons was used. EBSeq uses RSEM counts as input
with upper quartile normalization. EBSeq classiﬁed transcripts into ﬁve
patterns with a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.05 (Fig. 2C).
Each pattern was further divided into sub patterns by changing 75 to Z
and < symbols to achieve a more accurate representation of EBSeq pat-
terns (Fig. 2D). Next, EBSeq patterns were divided into three groups by a
simple condition: all transcripts in the same state of expression in the ﬁrst
two ganglia were deﬁned in the same group (Fig. 3). In addition, Cuffdiff
(Version 2.0.2) (Trapnell et al., 2012) was used with upper quartile nor-
malization and with an FDR threshold of 0.05. Cuffdiff uses Cufﬂinks
counts as input for the beta negative binomial approach. Unlike EBSeq,
Cuffdiff sorts out only two conditions at a time.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Sequencing and quality control

An amount of 221 138 673 sequence reads were generated, each
50 bp in length, encompassing roughly 11 giga bases
(Supplementary Table S3). The expression levels of the technical
replicates, estimated by RSEM, showed a strong Pearson correl-
ation (r: ~0.9) (Supplementary Fig. S3). All samples passed
FastQC basic statistics for quality estimation, per base sequence
quality, per sequence quality score and length distribution.

3.2 De novo transcriptome assembly

The de novo assembly of the Hmedicinalis CNS transcriptome
was reconstructed by various assembly programs. As described
in Section 2, assembly was performed ﬁrst using Trinity, which
generated 76 845 non-redundant transcripts/contigs (>200 bp in
length). From the transcripts obtained by Trinity assembly, a set
of 22 969 transcripts presented signiﬁcant alignment scores to the
Swiss-Prot database and a set of 26 800 transcripts produced
signiﬁcant alignment to the NCBI non-redundant database.
The procedure for the Trans-ABySS assembly was also followed,
resulting in a total number of 268 355 non-redundant transcripts/
transcripts (>200 bp in length). From the 268 355 transcripts, a
set of 85 833 transcripts produced signiﬁcant alignment to the

Swiss-Prot database and a set of 100 601 transcripts produced
signiﬁcant alignment to the NCBI non-redundant database.
Using BLASTN, Trinity was found to have identiﬁed 86 of
104 (82%) reported mRNAs, whereas Trans-ABySS identiﬁed
82 (78%). The N50, median, average length, total length of tran-
scriptome and GC content for transcripts generated by Trinity
was 2188, 550, 1124, 86 436 165 bp, 41.60%, whereas those gen-
erated by Trans-ABySS was 1140 , 535 , 809, 217129658 bp,
42.24% (Supplementary Table S4). The same tests have been
performed for Helobdella robusta and Capitella teleta, as
described in Supplementary Table S4. Estimating mapping rate
of the assemblies using Bowtie revealed that ~50% of the reads
with at least one reported alignment for Trinity assembly and
~30% for Trans-ABySS assembly (Supplementary Table S5).

3.3 Gene—isoform relationship

Using RSEM over Trinity output isoforms showed that most
transcripts had 1 isoform, 3 isoforms and 2 isoforms (50 548,
21273, 5024, respectively), and Trans-ABySS showed that most
transcripts had 3 isoforms, 1 isoform and 2 isoforms (212543,
29 226, 26 586, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. S4).

3.4 Contribution of speciﬁc samples to the analysis

By estimating the percentile of transcripts expressed in each
sample (Supplementary Fig. S5), we found that according to

the Trinity assembly, the highest number of the transcripts ex-
pressed across all samples was in sample number 5, which is
ganglion number 10. According to the Tran-ABySS assembly,
this was sample number 12, which is also ganglion number 10.
The lowest number of transcripts came from sample 1, which is
ganglion number 2 for both the Trinity and Trans-ABySS assem-
blies. Other samples had similar quantities between assemblies.

3.5 Full-length and coverage analysis

For both Trinity and Trans-ABySS assemblies, 21 different
innexin genes were found, as reported previously (Kandarian
et al., 2012). With an E—value cutoff of 0.0 (see Section 2), 13
innexin genes were found for Trinity assembly as well as for
Trans-ABySS assembly, four of which were found to be highly
similar, whereas the other nine presented various lengths in dif-
ferent assemblies. Trinity assembled longer transcripts compared
with Trans-ABySS in eight of the nine cases (Supplementary Fig.
S6). In addition to full-length analysis, coverage of those 13
innexin genes was also tested and found without preferences to
either 5’ or 3’, as could be expected (Supplementary Fig. S7).

3.6 Pattern distribution

After ﬁltering out, transcripts of <3 and >5000 mean counts
across all samples, 63 077 transcripts were examined for spatial
distribution using EBSeq. EBSeq classiﬁed Trinity transcripts

Fig. 3. Deﬁnition of sub groups from EBSeq patterns. Each of the matrix elements represents one sub group of the nine that have been classiﬁed from
EBSeq patterns. Each of these nine elements contains three circles that represent three ganglia. The left circle is ganglion number 2 (blue), the middle
circle is ganglion number 10 (orange) and the right is ganglion number 19 (green). EBSeq patterns can be categorized into sub patterns and then divided
into three groups (G1, G2, G3) and nine sub groups (‘.1’, ‘.2’, ‘.3’) as described in Section 2. G1.1 is an example of equal expression between the three
ganglia. G2.3 is an example of downregulation between the three ganglia from left to right. G3.3 is an example of upregulation between the three ganglia

from left to right

into ﬁve patterns, each of which contained a different number of
transcripts as shown in Figure 2A. Transcripts were then ﬁltered
out by setting an FDR of 0.05, which resulted in less transcripts
per pattern (Fig. 2B) and correlated transcripts in each pattern to
the BLASTX results. A list of genes expressed within each pat-
tern was found. DAVID analyses showed that many genes iden-
tiﬁed by EBSeq were involved in neuron projection, nervous
system regulation, neurogenesis regulation, neural differenti-
ation, developmental processes and metabolism. Once the
groups were deﬁned (as described in Section 2) and each of the
sub groups counted, dominant sub groups were identiﬁed as
described in Figure 4 (G1.1, G22, G31). By examining this hy-
pothesis using a X2 goodness-of—ﬁt test, the data were found
in consistent with random distribution (Supplementary
Fig. S8A—C). Furthermore, all possible pairings between the
leeches were examined (leech number 1 versus 2, 2 versus
3 and 1 versus 3), and the same dominant behavior of sub
groups was observed (Supplementary Fig. S9A—C). In addition,
using a X2 test for independence, a dependency was observed
between the states (equal/unequal expression) of the transcripts
in ganglion 2 and 10 and those of the transcripts in ganglion 10
and 19 (X2: 1851.208, degrees of freedom (df): 1, P<2.2e-16)
(Supplementary Fig. S8D). To further establish the statistical
signiﬁcance of the abundance of the identiﬁed spatial gene pat-
terns between the nine samples, 30 retagged locations out of the
original data were produced (Supplementary Table S7). The
identiﬁed patterns in the shufﬂed patterning were reevaluated.

Results from this analysis provide further validation to the stat-
istical tests used to establish the patterns. When Cuffdiff results
were classiﬁed to identify the EBSeq pattern with a contig match,
perfect matches were found (Supplementary Table S8).

4 DISCUSSION

Along with the rapid advances in sequencing technologies, a set
of bioinformatics tools has recently been developed for short-
read sequence data assembly (Birol et al., 2009; Grabherr
et al., 2011) and analysis (Leng et al., 2013; Sadamoto et al.,
2012; Trapnell et al., 2012). De n0v0 assembly of short reads
without a known reference genome is considered non-standard
and non-trivial, but still attracts enough attention to provide the
community with an adequate set of tools (Duan et al., 2012;
Robertson et al., 2010; Sadamoto et al., 2012; Vijay et al.,
2013; Zhao et al., 2011). Whole-transcriptome sequencing pro-
vides a functional genomic view of the studied tissue. Recent
developments in high-throughput technologies have provided a
plethora of molecular data, but a thorough account of RNA
expression levels in the Hmedicinalis is still lacking.

In this study, a de novo assembly of transcriptome is produced
using short reads from non-model annelids, the Hmedicinalis,
for which public sequence data are still limited. The production
of a veriﬁed transcriptome is used here as a tool to study the
CNS of Hmedicinalis. H .medicinalis is one of the most important
annelids and as such a valuable model for studying nervous
system structure, function, development, regeneration and
repair. More than 221 million sequence reads were generated
for Hmedicinalis.

Validation of the different assembly tools signiﬁcantly affects
the assembly output and is needed for optimal results. Trinity
and Trans-ABySS have been used for the reconstruction of the
Hmedicinalis transcriptome. More reported mRNAs of
Hmedicinalis have been identiﬁed using Trinity. Moreover,
examination of full-length transcripts reveals that Trinity recon-
structed fuller transcripts for the innexin family, making Trinity
transcripts the choice for downstream analyses. Furthermore, we
found that the N50, median and average lengths of the tran-
scripts generated using Trinity were longer (Grabherr et al.,
2011; Mende et al., 2012) and with higher similarity to related
organisms as shown in Supplementary Table S4 (a comparison
with Trans-ABySS) (Macagno et al., 2010).

A non-redundant set of 76845 transcripts is reported. The
gene—isoform relationship of the Hmedicinalis transcripts
shows that the largest fraction of transcripts presents a single
isoform. About 30% of the transcripts show signiﬁcant hom-
ology with Swiss-Prot sequences. Comparison with other
openly available leech datasets, the transcriptome of H.r0busta,
shows a 39% identity at the amino acid level (Supplementary
Table S6). Interestingly, a comparison with Capitella capitata
(a polychaete) shows similar high levels of amino acid identity
(34%) (Supplementary Table S6). The unannotated transcripts
(Chopin et al., 2000; Frobius and Seaver, 2006; Murray et al.,
2004; Salzet et al., 2000; Tahtouh et al., 2009; Tasiemski et al.,
2004) might indicate novel, and possibly, species-speciﬁc func-
tions. Perhaps most importantly, the expression pattern distribu-
tion in the leech nervous system presents a signiﬁcantly larger
class of transcripts that are co-expressed along the leech’s spatial

conﬁguration. Other patterns are much smaller and do not
co-express, but rather dominate speciﬁc expression patterns
along the nervous system. This may indicate that (i) most of
the transcripts tend to be located in the ganglia butare not gan-
glion speciﬁc. For example, HSP90 belongs to the previously
described ‘pattern 1’, which supports our classiﬁcation patterns,
and (ii) within each group there is a sub group more dominant,
which may suggest that spatial regulation dominates gene func-
tion in the ganglia chain.

In conclusion, the speciﬁc genes and their spatial templates of
expression across the CNS of a whole organism provide the
community, for the ﬁrst time, a functional afﬁliation between
genomic and nerve loci.

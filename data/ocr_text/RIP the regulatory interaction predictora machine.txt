ABSTRACT

Motivation: Understanding transcriptional gene regulation is
essential for studying cellular systems. Identifying genome-wide
targets of transcription factors (T Fs) provides the basis to discover
the involvement of TFs and TF cooperativeness in cellular systems
and pathogenesis.

Results: We present the regulatory interaction predictor (RIP),
a machine learning approach that inferred 73 923 regulatory
interactions (Rls) for 301 human TFs and 11 263 target genes with
considerably good quality and 4516 Rls with very high quality.
The inference of Rls is independent of any specific condition. Our
approach employs support vector machines (SVMs) trained on a set
of experimentally proven Rls from a public repository (T RANSFAC).
Features of Rls for the learning process are based on a correlation
meta-analysis of 4064 gene expression profiles from 76 studies,
in silico predictions of transcription factor binding sites (T F888) and
combinations of these employing knowledge about co-regulation of
genes by a common TF (TF-module). The trained SVMs were applied
to infer new Rls for a large set of TFs and genes. In a case study,
we employed the inferred Rls to analyze an independent microarray
dataset. We identified key TFs regulating the transcriptional response
upon interferon alpha stimulation of monocytes, most prominently
interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). Furthermore, predicted
TF-modules were highly associated to their functionally related
pathways.

Conclusion: Descriptors of gene expression, TFBS predictions,
experimentally verified binding information and statistical
combination of this enabled inferring Rls on a genome-wide
scale for human genes with considerably good precision serving as
a good basis for expression profiling studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Human gene regulation involves numerous mechanisms comprising
protein—protein interaction, DNA binding and transcription,
epigenetic DNA modiﬁcations, RNA interference and translation.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Central to this is the speciﬁc binding of transcription factors
(TFs) to promoters of genes to regulate their transcription, and
the discovery of such regulatory interactions (RIs) to reconstruct
large—scale regulatory networks is a main focus of systems
biology research. So far, several hundreds of TFs have been
identiﬁed for many species (Matys et al., 2006). Some TFs bind
exclusively to distinct DNA sequence motifs at speciﬁc conditions,
whereas others are ubiquitously active (Farnham, 2009). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have been used to infer TF
binding to the promoter of the investigated gene. This was scaled
up by ChIP—on—chip technology to obtain the location of speciﬁc TF
binding genome wide. However, results from such investigations
strongly depend on the studied cellular system and treatment.
Besides this, computational methods were developed and applied
to predict transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) independent
from the samples under study (Stormo, 2000; Valen et al., 2009).
These predictions were mainly based on motif searches with position
weight matrices (PWMs). PWMs are probabilistic representations
of a frequency distribution of nucleotides at each position of a
binding site. In contrast to ChIP—on—chip assays, genome—wide PWM
searches detect potential TFBSs for any TF (for which a PWM
has been assembled from experimentally discovered binding sites)
independent of conditional restrictions and thus provide information
about TFBSs in an unbiased manner. Predictions with PWMs have
been effectively applied to identify the relevant TFs and their sets
of regulated genes in gene expression data (Segal et al., 2003a;
Sinha, 2006). However, TFBS predictions are rather unspeciﬁc and
therefore come along with high false positive rates (Stormo, 2000).

Several methods have been developed to construct large—scale
regulatory networks using gene expression data, genome—wide ChIP
proﬁles, PWM—scans and a combination of these (Bonneau, 2008).
The availability of abundant experimental data for various model
organisms enabled to infer regulatory networks for microorganisms
explaining and predicting gene expression, e. g. for Escherichia coli
(Faith 61 al., 2007), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Bar—Joseph et al.,
2003; J oshi et al., 2009; Segal et al., 2003b) and the Halobacterium
NRC—I (Bonneau et al., 2006). Furthermore, methods were designed
to infer signiﬁcant RIs between TFs and genes using Pearson’s
correlation and mutual information of gene expression, e. g. the
Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks
(ARACNE; Margolin et al., 2006) and the Context Likelihood of
Relatedness (CLR; Faith et al., 2007). ARACNE and CLR were
jointly applied to identify target genes for Nrf2 (nuclear factor

erythroid 2—related factor) in the lung of mice in response to
oxidative stress (Taylor et al., 2008). Recently, the third Dialogue
on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM3)
compendium has set up a synthetic data compendium to benchmark
several methods inferring RIs. The top ﬁve performing algorithms
integrated both the provided steady—state (unperturbed, knockdown
and knockout) and time—series data (multifactorial perturbations).
The performance of the best method apparently depended mainly
on predictions reconstructed from steady—state levels of the gene
knockout datasets (Marbach et al., 2010) and prediction algorithms
for steady—state conditions are mainly required for predicting
regulation in tumor samples. A modiﬁed version of CLR was
among the top ﬁve performers and its optimal performance was
achieved when using comprehensive knock—out data alone (Madar
et al., 2010). The compendium data resembled small subnets
of E.coli and yeast and provides synthetic transcriptional data.
However, the data—like many of the prediction methods—neglect
post—transcriptional regulation of TFs. Besides this, the underlying
presumption that expression of the target genes depends mainly
on the mRNA gradients of their regulating TFs is often violated,
speciﬁcally in higher eukaryotes. In turn, regulation of TFs on the
protein level plays a substantial role, e. g. for hypoxia—inducible
factors (HIFs; Kaelin et al., 2002), p53 (Harris and Levine, 2005)
and retinoblastoma 1 (RBI; Chen et al., 2009). Additionally, some
prediction algorithms are tailored to infer condition—speciﬁc RIs for
a single or a few TFs rather than predicting RIs for numerous TFs
and a wide range of cellular systems and conditions.

To address these limitations, we developed the regulatory
interaction predictor (RIP), a supervised machine learning approach
that predicts RIs between a large number of human TFs and genes,
independent of any speciﬁc condition. Our approach distinguishes
between TFs and genes and does not presume any dependency of
target genes on the gene expression gradients of their regulating
TFs. It bases on the knowledge of experimentally derived regulatory
interactions in human. For deriving RIs for regulation studies
of human cells, RIP has been implemented in a package for
the statistical software R and is available for download at
http://www.ichip.de/software/RIP.html.

2 METHODS

2.1 Gene expression analysis

Gene expression data was taken from the CAMDA 2007 dataset containing
5896 gene expression proﬁles collected from a wide range of human
cancer types comprising normal and disease tissue samples which
were performed with Affymetrix HG—U133A microarrays (ArrayExpress,
www.cbi.ac.uk/arrayexpress, accession E—TABM—185). To get unbiased
datasets, we disregarded cell line experiments and experiments with <10
samples. Finally, we used gene expression data from 4064 primary human
tissue samples of 76 experimental subsets (=conditions) for our meta—
analysis. Microarray probe—sets were included in the analysis if they mapped
to exactly one gene from the EntrezGene database (Maglott et al., 2007)
according to Affymetrix annotations. For each of these probe—sets, the raw
expression values were used from the probes located at the 3/ end of
their target sequence to minimize RNA degradation effects and reverse
transcriptase errors. With this, we obtained expression levels of 13069
genes for all 76 conditions. Only these genes were considered. Each subset
(microarrays of one condition) was normalized using the Robust multi—array
average (RMA) method as implemented in the affy R—package (Bioconductor
release 2.4, www.bioconductor.org). Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients were

computed for each gene pair and condition by a correlation meta—analysis.
To account for anticorrelation due to inhibitory signaling propagation, the
absolute correlation values were used. We employed a ﬁltering approach
adapted from Zhou et al. (2005) to select highly correlated gene pairs. The
ﬁlter consisted of two parameters: The ﬁlter consisted of two parameters:
correlation coefﬁcient (CC) and fraction of conditions (FoC). When co—
applied, they select gene pairs that exceed a deﬁned minimum correlation
(absolute value) in a deﬁned minimum percentage of the 76 conditions. CC
and FoC each take values between 0 and 1. Applying CC = 0.6 and FoC = 0.25
therefore selected those gene pairs that correlated >0.6 (or < —0.6) in >19
conditions (25%).

2.2 Identiﬁcation of functionally related gene pairs
using Gene Ontology

To estimate the functional relatedness between genes in a gene pair,
we compared their Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The mapping of
GO terms of biological processes was downloaded from EntrezGene
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/ gene). The GO term hierarchy was taken from
the GO.db R—package in Bioconductor release 2.4. Following an approach
described elsewhere (Zhou et al., 2005), we constructed 81 functional
categories. A GO term was selected as a functional category if its annotation
contained 2150 genes of our analyzed genes and if each of its children
contained <150 genes, resulting in 81 midrange GO terms. These 81
GO terms described functional categories that were used to estimate the
functional relation of gene pairs from the correlation meta—analysis. We
assessed a pair of genes as functionally related if they shared at least one of
these functional categories.

2.3 The gold standard

The TRANSFAC database v2009.2 (Wingender et al., 1996) provided
PWMs used for TFBS predictions as well as a collection of TFs and their
target genes derived from published experiments. TRANSFAC contained
redundant entries for a number of TFs. Therefore, we manually corrected this
by pooling TF entries if all their subunits were encoded by the same genes
(the same EntrezGene IDs). We further discarded TFs with less than two
Rls. This was done because we could not deﬁne appropriate validation sets
for such TFs (to estimate their performance). Additionally, 72% of these TFs
did not have any PWM motif in TRANSFAC (which was needed for several
machine learning features, see below). This yielded 303 TFs with 2896 RIs
for 949 regulated genes. For all these genes, we had the respective probes
on the Affymetrix microarrays and promoters for the TFBS predictions.
For the machine learning approach, we deﬁned a gold standard comprising
true positive and true negative regulatory interactions (True RIs and True
non—Rls). True RIs (2896) were extracted from TRANSFAC and based on
published experiments. The remaining 284 641 possible combinations of the
303 TFs and 949 genes were deﬁned as True non—Rls. This is based on
the assumption that regulatory networks are sparse and therefore a vast
majority of unknown TF—gene pairs are unlikely to interact. It is to note
that a large number of interactions may not have been discovered yet.
Still, even if one assumes that e.g. only 10% of interactions have yet been
discovered, our ‘True’ non—interactions would comprise ~26 000 wrongly
labeled interactions. This would still be acceptable compared to the much
larger amount of remaining ~258 000 real True non—Rls (out of 284641
non—Rls).

2.4 TFBS predictions with PWM motifs

Promoter sequences were extracted from EntrezGene using the biomaRt
package for R (Bioconductor release 2.4). Sequences from the annotated
transcriptional start site up to 1kb upstream were considered. To detect
putative TFBS, PWMs were taken from TRANSFAC v2009.2 and PWM—
scans were performed as described previously using the cureos R—package
v0.3 (Westennann et al., 2008). P—values for each prediction were obtained

by comparing its score to 10 000 randomly generated sequences (for details,
see Westermann et al., 2008). A motif was considered to be signiﬁcant if
P < 0.1. Hits with a P 2 0.1 were discarded.

2.5 Deﬁning the features for the classiﬁer

Ten features were calculated to describe discriminating properties of a pair
of a TF and a gene (putative RI) based on TFBS predictions from PWM—
scans, the correlation meta—analysis and information about co—regulation
of genes from the gold standard. The correlation was used to (i) identify
all genes that correlate at high levels with a given gene (deﬁning sets of
correlation neighbors, see below) and to (ii) compare the average correlation
of a candidate target gene to known TF targets (or non—targets). The features,
therefore, do not presume any dependency between the expression proﬁles
of a target gene and the expression of TF encoding genes.

All possible gene pairs from the gene expression analysis were ﬁltered
by applying the two ﬁlters CC=0.6 and FoC=0.25. For each remaining
gene pair, we deﬁned the two genes to be linked by correlation. The set
of genes with correlation links to a given gene were then designated to
be its correlation neighbors. Six features for a putative RI were based on
correlation neighbors:

(1) Feature one was the number of correlation neighbors of the
corresponding gene.

(2) Feature two was the number of correlation neighbors (including
the corresponding gene) which were known to be regulated by the
corresponding TF (True Rls, taken from the gold standard).

(3

V

Feature three was —log10(P) in which P was the estimated
signiﬁcance for the enrichment of known regulated genes (True Rls
in the training sets, taken from the gold standard) in the correlation
neighbors (including the corresponding gene) in comparison to all
other genes (P was calculated by a Fisher’s exact test).

(4

V

Feature four was the number of correlation neighbors with a
signiﬁcant PWM hit of the corresponding TF.

(5

V

Feature ﬁve was —log10(P) in which P was the estimated signiﬁcance
for enrichment of PWM—hits of the TF within the correlation neighbors
including the corresponding gene (P was calculated by a Fisher’s
exact test).

(6

V

Feature six was the number of correlation neighbors that were known
to be regulated (True Rls in the training sets, taken from the gold
standard) and which had a signiﬁcant PWM hit of the TF.

Two features were added describing TFBS predictions and knowledge about
co—regulation:

(7) Feature seven was —log10(P) in which P was the signiﬁcance of the
PWM hit of the corresponding TF.

(8) Feature eight was the number of genes known to be regulated by
the TF (True Rls in the training sets, taken from the gold standard).
This feature was added to enable differentiation between universal
and speciﬁc TFs.

Furthermore, two features were deﬁned considering the correlation of known
co—regulated or non—co—regulated genes:

(9) We selected all genes known to be regulated by the corresponding
TF (True Rls in the training sets, taken from the gold standard). For
each of these target genes, we calculated the median correlation to
the corresponding gene of the RI over all conditions (76 conditions).
Feature nine was the average of these medians.

(10) We selected all genes which were not known to be regulated by the
corresponding TF (True non—Rls in the training sets, taken from the
gold standard). Feature 10 was then calculated in analogy to feature
nine.

Fig. 1. General workﬂow. Features for inferring Rls between TFs and genes
were derived from three different aspects: co—regulation of genes derived
from a meta—analysis of gene expression proﬁles, TF binding site predictions
and statistics about a combination of both including experimentally validated
binding information from the training set (gold standard). The information of
the gold standard was also used to deﬁne True Rls and True non—Rls. SVMs
were trained with True Rls and True non—Rls and then used to predict new
Rls. For training, True Rls and True non—Rls were divided into a training set
and a validation set. An equal number of True Rls and True non—Rls were
randomly drawn (bootstrapping approach) 100 times and used to train 100
different SVMs yielding one ensemble classiﬁer. Each ensemble classiﬁer
was evaluated with its validation set. This procedure was repeated 20 times
yielding an averaged estimate about their performances. The classiﬁers were
combined to one master RIP classiﬁer containing 2000 SVMs and applied
to predict new Rls.

During training the classiﬁers, information of known Rls from the validation
sets was not used, and all Rls from the validation sets were considered as
True non—Rls.

2.6 Training, validating and applying the classiﬁer

We performed a 20x 100—fold stratiﬁed cross—validation (overview of the
workﬂow is given in Fig. 1). The classiﬁcations were performed using
support vector machines (SVMs) from the R—package MCRestimate of
Bioconductor release 2.4. SVMs with Gaussian kernels were employed.
For the training sets, we randomly selected 75% of all True Rls and True
non—Rls (2172 True Rls, 213488 True non—Rls). The remaining of 25%
of Rls served for validation to estimate the performance of the classiﬁers.
To optimize the parameters (kernel width and cost function), 75% of True
Rls of the training set were drawn with replacement from the 2172 True

RIs and the same amount from the 213 488 True non—Rls of the training
set. One SVM classiﬁer was trained with these samples and kernel width
y and cost function 0 were optimized by a grid search employing y: 2‘,
ie {—10, —8, —6, —4, —2,0, 2,4} and c: 2j,je {—6, —4, —2,0,2,4,6,8, 10}
using the rest of the training set for validation. This was done by a 10—fold
inner cross—validation of the MCR estimate package. To obtain variability and
to account for the high amount of True non—Rls, we performed this procedure
100 times yielding 100 SVM classiﬁers by using different sets of randomly
selected True Rls and True non—Rls from the training set. All 100 trained
machines were combined and used as one ensemble classiﬁer. The ensemble
classiﬁer was validated with the validation set by a voting scheme. Each SVM
classiﬁer voted for an R1 of the validation set and the minimum number of
positive votes was set to deﬁne the stringency for the ensemble classiﬁer.
During training, True Rls from the validation sets were set as True non—Rls to
leave any class—label information of the validation sets untouched (for feature
10, this was done vice versa with True non—Rls from the validation sets).
The whole process was repeated 20 times using different randomly selected
training and validation sets. The overall performance was then estimated
from the average of all 20 cross—validations for each stringency threshold.
To predict new Rls, all information from the gold standard was employed to
train the machines. All trained machines (2000) were taken as one combined
master classiﬁer (RIP master classiﬁer) using again the voting scheme in
which each SVM contributed one vote. Conﬁdence values of the predictions
were calculated from the number of positive votes according to the averaged
precision values of the cross—validation.

2.7 Enrichment tests for differentially expressed genes
of the case study

In the case study, interferon a (IFNa) induction was examined using
human monocytes and Affymetrix HG—U95Av2 microarrays (Tassiulas et al.,
2004). Data were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus
database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/, accession GSE1740) and normalized
as described above. Differentially expressed genes were determined between
samples with and without IFNa stimulation (six samples each) using the
signiﬁcance analysis of microarrays (SAM) and a false discovery rate
(FDR) of <0.01 (Tusher et al., 2001). One—sided Fisher’s exact tests were
performed to identify overrepresented differentially expressed genes among
the predicted TF—modules (vote cutoff 1600). P—values were corrected for
multiple testing by the (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

2.8 Associating TF-modules to pathways

Predicted TF—modules were associated with pathways from the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; Kanehisa and Goto, 2000).
For each TF—module, genes were selected from predicted Rls with Z 1600
votes from the RIP master classiﬁer. One—sided Fisher’s exact tests were
performed to identify pathways being signiﬁcantly enriched in genes of
the predicted TF—modules. To focus on major signatures, pathways and
TF—modules with less than three genes as well as pathways assigned to
diseases were not considered. This resulted in 176 pathways of signaling
and metabolism for the analysis. All P—values were corrected for multiple
testing using the Benjamini—Hochberg method.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Predicting regulated genes of TFs with a machine
learning approach

Figure 1 gives an overview of the workﬂow. True TF—gene

interactions (True RIs) were derived from TRANSFAC (Wingender

et al., 1996) database (the gold standard) comprising 2896

experimentally well—studied RIs of 303 TFs and 949 genes. All other

284651 pairs of TFs and genes from these sets were considered

as True non—Regulatory Interactions (True non—RIs). For each
RI, 10 features were calculated to separate True RIs from True
non—RIs. These features were combined from results of a correlation
meta—analysis of gene expression (4064 microarrays covering 76
conditions), PWM—scans and information about co—regulation of
genes by common TFs (TF—modules). We used these features for
training and validation of classiﬁers (SVMs). As the number of
True RIs was sparse compared with the number of True non—RIs,
we performed a stratiﬁed 20X 100—fold cross—validation for training
the classiﬁers and estimating their performances. Finally, one master
classiﬁer was used combining 20 ensemble classiﬁers (consisting of
100 SVMs each) to predict new RIs.

3.2 Genes with correlated gene expression share
biological processes

Our prediction method is based on the assumption that genes
regulated by the same TF share common cellular processes and thus
correlate in their gene expression. To get a quantitative estimate
for this assumption, we performed a correlation meta—analysis and
compared the correlation of gene pairs with similar function to
randomly selected gene pairs. For the correlation meta—analysis,
we calculated Pearson’s correlation for all possible gene pairs for
all 76 conditions. We selected gene pairs at different levels of
correlation (adjusting CC and FoC, see Section 2) and estimated
their functional relation using GO terms (Ashburner et al., 2000)
for biological processes. We considered 81 GO terms for the
analysis adapting an approach described elsewhere (Zhou et al.,
2005). The 81 GO terms were retrieved by selecting terms that
contained at least 150 annotated genes and that had only children
with <150 annotated genes. This cross—section through the GO
graph yielded a well—balanced selection of GO terms which were
sufﬁciently descriptive and speciﬁc to describe particular biological
functions on a broad range. To quantify the functional relatedness
of gene pairs, we deﬁned the functional similarity score (FS—score)
as the percentage of gene pairs sharing at least one selected
GO term out of all gene pairs. Figure 2 shows the results for
different correlation stringencies. Notably, for a wide range of
cutoffs (selecting 55000 genes, see Fig. 2), the FS—score of our
inferred gene pairs was higher than for gene pairs of the gold
standard (pairs of genes known to be regulated by the same TF).
Our inferred pairs showed FS—scores between 14.8% and 58.3%
(stringency parameters CC = 0.6—0.9, FoC = 0.25—0.5, see Section 2)
while the gold standard had an FS—score of 35.3%. The FS—score
increased with higher stringency (up to CC = 0.8, FoC =0.35) from
14.8% to 57.3%.

Interestingly, increasing the stringency further reduced the
FS—score (at cutoffs for which the number of selected gene pairs
was <300). We found that this behavior was due to an increased
fraction of constitutively expressed gene families (e.g. hemoglobins,
histones, immunoglobulins) that show high correlation of expression
between each other without sharing any common biological
processes. We compared these results to 100 000 randomly selected
gene pairs sampled from the same gene—pool. For these random
samples, the FS—score was distinctively lower (11.2%). These
results demonstrate that genes with correlated expression were
considerably often involved in similar cellular processes, which
was comparable to gene pairs known to be regulated by the
same TFs.

Fig. 2. Gene pairs with high expression correlation are functionally related.
The graph shows the FS—score which is the percentage of gene pairs sharing
at least one functional category for a variety of different stringency criteria
[Pearson correlation (CC) and fraction of classes (FoC)]. For example, setting
the threshold for CC to 0.85 in >25% (FoC = 0.25) of the datasets yielded 380
annotated gene pairs of which 56.6% (2215) shared the same functional GO
category. For comparison, the gold standard comprised 35.3% (12176 out
of 34 538) pairs having at least one functional GO category in common and
only 11.2% of 100 000 randomly selected gene pairs had common functional
GO categories.

3.3 Groups of correlated genes are frequently
regulated by common TFs

The correlation of gene pairs served as a good basis for deducing
features of RIs for a machine learning approach to distinguish True
RIs from True non—RIs. For this, we deﬁned correlation links for
gene pairs with sufﬁciently high expression correlation. We chose
CC=0.6 and FoC=25% as a robust cutoff yielding the most
correlation links for the highest number of genes, while having
an FS—score that was still sufﬁciently higher than the FS—score of
random gene pairs. For a gene of interest (of an RI), we deﬁned
genes as its correlation neighbors if they had a correlation link to
that gene. We calculated six features for RIs based on correlation
neighbors (features 1—6) and two additional features containing the
averaged correlation over all conditions (features 9 and 10). For
example, we considered the number of correlation neighbors that
were known to have a True RI to the TF of interest. As expected,
if there was a True RI between a gene and a TF, the number of
correlation neighbors with True RIs of the same TF was higher
compared with True non—RIs (Fig. 3a). The other features based on
correlation neighbors yielded similar discriminative power between
True RIs and True non—RIs. Table 1 contains the results for all
features.

3.4 Predicted TFBSs discriminate known RIs from the
bulk

To ﬁnd putative TFBSs, the promoter of each gene was scanned for
known binding motifs (using PWMs). We found that True RIs had
more often a putative TFBS of the particular TF than True non—RIs
(P < 4.6E—86 using a Wilcoxon test). Moreover, within the group of
correlation neighbors of a gene with a True RI, putative TFBSs of the
corresponding TF were more signiﬁcantly enriched in comparison
to True non—RIs (Fig. 3b). In total, we derived four features from

(a) Frequency distributions are given for feature two of True Rls (blue

Feature two was the number of correlation neighbors which were known
to be regulated by the corresponding TF (True Rls, taken from the gold
standard). The higher the feature value, the more correlating genes are
known to be regulated by the TF. Genes of True Rls had more correlation
neighbors that were regulated by the same TF than genes of True non—Rls. (b)
Frequency distribution of feature ﬁve: —log10(P) and P was the signiﬁcance
of enrichment of correlation neighbors with TFBSs of the TF. True RIs
showed more signiﬁcant enrichment of correlation neighbors with TFBSs
than non True Rls. For comparability, counts for True non—Rls were stratiﬁed
to the total number of True Rls in this ﬁgure.

3.5 Classiﬁer performance

The 20 training sets of True RIs and True non—RIs were assembled.
For each training set, all features were calculated and 100 SVMs
(denoted as one ensemble classiﬁer in the following) were trained
by a cross—validation. Each of the 20 ensemble classiﬁers predicted
a separate validation set from the gold standard. The results of
all 20 ensemble classiﬁers were averaged (as an estimate of their
performance) and compared with the performance of conventional
PWM—scans. We were speciﬁcally interested in correctly predicting
RIs which was estimated by the precision (rate of true positives

Fig. 4. Recall—precision curve of the ensemble classiﬁers (red) and the
PWM—scans (black). Mean values of all 20 ensemble classiﬁers were
calculated to estimate precision and recall for the master classiﬁer. We
obtained recall levels between 4.5% and 48.4% and precision levels between
44.0% and 5.0% by decreasing the threshold of required positive votes from
100 to 1. In contrast, PWM scans only yielded precisions of <5% at all
stringencies.

out of all positively classiﬁed). Notably, the classiﬁers showed very
good precision. At the most stringent cutoff (all 100 SVMs voted
positively), the classiﬁers reached a precision of 44.0% (recall:
4.5%, accuracy: 99%, speciﬁcity: 99.9%). This level of precision
is considerably good regarding that regulatory networks are sparse,
i.e. the number of True RIs is substantially lower than the number of
True non—RIs (~1 :99 in the gold standard). For the lowest stringency
(only one classiﬁer needed to vote positively), we got the best recall
of 48.4% (precision: 5%; accuracy: 90.1%; speciﬁcity: 90.6%). The
recall—precision curve for all stringencies is shown in Figure 4.
We analyzed the features of True RIs that were never classiﬁed
positively and compared them to True RIs that were always correctly
classiﬁed. More than 50% of these misclassiﬁed True RIs did not
have any signiﬁcant PWM hits within the promoter regions, whereas
>99% of the correctly classiﬁed True RIs had signiﬁcant PWM
hits. In contrast to our ensemble classiﬁers, PWM—scans alone were
below 5% precision at all stringency settings, and were therefore
considerably outperformed by the ensemble classiﬁers. It is to
note that we estimated the performance of our classiﬁers rather
conservatively. The actual prevalence of True RIs is likely to be
much higher than the one obtained from the gold standard as many
RIs may not have been discovered so far. Our approach was designed
to discover such new RIs and the considerably good precision of
the ensemble classiﬁers implied that combining them to a master
classiﬁer suited well to infer new RIs (Section 3.6).

3.6 Inferring new regulatory interactions

To infer new RIs on a large scale, we combined all trained 20
ensemble classiﬁers to one RIP master classiﬁer. We investigated
all combinations of the set of 303 TFs and all 13 069 investigated
genes yielding 3 959 907 candidate RIs. Features were calculated
with the entire training and validation set. The RIP master classiﬁer
was applied providing 2000 votes (one vote from each SVM
machine) for each candidate RI. Conﬁdence values were assessed
from the precisions of the validation set (averages of 20 ensemble
classiﬁers, see Section 4). With the most stringent cutoff, we

predicted 6073 RIs with 44.0% conﬁdence. With 231.5% conﬁdence
(cutoff of 21600 votes), we yielded 73 923 RIs for 301 TFs and
11 263 genes. Supplementary Table S1 contains all predictions with
this cutoff. Supplementary Table S2 provides an overview of the
numbers of predicted RIs for different cutoffs. The chosen cutoff
of 31.5% conﬁdence and 17.7% recall yielded a sufﬁcient number
of genes from newly predicted RIs while potentially avoiding
too many false positives, and these predicted RIs were used for
further investigations. We compared the performance of RIP to
the established methods CLR (Faith et al., 2007) and ARACNE
(Margolin et al., 2006) using the same expression data as input.
However, neither of the algorithms reached acceptable precision
levels at any stringency (details of the method and results can be
found in Supplementary Table S3.) We were interested why they
performed comparably poorly. These methods were based on direct
relationships between the expression proﬁles of TFs and their target
genes. This assumption may well hold in lower organisms, but it was
not appropriate for our human expression data. Only 2.2% of all true
RIs showed an absolute overall correlation (computed over all 4064
microarray experiments) >0.6 between the expression proﬁles of
the TF coding genes and their targets (see Supplementary Table S3).
These ﬁndings support the utility of RIP, in particular, for regulation
analysis of human cells.

3.7 Applying the inferred regulatory interactions to a
microarray gene expression study: identifying TFs
responsive to IFNoc

A typical application of our predicted RIs is to investigate the
association of TFs and their regulated genes (TF—modules) to a list of
differentially expressed genes from a microarray study. A TF can be
associated to this list of differentially expressed genes, if the genes
of the TF—module are signiﬁcantly enriched in the gene list. We
used microarray data from a study investigating the effect of IFNa
on monocytes (Tassiulas et al., 2004). The dataset contained six
samples treated with IFNa and six reference samples. We identiﬁed
241 signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.01). These
genes were signiﬁcantly enriched (P < 0.05 of a Fisher’s exact test)
in 13 of the predicted TF—modules (Table 2). On top of the resulting

list were TFs known to respond to IFNa. The most signiﬁcant
enrichment was found for the heterotrimeric TF—complex IFN—
stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3, P=6E—23) for which 20 out
of 28 predicted target genes were differentially expressed. ISGF3
consists of the subunits STATl, STAT2 and interferon regulatory
factor (IRF) 9. It is activated by cytokines and inﬂammatory
factors (Tassiulas et al., 2004). ISGF3 mediates the transcriptional
activation of IFN—inducible genes dependent on IFNa treatment (Fu
et al., 1990). Furthermore, we found enrichments for IRF1, IRF2,
IRF3, IRF7 and STAT3. Together with ISGF3, their response to
IFNa treatment is mediated by the JAK—STAT signaling pathway.
Two nuclear factor kappa b (NFKB) subunits (NFKBl and RELA)
and three E—twenty six (ETS)—domain TFs (ETS1, ELF2, SPIl)
completed the list of associated TF—modules. Speciﬁc roles for
all these TF classes have been described in monocytes (Brach
et al., 1993; Friedman, 2007) and in IFN signaling of T—helper
cells (Grenningloh et al., 2005). SPIl plays a central role in
monocyte and granulocyte development. It interacts with IRF4 and
IRF8 upon phosphorylation, and IRF8:SPIl complexes bind to an
ETS/IRF composite element containing an SPIl binding site. NFKB
family members are key regulators of the inﬂammatory response
in monocytes, and API family members cooperate with SPIl in
gene regulation in erythroid cells (Friedman, 2007). We compared
our predictions of ISGF3 target genes with predictions employing
only PWM—scans. The stringency of the PWM—scans was chosen
(P50.005) to get a number of predicted target genes that was
comparable to the master classiﬁer. The PWM—scan yielded 29 target
genes for ISGF3, only 4 out of which (=13.8%) were differentially
expressed in the IFNa study. Our predictions from the machine
learning approach were considerably more sensitive to infer genes
and TFs involved in the gene regulatory processes of IFNa response
(our predictions: 20 differentially expressed out of 28 predicted
ISGF3 target genes =71.4%).

Additionally, we analyzed the expression levels of the TF
encoding genes. IRF7 from the listed 13 TFs showed strong
differential expression at a signiﬁcant level and was upregulated
in the IFNa—induced cells. IRF1, IRF2, STAT2, STAT3 and RELA
had slightly (but consistently) elevated expression levels, whereas
IRF3 was slightly decreased in the IFNa—induced cells.

3.8 Genes were highly enriched in pathways which
were associated with TFs regulating these genes

To investigate the functional relevance of our predicted RIs, we
associated the predicted TF—modules with signaling and metabolic
pathways from KEGG database. We selected RIs from regulated
genes which were found in KEGG yielding 220 TF—modules of
22 345 predicted RIs with 3276 genes. Each gene set of the TF—
modules was tested to be enriched in each pathway of KEGG
(Fisher’s exact test). The results cover a variety of signaling and
metabolic pathways (Table 3). Additionally, we performed the same
analysis for 565 genes with known RIs in TRANSFAC (which was
the overlap of KEGG and TRANSFAC) and provided the results in
Supplementary Table S4. Most of the associations with our predicted
RIs have been described previously and reﬂect the biology of the
pathways. Potentially novel associations are marked in bold in
Table 3. In the following, we describe the ﬁndings for cell cycle
and proliferation—related signaling pathways (yellow in Table 3)
in more detail (other pathways are described in Supplementary

Nuclear transcription factor Y alpha (NFYA) was also associated
with these pathways. The binding of E2F is dependent on an
adjacent CCAAT site being occupied by NFY (Zhu et al., 2004),
and functionality of NFY has been shown for G2/M transition of
the cell cycle in combination with p53 (Imbriano et al., 2005). p53
and its family member p73 were associated with the pathway of p53
signaling. TCF7L2 was associated with the Wnt signaling pathway,
which is in accordance with the functionality of TCF7L2 in that
canonical pathway. In summary, these ﬁndings well support the
functional relevance of the predicted RIs for these pathways.

3.9 Predicted R18 are supported by comparison with
an independent database

To validate our predictions, we compared the predicted RIs (21600
votes) to known RIs of 74 TFs from 25 TF families of the
Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database (TRED). Details on
the procedure and all results can be found in Supplementary
Table S6. In brief, we tested for association (by means of
overrepresentation) of sets of RIs from TFs in TRED (TRED
TF—modules) with our predicted RIs for these TFs (our predicted
TF—modules). In 85.4% of all tested TFs, the correct TF—family was
among the top three TRED TF—modules, and in 73.5% the actual TF
was assigned correctly (again considering the top three hits). These
results further validated RIP using an independent source of RIs of
a signiﬁcant number of well—studied TFs.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We presented a novel machine learning approach (RIP) that predicts
gene regulation on a genome—wide scale with considerably high
precision. The predictions are based on a broad range of conditions
and can be applied to more speciﬁc experiments as well. Presumably,
only a minor fraction of all RIs has been discovered so far. Given
knowledge of 2896 True RIs for 949 human genes, a number of 6073
RIs (at the most stringent cutoff) predicted out of 3 959 907 candidate
RIs of 303 TFs and 13 069 genes seems reasonable. Also a number
of 73 923 RIs (lower stringency, requiring only 80% of positive
votes) yielded useful results when applied to the case study of IFN
signaling. We employed descriptors for inferring gene regulation
from three different aspects: (i) a meta—analysis was performed to
obtain groups of genes with high correlation in different cell and
tissue types from different experiments. (ii) TFBSs were predicted
in silico using PWMs to scan promoters of every investigated gene.
With these predictions, known transcription factor—gene regulations
could be well distinguished from other transcription factor—gene
combinations. (iii) Statistical descriptors were used to exploit the
association of co—regulation, correlation and TFBS predictions. This
information was integrated by a machine learning approach yielding
a powerful tool to infer regulatory networks that can be adjusted for
recall and precision at a high level of prediction performance. We
applied RIP to infer RIs in human. RIP is intended to be an in silico
approach to extend lists of known and experimentally derived RIs.
It needs PWMs (not necessarily extracted from TRANSFAC) of
known TFs with known binding sites for initial learning. Thus, other
TFs can also be included into the analysis if their binding motifs
have been identiﬁed in some target genes and a PWM motif could
be generated. With that knowledge, it is possible to extend the gold
standard and predict RIs for these TFs. If a comprehensive gold

standard of experimentally validated True RIs is given (and PWMs
for the corresponding TFs), the method can be readily applied also
to other well—studied organisms. The presented RIP classiﬁer offers
a wide range of applications for gene expression analyses such as
identiﬁcation of key transcription factors and pathways involved in
the pathology and changed function of the investigated cells.

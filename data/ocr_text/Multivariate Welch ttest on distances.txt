Abstract

Motivation: Permutational non-Euclidean analysis of variance, PERMANOVA, is routinely used in
exploratory analysis of multivariate datasets to draw conclusions about the significance of patterns
visualized through dimension reduction. This method recognizes that pairwise distance matrix be-
tween observations is sufficient to compute within and between group sums of squares necessary
to form the (pseudo) Fstatistic. Moreover, not only Euclidean, but arbitrary distances can be used.
This method, however, suffers from loss of power and type I error inflation in the presence of heter-
oscedasticity and sample size imbalances.

Results: We develop a solution in the form of a distance-based Welch t—test, T2 , for two sample
potentially unbalanced and heteroscedastic data. We demonstrate empirically the desirable type
I error and power characteristics of the new test. We compare the performance of PERMANOVA
and TVZV in reanalysis of two existing microbiome datasets, where the methodology has
originated.

1 Introduction

The PERMANOVA test (Anderson, 2001), has been proposed for
use in numerical ecology to test for the location differences in micro-
bial communities. The relationships between these communities are
typically described by ecological distance metrics (e.g. Jaccard, Chi-
Squared, Bray-Curtis) and visualized through dimension reduction
(also referred to as ordination in numerical ecology literature). The
PERMANOVA permutation test based on (pseudo) F statistic com-
puted directly from distances is a widely accepted means of estab-
lishing statistical significance for observed patterns. This test and
the extension of this paper are related to the multivariate Behrens-
Fisher problem (Krishnamoorthy and Yu, 2004) of testing the differ-
ence in multivariate means of samples from several populations. The
underlying statistics for both distance-based tests are related to the
Hotelling T2 statistic. The PERMANOVA is more general in allow-
ing for more than two populations to be compared simultaneously.

The distance-based geometric approach; however, forgoes the need
to estimate the covariance matrices. The cost of these geometric
approaches is that they only provide omnibus tests, which are un-
able to make inferences about individual components of the multi-
variate random vectors tested.

With the revived interest in numerical ecology fueled by the avail-
ability of DNA sequencing-based high-throughput microbial commu-
nity profiling, i.e. microbiomics, the PERMANOVA test is enjoying a
new wave of popularity. Several, cautionary articles have been pub-
lished noting the undesired behavior of the test in heteroscedastic con-
ditions (Warton et al., 2012). A definitive principled solution to this
issue is still lacking, however. The consensus is to ascertain the pre-
sence of heteroscedasticity using an additional test (e.g. PERMDISP;
Anderson, 2006; Anderson et al., 2006) in case of positive
PERMANOVA results and to report both with a disclaimer that the

differences cannot be made whenever both tests yield positive results.
In reality, the exactly matching multivariate spread between factor
levels can rarely be assumed and the robustness of PERMANOVA to
violations of homoscedasticity has not been characterized empirically.

1.1 Performance of PERMANOVA in heteroscedastic data
We demonstrate the adverse behavior of PERMANOVA in unbal-
anced heteroscedastic case via a simulation. Let sample one consists of
observations from 1000-dimensional uncorrelated multivariate nor-
mal distribution, where each component is standard normal (mean 0
and SD 1). Sample two is likewise 1000-dimensional uncorrelated
multivariate normal with means equal to 1 / m fraction of the
desired effect size and standard deviation equal 0.8. Thus sample one
has 20% more multivariate spread than sample two. We set the effect
size to 0, 2, 4 and 5. We compute the corresponding Euclidean dis-
tances for use with PERMANOVA test, using its implementation in
the adonis() function of the R (R Core Team, 2015) package vegan
(Oksanen et al., 2015). We repeat the simulation 1,000 times for each
set of parameters and compute the average rejection rate at or = 0.05.
Figure 1 summarizes the type I error and power characteristics for this
design with varying sample sizes. First, note that the type I error (left
most box, where effect size equal to 0) is only correct when the sam-
ples are balanced. Whenever, the number of observations in the most
dispersed sample is less than that in the other sample the type I error
is inﬂated. In the opposite case, hardly any rejections are made. When
there is true location difference between the samples (effect size
greater than 0), the power curves have non-typical sigmoidal shapes
corresponding to the loss of power with increasing number of obser-
vations in the overdispersed sample. However, the power curves
under balanced sample sizes (triangles) are typical. Note that if
PERMDISP is used to ascertain heteroscedasticity, only type I error in-
ﬂation can be detected, while the dramatic loss of power cannot be
corrected. When the samples are simulated under homoscedastic scen-
ario, typical values of type I error (around nominal significance
threshold) and power characteristics are observed (Table 1). These ob-
servations suggest that PERMANOVA is robust to violations of either
the homoscedasticity or the balanced sample size assumptions, but
not both. Simultaneous violation of both assumptions leads to loss of
type I error control and loss of power.

lution to heteroscedasticity-related type I error inﬂation and loss of

potentially unequal sample sizes. The headers of the boxes indicate the simu-
lated effect size 0 (where type I error rate is determined), 2, 4 and 5. The size
of the points corresponds to the number of observations in the least dis-
persed sample. Points, where the sample sizes are balanced, are indicated by
triangles. Plot of a method with ideal type I error characteristics (left box) will
be a horizontal line at the significance threshold oc=0.05. When effect size is
greater than 0, the plots show the power characteristics. Plot of a method
with ideal power will be a horizontal line at 1.0, corresponding to perfect
power and no type II error

power with PERMANOVA. We do this by demonstrating that in-
stead of the F—statistic utilized by PERMANOVA, a distance-based
Welch t—statistic can be computed. We derive this Welch t—statistic
from pairwise distance matrix. We perform an empirical study of
type I error and power properties of this statistic in the permutation
testing setup. Finally, we perform two applications of this new test
in discovery data analysis and small clinical study scenarios.

3 Materials and methods

3.1 Univariate case

In a two-sample X = {x1, . . . ,xnx }, Y = {311, . . . ,yny} independent
and identically distributed univariate case, we are concerned with
assessing the difference between the population means of the under-
lying distributions from which xi’s and y,’s are drawn. The square of
the corresponding Welch t—statistic is

2 = (9—5 — 7)2 (1)
W 535/11,, +55/ny’
where 3? = 1/nx Ex,- and 5,2, = 1/(nx — 1) Z (x,- — 3‘02 are the usual
estimates of the sample mean and variance for X, with y and 5;
defined similarly for Y. Observe that the sum of square differences

from the mean, which appears in the expression for sample variance,
can be written in terms of the sum of squares of pairwise differences.

2,2,.(961' — 9602 = nixZKI-(xi — 9602- (6)

This allows us to write the variance as

where I denotes double summation  2;;- +1. Thus the de-

nominator of (1) can be expressed in terms of only squares of pair-
wise differences between data points. Likewise, the difference of
the means in the numerator of (1) can be expressed in terms
of just the pairwise differences. Let Z = (x1,...,x,,x,y1,...,y,,y)

=  (x,- — Z)2 —  (x,- — 37:)2. (21)

The combined contribution of the first terms of (21) from 3? and y
terms of (16) can be written in terms of pairwise differences of zi’s:

Z?“ (x.- — 2% + Z? (yi — 2% = 2:1”: (z.- — 2%

11,, +11),

 

This and Equations (6), (16) and (21) imply that the square of
mean difference is expressable in terms of sums of squares of pair-
wise differences:

(23)

Finally, Equations (7) and (23) can be put together to form the
Welch t-statistic (1) in terms of only the squares of the pairwise
differences.

The point differences can be thought of as distances. Let
D = {dii}i,i=1,___,nx+ny be the matrix of absolute pairwise differences,

d,,- = abs(z,-—z,-) = (z,- —z,')2. The elements of D are in fact

Euclidean distances between data points in one-dimension. Now the
sums of squares can be expressed in terms of dii’s:

Note that Equation (24) expresses total sums of squares, and
Equations (25) and (26) express the within sample sums of squares
in terms of distances, while the term in square brackets of Equation
(23) corresponds to between group sums of squares. These are the
same terms that appear in the PERMANOVA two-sample
(pseudo)F statistic computation. Here we write the PERMANOVA
statistic for the two sample case and arbitrary ﬁx and my:

It is easy to check that when the sample sizes are balanced, nxzny,

or within group sums of squares are equal, «dz-E =  <I-dz-2i,
then FA and Ta; differ by a multiplicative factor that only depends

on nx and n . This means that inference under the two statistics will

y
be different when both unbalanced sample sizes and heteroscedastic-

ity is present, which may help Té, correct the adverse behavior of
PERMANOVA observed in Figure 1 and Table 1.

3.2 Multivariate extension
Next we examine a multivariate extension of the distance-based Té,
statistic. Let the observations be multivariate vectors, Z =

(X1,...,an,Y1,...,Yny), where X,=(X§1),...,X§m)) and Y,
(Yl-(l), . . . , Yi(m)) are of arbitrary dimension m. As before, let D = {dii}

be the pairwise matrix of Euclidean distances d,,- = ||Z,- —Z,-|| =

2L1 (ZS/e) — 2702))? We use these distances in place of their uni-
variate counterpart to compute Té, and FA. By extension arbitrary
distances (e.g. Jaccard, Bray-Curtis etc.) can be used for this purpose.
Note that in contrast to the PERMANOVA statistic the distance-
based Té, explicitly accounts for potentially unbalanced number of

observations and differences in multivariate spread in the two
samples.

3.3 Permutation test

The exact distribution of the multivariate distance-based Té, statis-
tic is dependent on many factors, such as the dimensionality of the
underlying data, the distributions of these random variables, the
exact distance metric used etc. To make a practical general test, we
use permutation testing to establish the significance. To do so we
compute T%V(i) on k permutations, Z6), for i = 1,. . . ,k, of the ori-
ginal data. The estimate of significance is obtained as the fraction of
times the permuted statistic is greater than or equal to T%V, i.e.
p =%Zf1(T%V g  Here  designates the indicator func-
tion. In practice, the distance matrix D does not need to be recom-
puted with each permutation, as it is sufficient to just permute the
sample labels. This permutation procedure is used by the original
PERMANOVA method and is a standard application of permuta-
tion testing.

3.4 Distance-based effect size

The ability to compute pseudo-variances and square mean difference
using just pairwise distances allows for estimation multivariate ef-
fect sizes in terms of familiar to statisticians Cohen’s (1. Using deriv-
ations (7) and (23) we write

 

 

d2: (9—5—37)2 :"x+"yx
(11x — Us: + (113, — Us; nxny
11,, +11), —2

 

1 2 1 2 1 2
  
1 2 1 2 '
ail-«(xi — xi) + 11722-49"— 21>

nx+ny—2

 

(29)

The positive square root of d2 provides an estimate of the absolute
value of the distance Cohen’s d and adds another potentially inter-
esting effect size measurement for multivariate analysis, in addition
to the recently proposed 602 (Kelly et al., 2015).

4 Results

4.1 Simulation results

In this section, we extend the simulation study in the Introduction
section to compare the performance of PERMANOVA and T%V.
Again, the ﬁx observations in sample one are independent and iden-
tically distributed (i.i.d.) X,- N N(O, I), the 113, observations in sample
two are i.i.d. Y,- N N(1e/(/(1000),f1), where 8 controls the effect
size and f controls the degree of multivariate spread differences
(fraction SD) between the two samples. For each set of 11x, 11),, e, and
f we simulate 1000 independent datasets. For each dataset we com-
pute the p-values using permutation testing with PERMANOVA
and Té, statistics. We calculate the fraction of rejected null-
hypothesis with each test at significance level or = 0.05 .

First, we consider a broad scan over the sample sizes
11mm), 6 (5,10,15,20). Representing, case to control (or treated to
untreated) ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4 with relatively small overall
sample size. Under the null hypothesis T%V maintains the prescribed
rejection rate for all examined levels of heteroscedasticity (Fig. 2
first column). As we have seen in the Introduction, in the unbal-
anced heteroscedastic case the PERMANOVA exhibits inflated type

Fig. 2. Empirical type I error and power characteristics of PERMANOVA
(black) and TVZV (red). The effect sizes vary in columns of panels. Effect size 0
corresponds to the case where the null hypothesis is true and the plots dem-
onstrate the type I error. Plot of a method with ideal type I error characteris-
tics will be a horizontal line at the significance threshold or: 0.05. When effect
size is greater than 0, the plots show the power characteristics. Plot of a
method with ideal power will be a horizontal line at 1.0, corresponding to per-
fect power and no type II error. The degree of heteroscedasticity varies along
the rows and is represented in terms of ratio of the standard deviations (Frac
SD) between two samples. The bottom row corresponds to homoscedastic
scenario, the top and middle rows show high and medium heteroscedasticity
scenarios, respectively. The number of observations in the least dispersed
sample is indicated by the size of the point and the balanced samples are
identified by triangles

I errors (Fig. 2 first column). As demonstrated in scenarios where
e > 0, unlike PERMANOVA, Té, has greater power to detect differ-
ences as the sample sizes increase (Fig. 2 columns two and three,
rows one and two). The power curves for the two tests are similar
when multivariate spread in the two samples is the same (Fig. 2 bot-
tom row columns two and three). When it is not, however, the
curves intersect at approximately the point where the sample sizes in
the two groups are balanced (triangles). This suggests that Té, over-
comes the problematic behavior of PERMANOVA and has similar
power under the homoscedastic design (Fig. 2 bottom row) and
when sample sizes are balanced (Fig. 2 triangles).

Imagine an experiment in which an investigator aims to compare
10 observations in each group. For reasons beyond their control
(e.g. animal dies, subjects drop from protocol, unequal gender ratio)
the resulting sample sizes at the end of the experiment may not
exactly be 10 versus 10. These conditions are encountered in many
common discovery type studies. We examine the effect of heterosce-
dasticity for PERMANOVA and Ta; under these conditions. We
perform a similar comparison for sample sizes in the vicinity of 50,
corresponding to sample sizes in a typical small clinical study. As we
have seen previously, when the multivariate spread in the two sam-
ples is the same or similar, the power curves for PERMANOVA and
Ta; overlap (Fig. 3a and b bottom row). With sample sizes around
10 the violation of homescedasticity leads to loss of power (Fig. 3a
columns two and three and rows one and two) and inflated type I
errors (Fig. 3a first column rows one and two) with PERMANOVA
relative toT%V. With the sample size increasing to approximately 50,
PERMANOVA becomes more robust, while the traces of the issue
still remain when the effect size is small (Fig.3b second column).
Likewise, at these sample sizes the type I error inﬂation is still

present when the unbalance is more extreme and heteroscedasticity
is large (Fig. 3b top left). Overall, T%Vhas better or similar type I
error and power characteristics to PERMANOVA and should be
recommended in all two-sample designs.

4.2 Application examples

We apply the Té, to two previously published datasets on micro-
biome differences in the gut (Cho et al., 2012) and on the skin
(Alekseyenko et al., 2013). In both cases we compute the distances

using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, d,,- = Ekabs(ZEk) —Z/(k))/
2,42,“) +Zlfk)). For each comparison, we compute the P-values

with 100 000 permutations under PERMANOVA and T%V and

2 and distance

quantify the corresponding effect size using co
Cohennc d. The difference in the multivariate spread H is measured

as the ratio of mean distances within compared groups.

4.2.1 Sub-therapeutic antibiotic treatment microbiome dataset

The gut microbiome dataset consists of measurements of abun-
dances of gut microbes obtained from mice that either received a
prescribed antibiotic in their drinking water or none (C). Samples
were obtained from two locations of the gut of these mice (cecal and
fecal). The target number of samples per location was 10; however,
several fecal samples could not be analyzed for technical reasons.
Table 2 summarizes the results of the analysis of these data. At a
commonly used significance threshold of or: 0.05, both
PERMANOVA and Té, agree in the statistical decision. However, if
we were to use a more stringent or = 0.01, the comparison of the con-
trol microbiota against microbiota of all the mice receiving antibi-
otic would not be deemed significant under PERMANOVA, while
the P-values under Ta; are below the significance threshold. The esti-
mated effect size, d, for C. versus All abx. comparison in cecal and
fecal samples are 1.28 and 1.42, respectively. Both of these are con-
sidered large effect sizes (Cohen, 1988) and given adequate sample
sizes would be deemed highly significant. Moreover, when we

examine these data using principal coordinates analysis, the separ-
ation of the group centroids is evident (Fig. 4). The largest separ-
ation along PC1 is observed for the location (fecal versus cecal). The
antibiotic versus control groups are separated along PC2. Note that
for cecal samples the comparison of the controls against each of the
antibiotic treatment groups individually is significant and similar for
both tests. This is expected because the design is balanced in these
tests.

4.2.2 Skin microbiome in psoriasis dataset

The skin microbiome dataset consists of observations of skin micro-
bial abundances from control subjects and from psoriasis subjects,
who contribute two samples from a lesion site and from symmetrical
unaffected site. PERMANOVA and Té, tests produce similar signifi-
cance values and inferences (Table 3), which is owed to the fact that

Fig. 3. Empirical type I error and power characteristics of PERMANOVA (black) and TVZV (red) tests with varying effect size, degree of heteroscedasticity and num-
ber of observations in two samples, for sample sizes typical for (a) a discovery study or (b) a small clinical study. The effect sizes vary in columns of panels. Effect
size 0 corresponds to the case where the null hypothesis is true and the plots demonstrate the type I error. Plot of a method with ideal type I error characteristics
will be a horizontal line at the significance threshold oc=0.05. When effect size is greater than 0, the plots show the power characteristics. Plot of a method with
ideal power will be a horizontal line at 1.0, corresponding to perfect power and no type II error. The degree of heteroscedasticity varies along the rows and is rep-
resented in terms of ratio ofthe standard deviations (Frac SD) between two samples. The bottom row corresponds to homoscedastic scenario, the top and middle
rows show high and medium heteroscedasticity scenarios, respectively. The number of observations in the least dispersed sample is indicated by the size of the

point and the balanced samples are identified by triangles

the multivariate spread is similar in all conditions, and sample sizes
are larger and closer to being balanced.

5 Discussion

By derivation Té, inherits the characteristics of the univariate un-
equal variance Welch t—test. That test is recommended as a replace-
ment for pooled variance t-test in all circumstances. Testing for
unequal variances by methods, such as PERMDISP, is not recom-
mended before a choice of the primary test is made. The main disad-
vantage of the Welch’s t—test compared with ANOVA is potential
loss of robustness when violations of normality are present (Levy,
1978). This issue, however, rests on the limiting distributions of the
tests. In our case, the inference is obtained by permutation testing,
which alleviates this concern. Thus Té, should also become a first
line replacement for PERMANOVA in simple two-sample case.
Two-sample scenario is a common experimental design, but a
general solution for k-level factors is still desirable. The behavior of
PERMANOVA under heteroscedastic conditions with k-level fac-
tors have not been examined, but is suspected to suffer from similar
shortcomings as in the two sample case. When heteroscedasticity is
suspected, several remedial strategies can be implemented. First, a
variance stabilizing transformation can be applied to the data to re-
move heteroscedasticity (McMurdie and Holmes, 2014). If trans-
formation of the data is not desirable for any reason, other strategies
could include developing specialized sub-sampling and permutation-
based strategies. For example, the data could be re-sampled m times
at balanced sample sizes and an average PERMANOVA statistic
computed FA 2 % ZiFX). This statistic could then be compared with
the null distribution generated by permuting the sample labels r-
times and computing the re-sampled FA(1), . . . ,FA (r), where
FA(/') ziziFXW). The significance can be determined by using
regular permutation testing approach to compare the number of
times the obtained statistic is more extreme than those observed
under the null, i.e. pm 2 Z;1(FA > FA(/')). This method ensures
that the groups are balanced in each comparison, but may still

lead to loss of power due to decreased effective sample size in each
sub-sampled comparison. This approach is reported here as a sug-
gestion that needs further development and evaluation before in can
be implemented in practice. The final strategy for analysis of data
with arbitrary number of levels could involve the application of Ti,
to only relevant pairwise comparisons with appropriate multiple
comparison controls in place.

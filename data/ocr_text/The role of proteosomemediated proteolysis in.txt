ABSTRACT

Motivation: The appropriate modulation of the stress response to
variable environmental conditions is necessary to maintain sustained
viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Particularly, controlling the
abundance of proteins that may have detrimental effects on cell
growth is crucial for rapid recovery from stress-induced quiescence.
Results: Prompted by qualitative modeling of the nutrient starvation
response in yeast, we investigated in vivo the effect of proteolysis
after nutrient starvation showing that, for the Gis1 transcription factor
at least, proteasome-mediated control is crucial for a rapid return
to growth. Additional bioinformatics analyses show that potentially
toxic transcriptional regulators have a significantly lower protein half-
Iife, a higher fraction of unstructured regions and more potential
PEST motifs than the non-detrimental ones. Furthermore, inhibiting
proteasome activity tends to increase the expression of genes
induced during the Environmental Stress Response more than those
in the rest of the genome. Our combined results suggest that
proteasome-mediated proteolysis of potentially toxic transcription
factors tightly modulates the stress response in yeast.

1 INTRODUCTION

A prompt and appropriate response to abrupt ﬂuctuations in external
conditions is crucial to survive stressful environmental Changes,
especially in unicellular organisms such as the yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. During the nutrient starvation, in order to ensure
extended survival, S.cerevisiae cells exit the cell cycle at G1 and
enter the quiescent state (called G0), but rapidly resume growth
and proliferation when nutrient conditions turn favorable. Two
conserved signaling pathways Ras/CAMP and TOR are known to
coordinate the entry into and exit from the quiescent phase (Wilson
and Roach, 2002). These two pathways regulate the entry into the
stationary phase, converging on the protein kinase Rim15 (Pedruzzi
et al., 2003) and downstream transcriptional activators, including the
stress response (STRE) transcription factors (TFs) Msn2/Msn4 and

the post—diauxic shift (PDS) transcription factor Gisl (Zhang et al.,
2009). The nutrient starvation response is an intensively studied
process, but the exact molecular mechanisms involved have not yet
been fully elucidated. On the one hand, the scarcity of quantitative
data pose a problem for the construction of quantitative models; on
the other hand, the current understanding of the causal regulatory
wiring encourages the use of qualitative computational models to
gain new insights.

Executable Biology (Fisher and Henzinger, 2007; Fisher and
Piterman, 2010) is an evolving paradigm that focuses on the design
of executable computer algorithms that mimic biological phenomena
through the use of formal methods from engineering and computer
science. Biological knowledge can be captured in mathematically
sound formalisms, and then easily translated into executable
algorithms for dynamical analysis and automatic reasoning. Here,
we show that formalizing the available knowledge on the nutrient
starvation response as a qualitative model highlighted the different
modulation of Gisl availability, encouraging further in vivo
investigations on the role of proteosome—mediated proteolysis.

Proteasome—mediated proteolysis is essential for many cellular
processes in yeast and other eukaryotes, including regulation
of protein concentrations and degradation of misfolded proteins.
Integrating our computational insights and the in vivo experiments
with genome—wide bioinformatics analyses lead us to suggest that
proteasome—mediated proteolysis of potentially toxic transcription
factors tightly modulates the stress response in yeast.

2 METHODS
2.1 Petri nets

We have built a qualitative logical model of nutrient starvation based on
Petri nets. Petri nets are mathematically sound formalisms that can be
graphically represented (Reisig and Rozenberg, 1998). Recently, Petri nets
have been used in systems biology to build and analyze coarse—grained
models of complex processes (Bonzanni er al., 2009), taking advantage of the
intuitiveness of their representation and the soundness of their foundation.
The Petri net modeling framework used in this work has been derived
from the seminal work of Chaouiya er al. (2006). The states predicted by
the model can be found in Supplementary Material. Statistical analyses of
bioinformatics data were performed using R.

2.2 Gisl overexpression at the transition phase

Wild—type (BY4742) cells were transformed with pCMl90 (Gari er 611., 1997)
and pCMl90—GIS1 (Zhang and Oliver, 2010). Transformants were grown on

by staining cells with phloxine B (Sigma—Aldrich).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Model construction and analysis

In order to investigate the consistency and explanatory power of the
available knowledge about the nutrient starvation response in yeast,
we have constructed a dynamic computational model based on Petri
nets (Reisig and Rozenberg, 1998). Petri nets can be depicted as
graphs that contain two kinds of nodes: places, which represent
resources and correspond to proteins and genes, and transitions,
which represent interactions between places. Interactions can be
either activations or inhibitions (Fig. 1B) and, during the course
of the execution, each resource can change its state (in a Boolean
fashion) from active to inactive (and vice versa) based on the
surrounding interactions. Given a network topology, it is possible to
execute the model and compare its behavior with the one observed
empirically.

Due to the lack of ﬁne—grained quantitative data, we captured
the coarse—grained descriptive knowledge available in the form of a
qualitative model ﬁrmly based on published experimental evidence.
This model includes the inhibition of Msn2/4 activity by TOR and
PKA (Beck and Hall, 1999; G6rner et al., 1998), which is represented
in Figure 1B by the red transitions connecting the TOR and PKA
nodes to Msn2/4. Notice that the arc connecting TOR to the transition
ends with an arrowhead, while the arc connecting the transition to
Msn2/4 ends with a bar. This means that the availability of TOR is
a necessary precondition for Msn2/4 repression. Similarly, we have
represented Rim15 inhibition by TOR, PKA and Ph080/85 (Pedruzzi
et al., 2003 and Wanke et al., 2005), the expression of STRE and
the PDS genes upon Rim15 activation of Msn2/4 and Gisl, as well
as the recently discovered proteolytic control over Gisl (Zhang and
Oliver, 2010).

Fig. 2. Multiple possible wiring choices allow reﬁnement of the model.
Fragment of the model under reﬁnement. The dashed interactions are
more accurate alternatives than the dashed interaction in Figure 1B. Two
alternative options are presented: (A) proteolytic activity induces complete
degradation of the full—length Gisl protein and simultaneous availability of
cleaved Gisl fragments. (B) Decoupling the production of cleaved Gisl
fragments and degradation of full—length protein allows partial depletion of
the full—length Gisl.

After the construction of the network model, we analyzed
its dynamics. By comparing our model with the experimental
observations (Zhang and Oliver, 2010), we discovered a signiﬁcant
discrepancy in the behavior of Gisl reproduced by the model. Our
computational results (see Supplementary Material) suggested that
only the full—length Gisl was necessary for the activation of PDS
genes. However, upon nutrient starvation or TORCl inhibition, the
abundance of full—length Gisl decreases, which does not correspond
to the increase of transcription activation of PDS genes (Zhang and
Oliver, 2010). Moreover, although full—length Gisl is essential for
PDS gene expression, the smaller Gisl fragments, resulting from
constitutive proteolysis by the proteasome, are also able to initiate
transcription upon Rim15 activation (Zhang and Oliver, 2010).
These data suggested that full—length Gisl and its smaller variants
activate the transcription of PDS genes cooperatively. Therefore,
we concluded that our model needed to be reﬁned by including
the full—length protein and the smaller fragments separately, in
order to fully capture the biological observations and increase the
model’s accuracy. Different wiring choices were possible. One
possibility, shown in Figure 2A, is to allow proteolytic activity to
induce complete degradation of full—length Gis 1. This is the behavior

observed during nutrient starvation; however, Gis1 is also subject to
a constitutive, but partial degradation by the proteasome (Zhang and
Oliver, 2010) during exponential growth. Therefore, an alternative
modeling choice is to allow partial depletion of full—length Gis 1. This
can be accomplished by decoupling the availability of the cleaved
Gis1 fragments from the complete degradation of the full—length
protein (Fig. 2B). By reﬁning our model as shown in Figure 2B, it
qualitatively reproduced (see Supplementary Material) the behavior
observed in Zhang and Oliver (2010).

3.2 Proteolytic control over Gisl allows fast recovery
from lag phase

The different causal wirings imply differences in the model behavior
and may therefore suggest different roles for the proteolytic control.
In order to understand the evolutionary advantages of the different
proteolytic controls over Gis1 in the context of nutrient response,
we were prompted to investigate its physiological role. GISI
overexpression leads to accumulation of the full—length protein and is
toxic to cell growth (Pedruzzi et al., 2000; Zhang and Oliver, 2010).
Inhibition of the proteasome function results in hyperactivation of
PDS genes in nutrient—starved conditions (Zhang and Oliver, 2010).
Knowing that growth and budding are suspended in stationary phase,
we performed an experiment to determine whether the proteolytic
control over Gis1 is necessary for survival of cells entering the
stationary phase, the recovery of cells from glucose starvation or
both.

Wild—type yeast cells were transformed with plasmid pCM190
or the same plasmid bearing the GIS] gene under the control of
the repressible promoter, tetO. Cells were grown in the presence
of doxycycline to early stationary phase, washed and resuspended
in medium with no glucose or doxycycline for 36 h. There is no
difference in viability between cells bearing the empty plasmid and
those carrying the tetO—GISI plasmid (data not shown). Glucose and
doxycycline were added to allow cells to resume growth. As shown
in Figure 3, cells harboring the tetO—GISI plasmid display a 15%
longer lag phase than those bearing the empty plasmid, suggesting
that GISI overexpression during the transition to quiescence, delays
the subsequent resumption of exponential growth on re—addition
of nutrients. These data indicate that proteolytic degradation of
Gis1 by the proteasome may provide cells with an important
evolutionary advantage, since periods of nutrient availability and
starvation are commonly experienced by microorganisms (Gasch
and Werner—Washbume, 2002).

3.3 Predicting that toxic transcriptional regulators are
subject to tighter proteolytic control

Prompted by the proteolytic regulation of Gis1 and its physiological
implications, we went on to inquire if, in general, the stress response
is restrained by the proteasome. We adopted two strategies: the
ﬁrst to discover whether toxic transcription factors are likely to be
controlled post—translationally by the proteasome, and the second to
ﬁnd out whether proteasome inhibition allows transcription factors
normally targeted by the proteasome to elicit a stress response.

3.3.] Toxic transcriptional regulators have lower half-life To
monitor the validity of our hypothesis, we performed a sequence
of bioinformatics analyses. First, we partitioned the known yeast
transcriptional regulators into two disjoint sets. The ﬁrst set

Fig. 3. Cells over—expressing Gis1 at starvation have a longer lag phase
than wild—type cells. Cells bearing either pCMl90—GIS1 or the empty vector,
pCM190, were grown (in the presence of doxycycline) for 24 h to glucose
starvation, at which point >90% of cells have no buds. Aliquots (2 m1)
of cell cultures were washed twice in SMM medium without glucose or
doxycycline, resuspended in 40 m1 of SMM, and incubated for 36 h to allow
GISI expression. At this point, glucose (2%) and doxycycline (20 pig/ml)
were added to the cultures. Growth was monitored as OD600nm.

contained 75 potentially toxic regulators and was created by ﬁltering
the set of 796 genes, whose overexpression was found to be
detrimental for cell growth (Sopko et al., 2006) using the GO
annotation ‘transcription regulator activity’ (GO:0030528). The
second set contained 251 non—toxic regulators and was built by
ﬁltering the whole yeast genome with the same GO annotation after
removing the toxic genes contained in the ﬁrst set. Detailed data are
available as Supplementary Material.

With our ﬁrst analysis, we assessed whether the protein half—lives
of toxic regulators are shorter than those of non—toxic regulators,
using the protein half—life measurements of Belle et al. (2006). Since
the measurements are not normally distributed (P < 10— 15; Shapiro—
Wilk test), we computed the Wilcoxon rank sum test under the null
hypothesis that the median difference between the two measurement
sets is zero and the alternative hypothesis that the median half—life
of the toxic transcription factors is less than that of the non—toxic
ones. The null hypothesis has been discarded with the statistically
signiﬁcant value of P=5.54 X 10—3 (Fig. 4A). Note that it was not
possible to ﬁnd measurements for all the proteins in the two sets.
We also analyzed the mRNA half—life data (Wang et al., 2002) for
the transcripts of the toxic and the non—toxic TFs and found no
signiﬁcant difference between the two (P=0.256; Wilcoxon test),
supporting the hypothesis that a signiﬁcant portion of the control
over the toxic TFs is exerted post—transcriptionally (Fig. 4B).

3.3.2 Toxic transcriptional regulators have a higher fraction
of unstructured regions The availability of many intrinsically
unstructured proteins (IUPs) is regulated via proteolytic degradation

Fig. 4. Comparison between toxic and non—toxic regulators. (A) The half—
lives of toxic regulators (red) are signiﬁcantly lower (P 25.54 x 10‘3;
Wilcoxon test) than those of non—toxic ones (blue), while (B) the median half—
life of the transcripts of toxic regulators is not signiﬁcantly different from that
of the non—toxic ones (P 20.256; Wilcoxon test). (C) The fraction of amino
acids predicted to form unstructured regions is signiﬁcantly higher in toxic
than in non—toxic proteins (P:2.48 x 10‘4; Wilcoxon test). (D) After 120
min of proteasome inhibition by MG132, transcription rates of UES genes
(P = 8.26 x 10-05; Wilcoxon test) and ESR induced genes (P < 2.2 x 10-16;
Wilcoxon test) tend to be higher than those for the rest of the genome.

(Gsponer et al., 2008). Therefore, for both the toxic and non—
toxic regulators, we computed (using Disopred2; Ward et al.,
2004) the fraction of the amino acids in each protein that is
predicted to lie within unstructured regions. We found (Fig. 4C)
that the median content of unstructured regions is higher for toxic
transcription factors than that for non—toxic regulators (P=2.48 X
10‘4; Wilcoxon test), supporting the hypothesis that proteasome—
mediated degradation plays a signiﬁcant role in the regulation of the
activity of potentially detrimental TFs.

3.3.3 Toxic TFs contain more potential PEST motifs Sequence
regions rich in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S) and threonine
(T) are found in many rapidly degraded proteins and have been
suggested to serve as signals for proteolysis (Rogers et al., 1986).
We analyzed the number of potential PEST motifs in the protein
sequences of the two classes. Using the epestﬁnd algorithm from the
EMBOSS package (Rice et al., 2000), we predicted the number of
potential PEST motifs for both sets of proteins. While 44/75 (59%)
toxic regulators contain at least one PEST motif, the ratio is 109/251
(43%) for the non—toxic ones (P value of 3.7 X 10‘2; Fisher’s exact
test). This, again, provides some support for our hypothesis on the
role of proteolysis in regulating the activity of potentially toxic TFs.

3.3.4 The proteosome modulates the expression of a signiﬁcant
fraction of genes induced by environmental stress Finally, we
investigated whether proteolytic control could contribute to
modulating the stress response by checking transcriptional changes

after proteasome inhibition. A previous study has shown that 23% of
all yeast genes (1386 mRNAs) increase their rate of transcription by
a factor of 1.5 or more (6% increase more than 2 times) after 120 min
treatment with the proteosome inhibitor MG132 (Dembla—Rajpal
et al., 2004). We extracted the data for the Universally Expressed at
Starvation (UES) genes (Wu et al., 2004); these genes are controlled
by Gis1 and Msn2—two TFs known to be under proteolytic control.
We found that the fold changes of the UES genes tend to be higher
than for the rest of the genome (P=8.26 X 10‘5 ; Wilcoxon test).
More interestingly, we observe a signiﬁcant fold increase with
respect to the rest of the genome (P < 2.2 X 10‘16; Wilcoxon test),
further extending the analysis of the effect of inhibiting proteasome
activity on the induction of gene transcription in the Environmental
Stress Response (ESR; Gasch et al., 2000; see Figure 4D).

To summarize, our work suggests that proteasome—mediated
proteolysis of TFs tightly modulates the stress response in yeast.
This hypothesis is the result of the integration of computational
and in vivo analysis. Our computational model highlighted the
particular behavior of the proteolytic control, suggesting further
in vivo investigations. Our in vivo experiments showed that, for the
Gis1 transcription factor at least, proteasome—mediated control is
crucial for a rapid return to growth after nutrient starvation, which
may give yeast cells an important selective advantage over their
competitors. Finally, our bioinformatics analyses generalized our
in vivo observations to the class of potentially toxic transcription
factors that control the stress response in yeast.

Abstract

Motivation: The need for more effective and safer pharmaceuticals is a persistent quest.
Microbial adaptations create the need to permanently develop new antimicrobials (AMPs), for
instance. Similarly, intracellular delivery of drugs is still a challenge and translocation of mem—
branes for drug delivery is an area of intense research. Peptides can be used both as AMP drug
leads and drug carrier systems for intracellular delivery. Multifunctional proteins are abundant
in viruses but, surprisingly, have never been thoroughly screened for bioactive peptide
sequences.

Results: Using the AMPA and CellPPD online tools, we have evaluated the propensity of viral
proteins to comprise AMP or cell—penetrating peptides (CPPs). Capsid proteins from both en—
veloped and non—enveloped viruses, and membrane and envelope proteins from enveloped
viruses, in a total of 272 proteins from 133 viruses, were screened to detect the presence of
potential AMP and CPP sequences. A pool of 2444 and 426 CPP and AMP sequences, respectively,
were discovered. The capsids of flaviviruses are the best sources of these peptides reaching
more than 80% of CPP sequence coverage per protein. Selected sequences were tested experi—
mentally and validated the results. Overall, this study reveals that viruses form a natural multiva—
lent biotechnological platform still underexplored in drug discovery and the heterogeneous
abundance of CPP/AMP sequences among viral families opens new avenues in viral biology
research.

1 Introduction

Viruses are molecular machines that are present in all sorts of envir—
onments and conditions, being the most abundant entity in the bio—
logical world (Arias, 2013). Traditionally considered as a threat to
most living systems, viruses are now seen also as an asset in biotech—
nological and biomedical research. Taking advantage of their nat—
ural properties, such as encapsulation of materials, self—packing, cell
internalization by diverse routes and multivalent post—translational
and chemical modifications to display surface ligands, viruses are
now important tools in the fields of nanoengineering and

nanomedicine. For instance, viral—like particles are used for gene de—
livery and viral capsid nanocapsules to incorporate bioactive com—
pounds (Douglas and Young, 2006; Usme—Ciro et 61]., 2013).

There is a constant endless quest from the scientific and pharma-
ceutical communities to find innovative approaches to overcome
issues on safety or efficacy of current drugs, such as the increased
microbial resistance to conventional antibiotics (Fox, 2013) or the
inability of most therapeutic molecules to reach their cellular targets
(Copolovici et 61]., 2014; de Figueiredo et 61]., 2014). Peptide and
protein—based drugs are good drug leads because they can find use as

Mining viral proteins for antimicrobial and cell-penetrating drug delivery peptides 2253

 

antimicrobial antimicrobial agents and/or drug delivery systems
(Copolovici et al., 2014; Fox, 2013; Koren and Torchilin, 2012).
Antimicrobial peptides (AMP, Melo et al., 2009) and cell—penetrat—
ing peptides (CPPs, de Figueiredo et al., 2014) are two classes of
peptides of which biomedical applications are expanding
(Copolovici et al., 2014; Fox, 2013). AMP (Fox, 2013; Zasloff,
2002) and CPP (de Figueiredo et al., 2014) are typically short cat—
ionic peptides, usually 5—30 amino acid residues long, that are found
in a wide diversity of natural sources from microbes to plants and
animals (Milletti, 2012). AMP and CPP sequences may result from
the identification of bioactive compounds on natural extracts, in sil-
ico analysis of natural proteins, de novo or structure—based design or
chimeras of peptide fragments (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1).
Concerning AMP and CPP from natural origin, Figure 1 shows that
only a few of them, identified up to now, rely on viral protein sour—
ces. Albeit rare, viral—based CPP are more frequent than AMP,
which is in agreement with data in the literature (Douglas and
Young, 2006; Usme—Ciro et al., 2013). Interestingly, the first CPP
that was discovered was from a viral source; Frankel and Pabo
(1988) found that the HIV—1 transcription—transactivating protein
(Tat) could enter cells and translocate into the nucleus. In addition
to Tat, there were CPP found in proteins from other viruses such as
herpes simplex (Falanga et al., 2011), herpesvirus 8 (Gautam et al.,
2012), human respiratory syncytial virus (Langedijk, 2002), hepa—
titis—B (Montrose et al., 2013), flock house virus (Nakase et al.,
2009) and alphaviruses (Langedijk et al., 2004).

More recently, our group characterized Dengue virus capsid pro—
tein (DENV C) as a supercharged protein (SCP) (Freire et al., 2013),
with ability to efficiently deliver nucleic acids into a wide range of
cells.

Two intrinsic DENV C domains with CPP properties, pepM and
pepR, were identified (Freire et al., 2014) (Supplementary Fig. 82A).
Moreover, all Flavivirus capsid proteins revealed to belong to the
SCP family suggesting that these proteins contain intrinsic cell-
penetrating domains (Freire et al., 2013).

Despite being more rare, AMP have also been found in viral pro-
teins. AMP sequences were found in proteins of hepatitis B virus,
Bacillus phage SPbeta, Bean golden mosaic virus, Lactococcus phage
mv1, Pneumococcus phage Dp—1 and Streptococcus phage Cp—1
(Waghu et al., 2014).

The rapidly expanding primary data volume on both AMP and
CPP raised the need to create systematic databases with their se—
quences, origin, activity and mode—of—action (Supplementary Table
S1 shows a summary of the available repositories on AMP and
CPP). It is noticeable that the information regarding CPP is confined
to CPPsite (Gautam et al., 2012), whereas for AMP, several data—
bases exist. A search in CAMP (Waghu et al., 2014) and CPPsite
(Gautam et al., 2012) databases shows that about 46% and 63% of
the known AMP and CPP, respectively, are from natural origin
(Fig. 1). From those, only 0.1% of the AMP and 11% of the CPP
are from viral source. In this study, we performed a thorough search
for the discovery of AMP and CPP in all structural viral proteins
available in the Viralzone database (Hulo et al., 2011) using AMPA
(Torrent et al., 2012) and CellPPD (Gautam et al., 2013) servers, re—
spectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). An AMP/CPP sequence heat
map was thus obtained for each protein. The corresponding AMP
and CPP sequences are libraries of potential antibiotic and drug de—
livery systems drug leads, respectively, to be further explored. As a
basic proof—of—principle validation of viral AMP and CPP discovery,
we screened DENV C protein for AMP (Alves et al., 2010) and CPP
(Freire et al., 2013, 2014) (Supplementary Fig. S2).

2 Meta-analysis of viral protein repositories for
AMP and CPP

The study of protein domains is highly relevant in biochemistry and
molecular biology. Researchers aim to unravel and catalog the bio—
logical function of sequences of amino acid residues. Several reposi—
tories have been created to assign, curate and predict the structure
and function of protein domains (Bateman et al., 1999; Marchler—
Bauer et al., 2010; The UniProt Consortium, 2009; Wilkins et al.,
1999). These domains vary from regions prone to post—translational
modifications (Bateman et al., 1999; Hulo et al., 2008) and catalytic
sites in enzymes (Hulo et al., 2008; Wilkins et al., 1999) to sequence
signal peptides (Hiller et al., 2004). More specific domains, such as
AMP/lytic domains, present in bacterial proteins bacteriocins (de
Jong et al., 2010; Hammami et al., 2010), and cell—penetrating pro-
tein transduction domains (van den Berg and Dowdy, 2011; Zahid
and Robbins, 2012) are also annotated. This article deals with the
discovery of AMP and CPP sequences within viral proteins, which
revealed to be a rich source for novel drugs.

The amino acid residue sequences of the structural proteins of
viruses were analyzed to detect the domains with intrinsic propen-
sity to constitute AMP or CPP. The ﬂowchart in Supplementary
Figure S1 explains the main steps for AMP/CPP screening in viral
proteins. First, the 272 annotated proteins from 133 viruses in
ViralZone (Hulo et al., 2011) were classified according to the
Baltimore system, which clusters viruses according to their type of
genome. Furthermore, the proteins were divided in three different
classes: Capsid (C), Envelope (E) and Membrane (M). Each protein
sequence was obtained from the UniProt database (The UniProt
Consortium, 2009). All the sequences were then submitted to
CellPPD (Gautam et al., 2013) for CPP identification and AMPA
(Torrent et al., 2012) to predict AMP sequences. A library of 2444
potential new CPP and a library of 426 potential new AMP were

obtained. Supplementary Section 2 and Viral_proteins.xls provide
more details regarding the predicting tools parameters and analysis
as well as the viral proteins used in the query.

We used DENV C as a model protein to validate the meta—
analysis described above. AMPA retrieved the sequence 66—99 as
AMP and CellPPD identified the entire sequence of the protein as
having CPP properties (Supplementary Fig. 82A). The peptide which
sequence corresponds to amino acid residues 67—100 from DENVC
is known as pepR and has been characterized experimentally as an
antibiotic (Alves et al., 2010) (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The whole
protein has cell—penetrating ability, which is characteristic of SCP.
This ability is maintained by the individual domains of the protein
(Freire et al., 2013, 2014) (Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, two
other proteins with well—characterized AMP and CPP domains were
also used to validate the methodology: HIV—Tat and the Human
neutrophil Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI)
(Supplementary Fig. S3). HIV—Tat is the template for one of the
‘gold standard’ CPP: tat (Frankel and Pabo, 1988; Vives et al.,
1997). The protein region comprised by amino acid residues 37—72
was targeted by CellPPD and includes the tat sequence (amino acid
residues 37—60). AMPA revealed sequences 23—44 and 47—62 as in-
trinsic AMP motifs, in agreement with experimental data (Splith
and Neundorf, 201 1).

AMPA also retrieved the BPI AMP domains, corresponding to
the sequences 84—101 and 142—162, which are included in the
21 kDa N-terminal fragment of rBP121. This fragment is known for
the strong AMP activity (Domingues et al., 2009, 2014).

CellPPD is a SVM tool trained with several proteins including
HIV—Tat but not BPI or DENV C. The CPP sequence found in Tat
reveals the self—consistency of the method. The retrieval of AMP and
CPP validated experimentally in these proteins demonstrates the ro—
bustness of the method to identify positive hits. The possibility of
false positives in the libraries of new CPP and AMP, however, re—
mained and had to be addressed experimentally. Fourteen CPP se—
quences and 15 AMP sequences were selected to be tested
experimentally for their efficacy. A broad range of conditions
(hydrophobicity, amphipathicity and hit scores) were covered
(Supplementary Information, Section 4.1, Supplementary Table S2
and Fig. S8). Cell penetration in a human cell line and antibacterial
activity against two bacterial strains reveal that very few false posi—
tives exist for CPP, in contrast with AMP. AMP found range from
moderate to extremely potent, but the fraction of false positives is
significant.

CellPPD retrieved extensive putative CPP regions in C proteins
of flaviviruses. AMP profiling, despite less consistent, is still signifi-
cantly shared over these proteins (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig.
SS). This homogeneity is not surprising because all documented fla—
viviruses C proteins are SCP (Freire et al., 2013). The same evalu—
ation was carried out for ﬂaviviruses E and M structural proteins
(Table 1, Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7). These proteins share
higher sequence conservation than C proteins (Ma et al., 2004). The
search for AMP and CPP sequences within M proteins revealed that
these proteins lack AMP sequences and are poor in CPP sequences.
As for E proteins, the results show that within the sequences, the re—
gion between amino acid residues 100 and 250 has high propensity
to be a CPP. This result is consistent with the fact that E proteins are
involved in promoting viral-host membrane hemifusion during viral
infection (Pierson and Kielian, 2013).

Table 1 summarizes the data of the occurrence of intrinsic AMP
and/or CPP sequences in each class of structural proteins from flavi-
viruses. C proteins clearly show high potential as sources for peptide
sequences with cell—penetrating properties. Moreover, data in

in CPP (%CPP) or AMP (%AMP) domains was calculated as detailed in
Section 2 of Supplementary Information for capsid, envelope and membrane
proteins from ﬂaviviruses and Viral classes according to the Baltimore classiﬁ-
cation as cataloged in Viralzone (Hulo et al., 2011). Only Viruses with charac-
terized structural protein (capsid, envelope and membrane) sequences in
UniProt were selected for the analysis. Background colors highlight different
intervals: [0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 20.0], [20.0, 30.0] and >30.0.

Table 1 are evidence that C and E proteins are important sources of
CPP and AMP in all viruses, not only ﬂaviviruses. It shows in detail
the propensity of finding AMP and CPP sequences in C, E and M
viral proteins according to Baltimore’s viral families. ssRNA(—l—) [e.g.
Flaviridae (Hepatitis C, DENV, West Nile), Togaz/iridae (Sindbis
virus, Chinkungunya), Picomaviridae (Poliovirus, Foot—and—mouth
disease virus)] and double—stranded DNA(RT) [e.g. Hepadnaz/iridae
(Hepatitis B, Cauliﬂower mosaic virus)] are the families with the
biggest relative abundance of CPP or AMP domains. It is important
to stress that all families have proteins with a significant extent of
CPP domains, ranging from nearly 9% in the envelope proteins of
double—stranded RNA to more than 30% in the C proteins of
ssRNA(—l—).

The data collected allowed identifying 426 and 2444 new
viruses—derived AMP and CPP, respectively. The similarity among
the new AMP is nil (Supplementary Information, Section 2.3).
Although there is mild similarity among new CPP, both libraries are
remarkable considering that they are the result of guided rational
drug discovery. Viruses encode, package and transport viral nucleic
acids. It is, therefore, not surprising that they contain proteins with
domains that are membrane active (AMP or CPP). The unusually
high charge density of viral C proteins, compatible with its inherent
genome binding and delivery functions is the basis for the huge po—
tential these molecules have to include AMP and CPP sequences.
Nevertheless, the incidence of CPP on specific protein classes with
preferred viral families shows this property fits specific biological
functions.

Viruses form functional macromolecular assemblies of proteins,
genomic data (RNA or DNA) and in some cases lipids, which are
geometrically organized and very elegantly built (Abrescia et al.,
2012). These entities self—assemble forming metastable structures,
interact with membranes (host and viral), while transporting nucleic
acids. Multifunctional proteins confer greater evolutionary fitness to
a virus with length—wise restrained genomes, a strategy also shared
in some bacteria such as E. coli (Ouzounis, 2000). Completely
adapted to surpass different chemical and cellular barriers to fulfill
its ultimate goal, viruses are in general composed by very few genes
(Ignacio—Espinoza et al., 2013). Thus, viral proteins must be

multifunctional entities in order to be able to perform diverse tasks
during viral infection.

3 Conclusions

The data presented in this study shows that structural viral proteins
are rich scaffolds for new AMP and CPP. Moreover, new biological
questions are raised regarding the ubiquity of AMP and cell-
penetrating properties of viral protein domains, with special inci-
dence in capsid proteins of specific viral families, such as ssDNA,
ssRNA(RT) and ssRNA(—l—).

Identifying potential AMP sequences from structural viral pro—
teins is a new tool available to biotech— and pharma companies in
their quest for new leads of AMP agents. In addition to the amino
acid sequences identified directly by the methodologies applied in
our study, the possibility of constructing chimeric drug leads makes
viral proteins—associated drug discovery and delivery even more ap—
pealing. Because of their remarkable properties, the number of pep—
tide—based drugs and drug candidates have been steadily increasing
in the past decade (Kaspar and Reichert, 2013), with more than 100
having reached the market and some already surpassed the global
sales threshold of a thousand million US$ (Craik et al., 2012). CPP
and AMP are key players in the development of innovative drug de—
livery systems (Huang et al., 2013) and reliable alternatives to con—
ventional antibiotics (Fox, 2013).

We have turned a corner from viewing viruses only as hostile ene—
mies to using them as an asset for the discovery of new AMP and
CPP leads, a research and development field restlessly seeking for
new ideas and formulations. The usage of these natural occurring
and evolutionarily optimized viral—encrusted AMP and CPP se—
quences paves the way for a new source of biotechnological leads,
enabling more rational/guided molecular designs, which may impact
directly on the advance of biomedical areas such as genetic manipula—
tion. Moreover, chemical grafting of the viral AMP and CPP to nano-
particles and nanotechnologies may be of paramount importance to
modulate their properties, combining the best of evolution and truly
intelligent design. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the method
by itself does not assure that the newly found CPP will perform better
in biomedical applications than existing ones. Regarding AMP, it is
remarkable that the method has retrieved an AMP sequence having
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) < 1 uM. This high activity
is extremely rare for membrane—targeting AMP (Melo et al., 2009).
Finding such an effective AMP is not only astonishing, it also proves
that both external and internal membranes in bacteria can be dis—
rupted with similar mechanisms, a controversial but evidence—based
hypothesis (Freire et al., 2015).

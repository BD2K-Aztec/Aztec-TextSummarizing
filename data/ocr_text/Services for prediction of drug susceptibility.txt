ABSTRACT

Summary: The HIV Drug Research Centre (HIVDRC) has established
Web services for prediction of drug susceptibility for HIV proteases
and reverse transcriptases. The services are based on two
proteochemometric models which accepts a protease or reverse
transcriptase sequence in amino acid form, and outputs the
predicted drug susceptibility values. The predictions are based on a
comprehensive analysis where all the relevant inhibitors are included,
resulting in models with excellent predictive capabilities.
Availability and Implementation: The services are implemented
as interoperable Web services (REST and XMPP), with supporting
web pages to allow for individual analyses. A set of plugins
were also developed which make the services available from the
Bioclipse workbench for life science. Services are available at
http://www.hivdrc.org/services.

1 INTRODUCTION

HIV protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) are two major drug
targets in HIV therapy with several drugs developed to inhibit their
functions. However, the HIV virus is capable to escape current
antiviral therapy directed at these targets by evolving into drug—
resistant variants with highly complex mutation patterns. Drugs
show different efﬁciency for different viral strains, and it is important
to pick the medication which most efﬁciently can block HIV on
individual patient basis. Several attempts have been made to produce
models to predict drug susceptibility based on the sequenced HIV
(Beerenwinkel et al., 2003; Liu and Shafer, 2006), but the current
models are commonly trained only on data for one drug and
hence do not make full use of the available information. Expert
systems are also present (Liu and Shafer, 2006), which build on
the experience of physicians and are hence unable to extrapolate
and predict the effect of novel mutations. The services presented
here are founded on proteochemometric models for HIV proteases
and reverse transcriptases, a technology which typically produces
accurate predictions based on more information (Kontij evskis et al.,
2008).

Susceptibility

Fig. 1. The chart displays the resulting susceptibilities of an analyzed
sequence (RT in this case) for various drugs. A positive value indicates a
reduced susceptibility for the respective drug relative to a drug sensitive
reference HIV strain, while a negative value indicates an increased
susceptibility.

2 METHODS
2.1 HIV protease drug susceptibility prediction

The proteochemometric model described in Lapins er al. (2008) allows for
prediction of drug susceptibility of seven clinically used protease inhibitors
(PIs) from the HIV protease sequence. The model is based on 828 mutated
HIV protease genome sequences and the experimental susceptibility data
for the seven protease inhibitors measured by their ability to inhibit the
replications of the respective mutated HIV variant in vitro; in total the model
is based on 4794 protease sequence—inhibitor combinations.

2.2 HIV-RT drug susceptibility prediction

The proteochemometric model described in Junaid er al. (2010)
allows for prediction of drug susceptibility of eight clinically used
nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The model
is based on 728 mutated HIV RT genome sequences and the experimental
susceptibility data for the eight NRTIs measured by their ability to inhibit
the replications of the respective mutated HIV variant in vitro; in total the
model is based on 4495 RT sequence—inhibitor combinations.

2.3 Model validation

Both proteochemometric models were thoroughly statistically validated,
among several methods using cross—validation and external predictions for
new virus isolates. The protease model was validated by double loop cross—
Validation, with inner Q2 = 0.87 and outer Q2 = 0.85. RT model was validated
by CV (Q2 20.89) and by external test set comprizing 30% of HIV isolates
(Q2 = 0.86). Q2 is an estimate of a model’s predicitve performance and ranges
from —oo to l, where 1 indicates perfect prediction (see Equation 3 in
Freyhult er al. (2005) for details on the Q2 statistic). We also performed
permutation tests to ensure that the models were not overﬁtted. See Lapins
er al. (2008) and Junaid er al. (2010) for more details on model validation.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The two services were implemented as Web services, available from
the server ws1.bmc.uu.se. The services accept a mutated PI or NRTI
sequence as input (in plain text or FASTA format), and outputs the
predicted susceptibility values. The HIV protease drug susceptibility
prediction service, and the HIV-RT drug susceptibility prediction
service were implemented as XMPP services (Wagener et al., 2009).
A REST interface was also added to both services, to provide an
additional way to invoke them. Implementation details are available
from the web page http://www.hivdrc.org/webservices. Both REST
services are registered in BioCatalogue (Bhagat et al., 2010).

Web pages were established to allow for entering sequences with
one or many mutations, and submit for prediction of susceptibility
by the two Web services with results visualized in a chart (see
Fig. l). A summarizing feature comparison between servers for
susceptibility prediction are available in Table l. Notably, only the
HIV Drug Research Centre (HIVDRC) services are available as
REST and XMPP services, making them the most interoperable
services available for HIV susceptibility prediction. EuResist (Zazzi
et al., 2011) was not included in the list as it does not predict virus
susceptibility to individual drugs but the probability of success of
common treatment regimens (combinations of 2—4 drugs) after 8
weeks of treatment.

A set of plugins were also constructed to integrate the HIVDRC
services into the graphical platform Bioclipse (Spjuth et al., 2007).
The services can be accessed both from the graphical user interface
and from scripts (Spjuth et al., 2009).

4 CONCLUSION

We here present two Web services that predict drug susceptibility for
PIs and NRTIs from the mutation patterns of different HIV strains’
genome sequences. The services are based on a comprehensive
analysis of HIV protease and RT inhibitors, using data from all
drugs in each model, resulting in a proteochemometric model with
excellent predictive ability. The implementation as Web services
allows for programmatic access to the services, and for inclusion in
workﬂows.

The binding sites for NNRTIs and NRTIs are different so these
compounds cannot be incorporated into one proteochemometric
model. A separate proteochemometric model for predictions of
NNRTI drugs is in development.

Abstract

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non—coding RNAs that play important roles in
post—transcriptional regulations as well as other important biological processes. Recently, accumu—
lating evidences indicate that miRNAs are extensively involved in cancer. However, it is a big chal—
lenge to identify which miRNAs are related to which cancer considering the complex processes
involved in tumors, where one miRNA may target hundreds or even thousands of genes and one
gene may regulate multiple miRNAs. Despite integrative analysis of matched gene and miRNA ex—
pression data can help identify cancer—associated miRNAs, such kind of data is not commonly
available. On the other hand, there are huge amount of gene expression data that are publicly ac—
cessible. It will significantly improve the efficiency of characterizing miRNA’s function in cancer if
we can identify cancer miRNAs directly from gene expression data.

Results: We present a novel computational framework to identify the cancer—related miRNAs based
solely on gene expression profiles without requiring either miRNA expression data or the matched
gene and miRNA expression data. The results on multiple cancer datasets show that our proposed
method can effectively identify cancer—related miRNAs with higher precision compared with other
popular approaches. Furthermore, some of our novel predictions are validated by both differen—
tially expressed miRNAs and evidences from literature, implying the predictive power of our pro—
posed method. In addition, we construct a cancer—miRNA—pathway network, which can help explain
how miRNAs are involved in cancer.

Identifying cancer-related microRNAs

1 Introduction

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as a large family of gene regulators, are
involved in various biological processes, such as cell development,
proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Specifically, they play
essential roles in regulating gene expression after the genes are tran—
scribed (Bartel, 2004), where one miRNA may regulate multiple
genes. It was found that more than 60% of the protein—coding genes
in the human genome are regulated by miRNAs (Esteller, 201 1).

Recently, accumulating evidences indicate that miRNAs are ex—
tensively involved in tumors (Calin and Croce, 2006). For example,
miR-21 induces invasion and metastatic capacity in colon cancer
cells (Asangani et 61]., 2008), while miR—155 up—regulation and let—
7a down—regulation can be used to predict the poor survival of lung
cancer patients (Yanaihara et 61]., 2006). In past years, the impact of
miRNAs on various cancers has been determined with biological ex—
periments (Croce, 2009; Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011).
Unfortunately, it is not feasible to detect all cancer associated
miRNAs in laboratory due to the wide range of biological processes
in which the miRNAs are involved. Recently, some computational
approaches have been proposed to predict cancer—related miRNAs.
For example, some statistical approaches have been developed to de—
tect miRNAs that are differentially expressed between normal and
cancer samples, and these miRNAs are considered related to cancer
(Kuo et 61]., 2012; Oulas et 61]., 2011). However, few of such miRNA
expression data are available compared with the huge amount of
mRNA expression data. Furthermore, the noise inherited in the ex—
pression data makes it difficult to detect the differentially expressed
miRNAs. Considering miRNAs are regulators of gene expression
and the aberrant gene expression might lead to certain diseases,
some methods have been proposed to predict disease associated
miRNAs based on the miRNA—gene regulation circuit (Chen et 61].,
2012; Li et 61]., 2011). Nevertheless, it is not an easy task to identify
cancer—related miRNAs based only on their target genes as one
miRNA may target hundreds or even thousands of genes while one
gene may be regulated by multiple miRNAs (Lim et 61]., 2005).
Furthermore, the lack of context information about the regulation
also degrades the performance of such approaches. Under the cir—
cumstances, some approaches have been developed to predict can—
cer—related miRNAs by investigating matched gene and miRNA
expression data as well as miRNA—gene regulations (Wuchty et 61].,
2013; Zhang et 61]., 2014). Unfortunately, the scarceness of matched
miRNA and gene expression datasets limits the application of this
promising approach.

Compared with the rare matched miRNA and gene expression
profiles, there are huge amounts of gene expression datasets that are
publicly available, which can help provide insights into the functions
of their miRNA regulators. In this work, we propose a novel compu—
tational framework to identify cancer associated miRNAs based on
their target genes’ expression profiles as well as the miRNA—gene
regulation network. Assuming that miRNAs are related to cancers
by regulating the pathways in which their target genes are located,
we respectively identify sets of miRNAs related to lung cancer, colon
cancer, breast cancer and gastric cancer. The benchmarking results
demonstrate the higher accuracy of our proposed method compared
with other popular approaches. The high consistency between re—
sults on independent distinct datasets for the same cancer type
implies the robustness of our proposed method. Furthermore, part
of our novel predictions are validated by both differentially ex-
pressed miRNAs and evidences from literature, indicating the pre-
dictive power of our approach. In addition, the pathways regulated
by cancer associated miRNAs can help explain how miRNAs are
involved in the initiation and progression of cancers.

2 Methods

2.1 Gene expression datasets

The gene expression datasets of four different types of cancers were
downloaded from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Edgar
et 61]., 2002), including lung cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer and
breast cancer. In particular, to evaluate the efficiency and robustness
of our proposed approach, for each cancer type, we collected two in—
dependent datasets generated under the same platform. Table 1 lists
the detailed information corresponding to each dataset.

For each dataset, the probe—level gene expression data extracted
from the CEL files were normalized with the robust multi—array
average method (Irizarry et 61]., 2003). The probes were then
mapped to genes with the annotation files obtained from GEO. For
the gene that is associated with multiple probes, we assigned it the
probe with the largest variation across its expression profile.

2.2 miRNA target genes

We firstly collected the miRNA target genes predicted with different
tools, including PicTar (Krek et 61]., 2005), miRanda (version 3.0)
(John et 61]., 2004), microT (version 5.0) (Maragkakis et 61]., 2009)
and TargetScan (release 6.2) (Lewis et 61]., 2005). All the miRNAs
were downloaded from miRBase (version 16) (Griffiths—Jones et 61].,
2006). Specifically, for one miRNA, we kept its target genes if they
were predicted by at least two tools. Note that some miRNAs will
not be considered if they do not have any target genes after the filter—
ing procedure. Then, we extended the miRNA—gene interactions by
including those deposited in TarBase (version 6.0) (Sethupathy
et 61]., 2006) that contains experimentally determined miRNA target
genes. As a result, we obtained a set of miRNA—gene interactions
involving 547 miRNAs and 6796 genes, where each miRNA targets
around 12 genes on average.

2.3 Tissue—specific miRNA expression profiles

The expression profiles of 345 miRNAs across 40 normal human tis—
sues were obtained from the supplementary files of the paper by
Liang et al. (2007). The tissue specificity score of a miRNA m,- in tis-
sue t, was defined as follows (Lee et 61]., 2008):

T81"; = (n — 1)Eii/ Z Eika (1)

k=17k74i

where E,,- denotes the expression of m,- in t,- and the same for Eik, and
n is the total number of tissues in which m,- is expressed. If T5,,- is
above a certain threshold (e.g. 1.5 here), the miRNA m,- will be re-
garded as specifically expressed in tissue t,. In particular, if a
miRNA was found to be specifically expressed in multiple tissues
with the tissue specificity score defined above, only the one in which
the miRNA has the highest abundance will be regarded as the tissue
that the miRNA is specifically expressed in. In other words, each
miRNA will be regarded as only specifically expressed in one tissue
if its tissue specificity score is above the threshold.

2.4 Cellular pathways

The predefined biological pathways were obtained from the
Molecular Signatures Database (Liberzon et 61]., 2011), which is a
large collection of annotated functional gene sets. We chose the ca—
nonical pathways from the curated (c2) gene sets in MsigDB V3.0,
which contains 880 metabolic and signaling pathways collected
from the online databases, such as BioCarta (www.biocarta.com),
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa
et 61]., 2008) and Reactome (Matthews et 61]., 2009).

2.5 Identifying cancer—related miRNAs

Figure 1 depicts the ﬂowchart of our proposed framework to iden—
tify cancer—related miRNAs based on gene expression profiles. First,
for each miRNA, we identified its target gene sets that are possibly
related to cancer. Second, the dysfunctional pathways that are asso—
ciated with cancer were detected, and those miRNA target genes en—
riched pathways were picked up. Finally, the miRNAs regulating the
above—identified pathways were ranked and those highly ranked
miRNAs are more likely to be related to cancer. The details were ad—
dressed as follows.

In general, each miRNA regulates multiple genes, where the
regulation relationships are largely dependent on temporal condi—
tions. To reduce false positives, we assumed that given a miRNA,
the expression of its target genes should ﬂuctuate in a concert way.
Therefore, given a miRNA, we clustered all its possible target genes
into different groups according to their Pearson’s correlation coeffi—
cients calculated based on their expression profiles. In the clustering
procedure, the hierarchical clustering was employed, where genes
with correlation coefficient above 0.7 were clustered into one group
while those genes that cannot be grouped into any clusters were dis—
carded. Specifically, we only kept those clusters with size larger than
three. Note that it is possible to get different number of target gene
clusters for distinct miRNAs. For each gene cluster, we further as—
sessed its discriminative ability of separating the cancers from con-
trols with support vector machines (SVMs), where the LIBSVM
toolbox implemented in R e1071 package was adopted. The classifi—
cation capacity of each cluster was evaluated by the area under
ROC curve (AUC) score with 5 —fold cross validation, where all sam—
ples were randomly split into five equal—size subsets without overlap
and four subsets were used as training set while the rest one as test
set. To evaluate the performance of each cluster in a robust way, the
5—fold cross—validation procedure was repeated for 100 times and
the mean of the AUC scores was regarded as its final score, where
the pROC package in R was utilized to calculate the AUC score.
Consequently, those gene clusters with AUC scores larger than 0.8
were considered related to cancer, and one miRNA will be regarded
as cancer miRNAs if at least one of its target clusters has good dis—
criminative capability of separating cancers from controls. The ap—
proach identifying cancer miRNAs based on its target gene clusters
was called miR_Clust here.

Generally, the cancers are caused due to the dysfunction
of cellular pathways instead of the mutation of single genes
(Liu et al., 2012). To identify those dysregulated pathways
underlying cancers, we defined the pathway’s activity score P as

P—iti/n, (2)

where n represents the number of genes in each pathway, t,- denotes

follows:

the t—score associated with the ith gene within the pathway, and the
t—score was obtained with the student’s t—test by comparing the gene
expression profiles for cancers against those for controls. Moreover,
the statistical significance of each pathway was evaluated with per—
mutation test, where the same number of genes as that in each path—
way was randomly selected and the pathway activity score was
calculated for this set of random genes. The permutation test was re—
peated for 1000 times and the ratio of random gene sets with activ—
ity score larger than the one for the pathway was regarded as the
probability of observing the pathway randomly, i.e. P—value. As a re—
sult, the pathways with P—values < 0.01 were selected as the dysfunc—
tional pathways in cancer. Given a dysfunctional pathway and a
gene cluster targeted by one miRNA, the enrichment significance
(P—value) of the pathway over the gene cluster can be calculated as

P(X2x) = 1 — 2W, (3)

7/

follows:

where N is the number of genes in the expression data, M is the
number of genes in the pathway, 11 is the number of genes in one
cluster, and k is the number of common entries between pathway
and cluster. If P—value is <0.05, the dysfunctional pathway was con—
sidered regulated by the corresponding miRNA, and the miRNA is
accordingly regarded as cancer miRNA. This procedure was re—
peated for all the target clusters of each miRNA. Note that, for each
miRNA, we identified the enriched pathways for every target cluster
instead of the pool of all target clusters as the genes in the same clus—
ter tend to be co—expressed. It was well recognized that the genes be—
longing to the same pathway tend to be co—expressed and it is
reasonable to assume the genes in one cluster are more likely to be
within the same pathway compared with those not in the same clus—
ter (Zhao et al., 2008). Furthermore, the enrichment analysis on the
pool of all genes together will cause bias toward large pathways. As
a result, for each miRNA, we may obtain a set of dysfunctional
pathways regulated by the miRNA. This approach for identifying
cancer miRNAs based on the dysfunctional pathways was called
miR_Path in this work.

In addition, we ranked the miRNAs by designing a score to
evaluate the association between miRNAs and cancer based on their
regulated pathways. For each miRNA, the score MS was defined as
follows:

2 H," >l< P,"
M. =  (4)
n

where H,- = —log (61,-), q,- denotes the P—value of pathway 1' obtained
with the hypergeometric test, P,- denotes the pathway activity score,
and n represents the number of all pathways regulated by the
miRNA. In the case of one pathway enriched in multiple target clus—
ters for one miRNA, the minimum P—value will be used for 61,-.

3 Results

3.1 Identification of cancer—related miRNAs

For the four different types of cancers considered here, we identified
the possible miRNAs associated with them with miR_Path and
miR_Clust. Furthermore, we also proposed one alternative and in—
tuitive approach, namely miR_DG, to identify cancer miRNAs
based on their target genes. In miR_DG, we assumed one miRNA to
be associated with cancer if its target genes are significantly enriched
in those that are differentially expressed between cancers and con—
trols. The differentially expressed genes were detected with student’s
t—test with correction for multiple testing by Benjamini—Hochberg
procedure (P—value cutoff of 0.05), and the hypergeometric test was
used for enrichment analysis of miRNAs’ target genes over those dif—
ferentially expressed genes with a threshold of 0.1. In this work, the
miR_DG approach was used as the baseline approach when com—
paring the performance of distinct approaches.

We also compared our methods with three other popular
approaches developed to predict cancer miRNAs, where no miRNA
expression data were considered. The IMRE approach inferred
miRNA expression levels from mRNA expression data based on puta—
tive miRNA targets, and those up—regulated or down—regulated
miRNAs in cancer were identified and regarded related to cancer
(Kuo et al., 2012). The FCS approach prioritized the cancer miRNAs

by measuring functional similarity between miRNA target genes and
known cancer genes (Li et al., 2011). Zhang’s pipeline identified can-
cer miRNAs based on the miRNA—gene regulations, where the
miRNAs that regulated the top 30% genes differentially expressed be—
tween normal and control samples were regarded as cancer miRNAs
(Zhang et al., 2014). In this work, for fair comparison, the top ranked
same number of miRNAs as those predicted by miR_Path were picked
up for these three approaches. The detailed miRNAs predicted by the
six approaches can be found in Supplementary Material Sl.

Table 2 summarizes the performance of distinct approaches on
datasets for lung cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer and breast can—
cer, and the manually curated miRNA—disease associations obtained
from the HMDD database(Lu et al., 2008) (downloaded in January
2012) were used as the gold standard. From Table 2, we can see our
proposed miR_Path and miR_Clust perform very well with compar-
able overall F1 score about 0.4 across distinct cancers, while
miR_Path performs best with respect to precision. The most intuitive
and widely used miR_DG approach performs worst possibly due to
the inherited noise in the existing miRNA—gene interactions, whereas
the clustering step in our approach can efficiently filter out those noisy
interactions and uncover true signals. From the results, we can also
see that our proposed miR_Path and miR_Clust significantly outper-
form the other three popular approaches, which illustrates the good
predictive power of our approach. The good performance of
miR_Path demonstrates that instead of their direct target genes, the
pathways regulated by miRNAs can better characterize miRNAs’
function as well as their relationship to cancer.

To evaluate the robustness of our proposed approach, for each
cancer type, we identified their associated miRNAs in two independ—
ent datasets from different laboratories but generated under the
same platform. From the results shown in Table 2, we can see that
our proposed approach has similar performance on distinct datasets
for the same cancer type, indicating the robustness of our proposed
approach. Furthermore, for each cancer type, we compared the
miRNAs identified in two different datasets as summarized in
Table 3. We used the following measure Cm to evaluate distinct
approaches, Cm : ma (1 m), / min (ma, mb), where ma and mb, re-
spectively, represents the identified miRNAs from the two datasets
of the same cancer type. As demonstrated by the results shown in
Table 3, more than 60% of the miRNAs identified by miR_Path and
miR_Clust were conserved between different datasets of the same
cancer type, implying these miRNAs are indeed related to cancers.
The miRNAs identified by miR_Clust are more conserved com—
pared with those by miR_Path possibly due to the incompleteness of
the pathway knowledge. Actually, the target gene clusters we identi—
fied here can be regarded as pathways to some extent. However,
only a very small part of the miRNAs found by miR_DG were con—
served across datasets. The overlap of our identified cancer miRNAs
between distinct datasets also demonstrates that our approach is in—
deed robust for identifying cancer miRNAs.

Considering some miRNAs are more conserved and well studied,
there is possible bias in the miRNA—gene regulations, which might
lead to the high overlap of certain miRNAs in the above results. To
see whether this is the case, we permutated the miRNA—gene inter-
action network for 1000 times while preserving the degrees of both
miRNAs and genes, and we predicted cancer miRNAs based on the
generated random interactions to see whether we can get cancer
miRNAs and high conserved overlap by chance. We calculated P—
value for random miRNAs as the probability of observing them
with higher F1 score than our predicted miRNAs, and the P—value
for conserved miRNAs as the probability of finding random miRNAs
that have higher overlap between two datasets than our predicted

miRNAs (details can be found in Supplementary Material S2).
The low P—values for both cancer miRNAs and their conservation
indicate the statistical significance of our proposed approach.

Since the common miRNAs predicted from two independent
datasets for the same cancer type are more convincible, we will focus
on those common miRNAs hereinafter. For each cancer type, we
ranked their related miRNAs according to the miRNA scores (MS).
In particular, the miRNAs with MS large than the mean of all pre-
dicted miRNAs were selected as the top ranked miRNAs (HRmiRs).
Note that the HRmiRs are a subset of the common miRNAs identi-
fied from two datasets. The HRmiRs identified for the four cancer
types can be found in Supplementary Material S3. Figure 2 shows
the precision of HRmiRs, predicted miRNAs conserved between
two independent datasets (OmiRs) and all identified miRNAs
(AmiRs) by miR_Path for the four cancer types, where the cancer
miRNAs from HMDD were used as gold standards. Not surpris—
ingly, the HRmiRs achieve the highest precision among the three
sets of miRNAs, indicating that the miRNAs with higher MS are
more likely to be related to cancers. Among the HRmiRs, we noticed
that most of them are related to cancer although some of them are
not specifically associated with certain cancer type. For example,
among the 41 HRmiRs identified from the colon cancer datasets, 19
miRNAs are reported related to at least one cancer type according
to HMDD except the 18 colon cancer miRNAs (Supplementary
Material S3). In other words, about 90% (37/41) of the HRmiRs are
known to be related to cancer. These results demonstrate that
HRmiRs are indeed related to cancer and provide insights into the
molecular underpinnings of cancer from another perspective.

From the results, we can clearly see that our proposed miR_path
can identify cancer miRNAs with high precision even without the
presence of miRNA expression data, confirming again the efficiency
of the proposed approach.

3.2 Validation of predicted cancer miRNAs

Except for the gold stand cancer—miRNA associations deposited in
HMDD, to validate our predictions, we retrieved four independent
miRNA expression datasets for the four cancers, where the miRNAs
that were differentially expressed between normal and cancer

samples were considered related to cancer. If our predicted cancer
miRNAs are also differentially expressed miRNAs (DemiRs), they
are more likely related to cancer, which can validate our predictions
to some extent. Table 4 summarizes the number of miRNAs identi-
fied by our approach and those DemiRs as well as their overlaps,
where the DemiRs were detected with paired student’s t—test (P—
value cutoff of 0.05) and the predicted miRNAs are those over—
lapped between two datasets for the same cancer type. From the re—
sults, we can see that most of our predictions can be validated by
DemiRs in lung cancer and breast cancer. For gastric cancer, about
half of the DemiRs can be found by our approach. All these results
demonstrate that our predictions are convincible, and the results
also indicate the high precision of miR_path, which is consistent
with the benchmark results described above.

Moreover, we also verified our predictions by querying PubMed,
and found that some of our predictions have already been reported
in literature. For example, for the GSE13911 and GSE19826 data—
sets of gastric cancer, we respectively identified 16 and 13 miRNAs
that are not recorded related to gastric cancer according to HMDD
but were DemiRs. By searching PubMed, we found that some of
these miRNAs have already been reported to affect gastric cancer in
literature. For example, miR—29c was found to be significantly
down—regulated in advanced gastric carcinoma and play a role of
tumor—suppresser through its target gene RCC2 to confer a growth

Fig. 2. Precision of miRNAs identified to be associated with different cancer
types. HRmiRs: top ranked miRNAs; OmiRs: overlapping miRNAs identified
from two datasets; AmiRs: all miRNAs identified to be related to certain can-
cer type

advantage on gastric tumor cells (Matsuo et al., 2013), and miR—26a
was strongly down—regulated and inhibited cell proliferation in gas-
tric cancer (Deng et al., 2013a, b).

These evidences imply that our novel predictions may be indeed
related to gastric cancer.

3.3 Cancer—miRNA association network

Based on the HRmiRs identified for each cancer type, we further
constructed a cancer—miRNA association network as shown in
Figure 3, where a cancer type will be linked to one miRNA if this
miRNA is predicted to be related to the cancer type by miR_Path.
The association network gives a clear global view about the relation—
ship between miRNAs and cancers, from which we can see that
some miRNAs are associated with a specific type of cancer while
some others are related to at least two cancer types.

Focusing on the miRNAs that are specifically associated with
certain types of cancer, we verified these cancer type—specific
miRNAs by checking whether these miRNAs are specifically ex—
pressed in the tissues that the specific cancer origins from. With the
miRNA expression data across 40 normal human tissues (Liang
et al., 2007), we identified 16 miRNAs for colon, 15 for lung, 21 for
stomach and 6 for breast (Supplementary Material S4), where these
miRNAs are both specifically expressed in the corresponding tissues
and predicted to be related to cancer. In addition, query results from
PubMed indicate that most of these tissue—specific miRNAs have al—
ready been reported related to the corresponding cancer types. For
example, mir—195 was found to be significantly down—regulated in
gastric cancers and treatment with mir—195 strikingly suppressed the
growth of gastric cancer cell (Deng et al., 2013a, b), and mir—195
can be used as the prognosis biomarker of gastric cancer (Brenner
et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2011). The abnormal expression of mir-137
has been found involved in the progression and metastasis of colo—
rectal cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer
(Balaguer et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2013). More evidence about the
association between tissue—specific miRNAs and cancer types can be
found in Table 5. The tissue specificity of cancer type—specific
miRNAs implies that these miRNAs are indeed related to specific
cancer types, which will otherwise not be found without the cancer—
miRNA association network. The consistence between tissue—spe—
cific miRNAs and cancer type-specific miRNAs confirm again that
our identified miRNAs are indeed related to cancers.

3.4 Cancer—miRNA—pathway association network

In the cancer—miRNA association network, there are some miRNAs
that are associated with multiple cancers. These multiple—cancers asso—
ciated miRNAs may regulate the common biological processes across
diverse cancer types and therefore play important roles in cancer

Fig. 3. The cancer-miRNA association network. In the network, the miRNAs in
the inner circle are predicted related to at least two cancer types

initiation and progression. Next, we focused on the 47 miRNAs that
are associated with at least two cancer types as well as the pathways
they regulate by extending the cancer—miRNA network to a cancer—
miRNA—pathway network (CMP network) as shown in Figure 4,
where only three outstanding miRNAs families (let-7, miR—200 and
miR-29) and some related miRNAs (miR—16, miR-524-5p and miR-
520d—5p) were shown for clearness. The complete network can be
found in Supplementary Material S5. In Figure 4, we only showed the
KEGG pathways that have been well categorized.

In the network, the let—7 family is notably associated with mul—
tiple cancer types, and has been found to acts as tumor suppressors
for lung and colon cancer (Akao et al., 2006; Shell et al., 2007;
Takamizawa et al., 2004). The members of the let—7 family are mas—
ter regulators of cell proliferation pathways by targeting RAS and
MYC oncogenes (Johnson et al., 2005; Sampson et al., 2007). It is
found that the epithelial cells undergo abnormal cell divisions when

let—7 is inactivated (Lu et al., 2005), indicating the lower expression
level of let—7 in tumor during cancer development. As shown in the
CMP network, the let—7 family acts as tumor suppressor by regulat—
ing some important cancer—related pathways, such as P53 signaling
pathway, E2F mediated regulation of DNA replication pathway,
cell cycle mitotic pathway and DNA repair pathway. The miR-200
family was found to regulate the epithelial—mesenchymal transition
and tumor metastasis by targeting the mRNA of E-cadherin tran-
scriptional repressors ZEB1 and ZEB2, two important transcrip-
tional repressors of the cell adherence and polarity (Aigner et al.,
2007; Comijn et al., 2001). The three members, i.e. miR-29a, miR-
29b and miR-29c of the miR-29 family are known as anti—oncomirs.
They can impact epigenetic alteration in tumor cells (Fabbri et al.,
2007) by reverting DNA methylation through their direct targets,
DNA methyltransferases 3A (Dnmt3a) and 3B (Dnmt3b), in lung
cancer tissues. It has been found that the overexpression of miR-29a
significantly reduces the invasiveness and proliferation phenotypes
in lung cancer cell lines (Muniyappa et al., 2009). Another study in—
dicates that miR—29 family can up—regulate P53 by targeting P85
and CDC42 (Park et al., 2009). In the CMP network, the miR-29
family regulates the PDGF pathway. PDGF regulates diverse differ—
entiation and proliferation pathways and promotes tumor growth
via autocrine stimulation of malignant cells, and PDGF receptors
were found to be critical for the PI3K/AKT activation and negatively
regulated by mTOR (Wu et al., 2008). It can be seen that the path—
ways regulated by miR—29 family can help interpret how it is
involved in the development of cancer.

Among the miRNAs, miR—16 was predicted to be associated with
all four types of cancers. miR—16 is among the miRNAs that were
firstly found to be associated with cancer development in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (Calin et al., 2002), where miR—16 acts as a
tumor suppressor and was found to be deleted or down—regulated in
tumor cells (Calin et al., 2005 ). As shown in the CMP network, miR-
16 regulates the P5 3 signaling pathway and the E2F mediated regula—
tion of DNA replication pathway, indicating the important roles of
miR-16 in cancer. miR—524—5p was not only found to regulate the

WNT pathway but also regulate two APC—related pathways in the
CMP network, indicating the important role of miR—524-5 p in tumor.
miR—520d—5p was found to regulate the Notch signaling pathway
which in turn regulates ﬂ—catenin to cooperate with the WNT path—
way while tumor formation (Klaus and Birchmeier, 2008). It can be
seen that the cross—talks between above miRNAs and pathways help
us understand how the miRNAs are involved in the tumor process.

We also noticed that miR—548c—3p was predicted to be associ—
ated with three types of cancers although it is not reported to be
related to any type of cancer in HMDD. In the CMP network, miR-
548c—3p was found to regulate the cell cycle related pathways, DNA
repair pathway and the stabilization of P53 pathway. Recently,
miR—548c—3p was identified as a mediator of the expression of topo—
isomerase IIoc (TOP2A) that plays critical roles in maintaining DNA
topology after replication (Srikantan et al., 2011). miR—548c—3p
represses the expression of TOP2A by binding to its 3’ UTR region
in a competition with Human antigen R (HuR) that is an RNA-
binding protein stabilizing and modulating the translation of its tar—
get mRNAs. Recently, HuR was found to be commonly overex—
pressed in cancers (Abdelmohsen and Gorospe, 2010; Dixon et al.,
2001; Lopez de Silanes et al., 2005). Therefore, we assumed that
miR—548c—3p is related to cancer by regulating TOP2A through the
competition with HuR, where the dysregulation of TOP2A
will affect the DNA stabilization. Our prediction is also
supported by a recent study that reports mir—548c—3p was signifi-
cantly down—regulated in different pathological grades of hepatocel—
lular carcinoma (Noh et al., 2013).

In summary, the CMP network constructed here provides in—
sights into the molecular underpinnings of cancer and can help to in-
terpret how the miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of cancers
through the cellular pathways that they regulate.

4 Discussion

The miRNAs are important regulators of gene expression, the aber—
rant function of which may drive the initiation and development of
cancer. However, the global cancer—miRNA association landscape is
far from complete and only a limited number of miRNAs are known

Identifying cancer-related microRNAs

related to cancer, which hinders the development of miRNA based
therapeutic strategies. In literature, some computational approaches
have been developed to detect which miRNAs are associated with
which cancer types, among which the integrative analysis of
matched gene and miRNA expression profiles is one of the most
promising approaches. Unfortunately, the matched gene and
miRNA expression profiles are not commonly available. On the
other hand, the large amount of public accessible gene expression
data provides an alternative way to investigate the associations be—
tween miRNAs and cancers. In general, the existing approaches util—
ize the predicted miRNA—gene regulations to identify the cancer
associated miRNAs, whereas the noise in the regulation relationship
as well as the lack of the context information about these regula—
tions may degrade the performance of those promising approaches.

In this work, we developed a novel framework to identify cancer
miRNAs based on gene expression data and miRNA—gene regulations.
Unlike existing approaches, we proposed a new technique to filter out
those noisy and false regulations based on gene expression data, and
detected cancer miRNAs. The benchmark results on four distinct can-
cer datasets demonstrate the predictive power of our proposed
method, and the good performance on multiple independent datasets
for the same cancer type indicates the robustness of the proposed ap—
proach. Furthermore, among our predicted cancer miRNAs, some of
them have been reported in literature and some are found to be differ—
entially expressed based on independent miRNA expression datasets,
which validate our predictions to some extent. With a cancer—miRNA
association network constructed here, we also detected some pan—
cancer miRNAs and cancer type—specific miRNAs, thereby providing
insights into the mechanism of cancers. In particular, we identified the
pathways regulated by cancer miRNAs, which can help explain how
miRNAs are involved in cancers.

The good performance of our proposed approach attributes to the
removal of noisy interactions between miRNAs and genes. In this work,
we detected the context specific target genes of miRNAs with the as—
sumption that they will ﬂuctuate together if they were regulated by the
same miRNA(s). However, that is not the case if two genes are, respect—
ively, regulated by two sets of miRNAs while share few miRNAs, where
we can only detect the major regulators of these genes. The integrative
analysis of matched miRNA and gene expressions has shown to be
promising approach in determining the miRNA—gene regulations. We
believe the performance of our proposed approach will be significantly
improved if such kind of data could be integrated in our framework in
the future. In addition, we only considered around 500 miRNAs here,
but there are more than 2000 human mature miRNAs recorded in
miRBase now. Our approach can be easily extended to the new
miRNAs as long as their target genes are available. With more informa—
tion about miRNAs as well as their target genes emerging, more cancer
miRNAs are believed to be discovered in the future.

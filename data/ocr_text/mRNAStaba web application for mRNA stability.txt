ABSTRACT

Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated both at the transcription and
the mRNA degradation levels. The implementation of functional
genomics methods that allow the simultaneous measurement of tran-
scription (l' R) and degradation (DR) rates for thousands of mRNAs is a
huge improvement in this field. One of the best established methods
for mRNA stability determination is genomic run-on (GRO). It allows
the measurement of DR, TR and mRNA levels during cell dynamic
responses. Here, we offer a software package that provides improved
algorithms for determination of mRNA stability during dynamic GRO
experiments.

Availability and implementation: The program mRNAStab is freely
accessible at http://mRNAStab.uv.es/. mRNAStab is written in C, PHP
and R.

1 INTRODUCTION

mRNA is the messenger molecule transferring information from
genes to proteins. It is by its own nature and function unstable
(see Parker 2012; Pérez—Ortin et al., 2007 for discussion). There is
a variable turnover that depends on synthesis (transcription rate,
TR) conducted by RNA polymerase II and degradation rate
(DR) conducted by a complex system of RNases and other pro-
teins or RNAs (Parker, 2012). The importance of TR in deter-
mining the levels of mRNAs is widely documented; however, the
parallel importance of DR in it is only starting to be recognized
(Pérez—Ortin et al., 2007).

There are several methods currently available for DR deter-
mination. Some of them are able to measure mRNA stabilities
genome-wide (see Chen et al., 2008; Schwalb et al., 2012 and
Supplementary Data for a critical description and comparison).
The most popular, although prone to mistakes and biases
(Marin-Navarro et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2002), is the transcrip-
tion shut-off and subsequent determination of mRNA decay:
assuming ﬁrst-order kinetics, the degradation constant (kd) and
the mRNA half-life (HL 2 ln2/kd) can be calculated.

The TR and mRNA concentrations can be determined
genome-wide by using a genomic run-on protocol (GRO),
which allows to estimate the HLs of mRNAs even under non
steady-state conditions (Fan et al., 2012; Garcia-Martinez et al.,

2004). This possibility is extremely interesting because it allows to
determine TR, mRNA levels and HLs in a single experiment
during the fast transcriptional response to an imposed environ-
mental change (Castells-Roca et al., 2011 and references therein).
This is the simplest protocol currently available for monitoring
mRNA turnover in dynamic situations. However, it involves
complex numerical analysis and costly computing. Now we de-
scribe here the mRNAStab package that offers two alternative
algorithms (programs ‘StepK’ and ‘RampK’) for determining
mRNA HLs from data generated by GRO experiments.
Additionally, it also includes a program (‘Shutoff’) to calculate
kd from simple decay experiments Wang et al., 2002). All three
programs are devised to cope with genome-wide data [TR and/or
(mRNA) time sequences for thousands of genes].

2 WHAT THE PROGRAMS DO

Typically, the GRO experiment delivers values of TR (TRO, TR1,
TR2. . .) and mRNA concentration ([mRNA]0, [mRNA]1,
[mRNA]2. . .) simultaneously determined at discrete times
(to, t1, t2,...). By assuming a linear variation of TR for a
particular gene between consecutive pointwise determinations
(e. g. values of TR and [mRNA] at to and t1) with slope p:

P = (TR1 - TR0)/(t1 — t0) (1)

A mean value for the ﬁrst-order degradation constant (kd)
throughout the considered time interval can be determined
(Pérez—Ortin et al., 2007; see Supplementary Data). This calcula-
tion is sequentially translated to subsequent intervals and after-
wards to all genes. A program following this procedure has been
already available for spreadsheets (Marin-Navarro et al., 2011),
but a faster version (in C) is now included in mRNAstab with the
name of StepK.

An inconvenient feature of StepK is that mean values for
kd jump stepwise from one interval to the next. A more realistic
change would be to suppose that kd varies also linearly in
between sample points as TR is assumed to do. Under these
conditions, the rate of mRNA change for a gene would be

d[IIIRNAVdt = TRo + p (t - to) - [(kd)0 + C1(t - t0)] [mRNA]
(2)

where q is the (unknown) rate of kd change with time, assumed
constant for the time interval under consideration. For the first
interval (between to and t1), the initial value of kd [i.e. (kd)0] is
calculated supposing an initial steady state (as time 0 is usually
taken before the onset of the environmental change triggering the

transcriptional response) as TRO divided by [mRNA]0. The
RampK program integrates numerically Equation (2) for the
considered time interval by Euler’s method taking a random
initial q value. This value is contrasted by checking the difference
between the calculated and experimental value of mRNA con-
centration at the end of the interval and iteratively reﬁned
through a bisection algorithm. Once the value of q has been
determined to a chosen precision, the ﬁnal value of (kd)1 (i.e.
the value of kd at t1) is calculated as:

(kd)1 = (kd)0 + q (t1 — t0) (3)

and this is used as initial value of kd for integrating the next
interval (between t1 and t2). Similarly, the procedure is extended
to subsequent intervals and further to all genes.

Therefore, under slightly different assumptions, both pro-
grams (StepK and RampK) deliver a time course for kd from
experimental determinations of TR and mRNA concentration
sampled at a sequence of time points. StepK estimates a mean
value of kd for each interval, whereas RampK gives the kd values
at the interval extremes assuming a linear time course between
them. Shutoff is an additional program included in this website
to treat data of mRNA decay after transcriptional arrest
Wang et al., 2002). Thus, data will be mRNA concentrations
at different time points. Shutoff calculates kd ﬁtting these data to
an exponential decay by minimizing square deviations.

3 STRUCTURE OF THE WEBSITE

We offer a novel implementation of a website holding the algo-
rithms described previously. The user has the chance to work
with a set of well-known tools, all gathered in a user-friendly
web application. The algorithms run on our server. It introduces
the notion of Experiment, which contains one or more
Operations, including Input, Output and Settings as child notions
for the latter.

The input ﬁle must have a TR and/or an RA set of columns,
each one having the time in the header. If one of the types is
missing, neither StepK nor RampK can run. Furthermore, the
first column always contains the unique names of the genes
analysed. The application consists of three layers: the UI, the
algorithms and the storage, built using the YII framework. It
can be viewed as three-tier architecture (Fig. 1), using different
languages at each level. The ﬁrst one uses PHP with J avaScript/
HTML/CSS. It controls the algorithms execution written in R
(UPGMA, Sota, Kmeans—not implemented by us—and
Shutoff), C (StepK and RampK) and PHP (Filtering). The last
layer consists of the ﬁle system (storing of the inputs/outputs of
each algorithm) and the database (store the successfully executed
operations for a registered user).

4 USAGE AND APPLICATION

One can create an account or to use the application anonym-
ously. Both cases offer the same features when it comes to cap-
abilities. The difference between them lies in the possibility to
save the experiments with their history, inputs and results when
an account is used. A user must upload his/her ﬁle, and then

5 CONCLUSIONS

We offer a web application to analyse the stability of the genes
from microarray data. It contains two new applications capable
of estimating the degradation constant (kd) and, therefore, the
mRNA stability for a list of time points of TR and mRNA.

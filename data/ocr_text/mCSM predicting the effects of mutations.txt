ABSTRACT

Motivation: Mutations play fundamental roles in evolution by introdu-
cing diversity into genomes. Missense mutations in structural genes
may become either selectively advantageous or disadvantageous to
the organism by affecting protein stability and/or interfering with inter-
actions between partners. Thus, the ability to predict the impact of
mutations on protein stability and interactions is of significant value,
particularly in understanding the effects of Mendelian and somatic
mutations on the progression of disease. Here, we propose a novel
approach to the study of missense mutations, called mCSM, which
relies on graph-based signatures. These encode distance patterns
between atoms and are used to represent the protein residue envir-
onment and to train predictive models. To understand the roles of
mutations in disease, we have evaluated their impacts not only on
protein stability but also on protein—protein and protein—nucleic acid
interactions.

Results: We show that mCSM performs as well as or better than other
methods that are used widely. The mCSM signatures were success-
fully used in different tasks demonstrating that the impact of a muta-
tion can be correlated with the atomic-distance patterns surrounding
an amino acid residue. We showed that mCSM can predict stability
changes of a wide range of mutations occurring in the tumour sup-
pressor protein p53, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed
method in a challenging disease scenario.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background

Mutations play fundamental roles in evolution by introducing
diversity into genomes, most often through single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). Non-synonymous single nucleotide sub-
stitutions (nsSNPs) are of particular interest, as they can disrupt
function by interfering with protein stability and/ or interactions
with partners. Such mutations can be selectively advantageous in
evolution or they may cause a change in stability often leading to

malfunction and resulting in disease. Thus, predicting the im-
pacts of mutations in proteins is of major importance to under-
standing function, not only of molecules and cells but also of the
whole organism.

Mutagenesis studies that experimentally determine free en-
ergy differences between wild-type and mutant proteins
(Fersht, 1987) produce accurate results but are usually costly
and time-consuming. However, the advent of databases with ex-
perimental thermodynamic parameters for both wild-type and
mutant proteins such as ProTherm and ProNIT (protein-nucleic
acid) (Kumar et al., 2006) and more recently the SKEMPI (Moal
and Fernandez-Recio, 2012), which describes protein—protein
complexes, has been helpful to the study of mutations on a
larger scale. These provide an experimental basis for novel in
silico paradigms, models and algorithms to study more exten-
sively missense mutations and their impacts on protein stability
and function.

The several different approaches used to study the impacts of
mutations on protein structure and function can be broadly clas-
sified into those that seek to understand the effects of mutations
from the amino acid sequence of a protein alone, and those that
exploit the extensive structural information now available for
many proteins. The ﬁrst group includes well-established and
widely used sequence-based methods such as SIFT (Ng and
Henikoff, 2003) and PolyPhen (Adzhubei et al., 2010). Here,
we focus on the second approach that takes advantage of the
protein structural information that has been accumulated on the
impact of mutations within the 3D space of a natively folded
protein.

Structure-based approaches, which may be categorized as ma-
chine learning methods and potential energy functions, typically
attempt to predict either the direction of change in protein sta-
bility on mutation (as a classiﬁcation task) or the actual free
energy value (AAG) as a regression task. Machine learning-
based methods have been combined with structure-based
computational mutagenesis as a four-body statistical contact po-
tential in Masso and Vaisman (2008). Support vector machines
have been used to predict changes in stability from either protein
sequence or structure descriptors (Capriotti et al., 2005a, b;
Cheng et al., 2005) and more recently to predict disease-related
mutations (Capriotti and Altman,2011). There have also been
recent attempts to predict the stability changes on multisite
mutations (Tian et al., 2010). Machine learning methods have
proven to be powerful predictive tools, even when data on which
to train the methods have not been extensively available.

The second set of methods is based on potential energy func-
tions. Environment-speciﬁc substitution tables, which describe the
propensities of residues to mutate in a certain protein-structural en-
vironment during evolutionary time, have been used to derive a
statistical potential energy function used by the method SDM
(Topham et al., 1997; Worth et al., 2011). In the PoPMuSiC
method (Dehouck et al., 2009), the estimated stability change on
mutation is expressed as a linear combination of 26 different
energy functions, whose parameters were trained using an artiﬁcial
neural network. Empirical energy functions have also been used in
a method that performed Monte Carlo optimization (Bordner and
Abagyan, 2004), which has also been used to study the role of
conformational sampling as a way to assess the impact of single-
point mutations in protein structures (Kellogg et al., 2011).

Although there have been attempts to predict the afﬁnities of
particular protein—protein complexes (Moal et al., 2011; Yan
et al., 2013), there has been much less attention to the challenge
of predicting the impact of mutations on afﬁnity in large sets of
protein—protein and protein—DNA complexes. A signiﬁcant ex-
ception has been the report of Guerois et a]. (2002) on predicting
the effects of mutations in a set of 82 protein—protein complexes.
Another important study refers to the identiﬁcation of binding
energy hot spots in protein complexes by predicting the impact of
mutations to alanine in >200 mutations (Kortemme and Baker,
2002). More recently, a method derived from PoPMuSiC, called
BeAtMuSiC (Dehouck et al., 2013), has been developed to pre-
dict the impacts of mutations on protein—protein afﬁnities for a
set of 81 proteins.

An alternative approach to study mutations is to represent
residue environments as graphs where nodes are the atoms and
the edges are the physicochemical interactions established among
them. For instance, the method Bongo (Cheng et al., 2008)
attempts to predict structural effects of nsSNPs by evaluating
graph theoretic metrics and identifying key residues using a
vertex cover algorithm. From these graphs, distance patterns
can also be extracted and summarized in a structural signature,
which may then be used as evidence to train predictive models.
Da Silveira et a]. (2009) ﬁrst reported the use of inter-residue
distance patterns or signatures to deﬁne protein contacts,
demonstrating that they are conserved across protein folds.
The Cutoff Scanning Matrix (CSM) is a protein structural sig-
nature (Pires et al., 2011) successfully used in large-scale protein
function prediction and structural classiﬁcation tasks. Pires et a].
(2013) extended the inter-residue signature to an atomic level
(aCSM) and successfully applied it in large-scale receptor-based
protein ligand prediction.

Here, we use the concept of graph-based structural signatures
to study and predict the impact of single-point mutations on
protein stability and protein—protein and protein—nucleic acid
afﬁnity. The approach, called mutation Cutoff Scanning
Matrix (henceforth called mCSM), encodes distance patterns
between atoms to represent protein residue environments.

1.2 Method outline

The mCSM signatures are calculated in two steps:

0 For a given mutation site, we deﬁne the wild-type residue
environment by the atoms within a distance r from its

geometric centre. A pairwise distance calculation between
the atoms of the environment generates an atom distance
matrix, which accounts for a wide spectrum of distances,
from short to long range. From this matrix, distance pat-
terns are then extracted and summarized as a feature vector;

0 To account for the atom changes induced by the mutation,
we introduce a ‘pharmacophore count’ vector. Each one of
the 20 amino acid residues is represented by a different
vector, where each position denotes the frequency of a cer-
tain pharmacophore in that residue. The difference vector
between the wild-type and mutant pharmacophore vectors is
then appended to the signature.

Thus, each mutation is represented as a signature vector that is
used to train and test predictive machine learning methods in
regression and classiﬁcation tasks. In Section 2, we describe in
detail how the signatures are calculated and the data sets used
in this study.

1.3 Summary of results

We show that the mCSM signatures can be used successfully to
tackle different tasks related to the prediction of the impacts of
mutations in proteins. We have conducted a series of compara-
tive experiments that indicate that mCSM performs as well as or
better than several other widely used methods. mCSM is able
to predict not only the direction of the change in stability of
proteins and afﬁnity of protein—protein and protein—DNA com-
plexes but also the actual numerical experimental value, with
correlation coefﬁcients up to 0.824 for a large data set of muta-
tions. We have also applied our methodology to predict changes
of stability resulting from mutations occurring in the tumour
suppressor protein p53. mCSM outperforms other methods,
demonstrating its applicability to understanding mutations that
lead to disease.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 mCSM: graph-based signatures

Here, we extend the concept of the inter-atomic distance patterns to a
residue environment called mCSM. mCSM signatures can be divided into
three major components:

0 Graph-based atom distance patterns: The major components of
the signatures are distance patterns in the vicinity of the wild-type
residue encoded as a cumulative distribution. The wild-type residue
environment, which here is deﬁned as the set of atoms within a dis-
tance r from its geometric centre, can be modelled as a contact graph,
where the atoms are the nodes and the edges are deﬁned by a cutoff
distance. In this way, the signatures encode distance patterns by
varying the edge-deﬁning cutoff distance, used in computing the
number of edges of the resulting atomic contact graph. A cumulative
distribution is obtained from an atom distance matrix, which is a
pairwise distance calculation between atoms of the environment.
Here, as in a previous study (Pires et al., 2013), we use three types
of atom classiﬁcation to segment the cumulative distribution: one
class (no distinction between atoms), a binary classiﬁcation (atoms
labelled as polar or hydrophobic) and using the Pmapper pharma-
cophoric classiﬁcation, which classiﬁes atoms into eight possible
categories: hydrophobic, positive, negative, hydrogen acceptor,
hydrogen donor, aromatic, sulphur and neutral. mCSM considers

Fig. 1. Predicting the impact of mutations with mCSM. (a) Highlights important steps in the methodology and how the main components of the
signatures are computed. Here, we use as an example the published crystal structure of p53 (PDB ID: 2OCJ), considering the mutation site R282W,
further discussed in Section 3.3. Given a mutation site in a wild-type protein, its structural environment is extracted and the distance patterns among the
atoms summarized in the mCSM signature. To take into account the change in atom types due to the mutation, a pharmacophore count is performed for
the wild-type and mutant residue. The changes in pharmacophore count are then appended into the signature, which is used to train/test predictive
models. The considered pharmacophore types are eight: hydrophobic (green), positive (blue), negative (red), hydrogen acceptor (red), hydrogen donor
(blue), aromatic (green), sulphur (yellow) and neutral (white). (b) Summarizes the mCSM predictive workﬂow that can be divided into the following
steps: gathering and preprocessing the thermodynamic and structural data, extracting the residue environments, signature calculation and noise reduc-
tion, supervised learning and mutation impact prediction and validation

only the residue environment in the wild-type protein. In this way,
our method is applicable even when no mutant structures are avail-
able. Furthermore, it does not require the generation of homology
models.

Pharmacophore changes: To take into account the changes in atom
types due to the mutation, a ‘pharmacophore count’ vector is intro-
duced. Wild-type and mutant residues are represented as pharmaco-
phore frequency vectors as shown in the lower part of Figure la and
calculated as follows. Let L be a set of pharmacophore types and f a
labelling function that assigns a pharmacophore [E L to a given
atom x: f(x) = l. The frequency of each type of pharmacophore in
a residue is then summarized in a vector p. The difference pchmge
between pharmacophore count for mutant (pm) and wild-type (pm)
residue is calculated (pchange 2 pm, — pm) and appended to the signa-
ture. The atom pharmacophores are characteristics described by

PMapper and belong to eight possible classes: hydrophobic, positive,
negative, hydrogen acceptor, hydrogen donor, aromatic, sulphur and
neutral.

0 Experimental conditions: The experimental conditions, in which the
thermodynamic data, such as pH and temperature are collected, are
also appended to the signatures when available. Relative solvent
accessibility of the residue is also included.

Figure 1b summarizes the mCSM prediction workﬂow as follows:
preprocessing the thermodynamic and structural data, extracting the resi-
due environments, signature calculation and noise reduction, supervised
learning and mutation impact prediction and validation.

Algorithm 1 shows the function that calculates the proposed mCSM
signature, which requires the following input parameters: a set of

mutations, wild-type structure and the atomic categories (or pharmaco-
phore) to be considered, a cutoff range (D MIN and DMAX) and a cutoff
step (DSTEP) in which each cutoff is discretized. For each mutation the
residue environment is calculated based on a cutoff distance, selecting all
interacting atoms in the residue vicinity. The pairwise distances between
all pairs of atoms of the residue environment are then calculated and
stored in a distance matrix. The distance matrix is scanned considering
the cutoff range and cutoff step generating a cumulative distribution of
the distances by atomic category. Finally, the pharmacophoric changes
between wild-type and mutant residue are appended to the signature as
well as the experimental conditions (pH and temperature) and residue
relative solvent accessibility. The generated signatures are then used as
evidence to train predictive classiﬁcation and regression models.

The main goal of the mCSM signatures is to encode and concisely
summarize atomic-distance patterns in the vicinity of a residue that can
be correlated to the impact of a mutation. Even though interference with
short-distance interactions (e.g. the creation or disruption of hydrogen
bonds) is the most direct effect of mutations, mCSM signatures also take
into account long-range distance patterns, in contrast with the majority of
other approaches described in the literature.

It is important to note that mCSM does not deﬁne any explicit penal-
ties, for instance when burying hydrophobic or exposing polar residues.
The pharmacophore vector is used to reﬂect the changes in residue char-
acter and size due to the mutation, and its impact is learned without the
deﬁnition of an explicit threshold. On the other hand, the perception of
residue accessibility or residue depth is implicitly obtained by mCSM
atomic distance patterns.

A detailed description of the evaluation methodology, supervised
learning algorithms used in classiﬁcation and regression tasks as well as
the quality metrics used to evaluate the performance of mCSM are avail-
able as Supplementary Material.

2.2 Data sets

The data sets used in this work can be divided into four groups by pre-
dictive task: prediction of protein stability change on mutation, prediction

of protein—protein and protein—DNA afﬁnity change on mutation. We
also describe in the Supplementary Material a dataset used to assess
the ability of mCSM in predicting disease-related mutations. Table 1
summarizes the conducted experiments, the data sets and validation
procedures used.

2.2.] Protein stability change To assess the applicability of mCSM
signatures in predicting the impact of mutations in protein stability, sev-
eral data sets derived from the ProTherm (Kumar et al., 2006) database
were considered. ProTherm is a collection of experimental thermo-
dynamic parameters for wild-type and mutant proteins, including the
change in Gibbs free energy (AAG). Only single-point mutations were
considered. The data sets were used in comparative experiments with
other methods, in regression and classiﬁcation tasks, which consist of
predicting the numerical value and the direction of change in AAG,
respectively.

$2648: The ﬁrst data set, S2648, was used in comparative regression
tasks where the aim is to predict the change in Gibbs free energy (AAG)
between wild-type and mutant protein. The data set comprises 2648
single-point mutations in 131 different globular proteins. For experiments
with these data, we used 5-fold cross-validation, the same validation
procedure use by the authors of the PoPMuSiC (Dehouck et al., 2009)
algorithm.

$350: The second data set, S350, comprised 350 mutations in 67 dif-
ferent proteins. It is a randomly selected subset of the S2648 data set, also
used in comparative regression experiments. In this case, the remaining
2298 mutations from the S2648 data set were used to train the predictive
model, whereas the S350 data set was used as a test set. This data set is
widely used in the literature to compare the performance of different
methods.

$1925: The data set S1925 was used in both regression and classiﬁca-
tion experiments. It comprises 1925 mutations in 55 proteins, which are
uniformly distributed across the four major SCOP classes (Murzin et al.,
1995). Twenty-fold cross-validation protocol was used, the same protocol
used in by the AUTOMUTE method Masso and Vaisman, 2008).

p53: Finally, as a study case, we assembled a data set of 42 mutations
within the DNA binding domain of the tumour suppressor protein p53,
whose thermodynamic effects have previously been experimentally
characterized (Ang et al., 2006; Bullock et al. 2000; Joerger et al., 2006;
Nikolova et al. 1998, 2000). The full data set description is available as
Supplementary Material.

2.2.2 Protein—protein aﬁnity change The second set of experiments
aims to assess the performance of mCSM signatures in predicting the
impact of mutations on afﬁnity of protein—protein complexes, in both
regression and classiﬁcation tasks (i.e. prediction of the numerical change
or its direction). Afﬁnities of protein—protein complexes were converted
from molar (M) to Kcal/mol using the formulation of the Gibbs free
energy (AG):

AG = RTln(KD)

where R = 8.314JK‘1mol‘1 is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature
(in Kelvin) and KD is the afﬁnity of the protein—protein complex. The
afﬁnity change between wild-type and mutant forms (AAG) is calculated
as follows:

AAG = AGwﬂd — AGmutant

SKEMPI: The data set used is derived from the SKEMPI database
(Moal and Fernandez-Recio, 2012). SKEMPI is a curated database
that compiles changes in thermodynamic and kinetic parameters on mu-
tation for protein—protein complexes for which a structure is available in
the Protein Data Bank. From this database, which includes data for
>3000 mutations, we ﬁlter only single-point mutations with available
experimental afﬁnities for both wild-type and mutant forms. This resulted
in the data set that comprises 2317 mutations in 150 different proteins
with available PDB structures. The SKEMPI data set used is available via
Supplementary Material. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for experi-
ments on this data set.

BeAtMuSiC: The data set comprises 2007 mutations used in a recent
study (Dehouck ct al., 2013). It corresponds to a subset of the SKEMPI
database, comprising mutations in 81 PDB structures. This data set was
used in comparative experiments in 10-fold cross-validation as well as in a
blind test, as described in Section 4 in Supplementary Material.

2.2.3 Protein—nucleic acid aﬂinity change The third set of experi-
ments was designed to demonstrate the capability of mCSM to predict
changes in afﬁnity in protein—DNA complexes, for both regression and
classiﬁcation tasks. For this purpose, we used a data set that was derived
from the ProNIT database (Kumar ct al., 2006). ProNIT comprises ex-
perimentally determined thermodynamic interaction data between pro-
teins and nucleic acids. In this case, we considered the change in Gibbs
free energy (AAG). Only single-point mutations were taken into account.

ProNIT: The data set comprises 511 single mutations in 21 different
proteins for which structures are available, and which were used in a
protein—DNA interaction study that aimed to explore the relationship
between free energy, sequence conservation and structural cooperativity
(Ahmad ct al., 2008). We used 10-fold cross-validation for all experiments
carried out on this data set.

3 RESULTS

To assess the ability of the signatures to encode the impact of
mutations on protein structures, we designed an extensive series
of comparative experiments with other state-of—the-art methods.

Protein Stability Change

 

Protein-Protein Affinity Change

In the ﬁrst set of experiments, we predict the impact of single-
point mutations on protein stability via regression and classiﬁ-
cation tasks. We then assess the adequacy of the signatures in
predicting afﬁnity changes on mutation at protein—protein and
protein—DNA interfaces. We also perform experiments that aim
to predict disease-related mutations. Finally, as a case study, we
apply our methodology to predict stability changes of 42 muta-
tions occurring in the tumour suppressor protein p53.

3.1 Predicting protein stability change on mutation

As summarized in Table 1, three different stability data sets were
used. The left graph of Figure 2 presents the regression results for
the S1925 data set. The mCSM signatures were used to train a
Gaussian process regression model that achieved a correlation of
,0 = 0.824 with a standard error of 0 = 1.026(kcal/m0l). For this
data set, comparing with the AUTOMUTE method (Masso and
Vaisman, 2008), mCSM presented a performance equivalent or
even better for both regression and classiﬁcation tasks as showed
in Supplementary Tables S3 and S7.

When compared with the largest available data set of
mutants, S2648, used by the method PoPMuSiC (Dehouck
et al., 2009), mCSM presented a better performance achieving
a correlation coefﬁcient of ,0 = 0.69 with standard error of
0 = l.06(kcal/m0l), compared with a correlation of ,0 = 0.63
with 0 = 1.15(kcal/m0l) reported by the original authors. Even
after 10% outlier removal, mCSM maintains its efﬁcacy
(,0 = 0.79 with 0 = 0.78(kcal/m0l) for mCSM and
,0 = 0.79; 0 = 0.86(kcal/m0l) for PoPMuSiC).

The data set S350 is a subset of S2648 and was used as test set
for predictive models trained with the remaining 2298 mutations.
Table 2 summarizes the results obtained and shows that mCSM
outperforms other approaches, some by a large margin. Because
some other methods were not able to predict the stability changes
for all 350 mutations, the table also shows the results for the 309
mutations for which all methods were capable of estimating a
AAG value. The performance is also shown when only muta-
tions with AAG >2 kcal/mol are considered. For all cases,
mCSM was the best performing method.

3.2 Predicting afﬁnity change in protein—protein and
protein—DNA complexes on mutation

The central and right graphs of Figure 2 present the regression
results for the SKEMPI protein—protein data set and for the
ProNIT protein—DNA data set. For the SKEMPI data set,
mCSM was able to achieve a correlation of ,0: 0.801 with
0 = 1.251(kcal/m0l), whereas for the ProNIT data set the results
were ,0 = 0.673 with 0 = 1.042(kcal/m0l). In classiﬁcation tasks,
for both data sets the predictive models trained with the mCSM
signatures were able to achieve accuracies of >82% and Area
Under ROC Curves (AUCs) of 0.826 and 0.853, respectively, as
described in Supplementary Table S1.

Supplementary Table S4 shows the mCSM performance in
comparison with the program BeAtMuSiC. mCSM achieves a
correlation of ,0 = 0.58 with 0 = l.55(kcal/m0l), in comparison
with ,0 = 0.40 with 0 = l.80(kcal/m0l) achieved by the
BeAtMuSiC method. mCSM also achieves a correlation of
,0 = 0.56 with 0 = l.38(kcal/m0l) in a blind test as described in
Supplementary Section S4.

We also evaluate our approach by using it to identify disease-
related mutations, comparing it with well-established sequence-
based methods. Supplementary Table S2 summarizes the
obtained results. mCSM achieves a comparable level of accuracy,
whereas presenting much better Matthews Correlation
Coefﬁcient (MCC) and AUC values.

In addition, we performed experiments on low-redundancy
data sets where all mutations in a protein (or position) are
either in the test or training set exclusively, as described in
Supplementary Section S4. As shown in Supplementary Tables
S8 and S9, at the protein level the performance tended to be
slightly inferior. The distribution of mutations per protein in
the data sets is unequal, meaning that information about hun-
dreds of mutations may be available for a single protein, which
may be a signiﬁcant source of bias when deﬁning the folds in
cross-validation.

3.3 Case study: predicting stability changes for
p53 mutants

Cancer is a complex disease that arises from a combination of
genetic and epigenetic changes accumulated over many years.
Although there is large variability in the genes implicated in
tumorigenesis, >50% of human cancers carry loss of function
mutations in the transcription factor p53 (Beroud and Soussi,
2003; Olivier et al. 2002). In response to DNA damage, p53
transactivates a range of genes to induce cell cycle arrest, DNA
repair, senescence and apoptosis, depending on the extent and
types of DNA damage (Sionov et al., 1999; Vousden et al., 2002).
p53 is composed of three main domains: an N—terminal trans-
activation domain (amino acid residues 1415), a DNA binding
domain (residues 102—292) and a C-terminal oligomerization
domain (residues 319—359) (Sionov et al., 1999; Vousden et al.,
2002). Unlike most tumour suppressors that are inactivated by
deletion or truncation mutations, mutations in p53 most often
result in a protein with a single nucleotide substitution. The ma-
jority of these mutations (95%) are located in the DNA binding
domain; they either directly interfere with residues involved in
DNA binding or disrupt the wild-type conformation and stabil-
ity of p53 (Olivier et al., 2002). Both of these classes of mutations
prevent the transcriptional activation of p53 target genes in a
dominant-negative fashion (Vousden et al., 2002).

A new approach in cancer therapy is to ﬁnd drugs that can
rescue the activity of mutant p53. This has primarily focused on
trying to enhance the stability p53, potentially reducing the ef-
fect of destabilizing mutations and restoring wild-type activity.
Several approaches have identiﬁed stabilizing molecules that also
show a stimulatory effect on p53 DNA binding. These have
included antibodies (Hupp et al., 1995), peptides (Selivanova
et al., 1999) and small molecules identiﬁed via structure-guided
design (Boeckler et al., 2008) and screening approaches (Bykov
et al., 2002). The most advanced of these is the small molecule
PRIMA-lMET (APR-246) that has successfully completed
Phase I/II clinical trials, where it was observed that it could
induce p53-dependent biological effects in tumour cells in viva
(Lehmann et al., 2012).

We have used mCSM to predict the effect of mutations on the
stability of p53. We used the published crystal structure of p53
(PDB ID: 2OCJ), and predicted the change in stability of >42
single mutations within the DNA binding domain of p53 whose
thermodynamic effects have previously been experimentally char-
acterized. None of these mutations was present in the training set.
In addition to mCSM, we also used SDM and PoPMuSiC to
predict the stability changes of these mutations. These predictions
were compared directly with the experimentally determined
thermodynamic effects (Supplementary Table S6).

mCSM predicted stability changes correlated strongly with the
experimentally observed thermodynamic effects (,0 = 0.68), as
shown in Supplementary Table S5. In addition, mCSM was a
much better predictor of stability changes in p53 than either
SDM (,0 = 0.29) or PoPMuSiC (,0 = 0.56), consistent with our
larger analysis. In Supplementary Figure S1, we can see that
compared with the experimental observations, mCSM predic-
tions did not have a large variation. Signiﬁcantly, the interquar-
tile range and 95% conﬁdence interval from mCSM predictions
were tighter than either SDM or PoPMuSiC.

mCSM

 

In general there was good agreement between the algorithms
in predicting the direction of change when compared with the
experimental data. One interesting deviation, however, was the
mutation of arginine 282 to tryptophan, clinically a commonly
observed p53 mutation. Arginine 282, shown in Figure 1a and
Supplementary Figure S2, is involved in a network of inter-
actions underpinning the loop-sheet-helix major groove DNA
binding motif. Mutation to tryptophan results in large structural
perturbations, resulting in p53 being largely unfolded, and hence
inactive, under physiological conditions (Bullock et al., 2000).
mCSM was able to predict accurately the effect of this mutation
on the overall stability of p53. Interestingly, both SDM and
PoPMuSiC predicted that the R282W mutation would be stabi-
lizing, with SDM predicting that it would actually be stabilizing
(Supplementary Table S1). In the case of SDM, the version used
in the comparison considers only side chain H-bonds to main
chain residues (Worth et al., 2011), which tend to be less critical;
however in this case the arginine side chain makes three hdydro-
gen bonds to other buried or partially buried side chains. This
highlights the power of mCSM using the local environment to
predict the effects of mutations.

In summary, we have shown that mCSM can predict the
effects of mutations on the stability of p53, and can identify
disease-associated destabilizing mutations. mCSM provides a
reliable way to quickly assess the impact of mutations within
the p53 gene, and hence the likelihood of success of stabilizing
molecules, which is important within a clinical setting.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We present a new approach, mCSM, for studying the impact of
missense mutations in proteins. mCSM, which relies on graph-
based signatures, was successfully applied and evaluated in dif-
ferent predictive tasks and was shown to outperform earlier
methods. We have successfully applied this methodology to pre-
dict stability changes of mutations occurring in p53, demonstrat-
ing the applicability of mCSM in a challenging disease scenario.

The results achieved by mCSM support the idea that the
impact of a mutation can be correlated with the atomic distance
patterns surrounding an amino acid residue. The distant patterns
describe the nature of the environment of the residue in the wild-
type protein. They contrast with amino acid substitution patterns
as used in SDM, which deﬁne the environment as a function of
the residues immediately surrounding the residue. Thus, a solvent
inaccessible residue in SDM will have the same deﬁned environ-
ment whether it is on the core of the protein or close to the
surface. On the other hand, the distance matrix of mCSM will
differ according to the depth of the residue and the curvature of
the protein surface that lies within a large radius, in this work, up
to 10A. This is reminiscent of the focus on ‘depth’ championed
by Chakravarty and Varadarajan (1999). The mCSM distance
matrix will also be sensitive to the nature of the electrostatic
environment, which appears to be less well described in
PoPMuSiC. These advantages are evidenced in the feature selec-
tion analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3), which shows that long-
range distances are the most discriminative attributes of the
signatures, usually polar—polar and hydrophobic—hydrophobic
atom frequencies for distances beyond 6A for the SKEMPI
data set. A latent semantic analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4)

shows that the majority of the variability of the signatures can
be explained with atom frequencies for long-range distances.
In this way, mCSM perceives residue environment density and
depth implicitly, without relying on direct calculations or thresh-
olds. A similar analysis was done for the other data sets
(Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6).

The mCSM approach shows that a good description of the
effect of mutations on the wild-type structure can be achieved
using the pharmacophore count. This contrasts with use of the
immediate environment of the residue to deﬁne a pharmaco-
phore, which is de—emphasized in mCSM. Although in mCSM
the pharmacophore is not described in terms of a deﬁned struc-
ture of the mutant protein, there may still be further gains in the
quality of the prediction if this could be incorporated into
mCSM. A further difference from many previous methods is
the omission of an assessment of the effect of the mutation on
the unfolded state. This is explicitly described in perturbation
methods and in programs like SDM. It appears this is either
less important to the estimation of the change of stability that
arises from the majority of mutations or the unfolded state is
insufﬁciently well described in methods such as SDM.

mCSM does not depend on the observation of mutations that
have occurred in evolution of proteins. These have generally been
selected over long evolutionary times for minor positive or nega-
tive changes on stability that were selectively advantageous to the
organism. Mutations that occur in cancer, such as those in p53
described here, are often deleterious to the function of the pro-
tein and may not be sampled in a statistically signiﬁcant manner
in evolution when information on residue structural environment
is required in the calculation. Therefore, they may not be prop-
erly accounted for in SDM environment-speciﬁc substitution
tables. This is almost certainly the case for the mutation of
arginine 282 to tryptophan in p53, which has signiﬁcant effects
on the stability of the protein. This underlines the importance of
understanding theoretically the effects of various parameters that
inﬂuence stability a major focus of both mCSM and PoPMuSiC.

In future works we intend to apply our methodology for
predicting afﬁnity changes to protein-ligand complexes, to
understand the affects of mutations that occur in drug resistance
in cancer and other diseases. We believe our machine learning
approach is complementary to those based on potential energy
functions like SDM and PoPMuSiC. This way, we intend to
combine them into a hybrid method.

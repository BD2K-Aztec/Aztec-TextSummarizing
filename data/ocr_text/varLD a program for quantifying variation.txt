ABSTRACT

Motivation: Linkage disequilibrium (LD) differences between
populations can potentially result in failure to replicate primary
signals of trait association in independent genome-wide association
studies (GWAS). However, such inter-population LD differences can
be leveraged to narrow the search for common causal variants
responsible for the association signals observed. The ability to
assess and quantify LD variations among populations is thus
expected to contribute to both replication and fine-mapping stages
of GWAS.

1 INTRODUCTION

The aim of genome—wide association studies (GWAS) of common
diseases and complex traits is to ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant
markers, usually single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which
are associated with the phenotype of interest. These SNPs are
seldom the genetic variants responsible for the phenotype, but are
markers in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the underlying causal
variants. Thus, the ﬁndings from GWAS serve as indicators for
genomic regions that are likely to possess the genetic variants
directly responsible for the functional changes and differences in
phenotypic expression.

To reduce statistical noise, it is necessary to validate the initial
ﬁndings in replication studies performed in independent cohorts,
which are often from different populations. Increasingly, meta—
analysis of multiple GWAS studies of the same trait, involving
tens of thousands of individuals are currently being performed
(Easton et al., 2007; Kolz et al., 2009; Levy et al., 2009; Lindgren
et al., 2009). In addition to conﬁrming the initial GWAS ﬁndings,
larger effective sample sizes from these meta—analyses also increase
statistical power for identifying novel associations with smaller
genetic effects. The large number of individuals in these studies
meant it is highly unlikely they will come from the same population
but rather from multiple populations potentially possessing diverse
genetic architectures. The portability of association signals in
these trans—population studies is thus highly dependent on the

similarity of LD patterns between the associated markers and
the underlying causal variants in the different populations. Inter—
population heterogeneity in LD patterns can confound replication,
leading to false negatives in some populations. The ability to
quantify the extent of inter—population LD variation is thus the
ﬁrst step towards understanding whether a failure to reproduce
an association signal in another population may be a result of
differential LD architecture with the causal variant.

The presence of LD among SNP markers has allowed commercial
genotyping platforms with incomplete SNP coverage to successfully
detect genotype—phenotype associations. However, this becomes a
liability in ﬁne—mapping studies that aim to identify the actual causal
variants, since it becomes difﬁcult to distinguish between the causal
variant and the neighbouring markers in high or perfect LD with
the causal variant. Assuming there exists a common causal variant
among different populations, diverse patterns of LD surrounding the
SNPs that emerge from different GWAS studies can be used to reﬁne
the boundaries where the causal variant may be found, narrowing
the search space and reducing the cost of genotyping and sequencing
during ﬁne—mapping studies (Teo et al., 2010).

Here, we introduce a java program (varLD) that quantiﬁes the
extent of LD variation between the two populations. The program
allows genome—wide assessment of LD variation, as well as targeted
analysis of a speciﬁc genomic region. The outcome from these
analyses can be used to identify regions that display evidence of
the inter—population LD variation. As these regions are likely to
possess diverse haplotypic patterns across the populations (Teo et al.,
2009a), association signals emerging from GWAS that fall within
these regions will beneﬁt from leveraging this genomic diversity in
trans—population ﬁne—mapping studies.

2 METHOD AND IMPLEMENTATION

The program adopts the approach described by Teo and colleagues (Teo
er al., 2009a). Brieﬂy, sliding windows of a pre—determined number of SNPs
common in both populations are considered, and the LD between every pair
of SNPs in each window is calculated. The LD here is quantiﬁed by the
signed r2 metric, deﬁned as the r2 metric with the sign of the D/ metric. This
yields a symmetric LD matrix for each population, and the extent of inter—
population LD differences between the SNPs in each window is quantiﬁed
by the varLD score, which sums the absolute differences between the ranked
eigenvalues of the matrices. For genome—wide assessment, each score is
compared against the distribution of the scores calculated from all possible
windows across the genome, and typically scores existing in the extreme
right tail of the distribution are deﬁned as candidate regions displaying
signiﬁcant LD differences. For targeted analysis of a speciﬁc genomic region,

a Monte Carlo (MC) statistical signiﬁcance is calculated by comparing the
score for the region to the scores generated after resampling the appropriate
sample sizes for the two populations from the combined data produced by
merging both populations (Teo et al., 2009a).

The program varLD, accepts tab—delimited genotype input ﬁles of the
following format across the columns: rs—id/snp—id, position, genotype—1,
genotype—2, genotype—3, etc. One ﬁle is expected for each chromosome or a
region, and the SNPs in each ﬁle are assumed to be arranged such that the
positions are in ascending order. Genotypes are coded as numerals 1,2,3,4
with 1 being the homozygote AA, 2 as heterozygote Aa, 3 as homozygote
aa and 4 as missing.

varLD is implemented in Java, and runs on any platforms that supports
V1.5 of the Java runtime environment. It requires the open source libraries
of: (i) Apache Commons CLI library; (ii) Apache Commons Primitives
library; and also (iii) JAMA, a Java Matrix package. Running on a 2.0 GHz
machine with 16 GB of RAM, varLD with default parameters can perform
the LD comparison for about one million SNPs common to two populations
in approximately an hour where we run the analysis for the 22 autosomal
chromosomes sequentially in a single batch run.

The program has the following features implemented: (i) user—speciﬁed
threshold on minor allele frequency for the SNP exclusion; (ii) user—speciﬁed
threshold on extent of missing genotypes for the SNP exclusion; (iii) user—
speciﬁed number of SNPs to consider in each window during genome—wide
assessment; (iv) allows the use of the same input ﬁle for genome—wide
assessment and for assessment in a targeted genomic region, where the latter
allows the user to specify the start and end position to consider; (v) generates
a MC P—value in the targeted genomic region assessment, allowing the user
to specify the number of iterations to perform.

3 EXAMPLE APPLICATION

Warfarin is a widely prescribed anticoagulant drug to reduce blood
clotting in order to protect patients from stroke, thrombosis and
heart attack. However, the dose requirement and drug response have
been shown to vary signiﬁcantly between patients from different
population groups (Lee et al., 2006; Rieder et al., 2005). For
example, Asian Indians have been observed to display warfarin
resistance, thus requiring a higher dose as compared to Chinese
and Malays (Lee et al., 2006). A genetic association has been
observed for this inter—population variation in warfarin activity, with
the identiﬁcation of population—speciﬁc haplotypes in the VKORCl
gene that correlate with differences in warfarin dosage and response
(Lee et al., 2006; Rieder et al., 2005; Schwarz et al., 2008). Thus,
VKORCl provide a convenient example to illustrate the use of
varLD, since a priori we expect the LD patterns in this gene
region to differ between these populations. The program varLD
was used to calculate and compare the LD differences around the
VKORCl gene between populations in the International Hapmap
Project (International HapMap Consortium, 2007) and the Singapore
Genome Variation Project (Teo et al., 2009b). Figure 1 shows
the normalized scores from the genome—wide assessment of LD
variation in numerous pairs of populations from these two projects,

indicating strong evidence of inter—population LD variations in and
around the VKORCl gene. Similarly, in a targeted comparison
within the VKORCl gene with 10000 MC iterations, most of the
population pairs indicate moderate to strong evidence (MC P < 0.01)
of LD variations, except that between Hapmap CEU and SGVP INS
(MC P = 0.5044).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identifying functional relation of copy number variation
regions (CNVRs) and gene is an essential process in understanding
the impact of genotypic variations on phenotype. There have been
many related works, but only a few attempts were made to normal
populations.

Results: To analyze the functions of genome-wide CNVRs, we
applied a novel correlation measure called Correlation based
on Sample Set (CSS) to paired Whole Genome TilePath array
and messenger RNA (mRNA) microarray data from 210 HapMap
individuals with normal phenotypes and calculated the confident
CNVR—gene relationships. Two CNVR nodes form an edge if they
regulate a common set of genes, allowing the construction of a global
CNVR network. We performed functional enrichment on the common
genes that were trans-regulated from CNVRs clustered together in
our CNVR network. As a result, we observed that most of CNVR
clusters in our CNVR network were reported to be involved in some
biological processes or cellular functions, while most CNVR clusters
from randomly constructed CNVR networks showed no evidence
of functional enrichment. Those results imply that CSS is capable
of finding related CNVR—gene pairs and CNVR networks that have
functional significance.

1 INTRODUCTION

Copy number variation (CNV) is one type of human genomic
structural variation and is recognized as a major source of human
genetic variability, occupying a larger proportion of the genome
than single nucleotide polymorphisms (Levy et al., 2007). Specially,
there have been several studies to ﬁnd the impact of CNV on gene
expression phenotypes. Much of the variation in messenger RNA
(mRNA) transcript levels may be compensated for by regulatory
networks, but understanding how genetic variants affect gene
expression has provided an essential framework and model for

elucidating the causes of various types of phenotypic variation
including diseases.

Research investigations on the impact of CNV on phenotypes are
generally association studies using various types of gene expression
and genotyped data from speciﬁc disease samples versus samples
with normal phenotypes. Berger et al. (2006) proposed an approach
to detect variation patterns by integrating gene expression and copy
number data from breast cancer samples. Perry et al. (2007) found
that copy number of CNVR that harbors salivary amylase gene
(AMYl) is correlated positively with salivary amylase protein level.
Lee et al. (2008) found CNV—gene relationships through analysis on
CNV and a set of genes which have similar patterns in breast cancer
samples. Menezes et al. (2009) analyzed the role of CNV in the
development of breast cancer in conjunction with genes in the whole
genomic area. Junnila et al. (2010) proﬁled gastric cancer cell lines
and found that 256 differentially expressed genes are located in the
recurrent region of gains and losses. These results imply that those
genes are important gastric cancer genes. Generally, these studies
focus on the abnormal copy number variation regions (CNVRs) in
speciﬁc disease samples. Also, many of these focus on CNVs that
harbor genes (Berger et al., 2006; Junnila et al., 2010). The global
impact of DNA copy numbers on the transcriptome has not been
studied, especially for people with normal phenotypes (Henrichsen
et al., 2009).

A representative investigation of the impact of CNVs on the
phenotypes of normal people in terms of gene expression was made
by Stranger et al. (2007a), who inferred relationships between DNA
copy numbers and gene expression levels of normal phenotyped 210
HapMap samples, using a linear regression model. However, they
focused on the genes that lie in or close to CNVRs (distance to a
CNVR < 2 Mbp). Considering that there are many more CNVRs
that do not harbor genes, Stranger et al. (2007a) detected only a
small portion of the relationships between genotype and phenotype.

Recent work by Klijn et al. (2010) aimed to identify
the collaborating CNVs that are responsible for hematopoietic
tumorigenesis. They ﬁrst found gains and losses that are commonly
detected in the majority of hematopoietic tumor samples. Then,
they constructed gain or loss networks by functional analysis of the
genes that were harbored in gain or loss pairs. CNVRs in the central
part of the gain or loss networks harbored the well—studied cancer—
related genes. Like Stranger et al. (2007a) and many other studies,
they also focused on CNVRs that harbor genes or gene regulatory
regions. However, it is notable that they observed several CNVRs
that contributed to the same phenotypic traits by using the concept
of a CNVR network.

When a CNVR regulates a gene that is on the CNVR itself or
that is located near it, we call this type of CNVR—gene regulation
cis—regulation. In contrast, when a regulated gene location is
independent of the CNVR’s location, this type of CNVR—gene
regulation is called trans—regulation. In research elucidating the
impact of CNVR on gene expression phenotypes, restricting CNVR—
gene relationships into cis—regulations is problematic because there
are many CNVRs that have neither genes nor known regulation
regions. When these CNVRs are strongly suspected to have some
functional role, trans—regulation as well as cis—regulation between
CNVRs and genes should be investigated.

A na'1've approach to detecting both cis— and trans—regulations
is to measure the correlation between the estimated copy number
values of a CNVR and the expression values of a gene using
Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (PCC) or its variants. However, just
measuring correlation might lead to many potentially false positives,
because this approach has two problems. First, both Whole Genome
TilePath (WGTP) array and gene expression data are very noisy.
Second, regulation between a CNV and a gene may be observed only
under speciﬁc conditions or in samples in which some molecular
functions or biological processes are taking place. To reduce the
false rates of detection of cis— and trans—regulation, we developed
a novel correlation measure named CSS, which effectively relieves
the noise of WGTP and gene expression data by applying k—means
clustering and also addresses the second problem by using a set of
conditions which have similar intensities or expression patterns. In
brief, CSS makes use of two vectors: one from the copy numbers
of the CNVR A and the other from the expression values of gene
B. CSS uses one additional vector from gene C that is connected to
gene B through protein—protein interaction (PPI). The rationale of
exploiting PPI is that two interacting proteins have a high possibility
of being involved in the same biological function in the PPI network.
If the expression values of genes that are densely connected to the
inspected gene are also correlated to the copy number values of
CNVR, the relationship between the inspected gene and a CNVR is
more convincing.

Using the WGTP array data and paired mRNA expression data
proﬁled from 210 HapMap samples from individuals with normal
phenotypes (Altshuler et al., 2005), we applied CSS to identify
signiﬁcant CNVR—gene relationships. Rather than considering a
single CNVR and a single gene, we considered the possibility that
many CNVRs are affecting a set of genes that are involved in the
same functions. We found that several CNVRs were related to the
common set of genes. Using this common gene information, we
constructed the functional CNVR network. Our CNVR network
is not cancer speciﬁc, as in Klijn et al. (2010) rather, it contains
information about more fundamental biological processes and
cellular functions that take place in people with normal phenotypes.

To validate our CNVR network, we performed functional
enrichment on the common genes that were cis— and trans—regulated
with CNVRs clustered together in the network. As a result, we
conﬁrmed that most CNVR clusters were reported to be involved
in some biological processes or cellular functions in the Gene
Ontology (GO) database. In contrast, the functional enrichment tests
of most CNVR clusters from the network that were constructed using
PCC, as well as those from three types of randomly constructed
CNVR networks, failed. These results imply that CSS is capable of
ﬁnding related CNVR—gene pairs, and that our CNVR network has
functional signiﬁcance.

2 METHODS

To construct a genome—wide functional CNVR network, we ﬁrst ﬁnd
correlated CNVR and gene pairs from preprocessed WGTP array and
mRNA microarray data. Two CNVR nodes that are correlated to a
common set of genes comprise an edge of the CNVR network.

2.1 Data description

We downloaded WGTP array data from Redon et al. (2006). Data
are represented by log2 ratio values from comparative genomic
hybridization of all 210 unrelated HapMap individuals (Altshuler
et al., 2005) from four populations (60 Utah residents with ancestry
from northern and western Europe; 45 Han Chinese from Beijing; 45
Japanese from Tokyo and 60 Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria) against
a common reference individual, NA10851, on an array comprising
26 574 large insert clones. For analysis, we used 867 CNVRs that
were identiﬁed by Redon et al. (2006); for each CNVR, we averaged
the log2 ratio values of probes that lie in this CNVR. CNVRs from
sex chromosomes were excluded because of their imbalance in males
and females.

Transcript levels had been determined in previous studies
(Stranger et al., 2007a, b) using Illumina’s commercial whole
genome expression array. Data were interrogated in cell lines from
the same set of 210 HapMap individuals. Of the 47 294 transcripts
that were interrogated, we used 19 664 transcripts that can be
mapped to human gene symbol space. The gene expression data
can be downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus with the
submission number series GSE6536.

We also downloaded 194 988 human PPIs from the I2D database
on October 2010, which includes known, experimental and predicted
PPIs for humans, as well as those of ﬁve other organisms. The
proteins in these PPIs were mapped into gene symbols using
UniPROT. After removing duplicated PPIs and PPIs that contain
proteins that are not mapped to a gene symbol, we obtained
108 544 PPIs.

2.2 Finding correlated CNVR—gene pairs

Each individual of the 210 HapMap samples has both WGTP
intensities for all probes and gene expression values in log2 ratio,
which means that each CNVR and each gene has a vector with 210
values.

To deal with the noise of the WGTP and gene expression data, we
preprocess the data using k—means clustering algorithm with k=3.
First, we average the log2 ratio values of probes that are covered
by each CNVR detected by Redon et al. (2006) for each individual.
We deﬁne clj as the average copy number value of the ith CNVR of
the jth individual. Likewise, gij is deﬁned as the expression value
of the ith gene of the jth individual. Vector cj and gj are deﬁned as
the cljs and gljs of all CNVRs and all genes, respectively. Applying
k—means to each cj and gj, the high values are marked with 1, low
values are marked with —1 and intermediate values are marked with
0. Examples of ﬂagging datasets are illustrated in Figure 1a.

Given CNVR 6, gene g and genes {ngi} that are connected to
g through PPIs (Fig. 1c), PSl, NSl, PS2 and NS2 are deﬁned as
follows:

PSl = {samples that are marked with 1 or —1 in both c and g}.

NSl = {samples that are marked with 1 in c and —1 in g or
that are marked with —1 in c and 1 in g}.

Fig. 1. Calculating the correlation between CNVR c and gene g. (a) Each table represents vectors of one individual. (b) The table represents the three vectors
for a speciﬁc CNVR and genes. (c) Gene g is connected to ngl, ng2 and ng3 through PPIs. (d) angSS values of all possible CNVR—gene associations form

a normal distribution. The signiﬁcant angSS threshold is 16.11

PS2 = {samples that are marked with 1 or —1 in both c and
7181'}-

NS2 = {samples that are marked with 1 in c and —1 in mg,
or that are marked with —1 in c and 1 in ngl- }.

And PP, PN, NP and NN are deﬁned as follows:
PP = n(PSl (1 PS2).
PN = n(PSl ﬂ NS2).
NP =n(NSl (1 PS2).
NN =n(NSl ﬂ NS2).

PP means the number of samples that show positive correlation on c
and g, and also positive correlation on c and g. Likewise, PN stands
for the number of samples that show positive correlation on c and g
but negative correlation on c and ngi. Example for calculating PS 1,
N81, PS2, NS2, PP, PN, NP and NN is shown in Figure 1b. PP,
PN, NP and NN do not behave in a similar fashion. In some CNV—
gene links, PP can be a major measure for calculating angSS, and
in other links, PN can be major. However, all these measures are
equally meaningful, and it is not proper to give weight to some
measures. The angSS between c and g is deﬁned by the following
formula:

max PP,PN,NP,NN
CSS (C, 8” "g0: 
angSS (c,g)=average (CSS (6, g, ngi)).

Example for calculating CSS and angSS is illustrated in Figure 1c.

The CSS value increases as the number of individuals with similar
expression patterns in both a CNVR and a gene increases. Therefore,
CSS can be used in situations where regulation between a CNVR
and a gene may be observed under speciﬁc conditions. Moreover,
CSS increases the conﬁdence of correlation by considering the set of
genes in the second level that are directly interacted with the speciﬁc
gene, g, by PPI.

As shown in Figure 1d, the frequencies of the angSS values of all
possible CNVR—gene associations form a normal distribution (tested
with Shapiro—Wilk test (Shapiro and Wilk, 1965), P—value > 0.05)
with a mean of 9.59 and standard deviation of 3.36. A CNVR—gene
association is signiﬁcant if its angSS is greater than the signiﬁcant
angSS threshold of 16.11, which is the value for the upper 5% of
angSSs.

2.3 Construction of CNVR networks

Two CNVRs that share a similar set of genes can be said to be
functionally related. The degree of functional relationship should be
proportional to the weight of an edge of the CNVR network. Given
two CNVRs cl and 62, the weight of edge (cl, 62) is calculated
using the following formula:

2 harmonic mean (A, B) X M

g,- E intersections

weight (61,62): _
|unions|

where A = angSS (cl, g,), B = angSS (62, g,) and intersections
indicate genes that are commonly related to both CNVRs and unions
indicate genes that are related to more than one CNVR. We use
harmonic mean instead of arithmetic mean because genes that are
strongly related to only one CNVR are not good for intersections.

3 RESULTS

3.1 CNVR networks with different scales

CNVR networks were constructed using 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and
20% of edges (CNVR pairs) after the edges, we sorted in descending
order according to weight. As previously mentioned in Section 2.3,
we calculated the weights between all CNVR pairs to construct the
complete graph. However, although we calculated the weights for
all CNVR pairs, the edges having high weights are more important
than the others and we focused only on selected edges. Of 867
CNVRs identiﬁed by Redon et al. (2006), the number of CNVRs
that are matched to the raw WGTP array is 833. Among 833 CNVRs,
some CNVRs did not have any genes satisfying angSS threshold
(see Section 2). Thus, we reduced the selection to 767 CNVRs.
Details of each network are presented in Table 1. ‘Average degree,
in Table 1 was computed using 833 CNVRs. ‘Average degree’ in
Table 1 was calculated using only CNVRs that are connected with
each other. The number of clusters means the number of identiﬁed

communities in the network for each scale. The number of enriched
clusters indicates the number of the clusters that are successfully
enriched using GO database. The number of non—connected nodes
indicates the number of CNVRs that have no connection with other
CNVRs. The number of enriched non—connected nodes denotes the
number of those CNVRs that are successfully enriched using GO
database.

Unlike in a PPI network or genetic interaction (GI) network (Lin
et al., 2010), many CNVRs are unconnected. This implies that
many CNVRs may function alone, unlike proteins or genes. The
average degree and distribution of degree of CNVR networks when
considering all CNVRs were similar to those in PPI or GI networks
(Gursoy et al., 2008; Kar et al., 2009.

However, when unconnected CNVRs were excluded, the average
degree was far greater than that of a PPI or GI network. The fact
that CNVRs with more than one connection form very densely
connected CNVR networks can be also observed in Figure 2, which
was visualized using Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003).

In addition, we performed an experiment with more recent set of
CNVRs from Conrad et al. (2010). We constructed CNVR networks
with our method using 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2% of highly weighted
edges. And then we clustered the nodes and performed functional
analysis for the networks in the same way we had performed.
The result of the functional enrichment is in Table Sl in the
Supplementary Material. We could not ﬁnd clusters from 5, 10 and
20% scaled network because the clustering algorithm we used failed
to ﬁnd clusters from those large—sized networks within the practical
time. We can conﬁrm that all CNVR networks were successfully
enriched, which shows our method performs well for other CNVR
data.

3.2 Functional analysis of CNVR network

For a more detailed analysis of the CNVR networks, we clustered
the CNVR nodes using the network clustering algorithm (Ahn
et al., 2010), which hierarchically detects the clusters in the network
while allowing overlapping nodes (CNVRs) between them. When
the weight scale of the network was 220, the number of clusters
decreased. The suspected reason is that false—positive CNVR—CNVR
edges make the whole CNVR network too dense.

Each CNVR cluster has common associated genes. For each
CNVR cluster, genes that were associated with more than (n/2)
CNVRs in the cluster of n CNVRs were extracted. We enriched
these gene sets with the GO database using the FuncAssociate
(Berriz et al., 2003). The FuncAssociate is a web—based tool
that reports all GO terms that are enriched with statistical
signiﬁcance (05200005) for a given gene set. If no GO term
is reported, the gene set is said to fail to be enriched or
validated. We conﬁrmed that the gene sets from all scales were
successfully enriched with more than one GO term, indicating
that the CNVRs in each CNVR cluster cooperate with each other
in some biological processes or cellular functions. One of the
example CNVR clusters from the CNVR network of Figure 2
is composed of 13 CNVRs, chr14_669, chr11_565, chr19_808,
chr7_396, chr17_749, chr3_195, chr6_376, chr20_822, chr4_217,
chr5_282, chr10_524, chr18_775 and chr4_250. These have 1228
common associated genes. Table 2 shows the GO enrichment
results of those 1228 genes. We can infer that these CNVRs
seem to be involved in protein complex formation processes,
which contribute to intracellular transport. We provide the list of
CNVRs and CNVR pairs, the list of CNVR clusters for each
scale and the list of the associated genes for each CNVR, at
http://embio.yonsei.ac.kr/~Ahn/cnv_net.php.

Although detecting the collaboration of CNVRs is one purpose
of constructing a CNVR network, its other purpose is the ﬁlteration

of false—positive gene—CNVR associations through common gene
extraction during the network construction. In other words, genes
that are associated by only one CNVR are less convincing than
genes that are associated by two or more CNVRs, and these singly
associated genes are eliminated.

3.3 Comparison between CNVR networks based on
angSS and those based on PCC

To validate that our association measure, CSS, was superior in
identifying the correlations between CNVR and gene expression,
we constructed a CNVR network using PCC (PCC network) and
compared the functional enrichment of that and our CNVR network.
This was the core process to calculate the association between the
CNVRs and genes because we constructed the CNVR network
based on the correlations for each CNVR—gene pair. All other
experimental conditions were the same as in the previous situations.
We applied the same signiﬁcance level, upper 0.5%, for the threshold
of PCC and calculated weights between all pairs of CNVRs. We
also constructed eight networks with the same range of scales that
we applied to our CNVR network. Unlike our CNVR network in
Table 1, the numbers of clusters in the PCC network were larger and
the densities of networks with connected nodes were two or four
times lower. Also, most of the clusters of the PCC network were
not functionally enriched. Table 3 shows the summary and results
of functional analysis of PCC network. Unconnected CNVRs were
also not functionally enriched. This implies that a PCC network may
not include the biological meaning, in contrast to the results of our
CNVR network.

3.4 Validation of CSS by random tests

Previously, we successfully validated our CNVR network through
a functional enrichment test. If a randomly constructed CNVR
network failed to be validated, we claim that our methods produce
a CNVR network that has signiﬁcant biological meaning.

Second, we generated 833 false CNVRs by simulating the
distribution of hybridization intensities, N (2.72256E—14, 12) and
calculated CNVR—gene associations for all possible pairs of false
CNVR. As the log2 ratio of false CNVRs followed the distribution
of real data, most of them were neutral. The remaining steps were the
same as those of our method. Table 5 shows the results of functional
analysis. The numbers of connected nodes and edges were very
similar to those in our CNVR network for each scale because we used
the same measure, CSS, to identify associations and the remaining
steps were the same. However, the number of clusters and the ratio
of enriched clusters deﬁnitely differed on all scales from those of
our network. This experimental result indicated that the network
constructed using neutral regions instead of copy numbered areas
did not reﬂect biological function.

From Tables 4 and 5, we can say that CNVR networks constructed
using random CNVR—gene selection or false CNVRs failed to be
validated while CNVR networks constructed by our approach were
validated. This implies that CSS is able to detect signiﬁcant CNVR—
gene associations, and our weight scheme is capable of constructing
the correct CNVR network.

To further show the signiﬁcance of CSS, we performed the
permutation test. First, we divided CNVR—gene pairs into two
groups, A and B, based on angSS threshold. Pairs above threshold
are labeled as group A and pairs below threshold are labeled as

group B. Second, we reconstructed groups A’ and B’ using randomly
chosen pairs from A and B, and calculate a difference between the
mean of angSS values in A’ and one in B’. The second procedure
was iterated 999 999 times, and we display the distribution of the
statistics in Supplementary Figure Sl. H0 is that our CNVR—gene
pairs are not signiﬁcant. P—value for difference between means of
A and B (statics for observed data) is 100E—06. Therefore, Hg was
rejected.

We also tested the robustness of our method by comparing number
of enriched clusters and enriched non—connected nodes generated
with half of the transcript data, and less. Supplementary Figure S2
shows the proportions of enriched non—connected nodes with same
scales. Approximately 64.18% of the enriched clusters were detected
even when only 10% of the samples were used with scale of 0.1%.
It performed comparably well with 25% of samples. Supplementary

Identification of functional CNV region networks

 

with same scales. Fifty percent of samples approximately give
comparable success ratio to whole samples in ﬁnding functionally
enriched clusters and nodes. These two tests indicate that our method
is robust to the number of samples used.

4 DISCUSSIONS

We showed that the ratio of functionally enriched CNVR clusters of
the CNVR network constructed using CSS was far greater than that
of PCC, in Section 3. Two major different characteristics of CSS and
PCC appear to make the difference of performance. First, correlation
is calculated using some group of samples that have similar patterns
in CSS, while PCC is calculated using all the samples of the dataset.
As there is no guarantee that functional relationship is active in
all conditions or samples, our approach seems to have deﬁnite
strength.

Second, CSS measures the correlation between a CNVR and a
gene by integrating the PPIs, while PCC needs no PPI. Given CNVR
c and gene g, correlation between c and g is not reliable because both
arrayCGH log ratio values and gene expression values are noisy,
and not all samples show the signiﬁcant correlation between c and
g, as we have explained above. To correct the correlation value, we
introduce other genes that are believed to be functionally linked,
in other words, linked through PPI to g. Correlations between c
and each of other genes can correct the signiﬁcance level of the
correlation between c and g.

Of course, integrating the PPIs has obvious weakness. If the
PPIs that are relevant to some biological functions in the protein
network are sparse, CNVR—gene relations that are related to those
functions would be incorrect. Moreover, PPI datasets have been
known to suffer from many false positives. However, PPIs datasets
are becoming more complete and accurate, and we can expect that
the weakness of CSS can be overcome to some degree.

In addition, we analyzed more detailed functionality of some
CNVR clusters we found, referring to the literature. The analysis
can be found in Supplementary File.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The main contribution of our study is that we constructed functional
CNVR networks for people with normal phenotypes using a novel
correlation measure called CSS and the weighting scheme. Notably,
our CNVR networks also contain CNVRs that are close to or that
harbor some genes. The trans—regulations between those CNVRs
and the genes allow our CNVR network to function on a genome—
wide basis. We showed that our CNVR networks have biological
meaning, which means that we were able to identify several CNVRs
that commonly contribute to some biological functions that are
not dependent on speciﬁc conditions or diseases. We expect our
methods can also be successfully applied to the construction of

the disease—speciﬁc CNVR networks and that our methods will
contribute to various studies regarding trans—regulation.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput cell-based phenotypic screening has
become an increasingly important technology for discovering new
drug targets and assigning gene functions. Such experiments use
hundreds of 96-well or 384-well plates, to cover whole-genome
RNAi collections and/or chemical compound files, and often collect
measurements that are sensitive to spatial background noise whose
patterns can vary across individual plates. Correcting these position
effects can substantially improve measurement accuracy and screen-
ing success.

Result: We developed SbacHTS (Spatial background noise correction
for High-Throughput RNAi Screening) software for visualization, esti-
mation and correction of spatial background noise in high-throughput
RNAi screens. SbacHTS is supported on the Galaxy open-source
framework with a user-friendly open access web interface. We find
that SbacHTS software can effectively detect and correct spatial
background noise, increase signal to noise ratio and enhance statis-
tical detection power in high-throughput RNAi screening experiments.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNAi is a process in which gene expression is inhibited by small
RNA molecules such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and
short hairpin RNAs. High-throughput RNAi screening is a
breakthrough technology for functional genomics and for drug
target discovery (Orvedahl et al., 2011; Whitehurst et al., 2007).
A frequently used screening platform uses 96-well or 384-we11
microtiter plates, on which each well contains siRNA oligos de-
signed to target a speciﬁc gene. A number of methods and tools
are available for data normalization (Dragiev et al., 2012), visu-
alization (Zhang and Zhang, 2013) and analysis of such experi-
ments (Ogier and Dorval, 2012).

A challenge confronting the collection of precision measure-
ments during High-Throughput Screening (HTS) is that the
required experimental steps, such as procedures including cell cul-
ture, transfection, reagent delivery, incubation and HTS-plate
scanning, may introduce spatially correlated background noise

varying across experiments, batches and plates (Birmingham
et al., 2009; Carralot et al., 2011; Malo et al., 2006). Ignoring
position effects results in low signal to noise ratios and reduces
sensitivity. Recently, edge effects have been considered in normal-
ization of high-throughput RNAi screening data (Carralot et al.,
2011); however, the only existing approach to address the global
spatial background noise across a plate is to use B—score statistics
(Malo et al., 2006) to adjust row and column effects using analysis
of variance. This method can be an effective approach for simple
row and column effects. In our exploratory analysis of the high-
throughput RNAi screening data, complex spatial patterns have
been observed for most of the plates. Thus, simpliﬁed background
correction approaches may often lead to overcorrection for some
well plates and undercorrection for others. To help address this
limitation, we sought advanced statistical models to enhance ac-
curacy of quantiﬁcation and correction of complex spatial back-
ground noise in high-throughput RNAi screening experiments.

Kriging interpolation (Banerjee et al., 2003) is a well-estab-
lished and widely used statistical model to ﬁt spatial patterns in
the observed data. In this study, we adapted a Kriging model to
quantify and correct spatially correlated background noise in
high-throughput RNAi screening data and developed a user-
friendly software package, SbacHTS (Spatial background noise
correction for High-Throughput RNAi Screening), together with
intuitive data visualization and quality assessment tools, for open-
source implementation of the Kriging correction. We ﬁnd that
SbacHTS software can effectively detect and correct spatial back-
ground noise, increase signal to noise ratio and enhance statistical
detection power for RNAi screening experiments.

2 METHODS

SbacHTS software uses Kriging interpolation to ﬁt spatial noise patterns
and correct noise in high-throughput screening data. For each individual
plate, at well 5, let Y, = X, + 85 be the observed intensity (e.g. cell via-
bility readout from the well), which includes both signal (XS) and spatially
correlated background noise (as). We assume XS is from a normal distri-
bution XS~N(;1.S, 052), where its is the mean effect of siRNA in well 5, and

as is from a multivariate Gaussian distribution 85~ N(0, 2), where
2 = 02p(¢,d,-,j) + $21. Here, p(¢,d,,j) is a function of the distance be-
tween well plates i and j, dw- 2 Is,- —Sj|, with parameters ()3, and r2]
models the independent white Gaussian noise. Using this model, we
can estimate the spatial background noisesS and the signal XS at each
location 5 from the observed value Ys. The software exports the estimated
signals as a data matrix. For details about statistical inference and par-
ameters estimation, reader can refer to Banerjee et a]. (2003).

3 RESULTS

The SbacHTS software (Fig. 1a) is developed with an intuitive
web interface to facilitate broad implementation in the screening
community. We used a real screening dataset (W hitehurst et al.,
2007) to evaluate the performance of SbacHTS software
(Fig. lb—e). This experiment used a commercial whole-genome
arrayed siRNA library with 267 96-well plates to compare
siRNA effects between paclitaxel—treated (experimental group)
lung cancer cells and vehicle-treated (control group) lung
cancer cells in triplicate.

3.1 Spatial noise pattern visualization

SbacHTS displays the spatial background noise pattern across
each plate (Fig. 1b) and the corresponding ﬁtted spatial back-
ground noise (Fig. lc). This allows for fast and intuitive user
appreciation of the position effects and spatial distribution of
the calculated background noise across each plate for each
screen. In addition, SbacHTS software exports observed inten-
sity display too.

3.2 Improvement of coefﬁcients of variation and
statistical detection power

In the example dataset, the genome-wide siRNA screening ex-
periments were carried out in triplicate. The coefﬁcients of
variation can, therefore, be calculated for each siRNA pool.
Importantly, Figure 1d demonstrates that spatial background
correction decreases the coefﬁcients of variation, indicating im-
provement of the signal to noise ratio in the experiments. For
example, the 90th percentile of coefﬁcients of variation decreases
from 0.044 in the original data to 0.039 after spatial correction.
As a result, for 90% of genes, the statistical power to detect 10%
changes increases from 0.88 to 0.94 when the Type I error rate is
5%. The goal of this screening experiment was to identify
siRNAs, which signiﬁcantly decrease cell viability in the experi-
mental group compared with the control group (referred as hits).

For each well, the cell viabilities were compared between the
experimental group and the control group, using Student’s t-
test, and a P—value was calculated. A Beta Uniform model
(Pounds and Morris, 2003) was used to determine the false dis-
covery rate (FDR). After applying spatial background correc-
tion, we identiﬁed 867 hits with an FDR of <0.05, whereas we
only identiﬁed 101 hits from the original data (Supplementary
Figure S1) using the same criterion. Therefore, we successfully
reduced the false-negative rate when controlling the same FDR
(Supplementary Figure S2).

3.3 Visualization of batch effects

SbacHTS software provides a function to summarize the meas-
urements (such as observed readouts or z scores) of each plate
using a box-plot, grouping the box-plots by relevant variables
(e.g. processing dates or batches). This function allows users to
detect systematic bias or batch effects caused by uncontrolled
experimental factors (Figure 1e).

4 IMPLEMENTATION

SbacHTS software is implemented in R and available as a
Galaxy (Giardine et al., 2010) tool with a user-friendly web inter-
face. A detailed user manual and demonstration data are avail-
able at http: //www.ga1axy.qbrc.org/.

Although a genome-wide siRNA screen was used to demon-
strate SbacHTS, the software is also applicable to other high-
throughput screening experiments with similar workﬁow, such as
chemical compound screening. Our results show that SbacHTS
can correct spatial background noise, increase signal to noise
ratio and improve hit identiﬁcation from high-throughput
screening experiments. In addition, SbacHTS is computationally
efﬁcient, requiring <5 minutes to process the 267-plate genome-
wide data.

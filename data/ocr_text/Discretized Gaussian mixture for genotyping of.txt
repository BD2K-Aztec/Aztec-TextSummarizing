ABSTRACT

Motivation: Inferring lengths of inherited microsatellite alleles with
single base pair resolution from short sequence reads is challenging
due to several sources of noise caused by the repetitive nature of
microsatellites and the technologies used to generate raw sequence
data.

Results: We have developed a program, GenoTan, using a discretized
Gaussian mixture model combined with a rules-based approach to
identify inherited variation of microsatellite loci from short sequence
reads without paired-end information. It effectively distinguishes
length variants from noise including insertion/deletion errors in homo-
polymer runs by addressing the bidirectional aspect of insertion and
deletion errors in sequence reads. Here we first introduce a homopo-
lymer decomposition method which estimates error bias toward inser-
tion or deletion in homopolymer sequence runs. Combining these
approaches, GenoTan was able to genotype 94.9% of microsatellite
loci accurately from simulated data with 40x sequence coverage
quickly while the other programs showed <90% correct calls for the
same data and required 5~30>< more computational time than
GenoTan. It also showed the highest true-positive rate for real data
using mixed sequence data of two Drosophila inbred lines, which was
a novel validation approach for genotyping.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since many inherited variants of microsatellite loci are known to
be associated with several human diseases such as colorectal can-
cers and various neurological disorders (Sutherland and Richards,
1995), the variants can act as important biomarkers to identify
risk of disease development. The advent of next generation
sequencing (NGS) technologies allows for a robust comparison
of large numbers of microsatellite loci from several individuals in a
quick and cost-effective way (McIver et al., 2011) which then
allows the discovery and use of microsatellites as biomarkers or

causative agents of disease. Unfortunately, inferring precise
lengths of inherited microsatellite alleles with single base-pair reso-
lution from short sequence reads remains a challenge due to the
repetitive nature of microsatellites and the technologies used to
generate raw sequence data. Homopolymer sequences, which are
the most dominant class in the microsatellite family, are especially
difﬁcult to analyze. In this article, we discovered that >60% of
microsatellite loci showing variants in a human genome contain
homopolymer sequences (>6 bases), which underscores the im-
portance of properly calling the genotype for this class of poly-
morphism. Repetitive sequences often result in insertion/deletion
(INDEL) sequencing errors at homopolymers and incorrect map-
ping of sequence reads (Minoche et al., 2011). Compounding the
issue, biological or technological mutants at microsatellite loci due
to individual cell mutation or PCR ampliﬁcation artifacts are also
frequently observed. Substitution errors (sequencing or biologic-
ally derived) in the repeat sequences themselves also greatly affect
the quality of alignment. A few methods such as SAMtools (Li
et al., 2009), GATK (McKenna et al., 2010) and Dindel (Albers
et al., 2011) can be used to genotype microsatellite loci with single
base-pair resolution without paired-end information, but they
have been principally designed to identify short INDELs in
non-repeat sequences. Although lobSTR (Gymrek et al., 2012)
has been developed to proﬁle short tandem repeat loci, it is limited
to only analyzing 2~6-mer motif repeat loci. Recently, RepeatSeq
(Highnam et al., 2012) has been developed to genotype microsat-
ellite loci, but it does not provide a training module to adjust
parameters to different sequence data conditions. The genotyping
programs, including Dindel, employ local alignment-based meth-
ods and assume mainly sequencing errors cause the INDEL errors
if the mapping quality is high. However distant variants at micro-
satellite loci often fool mapping programs into assigning high
quality scores to incorrectly mapped reads when the sequence
reads from the repeat loci are very different from the reference
sequence, which results in incorrect genotyping. Especially,
accuracies of genotyping programs using a Bayesian approach
are signiﬁcantly affected by a few incorrectly mapped reads
(Supplementary Material). Individual cell mutations and polymer-
ase chain reaction (PCR) ampliﬁcation errors also frequently alter
lengths of reported microsatellites resulting in falsely calling geno-
types different from the inherited alleles. In addition, as homopo-
lymer sequences induce not only INDEL errors, but also
substitution errors during sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S1)
and INDEL errors in reads containing homopolymers are

frequently recurrent in other reads mapped to the same locus
(Supplementary Fig. S2), local alignment-based approaches
often fail to correctly identify inherited alleles. Further, the pro-
grams weight the ﬁnal call towards the reference sequence, which
may result in an artiﬁcial selection against novel (non-reference)
allele calls since mapping or alignment algorithms are mostly
biased to the reference sequence.

Long homopolymers frequently induce false-positive allele
calls and it is challenging to distinguish them from true variants.
The reasons for homopolymer error occurrence are different for
each sequencing technology. The pyrosequencing technology uti-
lized by 454 Life Sciences generates high-signal intensity for a
repeating sequence of a single-base type then base-calling soft-
ware estimates the number of bases in the sequence proportional
to that intensity (Supplementary Fig. S3A). As a result, this tech-
nology shows a higher rate of INDEL sequencing errors than
other sequencing technologies. Sanger sequencing and Illumina
sequencing technologies employ a dye-terminator-sequencing
method which shows a signiﬁcantly lower INDEL error rate.
However, this sequencing approach also shows increased
INDEL error rate as homopolymer length in sequence reads in-
creases. In Sanger sequencing, intensities from repetitive bases
often merge to make a continuously high-signal peak or affect
intensities of neighborhood peaks, thus the boundaries or heights
of peaks for individual bases that compose the repeat become
ambiguous (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Base-calling programs
(Ewing et al., 1998) for this method use spacing information
estimated from unambiguous peaks to identify the number of
repetitive bases from the merged intensities and can predict
more or fewer bases than the actual number of bases. Ilumina
sequencing also has been reported to generate homopolymer-
related errors in the study of this article (Supplementary Fig.
S4) and other studies (Albers et al., 2011), and it may be
caused by several noise factors (Erlich et al., 2008) such as lag-
ging or leading of nucleotide extension.

In this article, we utilize a Gaussian distribution to compensate
for a common characteristic of several different sequencing tech-
nologies, in which INDEL events at a single nucleotide repeat are
caused by incorrect signal intensities and the chances of insertion
errors and deletion errors in a repeat are proportional (when the
rate of insertion errors increases, deletion errors also increases)
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Bidirectional INDELs have also been
observed from mutations at microsatellite loci caused by poly-
merase slippage during DNA replication (Xu et al., 2000). To
fully address this issue, we have combined the discretized
Gaussian mixture model with a rules-based approach to geno-
type length variation of microsatellites loci from short-sequence
reads. The genotyping method is composed of two regression
steps (Fig. 1A and C) and a homopolymer decomposition step
(Fig. 1B), which effectively ﬁlters out noise reads resulting in low
false-positive and false-negative rates.

2 METHODS

2.1 Discretized Gaussian mixture distribution

When three or more allele candidates are detected from sequence reads
mapped to a microsatellite locus in a reference sequence of a diploid
genome, the simplest approach to decide the genotype of the locus is to

choose two alleles with the highest read frequencies. The frequencies of
reads containing the two different alleles are then compared to test
whether the genotype of the locus is homozygous or heterozygous.
If the ratio of the read count of the lower read frequency allele to the
read count of the higher read frequency allele is larger than a given cutoff
ratio [generally 0.25 (2 02/08)], the locus is determined to be heterozy-
gous. Otherwise, the locus is determined as homozygous and the reads
containing the lower read frequency allele are regarded as noise from
sequencing or PCR ampliﬁcation errors, individual cell mutation, mis-
alignment or mis—mapping. The most frequently observed noise source is
homopolymer errors. Homopolymer errors are observed not only at
single long-homopolymers sequences, but also at repeats of motifs con-
taining short homopolymers. Since the homopolymer error in microsat-
ellite sequences alters their lengths in the sequence reads, the observed
ratio of read counts supporting two different alleles at a single locus
containing a long homopolymer may be different from the ratio of gen-
omic DNA fragments derived from the alleles. This inconsistency can be
addressed by using a discretized Gaussian distribution if we assume that
the probability of invalid signal intensities generated by sequencing ma-
chines for target nucleotides follows a continuous distribution and we
only observe values discretized by base-calling programs. Since probabil-
ities of insertion and deletion errors in a sequence are proportional, they
can be calculated from the cumulative distribution function of the
Gaussian distribution. Let [L be the length of a candidate allele L at a
target locus and let x be the observed length of the microsatellite sequence
with INDEL errors in a read mapped to the locus with an assumption in
which the length x is derived from the original length IL. Let F L(t) and
fL(t) denote the distribution and the density functions of a Gaussian
random variable with mean IL and variance of, respectively. Then the
probability mass function pL(x) of x is

1 x+0.5

pm) = P(X = xllmi) = T405) 05

fL(I)dt (1)
where x: 0, 1, 2,. . . , and 1/(1—FL(0.5)) is a scale factor (Supplementary
Material, Rescaling the Gaussian cumulative distribution function
section).

For the heterozygous loci with allele lengths, [L1 and [L2, we can use the
mixture distribution of the Equation (1) as follows

gee) = gee; L1,L2,ai1,ai2,6) = 6 me) + <1 — 61pm) (2)

Where 6 is the unknown mixture proportion parameter for reads derived
from one of the two alleles, regard1555ess of the repeat sequence length x.
It is also assumed that the associated parameters 0‘le and oLzz are both
unknown. These parameters can be estimated by an NLS regression func-
tion (Supplementary Material, Pseudo code applying the Nonlinear
Least-Squares regression section).

If the sequence reads mapped to a same microsatellite locus contain
INDEL errors, the number of observed lengths of the microsatellite at the
locus would be 22. Because the inherited alleles are unknown, all
observed lengths are allele candidates. We then apply the g(x) function
for each combination of two allele candidates (two same candidates for
homozygous genotype), calculate the squared error of each combination,
and select the allele pair, L1* and L2: that generates the minimum
squared error as follows

all candidates xza

b
G(L’f,L§)= argmin {Zn}, —g(x;L1,L2,a§,,a§,,e))2} (3)

where 0,, is an observed proportion of reads containing a length x micro-
satellite sequence, a is the minimum observed length minus a ﬁxed amount
k, and b is the maximum observed length plus k, where k is set to be ﬁve as
default value. This is necessary because the g(x) function generates output
values for all possible sequence lengths, the comparison between observed
proportions and expected proportions need to be extended beyond the

minimum and maximum observed lengths. Therefore, the boundaries of
the calculation are extended by an additional value k.

As an example, suppose that we have 2, 8 and 4 mapped reads con-
taining microsatellite sequences with lengths 14, 15 and 16 bases, respect-
ively, at a locus. The list of possible genotype candidates G(l L1, [L2) for the
locus are G(14, 14), G(14, 15), G(14, 16), G(15, 15), G(15, 16) and G(16,
16). In the example, the observed minimum and maximum lengths are 14
and 16, respectively, and the observed and expected values from the
Equation (3) are compared for x ranging from 9 to 21. While the
observed ratio of read counts between the highest read frequency allele
(1L1: 15) and the second highest read frequency allele (1L2: 16) is 0.5
(= 4/8), the read ratio of those two alleles estimated by the NLS function
was 0.163 (2 (1—6)/6= 0.14/0.86) (Fig. 1A). The difference between the
two estimated ratios may result in a different decision for the genotype
calls, depending on the cutoff ratio to determine if the second highest read
frequency allele candidate is noise.

2.2 Preprocessing

We provide two additional PERL scripts along with GenoTan for the
preprocessing of data. The ﬁrst script searches for microsatellite loci and

the second script realigns sequence reads mapped to the microsatellite
loci. GenoTan takes a reference ﬁle, a list of microsatellite loci and
BAM/SAM format ﬁles containing mapping results as input. If users
do not submit a microsatellite list, GenoTan searches pure microsatellite
loci from the reference. For users who want to use TRF (Benson 1999),
an additional PERL script to convert the TRF results to the microsatellite
list is available in our software package. For each locus, it then chooses
allele candidates which satisfy three conditions: (i) at least two reads
supporting the same allele candidate overlap at least three bases for
both ﬂanking sequences and they are not technical duplications (same
mapping position and same sequence); (ii) microsatellite sequences of at
least two reads supporting the same allele candidate have fewer than 10%
mismatches in their length; and (iii) a consensus sequence of the reads
span at least ﬁve bases at both ﬂanking sequences. GenoTan then com-
pares the genotype candidates to ﬁnd the most likely genotype.

2.3 Two-step estimation

The whole process of genotyping consists of a two-step estimation
(Fig. 1). In the ﬁrst step, rough estimates ﬁnd the candidate genotypes
of microsatellite loci using the regression model described by the previous

Discretized Gaussian mixture for microsatellite genotyping

 

section and the method at ‘decision process to ﬁnalize genotyping call’
decides genotypes. In the second step, the regression method requires two
additional parameters which are estimated from the results of the ﬁrst
regression step. The ﬁrst parameter, wL, represents error bias toward
deletion or insertion depending on the homopolymer length in an allele
candidate L. Since the Gaussian distribution has a symmetric form, the
Equation (1) generates symmetric probabilities for deletion and insertion
errors for any allele, which does not ﬁt real data. It can be adjusted by
adding additional parameters can and (on to 11.1 and 11.2, respectively, as
follows (Supplementary Fig. S6)

fL1(l) ~ Mm = In + (0me = oil),

2 2 (4)
fL2(l) ~ NW2 = [L2 + 042,02 = 0L2)-

Then, Equations (1) and (2) can generate different probabilities for dele-
tion and insertion errors depending on the homopolymer length in L1 or
L2. To estimate wL for each allele candidate L, we use a homopolymer
decomposition method which decomposes a given microsatellite sequence
into a set of homopolymers and then estimates parameters from the set
(Supplementary Material, Homopolymer decomposition section for
detail).

The second parameter, UL, represents a variance of the prior probabil-
ity distribution of read proportions for x derived from an allele candidate
L. To apply the homopolymer effect to the NLS regression, we use dif-
ferent pseudo counts for different repeats based on the parameter. A data
vector for the NLS regression is initialized to 0 and pseudo counts (posi-
tive fractions) estimated from the g(x; [L1, [L2, Um, ULz, 0.5) function in
which the parameters are {012: on, 022: ULz, 6 = 0.5} are added to the
vector (Supplementary Material, Pseudo code applying the Nonlinear
Least-Squares regression section). The parameter UL for each allele can-
didate L is also estimated by the homopolymer decomposition method.
(The NLS regression function to estimate 0L1, on and 6 requires as input
a data vector containing the observed read proportions for length x
microsatellite sequences. These estimated parameters are then used to
calculate the probability of each x to be observed in a read at a locus.
Recall that, the probability varies depending on the length of the homo-
polymer in the microsatellite sequence. Since the ﬁrst regression step uses
only the read proportions to estimate 0L1, on and 6, the estimated values
of the parameters are always the same regardless of the lengths of homo-
polymers in alleles, if two or more different loci have different repeat
sequences but contain the same proportions of reads. However, we
have observed that the probability of the INDEL error increases with
long homopolymer repeats, so we use pseudo counts for different
repeats.)

Instead of the numbers of reads, sums of mapping probabilities of
reads containing length x microsatellite sequences are added to the
vector. If mapping probabilities of reads are high, their sum is near
the number of the reads. Then, the values in the vector are converted
to the proportions. If on and ULZ are large and the number of total reads
is small, the values in the vector get dispersed and the NLS function
estimates large 0L1 and 0L2. But when the number of total reads is big,
the effect of Um and ULZ becomes small.

2.4 Decision process to ﬁnalize genotyping call

The most probable genotype for a given set of sequence reads mapped to
a locus is decided by the Equation (3). But the equation shows a tendency
to call heterozygous genotypes, because the Gaussian mixture model is a
better ﬁt to the training data when more distributions are mixed.
However, since reads supporting one or both predicted alleles may be
from noise including individual cell mutation, PCR ampliﬁcation error,
sequencing error and mis—mapping, an evaluation method is necessary.
We use a rule-based approach to choose alleles and to decide the homo-
zygosity of each locus because the frequencies of INDEL error reads
derived from mis—mapping, PCR ampliﬁcation error and individual cell

mutation are more difﬁcult to measure than that from the sequencing
error. The rule-based approach also offers users an opportunity to adjust
the boundary parameters to ﬁlter ambiguous loci, while most statistical
approaches, including Bayesian approaches, adhere to strict decisions with
limited user control (Supplementary Material, Limitation of the Bayesian
approach considering only sequencing errors for INDEL genotyping sec-
tion). For this approach, we assign a conﬁdence score to each allele instead
of calculating the probability of a genotype (a two allele set) for a locus.
The probability of each allele can be generated by the Equation (1) as
pL1(lL1) or pL2(lL2) if we assume the read frequencies from two different
alleles at the heterozygotic locus are not correlated. However DNA frag-
ments from two paired chromosomes have the same probability of being
sequenced and the read frequencies of two alleles would tend to be similar.
If the proportion of reads for an allele candidate LIOW with lower read
frequency is too small compared to that for another allele candidate
Lhigh with higher read frequency (e.g. 0.1 versus 0.9), we may conclude
that the reads for the allele candidate LIOW are from noise and the locus is
homozygous. Considering this condition, we multiply the ratio of 610W
to 6mgh and the output of leOW (ILIOW), where 610W is the output of
MIN{6, 1—6} and 6mgh is the output of MAX{6, 1—6}. The conﬁdence
scores of two allele candidate are then deﬁned by

in... (12,). (5)
high

Chigh : pth-gh (lbw-gm): Claw : 6

In the ﬁnal tabulation, an allele candidate from the predicted genotype is
removed when its conﬁdence score is lower than a given cutoff value (0.35
for Lhigh and 0.25 for LIOW) (Supplementary Fig. S7). When only conﬁ-
dence score of LIOW is lower than the cutoff value, GenoTan generates a
partial genotype call for the locus in which only one allele is called while
the other allele is reported as unknown. GenoTan only reports the geno-
type of the locus as homozygous when the number of reads supporting
the selected allele is >4 and its conﬁdence score is 20.9. The conﬁdence
score of the second allele, Lhighz, at a homozygous locus is calculated by

Chi-gm = Chem x [1 — o.s<read  supporting Lev] (6)

where [0.5”] represents the probability of the other unobserved allele exists
when 11 reads support the selected allele.

3 RESULTS

Our method (GenoTan) was compared to GATK (v1.6.9 with
‘-T UniﬁedGenotyper -glm INDEL’), Dindel (v1.01 with options
in Supplementary Materials), SAMtools (v0.1.18 with the
‘varFilter’ post-ﬁlter) and RepeaSeq (v0.7.2) in genotyping per-
formance using four different test sets including simulated data,
mixed sequence data of two Drosophila inbred lines, sequence
data of a single Drosophila inbred line and sequence data of a
human sample. For the performance test, we compared INDEL
lengths in microsatellite loci identiﬁed by the programs ([allele
length] 2 [reference length] — [INDEL length]). In simulated data-
sets, true positive alleles do not have INDELs at multiple pos-
itions in their sequences. Partial genotypes called by GenoTan
were counted as the homozygous calls to follow the traditional
classiﬁcation of the other programs. lobSTR could not be
included in most tests since its target loci were limited (only
analyzing 2~6-mer motif repeat loci).

3.1 Performance test with simulated data

The ﬁrst dataset was simulated data created as sequence reads of
a single individual diploid genome. The reference sequence for
this data was created from the human chromosome 1 (build 37)

after removing all repeat sequences identiﬁed by RepeatMasker
(http://repeatmasker.org), and microsatellites of 1~8-mer motifs
with 8~48 bases in length (4~25 repeats of a motif in a sequence)
were inserted at 20 700 loci, one for every 140 bases of the ref-
erence sequence. The loci included 300 replicates of each micro-
satellite in which each 100 replicates were used for non-reference
alleles of homozygous loci, reference/non-reference alleles of het-
erozygous loci and two different non-reference alleles of hetero-
zygous loci, respectively. For each locus, three different read sets
in 10, 20 and 40x sequence coverage were generated, and all
reads overlapped at least 7 bases with both ﬂanking sequences
of the microsatellite locus. Then, INDEL/substitution errors de-
pending on the homopolymer contexts of alleles were inserted at
random positions of read sequences (Supplementary Table S1).

GenoTan (with ‘-L off” which turns off the normalization of
read counts using the allele lengths) achieved the highest overall
performances in all coverages (Fig. 2A and Supplementary
Table S2), most notably for the non-reference homozygous loci
(Fig. 2B). In this test, GATK and SAMtools did not predict
NR/NR (non-reference/non—reference) heterozygous genotypes
and RepeatSeq did not predict NR homozygous genotypes cor-
rectly, while GenoTan identiﬁed homozygous, heterozygous
R/NR (reference/non-reference) and heterozygous NR/NR
genotypes with very high correct rate (97.4%, 93.5% and
93.7% with 40x coverage, respectively) (Fig. 2B, C and D).
Dindel showed slightly higher correct rate (94.6 % versus
93.5%) than GenoTan in calling R/NR heterozygous loci with
40x coverage presumably due to Dindel’s algorithm favoring ref-
erence allele calls. For allele level comparison, GenoTan had very
low rates of missed and wrong allele calls for both homozygous
(Fig. 2E) and heterozygous loci (Fig. 2F) at all coverage depths.
At error abundant loci, GenoTan showed low rates of missed
and wrong allele calls compared to the other programs
(Supplementary Figures S8, S9 and S10).

3.2 Performance test with mixed sequence data of two
Drosophila inbred lines

To evaluate the performance of GenoTan for diploid genome
datasets, the second dataset was created by merging sequence
reads of two different Drosophila inbred lines RAL-365 and
RAL-375 [SRA: SRX000537, SRA:SRX000538] (Illumina 36
cycle single-end sequencing) downloaded from the SRA website
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). From the datasets, the
sequence coverage averaged 23x, which was sufﬁcient to make
reliable allele calls for many loci. The reference genome sequence
was NCBI release_5_30 of Drosophila melanogaster. A list of
microsatellite loci was generated from the reference by searching
microsatellites of 1~8-mer motifs with a minimum three in
repeat number and a minimum 10 bases (10 bases for 1- and
2-mer, and 12 bases the other motifs) in length. When a distance
of two loci was <10 bases, they were merged into a single locus.
The original Drosophila inbred line study (Mackay et al., 2012)
also analyzed microsatellite genotypes, but we did not use the
data since many allele calls from the study for our target loci
were inconsistent with our read alignments (the data is not
shown).

The number of sequence reads in SRX000538 was reduced so
that an equal number of reads was used for both samples (the
end of SRR001962.fastq was clipped). To create the input for
GenoTan, BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) and GATK were used to
map the sequence reads to the reference and to realign the reads,
respectively. And microsatellite loci satisfying the following three
conditions were chosen for the performance comparison. First,
at each locus for both samples, the minimum number of reads
supporting an allele and overlapping at least 3 bases to both
ﬂanking sequences of a microsatellite locus was 2. Second, at
each locus for both samples, the number of reads supporting
the second highest read frequency allele candidate was no more
than half of the read supporting the major allele candidate at a
locus. The second condition reduced the number of loci from
possible replicated sequences such as transposon elements,
which might result in incorrect validation. Third, alleles from
one or both samples at the same locus were non-reference alleles.
A total of 3300 loci (770 homozygous and 2530 heterozygous
loci) were selected and the average number of reads completely
covering repeat sequences per locus was 10.9.

Since we ﬁltered out the microsatellite loci in which the num-
bers of reads supporting major allele candidates of each inbred
were ambiguous (see Methods section for the details), we
assumed that all alleles at the test microsatellite loci were clearly
identiﬁed. The data does not include reference/reference homo-
zygous loci because we selected loci containing at least one non-
reference allele. GenoTan identiﬁed 90.2% of microsatellite loci
correctly while RepeatSeq, GATK and Dindel called 61.7%,
45.9% and 77.9% of loci correctly (Fig. 3A). SAMtools and
GATK had the highest no-call rates (59.9% and 45.4%) presum-
ably because they required a high number of sequence reads
which were consistent with their consensus to call an allele.
GenoTan showed the highest proportion of correct genotype
calls for both homozygous and heterozygous loci in all sequence
coverage (Fig. 3B), but called a slightly higher proportion
(12.3%) of incorrect genotypes for low sequence coverage
(5~10x) heterozygous loci than Dindel (10.6%). Most

Fig. 3. The performance comparison for the mixed sequence data of two
different Drosophila inbred lines. All microsatellite loci contain at least one
non-reference allele. (A) The proportions of no-calls, incorrect calls and
correct calls for the mixed sequence data. (B) The detailed proportions of
calls at different sequence coverage for homozygous and heterozygous loci

false-positive alleles called by the genotyping programs, except
GenoTan and RepeatSeq, were reference allele calls (no-INDEL
call) in the incorrect heterozygous genotype calls for homozy-
gous loci. To prevent other programs calling genotypes with se-
quence reads not completely covering microsatellites, we ﬁltered
out the reads and tested RepeatSeq, GATK and Dindel again
(Supplementary Fig. S11), but the programs did not show sig-
niﬁcant improvement.

3.3 Performance test with sequence data of a single
Drosophila inbred line

The third dataset was sequence reads of a single Drosophila
inbred line RAL-301 [SRA: SRX000530] (Illumina 36-cycle
single-end sequencing). This dataset was used to compare the
incorrect genotype calls of the genotyping programs for the
homozygous loci. The reference genome sequence was the same
as that use in the second dataset and the list of microsatellite loci
included additional loci for 8 and 9 base homopolymers. After
BWA mapping and GATK realignment, microsatellite loci sat-
isfying the following three conditions were chosen for the com-
parison. First, the minimum number of reads supporting a same
allele length and overlapping at least three bases to both ﬂanking
sequences of a microsatellite locus was 4. Second, at least one
read completely covering the locus contained INDEL errors or
misalignments in the microsatellite. Third, the number of reads
supporting the second highest read frequency allele candidate
was not more than half of the reads supporting the major
allele candidate at a locus. As a result, a total of 1304 loci
were selected. The average sequence coverage of the whole
genome was 21x and the average number of reads completely
covering a microsatellite (three base overlapping with both ﬂank-
ing sequences of the microsatellite) per locus was 14.9.
GenoTan showed superior performance at the loci covered by
reads supporting multiple allele candidates (Fig. 4A and
Supplementary Fig. S13). Notably, when the number of allele
candidates was :3 at a locus, the proportion of incorrect geno-
types called by the other programs increased while that by
GenoTan decreased. This indicated that the discretized
Gaussian mixture model improved performance at noise-abun-
dant loci. Figure 4B shows proportions of incorrect calls at
microsatellite loci with different motif lengths. We visually

inspected the incorrectly called loci of 2,3-mer motifs and
observed the presence of a few noise reads at each locus, which
might be derived from mis-mapping, PCR ampliﬁcation error or
individual cell mutation. It was also possible that the reads sup-
porting the major allele candidates of the microsatellite loci were
mis-mapped, but we could not distinguish between these possible
scenarios. The length of a microsatellite allele is also an import-
ant factor that affects the accuracy of genotyping (Fig. 4C), as
the length of the allele gets longer, there are fewer reads com-
pletely spanning the repeat sequence. Especially, because sequen-
cing machines frequently fail to generate sequence reads
including long homopolymers, the rate of reads covering the
homopolymer sequence decreases signiﬁcantly (Supplementary
Fig. S13). When the length of an allele was :14 bases in the
test data, 2-mer motif microsatellites became dominant because
most homopolymer microsatellites were not covered at a sufﬁ-
cient read depth to call genotypes. Since polymer motif micro-
satellites produced much fewer sequencing errors and higher
sequence coverage than homopolymers, the rate of ‘no-call’
loci dramatically decreased, but most programs became more
sensitive to noise reads (due to PCR ampliﬁcation error or indi-
vidual cell mutation) at polymer motif microsatellite loci.

3.4 Comparison with two sequencing datasets from a
single human individual

As a ﬁnal test, we used two sequencing datasets from blood and
saliva samples from a single human individual [SRA:
SRX097307, SRA: SRX097312] (Illumina 101-cycle paired-end
sequencing), which contains 1499 021 500 and 3 040 306 840
reads, respectively. The reads were aligned to the human
genome reference NCBI build 37 by BWA and realigned by
GATK. To create a list of microsatellite loci, TRF (Benson,
1999) was used to search repeat sequences including incomplete
repeat sets. Loci containing at least 10 bases for l-mer, 12 bases
for 2-mer and 15 bases for 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-mer of pure repeat se-
quences were selected for evaluation. When two microsatellite
loci were within 40 bases, they were merged into one locus. To
check for uniqueness of microsatellite ﬂanking sequences, a 30-
base sequence which included a 25-base ﬂanking sequence and a
5-base microsatellite sequence was extracted from each side of
the microsatellite and mapped by BWA to a reference sequence.
When BWA did not assign the maximum mapping scores (Q37,
Phred quality score) to both ﬂanking sequences of the microsat-
ellite, the microsatellite was removed from the target microsatel-
lite list. As results, we obtained 58 245 microsatellite loci in
chromosome 1. Among them, 57 603 and 57 693 loci were com-
pletely covered by 1 810477 reads of the blood sample and
3 373 598 reads of the saliva samples, respectively. Most of the
reads (1 396 921 reads of blood and 2 610 205 of saliva) supported
reference alleles. Since it was difﬁcult to distinguish true positive
calls from false-positive calls in genotyping results for the micro-
satellites especially for loci containing homopolymers from a
human genome, we simply measured the number of loci consist-
ent and inconsistent within genotyping results for the two differ-
ent samples using RepeatSeq, GATK, Dindel and GenoTan
(Fig. 5). To analyze the difference, microsatellite loci containing
at least one non-reference allele identiﬁed by each program were
compared. The numbers of loci called for only one sample were

Fig. 5. Comparison of microsatellite loci containing non-reference alleles
identiﬁed in two sequence datasets from a single human individual. Two
sequencing datasets from blood and saliva samples from a single human
individual were used to measure the consistency of genotyping results
generated by RepeatSeq, GATK, Dindel and GenoTan. The numbers
in the diagrams are the numbers of microsatellite loci containing at
least one non-reference allele identiﬁed by each program for two different
samples. The consistency of the genotyping results generated by each
program was measured by (number of consistent calls)/(number of con-
sistent calls + nummber of inconsistent calls)

not directly compared because we could not know whether the
genotypes for the same loci in the other sample were called as
homozygous reference allele loci or were not called. RepeatSeq,
GATK, Dindel and GenoTan identiﬁed heterozygous alleles
from 11 596, 13 640, 16074 and 14277 loci in both samples, re-
spectively. Though Dindel genotyped the highest number of loci
(12 368 loci) consistently, it also had high number of loci (3706
loci) inconsistently called. The consistency rate of the genotyping
results was measured by [(number of consistent calls)/(number of
consistent calls + number of inconsistent calls)] and GenoTan
showed the highest consistency rate (0.85) while RepeatSeq,
GATK and Dindel showed 0.39, 0.82 and 0.77, respectively.

3.5 Other comparisons

GenoTan is computationally fast which provides a signiﬁcant
competitive performance advantage. While GenoTan could

genotype 20 700 loci in the 40x sequence coverage simulated
data in 9m 20 s, GATK and Dindel genotyped them in 57m
40 s and 4 h 53 m 4 s, respectively. RepeatSeq archived the fastest
speed (15 s), but it showed high false-negative rates in all tests.
The additional comparisons of computational speeds are avail-
able in Supplementary Table S3.

The performance of genotyping programs were compared for
different mapping results generated by two different mapping
programs, BWA and Novoalign (http://novocraft.com).
Simulated sequence reads for the Drosophila reference sequence
were generated by pIRS (Hu et al., 2012) (Supplementary
Material, Performance test with two different mapping program
for simulated data generated by pIRS from the Drosophila
reference section for detail). The genotyping results from
lobSTR for target microsatellite loci were also compared and
evaluated. GATK, DIndel, GenoTan and RepeatSeq had correct
percentages of 79.8%, 92.4%, 91.8% and 53.7% with BWA
mapping, respectively, and 84.3%, 95.6%, 95.4% and 55.0%
with Novoalign mapping. Not relying on these mapping pro-
grams, lobSTR had 2.8% of correct calls. It should be noted
that for RepeatSeq and lobSTR, many genotypes were not
wrong, but were uncalled. High false-negative rate of lobSTR
is consistent with results in the RepeatSeq study (Highnam
et al., 2012). All loci in our test set contained at least one non-
reference allele but lobSTR called only reference alleles for many
loci.

4 DISCUSSION

Here we presented GenoTan, a method using a discretized
Gaussian mixture model combined with a rules-based approach
to identify inherited alleles of microsatellite loci from NGS data,
which often contain noise reads caused by substitution/INDEL
sequencing error, PCR ampliﬁcation error or individual cell
mutation, without paired-end information. It also employs an
additional novel approach, homopolymer decomposition, to es-
timate error bias toward deletion or insertion in homopolymer
runs. Combining these approaches, we were able to successfully
genotype microsatellite loci from both simulated data and real

Discretized Gaussian mixture for microsatellite genotyping

 

data quickly without biased calls taken to be references alleles,
while other approaches required 5~30>< more computational
time than GenoTan and favored calling reference alleles. In
our experiments, the rule-based approach had better accuracy
in distinguishing noise from inherited alleles at the microsatellite
loci than the Bayesian approach used by GATK and Dindel.
This is because noise reads at the microsatellite loci were derived
not only from sequencing errors, but also from mis-mapping,
PCR ampliﬁcation error and individual cell mutation, of which
error frequencies are very difﬁcult to measure using statistical
methods. The discretized Gaussian mixture also showed
enhanced performance in reducing noise at noise-abundant loci
covered by sequence reads containing long homopolymers which
often induce substitution and INDEL sequencing errors. Two
programs, lobSTR and RepeatSeq, have been developed to
genotype speciﬁcally microsatellites, but since they did not call
genotypes for many loci in our test sets, of which all loci con-
tained at least one non-reference allele and true alleles were
clearly identiﬁed, their performance is still unknown. In addition,
RepeatSeq frequently calls more than two alleles for a locus and
may perform better with sequencing data of tumor samples to
search for multiple alleles.

Even though GenoTan has improved performance in control-
ling homopolymer errors, it, like other methods, has limitations.
GenoTan has been designed to detected microsatellite variants
shorter than read lengths, but long microsatellite sequences are
frequently observed and are not addressed by this method. And
it requires high sequence coverage to reliably estimate genotypes.
These two limitations are common to many genotyping pro-
grams and may be reduced by advanced sequencing technologies
producing longer reads and higher coverage than the current
technologies, even if the homopolymer error problems found in
various technologies continue.

Mismapping is also still problematic for genotyping. We visu-
ally inspected the loci incorrectly called by genotyping programs
from Drosophila inbred line sequencing data and observed sev-
eral loci covered by reads which appeared to be mismapped, in
which the true alleles could not be identiﬁed. Most genotyping
programs including GanoTan incorporate the mapping quality
scores generated by mapping programs into their methods to
control for incorrectly mapped reads. However relying on the
mapping quality scores could result false positive prediction in
INDEL genotypes, since mapping programs often fail to map
reads containing microsatellite variants and generate incorrect
quality scores. Reducing the effect of incorrectly mapped reads
remains a challenge for genotyping programs.

Since genotyping more complex genomes, such as human, is
signiﬁcantly more difﬁcult due to the abundance of transposable
elements that interfere with mapping and are commonly asso-
ciated with microsatellite loci, we indirectly compared the per-
formance of genotyping programs for two matched sequencing
datasets (blood and saliva) from a single human individual. With

the human data, GenoTan showed the highest concordance for
these two genotyping tests.

Lastly, GenoTan was designed to call only two alleles as pa-
ternal and maternal alleles, while many alleles could be acquired
after birth especially in tumor cells. The current version treats the
acquired alleles as noise (individual cell mutation), but next ver-
sion should be available to call more than two alleles to address
this issue.

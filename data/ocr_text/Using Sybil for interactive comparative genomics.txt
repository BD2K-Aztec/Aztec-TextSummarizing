ABSTRACT

Motivation: Analysis of multiple genomes requires sophisticated
tools that provide search, visualization, interactivity and data
export. Comparative genomics datasets tend to be large and
complex, making development of these tools difficult. In addition
to scalability, comparative genomics tools must also provide user-
friendly interfaces such that the research scientist can explore
complex data with minimal technical expertise.

Results: We describe a new version of the Sybil software package
and its application to the important human pathogen Streptococcus
pneumoniae. This new software provides a feature-rich set of
comparative genomics tools for inspection of multiple genome
structures, mining of orthologous gene families and identification of
potential vaccine candidates.

Availability: The S.pneumoniae resource is online at http://
strepneumo-sybil.igs.umaryland.edu. The software, database and
website are available for download as a portable virtual machine and
from http://sourceforge.net/projects/sybil.

1 INTRODUCTION

The increasing throughput and reduced cost of second— and third—
generation DNA sequencing technologies has resulted in a deluge
of genome sequence data in the public domain. These require
efﬁcient bioinformatics tools enabling Visualization and mining
of multigenome comparisons. Such tools are difﬁcult to develop
because of the size and complexity of such large—scale comparisons.
The challenge is to develop a tool that can be ﬂexible, extensible
and usable while providing the following four basic features: search,
Visualization, interactivity and export.

1.1 Search

The Internet and the ubiquity of Google, Yahoo and Bing have
proven that when datasets become extremely large, search becomes
a critical entry point. Internet searching is typically done based on
unstructured keyword searches with some structured ﬁlters such as

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

date or country of origin. In the case of biological data, structured
and unstructured searches are both important features. Unstructured
keyword searching gives users the power to ﬁnd items of interest
based on free text that matches against ﬁelds like gene name or
gene function in the same way one might search the Internet.
Structured search parameters include ﬁltering for source organism,
feature length, presence of a particular motif and overlap with
another feature of interest. Both these search strategies combined
can form the basis of a powerful tool with the ability to ﬁnd a
reasonable number of features of interest in an otherwise vast and
inaccessible dataset. BioMart (Smedley et al., 2009) is a widely used
tool that integrates large datasets and provides advanced structured
and unstructured search capability. While not speciﬁcally designed
for comparative genomics, BioMart’s power includes its ﬂexibility
in handling data of many different types and formats. It is in this spirit
that search capability should be implemented into a full—featured
comparative genomics tool.

1.2 Visualization

Summarizing large datasets in pictures can reveal important patterns
and results in the data and can serve as a valuable entry point for
data querying. Illustrating a small—scale genomic rearrangement or
deletion is typically the most effective way to describe the event.
Existing comparative genomics Visualization tools include linear
genome browsers, dot—plot Viewers and circular genome Viewers
(Nielsen et al., 2010). Linear browsers draw pictograms of the genes
in the genome with links between related genes or regions. For
example, SynView (Wang et al., 2006), Gbrowse—syn (McKay et al.,
2010) and SynBrowse (Pan et al., 2005) are linear browsers useful
for comparing genomic regions between a few genomes. The UCSC
genome browser (Kent at al., 2002) and VISTA (Frazer et al., 2004)
are linear representations providing conservation plots that indicate
regions where the genomes share conserved primary sequence.
Such conservation plots can provide a high—level Visualization of
whole genome alignments. This type of View is most useful when
looking at large, distantly related genomes. Dot—plot Viewers are an
alternative way of Visualizing whole genome alignment data with
a particular emphasis on large—scale changes in synteny and indel
detection. Dot—plots are limited in that they can only compare a
limited number of genomes at once and typically do not display
annotated feature information. The whole genome aligner Mauve
has a built—in Viewer that color—codes locally syntenic regions across
several genomes (Darling et al., 2004). GMAJ is another Viewer that
specializes in displaying whole genome alignment data as percent

identity plots and dot—plots (Blanchette et al., 2004). These tools
are particularly useful when looking for large—scale rearrangements,
insertions and deletions. Circular representations like those from the
Circos package (Krzywinski et al., 2009) draw genomes in a circle
and draw arcs between regions of conservation. These displays can
capture much of the information of the linear browser with the added
beneﬁt of being compact and having fewer line crossings. Circular
browsers can also work at the whole—genome scale. The challenge
for comparative genomics visualization methods is including the
ability to navigate seamlessly from a whole genome view that
accurately depicts feature content and conservation information to
a localized view that provides detailed imagery of genomic features
and comparisons.

1.3 Interactivity

While search and visualization can provide valuable entry points
to large datasets, the ability to interact with these results turns a
simple tool into a powerful application. The power to sort results
by any ﬁeld, further reﬁne results and navigate to visualizations
makes search a jump—off point to more in—depth data mining. A
more difﬁcult feature to implement is interactivity of visualizations.
Giving the user the power to obtain detailed information about drawn
features, download sequence data and navigate to other views for a
different perspective make an otherwise static graphic into another
powerful entry point. Gbrowse—based (Stein et al., 2002) tools have
the ability to leverage mouseover events, which give these tools
the power to hide detailed information from the visualization until
requested. Clicking on gene features in these tools can bring the user
to a report page with additional details about the gene. Similarly,
the UCSC genome browser provides several links to more detailed
information about the different features it can display. These features
allow the user to begin at a particular search result or graphic and
investigate features of interest without having the impression of
reaching a dead end.

1.4 Data export

Export is essential in allowing users the ﬂexibility to take data and
results out of the system for publication and further inspection.
In large comparative genomics datasets, interactive search and
visualization capabilities are used to identify a set of genes, gene
clusters or genomic regions of particular interest. Export of these
data allows for additional analyses outside of the tool. Data export
can include the ability to capture a vector graphics—based publication
quality image, a table or a FASTA ﬁle for use in downstream
bioinformatics analyses.

1.5 Sybil

With Sybil, we sought to combine interactive search, visualization
and data export in a dynamic web—based comparative genomics
software package that provides the freedom to analyze many data
types in a comparative genomics context (Crabtree et al., 2007).
The Sybil suite of feature—rich web tools allows users to search and
visualize several genomes based on clusters of orthologous genes.
The views in Sybil are interactive allowing users to click on each
drawn feature to retrieve more detailed information. Navigation
between views is supported and provides Sybil with the unique
ability to explore from the whole genome level to the protein and
nucleotide multiple sequence alignment level without leaving the

application. Export of tab—delimited tables, sequence data, and SVG
and PDF publication—quality ﬁgures is possible from many of the
views.

The Strepneumo Sybil—based website http://strepneumo—sybil
.igs.umaryland.edu was developed as a comparative genomics
resource to house all published, annotated genome sequences
of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. The aim of
the project focused primarily on combining annotated genomics
data in a comparative context with several additional data types
related to vaccine candidate identiﬁcation. Infections caused by
S.pneumoniae continue to be a major cause of human morbidity
and mortality worldwide (O’Brien et al., 2009). This is a result
of the pathogen’s extreme adaptability that leads to antibiotic
resistance and escape from the current polysaccharide capsule—
based vaccines (Mera et al., 2008). There is a crucial need for
novel candidates for the development of efﬁcacious protein—based
vaccines. Efﬁcient mining of the wealth of genome sequence data
available for S.pneumoniae will open novel avenues for vaccine
development.

2 METHODS
2.1 Clustering

Multigenome homologous gene clusters are the primary comparative data
type in Sybil. These clusters must be pre—computed and loaded into a
relational database that supports the Sybil software. Gene clusters are treated
as generic objects and alternative clustering methods can be used. For the
Strepneumo site, the clusters were generated using a modiﬁed form of
reciprocal best BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) match corrected for paralogs
as described in Crabtree et al. (2007). In brief, an all—vs.—all BLASTP with
an e—value cutoff of le—05, a percent identity cutoff of 80% and a percent
coverage cutoff of 70% results in a hit graph. The hit graph is used to ﬁrst
identify homologs within a single genome, termed paralogs. Paralogs are
grouped by computing a Jaccard similarity coefﬁcient (Jaccard, 1908) for
each pair of proteins and applying a cutoff of 0.6. The resulting groups of
paralogs and singleton genes are used as input to identify clusters of genes
across genomes or orthologs. In the most basic example, two genes are
grouped in an ortholo g cluster if they are from different genomes and are each
other’s best hit, or reciprocal best BLAST match. When orthology involves
J accard paralog clusters, all the genes in the cluster are treated together such
that any member that is a best hit can cluster a paralog cluster with a singleton
gene or another paralog cluster. For example, if genes A + B are paralogs in
genome X and genes C +D are paralogs in genome Y. If gene A’s best hit
in genome Y is C but C’s best hit in X is B these four genes will end up in
an ortholog cluster together despite not having an individual reciprocal best
hit. For Strepneumo, this pipeline is implemented in an instance of Ergatis
(Orvis et al., 2010) and results are loaded into a relational database that
supports Sybil.

2.2 Data types

In addition to comparative computes, Sybil supports a number of additional
data types that can be visualized and used as search criteria. These data types
fall into two major categories: genome data and protein/ gene data. Genome
data is the result of a search or analysis that ﬁnds features located on the
raw genome sequence and therefore has genome coordinates. In the case
of Strepneumo, a simple repeat library was used along with Repeatmasker
(Smit et al., 1996) to predict simple repeats, Phobos (Mayer, 2006—2011)
was used to identify tandem repeats, HMMER (Eddy, 1998) was used to
identify several genomic repeats particular to S.pneumoniae and genomic
islands were identiﬁed using IslandPath (Hsiao et al., 2003). Protein/gene—
based data are associated or located on genes and are the result of an analysis

that operates on protein or nucleotide gene sequences. In this case, the
analysis can yield either a feature with gene coordinates or it can predict or
identify a particular property of the target gene. Strepneumo contains signal
peptides from SignalP (Bendtsen et al., 2004), B—cell epitope predictions
from BepiPred (Larsen et al., 2006), transmembrane regions from tmhmm
(Krogh et al., 2001) and subcellular localizations from psortb (Yu et al.,
2010). The psortb subcellular localizations exemplify an analysis that gives
a gene a particular property but does not predict features with coordinates.
The EMBOSS tool antigenic (Kolaskar and Tongaonkar, 1990) was used to
predict antigenic regions. In addition, several protein motifs were predicted
using hmmpfam (Eddy, 1998) including LPxTG Gram—positive cell wall
anchors, as well as bacteriocin and ﬁbronectin binding sites. Any data type
with either genomic or gene coordinates can be used in the system. New
data types must be loaded into the underlying database and conﬁgured in the
Sybil site conﬁguration ﬁle. A complete list of the data types provided in the
Strepneumo Sybil site is found in Table 1 with more details in Supplementary
Table $1.

2.3 Data storage

All data are stored in a Chado (Mungall and Emmert, 2007) relational
database using PostgreSQL. The results of the protein and genomic feature
searches are localized to the relevant protein and genome sequences,
respectively. Clusters are stored as ‘match’ features with member proteins
linking to this central match. The Chado schema is designed with a high
degree of abstraction and normalization resulting in reduced performance
with very large datasets. To address this, a data mart was developed called
ChadoMart. This mart consists of three tables: cm_proteins, cm_clusters
and cm_cluster_members. The cm_proteins table contains de—normalized
information about each protein while the cm_clusters table includes summary
statistics on all protein clusters. The cm_cluster_members table links the
cm_clusters table with the cm_proteins table, mapping all the proteins to
their respective clusters and vice versa. These three tables contain the data
most frequently queried by Sybil. Therefore, using ChadoMart signiﬁcantly
improves the website performance. In addition to the ChadoMart, server—side
query caching was implemented to further improve performance. For overlap

or ranged queries an interval tree is used. Using an interval tree was found
to be much faster than doing large table joins in the relational database.

The dataset can be quite large with the all vs. all BLAST results
constituting a majority of the data. In the most recent version of the
Strepneumo data, the BLAST results accounted for ~10.5 million of the
11 million rows in the central ‘feature’ table. Therefore, for distribution of
the data for local use, the BLAST results can be left out of the database,
allowing more modest hardware to run the system successfully.

2.4 Visualization/user interface

The Sybil website is composed of a combination of traditional standard—
based HTML/CSS and J avaScript along with elements from the J avaScript
framework ExtJS. HTML/CSS and JavaScript follow the HTML 4.01
standard and the implementation of the site is designed to work in most
modern web browsers. The use of asynchronous J avaScript server requests
(AJAX) gives Sybil the feel of an application rather than a website.
Complementing the traditional HTML/CSS/JavaScript is the use of ExtJ S, a
J avaScript library that speeds development of feature—rich web applications.
ExtJS is used exclusively on the Protein/Cluster Search Pages and the
Genomic Comparative View. The ExtJS grid on the search pages provides
useful functionality like sorting, column reordering and pagination. ExtJ S
windows are used as informational popups when rendered features are
clicked and ExtJ S ToolTips are used to display help information when a
user mouses over a box with a question mark (?) as shown in Figure 1.

Visualization is central to the Sybil system and is accomplished using
two different methods. The ﬁrst leverages the BioPerl (Stajich et al.,
2002) BiozzGraphics Perl package. An additional Sybil—speciﬁc glyph
allows visualization of the cluster relationships across genomes (Fig. 2).
BiozzGraphics is used for the Genomic Comparative View, Cluster Report
and Protein Report pages. In general, this package is good at displaying
comparative data for up to ~ 100 kb of bacterial sequence. The second method
is a custom module called Sybil::GraphicszzGenomeImage developed as part
of the new implementation of Sybil. Genomelmage currently leverages SVG
natively. This package is used for drawing whole—genome scale images such
as the Gradient View (Fig. 3) and the Whole—Genome Display (Fig. 4).
Genomelmage allows for the drawing of large amounts of data with less
detail than BiozzGraphics while still retaining an interactive image map for
web display.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Data mining and visualization

A number of interactive visualization and querying tools were
developed to aid interactive analysis of the S.pneumoniae data.
Effort was primarily focused on providing tools that are responsive
and informative for comparisons of many genomes using a web
browser. Particular attention was paid to supporting navigation
between the various Sybil views. Providing this capability gives
Sybil the feel of a fully integrated application rather than a set of
independent web pages.

3.1.] Search Sybil provides extensive search capability, and the
results are interactive and exportable. Gene queries can be initiated
using locus identiﬁers, database accessions, gene names and protein
functions. Results can be ﬁltered by taxonomy, length, subcellular
location, protein motifs, overlap with genomic features, membership
in orthologous clusters and BLAST matches. The orthologous gene
clusters are also searchable based on the same criteria as gene
searches with the addition of taxonomic proﬁle and cluster size.
The search results are displayed in a paginated table in the web
interface as shown in Figure l. The data can be sorted by any column,

Fig. 2. The Genomic Comparative View provides the ability to visually
compare genomic regions. Genes in each region of each genome are drawn
with arrowheads indicating their orientation. Genes that share a common
cluster are connected via a shaded polygon. Additional genome/protein
feature types are drawn as different shapes in different colors in their
respective positions. This particular image shows the deletion of several
genes in the top genome.

and links are provided to gene and cluster report pages. Results are
also downloadable as a tab—delimited text ﬁle or FASTA ﬁle for
downstream analysis.

3.1.2 Cluster report page/genomic comparative display
Visualizing genomic comparisons is central to Sybil’s power.
Both the cluster report page and the genomic comparative page
allow the user to view genes and other genomic features drawn
in a logical linear fashion (Fig. 2). Gene cluster relationships are

easily visible providing clear illustration of insertions, deletions,
rearrangements and annotation/sequencing anomalies. On the
cluster report page, the cluster of interest is drawn in the center
with pink shading. The genomic comparative display supports two
drawing modes: search mode and edit mode. Search mode allows
the user to specify a reference region and search query genomes
for similar regions. Edit mode allows the user to manually deﬁne
all viewable regions and can also be used to perfect a view to
create publication ready ﬁgures. Clicking on genes, gene clusters
or any protein or genomic feature will generate a popup with data
pertinent to the clicked feature and links to other views/pages. This
allows Sybil displays to forego displaying labels for all features,
decluttering complex images. Clicking on a gene or gene cluster
will provide several pieces of data and additionally provide a link
to center on this gene or cluster in the Genomic Comparative View.
Several links are provided allowing the user to center on the gene
or cluster in the Genomic Comparative View with a variety of base
pair pads and search other genomes in the dataset for homologous
regions. These links give the user the power to explore regions of
interest more fully without leaving the system. Multi—FASTA ﬁles
of protein or nucleotide sequences can be exported for external
analyses and publication quality ﬁgures can be exported in SVG or
PDF format using buttons along the bottom of the page.

3.1.3 Whole genome display/synteny gradient display The
synteny gradient display enables the visualization of changes in
synteny relative to a reference (Fig. 3). In this view, a reference
genome’s genes are colored from yellow to blue on a gradient from
left to right. If a query genome shares a cluster with a reference gene,
then it is drawn above the matching reference gene but using a color
that corresponds to the query gene’s position in its native genome.
The resulting ﬁgure reveals conservation of the color gradient in

Fig. 3. The synteny gradient display is a unique representation of conserved gene content/order between several genomes that can be used to identify
rearrangements as well as large—scale insertions/deletions. The view is based on a reference sequence (in this case S.pneumoniae TIGR4) that is drawn in the
bottom panel. Genes in the reference genome are colored yellow to blue from left to right. White in the reference denotes a region with no gene annotation.
Matching genes in each of the 33 query sequences are drawn atop their reference match, i.e. not in the order in which they appear in their respective genomes.
To highlight rearrangements and conserved synteny, the matching genes are colored based on the relative position in their respective genomes (yellow for the
beginning and blue for the end). Genes shown in black are part of a paralogous cluster in their respective genome and therefore do not have a single native
location. GC—skew, %GC and atypical nucleotide composition are plotted for the reference genome.

Fig. 4. This whole genome display illustrates Sybil’s data type ﬂexibility. In this ﬁgure, all the genes from an entire S.pneumoniae genome are drawn at the
top. Below the gene track are several additional annotations listed in Table 1. Any feature that has a genomic or gene coordinate can be drawn. For signal
peptides and trans—membrane regions, the density of features is drawn. Lastly, % GC, GC—skew and atypical nucleotide composition plots are drawn.

show up as color mismatches between the reference and query
genomes. Gaps in query genomes represent genes that are present in
the reference but not the query. Query genes with paralogs will show
up as either colorless or black depending on the user’s preference.
Multiple drawings can be made at once with each genome serving
as the reference if the user chooses. Additionally, the genes in the

reference are clickable. This generates a popup with information
about the gene, its clusters and links to other Sybil views or pages.
Images can be exported as high-quality SVG or PDF ﬁles for
publication or other uses.

As the name implies, the whole genome display provides
visualization of an entire genome or chromosome (Fig. 4). This

display draws an entire genome in a linear and compact fashion
with genes drawn as vertical bars. The bars are clickable and more
information is provided in popups including links to the genomic
comparative display, and cluster and protein report pages. The power
of this display is the ability to draw additional genomic data types
and graphs of feature densities. This view also allows ﬁltering the
displayed genes by gene function keyword. Like the synteny display,
images are exportable as SVG or PDF.

3.2 Strepneumo Sybil

The Sybil system has been leveraged to explore the genomes of the
human pathogen S.pneumoniae. Currently, the Strepneumo public
website houses 34 streptococcal genomes (33 S.pneumoniae and
1 close relative, S.mitis) comprising 76539 genes with a total of
3407 ortholog clusters. In addition to the cluster data, several other
data types are present, including genome features (e. g. genomic
islands, repeats) and protein features (trans—membrane spans, cell
wall anchors) (Table 1). These data types can be used to search for
genes and gene clusters and can also be visualized in all the Sybil
v1ews.

3.2. 1 Potential vaccine candidates Many of the data types used in
Strepneumo were inspired by the need to identify potential vaccine
candidate genes for the purpose of reverse vaccinology (Sette and
Rappuoli, 2010). These features and properties have been used in
combination to ﬁnd genes that are exposed on the cell surface and
could therefore be accessible to the immune system. Antigenicity
and epitope prediction are also used to identify protein regions that
have the greatest chance of interacting with the immune system. The
goal is to improve reverse vaccinology by reducing the number of
predicted vaccine candidates such that downstream experimental
conﬁrmation is less burdensome. No single analysis is a good
predictor for whether a gene will make a good vaccine candidate.
However, combining a variety of properties and visualizing them
across the different strains can identify a reduced set of likely
candidate genes.

3.2.2 Strepneumo-Sybil virtual machine While Strepneumo is
freely available to everyone with access to an Internet connection,
some situations like travel or unreliable Internet connections may
necessitate a local copy of the tool. The Sybil package requires
considerable expertise to install, therefore distribution of mirrors
and local copies of the Strepneumo Sybil system was accomplished
via virtual machines (VM). The Strepneumo VM leverages the
CloVR (Angiuoli et al., 2011b) architecture, contains an install
of Ubuntu Linux and comes pre—loaded with all the dependencies
required for running Sybil and the Strepneumo website. The virtual
machine is ~1.7 GB in size when compressed and is available
for download from the Strepneumo website. Any computer that
can run the 64—bit VMWare player, has at least 15 GB of disk
space and 2GB of RAM can run the Strepneumo Sybil website
locally.

3.3 Sybil screencasts

One often—overlooked aspect of Bioinformatics software
development is documentation and training. For Sybil it was
decided that documentation would be part of the tool. To
accomplish this goal, descriptions of the various panels and their

use are available by hovering the cursor over the “2’ boxes at the top
of each panel. In the case of complex features like the protein/cluster
search page, cluster and protein reports, and Genomic Comparative
View, video screencasts were recorded and uploaded to YouTube
(www.youtube.com/SybilScreencasts). Each screencast is ~10 min
in length and describes each of the basic features of the tool.
The screencasts are narrated and the watcher observes the tool in
use. These screencasts can be accessed by going directly to the
SybilScreencasts YouTube page or by hovering over the “2’ icon in
one of the tools where a screencast is available.

4 DISCUSSION
4.1 Sybil VM

In order to provide a system that is portable, deployable and scalable,
the Strepneumo Sybil web site was deployed using the CloVR virtual
machine. The VM proved to be invaluable in setting up the system
in two remote sites: the International Crops Research Institute for
the Semi—Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in India and the International
Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Kenya. These two sites
provided mirrors of the Strepneumo Sybil instance by running a
VM based on the CloVR project. These installations did not require
travel and were frequently updated in a matter of a few days with
minimal effort.

The computes that form the basis of the Sybil Strepneumo system
are complex, long running and require signiﬁcant computational
resources. For example, the computes for Strepneumo data version
15 required ~136 CPU hours. Planned integration of these compute
pipelines into the CloVR VM will allow users with limited resources
to set up Sybil websites with their own data by allowing them to run
their computes in a cloud environment with minimal expertise.

4.2 Genomic data

The Sybil system is designed to work with genomic data from
any type of organism. In addition to numerous instances involving
bacterial genomes, including the public Strepneumo site described
here, the system has been employed for the eukaryotic Aspergillas
database AspDB at www.aspgd.org (Arnaud et al., 2010) to provide
comparative genomics capabilities. Internally, the system has been
used to compare several protozoan parasites. These capabilities can
be as easily leveraged for archaea, other eukaryotes, or viruses.
Whole genome shotgun second— and third—generation sequencing
approaches result in large numbers of draft or unﬁnished genome
sequences being used as the ﬁnal product. Sybil accepts unﬁnished
genome data, but it does not attempt to connect together any separate
contigs. This can cause issues when looking for regions of synteny
as in the gradient display and the genomic comparative display.
Currently, this can be addressed by building pseudomolecules, where
contigs are ordered and oriented based on a reference genome
and made into a single FASTA entry representing one prediction
of the genome. However, this can incorrectly be perceived as
the true order of the genome when the information is actually
lacking. One way to address this issue is incorporation of whole
genome alignment data. Generation of gene clusters based on data
from the whole genome aligner Mugsy (Angiuoli and Salzberg,
2011) has already been accomplished and extension of this work
to dynamically order previously unordered contigs will give Sybil

the power to better visualize draft genome data (Angiuoli et al.,
2011a).

4.3 Optimizations and scalability

As datasets grow, the Sybil system will need to implement
more aggressive optimizations to maintain acceptable performance.
The Strepneumo Sybil system contains 11 million rows in the
feature table with 22 million feature locations and 43 million
feature properties. The normalized structure of the Chado database
can require numerous table joins, making some queries slow.
Optimizations like the ChadoMart and query caching have allowed
the system to scale to near 50 bacterial genomes, but other strategies
are needed for larger data. A prototype NoSQL document—based
database was benchmarked using MongoDB. This method of data
storage does away with the relational schema and opts for a schema—
less data model where every gene is a conceptual ‘document’. Using
MongoDB as a primary data store allowed the system to scale to
>100 ~5—6 MB bacterial genomes. The bottleneck at this level
becomes the visualization strategies used since graphic drawing in
Sybil is done on demand. Future iterations of the system will likely
require a refactored drawing strategy to provide the ﬂexibility and
interactivity that has become standard in the current Sybil system.

5 CONCLUSION

As is typical in bioinformatics, the biological problem deﬁnes the
needed software. Development of Sybil has been focused on manual
data mining efforts, which give the user the power to navigate
countable numbers of genomes in search of potentially important
biological features. As datasets become larger and less manageable,
the comparative genomics tools of the future will need to adapt
to provide meaningful information without overwhelming the user.
Sybil has addressed this problem by transitioning from a system
capable of drawing a handful of genomes to one that is able to
handle >100 genomes.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Small nucleolar RNAs are an abundant class of non-
coding RNAs that guide chemical modifications of rRNAs, snRNAs
and some mRNAs. In the case of many ‘orphan’ snoRNAs, the
targeted nucleotides remain unknown, however. The box H/ACA
subclass determines uridine residues that are to be converted
into pseudouridines via specific complementary binding in a well-
defined secondary structure configuration that is outside the scope
of common RNA (co-)folding algorithms.

Results: RNAsnoop implements a dynamic programming algorithm
that computes thermodynamically optimal H/ACA-RNA interactions
in an efficient scanning variant. Complemented by an support vector
machine (SVM)-based machine learning approach to distinguish true
binding sites from spurious solutions and a system to evaluate
comparative information, it presents an efficient and reliable tool for
the prediction of H/ACA snoRNA target sites. We apply RNAsnoop
to identify the snoRNAs that are responsible for several of the
remaining ‘orphan’ pseudouridine modifications in human rRNAs,
and we assign a target to one of the five orphan H/ACA snoRNAs in
Drosophila.

1 INTRODUCTION

Box H/ACA snoRNA facilitates the conversion of Uracil to
pseudouracil (‘11) in a speciﬁc sequence context (Bachellerie
et al., 2002). The speciﬁcity for a particular target site is the
consequence of the hybridization of snoRNA and target RNA,
in most cases a ribosomal RNA. The target U is positioned by
two speciﬁc interactions of the ﬂanking target RNA sequence
with the complementary sequence of the recognition loop of the
snoRNA (Ni et al., 1997), see Figure l. The ‘correct’ secondary

structures of snoRNAs are typically hard to predict. Thus, the
exact structure of the interior loop, and hence the sequence motifs
complementary to the binding site, are unknown. We employ here
the idea of Thermodynamic Matchers (Hechsmann et al., 2006)
to determine the energetically optimal structure of an H/ACA
snoRNA that is bound to a given putative target sequence. The
implementation of Thermodynamic Matchers (Reeder et al., 2007)
is not directly applicable, however, since the snoRNA—target
interaction corresponds to a complex pseudoknot (in the conceptual
concatenation of snoRNA and mRNA) that is beyond the scope of
existing RNA folding software.

The prediction of putative snoRNA target sites is an integral
part of two programs [snoGPS (Schattner et al., 2004) and
Fisher (Freyhult et al., 2008)] that attempt to detect H/ACA
snoRNAs in genomic DNA. Both programs search for sequence
complementarities between a list of possible target sites and
the binding region of the snoRNA candidate. In these models,
mismatches between the target and the snoRNA are not allowed.
Furthermore, neither program provides information on the energetics
of the interaction or the stability of the stems, two factors that
were recently shown to be important for correctly predicting
snoRNA—target interactions (Xiao et al., 2009).

We present here a dynamic programming algorithm named
RNAsno op, that speciﬁcally captures the structure of the snoRNA—
target interaction and is optimized for scanning speed. The
thermodynamic considerations are combined with a machine
learning component to increase the speciﬁcity of target predictions,
which can be improved even further by including comparative
information.

2 SINGLE-SEQUENCE RNASNOOP
2.1 Specialized folding algorithm

RNAsnoop implements a specialized co—folding algorithm that
takes into account that stringent structural constraints must be
satisﬁed for a functional interaction of a box H/ACA snoRNA
stem—loop and its target. As input, RNAsnoop takes one of the
typical two stem—loop components of a known or predicted H/ACA
snoRNA. The closing stem, T is assumed to be known from the a
priori prediction of the snoRNA structure. The part of the snoRNA
sequence enclosed by T is allowed to interact with the target
structure. Figure 1 outlines the general principle.

Fig. 1. Box H/ACA snoRNAs typically interact with both stem—loop
structures with regions of a target RNA ﬂanking the Uracil residue that is to
be pseudouridylated. Computation of the interaction structure is performed
separately for the two stems—loop components of a H/ACA snoRNA. The
closing stem T at the root of each branch is assumed to be given from
the structure prediction. The region inside of T is decomposed into the
upper stem—loop structure with an energy contribution M, left and right
interaction structures with their energy contribution L and R, respectively.
Since RNAsnoop scans the target RNA in 5/—3/ direction, the snoRNA is
read in 3/—5/ direction.

The interaction structure can be decomposed into the unbranched
stem—loop ‘above’ the pseudouridylation site, and the left and right
‘arms’ of the binding site itself. The total energy of these components
will be optimized by dynamic programming. In addition, the
snoRNA—target interaction is inﬂuenced by the short closing stem
of the interaction loop.

The upper stem—loop structure of the snoRNA (with sequence y)
is simply modeled as an unbranched fold. The energies of its optimal
substructures satisfy the recursion

where 7-i(y[p,q]) denotes the energy parameters (Lu et al.,
2006; Mathews et al., 1999) for a hairpin loop formed by
the subsequence y[p,q]=ypyp+1...yq including the closing pair
(yp,yq). Analogously, I(y[u,p],y[q,v]) is the energy of an interior
loop composed of the sequences y[u,p] and y[q,v], again including
the delimiting base pairs (yp,yq) and (ymyv).

Inspection of known snoRNA—rRNA interactions revealed that
the interaction region can contain only single and tandem
mismatches but no bulges. Therefore, we allow only stacked base
pairs and symmetrical loops of lengths 2 and 4. Thus, the left part
satisﬁes the recursion

Li,j=ki1}ﬂ213Li—k,j+k+I(x[i—k,i],)’[iaj+kI)- (2)
The index i runs along the target RNA x, while j refers to the position
on the snoRNA y. To ensure that all interactions start inside the
recursion matrix we set Lid- :0

The r.h.s. array R contains the optimal folding energies of the
interaction structure up to positions i on the target and j on the
snoRNA consisting of the l.h.s. binding region L, the snoRNA stem—
loop M and the partial r.h.s. binding region Riki. It thus extends
a r.h.s. binding region or refers to its ﬁrst base pair. In the latter

case, nucleotide xi_2 is the uracil that is pseudouridylated. The
corresponding recursion reads

min Ri_k,j+l -l-I(x[i—k, i],y[i,j—I—l])

k,l§2

Ri '=min min Li—3 '+l+1+M'+1 '+1 (3)
‘1 le{3,lyI—j] "1 “I "I

if x[i—2] = ’U’.
For each i, the best binding energy at target position i is maxj Riki.

Space and time requirements for the M —matrix are limited by the
size |y| of the snoRNA stem—loop structure, which is a user—speciﬁed
constant, typically 120 nt. Formally, the space and time complexity
is O(|y|2) and O(|y|4), respectively. The space requirements for the
L and R arrays are limited to 5 X |y| independent of the target |x| of
the target RNA. This is possible because the length of interior loops
in the recursions is restricted to not more than 4 and the transition
from L to R recursion only looks back to i— 4. The time complexity
for L is O(|x| - lyl), while for R we need O(|x| - lylz) operations. The
total run time is thus O(|x| |y|2 —l— lyl4), i.e. we have a linear ‘scanning
algorithm’ for long target RNAs.

Due to the difference in accessibility between sites with
pseudouridine and uridine residues in both human and yeast (see
Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 81), we extended RNAsnoop so
that accessibility information are considered in the folding step.
Accessibility proﬁles as computed by RNAup (Muckstein et al.,
2006) or RNApl f old (Bernhart et al., 2006; Bompfiinewerer et al.,
2008) describe the energy necessary to open the secondary structure
on an interval of the target sequence. The full implementation of
RNA—RNA interactions is too expensive in terms of computational
resources for a target search program. We therefore borrow the
approach from RNApleX (Tafer and Hofacker, 2008a), which
uses an afﬁne approximation to speed up the computation of
RNA—RNA interaction energies. A recent extension (Tafer and
Hofacker, 2008b) shows that the accuracy can be improved
substantially by incorporating precomputed accessibility proﬁles in
the parameterization of the interaction energies. Here, we use the
same idea to approximate the inﬂuence of the target site accessibility
on the snoRNA—rRNA interactions, while preserving the linear run
time of RNAsnoop.

2.2 Machine learning component

Xiao et al. (2009) showed that the interaction energy is necessary
but not sufﬁcient to distinguish functional from non—functional
snoRNA—rRNA interactions. Stability of the stems enclosing the
pseudourydilation pocket as well as structural features relative to
the stems and the interaction regions are equally relevant. In order
to take those parameters into account we used a machine learning
method [support vector machine (SVM)] to analyze the output of
RNAsnoop. We developed two models depending on whether or
not RNAsnoop considers the target site accessibility. We used the
experimentally veriﬁed interactions from yeast (Schattner et al.,
2004) and human (Xiao et al., 2009). When using the human
interactions for testing we trained exclusively on the yeast dataset.
Since the training dataset did not contain experimentally conﬁrmed
non—functional interactions, we augmented it by adding artiﬁcial
ones. For each snoRNA—stem involved in a veriﬁed interaction,
we let RNAsnoop run against yeast 28S and 188 sequence. All

experimentally validated interaction and that do not target a known

2.3.2 Run time We compared the run time of RNAsnoop with
that of snoGPS and RNAhybrid. We modiﬁed fisher to turn it

into a target ﬁnder; the resulting run time, however, was so high that
we decided not to evaluate it further. RNAhybrid uses a dynamic
programming algorithm to ﬁnd putative miRNA—targets and has a
run time of O(|x|- lyl). Since the run time of RNAsnoop is linear
in the target size but quadratic in the snoRNA size, we varied the
length of both sequences. Since H/ACA snoRNA stems vary greatly
in length (B ally et al., 1988; Torchet et al., 2005), we incremented the
snoRNA stem size in steps of 30 nt from 60 up to 420 nt, keeping the
target RNA length ﬁxed to 5000 nt. Conversely, the target length was
varied between 1000 and 256 000 nt with a snoRNA stem length set
to 200. We set the threshold for each program so that they returned
at most one hit. Independently of the snoRNA or target sequence
size, snoGPS and RNAsnoop have a similar run time. They are
around 15 times faster than RNAhybrid (Supplementary Figs S2
and S3).

3 A COMPARATIVE VERSION

The use of alignments in the target search can further help to ﬁnd real
snoRNA—RNA interactions. On one hand, the absence of conserved
target site in closely related species may indicate that the proposed
interaction does not occur in nature. The presence of compensatory
mutations between the snoRNA binding bucket and the target site,
on the other hand, can lend further credibility to single—sequence
target predictions (Chen et al., 2007).

The alignment extension of RNAsnoop is based on the same
approach used in RNAalif old (Bernhart et al., 2008; Hofacker
et al., 2002), where a thermodynamic energy minimization folding
algorithm is coupled with a simple scoring model to assess
evolutionary conservation. As in the single sequence algorithm,
the upper stem is modeled as an unbranched fold by a slightly
modiﬁed RNAalifold algorithm. The interaction part uses the
same approach as RNAal i f old, with the sole difference that only
interior loops are allowed between the snoRNA and its target.

For an efﬁcient analysis of data, we provide and recommend the
perl script SNOOPY. It uses both the SVM as well as the homology
information to predict putative target interactions. SNOOPY takes as
input a snoRNA alignment and a target alignment. In a ﬁrst step
SNOOPY uses mLocARNA to obtain sequence/structure alignments
of the snoRNAs (Will et al., 2007). If the sum of scores of
mLocARNA pairwise alignments for a sequence is <2500, then
the sequence is discarded. Duplicates and sequences belonging
to species that are present in only one of the two alignments
are also removed. SNOOPY preselects possible targets in a user—
deﬁned reference organism by means of the single—sequence version
of RNAsnoop and one of the two SVM models. For each
reported targets, SNOOPY extracts the corresponding slice from
the alignments and then realigns the corresponding subsequences
with Clustalw (Thompson et al., 1994). Target sequences for
which the pairwise alignment score is below a threshold, or which
do not exhibit a U residue at the previously predicted site, are
removed together with the snoRNA sequences from the same
organisms. Whenever the number of retained sequences is above
a user—deﬁned threshold, the alignment version of RNAsnoop is
applied. Finally, SNOOPY reports for each snoRNA alignment a
user—speciﬁed number of putative interactions. These interactions
can be ranked either by their SVM score or by the single sequence
interaction energy for the reference organism.

4 APPLICATIONS

In order to test the usability of RNAsnoop, we consider
the problems of ﬁnding snoRNAs associated with ‘orphan’
pseudouridylation sites in human rRNAs. Although the role of
snoRNAs in locating target uridine residues was discovered more
than a decade ago, there are still a few pseudouridylation sites
in human rRNAs (Maden and Wakeman, 1988; Ofengand and
Bakin, 1997) for which the responsible snoRNAs have not yet been
determined. We used the single sequence version of RNAsnoop to
predict the possible snoRNAs that may pseudouridylate these orphan
sites. For this we used all the known human H/ACA sequences
reported in snoRNA— LBME—db (Lestrade and Weber, 2006) and
tested them against the 11 reported orphan sites in the human LSU
and SSU. Based on the currently available snoRNA data, eight
orphan sites can be mapped to existing snoRNA stems. Interestingly,
two orphan snoRNAs (ACA3 8B, ACA5 1), and two stems, for which
no function was reported, were among the predictions. Additionally,
four stems with known targets were predicted to target four of the
orphan sites. The predicted interactions are listed in Table 3, Figure 4
and Supplementary Figure S4.

We used SNOOPY to assign putative targets to the ﬁve orphan
snoRNAs found in Drosophila (Or—acal, Or—aca2, Or—aca3, Or—aca4
and Or—aca5). For each orphan snoRNAs reported in Flybase
(Ashburner and Drysdale, 1994), we searched for homologous
sequences in the 11 other Drosophila species by using blast
(Altschul et al., 1990). For each species, the sequence with the
highest homology with D.melan0gaster was selected. The sequences
were then aligned with mLocARNA, a variant of the Sankoff
algorithm. For each snoRNA, the full—length alignment was then
divided into a 5’ and 3’ stem alignments.

The rRNA alignments were retrieved from the arb—silva
database (Pruesse et al., 2007). In order to get the best possible
alignments, we realigned them with Clustalw, Muscle (Edgar,
2004), and RNAsalsa (Stocsits et al., 2009). The quality of the
alignments was assessed by determining how well the conserved
pseudouridylation sites in D.melan0gaster and Homo sapiens were
aligned in the 12 drosophilid rRNA sequences. Based on this quality
measure, RNAsalsa was found to perform best (Supplementary
Tables T1 and T2). Alignments of snRNAs were taken from Marz
et al. (2008).

Of the ﬁve orphan snoRNAs, only Oaca—4 was reported to have
a target. We predict that the ﬁrst stem modiﬁes U2499 on the
28S rRNA (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 85). This target site is
interesting since it was reported to be pseudouridylated (Giordano
et al., 1999), but no corresponding snoRNA is known. Moreover, in
human and yeast, this position which correspond to U3674 in human
and U2191 in yeast, is conserved and pseudouridylated (Lestrade
and Weber, 2006). U3674, ﬁnally, remains an orphan site in human.

Interestingly, both the target and binding buckets are completely
conserved from D.melan0gaster to D.willist0ni, see Figure 5. On
the other hand, 6 out of the 12 bp found in the upper stem exhibit
compensatory mutations.

The fact that no credible targets have been predicted for the
remaining four orphan snoRNAs is not unexpected. First, snoRNAs
have also been implicated in modifying ‘non—canonical targets’ such
as mRNAs (Bazeley et al., 2008; Kishore and Stamm, 2006; Uliel
et al., 2004), some cause cleavage of pre—rRNAs (Fayet—Lebaron
et al., 2009), and Taft et al. (2009) recently showed that Or—aca5 is

5 DISCUSSION

We presented here RNAsnoop, a tool speciﬁcally designed
to predict complex H/ACA snoRNA—RNA interactions that are
outside the scope of conventional RNA—RNA prediction tools.
In contrast with previous tools, it uses a dynamic programming
approach coupled with a nearest—neighbor energy model to identify
putative targets. This allows RNAsnoop to capture structural and

energetic features essential for correctly predicting snoRNA—target
interactions (Xiao et al., 2009). Coupled with a SVM classiﬁcation,
SNOOPY achieves good performance ranking ﬁrst 11 out of 12
conﬁrmed snoRNA—mRNA interactions in human and excluding
all experimentally rejected interactions. These good results should,
however, not be overestimated as both the training and test datasets
are small and were extracted from only two species.

The run time of RNAsnoop is comparable with that of snoGPS,
and scales linearly with the length of the target sequence. Together
with the improved accuracy, this makes RNAsnoop not only
suitable for target search in rRNA and snRNA sequences or
in speciﬁc putative mRNA candidates, but also for large—scale
genome—wide surveys.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The human uridine diphosphate—glucuronosyltransfer-
ase enzyme family catalyzes the glucuronidation of the glycosyl
group of a nucleotide sugar to an acceptor compound (substrate),
which is the most common conjugation pathway that serves to protect
the organism from the potential toxicity of xenobiotics. Moreover, it
could affect the pharmacological profile of a drug. Therefore, it is
important to identify the metabolically labile sites for glucuronidation.
Results: In the present study, we developed four in silico models to
predict sites of glucuronidation, for four major sites of metabolism
functional groups, i.e. aliphatic hydroxyl, aromatic hydroxyl, carboxylic
acid or amino nitrogen, respectively. According to the mechanism of
glucuronidation, a series of ‘local’ and ‘global’ molecular descriptors
characterizing the atomic reactivity, bonding strength and physical—
chemical properties were calculated and selected with a genetic
algorithm-based feature selection approach. The constructed support
vector machine classification models show good prediction perform-
ance, with the balanced accuracy ranging from 0.88 to 0.96 on test
set. For further validation, our models can successfully identify 84% of
experimentally observed sites of metabolisms for an external test set
containing 54 molecules.

1 INTRODUCTION

Human uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferases
(UGTs) are major phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes that cata-
lyze transfer of glucuronic acid from UDP—glucuronic acid to
various substrates containing nucleophilic functional group,
e.g. alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, amines, thiols and so
forth. Up until now, 22 human UGT proteins have been identi-
ﬁed, and they can be classiﬁed in four families: UGTl, UGT2,
UGT3 and UGT8 (Rowland et al., 2013). These isoforms are

widely distributed and can be found in liver, intestine, kidney,
lung and skin. Both endogenous (e. g. bilirubin) and xenobiotic
(e.g. drug) chemicals can be metabolized by this family of
enzymes, yielding water-soluble products that are easier to be
excreted (Miners and Mackenzie, 1991). Most of those isoforms
possess the overlapping substrate speciﬁcities as well as the cap-
acity to metabolize a variety of structure unrelated substances.
For example, UGT1A3 can catalyze glucuronidation of phenols,
carboxylic acids and amines (Magdalou et al., 2010).

In addition to an essential detoxiﬁcation mechanism for struc-
turally diverse drugs, the glucuronidation can also lead to short
duration of action and the loss of pharmacological activity of the
drugs. In such cases, medicinal chemist needs to optimize the
lead compound to improve its pharmacokinetic properties. For
example, to reduce potential for glucuronidation, Tanaka et al.
(2007) designed metabolically more stable compounds by incor-
porating substituents at the ortho position of the phenolic
hydroxyl group or exchanging the phenyl group. In addition,
strategy like bioisosteric modiﬁcations of phenol moiety was
also reported to overcome the issue of rapid glucuronidation
(Kawada et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2005). In contrast, the property
that glucuronidation may lead to a minimized systemic exposure
can be used to reduce adverse events. For example, Millan et al.
(2011) designed inhaled p38 inhibitors by introducing functional
groups prone to be metabolized via cytochromes P450 (CYPs) or
UGTs, to achieve high intrinsic clearance. Therefore, glucuroni-
dation provides access to modifying the pharmacokinetic proﬁle
during lead optimization. It is necessary to identify whether a
compound can be glucuronidated, as well as which functional
group of the compound is able to undergo the reaction.

Normally the UGT-catalyzed biotransformation is determined
experimentally by metabolite identiﬁcation techniques. However,
given that such experimental techniques are cost-intensive and
time-consuming, there is growing interest to develop reliable in
silico models to predict and deepen our understanding of the
reaction. Till now, only the crystal structure of C—terminal
domain of human UGT2B7 was determined (Miley et al.,
2007). Accordingly, current computational models for UGT-
mediated reaction were based on the reported substrate proﬁle.
Early studies (Ethell et al., 2002; Temellini et al., 1991;
Vashishtha et al., 2001) mainly focused on analyzing kinetic
constants for the glucuronidation of homologous series of
substrates, suggesting that glucuronidation rate was related to

molecular lipophilic, electronic and/or steric properties. Miners,
Smith and Sorich extensively studied substrates and non-
substrates of UGT isoforms (‘reaction phenotyping’) (Miners
et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2003a, b; Sorich et al., 2003,
2004a, b). By trying various machine learning methods, classiﬁ-
cation models for discriminating substrates of different UGT
isoforms were developed. They also applied the strategy of
pharmacophore ﬁngerprint analysis to mine the structure
signature related to glucuronidation, and found that local envir-
onment of nucleophilic site played an important role in identify-
ing potential sites of metabolism (SOMs) (Smith et al., 2003b;
Sorich et al., 2004b). Though many computational studies have
been reported to simulate reaction rate and phenotyping, models
predicting sites of glucuronidation were rare. Sorich et al. (2006)
reported na'1've Bayes models trained for eight UGT isoforms
using three quantum chemical (QC) and constitutional descrip-
tors. Their results indicated that the local environment of nucleo-
philic site is an important feature to characterize the SOM of
glucuronidation, and general chemical properties may be of sec-
ondary importance. However, this study was based on a small
dataset containing only dozens of glucuronidated sites, which
limited its application to structurally diverse compounds outside
the range of training data.

In the present study, we combined local QC descriptors and
global physical—chemical properties to build four classiﬁcation
models to predict sites of glucuronidation using the learning
method support vector machine (SVM) and a dataset covering
a large chemical diversity space. First, human UGT-catalyzed
reactions were retrieved from MDL Metabolite Database, and
potential sites of glucuronidation were marked by matching
predeﬁned SMARTS strings. Then, both QC and geometrical
descriptors were calculated to train SVM classiﬁers for each
type of sites, i.e. aliphatic hydroxyl, aromatic hydroxyl,
carboxylic and amino nitrogen. In the end, model performance
was assessed by 10-fold cross-validation (10-fold CW and test
set. For further validation, another 54 molecules were collected
and predicted using our constructed models.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

Altogether 1377 in vitro human UGT-catalyzed reactions were retrieved
from the MDL Metabolite Database. The following preparation proced-
ures were automatically performed with an in-house C++ program using
modules of OpenBabel 2.3.0 (O’Boyle et al., 2011).

(1) Extracting experimentally observed sites. The experimentally
observed SOMs were identiﬁed by applying a subgraph isomorph-
ism algorithm to each reactant—product pair. Empirically, the sub-
strate of a glucuronidation reaction is a subgraph of its product
when ignoring hydrogen atoms. Figure 1a showed the glucuroni-
dation of morphine as an example (Kilpatrick and Smith, 2005).
By examining the 2D structures of morphine and its corresponding
glucuronic acid conjugate, the SOM can be automatically deter-
mined at the OH group. Figure 1b and 0 presented two less
common glucuronidation examples that were not considered in
the current study.

(2) Assigning class labels for potential SOMs. The most common nu-
cleophilic sites of glucuronidation include (Miners and Mackenzie,
1991): aliphatic or aromatic hydroxyl oxygen, singly bonded

oxygen of carboxyl group, amino nitrogen, heterocyclic nitrogen,

ponding SMARTS strings that were used to match potential
SOMs. After removing the sites that appear too few times, we
ﬁnally kept the following four types of sites: (i) aliphatic hydroxylic
oxygen (AlOH), (ii) aromatic hydroxylic oxygen (ArOH), (iii) single
bonded oxygen of a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and (iv) aro-
matic/aliphatic amino nitrogen and heterocyclic nitrogen
(Nitrogen). Their SMARTS patterns and the number of reactants
containing the corresponding groups are listed in Table 2. Among
all the matched sites, those experimentally observed glucuronida-
tion sites identiﬁed in step (1) were labeled as +1 (positive), and the
others were labeled as —1 (negative).

Generating 3D structures and optimization. The initial 3D structure
of each reactant was constructed in Sybyl 6.8 (Sybyl, 2001) and
further geometrically optimized using the semi-empirical AMl
method in the MOPAC 7.0 program (Stewart, 1990).

To generate a representative test set for validation, the Kennard—Stone
algorithm (Kennard and Stone, 1969) was used to split each dataset into a
training and a test set in the ratio of 4: 1. Moreover, to further evaluate the
constructed models, an external test set containing 54 molecules was
compiled from recently published studies using in vitro experiments to
determine UGT-catalyzed SOMs. Each molecule contained at least one
glucuronidation site. The same procedure described earlier in the text was
applied to build and optimize 3D structures. The initial structures, their
SOMs and original references are provided in Supplementary Material S1
and S2.

2.2 Descriptors

The mechanism of glucuronidation involves nucleophilic attack of the
substrate on the cofactor (SN2 reaction, a diagram was shown in
Fig. 2) (Miners and Mackenzie, 1991). The descriptors capturing

information about the nature of nucleophilic atom (i.e. O, N) are sup-
posed to contribute to discriminating whether a potential site can be
glucuronidated. Previous studies (Cnubben et al., 1994; Sorich et al.,
2004a, 2006; Zheng et al., 2009) have shown that QC descriptors can
well represent the atomic and molecular reactivity. Here 25 types of
local QC features and 7 types of global QC features characterizing
bond strength or reactivity of an atom were calculated (deﬁnition are
available in Supplementary Material S3). Those one-center terms reﬂect
the electrostatic behavior or reactivity ability of an atom toward the co-
factor, whereas two-center terms are related to the bond strength between
the atom and its bonded neighbors. More detailed information about
these descriptors can be found elsewhere (Brown and Sirnas, 1982;
Karelson et al., 1996; Katritzky et al., 1995—1997).

To calculate these QC features, the following key words were included
in the input ﬁle of MOPAC program: AMl, MMOK, VECTORS,
BONDS, PI, PRECISE, ENPART, EF, MULLIK and CHARGE=n,
where n is the charge of the molecule studied. Then an in-house python
program was used to calculate both local and global QC features by
parsing the MOPAC output ﬁle. Because those two-center terms involve
two atoms, the following transformations were made to use them as
atomic descriptors. For the potential sites of AlOH, ArOH and COOH,
both features of the bond O-H and O-C were separately calculated and
used as atomic descriptors; for the sites of Nitrogen, all features of the
bond N—X (where X can be any neighbor atom) were computed, of which
the sum, max, min and mean values were used as atomic descriptors.

Besides, it has been shown that steric and lipophilic properties of the
substrates were also responsible for the rate of glucuronidation (Cupid
et al., 1999; Ethell et al., 2002; Kim, 1991; Mercier et al., 1991; Vashishtha
et al., 2001). In this study, 13 molecular descriptors addressing geomet-
rical and lipophilic properties were introduced (deﬁnitions are available in
Supplementary Material S3). Geometrical descriptors were calculated via
CODESSA 2.7.2 (CODESSA, 1995—2004), and logP (Wildman and
Crippen, 1999) is computed using OpenBabel.

Overall, there are 56 descriptors calculated for the sites AlOH, ArOH
and COOH, and 81 descriptors for the sites Nitrogen.

2.3 Support vector machine

SVM algorithm aims to ﬁnd a hyperplane such that the sum of distances
from the hyperplane to the nearest positive or negative training samples
was maximized Wapnik, 1999). The optimization problem can be
described as follows:

where S,- is the slack variable that allows training errors, whereas CH and
C_1 are penalty of misclassifying positive and negative samples, respect-
ively. Through those additional terms, SVM can handle non-linearly
separable training data. Besides, kernel function is applied to avoid the
dimensionality problems when constructing hyperplane in a high dimen-
sional space. Details of the theory can be found elsewhere (Burges, 1998;
Vapnik, 1999).

The SVM classiﬁer for each reaction type was established using the
LibSVM package (version 3.0) (Chang and Lin, 2001) with the radial
basis function (RBF) kernel [exp (-y||u-v||2]. To avoid skewing to predict-
ing majority class, a larger penalty is applied when misclassifying samples
from minority class. In the package of LibSVM, the penalty of class i is
calculated as C,: W,-*C, where Wi is the weighting parameter. Here the
weight of the majority class was set to be 1, and the weight of the minority
class was determined according to the following relationship:

W+1 _ NEG
W_1 _ POS

 

(3)

where POS and NEG is the number of reactive and non-reactive sites,
respectively. Finally, parameters C and V were optimized simultaneously
during genetic algorithm (GA)-based feature selection as described in the
next section.

2.4 Feature selection and parameter optimization

Overﬁtting often occurs when a model uses more terms than necessary
Giawkins, 2004). Because the degree of degeneracy of our deﬁned
descriptors can be high, models built using all of them could be easily
overﬁtting. Therefore, it is important to select a subset of relevant and
non-redundant features. Up until now, there are a couple of frequently
used feature selection techniques (Gonzalez et al., 2008), such as forward
and backward stepwise, GA, replacement method and so forth.

In the present study, for each pair of highly correlated features
GDearson correlation coefﬁcient r22 0.9), the one with smaller F—score
was removed ﬁrst. The F-score of j-th descriptor is deﬁned as follows
(Guyon et al., 2002):

—_1 —2
(Xi 46-)

— 2
1 —1 —1
71—1—1 g:  —  )

(Xi; - Z)

1 +1 ﬁ (4)
"+1—1Xk: (stj —  >

F]:

where, XJTI, Xj‘l,  are the average values of j-th descriptor of positive,
negative and the overall samples, respectively; n+1, n_1 are the number of
positive and negative samples; X23, X13. are the k-th value of the j-th
descriptor of positive and negative samples, respectively. Feature with a
larger F—score was supposed to contribute more to the followed classiﬁ-
cation modeling.

Then, the framework of GA-based feature selection strategy as
described previously Wang et al., 2010) was applied to select the descrip-
tors and optimize the SVM parameters (i.e. C, y) simultaneously. The
ﬁtness function of GA was deﬁned as

Fitness 2 BACCCV — weight * Ndesp (5)

where BACCc, is the balanced accuracy (deﬁned in the next section) of
10-fold CV, Ndesp is the number of selected descriptors to build SVM
model and weight controls the number of selected descriptors. Different
weight values were tested, and it was set to 0.0015 due to the associated
BA CCcv being consistently higher during the GA evolution.

2.5 Model performance

Given the quantities of true positive (TP), false negative (FN), true nega-
tive (TN) and false positive (FP), a classiﬁer can usually be estimated by
sensitivity [SE = TP/(TP + FN)], speciﬁcity [SP 2 TN/ (TN + FP)] and
accuracy [ACC 2 (TP + TN) /(TP + FN + TN + FP)]. SE is the measure

of the rate correctly identifying a site as reactive given it is truly glucur-
onidated; SP, in contrast, is the measure of the rate correctly identifying a
site as non-reactive given it is non-glucuronidated. Accuracy is the widely
used measure of overall classiﬁcation performance, but it is not appro-
priate when the dataset is imbalanced. Considering that the ratios of
reactive to non-reactive sites for different reaction types varies from
0.25 to 3.19, three alternative metrics, balanced accuracy
[BACC 2 (SE + SP)/2] (Lemnaru and Potolea, 2012), area under receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) (Fawcett, 2006) and Matthews cor-
relation coefﬁcient (MCC) (Matthews et al., 1975), were used to evaluate
the performance of obtained models.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Overview of glucuronidation sites

To model the sites of glucuronidation, dataset containing four
types of functional groups were collected and listed in Table 2.
When looking at the fraction of SOMs of each functional group,
we can see that the ability of glucuronidation varies over differ-
ent atom species. In general, oxygen atoms have more tendency
to be glucuronidated over nitrogen atoms, whereas the local
structure of oxygen atoms can also affect the reaction. As
shown in Table 2, both ArOH and COOH have much more
reactive sites than non-reactive ones, whereas AlOH has nearly
same number of reactive and non-reactive sites. As shown in
previous study (Kerdpin et al., 2009; Magdalou et al., 2010),
deprotonation of the substrate is one of the key steps during
O-glucuronidation. Thus the observed different reactive SOM
ratios could be partially explained by the deprotonation ability
of different reaction types. If other substituent effects are neg-
lected, the alkyl group of AlOH has electron donating effect,
which increases the electron density of O-H bond. On the con-
trary, the electron density of O-H bond of ArOH and COOH is
lower due to the withdrawing effect of the corresponding groups.
Accordingly, the interaction between oxygen and hydrogen of
AlOH could be in general stronger than that of ArOH and
COOH, leading to less deprotonated oxygens and reactive
sites. Therefore, the reactivity of a given atom could be altered
by the local environment, and descriptors characterizing such
inﬂuence were supposed to be a discriminating predictor. For
example, of the calculated descriptors, Mulliken (1955) bond
order, also known as Mulliken’s overlap population, can char-
acterize the accumulation of the electrons between two bonded
atoms, and thus measures the strength of covalent bonding.
Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed that B_0H (Mulliken bond
order of O-H bond) of AlOH is on average greater than that
of ArOH and COOH (both P—values are <0.001).

3.2 Validation of classifiers

A combination of selected descriptors and SVM parameters with
the highest GA ﬁtness score were used to model the ﬁnal classi-
ﬁers for each kind of glucuronidation reaction type. As being
part of the ﬁtness function of GA, BACC of 10-fold CV of each
model was optimized during feature selection. After thousands of
generations, the ﬁnal result of 10-fold CV was listed in Table 3,
from which one can see that a well and balanced performance
can be obtained after GA-based feature selection. The statistics
of each model on test set was also listed in Table 3. The results
indicate that our classiﬁers have generally high performance of

is more discriminative if its ROC curve locates in the top left corner
further away from the diagonal line

predicting both glucuronidated and non-glucuronidated sites,
with BACC being 0.89, 0.88, 0.90 and 0.96, respectively.
Besides, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of each
model on test set was shown in Figure 3, where the ROC
curve for a random guess results was a diagonal line from
bottom left to top right. It can be found that all curves were
located far above the diagonal line, suggesting strong predictive
performance of the obtained glucuronidation models.

To further evaluate our models, an external test set including
54 molecules was collected from reference. This set contains all
four types of SOMs. By applying the built models to these mol-
ecules, 129 of 148 potential SOMs were correctly predicted with
an overall accuracy of 0.87. Altogether 57 of 68 experimentally
observed SOMs were successfully identiﬁed, yielding an SE value
of 0.84. A summary of prediction results was listed in Table 4,
from which we can see that the four models recognized most of
experimentally observed SOMs. Some examples were shown in
Figure 4, where potential SOMs were marked with circles. For
example, dihydropyrrolopyrimidine is a PI3K inhibitor designed
by Kawada et al. (2013) with IC50 value of 0.0086 ,u.M.
This compound was metabolically unstable because of rapid
glucuronidation of the phenol moiety, as reﬂected by a

provide useful information for structural modiﬁcation to
change the pharmacokinetic proﬁle of the compound.

Another point of note is that there are 74 negative sites of

3.3 Selected descriptors

To characterize the sites of glucuronidation, the initial descriptor
set was reduced and optimized with a GA-based selection
procedure. Table 5 summarized the selected descriptors for
each model.

Among all those selected two-center QC descriptors, energy-
related ones (e. g. J, B, C, EE2, NN2, C2) characterize the inter-
action energy between two bonded atoms (i.e. bonding strength),
which is related to the deprotonation ability in the case of
O-glucuronidation. The palar_AB describes how electronic
charge of the studied reaction site is perturbed by its neighbor

(Karelson et al., 1996). Of the selected one-center QC descriptors,
NA (Fukui atomic nucleophilic reactivity index) and SEA (elec-
trophilic superdelocalizability) describe the nucleophilicity of an
atom toward glucuronic acid, and RA (Fukui atomic one-
electron reactivity index) is a general indicator of the atomic
susceptibility to electrophilic or nucleophilic attack (Brown and
Simas, 1982; Karelson et al., 1996). These three descriptors are
representation of local reactivity of a molecule from different
emphases. Accordingly, at least one of them was selected for
each resulted models, which suggested that the GA-based
approach is efﬁcient in selecting relevant descriptors.

Apart from those local descriptors, we also calculated a couple
of physical—chemical descriptors to characterize the overall prop-
erty that a molecule possesses. These global descriptors, such as
logP and molecular volume (M V), are useful to understand the
favorable properties that a molecule should possess to be glucur-
onidated. As shown in Figure 5, for O-glucuronidation sites
(i.e. AlOH, ArOH and COOH), the value of logP of the mol-
ecules containing reactive sites are more likely to be larger than
those containing non-reactive sites. P—values of Wilcoxon rank-
sum test were <0.005. The value of M V for the sites of AlOH,
COOH and Nitrogen, instead, shows a reversed tendency. From
these results, we may infer that molecules with higher lipophili-
city and relatively small molecular size are generally more liable
to glucuronidation, which is consistent with the intuitive percep-
tion of UGT substrates.

4 DISCUSSION

Sorich et al. (2006) reported in silica models for the ﬁrst time to
predict sites of glucuronidation. By analyzing the frequency of
each functional group being metabolized, they found that the
susceptibility of different nucleophilic types varies toward
UGT-mediated glucuronidation. For example, UGTs prefer
the atom sites attaching aromatic rings over those with aliphatic

The box edges are ﬁrst and third quartiles, the band inside the box is the
median. The values in parentheses are P-values of Wilcoxon rank-sum

taining reactive sites are more likely larger than those of molecules con-
taining non-reactive sites; for M V, the alternative hypothesis is that
values of molecules containing reactive sites are more likely less than
those of molecules containing non-reactive sites

substituents. These observations are consistent with the distribu-
tion analysis result of our dataset. One of the major differences
between Sorich’s and our work is that their models predict iso-
zyme-speciﬁc regioselectivity, whereas our models are reaction-
speciﬁc that consider the overall effect of all UGT isoforms.
Given the genetic polymorphism of the enzyme, it is expected
that the isozyme—speciﬁc models may help understanding and
predicting individual differences in drug response. However,
after analyzing the metabolism data collected here, it is clear
that there is a signiﬁcant overlap between the isoforms.
Excluding all substrates with overlapping speciﬁcity would not
yield statistically meaningful results because the datasets were
too small. In this study, we choose to construct separate SOM
models for different functional groups, as they may possess dif-
ferent properties. For each of them, a GA-based approach was
used to select the appropriate descriptors to characterize their
reactivity. From the cross-validation results (only the results of
10-fold CV were provided in Sorich’s work), our models showed
improved and more balanced performance. Moreover, our
models were evaluated by both internal and external test sets,
and all these evaluations suggest that our models have excellent
performances on predicting potential glucuronidation sites.
Actually, at early stages of drug discovery, the UGT isoform
responsible for a speciﬁc pathway is seldom experimentally deter-
mined, and medicinal chemists care more about the accurate
‘soft’ sites for structural protection and modiﬁcation. The reac-
tion-speciﬁc methods, due to a better consideration of local
reactivity, would be more suitable for improving the prediction
of UGT-mediated SOMs.

In general, the current models are capable of reproducing 84%
of experimentally observed SOMs. Though reasonably success-
ful, we noticed that they tend to give incorrect predictions some-
times, especially for some molecules containing a large number
of potential sites. The reasons for this can be multifold, but
primarily we think it is because the current models have not
accounted for the kinetic issue. For a molecule containing
many potential sites, those sites may compete for UGT with
each other, and have different reaction rates. Consequently,
there are only a few major routes, and some ‘actually’ active

sites are not experimentally eminent. Because the current models
cannot compare the priority of different sites within or across
reactions, they do not match all of the experimentally observed
SOMs. In addition, the current study only used the local reactiv-
ity descriptors and the overall physical—chemical properties,
whereas there are other factors that should be modeled. For
example, the local steric effect of ligand may hinder the nucleo-
philic attack of reaction site on the cofactor. Therefore, further
improvement should focus on the reaction kinetic issue and
try to take more factors related to the metabolism into
consideration.

5 CONCLUSION

In the present work, we developed four in silica models to predict
human UGT-catalyzed SOMs for the following potential sites:
aliphatic hydroxyl, aromatic hydroxyl, carboxyl group, aliphatic/
aromatic amino nitrogen and heterocyclic nitrogen. Extensive
validations were carried out on the models, and the results
demonstrated good predicting performances on both internal
and external tests. Among the GA-selected descriptors, we
found that local descriptors such as bond strength (between re-
active site and its neighbor) and F ukui atomic reactivity indices
are important to characterize the glucuronidation potential of a
site. Moreover, the distribution analysis of global descriptors
suggested that molecules with higher lipophilicity and relatively
small molecular size are generally more liable to glucuronidation.
Overall, the current study may provide insight for understanding
human phase II metabolic proﬁle of a chemical, and the resulted
in silica models allow chemists to make rational decisions more
quickly during pharmacokinetic lead optimization.

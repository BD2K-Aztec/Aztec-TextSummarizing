ABSTRACT

Summary: We present LaTcOm, a new web tool, which offers several
alternative methods for ‘rare codon cluster’ (RCC) identification
from a single and simple graphical user interface. In the current
version, three RCC detection schemes are implemented: the recently
described %MinMax algorithm and a simplified sliding window
approach, along with a novel modification of a linear-time algorithm
for the detection of maximally scoring subsequences tailored to
the RCC detection problem. Among a number of user tunable
parameters, several codon-based scales relevant for RCC detection
are available, including tRNA abundance values from Escherichia
coli and several codon usage tables from a selection of genomes.
Furthermore, useful scale transformations may be performed upon
user request (e.g. linear, sigmoid). Users may choose to visualize
RCC positions within the submitted sequences either with graphical
representations or in textual form for further processing.
Availability: LaTcOm is freely available online at the URL http://

1 INTRODUCTION

tRNA abundance is asymmetric (non—uniform) in cells of different
organisms and can cause variation in the translation rate for each
codon. It has been suggested that rare codons and their clusters are
associated with translational pausing (Guisez et al., 1993; Komar
and J aenicke, 1995). The translational rate can be maximized at
mRNA regions with codons read by high cellular levels of cognate
tRNA species and minimized at sites corresponding to rare tRNAs
(RCCs) (Lavner and Kotlar, 2005). A critical issue is that the
concentration of isoaccepting tRNAs for a set of synonymous
codons varies among organisms, tissues and stages of differentiation
(Ikemura, 1985). Moreover, different organisms show speciﬁc
preferences for codons encoding the same amino acid (codon bias),
reﬂected in the frequency of occurrence of synonymous codons in
genomic DNA. In Escherichia coli, it has been shown that the non-
random choice of codons is mostly attributable to the availability of
transfer RNA within a cell (Ikemura, 1981); however, more recent

work by Dong et al. (1996) has shown that the correlation of codon
usage and tRNA level is not perfect.

In principle, the RCC detection process is the identiﬁcation of
codon clusters corresponding to rare tRNA species along mRNAs,
as quantiﬁed using scales of experimental cellular tRNA levels.
A complete dataset of this type is only available for E.coli (Dong
et al., 1996); therefore, approaches based on codon usage scales
are alternatively used. Recently, two different methods have been
developed for identifying RCCs in coding sequences: the %MinMax
algorithm (Clarke and Clark (2008); http://www.cod0ns.org) and
RiboTempo [(Zhang et al. (2009); Zhang and Ignatova (2009);
http://hxapp.hexun.com/RiboTempo/Default.aspx)].

%MinMax utilizes codon usage scales, and RiboTempo relies
on scales based on tRNA-abundance data to quantify translational
elongation rates (see Supplementary Material for further details).
Both web servers offer different features, e.g. scale options and
output formats, and they use a simple sliding window approach,
with ﬁxed window size w equal to 18 and 19, respectively. These
w values correspond to the optimal window size (18) proposed for
the problem of identifying translational pause sites by Makhoul and
Trifonov (2002) (for a discussion see Supplementary Material). An
obvious limitation of window-based methods is the detection of
RCCs with length at least equal to the applied window size.

We present LaTcOm, a novel ﬂexible web server, aiming to
address shortcomings of the existing methods and to also provide
new tools and features for RCC detection. LaTcOm offers users
the option to use the %MinMax and RiboTempo methods, along
with a new window-less RCC detection approach, based on the
linear time Maximal Scoring Subsequences algorithm [MSS; (Ruzzo
and Tompa, 1999)]. In addition, both tRNA-abundance and codon
usage scales are supported, including the option for users to enter
their own scales, and a selection of novel transformations that may
prove useful for RCC analyses. Moreover, the ability to choose
different values of w for window-based RCC detection schemes, the
explicit report of RCC coordinates and simulation-based P-Values as
a measure for statistical RCC validation, enable more sophisticated
analyses of RCCs.

2 METHODS

Implementation: we developed in Perl a generic sliding window algorithm,
for implementing the %MinMax and RiboTempo methods. Contrary to the
initial implementations, the sliding window procedure offered by LaTcOm
is purposedly of decreasing size when approaching sequence extremeties for
enabling computing biologically relevant values near the 5’ and 3’ termini.
In addition, LaTcOm offers access to a novel RCC identiﬁcation scheme,
based on tailoring the Maximal Scoring Subsequences algorithm [MSS;

Ruzzo and Tompa (1999)]. Brieﬂy, MSS takes as input an array of numerical
values and is guaranteed to ﬁnd in linear time all maximal segments with an
aggregate score exceeding some predeﬁned threshold.
Scales for RCC identiﬁcation integrated in LaTcOm include (see also
Supplementary Material and Supplementary Figure S1 for details):
0 Escherichia coli tRNA abundance values, based on data from Dong
et al. (1996), as calculated in Zhang et al. (2009), and an in-house
calculated variant;

0 (weighted) codon usage from a subset of highly expressed E.coli
genes, taken from Table 4 of Dong et al. (1996);

0 codon usage tables available from http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/
(Nakamura et al., 2000); and
0 user deﬁned scales in GCG format.
Tunable parameters include the window size or the least RCC length and
the genetic code. A number of scale transformations is available (see below)
and their utility is discussed in Supplementary Material and Supplementary
Figure S2:

‘Linear shift’ (x—>x—x), where the scale-average (x) is subtracted
from each given scale value x, followed by reversing the sign.

‘Multiplicative inverse’ (x—>)1—C), where each scale value x is
substituted by 11—6.

‘Sigmoid’ applied to a linearly shifted scale (x—>  — 1).

A combination of the multiplicative inverse and linear transformations
(x —> % — 11—6).

Workﬂow: users may enter or upload FASTA formatted coding DNA/mRNA
sequences, and choose the desired RCC identiﬁcation algorithm, parameters
and output type (Supplementary Figure S3). LaTcOm validates user input
(see Supplementary Material) and transforms the sequence into a linear
array of tRNA abundance or codon usage values based on the selected scale
(and possibly transformation). This numerical array is fed as input to the
selected RCC identiﬁcation algorithm. Results are presented as PNG images
(graphical output) or as the array of values calculated by each algorithm
(text output), and returned to the user within an HTML page, along with
the set of chosen parameters for reference (Supplementary Figure S4). Text
output enables users to Visualize the RCC detection results using third-party
tools, and displays the analytically computed expected score value and a
simulation-based P-Value for each cluster (see Supplementary Material). All
output can be Visualized online or downloaded as a compressed archive.

3 DISCUSSION

Clusters of unusual codon composition have been the focus of
several recent research efforts, especially as indicators of an extra
level of cell regulation (Tuller et al., 2011), as well as possible
mediators of correct protein folding (Saunders and Deane, 2010). We
developed LaTcOm, which is to the best of our knowledge the ﬁrst
ﬂexible web application offering alternative methods for detecting
RCCs, and we introduce a new window-less RCC identiﬁcation
algorithm. It is worth mentioning that when the LaTcOm web
server was being developed, another window-less RCC-detection
approach, based on the spatial scan method [introduced by Huang
et al. (2007)] was published (Ponnala, 2010). A detailed comparison
of the features offered by different RCC-detection algorithms is
available as Supplementary Material (Supplementary Table S1).
We anticipate that the availability of a versatile online tool
for RCC identiﬁcation will enable a number of analyses to be
performed. For example, when optimizing coding sequences for
heterologous gene expression experiments, LaTcOm results could
be indicative of codon choices that may interfere with proper
folding of the polypeptide chain. More speciﬁcally, RCCs according

to the host organism’s tRNA abundance/codon usage may have
to be preserved for expressing functional proteins. In addition,
LaTcOm may be used to study patterns of translational rate within
diverged protein families, or the correlation of translational rate with
protein structural and functional features, such as protein disorder,
aggregation and co-translational folding. Such applications may
trigger extensions of the current methods, as for example for the
analysis of multiple sequence alignments (Widmann et al., 2008)
and the study of the mechanics of translation (Tuller et al., 2011).

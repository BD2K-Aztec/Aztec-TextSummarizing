Abstract

Motivation: Completing the genome sequence of an organism is an important task in comparative,
functional and structural genomics. However, this remains a challenging issue from both a compu-
tational and an experimental viewpoint. Genome scaffolding (i.e. the process of ordering and orien-
tating contigs) of de novo assemblies usually represents the first step in most genome finishing
pipelines.

Results: In this article we present MEDUSA (Multi-Draft based Scaffolder), an algorithm for genome
scaffolding. MEDUSA exploits information obtained from a set of (draft or closed) genomes from
related organisms to determine the correct order and orientation of the contigs. MEDUSA formalizes
the scaffolding problem by means of a combinatorial optimization formulation on graphs and im-
plements an efficient constant factor approximation algorithm to solve it. In contrast to currently
used scaffolders, it does not require either prior knowledge on the microrganisms dataset under
analysis (e.g. their phylogenetic relationships) or the availability of paired end read libraries. This
makes usability and running time two additional important features of our method. Moreover,
benchmarks and tests on real bacterial datasets showed that MEDUSA is highly accurate and, in
most cases, outperforms traditional scaffolders. The possibility to use MEDUSA on eukaryotic data-
sets has also been evaluated, leading to interesting results.

1 Introduction

The de novo assembly of short-read sequencing data usually leads to
a fragmented set of genomic sequences (contigs). Ordering and ori-
entating such contigs (scaffolding) represents the first, non-trivial
step towards genome finishing and usually requires extensive pro-
cessing and manual editing of large blocks of sequence (Barton and
Barton, 2012).

The preferred approach to genome scaffolding is currently based
on assembling the sequenced reads into contigs and then using
paired-end information to join them into scaffolds. Most of the soft-
ware based on such approach have several preparatory steps in
which read and contig libraries are first converted to a specific for-
mat, then mapped against each other by means of an external
aligner [e.g. BWA, (Li and Durbin, 2009) or BOWTIE, (Langmead
et al., 2009)] and finally used to possibly join contigs together. At
the end of this pipeline, a scaffolding graph is usually constructed
and a plethora of different methods can be used to analyse the graph
and produce the resulting scaffold structure. Currently available
methods/software include SOPRA (Dayarian et al., 2010), SCARPA
(Donmez and Brudno, 2013), MIP (Salmela et al., 2011), Opera
(Gao et al., 2011), GRASS (Gritsenko et al., 2012) and SSPACE
(Boetzer et al., 2011). A recent survey (Hunt et al., 2014) analyses
and benchmarks most of these recent and sophisticated scaffolding
software. The authors showed that, in general, they are not satisfy-
ing either in terms of usability or in terms of the quality of the solu-
tion, leading to the conclusion that there is still scope for
improvements in this area.

An alternative approach for scaffolding genomes relies on the
use of a complete (closed) reference genome to guide the ordering
and the orientating of the contigs. Many available methods exist for
mapping (and then scaffolding) the generated draft contigs
(Galardini et al., 2011; Darling et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2013; van
Hijum et al., 2005; Kolmogorov et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2013;
Husemann and Stoye, 2010). This approach is also used in some
specific contexts, such as for ancient DNA fragments reconstruction
(Rajaraman et al., 2013), where read information is not available or
reliable.

These software differ in terms of their overall strategy and imple-
mentation but, in general, (i) they allow for only a single reference
genome (Galardini et al., 2011); (ii) when multiple genomes are
allowed, generally these have to be closed and (iii) a reference phyl-
ogeny accounting for the evolutionary relationships among the se-
lected taxa is to be provided to guide a multi-reference genomes-
based scaffolding (Kolmogorov et al., 2014). None of the aforemen-
tioned approaches is capable of ignoring all of these constraints
that, taken together, represent important practical limitations.
Indeed, with the exception of model organisms, reliable closed refer-
ence genomes are not always available. Moreover, especially in the
case of bacteria, genomic rearrangements among closely related or-
ganisms may introduce important structural differences, hampering
the scaffolding procedure based on a single genome as reference.
Finally, the requirement of a reliable phylogenetic reconstruction
can pose a significant challenge, since it is not always straightfor-
ward for some bacterial taxa for which the large genetic variability
in gene content inside a same species can lead to different phyloge-
nies depending on which molecular marker and/or approach is used.

To overcome the difficulties that characterize currently available
methods, we developed MEDUSA (Multi-Draft based Scaffolder), an
algorithm for scaffolding draft genomes by ordering and orientating
a set of de novo obtained contigs and thus speeding up genome fin-
ishing. Unlike most of the other software, MEDUSA: (i) formalizes

the scaffolding problem by means of a combinatorial optimization
formulation on graphs and implements an efficient constant factor
approximation algorithm to solve it; (ii) allows for multiple refer-
ence genomes to be used during scaffolding; (iii) does not require
prior knowledge on the evolutionary relationships (i.e. a phylogen-
etic tree) among the reference set of organisms and (iv) can handle
both draft and complete reference genomes. This latter point is of
great importance in practice since, in current public databases, the
availability of draft genomes greatly exceeds that of completely
sequenced ones (Reddy et al., 2014). Moreover, since retrieving the
additional information needed by the aforementioned scaffolders
can be a challenging task, an algorithm that does not rely on such
prior knowledge is of great interest and allows the inclusion of a
larger set of genomes for the scaffolding process. The strategy of
MEDUSA is based on the intuition that a set of genomes related to
the target one can be used for assigning a relative position to each
contig, and that this kind of information is easily available in prac-
tice. Specifically, those contigs mapping on adjacent regions in these
other genomes are considered to be neighbours in the resulting scaf-
fold. MEDUSA formalizes such scaffolding problem as a path cover
problem in a graph and solves it with ad hoc optimization tech-
niques. The underlying algorithm has been implemented both in the
form of a command line software and a web server.

Testing MEDUSA on bacterial and eukaryotic datasets revealed
that our software performs very well in comparison to others cur-
rently available and answers some of the implicit requests pointed
out by Hunt et al. (2014) in their review, i.e. usability and accuracy
of the obtained results.

2 System and methods

2.1 Definitions and notation
A contig is a fragment of a source target genome. Let T be the target
genome consisting of a set of n contigs c0, ..., cn_1 of various lengths.

An ordering of T corresponds to finding the true relative pos-
itions of the contigs c,- in the source sequence. The orientation of a
contig indicates which strand of the source sequence it belongs to.
We denote the reverse and complement of a contig c by Z. By dual-
ity, if c belongs to one strand, then E belongs to the other strand.

Consecutive oriented contigs in the ordering can be joined into a
longer (gapped) supercontig called a scaffold. Informally, the scaf-
folding problem consists in inferring the order and orientation of the
contigs in T. The (ideal) solution of the problem is one scaffold per
chromosome of the source DNA sequence.

Therefore, if the source DNA sequence contains more chromo-
somes, then T contains contigs from more than one chromosome,
and the solution consists in a set of scaffolds, i.e. in a partial order-
ing of the contigs of T. Moreover, due to possible errors in the as-
sembly of the sequenced reads, even if the source DNA sequence
contains one chromosome, the solution of the problem may be a set
of scaffolds.

Consider in addition a collection D 2 {D0, ..., Dk_1} of compari-
son genomes, where Do, ..., Dk_1 are sets of contigs. Our
algorithm is designed to determine a set of scaffolds on T and an
orientation of its contigs by making use of the additional informa-
tion provided by D.

Let T and D be given. We map the contigs of T on the contigs of
D1,, for all D], in D.

A contig c,- E T hits a contig d E D], if c,- or its reverse and com-
plement c7 aligns to d. We call hit the subsequence between the first
and the last matching positions of c,- on d.

We use the software nucmer from MUMMER (Kurtz et al., 2004)
to align the contigs of T on the contigs of D1,, for all D], in D and re-
cover similar hits.

If c,- hits more than once the contigs of D1,, we call hest hit of c,-
on D], the hit with maximum coverage, and we call first position of
the best hit the minimum between the start and end coordinates of
the best hit on the contig of D], as assessed by MUMMER.

Let us denote the first position of the best hit of c,- on D], by p39.

We also define two variables f orw}, which is true if c,- maps for-
ward and back; if it maps reverse (Obviously f orwfg = ﬁbackz).

Observe that the value p; is defined if and only if the contig c,-
hits D1,.

We make use of two kinds of information in different steps: the
first one to determine an order of the contigs and the second to as-
sign an orientation to each of them. Our method is composed of
three main computational steps: graph construction, order determin-
ation and orientation assignment.

2.2 Graph construction
In the first step, we construct an undirected weighted graph G = (V, E)
as follows.

Let us associate a vertex to each contig, regardless of its orienta-
tion. Therefore, V = {121, . . . ,12,,}, and we assume that every vertex
has associated an index (from 1 to n).

We list all the best hits for every contig of the target genome on
each contig of any comparison genomes in increasing order of their
first positions.

If the best hit of c,- and the best hit of c,- are in the same contig of
D1,, then p2 and p], are both defined, and they can be compared.
In this case, if p; < p7,, and there is no 16 {0, ...,/e — 1} so
that p; < p), < p7,, we say that c,- and c,- are h-adjacent. Let us de-
fine A(c,-, c,-) = {h : c,- ish — adjacent to c,-}. There is an edge between
12,- and 12,- if A(c,-, c,-) = 0, i.e. E = {(12,-,12,-) : c,- is h—adjacent
to c,- for some h E A(c,-, c,-)}.

The weight of an edge is given as w(12,-, 12,) = |A(c,-, c,-)|; since the
cardinality of D is k, the weights range from 1 to k.

We call Scaffolding Graph the so obtained undirected weighted
graph G = (V,

2.3 Order determination

In the second step, the Scaffolding graph is used to find an order of
the contigs. A path in G is a finite sequence of edges which connect
a sequence of distinct vertices. A path co12er P of G is a set of vertex-
disjoint paths P1, . . . ,Ps that cover all the vertices of G. In a
weighted graph, cover P has total weight w(P) = Zeepw(e). From
an optimization point of view, a cover can be characterized by two
values: s (its cardinality) and w (its weight). The path cover having
minimum cardinality in general does not coincide with the cover
having maximum weight. This means that it is not possible to opti-
mize both values at a same time. Since edges encode information
about contiguity, and the weights support the existence of the edges,
a natural choice is to find a path cover of maximum weight. We
therefore formulate the problem as follows: given a scaffolding
graph G, determine a maximum weight path cover of G.
Unfortunately the problem is NP-complete since finding a
Hamiltonian path can be seen as a sub-problem. We therefore opted
for an approximation algorithm.

In Moran et al. (1990), three approximation algorithms are pre-
sented having a complexity-performance trade-off. We implemented
the most efficient algorithm that gives an approximation of 1/2.
The complexity of this method is  -log  The solution is

unique if the weights of the edges are all different, but in general,
more solutions are possible. This is due to the fact that the order in
which the edges with same weight are processed inﬂuences the solu-
tion. MEDUSA uses a stable sorting for the edges of the graph to out-
put the same solution at every run with same input.

Let us consider a path cover solution. The traversal of any path
starting from one of its endpoints establishes an increasing total
order of the contigs of T in the path. Without loss of generality, we
start the traversal of any path from the endpoint vertex with lower
index. By duality, starting from the greater index corresponds to tra-
versing the path in the opposite direction, and thus to reading the
contigs on the other strand, where the order and orientations of the
contigs are reversed.

After the order assignment, the cover so constructed can be seen
as a set P of directed paths.

2.4 Orientation assignment
In the third step, we take the orientation of the contigs into
consideration.

Let us first consider any arc (12,,12,) in a path of P meaning that
12,-< 12,- in the order. For every h E A(c,-, c,-), several relative orienta-
tions for c,- and c,- can occur. Our goal is to determine, relatively to
(12,,12,), unique orientations for the two vertices. This is done by a
majority rule, taking into account the fact that each relative orienta-
tion on one strand has a dual on the other one. More precisely, let
us define the following quantities:

1212(1)) = my : (pg, < p; A (fem; A forwjg))V

(p2. > pi. A (back; A mew

1213(2)) = |{h : (p; < 12,; A (fem; A back/my

(p2. > pi. A (back; A forwbm

31:03)) = |{h : (p; < 12,; A (back; A formw

(pf, > 172 A (fem; A backpm

BB(i,/') = |{h : (p; < p; A (back; A backpw
(pf, > 172 A (fem; A form)“

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that these four values are all
distinct (in practice, this is almost always the case). However, it is easy
to extend the following procedure to the case in which this assumption
is not true (see Supplementary File S1). We denote the orientation of c,-
(respectively, c,-) relative to the arc (12,,12,) by tail(12,-, 12,-) (respectively,
head (12,, 12,-)). We then have that tail(12,-, 12,) is forward if max {
FF(i, j), FB(i, j), BF(i, j), BB(i, 7)} e {FF(i, j), FB(i, 7)} and it is back-
ward otherwise. Analogously head(12,-, 12,) is then forward if max {
FF(i, j), FB(i, j), BF(i, j), BB(i, 7)} e {FF(i, j), BF(i, 7)} and it is back-
ward otherwise. Consider now two consecutive arcs (121 , 122) and (122,123
) in a path. We say that the orientation assignment of c2 is consistent if
and only if head(121, 122) = tail(122, 123), that is, if the two arcs propose a
consistent orientation for c2. The orientation for the contigs of T in a
same scaffold is given by consistent orientation assignments. In detail,
we start to analyse any path in P. We initialize an empty scaffold. Then,
if the orientation assignment for any two consecutive arcs is consistent,
we add the contigs corresponding to the arcs in the scaffold with the
orientation suggested; otherwise, if it is not consistent, we add the verti-
ces of the first arc to the scaffold, then we cut the second arc, and start

S1 for examples on the orientation assignment. Here we point out
that in the case in which the maximum among FF(i, j), FB(i, j), BF(i, j),
BB(i, j) is not unique, we can have a multiple assignment for the orien-
tation of 12,- or 12,-. In our method, both orientations are considered,
thereby reducing possible inconsistency in the traversal of the path for
the orientation assignment. This step can be easily carried out, since we
treat separately the orientation and the ordering. The complexity of the
entire procedure is linear in the number of vertices.

2.4.1 MEDUSA output

The algorithm then produces a scaffold by merging the oriented con-
tig sequences, using 100 undetermined bases (N) as a spacer.
Accordingly, the final output of MEDUSA is a FASTA file, where
each sequence represents a scaffold of ordered and oriented contigs
separated by stretches of 100 ‘N ’5. Alternatively, MEDUSA can infer
the distance among the joined contigs based on their distance on the
comparison genomes set (see Supplementary File S1 for details on
this step). The user can choose between these two options when
launching MEDUSA.

3 Results and discussion

In this section, we present the results we obtained when applying
our software to benchmarks (Table 1). Two of them were retrieved
from the SRA archive database (ECOL, RSPH), the SAUR dataset
was obtained from the GAGE benchmark study (Salzberg et al.,
2012), whereas the BCEN and MTUB datasets were obtained from
in-house performed Illumina HiSeq sequencing runs with a fragment
size of 500 bp. To assess the reliability of the in-house datasets, a
quality check was performed using the FastQC suite (available at
www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc) and calculat-
ing the proportion of reads correctly mapping to the assembled con-
tigs. The results obtained (reported in Supplementary File S1)
revealed no major issues for these sequencing runs. Information on
the main features of the publicly available GAGE reads dataset can
be found in Salzberg et al. (2012).

More in detail, we first analysed how MEDUSA performs on real
genome scale datasets in terms of errors, completeness and number
of reconstructed scaffolds, and how the choice of the draft genomes
used for scaffolding inﬂuences the results. Then, we compared the
performance of MEDUSA with those of five other scaffolders. To
evaluate the reliability of the solutions generated by our algorithm,
we have chosen real bacterial datasets for which (at least) one whole
genome had already been completed, that is ‘closed’, and used this
as a positive reference. From now on we will refer to the following
metrics to evaluate the results of our tests: (i) number of correct
joins, i.e. the number of true positives (those joins correctly pre-
dicted according to the comparison with the corresponding refer-
ence genome); (ii) accuracy, the number of true positives divided by

the number of proposed joins (i.e. all the joins in the computed solu-
tion). For the sake of completeness, it should be mentioned that, un-
like the score introduced by Hunt et al. (2014), our accuracy index
does not include the estimation of the distance among contigs. (iii)
recovered information, the number of true positives divided by the
expected number of joins; (iv) overall number of reconstructed scaf-
folds; (v) N5 0 and NG50 metrics and (vi) total length of joined frag-
ments. Observe that the expected joins correspond to the number of
contigs minus the number of chromosomes. Moreover a join be-
tween two contigs is considered correct if and only if (i) the contigs
are directly consecutive in the genome (no other contig appears in
between and they belong to the same replicon) and (ii) the orienta-
tion of the two fragments is correct.

3.1 Genome-scale datasets
MEDUSA was tested on datasets of genomes from five microbial rep-
resentatives (Table 1), each of which is composed as follows:

° a target genome (the draft genome to be scaffolded).

° a set of draft genomes from (more or less) closely related strains
(named comparison genomes) to be used in the scaffolding pipe-
line of MEDUSA.

Except for the SAUR dataset for which we used the contigs from
the benchmark work of Hunt et al. (2014), for each of the tested
datasets, the target genome was obtained from the sequencing reads
using ABySS V. 1.3.7 (Simpson et al., 2009). Several k-mer values
were tried for each dataset. The one leading to the best assembly [as
described in Fondi et al. (2014)] was chosen and used as input for
MEDUSA afterwards. Although genome assembly information is not
necessary to use our method, we preferred building the target gen-
ome from reads to use exactly the same instance as input for the
other programs during benchmarking (see Section 3.4).

The results of these tests are summarized in Table 2. The general
goal of reducing the fragmentation of the set of contigs is achieved
well. The number of fragments obtained after MEDUSA is applied is
significantly smaller than the initial number of contigs. Also, in most
cases, the majority of the scaffolds is composed of more than one
original contig, that is, is multi-contig. Remarkably, in the case of
the MTUB dataset, for which a complete genome (that of
Mycohacterium tuberculosis KZNV2475) was available among the
comparison ones, the result is a single scaffold with an overall length
close to the one of the input draft. It is to be noticed that, when
referring to multi-contig scaffolds, we are referring to scaffolds gen-
erated by joining two or more original contigs together, without tak-
ing into consideration the possible presence of internal breakpoints
(usually represented by ‘Ns’) inside a contig. In other words, the pos-
sible gaps in the input contigs (as a result of sequencing ambiguities
and/or placed by the de no120 assembler) have not been considered in
the calculation of the number of multi-contig scaffolds. Finally, to

further test the robustness of our approach, we also evaluated (i) the
inﬂuence on the overall scaffolding procedure of contigs with mul-
tiple hits among the comparison set, (ii) the reliability of the esti-
mated gap lengths, (iii) the possibility to integrate sequence
similarity information between target and comparison contigs when
giving a weight to the edges and (iv) the performances of our ap-
proach on two eukaryotic datasets, namely Saccharomyces cere12i-
siae S288c and Drosophila melanogaster. The results of this analysis
are reported in Supplementary File S1 (Section 7—10) and revealed
that MEDUSA is capable of producing good results even when trying
to scaffold large and complex genomes.

3.2 Influence of the taxonomical distance

The choice of a set of comparison genomes is left to the user and de-
pends mostly on the organism under study. Nevertheless, some
guidelines can be extracted from experimental analyses on the pre-
sent datasets. The results displayed in Tables 3—7 clarify how the
phylogenetic distance between target and comparison genomes in-
ﬂuences the scaffolding procedure. We repeated the same test for

five different target genomes: Escherichia coli (Table 3), M. tubercu-
losis (Table 4), Staphylococcus aureus (Table 5 ), Burkholderia ceno-
cepacia (Table 6) and Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Table 7)

For each target genome, we have created a series of different sets
of comparison draft genomes, in increasing order of phylogenetic
distance from the target (from stains belonging to the same species
up to strains belonging to unrelated genera). After that, some sets of
comparison genomes are created by merging the different groups.
These results are interesting for many reasons. First, as expected, the
information provided by the comparison drafts tends to decrease
with the increase of the distance, and becomes totally insufficient
after a certain taxonomical distance (roughly the genus level). The
solutions at this level become very poor (the number of scaffolds is
close to the initial number of contigs). On one hand, this means that
the comparison drafts should be chosen as close as possible to the
target. In microbial genomics, this is usually not a problem because
some more or less closely related draft genomes are likely to be pre-
sent for (virtually) each newly sequenced genome. On the other
hand, this phenomenon means that the method is robust to noise
(false positives are very rare). This aspect is confirmed by the second

set of experiments, where the set of comparison drafts does not be-
long to a single taxonomic group. Notably, the quality of the scaf-
folds obtained by adding the whole set of comparison genomes
(distant and closer ones) is usually not too far from the one obtained
with the closest possible genomes. This means that the user could
potentially add many draft genomes, without the risk of introducing
much misleading noise. Of course, in the case where the compari-
son drafts are numerous, the required contig mapping phase
(nucmer in our implementation) will sensibly increase the algorithm
running time.

3.3 Varying the number of draft and complete
comparison genomes

The second parameter in the choice of the comparison dataset is the
number of reference genomes to use. This aspect has been investigated
using the ECOL, MTUB and SAUR datasets. This choice relies on
the fact that, for these organisms, a considerable number of com-
plete genomes are available to perform the tests described later. All
the available draft and complete genomes from representatives of
the M.tuberculosis species were retrieved from the NCBI database,
in addition to 50 draft and complete genomes from representatives
of the E.coli and S.aureus species. A number of different instances
equal to the number of the retrieved genomes for each dataset (N)
were built, with an increasing number of comparison genomes (from
1 to N) used during each test. This increase was performed consist-
ently only adding new drafts to the previous set. Since the choice of
the order in which the drafts are added could influence the
solution, all the tests were repeated 10 times, each time varying
the relative order of the comparison genomes. Moreover, since
MEDUSA allows mixing closed and draft genomes in the comparison
set, we tested how the presence of closed genomes affected the
behaviour of the algorithm. To do this, another set of tests was
performed using closed genomes instead of drafts in the compari-
son set. For each dataset, the following values are presented: accur-
acy (Fig. 1), recovered information (Fig. 2) and number of scaffolds
(Fig. 3).

The results obtained showed a similar trend in all the datasets
and for each of the metrics computed. After an initial improvement,
the performances (in terms of accuracy, recovered information
and number of scaffolds) stabilize with respect to the increase of
the number of comparison genomes included in the dataset.

These results suggest that our method is sufficiently robust to noise
created by redundant information. Also, the small number of false
positives included in the final solutions is confirmed by the extreme
stability of the accuracy level, shown in Figure 1. These consider-
ations are true whether closed or draft genomes are used as the com-
parison set. With the only exception of the MTUB dataset, the use
of closed genomes gives more information and the completeness of
the solution is higher. On the other hand, the accuracy in this case is
slightly lower. This can be explained by at least two lines of evi-
dence. From a biological viewpoint, complete genomes may embed
structural variations (e.g. duplicated and/or inverted regions) that,
due to de no120 assembly issues, might not be observed in their

fragmented draft counterparts. These biological features, in turn,
may hinder the scaffolds reconstruction and possibly lead to wrong
joins.

Moreover, from an informational viewpoint, including
complete genomes in the comparison dataset may lead to an
increased number of predicted joins and, consequently, to a higher
false-positive rate. The choice of the comparison genomes is crucial
for evaluating the performance of MEDUSA since the choice of
strains phylogenetically related to the target genome is less likely to
produce a poor quality graph, eventually leading to better scaffolds
and a low number of true positives. However, relatively recent
evolutionary events, such as lineage-specific genomic re-
arrangements, could affect the results of MEDUSA with false-positive
adj acencies even when the genomes from strains of the same species
of the target are chosen as reference. In such cases, we recommend
to use a weighting scheme based on sequence similarity that has
been shown to perform better in specific cases (see Supplementary
File S1).

3.4 Benchmarking

The performance of MEDUSA was compared with those of five other
programs, namely SOPRA V. 1.4.6 (Dayarian et al., 2010),
SCARPA V. 0.241 (Donmez and Brudno, 2013), Opera V. 1.4 (Gao
et al., 2011), SSPACE v. 3.0 (Boetzer et al., 2011), RAGOUT v. 1.0
(Kolmogorov et al., 2014). The first four of these scaffolders are
paired ends-based and the choice to use these specific ones was
based on both their performances and their usability as assessed by
Hunt et al. (2014). The choice to use the recently developed RAGOUT

E.Bosi et al.

 

relies on the fact that it implements an overall strategy that resem-
bles that of MEDUSA, although requiring more input information
(phylogenetic tree of the analysed genomes). Options and param-
eters (e.g. the choice of reads mapper) for each of the paired ends-
based methods were selected among those leading to the best
performances on genome-scale data as reported in Hunt et al.
(2014) (see Supplementary File S1). Each paired ends-based soft-
ware was used both on trimmed (using DYNAMICTRIMMING from the
SOLEXAQA package (Cox et al., 2010) and Phred 30 as the quality
threshold) and untrimmed reads datasets. Indeed reads trimming is
usually performed after a sequencing run to remove poor quality
bases although, in some cases, it may lead to a loss of information
during scaffolding. We here report the values for the option—
trimmed or untrimmed—leading to the best results. With the
exception of insert length (that was set to its appropriate value
for each dataset), all the other parameters used are reported
in Supplementary File S1. As for RAGOUT, the reconstruction of
the reference phylogenetic tree was performed using OMA (Roth
et al., 2008) with default parameters. Importantly, all the results ob-
tained during this benchmarking were double-checked with those
obtained using the scripts provided by Hunt et al. (2014) in their
survey. No major differences were observed concerning the perform-
ances of the mate pairs-based scaffolders on the selected genome
datasets.

As indicated by the results of these tests (reported in Fig. 4), the
number of scaffolds produced by our algorithm is lower than that
produced by all the other four paired end-based scaffolders in all the
performed tests. Notably, RAGOUT and MEDUSA produce similar re-
sults on each dataset, with the latter leading to a lower number of
scaffolds in the BCEN, ECOL and SAUR datasets and both of them
leading to a single scaffold with the MTUB dataset. What is particu-
larly interesting is also the high percentage of multi-contig scaffolds
over the total number of scaffolds reconstructed by MEDUSA (75%,
on average), a crucial aspect since minimization of the number of
scaffolds is clearly the final goal of any scaffolding method. As ex-
pected, the analysis of the N5 0 metrics revealed that MEDUSA out-
performs all the other paired ends-based scaffolders and produces
results that are, in most cases, similar to RAGOUT (see Supplementary
File S1). Additionally, in Figure 5, we report accuracy and recovered
information for the software tested herein and for MEDUSA. This
comparison revealed that our algorithm produces results that over-
lap (and, in some cases, outperform) those from other currently
available programs, even in terms of reliability of the proposed
solution.

In conclusion, both the high percentage of true joins recovered
and the low percentage of errors observed make MEDUSA very com-
petitive with the other scaffolders in general, including those exploit-
ing a similar strategy (i.e. RAGOUT). It is to be noticed, however, that
MEDUSA requires far less information in respect to the aforemen-
tioned methods and this greatly increases its usability. Also,
MEDUSA performs very well in respect to all the other benchmarked
software in terms of required running time. Indeed, all the paired
end-based tools generally have long running time due to their repro-
cessing and read mapping stages and, on our datasets, most of them
were unable to complete the scaffolding in <2 h. Despite the fact
that RAGOUT processes input files quite quickly (23, 4, 16 and 90
min for the MTUB, RSPH, BCEN and ECOL datasets, respectively),
it requires two operations that can be quite time consuming
when dealing with a high number of genomes, i.e. computation of
orthologous groups of sequences and phylogenetic tree reconstruc-
tion. The same datasets were scaffolded by MEDUSA in <10 min, on
average.

4 Conclusion and perspectives

Draft genome scaffolding is a key step in the finishing stages of mi-
crobial genomic pipelines. In this article, we presented MEDUSA, a
novel graph theory-based algorithm for scaffolding draft genomes
by ordering and orientating their contigs. Unlike traditional soft-
ware, it does not rely either on paired-end information of sequencing
reads or on a phylogenetic distance of the microorganisms used in
the analysis. This sensibly increases the usability of our software
and, at the same time, reduces the computational time required for
genome scaffolding.

Using real microbial and eukaryotic datasets, we show that the
algorithm implemented in MEDUSA is capable of significantly reduc-
ing the fragmentation of draft genomes and, in most cases, of pro-
ducing less and longer scaffolds in comparison to commonly used
scaffolders, while maintaining comparable accuracy and correctness
of the predicted joins.

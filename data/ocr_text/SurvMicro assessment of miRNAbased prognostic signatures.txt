ABSTRACT

Summary: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in post-transcriptional
regulation of mRNA levels. Their function in cancer has been studied
by high-throughput methods generating valuable sources of public
information. Thus, miRNA signatures predicting cancer clinical out-
comes are emerging. An important step to propose miRNA-based
biomarkers before clinical validation is their evaluation in independent
cohorts. Although it can be carried out using public data, such task is
time-consuming and requires a specialized analysis. Therefore, to aid
and simplify the evaluation of prognostic miRNA signatures in cancer,
we developed SurvMicro, a free and easy-to-use web tool that
assesses miRNA signatures from publicly available miRNA profiles
using multivariate survival analysis. SurvMicro is composed of a
wide and updated database of >40 cohorts in different tissues and
a web tool where survival analysis can be done in minutes. We pre-
sented evaluations to portray the straightfonzvard functionality of
SurvMicro in liver and lung cancer. To our knowledge, SurvMicro is
the only bioinformatic tool that aids the evaluation of multivariate prog-
nostic miRNA signatures in cancer.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22—nt molecules that play an im-
portant post-transcriptional regulatory role (Reinhart et al.,
2000). This molecular mechanism has been widely studied in
cancer. It is known that some miRNAs act like oncogenes or
tumor suppressor genes (Esquela—Kerscher and Slack, 2006) and
whose regulatory roles are linked to cancer hallmarks (Ruan
et al., 2009). MiRNAs have also been proposed as drug targets
and biomarkers (Calin and Croce, 2006; Healy et al., 2012).
The roles of miRNAs in the tumor cell have been explored
using high-throughput techniques such as microarrays and
sequencing. These data have also been used to associate
miRNAs to clinical outcome in patients generating signatures
for diagnostics and prognostics that are composed of several
miRNAs (Calin and Croce, 2006). A miRNA signature trial
has been recently announced (MRX34 trial). A key issue for

miRNA signatures for cancer is their validation in diverse co-
horts (Kern, 2012). Such task generates difﬁculties even though
many public cohorts are available. These are related to time-
consuming tasks, such as exploration of repositories, acquisition
and processing and the modeling of miRNA levels, to assess their
value as prognostic biomarkers.

The current approaches for miRNAs signature validation are
limited. ProgMir (Goswami and Nakshatri, 2012) and
MIRUMIR (Antonov et al., 2013) implement only univariate
analyses even though signatures are composed of several
miRNAs (Raponi et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2013). Moreover,
both tools are restricted regarding the available cohorts. These
characteristics limit the assessment of multivariate miRNA
biomarkers.

To provide assessment of multivariable prognostic miRNA
biomarkers and to simplify the evaluation in several cohorts,
we developed SurVMicro. SurVMicro is a curated and updated
web tool of miRNA expression levels associated with clinical
outcome that provides survival analysis and risk assessment in
cancer.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

Data were collected by searching for keywords related to cancer, clinical
outcome, miRNA platforms and >30 samples. The searches were per-
formed in GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0V/geo), GEOmetadb (Zhu
et al., 2008), ArrayExpress (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) and
TCGA (https://tcga—data.nci.nih.gov/toga). TCGA data were obtained
at level 3 from the May 2013 run. TCGA read counts generated by RNA-
seq were log2 transformed. All datasets were quantile—normalized and
log2 transformed if needed. Datasets were grouped using disease ontolo-
gies (Schriml et al., 2012).

2.2 Web interface implementation

Two intuitive input pages and a results section were implemented using
Java server pages, J avaScript, R, Ajax, Apache and MySQL. The ﬁrst
input page requires the list of miRNAs, the selection of the cohort and
the treatment for multiprobe miRNAs. We annotate miRNAs using the
miRBase nomenclature (Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2006).Owing to the pres-
ence of miRNA variants, we implemented two types of searches, a ‘strict’
for speciﬁc variant evaluation and a ‘relaxed’ one that reports every vari-
ant of the miRNA entered by the user (—3p, —5p and *). After web
submission, the following analysis page obtains the rows corresponding
to the entered miRNAs in the selected dataset as well as the available
clinical characteristics. In this page, the user can customize the output of
the analysis including risk group methodology, risk groups stratiﬁcation,
model ﬁtting, heatmap and boxplot graphs, ﬁgure format, PDF report

and others. Details of the implementation and options are thoughtfully
documented in the tutorial. Finally, the results section displays the bio-
marker evaluation in publication-ready graphs and tables containing stat-
istical parameters for easy exportation and manipulation.

2.3 MiRNA-based risk assessment

To perform the risk prediction from the list of miRNAs submitted by the
user, SurvMicro uses the Cox multivariate ﬁtting from R (Therneau,
2013). The risk groups are obtained by ranking the prognostic index,
which is obtained by the sum of the products of the Cox coefﬁcients
and the expression values of corresponding miRNAs. The groups are
generated splitting the prognostic index by the median, by the quantiles
or by using a simple Log-Rank P-value optimization algorithm. The risk
groups are used to generate the Kaplan—Meier plots and statistics (Log-
Rank, concordance index and hazard ratios). Moreover, to analyze bio-
markers computed with models other than Cox, the user can specify
coefﬁcients for each miRNA. Details are provided in the tutorial.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Database and web interface

To our knowledge, SurvMicro provides the biggest compilation
of miRNA datasets related to clinical outcomes, comprising >40
datasets and 6300 samples grouped in 14 tissues. We also encour-
age any user to suggest datasets. As shown in Figure 1,
SurvMicro is easily operated by providing only the list of
miRNAs and selecting the target cohort in the input page. A
link to a comprehensive tutorial and an example button for a
quick example are located in the input page. The analysis page is
generated in a few seconds. Finally, the results section is obtained
in less than a minute (might vary if advance plots are selected)
deploying the outcome plots and tables.

3.2 Validation and applications

To assess the capabilities of SurvMicro in the evaluation of
multivariate prognostic biomarkers, we performed an analysis
of a miRNA signature for liver hepatocellular carcinoma sur-
vival, an examination of a signature for lung squamous cell car-
cinoma (LSCC) and a performance comparison of two LSCC
survival signatures. In liver, we evaluated a 20-miRNA signature
for survival carcinoma WVei et al., 2013) in two additional inde-
pendent cohorts. The summary of the survival analyses is shown
in Table 1 (Kaplan—Meier curves are shown in Section 5.1 of the
Tutorial). The performance was highly signiﬁcant in two datasets
and acceptable in one cohort. Moreover, using the stratiﬁcation
option of SurvMicro, we examined the prognostic power of this
signature in early lesions compared with advanced tumors
(shown in the Tutorial). This explorative evidence suggests that
the signature could be related to advanced tumors (Grade 3 or
Stage III). For lung, a 20-miRNA signature proposed for sur-
vival and relapse in LSCC (Raponi et al., 2009) was evaluated in
three LSCC datasets including the original dataset and a lung
adenocarcinoma dataset. The results are shown in Table 1 (de-
tailed in Tutorial Section 5.2). The Kaplan—Meier curves and
statistical information in all datasets appear acceptable even
though only two miRNAs were signiﬁcant or marginally signiﬁ-
cant using a Cox model in the Raponi dataset. By using the
ﬁtting information option of SurvMicro in the Analysis Page,
10 of the 20 miRNAs are signiﬁcant if ﬁtted in the high-risk

group suggesting that these miRNAs are important. For a com-
parison analysis of two signatures, we tested the 20 miRNAs of
the Raponi signature and a 5-miRNA signature associated to
survival in LSCC proposed by Yu et al.(2008). The summary
shown in Table 1 (the details are included in the Tutorial
Section 5.3) suggests that the Raponi signature is superior.

4 CONCLUSION

The evaluations demonstrate that a curated database and sys-
tematic tool for biomarker evaluation can rapidly produce valu-
able information for the validation of miRNA signatures in
various cohorts. We conclude that SurvMicro is a free and
easy-to-use web tool to assess the performance of prognostic
miRNA-based biomarkers.

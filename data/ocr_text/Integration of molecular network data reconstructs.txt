ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recently, a shift was made from using Gene Ontology
(GO) to evaluate molecular network data to using these data to con-
struct and evaluate GO. Dutkowski et al. provide the first evidence that
a large part of GO can be reconstructed solely from topologies of
molecular networks. Motivated by this work, we develop a novel
data integration framework that integrates multiple types of molecular
network data to reconstruct and update GO. We ask how much of GO
can be recovered by integrating various molecular interaction data.
Results: We introduce a computational framework for integration of
various biological networks using penalized non-negative matrix tri-
factorization (PNMTF). It takes all network data in a matrix form and
performs simultaneous clustering of genes and GO terms, inducing
new relations between genes and GO terms (annotations) and be-
tween GO terms themselves. To improve the accuracy of our pre-
dicted relations, we extend the integration methodology to include
additional topological information represented as the similarity in
wiring around non-interacting genes. Surprisingly, by integrating topol-
ogies of bakers’ yeasts protein—protein interaction, genetic interaction
(GI) and co-expression networks, our method reports as related 96%
of GO terms that are directly related in G0. The inclusion of the wiring
similarity of non-interacting genes contributes 6% to this large GO
term association capture. Furthermore, we use our method to infer
new relationships between GO terms solely from the topologies of
these networks and validate 44% of our predictions in the literature.
In addition, our integration method reproduces 48% of cellular com-
ponent, 41% of molecular function and 41% of biological process GO
terms, outperforming the previous method in the former two domains
of GO. Finally, we predict new GO annotations of yeast genes and
validate our predictions through Gls profiling.

1 INTRODUCTION

In many areas of biomedical research, ontologies play an import-
ant role in uniﬁcation of knowledge as a hierarchy of terms and
their mutual relationships. Among widely used ontologies is
Gene Ontology (G0), which describes genes and gene products
in terms of their associated biological process (BP), molecular
function (MF) and cellular component (CC) (Ashburner et al.,
2000). G0 is a current major source of information for annotat-
ing genes and proteins across various species and providing tools

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

for systematic assessment of experimental gene sets via enrich-
ment analysis.

Since its foundation, G0 has been growing in size and com-
plexity containing today vast amounts of annotated biological
data. Initially, G0 was manually curated by domain experts and
members of the research and annotation communities. However,
because of their inconsistency in translation to GO terms and
relations, manual curations have encountered many difficulties
(Ashburner et al., 2001). Additionally, rapid development of
technologies for biological data acquisition has resulted in an
accumulation of biological data exceeding our ability to interpret
(Chen and Xu, 2004).

To overcome these problems, many computational tools for
automatic gene and protein annotation have been devised. Much
effort has been invested in assessing the accuracy of such anno-
tation predictions (Radivojac et al., 2013). Methods for gene
annotation prediction have either followed approaches that
transfer annotations from well-observed to partially observed
genes based solely on sequence similarity (Loewenstein et al.,
2009) or approaches that directly predict function of unknown
genes using machine learning methods (Clare and King, 2003).
Recent methodologies focus more on integration of distinct bio-
logical data sources, which contribute to more accurate predic-
tions of gene annotation.

The availability of genomic-level information from high-
throughput measurements of genetic and protein interactions,
messenger RNA expression profiles and metabolic pathways
has created new opportunities for function prediction. A major
challenge is how to integrate all these diverse data to predict
annotations of yet unannotated proteins. Among the widely
used computational methods addressing this problem are
Bayesian reasoning (Chen and Xu, 2004), network-based analysis
(Mostafavi and Morris, 2010; Mostafavi et al., 2008), kernel-
basea’ statistical learning (Lanckriet et al., 2004) and matrix fac-
torization-based data fusion (Zitnik and Blaz, 2014). All these
methods have demonstrated that the integration of complemen-
tary biological data signiﬁcantly improves accuracy of gene func-
tion annotation prediction.

Recent work incorporated large gene and protein interaction
networks into a probabilistic clustering procedure to reconstruct
the GO (Dutkowski et al., 2013). It identified new terms and
relations that were missing from GO based solely on network
topology. This work provides evidence that a large part of GO
can be reconstructed using only topologies of molecular
networks.

In this work, we propose a new data integration method for
prediction of GO term annotations of unannotated genes and
finding new relations between existing GO terms purely from
network topology. The method is based on penalized non-
negative matrix tri-factorization (PNMTF) for heterogeneous

data clustering (W ang et al., 2008, 2011). PNMTF has been used
for prediction of disease associations (Zitnik et al., 2013), iden-
tiﬁcation of cancer subtypes (Liu et al., 2014), predicting pro-
tein—protein interactions (PPIs) (W ang et al., 2013) and detecting
phenotype—gene associations (Hwang et al., 2012).

Here, we extend this method to take multiple types of molecu-
lar network data and use them to reconstruct and update G0
with new information. We apply our method to Saccharomyces
cerevisiae data used by Dutkowski et al. (2013): PPI network,
genetic interaction (GI) network, gene co-expression (Co-Ex)
network and integrated functional network known as YeastNet
(Lee et al., 2007).

Our method takes all data in a matrix form and performs
simultaneous clustering of genes and GO terms inducing new
associations between genes and GO terms and between GO
terms themselves. We extend the integration methodology to in-
clude similarity in wiring around non-interacting genes. We
measure this by distance graphlet degree vectors (GDVs)
(Przulj, 2007). Graphlets and graphlet-based measures have
bridged molecular network topology and biological function.
For instance, simple homogeneous clustering of proteins in a
PPI network based on the GDV similarity has revealed groups
of proteins with a common biological function (Milenkovic and
Przulj, 2008; Milenkovic et al., 2010).

Therefore, we add these to incorporate more topology into the
integration process and improve accuracy of predictions. Using
various measures for assessing the quality of our prediction, we
systematically examined the contribution of these additional
topological constraints to GO prediction. Graphlet-based simi-
larity has not been exploited in any of the previous network
integration approaches.

Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that our method can successfully recon-
struct almost the entire GO by using solely topology of molecu-
lar interaction networks. Furthermore, we predict new GO term
associations and gene annotations from integrated topologies of
molecular interaction network and validate our predictions.

2 METHODS

2.1 Matrix tri-factorization for data integration

We use a co-clustering algorithm based on PNM T F to integrate multi-
type biological data. The clustering analysis is used to infer new relations
between data objects that were not previously present in the data. Such a
technique makes use of all available information presented in the network
form, including both inter-type relations and intra-type constraints (Ding
et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2008). This algorithm aims to simultaneously
cluster data using the interrelatedness between data types under the guid-
ance of some prior knowledge given in the form of intra-type pairwise
constraints. These constraints often indicate similarity or dissimilarity
relationships between data objects of the same type. Constraints guide
the clustering procedure so that similar objects can belong to the same
cluster while dissimilar cannot.

The simplest co-clustering problem involves only two types of objects
(eg. genes and GO terms) with size n1 and n2. If there are n1 objects of the
ﬁrst type and n2 objects of the second type, then we have an inter-type
relationship matrix R12 6 [Rme with an entry R12(i, j) representing the
relationship between i—th data point in the ﬁrst dataset and the j—th data
point in the second dataset. Simultaneous clustering of these datasets can
be seen as a solution of the non-negative matrix tri-factorization (NMTF)
problem where a given relation matrix, R12 6 [Rme can be

approximated as the product of three low-rank matrix factors:
R12 % G1S12G2T,

where non-negative G1 6 [R11 Xkl and G2 6 [R12sz correspond to the clus-
ter indicator matrix of the ﬁrst and the second dataset, and 812 e [Rk1Xk2
corresponds to compressed low-dimensional version of the initial relation
matrix. Rank factors, k1 and k2, are often chosen to be much smaller than
the corresponding matrix dimensions (k1 << n1, k2 << 112). NMTF algo-
rithm minimizes the following objective function:

' J: R —GS GT2 1
Glglfgzzo || 12 1 12 2|| ()

This objective function can be further used to incorporate intra—type
constraints whose violation causes penalties. Constraints that relate data
points, i and j, in two different datasets are represented via two constraint
matrices, @1 e [Rme and @2 e anxnz. Entries of the constraint matrix
are positive for dissimilar data objects because they impose penalties on
the current approximation given in the Equation (1). Entries of the con-
straint matrix are negative for similar objects because they are rewords
that reduce the objective function. Therefore, the constraint matrices can
be included as additional penalty terms in the objective function in the
following way:

min J: H R12 — G1S12G2T||2
G120,G220 (2)

+ tr(G1T®1G1)+ tr(G2T®2G2)

where tr denotes the trace of a matrix. This optimization problem is
known as PNM T F problem. Its solution produces two matrix factors,
G1 and G2, that can be interpreted as the cluster indicator matrices for
the ﬁrst and the second dataset. Speciﬁcally, factor G1 is used to assign
data objects from the ﬁrst dataset to clusters so that data object j is placed
in the cluster i if G1(i, j) is the largest entry in column j (Brunet et al.,
2004). This assignment procedure results in a binary connectivity matrix,
C, of size n1 X n1 with entry C(p, q)= 1 if objects p and q belong to the
same cluster and C(p, q) = 0 otherwise. Hence, an integration of all data
sources is achieved by clustering the ﬁrst and the second datasets simul-
taneously using R12, @1 and @2 that encode the data.

Biological entities, such as genes and proteins engage in various mo-
lecular interactions, or are connected through GO relationships. We rep-
resent these as networks and integrate their network topology (also called
structure) in the form of constraints of the objective function. These
constraints are implemented into the objective function in the form of
network Laplacians (Hwang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011). That is, we
are now minimizing:

min J: H R12 — G1S12G2T||2
Glzoczzo (3)

+ tr(G1T£1G1)+ tr(G2T£2G2)

where 5,, = D0, — A0, represents network Laplacian of the molecular net-
work of the at data type; A0, is the network adjacency matrix, and D0, is
the diagonal degree matrix with entries being row summation of the
matrix A0,: Do,(i, i) = Z]. Ao,(i, j). These additional, Laplacian-based
terms encourage the connected or ontology-related genes (proteins) in
the network to be assigned to the same cluster. To integrate the network
data and predict GO term relationships from network topology, along
with new gene annotations, the term tr(G1T£1G1) imposes that interacting
genes get placed into the same cluster and similarly tr(G2T£2G2) imposes
that linked GO terms get placed into the same cluster.

2.2 Integration of various constraints on the same objects

Most of the biological datasets include various types of interactions (i.e.
constraints) over the same set of entities. For instance, genes might inter-
act via GIs, and they also might be related based on the correlation of

their expression proﬁles. The former is known as a GI network, and the
latter as a gene Co-Ex network. To properly integrate this information
into the clustering procedure, we make an improvement to the regularized
PNMTF optimization problem. We extend it to take into account mul-
tiple constraints over the objects of the same type. Suppose we have a set
of N adjacency matrices: {AL A? . . . , A11V }, representing N data sources
relating objects of the ﬁrst type. By adding these constraints in the
Laplacian form as penalty terms into our objective function (3), we end
up with the following:
min J: H R12 — G1512G2T||2
G120,G220
N (4)
+ Ztr(G1T£’13G1)+tr(G2T£2G2)
5:1

Integration of all available information about a particular data type
has demonstrated to lead better predictions of new relations among data
objects. For example, the integration of all available human molecular
networks yields a successful reproduction of the existing and prediction of
new associations between diseases (Zitnik et al., 2013).

Unlike previous works where only network connections are considered
as constraints (Hwang et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013;
Zhang et al., 2011; Zitnik et al., 2013), our approach takes a step further
by incorporating additional constraints in the form of topological simi-
larity between nodes in a network that are not necessarily linked. Here,
we use the topological similarity measure based on GD Vs. Graphlets are
small non-isomorphic-induced substructures of a large network (Przulj
et al., 2004). There are 29 graphlets containing 2—5 nodes. By taking into
account the symmetries between nodes in a graphlet, we can distinguish
between 73 automorphic orbits. Counting how many times a particular
node touches any of 73 different orbits, we may deﬁne a 73-dimensional
GDV (see Supplementary Fig. S1). For node u, i—th coordinate of
its GDV vector, u,-, denotes the number of times node u touches orbit i.
GDV vector represents local structural properties of a node, and there-
fore, it can be used to compare topologies around nodes in a network.
For that purpose, a measure of distance between nodes u and v is intro-
duced as (Milenkovic and Przulj, 2008):

2:. Dim v)
T
21:1 Wi

where D,-(u, v) is deﬁned as a logarithmic distance between nodes’ i—th
orbits:

D(u, v) = , (5)

|log (u,- + 1) — log (v,+ 1)|
log (max{u,-, vi} +2)

 

D,-(u, v) = w,- X

To take into account mutual dependencies between orbits, a weight
w,=l —  is assigned to each orbit i e {0, ...,72}. The weight, w,,
measures to which extent orbit i is affected by other orbits. Higher
weights are assigned to orbits that are less affected by other orbits,
whereas lower weights are assigned to orbits that are affected by many
other orbits. The number of orbits that affect orbit i is given by 0,.

Using the distance measure deﬁned in Equation (5), GDV similarity
between nodes u and v is measured as

S(u, V): l — D(u, v)

 

GDV similarity measure has been used for predicting biological func-
tion of unclassiﬁed proteins (Milenkovic and Przulj, 2008), classiﬁcation
of cancer and non-cancer genes (Milenkovic et al., 2010) and prediction
of new cardiovascular disease genes (Sarajlic et al., 2013).

Here, we include GDV similarity measure into our objective function
[Equation (4)] as followings. For each of the given data source ,8 (i.e.
biological network), we construct a similarity matrix S ,3 6 RM". Then, by
computing a statistically signiﬁcant threshold for topological similarity of
two nodes in each of the GDV similarity matrices, we consider only data

objects (genes/proteins) with GDV similarity higher than the computed
threshold (see Supplementary Fig. S2):

1, ifs/3(2), v) 2 S/lshreshold
EM”, V) Z ' zh hold
02 It‘s/304, v)<S/3res

Topological similarity constraints are again implemented into the
objective function through Laplacian regularization:
min J: H R12 — G1S12G2T||2
G120,G220
N N (6)
+ er(G,chG1) + Ztr(G1TA’13G1)+tr(G2T£2G2)
,3=1 ,3=1

where, A=D —Z is a Laplacian of 2 matrix, and D is the diagonal
matrix with entries equal to the row summation of 2 matrix.

2.3 Multiplicative update algorithm

We extend the original PNMTF algorithm (Wang et al., 2008) to handle
the additional penalty terms and network regularizations in Equation (6).
Solving the optimization problem results in the following multiplicative
update rules for matrix factors G1, G2 and $12 (Wang et al., 2008):

512 e (G? G1)—1G1TR12G2(G2T G2)_1 (7)

(9)

where we use + and — signs in superscripts to denote non-negative matrices
M+ and M‘ of a matrix M, respectively, deﬁned as MJr = w and
M‘ =  The algorithm starts by randomly initializing matrices G1
and G2, which are iteratively updated to minimize objective function in
Equation (6). The rigorous proof of the correctness and convergence of
these update rules can be found in (Wang et al., 2008). Under these
update rules, the objective function J [Equation (6)] is guaranteed not to
increase. Hence, we look at the change in the objective function between two
consecutive iterations and deﬁne the stopping criterion as lJn — Jn_1| <6.
In all our runs, parameter 6 is set to 10—5, which was shown to be
signiﬁcant to minimize the objective function. Compared with the probabil-
istic clustering approach for GO reconstruction presented by Dutkowski
et al. (2013), our approach is computationally more demanding because of
slow convergence of multiplicative update rules. However, our approach is
more general, as it can integrate any number and type of heterogeneous data
that could lead to more accurate predictions.

2.4 Predicting associations between GO terms

Each factorization run produces matrix factors: G1 related to gene set,
and G2 related to GO terms. We use G2 factor to construct connectivity
matrix C as described in the Section 2.1. Clusters of mutually related GO
terms are obtained from the connectivity matrix. To assess reliability and
robustness of GO term associations prediction, we use the stochastic
property of our algorithm. We perform multiple runs with the same
rank parameters and different initial random initializations and construct
a set of 20 different connectivity matrices: {C(l), ...,C(20)}. Then, we

compute the consensus matrix, C, deﬁned as the average over all

connectivity matrices. Thereby entries in the consensus matrix range from
0 to 1, and they can be interpreted as probabilities that two GO terms,
G0,- and G0], belong to the same cluster. To predict new GO term
associations, we are only interested in values of probability equal
to one because they correspond to the case of hard clustering, in
which there is no overlap between clusters, and hence, there is no
ambiguity in predicted GO term associations. The complete
algorithm for prediction of new GO term association is summarized in
Algorithm 1.

Extract new GO term relations:

To assess the statistical signiﬁcance of GO term associations, we com-
pute the P-value in the following way. First, we remove any prior know-
ledge on GO term relations (i.e. we remove matrix £2). Then, we run our
algorithm 100 times, each time with different relations matrix obtained by
perrnuting the entries of the original relations matrix, R12. In total, we
obtain 100 X 20=2000 different connectivity matrices. We deﬁne the
P-value of a particular GO term association as the fraction of connect-
ivity matrices in which that particular association is observed.

 

2.5 Rank parameters selection

Input parameters of our algorithm are factorization ranks, k1 and k2,
which we systematically examine and choose to achieve a correct reduc-
tion of dimensionality of our data. These factorization ranks capture the
meaningful information that can further be decomposed into clusters.

There is no agreed-upon procedure for choosing the right factorization
ranks. The most common approach, widely used in many dimension
reduction problems is cophenetic correlation coefﬁcient, as a quantitative
measure of stability for clustering (Brunet et al., 2004). For a given fac-
torization rank, cophenetic correlation coefﬁcient is computed over the
values of the consensus matrix, ,0(C). It is deﬁned as the Pearson’s cor-
relation coefﬁcient between the distance matrix, 1 — C, and the matrix of
cophenetic distances obtained by the linkage used in hierarchical cluster-
ing for re-ordering C. If the clustering is stable, i.e. the entries in C are
close to 0 or 1, then ,0(C) % 1, otherwise, if the entries are scattered
between 0 and 1, ,0(C)< 1.

A simple generalization of this procedure applied to two types of our
data (genes and GO terms) includes computation of cophenetic correl-
ation coefﬁcient for each of the consensus matrices, Cg (for genes), CGO
(for GO terms), and then we deﬁne the average cophenetic correlation
coefﬁcient as

 (,0,

We search for the values of, k1 and k2, that maximize pavg. We do this
by running our algorithm for all (k1, k2) pairs such that 0 < k1, k2 < 60, so
that we would capture the best dimensionality of our data (see below).

2.6 Datasets and preprocessing

To make our study directly comparable with the competing method for
reconstructing GO from network data, we run our method on the same
S.cerevisiae data as Dutkowski et al. (2013): PPI network from BioGRID
(Chatr-Aryamontri et al., 2013), G1 network from DRYGIN (Costanzo
et al., 2010), gene Co-Ex network from SMD (Hubble et al., 2009) and
integrated function network, YeastNet, from (Lee et al., 2007). For each
of the these networks, we construct Laplacian constraint matrices,
{51, 5:, 5%, £21}, respectively.

To apply multiplicative update rules, we make all data matrices of the
same dimension: we construct them over the union of genes presented in
all four data sources. The semantic structure of G0 is also taken into
account in our integration algorithm. We extract all GO terms for
S.cerevisiae and create £2 constraint matrix as follows. First, we construct
a directed acyclic ontology graph using the four basic semantic types of
GO relations: is_a, part_of, regulates and has_part. Then, we assign value
0.91 to each pair of GO terms as a measure of association strength, where
l is the length of directed shortest path between terms in the ontology
graph. This allows us to also take into account mutual inﬂuence of hier-
archically distant non-adjacent GO terms (Zhu et al., 2005). The value of
0.9 is chosen from empirical observations, as described by Zitnik et al.
(2013). Finally, we construct the Laplacian constraint matrix, £2, by
using these values of association strengths.

Annotation ﬁles from G0 are used to construct the binary relation
matrix, R12, with entries R12(i, j) = 1 if gene i is annotated by GO term j
and 0 otherwise. For each of the aforementioned biological networks, we
also compute GDV similarity constraint matrices: {5L 5:, 5%, 5,1}. As we
describe in Section 2.2, we only consider gene pairs with statistically sig-
niﬁcant GDV similarity. All these network data are schematically repre-
sented in Figure 1.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We apply our algorithm to identify new GO term relations and
annotate proteins with existing GO terms by integrating multiple
independent network sources given in the Table 1. We ﬁnd that
the optimal rank parameters k1 and k2 are 58 and 56, respectively

(see Supplementary Fig. S3). We examine the contribution of
each data source to the integration model.

3.1 Contribution of data to the integration model

We estimate the influence of each network on our integration
model by comparing the quality of the initial model (consisting
of four networks and their corresponding GDV similarity matri-
ces) with the quality of the model with one data source removed
from the initial set. Models are evaluated through residual sum
0f Squares (RSS): RSS(R12) = 2011812037) — (G1512G2T)(iif)]2i
and explained variance (Evar), Evar(R12) = 1 — RSS(R12)/
ZU[R12(i,j)]2, that measure the performance of the matrix fac-
torization algorithm and its ability to accurately reproduce the
gene—GO term relation matrix. Low values of RSS and high
values of Evar indicate better quality of the model (Hutchins
et al., 2008).

We ﬁnd that with the removal of each of the four data sources
(a network along with its corresponding GDV similarity matrix)
the value of RSS increases, while the value of Evar decreases,
implying that each data source contributes to the quality of the
model. Relative increase of RSS and relative decrease of Evar
(with respect to the initial model containing all the data), com-
puted by removing a particular network along with its corres-
ponding GDV similarity matrix, are shown in the top panel of
Figure 2. We ﬁnd that the largest model degradation is achieved
with the removal of GI network and its corresponding GDV
similarity matrix. A similar result was reported by Zitnik et al.
(2013): they found GIs to be the most informative data source in
prediction of disease—disease associations. Exclusion of the gene
Co-Ex network and its corresponding GDV similarity matrix

results in the smallest changes in RSS and Evar indicating that
Co-Ex data contribute the least to the quality of the model.

To examine the contribution of GDV similarities to our
model, we conduct the same experiment by removing only the
GDV similarity matrix of each of the biological networks from
the initial dataset. The results are shown in the bottom panel of
Figure 2.

We see that GDV similarities contribute to the quality of the
models. The smallest contribution to the model, a relative in-
crease of 0.32% in RSS, is that of the gene Co-Ex network.
Also, we examine contributions of all pairs of the four networks.
We conﬁrm the observation of Dutkowski et al. (2013) that a
combination of YeastNet and Co-Ex network contributes the
least to the quality of the model (RSS=0.8 %, Evar: 1%).

3.2 Recovering existing knowledge

Our integration of the biological networks and their correspond-
ing GDV similarities results in a set of highly reliable GO term
classes, represented as clusters in a block diagonal form of the
consensus matrix. Size distribution of these clusters and the con-
sensus matrix are shown in the Supplementary Figure S4. In add-
ition to this experiment, we also perform the same analysis on the
data consisting only of biological networks (excluding GDV simi-
larities from our integration procedure). This allows us to com-
pare the clustering results of different integration models and to
estimate the importance of additional topological constraints.
To evaluate the performance of our methodology in reprodu-
cing GO term relations, we look at the overlap between cluster
members and the existing GO hierarchy and ﬁnd that on average
92% of cluster members are directly connected via semantic re-
lations in GO. These cluster-induced GO term relations are con-
ﬁrmed to be statistically signiﬁcant (P g 0.01, computed as
explained in Section 2.4). A slightly lower score of 90% is

achieved when considering only the network data without GDV
similarity matrices, indicating that graphlet similarity matrices
contribute to capturing relations, which would otherwise be
missed.

Furthermore, we examine the robustness of this result to the
removal of particular datasets. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that omis-
sion of GDV similarity matrix of gene Co-Ex network con-
tributes the most to the predictive performance of our
algorithm, leading to the maximum of 96% of recovered
GO terms. Hence, inclusion of GDV similarity of gene Co-
Ex network introduces noise into the integration procedure,
wrongly guiding the clustering process, which in turn results
in lower prediction performance. This is a consequence of the
random GDV similarity distribution over all genes in the gene
Co-Ex network (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Given that inclu-
sion of GDV similarity matrix of the Co-Ex network impairs
the predictive performance of our algorithm and because we
have shown that its exclusion makes minimal effect on the
quality of the model, we discard that data source from further
analysis.

Surprisingly, recovering 96% of GO terms that are directly
related in GO (this is not a percentage of recovered relations
between GO terms) by is_a, part_of, regulates and has _part as-
sociations, indicates that entire GO could, in principle, be recon-
structed solely from topologies of molecular interaction
networks. Reporting this statistic is consistent with what previ-
ous studies using a similar methodology reported (Zitnik et al.,
2013). When we say that ‘96% of GO terms is recovered’, we
mean that our methodology correctly identiﬁes a set of 96% of
GO terms that contain relations between them. This does not
mean that this set is fully connected (i.e. that each pair of GO
terms in it is related). Our set of 96% of GO terms contains 78%
of all relations currently present in GO. To our knowledge, be-
cause a large part of GO is sequence derived, this is the ﬁrst
conformation that network topology and sequence carry similar
biological information.

To further validate the performance of our methodology in
reconstruction of GO terms, we use the gene—GO term relation
matrix, reconstructed from matrix factors R12=G1S12G2T. Its
entries indicate the annotation strength of a gene, i, related to
a GO term j, with R12(i, j) =0 denoting absence of annotation,
while R12(i, j) = 1 denoting the highest conﬁdence of annotation.
We deﬁne GO term f as a candidate to annotate gene i if the
association score R12(i, f) is larger that the mean of association
scores over all known annotations of gene i. To identify only
high conﬁdence gene-GO term predictions, we pick j* that are
in the top 5% of largest association scores between GO term f
and all other genes. As before, we run our algorithm with and
without GDV similarities (we exclude GDV similarities of Co-Ex
network for reasons presented above).

We compute the percentage of reproduced, high conﬁdence
GO terms for CC, BP and MF separately. The results are
shown in Figure 3a. Better results are achieved when GDV simi-
larity matrices are included in the prediction model. Speciﬁcally,
we capture 41 % of BP terms, 41% of MF terms and 48% of CC
terms. The BF and MF results outperform those of Dutkowski
et al. (2013), whereas they achieve a higher percentage of repro-
duced GO terms in CC.

3.3 Validating predictions

Among all the statistically signiﬁcant (P g 0.01) GO term asso-
ciation predictions, we ﬁnd 132 not presented in GO (see
Supplementary Table S1). To further increase conﬁdence, we
extract these associations from clusters with fewer than three
GO terms that are stable over multiple factorization runs. We
ﬁnd that 14 of the 132 associations are between GO terms that
have high semantic similarity and also conﬁrm that additional 31
associations agree with predictions of Dutkowski et al. (2013).
For example, our approach predicts term GO:0035267 (NuA4
histone acetyltransferase complex) as a parent of GO:0032777
(Piccolo NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex), which was
also reported by Dutkowski et al. (2013) and submitted to the
GO Consortium for inclusion into the ontology. We further per-
form literature curation to validate the remaining predicted GO
associations. We ﬁnd literature support for another 13 of them
(Supplementary Table S1). Hence, we validate 58 of 132 of our
predictions.

Our approach not only identiﬁes novel GO term association
but it also makes highly reliable predictions for new gene—GO
term relations. We predict new functional annotation of 972
genes (see Supplementary Table S2). Highly reliable predictions
are those with association strength in the top 5%, as described in
Section 3.2. For instance, we predict three genes, YDR101C,
YDR49C and YNL132W, to be involved in ribosomal subunit
biogenesis (GO:0042273) and ﬁnd that the same functional pre-
diction was previously reported through different approaches by
Chen and Xu (2004) and J oshi et al. (2004). To validate the 972
predicted annotations, we use the new unpublished full set of
yeast’s GI proﬁles from Boone Lab (Boone, 2014). The data
consist of Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients of genetic proﬁles
between gene pairs. We create the distribution of these correl-
ations between newly annotated gene pairs for which we predict
GO annotations. We compare this distribution of genetic proﬁle
correlations between the same number randomly sampled pairs
of genes (we sampled multiple times and got consistent results).
We observe higher correlations for predicted gene pairs than for
random pairs (Fig. 3b). Moreover, using two-sample
Kolmogorov—Smirnov (KS) test, we show that these two distribu-
tions signiﬁcantly differ (KS statistics, D = 0.2 and P—value,
P: 1.5 X 10—6). Thus, these results are highly consistent with
our predictions of new annotations. This validates our predicted

GO annotations. Even though GI proﬁling analysis provides
evidence that our algorithm is able to successfully predict new
gene functions, additional biological validation would be needed
for better understanding of these newly assigned functions.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We introduce a method for reconstruction of GO that is based
on integrating solely the topology of biological networks. It cap-
tures 96% of the existing GO term relations and is capable of
successfully identifying additional GO term associations as well
as predicting gene annotations. Our method is general in the
sense that it can integrate any heterogeneous systems-level inter-
action data. Therefore, it can easily be extended with new data
that could consequently enhance the model’s predictive perform-
ance. This work suggests that the entire GO could be recon-
structed from molecular interaction networks.

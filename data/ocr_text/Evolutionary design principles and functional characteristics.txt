ABSTRACT

Background: Network motifs within biological networks show
non-random abundances in systems at different scales. Large
directed protein networks at the cellular level are now well defined
in several diverse species. We aimed to compare the nature of
significantly observed two- and three-node network motifs across
three different kingdoms (Arabidopsis thaliana for multicellular plants,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae for unicellular fungi and Homo sapiens for
animals).

Results: ‘Two-node feedback’ is the most significant motif in all
three species. By considering the sign of each two-node feedback
interaction, we examined the enrichment of the three types of two-
node feedbacks [positive—positive (PP), negative—negative (NN) and
positive—negative (PN)]. We found that PN is enriched in the network
of A.thaliana, NN in the network of S.cerevisiae and PP and NN in the
network of H.sapiens. Each feed back type has characteristic features
of robustness, multistability and homeostasis.

Conclusions: We suggest that amplification of particular network
motifs emerges from contrasting dynamical and topological
properties of the motifs, reflects the evolutionary design principles
selected by the characteristic behavior of each species and provides
a signature pointing to their behavior and function.

1 INTRODUCTION

Systems biology involves the study of complex interactions between
components of a biological system. The study of network motifs
(Alon, 2007) within larger networks can help to unravel the functions
of complex biological networks (Milo et al., 2002, 2004). In
biology, network motifs—subgraphs that recur within a network
much more often than expected in random networks—include
negative autoregulation, positive autoregulation, feedforward loops,
single—input modules, dense overlapping regulons and feedback
loops (Alon, 2007). These network motifs are known to have

different dynamical functions, and distinct subsets have been found
to predominate in various biological networks such as transcription,
signal transduction, protein interaction and neuronal networks, or
even larger scale ecosystem—wide networks. Most of the previous
studies on network motifs (Conant and Wagner, 2003; Prill et al.,
2005; Wuchty et al., 2003; Yeger—Lotem et al., 2004) were, however,
limited to the networks with no interaction sign (activation or
inhibition) although such interaction sign is indispensable for
characterizing various dynamical properties. Now that networks
involving a substantial proportion of all the signed directed protein
networks (SDPNs) within cells are available for organisms from
the animal, plant and fungal kingdoms, we can compare the
network motifs and ask whether there are characteristics which
may be kingdom speciﬁc, and allow us to unravel evolutionary
design principles. In this article, we examine the enrichment of
particular network motifs in the Arabidopsis thaliana (multicellular
plant), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (unicellular fungus) and Homo
sapiens (multicellular animal). We suggest biological implications
for the sets of network motifs in each species that arise from their
characteristic dynamical and topological features.

2 METHODS

2.1 Construction of directed protein networks

The network data were retrieved from all available manually curated
databases using Pathway Studio 6 (Nikitin er al., 2003). This
software provides ﬁve biological network databases (ResNet Mammalian
Database 6.0, ResNet Plant Database 2.0, Yeast—3, Drosophila—3 and
C—elegans—3). Each database contains eight types of nodes (Small
Molecule, Functional Class, Complex, Protein, Cell Process, Cell Object,
Treatment and Disease) and eight types of links (Expression, Regulation,
MolTransport, ProtModiﬁcation, Binding, PromoterBinding, MolSynthesis
and DirectRegulation). In order to obtain reliable directed protein interaction
data, we retrieved only the referenced links comprised of ‘Protein’ nodes
and ﬁve types of interaction (Regulation, MolTransport, ProtModiﬁcation,
MolSynthesis and DirectRegulation).

2.2 Identiﬁcation of network motifs

In order to identify network motifs using mﬁnder (Kashtan er al., 2004;
Milo er al., 2002), 1000 random networks were generated by the switching
method that switches between edges while preserving the degree distribution
of the nodes in the original network—in—degree, out—degree and mutual
degree are preserved for each node. The number of switches was a random
number in the range of 100—200 times the total number of edges in the
network. Network motifs with P<0.01 was considered as statistically
signiﬁcant.

2.3 Enrichment analysis for two-node feedbacks and
their couplings

In each directed protein network, the enrichment of positive—positive (PP),
negative—negative (NN) and positive—negative (PN) was examined by
performing one—sample one—sided z—tests for empirical binomial distributions
of PP, NN and PN. The empirical binomial distributions were constructed by
randomizing 10 000 networks while preserving the numbers of positive links,
negative links and two—node feedbacks. The enrichment of the six types of
couplings (PP—PP, NN—NN, PN—PN, PP—NN, NN—PN and PN—PP) were also
examined in a similar way where the empirical binomial distributions were
constructed by randomizing 10 000 networks while preserving the numbers
of PP, NN and PN.

2.4 Tissue-speciﬁc and tissue-general subnetworks for
H.sapiens

Human tissue—speciﬁc and tissue—general subnetworks were extracted by
reﬂecting the mRNA expression data in 79 human tissues (Su et 01.,
2004). We ﬁrst identiﬁed upper outliers for each tissue, whose mRNA
expressions were higher than the sum of the upper quartile and 1.5 times the
interquartile range (Rosner, 2000). Here, we assumed that protein abundances
are proportional to their corresponding mRNA expressions. Then, a tissue—
speciﬁc and a tissue—general protein sets were deﬁned as the upper outliers
that were only expressed in ‘less than k (0 to k — 1)’ and ‘at least k (k to 79)’
tissues, respectively. Here, k was varied from 1 to 10, and hence 10 tissue—
speciﬁc and 10 tissue— general subnetworks were generated in total. Finally, a
tissue—speciﬁc subnetwork (a tissue— general subnetwork) was constructed by
extracting the protein nodes in a tissue—speciﬁc protein set (a tissue—general
protein set) and their interactions from the SDPN of H.sapiens. For the
comparison, 10 random subnetworks were also constructed by randomly
extracting the same number of nodes with each tissue—speciﬁc/general
subnetworks; hence, 200 random subnetworks were generated in total.

2.5 Average distance from a node to transcription
factors or receptors

In the SDPNs of S.cerevisiae and H.sapiens, transcription factors
(TFs) and receptors were selected as the nodes whose corresponding
genes are classiﬁed into the Gene Ontology (GO) term ‘regulation
of transcription (GO:0045449)’ and ‘receptor activity (GO:0004872)’,
respectively. According to this criterion, there are 503 TFs and 13 receptors
for S.cerevisiae and 1894 TFs and 1354 receptors for H.sapiens. Then, the
average distance from a node to TFs (ADTF) was deﬁned as the average of
the shortest paths from the node to all reachable downstream TFs. Similarly,
the average distance from a node to receptors (ADR) was deﬁned as the
average of the shortest paths from the node to all reachable upstream
receptors.

2.6 Degree-free sampling

The degree of a node is a confounding factor in comparison of the topological
features of PP and NN—ADTF and ADR are inversely proportional to the
degree of a node in a network. In order to standardize the topological features,
we considered four degree intervals ([1, 5], [6, 10], [11, 20] and >20) for
S.cerevisiae and seven degree intervals ([1, 5], [6, 10], [11, 20], [21, 30], [31,
50], [51, 100] and >100) for H.sapiens. In each mutually exclusive set of
PP and NN, 100 nodes with degrees in each degree interval were randomly
sampled with replacement; hence, 400 and 700 nodes were sampled for
S.cerevisiae and H.sapiens, respectively. Then, we compared the average
of each topological feature of PP with that of NN, and this procedure was
repeated for 100 times.

2.7 GO analysis for two-node positive feedbacks

GO analysis enables us to determine which GO categories are statistically
overrepresented in a set of genes or a subgraph of a biological network.

In order to differentiate biological functions between the two—node positive
feedbacks (PP and NN), we performed GO analysis by utilizing BiNGO
2.31 (Maere et al., 2005), which is implemented as a plugin for Cytoscape
(Shannon et al., 2003). Since we were interested in general functional
proﬁling, a slimmed—down version of the whole GO (i.e. GOSlim_GOA)
was used for the analysis. Each mutually exclusive set of PP and NN
was tested against its corresponding SDPN, and hypergeometric tests were
performed for statistical analysis. P—values were corrected with Benjamini
and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) and the signiﬁcance level
was set to 0.05.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Two-node feedback is the most signiﬁcant network
motif in the three different species

In constructing the biological networks of the three kingdoms
(represented by A.thalicma, S.cerevisiae and H.sapiens), we
retrieved directed protein interactions from all available databases
(see Section 2.1; Fig. 1A). Directed protein interaction data for
other model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and
Caenorhabditis elegans also exist, but the network sizes are
smaller, with many unknown interactions or more intensive study of
particular pathways, and therefore are not sufﬁcient for comparison
with the three selected organisms (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
Based on the networks, we performed network motif analysis (see
Section 2.2). Signiﬁcantly observed (P < 0.01) two— and three—node
motifs are depicted as bold and colored structures in Figure 1B. The
two—node feedback was the most signiﬁcant network motif in all of
the examined species (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Table 2). Notably,
the number of signiﬁcantly observed network motifs decreased for
H. sapiens.

3.2 Two-node feedback motifs show enrichment
characteristic of species: PN in A.thaliana, NN in
S.cerevisiae and PP + NN in H.sapiens

To unravel the dynamical functions of two—node feedbacks, we
examined the enrichment of three types of two—node feedbacks
(PP, NN and PN) in each SDPN (Fig. 2A) where only signed
interactions are extracted from the corresponding directed protein
network (Fig. 1A). The Z—scores in Figure 2B (see Section 2.3;
Supplementary Table 3) show that PN was enriched (Z—score > 0)
only in A.thaliana, while in S.cerevisiae NN was signiﬁcantly
(P <0.01) enriched and in H.sapiens both PP and NN were
signiﬁcantly enriched. To examine whether this enrichment
characteristic depends on the particular network reconstruction
method or the (possibly) incomplete network information we
employed, randomly subsampled networks for each species were
further investigated. As a result, we conﬁrmed that the enrichment
results are not biased by such a network reconstruction method
or incomplete network information (see ‘Enrichment of two—node
feedbacks in the sub—sampled networks’ in Supplementary Material
and Supplementary Fig. 1).

Why is PN enriched only in A.thalicma? Negative feedback
is important in homeostasis and robustness to perturbation
(Brandman and Meyer, 2008; Brandman et al., 2007). Consistently,
as we removed the protein nodes classiﬁed into the G0
(The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2006) term ‘homeostatic
process (GO:0042592)’, PN was no longer enriched (Z—score < 0;

Supplementary Table 4). PN enrichment was also found in the SDPN
of rice, Oryza sativa (Supplementary Table 3). Moreover, some
types of three- and four-node negative feedbacks (PPN, NNN and
PPPN) were also enriched in A.thaliana although only PPPN was
enriched in case of 0.sativa (Supplementary Table 5). The contrast
with fungi and animals suggests that negative feedback leading to
robust homeostasis is selected in plants.

Like H.sapiens, two other multicellular animals (Mus musculus
and Rattus norvegicus) also exhibited the signiﬁcant enrichment of
PP and NN (Supplementary Table 3). Species-speciﬁc differential
enrichment of PP and NN suggests that the characteristics of each
species might have emerged from different dynamical functions of
PP and NN. Positive feedbacks are widespread in developmental
processes as a result of their dynamical functions of hysteresis and
multistationarity (Kim et al., 2008a): PP drives the developmental
system towards a monostable regime (Chickarmane et al., 2006;
Legewie et al., 2006), while NN leads to a bi- or multistable
regime in development (Hwang et al., 2005; McClean et al.,
2007), outcomes that have been notated as progression and decision
switches (Guantes and Poyatos, 2008). Might alternative controls be
favored in a single-cell organism such as S. cerevisiae where rapid

changes in cell environment are encountered and most cells remain
totipotent? Decision switches might be utilized in multipotent
regimes in developmental processes. In contrast, a multicellular
animal such as H. sapiens has many types of terminally differentiated
cells in progressive differentiation processes, each protected from
the environment. Hence, it might undergo developmental processes
not only through decision switches but also through progression
switches. Arguably, NN might act as a decision switch for bi- or
multistable differentiation (e. g. from a stem cell to a pluripotent
progenitor cell, from a pluripotent progenitor cell to a unipotent
progenitor cell), whereas PP could act as a progression switch for
monostable differentiation (e. g. from a unipotent progenitor cell to
a terminally differentiated cell).

3.3 Coupling tendency of two-node feedbacks is
different for each species

Biological networks involve many interlinked feedbacks (Brandman

et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2007a, b, 2008b; Tsai et al., 2008), and

we aimed to examine how the three types of two-node feedbacks

are coupled in the species. Each SDPN (Fig. 2A) was converted

each node denotes one of the three types of two-node feedbacks
(PP: blue, NN: red, PN: green) and each link denotes a coupling,
or a node sharing between two two-node feedbacks (right box
of Fig. 2C). Statistical analysis in Figure 2E (see Section 2.3;
Supplementary Table 3) shows that PN—PP was relatively enriched
in the network of A.thaliana. Only homogeneous couplings (PP—PP,
NN—NN and PN—PN) were signiﬁcantly enriched in the network of
S.cerevisiae. In the case of H.sapiens, PP—PP, PN—PN and PN—PP
were signiﬁcantly enriched in the network. These ﬁndings and
the results from other species (Supplementary Table 3) suggest
the following three points: (i) homogeneous couplings are more
enriched in the networks of single-cell organisms (S. cerevisiae) and
multicellular animals (H.sapiens, M.musculus and R.n0rvegicus)
than heterogeneous couplings (PP—NN, NN—PN and PN—PP),
(ii) PP—PP is enriched in all the species, whereas PP—NN is not
enriched in any of the species and (iii) for heterogeneous couplings,
PN tends to be coupled with PP in the networks of multicellular

organisms, whereas PN tends to be coupled with NN in the networks
of single—cell organisms.

3.4 Dynamical features of two-node feedbacks

We noted above that species-speciﬁc differential enrichment of two—
node feedbacks could originate from their different functions. To
validate this, we investigated the dynamical features of PP, NN
and PN, ﬁrst by evolving artiﬁcial networks with a preference
for ‘multistationarity’ (Fig. 3A), ‘robustness of point attractor’
(Fig. 3B) or ‘robustness of cyclic attractor’ (Fig. 3C) using
Boolean network simulations (Kim et al., 2008a) (see ‘Network
evolution’ in Supplementary Material). The artiﬁcial evolution
toward ‘multistationarity’ increased the numbers of two-node
positive feedbacks while suppressing negative feedbacks (Fig. 3A
and D). We note that NN becomes more preferential than PP as the
number of nodes in artiﬁcial networks increases (Supplementary
Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 6). The preference of NN

over PP, although both are two—node positive feedbacks, might
be because PP—only couplings can incorporate only two ‘point
attractors’ whereas NN—only couplings can give rise to multiple
‘point attractors’ (Kim et al., 2008a). When artiﬁcial networks
were evolved to enhance ‘robustness of point attractor’, PN and
PP interactions were increased whereas NN was decreased (Fig. 3B
and E). In the case of ‘robustness of cyclic attractor’, only PN was
increased while suppressing positive feedbacks (Fig. 3C and F).

In summary, we found that NN is exploited only for
multistationarity, PP increases both multistationarity and robustness
of point attractor, and PN enhances robustness of attractors. These
results support our previous ﬁndings that PP can be employed
for a unipotent regime as a discreet decision maker, NN for a
multipotent regime for multistability—multistationarity is essential
for multistable differentiation (Laslo et al., 2006)—and PN for
robust homeostatic behavior.

3.5 Topological features of two-node positive feedbacks

From the different dynamical roles of two—node positive feedbacks
in developmental processes, we speculated that if PPs (NNs) are
exploited for unipotent (multipotent) regimes, genes comprising
PP (NN) structure would be expressed in speciﬁc (diverse)
conditions for single—cell organisms and in speciﬁc (diverse) tissues
for multicellular organisms. To test this idea, we compared the
responsiveness, deﬁned as the sum of squares of the logZ—ratios
measured from curated expression datasets under more than 1500
conditions (Choi and Kim, 2009; Tirosh et al., 2006), of PP versus
NN and PP—PP versus NN—NN in S.cerevisiae. We found that
NN and NN—NN show higher responsiveness to various conditions
than PP and PP—PP, respectively (Fig. 4A). This result implies

that in adaptation to rapidly changing environment, NNs are
exploited for totipotent regimes leading to different cell types in
S.cerevisiae. For H.sapiens, we examined the enrichment of PP
and NN in 10 tissue—speciﬁc (ﬁlled green circles in Fig. 4B) and
10 tissue—general subnetworks (ﬁlled blue triangles in Fig. 4B),
comparing with 10 random subnetworks for each (empty sky blue
circles for tissue—speciﬁc and empty orange triangles for tissue—
general subnetworks in Fig. 4B). As a result, the tissue—speciﬁc
(tissue— general) subnetworks showed higher enrichment for PP (NN)
than the random subnetworks, implying that PPs (NNs) are utilized
for unipotent (multipotent) regimes leading to fully differentiated
cells (various cell types) in H.sapiens.

In order to further understand the different biological aspects
of two—node positive feedbacks, we performed GO analysis
(see Section 2.7). According to the result shown in Table 1,
PPs (NNs) are involved in exogenous (endogenous) processes.
Exogenous processes are a means to cope with the cell environment
through receptor—mediated signal transduction, whereas endogenous
processes are employed for various cellular decisions by utilizing
transcriptional programs in the nucleus. In support of this, as shown
in Figure 4C, PPs were closer to the receptors, while NNs were
closer to the TFs in the SDPN of S.cerevisiae (see Section 2.5).
Moreover, PPs were relatively closer to the receptors than NNs
were, although both FPS and NNs were closer to the receptors than

TFs in H.sapiens (Fig. 4D). In multicellular animals, cells need to
communicate in order to act in concert with other cells, thereby
increasing the importance of exogenous processes such as cell—to—
cell communications as indicated by the increased proportion of PP
interactions in H.sapiens (Fig. 2B).

4 CONCLUSIONS

Network motifs have particular functional importance in various
biological networks, and our results show that different classes of
motif are enriched in different species from the three kingdoms. The
data are still limited because network topology is only available
for an adequate number of nodes in three species, and even
so there may be ascertainment biases because the networks do
not account for all cellular protein networks. However, for the
ﬁrst time we reveal species—speciﬁc network motif signatures that
implicate contrasting evolutionary driving forces. In summary,
(i) PN enrichment only in A.thaliana represents the importance of
homeostasis in plants, (ii) NN enrichment in S.cerevisiae indicates
the prevalence of multipotency in the developmental processes of
this unicellular fungus and (iii) PP and NN enrichment in H. sapiens
represents the progressive and often largely irreversible nature
of the developmental processes. As further data are collected, it
will be critical to contrast different abundance of network motifs
between kingdoms with unicellular and multicellular forms, and to
see whether the most abundant motifs are more similar in network
regions concerned with similar functions but without conserved
pathways, such as resistance to biotic or abiotic stresses. Network
motif analysis may provide a valuable numerical tool to represent
and compare large cellular protein networks between species, giving
a signature that is a pointer to their function, behavior and evolution.

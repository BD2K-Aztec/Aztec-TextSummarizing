Abstract

Summary: We present a new, extended version of the Protein Topology Graph Library web server.
The Protein Topology Graph Library describes the protein topology on the super—secondary struc—
ture level. It allows to compute and visualize protein ligand graphs and search for protein structural
motifs. The new server features additional information on ligand binding to secondary structure
elements, increased usability and an application programming interface (API) to retrieve data,

allowing for an automated analysis of protein topology.

Availability and implementation: The Protein Topology Graph Library server is freely available on
the web at http://ptgl.uni—frankfurt.de. The website is implemented in PHP, JavaScript, PostgreSQL
and Apache. It is supported by all major browsers. The VPLG software that was used to compute the
protein ligand graphs and all other data in the database is available under the GNU public license 2.0

from http://vplg.sourceforge.net.

1 Introduction

The huge amount of three—dimensional (3D) protein structures avail—
able in databases like the PDB (Berman et al., 2000) call for tools for
automated analysis and intuitive visualization of protein structures.
Databases such as SCOP (Andreeva et al., 2008) and CATH (Sillitoe
et al., 2012) classify global protein topology based on semi—automated
methods and expert knowledge. Some automated methods such as
FSSP (Holm and Sander, 1997) rely on global 3D alignments and pair-
wise comparison. 3D Complex (Levy et al., 2006) focuses on protein
complexes. ProSMoS (Shi et al., 2007), TOPS (Michalopoulos et al.,
2004), TOPS—l— (Veeramalai and Gilbert, 2008), Pro—Origami (Stivala
et al., 2011) and the Protein Topology Graph Library (PTGL, May at
al., 2010) all work on the super—secondary structure level and apply
different methods to find substructures. Ligand information is of great
interest to determine protein function and in drug discovery, but most

databases ignore information on ligand binding to secondary structure
elements (SSEs).

The PTGL (Koch et al., 2013; May et al., 2004) is a database
that uses a graph model to describe proteins on the chain level. The
graphs are based on 3D atom data from the PDB and the SSE assign—
ments of the DSSP algorithm (Kabsch and Sander, 1983). A protein
ligand graph (PLG) is a labeled, undirected graph that models
one protein chain. Each vertex represents an SSE of that chain or a
ligand assigned to the chain in the PDB file, and the edges model
contacts between SSEs including their relative spatial orientation.
A hard sphere model is used to define atom contacts. A rule set de—
termines whether two SSEs are in a contact, based on the number of
atom contacts between them. For details on how the contacts and
orientations are computed, see Schafer et al. (2012). Connected
components of PLGs are called folding graphs (FGs). PTGL defines

four different linear notation strings for FGs. Users can search the
database for protein structural motifs, which is based on fast text
matching in the linear notations. The PTGL provides intuitive two—
dimensional visualizations of the FGs for all linear notations.

We rewrote the PTGL from scratch, implemented ligand support
and other new features and updated all data to the April 2015 ver—
sion of the PDB, which contains information on more than 230 000
protein chains. The data will be updated on a regular basis by our
automated update procedure.

2 Features

The PTGL web server allows to search for PLGs, FGs and linear nota—
tion strings of FGs based on PDB identifiers, keywords, ligands or
structural motifs. Several common motifs like the beta propeller or
jelly roll are pre-implemented. Querying by custom linear notation
strings enables the search for arbitrary arrangements of SSEs. Table 1
lists the counts for several motifs and their co—occurrence in protein
chains with different ligands. In addition to the alpha, beta and
alpha—beta graphs of the previous PTGL release, the current version
supports ligands and introduces three additional graph types: alpha
ligand graphs contain alpha helices and ligands, beta ligand graphs
contain beta strands and ligands and alpha—beta ligand graphs contain
alpha helices, beta strands and ligands.

The database contains a total of 234 735 protein chains and 16 790 ligand
types.

est FG of 7T|M chain A is depicted below a 3D view of the structure. Each ver-
tex in the graph represents an SSE or a ligand of the protein chain. The edges
model spatial contacts. Note the parallel beta barrel of size 8 and the ligand in
the center of the barrel, which exhibits contacts to several SSEs (Color ver-
sion of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

These graphs enable users to search for substructures that bind
ligands. Note that the PTGL is a chain—level database, and currently
only intra—chain contacts are computed. The PLGs can be exported
in standard graph file formats like Graph Modeling Language
(GML, Himsolt, 1997), e.g. to be analyzed by software like Gephi
(Bastian et al., 2009), GraphViz (Ellson et al., 2004) or Cytoscape
(Cline et al., 2007). The PTGL server visualizes PLGs and FGs as
two—dimensional schematic diagrams, and the resulting images can
be exported in vector and bitmap formats. Figure 1 depicts an ex—
ample visualization of the structure of triosephosphate isomerase
with phosphoglycolohydroxamic acid bound (Davenport et al.,
1991)

The PTGL provides links to the PDB and CATH. We also offer
an interactive 3D visualization of the graphs by JSmol (Hanson et
al., 2013). Clients can use the web frontend to browse the PTGL
data using any recent browser. For large—scale analyses of protein
topologies, the REST API can be queried. It serves PG and FG data
in JavaScript Object Notation and Extensible Markup Language
formats and supports retrieval of graph visualizations. Online help
and the API documentation are available on the web site, and ex—
ample calls are listed in the Supplementary Information of this
article.

3 Implementation

All protein graph data available on the PTGL 3 server were com—
puted from PDB and DSSP data by an extended version of the VPLG
software (Schafer et al., 2012). This was done ofﬂine during the ser-
ver installation or update procedure that ran in parallel for many
PDB files on a computer cluster. The update procedure involved
downloading PDB data, generating DSSP data, running VPLG and
copying the result files and database from the computer cluster to
the PTGL server. It was controlled by Bash and Python scripts.
Supplementary Figure S1 in the Supplementary Material depicts an
overview of the update procedure and the server architecture. Data
on the PLGs, FGs and linear notations were stored in a PostgreSQL
database, including images and GML files. An entity-relationship
diagram of the database schema and a visualization of the PTGL ser-
ver architecture is provided in Supplementary Figure S2.

4 Summary

The PTGL uses graphs to model protein structures and ligands on
the super—secondary level. The graphs were computed from 3D atom
data from the RCSB PDB and the secondary structure assignments
of the DSSP algorithm. The PTGL works on the chain level. In the
future, we will extend it to also support multi—chain proteins and
protein complexes.

The new version of the PTGL was rewritten from scratch and
was designed to be easy to maintain and extend. It includes the latest
PDB data, ligand information and a RESTful application program-
ming interface.

The PTGL supports fast searching for protein chains by substruc—
tures, ligands and other properties. The different protein graph types
allow for the assessment of the overall structure of a chain including
its ligands. The four different visualizations of FGs can be used to
analyze and compare protein substructures in greater detail. The
new PTGL is a powerful and updated tool which enables investiga—
tions of protein topology on a large scale. It is useful in applications
like protein classification, drug design and studies of evolutionary
relationships between proteins.

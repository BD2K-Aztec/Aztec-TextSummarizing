Abstract

Motivation: For genetic studies, statistically significant variants explain far less trait variance than
‘sub—threshold’ association signals. To dimension follow—up studies, researchers need to accurately
estimate ‘true’ effect sizes at each SNP, e.g. the true mean of odds ratios (ORs)/regression coeffi—
cients (RRs) or Z—score noncentralities. Na'ive estimates of effect sizes incur winner’s curse biases,
which are reduced only by laborious winner’s curse adjustments (WCAs). Given that Z—scores esti—
mates can be theoretically translated on other scales, we propose a simple method to compute
WCA for Z—scores, i.e. their true means/noncentralities.

Results:WCA of Z—scores shrinks these towards zero while, on P—value scale, multiple testing ad—
justment (MTA) shrinks P—values toward one, which corresponds to the zero Z—score value. Thus,
WCA on Z—scores scale is a proxy for MTA on P—value scale. Therefore, to estimate Z—score noncen—
tralities for all SNPs in genome scans, we propose FDR Inverse Ouantile Transformation (FIQT). It
(i) performs the simpler MTA of P—values using FDR and (ii) obtains noncentralities by back—
transforming MTA P—values on Z—score scale. When compared to competitors, realistic simulations
suggest that FIQT is more (i) accurate and (ii) computationally efficient by orders of magnitude.
Practical application of FIQT to Psychiatric Genetic Consortium schizophrenia cohort predicts a
non—trivial fraction of sub—threshold signals which become significant in much larger
supersamples.

Conclusions: FIQT is a simple, yet accurate, WCA method for Z—scores (and ORs/RRs, via simple
transformations).

1 Introduction

Genome—wide association studies (GWAS) represent a powerful and
widely used tool for detecting associations between genetic variants
and complex traits. In such studies, researchers directly assay and
statistically impute (Li et al., 2010) genotypes for one to several mil—
lion single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), respectively. The
GWAS paradigm has been very successful in identifying genetic vari-
ants associated with a range of phenotypes (Dewan et al., 2006;
Hindorff et al., 2009; Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium,
2007). However, as seen in GWAS of psychiatric disorders (Purcell
et al., 2009; Sklar et al., 2011), a considerable portion of the pre-
dicted genetic contribution is contributed by numerous moderate
signals which are not deemed significant at accepted genome—wide
levels, i.e. ‘suggestive’ signals. With the advent of large—scale, whole—
exome and —genome sequencing studies, the field will likely see an
exponential increase in the number of such suggestive signal.

To successfully dimension future studies, e.g. for detecting as sig—
nificant a certain number of signals which are only ‘suggestive’ in
current cohorts, there is a need for statistical methods that accur—
ately estimate unbiased effect—sizes for suggestive signal SNPs and,
even, all variants from genome scans (henceforth denoting not only
extant GWAS and whole—exome sequencing but emergent whole—
genome sequencing studies as well). Given that effect size estimates
such as Z—scores, ORs and RRs can be theoretically translated from
one scale to another, in this paper we concentrate on estimating the
true means/noncentrality of Z—scores at each SNP.

When estimating the true effect sizes, it is well established that
the largest signals are generally the most affected by the bias known
as ‘winner’s curse’ (Zollner and Pritchard, 2007), i.e. their apparent
effect size is (sometimes much) larger than their true values. This is
due to statistics with the largest magnitude having an extreme value
distribution (Jenkinson, 1955), as opposed to the Gaussian distribu—
tion we commonly assume for a random SNP Z—score. By incorrectly
assuming a Gaussian distribution, naive estimators of extreme statis—
tics have a tendency to overestimate the magnitude of these statistics
(Zollner and Pritchard, 2007). In statistical genetics, researchers
proposed a multitude of methods to perform winner’s curse adjust—
ment (WCA) for studies with one—stage (discovery) (Faye et al.,
2011; Ghosh et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2011; Xiao and Boehnke,
2011; Xu et al., 2011; Zhong and Prentice, 2007, 2008;) and two—
stage (discovery and replication) studies (Bowden and Dudbridge,
2009; Zhong and Prentice, 2008). For Z—scores, these WCA esti—
mates, i.e. their noncentralities or true means, are obtained by
shrinking the Z-scores towards their null value of zero. However, a
majority of these methods are only designed to handle mostly signifi-
cant signals.

Recently, two new tools for estimating the mean/noncentrality
of all statistics in genome scans were proposed. The first, the
Empirical Bayes (EB) method based on Tweedie’s formula (Efron,
2009), was adapted from a general purpose statistical method.
Because it employs empirical estimates of the density/histogram
(120 bins by default) of scan statistics, it is well suited for the large
number of statistics from a genome scan (albeit less suited to in—
stances in which the number of statistics is much smaller). In the
context of genome scans, this method was used by Ferguson et al.
(2013), who found that the empirical histogram is less precise in the
extreme tails off the distribution, where tail adjustment (TA) meth—
ods (Ghosh et al., 2008; Zhong and Prentice, 2008) provide better
accuracy. Based on these observations, the authors proposed an
interesting adaptive combination of EB and TA which, at the cost of
increased computational burden, combines the best attributes of

both methods. The second of these new tools is a computationally
efficient, soft threshold method (Bacanu and Kendler, 2012) which
adjusts statistics such that their sum of squares do not overestimate
the true mean. Because this method does not use empirical density
estimation, it is applicable even to a small number of statistics.

Similar to WCA, naive use of SNP P—values as a measure of asso—
ciation for SNPs will overestimate their statistical significance. This
is due to the fact that, due to the large number of tests, many SNPs
will attain very low P—values even under the null hypothesis of no as—
sociation between trait and genotypes. Thus, to be used in assessing
genome-wide significance of SNPs, individual P—values need to be
first adjusted for multiple testing (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995;
Dudbridge and Gusnanto, 2008). After multiple testing adjustment
(MTA), the adjusted P—values are much larger than the original
ones, i.e. they are ‘shrunken’ towards the null value of one. Given
that WCA shrinks Z—scores towards zero and MTA shrinks the
P—values towards one (which corresponds to a value of zero on the
Z—score scale), we argue that WCA for effect sizes is very similar in
spirit with, if not downright the homologue of, MTA for P—values.
Thus, MTA can be considered, if not identical to, a very good proxy
for the WCA for P—values.

To accurately estimate the WCA of Z—scores from a genome
scan, i.e. their true means/noncentralities, we propose a novel two—
step method, which is inspired by the strong similarity between
MTA and WCA. First, we perform a MTA for P—values, e.g. by
using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995). Second, we estimate the noncentrality of Z—scores
by back—transforming the adjusted P—value on the Z—score scale
using an inverse Gaussian cumulative distribution function (cdf).
When compared to competing methods, we show that the proposed
procedure has very good performance in terms of (i) squared error
loss, (ii) fraction of the variability in true means of univariate statis—
tics explained and (iii) computational efficiency. A practical applica—
tion of this approach shows that, due to their good performance, the
proposed estimators can be used to predict with reasonable accuracy
the number and location of subtreshold signals that are likely to be—
come significant in much larger cohorts.

2 Methods

As mentioned above, the main issue we address in this paper per—
tains to the estimation, as opposed to testing, of Z—score noncentral—
ities for all SNPs in a genome scan. Below, we first present our
proposed method and its competitors, including extensions of these
competitors proposed by us. Subsequently, we describe simulation
setup and genetic data used for our chosen practical application.

2.1 Notation
Let X,- N N (u), 1), i : 1, . . . , k, be the normally distributed univari—
ate statistics from a genome scan and u,- and pi, i : 1, . . . , 13, their

associated noncentralities and P—values, respectively. If not reported,
X,- can be easily computed based on other reported summary statis—
tics [see Supplementary Material (SM)].

2.2 Novel method based on P—value adjustment

Given the extreme value distribution of scan statistics in the upper
and lower tails and different distributions elsewhere, it is unclear
(or, at least, very complicated) how to properly WCA Z—scores, i.e.
estimate their noncentralities, for all SNPs in a genome scan.
However, it is extremely simple to MTA the P—values for the

Simple yet accurate correction for Winner’s curse

 

genome—wide multiple testing. The Invariance Principle of
Mathematical Statistics (Casella and Berger, 1990) implies that a le—
gitimate, and thus not merely ad—hoc, statistical approach is to per—
form the winner’s curse adjustment on any scale/transformed
variable and transform the adjusted quantities on the original scale.
Based on the Invariance Principle and the argument in the
Introduction, stating that MTA is a (very) good proxy for WCA on
the P—value scale, we thus propose to (i) adjust SNP P—values for
multiple testing, e.g. using FDR as in this paper and (ii) obtain the
Z—score noncentrality estimates for each SNP as the Gaussian quan—
tiles (with the appropriate sign) associated with these adjusted P—val—
ues (also denoted as FDR q—values). [While the FDR procedure
might be anticonservative for the extreme scenario of numerous
negatively correlated variables (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995), in
genetics FDR is widely used because (i) Z—scores are only locally cor—
related and (ii) we do not expect these local correlations to be mostly
negative.]

In mathematical notation, let pi*,i : 1,...,/e be the q—values
(FDR adjusted P—values). Then, we can estimate the noncentralitiy
of Z—scores, 27*, i = 1,. ..,k, b

2??" : sign(X,-) @‘1 <1 — %§, where d) is the cdf of a Gaussian
distribution.

While we chose FDR as a simple, and less conservative than
most, P—value adjustments for multiple testing, homologous meth—
ods can be constructed using other P—value MTA methods. Many
such adjustments are already available in the same p.adjust R func—
tion, which we employed for the FDR adjustment. Among others,
p.adjust implements more conservative family—wise error rate type
of adjustments, such as Bonferroni, pf“ : max(/ep,-,1), or Holm’s
(1979). While we believe that methods based on the above MTA
methods will provide rather similar mean Z—score estimates, the as—
sessment of non—FDR based methods are outside the scope of this

paper.

2.3 EB extensions

EB uses all genome scan statistics to (i) empirically estimate their
density and (ii) use the derivatives of the empirical densities to esti—
mate the mean of the statistics and their variance. However, scan
statistics are often rather correlated locally (i.e. as a consequence of
linkage disequilibrium). This is likely to (i) affect the density esti—
mate (which assumes independent statistics) and (ii) underestimate
the variance of mean statistics. To eliminate (most of) the local cor—
relations we propose an EB extension which (i) divides the statistics
into n equally spaced non—overlapping sets (e.g. first set contains
statistics with indices 1,n+ 1, 211—)— 1,..., and the second those
with indices 2,n—l—2, 2n—l—2,...,), (ii) estimates the density for
each set, (iii) uses each set density to estimate a set—specific noncen—
tralities for all scan statistics and (iv) estimates the overall noncen—
tralities of scan statistics as the average set—specific means. We
denote this estimator as EB—n, i.e. when using 100 non-overlapping
sets the EB extension is denoted as EB—100. The obvious disadvan—
tage of EB—n over EB is its increased computational burden, as the
computationally intensive estimation of density and its derivatives
are computed n times.

2.4 Methods used for comparison

For comparison, we use the naive maximum likelihood estimator
(MLE), i.e. the statistics themselves, classical EB (EB—1 in the above
set notation) and EB—n (n = 10, 50, 100). (Because the soft threshold
method (Bacanu and Kendler, 2012) was found to slightly underper—
form EB-1, for brevity, we omit it from our results.) Due to it

sometimes outperforming EB in the tails, we also include the tail ad—
justment (TA) method (Ghosh et al., 2008; Zhong and Prentice,
2008). The original TA adjusts all statistics above a preset (and gen—
erally significant) threshold, which results in two unusual features
for our presentation of results. First, given that remaining methods
adjust all statistics in a genome scan, we employed TA outside its in—
tended purposes, e.g. even for (very) non—significant thresholds.
Second, given TA’s approach of computing the bias for all statistics
above a signal threshold, we present the performance of tested meth—
ods (MSE and R2 in Section 3) in a cumulative manner, i.e. for all
statistics with unadjusted P—values below a large range of

thresholds.

2.5 Implementation and assessment of performance

We implemented all described methods using the R statistical pro—
gramming environment. For FDR, FIQT employed the p.adjust base
function with the ‘fdr’ option specified for method (10-line FIQT
implementation in R, which is available in SM). Based on the de—
scriptions from (Efron, 2009; Ferguson et al., 2013), EB type meth—
ods were implemented in three steps. First, the range of Z—score
vector, Z, is divided int0120 equally sized bins. Second, we used
gam function in gam package to estimate the probability density
function, P(z), as the predicted curve from a smoothed (using nat—
ural splines) Poisson regression of bin counts on bin midpoints.
Third, the Z—score means are estimated numerically for each
observed value of Z = z as W52)”. The running time of tested
methods was assessed using the second entry (i.e. ‘system’) from the
output of system.time R function.

2.6 Simulations

We simulate a complex height—like trait by patterning our simula-
tions on the observed effect sizes of the m = 180 significant signals
from the large mega-analysis of human height (MHH), which ana-
lyzed around 180, 000 subjects (Lango et al., 2010). We assumed
that the trait under investigation has m1 causal loci which represent
a fraction yo 3 1 of the number of significant loci (m : 180) in
height study (Table 1), i.e. m1 : yo m. When ye < 1, the m1 causal
loci are chosen at random from the significant loci in MHH. Given
that simulating genome scan statistics starting from genotypes is la—
borious and very time consuming, we simulate scan statistics by add—
ing to subsets of above selected (and scaled) effect sizes, and their
LD—induced decay in neighboring SNPs, ARMA (3,4) residuals [for
more information see Simulation model in Supplementary Material

(SM) and Table 1]. This model for residuals was found to be

adequate for simulating statistics for markers with a density of ap—
proximately 1 SNP/kbp (Bacanu and Kendler, 2012).

To assess the performance of methods for underpowered studies,
we performed simulations under H0. Under this scenario ye : 0, i.e.
the simulated statistics are identical to an ARMA (3,4) realization of
unit variance. We simulated sample sizes equaling a fraction
ys E {%,2} of the MHH sample size (n % 180,000). [While the
chosen sample sizes (>22 500 subjects) might appear too large, these
cohorts (i) consist of unselected/population subjects and (ii) are
roughly the sizes of the more powerful selected (case—control) sub—
jects needed to detect a non—trivial number of signals in multi-site
psychiatric genetic cohorts (Ripke et al., 2013; Ripke et al., 2011;
Sklar et al., 2011).] Additional details regarding the relationship be—
tween mean of the statistics and VS, are available in the Simulation
model subsection in SM. For every parameterization given in
Table 1, we performed 250 simulations.

2.6 Practical application

To underline FIQT accuracy and its usefulness in genetics, we
applied it to the summary statistics from the discovery phase of the
2005 Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) GWAS of schizo—
phrenia (PGC-SCZ1) (Ripke et al., 2011). PGC-SCZ1 FIQT esti-
mates were used to predict the genomic regions harboring statistics
which are expected to attain significance in the four—fold larger dis-
covery phase of the 2014 PGC SCZ study (henceforth denoted as
PGC-SCZ2) (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric
Genomics Consortium, 2014). Our inference is a point prediction,
as opposed to a testing procedure. It is based solely on the predicted
noncentrality estimates in PGC—SCZZ, as opposed to association
P-values from PGC—SCZl. The inference relies on the fact that the
Z—score noncentrality increases with the square root of the sample
size. Thus, the noncentrality (true mean) of Z—score for SNPs in
PGC—SCZZ are estimated simply as the double of their PGC—SCZl
homologues. We predict as significant in PGC—SCZZ only those
SNPs for which the P—value associated with their predicted Z—score
noncentrality is lower than the commonly used 5 X 10—8 threshold.

3 Results

Among EB-n methods, we tested EB—1, EB—10, EB—50 and EB—100.
EB-10 and EB—50 have intermediate performance between EB—1 and
EB-100, with EB-10 closer to EB—1 and EB—50 closer to EB—100
(data not shown). Consequently, we present only the results for EB-
1 and EB—100. Measures of prediction accuracy for all of the above
methods are assessed based on the simulated and estimated noncen—
tralities for all SNPs in genome scans.

Under H0, i.e. the surrogate for underpowered studies, FIQT has
the best mean square error (MSE) performance everywhere, except
for the (very small) region of extremely low P—values, where EB—1
slightly outperforms it (Fig. 1). Among the remaining methods, EB-
1 performs best over the entire parameter space and, as expected,
MLE has the largest MSE. We note that, in marked contrast to the
alternative hypothesis results that follow, EB—1 thoroughly outper—
forms EB-100.

Under the alternative, Ha, FIQT has better MSE performance for
settings with moderate to large number of signals and larger sample
sizes (Fig. 2). Its performance improvement over competitors is
sometimes substantial, e.g. for large sample sizes and medium num-
ber of signals. EB—1 does not outperform FIQT under any Ha scen—
arios. EB-100 only nominally outperforms FIQT at smaller sample
sizes. Surprisingly, even though it was designed only as a tail bias

adjustment, TA performs reasonably well. Under certain scenarios,
e.g. large sample sizes, it outperforms EBs for statistics with nomin-
ally significant P—values and even slightly outperforms FIQT for a
very narrow range of moderately small P—values. The better per—
formance of FIQT is mostly due to the lower variance of this estima—
tor [Fig. S1 in Supplementary Material (SM)], because, when
compared with EB (and especially TA) methods, the bias is often
somewhat larger (Fig. 52). (However, FIQT conservativeness at low
P—values (negative bias in 52), opens the possibility of future im-
provement which take into account the local LD of statistics, as

SNPs having negative log (unadjusted) P-values below -Iog10 P. See Figures 1
and 2 for background and notations

alluded in Discussion.) When measuring accuracy by R2, i.e. the ex—
plained variability of the Z—score noncentralities, FIQT practically
outperforms all other methods (Fig. 3), albeit EB-100 only nomin-
ally so.

Due to its very simple computation, FIQT has much faster run-
ning times than competitors. When compared to the next most ac—
curate method, EB—100, the proposed method is faster by more than
four orders of magnitude [Fig. 52 in Supplementary Material (SM)].
FIQT is also faster than the less accurate EB—1 by almost two orders
of magnitude (data not shown).

Practical application. Given that discovery phase of PGC—SCZZ
has around four times the sample size of its PGC—SCZl homolog,
then the Z—score noncentrality in PGC—SCZZ are expected to be
twice as large as the PGC—SCZl FIQT estimates (see Fig. S4 for rela-
tionships between these estimators and PGC—SCZl statistics). By
computing, under a Gaussian distribution assumption, the P—values
associated with estimated PCC_SCZZ noncentralities, we predict 46
regions (Supplementary Table 81) to attain significance in PGC—
SCZZ, as opposed to only 11 present in PGC—SCZl. The 46 regions
were obtained by clustering together predicted significant signals
within 250 Kb. Of these significant regions, a very high number, 34
(~75%), overlap the 105 independent chromosomal regions re-
ported by PGC—SCZZ. A total of 18 predicted PGC—SCZZ regions
overlap the extended MHC region (25—33 Mb) on chromosome 6p
from the actual PGC—SCZZ findings, as opposed to only 5 reported
by PGC—SCZl. Of the overall of 34 overlapping regions, 16 are in
loci outside MHC regions, as opposed to just 6 reported by PGC—
SCZ1.

4 Conclusions

We propose a novel approach, FIQT, to extract information from
genome scan statistics by estimating noncentrality (true mean)
of Z—scores by performing a winner’s curse adjustment (WCA) on
Z—scores. Due to the high degree of similarity between WCA on

Z—score scale and multiple testing adjustment (MTA) on P—value
scale, we propose a two stage procedure. First, use FDR for the
MTA of P—values. Second, transform the adjusted P—values to upper
tail Z—scores and assign to it the sign of the original statistics. When
compared to competing methods, FIQT estimators are shown to (i)
have a smaller mean squared error loss, (ii) explain a higher propor-
tion of the true means of the statistics and (iii) have substantially
faster running times. The practical application to PGC—SCZl data
show that FIQT estimators are useful for highlighting, with reason-
able specificity, genomic regions likely to attain significance only in
much larger supersamples.

Empirical Bayes, EB, and similar methods are currently some of
the state—of—the—art approaches for accurately estimating the noncen—
trality of scan statistics. However, all EB methods are computation—
ally and skill intensive and, due to the need of empirically estimating
the probability density of statistics, they might not be appropriate
when the number of statistics is reasonably small. Our proposed
method, FIQT, eliminates these disadvantages while maintaining a
similar (to sometimes much better) prediction accuracy. Its perform—
ance advantage over EB based methods is especially notable at high
sample sizes and a moderate to large number of true signals. [While,
the accuracy was assessed only on the Z—score scale, Delta Method
(a first order Taylor approximation) from statistical theory states
that the relative performance of methods should be similar on other
scales (Casella and Berger, 1990), e.g. RRs or ORs.]

FIQT practical application to PGC SCZ summary statistics, were
used to predict a large fraction of future signals discovered in a four
times larger cohort. This underscores its useful in predicting moder—
ately large, even if non-significant, signals. While ranking regions
and predicting as possibly significant in the future a set number of
them, in practice the decision on the magnitude of such number is
both complex and subjective. In contrast, FIQT can help to object—
ively determine the number of signals that likely to be significant in
the future based on the (i) estimated non—centralities and the (ii) in-
crease in sample size. Such estimates can be used to adequately de—
sign well—powered follow—up studies.

FIQT estimates the noncentralities for all Z—scores in a genome
scan. Sometimes, Z—scores are not available and the researchers need
to estimate them from other summary data (see SM). Conversely,
the adjusted Z—scores (e.g. FIQT estimates of their noncentrality)
can be subsequently used to estimate the adjusted values for the
summary statistics of interest. For instance, if summary data contain
only log odds ratio, ln(OR), and their standard error, 8, then

1mg. Subsequently, we can use the

the vector of Z—scores is X :
adjusted Z—scores (FIQT estimates), X*, to estimate the adjusted
odds ratio, e.g. as ln(OR)* =6" X*(1) or ln(OR)* :  ln(OR).
ln(OR)* can be interpreted as the vector of unbiased (winner’s curse
corrected) ln(OR). However, it can be argued that the winner’s
curse might be due to underestimation of 8, for instance. While ad—
justment for this scenario is more complex, a helpful idea might be
to substitute ’6 in (1) by its average over the (reasonably tight) allele
frequency bin which includes the SNP under investigation.

In its present form, FIQT is conservative and provides only point
estimates, i.e. it does not compute the standard deviation (SD) of
Z—score noncentrality estimates. In the future we plan to extend
FIQT to be both less conservative and provide such estimates.
Heuristically, for each SNP, such a plan might (i), similarly to EB-n,
compute FIQT—n mean Z—score noncentrality estimates by using
only (quasi—independent) SNPs spaced n lags apart and (ii) obtain n—
1 estimates of its SNP Z—score noncentrality by interpolation using
all FIQT-n which do not include this SNP in its support.
Subsequently, for each SNP, (i) the Z—score noncentrality might be

estimated as the mean of its n—1 FIQT—n noncentralities and (ii) the
SD of the mean of FIQT—n scores can be estimated assuming that the
n — 1 FIQT-n Z-scores follow a (circular) AR time series. When
compared to the original application to SNPs in high LD, the quasi-
independence of SNPs in a FIQT—n set ensures that FDR q—values are
much less conservative and, in turn, the updated FIQT estimates be—
come less conservative.

FIQT is a very simple yet powerful method. However, in its pre—
sent form, it is more of a proof—of—concept and we believe it can be
further improved. One direction would be to extend FIQT to accur—
ately estimate other variables besides Z—score noncentralities. For in-
stance, shrinkage estimators are widely used for correlation/
covariance matrices (Daniels and Kass, 2001). Given that the sample
correlations are normally distributed with variances dependent only
on the sample size, FIQT can be extended to the estimation of cor—
relation matrices. The extension might involve shrinking the magni-
tudes of correlation matrix entries toward zero.

FIQT has the potential to be used in the personalized genomics,
e.g. the prediction of subject level risk based on whole genome data.
Methods for predicting subject level risk typically use summary statis—
tics as input, e.g. LDpred extension (http://biorxiv.org/content/early/
2015/03/04/015 85 9) of LD score method (Bulik—Sullivan et al.,
2015). Thus an increased accuracy of signal estimation used as input
might result in more accurate estimates of an individual’s risk/trait
mean.

5 Software

FIQT is available from GitHub and Supplementary Material. It will
also be implemented in DISTMIX (Lee et al., 2015), our group’s dir—
ect imputation software for cosmopolitan cohorts (http://dleelab.
github.io/distmi>d). (DISTMIX imputes the statistics at the unmeas—
ured SNPs based only on the statistics at the measured SNPs and the
LD patterns estimated from a cosmopolitan reference panel.)

ABSTRACT

Summary: Experimentally found gene expression profiles are used to
solve different problems in pharmaceutical studies, such as drug
repositioning, resistance, toxicity and drug—drug interactions. A special
web service, DIGEP-Pred, for prediction of drug-induced changes of
gene expression profiles based on structural formulae of chemicals
has been developed. Structure—activity relationships for prediction of
drug-induced gene expression profiles were determined by Prediction
of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS) software. Comparative
Toxicogenomics Database with data on the known drug-induced
gene expression profiles of chemicals was used to create mRNA-
and protein-based training sets. An average prediction accuracy for
the training sets (ROC AUC) calculated by leave-one-out cross-valid-
ation on the basis of mRNA data (1385 compounds, 952 genes, 500 up-
and 475 down-regulations) and protein data (1451 compounds, 139
genes, 93 up- and 55 down-regulations) exceeded 0.85.

1 INTRODUCTION

Drug-induced gene expression proﬁle (DIGEP) is an important
determinant of the drug effect on a cell. Recent rapid advances
in DNA microarray technology allow one to use in practice
the DIGEPs (Chengalvala et al., 2007). Lamb introduced
Connectivity Map (CMap) as a phenotype-based drug discovery
approach based on comparison of disease gene signature and
drug-induced changes in gene expression proﬁles (Lamb et al.,
2006). Since then, more than 50 studies using CMap approach
for drug repositioning, lead discovery, mechanism of action elu-
cidation and so forth were published (Qu and Rajpal, 2012). It
was shown that CMap approach can be used to reveal side
effects of drugs (Huang et al., 2010; Minowa et al., 2012), esti-
mation of drug resistance (Iskar et al., 2010) and analysis of the
drug synergistic effects (Jin et al., 2011).

CMap approach is applicable only for several thousand drugs
having experimentally determined DIGEPs but cannot be used
for other drugs or new drug candidates. To overcome this

limitation, we decided to create a web service to predict
DIGEPs for new drug-like compounds on the basis of the
existing data on DIGEPs.

There are several freely available databases on experimental
DIGEPs, including NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett
et al., 2007), Connectivity Map Database (Lamb et al., 2006)
and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) (Davis
et al., 2013). Structure—activity relationships are traditionally
used to decrease the number of experiments in the process of
drug development. The gene expression changes can be con-
sidered as a particular type of the biological activity of a drug.
Therefore, Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS)
approach can be applied for prediction of DIGEPs. To the best of
our knowledge, the developed web service is the ﬁrst tool that
allows the prediction of drug-induced changes in gene expression
proﬁles based on the structural formulae of chemical compounds.

2 METHODS

The data on drug-induced changes of gene expression were downloaded
from CTD (version of October, 2012). The CTD data were derived from
scientiﬁc literature based on the change in an experimentally measured
level of mRNA or protein. CTD contains the data on gene ontology,
associations and relationships of genes with diseases and biological path-
ways that give an insight into the inﬂuence mechanisms of chemical com-
pounds on the human health GDaVis et al., 2013). Despite CTD data not
being cell dependent, different studies showed that, based on the gene
expression data of one cell line, the active compounds against another cell
line can be found (Karube et al., 2013; Sirota et al., 2011). CTD provides
per se general drug-induced changes of gene expression that can be used
in drug discovery with some limitations and assumptions (Qu and Rajpal,
2012). Such general drug-induced changes of gene expression reﬂect the
intrinsic properties of a drug, and their different fractions may be revealed
in the appropriate cell lines or tissues under the certain experimental
conditions.

Based on mRNA and protein data, we have created two independent
training sets that provide a more deﬁnite prediction of the change
in mRNA expression and appropriate protein concentration. Structural
formulae of chemicals were obtained from ChemIDPlus (http://chem.sis.
nlm.nih.g0V/chemidplus) and ChemSpider (http://www.chemspider.com).
The structures of single organic molecules with molecular weight 50—1250
Da and the data on drug-induced changes of human-speciﬁc gene expres-
sion were selected from 2638 agents in CTD. mRNA-based training set
consists of 1385 compounds changing the expression of 14 700 genes
(11 131 up- and 10 980 down-regulations). Protein-based training set
consists of 1451 compounds changing the expression of 1950 genes
(1357 up- and 1204 down-regulations).

Developed over 20 years ago and brought up-to-date, PASS is a com-
puter program to predict qualitatively different biological activity types of

drug-like organic compounds based on their structural formula
(Filimonov and Poroikov, 2008). PASS is based on the use of Bayesian
approach and Multilevel Neighborhoods of Atom descriptors for repre-
sentation of a molecule structure (Lagunin et al., 2010; Poroikov et al.,
2000). It was earlier shown that the Bayesian approach used in PASS,
being selected by comparison of many mathematical algorithms for ana-
lysis of ‘structure—activity’ relationships, overtakes them by accuracy of
prediction (Filimonov and Poroikov, 2008) and robustness (Poroikov
et al., 2000). A freely available web service for prediction of the biological
activity spectra for drug-like molecules on the basis of PASS technology
(http://www.way2drug.com/PASSonline) was developed earlier (Sadym
et al., 2003). PASS prediction results are represented by the list of activ-
ities with probabilities “to be active” Pa and “to be inactive” Pi. The list is
arranged in a descending order of Pa—Pi; thus, the more probable changes
of gene expression are at the top of the list. The list can be shortened at
any desirable cutoff value, but Pa>0.5 is used by default. In this case,
both the chance to conﬁrm the predicted DIGEPs by the experiment and
the number of false-positive predictions are reasonable. The detailed
description of PASS approach is represented in the Supplementary
Material.

3 RESULTS

During PASS training, we selected the activities with three and
more active compounds and with >0.75 receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) Area under an ROC curve (AUC) values calcu-
lated by leave-one-out cross-validation procedure to reach
accurate and robust results of DIGEP prediction. The average
accuracy of prediction for mRNA-based training set of 952 genes
(500 up- and 475 down-regulations) and for protein-based train-
ing set of 129 genes (85 up- and 51 down-regulations) was 0.853
and 0.858, respectively (the accuracy of prediction for each ac-
tivity is represented in the Supplementary Material). Such accur-
acy is reasonable for application of DIGEP-Pred to make
prediction for new compounds. Input data include the structural
formula presented as MOL ﬁle or SMILES, or can be drawn by
MarVinSketch (Fig. 1).

Input data are sent to PASS service that makes DIGEP pre-
diction on the basis of above mentioned training sets. The pre-
diction results are kept in MySQL database. Web service

Fig. 1. The prediction results for captopril with the web service

through PHP scripts and appropriate links provides a possibility
for a user to save DIGEP prediction results as SDF or CSV ﬁles.
One can use either mRNA- or protein-based prediction or both.
The service provides links between gene names in predicted
DIGEPs and CTD site, which simpliﬁes the interpretation of
predicted results because of access to the relationships of genes
with diseases, side effects and biological pathways.

DIGEP prediction for captopril (angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitor used as antihypertensive drug), that was not
included in the training sets, was analyzed by CTD data
(Fig. 1). The relationships between genes from predicted
DIGEP and hypertension (REN, CAT, AGT and APOAl)
and known side effects (MediGuard: https://www.mediguard.
org/medication/side-effects/captopril) (fetal death: TMEM41B,
PLXNA2, PCDH17, MYBLl; dizziness: WIPIl, AGT, REN;
fatigue: TMEM41B, ClOORF 118, WIPIl, TOBl, REN;
cough: REN) were found. Apart from analysis between the
changes of single gene expression and diseases, the results of
DIGEP prediction may be used as input data of the methods
based on CMap approach for drugs without known experimen-
tally determined microarray data.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Microscopy advances have enabled the acquisition of
large-scale biological images that capture whole tissues in situ. This
in turn has fostered the study of spatial relationships between cells and
various biological structures, which has proved enormously beneficial
toward understanding organ and organism function. However, the
unique nature of biological images and tissues precludes the applica-
tion of many existing spatial mining and quantiﬁcation methods neces-
sary to make inferences about the data. Especially difficult is attempting
to quantify the spatial correlation between heterogeneous structures
and point objects, which often occurs in many biological tissues.
Results: We develop a method to quantify the spatial correlation be-
tween a continuous structure and point data in large (17500 x 17500
pixel) biological images. We use this method to study the spatial re-
lationship between the vasculature and a type of cell in the retina
called astrocytes. We use a geodesic feature space based on vascular
structures and embed astrocytes into the space by spatial sampling.
We then propose a quantiﬁcation method in this feature space that
enables us to empirically demonstrate that the spatial distribution of
astrocytes is often correlated with vascular structure. Additionally,
these patterns are conserved in the retina after injury. These results
prove the long-assumed patterns of astrocyte spatial distribution and
provide a novel methodology for conducting other spatial studies of
similar tissue and structures.

1 INTRODUCTION

The advent of high-throughput large-scale microscopy has been
a boon to the biological community; technological advances have
enabled the capture of whole tissue at micrometer resolution,
providing opportunities of study that have previously been un-
available. These improvements have especially had a profound
impact on examination of the spatial distribution and correlation
of biological entities, as the locations of large amounts of cells

and other structures can be imaged in situ. Studying the spatial
arrangement and relationships inherent in tissues can improve
our understanding of the various development or pathological
processes that underlie proper organ or organism function
Whitney et al., 2008).

Despite the abundance of image data, mining or quantifying
spatial properties in tissue can be a challenging task. Although
automated microscopy has signiﬁcantly improved acquisition
rates, capturing the spatial layout of whole cell populations or
structures at high resolution can require thousands of images
that take many days to acquire. Under limited time constraints,
oftentimes small samples of tissue are imaged and analyzed to
infer spatial properties of a whole tissue. However, many tissues
are spatially heterogeneous; application of mining or quantiﬁca-
tion methods on small images may not provide a representative
sample necessary to draw conclusions about the whole tissue. As
such, development of spatial mining and quantiﬁcation methods
that can be effectively applied to extremely large images with
diverse structures are highly desirable.

Yet many spatial mining methods are not suitable to handle
the complex and non-traditional spatial relationships found in
these large biological images. For example, neuronal or vascular
structures are pervasive in many tissues, and oftentimes are spa-
tially correlated with other cells (Armstrong, 2003; Suematsu
et al., 1994). Traditional spatial quantiﬁcation methods such as
co-location (Shekhar and Huang, 2001), K-function or nearest
neighbor methods (Cressie, 1992) cannot be applied to model the
relationship between these structures and cells because they in-
herently operate on discrete points in Euclidean space. Methods
that can model the complex relationship between biological
structure and cellular spatial distribution are needed to take
full advantage of these rich images. In addition, comparative
analysis of spatial relationships between normal and pathological
tissues is highly beneﬁcial for understanding underlying biolo-
gical processes. These existing spatial methods are difﬁcult to
apply to different specimens or conditions because the
Euclidean orientation and scaling between a set of images may
not be the same (Hagmann et al., 2008; Kaiser, 2011).

One tissue that exhibits many of the aforementioned spatial
characteristics is the mammalian retina. The nerve ﬁber layer
(NFL) of the retina is blanketed by a cell known as the astrocyte,
which performs a multitude of physiological functions
(Kimelberg, 2010). Astrocyte processes physically contact the
vascular structure (Yu et al., 2010), and they also play a key

Spatial relationships

 

functional role in the development of the retinal vasculature
(Metea and Newman, 2006). An apparent spatial correlation
between astrocytes and the blood vessels has been noted (Stone
and Dreher, 1987), but only observational evidence of such a
relationship has been provided. Strong evidence of astrocyte
spatial correlation with various vascular properties would lend
further support to additional hypotheses of astrocyte function,
such as the suspected role of astrocytes in vasodilation and
constriction (Kimelberg, 2010).

Attempts to quantify the correlation between vascular struc-
ture and the spatial placement of astrocytes will suffer from the
problems previously discussed. The vasculature is a large hetero-
geneous structure with speciﬁc arterial and venous delineations
(Dorrell and Friedlander, 2006; Gariano and Gardner, 2005)
that requires us to image the entire retina. In addition, while
astrocytes can be represented as points in Euclidean space, the
vasculature is a continuous structure and cannot be represented
as such. Hence, a quantiﬁcation method is needed that can map
these disparate and large data sources into a common space.

In this article, we describe a method to quantify the spatial
correlation between features of heterogeneous biological struc-
tures and Euclidean points in tissue, and apply it to the retina.
The proposed method is capable of capturing differences be-
tween the features of heterogeneous structures and spatial distri-
bution of points. The method implements a geodesic coordinate
system that is based on the vascular structure. The vasculature
and astrocytes are converted to this geodesic feature space such
that the position of astrocytes relative to the vasculature is pre-
served. Astrocyte distribution in the geodesic feature space is
then empirically compared with the vascular distribution. We
show that the distribution of astrocytes often spatially correlates
with changes in the vascular structure. Finally, we apply our
methodology to a set of injured retinas and demonstrate that
long-term detached retina do not deviate from the spatial
patterns observed on normal retinas.

Our methodology uses a geodesic feature space that is inde-
pendent of Euclidean space: the scale of the images and rotation
of the retina about the optic nerve have no impact on the results.
The scale and rotation invariance facilitates comparison between
retinas and different cell types. For example, retinal neurons,
pericytes or Muller cells can be converted into this same feature
space for comparative analysis. In addition, this methodology
can be used on spatial studies between other structures and
cells, such as the relationship between neuronal networks and
supporting cells. Our results demonstrate that we can successfully
quantify the spatial correlation between these disparate biolo-
gical entities, and provide a foundation for future research
aimed at studying the spatial distribution of various biological
components in large tissue images.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The goal of our method is to determine if astrocyte distribution in the
retina correlates with changes in vascular structure. For instance, as some
feature of the vascular structure becomes more frequent, we want to
determine if astrocyte distribution increases in close proximity to the
feature. To accomplish this, we extract astrocyte and blood vessel data
from large image mosaics of the retinal NFL. We then convert this retinal
data into a geodesic feature space that is based on the structure of the

vasculature, preserving the relative spatial relationship between astrocytes
and the vasculature. Histograms are then created for vascular and astro-
cyte data in the geodesic space. Finally, a distance is computed between
the vascular and astrocyte histograms, and bootstrapping is performed to
determine the correlation between the vascular structure and astrocyte
spatial distribution. We now detail each part of our spatial quantiﬁcation
method.

2.1 Images and data

2.1.] Image acquisition Our method is designed to quantify the spa-
tial relationship between large biological structures and point data such as
cellular locations. Hence, we acquired images of the entire retinal NFL,
which allows us to capture the complete retinal vasculature and all astro-
cytes present in the retina.

Images of mouse retinal NFL were viewed and collected on a laser
scanning confocal microscope using an automated stage to capture
optical sections at 0.5 ,am intervals in the z—axis and pixel resolution of
1024 x 1024 in the x—y direction, with 20% overlap in the x—y plane.
Approximately 350—400 3D images were acquired per retina, which
were then used to create maximum-intensity projections. The resulting
projections were then stitched together to create a single mosaic on the
order of ~17 500 pixels by ~17 500 pixels (\sim54002 ,amz).

A total of nine mosaics were created for this study, four normal and
ﬁve detached. The normal retinas are denoted as N1, N2, N3 and N4.
Three 1 month detached retinas, a 2 month detached retina and a
4 month detached retina are denoted as D1, DlA, DlB, D2 and D4,
respectively. All retinas were stained with anti-GFAP and anti-collagen
IV. Astrocytes express glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP), outlining the
cytoskeleton of each astrocyte in the retina. The retinal vasculature was
captured by examining the anti-collagen IV labeling.

An example mosaic is shown in Figure 1A. The retinal vasculature is
clearly visible as the tree-like structures in the images. Individual astro-
cytes are visible as small star-shaped cells and can be seen in detail in
Figure 1B. Color images of astrocytes in Figure 1B can be found in the
Supplementary Material, in addition to further details on the tissue prep-
aration and the image-acquisition process.

2.1.2 Data extraction Each retina contains ﬁve or six arteries and
veins arranged in an alternating pattern around the optic nerve head. The
veins are easily identiﬁed on the images by their ‘conveying’ type
branching (Ganesan et al., 2010). As explained in the Supplementary
Material, the images are slightly modiﬁed so that there exists only one
path from any point on the vasculature to the optic nerve head, thus
enforcing a tree structure on each artery and vein. The vascular network
in each retina is traced using Neuronstudio (Rodriguez et al., 2008), an
automated tracing tool for network structures. The trace is discretized
into 2 ,am segments of vasculature, and the tree structure of each of the
veins and arteries is recorded. That is, the parent and ancestor of each
2 ,um segment are recorded.

Anti-GFAP staining of the retinal tissue labels the cytoskeleton of all
astrocytes in the retina. As the nucleus of the cell often contained the
highest concentration of GFAP, the presumed center of each cell is manu-
ally selected from the image, and the x—y coordinates recorded. There are
~3500—4000 astrocytes in each image.

2.2 Geodesic feature space

The core of our method is the transformation of all retinal data to a 2D
geodesic feature space that is based on the structure of the vasculature. The
ﬁrst dimension measures the distance from a location in the retina to the
optic nerve head through the vasculature (i.e. geodesic distance on a blood
vessel). The second dimension represents physical blood vessel width.
This vascular centric feature space is central to our quantiﬁcation
methodology because it allows us to express the physical area and

extent of the vasculature in structural terms. For example, vessels tend to
become thinner as they branch outward from the optic nerve, and
increased branching also leads to increased geodesic distances. Using
the geodesic distance to the optic nerve head allows us to orient the
data to a single point, while still maintaining the spatial relationships in
the original retina. In addition, this space is not speciﬁc to any one retina;
all retinas possess an optic nerve head, thus enabling direct comparison of
the vasculature from different retinas.

Finally, each retina has been dissected to enable proper image acqui-
sition of the naturally curved tissue. These incisions (easily seen in
Fig. 1A) frequently disconnect portions of the vascular plexus, and distort
Euclidean distances in the retina. When such a disconnection occurs, the
vascular network is manually reconnected across the incision, and the
geodesic distance across the incision is set to zero, which easily accounts
for these Euclidean distortions.

2.2.1 Retinal data conversion The vasculature and astrocytes in a
retina must be converted to data in the geodesic feature space to quantify
their spatial relationship. Converting the vasculature is a simple process,
as any point on the vasculature can be directly converted to a point in the
geodesic feature space. Converting the astrocytes is a more complicated
endeavor, as astrocytes are cells that are not natively associated with
vascular distance or width.

sents a 2 ,am section of the vasculature. 03) Contour plot of the normal-
ized histogram of the same artery in geodesic space

The discrete vascular segments for each of the veins and arteries
are converted to a feature vector V,- (A,), where each V,[k] is a tuple
(d, w, x, y) that represents the geodesic distance and width for each
2 ,am segment of vessel, as well as the Euclidean coordinates for the
segment. The Euclidean coordinates are only used to aid in astrocyte
conversion. The closest segment in each artery or vein to the
optic nerve head is considered the root of the vessel tree, and the geodesic
distance to the optic nerve head from the root is set as zero. The geo-
desic distance for all other 2 ,am segments is simply computed as the
distance from a segment’s parent (the previously connected segment on
the vasculature) to the optic nerve head, plus two microns. Figure 2A
shows an example visual representation of V,[k].a' and V,[k].w for a sin-
gle artery. As can be seen, conversion of a blood vessel tree into the
feature space produces a distinct pattern that describes the structure
of the tree. For testing, the distance and width values are normalized
by the mean and standard deviation of the vector to put the data on
the same scale.

Each astrocyte is embedded into the feature space by spatially sampling
the vasculature in close proximity. That is, an astrocyte is converted into
a series of points in the geodesic feature space based on the structure of
the vasculature in some local region near the astrocyte. This allows us to
preserve astrocyte spatial distribution relative to the vasculature while
putting both entities in the same feature space.

Let 6, denote an astrocyte in the retina, and c,.x and 6,. y denote the
Euclidean coordinates of the astrocyte. A feature vector for c, is denoted
as 3, where c,[k] is a tuple (d, w, n, 1)), representing the geodesic distance,
width, primary vessel (the nth vein or artery) and a weight. For each
astrocyte in the retina, we sample Sb, vascular segments in the retina
(i.e. the length of  is Sbv). The Euclidean distance from astrocyte
c,- to all 2 ,am segments of vasculature in the retina is computed,

where E = (c,.x — Vj[k].x, c,.y — Vj[k].y), the difference in Euclidean co-
ordinates of astrocyte c,- and vessel segment Vj[k]. Note that  may be
composed of a combination of vein and artery segments; only the vein
notation was used in Equation (1) for explanation purposes. Essentially,
an astrocyte is converted into the geodesic feature space by assigning it a
vector of the geodesic distance and width of the Sb, nearest vascular
segments to the cell. Note we also record the origin of the sampled
artery/vein segments.

g2 (-) is a zero mean 2D Gaussian function with a diagonal covariance
matrix 2, applying a weight proportional to the distance between
the sample and the astrocyte. Vascular segments in close proximity to
astrocytes are given more importance over distant blood vessel segments.
After a feature vector is constructed for an astrocyte, the weights
the spatial samples in  are normalized to sum to one. That is,

cit/«1.12 = clap/(2,2: cit/1p).

2.3 Quantifying spatial relationships

2.3.] Histograms We compose the vascular and astrocyte feature
vectors into histograms so that we can compare the spatial distribution
of astrocytes relative with the vasculature. One major advantage of our
method is the ability to explore astrocyte distribution at different vascular
scales. Three different levels of histograms are implemented: retinal, ar-
terial/venous and individual blood vessels. We compose astrocyte histo-
grams at the same resolution as the vasculature histograms so that we can
test astrocyte spatial distribution at different granularities.

Construction of a histogram for a vein V,- and its accompanying astro-
cyte histogram is the same for any other individual artery/vein histogram.
A vein histogram is denoted as M, and the accompanying astrocyte
histogram as AM, where V,- = (B, N) and AV,- 2 (B, Ill). B is a
common set of bins in the geodesic space, and N and M are the counts
for the respective histogram bins.

The construction of V,- is simple. The count N]- for some bin Bj is
computed as

N,- = ZIV(Vi[k],BJ-)

where

where C is the set of all astrocytes, and

. 1, ‘f Zk.d,,k. EB-Azk. ='
Ic(cz[k],Bj,z)={0, Ltffellwlisecllw) 1 HM z

In other words, the astrocyte histogram AV,- is the weighted count of all
astrocytes that contain a spatial sample from vein Vi.

To construct higher level histograms, histograms from the lower levels
are combined. For example, the venous histogram V = Ule M, where k
is the number of veins, and the top-level vascular histogram is simply
\l U A (similarly for astrocyte histograms).

The bin set B is set so that each Bj covers a 0.1 x 0.1 region (recall
that the distance and width are normalized by the mean and variance).
The histogram counts are also normalized to sum to one to enable direct
comparison of histograms between retinas.

2.3 .2 Histogram distance We quantify the spatial relationship
between astrocytes and the vasculature by computing the probability
that an astrocyte histogram is a random sample from the corresponding
vascular histogram. Because the astrocyte histograms are constructed
by spatially sampling the vasculature, we hypothesize that the two histo-
grams should be similar if astrocyte distribution is highly correlated with
the structure of the vasculature.

A statistical test of probability distribution similarity is used, using the
Mallows distance (Munk and Czado, 1998). For two distributions X and
Y, the test statistic is

For. Y) = Jamar... Y) — Mac n}

where X n is an empirical sample of size n from X. Note that our histograms
are normalized to sum to one, equivalent to a probability distribution.

M (-) is the Mallows distance between probability distributions. The
Mallows distance has several desirable statistical properties (Bickel and
Freedman, 1981; Mallows, 1972). It is convergent up to the lm moment,
as well as convergent in distribution. These properties ensure that differ-
ences in distribution between astrocyte and vascular histograms are
accurately captured. Additional details on the Mallows distance can be
found in the Supplementary Material.

Bootstrapping is performed to compute a prior distribution of the test
statistic F for a given vascular histogram (Shao and Tu, 1995). A vascular
histogram is re-sampled multiple times, and the prior distribution of the
test statistic is computed using the re—sampled data. The hypothesis that
astrocyte distribution is correlated with a vascular histogram is unlikely
to be correct if the test statistic between an astrocyte and vascular histo-
gram is low compared with the re—sampled histograms.

Distance and width values are uniformly sampled from the blood
vessel histogram under test (e.g. M), and a sample histogram is con-
structed. The number of samples used is equal to the number of astro-
cytes that have a spatial sample from V,. For some astrocyte  that has a
spatial sample from V,- (i.e. cj[k].n = i), sample j contributes to the sample
histogram the total weight of  in V,. That is, for each sample j,
2k cj[k].p, ch[k].n = i, is added to the sample histogram (into the appro-
priate bin).

Note that the method of signiﬁcance testing does not depend on
the number of retinal mosaics that are collected. The bootstrapping
procedure provides a statistically sound method to compare two histo-
grams and is only used to determine if an astrocyte histogram is a ran-
dom sample from a vascular histogram. Hence even with a single retina,
the signiﬁcance testing procedure still provides accurate and statistically
valid hypothesis testing of the astrocyte histograms. Extrapolating the
results to a general population does, of course, require more than a
single retina.

3 RESULTS

The Mallows distance quantiﬁcation method was performed
on the three histogram scenarios for the nine retinas. In addition,
the method was also tested on synthetic retinal data to demon-
strate its effectiveness at capturing the spatial correlation
between vascular structure and astrocyte distribution. 2 is ini-
tially set to be 80 ,am, which is approximately the width of an
average retinal astrocyte. Sb, is varied from 1 to 40. Each boot-
strapping test used 500 random samples from a histogram.
Exploration of the effect of E on the statistical testing can be
found in the Supplementary Material.

created for this task; the vasculature of the artiﬁcial retina was
the vasculature for retina N 1. Artiﬁcial astrocytes were placed in
the retina in one of three methods. In the random method, a
2 ,am vascular segment was uniformly selected at random from
the vasculature, and the artiﬁcial astrocyte’s image coordinates
were set as the 2 ,am segment’s image coordinates, added to a 2D
gaussian distribution with standard deviation 10 ,am. In the
width weighted method, a vascular segment i was randomly
selected with probability P(wi) = W? where the normalization

 

w?’

is the sum of the widths for all segménts in the vasculature, for
some 2. Finally, in the distance weighted method, a vascular
segment was chosen with probability P(di), where d,- is the
geodesic distance of the segment. P(-) is a normal distribution
centered around dmean, the mean geodesic distance of the vascu-
lature, and a standard deviation of “9%, for some c. For both the
width and distance methods, the artiﬁcial astrocyte coordinates
were determined the same as the random method (with different
random selection methods).

Figure 3A and B show the normalized astrocyte histograms
for the random and width weighted methods. The original nor-
malized vascular histogram is the same one shown in Figure 2B.
Visually, the random placement histogram is similar to the vas-
cular histogram from Figure 2B. However, in contrast to the
random placement method, the width weighted histogram
places much more density in the regions of the space with
larger vascular width. While the differences between these two

methods are subtle, they become immediately apparent using our
method. An example image of a synthetic retina is available in
the Supplementary Material, as well as the normalized histogram
for the distance weighted method.

After creating the artiﬁcial retinas, the testing procedure as
previously described was applied. Figure 4 shows the average
P—value of the individual artery/vein histogram tests for the syn-
thetic data. Both 2 and c are varied so that the width and distance
weighted placements initially are close to the random method,
yet are increased over various tests. The P-value is deﬁned as the
probability that a random test statistic is greater than the one
computed between the astrocyte and blood vessel histograms.
A low P—value indicates the hypothesis that astrocytes are
spatially correlated with the corresponding portion of the vascu-
lature is unlikely to be correct. As can be seen, as both 2 and c
increase, the average P—values converge toward zero, as astrocyte
distribution becomes increasingly inﬂuenced by the width/
distance of the vasculature.

Clearly, there are many other models of randomly distributing
synthetic astrocytes in the retina (spatially uniformly distributed,
for example), and it is unrealistic to assume that our method
could discern differences in spatial distribution for all models.
However, the results do demonstrate that our method can detect
differences in astrocyte distribution when two important struc-
tural properties of the vasculature (width and distance) are
assumed to exert a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on spatial placement.
Testing of additional models of astrocyte distribution is an
attractive target for future research.

3.2 Vascular/arterial/venous histograms

The artery and vein histograms are combined into a single retinal
histogram for testing. Tables of the detailed P—value results are
available in the Supplementary Material. The normal retinas
generally have very low P—values, with a slight increase observed
on retinas N3 and N4 as the number of spatial samples is
increased. The detached retinas show a similar pattern of very
low P—values at the whole retina level. With a single spatial sam-
ple, it is unlikely that the retinal level histograms are a random
sample from the vasculature, be it a normal or detached retina.
This result is expected for the retinal level histograms; the

P—values reﬂect all local differences in spatial distribution be-
tween the astrocytes and vasculature anywhere in the retina.

All individual artery and vein histograms are then combined
into separate arterial and venous histograms (tables of P—values
available in Supplementary Material). Most of the venous histo-
grams have very low P-values. In contrast, most of the arteries
have high P—values, or at least higher P—values than their corres-
ponding venous histograms. Two basic patterns appear to be
emerging: arterial astrocytes are spatially distributed as random
samples from the arterial structure, and venous astrocytes spa-
tially deviate from the venous structure.

3.3 Individual vein/ artery histograms

The same pattern from the coarser scale histograms is evident on
the individual blood vessel tests. With a few exceptions, most of
the individual arteries have non-signiﬁcant P—values. Even N 1,
where the arteries at coarser scales had low P—values, contains
high P—values. This demonstrates that astrocytes in close prox-
imity to the arteries are spatially distributed similarly to structure
of the arteries. This pattern is evident at the arterial scale and the
individual vessel scale, for both the normal and detached retinas.
The P—values for the individual blood vessel tests can be found in
the Supplementary Material.

V(N 1, 1) is examined more closely to determine why the
P—values are low. Figure 5A shows the difference between
the astrocyte histogram and vein histogram from V(N 1, 1)
(AW/1 — V1). The lighter contours indicate the regions of feature

artery A(N2, 4). Light areas indicate regions where the astrocyte histo-
gram was denser. In (A), there are large regions where the two histograms
signiﬁcantly differ, as seen by the intense light and dark

space where the astrocyte histogram is more dense than the vein
histogram, and conversely for darker contours. As a comparison,
the histogram difference for A(N2, 4) is shown in Figure 5B,
which has a very high P—value. There are large regions where
the densities of the two histograms signiﬁcantly differ. In
Figure 5A, the astrocyte histogram is more dense on thicker
blood vessels that are closer to the optic nerve head, indicated
by the two light regions in the ﬁgure. Note how in Figure 5B, the
regions of difference between the astrocyte and artery histogram
are generally small and local.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work, we developed a method to quantify the spatial
relationship between a heterogeneous structure and discrete
points in Euclidean space. We used a novel geodesic feature
space and studied the relationship between astrocytes and the
vasculature in the retinal NFL. The vasculature and astrocytes
are converted to this feature space, which facilitates comparison
of astrocyte spatial distribution relative to the vasculature.
Empirical quantiﬁcation using the Mallows distance reveals
that astrocytes are spatially distributed independently from the
vasculature, with the exception of increased astrocyte density on
thick portions of veins.

Our method of quantifying the spatial relationship between
large structures and point objects has many advantages.
The used feature space is based on the geodesic distance to a
common object in all the images, thus enabling direct compari-
son of all data. Furthermore, conversion of the vascular data to
geodesic distance allows different resolutions of spatial relation-
ships to be tested; such varying resolutions could be applied to
other domains as well; for instance, from individual neurons
to larger circuits. Lastly, use of the Mallows distance to compare
histograms provides an accurate reﬂection of the differences
between vascular structure and astrocyte spatial distribution.
Clustering of point objects around speciﬁc regions of large con-
tinuous structures in diverse tissues can be easily identiﬁed using
our method.

Our method and subsequent results already have an immediate
impact on our understanding of the underlying biological pro-
cesses occurring in the retina. It is clear from our results that
detachment appears to have no discernible effect on the distri-
bution of astrocytes with respect to the vasculature. This is an
unexpected result, as it has been shown in various animals that
astrocytes react in response to trauma, such as the up-regulation
of GFAP in astrocytes (Luna et al., 2010; Sakai et al., 2003), or
by proliferation (Fisher et al., 1991; Panagis et al., 2005). These
previously observed injury responses by astrocytes appear to
have little to no long-term impact on their spatial distribution
relative to the vasculature, indicating that a speciﬁc spatial con-
ﬁguration of astrocytes may be required for healthy function of
the retina. These results lend insight into biological processes that
are occurring in an adult retina.

There are signiﬁcant broader implications of our proposed
method as well. The geodesic distance in our method is not re-
stricted to radial vascular structures; it only requires a reference
point. Therefore, it can be used on other vascular networks, such
as the brain vascular network, or even complete organisms where
the entire vasculature is observable. In addition, many other

biological tissues exhibit similar structure and relationships to
those encountered in the retina. Our feature space and quantiﬁ-
cation methodology can be used to study spatial relationships in
these domains as well.

For instance, connectomes of neurons and glial cells (LoTurco,
2000; Anderson et al., 2011) contain large continuous structures
similar to the vasculature and are often spatially correlated with
other cells or entities (Leergaard et al., 2012; Sporns, 2011). The
geodesic feature space can be adapted for neuronal axons or cir-
cuitry; a common physiological or anatomical reference point can
be used in lieu of the optic nerve (e.g. cell soma), along with axonal
width or any other spatially correlated structural feature. The
locations of other nearby cells can then be converted into this
geodesic space (now based on neurons), and the spatial correl-
ation between cells and neuronal structure can be quantiﬁed in a
similar manner to astrocytes and the vasculature.

There have also been efforts to quantify the structure of neu-
rons using methods similar to our proposed method. These
methods attempt to characterize the morphology of neuronal
structures using topological features, such as diameter, path
length or branching factors (Brown et al., 2008; Cuntz et al.,
2007; Vonhoff and Duch, 2010). While these approaches are
not speciﬁcally designed to measure spatial correlation, they
can be incorporated into our method as an additional histogram
dimension. For instance, Sholl analysis (Sholl, 1953) could be
used in conjunction with soma distance and dendrite width to
measure spatial correlation between neurons and other biological
features using our method.

Finally, our methodology will provide further insight into the
biological processes in the retina. Spatial correlation can be stu-
died using our method in new experimental conditions, such as
development or disease. These additional spatial studies of
retinal conditions, as well as spatial studies on tissues with similar
structure, are promising avenues of future research efforts.

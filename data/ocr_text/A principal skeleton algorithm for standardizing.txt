ABSTRACT

Motivation: The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a commonly
used model organism in biology. We are currently building a 3D digital
atlas of the fruit fly larval nervous system (LNS) based on a large
collection of fly larva GAL4 lines, each of which targets a subset of
neurons. To achieve such a goal, we need to automatically align a
number of high-resolution confocal image stacks of these GAL4 lines.
One commonly employed strategy in image pattern registration is to
first globally align images using an affine transform, followed by local
non-linear warping. Unfortunately, the spatially articulated and often
twisted LNS makes it difficult to globally align the images directly
using the affine method. In a parallel project to build a 3D digital
map of the adult fly ventral nerve cord (VNC), we are confronted with
a similar problem.

Results: We proposed to standardize a larval image by best
aligning its principal skeleton (PS), and thus used this method as
an alternative of the usually considered affine alignment. The PS
of a shape was defined as a series of connected polylines that
spans the entire shape as broadly as possible, but with the shortest
overall length. We developed an automatic PS detection algorithm to
robustly detect the PS from an image. Then for a pair of larval images,
we designed an automatic image registration method to align their
PSs and the entire images simultaneously. Our experimental results
on both simulated images and real datasets showed that our method
does not only produce satisfactory results for real confocal larval
images, but also perform robustly and consistently when there is a
lot of noise in the data. We also applied this method successfully
to confocal images of some other patterns such as the adult fruit
fly VNC and center brain, which have more complicated PS. This
demonstrates the flexibility and extensibility of our method.

1 INTRODUCTION

The fruit ﬂy (Drosophila melanogaster) is one of most studied
model organisms in biology. It is currently widely used to understand
how a real nervous system works. A systems biology approach that
we are taking to study the fruit ﬂy brain is to produce 3D digital
atlases of this animal’s nervous system at various developmental
time points, including adult, larval and embryonic stages. We have
been taking advantage of an on— going effort to generate a collection
of 8000 enhancer—trap GAL4 lines that would have their neuronal
patterns cover the entire set of neurons in the fruit ﬂy nervous
system (Pfeiffer et al., 2008). High—resolution 3D confocal images
of these GAL4 lines were produced. The scale of the problem is
large, in terms of both the large size of each 3D confocal image
(hundreds of megabytes to multi—gigabytes each) and the large
number of the images in the database (two to ﬁve times the number
of GAL4 lines, as multiple ﬂies of the same GAL4 line need to
be imaged). Therefore, an informatics challenge is how to map the
neuronal patterns onto a ‘standard’ brain in an accurate, reliable and
automatic way.

A brain mapping study needs several enabling techniques,
including 3D image registration (alignment), neurite tracing,
neuronal pattern classiﬁcation, visualization and mining methods
(Peng, 2008). It is often critical to align image patterns that
have various orientations, sizes, shape deformations and intensity
changes. A classic routine for 3D image pattern registration is to ﬁrst
align patterns globally, followed by a local alignment to transform
one pattern to the other (Rueckert et al., 1999; Toga, 1999). For
a pair of image patterns, the purpose of the global alignment
is to standardize the patterns as a whole so that they possess
similar scales, positions and directions. The afﬁne transformation
is commonly used for global alignment. Once two patterns have
been roughly aligned globally, it is much easier to use the more
sophisticated local alignment (e.g. Rueckert et al., 1999; Sorzano
et al., 2005), which is often non—linear and deformable, to register
the patterns precisely. The afﬁne alignment was already successfully
used in recent efforts to build digitized atlases for model animals,
such as the Allen mouse brain atlas (Lein et al., 2007), the adult
fruit ﬂy brain atlas (unpublished work of Peng lab) and the single—
nucleus resolution atlas of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
(Long et al., 2009).

However, for the alignment problem of the fruit ﬂy larval nervous
system (LNS) in this article, we found that the global afﬁne
alignment can hardly be used. As shown in Figure 1a, in the
LNS the two brain hemispheres and the ventral nerve cord (VNC)
form an articulated structure, which is ﬂexible and often skews
toward one side. This deformation cannot be described using global

rotation, translation, scaling and shear as used in the afﬁne transform.
Figure 1c, which is an example of the adult VNC, displays a similar
deformation of the shape. Therefore, we need a more sophisticated
global alignment method to standardize the shape of these patterns,
before we can proceed further to the local alignment.

Intuitively, we considered aligning the ‘backbone’, or ‘mid—line’,
of a curved fruit ﬂy LNS or an adult VNC (red skeletons in Fig. 1).
A related study was to straighten the strongly curved body of
Celegans (Peng et al., 2008) by ﬁrst detecting the curved anterior—
posterior axis of a worm, and then restacking the resampled image
data on the entire series of 1—pixel spacing cutting—planes orthogonal
to such a detected ‘backbone’. This earlier method is very efﬁcient
for Celegans confocal images and other similar cases where the
backbone is a simple smooth curve, and the body of the pattern is
not fat (wide) enough so that the slightly non—parallel cutting planes
next to each other will not intersect within the pattern. Unfortunately,
this method cannot be directly used in standardizing a fruit ﬂy
larval pattern because the articulated pattern cannot be described
as a simple curve, and the fruit ﬂy patterns are often fat/wide
enough so that restacking the cutting planes may introduce artifacts
especially in the articulated image regions. There are several other
skeleton extraction methods (Brandt et al., 1992; Chuang et al.,
2004; Lam et al., 1992; Malandain et al., 1998). However, they
cannot easily produce skeletons of the same topological structure
for different input images, and thus will not be very useful for the
registration.

Therefore, in this work we proposed a new approach to
standardize the confocal images of fruit ﬂy LNS and adult VNC. We
detected the principal skeleton (PS) of a shape using an automatic

skeleton deformation algorithm (Section 2). Then we designed a
smooth warping method to best align the PS of a pair of image
patterns (Section 3). Our method introduces a minimum amount
of degradation of the image quality during the standardization.
It is also robust under a variety of conditions. In addition, our
method is general. It is not limited to ﬂy larval patterns; indeed
it can be applied to any image patterns that have a reasonable PS1
(Section 4).

2 DETECTING PS

Intuitively, the PS of a shape can be understood as its ‘backbone’,
which describes the basic structure as well as the major deformation
of this shape. In this article, we deﬁne the PS as a set of connected
polylines that spans the entire shape as broadly as possible and at the
same time has the shortest overall length and sufﬁcient smoothness.
We call each polyline a segment. Each segment consists of multiple
ordered control points.

Let us use the LNS (Fig. 1a) as an example. We view the nervous
system as an articulated composition of three main parts: VNC,
and left and right brain hemispheres. Despite the complexity in
the articulation region, the deformation within each part can be
approximated using a gentler curve. We deﬁne the PS of the LNS as
a structure with six segments, including three branching segments,
which represent the VNC, and left and right hemispheres, joined
to another three segments of a triangle that models the ‘hole’
where the non—neuronal tissues (gut and heart) pass through the
articulation area.

Naturally, the PS can be viewed as a conceptual extension of
the simple ‘backbone’ curve of a C. elegans body (Peng et al.,
2008), which is essentially the principal curve (Hastie, 1994) of
a distribution of image pixels. However, the PS is more than a
simple collection of multiple principal curves due to the connection
of segments. In addition, instead of using a smooth curve to model
each skeleton segment, without loss of generality, we model them
by polylines. The control points in a polyline can be further used to
ﬁt a smooth cubic—spline curve (Bartels et al., 1998), similar to the
C. elegans case.

Similar to the case of LNS, the PS of a fruit ﬂy adult VNC can
be deﬁned as an ¥—shape (Fig. lc). The same algorithm is used to
ﬁnd the PSs for both cases. Throughout this article, we focus on
LNS; experimental results on adult VNC and some other cases will
be presented at the end of this article, and the corresponding movies
can be found in the Supplementary Material.

2.1 Shape prior of larval PS

The shape prior deﬁnes the initial PS including its topology and
constraints of its segments and control points. It should be as simple
as possible but complicated enough to capture the major topology
of the shape. During the optimization, which is described below, the
topology of a PS remains unchanged; however, the locations of all
segment—control points will be iteratively updated.

The shape prior of LNS is deﬁned in Figure 2. It contains totally
11 control points cl, ..., 611, which are arranged as 6 segments
B1, ...,B6 in Equation (1). The control points C3, C4, and C7 join

 

1Some image patterns may not have a uniquely well—deﬁned principal
skeleton, such as a spherical cell that has the uniform intensity.

B3={C7,68,C9,610,611} (1)
B4={C3,C4}
BS :{63767}
36={C4,C7}

We minimize the length of each segment. Sometimes we may need to
minimize the overall length of multiple segments, which indeed has a
similar effect to maximizing the total smoothness of these segments
when their length is short enough. For example, for the LNS, we
would like to produce a very smooth skeleton for the junction area
of the two brain hemispheres, which contains three segments B1, B4
and BZ. This is similar to forcing Bl , B4 and 32 to line up in an almost
straight line; thus, their total length is as short as possible. To attain
this goal, in Equation (2) we deﬁne four optimization ‘domains’
D1, ..., D4, each of which is a polyline and may cover multiple
segments (e.g. D1).

D1 2B1 UB4 UB2={61,62,C3,C4,C5,C6}
D2=B3={C7,68,C9,610,611} (2)
D3=Bs={c3,c7}

D4=B6={C4,C7}

2.2 Energy minimizing deformable PS model

We design a deformable model to detect the PS, given its shape prior.
We formulate an energy function consisting of an external energy
term and an internal energy term. The external term is based on the
image information, thus also called the ‘image term’, to force the
PS spanning as broadly as possible to cover an entire LNS. The
internal term is based on the topology and constraints of skeleton
domains; this term is minimized to guarantee the least total length
and maximum smoothness of the skeleton.

Let [9 denote an image pixel, W the image area and $2 the set of all
control points of skeleton. The Voronoi region (9(6)) of the control
point C,- is deﬁned as the set of pixels in W that are closer to c,- than
to any other control points:

@(Ci)={P€WIVCj€9,IICi—P||<IICj—PH} (3)

We deﬁne the external term Eextemal as:

Eexternal = 2 “Ci _ 0(@(Ci))|

CiEQ

2

 

, (4)

where 0(9) denotes the center of mass of a Voronoi region Q.

We deﬁne the internal energy term by aggregating all optimization
domains deﬁned in Equation (2). Since there are only a few control
points in each domain (e.g. ﬁve in D2and six in D1), minimizing
their length has a comparable effect to smoothing. For simplicity,
we only aggregate the length energy of each domain in the internal
term. Let U 2 {D1, D2, D3, D4} be the set of domain, we have:

Einternal : Z; Z W(Dk)Elength(Dk)a (5)
W(Dk) D 6U

DkeU k
where w(Dk) is a coefﬁcient that deﬁnes the contribution of domain
Dk. For LNS, due to the vertical asymmetry of the shape prior, in
order to avoid point C3 and C4 will be pulled downwards seriously by
D3 and D4, we giveD1 more weight (w(D1) = 10, all other weights
equal 1). For a general case, the weights can be uniform. Elength (Dk)

in Equation (6) denotes the length of domain Dk:

|D| — 1
Elengthw): 2 “MM —D[n+1]u2, (6)
n=l
where D[n] is the n—th element (control point) in domain D.
The overall energy E takes the form:

E : O‘Eextemal 1‘ IBEinternal ’ (7)

where at and ,8 are two positive coefﬁcients (both equal 0.5 in our
experiments).

To minimize Equation (7), we solve the following equation for
every Ci, i: 1, ...,11:

8_E :0! 8Eexternal +18 8Einternal :0. (8)
Be,- Be,- Be,-

It is easy to derive an iterative optimization method from
Equation (8) to estimate the new location of each non—tip control
point, cg“, based on the Voronoi region’s center of mass of its
current position cg, and the positions of its connected neighbor
control points:

, (9)

where N (cl-)2: DkE U, Cie Dk w(Dk) and P(D,cl-) denotes the set of
neighboring control points of c,- in domain D (in our case, since each
domain is a polyline, this set includes both the left and right control
points of Ci). Note that P(D,cl-) is null if cl- ¢ D.

For the end points of the PS, i.e. Cl, 66 and 611, we use
an empirically more robust formula based on two respective
neighboring control points. Let us use cl as an example, the
simpliﬁed formula is:

CH1: on(®(ct1))—l—,B(2ct2 — 6%)
1 oz-l—ﬂ

Other end points can be updated similarly. Normally, the
algorithm converges within 100 loops.

We have implemented the PS detection method as a plugin of
the V3D software (http://penglab.janelia.org/proj/v3d; Peng et al.,
2010). We provide a tutorial in the Supplementary Material on how
to use the program.

3 ALIGNING PSS

Since the PS of a ﬂy LNS has a more complicated topology than the
simple curved ‘backbone’ of nematode Celegans, we cannot simply
reuse the cutting—plane restacking strategy in the earlier work (Peng
et al., 2008) to standardize an LNS image. Instead, we generate a
smooth displacement ﬁeld (DF) to warp the ﬂy larvae from one to
another, based on their PS information.

There are three general requirements of a DF. (i) No singularity.
Thus, the DF should be smooth everywhere. (ii) There should be
a minimum amount of distortion to geometrically warp the PS, as
well as the entire LNS. (iii) The algorithm should be extensible to
other PSs; at the same time, when a PS consists of only one segment,
the standardization should approximate the cutting—plane restacking
method.

We produce a DF using thin plate spline (TPS; Bookstein, 1989),
which is deﬁned as the least—bending smooth surface spanning a set
of anchor points. Thus, the requirements (i) and (ii) are met naturally.
For requirement (iii), we ﬁrst consider all control points of the PS as
TPS anchor points. Then, we use cubic spline to ﬁnd a smooth curve
through each domain of the PS (as shown in Fig. 3a), and then for
every consecutive pair of control points, we add the halfway point on
the smooth curve as a TPS anchor point. We call the set of anchor
points that consists of nicely spaced points on the PS as the PS—
set. Next, we deﬁne additional anchor points based on this PS—set:
for each PS—set anchor point, we compute the orthogonal cutting
line that intersects at this anchor point location with the respective
smooth curve in the PS, and then we deﬁne two anchor points on
each of the left and right sides of the cutting line (spacing = 75 pixels
for LNS). We call the set of anchor points that are not on the PS as the
non—PS—set. If a non—PS—set anchor point falls into the intersection
region of multiple cutting lines of different domains (as highlighted
in Fig. 3a), we remove it from the set of the all anchor points, and
thus avoid the non—smooth wrapping around of the DF.

While the choices of the number of anchor points of both PS—
set and non—PS—set, as well as the spacing among anchoring points,

are empirical, a general guideline is to make the anchoring points
distribute evenly to cover the entire image pattern. The selected
parameters are then used for all images.

The entire algorithm for LNS standardization is as follows:

(1) Deﬁne/initialize the shape prior of PS.

(2) Find the Voronoi region of each control point in an input
image (called ‘subject’ image below for simplicity).

(3) Update the positions of control points using Equations (9)
and (10).

(4) Check whether or not the positions of control points have
converged (i.e. the maximal distance between the new and
old positions of control points is <0.01). If yes, go to Step 5.
Otherwise go back to Step 2.

(5) Use cubic spline to interpolate PS and produce a smooth
skeleton according to the deﬁned domains.

(6) Deﬁne both the PS—set and non—PS—set of TPS anchor points,
remove some non—PS—set points if they fall into the cutting
line overlapping/intersection region.

(7) Compute the TPS DF of this image using the corresponding
anchor points between this image and a predeﬁned target
image.

(8) Warp the subject image to a ‘standard’ shape using the DF.

(9) Set the warped (standardized) subject image as the input
image and repeat Steps 1—8 until the PS of the image does not
vary signiﬁcantly (deﬁned as the average displace of control
points between two consequent iteration <3 pixels).

Our standardization method is general; it can be applied to both
2D and 3D image patterns. For fruit ﬂy LNS, although our image
stacks are 3D, the major variation of the shape is in the 2D plane
of two brain hemispheres and the VNC. Therefore, we simplify the
processing using 2D maximum intensity projection, and detect the
PS in 2D. Accordingly, the TPS DF is produced in 2D; all z—sections
of a ﬂy LNS image stack will share the same DF.

Of note, in our algorithm it is necessary to consider Step 9, i.e. the
iterative alignment of a PS. Because TPS warping is non—linear and
will cause some regions expand or shrink smoothly, the redetected
PS of a warped image is slightly different from that of target image.
Several iterations of the optimization will produce nicely aligned
image patterns whose PSs match well. Normally, it takes about three
loops to generate satisfactorily aligned PSs (Section 4.4).

4 EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSION

We ﬁrst evaluated the robustness and consistency of the PS detection
algorithm, and then compared our method with the commonly
used morphological thinning and afﬁne—transform—based alignment
method. In the end, we show some PS detection results of other
cases.

For the fruit ﬂy larva data, N—cadherin—labeled LNS was imaged
in 3D using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM
510) in the laboratory of J. Truman. The voxel resolution is
0.46 X0.46X2.0ILII1. For the adult ﬂy VNC data, NC—labeled
VNC was imaged using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM
Pascal 5) in J. Simpson’s laboratory. The voxel resolution is
0.58 X 0.58 X 0.8 pm in 3D.

4.1 Robustness

We tested the robustness of detecting the PS when the LNS patterns
in images have different orientations, scales, contrasts, articulated
and twisted parts, as well as other noises.

Figure 4a shows robustness test results for the twisted LNS. We
simulated the deformation by rotating the right brain hemisphere
from —45° to 45°, with a 15° interval, to produce seven rows from
top to bottom. For every row, we rotated the VNC from —45° to
45° similarly to produce seven columns. The detected PSs (red)
from the same initialization (green) are correct, indicating that our
method is robust for twisted patterns. We further added noise to the
test images and changed the scale of the initialization. The results
(Supplementary Material) were also robust.

Figure 4b shows a perturbation test based on real LNS images.
We randomly selected four LNS images that have differently twisted
nervous systems. Similarly to Figure 4a, we rotated them with
different angles (—45°, —30°, —15°, 0°, 15°, 30° and 45°). From

exactly the same initialization (green), our algorithm successfully
detected the PSs (red), except two errors in the left—bottom corner
and in the last column of the third row, which correspond to —45°
and +45° rotations, respectively. The errors occurred when the angle
between the longest axis (along the brain—VNC direction) of an LNS
and the initialization of the PS is bigger than 45°, the VNC part
of the larva would more likely be interpreted as Bl or 32 rather
than B3 according to the shape prior we assumed in Section 2. In
other words, the PS was initialized too poorly. However, practically
speaking, this situation is rare in the real data. We can also avoid
it completely by preprocessing an image so that its longest axis is
roughly aligned with the B3 segment. We also changed the contrast
of the test images and found that our method robustly produced
meaningful results (Supplementary Material).

4.2 Consistency

We quantiﬁed the consistency of PS detection given different
initializations. For four LNS images, we rotated the respective initial
shape prior of the PS in the range of :l:30° (interval = 15°). For any
pair of the ﬁve PSs detected for each image, we computed the mean
square error (MSE) of the corresponding control points of this pair
of skeletons. Table 1 shows the maximal and average MSE scores for
all possible pairs. The MSE scores are much < 1 pixel, indicating that
PSs were detected very consistently from different initializations.

4.3 Comparison with morphology thinning

Morphology thinning (Lam et al., 1992) is a commonly used
algorithm to extract the ‘backbone’ of an image object that has closed
contour. In order to use thinning, one needs to ﬁrst segment the object
from the image background. Unfortunately, the thinning algorithm
is very sensitive to the segmentation. As shown in Figure 5a,
direct thinning on a binary image generated too many artiﬁcial
branches due to spurs in the contour of the object and unstained
areas (holes). Here, we simply took the foreground as the set of the
pixels whose intensity was above the mean value of all pixels in the
image. After we carefully smoothed the contour and ﬁlled the holes
using additional morphological opening and closing operations (with
morphological element set to be ‘disk’ shape, with 10 and 20 pixels
in diameter, respectively), we achieved better thinning results in
Figure 5b and c, which however were still not as good as the detected
PS in Figure 5d.

4.4 Standardization of real LNS images

As a real application, we used the PS method to standardize a
randomly selected set of 237 3D confocal images of the third instar

approximated by an afﬁne transformation. On the contrary, the PS—
based standardization scheme (Fig. 6c and f) successfully registered
all images, with the PSs almost exactly overlapping on top of each
other.

We also quantiﬁed the spatial variations of the aligned PSs. As
explained at the end of Section 3, the iterative optimization of the
PS standardization, i.e. Step 9, is important. Figure 6g—i show that
with 1, 2 and 3 iterations, the standard deviation of the entire set
of PSs became smaller and smaller. Indeed, the average ‘pair—wise
distance’ of the entire population of PSs dropped from 50.225 pixels
before standardization to 5.661, 3.220 and 2.323 pixels in three
iterations. For a better visualization, see the Supplementary Material
for large frame—size movies of this experiment.

4.5 Quality of standardized images

We also visually inspected the image quality of an LNS pattern
before and after our standardization process. Figure 7 shows that
all the local features of an image before standardization (Fig. 7a
and b) were well preserved in the post—standardization image (Fig. 7c
and d). No visible artifact was seen. The processed image was a
little bit smoother, due to the interpolation process during the TPS
warping. The overall loss of information was negligible.

4.6 Results of adult fruit ﬂy VNC and others patterns

By modifying the shape prior of the PS, our algorithm can be
easily adapted to other shape analysis applications. For example,
in Figure 1c and d, we show that the PS method can be used to
standardize an adult fruit ﬂy VNC. Indeed the adult VNC has a
more complicated shape prior, which has nine segments and seven
optimization domains (Fig. 8a), than an LNS.

Similar to the LNS case, the key to standardizing an adult
VNC is to detect the PS robustly. Figure 8b shows the results
on ﬁve arbitrarily selected adult VNC patterns (data from
J. Simpson laboratory; NC82 neuropile staining was used in place of
N—cadherin). It is evident that our algorithm (upper row of Fig. 8b)
detected meaningful PSs, while the image thinning (lower row,
Fig. 8b) produced results that were not very useful. Figure 8c and d

 

shows additional PS detection results of adult fruit ﬂy center brain
and C.elegans. It can be noted that even when the PS was poorly
initialized to even outside the object in the C. elegans case (Fig. 8d),
our method still detected reasonable PS. Additional PS deformation
movies can be found in the Supplementary Material.

One potential problem of our PS approach is that, when a skeleton
becomes more complicated, the deformation to the optimum may
be more likely trapped into local minima. Generally speaking, this
requires more careful initialization. One solution is to introduce
hierarchical domains in optimization. Taking the adult VNC as an
example, we can make our algorithm more robust by ﬁrst optimizing
the skeleton of the main trunk (i.e. the horizontal domain in Fig. 8a)
so that we can get a good estimation of the scale, position and
the orientation of the VNC, and then optimizing the remaining
domains/segments to complete the entire skeleton.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and
gene expression. Although nucleosome formation is known to be af-
fected by primary DNA sequence composition, no sequence signature
has been identified for histone modifications. It is known that dense
H3K4me3 nucleosome sites are accompanied by a low density of
other nucleosomes and are associated with gene activation. This ob-
servation suggests a different sequence composition of H3K4me3
from other nucleosomes.

Approach: To understand the relationship between genome se-
quence and chromatin structure, we studied DNA sequences at his-
tone modification sites in various human cell types. We found
sequence specificity for H3K4me3, but not for other histone modifica-
tions. Using the sequence specificities of H3 and H3K4me3 nucleo-
somes, we developed a model that computes the probability of
H3K4me3 occupation at each base pair from the genome sequence
context.

Results: A comparison of our predictions with experimental data sug-
gests a high performance of our method, revealing a strong associ-
ation between H3K4me3 and specific genomic DNA context. The high
probability of H3K4me3 occupation occurs at transcription start and
termination sites, exon boundaries and binding sites of transcription
regulators involved in chromatin modification activities, including his-
tone acetylases and enhancer- and insulator-associated factors. Thus,
the human genome sequence contains signatures for chromatin modi-
fications essential for gene regulation and development. Our method
may be applied to find new sequence elements functioning by chro-
matin modulation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chromatin remodeling mediated by histone modiﬁcations is an
important mechanism for speciﬁc gene expression (Ha et al.,
2011). However, the relationship between genome sequence

and chromatin remodeling is not well understood. Although
DNA sequence preferences for nucleosome formation have
been known since the mid 1980s (Drew and Travers, 1985;
Struhl, 1985; Yuan et al., 2005), the role of histone—DNA inter-
action in nucleosome formation is subjected to debate (Kaplan et
al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). The interplay between transcription
factors (TFs) and adenosine triphosphate—dependent chromatin
modulating factors in regulating histone modiﬁcations implies
that histone modiﬁcations do not follow the sequence prefer-
ences of the general H3 nucleosomes or the other nucleosomes
that are not trimethylated at H3K4 (Berger, 2007; J enuwein and
Allis, 2001; Matthews at al., 2007). Indeed, the H3K4me3 nu-
cleosome is preferentially enriched in the genomic regions show-
ing a low density of other nucleosomes and marks an open
chromatin region. The advance of DNA sequencing technology
with immunoprecipitated DNA segment associated with speciﬁc
histone modiﬁcations allows us to examine the DNA sequence
compositions speciﬁc to histone modiﬁcations in an unbiased
way. Therefore, we extracted DNA sequences of nucleosomes
carrying individual histone modiﬁcations from ChIP—seq data
(Barski et al., 2007; Cui et al., 2009; Hawkins et al., 2010;
Lister et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2008, 2009b) and identiﬁed
the features of sequences bound to histone modiﬁcations
in ChIP—seq experiments. Using the identiﬁed sequence speciﬁ-
cities of H3K4me3 and H3 nucleosomes, we developed a model
to compute the probabilities of H3K4me3 and H3 nucleosome
occupation from the genome sequence context. H3K4me3
ChIP—seq data in various human cells indicate that the loci pre-
dicted by our model to have a high probability of the H3K4me3
sequence signature are preferentially occupied by H3K4me3 nu-
cleosome. Our study provides a method for investigating the
DNA sequence features of chromatin structure. Furthermore,
our analyses show that the human genome sequence contains
signals for chromatin remodeling at epigenetic regulatory
elements.

2 METHODS
2.1 ChIP-seq data sources

The ChIP-seq data of H3 nucleosomes in two different conditions of
human CD4+T cells were obtained from Schones et a]. (2008). The
ChIP-seq data of CTCF, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3,
H3K27me3, RNA Pol II in human CD4+T cells, CD133+ and

CD36+ cells were obtained from Barski et al. (2007) and Cui et al.
(2009). Methyl-bisulﬁte sequencing data and ChIP-seq data of various
histone methylations in human embryonic stem cells (HESC) are from
Lister et al. (2009) and Hawkins et al. (2010). The ChIP-seq data of
histone acetylases, deacetylases and acetylations are from Wang et al.
(2008, 2009b).

2.2 Identiﬁcation of sequence speciﬁcities of nucleosome
modiﬁcations

The 30—50 bp sequences from the ChIP-seq data are mapped to the
February 2009 human reference sequence (GRCh37/hgl9) by perfect
and unique match without allowing any mismatch or gap. To recover
nucleosomal DNA fragments, each read was extended toward its 3’ -end
by 151 bp; the 30—50 bp reads are from the ends of both strands in nu-
cleosome DNAs. The possible range of the ends of nucleosome-bound
DNAs may be wider than that of micrococal nuclease-treated DNAs.
Therefore, we consider 151 bp nucleosome-bound DNA regions, and
from these regions, we estimate the frequencies of monomer, 2, 3, 4, 5
and 6mer sequences for each histone modiﬁcation and each cell type. The
sequence frequencies are normalized by the sequence composition in the
reference genome sequence (hgl9/GRCh37) to account for bias because
of genome sequence composition. In this way, we estimate the enrichment
of nucleosomes at every sequence composition.

2.3 A probabilistic model of H3 and H3K4me3
nucleosome occupation in a genome

The occurrence of an H3 or H3K4me3 nucleosome at a genomic site can
be affected by adjacent sequences or adjacent nucleosomes. Across a
genome, we calculate the probability that a nucleosome (H3 or
H3K4me3) locates at a locus by using the modiﬁed ﬁfth order hidden
Markov model (HMM) (Rabiner, 1989). This model considers possible
arrangements in view of the competition with adjacent nucleosomes in
evaluating the forward and backward status and sequence composition of
thel47 bp sequence.

2.3.] Forward procedure Using the forward procedure, we calculate
the probability of each status at the ith position considering the genome
sequence from the ﬁrst bp S1 to S,.

nucleosome.

N,: The ith base pair the DNA sequence of an H3 nucleosome.

and S, is the ith bp of the DNA sequence of an H3K4me3 nucleosome.

and S, is the ith bp of the DNA sequence of an H3 nucleosome.

S, is not bound by any H3 or H3K4me3 nucleosome.

2.4 In vivo coverage of modiﬁed nucleosomes at a
base pair

The ChIP-seq reads obtained from published data were mapped to the
human genome sequence (hgl9). Each 30—50 bp read perfectly matching
the genome sequence only once was extended to 151 bp from the 5’ -end of
the read because the immunoprecipitated DNA fragments are 150 bp in
length. The coverage of each histone modiﬁcation at a base pair position
was estimated by the number of extended reads covering that position. As
the coverage is dependent on the depth of ChIP-seq, we use correlation
coefﬁcients that are standardized by standard deviations. The compari-
sons were made in the mappable genomic regions.

2.5 Comparison of the probabilistic H3K4me3
occupation map with in vivo data

To validate the predicted H3K4me3 occupation map, we calculate the

correlation coefﬁcient between the probability of H3K4me3 occupation

at each base pair in the human reference genome (hgl9/GRC37) and the

in vivo coverage of H3K4me3 using ChIP-seq reads.

2.6 Identiﬁcation of TF-binding sites and inter-chromatin
interaction sites

The ER—ot-bound human chromatin interaction sites were obtained from
the ChIA-PET data in hgl8 (Fullwood et al., 2009) and transferred to
hg19 using liftOver. The AR— and FoxAl-binding sites in prostate cancer
cells identiﬁed by Wang et al. (2009a) and Lupien et al. (2008) were
transferred to hgl9 using liftOver. NANOG-, OCT-, SOX2-, KLF4-
and TAFl-binding sites in embryonic stem cells identiﬁed by Lister
et al. (2009) were moved to hgl9 using liftOver.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Sequence speciﬁcities of nucleosome modiﬁcations

We compared position-speciﬁc dinucleotide frequencies between
H3 and H3K4me3 nucleosomal DNA sequences. H3K4me3-
bound DNA sequences show a 10 bp periodicity of dinucleotide
frequencies, but different amplitudes from H3 nucleosome-
bound DNA (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2) (Satchwell et al.,
1986; Segal et al., 2006). In addition to the 10bp periodicity,
position-speciﬁc frequencies of each dinucleotide are within spe-
ciﬁc discrete ranges and differ from those of H3 nucleosomes
(Fig. l; paired t-tests, P—values % 0 for CG frequencies in H3
versus H3K4me3, GC in H3 versus H3K4me3, CC/GG in H3
versus H3K4me3, AG/CT in H3 versus H3K4me3, AC/GT in

genomic sequences was calculated at each position using 3 bp windows.

versus H3K4me3, GA/TC in H3 versus H3K4me3, TA in H3
versus H3K4me3, AA/TT in H3 versus H3K4me3).

The different dimer sequence frequencies between H3 and
H3K4me3 nucleosomes imply that an n-mer (n>2) sequence
composition can be a distinct feature of H3K4me3 nucleosomes.
We studied 6mer sequences in histone methylations because 6mer
sequences are long enough to represent sequence preferences,
and the computation is still feasible. The distinct sequence pref-
erences of H3K4me3 and H3 nucleosome are well reﬂected in
6mer sequence speciﬁcities and are consistently found in various
cell types (Fig. 2a and b, r 2 0.98, P: 0). In contrast, H3K4me1
and H3K27me3 nucleosomes show no consistent sequence pref-
erences among cell types (Fig. 2d and e). The preferred 6mer
DNA sequences of H3K4me3 show only a weak correlation
with H3 nucleosome sequence preferences (Fig. 2c, r=0.24,
P = 0), indicating that H3K4me3 modiﬁcation uses a mechanism
different from that of any other nucleosome.

To examine whether the sequence speciﬁcities differ between
promoters and non-promoter regions, we calculated sequence
speciﬁcities of histone modiﬁcations in the promoters and non-
promoter regions. We found that the sequence speciﬁcities of
histone modiﬁcations are highly signiﬁcantly correlated between
promoters and non-promoter regions (Supplementary Fig. S5),
implying that the 6mer sequence speciﬁcities of H3K4me3 are
consistently maintained across the genome.

3.2 A probabilistic model for an H3K4me3 occupation
map in the human primary genome sequence

Using the aforementioned sequence speciﬁcities of H3K4me3
and H3 nucleosomes, we can compute the probability,
P(H3K4me3 |S), that a given 147 bp or shorter sequence seg-
ment (S) is an H3K4me3 nucleosome site, and also P(H3 IS)
(Fig. 3). In principle, a base pair in the genome sequence can
be the ith bp of the DNA sequence of a nucleosome
(i = l, . . . , 147). However, at each time at most only one nucleo-
some can occur at a base position. To consider various possible
arrangements of nucleosomes occupying a site, we constructed a
modiﬁed 5th order (HMM of H3K4me3 and H3 nucleosome
occupation (Fig. 3). Our model calculates the probability of

Fig. 2. H3K4me3 shows consistent and distinct sequence speciﬁcity
among various human cell types, whereas other modiﬁed nucleosomes
do not. (a—e) The correlations of the 6mer speciﬁcities in H3K4me3 nu-
cleosomes (a), in H3 nucleosomes (b), between H3K4me3 and H3 nu-
cleosomes (c), in H3K4me1 nucleosomes (d) and in H3K27me3
nucleosomes (e). The nucleosome-bound DNAs were identiﬁed using
the ChIP-seq data from various cell types: CD4+T cells in resting
state (CD4+Rest), CD4+T cells in activated state (CD4+Act),
CD36+erythrocyte stem cell (CD36+), CD133+, HESC and HeLa
cells. The values in the squares represent correlation coefﬁcients of
6mer sequence preference between two cell types. The red stars in a
square signify that the correlation is highly signiﬁcant, with the P—value
close to 0. The vertical and horizontal axes represent the number of ChIP-
seq reads covering the 6mer normalized by the number of 6mers in the
human genome. Each point represents the enrichment of a 6mer in the
ChIP-seq experiments in two cell types. The cell types on the x-axis and
y-axis are marked on the main diagonal

every possible arrangement of H3K4me3 and H3 nucleosomes
on the whole genome. It distinguishes between H3K4me3 and
H3 nucleosomes and integrates all possible arrangements based
on forward and backward sequences of every base pair (Fig. 3).
Ultimately, our model calculates the sum of the probabilities of
all possible H3K4me3 and H3 nucleosomes that can potentially
cover the base pair (see Section 2). If the loci associated with a
high probability of H3K4me3 nucleosome occupation becomes
signiﬁcantly long, the genomic region may be considered to be
fuzzy nucleosome sites as many previous research articles did,
including Yuan et al. (2005) and Segal et al. (2006)
(Supplementary Fig. S6).

3.3 Association of the genome sequence context and the

Fig. 3. Flow chart to compute the probabilities of H3K4me3 and H3
nucleosome occupation at each base pair in the human genome. (a) First,
the sequence speciﬁcities of H3K4me3 and H3 nucleosomes on 6mer
sequences are inferred using in vivo ChIP-seq data. Second, the sequence
speciﬁcities are used to compute the probability that a given sequence S of
147 bp is a potential H3K4me3 nucleosome site and the corresponding
probability for an H3 nucleosome site without H3K4me3. Third, a mod-
iﬁed ﬁfth order HMM is constructed to compute the probabilities that a
given base pair in the human genome is covered by an H3K4me3 nucleo-
some or an H3 nucleosome. (b) The probability of occupation at a base
pair is the sum of the occupation probabilities of all the nucleosomes that
can occupy the base pair

prediction of H3K4me3 occupation of a locus with the occupa-
tion level from ChIP-seq experiments. As ChIP-seq experiments
cannot provide lbp resolution localization of nucleosomes, we
use the probabilistic occupation level of H3K4me3 nucleosome
and the number of ChIP-seq reads covering the locus. We found
several lines of evidence for a signiﬁcant correlation between our
sequence-based prediction of H3K4me3 occupation and the ex-
perimental data. First, the 5’-ends of the E2F2 and GAPDH
genes have been experimentally shown to carry a high level of
H3K4me3 (Steward et al., 2006), and our model indeed predicts
that these genomic regions have a high probability of H3K4me3
occupation (E2F2, r=0.73, n=3 X104bp; GAPDH, r=0.76,
n=6 x 103 bp) (Fig. 4a and b). The correlation coefﬁcients of
coverage at a base pair resolution are within the ranges observed
in biological replications (Leleu et al., 2010).

Second, we compare the probability of a base pair being cov-
ered by H3K4me3 and the number of reads covering the base
pair in ChIP-seq experiments in various cell types. The probabil-
ity correlates well with the in vivo occupancy of H3K4me3 at
each base pair in the 2.5 x 109 bp mappable genomic region,
estimated from ChIP-seq data in diverse cell types, including
embryonic stem cells (HESC, r=0.83, P=0, n=2.5 x 109 bp),
fetal ﬁbroblast cells (IMR90, r = 0.63, P = 0, n = 2.5 x 109 bp),
CD133 + hematopoietic stem cells (r = 0.55, P = 0,
n = 2.5 x 109 bp), CD36 + erythrocyte precursors (r = 0.54,
10:0, n=2.5 X109bp), HeLa (r=0.52, P=0, n=2.5 X109bp)
and resting and activated CD4+T helper cells (r: 0.46, P: 0,
n = 2 x 109 bp) (Fig. 4c). The enrichment of ChIP-seq reads pro-
vides probabilistic occupation level as well. In addition, there is
possible variation in ChIP-seq experiments and differential regu-
lation of H3K4me3 among cell types (Supplementary Fig. S3).
The correlations between our predictions and the in vivo data are
surprisingly high, suggesting a high accuracy of our model.

in vivo occupancies of H3K4me3 across various cell types. (a and b)
The 5’ -end of E2F2 and GAPDH genes have been experimentally vali-
dated to have a very high level of H3K4me3 using western blot (Steward
et al., 2006). Arrow indicates the direction of transcription. The level of
black bar is the probability of H3K4me3 occupation at a base pair.
A gray box represents the genomic region containing previously validated
high-density H3K4me3 nucleosomes. (c) H3K4me3 ChIP-seq experimen-
tal occupancy is correlated with probability of H3K4me3 nucleosome
occupation based on the human genome among cell types. The gray
lines represent the 99% conﬁdence interval of the mean ChIP-seq read
occupancy. (d) Precision-recall analyses of P(H3K4me3 occupation). The
dots mark cut-off probability of H3K4me3 occupation at 0.1—0.9
increased by 0.1

Third, we conducted precision/recall analyses to assess the ef-
ﬁciency of our method. The precision level is the proportion of
genomic regions occupied by H3K4me3 from the ChIP-seq ex-
periment among the predicted genomic regions at an occupation
probability cut-off. The recall level is the proportion of genomic
regions predicted to be occupied by an H3K4me3 nucleosome
among the genomic regions occupied by H3K4me3 from the
ChIP-seq experiment. The experimentally veriﬁed positive loci
associated with enrichment of H3K4me3 occupation were ex-
tracted from the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq experiment in CD4+T
cells (Poisson process, P< 10—5). With the P(H3K4me3 occupa-
tion) 0.5 cut-off, the precision level was 76% and the recall level
was 37% in CD4+T cells (Fig. 4d). As only 5% of the human
genome is actually occupied by an H3K4me3 nucleosome in
CD4 + T cells, our prediction of H3K4me3 occupation efﬁciently
enriches the true H3K4me3 occupation sites [X2 test, H3K4me3
occupation sites in the genome (5%) versus H3K4me3 occupa-
tion sites among P(H3K4me3 occupation): 0.5 (76%), P20].
In view of the fact that only 1% of the genome is predicted with
P(H3K4me3 occupation) 2 0.5, the enrichment of 37% true posi-
tive in P(H3K4me3 occupation) is highly signiﬁcant [X2 test,
P(H3K4me3 occupation) 20.5 in total genome (1%) versus
P(H3K4me3 occupation) 20.5 among true H3K4me3 occupa-
tion sites (37%), P20]. The precision-recall analyses suggest
that our method efﬁciently predicts H3K4me3 nucleosome
occupations.

in the human genome. (a) The probabilities of H3K4me3 occupation on
regulatory elements in the human genome. The red dotted line represents
the average probability of H3K4me3 occupation in the whole genome.
The vertical axes are in the logarithmic scale. (b) The false negative rates

with the top 0.1% ChIP-seq reads in CD4 +T cells were calculated in a

signiﬁcance, P< 10‘5

3.4 The probability of H3K4me3 occupation at regulator—
chromatin interaction sites

To investigate the role of the predicted H3K4me3 occupation in
transcription, we studied its predicted occurrence around a tran-
scribed region. We found a high peak of the probability of
H3K4me3 occupation at the TSS and TTS of genes and at the
start and end sites of exons (Fig. 5a). To study the probabilistic
H3K4me3 occupation proﬁle in higher-order chromatin—chro-
matin interaction, we examined the relationship between the
probability of H3K4me3 occupation and protein factors regulat-
ing chromatin structure. Histone acetylases help long-range chro-
matin interactions between enhancer-bound TFs and the RNA
Pol II complex at promoters and enhancers. Insulators are pref-
erentially bound by CTCF and involved in gene regulation and
chromatin structural changes. We calculated the read coverage
from ChIP-seq of RNA Pol II to estimate the distribution of
RNA Pol II on the human genome. The probability of
H3K4me3 occupation is signiﬁcantly correlated with binding
of RNA Pol II (Fig. 5a). Using the ChIP-seq data of various
histone acetylases, deacetylases and CTCF, we estimated their
binding preferences by the number of reads covering a base pair.
The histone acetylases included in the analyses are p300, CBP,
MOF, PCAF and Tip60, and the histone deacetylases included

are HDACl, HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC6. We found that
histone acetylases, deacetylases and CTCF preferentially interact
with the genome regions showing high probability of H3K4me3
(Fig. 5a). Likewise, the in vivo levels of histone acetylations sig-
niﬁcantly correlate with the probability of H3K4me3 occupation.
The signiﬁcant co-localizations of various histone acetylations on
the predicted H3K4me3 sites suggest that the high probability of
H3K4me3 occupation represents the sequence context of histone
modiﬁcations at regulatory elements. Note that p300, a well-
known enhancer-binding protein (Visel et al., 2009), preferen-
tially binds the genomic region associated with high probability
of H3K4me3 occupation. These observations suggest that the
sequence context encoding high probability of H3K4me3 occu-
pation is speciﬁcally distributed across the human genome. In
particular, the probability of H3K4me3 occupation is correlated
with protein factors that affect chromatin structure.

In general, we found many TF—binding sites associated with
the high probability of H3K4me3 occupation (Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2). The OCT4-, NANOG-, SOX2— and KLF4-
binding sites identiﬁed by ChIP-seq in HESC (Lister et al., 2009)
show high probability of the H3K4me3 occupation. These TFs
are key regulators of stem cell identity and closely interact with
histone modiﬁcations (Boyer et al., 2005). The results suggest
that cell-type—speciﬁc TFs interact with different patterns of
the probability of H3K4me3 occupation.

Finally, we estimated the proportion of H3K4me3 nucleosome
occupied sites not following the probability of H3K4me3 occu-
pation. We calculated the false negative rates of the probabilistic
occupation map of H3K4me3 at regulatory elements (Fig. 5b).
The false negative rate is the proportion of sites showing a high
occupancy level of H3K4me3 (a high number of H3K4me3
ChIP-seq reads, Poisson distribution, P<10_5) despite a very
low probability of the H3K4me3 occupation [P(H3K4me3)
30.00001]. The TSS regions and the ﬁrst exons show signiﬁ-
cantly higher false negative rates (12 and 15%) than most
other regulatory elements. This suggests that the sequence signa-
ture is not only derived from TSS regions and the ﬁrst exons but
also from other genomic regions (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Although Pol II-, p300- and CTCF-binding sites contain a
high probability of the H3K4me3 occupation, they still show
high false negative rates. This suggests that some H3K4me3 oc-
cupation in these regions is determined not only by sequence
context but also by epigenetic factors not explained by DNA
sequence context.

4 DISCUSSION

The different sequence preferences of H3K4me3 and H3 nucleo-
somes imply distinct mechanisms in their arrangement on the
genome. Although the H3 nucleosome is mainly distributed by
the bending property of DNA sequences (Segal et al., 2006;
Vafabakhsh and Ha, 2012), the H3K4me3 nucleosome is regu-
lated by protein factors recognizing speciﬁc sequence compos-
itions, such as non-methylated CG—rich sequence signatures. The
sequence-speciﬁc protein factors interact with histone methylase
complexes speciﬁc to H3K4me3, such as Setdl. In mouse, inser-
tion of non-methylated CpG-rich sequences leads to a high dens-
ity of H3K4me3 occupation. For example, Cfpl speciﬁcally
binds to non-methylated CpG rich sequences and recruits the

Setdl complex (Thomson et al., 2010). In mouse and human,
PRDM9, a meiosis-speciﬁc H3K4me3 histone methyltransferase,
recognizes the target sites by the sequence speciﬁcity and deposits
H3K4me3 nucleosomes at meiosis recombination hotspots
(Baudat et al., 2010). Therefore, the sequence context showing
high probability of H3K4me3 occupation at important regula-
tory elements across the genome may attract chromatin modify-
ing factors.

We found consistent and distinct sequence speciﬁcity only for
H3K4me3 but not for other histone modiﬁcations. It is possible
that other histone modiﬁcations are associated with some se-
quence speciﬁcities that cannot be detected by the 6mer sequence
preferences. Another possibility is that sequence-independent
epigenetic factors regulate other histone modiﬁcations. Indeed,
recently Tsai et al. (2010) showed that long non-coding RNAs
guide the H3K27me3 enrichment, although the sequence speciﬁ-
city of the non-coding RNAs has not yet been identiﬁed.

Previously, Yuan et al. (2005) also used HMM to estimate
nucleosome occupation probabilities from microarray data of
nuclease-treated DNA. Their hidden state was the occupation
of nucleosome, and the observations were microarray Cy3 inten-
sities. Their emission probabilities were Cy3 intensities compared
with the input DNA signal, Cy5. They characterized nucleosome
location based on the consecutive eight probe intensities. On the
other hand, our purpose is to compute the occupation probabil-
ities of different types of nucleosomes from the genomic sequence
alone. We ﬁrst showed that the distinctive sequence speciﬁcities
of H3K4me3 and H3 nucleosomes are consistent among differ-
ent cell types. We then used the observed sequence speciﬁcities of
H3 and H3K4me3 to predict their occupation probabilities at
each mappable base pair from the genomic sequence alone. In
our HMM model, the hidden state is the occupation of
H3K4me3 (or H3) nucleosome at a base pair, and the observed
state is the genome sequence. The emission probabilities in our
model are sequence speciﬁcities of H4K4me3 (or H3). The pre-
dicted probabilities of H3K4me3 occupation are consistent with
experimental data from various human cell types. Although
ChIP-seq data contain noise, the probability of H3K4me3 oc-
cupying a genome region can be estimated from the sequence
reads, as long as the number of reads is large enough for the
statistics to be meaningful.

Our model for predicting an H3K4me3 nucleosome map from
the human genome sequence is similar to Segal et al.’s model
(2006) in that we assume that nucleosome formation in a
genome is a dynamic process, and we calculate the nucleosome
occupation probability at a locus considering all possible nucleo-
somes that can potentially cover the site and their forward and
backward conﬁgurations in a genome. However, our model dif-
fers from theirs in at least three aspects. First, our model incorp-
orates the speciﬁc modiﬁcation status of each nucleosome and
distinguishes between H3 and H3K4me3 occupations. On the
other hand, Segal et al. and other studies did not distinguish
between H3 and H3K4me3 nucleosomes, but considered general
nucleosomes, i.e. micrococal nuclease-sensitive regions. Second,
we compute the sequence compositions of DNA segments in H3
nucleosomes and in H3K4me3 nucleosomes separately, whereas
Segal et al. computed the composition in extracted DNA seg-
ments in all forms of nucleosomes after treatment of micrococcal
nuclease. Third, we aim to infer the probabilistic occupation level

of the H3K4me3 nucleosome based on the genome sequence
context, whereas Segal et al. computed the probabilistic position-
ing of a base pair within 147 bp nucleosomal DNAs. Our model
is based on the ChIP-seq experiments. ChIP-seq enables us to
infer the probable coverage of a locus but not exact positions
within nucleosomes. Therefore, our model can only estimate the
probabilistic occupation levels of H3K4me3 and H3 nucleo-
somes based on the whole-genome sequence context.

In conclusion, our results underscore a relationship between
genome sequence and chromatin remodeling. In addition, se-
quence-independent epigenetic regulation of nucleosomes also
contributes to chromatin modiﬁcations. Our analyses of the
H3K4me3 sequence signature will be a valuable starting point
for future studies of the genome structure. Ultimately, the com-
putational approach may help identify epigenetic and genetic
factors that regulate the chromatin structure.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The avalanche of data arriving since the development of
NGS technologies have prompted the need for developing fast,
accurate and easily automated bioinformatic tools capable of dealing
with massive datasets. Among the most productive applications of
NGS technologies is the sequencing of cellular RNA, known as
RNA-Seq. Although RNA-Seq provides similar or superior dynamic
range than microarrays at similar or lower cost, the lack of standard
and user-friendly pipelines is a bottleneck preventing RNA-Seq from
becoming the standard for transcriptome analysis.

Results: In this work we present a pipeline for processing and analyz-
ing RNA-Seq data, that we have named Grape (Grape RNA-Seq
Analysis Pipeline Environment). Grape supports raw sequencing
reads produced by a variety of technologies, either in FASTA or
FASTQ format, or as prealigned reads in SAM/BAM format. A minimal
Grape configuration consists of the file location of the raw sequencing
reads, the genome of the species and the corresponding gene and
transcript annotation.

Grape first runs a set of quality control steps, and then aligns the reads
to the genome, a step that is omitted for prealigned read formats.
Grape next estimates gene and transcript expression levels, calculates
exon inclusion levels and identifies novel transcripts.

Grape can be run on a single computer or in parallel on a computer
cluster. It is distributed with specific mapping and quantification tools,
but given its modular design, any tool supporting popular data inter-
change formats can be integrated.

1 INTRODUCTION

The development of ultrasequencing technologies during the
recent years has started a major revolution in Biology. The abil-
ity to directly survey the cell’s RNA content by applying NGS
technologies to cDNA sequencing (‘RNA-Seq’) has provided
insights of unprecedented depth on the transcription landscape
of many species Wang et al., 2009) such as Homo sapiens Wang
et al., 2008; Sultan et al., 2008; Montgomery et al., 2010;
Trapnell et al., 2010), Mus musculus (Mortazavi et al., 2008;
Guttman et al., 2010), Arabidopsis thaliana (Lister et al., 2008),
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Nagalakshmi et al., 2008; Yassour
et al., 2009) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Castle 61 al.,

2008). RNA-Seq has proven particularly powerful on tasks
such as identifying novel genes and novel splice forms, detecting
low abundance transcripts and ﬁnding sequence variations, such
as SNPs (Marguerat et al., 2008). It is gradually substituting
microarrays as the technology of choice for transcriptome ana-
lyses, providing access to a greater dynamic range of RNA ex-
pression levels (Marioni et al., 2008).

The throughput of NGS technologies is continuously acceler-
ating, and the cost per sequenced nucleotide is rapidly falling. As
a consequence, an unprecedented amount of data are being pro-
duced, pressing for the development of fast and efﬁcient methods
of analysis, as the bottleneck for scientiﬁc discovery is gradually
shifting from data production to data analysis.

In the analysis of NGS data, processing efﬁciency is governed
predominantly by two factors: ﬁrst, the sheer size of the individ-
ual datasets, and second, the vast number of datasets to be ana-
lyzed. The current generation of sequencing machines, for
example, Illumina HighSeq, can produce the equivalent of 20x
the coverage of the human genome in a single run, delivering
~600 million reads with a length of >100 nt. This has spawned a
new generation of aligners optimized for aligning short sequences
to the genome, for example, Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009),
BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009), BFAST (Homer et al., 2009) and
GEM (Marco-Sola et al., 2012), which are much faster than
previous tools such as Basic Local Alignment Search Tool,
FASTA or SSEARCH (see Trapnell and Salzberg, 2009, for a
short review). Additionally, an increasing number of projects
involve large sample sizes to be analyzed, often under complex
experimental designs.

In the speciﬁc case of RNA-Seq, mapping of reads is only the
ﬁrst step of a complex data processing schema, the ﬁnal goal of
which is to produce accurate gene and transcript quantiﬁcations,
and to delineate novel transcript structures. The lack of easy-to-
use pipelines to perform such a processing out of the box in a
transparent and streamlined fashion is actually a bottleneck that
prevents the expansion of RNA-Seq, and prompts users with
little access to sophisticated bioinformatic resources to prefer
microarrays, for which standard ready-to-use processing pipe-
lines and user-friendly bioinformatic analysis tools exist.

To address this need, speciﬁc pipelines have recently been
developed for analyzing RNA-Seq data, such as the pipeline
developed by Goncalves et a]. (Goncalves et al., 2011), an ana-
lysis pipeline developed in R within the context of the
ArrayExpress Database. These and other tools facilitate the ana-
lysis of RNA-Seq data, but still require the user to have a sig-
niﬁcant bioinformatics background, speciﬁcally when complex
experiments with a large number of datasets need to be analyzed.

Grape RNA-Seq analysis

 

Here we describe Grape, a workﬁow for the analysis of
RNA-Seq data that automates all the steps from RNA-Seq
reads to transcript quantiﬁcation and discovery. Its user-friendly
interface provides the necessary overview of all the data, and is
therefore particularly suited for processing numerous ﬁles, pro-
duced in complex experimental setups. The results, both inter-
mediate and ﬁnal, are stored in an MySQL database, allowing
for access through the database interface, but can also be visua-
lized through Raisin, a user-friendly web application. The same
html interface that is used for standalone local analysis is easily
deployed on a web server for remote access in collaborative pro-
jects, or data dissemination.

Grape takes three types of input ﬁles. First, the read ﬁles,
which may be aligned or not, the reference genome sequence
ﬁle and the corresponding gene annotation ﬁle. Alternatively,
Grape can also take read alignment ﬁles as input, rather than
raw read ﬁles. Grape produces a number of output ﬁles in tabu-
lar format, so they can be easily loaded into most statistical
packages. While this is the case for quantiﬁcations, which are
made available individually at the gene, transcript and exon level,
the BAM format is used as an output format for alignments.

More speciﬁcally, processing of RNA-Seq reads by Grape in-
volves the following steps: (i) sequence read evaluation, and trim-
ming if required; (ii) mapping to the genome, and the
transcriptome; (iii) assembly of reads in absence of a reference
genome, or before genome mapping; (iv) identiﬁcation of novel
exons, and splice junctions and modeling of transcript structures
and (v) gene and transcript quantiﬁcation. Grape pays special
attention to quality controls (QCs), which trace quality scores
and uncalled bases along the reads, look for biased nucleotide
composition and inspect the distribution of reads along tran-
scripts. These can be used for QC, although Grape leaves any
decision to modify the data, such as trimming and ﬁltering, to
the user.

Grape is based on the PIP pipeline management system
(Conery et al., 2005). The current Grape distribution uses
SAMtools (Li et al., 2009), the GEM mapper (Marco-Sola
et al., 2012), the Flux Capacitor (Montgomery et al., 2010) and
Cufﬁinks (Trapnell et al., 2010), but any tool compliant with
popular data interchange formats like GFF, BAM/SAM and
BED can be used. Grape can be run locally or on a computer
cluster. Speed-up of the analyses is achieved by parallelizing cer-
tain steps and taking advantage of multithreading where pos-
sible. The Grape implementation conserves a copy of the exact
software and conﬁguration used for a given set of analyses, guar-
anteeing forward reproducibility.

2 APPROACH
2.1 Grape description

Grape is an automated workﬁow integrating the management,
analysis and visualization of RNA-Seq data. GRAPE can map
the reads to the genome and/or transcriptome, and it can also
work with single or paired end reads, both stranded or not.

It organizes the RNA-Seq datasets in projects, that is, sets of
datasets, that are generated within the same study and are all
analyzed using the same annotation ﬁles and reference genome
sequence.

Two MySQL databases store the information generated by the
individual steps in the pipeline, allowing for efﬁcient storage and
retrieval of data. One of these is used to store the metadata (cell
type, RNA extract, etc) as well as information that is independ-
ent of the reads (junction libraries, indices location, etc), and the
other for the results produced for each of the datasets.

Grape uses the Buildout package (http://www.bui1dout.org) to
set up all necessary components for running the analysis, and
Raisin to visualize the data through a web browser.

Buildout is a widely used Python package for assembling and
deploying applications from multiple parts. In our case, Buildout
installs all the programs used by Grape, like GEM and the Flux
Capacitor, and makes the Grape pipeline scripts available to the
individually conﬁgured RNA-Seq analysis pipelines. Each pipe-
line is linked to one of the datasets in the project, and has its own
independent directory structure. The pipelines are run in parallel,
and can be inspected through log ﬁles tracing all execution steps.

The only requirement for the Buildout is a set of conﬁguration
ﬁles containing information on the read ﬁles and parameters to
be used during the analysis, such as annotation, number of mis-
matches allowed during mapping, location of data ﬁles, etc.
These conﬁguration ﬁles also serve as a way to track all analysis
performed for a project and the metadata associated to a project.
Most importantly, they allow future reproducibility of the re-
sults. Internally, we manage all project conﬁgurations within
the version control system Subversion (SVN), so they can be
easily updated and traced.

Buildout installs two central scripts that are needed for run-
ning the individual pipelines. The ﬁrst is the start.sh, which in-
serts the pipeline information into the metadata MySQL
database. The second is the execute.sh script that runs the
actual pipeline and stores all its results in the results MySQL
database. The analyses are executed as so-called ‘rules’ through
a template ﬁle (similar to a Makeﬁle). Grape can be run on a
single dataset or simultaneously on several datasets. The ﬁrst
common database holds all metadata concerning the pipeline
runs, such as information regarding the input data. It is also
used as a persistent cache for some shared data, like the library
of splice junction coordinates retrieved from the annotation. The
second database contains all information from the individual
runs that are speciﬁc to each dataset, and includes the statistics
needed for subsequent analysis. Finally, it stores the time stamp
of each executed rule of a dataset, which makes Grape capable of
resuming work seamlessly after interruption.

Using a rule-based approach offers the ﬂexibility of being able
to select only a subset of steps to execute, while automatically
devoting resources only to the inferred analysis steps. Each step
contains a set of prerequisite steps that need to be completed
before the step itself can be executed, and a set of instructions
that will be performed by the step. This information, encoded in
a template ﬁle, is read by the execution script. This script builds a
graph of dependencies between each of the different steps and
executes those necessary to reach the required step. This allows
Grape to perform all analysis steps in an ordered and easily
reproducible manner, and at the same time, to store results
and keep track of successfully completed steps This is particu-
larly important when the aim is to analyze many large datasets in
a consistent manner. An additional advantage is that the tem-
plate ﬁle contains all the steps executed by the pipeline in a

human readable way. By editing the template ﬁle, steps can be
removed, added or modiﬁed.

Grape results include expression levels provided as reads per
kilobase per million and/or unique read counts for different fea-
tures, such as genes, transcripts, exons and junctions. They can
be accessed through the command line by directly querying the
Grape databases or through the Raisin web-application. Raisin
is also based on Buildout, and uses the same conﬁguration ﬁles
used for producing the pipelines. Raisin accesses the results
MySQL database created by Grape, and displays and summar-
izes information produced at the major steps in the analysis pipe-
line (see later in the text).

The Raisin web server comes with two conﬁgurations, one for
accessing Grape locally on a workstation, and another, for dis-
semination of the results on a local Intranet or the Internet for
collaborative projects.

Currently, RNA-Seq data processed by Grape from
several public projects, such as the Illumina Body Map Project
(HBM) or ENCODE (ENCODE Consortium 2004, 2011)
can be browsed at http://rnaseq.crg.es (http://rnaseq.crg.es/pro
ject/HBM/tab/experiments and http://rnaseq.crg.es/project/
ENCODE/tab/experiments/).

2.2 Analysis implemented in Grape

Here we describe the analysis steps implemented in Grape and
the tools used to perform them. These tools are included in the
standard distribution of Grape. However, alternative tools can
be used for the analysis, provided they comply with popular
input/output formats. To illustrate the Grape analyses, we use
an RNA-Seq dataset from the Illumina Human Body Map
(HBM) project (Additional information on the sample and the
raw data can be obtained from http://www.ncbi.nhn.nih.gov/),
with http://rnaseq.crg.es/project/ENCODE/tab/experiments/ as
an example. Here, PolyA—l— / random primed RNA from a mixture
of tissues was interrogated. Three different isolation methods
were used: PolyA+, PolyA+ normalizing the RNA to more ef-
ﬁciently sample lowly expressed transcripts and Ribo minus in-
stead of PolyA+ to remove the ribosomal RNA. The three
samples were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 at a
read length of 100 nt. Each of these sequencing experiments pro-
duced, on average, 400 million reads. The Raisin interface to the
output produced by the Grape analysis of this data is available at
http://rnaseq.crg.es/project/HBM/tab/experiments/.

The main steps in the Grape analysis (illustrated in Fig. l) are
as follows:

Fig. 1. Overview of the three main components of the Grape RNA-Seq
analysis pipeline environment. Buildout: performs the initial conﬁgur-
ation. MySQL: two databases are used, one containing information spe-
ciﬁc to the datasets analyzed such as quantiﬁcations-detected elements,
etc. Another contains information dependent on genome and annotation,
as well as meta-information that allows for the linking of the different
datasets. Raisin web application: allows the visualization of the analysis
summaries using a web browser

organized according to the metadata given in the Buildout con-
ﬁguration ﬁles.

Next, Grape produces some basic statistics, and checks the
quality of the RNA-Seq data by verifying the data format, cal-
culating the distribution of ambiguous bases (bases where the
sequencer was unable to call the base correctly and assigned it
an N) and tracing quality scores along the reads. Figures 2a, b
and d illustrate the Raisin interface to some of these QC steps.
These initial QC steps contribute to assess whether additional
preprocessing, such as trimming and/or ﬁltering of the reads, is
necessary. However, Grape only provides the QC information,
and it is up to the user to decide whether additional preprocess-
ing is required. Grape’s architecture allows for conveniently run-
ning it in stages. For example, Grape may be run ﬁrst up to the
QC step, and restarted from there after completion of the QC
analysis.

Mapping: Grape’s next step is the alignment of the short se-
quence reads to the reference genome. This step is crucial for the
RNA-Seq analysis, and particular care has to be taken, as it will
condition any downstream analyses. Grape alignment module is
complex, performing several alignments, and then combines
them into a ﬁnal mapping, from which a BAM ﬁle is produced.
By default, Grape uses GEM (Marco-Sola et al., 2012), an ex-
haustive short-read mapper, allowing mismatches and indels (but
other aligners could be used as long as the output format is, or
can be, converted to standard BAM/SAM).

As most NGS aligners, GEM requires an ‘index creation’ step
before the actual read mapping. This step preprocesses the ref-
erence sequence, creating a data structure that can be searched
fast and efﬁciently. The choice of indices determines which ref-
erence sequences the raw reads will be searched against. The
most obvious index to be used is the one corresponding to the
genome sequence of the species investigated. However, when
examining transcriptome data, reads mapping across splice junc-
tions will not match the genome sequence, and it is convenient to

create a speciﬁc index corresponding to the splice junctions.
Thus, in addition to the genome index, Grape generates a junc-
tions index that contains annotated splice junctions, plus all pos-
sible junctions that can be obtained by biologically legal
combinations of exons within each locus. This type of approach
has already been shown to distinguish different alternative splice
forms when used to design splicing microarrays (Johnson et al.,
2003).

Grape aligns reads against both the genome and the junction
references. Junction mappings are ﬁltered to remove those reads
that do not span the splice site. Next, the remaining unmapped
reads are mapped using the GEM split-mapper (Marco-Sola
et al., 2012). This tool will attempt to divide the read into two
parts and align each fragment independently to the genome.
Only alignments matching consensus splice sites are further con-
sidered. This allows Grape to recover the reads mapping to
unannotated ‘bona ﬁde’ splice sites.

After this step, there may still be some unmapped reads—cor-
responding to unsequenced regions of the genome, genome con-
taminants, large number of mismatches with the references, etc.
Grape follows an aggressive strategy in an attempt to reliably
map as many reads as possible, and toward that end, it performs
additional rounds of mapping. First, it successively increases by
one (by default) the number of allowed mismatches up to a
number that is proportional to the length of the read (by default,
up to l mismatch per 25 nt of read length). For each number of

Fig. 3. Overview of Grape’s mapping strategy. The initial genome and
junctions mapping is followed by a round of split mapping. Remaining
unmapped reads are aligned with additional mismatches, and the still
remaining ones are iteratively trimmed. The mappings resulting from
the different steps are combined into a ﬁnal merged mapping

mismatches, a new genome mapping (including split-mapping) is
performed. Second, remaining unmapped reads are successively
trimmed by a set number of nucleotides (10 by default), and a
new genome (and split) mapping performed after each trimming.
The aggressiveness of the trimming can be controlled by the user.
A parameter sets the shortest length to which the read can be
trimmed. If this length is equal to the read length, then no trim-
ming is performed.

This iterative mapping ends when all reads are mapped, or the
length of the reads falls below a certain threshold (25 nt, by de-
fault). A diagram describing it can be seen in Figure 3. This
approach is similar to the one described in Cloonan et a].
(2009).The Raisin output, providing summary statistics of the
Grape mappings, is shown in Figure 4.

Post-mapping: The reads that align in the initial round of map-
ping (genome, junction and split-mapping) are examined and
divided into those reads that map to one location better than
to any other (unique maps) and those that align to at least two
positions equally well (multi-maps).

This is an important ﬁltering step because a unique map
implies higher reliability in the alignment than a multi—map.
However, excluding all multi-maps from an analysis results in
the potential loss of information. The eventual use of one read
alignment type versus the other will depend on the type of the
analysis. For example, for tasks such as the identiﬁcation of
novel genes, or the detection of low abundance transcripts, the
conﬁdence of the results increases if only uniquely mapped reads
are considered. Other tasks, like the calculation of genome/tran-
scriptome coverage, may use all the mapped reads.

Those reads that can be aligned to a unique position in the
genome and also to a unique position in the junctions are also
considered multi-maps, and are, in many cases, indicators of the
presence of a pseudogene or processed copy of a gene in the
genome. In the case of paired end reads, if one of the members
of the pair can be aligned uniquely to a certain position, the

corresponding mate can sometimes be rescued if it is a
multi-map. However, in the case of RNA-Seq reads, in contrast
to genomic DNA reads, the insert size cannot always be used to
identify the correct mate, as the presence of introns can alter the
distance between mates. Grape chooses the closest mapping pos-
ition to the uniquely mapping mate in these cases. In the case of
the example analyzed here, Grape assigns, on average, 52% of
the reads to a unique position, whereas 25% of the reads are
multi-mapping (Fig. 4a).

The results of the different mapping steps are combined into a
ﬁnal mapping results ﬁle in GFF, BED or SAM/BAM format.
This ﬁle can be uploaded to genome browsers for visualization
and comparison or be analyzed by other programs. Grape uses
this ﬁle speciﬁcally for the quantiﬁcation of genes and transcripts
and for the delineation of transcript structures (see next).

Transcript quantiﬁcation: Grape uses the mapping results to
produce quantiﬁcations of the abundance of a number of tran-
scribed elements: exons, splice junctions, genes and transcripts, as
well as inclusion indices for exons.

Before the quantiﬁcation, Grape investigates the distribution
of mapped reads along transcripts to identify potential 3’ to 5’
biases. Toward that end, the annotated transcripts are binned
according to their length (see Fig. 5).

We use two strategies for quantifying exons and genes: (i)
simple overlap, and (ii) read deconvolution. Under the ﬁrst seen-
ario, exons and genes are quantiﬁed by simply summing all the
uniquely mapping reads that are fully included within the bound-
aries of the exon or gene. Results are given in reads per kilobase
per million mapped reads (Mortazavi et al., 2008). Note that

reads completely included in two or more overlapping exons
will be counted separately for each exon. Exon quantiﬁcations
in these cases will be overestimated.

To produce quantiﬁcations of individual transcripts, we use
the FluxCapacitor (Montgomery et al., 2010) The FluxCapacitor
converts the transcript structure of each annotated locus into a
splicing graph, where junctions are represented as nodes and
exons as edges. The mapping of the reads into the graph imposes
a number of constraints that the FluxCapacitor represents as a
system of linear equations, which can be solved using linear
programming.

Raisin plots the distribution of expression of all genes
(Fig. 6a), and lists the top 20 highly expressed transcripts
(Fig. 6c) and genes (Fig. 6b), and from the Raisin interface, it
is possible to navigate to the expression values of all transcripts
and genes (in html, csv and excel formats).

Distribution of inclusion values

Fig. 7. Raisin visualization of Grape’s splicing analysis. Panel a shows
the summary table for the detected splice sites. Panel b contains a table
with the top included exons in the samples examined, and panel c shows
the distribution of the inclusion values over all internal exons

Splice junctions are quantiﬁed using the number of reads span-
ning the junction. In this case, no need for feature length nor-
malization is required, and the choice of normalization based on
number of reads in different samples is left to the criteria of the
user (Fig. 7a). The detected splice sites are further classiﬁed:
‘Known’ are junctions that appear in the annotation. ‘Novel’
are junctions formed between annotated exons from the same
gene, but not present in the annotation. ‘Novel from unanno-
tated exons’ are split-map junctions, in which at least one of the
two connected ‘exons’ is not annotated. In this last group, we
also include any junction detected between exons from different
genes.

Grape also computes an exon inclusion ratio for each anno-
tated internal exon. Exon inclusion is computed as the ratio of all
reads supporting the inclusion of the exon (reads mapping to
exon junctions that include it and the exon itself) to all reads
supporting its exclusion. These are reads mapping to junctions
from that gene that skip the exon. See Figure 70.

Discovery of novel transcribed elements: Grape runs a number
of analyses to identify novel transcribed elements. First,
RNA-Seq clusters are built from uniquely mapping reads,
using either genomic mappings, junctions maps or split reads.
There is no threshold for the number of reads that make a clus-
ter, but Grape provides the number of reads, and of staggered
reads making each cluster. Grape also detects novel splice junc-
tions through the split mapping of reads. These are the junctions
classiﬁed as novel from unannotated exons (see previously).
Finally, Cufﬁinks (Trapnell et al., 2010) is used to infer transcript
structures.

Grape also implements a simple procedure to identify chimeric
RNAs independently of those cases found by Cufﬁinks, which

can be used if the input is paired end reads. Here, both mates of
all read pairs mapping uniquely (with up to the speciﬁed number
of mismatches) to the transcriptome are evaluated. If they map
to different transcripts, they are classiﬁed as unannotated splice
variants if both of these transcripts belong to the same gene.
Otherwise, they map to transcripts from different annotated
genes, and are classiﬁed as putative chimeric RNAs or fusions.

Summary statistics: A page including summary statistics from
all the different analysis steps in Grape is produced, and it can be
accessed through Raisin (Fig. 8). From this page it is possible to
navigate to each speciﬁc analysis.

Additional analysis: Additional analyses can be implemented
within Grape by simply adding an entry to the workﬁow tem-
plate ﬁle specifying the computations to be performed in the
additional step. The new entry is a sequence of shell commands
that specify the computations that need to be performed. The
sequence of commands is preceded by a line that contains the
name of the new step and its dependencies. These dependencies
are just the names of those other steps that need to be executed
before to generate the input required by the new step. For in-
stance, in the entry

preprocess: start
$BIN/preprocess . RNAseq . pl
mv preprocess . RNAseq . log $LOG

The ﬁrst line contains the name of the step (‘preprocess’) and
its dependencies, in this case, a step named start, and the follow-
ing lines, the commands to be run. The variables set by Grape,
such as BIN and LOG, are listed at the start of this ﬁle and can
be used by any of the commands in the template ﬁle.

3 DISCUSSION

Here we presented and discussed Grape, an architecture for a
computational pipeline for the analysis of millions or billions of
short reads obtained from (potentially many) high-throughput
RNA-Seq experiments. This is a general and ﬂexible pipeline that
combines contributions of previous studies with our own experi-
ence dealing with RNA-Seq data. Grape attempts to address the
challenges both from the processing and management stand-
points associated to the analysis of sheer amounts of data. It
automates the processing and analysis steps, while at the same

time providing an organizational framework that simpliﬁes the
management and summarizing of the analysis.

The full workﬂow of the pipeline ﬁts in a single text ﬁle spe-
cifying the dependency graph of the pipeline’s rules. Adding a
new analysis step in Grape is as simple as deﬁning the parent
steps that have to be executed beforehand, and the programs and
scripts that need to be executed by the new step.

Grape’s objective is to produce quantiﬁcations of transcript
abundances (and of the abundances of other transcriptional
elements: genes, exons, splice junctions, etc). Grape does not
perform statistical analysis and comparisons of expression or
splicing usage between and/or across samples. From Grape’s
output quantiﬁcations, however, other methods and tools can
be used to perform such analysis [for instance, R statistical pack-
ages within Bioconductor (Gentleman et al. 2004; http://pypi-
ranking.info/module/zc.buildou) for expression analyses, etc].
Integrating Grape’s quantiﬁcation with analysis of gene expres-
sion and alternative splicing is among the further developments
planned within Grape’s roadmap. In the very short-term, we
plan to incorporate a method to assess data reproducibility.
The method, called Irreproducible Discovery Rate (Li et al.,
2011), has been pioneered in the framework of the ENCODE
project, and it can be applied to experiments with two replicates.
Other developments include transcript assembly and quanti-
ﬁcations in absence of a genome of reference. This could be
particularly useful for species with transcriptome data, but not
sequenced genome. Note that Grape can already be directly used
to produce quantiﬁcations if an index from a reference transcrip-
tome—independently assembled—is generated. Current efforts
are, however, mostly focused to streamline the pipeline to maxi-
mize speed and minimize memory usage, to simplify installation
of the package, to provide graphical support for interactive usage
and to improve graphical reporting of the results. Currently, as
of July 2012, Grape is on version 1.6, and we provide regular
upgrades.

We have so far used Grape successfully for the in-house
analysis of more than a thousand large RNA-Seq datasets
[from projects such as ENCODE (ENCODE Consortium,
2004, 2011), Illumina Body Map (rnaseq.crg.es/project
/ENCODE/tab/experiments/), GTEx (www.genome.gov/gtex),
ICGC (Puente et al., 2011), Geuvadis (www.geuvadis.org),
Quantomics (www.quantomics.eu) and others].

Given the unique role of RNA as both a proxy and a deter-
minant of the cellular and organism phenotype, proﬁling of
RNA by RNA-Seq will spread beyond basic research, in medi-
cine, agriculture, biotechnology and other technical applications
of biology. RNA-Seq could be used, for instance, for continuous
ambulatory monitoring of tumor response to treatment. It could
become a standard component of blood tests, a single assay
monitoring many more variables than current biomarker
assays. Such applications of RNA-Seq require, however, analysis
tools (mapping, quantiﬁcation, etc) that are order of magnitude
more efﬁcient than currently existing ones. They require, in add-
ition, robust, efﬁcient and scalable software systems for
RNA-Seq data storage, organization and analysis. The lack of
such systems is often seriously limiting the utility of RNA-Seq
data, and may prevent researchers to embark in medium- to
large-scale RNA-Seq projects—which are otherwise within

technological reach. We believe that Grape may contribute to
ﬁll such a void.

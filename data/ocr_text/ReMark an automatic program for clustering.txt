ABSTRACT

Summary: ReMark is a fully automatic tool for clustering orthologs
by combining a Recursive and a Markov clustering (MCL) algorithms.
The ReMark detects and recursively clusters ortholog pairs
through reciprocal BLAST best hits between multiple genomes
running software program (RecursiveClustering.java) in the first
step. Then, it employs MCL algorithm to compute the clusters
(score matrices generated from the previous step) and refines the
clusters by adjusting an inflation factor running software program
(MarkovClustering.java). This method has two key features. One
utilizes, to get more reliable results, the diagonal scores in the matrix
of the initial ortholog clusters. Another clusters orthologs flexibly
through being controlled naturally by MCL with a selected inflation
factor. Users can therefore select the fitting state of orthologous
protein clusters by regulating the inflation factor according to their
research interests.

Availability and Implementation: Source code for the orthologous
protein clustering software is freely available for non-commercial
use at http://dasan.sejong.ac.kr/~wikim/notice.html, implemented in
Java 1.6 and supported on Windows and Linux.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identifying orthologs automatically is very useful for functional
annotation, and studies on comparative and evolutionary genomics.

An orthology group identiﬁed by a semi—automated method is
the Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) database (Tatusov et al.,
1997, 2003) in National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI). It ﬁrst identiﬁes groups of three proteins with best reciprocal
BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) hits, and then performs case—by—case
manual analysis to eliminate false—positives. Remm et al. (2001)
introduces InParanoid, a fully automatic program to detect orthologs
and inparalogs between two species. Li et al. (2003) developed
OrthoMCL, which generates orthologs from multiple species using
the MCL algorithm (Van, 2000). The MCL algorithm is known to be
effective for detecting protein families with especially complicated
domain structure (Enright et al., 2002). It is a graph partitioning
algorithm, based on network ﬂow, which is to simulate the ﬂow

within a graph such that the ﬂow is encouraged where the current is
strong, but it is discouraged where the current is weak.

We here introduce the ReMark tool that clusters ortholo gs ﬂexibly
through adjusting a parameter according to the user’s interest. The
fundamental algorithms and its evaluation were introduced in the
previous work (Kim et al., 2007, 2008). Based on reciprocal BLAST
best hits of gene pairs between two genomes, the method utilizes,
to get more reliable results, the diagonal scores in the matrix of
the initial ortholog clusters and clusters orthologs ﬂexibly through
being controlled naturally by MCL with a selected inﬂation factor.
Users can therefore select the ﬁtting state of orthologous protein
clusters by regulating the inﬂation factor according to their research
interests.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The ReMark provides multiple, ﬂexible approaches to cluster
orthologous proteins. The ReMark software program works in two
steps (shown in Fig. 1). In the ﬁrst step, n genomes (protein
sequence sets in the FASTA format) of our interest are selected. Next
is to cluster orthologous proteins recursively using our recursive
clustering algorithm from the initial table with reciprocal best hits
derived by our software program (RecursiveClustering. j ava) written
in Java. The clustering recursively detects and merges gene pairs
with identical genes. In this step, score matrices are constructed from
the initial clusters produced in the previous step. The second step is
to split the initial clusters into more reﬁned, tighter and consistent
clusters using the MCL algorithm implemented by our software
program (MarkovClustering.java) written in Java. In this step, the
score matrices produced in the previous step are transformed into
Markov matrices to simulate random walks on a graph. Finally,
the terminal ortholog clusters are produced through adjusting its
inﬂation factor.

To demonstrate how to use the ReMark tool, we have downloaded
l2 genomes from NCBI at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/. The
dataset was used by the Recursive program in ReMark. After
executing the program, initial clusters (score matrices) were
generated. We computed the initial clusters with the MCL program
in ReMark adjusting the inﬂation factor from 1.3 to 2.0. We obtain a
group of protein clusters after running MCL with the score matrices.

3 DISCUSSION

Chen et al. (2006) showed that both methods of InParanoid and
OrthoMCL have the best overall performance of 10 others using a

statistical technique called latent class analysis (LCA) (Hui et al.,
1998). However, there is no gold standard datasets to evaluate
ortholog clusters as they mentioned. According to each strategy,
the results of the 10 methods are different each other. Resampled
Inference of Orthology (RIO) (Zmasek et al., 2002) has the least
FP (1—Speciﬁcity) rate, and euKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG)
(Tatusov et al., 2003) the least FN (1—Sensitivity) rate. Each strategy
has its positive and negative points. Nevertheless, in order to identify
which method can generate more accurate results, Chen et al. (2006)
notably investigated the consistency of OrthoMCL and KOG with
enzyme commission assignments, concerning protein function and
domain architectures. By an intuitive measure similar to this (Kim
et al., 2007, 2008), based on the consistency of Kegg Orthology
(KO) database (Kanehisa et al., 2004, 2006) with the ortholog
group tables containing curated orthologous genes extracted from
metabolic and regulatory pathways, we tested how much our results
are consistent with KO using InParanoid as the baseline approach.
We then recognized that our method performed signiﬁcantly better
than InParanoid as investigated, changing an inﬂation factor in the
condition of not including inparalogs.

In this study, we selected 12 genomes in different domains
(Table 1) to test our method more extensively, and made three
different datasets consisting of six genomes and three different
datasets comprising nine genomes (Table 2). In this experiment,
we compared ours, produced by ReMark, with results produced by
InParanoid version 4.1 with default conditions. The inparalogs are
in this time included in InParanoid’s results unlike the previous test
(Kim et al., 2007, 2008). As shown in Figures 2 and 3, users can
get better ortholog clusters with proper inﬂation factors. According
to the size of selected genomes, the factors can be modulated to
optimize the quality of ortholog clusters. We can generally get almost
the same as or better results than InParanoid’s at the inﬂation
factor 1.4.

Fig. 3. Bar graphs representing the results (IP4, IP5 and IP6) of InParanoid
and line graphs representing the results (RM4, RM5 and RM6) of ReMark.
The accuracy of RM4 in Set #4 is better than 1P4 from 1.3 to 2.0 (about
1—3% better) and has more orthologs (32.9% at 1.3, 14.9% at 1.4 and 4% at
1.5). The accuracy of RM5 in Set #5 is almost the same as the IP5 at 1.3, and
better than IP5 from 1.4 to 2.0 (about 1—5% better), and has more orthologs
(40.1% at 1.3, 19.8% at 1.4 and 6.9% at 1.5). The accuracy of RM6 in Set #6
is almost the same as the 1P6 at 1.4, and better than 1P6 from 1.5 to 2.0 (about
1—3% better), and has more orthologs (39.4% at 1.3, 22.6% at 1.4, 11.5% at
1.5 and 3.4% at 1.6). The overlapping orthologs with KO have distribution
of about 30—60%.

The COGs are groups to cluster orthologs among multiple
genomes without any premature threshold. However, the quality
of ortholog clusters depends on the BLAST algorithm, which may
not give accurate results between evolutionary distant species. The
COG method dependant on the reciprocal BLAST best hits may
therefore need the manual analysis of biologists. This takes time—
consuming processes. To overcome this difﬁculty, both InParanoid
and OrthMCL made automatic ortholog clusters with taking a
premature threshold. However, applying the threshold could raise
sensitivity, but reduce speciﬁcity. That is, this may lose real true
positive orthologs prematurely. ReMark, therefore, uses the natural
threshold regulated by the MCL with adjusting inﬂation factors,
gaining 3—40% more orthologs than InParanoid. In addition, the
ReMark uses diagonal components that have self—BLAST best
scores in contrast with OrthoMCL. The reason we use the diagonal
terms here is that the node with a high return weight can give an
effect for changing cluster granularity (Van, 2000). It would be
natural to apply the diagonal terms since the self—score of each gene

is different according to the size of the amino acid sequences of a
gene considered. In our experiment, it was observed that the ortholog
clusters, generated with diagonal scores, were more consistent with
KO than without, showing about 7% more accuracy (Kim et al.,
2007).

In conclusion, this method clusters orthologs ﬂexibly and more
accurately through being controlled naturally by employing MCL
with an inﬂation factor and diagonal components that are self—
BLAST best scores.

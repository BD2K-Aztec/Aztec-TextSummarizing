Abstract

Motivation: Families with inherited diseases are widely used in Mendelian/complex disease
studies. Owing to the advances in high—throughput sequencing technologies, family genome
sequencing becomes more and more prevalent. Visualizing family genomes can greatly facilitate
human genetics studies and personalized medicine. However, due to the complex genetic relation—
ships and high similarities among genomes of consanguineous family members, family genomes
are difficult to be visualized in traditional genome visualization framework. How to visualize the
family genome variants and their functions with integrated pedigree information remains a critical
chaHenge.

Results: We developed the Family Genome Browser (FGB) to provide comprehensive analysis and
visualization for family genomes. The FGB can visualize family genomes in both individual level
and variant level effectively, through integrating genome data with pedigree information. Family
genome analysis, including determination of parental origin of the variants, detection of de novo
mutations, identification of potential recombination events and identical—by—decent segments, etc.,
can be performed flexibly. Diverse annotations for the family genome variants, such as dbSNP
memberships, linkage disequilibriums, genes, variant effects, potential phenotypes, etc., are
illustrated as well. Moreover, the FGB can automatically search de novo mutations and compound
heterozygous variants for a selected individual, and guide investigators to find high—risk genes with
flexible navigation options. These features enable users to investigate and understand family
genomes intuitively and systematically.

Availability and implementation: The FGB is available at http://mlg.hit.edu.cn/FGB/.

1 Introduction

 

Families with inherited genetic diseases are Widely used as cases in
Mendelian/complex disease studies. Recently, advances in high—
throughput sequencing technologies have led the family genome
sequencing to become more and more popular in these studies.
Through analysis of family genome sequencing data, such as variant
calling, variant prioritizing, etc., researchers are able to better

understand the genetic basis of Mendelian/complex diseases in vari—
ant level, and create insights for disease prediction, diagnosis and
treatment. In family genome sequencing analysis, millions of vari-
ants are called from sequencing data. Most of them are rare or have
no functional significance. Several methods, such as GEMINI,
VariantTools, MendelScan, FARVAT, etc., are developed to identify
causal variants in family based studies of disease (Choi et 61]., 2014;

Koboldt et 61]., 2014; Paila et 61]., 2013; San Lucas et 61]., 2012).
However, visualization is always the most intuitive and straightfor—
ward approach to compare and validate the remaining candidates of
disease causing variants.

Several methods, tools and statistical models have been de—
veloped for family based variant detection, annotation and analysis.
MendelScan prioritizes candidate variants and searches Mendelian—
disease genes by analysing sequencing data and pedigree/phenotype
information in family studies of Mendelian diseases (Koboldt et 61].,
2014). GEMINI annotates genetic variants by integrating a diverse
and adaptable set of genome annotations into a unified database to
facilitate interpretation and data exploration (Paila et 61]., 2013).
VariantTools provides a command—line driven toolset for building
more sophisticated analytical methods (San Lucas et 61]., 2012).
FamAnn automatically selects and annotates variants segregating in
each family and shared across families, for facilitating disease vari—
ants or genes discovery in family based sequencing studies (Yao
et 61]., 2014). VAR—MD analyses the DNA sequence variants pro—
duced by human exome sequencing, and generates a ranked list of
variants using predicted pathogenicity, Mendelian inheritance
models, genotype quality and population variant frequency data
(Sincan et 61]., 2012). FARVAT is a family based rare variant associ—
ation test, and estimates minor allele frequency of each rare variant
between affected and unaffected individuals with the best linear
unbiased estimators (Choi et al., 2014). FamSeq builds on Bayesian
networks and the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and
provides a confidence measure for variant calls using data from all
family members, which can improve the quality of rare variant
detection in family based sequencing studies (Peng et 61]., 2013).
These tools and methods optimize, simplify and automatize many
analysis processes in family based sequencing studies, generating
huge amount of genetic variants for downstream validation and
visualization.

Visualization provides users intuitive descriptions of raw data.
Various visualization tools have been developed for facilitating
different types of genomic studies. Comprehensive genome brows—
ers, such as the UCSC genome browser (Kent et 61]., 2002), Ensembl
genome browser (Flicek et 61]., 2014), etc., can rapidly and reliably
display genomes of many species, together with dozens of integrated
genome annotations, including genes and transcripts, variation,
comparative genomics, regulatory data, etc. Some standalone gen—
ome browsers are available for the interactive exploration of large
datasets, especially the high—throughput sequencing datasets, for
example, the Integrative Genomics Viewer (Robinson et 61]., 2011)
and Savant genome browser (Fiume et 61]., 2012). They can also dis—
play a wide variety of genomic annotations to support data analysis.
There are many visualization tools focusing on visualizing particular
types of data, such as Epigenome Browser (Zhou et 61]., 2011) for
visualizing epigenome data, and Hawkeye (Schatz et 61]., 2007) for
visualizing large—scale assembly data. GBrowse (Stein et 61]., 2002)
and HuRef browser (Axelrod et 61]., 2009) are used to display the
genome of a single individual. TASUKE (Kumagai et 61]., 2013) is de—
veloped for the visualization of variations, annotations and read
depth of multiple genomes. The personal genome browser is
designed and developed for visualizing functions of individual
genome variants (Juan et 61]., 2014). Although these genome brows—
ers enable researchers to view and interact with genomic annota—
tions and data at any requested portion of genomes, they have no
functionality with pedigree information.

The pedigree shows the relations and phenotypes of a family. A
few tools such as HaploPainter (Thiele and Nurnberg, 2005) and
Pedimap (Voorrips et 61]., 2012) are developed for displaying

phenotypic and genotypic data for related individuals linked in pedi-
grees. These tools focus on visualizing pedigrees rather than
genomes.

Family genome sequencing data, including both exome sequenc—
ing data and whole—genome sequencing data, have been generated
by many family based Mendelian and complex disease studies. The
visualization and comparison of disease—causing variants of family
members can provide intuitive understanding of the genetic basis of
Mendelian and complex diseases, thus can support decision making
in healthcare. However, currently there is a lack of visualization
tools dedicated to analysing variants for family genomes.

We developed the Family Genome Browser (FGB) to support
the comprehensive analysis and visualization for genomes of
related individuals linked in pedigrees. The FGB enables investiga—
tors to upload and view family genome variants with the pedigree
information of the family. Based on the relations among family
members, users are able to investigate the genetic similarities/
differences among consanguineous individuals in variant level.
Various kinds of family based analysis, such as determination of
parental origin of the variants, recognition of de novo mutations,
identification of potential recombination events and identical—by—de—
cent (IBD) segments, etc., can be performed by ﬂexibly specifying dif-
ferent family members and analysis modes. Diverse bioinformatics
resources, such as dbSNP (Sherry et 61]., 2001), linkage disequilibrium
(LD), HGNC genes (Gray et 61]., 2013), RefSeq genes (NCBI
Resource Coordinators, 2013), OMIM (Hamosh et 61]., 2005), etc.,
are integrated in the FGB for comprehensively annotating the gen—
omic variants. For individuals whose parents’ variant data are avail—
able, the FGB offers a scanning function for automatically finding de
novo mutations and compound heterozygous variants of the individ—
ual. The two kinds of suspicious variants may have the potential to
cause dominant and recessive genetic diseases. The scan can be per—
formed on the whole genome, a chromosome, or a cytoband. The
FGB provides necessary and convenient genome visualization and
analysis features dedicated to family based studies. These features en—
able users to investigate and understand family genomes intuitively
and systematically.

2 Results

The FGB accepts variant call format (VCF) files (Danecek et 61].,
2011) and PED format texts (Purcell et 61]., 2007) as inputs of vari—
ant data of multiple genomes and pedigree information (Fig. 1a),
illustrates family genomes in a standard pedigree chart (Fig. 1b), and
shows genomic variants and their functional consequences in a verti—
cal linear genome display (Fig. 1f).

2.1 Data input

The FGB supports the Bgzip/Tabix (Li, 2011) compressed/indexed
VCF files. Investigators can either provide accessible data URLs or
upload local data and index files. By inputting the family description
in PED format into the ‘Pedigree’ text area (Fig. 1a), the pedigree
chart of the family can be generated and displayed in the ‘Pedigree’
tab (Fig. 1b).

The drop—down menu can be used to select and display the built—
in and uploaded family genome datasets. The uploaded data can be
removed by clicking the ‘x’ button.

We currently hold 100 selected individuals from 1000 genomes
project phase 3 (Initial release at June 24) dataset (1000 Genomes
Project Consortium, 2012). Each of the 100 selected individuals has
at least one relative in the dataset. The pedigree charts of six trios
are displayed in the ‘Pedigree’ tab by default.

2.2 Pedigree visualization

Users may choose to input the pedigree information and upload
the VCF file at the same time, or to upload the VCF file only. The
pedigree information can be updated at any time, with the pedigree
chart automatically updated. The individuals in PED text can be not
necessarily identical to the samples in VCF data. Because it is very
common that genome data of some family members is difficult to be
collected by researchers, family studies usually only sequence a
subset of members of the whole family. This feature enables users to
input and view a more complete pedigree chart than merely the
family members whose genomic variants data are available.
Selecting a data—available individual in the pedigree chart, genomic
variants of the individual can be displayed in the ‘Browser View’ tab
(Fig. 1f).

In some cases, individuals whose data are available may not be
in the pedigree. For example, HG00119 and HG00124 are second—
order relatives (grandparents, cousins, etc.) as annotated in 1000
genomes project datasets, but the pedigree chart cannot be plotted
based on this knowledge. Users can find and select these individuals
in the ‘Individual List’ tab (Fig. 1c). All samples available in the in—
put VCF file are listed in the ‘Individual List’ tab. If an individual is
in the pedigree, his/her basic information described in the input PED
text, such as family ID, individual ID, father ID, mother ID, gender,
phenotype, etc., are also listed.

2.3 Family genome visualization and analysis

The genomic variants are displayed in the ‘Browser View’ tab (Fig. 1f)
when a user selects an individual in the pedigree chart or individual
list. If the genotypes of the genomic variants are phased, alleles
displayed in the same ﬂank can be considered to be on the same
homologous chromosome. On the contrary, if the genotypes of the
genomic variants are unphased, alleles displayed in the same ﬂank
cannot be considered to be on the same homologous chromosome.

However, whether the variants are phased or not, the FGB en—
ables users to distinguish the paternal variants, maternal variants
and de novo mutations by the trio analysis function. Specifying a
group of individuals other than the selected individual, denoted by
A, investigators can view the variants that are shared between the
selected individual and A, or the variants that are unique in the
selected individual genome. Thus, the FGB provides investigators
three analysis modes: (i) trio analysis, (ii) highlight shared variants
and (iii) highlight unique variants. Users can change the analysis
mode on demand by clicking the individual symbol on top of the
genome display in the ‘Browser View’ tab.

By default, for an individual whose parents’ data are available,
the FGB identifies paternal variants, maternal variants and de
novo mutations based on the genotype information of the trio, and
labels all distinguishable ones in different colours (Fig. 2a). The
alternative alleles of maternal variants are labelled in green; the al—
ternative alleles of paternal variants are labelled in blue and the
alternative alleles of de novo mutations are labelled in red.
Alternative alleles of other variants, including homozygous vari—
ants and variants whose parental origin cannot be determined, are
displayed in black. Regardless of the genotypes of the variants are
phased or unphased, this analysis can be always performed.
However, if the variants of the trio are all phased by existing
phasing tools in advance, such as SHAPEIT2 (Delaneau et al.,
2013), MVNCALL (Menelaou and Marchini, 2013), GATK
PhaseByTransmission (DePristo et al., 2011), etc., potential recom—
bination event is detected (Kong et al., 2008) and displayed, and
an exclamation mark is rendered to indicate the event (Fig. 3a). If
haplotype phases of the trio are assigned unambiguously, the dis—
played event is real recombination event (Auton and McVean,
2012; Roach et al., 2010). For individuals whose parents’ data are
not available, alternative alleles of all variants are labelled in

black.

aPercentage refers to the MOD function.

Users may specify a group of individuals and investigate the
shared variants among these individuals and the selected individual.
The alternative alleles of shared variants are labelled in purple. As
shown in Figure 2b, this feature is developed to find disease causal
variants that are shared among disease—affected family members.

Users may also specify a group of individuals and investigate the
unique variants that only present on the selected individual. In this
mode, the alternative alleles of unique variants are also labelled in
purple. As shown in Figure 2c, by comparing the selected individual
which is affected by a phenotype, and the individual group that is
not affected by the phenotype, this feature can help investigators to
eliminate non—causal variants. It can also be used to identify IBD
segments. For example, Figure 3b clearly illustrates an IBD segment
between the second order relatives HG00119 and HG00124.

2.4 Comprehensive annotation to genomic variants

For facilitating users to analyse the family genome data, the FGB
can annotate the input genomic variants by integrating with several
knowledge bases. The annotation is performed in three layers: (i)
genetic variants, (ii) transcriptional and translational consequences
caused by the variants and (iii) potential phenotypes.

For genetic variants, dbSNP records and LDs are annotated to
the variants. The FGB retrieves dbSNP records based on chromo—
somal positions of the variants, and provides dbSNP IDs and corres—
ponding links to dbSNP website for the variants in the ‘Variant List’
tab. If a variant is recorded in dbSNP but unnamed in the input VCF
file, the queried dbSNP ID is shown in the ‘Browser View’ tab as the
name of the variant. In this case, we append a ""’ to the dbSNP ID
to distinguish the unnamed variants from the variants that already
have dbSNP IDs in the input VCF file. For VCF files that have been
annotated with an earlier version of dbSNP, users can quickly focus
on variants that are submitted to the later versions of dbSNP
recently.

LD describes the non—random association of alleles in population
genetics, which is very useful in family based studies. The FGB visu—
alizes LDs by the curves connecting the alternative alleles of vari—
ants. Colour gradients of the red curves represent the R2 values of
LDs between the alleles. The curves are not displayed unless the R2
values are >0.2. The LD curves can be optionally displayed or hid—
den by clicking the ‘LDs’ switch on the top—right corner of the
‘Browser View’ tab (Fig. 1f).

Transcripts of genes are displayed on the right of genetic variants.
By switching the option buttons left and right (Fig. 1f), users can se—
lectively view a single transcript, all transcripts of a gene, or all tran-
scripts of all genes in the browsing region. Users can also investigate

the details of genes and transcripts in the HGNC and RefSeq websites
by clicking the names of the genes and the transcripts.

The effects of variants disrupting protein coding, i.e., coding
region variations, are displayed alongside the genes. A variety of
coding region variations, such as amino acid changes, splicing event
changes, etc., play important roles in molecular mechanisms of
genetic diseases. The visualization of the functional effects of genetic
variants can greatly help family based genetic disease studies. The
major coding region variations are summarized in Table 1.

For the phenotype analysis, OMIM records that are associated
to genes in the browsing region can be queried and displayed by
clicking the ‘OMIM record’ button, if applicable. Similar to the
dbSNP, HGNC and RefSeq annotations, the FGB provides links to
the corresponding OMIM webpage for details of OMIM entries.

2.5 Detail information

The position, alleles, dbSNP ID and genotype of the variant are dis—
played when users hover over an individual variant (Fig. 1 g). To fur-
ther investigate the genotypes of a variant in the whole family, users
can view the variant genotypes of all samples in the input VCF file
by selecting a variant (Fig. 2d). The genotypes are displayed in the
right—bottom corner of the symbols of family members in the pedi-
gree chart, and in the eighth column of the individual list. If the LDs
option is on, LD curves irrelevant to the selected variant are hidden
for highlighting the ones connected to it. If the selected variant
locates in a protein—coding region, its effect, such as amino acid
change, is also highlighted using a bold typeface. Moreover, more
detailed variant annotation data from the VCF fields is displayed in
a ‘Detail Window’ (Fig. 1h).

Users may also browse the displayed variants in the ‘Variant
List’ tab (Fig. 1e). The detail information of the variants, such as ID,
type, chromosomal position, alternates, genotypes, effects in pro—
tein—coding region, the corresponding dbSNP ID and link to dbSNP
website, etc., are listed in a table. In the table, the variants are sorted
by their chromosomal positions. Users can also select any variant in
the table to view its genotypes in the whole family.

2.6 Automatic detection of de novo mutations,
compound heterozygous variants

Bird’s Eye View is a three—column genome view (Fig. 1d). All
chromosomes are displayed as rectangle buttons in the left. The
heights of rectangles are proportionate to the lengths of the corres—
ponding chromosomes. When a chromosome is selected, the cyto—
bands of the chromosome are displayed in a chromosome shape in
the middle. When a cytoband is selected, the genes located in the
selected cytoband are listed in the right area. Clicking on the gene
symbols, users can view the corresponding region in the ‘Browser
View’ tab.

In the ‘Bird’s Eye View’ tab, the FGB can scan an individual
genome to detect de novo mutations and compound heterozygous
variants in coding regions of a selected individual. De novo muta—
tions do not present on parents. Coding region de novo mutations,
especially the non—synonymous ones, may cause dominant genetic
diseases that do not affect the parents. Compound heterozygous
variants, inherited from the father and the mother, respectively, are
both non—synonymous and locate in the same gene. The parents may
appear normal as they still have the reference allele, but the
offspring can be affected by the recessive disease, for he/she inherits
both deleterious variants.

After scanning, potential high risk genes containing the two
kinds of suspicious variants are highlighted with red, blue or purple

marks. Red marks indicate the genes containing coding region de
novo mutations. Blue marks indicate the genes containing com—
pound heterozygous variants. Purple marks indicate the genes
containing both of them. Similarly, red, blue or purple marks are
labelled to the cytobands and chromosomes containing colour—
marked genes. The detection of de novo mutations and compound
heterozygous variants can be performed on the whole genome or a
selected chromosome/cytoband. The variants data of the selected
individual’s parents should be available in the input VCF files. This
feature offers investigators an automatic method to find candidates
of disease—related genes and disease—causing variants for rare genetic
disease patients whose parents appear normal.

2.7 Navigation

In the ‘Browser View’ tab, the axis and the range of current brows—
ing region are displayed in the left. Moving the cursor over the axis,
a horizontal line and the corresponding coordinate are shown to
help users positioning the variants, the genes and coding region
variations. By clicking and dragging the cursor on the axis, users can
navigate to an interested browsing region.

Besides, the FGB provides flexible navigation ways to enable
users to view a desired genomic region by specifying the genomic co-
ordinates or gene symbols, as well as panning and zooming the
browsing region. Users can also navigate to the corresponding
region of a selected gene in the ‘Bird’s Eye View’ tab.

In different zooming levels, the FGB displays the variants in differ—
ent ways to avoid requesting over—sufficient data beyond the display
limit. For browsing region <50 bases, reference genome sequences are
shown by colours and letters instead of a simple axis. For browsing
region >50 bases and <425 bases, reference genome sequences are
shown by colours only. For the displayed variants number <55, the
FGB displays dots to represent alternative alleles of the variants at
their chromosomal positions, and labels the variants’ names to the
dots. For variants number >55 and <270, the FGB displays dots
only. For variants number >270, the FGB divides the browsing region
into dozens of bins and displays histogram bars to show the relative
variants number in each bin (Fig. 3). In this resolution, the black—
coloured dots are not displayed as the dots are illegible. If applicable,
colourful dots are replaced by dozens of coloured mosaics, for helping
users to recognize de novo mutations, recombination events, IBD
segments, etc. The FGB is able to visualize family genomes from a sin-
gle nucleotide to a whole chromosome in the ‘Browser View’ panel.

More details about the interfaces and usages of the FGB are
available at http://mlg.hit.edu.cn/FGB/tutorial.html.

3 Implementation

The FGB is a browser/server architecture—based web application.
The back end of the FGB is implemented in JAVA. Apache Tomcat
is used to provide web services. The genomic data processing results
are packed into XML objects for transferring and displaying. In the
front end of the FGB, the Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
(AJAX) technique is adopted for exchanging data asynchronously
between the browser and the server to avoid full page reloads. The
scalable vector graphics (SVG) is used as the graphic engine to plot
visual elements and to interact with users. The advances of the SVG
enable the FGB to be freely zoom in and out while remaining the
high definition of the visualization, and thus can be used on display
devices in any resolution.

Comprehensive resources are integrated in the FGB to annotate
family genomes, including hg19, dbSNP142, LD, HGNC, RefSeq,

OMIM, etc. Most of the genomic annotation data were downloaded
from the UCSC genome browser database (Karolchik et al., 2014).
The LD R2 values used in FGB are calculated based on 1000 gen—
omes phase 3 dataset (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) by
PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007). Related individuals are excluded in the
LD calculation. Tabix API (Li, 2011) is embedded in FGB for pars-
ing the Bgzip/Tabix compressed/indexed VCF files.

mlg.hit.edu.cn/FGB/. For general questions regarding the FGB,
please contact user support via email at pgbrowser@gmail.com. The
FGB is best accessed using Google Chrome and works smoothly as
well with other web—browsers, including Mozilla Firefox, Safari,
Microsoft Internet Explorer (Version 10 or later), Opera, etc. A
tutorial of the FGB is available at http://mlg.hit.edu.cn/FGB/tutorial.
html. Users may freely obtain a copy (http://mlg.hit.edu.cn/FGB/
FGB-1.0.tar.gz) of the FGB to install it locally. The source codes of
the FGB are also publicly available at GitHub (https://github.com/

4 Discussion

The FGB provides investigators accurate, comprehensive and global
visualization for family genomes. The visualization of family
genomes is an important and special case of multiple genome visual—
ization. First, the relations and phenotypes of family members are
essential for family based studies, and should be described and inte—
grated in variant—level genome visualization. Second, the similarity
between the genomes of consanguineous family members is much
higher than the similarity between unrelated individuals. Thus the
redundancy of family genomes should be well—handled in visualiza—
tion. The FGB is designed and developed to achieve these special
requirements, and provides users accurate and appropriate visualiza—
tion for family genomes.

Though the VCF files support the storage of variants of multiple
genomes, the pedigree information, e.g., genders, relations and
phenotypes of the multiple genomes, can hardly be described by the
data format. The FGB accepts the de facto standard format, PED
format, as the input format of pedigree information, integrates the
pedigree information with the VCF data, then analyses and visual—
izes the genomic variants in the three versatile analysis modes. By
using a single or combination of the three analysis modes, users are
able to properly investigate family genomes in variant—level, such as
distinguishing paternal variants, maternal variants and de novo
mutations, identifying potential recombination events and IBD seg—
ments, finding or eliminating disease—causing variants and genes,
etc.

As the solution to reduce the redundancy in family genomes, the
FGB displays an individual—centered genome view, and coloured
variants to show their presence/absence states on genomes of other
family members. Comparing genomes is the most basic purpose of
the multiple genomes visualization. Comparative genomics visual—
ization tools focus on visualizing large—scale differences among gen—
omes of different species. Human multiple genomes visualization
tools are committed to visualize 3 million differences, not 3 billion
bases. For family genome visualization, differences are far <3 million.
Thus the FGB chooses the individual—centered genome view as the
basis of the comparison, and enables users to concentrate on
differences/similarities between the central individual and a group of
specified family members. This feature avoids showing dozens of
similar genomes aligned together, which is not only hard to capture
the key information, but also costly in performance. By selecting the

switchable central individual, the comparing group of individuals,
and the analysis mode, users may fully customize the analysis
method and the family members to be analysed, then view the ana—
lysis result. To further investigate a particular variant, users can se—
lect the variant and view its genotypes in the whole family.

The FGB provides comprehensive annotations for family gen-
omes. dbSNP memberships, LDs, genes and variants functional ef-
fects, potential associated phenotypes, etc., are efficiently annotated
to the displayed genetic variants on the fly. This feature may help
users to understand the details and the potential functional effects of
the variants comprehensively, and thus to quickly locate the suspi—
cious variants.

The FGB offers a function to automatically detect de novo muta—
tions and compound heterozygous variants by scanning the genomes
of the selected individual and his/her parents. Based on two common
models of disease inheritance, dominant model and recessive model,
the FGB searches rare variants or rare combinations of variants that
may cause genetic diseases. This feature guides users to create global
insight of high risk genes on the selected individual.

Advanced bioinformatics technologies, such as asynchronous
data transferring, SVG, ﬂexible navigation options, legibility—based
data detail limiting, etc., have been adopted to improve the FGB per—
formance, such as reducing the bandwidth requirements, balancing
the server load and improving the user experiences. With increas—
ingly producing family genomes, the FGB can be widely used to dis—
play, interpret and analyse family genomes and greatly benefit
academic researchers and clinical physicians.

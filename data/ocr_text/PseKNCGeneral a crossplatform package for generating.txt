ABSTRACT

Summary: The avalanche of genomic sequences generated in the
post-genomic age requires efficient computational methods for rapidly
and accurately identifying biological features from sequence informa-
tion. Towards this goal, we developed a freely available and open-
source package, called PseKNC-General (the general form of
pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition), that allows for fast and ac-
curate computation of all the widely used nucleotide structural and
physicochemical properties of both DNA and RNA sequences.
PseKNC-General can generate several modes of pseudo nucleotide
compositions, including conventional k-tuple nucleotide compositions,
Moreau—Broto autocorrelation coefficient, Moran autocorrelation coef-
ficient, Geary autocorrelation coefficient, Type | PseKNC and Type II
PseKNC. In every mode, >100 physicochemical properties are avail-
able for choosing. Moreover, it is flexible enough to allow the users to
calculate PseKNC with user-defined properties. The package can be
run on Linux, Mac and Windows systems and also provides a graph-
ical user interface.

Availability and implementation: The package is freely available at:
http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/pseknc.

1 INTRODUCTION

The pseudo nucleotide composition was proposed in 2011 (Zhou
et al., 2011), and its basic algorithm was elaborated in a recent
study (Chen et al., 2014a). Compared with the conventional nu-
cleotide composition, pseudo nucleotide compositions have the
advantage of converting DNA sequences of various lengths to a

ﬁxed-length digital vector to enable sequence comparison, while
at the same time keeping the long-range sequence order informa-
tion. Since its introduction, pseudo nucleotide compositions have
been applied in many branches of computational genomics, such
as predicting promoters (Zhou et al., 2013), predicting recombin-
ation spots (Chen et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2012; Qiu et al., 2014),
predicting nucleosome positioning sequences (Guo et al., 2014),
predicting DNA methylation status (Zhou et al., 2011), predict-
ing splice sites (Chen et al., 2014b), identifying translation initi-
ation site (Chen et al., 2014c) and so on.

Currently, the only available tool for generating pseudo nucleo-
tide compositions is the recently developed online web server
PseKNC (Chen et al., 2014a). However, PseKNC can process at
most only 100 sequences in one submission, and also is limited to
only DNA sequences and a small number of physicochemical fea-
tures. No software is available for processing large-scale datasets
with the ﬂexibility of adjusting algorithm parameters used in the
calculation. This fact decreases the efﬁciency of the related studies.

In the present work, we provide a cross-platform stand-alone
and open-source package, called PseKNC-General, which could
convert large-scale sequence datasets to pseudo nucleotide com-
positions with numerous choices of physicochemical property
combinations. It can not only deal with DNA but also with
RNA sequences. Moreover, a graphical user interface (GUI)
shell program is also provided along with the command-line
version. To our knowledge, PseKNC-General is the first open-
source package that can encode a large number of genomic se-
quences based on user-deﬁned physicochemical properties.

2 PACKAGE DESCRIPTION

The current PseKNC-General package can generate a large
number of features as summarized in Table 1. These features
can be divided into three groups. The ﬁrst group includes six
features: nucleotide composition (1-tuple), dinucleotide compos-
ition (2-tuple), trinucleotide composition (3-tuple), tetranucleo-
tide composition (4-tuple), pentanucleotide composition (5—tuple)

and hexanucleotide composition (6-tuple). The second group
contains three feature sets: Moreau-Broto autocorrelation coef-
ﬁcient (Feng and Zhang, 2000), Moran autocorrelation coefﬁ-
cient (Horne, 1988) and Geary autocorrelation coefﬁcient (Sokal
and Thomson, 2006). These three autocorrelation features de-
scribe the level of correlation between two k-tuple nucleotides
in terms of their speciﬁc structural and/or physicochemical prop-
erties. The third group consists of two types of pseudo k-tuple
nucleotide compositions: Type I PseKNC and Type II PseKNC.

Compared with the PseKNC server, PseKNC-General has the
following major advantages and improvements.

First, PseKNC-General is a stand-alone program and can be
run on local computers. It does not require uploading sequences
to the server and hence can process large-scale datasets with no
data-size limit. Therefore, it is faster and easier to generate the
pseudo k-tuple compositions and to adjust the parameters.

Second, PseKNC-General can be used for not only DNA se-
quences but also RNA sequences.

Third, PseKNC-General incorporates additional structural
and physicochemical properties (Supplementary Material S1),
and more conveniently allows users to add or specify their own
structural and physicochemical properties. It is thus both more
ﬂexible and more expandable.

Fourth, a user-friendly GUI is also provided along with the
command-line program. Every parameter in PseKNC-General
can be easily conﬁgured from the GUI. Hence, users can com-
fortably choose the mode that they prefer to run the program.
All the source code together with the detailed illustration docu-
ments of the package can be freely downloaded from http://lin.
uestc.edu.cn/server/pseknc.

Finally, results can be saved in three different ﬁle formats: the
LibSVM format, the CSV format and the tab-delimited format.
All these formats are suitable for downstream computational
analyses, such as machine learning.

3 CONCLUSIONS

The continued expansion of genomic sequences necessitates the
development of computational tools to annotate functional

elements from DNA or RNA sequences. One of the important
tasks is to formulate the genomic sequences with an effective
expression form that can reﬂect the intrinsic correlation with
their structures and functions. PseKNC-General makes this
task readily achievable for any expert and/or non-expert users
via its highly ﬂexible, conﬁgurable and user-friendly design. It
allows for fast and accurate computation of a broad range of
physicochemical properties of k-tuple nucleotide in DNA/RNA
sequences. The effectiveness and usefulness of these properties
have been demonstrated by a series of existing works. Hence, we
anticipate that PseKNC-General will become a useful package in
exploring problems concerning computational genomics and
genome sequence analysis. In the future, we will collect more
experimental physicochemical properties for other k-tuple nu-
cleotides (k = 4, 5 or higher) and integrate them into the current
version of PseKNC-General to further enhance its power.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: In the noisy cellular environment, stochastic fluctuations
at the molecular level manifest as cell—cell variability at the population
level that is quantifiable using high-throughput single-cell measure-
ments. Such variability is rich with information about the cell’s under-
lying gene regulatory networks, their architecture and the parameters
of the biochemical reactions at their core.

Results: We report a novel method, called Inference for Networks of
Stochastic Interactions among Genes using High-Throughput data
(INSIGHT), for systematically combining high-throughput time-course
flow cytometry measurements with computer-generated stochastic
simulations of candidate gene network models to infer the network’s
stochastic model and all its parameters. By exploiting the mathemat-
ical relationships between experimental and simulated population
histograms, INSIGHT achieves scalability, efficiency and accuracy
while entirely avoiding approximate stochastic methods. We demon-
strate our method on a synthetic gene network in bacteria and show
that a detailed mechanistic model of this network can be estimated
with high accuracy and high efficiency. Our method is completely
general and can be used to infer models of signal-activated gene
networks in any organism based solely on flow cytometry data and
stochastic simulations.

Availability: A free C source code implementing the INSIGHT algo-
rithm, together with test data is available from the authors.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene regulation has been long recognized as an intrinsically
stochastic process (Elowitz et al., 2002; Ozbudak et al., 2002).
The possibly low copy numbers of the molecules involved, to-
gether with their random motion inside the cell, can cause gen-
etically identical organisms to display different phenotypes based
on variability alone ONeinberger et al., 2005). Ongoing progress
in single cells measurement techniques is producing high-
throughput datasets that allow for an increasingly accurate char-
acterization of such variability.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Stochastic computational models of gene regulation can be of
great assistance in processing large amounts of experimental data
and extracting information from it. The framework of stochastic
chemical kinetics (Gillespie, 1976) has been successfully used to
develop predictive models of systems in which random ﬂuctu-
ations are important (Arkin et al., 1998; Munsky et al., 2009;
Neuert et al., 2013). Although models of this type cannot be
solved directly, except for small-dimensional cases (Munsky
and Khammash, 2006), they can be simulated exactly for how-
ever long and however many times is necessary to obtain the
desired statistical information (Gillespie, 1977). However, sto-
chastic simulations are computationally expensive; therefore,
estimating distributions or computing summary statistics to a
high accuracy can be prohibitive. Alternatively, one can resort
to more compact approximate descriptions of the stochastic
models, which are easier to simulate, but introduce additional
error and are not applicable in all cases (Elf and Ehrenberg,
2003; Gillespie, 2000; Singh and Hespanha, 2011).

Computational models have proven to be a valuable tool in
advancing the understanding of complex biological phenomena
and in assisting the design of synthetic gene networks (Antunes
and De Schutter, 2012; Elowitz and Leibler, 2000). Ideally,
models should be able to recapitulate the known experimental
observations on a process of interest and to generate new
insights, which are in turn testable in new experiments. Even
when pathway structure inference is able to identify the key
players in the process under study, and their interactions
(Marbach et al., 2012), to build a complete model, one critical
challenge must be overcome: the determination of the many un-
known parameters that will inevitably appear in it. These are
numbers such as production and degradation rates, binding
afﬁnities and so forth, which are difﬁcult to measure directly.
Usually, the only available option is to measure other variables
involved in the models, such as abundances of proteins of inter-
est, and to use these measurements to infer the parameters
indirectly using a dedicated computational procedure.

The problem of parameter inference for stochastic gene net-
work models has attracted much interest in recent years, and a
number of solutions have been proposed. In maximum-likelihood
approaches, one tries to select the parameter values that maxi-
mize the probability that the model generates the observed
experimental data. This has been achieved using approximations
(Reinker et al., 2006), stochastic simulations (Daigle et al., 2012;
Tian et al., 2007; Yuanfeng et al., 2010) and by direct solution of
the stochastic models (Neuert et al., 2013). Maximum-likelihood

techniques have been demonstrated on biological examples,
albeit on relatively small-dimensional models. Bayesian methods
represent another attractive option. Unlike the maximum-likeli-
hood ones, these algorithms can find many parameter values that
are compatible with the experimental data, thereby producing
not only point estimates but also confidence intervals. The
issues related to computational cost, however, become even
more severe in this case because Bayesian methods operate by
testing a large number of candidate parameter values. For each
candidate, many simulations are needed to determine whether
the model output is consistent with the data. Consequently, the
Bayesian framework has been mostly applied to approximate
models (Golightly and Wilkinson, 2011; Komorowski et al.,
2009; Zechner et al., 2012). Simulation-based methods have
also been proposed (Toni et al., 2009) and applied with success
(Liepe et al., 2012; Toni et al., 2012). In the present study, we
extend their applicability to higher-dimensional stochastic
chemical reaction networks by exploiting the properties of ﬂow
cytometry and other high-throughput datasets to significantly
improve the computational efficiency of the inference process.

2 RESULTS

2.1 A metric for comparing experimental and simulated
ﬂuorescence samples

Likelihood-free Bayesian methods, collectively known under the
name of Approximate Bayesian Computation { ABC ), can be used
to infer unknown parameters in a model whenever the likelihood
function is not available or too expensive to evaluate. They work
by replacing the intractable likelihood computations with a
metric that measures the distance between model simulations
and experimental data. The key idea is to generate and test a
large number of candidate parameter sets, also known as par-
ticles, and to keep track of the ones that yield simulations that
are ‘close enough’ to the experimental data. The most basic ABC
algorithm can be outlined as follows.

(1) Generate a particle 6* from a prior distribution p(6).
(2) Generate a simulated dataset X 9* using 6*.

(3) Evaluate the distance d(X9*, Y), where Y is the experimen-
tal dataset and d is a metric of choice.

(4) If d(X9*, Y) 3 e, where e>0 is a tolerance, accept the
particle 6*, that is keep it as a suitable parameter set.
Otherwise, discard it.

(5) Repeat until enough accepted particles are collected.

It can be shown that this procedure generates samples from an
approximate posterior distribution of the unknown parameters,
specifically the distribution p(6|d(X, Y) 3 e) (Pritchard et al.,
1999 and Supplementary Section S2).

Implementing an approach of this kind for stochastic models
of gene regulation is challenging for two main reasons. First, to
obtain a sufficient number of accepted particles to construct a
good approximation of the target posterior distribution, a large
number of candidates need to be generated and tested.
Furthermore, many computationally expensive stochastic simu-
lations are required to simulate the dataset to test each candidate.

In a previous study (Lillacci and Khammash, 2011), we
investigated the properties of a specific metric for comparing
simulated and experimental ﬂow cytometry datasets. The latter
typically contains data acquired from several tens of thousands
of individual cells. The intensity of light emitted by each cell can
be thought of as a sample of the ﬂuorescence distribution at the
time of acquisition. On the computational side, the stochastic
gene regulation model can be used to generate simulated samples
of the ﬂuorescence levels. Given the two sets of samples, which
we denote X and Y, the goal is to establish with high confidence
whether the samples in X and the ones in Y came from the same
distribution. In other words, if we denote F the distribution of
the experimental samples and G the distribution of the simulated
samples, we seek to test the null hypothesis F = G.

We proceed by computing the empirical cumulative distribution
functions (ECDFs) associated with the two sets of samples,
denoted G X and Fy, respectively. We then measure their
Kolmogorov distance, which is defined as follows:

GX — FY (1)

The subscripts S and M denote that the sets X and Ycontain S
and M samples, respectively. By the properties of norms, dSM in
(1) can be bounded as:

dSM(éXa FY) E

= d5 (6X, F) + 01,403}, 

dSM (GA/Y, 13 Y) =

GAX—FH -I-

 

 

FY —  00 (2)

We note that the quantities ds and dM in (2), which represent
the Kolmogorov distances of the ECDFs GX and FY from the
unknown exact data CDF, are random variables, as their values
change depending on the particular sets of samples X and Y that
are observed. However, their null distribution is known. In other
words, under the null hypothesis F = G, it is possible to calculate
the probability that their value is less (or more) than a given
threshold:

P{dS(GX,F> g elF= G} = KS(6). (3)

KS is called the Kolmogorov distribution, and even though it is
not known in closed form, it can be evaluated numerically with
high precision (Marsaglia et al., 2003). One key fact to note is
that K S does not depend of F but only on the number of samples
S. Using this property, we can compute a critical value for d5:
under the null hypothesis, d5 will be smaller than or equal to
6(C)(a, S) = K§1(l — a) with probability 1 — a. In other words, it
is possible to find a threshold 6(0) such that, if F: G, the
Kolmogorov distance of a random ECDF GX from F will be
smaller than or equal to 6(0) with high probability. Similarly,
we can compute a critical value for the other distance:
dM (13}, F g e<c>(a, M) = K3410 — a) with probability 1 — a.

In summary, under the null hypothesis, the following inequal-
ity must hold with probability at least 1 — ,6 = (l — 002:

dSM(GX, FY) g K§1(1 — a) + 1970 — a). (4)

The numbers of samples S and M, together with the probabil-
ity ,8, which represents the confidence level of the test, define a
critical value for dSM. In other words, if dSM is under the critical

value, then with probability at least 1 — ,8, the two sets of samples
came from the same distribution. Equivalently, the distribution
of the simulated ﬂuorescence levels matches the distribution of
the experimental ﬂuorescence levels.

In our setting, the number of experimental samples M is ﬁxed
by the number of events in the ﬂow cytometry dataset. The
conﬁdence level ,6 is also ﬁxed. Common values for ,6 include
0.1, 0.05 and 0.01, corresponding to 90, 95 and 99% conﬁdence.
If we now ﬁx the critical value for dSM to a desired tolerance e,
we can solve (4) for S and ﬁnd the number of stochastic simu-
lations required to verify whether dSM is below that tolerance
with probability at least 1 — ,8. We thus obtain a ‘critical’
number of simulations S“), which is the smallest integer such
that:

K§1(l —a) Z 6 — K3410 — oz). (5)

If M is large, which is typically the case for ﬂow cytometry and
other high-throughput datasets, then S“) is surprisingly small,
allowing for the comparison of the two sets of samples to be
carried out in a computationally efﬁcient manner. A more
extensive treatment of the properties of the Kolmogorov metric
and of the derivation of S“) is presented in the Supplementary
Section Sl.

2.2 Bayesian parameter inference of stochastic gene
regulation models is feasible using ﬂow cytometry and
stochastic simulations

Equipped with a computationally efﬁcient way of comparing
experimental and simulated ﬂuorescence samples, one can per-
form parameter inference within the framework of ABC. We
have devised a novel method, referred to as Inference for
Networks of Stochastic Interactions among Genes using High-
Throughput data (INSIGHT), to select parameter values in
such a way that the model-generated ﬂuorescence distributions
match the experimental ones from ﬂow cytometry (Figure 1).
Our proposed approach proceeds by iterating through multiple
stages, in the following way.

(1) Initialization: set prior densities to specify the region of the
parameter space to be searched; set an initial value of the
distance tolerance e.

(2) Find the number of simulations S“) corresponding to e.

(3) a. Propose a candidate parameter value.
b. Run S“) stochastic simulations of the model.

c. Compute the distance dSM of the model-generated
ﬂuorescence distributions from the experimental ones.

d. If dSM g e, ‘accept’ the candidate, i.e. keep it as a
plausible value, otherwise reject it.

e. Repeat until enough accepted candidates to approximate
the parameter distribution are collected.

(4) Reduce e and repeat from step 2 until the desired accuracy
is achieved, or the model cannot ﬁt the data any better.

Each INSIGHT stage is associated with a speciﬁc tolerance.
In the first stage, the candidates are generated by random

Fig. 1. The INSIGHT algorithm and its operation. The proposed ap-
proach uses time-dependent ﬂow cytometry histograms to determine un-
known parameters in stochastic models of gene regulation. In case of
uncertain model structure, multiple candidates can be ﬁt to the same
data set and then compared in terms of their ability to ﬁt the data. The
INSIGHT algorithm itself comprises two nested loops. In the outer loop,
a tolerance is ﬁrst ﬁxed. Owing to the properties of the Kolmogorov
metric, one can then calculate how many stochastic simulations are
required to compare experimental distributions and model-simulated
samples up to that tolerance. In the inner loop, an approximation of
the posterior density of the unknown parameters for the speciﬁed toler-
ance is computed. Next, the control is returned to the outer loop,
where the tolerance is set to a smaller value and the process is repeated
until the desired accuracy is achieved, or the model cannot ﬁt the data
any better.

sampling from the prior densities. Each candidate is tested to
check whether the corresponding model simulations match the
data up to the tolerance of that stage. The collection of the can-
didates that satisfy the current matching condition, i.e. of the
accepted particles, constitutes the output of the algorithm for
the current stage. In each subsequent stage, the new candidates
are generated by randomly picking values from the accepted
particles of the previous stage. The candidates are now required
to satisfy a stricter matching condition, corresponding to a lower
tolerance. This process is repeated until the desired tolerance is
achieved or the model simulations cannot match the data any
better. The ﬁnal result is a sequence of collections of accepted
particles, associated to a sequence of decreasing tolerances. Each
collection represents a set of samples from the approximate pos-
terior density of the parameters p(6|dSM(X, Y) 3 e), where e is
the corresponding tolerance.

We remark that there exists a precise relationship between a
value of the tolerance and the number of stochastic simulations
required to determine whether the experimental and the simu-
lated distributions match up to that tolerance. As the matching
condition needs to be checked for every candidate, and owing to
the high computational cost of stochastic simulations, the ability
to use a small number of them to test the candidates quickly and
accurately is crucial to the feasibility of the method. Further
details on ABC and the development of the proposed
INSIGHT algorithm are given in the Supplementary Section S2.

2.3 A stochastic birth—death model is identiﬁed with high
accuracy and high efﬁciency using INSIGHT

To demonstrate the key ideas of the method, we ﬁrst applied it to
a simple example, known as the birth—death process (Figure 2A).
This stochastic chemical reaction network describes the constitu-
tive production and degradation of a single chemical species, in
this case a ﬂuorescent protein (FP). The model keeps track of the
molecular counts of the FP, which can only be changed by the
random occurrences of two reactions: the creation of a new FP
molecule (‘birth’) and the degradation of an existing FP molecule
(‘death’). The number of FF molecules in the system at a given
time cannot be observed directly, but only indirectly through the
emitted ﬂuorescence. In analogy to Munsky et al. (2009), we
assume that each molecule of FF emits a normally distributed
random amount of ﬂuorescence when excited by light of suitable
wavelength (Supplementary Section Sl.2). The mean and stand-
ard deviation of the ﬂuorescence emitted by a single FP molecule
are generally unknown. Therefore, we include them among the
parameters to be estimated. This brings the total number of
unknown parameters in the birth—death model to 4, which is
the birth rate, the death rate and the mean and standard devi-
ation of the unit of emitted ﬂuorescence.

We assumed the following values for the parameters: 7.5, 0.75,
100 and 20, respectively. Using these numbers, we generated a

simulated ﬂow cytometry dataset, in which the system is
observed at ﬁve different time points: 0, 0.5, l, 2 and 10h
(Figure 2B). We then assumed that the parameters were un-
known, and we applied the INSIGHT algorithm to identify
them from the in silico dataset. We started from independent
uniform prior densities. Figure 2C shows the joint prior density
of birth rate and death rate and four joint posterior densities for
four decreasing values of the tolerance. We note how, as the
algorithm proceeds, the accepted particles tend to form tighter
and tighter clusters around the ‘true’ values of the rates that were
used to generate the data. This indicates that the parameters are
estimated with high conﬁdence, and that the estimates are in
agreement with the true values. As a result, the ﬂuorescence
intensities generated using the medians of the posterior densities
corresponding to the smallest tolerance are indistinguishable
from the dataset used for the identiﬁcation (Figure 2B).

2.4 Time-dependent ﬂow cytometry measurements of the
Lac-GFP system provide a rich dataset for efﬁcient
inference of a realistic stochastic model

We next applied our proposed INSIGHT algorithm to actual

ﬂow cytometry data. We collected ﬂuorescence distributions

from a synthetic gene regulatory network in Escherichia coli,

distributions (ﬁlled) were generated using the values of 7.5 for the birth reaction rate, 0.75 for the death reaction rate and 100 and 20 for the mean and

lines) shifts from 500 to 1000. The ‘true’ values were, then, assumed unknown, and the four parameters were estimated using the INSIGHT algorithm.
The distributions computed using the estimated parameters (dashed lines) are almost indistinguishable from the dataset. (C) Evolution of the joint
posterior density of the birth rate and the death rate. As the INSIGHT algorithm proceeds, the simulations are required to match the data with increasing

values of the parameters (solid lines) are well approximated by the medians of the posterior densities (dashed lines)

The signal within the noise

 

which we refer to as Lac-GFP (Figure 3A). The Lac-GFP system
contains the unstable GFP variant GFP(LVA) (Andersen et al.,
1998) under control of the Lac promoter. GFP expression is
induced by addition of isopropyl ,B-D-l-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG), which inhibits the constitutively expressed repressor pro-
tein LacI. To measure and properly account for background
ﬂuorescence (Supplementary Section Sl.2), we used a negative
control plasmid without the gfp gene. As the control cells contain
no GFP, the ﬂuorescence that is observed when measuring them
can be ascribed to autoﬂuorescence of the host strain and to
instrumental error.

The background ﬂuorescence distribution was measured in
three different experimental conditions, namely, right before in-
duction (0 h) and 5 h after induction of the control cells with 10 uM
IPTG or 100 uM IPTG. The three background distributions are
practically indistinguishable, suggesting that the background
ﬂuorescence is not affected by IPTG concentration or by time
(Figure 4A). In all the subsequent experiments, the 0-h distribution
of the negative control cells was always used as background. GFP
ﬂuorescence distributions from the Lac-GFP system were col-
lected right before induction (0 h), and 2, 3, 4 and 5 h after induc-
tion of the Lac-GFP cells with 10 uM IPTG (Figure 4B).

We formulated a detailed stochastic gene regulation model of
the Lac-GFP system, referred to as Lac-GFP—wt, in which nine
chemical species interact through 18 reactions (Figure 3B and
Supplementary Section S3.l). The LacI repressor protein is
constitutively expressed and degraded, and it can form homodi—
mers. The dimers recognize the operator sequences on the Lac
promoter (Plac) and bind to them, forming a tetrameric structure

Fig. 3. The Lac-GFP system. (A) Gene regulation in the Lac-GFP
system. In uninduced conditions, the constitutively expressed LacI repres-
sor protein binds to the Lac promoter (Plac) and inhibits transcription.
The addition of isopropyl ,B-D-l-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inhibits
LacI, thereby inducing the expression of GFP(LVA). (B) The Lac-GFP-
wt stochastic model. The model is composed of 18 reactions that can
randomly occur and change the molecular counts of nine interacting
chemical species. The total number of unknown parameters in the
model is 20

that prevents transcription initiation. To account for the leaki-
ness of Plac, we allow GFP transcription from the unoccupied,
partially occupied, and fully occupied Plac. However, the likeli-
hood of successful transcription initiation is highest for an
unoccupied promoter, much lower for a partially occupied pro-
moter bound to a LacI dimer, and low for a fully occupied pro-
moter bound to a LacI tetramer. The newly synthesized GFP
protein does not ﬂuoresce right away but only after a certain
maturation time. lacI mRNA, LacI protein, gﬁ) mRNA and
GFP protein are all subject to degradation. The effect of IPTG
is modeled as a concentration-dependent increase in the
LacI degradation rate. This is justiﬁed by the fact that our
model only keeps track of functional LacI that can bind to
Plac. The relationship is assumed to be linear, which is of
the following form: total degradation rate=basal
degradation+coefﬁcient x IPTG concentration. The mature
GFP protein emits green light on excitation with blue light.
Each GFP molecule is assumed to emit a normally distributed
random amount of ﬂuorescence, with ﬁxed mean and standard
deviation (to be estimated). The total number of unknown par-
ameters in the model is 20.

The model, together with the time-dependent GFP ﬂuores-
cence distributions, the background distribution and independ-
ent uniform prior densities encoding intervals of biologically
plausible parameter values (Supplementary Section S3.5) were
supplied to the INSIGHT algorithm. The method returned the
posterior densities of parameter values for which the model simu-
lations match the experimental data, up a tolerance of 0.079
(Supplementary Section S34 and Supplementary Figure S11).
Similarly to the birth—death example, the accepted particles
tend to cluster around the parameter values that, among the
ones speciﬁed in the prior density, are the most likely to be com-
patible with the data.

To assess the accuracy of the estimated parameters, we
compared some of the 95% credible intervals of the posterior
densities to values that have been previously reported in the lit-
erature. For the half-life of GFP(LVA), we obtained an estimate
of (39, 67.5) min, consistent with the value of 40 min previously
reported (Andersen et al., 1998). For the maturation time of
GFP(LVA), we found a conﬁdence interval of (3.3, 7.4) min,
well in agreement with the value of 6.5 min measured before
(Megerle et al., 2008). For the [ad and gfp mRNA half-lives,
the INSIGHT estimates are (5.6, 10.9) min and (2.21, 5.23) min,
respectively, which compare well with the median value in E .coli
of 3.69 min that was previously found (Bernstein et al., 2004).

2.5 The behavior of the INSIGHT algorithm can reveal
fundamental model inaccuracies

As aforementioned, INSIGHT can terminate because the model
simulations cannot ﬁt the experimental data any better. When
this happens, the proposed particles are systematically rejected
by the algorithm, and the inference cannot proceed. This suggests
the presence of a fundamental discrepancy between experiments
and model simulations. In other words, there exist no parameter
values 6 in the space deﬁned by the prior densities such that the
null hypothesis F = G(6) is true.
We deﬁne mismatch index (MI) the quantity:

MI: 1101mm, G(6)). (6)

This number can be bounded above and below by the toler-
ances of the INSIGHT algorithm. Speciﬁcally, a tolerance for
which the candidates are systematically rejected constitutes a
lower bound for MI. To see this, we apply the triangle inequality
twice and write:

dSM(éX(6)a 1'3 r) E 0'14 (F, 13 r) + ds (F, Gil/(9))
g d(F, G(6)) + dM  FY)
¢1
+ d5 (G(6), éX(e)) .
e_,_.
152(9)

which implies:
“(Fa G(9)) Z dSM(éX(6)a 1'3 Y) — ¢1 — (22(9)-

Suppose now that for a given model the proposed particles
are systematically rejected at tolerance 6T (corresponding to
the critical number of simulations S201). This implies
dSM ((2349), FY) > ET for all e, and for all s 3 520.). Therefore,

“IF, G(9)) Z 6T — ¢1 — (22(9)-
Taking the limit as S —> 00, for which ¢2(6) —> 0 for all 6, we
ﬁnally obtain:
MI 3 6T — e1. (7)

In summary, in case of early termination, the tolerance ET for
which the proposed particles are systematically rejected consti-
tutes a lower bound for the MI.

By applying a similar reasoning, one can show that if eT_1 is a
tolerance corresponding to a population of accepted particles, an
upper bound for MI is given by:

MIE €T—1+¢1+¢2(9)- (8)

Both numbers (b1 and (b2 can be upper-bounded (for all 6)
using the properties of the Kolmogorov distance, thereby
giving 6-independent bounds for MI. Further details are pro-
vided in the Supplementary Section S2.4.

We note that the MI upper bound is based on tolerances that
correspond to sets of accepted particles in SMC stages.
Therefore, it represents a certificate of model quality, in the
sense that there exist parameter values for which the MI is less
than or equal to the upper bound with high probability. On the
other hand, the MI lower bound is based on tolerances that
correspond to systematic particle rejection. As in practice, only
a ﬁnite number of candidates can be checked, this may not be
enough to invalidate a model, but it does show that the sampler
was not able to ﬁnd parameter values to certify the model. This
provides evidence against it in comparison with other models
that can be certiﬁed.

2.6 The M1 associated with a model gives a measure
of its ﬁdelity

To demonstrate how the concept of MI constitutes a measure of
model quality, we repeated the inference of the Lac-GFP
system using different model variants and datasets. Speciﬁcally,
we considered the following: Lac-GFP—del, a model in which the
LacI protein is absent, and Lac-GFP—wt, the full model that was
described earlier in the text (Figure 3B). Lac-GFP—del can be
obtained from Lac-GFP—wt by removing all the species and
reactions associated with LacI (Supplementary Section S3.2).

The two models were ﬁrst identiﬁed using wild-type data
(Figure 4B). For each model, we ﬁrst obtained posterior densities
for the parameter values by running the INSIGHT algorithm.
Then, to assess the variability associated with the individual par-
ameter values comprising the posterior densities, we randomly
chose 100 accepted particles for each model, and we compared
the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the data with
the ones of the model simulations computed with each the 100
parameter sets (Figure 5A and B, top plots). Furthermore, we
compared the ﬂuorescence intensities of the models computed
using the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) parameter
estimates to the experimental ﬂuorescence histograms
(Figure 5A and B, bottom plots).

The wild-type model Lac-GFP—wt was run up to a ﬁnal toler-
ance of 0.079, corresponding to an MI value no larger than
0.158. This indicates that its simulated distributions were able
to match the experimental ones with the highest accuracy
(Figure 5B). The simulated CDFs for the 100 randomly selected
accepted particles are also narrowly clustered, suggesting that
any of the parameter values that were picked enables to model
to accurately approximate the data. Conversely, the Lac-GFP—del
model attained a tolerance of 0.268 but was unable to achieve
0.249. The MI upper bound for this model is ~3.4—fold the one of
Lac-GFP—wt. This indicates a poor ability of the model to match
the experimental data. In this case, the simulated CDFs are nar-
rowly clustered, but they are all far from the data CDFs,

Fig. 5. Identiﬁcation of different Lac-GFP models. The INSIGHT algorithm can give indications about fundamental discrepancies between model
simulations and experimental data, measured by the MI. In all panels, the top plots show the time-dependent CDFs of the data (dotted lines) and 100
model-simulated CDFs for 100 different values of the estimated parameters (shaded areas). The bottom plots show the probability density functions of
the data (ﬁlled) and the model-simulated probability density functions corresponding to the MAP estimates of the parameters (dashed lines). (A)
Identiﬁcation of a Lac-GFP model without the LacI protein (Lac-GFP—del). This model can only poorly ﬁt the wild-type data, and all simulated
distributions are far from the experimental data. (B) Identiﬁcation of the full Lac-GFP—wt model. The ﬂow cytometry distributions are ﬁt to a high
accuracy, and the MI upper bound is ~29% of the one attained by the model without LacI. (C) Identiﬁcation of Lac-GFP—del using data from a lac-
negative strain. Here, the model matches the biological process being identiﬁed. As expected, the data are ﬁt almost perfectly, with the model simulations

being indistinguishable from the data

suggesting that the performance of the Lac-GFP—del model is
consistently poor for all accepted particles.

Furthermore, we repeated the identiﬁcation of Lac-GFP—del
using data from a lac-negative bacterial strain (Section 4). As
the model is now matching the experimental conditions, we
expected to obtain a much smaller estimate for the MI. Indeed,
we ran the INSIGHT algorithm up to a tolerance of 0.052, asso-
ciated with an MI upper bound of 0.103 (Figure 5C). The model
simulations using the MAP parameter estimates are indistin-
guishable from the data, and the 100 simulated CDFs are nar-
rowly clustered around the data CDFs.

As an additional control, we performed inference on a model
in which the LacI repressor protein is a mutant that can not form
tetramers (Lac-GFP—mut, Supplementary Section S3.3). Even
though this model presents only a minimal structural difference
from Lac-GFP-wt, the lack of tetramerization prevents the Lac

promoter from being in a fully repressed state. This results in the
model being poorly capable of ﬁtting the wild-type data, as re-
vealed by its high MI between 0.244 and 0.536 (Supplementary
Section S3.7).

3 DISCUSSION

We described a novel Bayesian method for inference of stochastic
gene regulation models using ﬂow cytometry, referred to as
INSIGHT. Our proposed approach uses time-dependent ﬂuores-
cence distributions to ﬁnd the unknown parameters in stochastic
gene regulation models and does so in a way that alleviates many
of the limitations of the existing techniques.

Bayesian methods represent an attractive option for estima-
tion, as they can infer ranges of possible values for the unknown
parameters, as opposed to just point estimates. However, their

use in stochastic gene regulation models has been limited due to
issues of computational feasibility. By choosing the Kolmogorov
metric to evaluate the distance between simulated and experi-
mental ﬂuorescence samples, one can calculate how many
stochastic simulations are needed to determine whether such dis-
tance is above or below a certain tolerance with high probability.
This ﬁts naturally in the framework of ABC, in which metric
conditions of this type are used in place of intractable likelihood
functions to accept or reject candidate parameter values. The
number of simulations, which we denoted S“), decreases as the
number of samples in the experimental dataset increases. In ﬂow
cytometry, one typically collects data from several tens (if not
hundreds) of thousands of individual cells. For many practically
relevant cases, this translates into a surprisingly small value of
S“). As an example, consider our Lac-GFP dataset, which con-
tains 80 000 events for each time point. Comparing model-gen-
erated ﬂuorescence samples to this dataset with a tolerance
e = 0.079, which is enough for an accurate ﬁt (Figure 5B),
requires only 500 simulations. On the 48-core parallel machine,
we used to run the inference, each parallel thread needs to run at
most 11 model simulations. Therefore, each candidate parameter
set can be tested in the time that is necessary to simulate the
model 11 times. In other words, by using the Kolmogorov
metric, it becomes possible to perform ABC inference even for
a large and detailed stochastic model such as Lac-GFP—wt.

A distinctive feature of the INSIGHT method is its ability to
perform inference on the exact stochastic gene regulation models.
Owing to the computational cost of stochastic simulation, many
approaches that have been previously reported have used differ-
ent approximations to replace the stochastic models with
differential equations. In some cases, these can be easier to simu-
late. Although techniques of this type have been used with some
success (Zechner et al., 2012), their validity cannot be guaranteed
in general, as it is difﬁcult to assess a priori whether the approxi-
mate models reproduce the stochastic simulations faithfully. By
relying only on the ability to simulate the models, this issue is
circumvented entirely in the INSIGHT algorithm. Furthermore,
as only samples are required to compare the simulated distribu-
tions with the experimental ones, INSIGHT is not subject to the
model size limitations that are present in some of the approaches
that work by directly solving the stochastic models (Munsky
et al., 2009; Neuert et al., 2013). We also note that INSIGHT,
like other ABC methods, can incorporate any stochastic simula-
tion algorithm, as long as it produces independent simulations.

Another important aspect of INSIGHT is its ability to give
indications as to which structure is the most plausible for a gene
network. As the algorithm proceeds, the simulations are required
to match the data to an increasing degree of accuracy deﬁned by
the decreasing values of the tolerance. We introduced the notion
of MI to describe the situation in which the tolerance cannot be
arbitrarily reduced due to a fundamental discrepancy between
the model and the biological process. We showed how tolerance
values can be used to calculate upper and lower bounds for the
MI and how the MI of a model measures its performance in
reproducing the experimental observations. This feature is par-
ticularly useful in biological problems in which the structure of
the system under study is not fully known. In this situation, one
can write several candidate models corresponding to different
hypotheses and then compare them in terms of their MI.

Similarly to what we found for the Lac-GFP variants, one ex-
pects that the model that can match the data with the highest
ﬁdelity represents the best description of the biological process.

Finally, we asked how signiﬁcant are the computational sav-
ings of INSIGHT compared with a naive approach that does not
take into account the properties of the Kohnogorov metric, spe-
ciﬁcally the connection between the number of events M in the
experimental dataset, the value of the tolerance e and the number
of simulations S“). We found that the theoretical number of
stochastic simulations that would be required to perform
inference to a similar level of accuracy is of the order of 30—50-
fold the number of simulations required by INSIGHT
(Supplementary Section S2.5). For the estimation of the Lac-
GFP-wt model, this would be equivalent to a running time of
almost 3 months versus ~2 days with INSIGHT.

In conclusion, we have shown how the choice of the
Kolmogorov distance to compare experimental ﬂuorescence
histograms and model-generated sample paths can lead to sig-
niﬁcant computational savings in Bayesian parameter inference
of stochastic gene regulation models. This effectively makes
Bayesian analysis feasible in systems that were previously
simply impossible to handle without resorting to approxima-
tions. The proposed INSIGHT algorithm is the ﬁrst Bayesian
method that combines the ability to handle problems of realistic
size, the use of exact stochastic models, the ability to estimate
them by only relying on simulations and the applicability to
actual biological data. A free C source code implementing a
parallel version of INSIGHT, together with the Lac-GFP data
and stochastic models presented in this manuscript, is available
from the authors.

4 MATERIALS AND METHODS

4.1 Stochastic modeling of gene expression

We model stochastic interactions among genes using the framework of
stochastic chemical kinetics introduced in Gillespie, 1976. In this kind of
models, one keeps track of the molecular counts of the chemical species
of interest in the process under study. Under certain assumptions, the
time evolution of the counts can be simulated exactly using the Stochastic
Simulation Algorithm (Gillespie, 1977). A detailed summary of this meth-
odology is presented in the Supplementary Section Sl.

4.2 Construction of the Lac-GFP systems

The experiments for wild-type data collection were conducted using the
E.coli strain MC4100, which is a K-l2 strain containing [F’ proAB
lachZM15 TnlO (TetR)] from XL-l Blue (Agilent Genomics). The nega-
tive control strain was obtained by transforming the plasmid pLAC33
(Warren et al., 2000) into the MC4100 cells. The Lac-GFP synthetic
circuit was obtained by subcloning the unstable GFP variant
GFP(LVA) (Andersen et al., 1998) between the BglII and SphI sites of
pLAC33, thereby removing a part of the TetR gene. This plasmid was
then transformed into the same MC4100 cells to obtain the Lac-GFP
strain. The MC4100 strain, the Lac-GFP plasmid and the pLAC33 vector
were gifts from Prof. David Low’s laboratory (University of California at
Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA).

The experiments for mutant data collection were performed using an
E.coli strain that was obtained by deleting the lac and ara operons from
the strain MGl655. The same Lac-GFP plasmid and pLAC33 vector
were moved into the mutant strain to obtain two new strains: a new
Lac-GFP strain without LacI, referred to as Lac-GFP-del, and the

matching negative control. The mutant strain was a gift from Stephanie
Aoki (ETH Ziirich, Basel, Switzerland).

4.3 Time-dependent ﬂow cytometry measurements

Bacteria were grown in low-salt Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, containing
10 g/l of tryptone, 5g/l of yeast extract and 4g/l of sodium chloride.
Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: 100 ug/ml ampicil—
lin, 40 ug/ml kanamycin and 12.5 ug/ml tetracycline.

Overnight cultures of the Lac-GFP, Lac-GFP-del the two negative
control strains were grown in low-salt LB supplemented with 0.2% glu-
cose (for the wild-type strains) or 1.5% glucose (for the mutant strains)
for 12—16h at 37°C with 230 rpm shaking. The purpose of the glucose
was to ensure full repression of the Lac promoter, even in absence of
LacI. A sample was collected from each overnight culture by diluting a
small aliquot in sterile phosphate-buffered saline. These samples consti-
tuted the Oh time point of the datasets.

The overnight Lac-GFP and Lac-GEP-del cultures were subcultured
to an approximate OD600 of 0.05 and grown in low-salt LB with 10 MM
IPTG at 37°C with 80 rpm shaking. Samples were collected 2, 3, 4 and 5 h
following induction.

Similarly, the overnight negative control cultures were subcultured to
an approximate OD600 of 0.05 with 10 uM and 100 uM IPTG. These were
also grown at 37°C with 80 rpm shaking, and samples were collected
after 5 h.

The collected samples were kept on ice at all times. The ﬂow cytometry
measurements were performed on a BD LSRFortessaTM instrument
(Becton, Dickinson and Co.). The ﬂuidics were operated at the lowest
possible ﬂow rate so that the acquisition rate was consistently kept under
2000 events per second. The cells were excited using a 488 nm blue laser,
operated at the maximum power of 100 mW. The ﬂuorescence emission
from GFP was detected using a 530/30 nm ﬁlter. For each sample,
150000 raw events were recorded. The following voltages were used:
forward scatter 644 V, side scatter 251 V, GFP 500 V.

The events were gated using the software FlowJo (Tree Star Inc.) based
on the forward scatter and side scatter signals. Events that were likely to
have been generated by noise in the acquisition process were identiﬁed by
running samples consisting of phosphate-buffered saline only and
removed.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The sequencing of over a thousand natural strains
of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is producing unparalleled
information at the genetic level for plant researchers. To enable the
rapid exploitation of these data for functional proteomics studies, we
have created a resource for the visualization of protein information
and proteomic datasets for sequenced natural strains of A. thaliana.
Results: The 1001 Proteomes portal can be used to visualize
amino acid substitutions or non-synonymous single-nucleotide
polymorphisms in individual proteins of A. thaliana based on the
reference genome Col-0. We have used the available processed
sequence information to analyze the conservation of known residues
subject to protein phosphorylation among these natural strains. The
substitution of amino acids in A. thaliana natural strains is heavily
constrained and is likely a result of the conservation of functional
attributes within proteins. At a practical level, we demonstrate
that this information can be used to clarify ambiguously defined
phosphorylation sites from phosphoproteomic studies. Protein sets
of available natural variants are available for download to enable
proteomic studies on these accessions. Together this information
can be used to uncover the possible roles of specific amino acids in
determining the structure and function of proteins in the model plant
A. thaliana. An online portal to enable the community to exploit these
data can be accessed at http://1001proteomes.masc-proteomics.

1 INTRODUCTION

The genome sequence of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana
was completed over 10 years ago by a consortium of international
research groups and facilities (Arabidopsis Genome Initiative,
2000). Recently, a project to re- sequence over one thousand genomes
from A. thaliana accessions or natural variants using next— generation
sequencing platforms was initiated (Weigel and Mott, 2009). The

1001 Genomes project will provide unparalleled information for
plant molecular geneticists, as natural variation caused by single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be readily mapped using
genome-wide association studies (Atwell et al., 2010). Currently,
sequence information for over 450 A. thaliana natural strains
are available at 1001 Genomes with a signiﬁcant number of
accessions in the sequencing pipeline (http://1001genomes.org/).
Initial analyses of two re-sequenced A. thaliana natural strains
(Bur-0 and Tsu-1) indicated that SNPs in coding regions resulted
in over 80 000 changes to amino acids (Ossowski et al., 2008).
More recently, with the analysis of 80 A. thaliana accessions
by whole-genome sequencing, over 12 000 SNPs were identiﬁed
that potentially resulted in drastic effects to coding regions (Cao
et al., 2011). These ﬁndings prompted us to investigate whether
this emerging dataset could be exploited to analyze conservation
of functional aspects of protein sequences. In recent years, the
large-scale characterization of protein phosphorylation has become
relatively straightforward due to advances in enrichment and
analysis strategies (Macek et al., 2009). In A. thaliana, many
thousands of phosphorylation sites have been experimentally
characterized using emerging phosphoproteomic techniques (Durek
et al., 2010; Nakagami et al., 2010). We have employed these
distinct datasets to examine whether it is possible to assess the
conservation and corroborate post-translational modiﬁcations in
proteins of A. thaliana. Finally, in order to provide additional
utility to proteomic researchers, we have developed a portal to
provide easy access to the proteomic sequence data resulting
from this newly developed information. This portal is part of a
collection of resources developed by the Proteomics Subcommittee
(Weckwerth et al., 2008) of the Multinational Arabidopsis
Steering Committee (MASCP) and the 1001 Genomes consortium
(Weigel and Mott, 2009) and is available at http://1001proteomes.
masc-proteomics.org/.

2 METHODS

2.1 Construction of protein datasets

Pseudo chromosomes for the A. thaliana reference genome (Col-0)
were obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) and
corresponded to genome release TAIR10 (Swarbreck et al., 2008). SNP
datasets were obtained from available data at the 1001 Genomes portal
(Weigel and Mott, 2009) comprising published sets (Cao et al., 2011;

Schneeberger et al., 2011) and eight unpublished accessions by the
Joint Genome Institute and the Joint BioEnergy Institute. These data
contained pre-computed nucleotide variances (SNPs) against the A. thaliana
reference genome strain Col-0. Accession speciﬁc pseudo chromosomes
were constructed and protein sets extracted using a pipeline employing Perl
and the BiozzPerl libraries (Stajich et al., 2002) as well as gene reference
information available at TAIR.

2.2 Identiﬁcation of protein substitutions

Protein substitutions in the accession speciﬁc protein sets were identiﬁed
using a simple non-aligning difference algorithm that compared amino acids
at equal positions along the protein. This process was implemented using
an in-house program written in C and the resultant output optimized so that
subsequent analyses could simply extract the speciﬁc amino acid differences
for each protein without re—calculating differences. This program is available
for download at http://code.glycocode.com/SNP-serverl.

2.3 Construction of the web interface

A web interface was constructed to Visualize the amino acid substitutions
derived from each A. thaliana accession for an individual protein. The
utility uses the Arabidopsis gene identiﬁer (AGI), a unique gene and protein
identiﬁer for Arabidopsis, as the principal input. The web interface was
constructed using previously development tools and requires a web browser
(Joshi et al., 2011). Pre-computed protein sets in FASTA format for each
accession are available from the Data Center at the 1001 Proteomes portal
(http://1001proteomes.masc-proteomics.orgl).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Expected amino acid substitution per accession

To demonstrate the utility of the 1001 Proteomes portal
and the potential impact of non-synonymous single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (nsSNPs) on protein function, we initially
determined the number of accessions that would result in a complete
amino acid substitution of an A. thaliana protein. An analysis of
the average nsSNP rate per protein for the publicly available re-
sequenced A. thaliana accessions was undertaken (Supplementary
Table Sl). On average, there are 1.9 (o = 6.8) nsSNPs per protein
per accession, when compared with protein sequences from the
reference accession Col-0. Initially, we made the assumption that
nsSNPs occur randomly throughout a protein and that with enough
accessions, nsSNPs would occur at every amino acid. We initially
calculated the probability of total coverage after taking into account
the effect of an increasing number of re—sequenced A. thaliana
accessions (Fig. 1B). The probability that all amino acids are
substituted on a protein 11 amino acids long, having seen t accessions,
given a probability that any one amino acid is substituted of p is
calculated by the following formula.

i=1

Given the probability of any random amino acid being substituted
(p) (580 000 unique substitutions on ~13 million amino acids) and
a median protein length (n) of 340 amino acids (Swarbreck et al.,
2008), we could be 99.5 % certain of total amino acid substitution
with sequence data from over 2370 A. thaliana accessions (Fig. 1B).

3.2 Experimentally determined amino acid
substitutions in accessions

The analysis of the expected nsSNPs that could occur in A. thaliana
proteins indicates that data from over 2370 accessions would be
necessary to conﬁdently deﬁne important residues and regions
within a protein. To assess whether these theoretical substitution
rates were matched in the experimental datasets, nsSNPs occurring
in each of the randomly selected accessions were collated. To
compare the experimental rates of substitution, we calculated the
actual average rate of substitution for all proteins (essentially the
probability that any selected amino acid has been substituted) under
the effect of an increasing number of accessions. To achieve this,
substitutions observed in previous accessions were discarded, such
that the average number of unique substitutions per protein for any
accession could be established (Fig. 1A). The distribution of actual
rates of substitution is closer to a log distribution, and is clearly
different to the theoretical rates of substitution. These data support
the notion that nsSNPs do not occur randomly on amino acids
throughout proteins of A. thaliana and their distribution within a
protein is constrained.

3.3 Post-translation modiﬁcations in A. thaliana
accessions

Post-translational modiﬁcations are important functional
components of a protein and are likely to be conserved across
A. thaliana accessions. Consequently if the underlying modiﬁed
amino acid is crucial to the function of a protein, it will likely
be substituted at a lower rate. Protein phosphorylation represents
one of the most common post-translational modiﬁcations and
generally occurs to a very speciﬁc subset of amino acids, namely
Ser, Thr and Tyr. Recent large-scale phosphoproteomic studies in
A. thaliana (Col-0) have resulted in large publicly available datasets
(Nakagami et al., 2010). In order to examine the importance
of modiﬁed residues we analyzed the effect of nsSNPs upon
experimentally determined phosphorylation sites. The RIPP—DB
database (https://database.riken.jp) contains ~5300 experimentally
determined phosphorylation sites in A. thaliana derived from the
reference accession Col-0 and was used to assess the conservation
of phosphorylation sites among accessions. A comparison of the
conservation rate among accessions of the ca. 5300 experimentally
determined phosphorylation sites from RIPP-DB and random sets of
amino acids comprising Ser, Thr and Tyr (total 6478) indicated that
experimentally determined phosphorylation sites were signiﬁcantly
more conserved (p = 0.03). Statistical signiﬁcance was calculated
by creating a contingency table, and using Pearson’s chi-squared
test.

In order to test whether the number of random theoretical amino
acids selected per accession affected the result or not, varying
multipliers of selected amino acids were tested. Placing these data
into a contingency table, and using Pearson’s chi-squared test, the
data was not signiﬁcantly different (p = 0.97). To control for any
effects from promiscuous substitutions on proteins across many
accessions, the distribution of nsSNPs found in single to close to a
hundred accessions were compared with respect to the distribution of
nsSNPs substituting phosphorylated sites, and were identical (p = 1,
using chi-squared test), suggesting that there is no relation between
the post-translational modiﬁcation state of an amino acid, and the
number of accessions a particular nsSNP is observed in. Thus,

amino acid substitutions in proteins of A. thaliana are constrained

3.4 1001 Proteomes web interface

The principal focus of the 1001 Genomes project is the analysis
of genomic sequence variation among the A. thaliana natural
strains collection. In order to make this information useful for
functional proteomics studies, we have created a web interface
for which facilitates the Visualization of protein variation, 1001
Proteomes. A simple and intuitive interface was created where a
user inputs an AGI and retrieves data for the corresponding protein
(http://1001proteomes.masc-proteomics.org). A consolidated amino
acid substitution track comprising nsSNPs is shown under the
sequence of the reference A. thaliana protein from the accession
Col-0. The size of the nsSNP on the consolidated track is scaled
depending on the number of accessions that contribute to a
speciﬁc substitution. The speciﬁc amino acid substitution and
each accession that contributes to the consolidated track can be
Visualized by toggling a switch on the consolidated track. Thus all
nsSNP information for each accession for a given protein can be
observed and assessed thorough a simple Visual medium. Finally,
pre-computed accession speciﬁc proteome sets are available for
download to enable these data to be used in proteomic studies.

4 DISCUSSION

The 1001 Genomes program involving the sequencing of A. thaliana
natural strains has the capacity to signiﬁcantly enhance our ability to
identify subtleties in gene regulation. To allow proteomic researchers
to more readily interface with this information, we have created
a portal called 1001 Proteomes to distribute translated protein
information and to provide interface to readily browse data at the
protein level. As an illustrative example of the utility of such a
resource to understand protein function, we demonstrated that these

data can be employed to examine features such as conservation of
protein modiﬁcations such as phosphorylation in the model plant
A. thaliana. Experimentally determined phosphorylation sites from
large-scale phosphoproteomics studies of the reference A. thaliana
strain Col-0, were signiﬁcantly less likely to be substituted by
nsSNPs in accessions.

Our initial analyses indicated that several thousand accessions
would be required to obtain adequate or complete amino acid
substitutions based on coding region changes in natural strains
of A. thaliana. In reality, substitutions in the coding regions of
these proteins is heavily constrained and likely controlled by
conservation of functional attributes within a protein. Although the
actual amino acid substitution space across A. thaliana accessions
is constrained, it was still possible to use these data to validate
the conservation of phosphorylation sites in protein sequences.
It is likely that this information can also be used to tease apart
important and redundant residues within functional domains of
proteins. The utility of this portal for functional proteomics can be
further highlighted when examining ambiguities in phosphorylation
site assignments from large-scale phosphoproteomics. Variable
phosphorylation assignments are common when multiple S, T
or Y residues are present in an identiﬁed phosphopeptide. An
examination of variably assigned phosphorylation sites on a handful
of phosphopeptides revealed that it was possible to readily determine
the likely phosphorylated residue (Table 1). These results further
demonstrate the value in Visually presenting nsSNP data to the
research community as they can address simple but diverse questions
on protein structure and function.

Recently a similar analysis of phosphorylation site conservation
across natural strains of A. thaliana concluded that there was
no association between experimental sites and nsSNPs (Riano-
Pachon et al., 2010). This contrary ﬁnding was likely due to the
non-uniformity of the SNP datasets which comprised data from
re-sequencing arrays of 20 accession (Clark et al., 2007), short

fragment sequencing of 96 accessions (Nordborg et al., 2005) and
early versions of next generation re-sequencing data for only two
accessions (Ossowski et al., 2008). Overall this dataset likely lacked
the resolution to obtain adequate coverage of SNPs and speciﬁcally
nsSNPs from A. thaliana accessions. Furthermore recent work
examining nsSNPs associated with phosphorylation sites in humans
(phosSNPs) argued that phenotypic effects may be attributable to
nsSNP substitutions of phosphorylated residues (Ren et al., 2010).
These observations further reinforce the likely conservation of
nsSNPs that alter protein function and effect phenotype.

The development of the 1001 Proteomes portal (http://1001
proteomes.masc-proteomics.org) provides a simple means to
analyze the role of amino acids on protein attributes such as post-
translational modiﬁcations. We have now developed an automated
pipeline that efﬁciently converts the processed re-sequencing data
from the Arabidopsis 1001 Genomes project into Visual tracks at
1001 Proteomes. New data will be made available both in the
browser and as downloadable proteins sets for functional proteomics
studies as they are made publicly available to the community.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Prediction of protein residue contacts, even at the coarse-
grain level, can help in finding solutions to the protein structure pre-
diction problem. Unlike oc-helices that are locally stabilized, B-sheets
result from pain/vise hydrogen bonding of two or more disjoint regions
of the protein backbone. The problem of predicting contacts among
B-strands in proteins has been addressed by several supervised com-
putational approaches. Recently, prediction of residue contacts based
on correlated mutations has been greatly improved and finally allows
the prediction of 3D structures of the proteins.

Results: In this article, we describe BCov, which is the first unsuper-
vised method to predict the B-sheet topology starting from the protein
sequence and its secondary structure. BCov takes advantage of
the sparse inverse covariance estimation to define B-strand partner
scores. Then an optimization based on integer programming is carried
out to predict the B-sheet connectivity. When tested on the prediction
of B-strand pairing, BCov scores with average values of Matthews
Correlation Coefficient (M00) and F1 equal to 0.56 and 0.61, respect-
ively, on a non-redundant dataset of 916 protein chains known with
atomic resolution. Our approach well compares with the state-of—the—
art methods trained so far for this specific task.

1 INTRODUCTION

B-Sheets are widespread motifs of local structure found in over
80% of the protein structures presently available in the Protein
Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do). B-Sheets
are generated by the pairing of two or more B-strands held to-
gether by characteristic patterns of hydrogen bonds running in a
parallel or antiparallel fashion (Zhang and Kim, 2000).
Prediction of the B-sheet topology from the covalent structure
of the protein is useful for predicting its tertiary structure, for
designing new proteins and for understanding folding pathways.
The ﬁrst method to predict B-strand pairing was based on a

statistical potential approach (Hubbard, 1994). Prediction of
B-residue contacts was addressed by Baldi et al. (2000) using
an elaborate method based on neural networks. Steward and
Thornton (2002) adopted an information theoretic approach to
predict B-residue pairwise interaction. Cheng and Baldi (2005)
pioneered the idea of predicting B-sheet topologies when the pro-
tein secondary structure is known and set the standard for this
type of task. Their method BetaPro is based on a 2D-recursive
neural network (Baldi and Pollastri, 2003) trained to predict
pairing probabilities of interstrand B-residue pairs. Then an
algorithm ﬁnds alignments between all pairs of B-strands, and
a weighted-graph matching algorithm predicts the B-sheet topol-
ogies. Lippi and F rasconi (2009) introduced an alternative ap-
proach based on Markov logic networks (MLNs). This approach
exploits B-sheet structural constraints deﬁned as logical formulas
whose weights can be learned from examples (Lippi and
Frasconi, 2009). The prediction of B-residue contacts was also
applied to the problem of predicting the 3D structure of proteins
using integer linear optimization (Rajgaria et al., 2010). Aydin
et al. (2011) combined BetaPro outputs with a Bayesian ap-
proach and tested it on subsets of the Cheng and Baldi bench-
mark set (Aydin et al., 2011). Recently, a new method to predict
protein B-sheet contacts using a maximum entropy-based corre-
lated mutation measure (CMM) has been introduced and com-
pared with the state-of-the-art methods (Burkoff et al., 2013).
CMM achieves performances similar to BetaPro and MLNs
(Burkoff et al., 2013).

In recent years, the main breakthroughs in residue contact
prediction have concerned improvements in the exploitation of
information from multiple sequence alignments (MSA). The
degree of coevolution of pair of sites in the MSA can be used
to infer the closeness of the corresponding residues in the 3D
structure. Different approaches have been described to elucidate
the coevolution of columns in an MSA, including standard cor-
related mutations analysis (Olmea and Valencia, 1997) and in-
formation theoretic measures (Dunn et al., 2008). Recently some
powerful methods based on the extraction of direct coupling in-
formation from MSAs have been introduced to predict protein
contacts both in globular (Cocco et al, 2013; Ekeberg et al. 2013;
Jones et al., 2012; Marks et al., 2011; Morcos et al., 2001; Weigt
et al. 2009) and membrane proteins (Hopf et al., 2012; Nugent
and Jones 2012). These new contact prediction methods are not
only improved with respect the previous approaches but also
ﬁnally allow to predict 3D structures of the proteins (for
review see de Juan et al., 2013; Marks et al., 2012; Taylor
et al., 2013).

In this article, we describe BCov, a new approach for B-sheet
topology prediction based on sparse inverse covariance estima-
tion and integer programming. BCov is the ﬁrst unsupervised
method that addresses this task. We use the residue-contact pro-
pensities provided by the Protein Sparse Inverse COVariance
(PSICOW method (Jones et al., 2012) to compute the scores of
the B-strand pairings. We selected PSICOV because it is freely
available and does not require proprietary software to run. Then
we apply an integer programming optimization to assign the B-
sheet topology. BCov well compares with the performances of
the state-of-the-art algorithms (BetaPro, CMMs and MLNs)
that integrate supervised techniques to address the same task.

2 METHODS

2.1 The BetaSheet916 dataset

The BetaSheet916 dataset was ﬁrst introduced by Cheng and Baldi (2005)
to evaluate their BetaPro method for B-sheet prediction and then adopted
by other authors (Burkoff et al., 2013; Lippi and Frasconi, 2009). The set
is routinely adopted as benchmark set for B-sheet prediction methods and
for sake of comparison we also use it in this article. The atomic coord-
inates of 916 protein chains (with X-ray diffraction at a resolution 52.5
A) were extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as to May, 2004
(Cheng and Baldi, 2005). Secondary structure assignments were com-
puted by means of the Deﬁne Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP)
program (Kabsch and Sander, 1983). Both extended B-strands (marked
by E in the DSSP output) and isolated B-bridges (B in the DSSP output)
were considered B-residues. The B-contact maps were deﬁned using in-
formation about B-partnership available from the DSSP output. Statistics
of the dataset are shown in Table 1.

2.2 The BetaSheet1452 dataset

To complement the BetaSheet916 dataset, we constructed a new dataset
of more recently deposited high-resolution proteins. We extracted from
the PDB a set of protein chains whose structures were obtained by X-ray
diffraction with a resolutions 2.5 A. We restricted our search to PDB
entries deposited after May, 2004 to exclude chains already present in the
BetaSheet916 dataset. We ﬁltered out protein sequences at 20% of se-
quence identity level to obtain a non-redundant dataset. More import-
antly, we also removed sequences with identity >20% with any of the
proteins contained in the BetaSheet916 set. We used DSSP to assign
secondary structures, and we ﬁltered out sequences having <3 distinct
extended B-strands to exclude trivial cases. We also discharged protein
chains shorter than 50 residues or having backbone interruptions or non-
standard amino acids. The ﬁnal dataset of proteins, referred to as
BetaSheet1452, contained 1452 protein chains. Statistics are shown in
Table 1.

2.3 CASP 2010 dataset

For sake of comparison, we also considered protein chains from the
Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) 2010 experi-
ment. The original set comprised 116 targets. We used the same proced-
ure described in Burkoff et al. (2013) to ﬁlter out sequences with a
number of B-residues 5 10. The ﬁnal set consisted of 92 protein chains.
Secondary structures have been assigned using DSSP.

2.4 MSA construction

For each sequence in the datasets described earlier in the text, we ob-
tained an MSA using the jackhmmer program that is part of HMMER
3.0 package (http://hmmer.org). Given a target protein sequence,

homologous sequences were found by running three iterations of jackhm—
mer against the UNIREF90 database (Magrane and the Uniprot
Consortium, 2011) setting the E—value threshold to 16-3. The correspond-
ing MSA has been obtained from jackhmmer output.

2.5 BCov general description

BCov consists of three main steps: (i) compute the residue contact pro-
pensity with PSICOV; (ii) compute the score of each possible B-strand
pairing; (iii) compute the B-sheet topology using an integer programming
optimization to ﬁnd the best solution according to the B-pairing
scores and constraints. Below we report the details of these three major
steps.

2.6 Computing the residue contact propensity with
PSICOV

For sake of clarity, in this section we provide a brief description of the
PSICOV method. We refer to Jones et al. (2012) for further details about
the method.

Starting from an MSA with m columns, PSICOV ﬁrst computes a
sample 21 m-by-21 m (also gaps are considered) covariance matrix C
using observed single and pair amino acid occurrence frequencies:

CZ’jb =fi, 1(a, 19) _fi(a)fj(b) (1)

where flu-(ab), f/a) and fj( b ) are the sample relative frequency of
amino acid pair ab at sites  the relative frequency of amino
acid a at column 1 and the frequency of amino acid b at column j,
respectively.

The inverse of the sample covariance matrix is computed with the
graphical lasso method (Banerjee et al., 2008; Friedman et al., 2008).
This algorithm allows estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix 6)
by minimizing the following objective function:

d d
2 Cij®ij — logdet® + p Z  (2)

where C is a d—by-d covariance matrix, 6) is the inverse covariance matrix
and the last term is a regularization term (the Zl-norm of the inverse
matrix) that governs the sparsity of the solutions. p is the sparsity
hyper-parameter: the greater is p the sparser is the solution.

The sparse inverse covariance matrix 6) is used, in turn, to derive a
contact score between residues at positions 1 and j by computing the

Kl-norm of the 20-by-20 sub-matrix of 6) corresponding to all possible
pairs of amino acid at position i and j:

The raw contact score computed as in Equation 3 is ﬁnally corrected as
follows:

(3)

 

B,,_3_,,

Bp-ZBiJ— B

.-,, (4)
where Biris the mean raw contact score between the i-th position
and all other positions (analogously B_,j for the j-th position) and
B is the overall mean contact score. This correction, referred to as
average product correction, allows reducing both entropic and
phylogenetic biases that are major source of noise in MSAs (Dunn
et al., 2008).

For each possible pairs of residues belonging to two different B-sheets,
we then adopt the score computed in Equation 4 as a measure of the
B-residue contact strength.

2.7 B-contact and B-sheet topology prediction

BCov consists of an integrated approach to predict both B-residue
contacts and B-sheet topology i.e. the speciﬁcation of the B-strand pair-
ings, including the directions of interactions (parallel, antiparallel or
isolated B-bridge). The method takes advantage of B-contact scores as
computed by PSICOV and integer programming for B-sheet topology
prediction.

Consider a protein sequence with n distinct B-strands and m
B-residues. As mentioned earlier in the text, PSICOV is used to
compute contact scores between all residue pairs in the protein se-
quence (even for non-B residues). Then we extract the submatrix
obtained by considering only B-residue pairs. After this step, we
end up with an m-by—m symmetric matrix B whose Bij components
can be interpreted as a propensity value for B-residues i and j to form
a B-contact.

Our algorithm proceeds by computing an n-by-n matrix S whose
entries represent interaction scores between pairs of strands. The matrix
S is deﬁned as follows:

scoreparallel(siasj)  i<j
511': 0 if i=J' (5)
scoreanti—parallel(siaSj)  i>j

where, for strands s,- and sj with i < j, Si]- contains the best alignment
score between the two strands in the parallel direction, whereas Sﬁ
stores the best alignment score in the antiparallel direction. Here,
without loss of generality, we use the upper diagonal part of S for
parallel scores and the lower diagonal part for antiparallel scores. To
compute alignments, we use B-contact propensities Bij obtained from
PSICOV as local residue match scores. We restrict the search space
for optimal alignments by considering only solutions that can be ob-
tained by sliding one strand along the other without gaps and with at
most one unmatched residue at the shortest segment ends. With these
constraints, for two strands of length r and t, respectively, assuming
r>t, there are 2x(r—t+3) possible alignments (see Fig. 1 for an
example).

Strand interaction scores stored in the matrix S are then used to assign
the B-sheet topology. Because a na'r'f approach that enumerates all pos-
sible B -sheet pairings is infeasible because of the combinatorial nature of
the problem (Zhang and Kim, 2000), several alternative solutions were
adopted such as graph matching or maximum Spanning-tree algorithms
(Cheng and Baldi, 2005).

In this article, we tackle this problem using integer programming. In
particular, the optimal B-strand pairing pattern can be obtained by
solving the following integer program:

maximize: i: Sinij

subjectto: bjlziOSXij-gl Vi=1,...,n,j=1,...,n
c2:05X,-J-+Xj,-51 Vi=1,...,n,j=1,...,n
c3215iXy+iing2 Vi=1,...,n
c4:X,-,-;:(1) Vi=k:1,...,n

The solution X is an n-by-n integer matrix that maximizes the overall
B-sheet sum of scores. The matrix X is binary (c1 constraints) and its
non-zero entries identify interacting B-strands. c2 constraints ensure the
consistency of the solution by enforcing the assignment of either parallel
or antiparallel pairing direction for each strand pair (i, j). Furthermore, a
given B-strand can pair with at most two distinct B-strands (c3 and c4
constraints). Figure 2 shows an example of the overall procedure for a
protein with ﬁve B-strands. We also evaluate a version of BCov that takes
into consideration the geometric constraint of generating parallel B-sheets
at short sequence separation. In protein structures, the formation of par-
allel B-sheets with few interleaving residues between two strands is difﬁ-
cult and it requires a strong unfavorable free energy contribution. For
instance, in the Cheng and Baldi (2005) dataset almost all pairing

B-strands separated by <6 residues are antiparallel. For this reason, we
introduce a modiﬁed version of our algorithm, referred to as BCov6,
which always assigns antiparallel directions to pairs of B-strands whose
sequence separation is <6 residues.

2.8 Method implementation

BCov has been developed in the C programming language (available at
http://biocomp.unibo.it/savojard/bcov/bcov—1.0.tar.gz). The source code
is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)
version 3. BCov is linked with the PSICOV source code (available at
http://bioinfadmin.cs.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/PSICOV/ and also released
under GPL terms) and the graphical lasso FORTRAN package for
sparse inverse covariance estimation (Friedman et al., 2008). For integer
linear optimization program, we used the C application program interface
of the GNU Linear Programming Kit (http://www.gnu.org/software/

g1pk/).

2.9 Measures of performance

We evaluated the performance of the method at both B-residue contact
level (i.e. contact maps) and B-strand pairing level (coarse contact maps).
In either case, we computed the canonical scoring measures, which
include:

0 Precision:

TP

P: —TP+FPX 100 (6)
0 Recall:

R = %V x 100 (7)
o Fl-score:

0 Matthews Correlation Coefﬁcient:

(TP x TN— FP x FP)

MCC =
\/(TP + FP) x (TP + FN) x (TN + FP) x (TN + FN)

 

 

(9)

where T P, TN, FP and FN are, respectively, true positives, true negatives,
false positives and false negatives. We also evaluate the methods using
qualitative measures introduced by Lippi end Frasconi (2009). In
particular,

0 F1270, which measures the percentage of chains for which B-strands
are predicted with F1 2 70% on coarse map,

0 F1 on parallel strands,

0 F1 on antiparallel strands,

0 Correct directions: percentage of correct pairing directions over cor-
rectly predicted strand pairs,

0 CBCC: percentage of correct B-sheet connected components.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 PSICOV performance on B-residue contacts

PSICOV has been described as one of the most promising meth-
ods to address the prediction of residue contact in proteins (Jones
et al., 2012). The accuracy of PSICOV depends on both the
number and the quality of the aligned sequences (Jones et al.,
2012). In the case of BetaSheet916 dataset, the number of se-
quences in each MSA ranged between 2 and 190576 (see Fig. 3).
Here, we address a slightly different goal, namely we want to
evaluate the predictions on the subsets of the contact map iden-
tiﬁed by the B-strand regions. In Table 2, we report the PSICOV
accuracy on the whole BetaSheet916 dataset and also on two
disjoint subsets: a subset of proteins whose number of aligned
sequences are 21000 and the subset of proteins whose number of
aligned sequences are <1000. Results listed in Table 2 indicate
that a low number of aligned sequences can affect the accuracy.
The performances of PSICOV on this task are lower than those
obtained by the state-of-the-art methods (see Table 3, rows 1—4).
However, it must be noticed that PSICOV is an unsupervised
method (differently from the others) and that here we evaluate it
only on the portion of B-residue contacts.

3.2 BCov performance on B-residue contacts

As described in Section 2, BCov optimizes the PSICOV outputs
using integer programming approaches. BCov assigns the
B-sheet topology and also all segment pairings including
B-sheet directions. For each pair of B-strand partners the best
score obtained by the segment pairing (see Section 2.4) can be
used to assign B-residue contacts. With this procedure, the per-
formances are signiﬁcantly higher than those obtained using
PSICOV alone (compare Table 2 with Table 3). When the pre-
dicted B-sheet contacts are used to reconstruct the corresponding
3D structures with FT—COMAR Wassura et al., 2008), the im-
provement of BCov over PSICOV leads to a better reconstruc-
tion of the protein fold (see Supplementary Fig. S1 of the
Supplementary Materials).

In Table 3, we report the performances of BCov and BCov6
with respect to the state-of-the-art methods on the BetaSheet916
dataset. It is evident that when we do not allow parallel pairing
of B-strand segments whose sequence separation is <6 residues

the indices see Section 3.2.

(a simple geometric constraint) the accuracy increases, as high-
lighted by the two percentage points of the correlation coefﬁcient
(MCC). BCov and BCov6 performances compare well with
the single supervised methods (CMM, BetaPro, MLN) and
are slightly worse than the combination of two methods
(MLN-2S).

3.3 BCov performance at strand level

The evaluation of the methods at strand level (detecting the cor-
rect B-sheet topology and B-strand pairings) is the most relevant
benchmark, as this is the main goal of all the approaches de-
veloped so far (BetaPro, NLN, CMM). In Table 4, we report the
comparison of BCov with the state-of-the-art methods on the
BetaSheet916 dataset. It is worth noticing that in this task
BCov (which is not trained on the dataset) compares well with
the other methods achieving a correlation coefﬁcient value of
0.56 (MCC). This indicates that the information extracted by
PSICOV is relevant also for the problem at hand, and if
coupled with an optimization procedure the overall accuracy
can improve signiﬁcantly. Furthermore, it is evident that

Bcov< 1000 48.9 45.2 47.0 0.39

 

Note: For the legend see Table 3.

when the number of aligned sequences is sufﬁciently high
(Bcov2 1000) the performances increases by 5 percentage
points and with an MCC of 7 percentage points higher than
the best state-of-the-art method. As a consequence, we may
expect that BCov performance will improve as new sequences
will be made available by mass sequencing efforts.

In Table 5, we show scoring of the different methods obtained
with the qualitative measures introduced by Lippi and F rasconi
(2009) (see Section 2.6). It is interesting to see that BCov outper-
forms all other methods with respect to all the reported indices
with the exception of the prediction of the correct directions of
the correctly predicted B-sheets. This indicates that with respect
to the other methods, BCov is better at guessing the segment
pairings and B-sheet topology but less effective at detecting the
contacts at residue level.

3.4 Performance on the CASP 2010 dataset

To evaluate the BCov performances at the strand level on an-
other benchmark, we used the CASP 2010 dataset. With this
choice we can also compare the BCov performance at the
strand level with other two state-of-the-art predictors (BetaPro
and CMM). We downloaded the protein structures provided
during the CASP 2010 experiment, and we followed the same
procedure described in Burkoff et al. (2013) to ﬁlter out se-
quences with a number of B-residues 5 10. The ﬁnal set consisted
of 92 protein chains. The results reported in Table 6 are really
encouraging, as it appears that BCov6 (an unsupervised method)
compares well with the state-of-the-art methods BetaPro and
CMM [as reported from the data taken from the supplementary
material of Burkoff et al. (2013)]. It is also worth noticing that
BCov6 MCC and F1 performances are almost unaffected by
the dataset change (compare Table 6 with indexes reported in
Tables 4 and 5).

3.5 Performance on the new BetaSheet1452 dataset

To evaluate the BCov performance on a larger and newer data-
set, in Table 7 we report the performances both at residue and at
strand level. It is encouraging that the performances are consist-
ent and comparable with those obtained using the classical
BetaSheet916 dataset (compare with Tables 3—5) and also the
CASP 2010 dataset (compare with Table 6). Because
BetaSheet1452 is larger than the previous dataset (far larger
than any CASP datasets, at least so far), the fact that the

performances do not degrade indicates that BCov is a robust
predictor of B-sheet topologies. In Table 7 we also report the
performance of the most recently introduced CMM method
(Burkoff et al., 2013) that was trained on the BetaSheet916 data-
set. It is worth noticing that BCov6 performs similarly at residue
level, but generally better at strand level indicating that BCov
more efﬁcient than CMM at locating the B-sheet segment pairing
(see MCC and F1 measure in Table 7).

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we presented BCov, a new unsupervised method
which integrates correlated mutation analysis and integer pro-
gramming for B-sheet topology prediction. BCov well compares
with the performances of the state-of-the-art methods, such as
BetaPro, CMMs and MLNs. The main advantage of BCov is in
the identiﬁcation of the B-strand pairing and the prediction of
the B-sheet topology. This is also conﬁrmed when BCov is com-
pared with the most recently introduced method to address this
task (MCC by Burkoff et al., 2013) on the new BetaSheet1452
dataset (Table 7). It is also worth noticing that BCov might be
coupled or incorporated into more complex machine-learning
frameworks such as recurrent neural networks or MLNs, as all
the information used by BCov (or its components) is obtained at
the sequence level without training. Finally, all the experiments
carried out in this article showed once more the strength of the
correlated mutation analysis for residue contact prediction, espe-
cially when this is performed using a sparse inverse covariance
approach as the one implemented by PSICOV (Jones et al. 2012)
or related approaches (Cocco et al., 2013; Ekeberg et al. 2013;
Marks et al., 2011, 2012; Morcos et al., 2001; Weigt et al. 2009).

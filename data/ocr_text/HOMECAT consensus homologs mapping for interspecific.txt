ABSTRACT

Motivation: Comparative studies are encouraged by the fast increase
of data availability from the latest high-throughput techniques, in par-
ticular from functional genomic studies. Yet, the size of datasets, the
challenge of complete orthologs findings and not last, the variety of
identification formats, make information integration challenging. With
HOMECAT, we aim to facilitate cross-species relationship identifica-
tion and data mapping, by combining orthology predictions from
several publicly available sources, a convenient interface for high-
throughput data download and automatic identifier conversion into a
Cytoscape plug-in, that provides both an integration with a large set of
bioinformatics tools, as well as a user-friendly interface.

1 INTRODUCTION

The interpretation of large data sets, in particular when obtained
from experiments using model systems, greatly beneﬁts from the
transfer of knowledge pertaining to phylogenetically related spe-
cies. The studies on widely used model organisms, such as mouse,
ﬂy or rat, yielded a large wealth of information, essential for the
understanding of life complexity (Aitman et al., 2011; Loman
et al., 2012; Schuster, 2008). The integration of functional
genomic and proteomic expression proﬁles in the modeling of
regulatory networks is a valuable approach in biology (Romero
et al., 2012).

HOMECAT (homology mapper for enrichment and compara-
tive analysis with translation) is a plug-in for Cytoscape
(Shannon et al., 2003) that allows cross-species data comparison
and integration of high-throughput data with automatic identi-
ﬁer conversion. Orthology relationships can be difﬁcult to iden-
tify, and several approaches exhibit different sensitivity and
speciﬁcity (Altenhoff and Dessimoz, 2009; Chen et al., 2007;

Hulsen et al., 2006). HOMECAT, at present, can combine
data from four homology data sources, to attain better speciﬁcity
and increased sensitivity. BridgeDB (Van Iersel et al., 2010)
usage allows to support 30 species and nearly 100 identiﬁers
formats (71 from microarrays platforms). HOMECAT also
interfaces Array Express ATLAS (Kapushesky et al., 2012) to
download and integrate high-throughput curated data.

2 COMPARATIVE ANALYSES AND INTEGRATION
WITH HIGH-TROUGHPUT DATA

In HOMECAT, input species identiﬁers can be chosen between
nodes attributes and are then converted to query the available
homology data sources for the identiﬁcation of orthologs in one
or more destination species. Finally, the identiﬁers of the ortho-
logs are converted to the selected output format. By default
Homologene ONheeler et al., 2007), OMA (Roth et al., 2008),
Compara Wilella et al., 2009) and OrthoMCL (Li et al., 2003)
are supported; the former two are more speciﬁc and the other
two are more sensitive (Altenhoff and Dessimoz, 2009). OMA
and Compara servers are queried directly, whereas Homologene
(rel. 67) and OrthoMCL (ver. 5) data are accessed through our
server in CBMC. When possible, a direct access to the data was
used, to always guarantee the most updated results. All necessary
conversions are performed by default through a remote
BridgeDB server. BridgeDB database can be installed on any
machine supporting Java (see BridgeDB website), and can be
used by HOMECAT to reduce conversion times, particularly
when hundreds of identiﬁers are processed. After the search
phase, the user can decide whether to use only the orthologs
conﬁrmed by all the sources or those indicated by any of
them, hence, increasing the reliability or the coverage of the
results. Orthologs can be used to enrich the input network, to
assign their identiﬁers to speciﬁc attributes or to create a novel
network of metanodes, preserving original network connectivity.

Each metanode will contain an input species node, along with
its orthologs, and can be expanded or collapsed. In the networks
of metanodes, the color of the border of each node always rep-
resents the input species data, whereas the internal color of the
node is always related to the ortholog data. A pie chart summar-
izes the orthologs data representation on collapsed metanodes
(see Fig. 1A for details). When more than one network are

Fig. 1. (A) HOMECAT search tab interface and a created network window. Left metanode is expanded with ortholo gs connected to the input gene. The
right metanode represents the same metanode collapsed. Border color always refers to input organism data, whereas node colors are always referred to
data for the organisms where orthologs were identiﬁed. Data in this ﬁgure are from zebraﬁsh and mouse optic nerve crush experiments; see the example
in the Supplementary Materials for details on data sources. Red for high, green for low and cyan for no values. Input nodes in expanded metanodes are
always cyan in the center, as no other species data can be mapped to them. (B) HOMECAT workﬂow: user searches orthologs and uses results to enrich
the input network or create a new network of metanodes. Dashed steps are optional and allow mapping and getting data. Atlas data can be acquired for

any Cytoscape network

created, node selections can be extended between networks,
facilitating comparisons.

For each ortholog, an attribute summarizes the sources that
support its identiﬁcation. This attribute is useful to adjust the
sensitivity attained by combining the results from different
orthology sources. The user can ﬁlter less strongly supported
orthologs and eventually remove them from the network.

External data can be loaded to the resulting network, either
from a local ﬁle or from ATLAS, by selecting the experiment
code and an experimental factor. When data from different
orthologs are present, the average is added as an attribute to
each metanode. A general scheme of this workﬁow is depicted
in Figure 1B.

As an example, HOMECAT was used to compare microarray
data after optic nerve crush in three publicly available datasets
from zebraﬁsh, mouse and rat samples. The optic nerve crush is a
common model to study the regeneration in the central nervous
system. After crush, the optic nerve regenerates in zebraﬁsh,
whereas the axonal recovery is absent in mammals. The
results highlighted differently regulated genes in ﬁsh and mam-
mals, consistent with literature, and showed how the combin-
ation of functional genomic and regulatory data analysis can
contribute to the identiﬁcation of putative key factors in
comparative biological studies (see the manual in the
Supplementary Materials).

3 FEATURES AND EXTENSIBILITY

Orthologs resulting from HOMECAT multiple queries can
be saved and loaded in ‘.hcd’ ﬁles. Data mapped to attributes
can be saved along with Cytoscape networks. A programming
interface allows the development of Java classes called
components, to combine additional homology data sources

that are automatically loaded on HOMECAT launch
(Supplementary Materials).

1 BACKGROUND

The detection of epistasis between different loci helps to provide
in-depth understanding of complex diseases. Many methods have
been proposed to ﬁnd epistasis in genome-wide association
studies (GWAS). A recent article (Wang et al., 2011) published
in Bioinformatics conducted an empirical comparison on ﬁve
methods [TEAM, BOOST, SNPHarvester, SNPRuler, and Screen
and Clean (SC)] in terms of power, type-1 error rate, scalability and
completeness. This work will help users to better understand the pros
and cons of each method. However, the lack of epistasis deﬁnitions
may bring some confusions for users to select the appropriate method
for their tasks because the tests of epistasis in these methods belong
to two different categories, while the comparison is based on the
same experimental setting. In this letter, we like to clarify the
difference of two epistasis tests.

2 EPISTASIS
2.1 Deﬁnition

The concept of epistasis (Bateson and Mendel, 1909) was introduced
around 100 years ago. It is generally deﬁned as interactions
among different genes. Recently, Phillips (2008) summarized three
categories of epistasis with respect to the essential role of gene—gene
interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems.

0 Functional epistasis is a functional description that addresses
the molecular interactions.

0 Compositional epistasis (Bateson and Mendel, 1909) is referred
as the blocking of one allelic effect by another allele at a
different locus.

0 Statistical epistasis (Fisher, 1918) is deﬁned as the statistical
deviation from the additive effects of two loci on the phenotype.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.
lThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two authors
should be regarded as joint First authors.

The deﬁnition of the statistical epistasis provides a quantitative
way to measure how the phenotypic effect of one locus depends on
the genotype at another locus (Phillips, 2008). This facilitates the
mathematical analysis of epistasis.

2.2 Tests of statistical epistasis

Given a pair of SNPs, there are two major tests of epistasis in the
literature. One is referred to as the ‘two-locus interaction test’, the
other ‘two-locus association test allowing for interaction’ (Cordell,
2009). In the following, we provide the procedures of these two tests
in case—control studies based on logistic regression. Here we use Y
to denote the two-locus interaction disease status (Y=1 for cases
and Y :2 for controls).

2.2.] Two-locus interaction test Given two loci Xp and Xq, there
are three steps to test two-locus interaction:

0 Fit the logistic regression model with only main effects. The
corresponding model is called main effect model:

P(Y=1|Xp=i,Xq=j)
1 = .p .q. 1
OgP(Y=2|Xp=i,Xq=j) ﬁ0+5§ +5; ( )

 

0 Fit the logistic regression model with both main effect terms
and interaction terms. The corresponding model is named full
model:

1 = _p _q “1’ q. 2
0gP(Y=2|Xp=i,Xq=j) ’30”? +5; +5: ()

 

Please note that the superscript Xp of p in both equations
is merely a label and does not represent the exponent. The

P

term  represents the coefﬁcient of Xp at category 1'. This

representation extends to q and ,6?qu as well. Here i=0, 1,2
and j = 0, 1,2 represent the three genotypes of loci Xp and Xq,
respectively.

0 Let [AM and 2.]: denote the log-likelihoods of the main effect
model and the full model, respectively. Conduct the X2 test on
2(LF —LM) with the degrees of freedom df :4.

This procedure completely matches the deﬁnition of statistical
epistasis from Fisher (1918). In practice, computing 2.]: of the
full model is very efﬁcient, but computing f4: of the main effect
model involves Newton iterations (Wan et al., 2010a). Since a
typical GWAS contains hundreds of billions of SNP pairs, it is
computationally challenging to test two-locus interactions in GWAS.
As a result, many methods choose not to ﬁt the main effect model and

instead use a much simpler procedure to test two-locus associations
allowing for interactions.

2.2.2 Two-locus association test allowing for interaction Given
two loci Xp and Xq, there are also three steps to test two-locus
associations allowing for interactions:

0 Compute the maximum log-likelihoods [A45 of the null logistic
regression model,

P(Y=1) _

1 —_
0gP(Y=2)

ﬁo- (3)

0 Compute the maximum log-likelihoods 2.1: of the full logistic
regression model in Equation (2).

0 Conduct the x2 test on 2.1: —ig with df = 8.

The two-locus association test allowing for interaction is based on 8
degrees of freedom and measures the sum of individual effects and
interaction effect.

3 COMMENTS ON RESULTS

3.1 The experiment of testing ‘power’

Among the methods compared in Wang et al. (2011), BOOST (Wan
et al., 2010a) and the Screen and Clean method (Wu et al., 2010)
test two-locus interactions, whereas TEAM (Zhang et al., 2010),
SNPHarvester (Yang et al. , 2009) and SNPRuler (Wan et al. , 2010b)
measure two-locus associations allowing for interactions. In the
comparison, the authors observed that BOOST has a lower power
in the experiment using models with main effects. This observation
could be misleading as BOOST only measures the interaction effect.
In fact, the interaction effect does not play a dominant role in those
main effect models, which makes it more difﬁcult to detect two-locus
interactions than two-locus associations allowing for interactions.
It is worthy pointing out that Model 1 in Wang et al. (2011) is a
multiplicative model which is an additive model in the log scale.
Therefore, there is no interaction effect in this model. Besides, there
are some critical issues in the test of two-locus associations allowing
for interactions, which need to be carefully addressed.

0 The size of two locus associations allowing for interactions
could be very large. Suppose one SNP has a very strong main
effect and does not interact with any other SNPs. The test
statistic of this SNP with any other SNP in the test of two-
locus associations allowing for interactions can be signiﬁcant
due to its strong main effect. This leads to the high redundance.

0 In order to extract SNP pairs with signiﬁcant interaction effects
from two-locus associations allowing for interactions, the post-
processing is needed. Here single-locus effects should be
handled appropriately.

BEAM (Zhang and Liu, 2007) is a very successful method to
address these issues. BEAM classiﬁes SNP markers into three
categories: SNPs unassociated with the disease, SNPs associated
with the disease independently and SNPs jointly associated with

the disease (interaction). All three categories of SNPs are integrated
into a Bayesian model. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo method
is used to optimize the partition model. After that, the posterior
probability of each SNP belonging to which category can be
computed. The B-statistic and conditional B-statistic are developed
to test the signiﬁcance of associations allowing for interactions and
the signiﬁcance of interactions.

3.2 The experiment of testing ‘Completeness’

In the experiment of testing ‘Completeness’, the authors claimed
that BOOST made some wrong pruning. This claim can cause some
confusion. BOOST is a two-stage method. In the ﬁrst stage, BOOST
designs an upper bound for the likelihood ratio test statistic to screen
insigniﬁcant interactions. In the second stage, it uses the typical
procedure of likelihood ratio test to measure the signiﬁcance of
selected pairs. The validity of the upper bound has been theoretically
proven. BOOST checks every SNP pair against the upper bound in
stage one. Thus, it is impossible to miss any signiﬁcant interaction
in BOOST. A possible explanation for this phenomenon may be that
BOOST pruned SNP pairs based on the two-locus interaction test,
while the authors used some other criteria to make their conclusion.

3.3 The experiment of testing ‘Type-l error’

In the experiment for ‘Type-1 error’, the authors showed that the
type-1 error rate of BOOST is 0.065, which exceeds the nominal
error rate 0.05. As BOOST uses the standard likelihood ratio test
in stage two, the type-1 error rate of BOOST should agree with the
nominal level of the standard statistical test.

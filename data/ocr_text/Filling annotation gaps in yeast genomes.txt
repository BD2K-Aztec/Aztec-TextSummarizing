ABSTRACT

Motivations: De novo sequencing of genomes is followed by annota-
tion analyses aiming at identifying functional genomic features such as
genes, non-coding RNAs or regulatory sequences, taking advantage
of diverse datasets. These steps sometimes fail at detecting non-
coding functional sequences: for example, origins of replication,
centromeres and rDNA positions have proven difficult to annotate
with high confidence. Here, we demonstrate an unconventional appli-
cation of Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technique, which
typically aims at deciphering the average 3D organization of genomes,
by showing how functional information about the sequence can be
extracted solely from the chromosome contact map.

Results: Specifically, we describe a combined experimental and bio-
informatic procedure that determines the genomic positions of centro-
meres and ribosomal DNA clusters in yeasts, including species where
classical computational approaches fail. For instance, we determined
the centromere positions in Naumovozyma caste/Iii, where these co-
ordinates could not be obtained previously. Although computed
centromere positions were characterized by conserved synteny with
neighboring species, no consensus sequences could be found, sug-
gesting that centromeric binding proteins or mechanisms have signifi-
cantly diverged. We also used our approach to refine centromere
positions in Kuraishia capsulata and to identify rDNA positions in
Debaryomyces hansenii. Our study demonstrates how 3C data can
be used to complete the functional annotation of eukaryotic genomes.

1 INTRODUCTION

De nova sequencing of genomes is typically followed by analyses
aiming to identify functional genomic features such as genes,
non-coding RNAs or regulatory sequences. This important so-
called annotation step raises non-trivial questions, and led to the
development of complex bioinformatics approaches taking ad-
vantage of multiple datasets. For instance, transcriptome ana-
lysis is conveniently used to annotate expressed coding sequences
(Grabherr et al., 2011; Saha et al., 2002), and synteny conserva-
tion between related species can reveal or conﬁrm the presence of
regulatory elements (Gordon et al., 2011; Kellis et al., 2004).
Complementary to automated annotation through comparative
approaches, experimental approaches such as ChIP-seq or
MNase—seq have been conveniently used to map epigenetic
marks, replication origins or other functional elements of the
genome (Roy et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012).

However, such tools are sometimes unable to detect non-
coding functional sequences: for example, origins of replication,
centromeres and rDNA positions have sometimes proven difﬁ-
cult to annotate with a high degree of conﬁdence in genomes. A
compelling example is the failure of comparative genomics to
identify the centromeres of the hemiascomycetes species
Naumovozyma castellii through comparative genomics (Gordon
et al., 2011). As another example, the number of rDNA clusters
in the genome of Debaryomyces hansenii is not known precisely,
but only estimated to lie between one and three and not currently
annotated in the genomic sequence (Dujon et al., 2004; Jacques
et al., 2010).

Genomic chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays
measure the physical contact frequencies between DNA se-
quences (Dekker et al., 2002; Duan et al., 2010; Lieberman-
Aiden et al., 2009), providing important insights into both
genomic organization and topological changes of chromatin do-
mains that accompany cell differentiation or development. 3C
data are typically analyzed in light of epigenetic marks and
other genomic annotations. In an alternative application, 3D
contact can be interpreted as an indicator of co-linearity of
two DNA segments, and was recently used to improve the scaf-
folding of the human genome (Burton et al., 2013; Kaplan and

Dekker, 2013). Here, we use genome-wide 3C data to unveil
functional elements of eukaryotic genomes that escape compara-
tive genomic analysis. Speciﬁcally, we take advantage of nuclear
architecture features to precisely determine the positions of
centromeres in the yeast species N.castellii (Cliften et al., 2006).
We show that this bioinformatic approach discriminates ambigu-
ous results from bioinformatics analysis, such as in Kcapsulata.
Finally, it also allowed us to complete the annotation of rDNA
in the D.hcmsenii genome and conﬁrm its centromere annotation
(Lynch et al., 2010).

2 METHODS

Centromeres and rDNA clusters lead to characteristic architectural fea-
tures in the yeast nucleus. Taking advantage of these features, we de-
veloped a robust approach to characterize computationally centromere
and rDNA positions from 3C data.

Yeast centromeres are tethered near a pole of the nucleus via micro-
tubules attached to the microtubule organizing center (MTOC, or Spindle
Pole Body in yeast), leading to centromere clustering. In the budding
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this clustering causes distinct peaks of
interchromosomal contact frequencies in the raw genome-wide contact
matrix, reﬂecting the convergence of 32 chromosomal arms toward a
discrete region of the nucleus (Duan et al., 2010).

We developed an algorithm that automatically recognizes these speciﬁc
contact enrichments and estimates the genomic coordinates of centro-
meres. Centromeric positions are therefore determined based on their
core biological function, rather than by sequence motif recognition, as
is usually done. This approach can discriminate between multiple candi-
date positions obtained by sequence analysis.

Ribosomal DNA is organized as a cluster of repeats in the genome of
all eukaryotes sequenced so far. These rDNA repeats give rise to the
nucleolar compartment(s), which in S.cerevisiae, and other species, con-
sists in a single subnuclear volume located opposite the SPB. This organ-
ization, combined with the large size of the rDNA cluster, creates an
apparent intra—chromosomal barrier within the contact matrix of the
chromosome carrying the rDNA locus. The position of an rDNA cluster
in a genome is therefore easily identiﬁable, even in the absence of any
annotation or sequence in the reference sequence. We developed an al-
gorithm to identify the presence of rDNA clusters in these genomes.

The ﬂowchart in Figure 1 provides an overview of the experimental
and computational workﬂow, each of which will be described in a distinct
subsection below.

2.1 Generation of genome-wide chromosome contact
frequency matrixes

3C libraries of the yeast species S.cerevisiae (BY4741), N.castellii
(CBS4309), D.hansenii (CBS767) and Kcapsulata (CBSl993) were gener-
ated from log-phase cells growing in YPD medium and as previously
described (Dekker et al., 2002; Oza et al., 2009), but using a frequently
cutter enzyme (Dan) as in (Sexton et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, the cells were
cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, and resuspended in Dan restriction
buffer, which were subsequently processed into Illumina libraries. 3C
libraries were sheared, and resulting fragments with sizes between 400
and 800 bp were sequenced using 100 bp pair-end sequencing on an
Illumina HiSeq2000. The raw data from all 3C-seq experiments were
then processed as follows: ﬁrst, short reads were mapped on the genomes
of S.cerevisiae (GCF_000146045.1), N.castellii (GCF_000237345.1),
D.hansenii (GCF_000006445.1) and Kcapsulata (Morales et al., in revi-
sion) using bowtie 2 in local and very sensitive modes (Langrnead and
Salzberg, 2012). Only pairs of reads with a Mapping Quality above 30
were retained, and contact reads mapping on the same fragment were

discarded (Cournac et al., 2012). PCR duplicates were also removed.
All rejected reads (except PCR duplicates) were included in a pool of
‘leftover reads’. These ﬁltering steps generally remove 15—20% of the
initial set of raw reads. After alignment of individual reads on the refer-
ence genome, we built a 2D histogram, where the value of each 2D bin
(pixel) indicates how many reads fall into the corresponding pair of gen-
omic segments. The genomic partition deﬁning these segments was based
on the restriction enzyme cutting sites, rather than on constant genomic
intervals. For the S.cerevisiae, the Dan restriction enzyme leads to a
contact matrix M0 of size m0 X mg, with m0 = 35 914. At this resolution,
however, the contact matrix is very sparse, and hence noisy. The signal-
to—noise ratio can be improved at the expense of genomic resolution by
binning the reads into larger genomic intervals. We therefore considered
three additional matrixes, Mk (k=1,2,3) obtained by summing non-

overlapping blocks of 3k X 3k pixels. For S.cerevisiae, these matrixes have
genomic bins of R1: 1233:l: 1095 bp (mean:l:standard deviation of 3
restriction fragment [RF]), R2: 3696:l: 1919 bp (9 RF) and
R3211034:l:3455bp (27 RF), and size m1=9712, m2=3240 and
m3: 1086, respectively (Fig. 2A—C, respectively).

For small genomic bin sizes R, the limited signal-to-noise ratio of these
matrixes can complicate the identiﬁcation of contact frequency enrich-
ments. Computing a correlation matrix, as initially done in (Lieberman-
Aiden et al., 2009), allows to strongly increase the contrast of contact
patterns. We then computed a new matrix C from M, where C(i,j) is
deﬁned as the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of the rows 1' and j of M:

3 (Mo; I) — 217(0) (Mo; 1) — Hm)

C091) = m m
\/ (Mo; 2) — my) (Mo; 1) — Her

 

 

and
_ 1 m

[:1

is the average value of row i of matrix M. To remove the chromosome
length bias, the correlation was computed from the interchromosomal
parts of the matrix (Fig. 2D).

2.2 Rough pre-localization of centromeric regions
from cis contacts

In the correlation matrix C, the blocks corresponding to intrachromosomal
(cis) contacts within pericentromeric regions exhibit a characteristic ‘cross’-
shape pattern (see diagonal in Fig. 2D and E). This pattern can be explained
by the clustering of centromeres near the spindle pole body (SPB) and the
polymer brush-like organization of chromosomes in this region, whereby
the two chromosome arms are stretched out away from the SPB (Wong
et al., 2012). As a result, the centromere is sequestered away from other loci
along the chromosome, leading to a depletion of contacts along the yellow
dotted lines in Figure 2E, while loci on opposite arms located at similar
genomic distances from the centromeres tend to be in proximity, leading to
contact enrichments along the ‘anti-diagonal’ (pink dotted line in Fig. 2E).
We took advantage of this pattern for the automated identiﬁcation of
centromeres by deﬁning a ‘centromere score’ as:

1 2l—l .

J

where p is the number of rows of the submatrix and E ( x ) denotes the
largest integer 5 x. Thus, for each genomic bin 1, S(l) is the ratio of the
average correlation along the anti-diagonal passing through C( [,1 ) and
the average correlation along the row I of C. The ‘centromere score’ S ( l )
is expected to be largest for 1 near the actual position of the centromere
(Fig. 2E). For acrocentric chromosomes, the peak of S can differ signiﬁ-
cantly from the true centromere position. Therefore, for each chromo-
some k, we used the location of this maximum, [0 = argmax S(l), to
deﬁne a genomic interval

[iL(k); iR(k)] = [10 — 20kb; 10 + 20kb] (4)

three levels of genomic resolution: (A) R]: 1233 bp (3RF), (B)
Rg=3696bp (9 RF), (C) Rg=11034bp (27 RF). The 16 chromosomes
of S.cerevisiae are labeled from I to XVI. The strong diagonal is due to
intrachromosomal contacts. Note the peaks corresponding to contacts
between centromeres from different chromosomes. (D) Correlation
matrix for S.cerevisiae: each element of the matrix is the Pearson coefﬁ-
cient between the vectors i and j of the matrix of contacts (bin size of
3696 kb). (E) Zoom on the intra-chromosomal correlation map of
chromosome 4. The centromere score S(l) for each bin 1 is plotted
along the sub-matrix (scale bar: 100 kb). The peak of this distribution
deﬁnes the center of a 40 kb window w likely to contain the centromere

along the chromosome that we expect to contain the centromere. The size
of the interval is arbitrary and depends on the size of the chromosome: it
must be kept within the chromosome boundaries, and must be large
enough that the Gaussian ﬁt can be applied correctly (see below). For
S.cerevisiae, we used window sizes of 40 kb. A more accurate localization
of the centromere is performed in the next step, as described in the next
section.

2.3 Refined estimation of centromere position
from trans contacts

In principle, the position of a given centromere could be obtained using
only the cis contact submatrix for the corresponding chromosome, or

we plot the distribution of the centromere localizations obtained using

The diagram below represents the distribution of the 16 centromere pos-
itions as estimated from raw and normalized data (blue and red circles,
respectively). x-axis: distances along the chromosome, centered on the

alternatively using only the trans contact submatrix involving one
other chromosome. However, as contact matrixes are histograms ob-
tained from a limited number of reads, they are subject to Poisson
noise, which imposes a fundamental limit to the localization accuracy
(much as in single molecule localization, see e.g. Ober et al., 2004). For
improved localization accuracy, we therefore took advantage of the re-
dundancy provided by the NC,” — 1 distinct trans contact patterns avail-
able for each of the Nchr centromeres (NW: 16 for S.cerevisiae). This
approach was applied both on the raw contact matrix M and on the
normalized matrix N, obtained as described in (Cournac et al., 2012).
Brieﬂy, this normalization step aims to correct for experimental biases
affecting the transformation from ligation product counts into contact
frequencies (a different approach from the procedure described in (Yaffe
and Tanay, 2011). The procedure uses an iterative algorithm that enforces
all rows and columns to have unit sum, i.e. it ensures that 1 N(i, j) = 1
for allj = 1..m and  N(i,j) = 1 for all i = 1..m, where m is the size of
the matrix. For details, see (Cournac et al., 2012), or (Imakaev et al.,
2012) for a related approach. The normalization has the overall effect to
increase the contrast of the contact data, and to attenuate noise in the raw
data (Fig. 3A).

Speciﬁcally, for each chromosome, we carved out Nchr — 1 submatrixes
of size 40 X 40 kb corresponding to trans contacts and deﬁned by the

[k0 —  + 

intervals obtained above (if necessary, the size of this matrix was reduced
to that of the smallest interval, such that all submatrixes had the same
size). In computing the superposed matrix, we did not use the intrachro-
mosomal contact data because of the bias for acrocentric chromosomes
mentioned above. These submatrixes were then summed, yielding a single
‘superposed’ contact matrix Ak (for the centromere of chromosome k;
Fig. 3B):

Ak = Z M(iL(l)°--iR(l)siL(k)°--iR(k)) (5)

For normalized data, M is simply replaced by N (Fig. 3B). The next

step consists in projecting this summed contact matrix into a 1D proﬁle
no = 521/104)

As apparent from Figure 3B, normalization typically produces a less

noisy proﬁle, allowing more accurate identiﬁcation of the centromere-

related peak. Finally, to accurately estimate the centromere position,

we implemented a Gaussian ﬁtting procedure similar to that commonly
used for single molecule localization (Ober et al., 2004). Speciﬁcally, we
used an iterative algorithm that aims to minimize the mean squared
difference:

Ho, 12. ic, 0) = Zine) — Ge; 61,19,1'c,0)]2 (6)

between F and the Gaussian function:

 

. . (i — if
G(z; a, b, 16, o) = aexp — 202 + b (7)

where a, b, ic and o are the parameters to be ﬁtted, i.e. we seek:
(21,13,126) = arg min H(a, b, i,,a) (8)

Thus, the ﬁnal estimated position of the centromere for chromosome k
is given by 

Application of this procedure to our normalized S.cerevisiae contact
data and comparison with the genomic annotation revealed that the
centromeres could be localized with a mean absolute error of only
627 bp (1232 bp without normalization), demonstrating that this func-
tionally important locus can be accurately located from the contact
data alone (Fig. 3B).

2.4 Confidence intervals and effect of coverage
and normalization on localization accuracy

To provide a robust roadmap for future studies, we next quantiﬁed
centromere localization accuracy and how it is affected by coverage
(i.e. sequencing depth), binning and the normalization procedure.

We used a bootstrapping approach to estimate conﬁdence intervals of
the computed centromere localization and to examine the inﬂuence of
coverage. Speciﬁcally, we simulated many contact frequency matrixes
with an expected total number of reads either equal to, or smaller than
the experimentally obtained matrix M (which for S.cerevisiae totals
Nreadsﬂc=2l 457 086). To do this, we generated N1”: 500 contact
matrixes Mbsk, k=I..Nbs where Mbs,k(i,j) is a random integer value
drawn from a Poisson distribution of density Mi, j) = fM(i, j), where
f 5 1 indicates the coverage relative to the original matrix. Thus, the
expected total number of contacts in MWC is fNrwds. We then used
each of the random contact matrixes M1”);C to compute an independent
estimate of the centromere positions.

Centromere position conﬁdence interval. For f = I , the distribution of
these estimates provides a measure of the uncertainty with which the
centromere positions have been determined from the original contact
data. We compared the distribution of localization errors for the 16
centromeres of S.cerevisiae with the normal distribution of mean 0 and
variance given by the bootstrap samples. The two distributions cannot be
distinguished by a Kolmogorov—Smirnov test (P=O.12; Fig. 4A). This
suggests that the conﬁdence intervals determined by the bootstrap esti-
mates correctly reﬂect actual localization uncertainties.

Effect of coverage, normalization and binning. To examine the effect of
coverage (or sequencing depth), which determines the total number of
reads involved in contacts in the matrix, we applied the bootstrapping
method to a range of f smaller than 1 (i.e. to experimental matrixes where
contact events have been down-sampled), speciﬁcally: f = 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2,
0.1, 0.01, 0.001. For each value of f, we computed the centromere position
error from the Nbs samples (relative to the ground truth) and the mean
over the 16 centromeres and the Nbs samples. Figure 4B plots this mean
error as function of the mean number of reads in the bootstrapped sam-
ples (fNreadS). As expected, the localization accuracy generally improves
with coverage, provided that the contact data are binned at adequate
genomic resolution and that the qualities of the libraries are equivalent.
Also, normalization improves localization accuracy for high coverage
(Nreads>2.106), but gives much poorer results for low coverage, where

the raw data should be preferred and provide more consistent accuracy.
This result underlines the complexity of 3C contact data analyses and the
need to take into account sequencing depth, binning and bias correction.
However, it also shows that an ~1 M reads contact map is sufﬁcient to
identify with high accuracy centromeric positions. The graph provides a
tool to determine the likely optimal choice of binning and normalization
options for the Dan enzyme applied to a yeast genome. Using bins
smaller than ~3 kb does not signiﬁcantly affect localization accuracy of
normalized data (Fig. 4B).

2.5 Identiﬁcation of rDNA loci in chromosome contact
matrixes

We next proceed to show that contact matrixes can also allow the
characterization of ribosomal gene clusters. First, a contact matrix
of S.cerevisiae was generated where the bins containing the two
rDNA repeats of the reference genome were removed (chromosome
12 region comprised between 450 000 and 470 000 of the reference
genome was removed, encompassing the two rDNA units positioned
between coordinates 451575 and 468 931 and reﬂecting the 100—200
repeats of total rDNA). The pair-end reads were remapped on this
modiﬁed genome (including the mitochondrial DNA; bin
size: 10 kb). We then selected in the pool of “leftover reads” all the
pairs where one mate maps unambiguously on the genome (mapping
quality above 30), while the other mate does not eliminating reads
containing unknown bases (N). These unmapped sequences were
blasted on a sequence dataset containing yeast ribosomal sequences
retrieved from the NCBI server (parameters: blast2 -p blastn -e 2e-30)
to keep only highly signiﬁcant hits. The corresponding mates were
then mapped along the genome divided into bins (Fig. 5). The peak
in the distribution was clearly apparent on chromosome 12 (~10 000
hits compared with an average of 20 along the rest of the genome).
Zooming in the distribution along an unmodified genome (bin
size: 10 bp) clearly shows that the peaks lie within chromosome 12
region comprised between 450 000—490 000 bp, adjacent to the position
of the ribosomal gene cluster (Fig. 5B; note the 5S variants lying be-
tween 470 000 and 490 000 positions of the cluster per se do not allow
high quality mapping of the reads and appear also as a blank area
along the genome).

3.1 Discriminating true centromeres among computational
predictions in Kuraishia capsulata

Centromeres of yeast species have mainly been characterized so
far through computational analysis approaches aiming at iden-
tifying landmarks in the sequence likely to predict centromeres
positions with high conﬁdence level. A classical approach con-
sists in searching for the consensus sequences speciﬁc to most
Saccharomycetaceae species studied so far, and related to the
point centromeres of the well-studied yeast Saccharomyces cere-
visiae (Gordon et al., 2011; Souciet et al., 2009). These centro-
meres are very compact (125 bp) and present a consensus
sequence composed of three centromere DNA elements (CDEI,
II, III; Fitzgerald-Hayes et al., 1982). CDE I and III present a
strong consensus core region and ﬂank CDEII, which is charac-
terized by a strong AT-rich content but a high sequence

variability (>90%). Not all yeast species exhibit such distinguish-
able point centromeres, and an alternative analysis searching for
local composition-bias in low-GC content was recently described
(Lynch et al., 2010). Drop in GC content is likely to reﬂect a
drop in recombination frequency, and coincides with the pos-
itions of centromeres experimentally characterized in Yarrowia
lypolitica (Lynch et al., 2010), as well as putative centromeric
regions made of clusters of retrotransposon Tdh5 in
Debaryomyces hansenii, for instance.

The genome of the nitrate assimilating yeast Kcapsulata has
been recently sequenced and assembled into seven chromosomes

(Morales et al., in press). A search for CDEI and III consensus
sequences failed to identify putative centromeres. However, a
search for low-GC content regions as described in (Louis et al.,
2012; Lynch et al., 2010) led to the characterization of nine pu-
tative centromeric regions (with chromosome 4 containing three;
Morales et al., in press; Table 1). To confer an experimental
validation of these results, and see if we could discriminate be-
tween ambiguous sequences, we performed a genomic 3C experi-
ment on Kcapsulata and sequenced the resulting library. The
quality of the matrix was relatively poor despite an important
coverage (Nreadsxc: 16446 227; Fig. 6A), as seen by the

“flatness”, or lack of contrasts, of the matrix and as quantiﬁed
by the ratio between mitochondrial and genomic DNA inter-
actions (A.C. and R.K., personal communication). Despite the
apparent noise, each chromosome still exhibits a discrete region

presenting a strong enrichment in interactions with the corres-
ponding other chromosomal regions, similar to centromeric be-
havior in S.cerevisiae (pink arrowheads, Fig. 6B). We followed
the procedure described above and characterized for each of the
seven chromosomes cis—contact matrixes the genomic intervals w
containing centromeric regions. Given the low coverage in in-
formative reads of the matrix, we opted for a binning of
2191 kb (9 RF) and assessed from the analysis above that little,
if any, improvement would result from SCN normalization. We
proceeded to superpose the trans-submatrixes containing the
centromeric regions deﬁned from the cis—contacts (Fig. 6B). A
Gaussian ﬁt was applied as described, and the coordinates of
centromere positions along with the precision calculated
(Fig. 6B and Table 1). Quite remarkably, the regions identiﬁed
experimentally through this approach overlapped exactly with
those obtained after computational analysis for the six chromo-
somes exhibiting a single, unambiguous putative centromere pos-
ition (Table 1). In addition, the region identiﬁed on chromosome
four as the centromere overlapped with only one of the three
putative positions identiﬁed from the composition bias analysis,
allowing the annotation of this position as the true centromere.
This analysis indicates that careful handling of a contact matrix
can successfully back up computational annotation, experimen-
tally conﬁrming and disambiguating weak predictions.

3.2 Identiﬁcation of centromeres in Naumovozyma
castellii

We then turned to N.castellii, an organism in which centromeric
regions remained elusive to date, despite thorough and repeated
investigation using different computational approaches (Cliften
et al., 2006; Gordon et al., 2011). We built a genomic 3C library
of N.castellii CBS 4309 strain and generated the corresponding
contact matrix (Nchr = 10; Nreadswc = 3 265 947 contacts; Fig. 6C).
Following through the procedure described above, we character-
ized for each of the ten chromosomes cis—contact matrixes the
genomic intervals containing centromeric regions (Fig. 6D).
From the S.cerevisiae analysis, we estimated that the optimal
binning for a 3M reads raw contact matrix to 3696 kb bins
(9 RF) and that normalization through SCN was likely to im-
prove the results (Fig. 4B). Therefore, we generated this matrix
and proceeded to superpose the trans-submatrixes containing the
centromeric regions deﬁned from the cis—contacts. The Gaussian
ﬁt was applied as described, and the coordinates of centromere
positions along with the precision calculated (Table 1).
N.castellii, although positioned within a clade of species that
present the CDE consensus sequences characteristic of point
centromeres, is an intriguing exception in this regards. We
hypothesized that CDE sequences may have escaped from
former investigations because of important divergence of the
consensus sequence, and performed a computational analysis
focusing on the centromeric region identiﬁed through genomic
3C. First, the intergenic sequences of the coding DNA sequences
(CDS) found within these coordinates were recovered and sub-
mitted to the motif ﬁnder algorithm MEME (Bailey and Elkan,
1994) under the zoops (zero or one motif per sequence) or the
oops (only one motif per sequence) modes. No signiﬁcant motif
could be identiﬁed from these ﬁrst analyses. To guide the motif
ﬁnder program, intergenic sequences from N.castellii were

included into a set of 63 intergenic regions known to contain
centromeres from eight other yeast species from the Lachancea
clade. These regions were used as a validation of the CDE I and
III detection approach. MEME was then able to identify CDEI
and CDEIII consensus sequences (Fig. 6E) but all of these motifs
corresponded to centromere regions of Lachcmcea species,
whereas no CDEI and only a very weak CDEIII signal was
observed for N.castellii regions (and no signature of a CDEII
region was found upstream of CDEIII).

For an independent veriﬁcation, and to test whether the
centromeric regions of N.castellii have retained their ancestral
positions, we analyzed the synteny conservation of pericentro-
meric regions between N.castelii and two related species,
S .cerevisiae and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii. To do so, we deﬁned
synteny blocks between pericentromeric regions, encompassing
10 protein-coding genes in the two related species and the
genome of N.castellii. We then looked if the coordinates of the
conserved synteny blocks in the genome of N .castellii overlapped
the coordinates of the centromeric regions deﬁned from the con-
tact map (Fig. 6B; Drillon et al., 2014). Four out of 10 centro-
meres in N.castellii belonged to the ﬁrst category. Of the
remaining six, two additional centromeric regions in N.castellii
were found to lie right next to a synteny breakpoint with the
genome of either S.cerevisiae or Z.r0uxii, and therefore were
also compatible with ancestral centromeric locations. For the
four remaining centromeric regions, we found that multiple re-
arrangements having occurred in these regions have hidden the
evolutionary relatedness between these regions. In summary, at
least 6 of 10 centromeric regions in N.castellii correspond to
orthologous regions in other species that contain point centro-
meres. Therefore, the majority of the centromeres in N.castelii
have retained their ancestral positions since they diverged from
their last common ancestor with S.cerevisiae and Z.r0uxii. This
demonstrates that if all 10 consensus centromeric motifs have
evolved beyond recognition in N .castellii, centromeres positions
are conserved for at least six of them. It is likely that extending
this approach to more closely related species with recognizable
point centromeres will unveil more synteny links and increase
this number.

Interestingly, Gordon et al. (2009) had sought without success
for consensus centromere sequences at putative ancestral centro-
meric locations in N .castellii. Here, we show that the centromere
function remains nevertheless linked to these ancestral positions
for at least 6 of 10 chromosomes although CDE regions are not
identiﬁable within these regions. This suggests that the centro-
meric binding proteins and/or the mechanisms involved have
evolved signiﬁcantly in this lineage. Interestingly, and perhaps
not coincidently, RNA interference is also conserved in this
species.

3.3 Identiﬁcation of ribosomal DNA locus in
Debaryomyces hansenii

The genome of D.hcmsenii, a cryotolerant and osmotolerant mar-
ine yeast important in the agro-food industry, lacks annotation
of the ribosomal DNA locus and has centromeres predicted
through computational analysis (Lynch et al., 2010). We gener-
ated a genome-wide contact matrix of the seven chromosomes
(NreadS,Dh=7020 925 contacts, bins of 3.2kb corresponding to

9 RF; Fig. 6G). First, we conﬁrmed the position of the centro-
meres that were predicted through a genomic computational ap-
proach (Table 1). We then searched for ribosomal DNA locus
(see Section 2) and found a peak on chromosome G in the dis-
tribution of reads along the genome for which the other mate
corresponds to rDNA (Fig. 6H). By zooming in the distribution,
the position of the ribosomal DNA cluster of D.hcmsenii was
identiﬁed at 1354 000 bp (Fig. 6H). This region corresponds to
an intergenic region containing a pseudogene and a gap, accord-
ing to the published reference genome (Deha2G::1353661—
1356925, www.genolevure.org). This region was blasted on the
NCBI database, revealing two small (75 bp) regions matching
with ribosomal DNA at positions 1354446 and 1355 863. We
therefore inferred the position of a large, unique ribosomal DNA
cluster within this window on chromosome G, ruling out the
hypothesis regarding the existence of three intrachromosomal
clusters in this genome.

We then compared the chromosomal location of the rDNA
between the genomes of D.hcmsenii and two other genomes for
which rDNA location is known (Pichia stipitis and Yarrowia
lipolytica; Dujon et al., 2004; Jeffries et al., 2007) using
SynChro (Drillon et al., 2014). No synteny conservation could
be found between these three genomes. In addition, we checked if
any rDNA annotation could be retrieved from the genomes of 11
species belonging to the CTG clade at the locus corresponding to
D.hcmsenii rDNA using the CGOB database (Fitzpatrick et al.,
2010). No such information was present in the database. In con-
clusion, no indication of synteny conservation of the rDNA locus
between D.hcmsenii and other yeast species could be identiﬁed,
consistent with the hypothesis that rDNA is mobile in the
Candida clade (Proux-Wera et al., 2013).

Overall, we showed that genome-wide chromosome conform-
ation capture can be used to unveil important functional elem-
ents that sometimes escape standard genomic analyses. After
validating the procedure on the well-known yeast S.cerevisiae
genome, we successfully determined centromere positions in
Naumovozyma castellii, where these coordinates could not be
obtained previously. Although computed centromere positions
were characterized by conserved synteny with neighboring spe-
cies, no consensus sequences could be found, suggesting that
centromeric binding proteins or mechanisms have signiﬁcantly
diverged. We also applied our approach to choosing among mul-
tiple predicted centromere positions in Kcapsulata, and to iden-
tifying rDNA positions in D.hansenii. Thus, our study
demonstrates how 3C data can be used to complete the func-
tional annotation of eukaryotic genomes with a bioinformatic
approach. The sequencing depth necessary to reach this goal
does not have to be high (~3 M reads proved largely sufﬁcient
for N .castellii and S.cerevisiae). It is likely that our standardized
procedures will allow identifying other functional elements from
contact data matrixes in the genome of microorganisms, and
potentially in metazoans. Combined with the recent application
of 3C to genome assembly, this study conﬁrms the helpfulness of
tri-dimensional information to genomic analysis.

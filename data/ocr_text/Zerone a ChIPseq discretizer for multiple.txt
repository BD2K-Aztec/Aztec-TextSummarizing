Abstract

Motivation: Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high—throughput sequencing (ChIP—seq)
is the standard method to investigate chromatin protein composition. As the number of
community—available ChIP—seq profiles increases, it becomes more common to use data from
different sources, which makes joint analysis challenging. Issues such as lack of reproducibility,
heterogeneous quality and conflicts between replicates become evident when comparing datasets,
especially when they are produced by different laboratories.

Results: Here, we present Zerone, a ChIP—seq discretizer with built—in quality control. Zerone is pow—
ered by a Hidden Markov Model with zero—inflated negative multinomial emissions, which allows it
to merge several replicates into a single discretized profile. To identify low quality or irreproducible
data, we trained a Support Vector Machine and integrated it as part of the discretization process.
The result is a classifier reaching 95% accuracy in detecting low quality profiles. We also introduce
a graphical representation to compare discretization quality and we show that Zerone achieves out—
standing accuracy. Finally, on current hardware, Zerone discretizes a ChIP—seq experiment on
mammalian genomes in about 5 min using less than 700 MB of memory.

Availability and Implementation: Zerone is available as a command line tool and as an R package.
The C source code and R scripts can be downloaded from https://github.com/nanakiksc/zerone. The
information to reproduce the benchmark and the figures is stored in a public Docker image that
can be downloaded from https://hub.docker.com/r/nanakiksc/zeronel.

1 Introduction

 

One of the major challenges of biology is to understand how tran—
scription factors and chromatin proteins coordinate transcription,
replication and repair. In front of this colossal task, the community
invests massive research efforts into collecting protein—genome inter-
action data. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high
throughput sequencing (ChIP—seq) has become the standard method
to identify the targets of a transcription factor or a histone modifica—
tion in a cell population. However, ChIP is not fully understood and
artifacts are still discovered more than 10 years after its adoption as

a standard (Park et 61]., 2013; Teytelman et 61]., 2013). Besides, the
constant improvement of sequencing technologies makes analysis of
ChIP-seq profiles difficult to standardize. There is thus a need to
continuously develop and improve computational tools to analyze
ChIP—seq data.

One of the most common analyses performed on ChIP—seq pro-
files is to discretize the signal, i.e. identify the loci where the tran—
scription factor (or other feature) is present. This makes the signal
simpler to interpret, it removes part of the experimental noise, it
simplifies downstream analyses and it allows comparing or

combining profiles of different natures. This raises a challenge at the
computational level because discretization has to be carried out uni—
formly for signals that may be very different. For instance, lamins
bind in megabase—scale domains covering 40% of the genome
(Guelen et 61]., 2008), whereas transcription factors may bind as few
as 6 bp with a coverage below 1 %.

Large consortia such as ENCODE have brought to light severe
issues related to the quality of ChIP—seq data. Conﬂicts between rep—
licates are common, and sometimes laboratory effects are clearly de—
tectable in the data, even when experimentalists use the same
material and follow the same protocol (our unpublished observa—
tions). The most popular remedy is to use a metric called IDR
(Irreproducible Discovery Rate, Li et 61]., 2011), which allows weed—
ing out poorly reproducible signal. This approach is a significant
step forward, but the IDR is undefined when more than two repli-
cates are available. Besides, keeping only the reproducible ChIP-seq
peaks is not always the best option. If one of the replicates is misla—
belled, for instance, it is more appropriate to reject the dataset than
to keep the common peaks. In summary, how to integrate ChIP—seq
data from different sources and with variable qualities is still an
open problem.

Here, we propose an approach to discretize ChIP—seq data where
conﬂict resolution and quality control are integrated in a tool that
we called Zerone (Pronounced /zi'roun/ or /'zi:ron/, i.e. as inserting
‘ear’ in ‘zone’.). The key idea of Zerone is to combine an arbitrary
number of ChIP—seq replicates in a single discretized profile, where
conﬂicts are resolved by maximizing the likelihood of the underlying
statistical model. Following discretization, Zerone controls the qual—
ity of its output in order to detect potential anomalies, and when ap—
plicable rejects the output as a whole. Internally, the first step
implements a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with zero—inflated
negative multinomial (ZINM) emissions, and the second implements
a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained using ENCODE ChIP-seq
data. HMM—based discretization is agnostic about the shape of the
signal (broad domains or sharp peaks) and the ZINM distribution
captures the essential features of the read count distribution in
ChIP—seq data.

Zerone is designed for large volume pipelines aiming to combine
many ChIP-seq profiles with little human intervention. To this end,
it is compatible with the standard BED, SAWBAM and GEM for-
mats, it produces congruent window—based outputs, and it can pro—
cess hundreds of experiments per day on average hardware. We
benchmarked Zerone against MACS (Zhang et 61]., 2008),
BayesPeak (Spyrou et 61]., 2009) and JAMM (Ibrahim et 61]., 2015)
on the core task of discretizing ChIP—seq profiles of CTCF and
H3K3 6me3. Our results show that Zerone is competitive in terms of
speed and accuracy.

2 Methods

2.1 Model and parameter estimation

It is natural to model read counts per genomic window by an un—
bounded discrete distribution. The Poisson distribution is an obvi—
ous candidate, but it is a poor choice because the variance of read
counts is usually higher than the mean for ChIP—seq data. The reason
is that windows are nonhomogeneous, which increases the disper—
sion. More specifically, windows do not have the same copy num—
bers, they are not equally PCR—prone and they are not equally
mappable. The negative binomial (NB) distribution is thus a better
choice because it allows some variation between windows. However,
genomes are fraught with repeats, which creates an excess of windows

where reads cannot be mapped. Since such windows will always have
0 read count, a natural choice for this distribution is the zero—inﬂated
negative binomial (ZINB), i.e. the mixture of a negative binomial dis—
tribution and a distribution concentrated at 0 (Rashid et 61]., 2011).
Figure 1 shows that the ZINB distribution gives a better fit to ChIP—
seq data than Poisson and NB distributions.

The ZINB distribution has three parameters that can be fitted by
maximum likelihood. Zerone uses a custom solver based on the
Newton—Raphson method, which converges much faster than the
popular routine zeroinfl (Zeileis et 61]., 2008) from the R package
pscl (Jackman, 2015).

The NB distribution can be interpreted as a Gamma—Poisson
process, which gives a straightforward extension to a multivariate
distribution called the Negative Multinomial (NM) and to the zero—
inﬂated version of it called Zero—Inflated Negative Multinomial dis—
tribution (ZINM, see supplementary material for detail). In this
model, windows have an intrinsic ChIP—seq bias due to their se—
quence composition, mappability and other inherent properties,
which gives a baseline variation present in all ChIP-seq experiments
performed in the same cells and the same conditions. Note that the
biases are not modelled explicitly from local features of the genome
(e.g. G—l—C content), but implicitly by adjusting the variance of the
distribution. Also, the ZINM distribution models the statistical de—
pendence between replicates and thus yields more accurate probabil—
ities than assuming independence.

Given that the genome contains 11 windows, each observation
y,- : (32,71, . . . ,yijr) is a vector of r read counts (one per replicate),
where 1 g i g n. The associated probability under the ZINM dis—
tribution with parameter 0 : (it, or, [90, . . . , [9,) is

windows), or is a shape parameter dictating the distribution of reads
and p0, . . . , p, are probabilities linked by the equality [)0 —l— [)1 —l— - - -
+1), : 1 and dictating the average number of reads per window for
each replicate.

Discretization is performed by fitting an HMM with ZINM
emissions. The HMM has three states corresponding to ‘low’, ‘me—
dium’ and ‘high’ abundance of the given chromatin feature. In many
ChIP—seq profiles, the baseline signal shows piece—wise variations of
low amplitude but large size (typically 10—100kb). This will some-
times be the dominant signal and a two—state HMM will identify
these blocks instead of the targets. Dedicating two states to fit the
baseline is a way to make sure that the ‘high’ state corresponds to
the targets of the chromatin feature. In what follows, targets always
correspond to the ‘high’ state.

Assuming that x,- takes one of these three values, the log—
likelihood of a sequence of states (x1, . . . ,xn) given the observations

(y1,...,yn) is

log/(960) + 10gg(yo|xo) + Z lOgQ(xz—1,xz) + 10gg(yz|xz)-
i=1

In the above, V denotes the initial probabilities of the states, Q is
the 3 X 3 transition matrix of the model, and g(y,-|x,-) is the probabil—
ity of the emission y,- if the state is x,- (the parameter vector 0 depends
on the state of the HMM). Discretization amounts to finding the se—
quence of states and the model parameters that maximize the value
above. Zerone achieves this with the Baum—Welch algorithm (Baum
and Petrie, 1966), which is a special case of the EM algorithm
(Dempster et 61]., 1977). The emission parameters TE and or are state—
independent since they represent the baseline distribution of reads in
the genomic windows. For this reason they are fitted from the nega—
tive control profiles before the Baum—Welch cycles (as a side note,
fitting them with the Baum—Welch algorithm slows convergence and
sometimes leads to aberrant solutions). The other parameters are
state—dependent since they represent the amount of reads per win-
dow in each replicate, depending on the abundance of the chromatin
feature. Overall, the total number of estimated parameters is 3r —l— 9,
where r is the number of replicate experiments.

The fitting process resolves conflicts between replicates. Say that
a ChIP—seq peak is present in only one of them; the signal will be 10-
cally high only for this replicate and low for the others. Because of
the conflict, the local log—likelihood will be low for all the possible
states but there will still be an optimum that corresponds to the
‘least unlikely’ state. The final call depends on whether the weight of
evidence is higher for the presence of the peak or for its absence. If
the conflict is strong, the confidence in the final call will be weak,
which can lead to a rejection of the profile as a whole if such cases
are too frequent (see Section 2.3).

Transition parameters are updated through the forward—
backward algorithm (Rabiner, 1989), and emission parameters are
updated by solving maximum likelihood equations with the
Newton—Raphson method (see Supplementary Material for detail).
The state calls are computed by finding the most likely segmentation
given the value of the parameters through the Viterbi algorithm
(Viterbi, 1967).

2.2 ChIP—seq preprocessing

Mapped reads are binned in fixed—step windows (default 300 bp) by
their mid-point and PCR duplicates (i.e. reads mapping to the same
location in the same orientation) are removed. The window size
should not be smaller than the sonication fragment length and it
should be set so that there are on average more than 3—4 mapped

reads per window. Zerone decompresses on the ﬂy input files com—
pressed by gzip or bng (BAM format). There is no upper limit to the
number of input files to discretize simultaneously, but there must be
at least one negative control and one ChIP—seq experiment (at least
two for the quality control to be meaningful, see below).

2.3 Quality control

We used a machine learning strategy to identify discretization fail-
ures. The true status (success or failure) of experimental ChIP-seq
data is not known because success is partly subjective and because
there is no gold standard for protein binding in live cells. We pre—
pared an experimental dataset where we labelled the output of
Zerone as positive (success) or negative (failure) based on empirical
criteria (see associated Docker image for detail). The definition of
success is thus subjective, but the training is performed on represen-
tative data.

We discretized 96 replicated ChIP—seq experiments together with
their respective input control (see associated Docker image). Based
on visual inspection and on the available literature, we determined
that discretization was successful in 91 cases that consituted the
positive examples of our training set. The most common cases of
poor data quality in ChIP—seq correspond to low signal—to—noise
ratio (e.g. when the antibody is not specific), and lack of reproduci—
bility between replicates (e.g. when samples are swapped). We cre—
ated 91 negative cases obtained by discretizing controls without
immunoprecipitation, or nonreplicate profiles (e.g. by treating
CTCF and P012 profiles as replicates). Thus, a total of 182 cases (91
positive and 91 negative) were used to build a balanced dataset. We
extracted 5 features from the output of Zerone to train a classifier:
the transition matrix entry Q29 (indicating the size of the targets),
the minimum value of the ratios p2(2)/p2(1), . . . ,p,(2)/p,(1) (indi-
cating the signal to noise ratio), the amount of targets, the fraction
of variance explained by the discretization and the correlation be—
tween replicates.

To separate the points in the feature space (Fig. 2), we used a
Support Vector Machine (SVM, Chang and Lin, 2011; Meyer et 61].,
2014) with a radial basis function kernel, as they allow nonlinear
classification, are fast to train and require only two hyperparameters
to be fitted. We trained the SVM and selected the hyperparameters
that maximized the prediction performance on test sets using a 10—
fold cross—validation scheme. The average prediction accuracy on
these sets was 95 %. Unlike quality control methods based on indi—
vidual peaks (such as the IDR for instance) the quality control

implemented in Zerone is ‘all—or—none’, i.e. the profile is rejected or
accepted as a whole.

2.4 Benchmark datasets and conditions

To train the SVM, we used all the ChIP—seq fastq files produced by
the ENCODE Consortium on the human leukemia cell line K562.
Reference assembly UCSC hg19 was used throughout. The data was
downloaded from the repository http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/
goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC in November 2013. We mapped all
the raw reads on the human genome with GEM (gem—mapper ver—
sion 1.376 beta, gem—indexer version 1.423 beta, Marco—Sola et 61].,
2012), using the options—unique—mapping and —q ignore. We
converted the mapped files to SAM format with gem—2—sam version
1.423 beta.

To compare Zerone to other discretizers, we analyzed two differ—
ent ChIP—seq datasets: CCCTC—binding factor (CTCF) and tri-
methylated histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3). Each dataset con—
sists of a mock or input profile without immunoprecipitation and
two replicate ChIP—seq profiles. The ENCODE accession numbers
for these four datasets are ENCSR000DWE and ENCSR000DWD
respectively. Table 1 gives a global overview of the datasets used for
benchmarking.

We tested MACS callpeak version 2.1.0.20140616, BayesPeak
version 1.20.0 and JAMM version 1.0.7rev1. All tests were per—
formed on an 8—core Intel Xeon E5606 machine with 48 GB of
DDR3-RAM at 1333 MHz. All programs were run on a single core
with the recommended options. Specifically, on the H3K36me3
dataset, JAMM was run with the option —r region and MACS with
the —broad option. For the rest of the datasets and programs, the de—
fault options were used. When using IDR, we ran MACS with a
relaxed q—value cutoff set to 0.05 to obtain a higher number of
peaks. For JAMM, we took the top ranking 300 000 peaks as input
for IDR. The IDR analysis proper was conducted using the R script
batch—consistency—analysis.r, available at https://sites.google.com/
site/anshulkundaje/projects/idr. For MACS, peaks scoring lower
than 0.05 were kept. For JAMM, the top 71 peaks in the joint discret—
ization were kept, where n is the number of peaks scoring lower
than 0.05 in separate discretizations. For the CTCF benchmark, all
peaks were resized to 500 bp from the center of the window.

The CTCF motif was obtained from the JASPAR database ver—
sion 5.0_ALPHA (motif ID MA0139.1, Mathelier et 61]., 2014).
Subsequently we used FIMO (Grant et 61]., 2011) from the MEME
suite version 4.10.1 (Bailey et 61]., 2009) to identify and map CTCF
motif occurences in the human genome. The positions of
Transcription Start Sites (TSS) were extracted from the knownGene
table of the UCSC Genes annotation (Karolchik et 61]., 2004). RNA
counts in section 3.2.2 were obtained from the ENCODE dataset
EH000163 (already mapped bigWig files).

The quality control of Zerone was compared to a method based
on IDR to ﬂag replicates with low consistency or low quality
(described in https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/idr).

Numbers in parentheses are used to distinguish replicates.

Brieﬂy, this method uses the script batch—consistency—analysis.r to per—
form pairwise comparisons between all the replicates to check that
the number of reproducible peaks is similar between them. The same
comparisons are also performed between random splits of each repli—
cate, and between random splits of a pooled profile. Experiments that
do not satisfy minimal criteria are ﬂagged as faulty.

A full replay of the benchmark including all the necessary data—
sets and scripts is available from the associated Docker image.

3 Results

3.1 Automatic quality control

The most novel feature of Zerone is an embedded automatic quality
control step taking place after the discretization. It not only ensures
that the discretization is sensible, but also that the replicates are
similar to each other and that the ChIP—seq profiles are not too simi—
lar to the mock controls. Our approach is based on the idea that dis—
cretizations from overly noisy or divergent profiles should have a
signature that can be picked up by a specially trained classifier.

We identified five summary statistics that characterize the qual—
ity of the discretization and trained an SVM to recognize failures.
We thus obtained a classifier able to identify a failed discretization
with 95 % accuracy (see Section 2.3).

This feature is essential for high throughput automatic pipelines.
For instance, when discretizing ENCODE ChIP—seq profiles ob—
tained in human H1 ES cells, we noticed that the lysine—demethylase
JARID 1A did not pass the quality control. Further investigation im—
mediately revealed the nature of the issue. In one of the replicates,
the signal is lacking entirely, as if the immunoprecipitation failed
(Fig. 3). Once aware of the issue, users can handle it properly (for in-
stance, by discarding the protein or by working with a single repli-
cate). Without automatic quality control, the low quality of the first
replicate would have been missed.

Low quality profiles can also be detected using IDR. We ran ei—
ther Zerone or MACS followed by IDR—based ﬂagging on a test set
of 30 chromatin features from H1 ES cells. The agreement between

the two methods was 85% (see Section 2.4 and associated Docker
image). We excluded five cases where either MACS or IDR failed to
run. Among the 8 cases of disagreement, Zerone accepted three and
rejected five, suggesting that it is slightly more stringent than
MACS—l—IDR. It is important to note that the quality control of
Zerone is more general than IDR—based ﬂagging since it applies to
all types of signal without upper limit on the number of replicates.
In contrast, IDR is a tool for pairwise comparisons and it does not
apply to profiles with broad domains. Also note that IDR—based
ﬂagging in itself can represent a significant computational burden
when there are many replicates or many targets sites (Section 3.3
shows some examples of the computational cost of IDR).

3.2 Accuracy
The purpose of discretizers is to identify the targets of a transcrip—
tion factor or a histone mark, i.e. the sites of the genome where it is
present. Intuitively, good discretizers capture a large fraction of the
ChIP-seq signal within few targets. The number of targets and the
amount of reads they represent are therefore critical characteristics
of a discretization. Unfortunately, there is no gold standard to esti—
mate the trade—off between false positives and false negatives in
ChIP—seq experiments, and thus there is no objective way to rank
discretizers (Szalkowski and Schmid, 2011). However, we can com—
pare them with a partial order as follows: when arranging genomic
windows from high to low amount of ChIP—seq reads, the cumula—
tive number of reads forms a Pareto front. It represents the largest
amount of reads that can be captured by the given amount of targets
(Fig. 4). A discretization can be represented as a point of this plane.
By construction, no discretization can lie on the left of the Pareto
front, and those on the front represent an optimum. Others are sub—
optimal, since it is possible to capture more reads with the same
amount of targets (or the same amount of reads with less targets).
We benchmarked Zerone against three ChIP—seq discretizers. We
included MACS as the standard method for ChIP—seq peak calling,
BayesPeak because it is powered by an HMM with ZINB emissions
similar to the model implemented in Zerone, and JAMM because it

Fig. 4. Graphical representation of discretizations. Genomic windows of the
ChIP-seq profile are ordered by decreasing amount of reads on the X axis,
and the cumulative amount of reads is plotted on the yaxis. This line forms a
Pareto front representing the maximum number of reads for a given number
of windows. Discretizations are represented as a single point on this plane
(black disc) whose coordinates are the number of targets and the total num-
ber of reads covered by the targets. The dark triangle represents discret-
izations that are more conservative and discover more targets

can perform joint discretization of experimental replicates. We used
datasets of similar size that represent two major types of ChIP—seq
signal (Table 1). The CTCF signal consists of sharp peaks at the
transcription factor binding site and the H3K36me3 signal consists
of broad domains.

This representation reveals that discretizing the CTCF profile
yields similar outputs regardless of the software (Fig. 5, left panel).
On the other hand, discretizing the H3K36me3 profile yields very
distinct outputs. In all the cases, Zerone produces the discretization
capturing the most reads. For CTCF it lies on the Pareto front. For
H3K36me3, it lies somewhat off the Pareto front, but at a sensible
location. As detailed below, H3K36me3 is deposited on transcribed
genes (Kimura, 2013; Pokholok et 61]., 2005) so the coverage of tar—
gets should be higher than for transcription factors and for other
profiles with sharp peaks. Taken together, these results show that
Zerone produces discretizations that are sensitive and adapted to the
profile being discretized.

3.2.1 Identification of CTCF binding sites

CTCF binds a 20 bp consensus sequence that is highly conserved in
vertebrates. In humans, nearly 80% of the CTCF binding sites con—
tain the consensus motif (Kim et 61]., 2007). In order to determine
the capacity of the different tools to call peaks of CTCF binding, we
compared the discretized profiles against a reference dataset con—
taining the positions of 85 690 occurences of the CTCF motif (see
Section 2.4).

Table 2 shows that for most tools, the F1 score (the harmonic
mean of precision and recall) is between 0.34 and 0.41. The excep—
tion is JAMM, achieving significantly higher precision than the
other tools at the cost of recall. On this dataset, the performance of
Zerone is fair, with a good balance between precision and recall.

3.2.2 H3K36me3-enriched domains on active genes

There is no consensus sequence to determine the location of histone
modifications. However, it is known that the bodies of active genes
are enriched in H3K36me3 (Kimura, 2013; Pokholok et 61]., 2005).
Therefore, the genes that contain peaks or windows determined as
enriched in H3K36me3 by the different discretizers should be more
expressed than the background.

We benchmarked the quality of the discretization with expres—
sion data obtained in the same cell. We used the number of RNA
reads as a response variable and computed the amount of variance
explained by the discretized profile of H3K36me3. The dis—
cretization produced by Zerone is the best predictor of expression

the relative fraction of variance in RNA reads explained by the discretization
of H3K36me3. The value for MACS was set to 1.0 and all other values were
scaled accordingly. Right panel: Overlap between H3K36me3 targets (color
version of the figure available online). Each circle represents the H3K36me3
targets identified by a program. The size of the circles is proportional to the
coverage of the targets, and their overlap approximates the amount of targets
shared by the programs. Note that the discretizations made by BayesPeak
overlap almost completely and are indistinguishable in this representation.
Also note that JAMM is used ‘unthresholded', as IDR is not recommended for
broad signal

(Fig. 6, left panel). It is also the one with highest coverage (Fig. 5,
right panel), which shows that the increased number of targets does
not come at the cost of accuracy. On the contrary, the high coverage
of H3K3 6me3 is confirmed by expression data.

A Venn diagram gives a graphical overview of the relationships
between the discretizations (Fig. 6, right panel). Zerone finds most
of the targets detected by the other discretizers, while discovering
enriched windows not found by the others.

3.3 Speed and memory footprint

We compared the running times of the different programs on discre-
tizing the four datasets used above, containing 18—32 million reads
(Table 1). The results were similar between experiments. Zerone
was consistently the fastest tool, with a running time of around 5
min (Fig. 7, top row). The advantage is marginal over MACS, which
ran for around 10min, but it is substantial over JAMM and
BayesPeak which ran in hours or in days, respectively. Post—
processing the output with IDR did not significantly increase the

Fig. 7. Running times and peak memory footprint of the discretizers on the
four ChIP-seq datasets. For programs that only allow single-profile discret-
ization (i.e. BayesPeak and MACS), mean values (not the sum) are shown.
The bars in dark grey represent the total running time when IDR is also com-
puted (for JAMM and MACS). Note that the logarithmic scale misrepresents
the relative fraction of time spent on each task

running time of MACS, but it did so for JAMM, increasing the total
running time by a few hours (Fig. 7, dark grey bars). The results for
peak memory usage were variable between experiments (Fig. 7, bot—
tom row). MACS achieved the best performance with a memory
footprint around 0.5 GB, followed by Zerone around 0.7 GB.
BayesPeak and JAMM each used more than 1.5 GB. The memory
usage of Zerone does not depend on the sequence depth of the ex—
periment, but solely on the number of replicates and the total num—
ber of windows in the genome. As an example, for the human
genome at 300 bp resolution, the memory footprint of Zerone is ex-
pected to be around 500 MB —l— 40 MB per replicate.

The benchmark is partly confounded by the fact that Zerone dis—
cretizes multiple profiles simultaneously. This makes a difference for
pipelines where all files have to be processed in parallel with the min—
imum amount of resources. In this benchmark, Zerone processed
twice as many files per run as MACS. Per processed file, Zerone is
thus four times faster than MACS while using 30% less memory.

4 Discussion and conclusions

Zerone was developed ground up for scalibility and throughput. The
result is a tool with competitive performance (Fig. 7). Part of the speed
is due to hashing methods that dramatically cut down the computation
time during the Baum—Welch cycles. Zerone also rests on sound statis—
tical bases. Theoretical arguments and experimental observations sug—
gest that the Zero—Inﬂated Negative Multinomial distribution is
appropriate to model ChIP—seq data (Fig. 1). This gives Zerone good
specificity and sensitivity for very different profiles (Fig. 5).

Zerone also proposes an original solution to the problem of data
heterogeneity. Firstly, the statistical model is fitted in order to harmon-
ize the replicates and solve conﬂicts by maximum likelihood. Secondly,
automatic quality control is performed after the discretization. The
principle of this step is somewhat similar to anomaly detection. Note
that control profiles play a key role in the process. In order to evaluate
the quality of the discretization, Zerone implicitly assumes that the
user has provided controls that properly capture systematic biases such
as batch effects, mappability and copy number variations.

The quality control implemented in Zerone goes beyond the IDR
(Li et 61]., 2011) in several ways. Zerone measures the quality of the
discretization and not only the consistency between replicates. Also,
the quality control of Zerone is neither limited to a specific type of
profile (e.g. sharp peaks), nor to a preset number of replicates.
Finally, issuing an ‘all-or-none’ call about the discretization is better
practice than silently ignoring the regions that differ between experi—
ments (see e.g. Fig. 3).

Zerone: a ChIP-seq discretizer for multiple replicates with built-in quality control 7

 

Here, we also introduced a way to compare discretizers with an
intuitive graphical representation (Fig. 4). On this plane, the coord—
inates of a discretization indicate the number of targets (or occu—
pancy) and the amount of reads captured by these targets. The
Pareto front captures the inherent trade—off between sensitivity and
specificity in the problem of discretizing ChIP-seq profiles. Points on
this line that are close to the bottom—left corner represent discret—
izations with high amount of reads per target (most specific) and
points that are close to the top—right corner represent discretizations
with many targets (most sensitive). The Pareto front also highlights
an unachievable region whose shape depends on the structure of the
signal, i.e. on the feature being discretized (Fig. 4). One of the chal—
lenges of discretizing ChIP-seq profiles is to find algorithms that per—
form well in all the cases.

In practice, the specificity of a discretizer is unknown because
the biological truth remains hidden. However, we can decide
whether a discretizer is more or less conservative than another by
measuring the amount of reads per target. This characteristic may
be a matter of choice, and is usually tacit in the case of ChIP—seq dis—
cretizers. Out of two equally conservative discretizers, one may be
more sensitive, i.e. discover more targets. The merit of the represen—
tation introduced here is to highlight these characteristics and to
guide users when choosing the most appropriate tool for their need.
Note, however, that the number of reads per window is not the only
criterion for calling targets, so there are cases where a discretization
lying far from the front may be preferable to one lying closer to it.

This representation naturally suggests a naive approach to discret—
ize ChIP-seq profiles. Indeed, one could sort the genomic windows by
decreasing amount of ChIP—seq reads and call ‘target’ any window
above a chosen threshold. While this method would only produce dis—
cretizations on the Pareto front, adjusting the threshold to the condi—
tions would be challenging for lack of an underlying model. This is
one of the major strengths of Zerone: the statistical model automatic—
ally adjusts conservativity and sensitivity in a sensible way.

In summary, the good performance of Zerone on different
classes of profiles, combined with the automatic quality control
meet the needs for general and robust ChIP—seq tools.

Abstract

Motivation: Many important problems in cell biology require dense non-linear interactions
between functional modules to be considered. The importance of computer simulation in under-
standing cellular processes is now widely accepted, and a variety of simulation algorithms useful
for studying certain subsystems have been designed. Expansion of hematopoietic stem and pro-
genitor cells (HSC/HPC) in ex vivo culture with cytokines and small molecules is a method to
increase the restricted numbers of stem cells found in umbilical cord blood (CB), while also enhanc-
ing the content of early engrafting neutrophil and platelet precursors. The efficacy of the expanded
product depends on the composition of the cocktail of cytokines and small molecules used for
culture. Testing the influence of a cytokine or small molecule on the expansion of HSC/HPC is a la-
borious and expensive process. We therefore developed a computational model based on cellular
signaling interactions that predict the influence of a cytokine on the survival, duplication and differ-
entiation of the CD133+ HSC/HPC subset from human umbilical CB.

Results: We have used results from in vitro expansion cultures with different combinations of one
or more cytokines to develop an ordinary differential equation model that includes the effect of
cytokines on survival, duplication and differentiation of the CD133+ HSC/HPC. Comparing the
results of in vitro and in silico experiments, we show that the model can predict the effect of a cyto-
kine on the fold expansion and differentiation of CB CD133+ HSC/HPC after 8-day culture on a 3D
scaffold.

1 Introduction

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative
therapy for severe hematological malignancies and other severe dis-
orders of the blood and bone marrow. Umbilical cord blood (CB) is
used as an alternative for bone marrow or mobilized peripheral
blood grafts, particularly when no HLA matched related or unre-
lated donor can be found (Ballen et al., 2013; Fuchs et al., 2013;
Watt, 2014). However, single CB grafts have a limited number of
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSC/HPC) and, when
compared with mobilized peripheral blood grafts, show significantly
delayed early neutrophil and platelet engraftment (Ballen et al.,
2013; Fuchs et al., 2013; Watt, 2014). This leads to significant mor-
bidity and mortality in myeloablated recipients in the CB transplant
setting. Recent studies suggest that CB units contain 25—50-fold
fewer early engrafting neutrophil and platelet progenitor cells than
mobilized peripheral blood and that the frequency of these progeni-
tors in individual CB grafts is independently variable and correlates
with the clonogenic CFU-GM and CFU-Mk content, respectively
(Cheung et al., 2012). Indeed, CB grafts with a higher content of
CFU and viable CD34+ cells (>1.8 X 105 CD34+ cells transplanted
per kilogram of the recipient’s body weight) demonstrate improved
median time to and probability of neutrophil and platelet engraft-
ment (Avery et al., 2011; Lemarie et al., 2007; Migliaccio et al.,
2000; Page et al., 2011; Scaradavou et al., 2010; Wagner et al.,
2002). The latter, as well as longer term hematological reconstitu-
tion of CB CD133+CD34+ HSC/HPC post-transplant (Cheung
et al., 2013; Drake et al., 2011) can be measured in the peripheral
blood in surrogate NSG mouse models (Cheung et al., 2012; van der
Garde et al., 2014), although neutrophil recovery is over 10-fold
lower in peripheral blood than bone marrow in NSG recipients
(Cheung et al., 2012). However, longer term and serial transplant-
ation in NSG mice (Cheung et al., 2013; Drake et al., 2011) and es-
pecially transplantation into non-human primates more closely
resembles the human in vivo transplant setting (Kim et al., 2014;
Watts et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014). Recent studies have demon-
strated that ~half of the mobilized peripheral blood CD34+
HSC/HPC contribute to 3—10-year long-term and ~half to
short-term repopulation, while 4—10% of clones (or ~0.1% of
CD34+ cells) have durable lympho-myeloid reconstitution in non-
human primates (Kim et al., 2014). The limited number of HSCs in
a single CB unit often restricts these grafts to children and small
adults. Although double CB units can be transplanted into adults to
enhance stem cell content, this does not significantly improve early
neutrophil and platelet recovery post-transplant and only one
of the transplanted CB units generally engrafts long term
(Scaradavou et al., 2013).

The numbers of HSC/HPCs in a CB graft can be increased by
culturing human CB CD34+ or CD133+ HSC/HPC ex vivo in the
presence of cytokines and small molecules prior to transplantation.
Notably, the CD133+ fraction of human CB has been shown to con-
tain all repopulating cells, at least in surrogate models of hematopoi-
esis (Takahashi et al., 2014). Clinical trials have shown that ex vivo
CB HSC/HPC expansion can improve the outcome of CB trans-
plantation in terms of time to neutrophil engraftment (Danby and
Rocha, 2014; Delaney et al., 2013). However, experimentally, ex
vivo culture can also deplete, expand or maintain the long term en-
grafting HSCs in a CB graft (Fares et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2014). The
protocol for expanding CB cells should therefore not only focus on
the highest fold expansion of the early engrafting neutrophil and
platelet progenitor cells but also on maintaining and amplifying the
durable long term repopulating HSC.

The rationale behind the use of cytokines and small molecules to
expand such cells is based on knowledge of the cues that signal to
HSC/HPC cells from their microenvironmental niches in the bone
marrow (Mendelson and Frenette, 2014; Morrison and Scadden,
2014). The efficiency of the ex vivo expansion of HSC/HPC subsets
thus depends on the cytokine and small molecule combinations used
and can be further modulated with 3D scaffolds or by controlling
the supply of nutrients and depletion of inhibitory molecules in the
cultures (Csaszar et al., 2012, 2014; Pepperell and Watt, 2013). In
most clinical protocols, a minimum basic combination of stem cell
factor (SCF), thrombopoietin (TPO) and Flt3-ligand (Flt3L) is used
(Pepperell and Watt 2013; Piacibello et al., 1997). Addition of other
cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), hyper-IL-6, interleukin-3,
G-CSF, insulin growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2), Notch
ligands and Angiopoietin-like 5 (AngptlS) can improve the fold
expansion of the human CD34+ and/or CD133+ HSC/HPC
(Benveniste et al., 2014; Dahlberg et al., 2014; Pepperell and Watt,
2013; Rappold et al., 1999; Tarasova et al., 2011; Zhang et al.,
2008). More recently, with the ability to segregate human HSC/
HPC into phenotypically enriched cell subsets (Goergens et al.,
2013; Notta et al., 201 1) and to correlate this with their transplant-
ability into surrogate models, other factors [e.g. the aryl hydrocar-
bon receptor antagonist SR1, HDAC and apoptotic inhibitors,
pyrimidazoindole derivatives (histone demethylases), deGE2,
nicotinamide] have been added to basic cytokine cocktails (e.g. SCF,
TPO, Flt3L : other factors) to enhance the content of short or long
term repopulating HSC/HPC (Boitano et al., 2010; Chaurasia et al.,
2014; Fares et al., 2014; Fonseca-Pereira et al., 2014; Hagedorn
et al., 2014; Horwitz et al., 2014; Pepperell and Watt, 2013). For
clinical application, GMP-grade expansion of CD133+ or CD34+
HSC/HPC is required but is a costly procedure and addition of mul-
tiple cytokines increases the cost of an expanded product. Therefore,
it is vital to use a basic cytokine combination that provides the best
expansion without increasing the cost of the procedure while pre-
serving stemness characteristics.

In this study, we have analyzed the influence of different combin-
ations of the cytokines SCF, TPO, Flt3L, IGFBP-2, AngptlS, IL-6,
fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) and Oncostatin M (OSM) on the
fold expansion of human CB CD133+CD34+ cells, which contain
HSCs and their multipotent (MMP, LMPP, MLP and GMP) pro-
geny (Goergens et al., 2013). We present a computational approach
to elicit the effect of different cytokines, by modeling the signaling
cascades of the cytokines and thereby their effect on the prolifer-
ation, differentiation and survival of these cells in ex vivo culture.
We retrieved signaling pathways of the specified cytokines from spe-
cialized literature and by database mining. Then, we extracted in a
rational way all the prevalent effects of signals, merging them into
an integrated graph (see Supplementary Fig. 51) that we used to
model, by means of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the bio-
logical microenvironment. The model is intrinsically multiscale, i.e.
it takes into account events at the molecular level (biochemical sig-
naling pathways) and at the cellular level (differentiation, survival
and duplication of target CD34+CD133+ cells and the dynamics of
cytokines used in the cocktail). The model was tuned by reference to
in vitro experiments and then used as a virtual lab. The virtual lab
was then applied to search for cytokine cocktails that maximize the
duplication of and minimize the loss of CD34+ and CD133+ cells,
using a trial and error procedure. The best in silico protocol was
then confirmed by in vitro experiments. This study provides
evidence that in vitro data relating to the proliferation of human
HSC/HPC can be theoretically modeled with a computational
approach. In future applications, this model could be extended to

study whether other cytokines and/or small molecules can improve
the survival, proliferation and/or differentiation of defined
HSC/HPC subsets or other stem cells (e.g. mesenchymal stem cells)
that are used in cellular therapy or inhibit the proliferation of cancer
initiating or stem-like cells.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 CB collection and isolation of the CD133+ cells

Human CB units were collected with written informed pre-consent
and ethical approval from Oxford and Berkshire National Research
Ethical Committees and studies conducted with approval of the
NHSBT research committee. Mononuclear cells (MNC) were iso-
lated by density gradient centrifugation on lymphocyte separation
medium 1077 (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria; dens-
ity< 1.077 g/ml). CD133+ cells were isolated from the MNC with
immunomagnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany). After isolation, the cells were cryopreserved in 10%
DMSO in FCS and stored at — 150°C. Cells were analyzed for the
purity of the isolation with flow cytometry on a BD LSR II (BD
Biosciences, CA) using CD34-APC, CD133-PE and the appropriate
isotype controls (all Miltenyi Biotec). The raw data used for the ana-
lysis and the appropriate ﬂow cytometry data along with an appro-
priate MIFlowCyt description (Lee et al., 2008) are supplied in
Supplementary Table S4 and Document 2.

2.2 In vitro expansion of CD133+ cells

CD133+ cells were thawed and resuspended in serum-free Stemspan
SFEM medium (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). Cells
were allowed to recover from cryopreservation by incubating over-
night at 37°C with 5% C02 in 24-well tissue culture plates at
1 X 105 cells/well containing Stemspan SFEM and 100 ng/ml SCF,
100 ng/ml IL-6, 100 ng/ml Flt3L and 20 ng/ml TPO (all CGS,
Cambridge, UK). After overnight culture, the cells were harvested,
washed to remove all cytokines and resuspended in Stemspan
SFEM. Cells were then loaded into NANEX nanofiber plates
(Arteriocyte, MA) at 1 X 103 cells/ml (Pepperell and Watt 2013)
with a single cytokine or various combinations of the following
cytokines: SCF 100 ng/ml, IL-6 100 ng/ml, Flt3L 100 ng/ml, TPO
20 ng/ml, FGF-1 10 ng/ml (all CGS), OSM 50ng/ml, Angptl-5
100 ng/ml (both Miltenyi Biotec) and/or IGFBP-2 100 ng/ml
(Preprotech, London, UK) and incubated at 37°C in 5% C02 for 8
days. Cells were analyzed for viable CD34 and CD133 expression
by ﬂow cytometry (Pepperell and Watt, 2013). After 8 days of cul-
ture, the cells were harvested from the plates and the volume of the
cell suspension determined. The cells were again analyzed for the ex-
pression of CD34 and CD133 by flow cytometry, and the concentra-
tion of the cells was determined using countbright beads (Life
Technologies, Paisley, UK) to calculate the number of cells after ex-
pansion. The fold expansion of the total nucleated cells (TNCs) was
calculated by dividing the total number of cells harvested after ex-
pansion with the number of input cells. By multiplying the fold
TNC expansion by the percentage of CD133+CD34+ cells post-ex-
pansion and comparing this to the input cells, we calculated the fold
expansion of the CD133+CD34+ cells.

2.3 Computational modeling of the cytokine effects on
the CD133+ cell population

The first step in realizing any tractable model that is able to repre-
sent a biological problem is to analyze the problem itself, trying to

catch the most prominent features and leaving out secondary and
less important features.

There are several examples in literature that apply this important
approach (Camporeale et al., 2003; Castiglione et al., 2012;
Chiacchio et al., 2014; Germain et al., 2011; Pappalardo et al.,
2014a, b). In this study, many cocktails of combined cytokines are
used with the goal of maximizing CD133+ cell fold expansion by
culturing the CB cells ex vivo. It is therefore clear that, to model the
entire biological scenario, we need to take into account two
processes that happen on different scales: the population level,
which describes CD133+ cell behavior, including duplication and
differentiation, and the intracellular level, which takes into account
all the important biochemical pathways that are triggered by the use
of cytokines and determine the behavior of cells at the population
level. These two levels must be reproduced and connected to de-
scribe exhaustively the biological problem. The biochemical path-
ways are cell dependent, in the sense that two different cells may
internally follow different pathways, and this would entail as many
simulations at the intracellular level as the number of involved cells
at the population level. It is clear that different cocktails may lead to
very variable results on the basis of the biochemical pathways that
are triggered. Hence, for all the cytokines analyzed, the most im-
portant signal transduction pathways have been gathered from
literature.

An exhaustive model of a single biological pathway already en-
tails very complex models based on systems of tens to thousands of
ODEs or complex Petri Nets (the solution for which is in any case
usually carried out by ODE systems). Moreover, in many cases, it in-
cludes unknowns that cannot be measured experimentally
(Tarasova et al., 2011). The complexity grows if we consider that a
single cytokine usually triggers more than one pathway. Thus, it is
clear that the realization of a model which accurately describes,
combines and aggregates all the pathways involved with the use of a
cocktail of cytokines is not viable, at least initially. We instead tried
to catch and reassume the final effects of the pathways activated by
cytokines on the CD133+ cell population. To this end, we initially
identified and labeled all the pathways that involved the use of the
identified cytokines, clustering all similar pathways (with the same
effects) as one; at the same time, we determined from literature the
main effects of any pathway cluster by examining three possible
principal effects on the CD133+ cell population: survival, duplica-
tion and differentiation. Survival refers to the ability of a pathway
to stimulate all the processes that involve an increase of cell survival,
such as cytoskeleton reinforcement; duplication refers to the cap-
ability of stimulating cells to duplicate by maintaining CD133 posi-
tivity and differentiation considers all the pathways that stimulate
maturation of CD133+ cells into those cells where CD133
expression is lost and CD34 expression is retained and then
both CD133 and CD34 expression is subsequently lost (see
Supplementary Table S1).

These three effects represent the connection point between the
intracellular and population models. The intracellular model is used
to determine the survival, duplication and differentiation coeffi-
cients associated with the use of a given cocktail of cytokines. Such
coefficients are then used as parameters for the population model
and will inﬂuence survival, duplication and differentiation rates of
involved populations (see Supplementary Fig. S1). The weight of
every pathway cluster on one or more of the coefficients is estimated
on the basis of multiple in vivo experiments that have been carried
out with different cytokines cocktails.

For analysis at the population level, we started by taking
into account two populations: CD133+CD34+ cells and their

CD133—CD34+ or CD133—CD34_ differentiated progeny. The first
population takes into account all the cells that have not lost CD133
and CD34 expression, whereas the second one takes into account all
the cells that differentiated and thus lost CD133 expression. Both the
populations composed of two sub-populations, normal and activated.
Normal cells represent cells that interact with cytokines. Triggered or
activated cells can then survive, duplicate or differentiate in accord-
ance with the effects activated by cytokine-induced pathways. After
that, the cells revert to their normal or non-activated state and be-
come prone to interact again with cytokines that can stimulate further
activation. In Supplementary Figure S1, we show the complete con-
ceptual model for both intracellular and population models.

2.4 Formal description of the ODE model

The key aspect of the modeling approach we present is given by the
connection of two models at different levels, namely, an intracellular
model and a cellular population model. This connection is achieved
by using probabilities and/or rates that are estimated by the intracel-
lular-model and then cellular behavior is determined at a higher
level within the population model. Such an approach can in prin-
ciple be employed using any kind of modeling techniques suitable
for modeling at the intracellular and population levels. Choosing the
right modeling techniques is fundamental as it mainly depends on
the complexity of the biological problem we are dealing with. It
should be noted that the use of different modeling techniques re-
quires a technique that allows the communication between the two
models.

In building up our multi-scale model, we first analyzed how to
build the signaling pathway model. To this end, we used a two-step
‘qualitative—quantitative’ procedure: in the first step (‘qualitative’),
we established which cytokine-induced pathways are fundamental
for the effects being analyzed (duplication, differentiation and sur-
vival). We used the data from literature presented in Section 2.5 and
from public databases such as Pathway Commons network (http://
www.pathwaycommons.org) and KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of
genes and genomes). This first step allowed us to determine which
pathways needed to be taken into account and represented in the
model. We then developed a conceptual scheme (see Supplementary
Fig. S1) that not only summarizes all the information we gathered
from literature and databases for creating the pathway model, but it
also includes the cellular conceptual model and the connection
points between the two levels (the duplication, differentiation and
survival rates). We used ODEs for both the models because the
model at population level was not so complex. This allowed us to
use only one modeling technique and the same software for both the
models, avoiding the need to find a more complex way for the two
models to communicate. In particular, we used Berkeley Madonna
for the simulation of the ODE system. To run the model, one has to
download the latest version of Berkeley Madonna (http://www.ber-
keleymadonna.com/jmadonna/jmadrelease.html) and then down-
load the source code of the model as indicated in the availability
section (http ://www.francescopappalardo.net/Bioinformatics_CD 1 3 3_
Model).

In the second step (‘quantitative’), we determined the weighting
for the pathways over the rates that are used in the population
model. In this case, we mainly used data directly coming from
in vitro experiments using one cytokine at a time. In vitro experi-
ments with the combined use of two or three cytokines were then
used to establish the presence of interrelations among cytokines and
their weighting. Finally, tuning with free parameters was achieved
using a trial and error procedure in such a way that the model was

completely able to reproduce all experiments with one, two or three
cytokine combinations. Adding a new cytokine to the model
required us to follow the procedure already presented, taking into
account both qualitative and quantitative steps. The first equations
we present relate to cytokine behaviors. Cytokines are added at the
beginning of the experiment. They interact with cognate receptors
on normal cells (both CD133+ and CD34+ HSC/HPC and CD133—
differentiated cells) and can disappear from the system due to nat-
ural degradation pathways. So the typical equation structure is given
by the following equation:

dc,-
dt

 

= —m,-C,- —  + 

where C,- represents the it], cytokine, m,- is the degradation rate, x,- is
the absorbing or interacting rate and S and D represent the normal
CD133+ and differentiated cell populations, respectively.

As already stated, we take into account four populations alto-
gether: normal inactivated CD133+ cells (S), normal differentiating
cells (D), duplicating CD133+ cells (Sa) and duplicating CD133—
differentiating cell subsets (Da). These populations are described by
the following system of ODE:

 

 

 

f
g 2 _(m1 _ sur) .5 — kls + sza
dSat -
at = —<m1 — sur> -S. — dlf-Sa + dup - Sa + M - kzsa
< dD '
E 2 —(m2 — sur) - D — [23D + k4Da +  Sa
\ dial 2 —(m2 — sur) -Da1 + dup ' D21 + k3D _ k4Da

We have made the assumption that both normal (S and D) and
duplicating (S,1 and Da) cell populations behave in a similar way.
Normal CD133+ cells (S) have a non-zero value at the beginning of
the experiment. They can disappear from the system through apop-
tosis (m1 coefficient), although this programmed death rate can be
lowered thanks to the added cytokines, which can activate intracel-
lular signaling pathways that improve survival (-sur coefficient).
Then such cells, after interacting with a specific growth factor, can
activate a signaling pathway resulting in the duplication of the cell
population (Sa) with a given rate k1 and (once they duplicate) they
revert to an inactivated state with a given rate k2. Duplicating
CD133+ cells (Sa) are assumed to have the same death coefficient as
normal inactivated CD133+ cells (—(m1-sur)) and can duplicate again
or proceed to differentiate with dup and dif coefficients, respect-
ively. Such coefficients are estimated on the basis of the cytokine-
induced pathways at intracellular level. Since their number is 0 at
the beginning of the experiment, the only source term for S,1 cells is
given by the term le, which indicates activation from the normal
CD133+ inactivated state. Finally, they can go back to the normal
inactivated state with a given coefficient k2. Normal differentiated
cells (D) can be introduced into the system due to cytokine effects
that stimulate CD133+ cells to differentiate (+difSa). Such cells have
a similar death coefficient as described before, can be activated
allowing their differentiation (—k3D) and can revert to an inacti-
vated state (+k4D). Finally, duplicating differentiating cells (Da) are
introduced into the system from the D population (+k3D), can go
back to the D subpopulation (—k4D), can duplicate with a coeffi-
cient estimated on the basis of cytokine-induced pathways
(+dupDa) and can be exposed to programmed cell death as previ-
ously described (-(—m2-sur)). The equations at the intracellular level
describe the activation of intracellular pathways induced by

cytokines administered at the cellular level. The activation of a given
pathway P can be due to the administration of a given Cytokine.
However, when two or more cytokines are administered, one should
take into account not only singular effects over the pathway but also
the combined effects that can positively and/or negatively inﬂuence
the pathway itself. It is clear that the effect of a cocktail of two cyto-
kines cannot be represented only by the sum of the effects obtained
by administering such cytokines one at a time since competition, in-
hibition or synergistic mechanisms may arise. In particular when we
use three cytokines, we should take into account the singular effects
of the cytokines, the effects given by all the combinations of three
cytokines grouped by two and the combined effect of all three cyto-
kines. So in general, we can describe the activation of a pathway by
a cocktail of cytokines using the following equation:

+ Z A,,-kf3(C,-,C,-, (3,) +  +A1___,,f,,(C1  c”) (1)

iaiakEIP;

Where P], is the nth pathway, -upP;, describes the loss of activation
of the pathway P1,, A,- is a vector of coefficients which describe the
effects of cytokine C,- over the pathway, A,,- is a 2D symmetric matrix
(with A,,- = 0) that contains the coefficients of the effects of the com-
bined administration of two cytokines C,- and C,,- Aijk is a 3D sym-
metric matrix (with Aijk = 0 if i = j, j 2 la or la 2 i) that contains the
coefficients of the effects of the combined administration of three
cytokines C,-, C,- and Ck,- Almn is the coefficient that describes the
combined administration of all cytokines and

f,(C1,C2,...,C,-) = {/Cl - c2 - .. - c,-

is a set of n normalized functions that is used to describe the simul-
taneous presence of two or more cytokines. The signaling pathway
equations are then used to estimate the three coefficients (sur for sur-
vival, dif for differentiation and dup for duplication) that determine
the effects of the pathways at the cellular level. The three coefficients
are estimated at every time-point using the following equations:

where n is the total number of pathways; P,- represents the it], path-
way; q,, B,- and y,- are coefficients set equal to 1 if the pathway P,- in-
ﬂuences survival, duplication and/or differentiation, 0 elsewhere
(see Supplementary Table S1); G,- (i = 1.3) is a set of bounded
functions that is used to model the fact that all cells are subject to
biological constraints, no matter how many external stimuli are pro-
vided (i.e. a cell cannot duplicate over a certain ratio even if cytokine
dosage is increased more and more); H j and ci are tuned constants.

2.5 Data and biology driven tuning of the ODE model
To reproduce the in vitro experiments in our model, it is important
to determine both the singular and combined effects of the cytokines

on the activation of signal-transduction pathways. These effects will
inﬂuence the value of the coefficients defined inside the interaction
matrices A. It is clear that not all the coefficients will have a non-
zero value, and consequently, many terms inside the equations that
describe activation pathways can be omitted. It is worth mentioning
that the signaling transduction analysis and clustering procedure we
have already described have allowed us to qualitatively, but not
quantitatively, establish the influence of cytokines over activation
pathways. Hence, the values of the coefficients inside the A; vector
have been set by simulating the administration of one cytokine at a
time in such a way that in silico results are comparable with in vitro
results. Then, we proceeded by determining the coefficients of the
Aij matrix by administering two cytokines at a time and comparing
again in silico with in vitro results. In many cases, the presence of
enhancing or suppressing effects of these coefficients was confirmed
by several in vitro experimental studies, in particular: (i) the add-
ition of IL-6 to SCF, TPO and Flt3L supported CD34+/CD133+ cell
expansion (Pepperell and Watt, 2013; Rappold et al., 1999); (ii)
combination of TPO with another early acting cytokine would sup-
port expansion of repopulating cells in immunodeficient mice
(Piacibello et al., 1997); (iii) the association of Flt3L and TPO may
entail a progressive, steady increase in cell production (Piacibello
et al., 1997); (iv)Flt3L may synergize well with a number of other
hematopoietic growth factors and increase the response of HSC/
HPC to other growth factors. The synergistic effect in combination
with IL-6, SCF and TPO has been demonstrated (Haylock et al.,
1997; Koller et al., 1996; Ohmizono et al., 1997; Shurin et al.,
1998); (v) TPO alone may induce differentiation of CD34+ cells
into CD41+ cells, with limited total leukocyte expansion, but the
addition of SCF to TPO can decrease significantly the percentage of
CB CD41+ cells (De Bruyn et al., 2005; van der Garde et al., 2014);
(vi) FGF-1 can hamper HSC/HPC differentiation into more mature
hematopoietic cells (De Haan et al., 2003; Falcon et al., 2000); (vii)
OSM cooperates with SCF to enhance CB CD133+CD34+ prolifer-
ation and counteracts the SCF-mediated loss of repopulating cells in
immunodeficient mice (Oostendorp et al., 2008); (viii) angptL5 and
IGFBP2 could enhance CD133+CD34+ HSC/HPC expansion and
differentiation (Drake et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2008). To this end,
all the experimental data coming both from literature and from the
in vitro data for 1, 2 and 3 or more cytokine combinations were
used to tune the model. Other PMIDs of articles that describe the
pathways we used in the analyses are provided in Supplementary
Table S5. The final intracellular model (Supplementary Fig. 52),
the variables’ definition (Supplementary Table 52) and the values
of the coefficients (Supplementary Table S3) are presented as

3 Results and discussion

Many clinical and experimental protocols for expanding CB CD34+
or CD133+ HSPCs include a basic cytokine cocktail of SCF, TPO,
Flt3L and IL-6 and then additional factors are added to enhance
HSC/HPC expansion. As the basis for developing our model, we
first examined the effects of these four cytokines on the expansion
and differentiation of purified CB CD133+ HSC/HPCs in our 8-day
serum-free 3D scaffold culture system, without or with the addition
of AngptL5, IGFBP2, OSM and FGF-1. The results of these analyses
for four different CB donors are shown in Figure 1. Notably, the
addition of AngptL5 and IGFBP2 enhanced the mean TNC and
CD133+CD34+ cell fold expansion, and this was further enhanced
by addition of OSM and FGF-1. It should be noted that SCF has

been reported to promote HSC expansion by synergizing with such
factors as TPO, Flt3L and cytokines, which signal via the gp130 re-
ceptor or IL-6, OSM and IL-11 (see Oostendorp et al., 2008 and ref-
erences therein). Indeed, OSM has been demonstrated to be
particularly important in modulating SCF-induced ERK activation
in human CB CD133+CD34+ cells, increasing their proliferation
while preserving their in vivo repopulating ability (Oostendorp
et al., 2008). We next added or subtracted cytokines to/from the
basic SCF, TPO, Flt3L and IL-6 cocktail. Figure 2 shows the mean
fold expansion of TNC and CD133+CD34+ cells (Fig. 2A) and the
percentage of the CD34+CD133+ cells after expansion (Fig. 2B) for
19 of the individual cytokines or cytokine combinations tested.
Some of these cocktails were used for the development and the
tuning of the model, while some of them were employed to validate
the predictions that the model made. In general, addition of a single
cytokine did not result in expansion of CB cells from the enriched
CD133+ starting population over 8 days on our 3D nanofiber scaf-
fold under serum-free culture conditions, with the exception of SCF
and TPO (5.7 i 0.9 and 1.8 : 0.5-fold expansion of TNC, respect-
ively). However, only SCF was able to expand cells with the double
CD133+CD34+ phenotype (SCF: 2.6:0.4-fold, TPO: 0.3:0.1-
fold). This is consistent with SCF possessing weak proliferative ac-
tivity when used alone (Tarasova et al., 201 1). We used these experi-
mental data to start tuning the model. FLt3L alone in the cultures
resulted in the same TNC number after expansion as before expan-
sion (1.0 : 0.3-fold expansion), but half of these cells had lost their
double positive phenotype (fold CD133+CD34+ expansion:
0.5 i 0.2). Less than 20% of the cells survived after when IL-6,
FGF-1 or Oncostatin-M (OSM) were added as the sole cytokine
(Fig. 2 and data not shown). This indicates that SCF is essential for
the survival of these cells and that this factor cannot be excluded
from the cytokine cocktail that is added to the culture medium. TPO
alone doubled the number of TNC, but the proportion of
CD133+CD34+ cells was reduced to only a third of the starting
population, suggesting that TPO can provide a survival signal but
can also promote differentiation into more mature phenotypes. This
is in agreement with our recent demonstration that TPO can
enhance early platelet engraftment and hence can enhance platelet
progenitor cell differentiation at the expense of maintaining longer
term repopulating cells (van der Garde et al., 2014). We used our

Fig. 3. In silico results. (A) In silico results showing the effects of adding one
cytokine at a time. Compared with the other cytokines, SCF alone markedly
improves both TNC and CD133+CD34+ fold expansion. (B) In silico results
showing the effects of adding two cytokines to the cocktail added to CD133+
cell cultures. Once again, SCF plays a fundamental role in both TNC and
CD133+CD34+ fold expansion. (C) In silico results showing the effects of
some cocktails composed by three or more cytokines on the CD133+ cells. As
observed in vitro, the model shows that SCF and TPO represent an important
starting point for the formulation of any optimal cocktail. The introduction of
FGF-1 to the SCF+TPO+Flt3L cocktail seems to worsen the overall expansion
results for both TNC and CD133+CD34+ cells. However, the three cytokine
combination of SCF+TPO+Flt3L with the addition of lL-6 and FGF-1 appears
to be a better possible candidate than SCF+TPO_Flt3L for optimal cell expan-
sion within the limitation of these studies. These cocktails also preserve an
acceptable level of CD133+CD34+ cells

in vitro results that Flt3L better maintains CD133+CD34+ cell con-
tent than TPO, IL-6 and FGF-1 (Fig. 2) and reports in the literature
(Shurin et al., 1998) that the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is triggered
when Flt3L is added to cells. Figure 3A depicts in silico results of the
model simulating the addition of one cytokine at a time on the fold
expansion of TNC and CD133+CD34+ cells and also shows that

Flt3L promotes a better CD133+CD34+ fold expansion when
compared with the other cytokines, excepting for SCF that has a
stronger effect. For this and other cytokines tested in vitro (Fig. 2
and data not shown), the model was able to reproduce the in vitro
results (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the in silico results also highlight the
importance of SCF for both cell populations. Adding a second cyto-
kine to either SCF or TPO markedly improved the TNC and
CD133+CD34+ cell expansion. Addition of TPO, IL-6 or Flt3L to
SCF resulted in 25.1 i 1.0, 15.0 i 2.7 and 28.1 : 8.3-fold TNC ex-
pansion and 7.9 i 0.2, 6.5 i 1.0 and 7.9 : 2.6-fold expansion of the
CD133+CD34+ cells, respectively (Fig. 2). This is consistent with
the demonstration that these four cytokines are early acting factors
which act synergistically on HSC/HPC (Tarasova et al., 201 1). FGF-
1 added to SCF (4.6 : 1.8-fold TNC and 2.0 : 0.7-fold
CD133+CD34+ expansion) did not improve expansion as much as
SCF alone (Fig. 2). Addition of IL-6, FGF-1 or Flt3L to TPO im-
proved expansion of TNC only (2.7—6.1-fold) but to a lesser extent
than when each of these factors was added to SCF. This again shows
that SCF is an essential component of the culture medium. These
data were also used to tune the in silico model. In particular, Figure
3B shows the in silico results after the application of the model to
simulate the effects on TNC and CD133+CD34+ cells when two
cytokines were added. The model correctly reproduced the in vitro
experiments obtained when SCF or TPO were used in combination
with another cytokine. Similar results were also reported in
Piacibello et al. (1997).

Adding three cytokines to the culture medium further improves
expansion but only if both SCF and TPO are present in the cytokine
cocktail. Figure 2 demonstrates that the expansion improves when
IL-6, FGF-1 or Flt3L is added to SCF and TPO (25.5 :5.8-fold
TNC and 7.9:0.2-fold CD133+CD34+ expansion for SCF and
TPO and 31.3: 10.1, 44.5 :4.1, 120.9:23.3-fold TNC and
8.4 i 2.8, 13.1 i 1.0 and 31.2 : 6.4-fold CD133+CD34+ expan-
sion with IL-6, FGF-1 or Flt3L addition, respectively). The expan-
sion seen after the addition of FGF-1 to SCF and TPO was thus
3-fold lower compared with the addition of Flt3L to SCF and TPO,
while adding Flt3L to SCF and TPO led to the highest fold expan-
sions of both TNC and CD34+CD133+ cells (Fig. 2). Thus, combin-
ing these factors, which when used alone can maintain or expand
limited numbers of cells, leads to a synergistic effect that dramatic-
ally improves the expansion capacity of the cells. The addition of
AngptL5, IGFBP2 or OSM alone with SCF and TPO did not im-
prove the expansion over 8 days compared with the combination of
SCF and TPO (25.5 :5.8-fold TNC and 7.9: 0.2-fold CD133+
CD34+ expansion for SCF and TPO and 14.6 i 4.5, 4.1 + 8.5,
11.1 + 3.1-fold TNC and 6.6 i 2.5, 1.6+ 0.7 and 4.1 : 1.3-fold
CD133+CD34+ expansion with IL-6, FGF-1 or Flt3L addition,
respectively).

The in vitro results based on the combination of SCF/T PO with
one other cytokine, namely IL-6, FGF1 or Flt3L were also used to
tune the in silico model (Fig. 3C). We then used the model to see if a
better cocktail than SCF/TPO/FLT3L was achievable. Simulations
showed that the addition of FGF-1 to the SCF/TPO/Flt3L cocktail
worsened both TNC and CD133+CD34+ fold expansion, suggesting
the presence of one or more inhibition/competition mechanisms be-
tween FGF-1 and the other used cytokines. We then added IL-6 to
the SCF/TPO/FGF-1/Flt3L cocktail, to try to forecast the combined
effect of SCF/TPO/IL-6/FGF-1/Flt3L on CD133+ cell expansion
since in silico results suggested that such an addition may generate
marginally higher absolute numbers of both TNC and
CD133+CD34+ cells compared with the SCF/TPO/Flt3L cocktail,
and this therefore needed to be verified in vitro. In the in vitro

experiments, SCF/TPO/Flt3L/FGF-1/IL-6 did indeed prove better for
TNC (124.5 : 30.9-fold) and CD133+CD34+ (49.0 : 11.8-fold)
expansion than SCF/TPO/Flt3L (Fig. 2). Adding IL-6 to SCF, TPO
and Flt3L without FGF-1 also enhanced TNC expansion but was on
average less potent than the five cytokine combination for
CD133+CD34+ cell expansion (136.4 : 15.6 and 45.4 : 5.6-fold,
respectively, with SCF/TPO/Flt3L/IL-6). It is worth noting that some
cytokine interrelations have not been taken into account due to the
lack of experimental data, or because some of them are not known,
disputed or not clear. As far as new data are concerned, these can be
added to the model when available to better forecast the combined
effects of missing cytokine cocktails.

As mentioned in Section 1, the preservation of an immature
progenitor phenotype (i.e. maintaining the expression of
CD133+CD34+ cells), while promoting their differentiation into
CD34+CD133_ cells, is an important aspect of expansion. This was
indeed the main target of the in silico model. The percentage of
CD133+CD34+ cells after expansion on a 3D scaffold in serum-free
medium for 8 days is shown in Figures 1 and 2. The supply of a scaf-
fold is often absent in other expansion protocols and this can lead to
longer culture periods. Addition of a single cytokine in our culture
system showed that SCF maintains the double positive phenotype
better than TPO alone (45.4 i 3.8% versus 15.9 i 1.8%). This is
also reﬂected by the low expansion of CD133+CD34+ cells by TPO.
Addition of other cytokines such as IL-6 or Flt3L alone resulted in
higher percentages of CD133+CD34+ cells, but since there was no
net fold TNC expansion, these results are difficult to interpret since
it is more likely that these high percentages show that some
CD133+CD34+ cells survive better with these added cytokines.
Addition of Flt3L to medium containing SCF resulted in lower per-
centages of double-positive cells (27.6 i 0.9%) than addition of
IL-6 (44.0 : 3.0%), TPO (31.6 : 0.7) or FGF-1 (42.8 : 0.8%), with
SCF, but, due to the larger increase in TNC expansion, the fold ex-
pansion of the CD133+CD34+ cells was higher nonetheless. One
possibility is that Flt3L is able to stimulate proliferation of the
CD133+CD34+ cells as well as enhance the asymmetrical division
of these cells into more differentiated cells. Adding Flt3L to both
TPO and SCF yielded a higher fold TNC expansion, but a lower per-
centage of CD133+CD34+ cells (25.7 i 0.7%), when compared
with addition of IL-6 (26.6 i 0.4%) or FGF-1 (29.5 i 0.6%). Thus,
our model would predict a minimum of three cytokines (SCF/TPO/
Flt3L) as the basic starting conditions for further cytokine and small
molecule additions in terms of CB CD133+CD34+ expansions.

4 Conclusions

In this article, we have examined the effects of eight cytokines on
the expansion of CB CD133+CD34+ cells and their differentiation
into CD133—CD34_ cells using an 8-day 3D scaffold serum-free cul-
ture system. These cytokines are used experimentally or in clinical
studies of CB HSC/HPC expansion to enhance HSC numbers and
prevent delays in early hematological engraftment. As was expected,
our experimental studies in vitro demonstrated a critical role for
SCF, with enhanced expansion of CD133+CD34+ cells using a min-
imal cocktail of SCF, TPO and Flt3L. Importantly, our in silico
model allowed us to predict the inﬂuence of such cytokines on the
survival, duplication and differentiation of the CD133+CD34+
HSC/HPCs.

Reaching these conclusions required laborious efforts to extract
the main signaling pathways that are considered to play an import-
ant role in these processes. This extraction or, more appropriately,

the summation of these signaling pathways was required because an
exhaustive model of a single biological pathway entails very com-
plex models based on systems of tens to many thousands of equa-
tions; moreover in many cases, it includes unknowns that cannot be
measured experimentally. We then proceeded to apply the old but
effective approach sometimes referred to as the lex parsimoniae
(‘the law of briefness’) or most commonly known as the Ockam’s
Razor, ‘Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate’. In very simple
words, in the description of a phenomenon, the most useful model is
the one where more entities are not used than are necessary. In this
regard, following up the above example for a minimal cytokine
cocktail, we used the most important elements gathered both from
the literature and from experimental evidence to develop an ODE
model. The final model revealed that by adding IL-6 and FGF-1 to
the minimal cytokine cocktail described above (i.e. SCF+IL-
6+TPO+Flt3L+FGF-1; Fig. 3C), we could achieve the main two
targets for our model, i.e. preserving or enhancing CD133+CD34+
cell numbers while using the minimum number of cytokines to gen-
erate the highest CD133+CD34+ cell expansion based on the cyto-
kines selected for study. The prediction was confirmed in vitro,
ratifying the ability of the model to be used as an in silico lab to
study the effects of cytokine cocktails on CD133+CD34+ cells. One
advantage of the in silico generated protocols compared with more
traditional in vitro derived ‘trial and error’ protocols relates to the
reduction in the cost of wet lab experiments even though initially
there has been a significant investment in time in collecting and inte-
grating specialized information into a set of differential equations.

On the other hand, the model has limitations. One of these is
that not all the effects of combined cytokines can be reproduced by
the in silico model as some of them are not known or disputed or
not clear. Second, we restricted the first iteration of our model to
CD133+CD34+ HSC/HPC and further iterations will need to ana-
lyze subsets of these cells for specific effects of cytokines and small
molecules on the expansion of long term durable repopulating HSCs
and their committed multipotent progenitor cells. Indeed, the model
allows us to concentrate our attention on those biological events
that are useful to investigate, for example new interactive or epigen-
etic mechanisms that also influence stem cells dynamics. An add-
itional limit of the study is that it is entirely based on in vitro data.
Thus, combining our approach with reliable preclinical in vivo mod-
els will confirm and predict optimal expansion protocols for both
enhancing the short and longer term repopulating cells that are
needed for reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with
HSC transplantation.

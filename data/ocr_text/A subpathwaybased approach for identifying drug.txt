ABSTRACT

Motivation: The high redundancy of and high degree of cross-
talk between biological pathways hint that a sub-pathway may
respond more effectively or sensitively than the whole pathway.
However, few current pathway enrichment analysis methods account
for the sub-pathways or structures of the tested pathways. We
present a sub-pathway-based enrichment approach for identifying
a drug response principal network, which takes into consideration
the quantitative structures of the pathways.

Result: We validated this new approach on a microarray experiment
that captures the transcriptional profile of dexamethasone (DEX)-
treated human prostate cancer PC3 cells. Compared with GeneTrail
and DAVID, our approach is more sensitive to the DEX response
pathways. Specifically, not only pathways but also the principal
components of sub-pathways and networks related to prostate
cancer and DEX response could be identified and verified by literature
retrieval.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is increasingly important to understand the effects of treatment
drugs on cellular pathways and networks. Microarrays provide
a novel way to investigate the expression of thousands of
genes simultaneously, with a view to dissecting the molecular
pathways (Huang da et al., 2009). With the availability of
biological pathway databases such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000)
or BioCarta (www.biocarta.com), several resources have been
developed to visualize and analyze microarray data in the context of
known biological networks/pathways. A number of statistical tests
combined with known biological databases for detecting signiﬁcant
pathways are available for data interpretation, including GenMAPP

(Dahlquist et al., 2002), ChipInfo (Zhong et al., 2003), DAVID
(Sherman et al., 2007), GoMiner (Zeeberg et al., 2005), GSEA—P
(Subramanian et al., 2007), Onto—Tools (Khatri et al., 2007) and
GeneTrail (Backes et al., 2007).

These functional analysis tools are valuable but are unsuitable
for the detection of drug response pathways, due to a number of
limitations. First, most traditional strategies use only pre—selected
gene lists (often the differentially expressed genes) to compute
the statistic that tests the enrichment of each pathway. Common
statistical methods, such as chi—square, Fisher’s exact test, binomial
probability and hypergeometric distribution, are used to compare
number of genes in the list that coincide with a given pathway by
random chance. Neglecting less relevant genes, and merely counting
the number of pathway members contained in the reduced list,
leads to loss of information such as gene order in the pathways.
Second, while the prevalent gene—set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
(Subramanian et al., 2005) does account for gene order, the
effect of the gene—set size, the inﬂuence of other gene sets and
normalization procedures may lead to inaccurate assessment of
statistical signiﬁcance in some instances (Damian and Gorﬁne,
2004). Third, the correlation structure of pathways is not considered.
A pathway extracted from biological databases is the collection of
speciﬁc sub—pathways or modules that perform certain functions.
Different sub—pathways may perform the same function in the same
pathway and different pathways may use the same sub—pathways in
similar roles. Testing the whole pathway is too universal to determine
which individual sub—pathways respond to a particular biological
condition. Fourth, drug—induced cell microarray experiments usually
contain few samples (typically, a treated sample and a control
sample). Thus, the pathway signiﬁcance test is limited to the
traditional strategies mentioned above.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework
of sub—pathway—based strategy to identify the drug response
pathways/network. The framework consists of the generation of a
large number of relative sub—pathways (sub— graphs of the pathways
obtained from the KEGG public database), mapping of the unﬁltered
expression data onto them and statistically scoring for identiﬁcation
of the principal component of sub—pathways (PCSs) that is most
perturbed by two stage designs. PCSs are then combined into a larger
drug response network, on which topological and biological analyses
are performed. In an analysis of the dexamethasone (DEX) dataset,
we found that this approach can enhance the biological interpretation
of drug effect.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data description, preprocessing and normalization

Our DEX response dataset contained seven cell intensity ﬁles (CEL)
downloaded from CMAP (Lamb, 2007) (Instance ID 2079), one derived
from PC3 cell lines treated with 9.2 uM DEX and the other six derived
from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)—treated PC3 cell lines. The raw data were
scaled using the R RMA package. For each sample, the expression values
of all probes for a given gene were reduced to a single value by taking the
maximum expression value. For the DMSO—treated samples, the expression
value for a given gene was the average of the six samples, effectively reducing
these samples to a single DMSO—treated sample.

2.2 Obtainment 0f sub-pathways by parsing the KEGG
pathway

Each pathway map stored in KEGG can be downloaded in its own XML
format (named KGML), which contains information about nodes in the map,
such as their relationships, their coordinates, and what genes or compounds
exist in the nodes. The pathway maps describe the combination of ordered
linear sequences of protein direct/indirect interactions or metabolic reactions
from biologically meaningful start—points (membrane receptors or their
ligands) to end—points (transcriptional factors or their immediate targets).
In such a map, the start—points have no parent nodes and the end—points
have no descendant nodes. The sub—pathway is deﬁned by an individual path
from a start—point to an end—point in a pathway map. For a given KEGG
pathway, the sub—pathways were obtained by searching all possible paths
between start—points and end—points in the adjacency matrix generated by
node relationships extracted from KGML ﬁles.

2.3 Identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant drug—response
principal sub-pathways

To identify signiﬁcant principal sub—pathways responding to a drug, two stage
tests are employed (Lin, 2006; Nguyen et al., 2009; Skol et al., 2007; Wang
et al., 2006).The ﬁrst is used to deﬁne a subset of candidate sub—pathways,
from which the second can capture the principal sub—pathways.

In the ﬁrst—stage test, the sub—pathway state is represented by a vector
pj=[g1,g2,...,gn], where g,- is the expression value of gene i in sub—
pathway j. Here, we employ Euclidean distance dj =|| p;- —pj Hz to describe
the state change of each sub—pathway, where p;- and pj represent the states of
sub—pathway j after and before drug treatment, respectively. A larger distance
corresponds to greater sensitivity of the sub—pathway to the drug. When there
are several genes in a sub—pathway node, the maximum expression—fold—
change gene is chosen for the node. To identify signiﬁcant drug response
sub—pathways, we take the statistic for all sub—pathways and draw 100 000
random gene sets of the same size from all the genes to represent the
background distribution. The P—value is calculated as the fraction of re—
sampled gene set statistic that exceeds the observed value (P—value cutoff
0.05).

The second—stage test focuses on the key genes (PCS) that drive the
drug response sub—pathways. Our goal is to develop an approach that
would identify PCSs and their networks most inﬂuenced by drugs. First,
we selected the top n genes that gave cumulative contribution at least up to
80% to signiﬁcant sub—pathway state change and designated these PCS. The
contribution was calculated by

,. 2 2:2. (gym —g;k>>2

’ 2121(5); —g.-)2 ’
where g; and g,- are the expression values of gene i in the presence or absence
of drugs, respectively, k is the rank of gene i contribution and n is the size
of sub—pathway j. Next, the signiﬁcance of PCSs were assessed by the same
method used to identify signiﬁcant drug response sub—pathways (cf. the ﬁrst
stage test in the above paragraph), and the P—value was adjusted by false
discovery rate (FDR, cutoff 0.05) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Thus,

the signiﬁcant PCS is the sub—pathway since this PCS dominates the state
change of the sub—pathways. Effectively, the sub—pathways containing the
signiﬁcant PCSs represent signiﬁcant responses to a drug. To prioritize these
PCSs with respect to DEX response in PC3 cell lines, the PCS were scored
by

2.4 Construction and analyses of principal network to
drug

From the identiﬁed PCSs and their structures (key gene relationships)

maintained from their original sub—pathways, we constructed a principal

drug response network and analyzed its topological properties using

NetworkAnalyzer (Assenov et 01., 2008).

3 RESULTS

3.1 General information of sub-pathway

The 201 pathway XML ﬁles were downloaded from KEGG, and 169
pathways involving metabolism, genetic information processing,
environmental information processing, cellular processes and
human diseases were used for further analyses after excluding the
pathways lacking node relationships. In total, 87 732 sub—pathways
were generated from the 169 KEGG pathway maps by the depth—
ﬁrst search algorithm. These contained 4179 genes and were
highly redundant since each gene participated in approximately
20 sub—pathways. The maximum number of sub—pathways (16 154)
was identiﬁed for the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis—lacto and
neolacto series pathways, while several pathway maps, such as the
tetrachloroethene degradation pathway, were parsed into only one
sub—pathway (Supplementary Table 1).

3.2 Signiﬁcant response sub-pathway t0 DEX in
ﬁrst-stage test

A total of 8252 sub—pathways containing 825 genes were
signiﬁcantly identiﬁed (P < 0.05), indicating that the response genes
were highly shared, or cross—talked, between the sub—pathways or
pathways. Signiﬁcant sub—pathway lengths, derived from 92 KEGG
pathways (Supplementary Table 2), ranged from 2 to 18, with an
average of 9 (Fig. 1).

Fig. 2. The rate distribution of cumulative contribution of the top n genes up
to 80% for the different length of signiﬁcant sub—pathways. At most, six genes
could represent the majority of sub—pathways, with only three sub—pathways

requiring more key genes (i.e. only three sub—pathways could not be utilized
under our speciﬁed conditions).

The proportions of signiﬁcant sub—pathways varied for different
pathways. For example, in the Circadian rhythm pathway, all
sub—pathways were signiﬁcant, whereas the proportion of signiﬁcant
sub—pathways in the Arachidonic acid metabolism pathway was only
0.063%.

The state changes in these signiﬁcant sub—pathways were
determined by the genes within them. However, these genes
affected their sub—pathway states to different extents. The expression
level changes of these genes dominated the whole sub—pathway,
thus their cumulative contributions were scored by the statistic
(Supplementary Figure 1). More than 90% of sub—pathways
containing less than nine genes and more than 85% of sub—pathways
containing 9—18 genes, were controlled by 2—3 genes and by
4—6 genes, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1). This implies that
only a few genes (PCSs) regulate the drug response sub—pathways.
Therefore, focusing on PCS genes might provide an economical way
of elucidating the molecular mechanisms of drug response.

3.3 PCSS t0 DEX

As described above, the entire sub—pathway seems to be governed
by only a few genes. It is therefore necessary to know which
genes dominate the sub—pathway response state and the maximum
number of these genes required. Therefore, we ranked the genes
by their contributions to the state change of sub—pathway from
high to low, and deﬁned PCS standing for the sub—pathway by
the cumulative contribution of the top n genes up to 80%. We
then calculated the proportions of different length PCSs to different
length sub—pathways (Fig. 2). We obtained 555 PCSs (FDR<0.05)
covering 213 genes, and found not only that one or several genes
were highly shared in more than two PCSs, but also that the
PCSs were highly shared by sub—pathways; indeed, one PCS could
represent an average of 16 sub—pathways. These PCSs represented
the principal states of DEX response pathways/sub—pathways. In
addition, as shown in Figure 2, at most six genes can represent one
sub—pathway. As they were highly shared, it could be inferred that
shorter sub—pathways are linked in longer sub—pathways, consistent
with the idea that signal cascades choose the most economical path
in vivo.

Conventionally, the next step is to select the most important PCSs
in the drug response sub—pathway. To this end, we applied the Sc

statistic to evaluate the priorities of PCSs to DEX in PC3 cell lines
(Supplementary Table 3). However, it was difﬁcult to determine
the optimal PCS since the PCSs were too highly cross—talked. For
example, the top 10 PCSs contained eight genes, with four genes
in common and with no gene additions from the top third to the
top tenth PCS (Fig. 3). This indicates that the ﬁrst 10 PCSs are
strongly related. This trend was apparent throughout the PCS list; the
appearance of a new gene in a PCS signiﬁed that no new genes would
appear in the next several PCSs (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table 3).
Therefore, we used the gene direct/indirect connections from their
original sub—pathways to merge the ﬁrst 10 PCSs into a single sub—
pathway (Fig. 4). The new sub—pathway reveals the basic molecular
mechanisms and effects of DEX in PC3 cell lines.

3.4 The principal response network to DEX

To reveal the comprehensive molecular mechanisms of DEX in PC3
cell lines, we merged all PCSs and constructed a DEX response
principal network, since, as described above, PCSs for the signiﬁcant
sub—pathways are highly cross—talked (Fig. 5). The correlation
coefﬁcient of node degree distribution between the principal network
and the network merging of all signiﬁcant sub—pathways was 0.69
(P<0.01), implying that the principal network had inherited the
main structure of the latter. The top 10 genes with degree and
betweenness centrality are shown in Supplementary Table 4. These
signify important genes through which DEX exerts its complex
effects in PC3 cell lines. In addition, there exist several isolated

genes in the network which respond positively to DEX and which
contribute more than 80% to their own sub—pathways. These were
either the direct target of glucocorticoid receptor (e.g. ANGPTl4)
(Koliwad et al., 2009) or the genes inﬂuenced by DEX (e.g. ILBl,
CXCL5; Goleva et al., 2008; Waterman et al., 2006) (Supplementary
Table 5). It should be noted that it was doubly—linked between
VEGFC and EGFR, contrary to what was observed in the sub—
pathway merging the top 10 PCSs (Fig. 4). DEX was found to
stabilize EGFR and decrease VEGFC to suppress angiogenesis,
whereas PC3 cells increased EGFR as a survival response. The
double—link yields additional information about the interaction
between the effects of DEX and cancer cell self—protection.

3.5 The comparison with the method which links the
differentially expressed gene pairs in the KEGG
pathways

To identify drug response sub—pathways, it was a direct and simple
method (M2) to link the differentially expressed gene pairs in the
KEGG pathways. Therefore, we compared M2 with our method
(M1) and found that few differentially expressed gene pairs in
the KEGG pathways could be connected (Supplementary Table 6).
When the fold change cutoff was 2, 28 genes were differentially
expressed and 13 genes were found in the KEGG pathways and no
path (or connection) was found between any differentially expressed
gene pair in one KEGG pathway. When the fold change cutoff
lowered at 1.5, 62 genes were differentially expressed and 28 genes
were decentralized in 54 KEGG pathways and only one path of four
genes (Senate—Notch—CSL—Hes1/5, Senate and Hes1/5 differentially
expressed) was found in Notch Signaling pathway. These results
show that most genes of linear sub—pathways or pathways do not
change their expression very large based on current knowledge of
pathways. Therefore, we considered the sub—pathway as a whole
responding to drug and developed M1. Further, we lowered the fold
change cutoff from 1.4 to 1.2 and the result of M2 varied very large
(Supplementary Table 6). It is not easy to choose a fold change
cutoff here. Cross—talks are very universal between pathways or

between sub—pathways. For example, in Jak—stat signaling pathway,
SHP2, GRB and SOS are common genes in the seven sub—pathways
which start from STAM, EPO, IFN, IL2/ 3, IL6, UPD or SHPl. When
two or more sub—pathways have two common genes differentially
expressed, M2 does not test which sub—pathway is signiﬁcant
response. M1 considers this problem and tests the sub—pathway
signiﬁcance in the ﬁrst stage design. In addition, M2 has to keep
the genes connecting differentially expressed genes to stand for the
response sub—pathways, even if their expression changes are so small
that their contributions to the state change of sub—pathways could be
ignored. M1 selects the signiﬁcant top n genes that give cumulative
contribution at least up to 80% to signiﬁcant sub—pathway state
change and keeps their direct/indirect relationships to stand for the
sub—pathways.

4 DISCUSSION

Current approaches typically study whole pathways, whether by
singular enrichment analysis or by gene set enrichment analysis
(Huang da et al., 2009). However, these methods may be unsuitable
for the identiﬁcation of drug response genes. A pathway comprises
sets of expressed genes that lead to a complex phenotype
(e. g. prostate cancer) or which perform a function (e. g. apoptosis).
We generated 87732 sub—pathways from 169 KEGG pathways.
Within part of a pathway, some individual sub—pathways may
give rise to disease or respond signiﬁcantly to a drug. Single
sub—pathways performing relatively simple functions coupled with
speciﬁc paths may be more suitable for assessing drug response,
than complex pathways which are currently poorly understood. To
illustrate our point, we detected DEX response pathways in PC3
cell lines using GeneTrail. None of the pathways obtained from
GeneTrail were related to biological pathways such as prostate
cancer, cancer pathways in general, WNT signaling pathway,
MAPK signaling pathway, etc. DAVID, with 28 genes (fold
change >2) or 62 genes (fold change >1.5) detected null or only
one pathway (cytokine—cytokine receptor interaction). In contrast,
our methods identiﬁed 52 signiﬁcant pathways (Supplementary
Table 7), of which a subset was unequivocally associated with
DEX response and prostate cancer (as determined by the number
of signiﬁcant sub—pathways containing signiﬁcant PCSs in the
pathways, evaluated by the hypergeometric test). Many pathways
detected were triggered directly by DEX, and there was evidence of
high cross—talk among the pathways. When a sub—pathway responds,
its pathway must respond also, rendering further tests unnecessary.
Combined, our results suggest that the sub—pathway based strategy
is more sensitive to drug response than whole—pathway approaches.

A total of 825 genes were associated with 8252 signiﬁcant
sub—pathways, with an average of one gene participating in 10
sub—pathways, revealing high cross—talk between the genes. We
hypothesize that the important genes change their expression often
in the sub—pathways and have a high degree of standing in the sub—
pathway network, since they are stimulated by multiple signals. To
test this idea, we extracted 555 PCSs according to their contributions
to the sub—pathway state changes, and found that the standing
degrees of those genes were on average higher (t—test, P = 5.59E—08)
than those of non—PCS genes in the sub—pathway—based network.
Afterwards, we designed the statistic to evaluate the priorities of
these PCSs to DEX in PC3 cell lines, which effectively ranked PCSs
and hinted at strong links between the top 10 PCSs and DEX—treated

Drug-response principal network

 

prostate cancer cells (Fig. 4). In addition, the cross—talking among
sub—pathways could supplement existing pathway knowledge. For
example, inspired by Rhee et al. (1995), we deduced that CCND3
inﬂuences proliferation of CCNDl—expressing cells in the prostate
cancer pathway (Fig. 4).

From supplementary Figure 2, we found that, at ﬁrst stage,
only 2—3 genes contributed >90% (median) to the signiﬁcant
sub—pathways containing less than 9 genes, and that 4—6 genes
contributed >85% (median) to the sub—pathways containing
9—18 genes. As already mentioned, this implies that the response
sub—pathways are mainly caused or represented by a few genes
only (the PCSs). We deﬁned six as the default number of genes
in a PCS. PCSs with size less than six might not represent all
signiﬁcant sub—pathways in the ﬁrst stage, since their contribution
might not reach 80%. Figure 2 illustrates that, at most, six
genes could represent the majority of sub—pathways, with only
three sub—pathways requiring more key genes (i.e. only three
sub—pathways could not be utilized under our speciﬁed conditions).
Thus, ﬁxing the contribution rate cutoff at 80% could minimize
the number of lost signiﬁcant sub—pathways in the ﬁrst stage, while
maintaining the maximum contribution rate.

The genes in PCSs are highly shared (213 genes in 555 PCSs,
Supplementary Table 3), hence it is necessary to construct a drug
response principal network by merging all of them for a systematic
explanation of DEX’s behaviors in PC3 cells. For 213 genes (26%
of 825 genes), the principal response network represents at least the
80% response state of PC3 cells to DEX, as each PCS contributes
more than 80% to its sub—pathway. In the principal response network,
DEX’s biological effects are reﬂected in the node functions. For
example, increase of PIK3CA and decrease of either FOXO3 (Shang
et al., 2009; Skurk et al., 2004) or CASP9 (Hakem et al., 1998)
hint that DEX may promote proliferation and block apoptosis in
PC3 cells. It is worth noting that the up and down nodes may
disaccord as EGF and EGFR, since EGFR is triggered by a multitude
of other signaling molecules. Although gene—by—gene analysis of
the network reveals the main response molecular mechanisms of
DEX in PC3 cells, we suggest that the function of a sub—pathway
is better explained through its original pathway map. DEX, a
synthetic glucocorticoid, has been shown to exhibit single—agent
activity in prostate cancer (Venkitaraman et al., 2008). Therefore, we
investigated the PCSs in pathways in cancer (KEGG ID: hsa05200),
and found that DEX suppresses prostate cancer mainly by inhibiting
sustained angiogenesis, while promoting apoptosis evasion and
cell proliferation (Supplementary Figure 2). Similarly, we found
that PCSs in the prostate cancer pathway (KEGG ID: hsa05215)
play roles in apoptosis inhibition, cell proliferation and cell cycle
progression (Supplementary Figure 3). Encouragingly, this ﬁnding
is reﬂected in the top 10 PCSs ranked by the Sc statistic (Fig. 4).

DEX is the most commonly used type of steroid to treat the
prostate cancer that has spread. (Alimirah et al., 2006). The
response principal network exhibits several postulated mechanisms
by which DEX exerts its effects in cancer. DEX has been shown
to attenuate the transcriptional activity of NF—kB and API (FOS
and JUN) (Nishimura et al., 2001), resulting in the inhibition of
IL6 and the NF—kB—IL6 pathways in prostate cancer (Akakura
et al., 2003; De Bosscher et al., 2003). DEX has also been
shown to suppress angiogenesis in a prostate cancer xenograft
model, reducing IL8 and VEGF expression in vitro and in vivo,
respectively (Yano et al., 2006). In addition, our results indicate that

suppressed PC3 cells take a strong line of self—defense by activating
proliferation sub—pathways, by inhibiting apoptosis sub—pathways,
and even by promoting the circadian rhythm pathway to activate
the WNT pathway (CSNKlD—WNT5A—TCF7L1—JUN—MAP2K1),
which increases cytoactivity (Fu and Lee, 2003; Schwarz—Romond
et al., 2002). These results suggest that DEX should be combined
with other anti—tumor drugs (especially the EGFR inhibitors) in
the effective treatment of prostate cancer. Consistent with this,
combined inhibition of VEGF and EGFR is effective in EGFR
inhibitor—resistant cell lines, and increases beneﬁt compared with
either of these anti—EGFR agents alone or when combined with
chemotherapy (Tortora et al., 2008).

Reproducibility analysis of the principal DEX response network
was performed using another batch instance (ID 5797), held
under the same conditions as batch instance 2079. A total of
9045 sub—pathways (composed of 808 genes) and 632 PCSs
(composed of 217 genes) were signiﬁcantly identiﬁed, of which
4350 sub—pathways (approximately half of sub—pathways) and 71
key genes (approximately one—third of PCS genes) were identical
to those found in batch instance 2079. The low reproducibility
of key genes was expected, since it reﬂects the apparently low
reproducibility of true discoveries in microarray studies (Zhang
et al., 2008). The higher reproducibility of signiﬁcant sub—pathways
indicates that they perform speciﬁc functions, again consistent with
the results of microarray studies, which are more reproducible at
functional level (Gong et al., 2010). In addition, the functional
similarity of the Gene Ontology (GO) terms enriched in the
two PCS sets, evaluated by G—SESAME (Du et al., 2009) was
0.88, signiﬁcantly greater (P<0.01) than that of random gene
set pairs of the same size. Moreover, a dataset of 90 samples,
DEX—treated myeloma cells (GEO ID: GSE8546) was analyzed.
The DEX response principal network (composed of 274 genes) in
Myeloma, were signiﬁcantly identiﬁed. Most genes (approximately
1/2) are associated with DEX, Myeloma or cancer (Supplementary
Table 8). The functional similarity of GO terms enriched in the
principal network from GSE8546, compared with those from
instance 2079 and 5797, evaluated by G—SESAME (Du et al.,
2009), were 0.837 and 0.864, signiﬁcantly greater (P<0.01)
than that of random gene—set pairs of the same size. These
results show that our sub—pathway—based approach can potentially
detect stable drug response principal network at the functional
level.

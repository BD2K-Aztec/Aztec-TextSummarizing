ABSTRACT

Motivation: To recognize remote relationships between RNA
molecules, one must be able to align structures without regard to
sequence similarity. We have implemented a method, which is swift
[0(n2)], sensitive and tolerant of large gaps and insertions. Molecules
are broken into overlapping fragments, which are characterized by
their memberships in a probabilistic classification based on local
geometry and H-bonding descriptors. This leads to a probabilistic
similarity measure that is used in a conventional dynamic program-
ming method.

Results: Examples are given of database searching, the detection of
structural similarities, which would not be found using sequence
based methods, and comparisons with a previously published
approach.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNA has diverse roles ranging from ligand binding/recognition
to catalysis. These functions depend not just on sequence, but
more on how a molecule positions groups in space (Cech and
Bass, 1986; Coppins et al., 2007; DeRose, 2002; Kim and
Breaker, 2008; Lilly and Eckstein, 2008; Mandal and Breaker,
2004; Montange and Batey, 2008; Nudler and Mironov, 2004;
Scott, 1999; Scott and Klug, 1996; Strobel and Cochrane, 2007;
Waugh and Pace, 1986; Winkler, 2005). This means that if one
wants to detect functional similarity, one must be able to align
molecules structurally. We present a method for RNA-structure
alignment, which seems to be sensitive, reliable and with a run-
ning time comparable with sequence alignment techniques. One
could also claim that in evolutionary terms, structure is more
conserved than sequence; therefore, structural searches and
alignments will ﬁnd relationships that would be missed at the
sequence level (Holm and Sander, 1996).

If one allows for gaps and insertions, the problem of structur-
ally aligning two biopolymers is NP-complete (Godzik, 1996).
There is, however, an abundance of methods developed for
proteins using various approximations that usually provide
reasonable results (Alexandrov, 1996; Blankenbecler et al.,
2003; Carpentier et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2005; Gibrat et al.,
1996; Holm and Park, 2000; Holm and Sander, 1993; Ilyin
et al., 2004; Jung and Lee, 2000; Kawabata, 2003; Konagurthu

Suyama et al., 1997; Taubig et al., 2006; Zhu and Weng, 2005;
Zuker and Somorjai, 1989). Typically, these methods rely on
some structural property speciﬁc to proteins. For example,
most proteins can be reasonably characterized by their classic
secondary structure elements or their sequence of backbone g0,
1p angles or a contact map based on C“ atoms. In the case of
RNA, there is far less prior art, presumably because it is harder
to describe, and there is little consensus as to what constitutes a
characteristic structural motif.

In proteins, common structures are rather well described
by neglecting the backbone a) dihedral angle and considering go,
my, perhaps with additional hydrogen bond information. In
RNA, one could consider six backbone angles (or, ,8, y, 6, 8, g“)
and perhaps the X dihedral angle, which captures the orientation
of the base. At the same time, not all these descriptors are
necessary, as some of the angles are signiﬁcantly correlated
(Murthy et al., 1999). Duarte and Pyle took advantage of this
fact and pointed out that it may be more effective to deﬁne
dihedral angles based on atoms such as C4’ and P atoms from
successive bases even though they are not covalently connected
(Duarte and Pyle, 1998). Using these angles as descriptors, they
deﬁned 10 structural motifs with which they were able to recon-
struct known RNA structures with surprisingly high accuracy.
These descriptors also seemed to be sufﬁcient for ﬁnding motifs
in collections of known structures (Duarte et al., 2003; Wadley
et al., 2007).

Although there are methods for aligning RNA based on sec-
ondary structures (Havgaard et al., 2005; Hochsmann et al.,
2004; Jossinet et al., 2007; Will et al., 2007), there is a distinct
paucity of methods that use 3D properties. The approach imple-
mented in ARTS uses the coordinates of phosphorus atoms and
attempts to ﬁnd and extend sets of atom pairs, which can be
superimposed below some threshold (Dror et al., 2005, 2006).
The alignment calculation relies on the recognition of secondary
structure elements. This means the method implicitly has some
thresholds, but it has the advantage that the procedure is appar-
ently fast enough to be used for searches of a structure against a
database of known structures. Another approach is to label sites
with some structural property or combined sequence/structure
property. Sites from different molecules can be compared with
each other giving a score, which can be used in a conventional
dynamic programming algorithm. DIAL uses this approach and
bases its score on sequence, nine dihedral angles and a measure

of base pairing (Ferre et al., 2007). SARSA, by Chang et a].
(2008), used four dihedral angles to deﬁne a small structural
alphabet. This approach was revisited in iPARTS (W ang et al.,
2010), with a similar structural alphabet limited to the pseudo-
torsion angles 77 and 6 as deﬁned by Duarte and Pyle (1998).
SARA (Capriotti and Marti-Renom, 2008) follows an approach
inspired by the MAMMOTH programme for protein structure
alignment (Ortiz et al., 2002). The most recent approach,
SETTER, divides RNA structures into non-overlapping second-
ary structure elements (Cech et al., 2012). All of these methods
are sensitive to the geometry of speciﬁc sites rather than larger
pieces of structure.

In this work, we have adapted a method from the protein
literature, but one with little preconception as to what constitutes
a structural motif (Margraf et al., 2009; Schenk et al., 2008).
Instead, one says that a structure is built from overlapping frag-
ments of some length (k=5 in this work). Each fragment is
described by a set of structural descriptors (angles, distances
and a measure of likelihood to be in a base pair). A large set
of fragments from the protein data bank (PDB) (Berman et al.,
2000) was then subjected to a maximally parsimonious Bayesian
classiﬁcation yielding ~102 classes. To use this for alignments,
one can take a fragment from a new molecule and calculate the
probability that it is in class 1, 2,. . ., Ndass. This vector of prob-
abilities can be seen as a structural label for the site, but more
importantly, the dot product of two such vectors is a direct meas-
ure of their similarity. These dot products can be used directly in
a score matrix for a dynamic programming algorithm. The simi-
larity measure is a continuous property ranging from 0 to 1;
therefore, no thresholds are necessary. Calculating an optimal
alignment has 0(n2) running time albeit with a larger pre—factor
than in sequence alignments. As we show below, the method
seems to produce rather high quality alignments.

2 METHODS
2.1 Theory

The methodology is described only brieﬂy, as it has been given in detail in
the context of protein alignments (Schenk et al., 2008). Imagine one has a
probabilistic classiﬁcation of RNA fragments, each of length k. Given a
fragment, the aim is not to ﬁnd the best class for the fragment, but rather
to estimate the probability that the fragment is a member of class 1, 2,. . .,
Nclass. Each class is a set of probability distributions for each of the
structural descriptors used. For example, one might consider an angle
0:. Over a large set of fragments, or may adopt many different values.
Within one class, its distribution may be approximated by a single
Gaussian distribution. The probability of seeing some particular value
of oz can be calculated if one knows the mean no, and standard deviation
0,, within each class. In this kind of work, one does not have a single at,
but rather a set of descriptors containing several angles and distances and
a measure of the probability of a base being in a base pair. The prob-
ability of being in a class is then given by the product over each descriptor
and its corresponding distributions. Furthermore, angles may be corre-
lated. This means the best statistical model is not a set of Gaussian dis-
tributions, but perhaps a set of multivariate Gaussian distributions. To
formalize this brieﬂy, note that one is interested in the probability
P(F,- e cj|F,-) that fragment F,- is in class cj given by

 E Cj)P(Fi E Cj)

P(Fi E leFi) = HF.)

 

(1)

where P(F,) and P(F,- e cj) are prior probabilities of the descriptors of F,-
and class c]. Considering all classes, one has the normalization condition
that probabilities associated with a fragment over all classes must sum to
1. These probabilities, of course, can only be calculated after the classi-
ﬁcation is known, which leads to the next step. A classiﬁcation is really a
statistical model for the data, and its likelihood can be calculated, given
some dataset. The classiﬁcation is then constructed from some training
data, using expectation maximization, iteratively adjusting the parameters
of the distributions, searching for an ever better model for the data
(Dempster, 1977). This is a local minimization method; therefore, it is
repeated many times from different starting points.

The number of classes is also an unknown parameter, but its value is
optimized as with the rest of the classiﬁcation. The probability of a clas-
siﬁcation includes products over all classes; thus, increasing the number
of classes tends to make the statistical model less likely, unless it is
strongly supported by the data. This means the method has a natural
tendency to ﬁnd the classiﬁcation with the fewest classes.

Once a classiﬁcation is calculated, it can be used to calculate a simi-
larity score between fragments. For the fragment 1', one calculates the
vector p,- of probabilities that it is in each class using Equation (1).
Given some fragment j and its corresponding vector, the similarity of
the two fragments is just

Sij 2 Pi ' P} (2)

after normalizing both vectors to length 1. This value will be near 1 if the
two fragments have similar probability distributions and near zero if they
are different. It is a graduated measure, and therefore it is sensitive to
partial similarity. It is also tolerant of fragments, which have never been
seen before (in the training set). Their characteristic p vectors will match
best with p vectors from fragments with some similarity. Aside from 5’
and 3’ ends, each site participates in 2k—1 fragments.

2.2 Datasets and calculations

The training dataset of RNA structures was taken from the PDB
(Berman et al., 2000; Rose et al., 2011) and comprised all structures
that only contained RNA without any DNA or protein and with a reso-
lution of better than 5A. This resulted in 581 structures and just
>3.3 X 105 fragments of length k=5. For testing and searching, we
used a larger set of coordinates, considering any structure, which con-
tained RNA. This yielded 1400 coordinates ﬁles, corresponding to 2250
chains.

All alignments were calculated with Fast RNA structural Identity
Estimator (FRIES) based on wurst (Schenk et al., 2008) using the
Gotoh (1982) version of the Smith and Waterman (1981) algorithm.
Structural differences are quoted after superposition with the method
of Diamond (1988) and using the six backbone atoms C3’, C4’, C5’,
03’, 05’ and P as in Reijmers et al. (2001). As the root mean square
differences (rmsd) of coordinates calculated for random polymers grows
with the one-third power of structure length, rmsd values could be scaled
by the cube root of the alignment length for ranking the signiﬁcance of
alignments (Maiorov and Crippen, 1994).

Given the model described later in the text, the classiﬁcation was built
using autoclass (Cheeseman and Stutz, 1995) and implemented in
existing code. Comparisons were calculated with LaJolla version 2.1
(Bauer et al., 2009).

2.3 Site descriptors

The ﬁnal statistical model was based on fragments of length k: 5 with
ﬁve descriptors per base. This could be seen as 25 descriptors per frag-
ment or four independent distributions as listed in Table 1. The H-bond
score was calculated using a simple model for electrostatics. A Hydrogen
bond can be seen as DH-AX where D and A are donor and acceptor

where dAB is the distance between atoms A and B. Hydrogen atoms were
placed using standard geometry and a mean coordinate used in XHz
groups. This measure does not require any threshold for H-bonds and
values for EH fall into two Gaussian distributions. As the scaling of the
score is not important, q was set to 1. The two distances given in Table 1
were chosen, as they are rather sensitive to the compactness of a structure.
Labels X,,_1 and Y” refer to atom X of the preceding residue and atom Y
of the current residue. Rather than assume independence of the distances,
they were treated as a 10D distribution with the full covariance matrix
calculated. Similarly, we allowed for correlations within the sets of side-
chain x angles and 6 angles. One could allow for even more correlations,
but this would lead to more adjustable parameters. Angular data were
treated by considering each angle twice (in two periods) and mapping all
results back to the ﬁrst period. The model can be seen in Figure 1.

3 RESULTS

Before considering structural alignments, one can look at a few
properties of the underlying fragment classiﬁcation. This had 79
classes, although the largest 10 classes covered just >25% of the
data. The relative importance of the classes varied from 3%
down to <0.1% of the original data. As one would expect, the
most populated classes reﬂect common RNA motifs. For
example, the ﬁrst two classes have similar helical structures
(Fig. 2a and b), and, within statistical uncertainty, they are geo-
metrically indistinguishable. They do however differ in the prop-
erty, which cannot be seen in the diagram. The second class is
distinguished by a much higher probability of being involved in
H-bonds. The next most populated class also shows a common
motif: a Hoogsteen pair (Hoogsteen, 1963) in which a base pairs
with two other bases (Fig. 20).

Given the machinery for comparison, we began with an all
against all comparison within the set of 2250 chains from the
PDB. For each structure, the alignments were sorted according
to rmsd. The runtime for a pairwise comparison varied from
less than a second to ~40 minutes. The runtime for a typical
alignment [two transfer RNAs (tRNA) of ~70 bases]) was
~5 seconds. The most time-consuming examples were naturally
those between two ribosomal structures of several thousand nu-
cleotides. The biggest part of the computation time went into

This number of comparisons produced a mass of data, but we
can show some interesting examples. The most important appli-
cation is ﬁnding homology, which would not be detected using
sequence-based methods. In the case of proteins, there are em-
pirical studies showing the signiﬁcance of the degree of sequence
identity. For proteins of 100 residues, one would require 25—30%
sequence identity before regarding a pair of sequences as related
(Rost, 1999). For nucleotides, the value must be higher owing to
the smaller alphabet. As an example of a structure pair, Figure 3
shows the structural alignment of 2det chain C and 1i9v
(Mikkelsen et al., 2001; Numata et al., 2006). There is only
32% sequence identity, but the rmsd difference is only 4.9 A
calculated over the aligned 70 bases. Figure 4a shows the best
global sequence alignment of the corresponding sequences. A
superposition based on this alignment has an rmsd of 15A.
Essentially, the correct alignment, based on FRIEs structural
alignment Figure 4b, is completely missed with a sequence-based
method. It was also impossible to ﬁnd this alignment with
BLAST, as the word size cannot be set less than four (Altschul
et al., 1997).

One can also ﬁnd examples to show that the method can
ﬁnd small structures, which are similar to parts of larger ones.
Figure 5 shows the example of chain 1p5m and 1p5p (Lukavsky
et al., 2003) with an rmsd of 4.7A >55 aligned residues. In this

case, the sequence identity is 87%, but a sequence-based method
will only ﬁnd the alignment if gap penalties are set low enough to
allow a gap of 21 residues as shown in the corresponding
sequence alignment (Fig. 6). In this work, one set of gap penalties
was used for all calculations.

A more targeted application is a classic structure search. Given
some query RNA structure, can one ﬁnd related structures,
regardless of sequence homology? Perhaps the clearest example
comes from using a tRNA because this has been the most fre-
quently solved structural family. The results are summarized in
Figure 7. The tRNA used as the query structure was 1tra, and for
each alignment, one has the alignment length, sequence identity
(from the structural alignment) and rmsd. Alignments fall into
two separate sets (or clouds): In the lower part of the plot are
unrelated RNA structures, and the increasing deviation of the
cloud reﬂects the way rmsd values grow with optimal alignments

there is a clear cluster of alignments with a minimum length of
~68 bases and rmsd values ranging from 0 to 10 A (10A was the
cut-off value used for ﬁnding matches). This cluster comprises
related tRNA molecules and even includes tRNA chains buried
within larger ribosome structures. It also includes examples such
as the alignment of 1tra to 1wz2 chain D, which is an alignment
of a phenylalanine-tRNA and a leucyl-tRNA (see Fig. 8). This
alignment would also not be found by classical sequence align-
ment methods and had a sequence identity of only 48%.

There is often no such thing as a correct structural alignment
(Godzik, 1996; Lackner et al., 2000), but one can make some
comparisons between different methods. Amongst the published
methods, only LaJolla (Bauer et al., 2009) could be locally in-
stalled for comparison. An all against all comparison was
attempted. For each alignment, the rmsd and alignment length

generated by FRIES and the corresponding values generated by

LaJolla on three different sets, the ﬁrst one comprising all pos-
sible alignments of structures between 60 and 80 nucleotides (i.e.
tRNAs, see Fig. 9a and b). The second and third sets were not
limited to a certain size, but to all possible alignments for a se-
quence identity of 350% and rmsd <5 A in FRIES (Fig. 9c and

Several features are clear. First, LaJolla caps rmsd values at
2A (calculated using its selection of atoms); thus, many align-
ments found by FRIES would not be seen with LaJolla. Second,
LaJolla did not return any results for structures larger than 1000
nucleotides. The plots further show that, given the capping,
LaJolla generally produces alignments with a smaller rmsd
(9 a, 0). However, for all alignments, the number of aligned

and rde is shown for all possible alignments of three sets with different
thresholds for the FRIES results. Alignments with a Size between 60 and
80 nucleotides (i.e. tRNAS) in (a) and (b), alignments with an rmsd below
5 A and a sequence identity of <50% in (c) and (d), and alignments with
an rde below 2A in both FRIES and LaJolla in (e) and (f)

nucleotides was signiﬁcantly higher for alignments from FRIES
(9 b, d, f). We also ran a test taking into account only alignments
with rmsd values of 32A in FRIES. This showed that FRIES
could produce alignments with better rmsd values than LaJolla,
but with a signiﬁcantly larger number of aligned nucleotides.
Higher rmsd values are obviously acceptable when they reﬂect
longer and more meaningful alignments.

Finally, some programs offer web interfaces; thus, it is possible
to show some comparisons with ARTS (Dror et al., 2005, 2006),
SARA (Capriotti and Marti-Renom, 2008) and SARSA (Chang
et al., 2008). For the alignment of 2det chain C and 1i9v, ARTS
provided an alignment that comprised only 52 residues (in com-
parison with 68 residues for FRIES) but had a smaller rmsd of
1.9 A. The distinctive features of ARTS can explain this differ-
ence; its alignment method is exclusively based on the compari-
son of coordinates of phosphate atoms, and no further backbone
information is taken into account. Combined with the use of a
distance matching error, this can lead to entirely different

instead of our global one. The results for SARSA are similar
with an alignment showing many gaps. The alignment obtained
by SARA also contains gaps; however, these are located mainly
in the anticodon region of both tRNAs. Given the fact that 1i9v
describes a Phenylalanine-tRNA and 2det contains a
Glutamine-tRNA, they are most likely to differ in this area.
Using 2det chain C as query for the database search of ARTS,
1i9v will not be found at all. This is caused by the nature of the
dataset used for database searches in ARTS, which consists of
only 250 representative RNA structures. This obviously im-
proves the computation time but misses many results. SARSA
offers no database search. The alignment of 1tra and 1wz2 chain
D gave similar results. Here, the alignments with SARSA and
ARTS are slightly shorter with a correspondingly smaller rmsd
value. The alignment from SARA is similar to the one obtained
from FRIES with two more gaps, which also results in a better
rmsd value.

Some literature results are based on very few structures,
but one can also compare against them. Both SETTER
and R3D Align (Cech et al., 2012; Rahrig et al., 2010) were
compared on the basis of the alignment of two 16S rRNA struc-
tures against ARTS, SARA and DIAL. Table 2 shows little
difference between the results from FRIES and the other
approaches.

In addition to comparing FRIES against programmes using
tertiary structure, we also compared it with two methods
that compute alignments using only secondary structure.
RNAforester hierarchically ordered multiple sequence align-
ments to generate alignments of RNA secondary structure
strings (Hochsmann et al., 2004), and locaRNA (\Nill et al.,
2007) uses a Sankoff (1985) style alignment and folding. We
compared the resulting alignments in terms of two properties:
(i) the number of indels (insertions and deletions) in the resulting
sequence alignment and (ii) the structural alignment implied by
the secondary structure alignment. Property (i) shows, that for
the example of 1p5m and 1p5p, there is a big difference in the
number of indels for RNAforester and locaRNA/FRIES
(Fig. 10). The alignment obtained from RNAforester contains
30 indels in 10 gaps (Fig. 10a), whereas the alignments of
locaRNA and FRIES both show only 22 indels in two gaps
(Fig. 10b and 0). Considering the implied structural alignments,
the large differences between the alignment obtained from
RNAforester (Fig. 11a) and the ones from locaRNA (Fig. 11b)

and FRIES (Fig. 5) are even more apparent. The alignments
from FRIES and locaRNA are of similar quality, with a slightly

FRIES). The rmsd for the alignment obtained from
RNAforester is 13.4 

4 DISCUSSION

Because the structural alignment of biopolymers is fundamen-
tally NP complete (Godzik, 1996), all methods use heuristics and
approximations. The method in this work might be closest to
those which rely on some kind of structural alphabet to label
fragments. However, the method here is different in the type of
labelling used. Firstly, each site in the chain is inﬂuenced by all
overlapping fragments. This means that each pair of aligned resi-
dues reﬂects a region of nine bases. Next, the labels come from
an unsupervised learning approach (Cheeseman and Stutz, 1995);
thus, there are few preconceptions as to what constitutes a struc-
tural element. This is a major difference compared with RNA
secondary-structure aligners (locaRNA, RNAforrester), which
cannot take advantage of other common structural motifs.
Most importantly, the labels are not discrete as in a typical

structural alphabet (Chang et al., 2008) or the much smaller
alphabet (paired/unpaired) used by RNA secondary-structure
aligners. In this work, the product of the probability vectors
[Equation (2)] leads to a smooth measure of similarity; therefore,
the method works when confronted with a completely new struc-
tural element.

One should also note that the classiﬁcation of fragments is
certainly not optimal and need not be. It must only serve to
provide a ﬁngerprint for recognizing similarity. This can be
seen by a simple numerical argument. Imagine a class in the
classiﬁcation was incorrectly split into two classes, and a calcu-
lation is then faced with a fragment, which ﬁts perfectly into this
class. The calculated probability vector would have two entries
with values of 0.5. When compared with a similar vector, the dot
product would still be near 1.0.

These might be technical aspects only relevant to this method,
but there is a general technical problem with this kind of ap-
proach. Ultimately, most methods are based on some choice of
atoms and structural properties. The classic statistical mixture
model used in this work does impose one important restriction.
It must be possible to approximate the distributions of the de-
scriptors by the sums of simple distributions. For example, the
quasi-electrostatic score of Equation (3) would not be a good
model for physics, but it yields relatively well-separated sets for
H-bonded and not H-bonded sites. Similarly, the distances and
angles used here ﬁt better to Gaussian distributions than
examples from the literature (Duarte and Pyle, 1998; Duarte
et al., 2003; Wadley et al., 2007). It is also worth noting that
the choice of descriptors can have a large inﬂuence on the kind of
alignments generated. Most of the methods working with RNA
structures are dominated or begin with local structural proper-
ties. In contrast, our method included a contribution from

H-bonding, which is a distinctly non-local property in terms of
sequence. This means that Equation (3) will yield a good score
for local similarity, but there is a preference to align H-bonded
sites with H-bonded sites and vice versa. One could also say that
in an alignment calculation, one never requires a perfect match,
and an optimal alignment may involve many less than optimal
local matches.

The underlying classiﬁcation is entirely automatic and,
although not perfect, a model for the most important features
of RNA structure (given a set of descriptors). One could, for
example, interpret the most populated classes in structural
terms. Looking at Figure 2, one would say that the single most
common motif is a helix with well-described angles, but one can
statistically justify splitting it into two classes based on
H-bonding probability. The third class is also similar but is char-
acterized by one particular distance and a particular X value at
one site.

The results in this work highlight the ability to ﬁnd remote
structural similarities, but the comparisons suffer from a typical
problem. It is often difﬁcult to claim one alignment is better
than another. Method 1 may truncate alignments and return
results with a small rmsd value (structural similarity), whereas
method 2 returns longer alignments, which will appear to have a
larger rmsd value. It is completely arbitrary which method one
prefers. The results do, however, suggest that our proposal
often ﬁnds rather long alignments without a great cost in rmsd
values. This is also related to a second problem. When searching
a database for related structures, there are several reasonable
ways to rank the hits. A naive structural measure such as
rmsd will certainly retrieve similar structures, but these will
penalize longer and more interesting alignments. One can
invent similarity measures based on multiple factors, although
these will entail decisions as to the importance of different
properties.

When comparing methods, one can also see some differences
in principle. If a method tries to optimize rmsd values, it will be
sensitive to hinge movements within structures. In our approach,
rmsd values are only calculated for comparisons. This means
that the results are tolerant of hinge movements and, in particu-
lar, one has no problem with alignments in large structures such
as ribosomes.

To make comparison with literature methods easiest, the
results here were based on Smith and Waterman (1981) style
alignments, which emphasize core regions of similarity. Should
one want to force globally optimal alignments, it is only a switch
to choose Needleman and Wunsch (1970) style alignments. If one
is interested in extending the method, there are a number of
possibilities. The classiﬁcation used here was based on fragments
of length k = 5. It is possible that one would capture more struc-
tural information with longer fragments, but the classiﬁcation
time does become prohibitively expensive. One should, in prin-
ciple update the classiﬁcation, as more structures become avail-
able. This can do no harm but will only make a difference with
exotic and uncommon pieces of structure. At the moment, the
largest 25 classes account for most of the probability density. If
one doubled the amount of data, this would lead to a slightly
better statistical model for the less commonly seen fragments.
One could also say that the dataset used for the classiﬁcation
is biased. It includes too many tRNA structures because there are

so many structures in the PDB. It includes too many bases from
ribosomes because ribosome structures are so large. If one
removed these biases, it would change the prior probabilities
associated with each class and yield a classiﬁcation that was in
some chemical sense better. It would not make a great deal of
difference in this application where the aim is simply to apply
unique labels to structural fragments.

A more interesting extension would be to combine sequence
and structure information. Statistically, this means one uses a
multi-way Bernoulli description for the probability of base
types at each site. This is technically possible and has been
tested on proteins (Schenk et al., 2008), but it does raise a ques-
tion that is difﬁcult to answer. One is usually dealing with cases
where sequence similarity is so small, that one has to use struc-
tural alignments. In this regime, it is not clear as to whether
adding sequence information adds more noise or more informa-
tion. Finally, one must make the obvious concession. Structure-
based alignments can only complement sequence-based methods,
as they can only be applied to the fraction of RNAs for which a
structure has been determined.

The method presented here seems to be swift, sensitive to
remote similarities and capable of producing accurate structural
alignments of RNA structures. The code is available for down-
load and should prove useful as more RNA structures enter the
databases and one is interested in remote relationships.

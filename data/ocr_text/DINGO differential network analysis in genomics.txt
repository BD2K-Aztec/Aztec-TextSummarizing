Abstract

Motivation: Cancer progression and development are initiated by aberrations in various molecular
networks through coordinated changes across multiple genes and pathways. It is important to
understand how these networks change under different stress conditions and/or patient—specific
groups to infer differential patterns of activation and inhibition. Existing methods are limited to cor—
relation networks that are independently estimated from separate group—specific data and without
due consideration of relationships that are conserved across multiple groups.

Method: We propose a pathway—based differential network analysis in genomics (DINGO) model
for estimating group—specific networks and making inference on the differential networks. DINGO
jointly estimates the group—specific conditional dependencies by decomposing them into global
and group—specific components. The delineation of these components allows for a more refined
picture of the major driver and passenger events in the elucidation of cancer progression and
development.

Results: Simulation studies demonstrate that DINGO provides more accurate group—specific condi—
tional dependencies than achieved by using separate estimation approaches. We apply DINGO to
key signaling pathways in glioblastoma to build differential networks for long—term survivors and
short—term survivors in The Cancer Genome Atlas. The hub genes found by mRNA expression,
DNA copy number, methylation and microRNA expression reveal several important roles in glio—
blastoma progression.

1 Introduction

Complex biological processes, such as the development and progres- disease development and progression.

 

developing and understanding the biological mechanisms behind

sion of cancer, often involve the interaction of genomic and epigen—
etic factors with environmental factors (Cao et 61]., 2011; Schadt,
2009). Research has shown that genes can promote or inhibit tumor
development within coordinating modules such as functional or cell
signaling pathways (Boehm and Hahn, 2011). These genes and their
corresponding pathways form networks that regulate various cellu—
lar functions. Thus, the construction and exploration of the top—
ology of such networks and their constituents is of great interest for

It is well—established that sub—networks within functional regula-
tory networks of genes and their products undergo changes in re—
sponse to different conditions, such as cellular DNA damage or
environmental stress. (Bandyopadhyay et 61]., 2010; Califano, 2011;
Luscombe et 61]., 2004). Analytic approaches for evaluating the regu—
lation of such networks have sought to determine how specific genes
and pathways operate in the promotion or inhibition of human dis-
ease (Goeman and Buhlmann, 2007; Khatri et al., 2012;

Mitrea et al., 2013; Rhinn et al., 2013; Tarca et al., 2009; Tavazoie
et al., 1999; Taylor et al., 2009). For example, a hub gene within a
regulatory network is a gene that acts to influence the activity of a
large number of genes or transcription factors (Flintoft, 2004).
Thus, it is of interest to analyze the activity or expression of a hub
gene during different stages of disease. While differential gene ex—
pression analysis evaluates the changes in the expression of the hub
gene under different conditions or states, the incorporation of a net—
work structure extends the differential gene expression analysis to
differential network analysis (de la Fuente, 2010), which is one of
the primary aims of this article.

Figure 1 displays an example of the differential network analysis
of data from two groups (e.g. of patients) that represent two differ—
ent disease states. Each letter (vertex) represents a gene or any of its
products (e.g. expression, methylation, copy number or transcrip-
tion factor), and each line (edge) represents the co—expression in the
network. In the group—specific networks (left panels), the edge colors
and widths represent the signs and strengths of co—expression quan—
tities. A differential network between group 1 and group 2 (right
panel) is constructed by edge—wise subtraction of the co—expression
quantities in the group—specific networks. In the differential net-
work, the edge colors represent the signs of the differences and the
edge widths are proportional to the strengths of the differences. This
approach to network analysis allows us to discover some less obvi—
ous network relations that are not identified in the group—specific
networks. At the same time, it will allow us to discard the relations
that do not differentiate one disease state of interest from another
(e.g. group 1 from group 2 in Fig. 1) (Ideker and Krogan, 2012;
Mitra et al., 2013).

Most of the methods for differential network analysis rely on dif-
ferent correlation—based metrics to measure the strength of associ—
ation between pairs of vertices in a network. Broadly, there are three
main approaches for comparing group-specific networks in differen-
tial network analysis. The first approach obtains sparse group—
specific networks and compares the network topologies, such as de—
grees of vertices or modularities between groups (Reverter et al.,
2006; Zhang et al., 2009). The second approach handles weighted
group—specific networks and uses some functions of the edge—specific
weight differences as the edge weights to construct differential net—
works (Hudson et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2010; Rhinn et al., 2013;
Tesson et al., 2010). Instead of relying on edge—wise co—expression
differences, the last approach focuses more on finding gene sets
and identifying which correlation patterns differ between groups.
This approach formulates summary measures that represent

the strengths between the two group-specific networks

co—expressions within a set of genes and compares the quantities be—
tween groups (Rahmatallah et al., 2014; Watson, 2006).

Although the above approaches have been useful in addressing
important biological questions, the existing methods for analyzing
differential networks are limited to correlation networks (i.e. two
genes at a time). Also, the group—specific correlations are estimated
separately using observations within each group. In this article, we
obtain more refined, undirected relations than those based on correl—
ation networks by estimating conditional dependencies between two
genes after removing the effects of all other genes. This results in the
construction of an undirected graph of conditional dependencies
that is sparser than a correlation network (Markowetz and Spang,
2007). More importantly, the separate estimations are performed
without due consideration of the global relationships that are pre—
served for all groups, i.e. are invariant to group specifications. For
example, in our motivating example, we consider gene regulatory
networks constructed using different modalities of genomic data
(mRNA expression, DNA copy number, methylation status and
microRNA expression). We are interested in determining how the
network connectivity changes for patients with glioblastoma who
experience different survival times, long—term and short—term sur—
vival times. Our hypothesis is that some conditional dependencies
are shared across the groups and can be thought of as ‘passenger’
events and other conditional dependencies are unique to the groups
and thus can be ‘driver’ events that change with cancer progression.
The delineation of these components allows for a more refined pic—
ture of the major events (driver and/or passenger) in the elucidation
of cancer progression and development.

To this end, we propose a differential network analysis in gen-
omics (DINGO) framework, wherein we decompose the conditional
dependencies among the genes/variables into a global component
and a ‘local’ group-specific component and jointly estimate
the group—specific conditional dependencies after adjusting for the
global conditional dependencies. With the DINGO model, the di—
mension of the parameters is greatly reduced compared with that in
separate estimations. In addition, we provide techniques for con—
ducting rigorous statistical inference on the differential networks
based on bootstrap procedures for assessing the differences in the
group—specific conditional dependencies.

This article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce
the DINGO model and the estimation approach for calculating the
group—specific networks and bootstrap thresholding to determine
the significant differential edges. In Section 3, we apply our method
to data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) glioblast—
oma study. We estimate differential networks for genes in glioblast-
oma cell signaling pathways, comparing data from long-term
survivors (LTSs) and short—term survivors (STSs) using data from
multiple platforms. In Section 4, we evaluate the DINGO method
and compare it with other estimation approaches via simulations
under different settings. We provide a summary and discussion in
Section 5. In the Supplementary Materials, we present the technical
details, additional results from the application of DINGO to TCGA
glioblastoma data and additional simulation results.

2 DINGO model

We develop an approach called differential network analysis in gen-
omics (DINGO) to infer differential patterns of network activation
between patient—specific groups. Suppose we observe gene—level ac—
tivity (such as mRNA, methylation or copy number) for p genes
(denoted by y) measured over a patient. Furthermore, we have

group-level information regarding whether a given patient belongs
(generically) to group 1 or 2 (denoted by x = 0 or 1). Our aim is to
construct a p—dimensional group—specific network, N(x), that repre—
sents the relationship among the p genes belonging to a pathway
and that has the following two components:

° A ’global’ component, g representing the relations that are com—
mon to both groups.

° A ‘local’ group—speciﬁc component, £(x), that represents the dif—
ferential unique relations in each group depending on the value
of x.

This decomposition serves a bi—fold objective. First, it explicitly
allows for the delineation of specific network components that are
conserved as well as changed across the groups, which allows for
refined interpretations of differential networks. Second, as we show
hereafter, it admits a natural dimension reduction technique that
allows it to scale to moderate—to—large networks. Our model con—
struction as detailed in Section 2.1 is in a general setting that in-
cludes multiple covariates and multi—categorical covariates (more
than two groups) or continuous covariates. For ease of exposition,
our illustrative examples focus on the case where we observe two—
group membership data. In Section 2.2, the estimation methods are
described under this setting and a differential network between the
two groups is constructed by an inference procedure on the differ-
ences of the dependencies between the two groups. Supplementary
Table 88 lists the notations that describes the various types of struc—
ture and provides definitions of all the model constructs.

2.1 Model construction

We denote the p genes by a p—dimensional vector y E RP . The condi-
tional dependencies among p genes constitute an undirected graph,
modeled via a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) for a set of vertices
V : {1, ... ,p} and a set of edges E E V X V, such that any edge be—
tween a E V and b E V belongs to E if and only if genes a and b are
conditionally dependent, given all other genes, V \ {a, b}. We as—
sume that y N Np(0,N) where N = [Nabjpxp is a positive definite
precision matrix of y and Nab 74 0 if and only if (a, b) E E
(Lauritzen, 1996). In this article, we call the precision matrix N a
GGM of the p genes. Suppose additionally we observe a q x 1 vector
of covariates X E Rq. Our goal is to provide a model and estimation
method for the conditional GGM of y given X, N

Global component, g

The global component represents the relations among p genes when
there are no covariate effects. For example, using the example of the
glioblastoma dataset, the global gene expression network describes
the co—expression patterns for patients with glioblastoma, regardless
of their survival times. To estimate the local group—specific compo—
nent, the global component is adjusted before the covariate is intro—
duced in the model.

We introduce a global network model,

y=gy+8,

where a p X p coefficient matrix Q = [gabjpxp Specifies global rela—
tions among variables in V, 8 is a p X 1 vector following Np(0, L)
where L is the ‘local’ GGM, the elements of which specify relations
among genes in V after taking out the effects of the global relations.
The local GGM can be expressed as a function of the GGM of y, N
and the global component, g, L = (I — g)_TN(I — g)‘1.

Local group-specific component, £(X)

For the local group—specific component, we model the local GGM L
with the q x 1 covariate vector X. For a residual vector 8 E RP, we
introduce the inverse of the local GGM (covariance of 8), 5—1 as a
function of X,

c(x)—1 = Cov(8|X)
= QXXTQT + ‘1',

where Q : [Qabjpxq is a p X q coefficient matrix, which is the main
construction of interest and ‘1’ : diagwl, . . . ,pp), with
(01 > 0,  ,va > 0, is a p x p diagonal matrix whose elements,
1,01, . . . ,pp, represent variances for pure noise in y. The covariance
function £(X)_1 is positive definite for all values of X. This model de—
composes £(X)_1 to a rank 1 p X p matrix that depends on covari—
ates X and variances of pure noise. By constraining ‘I’ to be a
diagonal matrix, the elements in 8 are conditionally independent
given the values of covariates X. In essence, we represent the residual
vector 8 by a latent factor model with covariates X (Tipping and
Bishop, 1999). The covariance regression model (Hoff and Niu,
2012) decomposes the covariance matrix N_1 into two components:
a covariance explained by the covariates and the global covariance.
Because the model of Hoff and Niu (2012) is based on the covari—
ance matrix of y, N_1, the non-zero off-diagonal elements of ‘1’ rep—
resent the global relations, which are independent of X.

For a square matrix, tr(-) is defined by the trace. The group—
specific precision matrix function, £(X), with a q x 1 covariate vec—
tor X, is

1

—1 T T —1
—TK(X)‘I’ QXXQ‘I’ , (1)

£(X) : ‘1’—1
where  : tr(QXXTQT‘I’_1) (Miller, 1981). This is the precision
regression model as opposed to the covariance regression model.
With a focus on precision matrix modeling in the DINGO model,
we decompose the residual precision matrix into a full rank diagonal
matrix that is independent of X and a rank 1 matrix that determines
the off—diagonal intensities of the precision matrices depending on X.
The precision regression modeling greatly reduces the number of
parameters to be used in estimating the group—specific networks.
When we observe two—group membership data, DINGO involves 2p
parameters for Q and p parameters for ‘I’, while a separate estima—
tion needs p X (p — 1) parameters. When the number of groups in—
creases, DINGO needs p additional parameters, while a separate
estimation needs p(p — 1) / 2 additional parameters. We exploit this
fact in our computations involving multiple molecular networks in
Section 3.

Concisely stated, the conditional GGM of y given X is obtained
by the convolution,

N(X) = 9% £(X),

T (2)
= (I — 9) £000 — 9),

where g is the global component and £(X) is the local group—specific
component related to X, which is specified by parameters Q and ‘I’
in the precision regression model (1).

2.2 Joint estimation

In this section, we provide an overview and illustration of our ap—
proach in the context of TCGA glioblastoma data described in detail
in Section 3. We consider how the gene networks in the cell signaling
pathways differ between LTSs and STSs. The conditional GGM of y
given X, N provides group—specific GGMs for LTSs and STSs.

Based on the group—specific GGMs, we build a differential network
between LTSs and STSs. In this section, the estimation method for
the group—specific GGMs and the differential network are described
under the two—group setting. A more detailed description of the tech—
nical aspects of our DINGO model and estimation, along with a
simplified example and R code, are provided in Supplementary
Sections 81 and S6, respectively.

Suppose that we have n patients. We denote the n X p data ma—
trix as Y : (yl, . . . ,yn)T, where y,- represents the ith row of Y and
includes expressions of p genes for the patient i. Each row is inde—
pendently and identically following a p—dimensional multivariate
normal distribution with a positive definite precision matrix (GGM)
N, Np(0,N) for all i = 1,  ,n. The n x 2 (c122) design matrix X
: (X1, . . . ,X,,)T includes group information for LTSs and STSs with
an intercept term. We assume that X,- = (1, 1)T for i in the LTSs and
X,- : (1, —1)T for i in the STSs. Using gene—level data (Y) and the de—
sign matrix indicating LTSs and STSs (X), the detailed DINGO algo—
rithm and its workflow are displayed in Figure 2. As an output, the
DINGO algorithm provides p(p — 1) / 2 differential scores for all
links among the p genes.

2.2.1 Step 1 (estimation of global component, g)

The global component g is obtained by the GGM N. The log likeli-
hood ofN is proportional to l(N) : logINI — tr(SN) where S : YT
Y/ n is the sample covariance matrix. When n 2 p, S is positive defin—
ite and 5—1 is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of N. Because
the MLE assumes no zero restriction on the elements of N, it is a satu—
rated model estimation (Lauritzen, 1996). This approach fails when
p > n and requires n to be much larger than p. Many methods for
determining the penalized MLE of N have been proposed (Banerjee et
al., 2008; Fan et al., 2009; Friedman et al., 2008; Rothman et al.,
2008; Yuan and Lin, 2007). One of the most widely used methods is
the graphical Lasso (GLasso) method (Friedman et al., 2008), which
maximizes the following penalized log likelihood:

1(9) =10g|N| — tr(SN) — n2 Wait, (3)

a,b

where n is a tuning parameter. As the tuning parameter 17 increases,
more zero values in N are induced. From the estimate of N, all
elements of g are estimated by using g,,, = —Nab/Naa for all
a 74 b E V and gag = 0 for all a E V (Lauritzen, 1996). The sparse
estimation of GGM N provides a sparse estimate of the global com—
ponent g, in that there exist zero off—diagonal elements in Q. We use

the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to select the tuning param—
eter (Yuan and Lin, 2007).

2.2.2 Step 2 (estimation of local group-specific component, £(X))
Suppose the global component g is known. For the n X p data ma-
trix Y, we transform the data matrix to 5 : Y(I — QT), which is the
residual data matrix after taking out the effects of global relations in
Q. We assume each column of 5 is standardized to have a mean of 0
and a standard deviation of 1. £(X) for X : (1,1)T and X : (1, —1)T
in model (1) determine the dependencies in the LTSs and STSs, re—
spectively. The EM algorithm (Hoff and Niu, 2012) provides esti—
mates of Q and ‘1’. Applying the estimates of Q and ‘I’ to the
precision regression model in Equation (1) provides the local group—
specific component  The explicit expressions of the elements of
£(X) are displayed in Supplementary Section 81.2.

2.2.3 Step 3 (differential scores for group-specific edges)

Through the above steps, we obtain estimates of the global component
g and the local group—specific components  The application of the
estimates of g and £(X) to the convolution operator in Equation (2)
provides the group—specific GGMs, N when X : (1, 1)T and
X : (1, —1)T for LTSs and STSs, respectively. We then construct a dif—
ferential network by thresholding a scaled difference in the conditional
dependencies between two groups for each edge (a pair of vertices).
The corresponding sets of p(p — 1) / 2 partial correlations for the
LTSs and STSs are denoted by {p22 :a,b E Vanda < b} and
{p55} : a, b E Vanda < b}, respectively. For an edge between genes a
and b, we hypothesize that two conditional dependencies corresponding
to a pair of genes a and b are the same:
H0 : pg?) : pi?vs.HA : pi? 74 p55,). We construct a differential score as

Differential Score: 5222) = “9—, (4)
ab

where $2,) and $53,) are Fisher’s Z transformation of the estimates of
pi) and p53,), respectively, and 55b is the bootstrap estimate of the
standard error obtained from Supplementary Section 81.4. The dif-
ferential scores 52:2) for all a < b can then be used to determine the
edges in the differential network. The presence or absence of edges
in the differential networks is determined by the differential scores
in Equation (4): an edge (a, b) is present in a differential network
if |5£| > la with la is a cutoff. The default la is 2 since it can be
treated as a Wald—type statistic using a bootstrap estimate of the
standard error. We classify the edges with 02%| > la into two types,

cies between the LTSs and STSs, as defined below.

° Conserved edges: an edge between genes a and b is deﬁned as
conserved if the dependencies between genes a and b have the
same directions (i.e. positive or negative dependencies) for both
groups, implying similar behavior. We deﬁne ‘conserved’ signs if
(pi? > 0 and pi? > 0) or (pi? < 0 and pi? < 0).

° Differential edges: an edge is differential if the dependencies have
different directions (i.e. positive (negative) dependency in a
group and negative (positive) dependency in another group).
This is evaluated as (pii) > 0 and pi? < 0) or (pii) > 0 and

3 TCGA glioblastoma application
3.1 Dataset

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain
tumor of adults. The median survival time of patients diagnosed
with GBM is approximately 1 year, which places GBM among the
most lethal of all cancers (McLendon et al., 2008; Mischel and
Cloughesy, 2003). TCGA glioblastoma study includes 233 patients,
along with their matched transcriptomic (mRNA), genomic (DNA
copy number), epigenomic (methylation) and microRNA data. In
this article, we take a pathway—based approach. We have focused
our attention on specific pathways associated with GBM biology to
investigate how the interactions between genes in a given pathway
are activated and inhibited in the two sub—groups of patients: LTSs
and STSs. This allows for more refined biological interpretations, es—
pecially for practitioners who tend to think in terms of pathway—
based disruptions involved with disease progression for potential
downstream clinical use. We present our analysis of genes that over—
lap with the three critical signaling pathways: RTIQPI3K, p53 and
Rb signaling pathways that are involved in cell migration, survival
and apoptosis (Furnari et al., 2007). The genes involved in those
pathways are obtained from http://cbio.mskcc.org/cancergenomics/
gbm/pathways and listed in Supplementary Section $22. In
Supplementary Section S2.3, we describe a more comprehensive
analysis involving multiple pathways from three established path—
way databases: KEGG, BIOCARTA and REACTOME. It is our hy-
pothesis that a better understanding of the interactions between the
molecular data for these core pathways will provide new insights
into the progression of GBM (Verhaak et al., 2010).

To define our patient groups, we partitioned the patients into
two groups on the basis of their survival times, taking the top 45%
(83 patients, surviving > 407 days) as LTSs and the bottom 45 % (73
patients, surviving < 341 days) as STSs using an extreme discordant
phenotype design (Nebert, 2000). Detailed information on this par-
titioning is described in Supplementary Section $21. We analyzed
four different platforms to identify differential networks with re—
spect to the LTSs and STSs. We downloaded data from TCGA por—
tal for analysis, which included mRNA, DNA copy number,
methylation and microRNA data generated from the Affymetrix HT
Human Genome U133 Array Plate Set, Agilent Human Genome
CGH Microarray 244A, Illumina Infinium Human DNA
Methylation 27 and Agilent 8 x 15 K Human miRNA-specific
microarrays, respectively. For DNA copy number and methylation

data, we took the first principal components for several sites that
correspond to a gene in the GBM pathways. For microRNA data,
we took only human microRNAs. The number of vertices (p) con—
sisted of 49 genes for mRNA, 51 for copy number, 50 for methyla-
tion and 470 for microRNA. A more detailed description of the
datasets and pre—processing steps is provided in Supplementary
Section S22.

3.2 DINGO application

Applying our DINGO method, we obtain differential scores for all
pairs of genes. The resulting differential networks with |5ii| > 2
from mRNA expression, DNA copy number and methylation are
displayed in Figure 3. The differential network for microRNA ex-
pression is displayed in Supplementary Figure S15 for |512| > 3.5.
The corresponding list of hub genes that have degrees greater than 4
in the differential networks is presented in Table 1.

3.2.1 Biological interpretations

codes a transcription factor, c-Myc (Dang et al., 2009). The factor
c-Myc has a central role in regulating the proliferation and survival
of glioblastoma stem cells (Wang et al., 2008). For the indirect effects
of the c-Myc gene, our data did not explicitly include the c-Myc gene;
rather we found that most of the hub genes detected using our meth—
ods had c-Myc connections [Fig. 7F in Masui et al. (2013)]. PDPK1
had the highest degree in the network from DNA copy number data.
Velpula et al. (2013) established PDPKI as a key driver and candi-
date therapeutic target in GBM. Moreover, their study indicated that
PDPK1 may promote EGFR activation, which results in malignant
progression in GBM: we found an edge between PDPK1 and EGFR
(Fig. 3b). EGFR activates PI3K and mTORCZ genes (Masui et al.,
2013; McLendon et al., 2008). PI3K genes (PIK3CD, PIK3CB,
PIK3 CZA and PIK3 CG) are present in all the differential networks
from mRNA expression, DNA copy number and methylation.
PIK3 CA and PIK3 CZA, which are PI3K genes, had strong differen—
tial relation in the methylation network (Fig. 3c). The PI3K pathway
is frequently dysregulated in GBM and a promising therapeutic target
for the disease (Wen et al., 2012). Both PI3K and mTORCZ, which
are regulated by EGFR, independently inhibit FOX 0 activity, which
is associated with c-Myc levels (Masui et al., 2013). The network
from methylation data shows that the FOX 01A gene had the highest
degree (Fig. 3c and Table 1). The gene had connection to MLLT7
(FOX 0) and PIK3 CA (PI3K). The regulatory networks that include
mTORCZ, FOX 0 and c-Myc are highly intercorrelated with shorter
survival of GBM patients (Masui et al., 2013). For assessing the dir—
ect effects of the c-Myc gene, the comprehensive analysis of pathways
in KEGG, BIOCARTA and REACTOME (Supplementary Section
S2.3) included the M YC gene, and the differential networks for
neighbors of the M YC gene are shown in Supplementary Figure S3.
Table 1 shows that hsa—miR—103 and hsa—miR—107 have the highest
degrees. CDK5 is overexpressed and plays an important role in glio-
blastoma (Liu et al., 2008). The hubs, hsa—miR—103 and hsa-miR-
107, regulate CDK5R1, which is a specific activator of CDK5
(Moncini et al., 2011).

3.2.2 Role of hub genes

We evaluated the effects of these hub genes on GBM progression. We
took the top hub genes and assessed their direct effects on the patient
survival times. We fitted univariate Cox—proportional hazards models
for survival times with the hub genes as covariates/predictors.
We found that FOX 03A (through DNA copy number changes),

4 Simulation studies

To evaluate the accuracy and operating characteristics of the
DINGO model, we conducted several simulation studies. In Case I
of our simulation study, we generated the data by setting the param—
eters in the DINGO model (such as g, Q and ‘1’). In Case II
(Supplementary Section S3.2), the group—specific data are generated
from two separate GGMs. In this section, we display the results of
Case I. We compared the performance of our method with those of
a variety of separate estimation methods. As a basic method for esti—
mating the precision matrix, we chose maximum likelihood estima—
tion (MLE), which offers desirable statistical properties. However, it
is invalid when the sample size is less than the number of variables.
For high-dimensional settings (n < p), we use GLasso because the L1
penalized MLE performs well in detecting hub genes regardless of
the dimension of the data (Allen et al., 2012). We assumed a sample
size of 150 (n), with 75 samples in each of the two groups. In each
of the datasets corresponding to the groups, we applied MLE and
GLasso and compared their performance with the estimation from
DINGO. For the fixed sample size, we considered two simulation
settings, n > p and n < p.

Simulation setting, n> p

We simulate datasets that reﬂect the mRNA expression data studied
in the application data example in Section 3, which includes 49 genes
in the pathways (p :49). The global component, g : {gab}4,x49, is
determined by the GBM pathways used in Section 3. We consider
the four different simulation settings described in Supplementary
Section S3.1 according to the effect sizes Q and noise level specified
by the diagonal elements of ‘1’.

Simulation setting, n< p

With p = 100 and 500, we determine the structure of g by generat—
ing a scale—free network using the Barabasi—Albert algorithm
(Barabasi and Albert, 1999). The scale—free networks are likely to be
organized into hub genes with many edges. A hub gene within a
regulatory network is a gene that acts to influence the activity of a
large number of genes or transcription factors (Flintoft, 2004). We
specified Q and ‘I’ as the high effect, high noise setting (A4) in
Supplementary Section S3.1.

For each replication, we generate the true group—specific condi—
tional dependencies and the data, and we base the results on 100
replications. We examine the sum of squared error (SSE), the re—
ceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the precision recall
(PR) curves, which are defined in Supplementary Section S3.1.
Figure 4 displays the boxplots of log(SSE), ROC curves and PR
curves for the MLE, GLasso and DINGO methods under the setting,
n> p and (A4). We combined the log(SSE) from both groups in a
boxplot for each method and the ROC and PR curves are averaged
over 100 replications and groups. Our method provides more accur—
ate estimates of the conditional dependencies than the MLE and

GLasso methods (Fig. 4a). The ROC curve and the PR curve for our
method uniformly dominate those for the MLE and GLasso meth—
ods (Fig. 4b and c). Supplementary Figures S11—S14 separately dis—
play the results for n > p settings from both groups. When the effect
size is high and the noise level is low, we observe that the GLasso
method performs better than the DINGO method for the group 2
network because the simulation data for the two groups are well
separated (Supplementary Fig. S13). We compare GLasso and
DINGO for the setting when p > n. Figure 5a and b displays box—
plots of log(SSE) from 100 replications for p = 100 and 500. For
p = 100, GLasso uses 75 samples for the separate estimation, while
DINGO uses all 150 observations for our joint estimation. Thus, the
performances of GLasso and DINGO differed most for p=100.
When p = 500, DINGO provided more accurate estimates than
GLasso. Overall, DINGO performed better than MLE and GLasso
when the noise level was high compared to the effect size, and
DINGO consistently performed better than GLasso as p increased.

5 Discussion

We propose a joint modeling approach, DINGO, for estimating dif-
ferential networks in various genomic data in the presence of group
information. DINGO estimates separate conditional dependencies
for each group and allows for global dependencies; thus, it borrows
strength more efficiently between groups. We applied our DINGO
method to TCGA glioblastoma data from four platforms, mRNA
expression, DNA copy number, methylation and microRNA expres-
sion and we found hub genes based on the differential networks,
many of which were in the regulatory network related to the c—Myc
gene that contributes to the regulation of GBM proliferation and
shorter survival times in GBM patients.

While pathways used in our analysis (Section 3) have been impli—
cated in GBM in prior studies, the exact nature of the pathway com—
ponents has not been studied with respect to differential patterns of

activation/inactivation related to the patient prognostic groups. Our
re—analysis focuses on the exact pathway breakages using data from
multiple platforms, which sheds a completely different light on the
various biological processes involved in GBM progression. The es—
tablished pathways include up to 600 genes (Supplementary Fig.
S17). For 50 and 600 genes, Steps 1 and 2 of DINGO take around
20s and 57min, respectively, which makes it feasible to conduct
pathway—based differential network analysis. A more detailed dis—
cussion of the computation time is provided in Supplementary
Section S7.

Although our DINGO method was applied to a two—group set—
ting, the model can be generalized to incorporate multiple categories
(such as multiple stages of disease and multiple subtypes) as well as
continuous covariates (such as age and time). For three groups with
an intercept term, we can apply X : (1, —1, —1)T, X : (1, 1, 0)T and
X : (1,0, 1)T for group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively, in the
Equation (1). We can also add age as a continuous covariate by
defining the covariate vectors X : (1,1,age,-)T for i in LTSs and
X : (1, —1,age,-)T for i in STSs. This would require additional gener—
alizations of our estimation and computational algorithms; tasks
that we leave for future consideration.

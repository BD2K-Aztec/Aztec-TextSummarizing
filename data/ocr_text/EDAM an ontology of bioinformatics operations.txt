ABSTRACT

Motivation: Advancing the search, publication and integration of bio-
informatics tools and resources demands consistent machine-under-
standable descriptions. A comprehensive ontology allowing such
descriptions is therefore required.

Results: EDAM is an ontology of bioinformatics operations (tool or
workflow functions), types of data and identifiers, application domains
and data formats. EDAM supports semantic annotation of diverse
entities such as Web services, databases, programmatic libraries,
standalone tools, interactive applications, data schemas, datasets
and publications within bioinformatics. EDAM applies to organizing
and finding suitable tools and data and to automating their integration
into complex applications or workflows. It includes over 2200 defined
concepts and has successfully been used for annotations and
implementations.

Availability: The latest stable version of EDAM is available in OWL
format from http://edamontology.org/EDAM.owl and in 080 format
from http://edamontology.org/EDAM.obo. It can be viewed online at
the NCBO BioPortal and the EBI Ontology Lookup Service. For docu-
mentation and license please refer to http://edamontology.org. This
article describes version 1.2 available at http://edamontology.org/

1 INTRODUCTION

The number and diversity of bioinformatics tools, including data
resources, grows vastly. To aid users in ﬁnding, comparing, se-
lecting and integrating tools into workﬂows or workbenches, it is
important having the tools consistently described with respect to
a number of categories. These include their application domain
(e.g. protein structure, metagenomics), function (e.g. alignment
construction), type of input and output data (e.g. accession, fea-
ture record) and available formats of the data (e. g. FASTQ, PDB
format). In the absence of accepted standards for such tool de-
scriptions, the categorization of tools has been left to providers
of tool catalogues or workbenches. In this undesired situation,
tools have to be described again every time they are integrated

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

into a new framework. Not only duplicating efforts, this also
leads to fragmented descriptions and inconsistent categorization.

We present EDAM, an ontology of bioinformatics operations,
types of data and identiﬁers, data formats and topics. Its name
originates from ‘EMBRACE Data And Methods’, as it was
initiated by the EMBRACE project (Pettifer et al., 2010). Its
primary goal is as a means of creating coherent, machine-under-
standable annotations for use within resource catalogues [such as
BioCatalogue (Bhagat et al., 2010) or myExperiment (Goble et
al., 2010)], information standards (such as BioDBCore, Gaudet
et al., 2011), Web services (http://www.w3.org/standards/webof
services), collaborative infrastructures (such as Elixir, http://
www.elixir-europe.org), tool collections [e.g. Bio-Linux (Field
at al., 2006) and Debian Med (Moller et al., 2010)] and integrated
workbenches (e.g. Galaxy, Goecks et al., 2010). EDAM is also
intended to complement standards for data exchange, enrich
provenance metadata, offer a shared markup vocabulary for bio-
informatics data on the Semantic Web and aid text mining by
deﬁning interrelated terms and synonyms. In addition, EDAM
must be conveniently usable by annotators and tool users ran-
ging from programmers to lab biologists.

To ensure good coverage of common concepts, numerous
tools and databases have been semantically annotated with
EDAM. Functionality that makes use of EDAM annotations
has been implemented in a set of representative frameworks: a
suite of bioinformatics tools (EMBOSS, Rice et al., 2000), an
integrated workbench for data sharing and analysis (eSysbio,
http://esysbio.org), and a workﬂow system (Bio-jETI,
Lamprecht et al., 2011), thus testing the usability of EDAM.

1.1 Related work within bioinformatics

The ﬁeld of data and resource integration within bioinformatics
has received signiﬁcant attention over the past decade, with stan-
dardization efforts falling into three categories: information
standards, data models and ontologies.

Information standards such as those uniﬁed under MIBBI
(Minimum Information about a Biomedical or Biological Inves-
tigation, Taylor et al., 2008) deﬁne what information should be
recorded when reporting scientiﬁc experiments. For example,
MIGS (Minimum Information about a Genome Sequence) and
related MIxS standards require speciﬁc metadata for genomic
sequences (Field at al., 2008; Yilmaz et al., 2011).

Data models, schemas or exchange formats deﬁne structures
for data representation and enable convenient sharing between
tools. Various data models have been developed, ranging from
speciﬁc textual or binary formats (e.g. SAM and BAM, Li et al.,
2009) to formal machine-understandable schemas. XML
Schema-based approaches include BioXSD for basic types of
data in bioinformatics (Kalas et al., 2010), and more specialized
formats such as phyloXML and NeXML for phylogenetics (Han
and Zmasek, 2009; Vos et al., 2011) or GCDML for MIGS-
compliant metadata (Kottmann et al., 2008). Alternatively,
data models can be deﬁned using an ontology language, as exem-
pliﬁed by the BioMoby Object Ontology deﬁning XML
exchange formats within the BioMoby framework (Wilkinson
et al., 2008), and the BioPAX exchange format for pathway
data (Demir et al., 2010).

Ontologies can be used to deﬁne data models, but more com-
monly they deﬁne collections of interrelated items. These range
from informal lists such as those used to categorize the articles in
journals, through Nucleic Acids Research’s hierarchies of data-
base and Web-server categories (Benson, 2011; Galperin and
Fernandez-Suarez, 2012), to formal ontologies establishing
commonly understood meaning and relations of subjects in
focus. Examples are the widely used Gene Ontology (GO) of
biological processes, molecular functions and cellular compo-
nents (Ashburner et al., 2000), the Sequence Ontology (S0) of
nucleic acid and protein features (Eilbeck et al., 2005) or the
Comparative Data Analysis Ontology (CDAO) for phylogen-
etics (Prosdocimi et al., 2009).

The myGrid ontology (\Nolstencroft et al., 2007) was de-
veloped for annotating bioinformatics tools with their types of
interface, operations, types of input/output data and formats. In
addition, it listed some concrete algorithms, databases, types of
database records and identiﬁers. The myGrid ontology is no
longer maintained, but it served as a starting point for the de-
velopment of EDAM.

1.2 Other related work

Several projects outside the life sciences are relevant to the ob-
jectives of this work. DOAP (Description Of A Project, https://
github.com/edumbill/doap/wiki) is a vocabulary of domain-
agnostic metadata attributes of a software project, such as its
programming language, operating system, developer or home-
page. The standard Semantic Web vocabularies such as RDFS
(http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf—schema) and Dublin Core (http://
dublincore.org) include basic types of data for describing digital
artefacts, e. g. label, comment or identiﬁer. OWL-S (Martin et al.,
2004) and WSMO (Roman et al., 2005) ontologies aim at
enabling automated discovery and composition of Web services,
independent of an application domain. Several efforts have de-
veloped for preservation of information and digital media
(including software), for example the ISO OAIS Reference
Model (ISO, 2002), the PRONOM ﬁle-format registry and asso-
ciated tools (Brody et al., 2007) and the PREMIS metadata
model, vocabulary and format (Dappert and Enders, 2010).
The Wf4Ever project focusses on preservation of scientiﬁc work-
ﬂows (http://wf4ever-project.org).

Ontologies for describing data-mining experiments such as
DMOP (http://www.dmo-foundry.org/DMOP) include methods

and parameters used in data mining, both within and outside of
life sciences. OntoDT (http://kt.ijs.si/panovp/doku.php?id=
ontodt) comprises programming datatypes and data structures.
Some ontologies have been developed to comprehensively enu-
merate diverse domain-unspeciﬁc entities. Notable among these
are Cyc (Lenat, 1995) and the Suggested Upper Merged
Ontology (SUMO, Niles and Pease, 2001).

1.3 Scope for EDAM

In spite of the breadth and diversity of the existing ontologies,
none provides a comprehensive means of classifying bioinfor-
matics operations, types of data and identiﬁers, data formats
and topics in a way that is suitable for large-scale semantic
annotations and categorization of bioinformatics resources.
Among previous ontology projects within bioinformatics, the
myGrid ontology had the most similar scope, but is no longer
maintained. On the other hand, multiple vocabularies outside of
life sciences aim at describing tools and data resources, but they
do not include the necessary bioinformatics-speciﬁc concepts.
EDAM was developed to ﬁll this niche.

The rest of the article is organized as follows: the Methods
section describes the main design principles used in EDAM.
Results describe EDAM, the annotations with EDAM and the
implementation projects that adopted EDAM. Conclusion sum-
marizes the article.

2 METHODS

The main design principles of EDAM are relevance to its target applica-
tions, convenient usability for annotators and users of the annotations
and efﬁcient maintainability by its developers.

To ensure relevance, EDAM has to comprehensively cover the
common bioinformatics concepts. To achieve this, numerous resources
were analysed and used as sources of concepts. The myGrid ontology
served as a starting point. Collections of tools were analysed, including
Web services from the EMBRACE registry (Pettifer et al., 2009), the
EMBOSS suite and the BioMoby Service Ontology. Common bioinfor-
matics data formats and the BioMoby Object Ontology served as sources
of types of data and formats. The Nucleic Acids Research’s database and
Web-server catalogues, as well as classiﬁcations within bioinformatics
journals and conferences were used as sources of topics. Semantic anno-
tations with EDAM and the implementations using EDAM, done in
parallel with the EDAM development, provided valuable feedback.

Heuristics for ensuring that EDAM remains broadly applicable in-
clude logical consistency, clear semantic scope, well-deﬁned interfaces
with other ontologies and being open to future developments in collab-
oration with the community.

EDAM has to be conveniently usable by humans for the purposes of
annotation and search. We have therefore avoided excessively broad or
deep branches and have orientated the ontology around the small number
of ‘orthogonal axes’ (sub-ontologies), each with readily understood
meaning.

To keep EDAM maintainable, agile software development methods are
used. This ensures that changes are delivered with good response time
using limited resources and yielding consistent results. For example, re-
lations between concepts are explicitly deﬁned only in one direction, to
minimize the possibility for inconsistencies and to ease maintenance.

EDAM’s design is not based on any metaphysical doctrine, but that
does not mean that it is based on bad or no philosophy. EDAM is
founded on logic, and on relevance and utility to the bioinformatics com-
munity. This is in accordance with Lord and Stevens (2010), Merrill

(2010, 2011) and thetsky and Evans (2011) that all indicate, using sep-
arate sets of arguments, that it is the relevance of scientiﬁc ontologies with
respect to their practical applications that is more important than an
imposed metaphysical ideology. EDAM concepts are not concepts exist-
ing only in minds of the EDAM authors, but common notions shared
within the bioinformatics community.

EDAM follows the accepted OBO Foundry principles (Open
Biological and Biomedical Ontologies Foundry, http://www.obofoun-
dry.org/wiki/index.php/Category:Accepted, Ashburner et al., 2003). The
scope is clearly focussed and unique. All concepts include deﬁnitions.
These are concise, sufﬁcient to delineate the concepts, but avoiding details
that would be irrelevant to target applications. EDAM syntax and logical
structure has been validated by OWL reasoners in Protege (http://
protegestanfordedu).

EDAM follows to some extent also the candidate OBO Foundry prin-
ciples under discussion (http://www.obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/
CategoryzDiscussion), with a few exceptions owing to the usability, main-
tainability or coherence requirements. For example, terms are capitalized
for aesthetic reasons and faster recognition. In some places, specialization
of multiple generic concepts is logically correct and necessary for usabil-
ity, such as in Structure alignment being both an Alignment and Structure.

Some mostly higher-level concepts are related to generic Semantic Web
vocabularies or to higher-level concepts in specialized ontologies with
different focus than EDAM: e.g. RDFS, Dublin Core, DOAP, DMOP,
BRO (Tenenbaum et al., 2011) or MeSH (Nelson, 2009). This applies also
to ontologies under development: the Semanticscience Integrated
Ontology (SIO, http://code.google.com/p/semanticscience/wiki/SIO),
Web Service Interaction Ontology (WSIO, http://wsio.org) and
SoftWare Ontology (SWO, http://theswo.sourceforgenet). Such concepts
are linked from EDAM. Additionally, in the case of SWO, the bioinfor-
matics-speciﬁc concepts of EDAM are included via OWL import. The
higher-level concepts in EDAM also reference concepts in multiple upper
ontologies: DOLCE (Gangemi et al., 2002), BioTop (Beisswanger et al.,
2008), GFO and GFO-Bio (Hoehndorf et al., 2008), BFO (Grenon et al.,
2004) and SUMO. EDAM may thus be usable in a variety of future
semantic-integration scenarios. In addition, some concepts in EDAM
include links to other scientiﬁc ontologies with different ‘axes’ of meaning
or with more detail. These include SO, CDAO, GO and ChEBI
(Degtyarenko et al., 2008). EDAM relations explicitly reference the rela-
tions deﬁned in the Relation Ontology (Smith et al., 2005), IAO (http://
code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology) and OBI (Smith et al.,
2007). For example, has input points to has_specified_input in OBI and
has topic points to is about in IAO, via links with comments explaining
the differences in meanings.

EDAM has been iteratively developed yielding on average four ver-
sions released per year (in the course of the last 4 years), resulting in the
current version 1.2. Concept URIs and IDs persist between EDAM ver-
sions. The name, deﬁnition, relations and other properties may change;
nonetheless a given URI (ID) will remain fundamentally true to the
original concept. Concepts may be deprecated on the release of a new
version, but they persist, with their original ID and URI. Concept URIs
do not contain a version, so semantic annotations remain valid while
EDAM evolves, without an immediate need for update. Deprecated con-
cepts indicate a replacement (via replaced_by), or one or more suggestions
(via consider). EDAM will continue evolving, but future versions should
not be a fundamental departure from the established scope, principles
and architecture.

3 RESULTS
3.1 The EDAM ontology

EDAM consists of four main sub-ontologies rooted in the top
level of its hierarchy: Operation, Data, Topic and Format (Table l

and Fig. 1). A ﬁfth distinguishable sub-ontology is Identifier
rooted under Data. Operation concepts denote what function a
tool provides or how a piece of data was created. Data concepts
can denote what data a tool consumes and produces, what a
dataset contains or what type of data an attribute is. Focus lies
on the types of data (the content) and not on datatypes (the
runtime representation deﬁned in a programming language).
Identiﬁer sub-ontology comprehensively catalogues the types of
life-scientiﬁc identiﬁers in common use. Topic contains coarse-
grained domains of a wide range of bioinformatics resources.
Finally, Format catalogues the commonly used data formats
used by bioinformatics tools and data.

Twelve types of relations are deﬁned in EDAM (Table 2). Five
of these are maintained explicitly, in addition to the standard
generalization relation is a. All types of relations are applicable
to semantic annotation of relevant entities.

Concepts are identiﬁed by global URIs of the form http://e-
damontology.org/<subontology>_<localId>. The local IDs
have four digits. In the OBO-format version of EDAM, concept
identiﬁers have form EDAM_(subontology):(localId). For ex-
ample, Sequence record is identiﬁed by http://edamontology.
org/data_0849 or EDAM_data30849. Relation types and addi-
tional concept properties are identiﬁed by http://edamontology.
org/<id> or EDAM:(id), such as http://edamontology.org/has_
function and EDAM .‘has function. EDAM URIs follow the
good practices (http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI). They
are stable, easily maintainable, HTTP, dereferenceable, simple
and concise. The concise form of the EDAM URIs is convenient
for annotations and for use on the Semantic Web, and less prone
to typos. Different representations of EDAM are available via
HTTP content negotiation: http://edamontology.org redirects to
http: //edamontology.org/page, http ://edamontology.org/EDAM
.owl, http://edamontology.org/EDAM.obo or http://edamontol—
ogy.org/EDAM.uris, depending on the requested media type.
URIs of single EDAM concepts either redirect to a dedicated
Web page in the NCBO BioPortal, or return a machine-under-
standable representation (full EDAM.0wl is returned in order to
maintain context). A ?format = query can be used as an alterna-
tive to content negotiation.

Concept declarations in EDAM contain a primary label (the
recommended term), synonyms, deﬁnition, relations to other
concepts in EDAM and links to related concepts in other re-
sources. Some concepts have additional information. Regular
expression constrains allowed values of types of identiﬁers
(mostly accessions) and is useful for validation of inputs to
tools. As examples, EMBOSS will in the future use regular ex-
pressions from EDAM to validate identiﬁers before requesting
the corresponding data, and BioXSD will include accession types
generated from EDAM, with the constraining patterns. Example
lists one or more valid examples (among the identiﬁers).
Documentation includes a URL within a Format concept point-
ing to its documentation. Created in states which version of
EDAM a concept was added in. Obsolete since states the version
since which an obsolete concept has been deprecated.

The latest stable version of EDAM can be downloaded in
OWL format from http://edamontology.org/EDAM.owl and in
OBO format from http://edamontology.org/EDAM.obo. OWL
in RDF/XML is the primary format EDAM is maintained in,
while the OBO version lacks some minor details. EDAM can be

browsed online at the NCBO BioPortal (Noy et al., 2009) or
EBI’s Ontology Lookup Service (OLS, Céte et al., 2010).
Programmatic access to EDAM is provided by a suite of tools
in EMBOSS and by the NCBO Web services.

3.2 Semantic annotation with EDAM

There are two main approaches to annotation of tools. (i) Tools
represented by a standardized information artefact can contain
the annotations in these descriptions. This applies to Web ser-
vices with their WSDL ﬁles and to XML Schemas for which
there is a common standard for semantic annotation:
SAWSDL (Kopecky et al., 2007). Within the SADI framework
(Wilkinson et al., 2011), services are described in dedicated RDF
documents using the structure deﬁned in The Moby-myGrid
Service Ontology (http://www.mygrid.org.uk/mygrid-moby-ser-
vice). For scripts represented by their source code, an annotation
format is promisingly emerging (Kallio et al., 2011). Annotations
in standard descriptions of tools are provided and maintained by
providers of the tools, and are independent of context and cata-
logues. Therefore these tools do not need to be annotated again
when integrated into a new framework. (ii) Annotations can be
provided, stored and maintained in dedicated catalogues, in pro-
prietary formats. This option applies to all kinds of resources.

All tools in the EMBOSS toolkit for bioinformatics analyses
(Rice et al., 2000) have their topics, operations, inputs and out-
puts annotated with EDAM. These annotations are present in
each Application Command Deﬁnition (ACD) ﬁle, which de-
scribes a tool’s command-line interface. The ACD ﬁles can be
downloaded as part of the EMBOSS and associated EMBASSY
packages (ftp://emboss.open—bio.org/pub/EMBOSS).

Web services from various providers were annotated with
EDAM, either within the EMBRACE project (Pettifer et al.,
2010) or with help of public workshops and tutorials. These in-
clude, for example, the iHOP Web service (Fernandez et al.,
2007, http://ws.bioinfo.cnio.es/iHOP/#EMBRACE), WSDbfetch
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ws/wsdl/WSDBFetchDoclitServerService.
wsdl) and services provided by the Computational Biology Unit
in Bergen (http://cbu.bioinfo.no/wsdl). Annotations of Web ser-
vices use the simple information model recommended by
EMBRACE and SAWSDL (Fig. 2a). Experience has shown
that using this EDAM-EMBRACE—SAWSDL approach, pro-
viders can annotate their services with minor effort. As more
applications make use of annotations with EDAM, the annota-
tion effort results in better visibility and usability of the provided
tools or resources.

In BioXSD, the XML format of basic bioinformatics types of
data (Kalas et al., 2010), the type deﬁnitions and the data parts
are annotated with Data sub-ontology, using SAWSDL. This
gives BioXSD types interoperable semantics and they can serve
as pre—annotated building blocks for tool interfaces. Naturally,
the complexType-s in BioXSD are in addition annotated as
having format BioX SD. The annotations can be viewed in the
BioXSD Schema (http: //bioxsd.org/BioXSD-l . l .xsd).

DRCAT, the Data Resource CATalogue (http://drcat.source-
forge.net), collates metadata on bioinformatics data resources
including databases, data warehouses, portals and taxonomies.
A DRCAT entry includes information such as resource identi-
ﬁer, name, taxon, URL and, importantly, URL-based queries.
Annotation with EDAM denotes topics of the resources, types of
data provided, query parameters and output formats. DRCAT is
a work in progress but the current version includes 655 entries,
521 query lines and 2147 EDAM annotations. The model of
EDAM annotations in DRCAT is sketched in Figure 2b and
examples can be viewed at http://drcat.sourceforge.net/#3.

SEQanswers portal provides a wiki catalogue of bioinfor-
matics tools, with focus on high-throughput sequencing analysis
(Li et al., 2012, http://seqanswers.com/wiki/Software). Where

Fig. 2. Sketches of information models for semantic annotations with EDAM. (a) A model for annotations of tools corresponding to the SAWSDL
standard (Kopecky et al., 2007). Standardizing an information model of tool metadata is, at least so far, out of scope of EDAM. (b) A similar model for
annotations of data resources, used within DRCAT. Note that a query has always (implicitly) the function of Data retrieval. Deﬁning an information
standard for database metadata is within scope of the BioDBCore initiative (Gaudet et al., 2011)

applicable, the SEQanswers methods and domains are repre-
sented by EDAM concepts (mostly from Operation and Topic).
Input and output formats will be represented by EDAM con-
cepts in the near future. Currently the mapping to EDAM is
done by matching tags to concept labels; however, a complete
manual mapping that includes synonyms has been performed
and will be reﬂected in due course. Use of EDAM within
SEQanswers results in more interoperable descriptions of the
collated tools, and allows searching and ﬁltering by the concepts.

3.3 Implementations using EDAM

In addition to having all its tools annotated, the EMBOSS suite
provides comprehensive tooling for EDAM-driven queries of the
tools and DRCAT (http://emboss.open-bio.org/rel/rel6/apps/
ontology_edam_group.html). This includes ﬁnding data re-
sources by the data or formats served, or by identiﬁers used in
queries, ﬁnding all EMBOSS tools by EDAM data (input and/or
output, and other parameters), operation or topic and ﬁnding
EDAM concepts by id, name, deﬁnition or which have certain
relations deﬁned. The concept hierarchy is taken into account.

Applicability of EDAM to integrative workbenches has been
validated by implementations in eSysbio (http://esysbio.org) and
Bio-jETI (Lamprecht et al., 2011).

eSysbio is a prototype online workbench for analysing bio-
informatics data using shared or private Web services and R
scripts, and for sharing the data and tools among users.
eSysbio uses EDAM Data and Format to decide how to
handle data uploaded by users or produced by workﬂows.
EDAM annotation enables adequate visualization and search
among the data stored in the system. For example, a data
item, annotated as an Alignment and a supported Format, will
be open with the J alview editor (VVaterhouse et al., 2009). The
current version of eSysbio uses a limited subset of EDAM for
static navigation, without taking into account the relations other
than the closure of is format of. It allows grouping and ﬁltering
of data by their type, and sorting by type and format. eSysbio
may use the entire EDAM and its semantics in the future. This
can include the Operation and Topic sub-ontologies for categor-
ization and search among available Web services, scripts and

workﬂows, and as part of the provenance metadata for derived
data items.

Bio-jETI is a system for design, model checking and execution
of bioinformatics workﬂows. Bio-jETI uses EDAM Operation,
Data and Format annotations of EMBOSS and other tools to
enable automatic composition of workﬂows, according to formal
speciﬁcations deﬁning what the workﬂow is supposed to com-
pute (expressed using EDAM, too). The automated reasoning
software in Bio-jETI saves from matching different interfaces
and formats manually, by suggesting one or more alternative
workﬂows fulﬁlling the task. This has been shown to work for
tasks that can be easily deﬁned. Details about the use of EDAM
in Bio-jETI can be found in Lamprecht et al. (2011).

4 CONCLUSION

We have presented EDAM, the ontology that applies to semantic
annotation of tool functions, types of data and identiﬁers, data
formats and the domains of diverse resources within bioinfor-
matics. The development of EDAM has been application driven,
but EDAM is not application speciﬁc. Its usability has been
tested by annotating a multitude of tools and data resources.
EDAM’s applicability to searching, categorizing and automatic
handling of resources has been validated by implementations in
eSysbio, Bio-jETI and EMBOSS, demonstrating its relevance to
resource catalogues, tool libraries and integrative workbenches
within bioinformatics. EDAM is also relevant to data proven-
ance, text mining and the Semantic Web. Applicability of
EDAM as one of the markup vocabularies for bioinformatics
data in RDF was tested at the fourth BioHackathon in Kyoto
(example at https: / / github.com/dbcls /bh1 1 /wiki/BioXSD-
sequence-record-in—RDF).

EDAM does not try to cover all aspects of computational
biology. It focusses purely on the semantic ‘axes’ delineated by
its four main sub-ontologies: Operation, Data (including
Identiﬁer), Topic and Format, in which it targets the common
bioinformatics concepts, especially those reused in multiple con-
texts. Concepts from distinct EDAM sub-ontologies are related
by a few basic relations in addition to generalization (is a) which
constitutes the basic hierarchy. EDAM does not deﬁne the

aggregation relation (is part of, has part, has a or contains). What
particular computational steps are done inside an operation is
deﬁned by a particular algorithm or a workﬂow, and it may vary
between different implementations of the same operation. In the
same way for a type of data, what parts it must or may contain is
deﬁned by a concrete data model or format, an information
standard or reporting requirement. The included parts of data,
both mandatory and optional, differ between different formats
of the same type of data. While not deﬁning data and operation
parts universally, EDAM does offer concepts for annotating the
parts of a particular data format or dataset, and concepts for
annotating the steps of a particular bioinformatics algorithm or
workﬂow.

Computational aspects that are not speciﬁc to bioinformatics
should preferably be covered by independent information-tech-
nology ontologies, such as, for example, the SWO (http://theswo.
sourceforge.net) and the WSIO (http://wsio.org), the develop-
ment of both of which is coordinated with the development of
EDAM and the boundary concepts are referenced. EDAM
agnostically links to multiple upper ontologies, allowing a plur-
ality of future semantic-integration approaches. Some speciﬁc
detailed concepts of data and methods are in focus of other
ontologies, such as in case of the CDAO devoted to phylogen-
etics. In these cases EDAM excludes detailed concepts and in-
stead refers to the boundary ones in the more specialized
ontology. Different ontologies focussing on different semantic
‘axes’ than EDAM are clearly useful for enriching the annota-
tions of tools or datasets, such as the SO, which may denote
particular sequence features in focus of a tool or a dataset. In
obvious candidates for such annotations, the relevant ontologies
are referred to, such as in Feature record and Feature prediction
concepts in EDAM pointing to sequence feature in S0.

EDAM aims at being comprehensive for common concepts.
Good coverage demands recurring input from the scientiﬁc com-
munity, in particular within specialized domains in which the
core developers of EDAM lack expertise. For this purpose, a
broader sustainable consortium should evolve in the future.
EDAM will keep following the agile organic development
model tested throughout the accomplished iterations. Thanks
to the stable URIs and the deprecation mechanism, annotations
remain valid with a release of a new version of the ontology.
EDAM will continue being coordinated in harmony with related
efforts, such as with SWO, WSIO, BioXSD and potentially
others. The EDAM developers will continue improving
EDAM, while being dependent on the community input and
feedback from annotators, developers and users of bioinfor-
matics tools. Additions and corrections can be suggested using
a public issue tracker (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/panda/jira/browse/
BMB). The EDAM team will continue providing support to
the annotators and the application developers.

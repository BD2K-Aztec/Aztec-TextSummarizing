On the organization of bioinformatics core services in

biology-based research institutes

 

With the growth of genomics, research institutes are increasingly
confronted with the task of providing computational support to
biologists and the provision of computational facilities, both for
laboratory-based bioinformaticians and bioinformatics research
groups. The optimal organization of bioinformatics support units to
meet these needs is a common topic of discussion and consideration.

During the recent evaluation of a bioinformatics core facility, we
ended up discussing—in general terms—what we consider basic
guidelines for the organization of bioinformatics core units in large
research institutes, based on the experience and developments in our
own institutes.

We thought that part of our discussion could be useful for others,
keeping in mind that every organization has speciﬁc needs and
requirements, and that bioinformatics support is a fast moving
area that requires continuous adaptation. In the following, we
summarized what we consider some key recommendations:

(1) Bioinformatics departments have to clearly separate their
service units from their research laboratories. This contributes
to the transparency of the organization, especially regarding
the allocation of funds.

(2) The organization of bioinformatics service unit should be
clear with deﬁned missions for each component. It is
particularly important to separate tasks by topic. For example:
support of database development and maintenance, statistical
analysis of hi gh-throughput data, automatic image acquisition
and analysis of e.g. light microscopy data and analysis of
next— generation sequencing data.

(3) The unit should install a ‘users committee’ that includes
users and specialists of the unit. This committee would be
responsible for establishing clear priorities on what technical
platforms are supported or aborted, and deﬁning the rules
applied to prioritize projects for bioinformatics support.

(4) It is important that the services are provided in a highly
transparent manner, including publicly accessible information
on statistics of users, project progress, tools and use of
resources.

(5) Particularly important is the interface between the
bioinformatics unit and the medical activities in an
institute. This requires the integration of biobanking, medical
information (records) and the corresponding genomic
information. This activity is key for translational medicine
and it requires efﬁcient, multi—disciplinary interaction
between clinical and computational experts. This process can
be greatly enhanced by a seamless integration of the relevant
data streams.

(6) One of the key missions of the bioinformatics is to
provide training to biologists at a basic level. It is
important to also incorporate separate advanced training

in new technical developments for ‘hybrid users’ or for
expert bioinformaticians. This should preferably be done in
collaboration with the bioinformatics research laboratories in
the institute.

It is useful to nominate a bioinformatics support person,
whose task is to guide users in the use of public bioinformatics
tools and databases as well as tools and methods developed
within the institute. The goal is to facilitate the use of
bioinformatics by the biologists using state of the art tools.

Finally, there is always the very difﬁcult issue regarding the optimal
size of the bioinformatics support units. This depends on many
factors such as the diversity of the topics being covered in the
institute and the level of the computational skills of the biologists.
We will, therefore, not give an exact ﬁgure, but rather provide ﬁgures
from our own institutions which are very comparable in this regard.
In our own institutions, NKI-AVL, CNIO and FIMM, we have
approximately 1 full—time, institutionally funded bioinformatician to
support 100 scientists. In addition, the research groups themselves
have up to 5—10 times this number of bioinformaticians working in
their own research groups. This number varies, of course, depending
on the speciﬁc topics researched by a particular group. These so-
called ‘embedded’ bioinfomatics researchers are involved in more
research-oriented work and are largely funded by outside grants. In
our opinion it is very important to develop structures that allow the
‘embedded’ bioinformaticians to meet and communicate.

In conclusion, we can state that we favor a model where a small
core group of bioinformaticians provide transparently organized
support on more general, institute-wide research problems, while
the majority of the bioinformaticians are embedded in the research
groups. Embedding ensures more direct interaction between the
biologist and the bioinformatician, providing both researchers with
a sense of ownership of the project. Not only does this elevate the
skills level of both parties, but it also greatly enhances productivity.

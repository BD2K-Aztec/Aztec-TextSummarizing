ABSTRACT

Summary: With the continuous growth of the RCSB Protein
Data Bank (PDB), providing an up-to-date systematic structure
comparison of all protein structures poses an ever growing challenge.
Here, we present a comparison tool for calculating both 1D protein
sequence and 3D protein structure alignments. This tool supports
various applications at the RCSB PDB website. First, a structure
alignment web service calculates pairwise alignments. Second, a
stand-alone application runs alignments locally and visualizes the
results. Third, pre-calculated 3D structure comparisons for the whole
PDB are provided and updated on a weekly basis. These three
applications allow users to discover novel relationships between
proteins available either at the RCSB PDB or provided by the user.
Availability and Implementation: A web user interface is available
at http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/workbench/workbench.do. The source
code is available under the LGPL license from http://www.biojava.org.
A source bundle, prepared for local execution, is available from
http://source.rcsb.org

1 INTRODUCTION

At its core, the RCSB PDB Protein Comparison Tool contains
a new implementation of the two structure alignment algorithms
Combinatorial Extension (CE) (Shindyalov and Bourne, 1998) and
FATCAT (both rigid body and ﬂexible versions) (Ye and Godzik,
2003).

Both the CE and FATCAT algorithms detect aligned fragment
pairs (AFPs) during the alignment process. These AFPs are based
on similarities in local geometry. There is a difference in how initial
AFPs are combined in order to calculate an optimal alignment. CE
applies the process of ‘Combinatorial Extension’ to ﬁnd possible
continuous alignment paths leading to an optimal alignment. The
resulting alignment is a ‘rigid—body’ based alignment. In contrast to
this, FATCAT allows the introduction of ‘twists’ into the alignment

with the consequence that different regions of a protein structures
can undergo different geometric transformations. This is required in
order to be able to deal with protein ﬂexibility.

A protein that undergoes signiﬁcant domain re—arrangement
during iron binding is transferrin. It consists of two domains that
can move relative to each other. FATCAT in its ﬂexible mode can
easily detect an alignment between the apo and holo forms that
covers 95% of both protein chains. (e. g. PDB ID llEJ chain A and
PDB ID lBTJ chain A). However, using rigid body superposition
only a partial alignment is possible (both CE and FATCAT using
the rigid mode only). One drawback of the ﬂexible mode is that
if distantly related proteins are being aligned, sometimes twists
between unrelated regions can be introduced (e. g. alignment of PDB
ID 1CDG chain A and PDB ID lTIM chain A), in which case it is
better to run the alignments in rigid mode.

A limitation of both CE and FATCAT in their original versions is
that they compute sequence order—dependent alignments. A number
of difﬁcult to detect relationships between proteins have been
published, some of which require sequence order independence for
a correct alignment (Andreeva et al., 2006). An algorithm that can
detect such order—independet alignments is Triangle Match (B achar
et al., 1993; Nussinov and Wolfson, 1991). Dali in its early versions
also could detect permutated proteins; however, this feature seems
to have been lost in its recent implementations, (Holm and Sander,
1993). We have recently improved CE to be able to detect circularly
permutated alignments (Bliven et al., manuscript in preparation).
This implementation is available as an option of the RCSB Protein
Comparison Tool.

2 APPROACH

The CE and FATCAT algorithms have been re—implemented in the
Java programming language, which is indicated by a lower—case j
in front of the new names, jCE and jFATCAT. Several components
were added to these implementations.

First, the alignment algorithms were integrated into the RCSB
PDB website, Berman et al. (2000) to provide a novel structure
alignment service. Second, a stand—alone application can be run
using Java Web Start technology. Third, a client—server architecture
was developed for calculating large—scale comparisons using

compute clouds. Finally, a software bundle is provided that allows
local installation of the tool and to run custom comparisons. We
describe some of these components in more detail.

Pairwise sequence and structure alignment The comparison tool
allows pairwise comparison of protein sequences and 3D structures.
For sequence comparison the Smith—Waterman (Smith and
Waterman, 1981), Needleman—Wunsch (Needleman and Wunsch,
1970) and blast2seq (Tatusova and Madden, 1999), algorithms
are provided. Support for structure comparisons includes the
new implementations of CE and FATCAT and links to some of
the most prominent external protein structure alignment services:
the original FATCAT server (Ye and Godzik, 2004), Mammoth
(Ortiz et al., 2002), TM—align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) and
Topmatch, (Sippl and Wiederstein, 2008), (Sippl, 2008). Other
available structure alignment software can be found at Wikipedia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_alignment_software

All alignments that are run using jCE and jFATCAT are calculated
server—side on the ﬂy and cached for future retrieval using XML
ﬁles. If the alignment is requested again later, it can be instantly
returned by reading the XML ﬁle. A web user interface provides
access to the alignment results. Alternatively, a Java Web Start
client application, based on Jmol (2010), and BioJava (Holland
et al., 2008), provides a novel 3D visualization tool that allows
the investigation of sequence—structure relationships between two
aligned proteins. See Figure 1 for an example alignment.

Systematic structure alignments across the PDB Sequence data—
base searches are a frequently used tool to identify closely related
proteins within a database. However, with decreasing sequence
similarity relationships between proteins become harder to detect.
In order to enable identiﬁcation of relationships across the PDB,
even if sequence similarity is low, we are providing systematic and
precomputed alignments.

The procedure providing pre—computed structure comparisons
across the PDB is split into two steps.

First, the goal is to reduce the complexity of the problem by
identifying representative protein chains for clusters of related
proteins. BLASTClust (Altschul et al., 2004) is used to cluster
all protein chains by sequence similarity. We require 90% overlap
between all sequences in a cluster. Therefore, a shorter fragment (e.g.
a single domain) of a longer sequence (e. g. a multi—domain protein)
will usually not be in the same cluster as the whole sequence. Within
clusters, sequences are ranked by experimental method, resolution
and release date. While the RCSB PDB website provides sequence
comparisons for various levels of sequence identity within a cluster,
structural comparisons are only provided based on clusters with 40%
sequence identity, currently approximately 16 000 representative
protein chains.

Second, the rigid version of jFATCAT is used to calculate
all—against—all 3D structure comparisons across all representative
protein chains. This requires a signiﬁcant amount of CPU time. Spec—
iﬁcally, a client—server architecture has been developed that allows
the user to easily run a large number of j obs in parallel (for details see
http://www.renci.org/publications/techreports/TR—09—03.pdf). A total
of 122 million alignments were calculated on the Open Science
Grid, taking approximately 102 000 CPU hours. Another 18 million
alignments were calculated on the San Diego Supercomputing

alignment results were stored in ~1 terabyte of XML ﬁles.

Weekly updates Incremental updates to the all—against—all
comparisons are run weekly using in—house RCSB PDB servers
at the same time the PDB itself is updated. Every week new
sequence clusters are calculated and missing alignments for newly
added representative chains are calculated. At present, an average
weekly update requires the calculation of about 1 million structure
alignments.

3 DISCUSSION

The RCSB PDB website now provides a state of the art protein
comparison tool that can be used as a web service and for
local access. Further, pre—calculated all—against—all comparisons of
sequences and 3D protein structures, respectively, are provided on a
weekly basis. Currently, the calculations are done on a whole—chain
basis. We are working on another set of comparisons using domain—
based comparisons of all chains with an enhanced version of jCE
that includes handling of circular permutations. An alternative is to
use TOPS++FATCAT (Veeramalai et al., 2008), which provides a
10—fold speed up as compared to FATCAT. The domain assignment
problem is non—trivial, and for newly released protein structures

results are not immediately available from classiﬁcations like SCOP
(Andreeva et al., 2008), or CATH (Cuff et al., 2009). Hence, we are
investigating whether consensus based approaches like pDomains,
(Alden et al., 2010), can guide which domain assignments to use for
the automated calculations.

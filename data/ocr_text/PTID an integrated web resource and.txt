ABSTRACT

Summary: Although in silico drug discovery approaches are crucial for
the development of pharmaceuticals, their potential advantages in
agrochemical industry have not been realized. The challenge for
computer-aided methods in agrochemical arena is a lack of sufficient
information for both pesticides and their targets. Therefore, it is
important to establish such knowledge repertoire that contains com-
prehensive pesticides’ profiles, which include physicochemical prop-
erties, environmental fates, toxicities and mode of actions. Here, we
present an integrated platform called Pesticide-Target interaction
database (PTID), which comprises a total of 1347 pesticides with
rich annotation of ecotoxicological and toxicological data as well as
13738 interactions of pesticide-target and 4245 protein terms via text
mining. Additionally, through the integration of ChemMapper, an
in-house computational approach to polypharmacology, PTID can
be used as a computational platform to identify pesticides targets
and design novel agrochemical products.

1 INTRODUCTION

Agrochemical products help us and our crops defend from the
invasion of insects, weeds and fungi. Unfortunately, the resist-
ance arising from the increasing selection pressure as well as the
cross-resistance of pesticides acting on the same target limits
the continuing use of almost all pesticides (Casida, 2009). On
the other hand, environmental safety and toxicity are major
factors to the failures in last stages of pesticides development.
In the face of ever-increasing stringent demands of efﬁcacy and
environmental safety, the discovery of new agrochemicals is
clearly imperative. Since the 1990’s, in vivo and in vitro high
throughput screen has been routinely used in agrochemical dis-
covery (Tietjen et al., 2005). However, both of these random
screening methods require a large number of compounds and
produce few hits. In the past decade, rational methods such as

structure-based design were introduced into agrochemical indus-
tries, and the combination of rational and non-rational methods
was realized to be more efﬁcient than traditional high through-
put screen WValter, 2002). Recently in silico approaches, which
are routine methods for developing new pharmaceuticals, have
entered the lead discovery processes of agrochemical industry
(Speck-Planche et al., 2012a, b). These methods can discover
new active ingredients with ideal properties at lower cost in
much quicker time. Additionally, risk assessment and toxicity
prediction are also considered.

However, both of rational in vitro and in silico approaches and
analysis demand enormous information not only on the struc-
ture, physicochemical properties, toxicity and mode of action of
existed pesticides but also the structural data of the active sites.
Although these data are available Via a diversity of sources
including government departments, manufacturers and universi-
ties, the dispersed data source and a lack of search and analysis
tools make accessing inconvenient. Moreover, insufﬁcient know-
ledge of targets and three-dimensional structures also impedes
the applications of computer aided methods.

Consequently, there is a severe need for a comprehensive data-
base covering physicochemical properties, environmental fates
and mode of action, with integration of high-level search
system and analysis tools, for novel pesticide discovery and
risk assessments. The purpose of Pesticide-Target interaction
database (PTID) is to establish a web-accessible database provid-
ing association information of pesticides and corresponding po-
tential targets Via text mining.

2 DATA SETUP

The general pesticides data of PTID were extracted from US
EPA Pesticide Programs and EU Pesticide database. These pesti-
cides were grouped into 22 classiﬁcations such as insecticides,
herbicides and fungicides based mainly on chemical structure
and pesticide activity (Supplementary Table S1). In addition to
general pesticides information, toxicological and environmental
proﬁles, which came from US-EPA Pesticide project, EU
Pesticide database, IPM and PPDB were also integrated.
Subsequently, structural data were annotated through NCBI
PubChem, and physicochemical properties for each pesticide
were calculated (See Supplementary Material Table S2 for the
details of data source).

PTID

 

To derive potential pesticides—proteins relationships, which
were hidden in a vast amount of dispersed literature, text
mining method were introduced. Starting with 1347 pesticides
and their synonyms, the text mining tool PolySearch was used
for extracting the relevant text passages containing potential
pesticide-target relationships from public abstracts listed in
PubMed (Cheng et al., 2008). More than 13 000 interactions of
pesticide-target were extracted, and 4245 protein terms were
ﬁnally mapped onto the pesticides and classiﬁed accordingly.
We assigned relevancy score as conﬁdence score to reﬂect the
level of signiﬁcance and certainty of interactions. Details of rele-
vancy score could refer to the Supplementary Material. In add-
ition to literature-derived protein terms, sequence date and other
annotation were searched from Entrez Gene and SwissProt/
TrEMBL by querying the combination of protein terms and
organism of pests.

3 USER INTERFACE AND SERVICE

3.1 Web interface

The data of PTID is accessible through a simple, user-friendly
web interface. In addition to intelligent text search and advanced
Boolean text search, PTID also offers a sequence alignment
search and a chemical structure search.

The structure similarity search tool allows users to quickly
and simply identify pesticide scaffolds by inputting query tem-
plate. PTID provides three methods for similarity searching.
Fingerprints molecular similarity and substructure searching
implemented by Open Babel allow a quick identiﬁcation of pesti-
cide scaffolds by inputting query template, whereas 3D similarity
method implemented by SHAF TS, which combines shape similar-
ity and feature similarity and allows an identiﬁcation of pesticides
with similar physiochemical properties, may affect the same mode
of action (Liu et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2011; O’Boyle et al., 2011).

Similarly, sequence alignment is particularly useful, as it can
potentially allow users to quickly and simply identify pesticides
from newly sequenced pathogens. Given the FASTA formatted
sequence and chosen target organism, the sequence alignment
search service performs a BLAST search on PTID target
dictionary.

3.2 Local BLAST service

Sequence alignment is crucial for many biological analyses,
including functional annotation, classifying protein and structure
modeling. PTID provides local BLAST service in the detailed page
of each sequence. Sequence index of non-redundant protein se-
quence, PDB and SwissProt were provided. The BLAST service
allows users to specify database, sequence segment and other
parameters. The output page, which is formatted by BLAST,
includes a link to corresponding record of these protein databases.

3.3 ChemMapper service

Through the integration of ChemMapper, PTID provided the
functions for novel pesticides discovery and potential mode of
action prediction via polypharmacology effects computation
(http://lilab.ecust.edu.cn/chemmapper/). ChemMapper service
can be used to generate novel chemical scaffolds and lead

discovery by the pattern of known agrochemicals in PTID
through three-dimensional molecular similarity search in the
large scale of chemical library. On the other hand, searching in
a large repertoire of bioactive chemical database with target an-
notation can help users to retrieve new biological effects or elu-
cidate their mechanism of action Via predicting potential targets
for those agrochemicals; moreover, potential toxicity can also be
predicted by comparing with similar chemicals, which bind to
anti-targets of Homo sapiens or mammalia. (See more details
from Supplementary Material)

3.4 Pesticides-targets network visualization

Graphic network always provides intuitively View of interaction
data. PTID presented current entry in context of an interactive
graphic network implemented by customized Cytoscape web net-
work Visualization components of interaction partners (Lopes
et al., 2010). The customized Cytoscape web plugin has a user-
friendly graphical user interface and supplies various tools and
layouts for network analysis. Users may ﬁlter nodes or edges
according to conﬁdence score or distance between other nodes
and current entry. Using network analysis, it can be hypothesized
that certain pesticides, which have high degrees, could show
their toxicity and adverse environmental effect (Supplementary
Figure S1).

4 CONCLUSION

The current version of PTID contains ~1347 pesticides with an-
notation of toxicity and environmental fates. More than 4245
potential target terms were derived by text mining tool; sequence
data were also annotated for each target term. In addition to
these data, several computational tools for target exploration
and Virtual screen were also integrated into PTID. Potential ap-
plication of PTID includes identiﬁcation of pesticides by struc-
tures or properties interest; prediction of potential targets; or
assessment of toxicity and environmental effect. To our know-
ledge, PTID is the ﬁrst attempt to establish a pesticide database,
which is integrated with the knowledge of protein—protein inter-
actions. It is expected that PTID will serve as a useful resource
for the development of agrochemicals.

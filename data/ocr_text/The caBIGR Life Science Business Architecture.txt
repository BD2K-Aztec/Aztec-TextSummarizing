ABSTRACT

Motivation: Business Architecture Models (BAMs) describe what
a business does, who performs the activities, where and when
activities are performed, how activities are accomplished and which
data are present. The purpose of a BAM is to provide a common
resource for understanding business functions and requirements and
to guide software development. The cancer Biomedical Informatics
Grid (caBlG®) Life Science BAM (LS BAM) provides a shared
understanding of the vocabulary, goals and processes that are
common in the business of LS research.

Results: LS BAM 1.1 includes 90 goals and 61 people and groups
within Use Case and Activity Unified Modeling Language (UML)
Diagrams. Here we report on the model’s current release, LS
BAM 1.1, its utility and usage, and plans for future use and continuing
development for future releases.

Availability and Implementation: The LS BAM is freely available as
UML, PDF and HTML (https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/X/OFNyAQ).

1 INTRODUCTION

Business Architecture is deﬁned as a ‘blueprint of the enterprise
that provides a common understanding of [an] organization and
is used to align strategic objectives and tactical demands’ (Object
Management Group, 2010). It provides clear, concise descriptions
of what an enterprise does (its business capabilities), who performs
the activities within the enterprise (organizational hierarchy and
governance structures), how activities are accomplished (business
processes), which data are present within the enterprise (business

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

knowledge) and where activities and processes occur. These
characterizations are documented within business models, such as
Use Case (descriptions of goals), Activity and Class Diagrams
(The Open Group, 2007), each of which provides a different View
of the enterprise. Business models can be used to (i) identify
gaps, dependencies or redundancies in personnel, procedures
and software; (ii) standardize how enterprises operate and train
people who lack domain expertise; (iii) deﬁne business rules
and logic; and (iV) prioritize business goals and match business
priorities with information technology solutions (International
Institute for Business Analysis, 2010). Due to these and other
beneﬁts, the models have been successfully used within domains
as diverse as accounting (McCarthy, 1982), information technology
(Arraj, 2010), food service (Hammer and Champy, 2001), supply
chain management (Poluha, 2007) and telecommunications (Kelly,
2003).These domains have robust, mature processes supporting
software requirements gathering and development efforts that can
be leveraged by informatics teams within the biomedical domain.
Indeed, international standards bodies such as the Clinical Data
Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) and HealthLevel7
(El Fadly et al., 2007; Fridsma et al., 2008) and the federal
government, including the National Cancer Institute (NCI; United
States Federal Government, 2007) have begun adopting the models
to support their informatics efforts for life sciences (LS s) and clinical
research (CR).

The community of researchers, clinicians, vendors and patient
advocates taking part in the NCI caBIG® initiative is developing a
standards—based informatics framework with the goal of establishing
a shared and standardized infrastructure that will facilitate software
interoperability. Platform—independent interoperability (i.e. software
communication independent of operating system and computer
language) is crucial to creating a collaborative information network
driving the exchange of data regardless of who collected them
or how they are stored. Such interoperability will help accelerate
the discovery of new approaches for cancer diagnostics, detection
and therapeutics. Biomedical data sharing is widely held as a

Case detail. LS research activities are decomposed in a top—down approach;
this UML Use Case Diagram subset shows the four most general use cases,
as ovals, that represent the activities that life scientists undertake. One
supporting use case, which can occur at the enterprise level of an organization
or within subdivisions of the enterprise, is shown in the inset. The small icon
in the bottom right corner of the use cases indicates that the use case is a
composite, i.e. it has one or more child use cases.

key component to accelerate scientiﬁc progress, reduce costs and
decrease the time to move discoveries from the bench to the bedside
(Piwowar et al., 2008), thus paving the way to the discovery of new
approaches for diagnostics, detection and therapeutics. To exchange
data between independently built systems, cancer research software
must utilize common semantics to combat ambiguity. Data elements
must have precise meanings, conveyed by standard terminologies,
and must be set in the context of well—described research processes
to deﬁne how the software should function, what data should be
collected and when and with whom these data can be shared.
Business models can support and facilitate the goal of software
interoperability by providing a standard context describing LS
research goals and activities. To this end, members of the caBIG
LS community have developed the LS Business Architecture Model
(LS BAM). The LS research domain encompasses hypothesis
and discovery—based basic and pre—CR spanning disciplines that
include genetics, biochemistry, cell and molecular biology and
bioinformatics. LS research is aimed at understanding biological
mechanisms, processes and disease states; discovering disease
biomarkers and potential drug targets; and facilitating translational
research. The LS BAM documents the people, organizations, goals
and processes that are part of the LS research domain enterprise
through use cases (Fig. 1) and actors. Use cases are textual
descriptions of tasks that are performed to achieve speciﬁc goals,
while actors are the entities that carry out or are otherwise associated
with the goals deﬁned in the use cases. Actors can be individuals (e. g.
principal investigators or graduate students), groups or committees
(e. g. the Institutional Review Board or Core Facilities) or entire
institutions. The model is composed of a Use Case Diagram,
which depicts the compositional relationship between use cases,
and Activity Diagrams, which logically order use cases and actors.
The LS BAM describes goals that are common to all LS research
sub—domains, including how LS research is planned and performed;
the organizations, resources and methodologies involved; how data
and materials are controlled and analyzed; and how outputs are
disseminated. The model provides a framework for understanding
the business of LS research through a common set of LS use

cases and vocabulary that, when used to deﬁne requirements
for information systems supporting LS work, will facilitate data
exchange and integration. The LS BAM may further be useful
for staff training, standards development and software validation
for software development efforts in the public and private sectors.
Here we report on the model’s current release [LS BAM 1.1;
Use Case Uniﬁed Modeling Language (UML) Model, PDF
and Internet Explorer Viewer (https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/OFNyAQ),
Activity Diagram), its real world applications, and plans for its
usage, continuing development and integration with other models
to create a Translational Medicine BAM. The caBIG community
welcomes feedback on this model (http://bit.ly/9DYSX1).

2 METHODS

2.1 Model components

The LS BAM consists of use cases and the actors that perform them.
They can be ordered to represent speciﬁc activities. Use cases are text
descriptions of tasks that are performed to achieve speciﬁc goals. Each use
case includes a background, storyboard describing all components of the
goal, and itemized pre—conditions, basic ﬂow of events, post—conditions and
alternative conditions, should they exist (International Institute of Business
Analysis, 2010). Actors and use cases are deﬁned in a Use Case Diagram.
Activity Diagrams model actors and necessary use cases from the Use Case
Diagram in a logical order with deﬁned decision points.

2.2 Development of the model

The Use Case Diagram of LS BAM 1.1 consists of 90 use cases and 61 actors.
The LS BAM was created in over a year of twice to thrice weekly meetings.
The ﬁrst 9 months were spent on the 1.0 release and another 5 months
for the current 1.1 release. To create these artifacts, the LS BAM Team
iteratively decomposed LS research goals in a top—down fashion, such that
use cases describing broad research goals were written ﬁrst (‘parent’ use
cases) and then each was deconstructed into ﬁner—grained ‘child’ goals
(e.g. Fig. 2 compares the top—level ‘parent’ use case with the second—tier
‘children’). Typically, child use cases were identiﬁed from the sub—goals
within a storyboard and basic ﬂow of events of parent use cases. Some
additional child use cases were identiﬁed by reviewing the model for gaps
in content. When this occurred, the parent use case was also reviewed to
ensure that its text appropriately covered the newly identiﬁed child. A list
of common LS research actors was created by the LS BAM development
team and reviewed against the caBIG CR BAM (http://bit.ly/ihmpr) for
overlap.

Activity Diagrams typically document very speciﬁc activities and are
created as areas of priority are identiﬁed. For LS BAM 1.1, an exemplar
Activity Diagram was created to illustrate how these diagrams can be
developed. Use cases and actors from the Use Case Diagram that were
required to accomplish the selected activity were identiﬁed and placed in
a logical order, with decision points and outcomes noted, using Microsoft
Visio (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA).

Controlled vocabularies from the NCI’s Enterprise Vocabulary Services
[EVS, e.g. the NCI Thesaurus and Metathesaurus, (de Coronado et al.,
2004; Haber et al., 2007) which include terms from caBIG, CDISC, Logical
Observation Identiﬁers, Names and Codes (LOINC®), etc.] were utilized in
the use cases and actors. A Vocabulary Task Group comprised of members
of the LS BAM Development Team, NCI EVS group and other caBIG group
members met to review the deﬁnitions identiﬁed by the BAM Team and
to ensure terminological harmony between the LS BAM and other related
models.

Text for each use case and actor was written in Microsoft Word (Microsoft
Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). The text was incorporated into UML
diagrams with Enterprise Architect 7.1 (EA, Sparx Systems, Creswick,

Victoria, Australia). UML and Word ﬁles were both utilized because they
provided two different views on the model. The former was better for quick
visualization of the use cases, actors and their inter—relationships, but was
limited in that text cannot be viewed simultaneously for many use cases or
actors. The latter was better for reviewing all use case and actor text for the
model, and utilization of Word’s global search capabilities further facilitates
consistent use of key vocabulary.

2.3 Vetting the model

A multidisciplinary group of experts with diverse LS experience in areas
such as basic and translational research, business analysis and informatics
at academic, government and industrial organizations was assembled to
develop the LS BAM (Supplementary Table S1). This group was divided into
two teams, designated the small and large teams. Both teams were composed
of subject matter experts from across various disciplines and an LS business
analyst. The large team consisted of all small team members with additional
subject matter experts, a program manager and a representative from the
NCI. The small team met twice a week via web conference to identify and
prioritize LS use cases and actors, create artifacts, and review and vet the
work. The large team met every 2 weeks to review and critique the work
of the small team. As the large team vetted subsections of the LS BAM,
they were released for review by members of the LS community, including
the caBIG Integrative Cancer Research and Tissue Banks and Pathology
Tools Workspaces, which encompass domain and technical experts from
NCI—Designated Cancer Centers, Medical Centers, the NCI and commercial
vendors.

3 RESULTS

The LS BAM 1.1 contains a Use Case Diagram and an exemplar
Activity Diagram. The Use Case UML consists of 90 use cases and
61 actors (https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/OFNyAQ). As part of future

efforts, the actors will be integrated into the Use Case Diagrams.
The LS BAM 1.1 Activity Diagram logically orders seven use cases
into a workﬂow, associates three actors to the appropriate goals and
is also available for download (http://bit.ly/bqulv).

3.1 Use Case Diagram

3.1.] Use Cases and Diagram Interpretation Each use case
(Figs 1 and 2), gives signiﬁcant detail about an LS business goal
through detailed storyboards, pre—conditions that must be met before
use case can be started, basic ﬂow of events for accomplishing the
goal and post—conditions. Use cases often include a set of sub—goals
in the basic ﬂow of events that must be met as part of the major goal,
and these sub goals can themselves be described in associated ‘child’
use cases. For example, the LS BAM 1.1 contains four general use
case packages (Fig. 1), describing the major goals to:

0 Plan Research;
0 Perform Research;
0 Analyze & Synthesize Results; and

0 Disseminate Results & Artifacts

Each of these high—level use cases cascades to more ‘child’ use cases.
The LS BAM is intentionally general enough to represent any LS
research; therefore these goals remain very broad.

The 29 child use cases of Plan Research describe more ﬁne—
grained goals such as ‘identiﬁcation of the scientiﬁc question
or hypothesis’ and ‘identiﬁcation of the experimental systems,
materials and resources that will be used to address the question’
(Fig. 2). The 28 children of Perform Research detail goals such as

obtaining the materials and resources identiﬁed within the children
of Plan Research, as well as those that are part of executing
planned experiments. The seven children of Analyze & Synthesize
Results provide descriptions of processing data, analyzing data and
interpreting the analyzed results. Those 11 of Disseminate Results
& Artifacts communicate details of annotating results, summarizing
experimental ﬁndings, and sharing data and interpreted results
through a variety of mechanisms (the term Artifacts refers to man—
made materials such as data, materials or tools). The iterative
nature of LS research is explicitly noted within the text of these
child use cases and their parents. For example, activities performed
as part of the goal Identify Resources, such as identifying grant
funding sources, may shape what publications and other background
information is reviewed in the use case Identify and Review Existing
Works. Reciprocally, review of existing works may suggest new
resources. The structure represented in the Use Case Diagram is not
intended to convey any particular ordering of goals in a workﬂow.
The hierarchy of use case relationships within the Use Case Diagram
exists strictly for the organization of concepts and inheritance of
properties from parent use cases.

3.1.2 Supporting Use Case Certain functions in research might
be considered ‘support’ functions that are necessary for a complete
understanding of business process, but possibly spanning multiple
higher level use cases and their children. These use cases describe
goals most often relevant across an organization, but that may also
occur within divisions or subdivisions of the organization. This
is exempliﬁed in Establish Permissions (Fig. 1, inset) where, for
instance, permissions for human subjects research is managed by
a single institution—wide Institutional Review Board and must be
obtained prior to performing research, whereas a single department
may regulate permission to publish the experimental ﬁndings.

3.1.3 Actors Actors identify and perform the work needed to
accomplish various goals and can be individuals, systems, groups,
committees or entire institutions. They are associated with use
cases in Use Case and Activity Diagrams to explicitly deﬁne
roles and responsibilities. Actors generically describe functional
responsibilities of a person, group or institution, and their names
may be, but are not necessarily, job titles or organization categories,
such as Biostatistician or Vendor.

The LS BAM contains 61 actors grouped into three categories:
Organizations, People and Systems. Twenty of these actors, such
as a Principal Investigator and Research Laboratory, are generally
applicable to biomedical research as a whole and are present within
both the LS and CR BAMs. The other 41 actors are speciﬁc
to the LS BAM, such as the actor Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC). LS research has a strong training
component, so actors also include Student/Trainee, with the children
Undergraduate Student, Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Scholar.
The actors have not yet been associated with the use cases of the
Use Case Diagram of the LS BAM 1.1, but are available as part of
the EA and PDF ﬁles (https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/OFNyAQ).

3.2 Activity Diagrams

While the LS BAM use cases and actors present common
‘building blocks,’ LS research actually is carried out as a series of
speciﬁcally ordered goals. Activity Diagrams graphically illustrate
the chronological and logical arrangement of these goals (using the

performed by speciﬁc actors for the purpose of rendering a
workﬂow. An exemplar Activity Diagram has been constructed for
LS BAM 1.1 that represents a general workﬂow of identifying and
obtaining archival human tissues for a research study (Fig. 3). It
demonstrates how seven use cases (Train Personnel, Identify &
Review Knowledge Bases and/0r Databases, Identiﬁ Specimens,
Establish Permissions, Obtain Specimens, Manage Specimens and
Perform Research) and three actors (Researcher, Materials Oversight
Committee and Technician) from the Use Case Diagram can be
ordered and associated to document: (i) temporal relationships of
tasks and decisions; (ii) points at which data are created/collected;
and (iii) iterations or dependencies that may span a series of use
cases. Activity Diagrams document very speciﬁc processes and not
general goals, e. g. compare the speciﬁcity of a researcher identifying
specimens available from speciﬁc tissue banks (Fig. 3, top right
square in the dashed—line box), with the more general goal to
Identify Specimens (Fig. 2). Select use cases from the Use Case
Diagram can be implemented as a single Activity Diagram task, as
in the example above and ‘Specimens are stored per local standard
operating procedures (SOPs)’ (bottom of Fig. 3) mapping to the
Manage Specimens use case. Multiple tasks can also be traced
to a single use case, such as both ‘Specimens are received at a
local bank’ and ‘Researcher retrieves and evaluates the specimens
ﬁt for purpose’ mapping to the use case Obtain Specimens.LS
workﬂows tend to be diverse among different laboratories, and there
are thousands of different types of LS methods that can be used in
various combinations to achieve a scientiﬁc goal. It is not possible

to document all possible LS activities or even to reduce the domain
to a small number of generic practices represented as workﬂow
diagrams. Instead, additional Activity Diagrams will be created as
areas of priority are identiﬁed.

4 DISCUSSION

The caBIG LS BAM 1.1 provides a blueprint of the business
capabilities, business processes and business knowledge common to
the LS domain. The scope of the LS BAM 1.1 Use Case Diagram was
established such that it is not an exhaustive description of the details
of all institutional governance structures or the business capabilities,
processes and knowledge of each LS sub—domain, but rather those
entities that are common across the LS domain. Indeed, if the goal of
the LS BAM were to exhaustively describe all details of biomedical
research, it could of course expand indeﬁnitely. As areas of priority
are identiﬁed by NCI governance teams for software development
or other business needs, future LS BAM releases will be extended
as required to meet these needs. Thus, the LS BAM should provide
enough detail to meet the current informational needs of stakeholders
by documenting goals common among all LS research with the
anticipation of further use case decomposition as needed. Speciﬁc
examples of how the LS BAM is currently being used for software
development and requirements traceability are described below.

4.1 LS BAM and the caBIG LS Domain Analysis
Model 1.1

The business processes described in a BAM also provide context for
the development of information models, e. g. Class Diagrams. Class
Diagrams present common representations of the data of a domain
and their attributes, datatypes, permissible values and relationships.
Workﬂows and references to data that are collected, exchanged,
integrated or processed in the LS BAM Use Case and Activity
Diagrams can be used to create a Class Diagram for an entire domain,
such as the LS Domain Analysis Model (DAM). Information models
for many different pieces of software supporting diverse LS sub—
domains or workﬂows can be created from a single domain analysis
model.

While the LS BAM provides a description of the business
processes of the LS domain, the LS DAM provides a description
of the data semantics of the LS domain and is traceable to
the business capabilities and processes in the LS BAM. For
example, the data class ExperimentalItem was created in the Domain
Analysis Model to capture the BAM concept of experimental
items, which are specialized study materials usually required to
conduct an experiment and are logically distinct from general
reagents and supplies, e.g. see ‘Identiﬁ Experimental Items’
(https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/OFNyAQ). As the LS BAM describes
how one researcher’s processed data may be another researcher’s
primary data, the existing LS DAM class, ProcessedData, was
generalized to Data. In addition, classes and attributes in the Domain
Analysis Model are being traced back to the BAM to provide a
holistic representation of business processes and the data elements
necessary to describe LS research concepts. As the LS BAM is a
‘living’ model, the LS DAM will continue to be updated as required
as the LS BAM expands.

To create platform—independent interoperability among software
systems, both data standards and a common business context must

be applied. To this end, the LS DAM deﬁnes the data properties
within its classes and attributes, and the LS BAM deﬁnes which
of these data should be captured and exchanged, at what time
and with whom. Conformance to these models can ensure some
basic level of interoperability, as all services and applications will
map to the standard use cases and classes. This conformance and
interoperability can be validated using test conditions that validate
that a given interface is conformant to the LS BAM and LS
DAM speciﬁcations supporting a given LS scenario. For example,
test scripts can be written to verify that a system’s data model
matches classes from the LS DAM, which are derived from use
cases and actors from the LS BAM [see conformance statements in
(http://bit.ly/kaMXB )] .

4.2 LS BAM, the Enterprise Conformance and
Compliance Framework and the caBIO Molecular
Annotation Service Reference Implementation

The caBIG initiative is adopting the HL7 Services Aware
Interoperability Framework (SAIF) to support the development
of semantically interoperable services. One SAIF component, the
Enterprise Conformance and Compliance Framework (ECCF),
provides software development teams with clear guidelines and a
standard methodology to show compliance of the planned service
to existing standards reference models such as the LS BAM and the
LS DAM (http://bit.ly/abexP). The service use cases, processes and
storyboards must be mapped to a standardized Use Case Diagram.
For LS services these items are mapped to the LS BAM.

As a reference implementation of the ECCF, the LS BAM
has been used in support of the development of a Molecular
Annotations (MA) Service (http://bit.ly/ax0UWK) based on the
caBIO (cancer Biomedical Informatics Objects). caBIO is an open—
source object—oriented model and data resource that integrates
biomedical annotations on genes, proteins, disease ontologies,
pathways and other biological entities with controlled vocabularies
and metadata models originating from 23 data sources (Covitz
et al., 2003; Komatsoulis et al., 2008). The MA service allows
programmers and scientists to quickly access biological annotations
in a platform—independent fashion and is currently available as a pre—
production resource. As part of their ECCF—compliant development
process, the MA service development team created artifacts detailing
the service speciﬁcations for three business use cases and mapped
them to the four LS BAM 1.1 use cases: Characterize/Organize
the Data, Integrate Data Sets, Annotate Findings/Results, and
Identiﬁ and Review Knowledge Bases and/0r Databases. For
example, the service objective to obtain ‘information associated with

4.3 LS BAM, caLIMSv2 and NCI Enterprise Services

The cancer Laboratory Information Management System
(caLIMSv2) development team has also extensively used the LS
BAM to facilitate the design of core aspects of their ongoing efforts
to create an interoperable laboratory information management
system (LIMS). caLIMSv2 is being developed as a conﬁgurable,
open—source system that utilizes a set of services to manage a
complete laboratory workﬂow. These services are designed to

interoperate with biospecimen management and experimental
results management services, such as those that are being
implemented in caTissue and caArray, respectively. Core LIMS
functions include the management of personnel, equipment, lab
supplies, reagents, samples, workﬂows and experimentally derived
metadata and data. The team reviewed the Use Case Diagram and
utilized concepts such as equipment (Identiﬂ Equipment), facilities
(Identiﬂ Facilities particularly core facilities), data and metadata
(Obtain Data, Metadata and Annotations) and conﬁguration of
the experimental system (Conﬁgure Equipment and Conﬁgure
Software Tools). In addition to the LS BAM use cases, the actors
within the model were also of signiﬁcant value to the creation of
privilege—based roles for end users in the system. These actors
included organizations such as Collaborative teams (Collaborators),
Oversight Bodies [Institutional Review Board (IRB) and IACUC]
and individual persons, such as Bioinformaticians, Statisticians and
Students. caLIMSv2 developers also provided critical feedback to
the LS BAM team, as during their review process they identiﬁed the
need for use cases surrounding the management of data (Manage
Data). Thus, the LS BAM was utilized to identify areas that were
within the scope of a LIMS, but had not previously been included
in a standardized way in caLIMSv2 development plans.

LS BAM is also being used to evaluate and identify NCI
Enterprise Services (NES). The NES is a portfolio of software
services that can be implemented in any LS application to facilitate
interoperability. Services that have been implemented through the
caBIG program include those that expose data for organizations,
people, protocol abstraction and the correlation among these entities.
Once core speciﬁcations were developed for the caLIMSv2 services,
analysts reviewed the existing NES to determine if all concepts
were present and found that some of the concepts that were taken
from the LS BAM were missing in the Correlation of Organizations
and Person services. The analysts took these ﬁndings back to the
NCI Enterprise Architecture team, who are currently reviewing the
feedback and may revise or create additional standard services.
Using the LS BAM, the caLIMSv2 team was able to review the
existing services within the NES portfolio to identify areas in which
such services were needed.

4.4 Future directions

Efforts are underway to expand the LS BAM by creating additional
Activity Diagrams for priority concerns in the areas of next
generation sequencing, pathology and imaging, all areas of particular
interest to the caBIG community. The LS BAM is one of
several caBIG BAMs, including CR, population sciences, clinical
information and patients involved in human subjects research. As
there are signiﬁcant areas of overlap and synergy of purpose among
these BAMs, there are plans to integrate them to create a caBIG
Translational Medicine BAM (Fig. 4). Coordinating the growth and
expansion of the Translational Medicine BAM will be important
to its sustainability; therefore, the governance processes are being
developed to manage updating, expansion and maintenance of the
BAMs in response to user feedback. A number of activities in LS
BAM development and use have been identiﬁed for future work.
The LS BAM use cases will be expanded in areas of priority, actors
will be fully incorporated into the Use Case Diagram, and additional
Activity Diagrams will be created for processes related capabilities
critical to the caBIG community.

Fig. 4. The Translational Medicine BAM—conceptual future vision.
Currently there are two mature caBIG BAMs—a LSs research BAM and
a CR BAM. Work has begun to create BAMs for population sciences, cancer
electronic health records and patients involved in human subjects research
(Patient BAM). The vision is that these individual models will eventually
be integrated to form the Translational Medicine BAM (rectangle). Areas of
synergy between goals documented within the various BAMs are represented
by overlap. BAM circle circumference represents the current relative
maturity and size of each model.

Mapping the LS BAM to the LS DAM will be a priority activity
for the caBIG program and the SAIF ECCF governance process
to promote semantic harmonization across business processes
supported in the NCI inventory of services. Mapping existing caBIG
software capabilities to the BAM is another area of possible activity
to communicate where there is current tooling support and where
there are gaps.

As the model continues to mature, its utilization will likely expand
beyond informing NCI system requirements. Although it is not
possible to predict all of the ways in which the model will be
utilized, the CR BAM is likely a useful indicator for how the LS
BAM will be used in the future, as it shares much of the same
biomedical research—oriented target audience as the LS BAM. The
Mayo Clinic is using the CR model to direct the development
of functional requirements for the creation of software (Sharon
Elcombe, personal communication). As the CR BAM provides clear
descriptions of business processes, Wake Forest University uses the
model as a training tool for those who are unfamiliar with CR
actors, goals, processes and terminologies (Bob Morrell, personal
communication). This usage can be particularly helpful for those
in the role of business analyst, as the BAM can help identify the
appropriate personnel with whom to speak and formulate questions.
It is anticipated that the LS BAM and the overarching Translational
Medicine BAM will be used in a similar manner.

To facilitate system interoperability across the cancer research
enterprise, the LS BAM (and the LS DAM) can be used beyond
caBIG to support their requirements deﬁnition efforts. Common
business and information models provide a consistent understanding
of business processes and data to be collected and exchanged,
which should lower the barrier to interoperability. The model
may therefore be a resource to train software engineers, facilitate
development of standards and underpin software validation in many
organizations, such as cancer centers, commercial tool providers or
other large research institutions. To meet this goal, feedback from the

community will be required to ensure that the LS BAM accurately
models goals and activities of the LS domain; thus, members of
the LS research community are asked to review the model, provide
feedback and post questions (http://bit.ly/9DYSX1).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Short sequence motifs are an important class of
models in molecular biology, used most commonly for describing
transcription factor binding site specificity patterns. High-throughput
methods have been recently developed for detecting regulatory
factor binding sites in vivo and in vitro and consequently high-quality
binding site motif data are becoming available for increasing number
of organisms and regulatory factors. Development of intuitive tools
for the study of sequence motifs is therefore important.

iMotifs is a graphical motif analysis environment that allows
visualization of annotated sequence motifs and scored motif hits
in sequences. It also offers motif inference with the sensitive
NestedMICA algorithm, as well as overrepresentation and pairwise
motif matching capabilities. All of the analysis functionality is
provided without the need to convert between file formats or learn
different command line interfaces.

The application includes a bundled and graphically integrated
version of the NestedMICA motif inference suite that has no
outside dependencies. Problems associated with local deployment
of software are therefore avoided.

Availability: iMotifs is licensed with the GNU Lesser General Public
License v2.0 (LGPL 2.0). The software and its source is available
at http://wiki.github.com/m22/imotifs and can be run on Mac OS X
Leopard (lntel/PowerPC). We also provide a cross-platform (Linux,
OS X, Windows) LGPL 2.0 licensed library libxms for the Perl, Ruby,
R and Objective-C programming languages for input and output of
XMS formatted annotated sequence motif set files.

1 INTRODUCTION

Until recent years, studying sequence speciﬁcity of transcription
factors systematically has been limited to a relatively small number
of organisms and transcription factors. High—throughput protein—
DNA interaction assays such as protein binding microarrays (Berger
et al., 2006), bacterial one—hybrid screens (Meng et al., 2005), large
ChIP—chip studies and advances in motif inference algorithms and
tools has, however, caused an expansion of motif databases such as
UNI—PROBE (Newburger and Bulyk, 2009), TRANSFAC (Matys
et al., 2006) and JASPAR (Bryne, 2008).

Fig. 1. iMotifs can present motif sets and alignments. It integrates with the
OS X desktop’s previewing functionality and includes a number of analysis
tools including an integrated NestedMICA motif inference tool.

Sequence motif analysis tools can be hard to deploy and use
locally. Many commonly used software packages have therefore
been made available as web applications (Mahony and Benos,
2007; Thomas—Chollier et al., 2008). Public servers can, however,
be limited in the CPU time given to users which can rule out
their use for large—scale studies. Data exchange and usability can
also be a challenge. Therefore, we have created an OS X—based
desktop software package for sequence motif analysis that is easy to
install and update. Compared with previously published desktop—
based cis—regulatory sequence analysis tools such as TOUCAN
(Aerts et al., 2003) or Sockeye (Montgomery et al., 2004), iMotifs
is more focused on Visualization and computation of sequence
motifs, although it also supports Visualizing scored motif matches
in sequences.

1.1 Features

iMotifs is designed for Visualization and analysis of cis—regulatory
motifs and sequences. It can be used to retrieve sequences (e.g.
for a coregulated group of genes), infer cis—regulatory motifs from
them and score sequences with motif models, Visualize them and
their scored matches and compare them against other motifs (Fig. 1
shows the core functionality). A tutorial is included on the web site
for common tasks (see Availability). Motifs can be manipulated
and moved between sets by dragging and dropping, and ﬁltered
using keyword searches. Summary statistics such as entropy, column

count or distance from closest pair can also be shown alongside.
Free form key—value pair metadata such as database identiﬁers,
species or notes can be Viewed and edited. PDF export and printing
is available. Import and export of TRANSFAC formatted motif ﬁles
is also possible.

iMotifs can be used to retrieve sequences from the Ensembl
database (Hubbard et al., 2009). The retrieved sequences can
be aligned either to transcription start sites (putative promoter
sequence) or ends (e.g. for micro—RNA seed ﬁnding), and they
can be ﬁltered by gene identiﬁers. The retrieval tool can fetch
speciﬁc sequence regions using GFF formatted annotation ﬁles,
and includes speciﬁc support for ranking and retrieving regions of
interest based on ChIP—seq ’peaks’: MACS (Zhang et al., 2008),
FindPeaks (Fejes et al., 2008) and SWEMBL formats are supported.
Sequences are optionally processed to mask repeats and translated
sequence.

iMotifs supports the quick previewing and thumbnailing service
native to OS X (QuickLook). Previewing is especially useful for
browsing sequence motif sets stored remotely (e.g. on a remote
cluster) as no manual transfer or ﬁle opening is needed. An
automated software update mechanism is included.

Many common motif analysis tasks are supported. These include
ﬁnding closest matching and reciprocally matching motif pairs
between two motif sets with the distance metric and algorithm
described in Down et al. (2007). Motif multiple alignments can
be Visualized and computed with a greedy gapless motif multiple
alignment algorithm. Motif inference experiments can be run
with the integrated NestedMICA (Down and Hubbard, 2005) tool
simply by dragging FASTA formatted sequence ﬁles to iMotifs.
Downstream analyses such as motif scanning, overrepresentation
analysis and motif hit score cutoff assignment as described in (Down
et al., 2007) are also possible. Analysis tasks are run in parallel
without blocking the user interacting with the application.

1.2 Interoperability

Although iMotifs itself works only on computers running Mac OS
X, the analysis tools developed for and included in iMotifs are cross—
plaform (Java based) and depend only on libraries included with the
package. Most analysis functions are implemented by stand—alone
command—line programs. This makes it possible to rapidly integrate
unmodiﬁed tools into iMotifs. The included analysis tools can also
be run on any UNIX system without iMotifs.

We feel that the use of a standard format for exchanging sequence
motif data is beneﬁcial for the research community, given the
literally hundreds of motif inference tools and databases that are
available [reviewed in Das and Dai (2007)]. To encourage the take
up of a standard ﬁle format for motifs, we provide a programming
interface for the input and output of the annotated motif ﬁle format
XMS for the Perl, Ruby, R and Objective—C languages. The Perl and
R libraries can also be used to Visualize sequence logos.

2 CONCLUSION

We have created an integrated desktop application for short sequence
motif analysis. It incorporates visualization, inference, alignment
and comparison tools. The application widens the user base of
sequence motif analysis tools and can improve the productivity of
researchers working with sequence motif data. We aim to integrate
with more sequence motif analysis tools and web services and to
develop further the already included basic protein motif Visualization
and inference support.

We also encourage the introduction of a standard format for
exchange of sequence motif data by providing conversion utilities
and an API for input and output of XMS motif set ﬁles for a number
of common bioinformatics programming languages.

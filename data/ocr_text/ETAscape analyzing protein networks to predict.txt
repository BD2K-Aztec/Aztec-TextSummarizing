ABSTRACT

Summary: Most proteins lack experimentally validated functions.
To address this problem, we implemented the Evolutionary Trace
Annotation (ETA) method in the Cytoscape network visualization
environment. The result is the ETAscape plugin, which builds
a structural genomics network based on local structural and
evolutionary similarities among proteins and then globally diffuses
known annotations across the resulting network. The plugin displays
these novel functional annotations, their confidence, the molecular
basis for individual matches and the set of matches that lead to a
prediction.

Availability: The ETA Network Plugin is available publicly for
download at http://mammoth.bcm.tmc.edu/networks/.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Structural Genomics Initiative (SGI) generates abundant
structural data (Erdin et al., 2011; Valencia, 2005), but many of these
structures lack annotation (Redfern et al., 2008). Computational
methods that match small structural motifs of functionally important
residues (a template) and suggest a function when the geometry is
close enough (Laskowski et al., 2005; Redfem et al., 2009) are
an especially promising way to approach this problem. A template
can be constructed from prior knowledge of functional residues
and mechanisms, or it can be created de now by Evolutionary
Trace (ET) analysis, which predicts functionally relevant amino
acids and pinpoints functional sites using evolutionary principles
(Lichtarge et al., 1996). ET accuracy has been thoroughly tested both
experimentally (Adikesavan et al., 2011; Rodriguez et al., 2010) and
computationally (Mihalek et al., 2004; Res et al., 2005).
Evolutionary Trace Annotation (ETA) ﬁrst maps the evolutionary
importance of each residue onto a structure and selects a cluster of
important surface residues as the template. It then seeks a match that
is similar both geometrically and evolutionarily in protein structures
with known function. These ETA templates usually overlap with

catalytic sites (Ward et al., 2008) and identify function with 87%
accuracy at 61% coverage (Kristensen et al., 2008).

Using a network in which structures form the nodes and
ETA matches form the edges helps to overcome limitations
from sparse functional data. We make predictions by allowing
Enzyme Commision (EC) numbers to ‘diffuse’ through the network
according to the cost function:

Zm—mzwzwmﬁ—mz (1)
l 1,]
where the elements of y are 1, 0 or —1 depending on whether a
protein is known to have, known not to have or is unknown to
have a particular EC number. After minimization, f contains the
‘diffused’ values. The ﬁrst term reﬂects the desire to not lose known
information, and penalizes nodes whose function differs before and
after diffusion. The second term reﬂects the fact that we expect
neighboring proteins in this network to have similar functions,
and punishes neighbors where this is not the case according to
the edge weight. Repeating this process for all ECs yields a
prediction for each possible function at each node. By normalizing
the prediction scores across all nodes with unknown function, we
create a prediction conﬁdence. In benchmarks, the accuracy of this
ETA diffusion network was >97% at 50% coverage, allowing the
prediction and experimental conﬁrmation of the function of an
unannotated Staphylococcus aureus protein (Venner et al., 2010).
This method is now made widely available and more transparent
by embedding it into the Cytoscape network visualization
environment (Smoot et al., 2011). The ETAscape plugin allows
users to view ETA networks, add proteins, make novel predictions,
as well as view annotations, ETA templates and protein structures,
adding to a public suite of ET tools that make functional site analysis
and function prediction transparent (Lua and Lichtarge, 2010; Ward
et al., 2009).

2 OVERVIEW OF ETASCAPE

The plugin is available from mammoth.bcm.tmc.edu/networks. All
commands are available as menu options, and a manual and tutorial
video are available from the download page. A starting network of
ETA matches between a subset of the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
ﬁltered for 90% sequence identity (Berman et al., 2000) is included
with the plugin. Node colors are based on known enzymatic function
and the layout clusters similar proteins. ETA networks subdivide into

Fig. 1. Screen capture of the plugin. Nodes are proteins, with colors encoding the ﬁrst two EC numbers. Edges are ETA template matches and indicate local
structural and evolutionary similarity. Two unknown protein structures (yellow nodes in center) are highlighted and discussed in the Overview of ETAscape
section below. A Jmol window (top right) shows the protein structure for 2f2gB and its mutual template match to 1rth (2f2gB’s template is shown in blue

and 1rth’s is shown in red, purple indicates shared residues)

a large number of small networks due to the speciﬁcity ﬁlters. Right—
clicking a node provides links to PDBsum (Laskowski, 2009) and
the ET Server.

The ‘Add new node to Network’ menu option queries the ETA
Server (Ward et al., 2009), which opens in a browser and suggests
an ET template that the user may customize. This template is then
matched against proteins in the network and matches are ﬁltered as
described previously (Ward et al., 2008). Modiﬁed networks may
be saved and later reloaded.

Structures and ETA templates can be opened in Jmol (Hanson,
2010) windows by selecting nodes and running the ‘Show
Templates’ menu option. The ‘Run Diffusion’ menu option predicts
the function of unannotated proteins with our diffusion model
(Venner et al., 2010). Novel annotations and prediction conﬁdences
are available in the node attribute browser. The Show Inﬂuencing
Proteins menu command shows proteins with the largest inﬂuence
on the predicted function of the selected protein, often including
nodes with strong indirect connections. After making predictions,
users can export them to a ﬁle.

As an example, the plugin predicts that a protein expressed from
gene locus At3g16990 in Arabidopsis thaliana (PDB ID 2f2gB), an
SGI protein of unknown function, is a thiamine pyridinylase with
Enzyme Classiﬁcation number EC 2.5.1.2. (Fig. 1). Although the
direct matches lack functional annotation, the software arrives at
this prediction by diffusing the function across the intermediate

links. There is one other function present in the subnetwork in
proximity to the query protein (Aminopyrimidine aminohydrolase,
EC 3.5.99.2). Interestingly, even though they are distinct reactions,
both functions share the substrate Thiamine, possibly explaining the
detected template similarity. 2f2ng direct matches are well below
the reliable homology range with sequence identities of 16% with
1rth and 14% with 1z72B. As observed previously (Ward et al.,
2008), the direct matches share overall structural similarity: many
of the proteins in this cluster belong to the CATH heme oxygenase
superfamily.

3 CONCLUSIONS

The ETAscape plugin extends an existing suite of protein function
annotation tools to infer functional residues, identify functional sites
and predict protein function (Lua and Lichtarge, 2010; Ward et al.,
2009). This tool pairs state—of—the—art network analysis with network
visualization, putting the ability to generate novel predictions into
the hands of researchers. Perhaps more importantly, it provides
insight into the basis for those predictions.

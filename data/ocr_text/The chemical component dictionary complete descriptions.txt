Abstract

Summary: The Chemical Component Dictionary (CCD) is a chemical reference data resource
that describes all residue and small molecule components found in Protein Data Bank (PDB)
entries. The CCD contains detailed chemical descriptions for standard and modified amino acids/
nucleotides, small molecule ligands and solvent molecules. Each chemical definition includes
descriptions of chemical properties such as stereochemical assignments, chemical descriptors,
systematic chemical names and idealized coordinates. The content, preparation, validation and dis—
tribution of this CCD chemical reference dataset are described.

Availability and implementation: The CCD is updated regularly in conjunction with the scheduled
weekly release of new PDB structure data. The CCD and amino acid variant reference datasets
are hosted in the public PDB ftp repository at ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers/
components.cif.gz, ftp://ftp.\Mdib.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers/aa—variants—v1.cif.gz, and its mir—
ror sites, and can be accessed from http://wwpdb.org.

1 Introduction

 

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the single worldwide repository of
information about the 3D structures of biological macromolecules
(Berman et 61]., 2003). PDB structures of macromolecules and
macromolecular—ligand complexes provide direct experimental in-
sights into protein function. These structures provide essential infor—
mation for the understanding of biochemical processes and are
critical data for structure—based drug design studies. PDB structure
data are also central to the understanding the energetics of intermo-
lecular interactions among proteins and nucleic acids, structure

classification and structure prediction. The knowledge obtained
through the study of 3D structure data is key to deducing the role of
a protein or nucleic acid in human health and disease. To enable this
rich interpretation of structural data requires accurate and consist—
ent annotation of the chemical identities and nomenclatures for all
of the constituent molecules in the PDB archive.

The individual monomers within a polymer, individual ligands
and solvent molecules form the principal building blocks or chem-
ical components within a PDB entry. These chemical components
form the basis for the high—level macromolecular descriptions of

polymers and complexes in the PDB archive. Over the years, mo—
lecular descriptions that fully characterize all unique chemical com-
ponents in the PDB structures are maintained and made available as
part of the PDB archive. These molecular definitions are assembled
in a reference data resource called the PDB chemical component dic—
tionary (CCD). The current release of the CCD contains over 18 500
molecular definitions.

The CCD is maintained by the worldwide Protein Data Bank
(waDB), which consists of organizations that act as deposition,
data processing and distribution centers for PDB data. The waDB
partners are the RCSB PDB (Berman et al., 2000); PDB in Europe,
PDBe (Gutmanas et 61]., 2014); PDB in Japan, PDBj (Kinjo et al.,
2012) and BioMagResBank, BMRB (Markley et 61]., 2008).

2 Methods

2.1 Data representation and organization

The detailed representation of the chemical components maintained
in the PDB chemical dictionary has evolved over the 40—year history
of the PDB archive. The early PDB chemical component representa—
tion is captured in the PDB format file as shown in Figure 1. The in-
formation in a structure entry in the original PDB file format
includes an identifier code (1—3 alphanumeric characters), atom con—
nection table, atom count, formula, molecular name and synonyms.
The identifier codes for standard amino acids (e.g. ALA, GLY, TRP)
and a small number of common ligands (e.g. adenosine triphos—
phate) are represented using the well—known three—character codes;
however, for the majority of components, CCD identifier (ID) codes
have no chemical significance. For each atom, a connection table
provides the count and a list of adjacent atoms. This connection
table also defines a unique name for each atom in the chemical com-
ponent. Atom names in the original PDB file format contain up to
four characters. Corresponding atoms for all instances of the chem—
ical component in the archive share the same atom naming. These
early chemical descriptors did not define stereochemistry or bond
orders and lacked additional information such as formal charge,
molecular weight or SMILES and InChI representation of the
molecule.

Following a major nomenclature standardization effort in 2007
(Henrick et 61]., 2008), the PDB introduced a dictionary of chemical
definitions with much richer content. An example of a current mo—
lecular definition is illustrated in Figure 2(a—d).

The definition is encoded using the macromolecular crystallo—
graphic information framework (mmCIF) syntax (Fitzgerald et 61].,
2005). This is also the primary archival syntax used to store PDB

structure entries. This syntax provides for two simple organizational
styles: key—value pairs (Fig. 2a) and tabular format (Fig. 2b—d). A
typical chemical definition contains between 50 and 60 unique items
of data.

The data names used in the chemical definition example are
described separately in the PDB exchange data dictionary (PDBx;
Westbrook et 61]., 2005). This metadata resource defines all data
items used in PDB data entries and reference data. Just as a conven—
tional dictionary, the PDBx dictionary provides definitions and ex—
amples for each item of PDB data. In addition to these semantics,
the PDBx dictionary defines properties such as data type, controlled
vocabularies, boundary values and parent—child relationships.
Collectively, these properties enable the software to verify the data
integrity within individual chemical definitions and maintain data
consistency between chemical reference data and PDB data entries.
The PDBx dictionary is maintained as an electronic metadata re—
source using the syntax and technology of mmCIF at http://mmcif.
wwpdb.org.

Data categories describing chemical components are defined in
the CHEM_COMP_GROUP category group. High—level molecular
descriptions of each component are presented in CHEM_COMP
data category that includes data items describing the general features
of the chemical component as a whole as shown in Figure 2a and
Supplementary Table 81a.

This category provides identifying information including: the
unique identifier (1—3 alphanumeric characters) assigned by the
PDB, any one—letter—code monomer abbreviation, molecular name
and synonyms. The molecular name is typically assigned a computed
systematic name [ACD/Name (Advanced Chemistry Development,
2007)]. Well—known common names, trade names or other alterna—
tive names may be included as synonyms. The formal charge and
molecular formula are also provided. The molecular formula is pre—
sented using the Hill system convention (Hill, 1900).

A component type distinguishes polymer, non—polymer and solv—
ent components. For peptide and nucleic acid polymer components,
the component type further describes polymer linking behavior. For
instance, for most standard amino acids the linking type is ‘L-pep-
tide linking’.

For polymer components related to a standard amino acid or nu—
cleotide by a simple chemical modification, the parent standard resi—
due is identified. For components that have recognizable internal
substructure, the list of constituent component identifiers is
included. For instance, Lisinopril (CCD ID LPR) has the subcompo—
nent sequence ‘CLT LYS PRO’ for the substituent components
4—phenyl—butanoic acid (CLT), lysine (LYS) and proline (PRO).

and versions used to compute each name and descriptor

Accession details are also given in this data category. In addition to
the CCD ID assigned to the component, the PDB ID for the entry con-
taining a representative example of the molecule may be provided. If
the chemical component definition has been replaced, the CCD ID of
the superseding chemical component is provided. Other special details
concerning the chemical definition or the associated representative
model atomic coordinates are also included in this definition category.

The CHEM_COMP_ATOM data category describes the atom—
level features of the chemical component (Fig. 2b; Supplementary
Table 81b). This includes the atom type symbol and atom nomencla—
ture in current use in the PDB archive. Atoms names for standard
amino acids and nucleotides follow IUPAC recommendations

(IUPAC Commission on Macromolecular Nomenclature, 1979)
with the exception of the well—established convention for C-terminal
atoms OXT and HXT. In early PDB entries, an alternative atom no—
menclature was used and this prior atom nomenclature was also
included in definitions where the nomenclature has changed
(Henrick et al., 2008). For standard amino acids, additional molecu—
lar definitions have been created to specify common protonation
variants. This provides a naming reference for experimental meth-
ods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which typically re-
port these additional hydrogen atoms.

A set of model coordinates from a single experimental entry and
a computed set of ideal coordinates are provided. Hydrogen atoms

are computationally added to the experimental coordinates if not
present in the modeled structure. Computed coordinates are ob—
tained from the programs CORINA (Sadowski and Gasteiger, 1994)
or OpenEye/Omega (Bostrom et al., 2003). Cahn—Ingold—Prelog
(CIP) stereochemical assignments (Cahn et al., 1966) and aromatic
annotations are recorded for each atom. For chemical components
with recognizable subcomponent architecture, the subcomponent
CCD ID code is specified for each atom. Leaving atom positions are
identified for components in which covalent linkages are observed
in PDB entries. Leaving atoms identify atoms that are cleaved in the
formation of covalent bonds with other chemical components. This
data item identifies those atoms that are cleaved in covalent inter—
actions observed in PDB entries.

Bonding information is provided in CHEM_COMP_BOND data
category (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Table Slc). Each bond is specified
as a pair of connected atoms where the atoms are identified by the
atom names declared in the CHEM_COMP_ATOM data category.
Bond types (i.e. single, double, triple), CIP stereochemical assign—
ments and aromatic assignments are recorded for each bond.

Figure 2d and Supplementary Tables Sld and e illustrate add—
itional details describing identifiers and descriptors related to the
chemical definition. Descriptors and identifiers are accompanied by
the provenance details such as software application name and version
used to compute the quantity. Each chemical definition commonly in-
cludes SMILES, Standard InChI and InChI key descriptors (Heller
et al., 2013; Weininger, 1988). SMILES descriptors are calculated and
reported using multiple programs (ACD/Name), CACTVS (Ihlenfeldt
et al., 1992), OpenEye OEChemTk (OpenEye Scientific Software Inc.,
2007) owing to differences in the approach to canonicalization
implemented by these programs. Systematic chemical names are also
computed for each component (ACD/Name) and these and other
synonyms are included as chemical identifiers.

Audit and revision history details (Supplementary Table 1f) re-
port the details of any revisions to the existing definitions. The type
of revision in each audit record is reported using a precise controlled
vocabulary. This makes it possible to distinguish changes involving
the addition of molecular synonyms or more substantive corrections
to nomenclature or chemical structure.

2.2 Technical validation

A variety of software tools are used to maintain the CCD and to
provide for consistent chemical representation across the PDB
archive.

Referential integrity and data consistency within chemical com—
ponent definitions are maintained using the constraints such as
parent-child relationships, boundary values and controlled vocabu—
laries defined in the underlying metadata definitions from the PDBx
exchange dictionary. Chemical dictionary maintenance software
tools provide checks for consistency of chemical formula and for-
mula weight, atom name and type consistency, unusual chemical va—
lences and non—bonded atoms.

Multiple software libraries are used to calculate key annotations.
In cases where coordinate data are required to define the chemical
structure of a component, the perception of covalent bond types
from the 3D experimental coordinates is based on a consensus of re—
sults obtained from OpenBabel (O’Boyle et al., 2011) and
OEChemTK (Stahl and Mauser, 2005) libraries. Both the CACTVS
and OpenEye OEChemTK libraries are used to compute CIP
rule—based stereochemical and aromatic annotations from model
coordinated data. When a consensus between these methods is not
obtained, the results are subject to a manual review. Differences are
typically due to unusual or strained geometries.

Chemical substructure search tools are used for matching and
aligning covalent chemical structures in molecular definitions
(Cordella et al., 2004; Young et al., 2013). Searching new chemical
structures against the existing collection of definitions avoids dupli-
cation of molecular definitions.

Audit records are maintained to track changes in each definition.
Revisions of individual chemical components definitions are
archived in the CVS version control system.

2.3 Usage and maintenance of the CCD

The CCD is an important validation resource in the processing of
new PDB entries as it serves as a reference for nomenclature, stereo—
chemistry and structure.

As waDB members curate new experimental structure depos—
itions, a principal task is to determine the accurate chemical descrip—
tions of all of the molecular components within the entry (Fig. 3;
Young et al., 2013). A deposited macromolecular structure is
decomposed into a set of constituent molecules. Within the experi-
mental resolution of a typical macromolecular structure determin—
ation, there may be considerable latitude in precise details of any
observed chemical moiety. Where possible, chemical components
are chosen to correspond to realizable molecules such as neutral off—
the shelf reagents. To the extent possible, the molecular identity is
verified with the contributing scientist as part of the deposition and
annotation of PDB entries. Hydrogen atom positions and charge de—
tails may be reported for NMR and some high—resolution X—ray and
neutron diffraction experiments. In such cases, the protonation vari—
ant dictionary is used as a naming reference for protonated hydro—
gen atoms on standard amino acids. Separate chemical definitions
are created for ligands with a reported charged state.

Atomic coordinate data or other chemical data provided with a
deposited entry are used to establish the covalent structure of each
chemical component. The covalent structures are compared with
known chemical components within entries in the current archive.
Molecules corresponding to known components are standardized
for nomenclature while new components are added to the CCD con—
taining all observed components.

The CCD is updated regularly in conjunction with the scheduled
weekly release of new PDB structure data. The CCD and amino acid
variant reference datasets are hosted in the public PDB ftp repository
ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers/components.cif.gz, ftp://
ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers/aa—variants—v1.cif.gz, its mir-
ror sites, and accessed from http://wwpdb.org.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Alternative splicing is central for cellular processes and
substantially increases transcriptome and proteome diversity. Aberrant
splicing events often have pathological consequences and are asso-
ciated with various diseases and cancer types. The emergence of
next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides an exciting new
technology to analyse alternative splicing on a large scale. However,
algorithms that enable the analysis of alternative splicing from
short-read sequencing are not fully established yet and there are still
no standard solutions available for a variety of data analysis tasks.
Results: We present a new method and software to predict genes that
are differentially spliced between two different conditions using
RNA-seq data. Our method uses geometric angles between the high
dimensional vectors of exon read counts. With this, differential splicing
can be detected even if the splicing events are composed of higher
complexity and involve previously unknown splicing patterns. We
applied our approach to two case studies including neuroblastoma
tumour data with favourable and unfavourable clinical courses. We
show the validity of our predictions as well as the applicability of our
method in the context of patient clustering. We verified our predictions
by several methods including simulated experiments and complemen-
tary in silico analyses. We found a significant number of exons with
specific regulatory splicing factor motifs for predicted genes and a
substantial number of publications linking those genes to alternative
splicing. Furthermore, we could successfully exploit splicing informa-
tion to cluster tissues and patients. Finally, we found additional evi-
dence of splicing diversity for many predicted genes in normalized
read coverage plots and in reads that span exon—exon junctions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Alternative splicing is a central cellular process that produces
different mRNA isoforms from a single gene. The qualitative
and quantitative identiﬁcation of such isoforms is essential for
understanding the different roles of alternatively spliced genes in
a cell. In addition, the detection of disease-speciﬁc isoforms is an
important task because aberrant splicing is known to be respon-
sible for various diseases (reviewed in Kim et al., 2008a) and
associated with different cancer types (e.g. Christoﬂ( et al.,
2008; Venables et al., 2009).

Isoform structures and abundances can be inferred from
short sequence reads generated by RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq). In contrast to hybridization-based approaches
using, for example, microarrays, such sequencing-based
approaches better allow for the detection of previously un-
known splicing events and can avoid cross-hybridization and
limited dynamic range (reviewed in Wang et al., 2009).
Computational methods for analysing differential expression
and differential splicing from RNA-seq data “are only begin-
ning to emerge’ (reviewed in Garber et al., 2011). Existing
methods detect alternative splicing mainly by considering
sequencing reads that map uniquely to single isoforms or by
assembling transcripts and estimating the most likely isoform
abundance levels according to the given sequencing reads [an
overview and discussion of limitations is given in Martin and
Wang (2011) and Garber et a]. (2011)]. Short-read assemblers
have been developed for genome and transcriptome assembly
[e.g. Velvet (Zerbino and Birney, 2008), Scripture (Guttman
et al., 2010), Cufﬂinks (Trapnell et al., 2010) and others (re-
viewed in Martin and Wang, 2011)]. Despite the success of such
approaches, assembly artifacts remain a common phenomenon
(Birney, 2011), and in the context of transcriptome assembly,
many reads cannot be assigned to single isoforms unambigu-
ously. When trying to interpret these reads, different sets of

possible assemblies are theoretically compatible with the
sequencing data (Garber et al., 2011), and this leads to the
misassembly of false transcripts and a wrong estimation of spe-
ciﬁc isoform expression levels. This problem becomes more
severe in the presence of complex alternative splicing patterns
and depends on factors like the sequencing depth and the
length of generated reads. These considerations are also the
basis for recent developments that aim at identifying alternative
splicing patterns from De-Bruijn graphs without actually assem-
bling complete isoforms (Sacomoto et al., 2012) or methods
that integrate RNA-seq data with existing gene annotations
and ESTs to predict more reliable splice graphs and annotate
ambiguous events as unresolved (Rogers et al., 2012). A sys-
tematic assessment of transcriptome assemblies is difﬁcult be-
cause appropriate quality metrics have not been established yet
and require a well-deﬁned gold standard that is difﬁcult to ﬁnd
(Martin and Wang, 2011). During the revision of this article,
Anders et a]. (2012) published a tool called ‘DEXSeq’ for the
detection of differential exon usage from RNA-seq data. Rather
than using an assembly approach and comparing abundance
levels of predicted transcripts, DEXSeq avoids the assembly
step and calculates P—values for every annotated exon (or
parts of exons if an exon modiﬁcation event can be derived
from the provided annotation). Similarly, our method directly
identiﬁes genes with signiﬁcantly altered ratios of (potentially
unknown) isoforms. The power to detect signiﬁcant expression
differences depends on the number of available reads and there-
fore on the sequencing depth and length of the region of inter-
est. Regions that are speciﬁc to a single isoform (like cassette
exons) are often much shorter compared to full transcripts, and
the detection of signiﬁcant differences may be severely ham-
pered by their low number of reads. Besides this, the number
of statistical tests that are required to detect previously known
and unknown events for all expressed genes in the observed
cells raises to such an extent that makes it challenging to
avoid high false-positive levels or to reach statistical signiﬁcance
after using multiple testing correction. A critical aspect for all
methods is the potentially complex composition of isoforms.
Some genes generate many different transcripts in varying
abundances that comprise a large variety of different combin-
ations of exons. RNA-seq data gives the opportunity at hand to
yield a global insight into this situation. Consequently, we de-
veloped a new method (and implemented it into the software
tool ‘SplicingCompass’) to predict genes that show differential
splicing taking all of their exons into account. To our know-
ledge, our method is the ﬁrst approach that detects differential
splicing on a gene level by taking into account all exons of a
gene at once instead of considering single exons independently.
This reduces the number of statistical tests considerably and
better accounts for combined effects. We applied our method
to high-throughput sequences of the transcriptomes from
human brain and liver samples as well as from neuroblastoma
patients with low-risk and high-risk tumours and to simulated
data. In addition, we present results that show the validity of
our method as well as its applicability in the context of clus-
tering tissues and cancer patients.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data

We analysed two RNA-seq datasets and compared high-throughput se-
quences of the transcriptomes from four human brain and seven liver
samples [data published in Au et a]. (2010); Blekhman et a]. (2010) and
via the ‘Human BodyMap project’ from Illumina] as well as 14 neuro-
blastoma patients with low-risk and high-risk tumours {i.e. seven favour-
able [stage 4S according to the International Neuroblastoma Staging
System (Brodeur et al., 1993)] and seven unfavourable [stage 4] outcome}
(Supplementary Table S1). In addition, we used the simulation engine
BEERS (Benchmarker for Evaluating the Effectiveness of RNA-Seq
Software) (Grant 61 al., 2011) to simulate RNA-seq reads of known tran-
scripts and introduced a variety of simulated differential splicing events
(see Supplementary Note 1a and Supplementary Figs S1 and S2 for a
detailed description).

2.2 Mapping and pre-processing

TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2009) was used for a splice junction sensi-
tive mapping of sequence reads to the reference genome UCSC hg19.
We used default parameters but did not allow for multihits. To nor-
malize reads for different sequencing depths, we divided read counts by
a library size parameter as described previously (Anders and Huber,
2010). To remove genes that are barely expressed, we calculated
RPKM values (‘reads per kilobase of exon model per million
mapped reads”) (Mortazavi et al., 2008) on an exon level and
included genes that had at least one exon in the union transcript
that was above a threshold of ﬁve RPKM averaged over the samples.
Union transcripts were deﬁned as described in the following section.
We also excluded genes with only one annotated exon. With this,
127634 (79819) of 182291 exons in 10987 (6944) of 18121
annotated genes satisﬁed the criterion in the neuroblastoma (brain/
liver) comparison.

2.3 Splicing angles

For every gene g, we deﬁned a union transcript mg 2 (61, ...,en) by
combining all exons e,- from all corresponding isoforms that were
annotated in Consensus CDS coding sequences (CCDS) (Pruitt
et al., 2009). In the following, we represented the expression of that
gene as a vector 17g, called read count vector. Every component of that
read count vector corresponded to the number of sequencing reads Re,
that uniquely aligned with a given exon 6,- of the union transcript:
17g 2 (Rel, ...,Ren). Hence, 17g combined the expression levels of all
isoforms of g. Systematic differences in alternative splicing affect the
relative proportions between exon-expression levels and thereby deter-
mine the orientation of read count vectors. Hence, we used the geo-
metric angles between read count vectors as a means to measure
differences in alternative splicing. Furthermore, we added additional
dimensions to 17g for all observed exon—exon connections based on
junction reads found by TopHat (Fig. 1). This generally increased
the sensitivity of our method and helped to identify even small differ-
ences that arise from exon modiﬁcation events like alternative 5’ /3’
exons (see Supplementary Note 2 for a more detailed description). If
a gene has a constant composition of isoforms, i.e. the ratios between
isoforms do not change between conditions, the read count vectors of
that gene will be roughly parallel between conditions yielding a low
angle between them, even if the overall gene expression levels differ
(see Supplementary Fig. S3). Therefore, our method inherently distin-
guishes between differences in overall gene expression and differences
in alternative splicing.

vectors bring out splicing diversity between the different conditions

2.4 Detection of differentially spliced candidate genes

To detect differentially spliced genes between two conditions c1 and c2

tion (1)

and tested if splicing angles within conditions were signiﬁcantly smaller
than splicing angles between conditions. (IDgHi, gnj is the angle between sam-
ples n,- and nj- for gene g. vgni is the read count vector for gene g and sample
n,-. We performed two tests per gene. To reduce false negatives from high
dimensional vectors, we restricted the dimensions of the read count vec-
tors in the ﬁrst test to exons for which a skipping or modiﬁcation event
was generally supported by junction reads and then used their pairwise
splicing angles to test if these events were condition speciﬁc. Because
alternative splicing events could not always be recognized from reported
junction reads [Transcript variation affecting the ﬁrst/last exon(s) do not
give rise to simple junction read patterns that normally span nested exons
and would be missed with the ﬁrst test alone. In addition, tools that
discover splice junction reads still suffer from false negatives (Rogers
et al., 2012)], we performed a second test that included all exons and
all exon—exon junctions from the union-transcript. We assessed statistical
signiﬁcance with a one-sided t-test and used the Benjamini—Hochberg
procedure for multiple testing correction (Benjamini and Hochberg,
1995).

2.5 Veriﬁcation of candidate genes

A major issue in verifying differential splicing predictions is the lack of an
established gold standard. Quantitative PCR can be used to experimen-
tally verify a subset of genes but in general the performance of prediction
methods is largely assessed by simulations. We used the simulation engine
BEERS to simulate a variety of artiﬁcial differential splicing events but
also pursued additional in silico strategies to assess the quality of our
biological predictions. This included the following:

0 Evaluation of splicing factor motifs, which are essential to speciﬁc-
ally enhance or silence the splicing of alternative exons in a
tissue-speciﬁc manner (sections 2.6 and 3.2).

0 Assessment of the number of publications found in an unbiased
automatic PubMed search (sections 2.7 and 3.3).

o Clustering of tissues and patients based on splicing information (sec-
tions 2.8 and 3.4).

0 Assessment of different kinds of evidence of splicing diversity for
predicted genes such as reads that span exon—exon junctions and
exonic read coverage plots that were normalized for differences in
gene expression (sections 2.9 and 3.1).

2.6 Splicing factor motifs

To detect splicing factor motifs, we used the R packages ‘Biostrings’ and
‘BSgenome’ (http://www.bioconductor.org) and scanned for all binding
motifs characterized in the database SpliceAid2 (Piva et al., 2012). We
used the ‘matchPattern’ function without mismatches or indels and
scanned for motifs around exon—intron boundaries (100 bps up- and
down-stream) from all exons that were analysed with our method. For
every splicing factor, we calculated a confusion matrix comprising the
number of exons with and without nearby motifs in predicted versus
remaining genes. As a control, an identical analysis was performed with
the same number of exons from random genes. We assessed statistical
signiﬁcances with Chi-square tests and corrected for multiple testing with
the Benjamini—Hochberg procedure. P-values for differential expression
of genes that encode for splicing factors were calculated from the
RNA-seq data with DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010).

2.7 PubMed search

We performed an automatic PubMed search and counted for every pre-
dicted gene the number of publications with a co-occurrence of the cor-
responding gene symbol and the term ‘alternative splicing”. A control
search was performed with an equal number of random genes that
were sampled from the same ﬁltered gene set (i.e. only genes were
sampled for the control that were actually tested by SplicingCompass
and retained after expression and single-exon ﬁltering). The control set
was drawn such that the candidate set and control set were disjunctive
and no gene was sampled twice (i.e. the predicted candidate genes were
removed from the control set and sampling was done without
replacement).

2.8 Clustering

To demonstrate that functional information was captured by
SplicingCompass within the different splicing proﬁles, and not merely
by differential gene expression, we performed an alternative splicing-
based hierarchical clustering of neuroblastoma patients and brain versus
liver samples with the genes identiﬁed by SplicingCompass. Analogously
to the detection of differential splicing events, we clustered using all pair-
wise angles between samples. In addition, we then removed all genes that
were signiﬁcant in a gene-expression ranking based on the commonly
used RPKM measure (i.e. we removed all genes with a RPKM-based

P—value 5 0.1) and repeated the clustering with this reduced set. For clus-
tering, Pearson distance and average linkage was used in all cases.

2.9 Read coverage plots

To visually compare exonic read count proﬁles in terms of alternative
splicing, we normalized the number of reads Rem}. that mapped to all
exons e,- from gene g in sample n]. We normalized for exon lengths and the
overall gene expression level of g in a given sample nj- by

In which lei was the length of exon e,-, and g2"? was the overall gene
expression level of gene g in sample n]. We estimated gﬁjq’ by the
median number of length-normalized reads that mapped to the exons
of the union transcript from gene g in the given sample. Equivalently,
we normalized and depicted the number of junction reads that TopHat
reported between all expressed regions (i.e. known and unknown exons)
of gene g.

 

2.10 Comparison with DEXSeq and Cufflinks

We compared the predictions made by SplicingCompass, DEXSeq
(Anders et al., 2012) and Cufﬂinks/Cuffdiff (Trapnell et al., 2010) for
the described simulated and biological datasets. To compare DEXSeq
with SplicingCompass (which assigns P—values to whole genes), we con-
sidered a gene differentially spliced in DEXSeq if at least one of its exons
was differentially used. For Cufﬂinks/Cuffdiff, we followed the steps
described in (Trapnell et al., 2012) and considered a gene differentially
spliced if any of the transcripts assembled for that gene was differentially
expressed according to Cuffdiff (irrespective of the fact if the assembled
transcripts correctly matched the simulated ones). Strictly speaking, this
deﬁnition does not only include transcript variation produced by the
splicing machinery but also transcript variation due to multiple promoter
and polyadenylation sites.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Differentially spliced genes

We predicted 1595 genes to be differentially spliced between
brain and liver samples and 24 genes to be differentially spliced
between neuroblastoma stages (P-value g 0.1 after Benjamini—
Hochberg correction, Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).
Supplementary Figure S4 exempliﬁes one top scoring gene pre-
dicted by our method that shows a clear exon exchange event.
The event is strongly supported by exon junction reads and in-
dependent annotation information from the UCSC alternative
splicing track (Karolchik et al., 2008). Read counts in the ﬁgure
are normalized as described in Methods (Section 2.9) and plotted
for all exons of the union transcript from that gene. Exon 7 is
speciﬁcally skipped in liver tissues, whereas exon 8 is speciﬁcally
skipped in brain tissues (SLC7A2 P—value = 10—32). The splicing
events are directly supported by splice junctions. According to
UCSC, exons 7 and 8 are known to undergo alternative splicing.
Another example that revealed a liver-speciﬁc exon modiﬁcation
event in the transcripts of the gene MAGIl is depicted in
Supplementary Figures S5a and S5b. MAGIl showed several
condition-speciﬁc splicing events that affected different exons.
One of these events speciﬁcally shortened exon 7 in liver samples.
We used Ingenuity (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com) and
tested for gene set enrichment in the categories ‘Diseases

and Disorders’, ‘Molecular and Cellular Functions’ and
‘Physiological System Development and Function’. We found
enrichments for ‘Neurological Disease’, ‘Cellular Growth and
Proliferation’ and ‘Cell Death and Survival’, which point at pro-
cesses important for brain tissues, while ‘Protein Synthesis’ and
‘Nucleic Acid Metabolism’ are central functions of the liver,
which also plays an important role in ‘Small Molecule
Biochemistry’ (see Supplementary Table S4). This shows that
SplicingCompass identiﬁed genes that are enriched in processes
relevant to the investigated tissues.

Most of the 24 genes that we predicted from the neuroblast-
oma data were known to undergo alternative splicing in general.
Many of the genes have been implicated in processes relevant to
tumour progression or neuronal events: UBE2V1 is involved in
cell cycle control and can cause transcriptional activation of the
human FOS proto-oncogene (Rothofsky and Lin, 1997). PELO
plays a role in maintaining genomic stability (Adham et al.,
2003), and ANKSlA affects the signalling pathway of growth
factors (Pandey et al., 2002). PCDHAC2 is a member of the
protocadherin alpha (Pchdh—a) gene family. It codes for a
neural cadherin—like cell adhesion protein, which is present at
synaptic junctions (\Nu and Maniatis, 1999). Different Pchdh—a
mRNAs are generated in a process that involves both differential
promoter activation and alternative splicing (Ribich et al., 2006).
Ribich et al. suggested that Pcdh—a proteins might serve as di-
verse but distinct synaptic tags that play an important role in
establishing the ‘identities’ of individual neurons (i.e. they are
critical in determining the highly speciﬁc interactions of syn-
apses). PIK3R1 codes for the regulatory subunit alpha of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. It inﬂuences tumour cell growth
and motility and is a potential therapeutic target in glioblastoma
multiforme (Weber et al., 2011). Multiple isoforms are annotated
for PIK3R1 that differ in the ﬁrst six to eight exons. Our analyses
suggest an increased expression of short isoforms that exclude
the ﬁrst six exons in stage 4S patients compared with stage 4
patients (see Supplementary Figs S6a and S6b). The short iso-
forms lack the SH3 domain that mediates speciﬁc protein—pro-
tein interactions (Koyama et al., 1993) as well as the Rho-Gap
domain that inﬂuences different regulators of the cytoskeleton
(Peck et al., 2002). CRTACl codes for the cartilage acidic
protein 1 and can be used as a biomarker to discriminate Chon-
drocytes from osteoblasts in humans (Steck et al., 2001).
A previously unknown isoform of CRTACl (CRTACl-B) has
been identiﬁed in brain tissue and RT-PCR conﬁrmed that both
isoforms (CRTACl-A and CRTACl-B) are being expressed in
human (Steck et al., 2007). The two isoforms differ by alternate
last exon usage (i.e. the most 3’ exon), which matches our
in-depth analyses of the read coverage derived from the neuro-
blastoma data (not shown). Only CRTACl-A contains a func-
tional O-glycosylation site resulting in a glycosylated isoform.
Recent studies in mice showed that the unglycosylated isoform
CRTACl-B (also called LOTUS) binds to Nogo receptor-l
(NgRl) and inhibits the binding of Nogo-A (Sato et al., 2011).
Nogo-A binding destabilizes the actin cytoskeleton of the nerve
cell and triggers a growth cone collapse. This induced growth
cone collapse leads to a stabilization of the CNS wiring at the
expense of plastic rearrangements and regeneration (Schwab,
2010) supporting the hypothesis for functional relevance in
neuroblastoma cells, which originated from the primitive

neural crest. Recent studies suggested that the carboxyl-terminal
region (UA/EC domain) is a functional domain of CRTACl
responsible for NgRl binding (Kurihara et al., 2012). In contrast
to the 3’ exon of CRTACl, which contains the O-glycosylation
site, the exons coding for the carboxyl—terminal region (UA/EC
domain) do not seem to be affected by alternative splicing dir-
ectly. CRTACl-A products could not be detected in mouse tis-
sues by rapid ampliﬁcation of cDNA ends (RACE) experiments
(Steck et al., 2007) suggesting that this isoform is not expressed in
mouse. To our knowledge, a possible inﬂuence of the
O-glycosylation motif on the binding to NgRl has therefore
not been investigated yet but seems to be a promising future
aspect, in particular in the context of alternative splicing of
neuroblastoma tumour cells.

3.2 Splicing factor motifs

During splicing, a protein complex known as the spliceosome
assembles on the pre-mRNA to remove introns and join exons.
This process is guided by short consensus motifs at the ends of
introns called splice sites. In addition, a complex interplay be-
tween trans—acting splicing factors and auxiliary cis-acting regu-
latory elements takes place. This is essential to ensure accurate
splicing and to achieve tightly regulated tissue-speciﬁc alternative
splicing. Cis-acting elements can function as silencers or enhan-
cers and are found in the vicinity of splice sites in introns and
exons. In general, alternative splicing is determined by the com-
bined effect of multiple positively and negatively acting elements,
and the fate of cassette exons is decided by the presence and
arrangement of surrounding motifs as well as the condition-
speciﬁc ratio and modiﬁcation status of splicing factor proteins
(splicing regulatory principles are reviewed in Matlin et al.,
2005). Therefore, we investigated if a signiﬁcant number of
exons with speciﬁc types of splicing factor motifs can be observed
in genes predicted by SplicingCompass (Supplementary Fig. S7).

For 9 out of 62 splicing factors, we found a signiﬁcant enrich-
ment or depletion of motif-associated exons (i.e. exons with at
least one binding motif of the speciﬁc factor in 100 bp up- or
down-stream of the exon—intron boundaries) in our predicted
genes from brain versus liver tissues. This strongly suggests a
special pattern of splicing regulation. For seven of the nine fac-
tors, we found an enrichment of motif-associated exons in our
gene list. The factors hnRNP K and SRp55 showed a signiﬁcant
depletion. Notably, hnRNP K has been described for its poten-
tial to act as a splicing silencer presumably by antagonizing the
binding or activity of nearby enhancers (Revil et al., 2009). A
depletion of silencer motifs might thus serve as a similar regula-
tory mechanism as an enrichment of enhancer motifs. As ex-
pected, a control analysis with the same number of exons from
random genes did not yield any signiﬁcant results. Many factors
with enriched motifs did not show a signiﬁcant difference in
corresponding gene expression values. These factors might
impose regulation in a more interrelated manner, and corres-
ponding protein activities may be regulated post-translationally.
For instance, Sam68 showed the most signiﬁcant enrichment
of motif-associated exons in our data but did not show differ-
ential gene expression. Sam68 has been described as ‘a proto-
type regulator of alternative splicing whose function depends
on protein modiﬁcation in response to extracellular cues’

(Matter et al., 2002). Matter et al. showed in detail that phos-
phorylation of Sam68 is crucial in regulating the alternative spli-
cing of a speciﬁc exon in CD44. For other factors that were
differentially expressed but did not show an enrichment of
motif-associated exons in the complete set of predicted genes, a
distinct pattern of binding motifs could still be observed in single
genes. For instance, we found an accumulation of motifs of the
tissue-speciﬁc splicing factor Fox-1 in the vicinity of differentially
spliced exons from SLC7A2 (Supplementary Fig. S4).

3.3 PubMed search

For 636 out of the 1595 candidate genes from the brain versus
liver comparison, our automatic literature search yielded at least
one publication with a co-occurrence of the corresponding gene
symbol and the term ‘alternative splicing’. This is signiﬁcantly
more than revealed by a control search with the same number of
random genes (482 out of 1595, Pearson’s Chi-squared P—value:
1.4e-08). For 72 candidate genes, we found more than 10 publi-
cations by automatic searching compared with 34 genes in the
random set. Supplementary Figure S8 shows the number of pub-
lications found for our candidate genes and the control set.

3.4 Clustering results

Splicing differences can serve as powerful biomarkers to discrim-
inate tissues and have a great potential to improve existing strati-
ﬁcation methods of cancer patients. In addition, the ability to
discriminate patients based on genes that do not show any dis-
tinct gene expression variation is supporting evidence for
post-transcriptional differences (caused by splicing) in the gene
set under consideration. For this reason, our clustering analyses
were also a means to test our method.

A hierarchical clustering analysis based on predicted genes
yielded two main clusters, which clearly separated all neuroblast-
oma patients according to their tumour stage (Supplementary
Fig. S9) and all brain from liver tissues (Supplementary
Fig. S10). Even after removing all genes with signiﬁcant differ-
ences in their overall expression levels (i.e. we removed all genes
with an RPKM-based P—value g 0.1), we could robustly cluster
tissues based on differentially spliced genes (Supplementary Figs
S11 and S12). As expected, an RPKM-based clustering with the
same reduced gene set did not yield meaningful clusters any more
(Supplementary Figs S13 and S14). This indicates that splicing
angles exploit post-transcriptional splicing information, which is
not apparent in gene-level RPKM values. Correspondingly, P-
values computed by SplicingCompass for differential splicing
only showed little correlation to P—values computed by DESeq
for differential expression [Pearson correlation of 0.27 (0.02) for
brain versus liver (neuroblastoma stage 4S versus stage 4) com-
parisons (see Supplementary Fig. S15)]. This further demon-
strates that SplicingCompass does not merely detect differential
gene expression but, at the same time, supports ﬁndings that
indicate some cross-talk between splicing regulation and gene
expression regulation (Kornblihtt et al., 2004).

3.5 Comparison with DEXSeq and Cufﬂinks

We compared our method with the two well-established and
well-known methods DEXSeq (Anders et al., 2012) and

Cufﬂinks/Cuffdiff (Trapnell et al., 2010). SplicingCompass and
DEXSeq predicted a similar amount of differentially spliced
genes for the brain/liver study. In brain versus liver tissues,
1595 genes were predicted by SplicingCompass and 1489 genes
by DEXSeq. In neuroblastoma patients, 24 genes were predicted
by SplicingCompass and eight genes by DEXSeq. Four of these
genes were predicted with both methods, and in the brain versus
liver comparison 873 of the genes were predicted with both meth-
ods (see Supplementary Fig. S16). Cuffdiff did not report a sig-
niﬁcant expression difference between the Neuroblastoma stages
for any transcript that was assembled by Cufﬂinks. For the
brain/liver study, we ran Cuffdiff for 150h on 15 processing
cores before we stopped the analysis. The estimated running
time for Cuffdiff on eight processing cores is around 6 h accord-
ing to Trapnell et al. (2012) and we did not observe such exces-
sive running times with the other datasets. In addition, we
performed a comparison using simulated data in which we se-
lected 30 genes and randomly ‘knocked out’ half of their tran-
script isoforms (experiment 1) and a second experiment, where
we focused on events where multiple exons were affected in an
interdependent manner (experiments 2—4, see Methods). From
the 30 genes in simulated experiment 1, SplicingCompass,
DEXSeq and Cufﬂinks/Cuffdiff detected 23, 28 and 17 events,
respectively (see Supplementary Table S5). From the 10 inter-
dependent events simulated in experiments 241, SplicingCompass
and DEXSeq detected all events with an isoform switch of 50%,
eight versus six events with an isoform switch of 30% and one
versus three events with an isoform switch of 10% (see
Supplementary Table S6). Transcripts that were assembled by
Cufﬂinks in the regions of the simulated true positive events
were not reported as signiﬁcant by Cuffdiff. See
Supplementary Note lb for a more detailed description.
Hence, SplicingCompass and DEXSeq showed a similar per-
formance to detect these simulated differentially spliced genes,
whereas Cufﬂinks/Cuffdiff did not report any of the events simu-
lated in experiments 2—4.

Some of the genes found by SplicingCompass in the brain
versus liver comparison that were not detected by DEXSeq
involved differential splicing of unannotated exons. E.g.
SplicingCompass detected a liver-speciﬁc exon in PCYT2 that
was not annotated in CCDS when we downloaded the reference
but, in the meantime, has been included in the current database
(see Supplementary Fig. Sl7a and Sl7b). SplicingCompass de-
tected this event because it considers all reported junction reads
(even between not-annotated regions), while DEXSeq relies more
on the provided annotation and therefore missed the event (see
Supplementary Fig. Sl7c). Providing DEXSeq with the most
recent annotation in this case or generally with an annotation
that is constructed from the sequencing data itself probably
would have also allowed it to detect the event. However, this
case demonstrates that SplicingCompass can even identify differ-
ential splicing that involves unknown exons if provided with ap-
propriate junction read information. In other cases, we saw
strong evidence of differential splicing in genes predicted by
SplicingCompass where DEXSeq did not reach statistical signiﬁ-
cance (see Supplementary Fig. S18 for an example of such an
event in PAPSS2 that was not reported by DEXSeq). In turn,
DEXSeq reported signiﬁcant exons in genes that were not sig-
niﬁcant in SplicingCompass. E.g. for NRlDl (one of the four

genes that were not reported by SplicingCompass in the neuro-
blastoma comparison), DEXSeq reported a differential usage of
exon 1. A relative coverage difference of exon 1 was also visible
in the plots produced by SplicingCompass but the gene was not
considered to be signiﬁcant. This might be due to the fact that
transcript variation affecting the ﬁrst and last exons are generally
less supported by junction reads, which are used by
SplicingCompass if possible. However, a differential usage of
the last exon in CRTACl that was more distinct between neuro-
blastoma stages was detected by both methods in good
agreement.

While DEXSeq reports P—values on an exon level, the plots
produced by SplicingCompass were often equally informative
and in many cases suggested the same exons to be affected by
differential splicing. In some cases, the plots produced by
SplicingCompass even allowed for an interpretation of the
underlying events that was more consistent with existing know-
ledge. E. g. in the case of PIK3R1 DEXSeq marked the ﬁrst exon
as differentially used (see Supplementary Fig. S60), while the
plots produced by SplicingCompass allowed to infer three iso-
forms that differed in the ﬁrst six to eight exons, an interpret-
ation that is consistent with annotated transcripts in CCDS (see
Supplementary Fig. S6a and S6b).

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We presented a new approach to predict genes that undergo
differential splicing. SplicingCompass is able to detect complex
and previously unknown events and inherently distinguishes be-
tween gene expression and splicing differences. Our method
allowed us to detect tissue-speciﬁc alternative splicing in brain
versus liver samples and tumour stage-speciﬁc alternative spli-
cing in neuroblastoma patients. We showed that a signiﬁcant
number of exons in our predicted genes are associated with spe-
ciﬁc splicing factor motifs and that a statistically signiﬁcant
number of publications link those genes to reported alternative
splicing. Moreover, we successfully exploited splicing informa-
tion to cluster samples of different tissues and neuroblastoma
tumours. Our clustering results showed that we captured
post-transcriptional modiﬁcations of genes, which are not appar-
ent in the general gene expression. Risk stratiﬁcation of neuro-
blastoma patients is a major challenge that led to the
development of expression classiﬁers based on mRNA levels
(Oberthuer et al., 2006) as well as miRNA levels (De Preter
et al., 2011). Our results bear the perspective of improved strati-
ﬁcation methods for the diagnosis of cancer patients based on
differential splicing. In eukaryotes, intron retention is the
rarest type of alternative splicing, whereas exon-skipping is
the most prevalent (Kim et al., 2007), (Sultan et al., 2008).
SplicingCompass currently ignores coverage differences of in-
trons, but we plan to incorporate dimensions for observed re-
tained introns in the next version of SplicingCompass. Mutations
that cause aberrant splicing are known to be responsible for
many diseases, and at least 15% of all disease-causing, single
base-pair mutations affect splicing (reviewed in Kim et al.,
2008b). The particular involvement of alternative splicing in
cancer development has been demonstrated by splice variants
of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes that were found
speciﬁcally in tumours from diverse tissues (reviewed in

SplicingCompass

 

Venables, 2004 and Hu and Fu, 2007), making alternative spli-
cing analysis a promising approach in cancer research. The
increasing amount of RNA-seq data from cancer patients now
paves the way for a broad application of splicing analysis tools in
this respect. We identiﬁed several candidate genes in neuroblast-
oma patients with yet unknown or already reported functional
relevance in tumour biology but it is clear that the differentially
spliced genes together with their predicted effects have to be
veriﬁed experimentally.

While SplicingCompass can detect differentially spliced genes
it does not aim to assemble the isoforms itself or infer isoform
expression levels like assembly algorithms such as Cufﬂinks
(Trapnell et al., 2010), Scripture (Guttman et al., 2010) and
others. Transcriptome assembly from RNA-seq reads is
challenging especially in the presence of complex alternative spli-
cing patterns that often occur in plants and mammalians. While
assembly algorithms beneﬁt from longer reads, algorithms that
estimate gene-level expression values often recommend shorter
reads [e. g. Li et al. (2010) suggests that 20 to 25 bases is optimal].
This makes it difﬁcult to choose the most appropriate sequencing
protocol when a variety of analyses should be applied to the
data. SplicingCompass works with all common read lengths as
well as single and paired end data. However, exon junction reads
and distance information of read pairs are well supporting the
determination of the exact splicing events and isoforms involved.
In addition, strand-speciﬁc protocols are used more and more to
preserve the strand information of reads, which is usually lost
during cDNA conversion (Levin et al., 2010). If the strand in-
formation for every read is available, reads can be unambigu-
ously assigned to exons of genes annotated on the same strand.
Our software comes with a plotting functionality that allows
for the visual assessment of predicted genes (see Supplementary
Fig. S4). SplicingCompass enables to detect genes affected by
previously unknown splicing events. We applied our method to
a reference assembly for which unknown events can involve
known exons from existing annotations. With appropriate junc-
tion read information, SplicingCompass can also detect un-
known events involving exons not represented in the
annotation. Alternatively, SplicingCompass can easily be com-
bined with algorithms that deﬁne exonic regions from the
sequencing data itself and might thus reveal additional unknown
events involving newly deﬁned exons.

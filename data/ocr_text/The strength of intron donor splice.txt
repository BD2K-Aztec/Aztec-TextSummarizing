ABSTRACT

Motivation: The gene concept has recently changed from the
classical one protein notion into a much more diverse picture,
where overlapping or fused transcripts, alternative transcription
initiation, and genes within genes, add to the complexity generated
by alternative splicing. Increased understanding of the mechanisms
controlling pre-mRNA splicing is thus important for a wide range of
aspects relating to gene expression.

Results: We have discovered a convex gene delineating pattern in
the strength of 5/ intron splice sites. When comparing the strengths
of >18000 intron containing Human genes, we found that when
analysing them separately according to the number of introns they
contain, initial splice sites were always stronger on average than
subsequent ones, and that a similar reversed trend exist towards the
terminal gene part. The convex pattern is strongest for genes with
up to 10 introns. Interestingly, when analysing the intron containing
gene pool from mouse consisting of >15000 genes, we found
the convex pattern to be conserved despite >75 million years
of evolutionary divergence between the two organisms. We also
analysed an interesting, novel class of chimeric genes which during
spliceosome assembly are fused and in tandem are transcribed and
spliced into a single mature mRNA sequence. In their splice site
patterns, these genes individually seem to deviate from the convex
pattern, offering a possible rationale behind their fusion into a single
transcript.

1 INTRODUCTION

For protein coding genes, the most signiﬁcant variety spawning
factor is the process responsible for intron removal (Wang et al.,
2008). Here the binding reaction between the highly conserved
U1 snRNA 5’ terminus and the pre—mRNA intron donor splice site
motif is the ﬁrst and most crucial step (Freund et al., 2003; Zhuang
and Weiner, 1986). The consensus sequence of human donor splice
sites, the sequence motif which U1 snRNA recognizes, reﬂects
an ‘average’ complementarity to U1 snRNA (Lerner et al., 1980;

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Zhuang and Weiner, 1986). The calculation of the free energy of
the base pairing between the U1 snRNA 5’ terminus and donor site
motif has previously been performed as an effective strategy to study
binding stability and the strength of donor splice sites (Roca et al.,
2005; Zychlinski et al., 2009).

2 METHODS

2.1 Genome data

Human genome data (Build 36) and mouse genome data (Build 36) were
downloaded from the NCBI ftp site: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/.
For the extraction of both DNA sequence and annotation of intron/exon
structure, we used an approach similar to FeatureExtract (Wernersson, 2005).
Full—length transcripts including untranslated regions (UTRs) were extracted
by paring the chromosome Contig FASTA ﬁles with the information about
UTR regions and coding regions contained in the seq_genes.md ﬁle. We
used the NCBI based annotation (ref) and ignored alternative annotations.
Furthermore, in the few cases where the same transcript ID is present on
different chromosomes (mainly some regions on the X and Y chromosomes),
the ﬁrst occurrence was used. Non—coding RNA genes, genes without introns
and questionable/frameshift containing entries were discarded, such as genes
where the sizes of the coding regions are not multiples of three, entries that
begin with the preﬁx XM_ and XR_ which are model reference sequences
produced automatically by NCBI’s Genome Annotation project. In total, we
extracted 18 148 reliable intron—containing Human genes and 15 318 intron—
containing mouse genes all with GT—AG intron splice site pairs throughout
the transcripts.

2.2 Free energy calculation

We used the MFOLD algorithm with a customized set of parameters
(see below) to estimate the U1 snRNA—donor site binding energies. This
approach takes into account the negative energy for stabilization of stacked
base pairs and subtracts positive energy for loops, bulges and other
destabilizing structures (Garland and Aalberts, 2004; Zuker, 2003). We took
the conserved U1 snRNA sequence (AUACUUACCUGGC) at its 5/ terminus
and joined it with the pre—mRNA section covering positions —6 to +8 relative
to the donor site. This binding product, U1 snRNA:pre—mRNA, can thus be
considered as a 27 bp single strand RNA fold. The last two nucleotides on
U1 snRNA and the ﬁrst three nucleotides on pre—mRNA were replaced by
ﬁve Ns, and furthermore prevented the middle ﬁve nucleotide linkers from
pairing, as well as ensured that the GT in the pre—mRNA always base pair to
CA in the U1 snRNA. Then, the minimum free energy was calculated after
subtracting the penalty value for the hairpin. In some cases where more than
one structure could be formed based on one sequence, the optimal folding
structure was selected. We tried to use different lengths of the pre—mRNA
donor site motifs and U1 snRNA 5/ terminal sections as the binding products

when calculating the energies (Freund et al., 2005), such as the segments
from position —6 to +10 and —6 to +6 on pre—mRNA, and always obtained
similar results (as those displayed in Fig. 1). We concluded that the exact
choice of region used is not critical to the results reported here. Here, we have
chosen to use the MFOLD program; however, it should be noted that other
programs use the same energy model and dynamic programming algorithm,
e. g. RNAcofold from the Vienna RNA package (Hofacker, 2003; Zuker and
Stiegler, 1981).

Recently, an interesting discovery of an alternative, shifted interaction
between 5’ donor sites and U1 snRNAs was reported. Atypical 5’ splice sites
that cannot base pair very well to U1 snRNAs actually can be recognized by
U1 snRNAs efﬁciently by shifting one nucleotide (Roca and Krainer, 2009).
However, since only 59 atypical 5’ splice sites in human were found, the
new ﬁnding does not affect the genome—wide analyses reported here.

3 RESULTS

We have compared the strengths of binding associations in 18 148
intron containing Human genes and found that when analysing them
separately according to the number of introns they contain, initial
splice sites were always stronger on average than subsequent ones,
and that a similar reversed trend exist towards the terminal gene part
(Fig. 1a). In all categories representing different numbers of introns
(from 1 to 18), the splice site strength display a convex, bell—shaped
trend where weaker splice sites are found internally. The average
strength of initial donor sites is always below —12kcal/mol (and
most often as low as —12.5 kcal/mol), while internal splice sites
tend to be above.

Surprisingly, when the same analysis was repeated for 15 318
intron—containing genes in the mouse genome, the result was highly
similar (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table Sl), despite the fact that
most 5’ splice sites differ in sequence, while the other binding
partner, the human and mouse U1 motif, is identical. Moreover,
tissue—speciﬁc transcriptional regulation and splicing has diverged
considerably between human and mouse. For example, 41—89% of
cis—regulatory regions in one species were not found in the other
(Odom et al., 2007), and >11% of alternatively skipped exons were
species—speciﬁc (Pan et al., 2005)—indicating fast change over 75
million years of evolution (Kitazoe et al., 2007; Waterston et al.,
2002).

It should be noted that while the underlying distribution
in binding energies is quite broad (Fig. 2 and Supplementary
Fig. S1)—the mean is estimated with high accuracy—as can
be see from Table 1 illustrating this for the human data.
The general trend of internal introns having weaker binding
(higher free energy) holds true even when dividing the dataset
into three broad categories representing initial introns, internal
introns and terminal introns separately (Fig. 2). The mean
(initial: —12.37 kcal/mol; internal: —11.76 kcal/mol; terminal:
—12.09 kcal/mol) is signiﬁcantly different between each pair of
categories (P <2 X 10—16 estimated by the Welch t—test). Finally,
one may also ask whether introns of roughly the same size also
differ in splice site strength, e. g. initial versus internal. Using for
example a 250 bp binning, we checked that is indeed the case for
all length intervals (>2500 bp in one bin). There is a considerable
margin for all categories over 250 bp in intron length, while it is
smaller for short introns (which are infrequent in the Human gene
pool).

A sub set of the initial and terminal introns is found in untranslated
regions (UTRs), where there is no protein coding selection pressure

on the exon part of the splice site motifs. To assess the effect of
introns in UTRs, we analyzed all Human genes only containing
CDS introns and found again the exact same trend (Supplementary
Figs S2 and S3). Interestingly, protein unaffected splice sites in
5’ and 3’ UTRs are on average more strongly bound to U1
snRNAs, than splice sites in protein coding regions, but the bell—
shaped pattern in the pre—mRNAzUl snRNA association is the same
whether genes contain UTR introns or not (3’ donor sites are only
marginally stronger, see Supplementary Figs S4 and SS). This may
also explain why human UTR donor sites quite successfully can
be predicted from the sequence despite the fact that there is no
‘reading frame/non—coding transition’ delivering a pattern which can
be exploited by an algorithm as is the case for coding region donor
sites (Eden and Brunak, 2004).

Another explanation for the stronger initial and terminal splice
sites could be that alternative splicing would be less frequent here,
and that the weaker and more frequent alternative splice sites in
protein coding regions would lower the average free energy of
Ulzpre—mRNA association in the CDS. However, several reports
indicate that the opposite in fact is the case. Alternative splicing
seems to be even more frequent in the 5’ UTR or non—coding
transcripts (Mironov et al., 1999; Sammeth et al., 2008); still we
ﬁnd that UTR splice sites are stronger and hence most likely more
conﬁdently recognized by the splicing machinery.

It is well known that there is a tendency for long introns in
Human genes to have donor sites which conform more strongly to
the consensus sequence hence having stronger U1 association (Xiao
et al., 2007). Another well—known tendency is that the initial intron
is longer than non—initial introns on average (Bradnam and Korf,
2008). If most of the initial and terminal introns were long this could
at least rationalize (but not necessarily explain) the bell— shaped trend
shown in Figure 1. Based on the data presented here, we therefore
calculated the median length of introns along the genes using the
same speciﬁc categories as in Figure 1. As shown in Supplementary
Figure S6, the median intron length is indeed longer in the 5’ part of
the genes, while this is not the case for terminal introns. However,
when investigating the strength of initial intron donor sites as a
function of intron length we found that even short initial introns
tend to be very strong (Fig. 3). Indeed, the ﬁgure shows that on
average initial intron splice sites are stronger for all intron length
intervals.

We also investigated the relationship with the GC content which
is known to be elevated in the 5’ end of Human genes (Bernardi
1991; Bernardi 2000; Furey and Haussler 2003; Pozzoli et al., 2008).
Supplementary Figure S7 shows that the GC content in donor splice
sites (using the 11bp region used for the free energy calculations)
matches the known trend; initial splice sites have slightly higher
GC content, while it is stable elsewhere for all categories of genes
comprising 1—9 introns. The GC content variation in the splice sites
(or the genes) does thus not explain the binding energy trend as
it does not display a bell—shaped trend. Also, importantly the U1
sequence has more A/T (7 bp) than G/C (4 bp) and this means
that higher GC content in itself in random sequence will have
a tendency to produce weaker splice sites due to less frequent
Watson—Crick base pairing. We show in Figure 1 that the opposite
is the case.

From the bell— shaped pattern we have discovered, splice sites near
the gene edges tend to be stronger on average, and it seems to be a
signature of the boundary of genes not reﬂecting the position—speciﬁc

sequence encoding a putative chimeric protein. From data generated
within the ENCODE project, it has been estimated that 4—5% of
the gene pairs in the Human genome can be transcribed in this
chimeric manner (Akiva et al., 2006; Parra et al., 2006). We analysed
the most abundant transcription—induced chimeras (TICs), by which
two genes in tandem skip the last exon of the upstream gene and
the ﬁrst exon of the downstream gene. Thus, the intergenic region
is removed and all other exons are joined into a single spliced
mRNA (the ﬁrst donor site of the downstream gene is not used).
Interestingly, when analysing 46 TIC downstream genes from a
recent study (Akiva et al., 2006), we found that the bell—shaped
pattern was indeed absent, and that the ﬁrst donor sites in these
genes were weaker than the general average for ﬁrst donor sites
(—12.45 versus —11.86 kcal/mol). Again, this was also the case
when analysing the TIC genes separately according to the number
of introns as in Figure 1 (except in the subset having six introns, see
Supplementary Table S2). This analysis again supports the notion
that the bell— shaped pattern is related to the delineation of the spliced
part of the gene transcript.

4 DISCUSSION

In this analysis, we have used the U1—donor splice sites motif
complementarity to assess the strength of a particular splice
site. However, many other factors affect tissue—speciﬁc splicing
in vivo including splicing enhancers, silencers, trans—acting factors,
acceptor site motifs, branch point sequences, RNA secondary
structure, nucleosome, chromatin and isochore features (Black,
2003; Castle et al., 2008; Goren et al., 2010; Luco et al.; Tilgner
et al., 2009). Given this additional complexity, it is not surprising
that we could not ﬁnd the bell—shaped pattern present in every single
Human and mouse gene just by investigating one of the contributing
factors, the U1—donor site association. Different splicing regulatory
elements compensate for weaker splice sites in a coevolutionary
network (Xiao et al., 2007). Additionally, as already mentioned
above the size of exons and introns correlates with the strength of
splice sites and there is no obvious way to quantitatively assess or
make compensation for all these factors in the analysis presented
here (see Supplementary Fig. S8 for statistics involving splicing
enhancers).

The conclusion from this analysis is that spliced Human genes
seem to contain on average a ‘delineation trend’ in the donor splice
sites, which may play a key role in spliceosome recognition. This
role may be most signiﬁcant in the set of genes where the trend is
present at the level of single genes (~ 10% of the gene pool), or it may
go far beyond that depending on the contributions of the many other
splicing site strength inﬂuencing factors mentioned above. Despite
>75 millions of years of divergence, mouse genes display the exact
same trend. The discovery cannot answer the puzzle of spliceosomal
intron evolution or why genes are intervened by introns, but it
highlights an interesting pattern which in very different types of
introns (both within coding regions and UTRs) seem to be subject
to similar evolutionary pressures conserving the trend in strength.
It also suggests a potential future direction for comparative analysis
of spliced genes and gene structure prediction (including splice site
prediction) by deﬁning gene categories according to the number of
introns they contain.

ABSTRACT

Background: The sc-PDB database is an annotated archive of
druggable binding sites extracted from the Protein Data Bank. It
contains all-atoms coordinates for 8166 protein—ligand complexes,
chosen for their geometrical and physico-chemical properties. The
sc-PDB provides a functional annotation for proteins, a chemical
description for ligands and the detailed intermolecular interactions
for complexes. The sc-PDB now includes a hierarchical classification
of all the binding sites within a functional class.

Method: The sc-PDB entries were first clustered according to the
protein name indifferent of the species. For each cluster, we identified
dissimilar sites (e.g. catalytic and allosteric sites of an enzyme).
Scope and applications: The classification of sc-PDB targets by
binding site diversity was intended to facilitate chemogenomics
approaches to drug design. In ligand-based approaches, it avoids
comparing ligands that do not share the same binding site. In
structure-based approaches, it permits to quantitatively evaluate the
diversity of the binding site definition (variations in size, sequence
and/or structure).

Availability: The sc-PDB database is freely available at:
http://bioinfo-pharma.u-strasbg.fr/scPDB.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the main public resource of
biologically active 3D structures available to study the interactions
that govern ligand binding to protein (Berman et al., 2007). To assist
structure—based approaches in drug design, we have parsed the PDB
to identify binding sites suitable for the docking of a ‘drug—like’
ligand and so have created a database named sc—PDB. The protein
selection is based on the molecular weight, buried surface area and
chemical structure of ligands as well as the volume of corresponding
cavities (Kellenberger et al., 2006; Kellenberger et al., 2008). Since
its creation in 2004, the database is updated annually, with regular
improvements. Notably, the curation of ligand chemical structures
(2005), the optimization of ligand—bound coordinates (2005) and
the systematic description of the ligand binding mode (2006) give
signiﬁcant added values to the structural information contained in the
database. The sc—PDB is annotated at a functional level and a sc—PDB
target name is assigned to each entry. However, two sc—PDB entries

with the same sc—PDB target name do not necessarily describe
an identical binding site. For example, there are 37 copies of the
tyrosine—kinase scr in the sc—PDB (Fig. 1A); in 24 entries, the binding
site is the ATP binding site of the kinase domain (Site 1), while in
other entries, the binding site is located in the SH2 domain and
accommodates ligands of variable size (Sites 2 and 3). The present
application aims at the distinction of the sc—PDB binding sites for
a particular protein. A hierarchical classiﬁcation was established
based on the geometrical and physico—chemical diversity of binding
sites. All the binding sites found similar for a given protein were
structurally aligned to yield a new set of coordinates for the ligand,
site and protein ﬁles.

2 CLASSIFICATION OF BINDING SITES BY
LOCAL STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY

The sc—PDB data are organized into a hierarchical classiﬁcation
scheme. The ﬁrst level of the classiﬁcation is the protein itself,
as deﬁned by the sc—PDB target name, which combines biological
information retrieved from UniprotKB (preiler et al., 2010)
and PDB archives. Typically, the Uniprot recommended name
was considered if the PDB ﬁle includes the appropriate cross
reference (a word matching check validates the consistency between
PDB and Uniprot names). In the case of polyproteins (e.g. HIV
gag—pol) or multifunctional proteins, the sc—PDB target name was
chosen according to the domain function (e.g. EC number). Further
simpliﬁcations of sc—PDB names remove tags for cellular locations
and maturation states. Lastly, in the absence of Uniprot reference
in the PDB entry, the sc—PDB name was directly extracted from the
PDB ﬁle and manually curated for a better uniformity within the
database. The current 8166 sc—PDB entries represent 1168 protein
families and 1470 singletons.

The second level of the classiﬁcation distinguishes binding
sites which signiﬁcantly differs in size, shape or location in the
protein. The third level reports homogeneous classes of structurally
similar binding sites. The second and third levels of classiﬁcation
were obtained by clustering all members of a protein family
(ﬁrst—level classiﬁcation) according to local structural similarity
between sites. The all—against—all comparison of sites was performed
using the 3D alignment program SiteAlign (Schalon et al., 2008).
SiteAlign searches for the best superposition of a target site onto
a query site (the largest one) by optimizing a global similarity
measure which estimates the agreement between the topological
and physico—chemical attributes of site—speciﬁc 1D ﬁngerprints. The
algorithm was successfully applied to identify a novel off—target for

some protein kinase inhibitors (Defranchi et al., 2010). Extensive
validation of the program enabled the deﬁnition of an alignment
score threshold value (SAscore > 20) for distinguishing similar from
dissimilar binding sites (Schalon et al., 2008). The SAscore quantiﬁes
all the binding sites discrepancies which result from changes in the
sequence (e.g. between orthologous proteins, between wild—type and
mutant or chimeric proteins), in the structure (different side chain
positioning, motion in the backbone) and in the number of residues
in the binding site (which is directly related to the size and the
position of the bound ligand). In the current work, the SAscores of the
all—against—all comparison were stored in a distance matrix, which
was converted into a Boolean matrix [A(i,j)=1 if SAscore :20,
else A(i, j) :0]. The Boolean matrix can be viewed as the adjacent
matrix of an undirected graph, where each node represents a site,
and an edge is deﬁned between two nodes if the corresponding sites
are similar. The Boolean matrix allowed the identiﬁcation of all
graph components (i.e. the maximal connected subgraphs), thereby
grouping the sites of a protein family into one or more clusters.
Lastly, a hierarchical clustering within clusters of similar sites was
generated using the complete linkage method and distance equal to
[1 —ln (SAscore )/1n(SAscoremax)I-

All sc—PDB entries belonging to the same cluster were structurally
aligned to the mean point entry, whose average square distance to all
other sites is the smallest in the cluster. The rotation and translation
matrix applied to ligand, site and protein coordinates of the target
entry were obtained from the global structural alignment of the
target and reference proteins using the combinatorial extension (CE)
program (Shindyalov and Bourne, 1998). If the proteins contain
several peptidic chains, all—against—all chain comparisons were

performed, and the transformation which minimizes the distance
between the binding site centres was chosen. CE was here preferred
over SiteAlign because it ﬁnds better alignments for a closely related
structural ensemble. In contrast to SiteAlign, CE does not take
into account changes in the amino acid type or changes in the
rotameric state of residues. CE superimposition of protein structures
thus allows the user to directly perceive the contribution of protein
ﬂexibility to the SAscore. In the example shown in Figure 1, the
24 copies of the kinase domain (here labeled as Site 1) are grouped in
three main branches, which are not directly indicative of the binding
site ﬂexibility, the ligand chemotype or the ligand binding mode.
The absence of correlation between SAscore and deviation in the
backbone coordinates of aligned sites rules out the interpretation
of the dendrogram in terms of protein ﬂexibility (the mean RMSD
computed for the alpha carbon atoms of the residues deﬁning the
smallest site is 0.5 :l:0.2A). Annotation of the sc—PDB ﬁles rather
suggests that the dendrogram reﬂects variations in sequence length
(the number of residues in site ranges from 34 to 54) and nature
(avian and human proteins, wild—type and mutant proteins).

The clustering achieved on the 1168 protein families of the 2010
sc—PDB release produced 783 singletons, 307 classes with two
distinct sites, 60 classes with three distinct sites, 10 classes with
four distinct sites, 4 classes with ﬁve distinct sites, 3 classes with six

distinct sites and 1 class with eight sites. The sc—PDB classiﬁcation is
freely available via the database webserver (http://bioinfo—pharma.u—
strasbg.fr/scPDB), by selecting the ‘Clusters of Binding Site’ page.
The query form allows search by target name, by number of distinct
sites within a protein class or by PDB ID. The result page returns
all classes matching the request, provides the user with the detailed
content of each class (Fig. 1B and C) and enables the download
of MOL2 ﬁles of structurally aligned entries. Alternatively, all
sc—PDB binding sites similar to a particular binding site entry may
be retrieved and ranked by decreasing similarity to the query.

The sc—PDB classiﬁcation should foster drug design applications
for two main reasons: (i) it avoids comparing ligands that do
not share the same binding site; (ii) it gives clues to evaluate
the inﬂuence of ligand binding on binding site diversity for
applications in structure—based methods (e. g. docking, site detection
and comparison).

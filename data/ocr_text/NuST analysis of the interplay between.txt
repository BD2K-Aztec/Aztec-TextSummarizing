ABSTRACT

Summary: Different experimental results suggest the presence
of an interplay between global transcriptional regulation and
chromosome spatial organization in bacteria. The identification and
clear visualization of spatial clusters of contiguous genes targeted by
specific DNA-binding proteins or sensitive to nucleoid perturbations
can elucidate links between nucleoid structure and gene expression
patterns. Similarly, statistical analysis to assess correlations between
results from independent experiments can provide the integrated
analysis needed in this line of research. NuST (Nucleoid Survey
tools), based on the Escherichia coli genome, gives the non-expert
the possibility to analyze the aggregation of genes or loci sets
along the genome coordinate, at different scales of observation. It
is useful to discover correlations between different sources of data
(e.g. expression, binding or genomic data) and genome organization.
A user can use it on datasets in the form of gene lists coming
from his/her own experiments or bioinformatic analyses, but also
make use of the internal database, which collects data from many
published studies.

Availability and Implementation: NuST is a web server (available
at http://www.lgm.upmc.fr/nust/). The website is implemented in
PHP, SQLite and Ajax, with all major browsers supported, while the
core algorithms are optimized and implemented in C. NuST has an
extensive help page and provides a direct visualization of results as
well as different downloadable file formats. A template Perl code
for automated access to the web server can be downloaded at
http://www.lgm.upmc.fr/nust/downloads/, in order to allow the users
to use NuST in systematic bioinformatic analyses.

The orchestration of coordinated global changes in the
transcriptional program is at the basis of bacterial adaptation
to environments and stresses. These changes depend on a large
regulatory network mediated by speciﬁc binding of transcription
factors, as well as on the physical organization of the chromosome,
which affects the expression of large gene sets (Rimsky and Travers,
2011). The bacterial DNA is condensed in a compact DNA—protein

complex called ‘nucleoid’, whose transcriptional activity depends
on nucleoid—related factors including the degree of supercoiling
(Travers and MuskhelishVili, 2005) and the speciﬁc and non—speciﬁc
binding of nucleoid associated proteins (NAPs) such as Fis, H—NS
and HU (Dame et al., 2011). While the total level of supercoiling
is controlled by enzymes like gyrases and topoisomerases (Travers
and Muskhelishvili, 2005), NAPs like H—NS and Fis are believed
to stabilize locally DNA loops (Luijsterburg et al., 2006). The
nucleoid structure varies at different scales, from DNA supercoiled
loops ~10kb long (Postow et al., 2004) to large compartments
organizing the genome in four ‘macrodomains’ (Dame et al., 2011;
Valens et al., 2004). The effects of transcriptional network and
nucleoid on large—scale gene expression are coupled. For example,
many NAPs are also speciﬁc transcription factors, and affect the
expression of targets both directly and through the conformational
changes that they can induce on the chromosome.

The complex interplay between chromosome organization and
gene expression requires integration of data from different
high— and low—throughput experiments with statistical analysis
at multiple scales. The web server described here is an effort
to ﬁll this gap. Since many of the nucleoid structural features
(e.g. supercoil domains and macrodomains) involve contiguous
genomic regions, a typical hallmark of nucleoid—mediated regulation
is aggregation along the chromosome of genes having speciﬁc
properties (Mathelier and Carbone, 2010; Scolari et al., 2011;
Sobetzko et al., 2012). The main tool is able to identify signiﬁcant
linear aggregation clusters of a gene set, considering different
observation scales (Scolari et al., 2011). The web server is currently
based on Escherichia coli. An extensive step—by—step documentation
introduces analyses that can be performed using the web server and
is divided into an introductory help page, and a ‘learn by example’
page guiding the user through the interpretation of the results and
the choice of the parameters.

The input datasets are single column text ﬁles with one gene ID
for each row. Standard gene IDs are Regulon DB database (Gama—
Castro et al., 2011) (for different gene IDs the server proposes
synonyms). Sample datasets as well as the complete list of accepted
synonyms can be obtained from the ‘Download’ page. Loaded data
sets are stored in the ‘Personal’ part of the internal database and
can be accessed for further analysis. They are deleted at the end of
each anonymous session. A login (obtained sending an email to the
administrator) allows to keep personal data for multiple sessions.
The ‘Common’ part of the database contains datasets from the
literature, organized by type of data and experimental technique.

Fig. 1. Main features of NuST. (A) One—dimensional aggregation of gene set. Starting from a list of genes, their density is evaluated using a sliding window
of different size and compared to a shufﬂing null model to extract the signiﬁcant clusters. (B) Diagram of the statistically signiﬁcant linear aggregation
clusters. The box indicates the position of the peak at a given scale of analysis (x axis) while the whisker indicates the maximal extension of the cluster, with
color—coded P—values. The right panel reports the positions of chromosomal macrodomains (Dame et al., 2011; Valens et al., 2004), chromosomal sectors
deﬁned in (Mathelier and Carbone, 2010), and the names of some important genes. (C) Circular representation of the most signiﬁcant clusters found for the
same data set of Fig. 1B. The outer colored ring represents macrodomains (Dame et al., 2011; Valens et al., 2004) while the inner ring represents chromosomal
sectors deﬁned by Mathelier and Carbone (Mathelier and Carbone, 2010). The table reports the cluster ID, the scale of observation, the cluster coordinates
in megabases and the P—value associated to each cluster. (D) Overlaid histogram of two datasets in the common database. The input ﬁles belonging to the
common datasets can be read in the upper part of the plot. The normalized number of genes located inside a window centered in each chromosomal position
is shown. In this example the window size is ﬁxed to L / 16, where L is the total length of the genome. (E) Local Pearson correlation function between sliding
windows histograms. The (customizable) window size is L / 32, where L is the total length of the genome. The plot legend reports the total Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient. In this case, although globally there is no correlation, speciﬁc regions can present cooccurrence or mutual exclusion.

The main features of the server are described in Fig. l. The ‘linear
aggregation’ analysis (Fig. 1A) detects signiﬁcant aggregation along
the genome coordinate. The output is directly visualized on the
website with two bitmap pictures and a table (Fig. 1B). An alternative
graphical representation shows the statistically signiﬁcant clusters
as colored wedges (Fig. 1C). Sliding—window histograms (Fig. 1D)
allow the comparison of the gene density of different datasets.
Finally, a tool evaluates the local contribution to the Pearson
correlation coefﬁcient along the chromosome between the gene
densities of two gene sets (Fig. 1E). Since averages and standard
deviations are calculated along the whole genome, the global
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient is a number between —1 (linear
anticorrelation) and +1 (linear correlation). The local product does
not have this constraint, but represents a measure of positive or
negative correlation (affected by the deviation of the two densities
from their global averages). Note that the global Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient can change with observation scale, as the sliding—window
histograms may be different.

To the best of our knowledge the NuST web server is the
ﬁrst freely available computational tool performing multi—scale
analysis of the linear aggregation of speciﬁc gene sets along the
chromosome. It is designed for the investigation of links between
bacterial chromosome organization and the global gene expression
program, a problem in which such multi—scale approach and
comparison/integration of different kinds of data can be highly
informative.

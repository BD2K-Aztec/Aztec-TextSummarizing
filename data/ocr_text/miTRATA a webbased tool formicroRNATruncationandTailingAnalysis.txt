Abstract

Summary: We describe miTRATA, the first web—based tool for microRNA ﬂuncation gnd Iailing
Analysis—the analysis of 3’ modifications of microRNAs including the loss or gain of nucleotides
relative to the canonical sequence. miTRATA is implemented in Python (version 3) and employs
parallel processing modules to enhance its scalability when analyzing multiple small RNA (sRNA)
sequencing datasets. It utilizes miRBase, currently version 21, as a source of known microRNAs for
analysis. miTRATA notifies user(s) via email to download as well as visualize the results online.
miTRATA’s strengths lie in (i) its biologist—focused web interface, (ii) improved scalability via paral—
lel processing and (iii) its uniqueness as a webtool to perform microRNA truncation and tailing

analysis.

Availability and implementation: miTRATA is developed in Python and PHP. It is available as a
web—based application from https://wasabi.dbi.udel.edu/~apps/ta/.

1 Introduction

Revolutionary changes in next—generation sequencing and its ever—
decreasing cost have driven a growing need for bioinformatics tools
and algorithms. Molecular analysis of plant microRNAs (miRNAs)
has demonstrated their 3’ protection by action of the methyltransfer-
ase HUA ENHANCERI (HENI), Which adds a 2’-O-methyl group
to the 3’ terminal ribose of miRNAs and other small RNAs (Zhai
et 61]., 2013). Such 3’ modification protects plant miRNAs from uri-
dylation [addition of uridine (U) nucleotides] (Zhai and Meyers,
2013). We and others have previously demonstrated via sequencing
studies and comparative analysis that miRNAs in a [96111 mutant
(and to a much less eXtent in Wild type Arabidopsis) demonstrate an
array of 3’ modifications, include loss of nucleotides (truncation)
and an addition of one to several non—templated nucleotides, pre—
dominantly uridines (U) (Li et 61]., 2005). Previous reports described
varying degrees of 3’ modifications that differ among miRNA

families yet are conserved for a given miRNA across plant species
(Zhai et al., 2013).

With advancements in highly productive forward— and reverse—
genetics approaches, additional genes important to 3’ modifications
of small RNAs are being characterized. Deep sequencing in these
mutants is providing insights into the mechanisms by Which these
genes function, or at least fail to function in the mutants. For eX—
ample, analysis of the benl/hesol double mutant revealed a reduc—
tion in 3’ uridylation relative to [96711 (Zhao et 61]., 2012). Recent
genetic analysis identified a HES 01 ortholog, URTI, with a similar
but non—redundant role as a nucleotidyl transferase that uridylates
miRNAs (Tu et 61]., 2015). Thus both genetic analysis and sequenc—
ing have demonstrated the complexity of 3’ truncation and tailing
(Zhai et 61]., 2013). Interestingly, these 3’ end modifications can alter
the nature of interaction With a target, While the pairing of a
miRNA With its targets has been proposed to play critical role in the

eXtent of 3’ modifications (Zhai et al., 2013). Further insights into
these miRNA—target interactions and the influence of 3’ modifica—
tions could be gained via a new generation of computational tools
(Brousse et al., 2014; Kakrana et al., 2014) In analysis of 3’ ends
from sRNA sequencing data, computational tools separate the tem—
plate miRNA from the non—templated additions, while also assessing
truncation. Yet, there are no online, web—based tools for these meas—
urements—they’re run from a command line. Hence, we aimed to
provide biologists with an automated, parallelized, web—based tool
for these analyses in plants and animals (miTRATA, for microRNA
Truncation and Tailing Analysis).

2 Algorithm

We adapted for web access the ‘truncation and tailing’ algorithm
that we previously developed (Zhai and Meyers, 2013). We re—
implemented it in Python (version 3). Step 1: miTRATA’s web inter—
face collects input parameters such as adapter—cleaned sequence files
(‘tag count’ format, or sequence plus abundance), the genome to be
used (aka the ‘Bowtie indeX’), a list of mature miRNA(s), etc., from

miTRATA {Hicroﬂlililt Truncation and Tailing Analysis]

the user. One of the most substantial changes to the algorithm is the
addition of parallel processing to increase the scalability of our
webtool especially when dealing with multiple high-throughput
sRNA sequencing datasets and large genomes like maize and
Norway spruce. Step 2: for an individual sRNA sequence file (the
‘tag count’ file), all non—genome—matched reads are first chopped it—
eratively, one nucleotide at a time, from their 3’ end, until the re-
maining ‘head’ sequence perfectly matches to the genome. This way,
we divide individual non—genome—matched reads into two parts: the
5’ genome—matched component (SGMC) or head, and a 3’ tail. The
modified workflow can be seen in the Supplementary Figure S1.
Previously, this process of finding the 5 GMC and tail was performed
serially for each tag count file and was time consuming; parallel pro-
cessing the individual tag count files finds the 5 GMC and tail simul—
taneously. Step 3: the 5 GMC is aligned to known, mature miRNAs
from miRBase (Kozomara and Griffiths—Jones, 2014) to determine
the miRNA and the extent of truncation and tailing. Step 4: in this
last step, images are generated to represent the truncation and tailing
results for each miRNA. Finally, miTRATA notifies the user, send-
ing a link to download the results or view them online.

3 Web tool design

miTRATA is available online at https://wasabi.dbi.udel.edu/~apps/
ta/. We designed this webtool so that it has necessary settings to aid
advanced as well as intermediate users. This webtool requires the
following inputs:

1. Small RNA sequence ﬁle(s): User can choose to upload small
RNAs in ‘tag count’ formatted ﬁles in two different ways: (i) a
single ﬁle in ‘.txt’ or compressed ‘.gz’ format, (ii) multiple ﬁles in
a compressed archive (‘.zip’ or ‘.tar.gz’). Alternatively, the user
can also select an example ﬁle to run the analysis and see ex—
pected results. We have also provided users with FASTQ prepro-
cessing capabilities to generate these ‘tag count’ ﬁles (see Section
4); this step will remove adapters and poor quality sequences.

2. Genome sequence: The Bowtie index of the genome of interest
can be selected from a drop—down menu of pre—loaded genomes.
The default genome is set to Arabidopsis for the example.

3. Mature miRNA sequence(s): The user has two options to select
miRNAs for comparison: (i) an advanced user can upload a set
of mature miRNAs in FASTA format. (ii) Mature miRNA se—
quences from miRBase (currently version 21) can be selected
from a drop—down menu listing chosen species present in
miRBase. Alternatively, the user can choose to run the analysis
with an example miRNA.

When the user selects ‘Perform Truncation and Tailing Analysis’, all
the settings and required files are uploaded; the user’s email is
required for notification once the analysis is complete. The results
are displayed on a webpage for visualization, and links allow a
download of the results (Fig. 1). Download links on a webpage con—
tain three folders, as follows: (i) ‘merged_full.pdf’—a single pdf with
all images. (ii) TailingAnalysisImages.zip—all images in .png for-
mat. (iii) TailingAnalysisResults.zip—stores tailing and truncation
information (i.e. tail patterns and their lengths).

4 Discussion

New algorithms are emerging in the study of 3’ modifications of
sRNAs. For example, EnD—Seq (Welch et al., 2015) is an experimen-
tal protocol for high—throughput sequencing of RNAs in which the
3’ modifications of the captured RNA is sequenced separately from
the 5’ end. This technique is partnered with an algorithm, AppEnD
(Welch et al., 2015) that describes these 3’ end modifications from
the EnD—Seq—derived data. Our approach differs from that of Welch
et al. (2015 ) in that our algorithm uses standard sRNA sequencing
data, it characterizes the extent of 3’ truncation (a common 3’ modi—
fication of sRNAs), and it generates a graphical output for the re—
sults of each miRNA or sRNA of interest. Another tool may be a
better comparison to ours: Tailor (Chou et al., 2015 ) is specialized
for sRNA 3’ analyses, and it characterizes both biological alterations
(such as RNA editing events) and technical confounding factors
(such as sequencing errors). Although poor quality nucleotides will
be removed by FASTQ processing, our approach does not character—
ize sequence polymorphisms generated by RNA editing; however,

we have emphasized truncation, as this 3’ modification is a common
source of variation in sRNAs, and a unique graphical output.
Finally, to make our tool less prone to the inclusion of sequencing
errors and make more easily accessible, we provided users with a
standalone and Python—based FASTQ processing script to produce
the ‘tag count’ formatted files required as input to our webtool. The
processing script performs trimming and chopping, taking the raw
FASTQ file(s) (single or paired end) and a set of user—defined param—
eters that include adapter sequences that may vary from default
Illumina adapters. The parameter file also determines whether the
FASTQ processing yields a FASTQC report, and whether it gener—
ates the graphs after trimming and chopping (for which the genome
sequence must be provided). These details are described in a
README file. This processing script is available from the web page
or can be downloaded from (https://github.com/atulkakrana/helper.
github.git). In summary, we have built a biologist—friendly web tool
that provides easy access to our previously—described algorithm for
3’ analysis of sRNAs (Zhai et al., 2013), generating reports detailing
the complexity of truncation and tailing modifications; this tool
should be particularly useful for characterizing the impact of muta—
tions in the pathways for sRNA stabilization or turnover.

Abstract

Summary: Single—cell RNA—seq (scRNA—seq) is emerging as a promising technology for profiling
cell—to—cell variability in cell populations. However, the combination of technical noise and intrinsic
biological variability makes detecting technical artifacts in scRNA—seq samples particularly chal—
lenging. Proper detection of technical artifacts is critical to prevent spurious results during down—
stream analysis. In this study, we present ‘Single—cell RNA—seq Quality Control’ (SinQC), a method
and software tool to detect technical artifacts in scRNA—seq samples by integrating both gene ex—
pression patterns and data quality information. We apply SinQC to nine different scRNA—seq data—
sets, and showthat SinQC is a useful tool for controlling scRNA—seq data quality.

1 Introduction

Single—cell RNA—seq (scRNA—seq) provides a relatively unbiased
approach to characterize and dissect the heterogeneity of cells in
complex mixtures (Eberwine et 61]., 2014). However, one of the
major challenges of this technology is distinguishing biological het—
erogeneity from technical artifacts (cells with substantial technical
noise that makes their gene expression patterns distinguished from
other cells) (Sandberg, 2014; Stegle et 61]., 2015).

To detect potential technical artifacts in scRNA—seq, previous
studies have used various strategies that can be generally grouped
into three categories. The first category involves using housekeeping
genes to perform QC. For example, cells not expressing housekeep—
ing genes (e.g. Actb, Gapdh) or abnormally expressing them are fil-
tered out (Ting et 61]., 2014; Treutlein et 61]., 2014). The assumption
of methods in this category is that housekeeping genes are highly
and consistently expressed, which is not necessarily true for single
cells. For example, a study using single—cell qPCR not only showed
that the gene expression of housekeeping genes had high variation
between individual cells but also that gene expression expression of
housekeeping genes can even distinguish cell types (Oyolu et 61].,

2012). Thus, a reliance on housekeeping genes to perform QC can
result in removing cells with real biological variation. The second
category involves using overall gene expression patterns to define
technical artifacts. For example, cells are excluded from further ana—
lysis if they cluster separately from the rest of the cells (Zeisel et 61].,
2015) or if their median expression values fall below a certain
threshold (Pollen et 61]., 2014). The major problem of the methods in
this category is that they can potentially discard cells with real biolo—
gical variation. The third category involves using the number of
genes detected (per some defined expression threshold) and/or the
reads mapping rate to define technical artifacts (Kumar et 61]., 2014).
However, the number of genes detected and mapping rate vary
among experiments depending on the quality of a particular library,
cell type, or RNA—protocol. Hence, the cutoff settings are typically
arbitrary. Thus, although single—cell approaches hold great promise
in exploring heterogeneity within a cell population or complex mix-
ture, QC still remains a major challenge (Stegle et 61]., 2015).

In this study, we present ‘Single—cell RNA—seq Quality Control’
(SinQC), a method and software tool for detecting technical artifacts
in scRNA—seq samples. SinQC assumes that if gene expression out—
liers are also associated with poor sequencing library quality (poor

data quality, e.g. low mapped reads, low mapping rate or low li-
brary complexity), then they are more likely to be technical artifacts
than to be cells with real biological variation.

2 Method

A detailed description of the SinQC algorithm can be found in
Supplementary Data. Brieﬂy, given a batch of scRNA—seq data,
SinQC first uses gene expression patterns to detect outliers. SinQC
assumes that gene expression outliers contain both cells with real
biological variation and technical artifacts, but the rest of the cells
(main population cells) in general, are more likely to contain good
quality cells. Thus, SinQC uses cells of the main population as con—
trols to estimate data quality cutoffs and a corresponding false posi—
tive rate (FPR). For each sample, SinQC calculates two data quality
meta—scores: Minimal Quantile Score (MQS) and Weighted
Combined Quality Score (WCQS) by combining a set of data quality
metrics (total number of mapped reads, mapping rate and library
complexity). These two data quality meta—scores represent whether
a sample has significant deficiency in any of the three quality metrics
or the overall quality metrics are low, respectively. SinQC deter—
mines these two data quality meta—score cutoffs by allowing a min-
imal fraction (user—defined) of cells of the main population to fail to
pass these cutoffs. The technical artifacts are defined as gene expres—
sion outliers with poor data quality (Supplementary Fig. 81A). A
more detailed and comprehensive study of SinQC (e.g. comparison
with other QC methods) can be found in Supplementary Data
(Supplementary results and discussion).

3 Results and discussion

We applied SinQC to a highly heterogeneous scRNA—seq dataset
containing 301 cells (mixture of 11 different cell types) (Pollen et 61].,
2014). SinQC detected 12 technical artifacts (FPR < 5%). These 12
artifacts showed a significantly lower mapping rate but not fewer
mapped reads nor lower library complexity if compared with the
QC pass cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). We calculated the number of
genes detected (TPM > 1) for each cell. The artifacts detected have
significantly fewer genes detected if compared with QC pass cells
(P : 3.83e—07, 1—sided Wilcoxon rank sum test; Supplementary Fig.
S3). As shown in Figure 1, technical artifacts detected by SinQC
overall have fewer genes detected and/or lower mapping rates,
which is similar to using a ‘genes detected and/or mapping rate’
method to do quality control (Kumar et 61]., 2014). However, SinQC
has the advantage of not having to arbitrarily choose thresholds for
the number of genes detected or mapping rate. Moreover, SinQC
uses data quality meta—scores (Section 2) instead of only using map-
ping rate to represent data quality for each sample. The following
examples will further demonstrate that integrating more universal
data quality metrics is helpful to detect technical artifacts.

We next applied SinQC to another eight scRNA—seq datasets,
including six batches of human H1 ES cells (H1-Exp1 : 72 cells, H1-
Exp2 : 81 cells, H1-Exp3 : 75 cells, G1 = 91 cells, S = 80 cells and
G2 = 76 cells) (Leng et 61]., 2015) and two mouse datasets (ES :48
cells and MEF : 44 cells) (Islam et 61]., 2011). We ran SinQC separ—
ately for each dataset. As shown in Supplementary Figure S4, the
technical artifacts (FPR < 5%) identified by SinQC either have sig—
nificantly fewer mapped reads, and/or lower mapping rate, and/or
lower library complexity compared with cells that pass QC. Among
eight low—heterogeneity scRNA—seq datasets tested, all except
Human G1 show significantly fewer number of genes detected in

artifacts if compared with the QC pass cells (Supplementary Table
S1). Human G1 shows marginal overlap of 95% of CI between arti—
facts and the QC pass cells (Supplementary Table S1). This indicates
that artifacts identified by SinQC overall have lower number of
genes detected and are also associated with poor data quality. The
technical artifacts detected by SinQC overall have fewer genes de—
tected if compared with QC pass cells. But this does not mean that
the cells with fewer genes detected are technical artifacts. The num—
ber of genes detected is determined by both data quality and cell type
(a detailed discussion can be found in Supplementary Data
(Supplementary Results and Discussion)). By integrating both gene
expression and data quality information, SinQC maximizes the
probability that the technical artifacts are correctly detected while
also minimizing the false positives by using cells of the main popula—
tion as data quality controls.

If a single-cell RNA-seq experiment contains hundreds or thou—
sands cells, it is likely that they are processed in several experimental
batches. For our lab—generated human embryonic stem cell (ES)
datasets (Leng et 61]., 2015 ), we processed them in three different ex-
perimental batches (H1-Exp1 : 72 cells, H1-Exp2 : 81 cells and
H1-Exp3 : 75 cells). We further compared the technical artifacts de—
tected (FPR < 5 %) if we run SinQC on each individual experiment
alone or we run SinQC on pooled experimental batches. We applied
SinQC to three pooled batches of human H1 single cell RNA-seq
data and detect 15 technical artifacts (H1-Exp1 : 12, H1-Exp2 : 3,
H1-Exp3 : 0) (Supplementary Fig. S9). However, if we run SinQC
batch by batch, we detect not only these 15 artifacts but also 11 add—
itional ones (Supplementary Table S1) (H1-Exp1 : 12, H1-
Exp2 : 11, H1-Exp3 : 3). This suggests that SinQC is more sensi—
tive if run batch by batch. This is because pooling batches will in—
crease the diversity of the population being studied owing to batch
effects in scRNA—seq datasets. Since SinQC uses relative measure—
ments to determine data quality cutoffs, the increased diversity in
pooled batches will relax the absolute data quality cutoffs thus
allowing more gene expression outliers to pass these cutoffs.

We then further investigated the sensitivity and specificity of
SinQC when different types of cell are mixed. We mixed two mouse
datasets (48 ES cells and 44 MEF cells) (Islam et al., 2011) in differ-
ent ways to simulate datasets containing different portions of subpo—
pulations. As shown in Supplementary Figure S5, the artifacts
detected by SinQC using different combinations of datasets are over—
all consistent with each other. However, we observe that SinQC in—
creases specificity at the cost of dropping sensitivity when the extent

of heterogeneity in a dataset is high. For example, if we ran SinQC
on each individual ES or MEF dataset, we can detect more artifacts,
if compared to running SinQC on pooled mixture datasets (e.g.
‘All’). However, the two artifacts (ESC_46 and ESC_32) which were
detected by pooled mixture datasets (‘All’) can be robustly detected
by running SinQC either on ES and MEF datasets separately or on
‘ES —1— 1/5 (MEF)’ or ‘1/5 (ES) +MEF’. In highly heterogeneous cell
populations, detecting technical artifacts carries a higher risk of
dropping real biological variation cells. The increased specificity
and decreased sensitivity of SinQC for highly heterogeneous cell
populations can minimize the false positives.

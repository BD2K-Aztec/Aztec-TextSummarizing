Abstract

Summary: Synthetic biology has become a widely used technology, and expanding applications in
research, education and industry require progress tracking for team-based DNA synthesis projects.
Although some vendors are beginning to supply multi-kilobase sequence-verified constructs, syn-
thesis workflows starting with short oligos remain important for cost savings and pedagogical
benefit. We developed BIOPARTSDB as an open source, extendable workflow management system
for synthetic biology projects with entry points for oligos and larger DNA constructs and ending

with sequence-verified clones.

Availability and Implementation: BIOPARTSDB is released under the MIT license and available for
download at https://github.com/baderzone/biopartsdb. Additional documentation and video tutor-
ials are available at https://github.com/baderzone/biopartsdb/wiki. An Amazon Web Services image

is available from the AWS Market Place (ami-a01d07c8).

1 Introduction

Synthetic biology projects require software systems to organize,
track and verify the creation of parts encoded by DNA sequences,
with individual parts corresponding to genomic elements such as
promoters or coding domains. Part sizes can range from 100 nucleo-
tide regulatory elements to megabase chromosomes. Tasks include
organizing an experimental plan, tracking protocols, retaining qual-
ity control assessments, assessing performance and storing a verified
part in a repository.

Biological enthusiasts, such as DIY Bio (http://diybio.org), edu-
cational initiatives such as iGEM (https://www.igem.org), and new
synthetic biology courses such as Build-a-Genome (Cooper et al.,
2012) all require workflow systems to match to DNA synthesis
protocols. Protocols depend on whether a DNA construct or part is
obtained by PCR amplification, restriction digest or direct synthesis,
and direct synthesis can involve different hierarchical assembly strat-
egies. Quality control procedures and parts storage, whether in a
vector or as DNA, can also depend on the synthetic route. While la-
boratory information management systems (LIMS) are available for

synthetic biology (Ham et al., 2012), they focus primarily on syn-
thetic DNA inventory management rather than on the synthesis pro-
cess itself. We therefore designed BIOPARTSDB as an open source,
modular tool for DNA synthesis workflow and parts registration,
providing a ready resource for research and education. Our permis-
sive license makes the software fully available for industrial and
commercial applications as well.

2 Results and discussion

2.1 Overall process and unit operations

Parts are constructed through a series of unit operations (Fig. 1).
Each operation has well-defined characteristics: (i) input reagents;
(ii) output products; (iii) status (e.g. pending, done); (iv) quality con-
trol metrics; and (v) a protocol for converting the input to output
and performing quality assessment (QA) and quality control (QC).
These must be fully specified at each step in the process, and a suc-
cessful QC, termed a ‘Pass’, is required for the products to advance
to the next step.

2.2 Target design and synthetic plan

Two user roles are implemented: admin and members. While mem-
bers can only run experiments, admin users are responsible for load-
ing parts data into the system, managing sequencing plates,
updating protocols and managing users. Admins assign parts to the
members for synthesis. Target sequences can be designed using de-
sign tools, such as BIOPARTSBUILDER (http://public.biopartsbuilder.
org), which is compatible with BIOPARTSDB.

2.3 PCB modules: synthesis plan to raw product
BIOPARTSDB enables two distinct routes from a synthesis plan to a
raw product: standard amplification from genomic DNA (sPCR),
and templateless PCR (tPCR) from overlapping oligos followed by
finish PCR (fPCR) of a target amplicon. ‘Templeteless PCR’ and
‘Finish PCR’ are nomenclature for the two steps in a polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) adopted from the Build-a-Genome course, in
which students learn synthetic biology by taking part in entire
chromosome synthesis projects (Cooper et al., 2012). The fPCR out-
put is a raw PCR product. The sPCR, tPCR and ﬂ’CR modules share
a common interface for usability. Each module has a home page
showing the workflow status (pending, finished) and available QC
reports for each experiment to assist with troubleshooting problems
including faulty PCR machines or reagents. The modules assist reac-
tion set-up by providing a map of source wells for input oligo plates
and computing reagent volumes for master mixes.

2.4 Size QC module: raw product to size-verified
product

Sizing is performed by gel electrophoresis, the first QC step for the
part itself. Parts must pass to proceed. A user’s module home page
lists that user’s gels, each assigned a sequential number by the soft-
ware. For each gel, the system displays the gel image, the loading
order and the QC value for each lane with a raw product. The user
can prepare a new gel by selecting PCR products of any kind; the
system will show a report page with the list of PCRs to load on the
gel and the loading order, which can be changed through a drag-
and-drop interface. Selecting the gel image permits the user to label
each lane with the corresponding PCR product. The system gener-
ates an image map and, when moving over a lane, displays the name
of the PCR product and the expected length. This feature is useful
for presentations and in-class discussions.

2.5 Ligation module: sized product to plasmid

Size-verified PCR products are introduced into vectors to create
plasmids. Ligation, Gibson assembly (Gibson et al., 2009), terminal
homologous recombination and TA cloning are examples of alterna-
tives that are compatible with BIOPARTSDB. When creating a new li-
gation experiment, the user selects a PCR product and the system
displays the protocol and the master mix aliquots for each reagent.
The ligation must be marked as ‘Pass’ to proceed to transformation.

2.6 Transformation module: plasmid to colony plate
Transformation introduces ligation products into a bacterial, yeast,
mammalian or other host cell. A new transformation is initiated by
specifying a ligation product and host strain; the system generates
experimental identifiers that can be reported on the plate for track-
ing. The transformation module supports blue—white colony screens
used for bacterial transformations to identify transformants and as-
sess transformation efficiency. The primary data collected are counts
of blue and white colonies, and a QC value is reported based on suc-
cessful recovery of transformant colonies. The blue—white screening
step is easily removed if desired.

2.7 Cloning module: colony plates to clones

The cloning module assigns unique identifiers to each colony and gen-
erates maps for growth plates. The input reagents for a new batch of
clones are the source transformations from which colonies will be
picked. The software reports a summary of the operation. Each clone
is given a unique identifier from an auto-incrementing index for each
part. The system also generates a 96-well plate map specifying the 10-
cations of colonies during growth; hardcopies of plate maps may be
placed underneath plates for easy colony picking. As a final step, the
colonies are marked as ‘Picked’ to proceed to csPCR.

2.8 csPCR module: clone to PCR product or restriction
digest

The colony screening PCR module takes clones as input, rather than
PCR products or other nucleic acids, and is designed for 96-well
PCR plates. Clones may be selected from growth plates correspond-
ing to multiple parts. The system then generates a PCR plate map
showing the protocol along with the aliquots for a master mix. After
running a csPCR, the user reports the experiments as ‘Finished’, or
‘Fail’ for an obvious error. The current software supports PCR but
could be modified to support sizing by restriction digest fragment
pattern instead.

2.9 Clone size QC: PCR or restriction product to size-
verified clone

The csPCR gel module requires csPCR products as input and is other-
wise similar to the PCR gel module. csPCR gels are the final pre-
sequencing QC; parts marked as ‘Pass’ may be sent for sequencing.

2.10 Sequencing module: size-verified clone to
sequence-verified clone

Inputs for the sequencing module are plates of clones, which may
correspond to multiple lab members and parts. The module tracks
the number of clones than can be sent, the number of wells available
and the clone locations. Clones that have passed csPCR QC are
picked from growth plates. The system then generates a plate map
for re-arraying the clones from growth plates onto a single sequenc-
ing plate. With this design, lab members can independently prepare

clones for sequencing and still take advantage of large sequencing
batches. Quality control values, ‘Pass’ for error-free clones, from ex-
pert or automated validation analysis (Lee et al., 2010) can be re-
ported through CSV files by an administrator.

2.11 Administration

The BIOPARTSDB system provides administrative module that are re-
sponsible for managing parts, oligo plates, vendors, lab materials
(strain, vectors), devices (PCR machines, gel boxes), sequencing
plates, protocols, users and groups.

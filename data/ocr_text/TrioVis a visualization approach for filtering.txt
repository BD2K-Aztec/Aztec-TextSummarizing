ABSTRACT

Summary: TrioVis is a visual analytics tool developed for filtering on
coverage and variant frequency for genomic variants from exome
sequencing of parent—child trios. In TrioVis, the variant data are orga-
nized by grouping each variant based on the laws of Mendelian inher-
itance. Taking three Variant Call Format files as input, TrioVis allows
the user to test different coverage thresholds (i.e. different levels of
stringency), to find the optimal threshold values tailored to their
hypotheses and to gain insights into the global effects of filtering
through interaction.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in massively parallel sequencing technologies,
especially sequencing of the entire protein-coding portion of the
genome (exome), have introduced new strategies for identifying
Mendelian disease genes (Gilissen et al., 2012). Analysis of
parent—child trios is one of the strategies for identifying single
pathogenic mutations among the thousands to millions of gen-
omic variants. By sequencing, the patient as well as his or her
parents, variants can be ﬁltered based on consistency or incon-
sistency according to the laws of Mendelian inheritance.
Although ﬁltering based on inheritance pattern seems to be
straight-forward, distinguishing true variation from artefacts and
false negatives while retaining sensitivity is a challenging task
because of the sequencing error rate and the interdependency
of sequencing quality for multiple samples. A previous study
(Bamshad et al., 2011) reported that >70% of Mendelian incon-
sistencies were found to be false negatives because of the failure
to call the germ line variant in either parent sample in search for
de novo mutations. Similarly, we found that the majority (77%)
of variants were consistent with the Mendelian laws when we
analysed those variants that are in common between the exome
sequencing and an SNP genotyping array for a trio-case (data
not shown). One of the metrics commonly used to ﬁlter variants
is the depth of coverage. Researchers we interviewed adjust the
coverage threshold based on the overall coverage and their

intuition without any Visual aids. The optimal coverage thresh-
olds also depend on other factors, such as the suspected type of
mutation, whether somatic or inherited, and the stringency of
analysis. Although ﬁnding the optimal coverage threshold can
be automated to some extent, it still requires ﬁne adjustments of
the ﬁltering setting for variant discovery.

We present a Visual analytics tool, TrioVis, designed to help
the analytical reasoning process of setting coverage thresholds to
ﬁlter variants from parent—child trio sequencing experiments. It
Visualizes variants in a structured table and provides interactive
Visual interfaces to let the researcher dynamically and inter-
actively test different threshold settings and change levels of
stringency.

2 FEATURES

TrioVis is a stand-alone, desktop application developed in
Processing (Reas et al., 2007), an open source programming lan-
guage and integrated development environment (IDE), based on
Java, and is available for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. It
loads three separate Variant Call Format (VCF) ﬁles, and
sample VCF ﬁles were generated using the GATK Uniﬁed
Genotyper (DePristo et al., 2011). It requires the AD (Depth
Per Allele By Sample) ﬁeld, which includes the unﬁltered count
of reference (REF) or alternative (ALT) reads. Based on these
read counts, variant frequencies for each variant are calculated.
A sample dataset, generated from the BAM ﬁles of Utah resi-
dents with Northern and Western European ancestry (CEU)
trios from the 1000 Genome Project (The 1000 Genomes
Project Consortium, 2010), is available for download.

The user interface consists of ﬁve sections: the main table
(Fig. 1A), the global variant count bar graphs (Fig. 1B), the
variant frequency sliders (Fig. 1C), the coverage sliders
(Fig. 1D) and the histogram View (Fig. 1E). Each section focuses
on a speciﬁc aspect of trio data and offers speciﬁc interactive
features to calibrate the thresholds. Father, mother and child are
colour-coded in green, orange and blue, respectively.

The main table (Fig. 1A) is divided into small multiples based
on the pattern of inheritance. Each block consists of three histo-
grams, conveying the distribution of variants based on the read
depth per sample. The background colour of each block is deter-
mined by whether it is consistent (white) or inconsistent (grey)
with the laws of Mendelian inheritance. The global variant count
bar graphs (Fig. 1B) represents the total counts of variants based
on whether it is consistent. By changing coverage settings, the

researcher aims to minimize the number of inconsistent calls
while keeping the number of consistent calls high.

The variant frequency sliders (Fig. 1C) Visualize the distribu-
tion of variants based on variant frequency values. These sliders
can be used by the researchers to adjust the ranges for variant
frequency for genotyping variants for that sample. By default,
any variants with variant frequency >90 are considered alterna-
tive homozygous, and any variants with variant frequency be-
tween 20 and 89 are considered alternative heterozygous. Any
variants <20 are ﬁltered out. The coverage sliders (Fig. 1D) set
the coverage thresholds for each sample individually. These sli-
ders also represent the distribution of variants based on coverage
values. Finally, the histogram view (Fig. 1E) represents the dis-
tribution of consistent and inconsistent variants in stacked bar
graphs with coverage values between 1 and 20 for the selected
sample. Hovering the mouse over the stacked bar graph high-
lights cells in the main table, showing where these variants are
represented. This View aids the researcher to calibrate the cover-
age threshold for the selected sample.

The variant data can be investigated under two assumptions:
with the ‘migration’ assumption, any variant below the coverage
threshold is considered homozygous reference; when this as-
sumption is inactive, variants below the coverage threshold are
considered invalid and discarded from the combined set of vari-
ants. Filtered results can be exported using the ‘export VCF’
button and saved as VCF ﬁles. The researcher can also select
speciﬁc blocks to export variants of a speciﬁc inheritance pattern
(i.e. de novo mutations and recessively inherited variants) for
further analysis. The ‘optimize’ function ﬁnds the best-weighted
average of the precision and recall (f-score) based on the number
of ﬁltered consistent and inconsistent variants, providing the user
a good initial setting for further investigation and adjustment.

3 CONCLUSION

TrioVis provides an interactive interface and optimization func-
tion to calibrate coverage thresholds based on Mendelian inher-
itance laws for parent—child trio cases. By Visualizing variants in

a novel table layout based on the inheritance laws, it allows the
researcher to gain insights into the global effect of ﬁltering in the
context of trio analysis. The researcher can export the ﬁltered
result as VCF ﬁles for subsequent analysis to annotate variants
to genes, using annotation tools, such as Annotate-It (Sifrim
et al., 2012) and Annovar (Wang et al., 2010). Future work in-
cludes improving the optimization algorithm, and integration of
this tool into functional annotation tools, such as Annotate-It
and Galaxy (Goecks et al., 2010).

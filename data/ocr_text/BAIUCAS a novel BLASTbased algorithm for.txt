ABSTRACT

Motivation: Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are often
found in the 5/-untranslated regions of eukaryotic messenger RNAs.
Some uORFs have been shown to encode functional peptides
involved in the translational regulation of the downstream main ORFs.
Comparative genomic approaches have been used in genome-
wide searches for uORFs encoding bioactive peptides, and by
comparing uORF sequences between a few selected species or
among a small group of species, uORFs with conserved amino acid
sequences (UCASs) have been identified in plants, mammals and
insects. Regulatory regions within uORF-encoded peptides that are
involved in translational control are typically 10—20 amino acids long.
Detection of homology between such short regions largely depends
on the selection of species for comparison. To maximize the chances
of identifying UCASs with short conserved regions, we devised a
novel algorithm for homology search among a large number of
species and the automatic selection of uORFs conserved in a wide
range of species.

Results: In this study, we developed the BAIUCAS (BLAST-based
algorithm for identification of UCASs) method and identified 18 novel
Arabidopsis uORFs whose amino acid sequences are conserved
across diverse eudicot species, which include uORFs not found
in previous comparative genomic studies due to low sequence
conservation among species. Therefore, BAIUCAS is a powerful
method for the identification of UCASs, and it is particularly useful
for the detection of uORFs with a small number of conserved amino
acid residues.

1 INTRODUCTION

Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are small ORFs located
in the 5’ —untranslated regions (5’ —UTRs) of many eukaryotic
mRNAs. Recent genome—wide analyses revealed that 10—50% of
eukaryotic genes contain one or more uORFs (Churbanov et al.,
2005; Galagan et al., 2005; Kawaguchi and Bailey—Serres, 2005;

Rogozin et al., 2001). The presence of a uORF can modulate
the translational efﬁciency of the downstream main ORF (mORF)
(Calvo et al., 2009). Regulatory roles of uORFs have been
demonstrated in processes such as the stress response and feedback
regulation of biosynthesis (Calvo et al., 2009; Hood et al., 2009;
Meijer and Thomas, 2002; Morris and Geballe, 2000; Vilela and
McCarthy, 2003).

Although the effects of most uORFs seem to be independent of
their amino acid sequence, several uORFs have been shown to affect
the translation of the mORF in an amino acid sequence—dependent
manner (Hanfrey et al., 2005; Ivanov et al., 2008; J ousse et al., 2001;
Morris and Geballe, 2000; Rahmani et al., 2009). For example,
in the translational feedback regulation of the Neurospora crassa
arg-Z gene, which encodes the small subunit of arginine—speciﬁc
carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, the 24—residue nascent peptide
encoded by the arg-Z uORF causes ribosome stalling at the stop
codon of the uORF in response to arginine, resulting in translational
repression of the mORF (Gaba et al., 2001; Wang and Sachs, 1997).
In plants, uORFs with conserved amino acid sequences (UCASs)
have been reported to be involved in the translational regulation of
four Arabidopsis thaliana genes (Hanfrey et al., 2005; Imai et al.,
2006; Rahmani et al., 2009; Tabuchi et al., 2006), and the importance
of uORF—encoded amino acid sequences has been demonstrated
in the translational regulation of the SAMDCI and bZIPll genes
(Hanfrey et al., 2005; Rahmani et al., 2009).

Although uORFs present only in a limited number of species can
have a regulatory role, it is more likely that evolutionarily conserved
uORFs have a regulatory function. Therefore, to identify uORFs
with potential regulatory roles, genome—wide searches for conserved
uORFs have been conducted using comparative genomic approaches
in various organisms, including mammals (Churbanov et al., 2005;
Iacono et al., 2005; Zhang and Dietrich, 2005), yeasts (Crowe et al.,
2006; CVijovic et al., 2007), plants (Hayden and Jorgensen, 2007;
Tran et al., 2008), insects (Hayden and Bosco, 2008) and fungi
(Neafsey and Galagan, 2007). Some of these studies searched for
UCASs to identify peptide sequence—dependent regulatory uORFs.
In plants, Hayden and Jorgensen identiﬁed 19 groups of UCASs
by comparing uORF sequences between orthologous genes of A.
thaliana and rice. Additionally, they found seven groups of UCASs
by comparing A. thaliana paralogous genes. These UCASs were
referred to as conserved peptide uORFs (CPUs) (Hayden and
Jorgensen, 2007). In mammals, uORF sequences were compared

between orthologous genes in human and mouse, and over 200
UCASs were identiﬁed (Crowe et al., 2006). In insects, 44 UCASs
were identiﬁed by comparing uORF sequences among dipteran
species (Hayden and Bosco, 2008). Thus, in these previous studies,
uORF sequences were compared between a few species or among a
small group of species.

In most bioactive uORF peptides that have been experimentally
shown to function in translational control, the region involved in
regulation is typically 10—20 amino acids long (Alderete et al., 1999;
Ivanov et al., 2008; Morris and Geballe, 2000; Rahmani et al., 2009;
Spevak et al., 2010). Therefore, it is important to detect homology
between such short regions for a comprehensive identiﬁcation of
UCASs. However, if uORF sequences are compared between only
a few selected species, the detection of homology between such
short peptide sequences largely depends on the species selected for
comparison. If the conservation of the uORF sequences among the
selected species is insufﬁcient to detect the similarity, then the uORF
would not be identiﬁed even if the uORF sequences are sufﬁciently
conserved among other species. If uORF sequences are compared
between closely related species, the observed similarity between
short uORF—peptide sequences may be due to nucleotide sequence
retention rather than functional preservation of the peptides.

To overcome these problems that result from the selection of
species for comparative genomic analyses, we developed a novel
method, BAIUCAS (BLAST—based algorithm for identiﬁcation of
UCASs), in which homology searches are performed using an
expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset derived from thousands of
species, and uORFs conserved in a wide range of species are
efﬁciently selected. Using this method, we identiﬁed 18 novel A.
thaliana uORFs whose amino acid sequences are conserved across
diverse plant species.

2 METHODS

2.1 BAIUCAS algorithm

We developed BAIUCAS to conduct an exhaustive search for
UCASs. This algorithm consists of a six—step procedure (Fig. 1).
The ﬁrst step is an exhaustive search for uORFs. The second step
is to perform homology searches of uORF amino acid sequences
against EST databases using tBLASTn. The third step is the selection
of uORFs on the basis of conservation of the stop codon position.
The fourth step is the selection of uORFs conserved across a wide
range of species by extracting uORFs whose tBLASTn hit—ESTs
with conserved stop codons are found in each of multiple taxonomic
categories. The ﬁfth and sixth steps are ﬁltering processes that
exclude ‘spurious’ conserved uORFs. In the ﬁfth step, we remove
uORFs with sequences that are contained within an mORF of a
separate transcript, such as a splice variant or a transcript from an
overlapping gene. In the sixth step, we select uORFs conserved
among homologous genes from diverse species to exclude spurious
conserved uORFs that were extracted based on false—positive
BLAST hits to biologically unrelated genes.

2.2 First step of BAIUCAS: exhaustive extraction of
uORFs
In the ﬁrst step of BAIUCAS, we identiﬁed uORFs by searching

for sets of start and stop codons in a 5’—UTR sequence database.
In this study, we used the TAIRlO A. thaliana 5’ —UTR sequence

database available on the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR)
website (http://arabidopsis.org/). Although uORFs that overlap their
associated mORF are usually considered uORFs, we focused on the
type of uORF that has both the start and stop codons within the
5’—UTR. In this study, we extracted each ORF that began with an
ATG codon and ended with a stop codon as a different uORF, even
if some uORFs share the same stop codon.

2.3 Second step of BAIUCAS: homology search of
uORF sequences using BLAST

In the second step, the nucleotide sequences of the uORFs were
translated into amino acid sequences, and homology searches of
uORF amino acid sequences were performed using tBLASTn (a
BLAST program) against the EST datasets available in the NCBI
database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). In this study, uORFs with
amino acid sequences longer than ﬁve residues were used as the
query sequences for homology searches, because peptides of less
than six residues are too short to detect signiﬁcant homology and
the known shortest bioactive uORF peptide involved in translational
control is six residues in length (Ruan et al., 1996).

2.4 Third step of BAIUCAS: selection algorithm based
on conservation of the stop codon position

In the third step of BAIUCAS, uORFs with conserved stop codon
positions were selected since the stop codon positions are well
conserved in previously documented sequence—dependent regulatory
uORFs (Franceschetti et al., 2001; Ivanov et al., 2008; J ousse et al.,
2001; Parola and Kobilka, 1994; Spevak et al., 2010; Wiese et al.,
2004). For this purpose, we developed an algorithm to calculate
the relative position of the stop codons between the uORFs and
their tBLASTn—hit EST sequences as follows (Fig. 2). First, the
entire nucleotide sequences of the tBLASTn—hit ESTs were obtained
from the GenBank EST database, and then translated into amino

the third step of BAIUCAS. The illustration depicts the process to determine
the relative position of the stop codons in the uORF sequences and tBLASTn—
hit EST sequences. (i) Because only partial translated EST sequences are
shown in the alignments of the tBLASTn search in Step 2, entire EST
sequences were obtained from the GenBank EST database to determine the
position of the stop codon in each EST. (ii) The entire nucleotide sequences
of the ESTs were translated into amino acid sequences. (iii) The relative
positions of the stop codons in the uORFs and the translated EST sequences
were calculated based on the distances between each stop codon and the
C—terminal amino acid residue in the sequence alignments of the tBLASTn
results. The asterisks indicate stop codons

acid sequences to determine the position of the stop codon. Next,
the relative position of the stop codon between the uORF and
the translated EST sequence was calculated based on the distance
between each stop codon and the C—terminal amino acid residue in
the sequence alignment of the tBLASTn results.

2.5 Fourth step of BAIUCAS: selection algorithm
based on conservation across taxonomic categories

Among closely related species, uORF sequences can be retained
by chance alone, independent of the function of the peptides they
encode (Neafsey and Galagan, 2007). Therefore, as the fourth step
of BAIUCAS, we devised an algorithm to ﬁnd uORFs conserved
across a wide range of species. In this algorithm, ESTs extracted
in the third step are classiﬁed into multiple taxonomic categories
according to the species from which the EST is derived, and uORFs
with at least one EST in each of the taxonomic categories are selected
(Fig. 3). In this study, to ﬁnd A. thaliana uORFs conserved across
eudicot plants, we divided eudicot species into the following three
categories: (i) plants belonging to the order Brassicales, (ii) plants
belonging to rosids excluding those belonging to the Brassicales
and (iii) plants belonging to eudicots excluding those belonging to
the rosids. To classify ESTs into these three categories, the genus
names of the species of the ESTs were extracted using information
in the GenBank EST database, as listed in Supplementary Table
Sl. Based on the genera, the ESTs were classiﬁed into the three
aforementioned categories using the NCBI taxonomy database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/guide/taxonomyl). We tested two
different selection criteria, Selection A and B. In Selection A, we
selected uORFs that had at least one extracted EST in each of the
three categories (Fig. 3A). uORFs conserved beyond the rosid group
are expected to be extracted by this selection. Because the rosid
group is one of two large groups in the eudicots, it is expected
that selection of uORFs conserved beyond rosids will enable us
to identify uORFs conserved across a wide range of eudicots. In
Selection B, we selected uORFs that had at least one extracted EST

represent the three eudicot categories deﬁned in this study (see Methods).
The ﬁlled squares in the ellipses show the tBLASTn—hit ESTs with conserved
stop codons that were classiﬁed into the three categories. As illustrated in (A)
and (B), we selected uORFs that had at least one tBLASTn hit in each of the
three categories (Selection A) or each of the categories (i) and (ii) (Selection
B). As illustrated in (C), we ﬁltered out uORFs that had tBLASTn hits only
in Brassicales

in both of the categories (i) and (ii) (Fig. 3B). uORFs conserved
beyond Brassicales are expected to be extracted by this selection.
This selection will allow us to identify uORFs conserved among
smaller taxonomic groups than Selection A.

2.6 Fifth step of BAIUCAS: decision algorithm for the
removal of uORFs that overlap with a CDS

In cases where a uORF is contained within the mORF of another
splice variant (Fig. 4A), the uORF sequence may be conserved due
to functional preservation of the protein encoded by the mORF,
independent of the function of the uORF. In addition, in cases where
the 5’ —UTR of a gene overlaps with the mORF region of another
gene, the uORF sequence in the 5’ —UTR may be conserved due to
functional preservation of the protein encoded by the overlapping
mORF (Fig. 4B). To exclude these types of spurious conserved
uORFs, as the ﬁfth step of BAIUCAS, we developed an algorithm
to examine whether uORFs overlap with mORFs of other transcripts
by comparing the positions of the uORFs and mORFs in the genome.
In this study, to determine the start and end positions of the uORFs
in the A. thaliana genome, the positions of the start and end sites of
the 5’ —UTRs and the splice sites in the genome were obtained from
the TAIRlO 5’ —UTR database, and the start and end positions of
the uORFs in 5’ —UTR sequences were calculated. The start and end
positions of the mORFs in the A. thaliana genome were obtained
from the TAIRlO CDS database. To determine whether the candidate
uORFs overlap with the mORFs of other splice variants, the start
and end positions of the uORFs were compared with those of the
CDSs with the same AGI code (locus ID) as the 5’ —UTR that contains
the uORF. To investigate whether the candidate uORFs overlap with
mORFs of other genes, the start and end positions of the uORFs were
compared with those of CDSs with different AGI codes from the 5’ —
UTR that contains the uORF. In both cases, a uORF was ﬁltered out
if the start and/or end sites of the uORF were located between the
start and end sites of a CDS.

uORFs removed in this step are shown: (A) uORFs with sequences that are

overlap with the mORF of another gene

2.7 Sixth step of BAIUCAS: ﬁltering algorithm based
on homology between the mORF sequences

To exclude uORFs extracted based on false—positive BLAST hits
to biologically unrelated genes, in the sixth step, we determined
whether the candidate uORFs and their tBLASTn—hit ESTs were
derived from homologous genes. For this purpose, we developed
an algorithm to extract putative partial mORF sequences from the
EST sequences and examine whether the amino acid sequence
encoded by the putative partial mORF was similar to that of the
mORF associated with the candidate uORF (Fig. 5). Putative partial
mORFs were extracted from the EST sequences by searching for
ATG codons located downstream of the conserved stop codons
found in the third step. We deﬁned the longest ORF as a putative
mORF, irrespective of the presence or absence of an in—frame stop
codon. The extracted putative mORF sequences were translated
into amino acid sequences, and BLASTp searches were performed
using the sequences as queries to evaluate whether they were
similar to the protein encoded by the mORF associated with the
corresponding candidate uORF. In this study, the minimum query
sequence length was limited to 30 amino acids, and various E —value
thresholds were tested ranging from 1e_1 to 1e‘10. If the amino
acid sequence of the putative mORF in an EST showed similarity to
the A. thaliana protein derived from the same gene as the candidate
uORF, we concluded that the uORF and the EST were derived from
homologous genes. In this study, we selected uORFs with tBLASTn—
hit ESTs that were conﬁrmed to be derived from homologous genes
in at least one species of each taxonomic category used in the fourth
step.

BAIUCAS

Using BAIUCAS, which was developed in this study, we
exhaustively searched for A. thaliana uORFs whose amino acid
sequences are conserved across a wide range of eudicot plants. In
the ﬁrst step, 25 036 uORFs of 6960 genes were extracted from
the 27 101 5’—UTR sequences of A. thaliana (Supplementary Table
S2). In the second step, 16 913 uORF amino acid sequences, which
were longer than ﬁve residues, were used as query sequences for

Fig. 5. Selection algorithm for uORFs based on homology between the
mORF sequences associated with the uORFs in the sixth step of BAIUCAS.
The illustration depicts the process in the algorithm to determine whether a
candidate uORF is conserved among homologous genes. (i) A putative partial
mORF sequence was extracted from each tBLASTn—hit EST by searching for
ATG codons located downstream of the conserved stop codon. We deﬁned
the longest ORF as the putative mORF, irrespective of the presence or
absence of an in—frame stop codon. (ii) Using the amino acid sequences
of the putative partial mORFs as query sequences, BLASTp searches were
performed against the A. thaliana protein sequences in the UniProt database.
(iii) If the amino acid sequence of the partial putative mORF shows similarity
to an A. thaliana protein derived from the same gene as the candidate uORF,
we concluded that the uORF and the EST were derived from homologous
genes

tBLASTn searches. The tBLASTn searches were performed against
the following NCBI EST datasets: est_crei, est_gmax, est_hvul,
est_mtru, est_osat, est_slyc, est_taes, est_zmay and est_rest, such
that all plant EST data available at NCBI were included. Arabidopsis
ESTs were excluded from the tBLASTn searches. To identify short
bioactive uORF peptides, the tBLASTn searches were conducted
with an E—value cutoff of 1000. In total, 2 293 728 ESTs were
detected by these searches, and 4220 uORFs of 1780 genes were
extracted (Supplementary Table S2). To evaluate the performance
of BAIUCAS, we checked how many CPUs, which are UCASs
previously identiﬁed by Hayden and J orgensen (2007), were
extracted in each step of BAIUCAS. Although 54 of 58 CPUs were
extracted in the second step, four CPUs were ﬁltered out because no
tBLASTn hit was found (Table 1). Most likely, this is due to a lack
of ESTs containing these CPU sequences in the EST database.

In the third step, the relative position of the stop codons between
the uORFs and their tBLASTn—hit EST sequences were determined
(see Methods and Fig. 2). To determine how much difference in
the relative stop codon position should be allowed, we used CPUs.
The threshold of the distance between the stop codon positions was
varied ranging from 0 to 100 codons, and ESTs were extracted for
each CPUs with the various thresholds. Using the extracted ESTs,
we examined how many CPUs were extracted by Selection A in the
fourth step, in which we selected uORFs with any extracted EST in
all of the three eudicot categories deﬁned in this study (see Methods
and Fig. 3A). When the threshold was raised to six, the number of
extracted CPUs reached to the maximum (Supplementary Fig. Sl).
On the basis of this result, we decided to ﬁlter out ESTs in which
the difference in the relative stop codon position between the EST
and the corresponding uORF is larger than six codons. In this step,
298 565 ESTs were extracted in total, which corresponds to 3365
uORFs of 1421 A. thaliana genes (Supplementary Table S2).

Novel BLAST-based algorithm

 

In the fourth step, we tested two different selection criteria,
Selection A and B, as mentioned in Methods. In Selection A, by
selecting uORFs with at least one extracted EST in each of the
three eudicot categories, 849 uORFs of 372 genes were extracted
(Supplementary Table S2). In Selection B, by selecting uORFs with
at least one extracted EST in both of the categories (i) and (ii), 1046
uORFs of 464 genes were extracted (Supplementary Table S2). In
this step, 46 CPUs were extracted by Selection A, whereas 49 CPUs
were extracted by Selection B (Table 1).

In the ﬁfth step, uORFs that overlap with an mORF of a separate
transcript were removed. First, we ﬁltered out uORFs that were
contained within the mORF of another splice variant (see Methods
and Fig. 4A). In total, 441 uORFs of 202 genes were extracted
in this ﬁltering process (Supplementary Table S2). Two of CPUs,
AT2G31280 and AT5G03190 uORFs, were removed due to the
presence of splice variants in which the region corresponding to
the CPU was within the mORF (Table 1). As for AT5G03190, the
presence of a splice variant harboring a uORF—mORF fusion was
discussed by Hayden and Jorgensen (2007). Next, we eliminated
uORFs that were contained within an mORF of an overlapping
gene (see Methods and Fig. 4B). In this process, 242 uORFs
of 129 genes were extracted (Supplementary Table S2). All of
the remaining CPUs were ﬁltered out in this step (Table 1).
This is because we used the TAIR10 CDS database as the A.
thaliana mORF sequence dataset, and the previously identiﬁed
conserved uORF sequences are registered as CDS sequences in this
database.

Since tBLASTn hits with high E—values were included in the
second step, the homology search results may contain many false—
positive hits to biologically unrelated sequences. To exclude uORFs
based on false—positive BLAST hits, we examined whether the
candidate uORFs and their tBLASTn—hit ESTs were derived from
homologous genes by comparing their associated mORF sequences
using BLASTp (see Methods and Fig. 5). In the BLASTp analysis,
various E —value thresholds were tested ranging from 1e_1 to 1e_ 10.
We extracted uORFs with tBLASTn—hit ESTs that were conﬁrmed
to be derived from homologous genes in at least one species in
each of the taxonomic categories used in the fourth step. In this
ﬁnal step, 74 uORFs of 35 genes were extracted (Supplementary
Table S2). As mentioned in the Methods, in this study, overlapping
uORFs that began with different initiation codons but ended with
the same stop codon were counted as different uORFs. If such
uORFs are considered the same uORF, each of the extracted 35
genes contains a single candidate UCAS. Hereafter, we describe such
overlapping uORFs as the same uORF, and therefore 35 uORFs of 35
genes were extracted as candidate UCASs using BAIUCAS. Among
the 35 candidate UCASs, 30 of them were extracted even when
the BLASTp analysis was performed at 1e_10 of E—value cutoff.
The remaining ﬁve candidate UCASs, AT1G61460, AT2G05410,
AT2G27350, AT3G08730 and AT5G02480 were extracted when
the E—value threshold was raised to 1e‘2, 1e_5, 1e_3, 1e—5
and 1e_4, respectively (Supplementary Tables SS and S6). Using
full—length protein sequences or assembled EST sequences, we
further conﬁrmed these candidate UCASs are conserved among
homologous genes from diverse species.

As mentioned earlier, most CPUs were ﬁltered out in the ﬁfth
step. To examine how many CPUs would have been extracted by
BAIUCAS if they had not been eliminated for the artiﬁcial reason,
the 46 CPUs that were removed in the second part of the ﬁfth step

were applied in the sixth step of BAIUCAS. As shown in Table 1,
43 CPUs were extracted in this analysis.

3.2 Validation of the candidate UCASs

Although we excluded uORFs whose sequence is a part of an mORF
in the ﬁfth step using the A. thaliana CDS database, our ﬁlter could
have failed to remove this type of spurious conserved uORF if the
sequence information in the CDS is incomplete. To test for this
possibility in the 35 candidate UCASs extracted by BAIUCAS, we
manually examined the uORF sequences by BLASTx to determine
whether they were similar to protein sequences in any plant species.
In this analysis, the nucleotide sequences of the 35 uORFs were
translated in all three reading frames, and the deduced amino acid
sequences were used as query sequences for homology searches
against the UniProt protein database (http://www.uniprot.org/). Of
the 35 uORFs, there were 12 with hits in the N—terminal region
of proteins encoded by the mORFs of homologous genes from A.
thaliana or other plants, suggesting that the regions corresponding
to these uORF sequences are part of the mORFs of homologous
genes. Therefore, conservation of these uORF sequences is most
likely due to functional preservation of the proteins encoded by
the mORFs. We discarded these 12 uORFs as spurious conserved
uORFs. For seven of the 12 discarded candidate UCASs, we found A.
thaliana proteins in which the region corresponding to the uORF was
fused to the mORF. Comparisons of the protein sequences and the
corresponding full—length cDNA sequences (TAIR10) showed that
four of them appear to be spurious uORFs that arose due to errors
in the cDNA sequences. For three of the seven discarded candidate
UCASs, the BLASTx—hitA. thaliana proteins appeared to be derived
from splice variants whose corresponding mORF sequence did not
exist in the TAIR10 CDS database.

Besides the discarded candidate UCASs, The uORF sequence
of the AT2G11890 gene matched an A. thaliana protein, which is
similar to mammalian and fungal CDC26, a subunit of the anaphase—
promoting complex that is involved in cell cycle regulation. The
AT2G11890 uORF encodes the entire A. thaliana CDC26—like
protein, and the size of the AT2G11890 uORF—encoded protein
resembles those of the mammalian and fungal CDC26 proteins. In
addition, no uORF—mORF fusion protein was found in any plant
species as far as we searched by BLASTp using the AT2G11890
mORF—encoded protein sequence as query. These facts suggest that
the uORF and the mORF in AT2G11890 encode separate proteins,
and therefore we did not exclude this uORF from the candidate
UCASs. In the ESTs derived from angiosperms and gymnosperms,
an ORF encoding a CDC26—like protein is associated with a partial
ORF whose translated sequence is similar to the N—terminal region of
the adenylate cyclase. This suggests that the same transcript encodes
a CDC26—like protein and an adenylate cyclase in a wide range of
higher plants.

We also examined other plant homologues of the proteins encoded
by the mORFs associated with the other remaining 23 candidate
UCASs by searching for homologues with BLASTp, and conﬁrmed
that no homologous protein contain the region corresponding to
the uORFs. This result suggests that these candidate UCASs are
not part of mORFs but are authentic uORFs. From these candidate
UCASs, we further excluded AT3G08720 and AT3G08730 uORFs,
because these genes are orthologous to the rice LOC_Os03g21620
gene, which contains a conserved uORF identiﬁed by Tran et al.

(2008), and the reading frames of these A. thaliana uORFs are
different from those of uORFs conserved in other plant orthologs
(see Supplementary Fig. S2 for details). Among the remaining 21
candidate UCASs, 13 of them were extracted by both Selection A and
B, whereas 8 of them were only extracted by Selection B (Table 2).

To assess whether the sequences of the remaining 21 candidate
UCASs are conserved at the nucleotide level or amino acid level,
we calculated a ratio of non—synonymous to synonymous nucleotide
substitutions (Ka/Ks) for each uORF (see Supplementary Text 1 for
details of the method of the Ka/Ks analysis). A Ka/Ks ratio close
to 1 indicates neutral evolution, whereas a Ka/Ks ratio close to 0
suggests that purifying selection acted on the amino acid sequences.
Among the candidate UCASs, the Ka/Ks ratios of AT1G55760 and
AT3G49430 uORFs, which were only extracted from Selection B,
were close to those of negative controls (Table 2). Although the

Table 2. Candidate UCASs extracted by BAIUCAS

Ka/KS ratio of the AT1G72510 uORF was as low as those of the
other remaining candidate UCASs, it is not signiﬁcantly different
from that of its negative control. Therefore, we could not rule out
the possibility that this uORF sequence is conserved at the nucleotide
level. The Ka/KS ratios of the other 18 candidate UCASs were equal
to or less than 0.300, and signiﬁcantly different from those of the
negative controls (Table 2). This result suggests that these 18 uORF
sequences are conserved at the amino acid level but not at the
nucleotide level. On the basis of these results, we concluded that
these 18 uORFs are UCASs.

Among the 18 UCAS—containing genes, AT5G09330 and
AT5G64060 are paralogous genes and their uORF sequences are
similar to each other. Besides these, nine of the 18 UCAS—containing
genes have paralogous genes. However, in three of the nine genes,
their paralogues lack 5’ —UTR sequence information, and therefore

we could not address whether the UCAS sequences are conserved
in the paralogues. As for the remaining six genes, 5’—UTR sequence
information of their paralogues is available. However, none of the
5’—UTR sequences shows similarity to the corresponding UCAS
sequence, suggesting that the UCAS sequences are not conserved in
the paralogues.

Alignments of the 17 groups of UCASs and their homologous
uORF sequences from other plants are shown in Fig. 6. In these
alignments, we added uORF sequences derived from species in
which the uORF—containing gene was conﬁrmed to be homologous
to the corresponding A. thaliana UCAS—containing gene by using
assembled EST, cDNA or protein sequences. Eight of the 12 UCAS
groups extracted from Selection A are conserved beyond dicots. In
contrast, all of the ﬁve UCASs extracted only from Selection B are
only conserved among dicots, and one of them are only conserved
among rosids.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we developed BAIUCAS, a novel algorithm to
identify UCASs and identiﬁed 18 novel UCASs in A. thaliana using
BAIUCAS. The main feature of BAIUCAS is the comparison of
uORF sequences with EST sequences from a large number of species
and the selection of uORFs conserved across multiple taxonomic
categories. This feature increases the chances of identifying UCASs
compared with conventional comparative genomic approaches in
which the uORF sequences are compared between a few selected
species, because BAIUCAS can identify a UCAS even if it
is not conserved in certain species. In fact, conserved uORFs
corresponding to some of the UCASs were not found in certain
taxonomic groups. For example, although the AT4G12790 UCAS is
conserved in dicots and monocots, corresponding conserved uORFs
were only found in Solanales among asterids, which is one of two
large eudicot groups. In addition, although the AT1G30270 UCAS
is conserved in angiosperms and gymnosperms, no corresponding
conserved uORF was found in homologous genes of monocots.
This feature of BAIUCAS is considered particularly advantageous
for the identiﬁcation of conserved uORFs with only a small
number of conserved amino acid residues, because detection of the
homology of such uORFs is largely dependent on the selection
of species for comparison. In fact, we identiﬁed UCASs, such
as AT1G30270 and AT3G55050, with relatively short conserved
sequences. In addition, we identiﬁed UCASs, such as AT2G42880
and AT5G46590, with relatively low sequence conservation in
A. thaliana and only a small number of conserved amino acid
residues (Fig. 6). In this study, we tested two selection criteria
in the fourth step of BAIUCAS, and demonstrated that, by
using different selection criteria regarding taxonomic categories,
BAIUCAS can extract uORFs conserved among different ranges
of taxonomic groups. Although the selection of uORFs conserved
among smaller taxonomic groups [i.e. categories (i) and (ii)]
increased the risk of extracting uORFs whose sequences are retained
at the nucleotide level, such a selection led us to identify UCASs
more comprehensively.

The UCASs identiﬁed in this study can be classiﬁed into the
following two groups according to sequence conservation patterns:
(I) uORFs with highly conserved C—terminal regions and perfectly
conserved stop codon positions and (II) uORFs in which the entire
sequences or the N—terminal and middle regions are conserved.

Group I is composed of 10 groups of UCASs (Fig. 6, F, G, H, L,
K, M, N, O and P), whereas Group II consists of seven UCASs
(Fig. 6A, C, D, E, I, J and Q). In contrast to the Group I UCASs,
the position of the stop codons is not perfectly conserved in the
Group II UCASs, and differences in several codons of the stop codon
positions are observed among species. The features of the Group I
UCASs are consistent with those of previously reported sequence—
dependent regulatory uORFs, in some of which the importance of
the C—terminal amino acid sequence for translational regulation has
been experimentally demonstrated (Alderete et al., 1999; Spevak
et al., 2010). For two of these regulatory uORFs, cryo—electron
microscopy analyses have shown that the C—terminal regions of
the uORF—encoded nascent peptides interact with the ribosomal exit
tunnel when ribosome stalling occurs (Bhushan et al., 2010). To
assess whether the amino acid sequences of the UCASs identiﬁed in
this study indeed have a regulatory function, experimental validation
is necessary. For example, this can be validated by comparing the
effects of amino acid sequence alterations and synonymous codon
changes of uORFs on translation of the mORFs.

In addition to the identiﬁcation of the 18 UCASs, we also
demonstrated that BAIUCAS could extract 43 of the previously
identiﬁed CPUs. Taking these CPUs into account, BAIUCAS could
extract 61 A. thaliana UCASs, which are classiﬁed into 38 homology
groups. Although BAIUCAS failed to extract 15 of the 58 CPUs,
the reason why ﬁve of these were not extracted is that they did not
ﬁt one of our conditions that the amino acid sequence and the stop
codon position of a uORF must be conserved in the multiple eudicot
categories. Additionally, two of the CPUs were eliminated because
of the condition that a uORF must not be within an mORF of a splice
variant. In the sixth step, two of the CPUs were not extracted because
of low conservation in the N—terminal region of the mORF—encoded
protein. In this study, to assess whether A. thaliana uORFs and their
tBLASTn—hit ESTs are derived from homologous genes, we directly
compared A. thaliana protein sequences and amino acid sequences
encoded by putative partial mORFs within the EST sequences. If
the protein database expands to include a greater variety of plant
species in the future, an alternative approach would be possible, in
which full—length protein sequences corresponding to partial mORFs
within the ESTs are compared with A. thaliana protein sequences.
Such an approach may increase the number of conserved uORFs
that are identiﬁable by BAIUCAS.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that BAIUCAS is a
powerful method for the identiﬁcation of UCASs that makes it
possible to more comprehensively identify conserved uORFs than
conventional comparative genomic approaches. Because BAIUCAS
is particularly useful for the identiﬁcation of conserved uORFs with
a small number of conserved amino acid residues, the algorithms
used in BAIUCAS can be applied to the identiﬁcation of short
bioactive peptides besides uORF—encoded peptides, such as peptide
hormones.

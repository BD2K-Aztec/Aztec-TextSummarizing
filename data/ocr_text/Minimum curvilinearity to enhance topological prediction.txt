ABSTRACT

Motivation: Most functions within the cell emerge thanks to
protein—protein interactions (PPIs), yet experimental determination of
PPls is both expensive and time-consuming. PP| networks present
significant levels of noise and incompleteness. Predicting inter-
actions using only PPl-network topology (topological prediction) is
difficult but essential when prior biological knowledge is absent or
unreliable.

Methods: Network embedding emphasizes the relations between net-
work proteins embedded in a low-dimensional space, in which protein
pairs that are closer to each other represent good candidate inter-
actions. To achieve network denoising, which boosts prediction per-
formance, we first applied minimum curvilinear embedding (MCE), and
then adopted shortest path (SP) in the reduced space to assign like-
lihood scores to candidate interactions. Furthermore, we introduce (i) a
new valid variation of MCE, named non-centred MCE (ncMCE); (ii) two
automatic strategies for selecting the appropriate embedding dimen-
sion; and (iii) two new randomized procedures for evaluating
predictions.

Results: We compared our method against several unsupervised and
supervisedly tuned embedding approaches and node neighbourhood
techniques. Despite its computational simplicity, ncMCE-SP was the
overall leader, outperforming the current methods in topological link
prediction.

Conclusion: Minimum curvilinearity is a valuable non-linear framework
that we successfully applied to the embedding of protein networks for
the unsupervised prediction of novel PPls. The rationale for our ap-
proach is that biological and evolutionary information is imprinted in
the non-linear patterns hidden behind the protein network topology,
and can be exploited for predicting new protein links. The predicted
PPIs represent good candidates for testing in high-throughput experi-
ments or for exploitation in systems biology tools such as those used
for network-based inference and prediction of disease-related func-
tional modules.

1 INTRODUCTION

Detection of new interactions between proteins is central to
modern biology. Its application in protein function prediction,
drug delivery control and disease diagnosis has developed along-
side a deeper understanding of the processes that occur within
the cell. One key task in systems biology is the experimental
detection of new protein—protein interactions (PPIs). However,
such experiments are time consuming and expensive. Because of
this, researchers have developed computational approaches for
predicting novel interactions (You et al., 2010), intended also to
guide wet lab experiments. The topological prediction of new
interactions is a novel and useful option based exclusively on
the structural information provided by the PPI network
(PPIN) topology. This option for prediction is particularly con-
venient when the available biological information on the proteins
being tested for interaction (seed proteins) is incomplete or un-
reliable. One of the most efﬁcient approaches is the Functional
Similarity Weight (FSW) (Chua et al., 2006). Such method be-
longs to the large and well-established family of predictors that
are referred to as node neighbourhood techniques (Cannistraci
et al., 2013a), because to assign a likelihood score to any candi-
date interaction (i.e. a pair of non-connected proteins in the
observed PPIN), they rely on the topological properties of the
seed proteins’ neighbours. The set of candidate interactions is
then ranked. The main problem with these techniques is that
their performance is poor when applied to sparse and noisy net-
works (You et al., 2010).

In 2009, Kuchaiev et al. (2009) proposed a method for geo-
metric denoising of PPINs. The algorithm is based on the use of
multidimensional scaling (MDS) to preserve the shortest paths
(SP) between nodes in a low dimensional space. The predicted
interactions are scored according to their Euclidean distance
(ED) in the low dimensional space, following the principle that
the closer two proteins are, the higher the likelihood that they
interact (Kuchaiev et al., 2009). Although it is not explicitly men-
tioned in the article, the embedding method adopted by
Kuchaiev et al. is equivalent to Isomap (Tenenbaum et al.,
2000). In an independent study, You et al. (2010) proposed a
hybrid strategy based on network embedding to assign predic-
tion scores to candidate interactions. They exploited the notion
that a PPIN—or theoretically, any network—lies on a low di-
mensional manifold shaped in a high-dimensional space. The
shape of the manifold and the associated topology are deter-
mined by the constraints imposed on the protein interactions
through biological evolution. You et al. used a renowned mani-
fold-embedding algorithm, Isomap (Tenenbaum et al., 2000), to

embed the PPIN in a space of reduced dimensionality. Then,
they applied FSW to the embedded network (pruned according
to a cut-off on the ED) to assign likelihood scores to the candi-
date interactions. In general, the embedding strategy offers two
advantages: (i) the topological prediction performance is im-
proved even when networks are sparse and noisy; and (ii) the
computational time is reduced because the time required for the
network embedding is much lower than that required by node
neighbourhood techniques for computing the topological prop-
erties of each candidate interaction. A disadvantage is that if the
network is not a unique connected component, only the largest
connected component can be considered for embedding
(Kuchaiev et al., 2009).

Here, we introduce several variations of these approaches that
all together offer a new solution for topological link prediction
by network embedding. The first variation uses minimum curvi-
linear embedding (MCE) (Cannistraci et al., 2010) and its non-
centred variant, ncMCE (which is introduced for the first time),
to project the network on the reduced dimensionality space.
MCE is a parameter-free algorithm designed for the unsuper-
vised exploration of high-dimensional datasets by non-linear di-
mension reduction (Cannistraci et al., 2010). Recently, MCE
ranked ﬁrst among 12 different approaches (evaluated on 10
diverse datasets) in a study on the stage prediction of embryonic
stem cell differentiation from genome-wide expression data
(Zagar et al., 2011). This proof of power and robustness moti-
vated us to test its performance in the context of PPI prediction
by network embedding. In the second variation, we use the SP
distance (instead of the ED, as in Kuchaiev et al. and You et al.)
over the network embedded in the reduced space to assign the
likelihood scores to the candidate interactions. The method pro-
posed here undoubtedly presents a novel combination of steps.
We prove that the combination of ncMCE/MCE and SP
achieves excellent results, boosting the separation between
good and bad candidate links.

2 DATA AND ALGORITHMS
2.1 Network datasets

The main datasets analysed in this work comprise four yeast
PPINs. Yeast networks are the preferred benchmark for testing
topological algorithms to predict links because of the large
amount of information available for yeast, in terms of both de-
tected interactions and Gene Ontology (GO) associations (You
et al., 2010). The PPIs in these datasets are mainly physical inter-
actions, but also include literature-curated and functional links.
Details on the characteristics of the networks are provided in
Supplementary Section I and Table S1.

2.2 Network embedding algorithms

As this work focuses on link prediction based on network top-
ology, each of the abovementioned datasets can be represented
as an undirected unweighted graph G = (V, E) with a set of WI
nodes and a set of IE I edges, which is a set of two-element subsets
of V. Network embedding consists of ﬁnding a mapping (embed-
ding), M: V—> X, where Xis a set of points {x1,x2, ...,lel}
with x,- 6 Rd: i.e. each node of G is assigned a coordinate in a
space of d dimensions, such that some original topological

properties of the network are preserved in this low-dimensional
space. As explained in the Introduction, manifold embedding
algorithms can be easily adopted for network embedding, al-
though not all algorithms that learn manifolds are applicable
for this task: only those able to embed a topology starting
from a distance or adjacency matrix can be used. We chose to
compare MCE, ncMCE and Isomap (and Isomap —i— FSW)
against well-established unsupervised and supervisedly tuned
manifold embedding algorithms that accept a distance or adja-
cency matrix as input. The unsupervised embedding techniques
considered are Sammon mapping (a type of non-linear MDS)
(Sammon, 1969), and two force-based embedding techniques:
stochastic neighbourhood embedding (SNE) (Hinton and
Roweis, 2003) and tSNE (a variant of SNE) (van der Maaten
and Hinton, 2008). The supervisedly tuned techniques are local
MDS (Venna and Kaski, 2006) and neighbour retrieval Visualiser
(NeRV) (Venna et al., 2010). These methods are also force based,
but instead of using forces based on kernels (like SNE or tSNE),
they use forces based on neighbourhood graphs (Shieh et al.,
2011). Both local MDS and NeRV require a parameter A to be
tuned between 0 and 1. In this work, we assessed the perform-
ance of these two techniques using values of A from 0 to 1 in steps
of 0.1, and took the low-dimensional coordinates that yielded the
best prediction result (see Supplementary Sections 11.2 and 11.3).

2.3 MCE followed by shortest-path distance

MCE is a parameter free and time-efﬁcient unsupervised algo-
rithm for non-linear dimensionality reduction (Cannistraci et al.,
2010), which was presented as a new form of non-linear MDS
(see Algorithm 1 and Supplementary Section 11.1 for details on
the original version of MCE, the innovations proposed in this
article and details on MCE’s time complexity). Here, we propose
the use of MCE for embedding a network into a space of reduced
dimensionality. MCE performs the embedding of the network
connectivity distances measured over the minimum spanning
tree (MST) of the original network. This novel MST-derived
measure of connectivity was more generally formalized in a pre-
vious study as a non-linear measure that we refer to as minimum
curvilinearity (MC), and the pairwise MC distances between
nodes of the MST give rise to the MC matrix (Cannistraci
et al., 2010).

The fact that the MST is a neighbourhood graph that can well
approximate the main network information—offering a general
summary of the network topology—has been extensively shown
in different applications (Cannistraci et al., 2010; Shaw and
Jebara, 2009; Shieh et al., 2011), and in our case, this can be
particularly useful for denoising the information present in
PPINs. In fact, the false-positive (FP) rate of currently widely
used experimental technologies is signiﬁcantly high, sometimes
exceeding 60% (Kuchaiev et al., 2009).

MC tends to stress local topological distances and dilate large
connectivity distances (Cannistraci et al., 2010). A consequence is
that the use of MCE for embedding causes a sort of network
deformation when the network structure is compressed in a
reduced space of just a few dimensions. The deformation aug-
ments the separation between nodes far apart in the network
topology and maintains or reduces the distances between
nearby nodes (Cannistraci et al., 2010). This might be a point

Minimum curvilinearity for PPI prediction

 

of weakness for network visualization because it stretches the
network shape in the reduced space. However, it is a point of
strength for link prediction because it generates a non-linear soft-
threshold eﬂect—a type of gradual denoising (Cannistraci et al.,
2009) based on a non-linear transformation—on the network
connectivity distances measured in the reduced space. The soft-
threshold discriminates between candidate links of protein pairs
far apart in the original network topology (which earn large
score values because they are now connected by enlarged path
distances in the embedded space), and candidate links connecting
nearby proteins in the original network topology (which earn
small score values because they maintain or reinforce their topo-
logical proximity in the embedded space).

To maximally exploit the effect of such soft-thresholding, we
propose the use of the SP distance in the low-dimensional space.
As the network topology—mapped to a reduced space—should
now be sufﬁciently denoised by means of the MCE device, the
use of the SP (instead of the ED) appears to be a more appro-
priate way to assign distances between nodes because it obeys
the denoised network topology. This is even more reasonable
considering that each interaction is remapped in the reduced
space with a positive and deﬁnite numerical weight (see
Supplementary Section 11.1 and Fig. S2). In conclusion, we
expect the SP to be a congruous measure for converting the
topological discrimination obtained by the MCE soft-threshold
effect into a value. This computational engagement between
MCE as a technique for embedding (useful for denoising net-
works affected by FP interactions) and SP for determining net-
work-connectivity distance (effective when the networks are pure
or denoised, and present few FP interactions), gives rise to a
synergy that can boost the separation between good and bad
candidate links in the ranking.

2.4 Non-centred MCE

The expression crowding problem means that after dimension
reduction, data clusters collapse on top of each other in the
reduced embedding space (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008).
This problem has particular relevance in network embedding
because we want to avoid diverse network components collap-
sing in the same region of the reduced space, as this can cause
incorrect link predictions. For this reason, we decided to intro-
duce the ncMCE and test its performance in solving the crowd-
ing problem.

Here, we propose a new version of MCE as an inedited form
of non-linear-kernel principal component analysis. In this new
version, the MC matrix is interpreted as a non-linear and par-
ameter-free kernel, and MC is a non-linear and parameter-free
measure that produces a distance transformation stored in the
MC kernel (previously referred to as the MC matrix). The ﬁrst
step of the new algorithm remains unaltered, while the embed-
ding of the MC kernel is now executed by singular value decom-
position (SVD) according to the following procedure: (i) centring
of the MC kernel; and (ii) SVD decomposition of the centred
MC kernel, followed by the embedding in an arbitrary dimen-
sion. An advantage of the new algorithm is that the centring of
the MC kernel can be omitted (see Algorithm 1 and
Supplementary Fig. S1). In practice, this generates a different
dimension-reduction device, which we refer to as non-centred

MCE (ncMCE). There is no universal rule for when centring
transformation should be used in the analysis. Nevertheless,
non-centring has been shown to offer several advantages
(Basnet, 1993; J olliffe, 2002). This is particularly evident in visu-
alization tasks, when the set of points that form each cluster is
distributed around the centre of the mass in the high-dimensional
space. If we perform embedding in two dimensions after the
centring transformation, the points tend to overlap around the
origin of the ﬁrst two dimensions, which is a typical example of
the crowding problem. However, in most cases, executing the
embedding without centring can signiﬁcantly reduce this issue.
In addition, omission of the MC kernel centring means that
ncMCE has a time complexity of (9(l Vlz), and thus is more ef-
ﬁcient than the other considered embedding techniques, such as
MCE and Isomap, that have a time complexity of (9(l Vl3). For
this reason, ncMCE also offers a signiﬁcant computational ad-
vantage for handling very large networks (see Supplementary
Section 11.1.2 and Table S2).

The new algorithm for ncMCE and MCE is available on the
website indicated in the abstract.

2.5 Node neighbourhood methods

To assess interaction reliability, several node neighbourhood
techniques for link prediction have been proposed to exploit
the topology of a PPIN, such as Interaction Generality (IGl)
(Saito et al., 2002), IG2 (Saito et al., 2003) and IRAP (Chen
et al., 2005), or to predict protein function, such as the
Czekanowski-Dice Dissimilarity (CDD) (Brun et al., 2003) and
FSW (Chua et al., 2006). These techniques have also been used
to predict PPIs based on the topological properties of the neigh-
bours of candidate protein pairs (You et al., 2010). As shown in
Chen et al. (2006) and Chua et al. (2006) and mentioned in You
et al. (2010), FSW and CDD outperform IGl, IG2 and IRAP.
Because of this evidence, and considering that IG2 and IRAP are
very computationally expensive (Chen et al., 2005), we decided to
use only IGl (as a baseline), CDD and FSW (details and

3 METHODS

3.1 Testing the proposed innovations

3.1.1 Fraction of FPs visited by MC and SP We generated 1000
random geometric graphs (for details see section 3.1.4) with small-world
and scale-free topology, which are properties common to real biological
and PPI networks. Each network had 1000 nodes and was modelled with
levels of noise similar to those of real PPINs: around 40% false negatives
(FNs) and 60% FPs (Kuchaiev et al., 2009). We counted the fraction of
unique FPs visited out of the total number of FPs present when comput-
ing SPs between all node pairs over the entire network (ﬁrst step of the
Isomap algorithm) and over the MST (ﬁrst step of the MCE algorithm).

3.1.2 Solving the crowding problem Although it is not a biological
dataset, the radar signal dataset is a point of reference in machine learning
and is an important benchmark for testing the ability of embedding tech-
niques to solve the crowding problem (Shieh et al., 2011). Instead of
creating an artiﬁcial dataset, we decided to use a real one to test whether
ncMCE is able to solve the crowding problem and, as a result, better
embed networks into low dimensions. The radar signal dataset is highly
non-linear and has 351 samples characterized by two classes: good radar
signals that are highly similar, and bad radar signals that are highly dis-
similar (Shieh et al., 2011).

3.1.3 Discrimination between good and bad candidate
links Following Kuchaiev et al. (2009) and You et al. (2010), for
each of the four considered yeast networks, we ﬁtted a non-paramet-
ric estimate to the distribution of low-dimensional distances between
connected nodes in the network p(distance|original) and another one
to the distribution of distances between non-adjacent nodes
p(distancelcandidate). We used the Mann—Whitney non-parametric test
to determine whether there was a statistically signiﬁcant difference be-
tween p(distance|original) and p(distancelcandidate) over the different di-
mensions of embedding.

3.1.4 Evaluation on random geometric graphs Random geometric
graphs (RGGs) are important because there is indication that they can be
good models for networks such as PPINs (Przulj et al., 2004). We gen-
erated RGGs by accommodating 1000 points uniformly at random in the
lOO-dimensional unitary cube and then connected them if and only if the
dot product (similarity) between the vectors with tails in the origin and
heads over these points was above a connectivity threshold r. We set the
threshold by ensuring that properties common to real biological networks
(small-world and scale-free topologies) and connectivity were present.
The advantage of using RGGs to test our innovations is that the sets
of true and spurious interactions are clearly deﬁned: true interactions are
those that fulﬁl the threshold and spurious links are those that do not.
Based on this, we generated noise in the structure of 1000 different RGGs
(noisy networks) in amounts typical of PPINs (40% FNs and 60% FPs)
and performed a sparsiﬁcation experiment in which the embedding pre-
dictors (a detailed explanation of how embedding prediction works is
given in section 3.2 and Fig. l) were adopted to rediscover the removed
true interactions present in the generated RGG. During this test, the
networks were embedded into dimensions 1 to 10, which is the recom-
mended range for testing the performance of Isomap (You et al., 2010).
Next, we repeated the experiment to assess the performance of the embed-
ding predictors on a sparsiﬁcation experiment over 1000 different RGGs
without noise (clean networks).

3.2 General prediction and GO-based evaluation
framework

The ﬂow diagram in Figure 1 depicts the required steps for link prediction
and GO-based performance evaluation in PPINs. In the prediction phase,
the original network lying in the high-dimensional space is represented as
an adjacency matrix A with entries A,” = 1 if nodes i and j interact and
A,” = 0 otherwise (each of these non-adjacent pairs of nodes is con-
sidered a candidate interaction). Next, the network is embedded into a
reduced space (initially of dimension 1) where both the original network
links and the candidate edges are scored by means of either ED (as in
Kuchaiev et al. and You et al.) or SP (our proposed variation, see section
2.3). Both sets of links are then ranked (see table of scored interactions in
Fig. 1). A criterion (based on the ranked list) is used to automatically
determine an appropriate dimension into which the network should be
embedded (see sections 3.3 and 4). If the criterion is not fulﬁlled, the
above procedure is repeated for a higher dimension, otherwise it stops
and a list is output using only the ranked candidate interactions (see table
of scored candidate interactions in Fig. l). The code that takes A as input
and provides the scored list of candidates as the output is available on the
website provided in the abstract.

The evaluation phase is speciﬁc to PPINs and follows the same gene
ontology (GO) strategy adopted in past studies (Chen et al., 2005, 2006;
Saito et al., 2002, 2003; You et al., 2010). The proteins involved in the
interactions from the candidate list are annotated via GO terms (molecu-
lar function or MF, biological process or BP, and cellular compartment
or CC). If the terms associated with a protein pair have a high Wang’s
GO semantic similarity (see Supplementary Section IV.2), the PPI is

Minimum curvilinearity for PPI prediction

 

considered to be biologically relevant (marked with a Yes in the table in
Fig. l) and is used to quantify the precision of the predictors. G0 is used to
assess how precisely the prediction techniques place candidate interactions
that are likely to be real at the top of the ranking list (You et al., 2010). A
recursive procedure is applied to create a precision curve. Each time, an
increasing fraction of candidate PPIs (the ﬁrst 100, the ﬁrst 200 and so on)
is taken from the top of the list of ranked candidate interactions for con-
sideration. The fraction of candidate interactions that are relevant to GO
generates a point on a precision curve. Conventionally, a number of top-
ranked candidate links, equivalent to 10% of the links in the original net-
work, is used to compute the entire precision curve (You et al., 2010). We
also examine the curve generated for a number of candidates equal to
100% of the original network links (see Supplementary Section 1W. The
area under the precision curve (AUP)—normalized with respect to the x-
axis so that it ranges from 0 to l—summarizes the performance of the
prediction technique for a given network. Precision and AUP are the pre-
ferred statistics (Chen et al., 2005, 2006; Saito et al., 2002, 2003; You et al.,
2010) for evaluating the predicted links in biological networks, owing to
their noisy nature. Having a non-adjacent pair of proteins in PPINs does
not mean they cannot interact at all, and we cannot label the missing
interaction as a TN. It is quite possible that these proteins have not yet
been tested for interaction, or that it is experimentally difﬁcult to do so (see
Supplementary Section IV). As a result, performance statistics that do not
rely on the number of TNs, such as Precision, are more suitable in this
context than others, such as the AUC.

We also propose an innovative strategy for evaluating the performance
of a link prediction technique at different levels of random sparsiﬁcation
of the original PPIN. Given a network G = (V, E), we generated an initial
set of 50 sparsiﬁed networks by removing a ﬁxed portion of links
e = 0.1 |E|(10% of links) uniformly at random from the original topology
(sparsiﬁcation process). Then, we generated a second set of 50 sparsiﬁed
networks by removing the same ﬁxed amount of links, e, uniformly at
random from the networks sparsiﬁed in the previous step (a total of 20%
of links removed). This process was repeated several times up to the point
where network connectivity was lost. The AUP of each prediction tech-
nique was computed for each percentage (proportion of links removed)
for the 50 networks, and the average AUP is reported as a sparsiﬁcation
curve. In addition, the area under this sparsiﬁcation curve is useful for
quantifying the robustness of a technique as a function of the network
sparsity, which is one of the main issues for current link predictors (You
et al., 2010).

Some GO annotations may be subject to experimental bias or come
from not very reliable sources (Rhee et al., 2008). To address this issue,
and as an additional veriﬁcation of the candidate interactions proposed by
the best techniques, we performed what we call an in-silico validation. We
took the top 100 candidate interactions proposed by the best techniques
and intersected them with the entire STRING Database (Szklarczyk et al.,
2011) in March 2013. STRING is the most complete compendium of PPIs
found in the literature, experiments, coexpression, etc. Given a list of pro-
teins, it ﬁnds the interactions between them along with an assigned conﬁ-
dence value based on the available evidence that they exist. The output of
this validation was used to compute (i) the number of protein pairs vali-
dated for each network out of the top 100; (ii) the average STRING con-
ﬁdence along with its standard deviation; and (iii) the average GO
conﬁdence along with its standard deviation. Note that this validation
was carried out for candidate interactions only, and the PPIs of the used
main network datasets were not considered in this analysis. Therefore, the
overlap between the studied networks and STRING is unlikely to inﬂuence
the results (see Supplementary Section I).

3.3 The AUC criterion for dimension determination

The AUC criterion is designed to work in combination with any network
embedding algorithm adopted for link prediction: it automatically deter-
mines the dimension into which the network should be embedded (see

Supplementary Section 1141 for details). For a certain dimension of
embedding, the prediction procedure (Fig. l) assigns a likelihood score
to each interaction (low scores correspond to interactions that are likely
to occur and high scores to interactions that are not). The scores are
computed for both the original interactions in the network (0) and the
candidate interactions (C), which are all those protein pairs that were not
linked in the input network.

The scored 0 and C interactions generate two distance distributions
(see Supplementary Fig. S7 for an example). As suggested by Kuchaiev,
You and their teams, we can vary a cut-off 8, from 0 up to the maximum
distance of the two distributions, so that all protein pairs with scores
below 8 are considered positives and all protein pairs with scores above
8 are considered negatives (Supplementary Fig. S7). Kuchaiev et al. and
You et al. suggest that by taking the original network PPIs as our positive
set, we can compute the number of TPs, FNs, FPs and TNs at each 8 cut.
This will yield a pair (1-Speciﬁcity, Sensitivity) that, measured for the
entire 8 range, generates a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
(ROC) and an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) that characterizes
the performance for the current dimension (Supplementary Fig. S7). Both
research groups showed that the AUCs for different dimensions were
very similar and the increase in the AUC value tended to vanish for
higher dimensions; thus, they considered a ﬁxed dimension of 5 and 10
respectively for their experiments (You et al., 2010). We took advantage
of this ﬁnding (Supplementary Fig. S7) by computing the AUC for each
dimension, starting with dimension 1 and continuing until the difference
between the AUC of one dimension and the next was less than lE—3. In
several tests, we found that lE-3 represents such a small difference be-
tween AUCs that we can consider it not signiﬁcant; thus, the last AUC is
considered appropriate to identify the dimension for embedding. We then
took the scored candidate interactions given by this dimension for the
ﬁnal evaluation of the method used.

3.4 The resolution criterion for dimension determination

One of the motivations for proposing a second criterion was that the AUC
criterion considers the original network as a sort of gold standard, when in
reality it includes several false interactions (You et al., 2010). The new
criterion for dimension determination is based on the idea that the greater
the difference between likelihood score values, the better they discriminate
between good candidates and bad candidates in the ranking. Thus, we
need to deﬁne a measure of the resolution of the score values provided by
each dimension, such that the higher the measure, the higher the resolution
and the more we should consider this dimension as correct for embedding.
The measure we use for dimension determination is as follows:
ReSOIA” : o(unique(scores)) (1)
Dim
This formula takes all of the unique score values of the candidate
interactions in dimension Dim, computes its standard deviation 0 and
divides it by Dim. The unique score values give us an indication of the
Dim’s resolution. We then determine the quality of that resolution by
computing a, which quantiﬁes the variation between the unique score
values. Finally, the division by Dim penalizes the higher dimensions,
which have been shown not to provide any relevant increase in perform-
ance (You et al., 2010). We speciﬁcally designed this criterion to ﬁt with
the quality of MCE, which provides more of a soft-threshold effect in low
dimensions. This is why we only tested the resolution criterion in com-
bination with MCE. We also applied a variation of Equation (1) to check
whether dimension determination using only the ranked interactions be-
tween 0 and 100 would generate a better AUP. The difference between
Equation (1) and (2) is that in (2) we compute a on the unique scores
from the top 100 candidate protein pairs:

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Fraction of FPs visited by MC and SP

The results presented in Supplementary Figure S3 for the artiﬁ-
cial networks (RGGs) suggests that the estimate of non-linear
connectivity measure using the MST (i.e. MC) takes into account
only a small proportion of FPs, offering a denoised estimate of
the network connectivity. In contrast, using the SP over the
entire noisy network counts all FPs at least once, which intro-
duces a lot of noise into the link prediction process. The same
investigation was conducted on the four yeast networks, in which
the FP links were identiﬁed using the same GO-based strategy
mentioned in section 3.2. The outcome of this second analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S3) converged to the same result obtained
for the artiﬁcial networks. These ﬁndings support the hypothesis
that MCE should be a powerful tool for link prediction in noisy
networks. In fact, as noisier networks present more FP inter-
actions, the use of ncMCE/MCE in such cases should produce
an even greater increase in performance over the use of Isomap.
As current PPINs are sparse and noisy (You et al., 2010), the use
of ncMCE/MCE instead of Isomap should offer clear advan-
tages in network denoising and link prediction in the reduced
space. A proof of this is provided in the computational experi-
ment on RGGs discussed in section 4.4.

4.2 Solving the crowding problem

The ncMCE (Fig. 2A) offered the best embedding of the radar
signal dataset and attained high linearization (Fig. 2E) in both
the ﬁrst (AUC = 0.95) and the second dimensions (AUC = 0.96).
The ROC curve is used to evaluate the discrimination power
along a dimension of projection: if the dimension offers a
linear discrimination between the good and bad signals, the re-
spective AUC will be 1. We also tested the performance of
Isomap, which is a reference algorithm for non-linear dimension
reduction, but its embedding was highly crowded (Fig. 2C).

In contrast, Tree Preserving Embedding (TPE) (Shieh et al.,
2011)—a recent parameter-free algorithm for non-linear dimen-
sion reduction—produced non-linear discrimination (good sig-
nals in the centre and bad signals on the periphery) of the
clusters around the origin of the axis (Fig. 2D). This demon-
strates that TPE can address the crowding problem but cannot
solve the non-linearity of the dataset. MCE solved the non-lin-
earity in the second dimension (Fig. 2E), but only partially ad-
dressed the crowding problem (Fig. 2B). The only algorithm that
was able to simultaneously solve both the non-linearity and the
crowding problem in this dataset was ncMCE (Fig. 2A and E).
Interestingly, on the basis of the embedding offered by ncMCE
and MCE, one might speculate that the high dissimilarity be-
tween the bad radar signals pointed out in previous studies
(Shieh et al., 2011) could be interpreted as the presence of at
least two different kinds of bad radar signal clusters that are
difﬁcult to embed due to their high non-linearity (elongated
and/or irregular high-dimensional structure). The possible dif-
ferent bad-signal clusters are indicated in grey and black in
Figure 2. Finally, whereas only a few seconds were needed to
run ncMCE, MCE and Isomap, TPE took several hours to
embed this small dataset, and its current implementation can
be prohibitively slow for large datasets. As TPE is inefﬁcient

peated for each of the four techniques on the two dimensions of embed-
ding. To facilitate the visualization, we do not report the ROC for TPE
due to its poor performance

for embedding networks composed of thousands of nodes, we
could not evaluate its performance in the present study.

4.3 Discrimination between good and bad candidate links

Given the embedding of any PPIN, if the hypothesis that nodes
closer to each other in the reduced space are more likely to inter-
act is true, the network-link distribution p(distance|original)
should have higher peakedness (kurtosis) than the candidate-
link distribution p(distancelcandidate); in addition, p(distancel
original) should be shifted towards zero. The results in
Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S4 show that in all networks,
ncMCE-SP had the highest kurtosis and shift towards zero.
Moreover, links from the original network topology that are
distant from the origin are likely to represent false positives,
while non-adjacent nodes whose distance is close to zero are
good candidates for interaction.

Furthermore, Supplementary Figure S4 shows that in the four
considered networks, there was a statistically signiﬁcant differ-
ence between p(distance|original) and p(distancelcandidate). This
signiﬁcant difference was conserved across the different dimen-
sions, and was much larger when the SP scoring technique was
used in the reduced space. This indicates that SP should work
better than ED for scoring proximity distances between network
nodes (proteins) in the reduced space.

4.4 Evaluation on random geometric graphs

Figure 4A—C shows that the two variations of MCE (especially
ncMCE-SP using dimension one) were the strongest approaches
for re—predicting true interactions in 1000 RGGs with similar
levels of noise to those in real protein networks. Next,
Figure 4D—F shows that when we repeated this experiment in
1000 RGGs without noise, ncMCE-SP still had the best perform-
ance (using dimension 1), but Isomap-SP came signiﬁcantly
closer. However, as our RGGs are sparse, the number of candi-
date links is very large compared with the number of links
deleted during sparsiﬁcation. In such conditions, link prediction
is generally a difﬁcult task, and this justiﬁes the low precision

values in Figure 4 (see Supplementary Section 1111 for more
details). Altogether, these results indicate that (i) the use of
ncMCE presents a clear advantage over MCE; (ii) the lower
dimensions (especially dimension 1 for ncMCE) are very effective
when using ncMCE/MCE-based algorithms; (iii) the gap be-
tween ncMCE-SP and Isomap-SP increases in the presence of
noise, which especially encourages the use of ncMCE-based al-
gorithms in noisy networks such as PPINs; and (iv) the use of SP
(to assess the scoring in the reduced space) generally offers a clear
advantage over the use of ED. RGGs are crucial for designing a
ground-truth evaluation that allows us to directly observe the
effect of introducing noise (false interactions) in the re—prediction
of the real/original network topology. Because GO—free evalu-
ations are essential for demonstrating the performance of link
predictors in the absence and presence of network noise, the
ﬁndings here are our ﬁrst important results.

4.5 Evaluation using gene ontology

The novel approach we propose is based on the intuition that
network embedding by ncMCE/MCE combined with the SP
connectivity distance in the reduced space can boost the perform-
ance in topological prediction of candidate PPIs. In Figure 5, we
provide experimental conﬁrmation of our intuition (see
Supplementary Figs S11, S12 and S13, where we show that
even when the Molecular Function GO category is excluded,
when a wider candidate list of interactions is included in the
evaluation or when proteins involved in large complexes are
removed from the analysis, in general, our proposed approaches
outperform the others). MCE and ncMCE combined with SP
outperformed both Isomap and pure SP (computed on the ori-
ginal network without embedding) in all networks. Isomap

Fig. 5. Performance comparison between ncMCE, MCE, Isomap and
pure SP computed in the high-dimensional space. The x-axis indicates
how many interactions are taken from the top of the candidate inter-
action list (sorted decreasingly by score), and the y-axis indicates the
precision of the technique for that portion of protein pairs. Solid lines
indicate the use of the SP in the reduced space to assign scores and dashed
lines the use of the ED

performed even worse than pure SP in the ﬁrst network. Besides,
the simulation in Figure 5 suggests that in general ncMCE-SP
slightly outperforms MCE-SP; and Supplementary Figure S6
shows that ncMCE-SP even outperfomed Isomap —I— FSW.

In addition to the above results, there is evidence (Fig. 6) that
although we used several advanced techniques for dimensionality
reduction (both unsupervised and supervisedly tuned), ncMCE-
SP remained the overall leader, which represents our second im-
portant ﬁnding. Surprisingly, we discovered that even though
local MDS and NeRV were supervisedly tuned to achieve their
best performance, they could not equal ncMCE-SP. This result
suggests that force-based methods for embedding are not appro-
priate in this context, at least when combined with ED or SP in
the reduced space. The reason for their poor performance is that
these algorithms perform an embedding that ﬁnely preserves the
network topology, thus also preserving the noise. In contrast,
ncMCE provides a soft-threshold eﬂect (discussed in Section
2.3), which boosts the separation between good and bad candi-
date links in the ranking.

For completeness, we compared ncMCE-SP with FSW and
CDD, two of the most efﬁcient node neighbourhood techniques
(You et al., 2010). ncMCE-SP ranked ﬁrst, with a notable im-
provement, in the ﬁrst two networks (Ben-Hur and Noble 2005;

Chen et al. 2006; Supplementary Fig. S9), and second in the third
network (You et al. 2010 sparse, Supplementary Fig. S9). In the
fourth network, all of the techniques produced similar perform-
ances (You et al. 2010 dense, Supplementary Fig. S9). According
to the minimum precision curve attained in the four different
networks, ncMCE-SP was also the most robust technique
(Robustness comparison, Supplementary Fig. S9). FSW ranked
ﬁrst in the third network, while in the ﬁrst two networks its
performance was similar to that of CDD. Given these results,
we can conclude that ncMCE-SP offers a general improvement,
particularly in robustness, compared with the other techniques.

4.6 Testing the criteria for dimension determination

Another important variation we introduce here is the use of two
diverse criteria for automatically selecting the congruous dimen-
sion into which the network should be embedded. So far, in the
simulation showed in Figures 5 and 6, we used the AUC criter-
ion, which was designed to work with any algorithm for embed-
ding. Unlike the AUC criterion, the resolution criterion was
designed to ﬁt better with MCE, which provides more of a
soft-threshold eﬂect (thus stronger denoising) in the lowest
dimensions.

This is experimentally conﬁrmed in Supplementary Figure
SSA, where the peaks of the resolution criteria (both ResAu
and Resloo) are always in one of the ﬁrst two reduced dimen-
sions. From Supplementary Figure S8B, we gather that the AUC
criterion and the Res All criterion selected the same dimensions,
and thus show equal precisions. However, in terms of robustness
(Supplementary Fig. S8C), the Resloo criterion slightly outper-
formed the others. These results corroborate our intuition to
invent a new and radically different criterion based on the reso-
lution of the unique score values, which is an easy and time-
efﬁcient strategy.

4.7 Network sparsiﬁcation evaluation

To present a more reﬁned vision of the potential offered by
topological link-prediction techniques, we introduce a new evalu-
ation strategy called network sparsiﬁcation experiment (see sec-
tion 3.2 for details). This approach was used to generate the
results shown in Figure 7, which compares the main embedding
techniques (ncMCE, MCE and Isomap) and the reference node
neighbourhood techniques (FWS, CDD, IGl and SP). All of the
embedding methods were tested in combination with the same
distance (SP) to measure candidate-link likelihood in the reduced
space. Figure 7A and B display the sparsiﬁcation curves of the
ﬁrst two networks for ncMCE-R (R indicates the use of the
resolution criterion) and FSW that were the highest ranked
methods overall in their respective categories. Although
ncMCE-A (A indicates the use of the AUC criterion) attained
the same result as ncMCE-R in each network, for the sake of
clarity, we display only the curve of the latter. The methods were
ranked considering the area under the sparsiﬁcation curve
(AUS). To evaluate the general performance of the methods,
we considered the minimum AUS performance of each method
for all networks (Fig. 7C).

A special variation of this experiment was performed on each
network (Supplementary Fig. S5) to investigate whether the ex-
traction of different MSTs from the networks resulted in

Fig. 6. ncMCE-SP against advanced unsupervised and supervisedly
tuned embedding techniques. The x—axis indicates how many interactions
are taken from the top of the candidate interaction list (sorted by decreas-
ing score), and the y-axis indicates the precision of the technique for that
portion of protein pairs. Solid lines represent the performance of tech-
niques that use SP in the reduced space to assign scores and dashed lines
represent techniques that use ED. Although ncMCE-SP (red solid line) is
an unsupervised approach, it appears on both sides for reference

important changes in ncMCE performance. This is a possibility
because all of the network links have a weighting value of 1. For
this test, only ncMCE was used because it generally outper-
formed MCE, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. Here, for each per-
centage of link deletions, 100 different MSTs were extracted (by
random initialization). The AUPs attained by the different
ncMCEs (each of which uses a different MST) were averaged
and their standard error bars included in the sparsiﬁcation curve.
The standard error bars for the ncMCE’s sparsiﬁcation curves
(Supplementary Fig. S5) show that the difference in the perform-
ance of ncMCE when using different MSTs was negligible.

In general, MCE-based embedding techniques (red bins in the
histogram, Fig. 7C) outperformed the node neighbourhood tech-
niques (green bins in the histogram, Fig. 7C), and ncMCE was
again the best method. Taken together, our experiments suggest
that ncMCE-SP might represent a new benchmark for robust-
ness in the topological prediction of PPIs, and this is the third
main result of our study.

As a further investigation, starting with the ﬁnal set of
sparsiﬁed networks generated in the previous experiment, we

of the protein interactome. If a topology analogous to the ori-
ginal had been recovered, the prediction techniques would have
been able to achieve a performance comparable with that
reached before network sparsiﬁcation.

This ﬁnding emphasises the presence of preferential bio-infor-
mation in the PPIN topology that cannot be modelled by uni-
form random sampling of new interactions. Therefore, the simple
unweighted topology can be highly informative for different pur-
poses, one of them being the prediction of new interactions or
alternatively, as recently shown, the structural controllability of
any complex network (Liu et al., 2011).

4.8 In silico validation

As mentioned in the Introduction, the experimental detection of
PPIs can be very expensive in terms of both time and money. The
computational approaches we investigated to predict novel inter-
actions are meant to guide wet-lab experiments rather than to
complete the interactome of the organism under study.
Currently, the Y2H validation of 100 protein pairs can represent

a challenging upper limit to simulate a real scenario for the
budget of many labs. We decided to suggest different sets of
candidate interactions to test in wet-lab experiments, and we
report the evaluations for different thresholds: 20, 40, 60, 80
and 100. We executed an in-silico validation to verify the quality
of the candidate interactions proposed by the best techniques.
The top 100 ranked interactions for ncMCE-SP-Re3100 and FSW
were tested on the STRING database, which is the most com-
plete PPI database. The results for the different thresholds are
reported in Supplementary Figure S10E. ncMCE-SP-Re3100 at-
tained promising results in this last test, surpassing FSW for GO
precision (Supplementary Fig. S10A and D), GO robustness
(Supplementary Fig. S10B) and STRING conﬁdence robustness
(Supplementary Fig. S10C and D).

The list of the top 100 candidate interactions ranked by
ncMCE-SP-Re3100 is reported for each of the analysed networks
in Supplementary Table S1 and the respective list for FSW in
Supplementary Table S2. GO semantic similarities and STRING
conﬁdence values are also included. To search for the biological
information related to the interactions predicted by ncMCE-SP-
Resloo and validated in STRING, for each network we per-
formed a pathway enrichment analysis using DAVID
Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (Huang da et al., 2009a, b). For
each network, the list of proteins involved in the predicted and
validated interactions was tested against all network proteins as
background. This kind of background choice was motivated by
the fact that it tends to produce more conservative P-values and,
in fact, a general guideline for the enrichment analysis is to use a
narrowed-down list of genes instead of all genes in the genome
(Huang da et al., 2009a, b). In addition, the Benjamini correction
for multiple hypotheses test was applied. The results of the ana-
lysis (reported in Supplementary Table S3) emphasize that the
lists of predicted and STRING-validated protein interactions
have signiﬁcant biological meaning in at least one pathway for
each of the investigated networks. Interestingly, the predicted
proteins were involved in cellular processes (eg. cell cycle), nu-
cleotide metabolism (e. g. pyrimidine and purine metabolism) and
genetic information processes (eg. RNA polymerase and RNA
degradation). This evidence suggests that the proposed method
predicted interactions in different network modules that are
related to signiﬁcant and heterogeneous pathways in yeast.

5 CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVE

Considering the difﬁculty of dealing with sparse and noisy pro-
tein networks (You et al., 2010), our results represent a promis-
ing achievement and encouragement to further the investigation
of network embedding techniques for topological prediction of
candidate protein interactions. In our tests, the ncMCE showed
enhanced performance in network embedding-based link predic-
tion compared with the other dimension-reduction algorithms.
In addition, ncMCE has a time complexity of only O(|V|2)—
which is lower than the complexity of the other considered ma-
chine learning techniques—and is a valid candidate for handling
very large networks. Finally, our experiments revealed that the
shortest path works signiﬁcantly better than the Euclidean dis-
tance for scoring proximity distances between network nodes
(proteins) embedded in the reduced space. We envision that net-
work-embedding techniques for predicting novel PPIs might play

an important role in the development of systems biology tools,
such as those used for network-based inference of disease-related
functional modules and pathways (Cannistraci et al., 2013b). The
real biological interactions could be complemented with the in-
silico predicted ones to boost the inference of the functional
modules. In the near future, this last point will become increas-
ingly important for patient classiﬁcation, diagnosis of disease
progression and planning of therapeutic approaches in persona-
lized medicine (Ammirati et al., 2012).

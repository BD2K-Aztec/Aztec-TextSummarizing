Abstract

Motivation: The field of toxicogenomics (the application of ’-omics’ technologies to risk assess-
ment of compound toxicities) has expanded in the last decade, partly driven by new legislation,
aimed at reducing animal testing in chemical risk assessment but mainly as a result of a paradigm
change in toxicology towards the use and integration of genome wide data. Many research groups
worldwide have generated large amounts of such toxicogenomics data. However, there is no cen-
tralized repository for archiving and making these data and associated tools for their analysis easily
available.

Results: The Data Infrastructure for Chemical Safety Assessment (diXa) is a robust and sustainable
infrastructure storing toxicogenomics data. A central data warehouse is connected to a portal with
links to chemical information and molecular and phenotype data. diXa is publicly available through
a user-friendly web interface. New data can be readily deposited into diXa using guidelines and
templates available online. Analysis descriptions and tools for interrogating the data are available
via the diXa portal.

1 Introduction

During the last decade, technology developments as well as new
legislation, ethical considerations and concerns about the reliabil-
ity and relevance of traditional animal experimentation for tox-
icity testing, have led to the expansion of the field of
toxicogenomics (Hartung, 2009; Sycheva, et al., 2013). Many pro-
jects worldwide have generated large amounts of toxicogenomics
data, but so far, there is no centralized repository collecting,
curating and maintaining all these data. To make sure data are
easily accessible and do not disappear over time, we developed
the Data Infrastructure for Chemical Safety Assessment (diXa), a
database and web interface providing access to toxicogenomics
datasets and analysis.

While several toxicogenomics projects made their data already
available via public databases (e.g. ArrayExpress, GEO, Expression
Atlas), data from other projects are more difficult to access.
Moreover, toxicogenomics data are generally deposited in isolation,
not as structured sets. There are several reasons for this, among
others: non comparable experimental designs, different technology
platforms and different data (pre)processing steps. Furthermore,
available metadata for public data sources are often insufficient for
data reuse. diXa aims to overcome these drawbacks by defining
standard workflows for data (pre)processing and standard formats
for metadata annotation. These standards are applied to the diXa
data through servicing. Moreover, diXa integrates information from
toxicology, chemistry and human disease databases alongside the
original data, helping interpretation of data analysis results and
increasing the relevance for evaluating toxicity.

Combining data sets from different sources centrally can provide
important information about experimental design and mechanistic
interpretations. When all relevant data for a study are available in a
public repository, a remaining challenge is to integrate these data in
order to get a better understanding of the entire biological system
(Gomez-Cabrero, et al., 2014; Schumacher, et al., 2014). Data from
different platforms and different technologies are very heteroge-
neous in terms of experimental conditions, species, noise levels, time
scales and linearity of response (Steinfath, et al., 2007). As a conse-
quence, integrating data from different sources requires new data
analysis methodologies (Gomez-Cabrero, et al., 2014).

Here we describe diXa, a database providing access to toxicoge-
nomics data from different sources and data analysis tools.

2 Data infrastructure and access

diXa consists of a central warehouse containing data from toxicoge-
nomics projects and other public repositories. The data warehouse is
linked to a chemical portal as well as to a human disease database.
An overview of diXa is presented in Figure 1.

2.1 Data sources

Currently, 34 studies involving 469 compounds are deposited in
diXa, originating from various toxicogenomics projects (see
Supplementary Table S1). The data have been generated through
in vitro and in vivo rat and human transcriptomics, metabolomics
and proteomics experiments. Additionally, diXa contains more
recently measured Copy Number Variation and epigenetics data.

Data in diXa are described in ISA-Tab format (Rocca-Serra,
et al., 2010; see Supplementary data, section ‘Uploading data’).

Understanding chemical, toxicity, and bioactivity properties of
compounds under investigation is crucial in studying adverse out-
comes (Stokstad, 2009). To provide direct access to curated public
chemical databases, diXa is connected to the bioactivity database
(ChEMBL; www.ebi.ac.uk/chembll) and the JRC ChemAgora portal
(chemagora.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). The ChemAgora portal provides
direct access for each compound in the diXa data warehouse to
chemical information available on third-party resources (see
Supplementary Table 52): the portal, through an on-the-ﬂy search,
informs whether a compound has data in each of the external
resources, and offers links leading to the exact third-party website
pages where information about the compound can be found. Some
third-party resources contain regulatory chemical information typic-
ally identified using the CAS Registry Number—this complements
the use in the diXa data warehouse, of the standard InChIKey as
core chemical structure identifier. Through ChemAgora a search is
performed also in such third-party repositories, after the mapping of
the InChiKey received from the diXa data warehouse into the cor-
responding CAS Registry Number.

2.2 Web interface

The diXa homepage (see Supplementary Fig. S1) provides
‘search’ and ‘browse’ sections allowing querying and browsing
by studies, samples, compounds, analyses or diseases (see
Supplementary Figs.S2—S11). The Experimental Factor Ontology
(Malone, et al., 2010) is used to ensure that the contents can be also
searched on synonyms and child terms. The ‘links’ section provides
relevant information about diXa, among others on submitting data,
training and novel analytical tools developed under diXa (Tools
Catalogue).

To link studies to relevant chemical information, the
ChemAgora portal provides options to perform searches for chem-
icals, based on InChIKeys (www.iupac.org), CAS Registry Numbers
(www.cas.org), trivial names (including partial names), and
structure.

2.3 Quality control, pre-processing and data analysis
Data deposited in diXa have been subject to quality control (QC),
pre-processing and initial analyses (log2 ratios, differentially
expressed genes) using pipelines implemented in Genedata
Expressionist® (Hoefkens, et al., 2014). Researchers submitting
data into diXa are requested to follow the guidelines mentioned
above. Furthermore, there will be control on data completeness and
standardization of meta-data through the use of ISA-Tab tools.

The algorithms used are described individually for each analysis
and are published on the diXa homepage under “Analysis”. An
overview of currently available analysis descriptions, together with
their location on the diXa website is presented in Supplementary
Table S4.

2.4 Applications

The accurate prediction of the toxicity of compounds remains a sig-
nificant challenge. Availability of a centralized data warehouse
allows combining data from different sources, including cross-omics
analyses. Within diXa, it has been shown that combining data from
in vitro studies on liver carcinogens with gene expression data from
human liver cancers improved prediction of carcinogenicity
(Caiment, et al., 2014). This also formed the basis of a promising
approach for biomarker discovery for liver toxicity (Hebels, et al.,
2014), where gene sets derived from different text mining and
human liver ‘omics’ databases, were compared to determine the
most promising gene lists for biomarker discovery. Furthermore,
both studies showed that compound classifications based on in vivo
data outperform classifications based on gene sets from the litera-
ture (‘expert knowledge’).

3 Current developments

diXa is a sustainable data-infrastructure. It will be updated for stor-
ing more data types and classes, including next generation sequenc-
ing and methylation data. Furthermore, new tools for integrated
statistical analysis will be developed and added to diXa. diXa has
already been adopted as the informatics framework for the EU FP7
HeCaTos project (http://www.hecatos.eu/).

The ChemAgora portal is also a long-term strategic develop-
ment, to which the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre is
fully committed. ChemAgora has already caught the attention of
other initiatives, e.g. IPCheM (http://ipchem.jrc.ec.europa.eu/), a
European Commission project, which will take advantage of the
search service provided by ChemAgora.

4 Conclusion

diXa is a stable and long-term data repository providing free public
access to toxicogenomics data. A web interface with several query
tools was implemented, allowing users to search and browse diXa.
We expect that the extensive use of structured metadata will have
large impact on implementation, in particular by allowing flexible
application in future use cases.

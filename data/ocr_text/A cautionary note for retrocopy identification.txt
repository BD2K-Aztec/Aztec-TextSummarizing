ABSTRACT

Motivation: Retrocopies are important genes in the genomes of
almost all higher eukaryotes. However, the annotation of such
genes is a non-trivial task. Intronless genes have often been
considered to be retroposed copies of intron-containing paralogs.
Such categorization relies on the implicit premise that alignable
regions of the duplicates should be long enough to cover exon—
exon junctions of the intron-containing genes, and thus intron loss
events can be inferred. Here, we examined the alternative possibility
that intronless genes could be generated by partial DNA-based
duplication of intron-containing genes in the fruitfly genome.
Results: By building painNise protein-, transcript- and genome-level
DNA alignments between intronless genes and their corresponding
intron-containing paralogs, we found that alignments do not cover
exon—exon junctions in 40% of cases and thus no intron loss could
be inferred. For these cases, the candidate parental proteins tend
to be partially duplicated, and intergenic sequences or neighboring
genes are included in the intronless paralog. Moreover, we observed
that it is significantly less likely for these paralogs to show
inter-chromosomal duplication and testis-dominant transcription,
compared to the remaining 60% of cases with evidence of clear
intron loss (retrogenes). These lines of analysis reveal that DNA-
based duplication contributes significantly to the 40% of cases of
single exon gene duplication. Finally, we performed an analogous
survey in the human genome and the result is similar, wherein 34%
of the cases do not cover exon—exon junctions. Thus, genome
annotation for retrogene identification should discard candidates
without clear evidence of intron loss.

1 INTRODUCTION

Mechanisms that generate new gene duplicates can be roughly
divided into two categories: DNA—based mechanisms and
retroposition (Zhang et al., 2010a,b; Zhou et al., 2008). Unlike
DNA—based duplicates, retrogenes have less evolutionary constraint,
given that they lose the cis—regulator elements of their parental
loci, and thus might more often undergo neofunctionalization
(Brosius, 2003). The empirical data conﬁrming this hypothesis
are that retrogenes are more often fast evolving relative to DNA—
based duplicates (Cusack and Wolfe, 2007). Thus, because DNA—
and RNA—based duplications likely have different functional and
evolutionary consequences, it is necessary to disentangle the
origination mechanisms of duplicated genes.

Since retroposition uses mature mRNA as the template instead
of intron—containing pre—mRNA, the signature of intron loss has
been proposed as a hallmark to differentiate these two duplication
mechanisms for a derived duplicate with an intron—containing
parental gene (Brosius, 2003). It is standard annotation practice to
perform an all—against—all protein alignment to search paralogous
gene pairs. If one copy has at least one intron while the other
copy is intronless, the latter is deﬁned as a retrogene, with the
assumption that the alignment should be long enough to cover exon—
exon junctions, thus allowing intron loss to be inferred. A more
conservative method is to check the actual alignments and discard
cases where the alignment is too short and no parental introns are
covered (Betran et al., 2002; Emerson et al., 2004). It is difﬁcult
to compare the performance of these two strategies since it remains
unknown how many alignments between single—exon new genes
and intron—containing parents do not cover introns and whether
DNA—based duplication contributes to many of these cases.

Here, we performed a computational survey of intronless genes
with intron—containing paralogs in the genomes of both fruitﬂy and
human. The purpose of our work is 2—fold. First, we attempted
to provide an evaluation of how we classify retrogene and DNA—
based duplicates. The directionality of intron loss can be used
to deﬁne parental/daughter gene relationships in the case of the
retroposition—based copying mechanism. If there is actually no
evidence for intron loss, it is difﬁcult to deﬁne which paralog is
the derived copy and which is the ancestral copy. Such information
is critical for the study of evolutionary novelty contributed by

new genes. Second, since DNA—based duplicates and retrogenes are
subject to different evolutionary trajectories (Brosius, 2003; Cusack
and Wolfe, 2007), we wanted to address whether partial DNA—
level duplication of intron—containing genes makes a signiﬁcant
contribution to the presence of intronless genes.

By building protein—, transcript— and genome—level alignments,
and performing transcriptional analysis, we found that intron loss
was less likely for 40% (47) of cases in fruitﬂy and 34% (97) of cases
in human. In these cases, the alignable regions do not cover exon—
exon junctions and are clearly the consequence of partial duplicates
relative to the parental genes. In 38% (18 out of 47) cases in
Drosophila, the duplication blocks cover introns, intergenic regions
and neighboring genes that are not compatible with retroposition.
Duplication direction and transcriptional proﬁling further support
the notion that these 47 cases have different biological features in
comparison with the remaining cases whose alignments span at least
one exon—exon junction. This set of analyses supports a conservative
method of retrogene identiﬁcation and suggests that DNA—based
duplication of intron—containing genes contributes to the formation
of many new intronless genes.

2 METHODS

We started with the parental and daughter gene pairs generated in our previous
duplicate databases extracted from the D.me161n0gaster and human genomes
(Zhang et 611., 2010a,b). We excluded cases of genes encoding an intronless
isoform and an intron—containing isoform to prevent ambiguity. We built
protein and transcript alignments with BLAST (Altschul et 611., 1997) and
parsed the result with the chained SearchIO module provided by BioPerl
(Stajich et 611., 2002). In order to avoid arbitrary parameters, we called an
intron loss event only if the corresponding exon—exon junction was covered
by the alignable region. It is possible that some duplicates were falsely
categorized as retrogenes if the exon—exon junctions were near the end of
alignments, where the alignment tends to be less reliable. Thus, if this were
the case, the retrogene dataset may contain some copies that are in fact DNA—
level duplicates. There are, however, not many such dubious cases. In human,
150 (80%) out of 188 cases of duplications with intron loss involve at least
two intron losses. In fruitﬂy, this proportion drops to 63% (43 out of 68). We
further manually checked the remaining 25 cases in Drosophila involving
one intron loss and found only three cases where the junction is near to
the alignment border (less than 10 amino acids away from one alignment
end). Thus, there are not many duplicates misidentiﬁed as retrogenes due to
dubious intron loss. Actually, even if there were some such cases, it would
only mean that our main conclusion that 30—40% single—exon genes lacking
evidence of intron loss is actually conservative.

We generated the self netted and chained genome alignment for fruitﬂy by
following UCSC’s pipeline (Kent et 611., 2003; Kuhn et 611., 2007; Schwartz
et 611., 2003), where the best alignable paralogous genomic region for each
genomic locus was identiﬁed with a scoring matrix allowing longer gaps.

Following a similar procedure in (Zhang et 611., 2010a), we processed
FlyAtlas microarray data (Chintapalli et 611., 2007) using the Bioconductor
platform (Gentleman et 611., 2004). In brief, we used the customized array
annotation ﬁle to ﬁlter probes mapping to both parental and daughter genes
(Dai etal., 2005), the GCRMA package to generate gene level summary and
gplots package to generate heatmaps.

We built codon—based alignments between parental genes and daughter
copies by aligning the protein ﬁrst by BLAST followed by conceptual
translation (Suyama 61611., 2006). We used CODEML in the PAML package
(Yang, 2007) to infer the pair—wise Ka/Ks, the ratio between non—synonymous
substitution rate and synonymous substitution rate. We further performed a
likelihood ratio test to investigate whether K61/Ks is signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
smaller than 0.5.

We followed the previous pipeline in (Zhang et 611., 2007) and mapped
UniGene (Wheeler etal., 2008) ESTs sequences unambiguously to genes.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Expectations of the RNA- and DNA-based
duplications

We investigated the origination mechanism of single exon duplicate
genes by examining their different expected gene structures,
chromosomal distributions and tissue—biased expression patterns.

For gene structures, a RNA—based duplications will more likely
create more complete coding structures since mature transcripts are
generally duplicated (Brosius, 2003; Kaessmann 61 611., 2009). In
contrast, DNA—based duplication can copy only a part of a parental
gene region, and thus does not necessarily duplicate complete coding
structures (Emerson 61 611 ., 2008). In addition, longer fragment DNA—
based duplication may involve parts of more than one gene (Fan
at 611., 2008).

Regarding chromosomal distribution, DNA—based duplication
more often leads to duplicates within the same chromosomes, with a
lower frequency of inter—chromosomal events (Zhang 61611., 2010a).

It has also been observed that RNA—based duplicates are
more often associated with testis—dominant expression, possibly
because retrogenes lose their original promoters and the testis is
transcriptionally permissive (Kaessmann, 2010). Since DNA—based
duplicates can carry the original promoter, they should be less
frequently dominantly transcribed in testis.

We examined these expectations by analyzing the actual single
exon young gene databases in fruitﬂy and human we previously
built (Zhang 61 611., 2010a,b).

3.2 DNA-based duplication contributes to single exon
genes in fruitﬂy

We have previously identiﬁed 115 single exon genes in fruitﬂy
whose parental duplicates contain at least one intron (Zhang 61 611.,
2010a). Out of these 115 intronless genes, we identiﬁed explicitly
at least 1 intron loss event in 67 cases based on the protein—
level alignment (e.g. Fig. 1A). In addition, the alignment between
transcripts showed that CG12324 was derived from CG2033
where two intron losses occurred in the 5’ —UTR region (Fig. 1B).
These 68 cases together represent typical retroposition events,
which will be hereafter referred as duplication with intron loss
(DIL) (Supplementary Material Table 81). For the remaining 47
cases (Supplementary Material Table S2; Fig. 1C and 1D), no
molecular signatures of intron loss could be detected either by
protein—, transcript— or genome—level alignments, since no exon—
exon junctions were covered in the alignments. These cases will
be hereafter referred as duplication without intron loss (DWIL).
Further comparative analyses revealed multiple lines of evidence
showing that DNA—based duplication obviously contributes to the
formation of the 47 single exon genes or genes that have no
intron loss signatures. First, the derived copies are frequently partial
duplicates of the parental proteins. As shown in Figure 2, the
sequence coverage of the parental gene in more than 50% of the
protein alignments is lower than 52%, a percentage much lower than
the median coverage of the 68 cases of DIL (85%, Wilcoxon rank
test P=0.01). One example is shown in Fig. 1C where CG33797 is

CG3422. Clearly, there are two intron loss events in the protein—coding region
of CG17268. (B) Transcript alignment between CG2033 and CG12324.

mainly derived from the ﬁrst coding exon of CG7735 (30% of the
parental protein).

As the second line of evidence, the duplication blocks tend
to cover non—mRNA sequences including introns or intergenic
sequences. For 18 (38%) cases, the duplication blocks cover 5’ or
3’ ﬂanking regions by at least 50 bp. For example, in the case of
CG33797 (Fig. 1C), the alignment appears to cover some portion of
the ﬁrst intron together with the 5’ ﬂanking region of the parental
gene. The dot plot in Supplementary Figure 81 clearly shows that
the duplication blocks extend to 5’ and 3’ non—mRNA regions.

Third, in the extreme case, the duplication block can involve
neighboring genes. As shown in Figure 1D, CG18563 appears
to be derived from an intron—containing parental gene CG3117.
Interestingly, the neighbor of CG18563, CG6639, shares similarity
with a gene adjacent to CG3117, namely CG18557. Since it is less
likely that two independent duplication events are involved in one
single pair of genomic loci, such an alignment suggests that one
larger DNA—based duplication covers both genes. In other words,
it is possible that a DNA—level duplication covering both CG18557

and CG3117 lead to two new genes, CG6639 and CG18563. Later
on, rapid divergence or extensive recombination may have occurred
in the middle part of the duplication block rendering this region
unalignable.

Although all these features are compatible with DNA—based
duplication, retroposition may also create such duplicates, although
with a lower probability. Speciﬁcally, partial duplication might
be caused by incomplete retrotransposition, while duplication
blocks covering introns or ﬂanking regions might be explained by
ancestral alternative isoforms. Moreover, duplication involving two
neighboring genes may occur via retroposition of a readthrough
transcript (Zhang 61 611., 2009).

However, it is possible to investigate other genomic features of
DWIL cases in comparison to DIL (standard retrogene cases). In
other words, genomic characteristics known to be distinct between
RNA— and DNA—based duplications can be used to evaluate their
contributions to the formation of duplications without intron loss.
First, as mentioned above, it is predicted that parental and daughter
genes without intron loss are more likely to be located in the
same chromosome if they are generated by DNA—based duplication
(Zhang 61611., 2010a). Consistently, as shown in Table 1, duplications
where parental and daughter genes with intron loss are encoded in
the same chromosomes constitute 38% of all such cases (26 out of
68). In DWIL cases, however, this proportion increases to 53% (25
out of 47, marginal signiﬁcance by One—sided Fisher’s Exact Test
FET, P=0.08).

Second, also as previously mentioned, if many of these 47
cases were generated via a DNA—based mechanism, we expect that

these genes would have lower testis transcription. As expected, for
intronless daughter genes derived from intron—containing parental
genes, 41 out of 66 (62%) show testis—dominant expression
(Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast, in DWIL cases, this proportion
drops to 40% (17 out of 42, one—sided FET P=0.02).

Notably, such a pattern could not be interpreted by confounding
factors. First, it is known that younger genes are predominantly
expressed in testis (Zhang 61 611., 2010a). Based on the age
information in (Zhang 61611., 2010a), daughter genes without intron
loss are actually slightly younger although not signiﬁcantly different
from daughter genes with intron loss. Second, out—of—X duplicates,
i.e. autosomal duplicates with X—linked parental genes, tend to be
expressed in testis (Betran 61611., 2002; Vibranovski 61611., 2009). The
two datasets (DIL and DWIL) show a similar proportion (~26%)
of out—of—X duplicates, which therefore also cannot explain their
different trends regarding testis expression.

3.3 DNA-based duplication contributes to single exon
genes in human

Consistently, in the 285 human intronless genes, which we
previously identiﬁed as derived from intron—containing parental
genes, we found 97 cases that had no intron loss signature
(Supplementary Material Tables S3, S4). We further observed that
these 97 cases have much lower parental gene coverage relative to
the remaining cases (median 56% versus 98%, Wilcoxon rank test
P = 5 X 10‘”). Moreover, these cases also show signiﬁcantly higher
within—chromosomal duplications (34% versus 9%, Table 2).

3.4 Single exon DWIL cases appear to be functional

By deﬁnition, DWIL cases only duplicate one exon of the parental
gene. Since the median peptide length encoded by one exon is
only 72 for fruitﬂy and 41 for human (Supplementary Material
Fig. S3A), it is possible that DWIL proteins are too short and thus
non—functional.

In order to test this hypothesis, we ﬁrst investigated the length
distribution of duplicated regions. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. S3B, the duplicated regions of parental proteins in DWIL cases
are much longer than the background exon length distribution (163
amino acids for fruitﬂy and 143 for human). In other words, larger
coding exons are preferentially copied.

Second, if DWIL genes are pseudogenic, they should be
free of constraint. Thus, Ka/Ks between DWIL gene and their
corresponding parental genes should be above 0.5 (Betran 61 611.,
2002; Emerson 61611., 2004). However, as shown in Supplementary
Figure S4, pairwise Ka/Ks is small with a median of 0.06 in fruitﬂy
and 0.12 in human, respectively. Likelihood—ratio tests show that
Ka/Ks is signiﬁcantly smaller than 0.5 in more than half of the
cases (74% in fruitﬂy and 55% in human) suggesting protein—level
constraint.

Finally, Supplementary Figure S2B shows that DWIL cases tend
to be transcribed in at least one tissue in fruitﬂy. Consistently,
UniGene EST data indicate that 59 out of 97 (61%) human DWIL
cases are transcribed.

Thus, all these lines of evidence support the functionality of DWIL
proteins.

4 DISCUSSION

We highlight the ambiguity of single exon genes with regard to
differentiating DNA— and RNA—mediated duplications. Our results
show that one conventional pipeline for identifying retrogenes as
intronless genes with intron—containing paralogs ought to be revised.
The existence of intron—containing paralogs does not directly ensure
that intron loss has occurred. In order to study the origination
mechanism of such duplicates, it is necessary to check whether
or not the particular alignment spans exon—exon junctions. For the
cases without intron loss, although we cannot give a quantitative
estimate of the number of DNA—mediated duplicates, our analysis
suggest that a signiﬁcant number of previously identiﬁed candidate
retrogenes have been miscategorized. Furthermore, we might expect
that DNA—mediated duplication plays a large role in generating
intronless duplicates given that it occurs at a much higher rate
relative to retroposition (Zhang 61611., 2010a,b; Zhou 61611., 2008).

Our comprehensive survey also validates the efﬁciency of protein—
alignment based pipeline searching for retrogenes (B ai 61611., 2007;
Emerson 61 611., 2004). Such a strategy captured the majority of
duplications with intron losses since transcript—based alignment only
added one out of the 68 cases in fruitﬂy and 7 out of 188 cases in
humans.

Third, our result indicates the difﬁculty in differentiating
processed pseudogenes and duplicated pseudogenes. Given the lack
of evolutionary constraint, it is even more challenging to identify
intron loss events in the case of pseudogenes. Therefore, it would
be even more arbitrary to classify these two kinds of pseudogenes.

Fourth, it is interesting to ask how a new open reading frame
emerges given that DWIL cases are often partial duplications of
parental proteins. In the case of CG33797 (Fig. 1C), the original
stop codon of the parental protein is absent. The genomic alignment
across multiple Drosophila genomes (Supplementary Fig. S5A)
suggests that a new stop codon (TAA) emerged by de novo
mutations. Similarly, CG18563 recruited a new start codon ATG by
de novo mutations (Supplementary Fig. S5B). These cases suggest
that DWIL cases can explore novel protein sequence space.

Finally, it should be pointed out that retrogenes do not necessarily
lack introns. By recruiting ﬂanking sequences, they can generate
new introns usually in untranslated regions (Brosius, 1999a;
Wang 61 611., 2004). Fortunately, this feature does not affect the
efﬁcacy of the protein search—based retrogene identiﬁcation strategy.
Moreover, initial retro genes can be subsequently ampliﬁed by DNA—
level duplication (Brosius, 1999a; Wang 61 611., 2004) and the
ancestor of the present DNA—based genomes is RNA (Brosius,
1999b). From this standpoint, it is difﬁcult to generate a clear—
cut differentiation between DNA—level duplication and retroposition
across all evolutionary time scales. However, our work provides
for the ﬁrst time a rough estimate of the number of single—exon
genes with a multiple—exon paralogs that were generated by the
DNA—based mechanism in recent evolutionary history.

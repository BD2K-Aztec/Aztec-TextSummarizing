ABSTRACT

Motivation: Rich collections of biodiversity information such as spatial
distributions, species descriptions and trait data are now synthesized
in publicly available online sources such as GBIF. Also phylogenetic
knowledge now provides a sound understanding of the origin of or-
ganisms and their place in the tree of life. We demonstrate with
PhyloJIVE that any phylogenetic tree can be linked to online biodiver-
sity data in the browser. This evolutionary view of biodiversity data is
demonstrated in a case study that suggests that this approach may be
useful to scientists and non-experts users.

1 INTRODUCTION

The growing catalogue of online biodiversity data sources has
reached a scale where integration with phylogenies can inform
comparative biology research in morphology, ecology, biogeog-
raphy, disease resistance, ecosystem services, food security and
climate change (Chapman, 2005; Cracraft, 2002; Miller and
J olley-Rogers, 2014). There are now mature services (e.g.
GBIF, EOL and the ALA) that provide biodiversity data, includ-
ing species proﬁles, morphological, distribution, images and
taxonomic data, to researchers and the general public
(Hardisty and Roberts, 2013). These data sources provide data
in taxon proﬁles but not through phylogenies.

The research community has generated DNA-based phylogen-
etic trees (Pace et al., 2012), and many are stored in repositories
such as TreeBase II (http://www.treebase.org/). Many data ana-
lysis and visualization suites are now available, which produce
and display phylogenies (Pavlopoulos et al., 2010) but none in-
tegrate data, such as morphological character states derived from
web services, on a phylogeny. Here we demonstrate PhyloJIVE
(Phylogeny Javascript Information Visualiser and Explorer), a
web-based application that integrates biodiversity information
aggregated from many sources with phylogenetic trees.
PhyloJ IVE complements other initiatives that provide visualiza-
tions such as Phylowidget, OneZoom (http://www.onezoom.org)
and jspyhylosvg (Jordan and Piel, 2008; Page, 2011; Pavlopoulos
et al., 2010; Smits and Ouverney, 2010). We do not seek to

replicate what they do well; rather, we provide a convenient
means to assemble online data in a phylogenetic context.

2 METHODS

PhyloJ IVE is an open source web application consisting of code and tem-
plates designed so that any website can provide a phylogenetic view of
biodiversity data. Source code is available via github (http://trin.github.
io/phyloJIVE/), and the ALA (http://phylojive.ala.org.au) hosts an example
implementation. Designed to be ﬂexible, it operates as a client-side web
application that renders phylogenies on a HTMLS canvas. Matters such as
user authentication and access control are left to the host website. Written
in J avaScript, it requires no plug-ins. Performance is determined by the
viewer’s computer. PhyloJ IVE has three components: PhylogenyExplorer,
PhyloJIVE-templates and charJSON. Phylogeny Explorer is an extension
to the HT (J avascript Infovis Toolkit library) that adds a novel, compact
tree visualization with variable length branches. Actions and online data
sources can be linked to every node.

PhyloJ IVE templates demonstrate the use of the visualization and pro-
vide standardized tests to verify algorithms and code. It demonstrates
how to navigate the tree and component Glades; to adjust the visualization
and other parameters; to select taxon character states; to upload of trees
in newick form and character sets in CSV or charJ SON form; to fetch
character sets from Identify Life; and to display the results of web service
queries (e.g. species pages, maps, images) on the tree. Sets of up to 10
quantitative or qualitative characters can be mapped onto the tree.
Character states are reconstructed using simple algorithms (see
Supplemental information), a summary of which appears in the applica-
tion when the mouse pointer hovers over a node.

charJ SON is a data structure designed for biodiversity web services that
delivers qualitative and quantitative traits/characters. It can be parsed by
most programming languages. Supplementary Table S1 shows a formal
description of charJ SON in Extended Backus-Naur Form.

3 CASE STU DY

An implementation of PhyloJ IVE (http://phylojive.ala.org.
au/treeViewer/show/Case—l—Study—l—l% 3A—l—Acacia) was developed
on the Atlas of Living Australia. It was used to integrate spatial
data points from the ALA with user-uploaded data: an Acacia
phylogeny (Miller et al., 2011) and traits in a.csv ﬁle. Uniquely for
Acacia, PhyloJIVE also integrated data from the IdentifyLife
(http://www2.identifylife.org) web services plant identification
key, Wattle (Maslin, 2001), which contains a morphological char-
acter matrix of Acacia species. After uploading the data, we se-
lected 10 characters and mapped character states onto the tree,
while also automatically reconstructing ancestral states for each
node. Branches were coloured by the character states of the ﬁrst
character selected (Fig. 1A).

Users are able to interact with the tree and the biodiversity
data through the web application. They can view multiple phylo-
genetic depths and collapse their view of select clades (Fig. 1A).
They can view allied data for terminals or nodes by left-clicking
in the application (Fig. lD-I). Assembled web services links
included nomenclature, species pages and maps from the ALA.
Users can view distribution maps for a single terminal or clades
of up to 32 taxa, with each terminal coloured differently
(Fig. 1C). Maps can also show the distribution of any available
character for a clade (Supplementary Fig. S1 C—F). Details of
reconstructed states for all selected characters appear as pointer
hovers over nodes and terminals (Fig. 1E). A matrix alongside
the tree summarized character states with symbols for qualitative
and a heat map for quantitative characters (Fig. 1A). Users are
able to select a clade and export the localities to the geospatial
portal of the ALA (see Supplementary Fig. S1) to investigate
spatial correlations with environmental layers.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The ALA implementation is set to access primarily Australian
data sources. The means to discover and use web services is
evolving and applied inconsistently in the community of bio-
diversity data providers (Pedrinaci and Domingue, 2010; Parr
et al., 2011). Other data sources can be added as required;
however, further development is required for data sources to
be added easily in the form of user-friendly pull-down menus.

The simple visualization of multiple character states on a tree is
novel to PhyloJ IVE, and users can identify interesting trends that
can form hypotheses that require further investigation. Because
PhyloJ IVE is a web-based tool, it is easily shared among workers.
A worker who wants to share an interesting discovery can send the
URL to a colleague who can open PhyloJ IVE, reload the datasets
and call up the URL. Likewise, a user can bookmark a particular
character setup for later investigation.

PhyloJIVE demonstrates that it is possible and useful to as-
semble interactive biodiversity data from diverse sources. Viewed
through phylogeny, the evolutionary context of morphological,

spatial and ecological data becomes clear and accessible to non-
specialists.

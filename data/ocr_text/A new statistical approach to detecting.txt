ABSTRACT

Motivation: As an epigenetic alteration, DNA methylation plays an
important role in epigenetic controls of gene transcription. Recent
advances in genome-wide scan of DNA methylation provide great
opportunities in studying the impact of DNA methylation on many
human diseases including various types of cancer. Due to the unique
feature of this type of data, applicable statistical methods are limited
and new sophisticated approaches are desirable.

Results: In this article, we propose a new statistical test to
detect differentially methylated loci for case control methylation data
generated by Illumina arrays. This new method utilizes the important
finding that DNA methylation is highly correlated with age. The
proposed method estimates the overall P-value by combining the
P-values from independent individual tests each for one age group.
Through real data application and simulation study, we show that
the proposed test is robust and usually more powerful than other
methods.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA methylation, as an alteration of epigenetic control, plays a
critical role in transcriptional regulation, chromosomal stability,
genomic imprinting and X—inactivation (Kuan et al., 2010; Rakyan
et al., 2008). It has been shown to be linked to many human diseases,
including various types of cancer (Baylin and Ohm, 2006; Feinberg
and Tycko, 2004; Jabbari and Bemardi, 2004; Jones and Baylin,
2002; Kulis and Esteller, 2010; Laird, 2010; Wang, 2011; Xu et al.,
1999).

With the BeadArray technology, Illumina GoldenGate and
Inﬁnium Methylation Assays can generate genome—wide high—
throughput methylation data which are widely used in research.
After background correction and normalization for the raw
ﬂuorescent intensities, for each locus, a summarized value (called
,B—value) is generated based on ~30 replicates in the same array:
maX(M,0)/(maX(M,0)—I—max(U,0)—I—100) , where M is the average
signal from a methylated allele and U is from unmethylated allele.
The range of the ,B—value is therefore, between 0 and 1, with 0
representing totally unmethylated and 1 representing completely
methylated.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

To detect differentially methylated loci between two groups of
case and control, the commonly used statistical tests, such as t—test
and linear regression—based methods may not be appropriate as
the assumptions of those methods may not meet for this kind of
data. For example, in a linear regression model, we usually assume
the error terms are normally distributed with common variance.
However, it has been shown that the ,B—value is highly associated
with age; its mean and SD vary across subject’s age (Christensen
et al., 2009; Teschendorff et al., 2010). Simply treating age as a
covariate in the linear regression model does not guarantee that the
model assumptions are met.

Recently, Wang has proposed a model—based likelihood ratio test
to detect differentially methylated loci for case and control data
under the assumption that the ,B—value follows a three—component
normal—uniform distribution (Wang, 2011). Through simulation,
Wang showed that under some situations, their proposed test
outperforms the simple t—test. However, the commonly used t—test
cannot be the best test if data are from mixture distributions.

In this article, we propose a new statistical testing approach
to detect differentially methylated loci for case control Illumina
array methylation data. In the proposed test, we incorporate the
important recent ﬁnding that the ,B—value is correlated with age.
More speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst group subjects into several age groups
based on their age; then for each age group, a statistical test such
as t—test will be conducted for the given locus and the two P—values
each from one—sided test (one from left—side and the other from
right—side) are recorded. An overall P—value for that locus will be
estimated through combining the two sets of P—values. Using a real
methylation data with two treatments and a simulation study, we
show that the proposed test is robust and usually more powerful
than other methods. In this article, all the t—tests used are based on
the unequal variance assumption.

2 METHODS

Suppose we have k age groups; for each age group, a statistical test, such
as t—test, will be used to detect the mean differences between the case and
control groups. We have k P—values from the left—sided test, denoted by
Pli(i= 1, 2, ..., k), and k P—values from the right—sided test, Pr,- = 1 —Pl,-(i=
1,2, ..., k). Under the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the
two treatment groups, all of the above P—values from the same one—sided tests
are independent and identical uniform [0, 1] random variables. Therefore,
according to Fisher (Fisher, 1932), we have the following results:

k

where xgk is a chi—square random variable with df 2k; and

k
T2=—2zlog(pﬁ)~x%k (2)
i=1
We deﬁne the following statistic:
T=max{T1,T2} (3)

Since statistics T1 and T 2 are not independent, the null distribution of T is
not easy to ﬁnd. However, we can estimate the P—value of T based on the
following theorem (Chen, 2011; Chen and Ng, 2012; Owen, 2009):

THEOREM 1. Under the null hypothesis of no difference between the case
and control groups, the P—value of statistic T satisﬁes:

205 —a2 5 Pr(T >x) g 205, where a: 1 —FX%k (x),
and F ngis the cumulative distribution function of 5,. (4)

Therefore, we can approximate the P—value of T by its upper bound 2oz:
Pr(T>x)%2or (5)

For small at, the approximation is very accurate.

Theorem 1 can be proved by using the concept of associated random
variables due to Esary, Proschan and Walkup (Esary et al., 1967). More
details can be found in (Owen, 2009).

We call the above proposed method ‘combined test based on one—sided
t—test’. Similarly, we can use Fisher’s method to combine independent P—
value from two—sided t—tests, each for one age group; we call this test
‘combined test based on two—sided t—test’.

A regression model with age as covariate is also conducted to compare the
treatment effect (case versus control); the P—value is obtained after adjusting
for the age effect. We also calculate the P—value from the single t—test, which
ignores the age information and uses pooled data.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Simulation study

In the simulation study, we assume there are six age groups; two
treatment groups each with sample size 30 are simulated from
normal distributions with standard deviations equal to 1. We assume
the effect sizes can take four different values: —0.5, —0.1, 0.1 and
0.5. Table 1 gives the settings for each scenario of the simulation
study. The degree of heterogeneity of the effect sizes decreases from
scenario 1 to scenario 7, where all the effects have the same size.
Scenario 8 is for the null hypothesis, where the effect sizes for all
age groups are zeros. Table 1 also reports the estimated power for
the single t—test, regression model adjusting for age effect and the
combined tests based on one— and two—sided t—tests at signiﬁcance
level 0.05 using 104 replicates. The type I error rates (scenario 8)
from all the methods are close to the preset signiﬁcance level of 0.05.

From the simulation study, we have the following observations.
First, the performances of the single t—test and the regression model
adjusting for age effect are very similar; the proposed method
(combl) and the method based on one—sided t—test and permutation
test (perm) have very similar powers. Second, when the effects have
different directions and both have large sizes (e.g. scenarios 1—3),
the two combined tests have comparable power and both are more
powerful than the single t—test. Third, when the effects have different
directions but one direction has relatively small sizes (e. g. scenario
4), the proposed method based on one—sided t—test is more powerful
than that based on two—sided t—test and the single t—test. Fourth,

when the effects have the same directions but different sizes (e. g.

Fifth, when all the effects have the same sizes (e. g. scenario 7), the
proposed test and the single t—test have comparable power; both are
more powerful than the combined test based on two—sided t—test.

3.2 A real data set

The United Kingdom Ovarian Cancer Population Study (UKOPS)
(Teschendorff et al., 2010) with 274 controls and 131 pre—
treatment cases will be used to compare the performance of
the proposed test with the single t—test. All of the controls
and the cases are women. Those methylation data with 27
578 loci were generated by the Illumina Inﬁnium Huamn
Methylaytion27 BeadChip and downloaded from the NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under
accession number GSE19711.

For the data quality control, we remove 29 patient samples
(15 controls and 14 treatment cases) with low bisulphite (BS)
conversion efﬁciency (BS control intensity value <4000) or with
coverage rate <95% (Teschendorff et al., 2010). For each locus, we
perform a single t—test comparing the mean difference between the
two treatment groups: control and pre—treatment. We also separate
subjects into six age groups (50—55, 55—60, 60—65, 65—70, 70—75
and 75 and over), which was given by the original data, and calculate
the overall P—value of the proposed test using (5). Table 2 gives the
number of subjects in each treatment group by age group.

single t—test. Figure 1a plots the —log10 P—values from the combined
test based on one— and two—sided t—tests. It can be seen that for
most loci with small P—values, the combined test based on one—
sided t—test has smaller P—value, indicating it is more powerful than
the combined test based on two—sided t—test. Figure 1b compares
the P—values from the proposed test and those from regression
model after adjusting for age. When a locus has small P—value from
the regression model, it usually also has small P—value from the
proposed method. However, there are many loci with small P—values
from the proposed method while their P—values from the regression
model are very large. For those loci, the proposed method is more
powerful. Figure 1c compares the P—values from the proposed
method with those from the single t—test. In the regression model, the
single t—test is less powerful for many loci when compared with the
proposed test. Figure 1d plots the P—values from the single t—test and
the regression model. It shows that the regression—based method and
the single t—test have very similar P—values. We therefore compare
the proposed test mainly with the single t—test.

Indeed, the proposed method detects much more differentially
methylated loci than the single t—test. Table 3 lists the number of loci
detected by either and both of the two tests at different signiﬁcance
levels; 10‘3, 10‘4, 10‘5 and 10‘6. Clearly, most loci detected by
single t—test are also detected by the proposed method. However,
there are a lot of loci detected by the proposed method but not by
the single t—test for given cutoff P—values.

Table 4 lists the estimated mean, standard deviation, effect size for
each age group and those of pooled data for the ﬁve loci with P >0.01
from the single t—test and <10_8 from the proposed test. The effect
size is deﬁned as (m1 —m2)/s, where m1 is the mean of control,

It shows that the effect sizes vary across age groups. Furthermore,
the effects may even have different directions among the six age
groups. Interestingly, the estimated effects from the age group of ‘75
and over’ for the ﬁve loci are all negative (control—pre—treatment) and
their sizes are relatively small compared with other age groups. In
addition, except for the age group of ‘75 and over’, all effects of the
same locus from the other ﬁve age groups have the same direction.
The single t—test fails to detect those loci with small overall effect
sizes from the pooled data; however, the combined test can detect
the mean differences by comparing the two treatments within each
age group, where data are more homogeneous.

Figure 2 plots the distribution of the ,8—value of locus cg04956511,
one of the ﬁve loci listed in Table 4, for both treatment groups by
age group.

To investigate how well the proposed method controls type I error
rate, for each age group, we randomly assign half of the controls into
one group and the remaining controls into another group; then we
apply the single t—test and the proposed method to the data of the two
randomly assigned control groups. Since both groups contain only
controls, the null hypothesis is true and not many small P—values
should be expected from appropriate statistical tests. Figure 3 plots

the negative log10 P—values from both the single t—test and the
proposed method for each locus. As expected, only a few loci have
P <103 from either tests. This result indicates both the single t—test
and the proposed method can control type I error rate well at small
signiﬁcance levels.

4 DISCUSSION

The assumption that the ,8—value is normally distributed with
constant variance across age may not be always appropriate; if this
assumption is violated, the commonly used t—test and the regression
method will lose power and alternative methods are desirable. It has
been shown that the ,8—value is an age related measurement, both
its mean and standard deviation may vary across age; we would
expect that it is more homogeneous for subjects with similar age.
Based on this idea, we propose a new statistical approach which
separates subjects based on their age, conducts one—sided statistical

test for each individual age group, and then combines P—values
to obtain an overall P—value. The proposed method uses the one—
sided, instead of two—sided tests for each age group because most
of the time, the direction of the effects are expected to be the same
(negative or positive). If the direction of the effects is the same
and known for all age groups, we can even improve the power by
only using test T1 or T2. However, in practice, the directions may
be unknown even if they are the same; the proposed method is
still powerful for this situation. From the results of our simulation
study and the real data application, we can see that the proposed
test is robust in the sense that it has reasonable power when the
effects have different directions. In contrast, the single t—test will
lose power dramatically when it is applied to the pooled data
where the effects have different sizes and/or their directions are
different.

The proposed method is based on the effect modiﬁer: age,
which is by far the strongest demographic risk factor for cancer
(Teschendorff et al., 2010). However, there is no difﬁculty to extend
the proposed method to other factors which are associated with
methylation.

In this article, we use the commonly used t—test to compare the
case and control groups for each age group; however, it can be
replaced by any other appropriate test. Except for the Fisher’s test,
there are many different ways to combine P—values from independent
tests (Chen, 2011; Chen and Nadarajah, 2011; Cousins, 2008;
Whitlock, 2005); however, there is no uniformly most powerful
approach. It remains an open topic to ﬁnd the most appropriate
approach for this kind of data. We recommend using Fisher’s test
since it is robust and is very powerful under many situations.

In summary, we have proposed a new approach to detect
differentially methylated loci for case control Illumina array
methylation data. Through simulation study and a real data
application, we have shown that the proposed method is more
powerful than the commonly used t—test and regression—based
method.

Abstract

Summary: Many cell lines can be reprogrammed to other cell lines by forced expression of a few
transcription factors or by specifically designed culture methods, which have attracted a great
interest in the field of regenerative medicine and stem cell research. Plenty of cell lines have been
used to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) by expressing a group of genes and
microRNAs. These IPSCs can differentiate into somatic cells to promote tissue regeneration.
Similarly, many somatic cells can be directly reprogrammed to other cells without a stem cell state.
All these findings are helpful in searching for new reprogramming methods and understanding the
biological mechanism inside. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no database
dedicated to integrating the reprogramming records. We built Rde (cellular reprogramming data-
base) to collect cellular reprogramming information and make it easy to access. All entries in Rde
are manually extracted from more than 2000 published articles, which is helpful for researchers in
regenerative medicine and cell biology.

Availability and Implementation: Rde is freely available on the web at http://bioinformatics.ustc.

1 Introduction

Cellular reprogramming is a process in which one cell type trans-
forms into another cell type by expressing a group of genes and
microRNAs, adding chemical molecules or changing cell culture en-
vironment (Hussein and Nagy, 2012). Cellular reprogramming tech-
nology, which mainly includes induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC)
generation, IPSC differentiation and direct reprogramming, is con-
sidered one of the most important advances in tissue replacement
therapies (Tabar and Studer, 2014; Walmsley et al., 2014). Somatic
cells can be reprogramed to a stem cell-like state, which can differen-
tiate to functional somatic cells. Multiple somatic cells, including
blood cells (Giorgetti et al., 2009), fibroblasts (Takahashi et al.,
2007) and hair follicle dermal papilla cells (Tsai et al., 2011) have

been successfully reprogrammed to IPSCs. There are also many
functional somatic cells that have been generated from IPSCs, such
as dopaminergic neurons (Theka et al., 2013) and retinal cells
(Mellough et al., 2012). Multiple strategies have been used to
achieve these goals, including chemical-inducible systems (Nie et al.,
2012), virus-free transfection, recombinant proteins and
microRNAs (Walmsley et al., 2014). Using similar strategies, vari-
ous somatic cells have been directly converted into other cell types,
which are named direct reprogramming or transdifferentiation.
Although there are several stem-cell-focused databases, such as
SyStemCell (Yu et al., 2012) and StemCellDB (Mallon et al., 2013),
to the best of our knowledge, there is no database that focuses on
comprehensively collecting and analyzing cellular reprogramming

information, especially the reprogramming factors (genes or chem-
ical molecules). To fill this gap, we collected experimentally verified
reprogramming records from published articles and built Rde (cel-
lular reprogramming database), which is proposed to facilitate the
new prescription screening and assist with investigating the mechan-
ism of cellular reprogramming.

2 Methods

We collect reprogramming information from published literature
included in the PubMed database and Web of Knowledge by using
all the keywords ‘induced pluripotent stem cell’ AND ‘generation’,
‘induced pluripotent stem cell’ AND ‘differentiation’, ‘direct reprog-
ramming’. More than 2000 articles were obtained from PubMed
and Web of Knowledge in this way. Based on the keywords, these
articles are divided into three categories: IPSC generation, IPSCs dif-
ferentiation and direct reprogramming. We manually extract reprog-
ramming information from each article and the information is
uploaded to Rde after reviewing (supplementary material).

The ﬂowchart of the construction of Rde is illustrated in
Figure 1. For IPSCs generation, we collect information regarding the
cell lines used for reprogramming, reprogramming factors (genes,
microRNAs and chemical molecules) and species. Based on the
method used to deliver the reprogramming factors, we divide the
entries into ‘virus’ and ‘non-virus’. For manually extracted genes
and microRNAs, we further map them to NCBI/EMBL Entrez IDs
according to the symbols and description. Genes and microRNAs
that cannot be found in public databases are removed (Supplement
Material). A variety of biological databases, such as mirTarBase
(Hsu et al., 2014), STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2011) and
AnimalTFDB (Zhang et al., 2012), are integrated to provide func-
tional and regulatory information about genes and microRNAs
(Fig. 1A, B).

To help users find new reprogramming genes, we also provide an
online tool for data analysis, which compares multiple tissues and
identifies differentially expressed transcription factors and genes
(Fig. 1C). We download the expression profiles of 27 human tissues
and 6 mouse tissues from ATLAS (Petryszak et al., 2014). The de-
tails of data processing and identification of differentially expressed
genes can be found in supplementary file. Experimentally validated
transcription factors are downloaded from AnimalTFDB and such
information is used to identify transcription factors from the differ-
entially expressed genes.

3 Results

The database includes reprogramming records of 250 cell lines, 197
genes and microRNAs, 144 chemical molecules and culture methods
and 526 functional annotations. We classify the entries into two cat-
egories: ‘Gene and microRNAs’ and ‘Molecules and culture
methods’.

Users can explore all entries of the database through the
‘Browse’ page and compare gene expression levels of multiple tissues
in the ‘Analysis’ page. All the results can be downloaded for further
analysis. A tutorial for the database is available in the ‘Help’ page,
including searching genes of interest, using the database to obtain
reprogramming protocols and downloading the results for further
analysis. Detailed information about genes and microRNAs
involved in cellular reprogramming can be found in the ‘Gene’ page,
which includes basic gene information, functional information, GO
information, protein-protein interactions and regulatory relation-
ships. All functional information is manually extracted from litera-
ture describing the role of genes in the reprogramming process. With
Rde, users can find genes, microRNAs and chemical molecules
used for reprogramming processes. The ‘Molecules and Culture
Methods’ page lists all chemical molecules and culture methods de-
posited in Rde.

4 Discussion and conclusions

Rde is an integrated database comprising plenty of experimentally
validated reprogramming information. Our aim is to collect compre-
hensive information used for cellular reprogramming and make it
freely accessible to users. Rde provides detailed information about
experimentally verified genes and microRNAs, including gene de-
scriptions and functional annotations manually extracted from the
literature. The development and expansion of Rde will keep on
going and more valuable resources will be integrated into the data-
base in the future. As an efficient bioinformatics tool, Rde will as-
sist in the discovery of novel reprogramming factors in a broad
spectrum of cell reprogramming research.

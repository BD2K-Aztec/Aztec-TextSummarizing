Abstract

Motivation: Traditionally, gene phylogenies have been reconstructed solely on the basis of mo-
lecular sequences; this, however, often does not provide enough information to distinguish be-
tween statistically equivalent relationships. To address this problem, several recent methods have
incorporated information on the species phylogeny in gene tree reconstruction, leading to dramatic
improvements in accuracy. Although probabilistic methods are able to estimate all model param-
eters but are computationally expensive, parsimony methods—generally computationally more ef-
ficient—require a prior estimate of parameters and of the statistical support.

Results: Here, we present the Tree Estimation using Reconciliation (TERA) algorithm, a parsimony
based, species tree aware method for gene tree reconstruction based on a scoring scheme combin-
ing duplication, transfer and loss costs with an estimate of the sequence likelihood. TERA explores
all reconciled gene trees that can be amalgamated from a sample of gene trees. Using a large scale
simulated dataset, we demonstrate that TERA achieves the same accuracy as the corresponding
probabilistic method while being faster, and outperforms other parsimony-based methods in both
accuracy and speed. Running TERA on a set of 1099 homologous gene families from complete
cyanobacterial genomes, we find that incorporating knowledge of the species tree results in a two
thirds reduction in the number of apparent transfer events.

1 Introduction

 

Molecular phylogenetics infers gene trees based on the information
contained in molecular sequences. Unfortunately, individual
sequences may contain limited signal, and, as a result, phylogenetic
reconstruction often involves choosing between statistically equiva-
lent or weakly distinguishable evolutionary relationships.

Although each homologous gene family has its own unique
story, these are all related by a shared species history—which can be
helpful for gene tree inference (Maddison, 1997; Szblldsi et al.,
2014). In the past decade, several methods have been developed that

model the evolutionary processes that generate gene trees within the
species tree (Akerborg et al., 2009; Arvestad, 2003; Hallett and
Lagergren, 2001; Rannala and Yang, 2003; Rasmussen and Kellis,
2007, 2012; Sjostrand et al., 2014; Suchard, 2005; Szblldsi et al.,
2012, 2013a; Than and Nakhleh, 2009). From an inference perspec-
tive, these methods attempt to find the optimal way to explain the
phylogenetic signal in extant sequences—represented as a gene
tree—given the species tree. They explore the set of possible recon-
ciliations, i.e. different ways to draw the gene tree into the species
tree given some combination of macro evolutionary events, such as

gene duplications, gene transfers, gene losses and incomplete lineage
sorting. Studies that incorporate such events into gene tree inference
have shown that information on the species phylogeny significantly
improves the accuracy of gene tree inference (Akerborg et al., 2009;
Boussau et al., 2013; Rasmussen and Kellis, 2010; Szolldsi et al.,
2013b). To design such species tree aware methods for reconstruct-
ing gene phylogenies, the space of reconciled gene trees must be
explored using information from both a model of sequence evolu-
tion and a reconciliation model, in order to optimize a joint se-
quence-reconciliation score. Such exploration is computationally
expensive with traditional optimization approaches that rely on the
local search of the space of gene trees.

To circumvent this problem, David and Alm (2010) introduced
the amalgamation algorithm, described in detail in Section 2.3
below and illustrated in Figure 1. Furthermore, Szolldsi et al.
(2013b) recently developed an approach to exhaustively explore all
reconciled gene trees that can be amalgamated from a sample of
gene trees, i.e. obtainable by combining clades observed in the sam-
ple. Additionally, their method—ALE, for Amalgamated Likelihood
Estimation—combines the amalgamation algorithm of David and
Alm (2010) with conditional clade probabilities (CCPs) introduced
by Hohna and Drummond (2012) and reconstructs the gene phylog-
enies by optimizing a joint sequence-reconciliation likelihood score,
resulting in gene trees that are dramatically more accurate than
those reconstructed using molecular sequences alone.

ALE overcomes a fundamental limitation of recent parsimony
based methods that improve gene trees given a putative species tree
(David and Alm, 2010; Nguyen et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2013).
Unlike those methods, it does not require the user to specify a cost

sample of gene trees

 

best sequence-only

for each type of event or a threshold on statistical supports.
However, ALE faces the drawbacks associated with probabilistic
methods. In particular: (i) when computing the reconciliation score,
ALE has an increased computational cost compared with a parsi-
mony algorithm (e.g. Conow et al., 2010; Doyon et al., 2010),
which is due to a potentially large constant factor resulting from the
numerical integration of the likelihood; (ii) ALE’s results are contin-
gent on difficult to estimate time-like branch lengths of the species
tree, while parsimony methods can reconcile gene trees relying only
on the order of speciations in time (e.g. Doyon et al., 2010), and
even deal with undated species trees (e.g. Bansal et al., 2012).
Parsimony methods in general, despite lacking an explicit connec-
tion to a generative probabilistic model and relying on other heuris-
tics, have been shown to be highly accurate, comparable to
sophisticated probabilistic reconciliation methods, with reduced
runtime (Wu et al., 2013, 2014).

Here we present the TERA algorithm (Tree Estimation using
Reconciliation and Amalgamation) that amalgamates the most par-
simonious reconciled gene tree from a set of gene trees reconstructed
from a unique gene alignment, according to a joint sequence-recon-
ciliation score. Although TERA, like other parsimony based meth-
ods, requires the prior specification of the costs associated with
duplication, transfer and loss (DTL) events, it does not require prior
assumptions about a statistical support threshold, as it estimates a
self-consistent support threshold from its input. Furthermore, TERA
considers explicitly the possibility of transfer from extinct or
unsampled branches of the species tree, which is expected to be
the case for practically all transfers (Szolldsi et al., 2013a).
TERA does not, however, consider incomplete lineage sorting.

Fig. 1. CCPs can be used to estimate the posterior probability of any tree that can be amalgamatedfrom clades present in a sample of gene trees (David and Alm,
2010; H6hna and Drummond, 2012). Conditional clade frequencies can be used to approximate CCPs and are computed as the proportion of occurrences of a par-
ticular split of a clade according to a tripartition 77:, e.g. (abcl de) among all trees in which the clade, e.g. (abode), is found. Estimates based on the sample of trees
on the left are shown as fractions for two different gene trees that can be amalgamated. The estimate for a gene tree is given by the sum of the reconciliation
score and the logarithm of the tree CCPs. Based on the sample on the left, the tree with the highest posterior probability is the third tree (blue online). Reconciling
it with the species tree requires one transfer and one loss event. It is, however, possible to combine clades present in the second (green online) and third (blue on-
line) trees to produce a gene tree that is not present in the original sample but is identical to the species tree, i.e. it requires no events to draw it into the species
tree. Depending on the costs of transfer and loss events, and the self-consistently estimated 0A parameter, the scenario without transfer might be optimal for the

Joint amalgamation of parsimonious reconciled gene trees

The self-consistent score estimation scheme used by TERA,
introduced in Section 2.4, should be applicable to other parsimony
methods, while amalgamation is in theory compatible with any rec-
onciliation algorithm that assumes branches of the gene tree to be
independent.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Preliminaries

Given a binary rooted tree T, we respectively denote by V(T), E(T),
L(T) and r(T), its node, edge, leaf node sets and root node. The label
of each leaf u is denoted by £(u), while the set of labels of leaves of
T is denoted by £(T). Given a node u E V(T), we denote respect-
ively by up, uS and {u1, ur} the father, the sibling and the children of
u (if they are defined). Note that in this article all trees are con-
sidered as unordered, so u1 and ur are interchangeable. For a node u
of T, Tu denotes the subtree of T rooted at u. Given two nodes u and
v of T, u 3 Tu (u<Tv, respectively) if and only if v is on the unique
path from u to r(T) (respectively, and u 75 v); in such a case, u is said
to be a (strict) descendant of 12. Given a node u of T, we define the
clade associated with u, denoted by C(u), as the set £(Tu). If u is an
internal node, we define the tripartition associated with u, denoted
by H(u), as the triple (£(Tu), £(Tul), £(Tur)). For leaf nodes, the
trivial tripartition H(u) is defined as the triple (£(u), Q), 0). Finally,
the height of T is denoted by l7(T).

In this article, unless stated otherwise, we assume that gene and
species trees are rooted, binary and uniquely leaf labeled, i.e. within
each tree there is a bijection between leaves and labels. Due to this
bijectivity we will refer to leaves and labels interchangeably.

We define a gene tree G as a tree where each leaf represents an
extant gene. Similarly, a species tree S is defined as a tree in which
each leaf represents a distinct extant species. Note that several leaves
of a gene tree can be associated to the same species due to gene birth
corresponding to duplication and transfer events. Formally, we indi-
cate this by a surjective function s : £(G) —> £(S), called the species
labeling of G. The set of species labels of the leaves of G is denoted
8(G).

A tree T is said to be time ordered when it is associated with a
time function (9T : V(T) —> RT that associates each of its nodes with
a non-negative value so that, for any two nodes x, x’ E V(T), if x’ is
a strict descendant of x then 0T(x’) < 0T(x). Moreover, Vx E L(T),
we have that (93 = 0. A subdivision T’ of a time-ordered tree T is
the tree obtained from T by adding a new node y with (97(3)) on
each edge (xp,x) E E(T) such that there exists z E V(T) with
(9T(x) < 0T(z) < 0T(xp). For nodes x E V(T’) corresponding to
nodes already present in T, we set (9T1  2 GT

2.2 Species tree-gene tree reconciliation

Here, we consider the problem of finding the most parsimonious
reconciliation (MPR) when considering—as possible macro-events
that result in the birth and death of gene copies—speciation, gene
duplication, gene transfers and gene loss (Szolldsi and Daubin,
2012). The general problem of finding an MPR is known to be NP-
complete, even for reconciling two binary trees (Tofigh et al., 201 1).
The complexity of the problem is due to the difficulty of ensuring
the time consistency of gene transfers, i.e. satisfying the chronolo-
gical constraints among nodes of the species tree that are induced by
transfer events. However, the problem becomes polynomially solv-
able when accepting a time-ordered species tree as input (among
others Conow et al., 2010; Doyon et al., 2010 Tofigh, 2009, see
Doyon et al., 2011 for a review). In this article, we build upon the

combinatorial reconciliation model introduced by Doyon et al.
(2010), which can be used to solve this special case of the problem.

Some parsimony methods (e.g. Bansal et al., 2012) do not need
information on the order of speciations in time. This allows a more
efficient recursion over reconciliations, but at the cost of considering
reconciliations that contain transfer events that are not consistent
with any ordering of the species tree (Tofigh et al., 2011).

The DTIL model of Doyon et al. (2010) can be used to reconcile a
time-ordered binary species tree S with a binary gene tree G by con-
structing a mapping or that maps each node u E V(G) into an
ordered list of nodes in V(S’), namely the ancestral and/or extant
species in which the sequence corresponding to u evolved. This
model takes into account four kinds of biological events: speciation,
gene duplication, gene transfer and gene loss. The atomic events of
this model are: a speciation (S), a duplication (D), a transfer (T), a
transfer followed immediately by the loss of the non-transferred
child (TIL), a speciation followed by the loss of one of the two result-
ing children (SL), and a contemporary event (C) that associates an
extant gene to its corresponding species. Finally, a null event (0), is
used to model a gene lineage crossing a time boundary. Note that
duplication-loss events and transfer followed by the loss of the trans-
ferred gene, unlike a transfer followed by the loss of the non-trans-
ferred gene and speciation-loss events, leave no trace and are
therefore undetectable. This is why, in the DTIL model, losses are
never considered alone. We refer the reader to Doyon et al. (2010)
for the formal definition of a DTIL reconciliation.

Let (9, r, 2 be, respectively, the costs of a duplication, a transfer
and a loss. Given a DTIL reconciliation, we define the cost of or,
denoted by c(oc), as the sum (9d + rt + lil, where d, t and l are respect-
ively the number of ID) events, of T and TL events, and of SL and TL
events in or. In Doyon et al. (2010) the authors give an efficient algo-
rithm to compute c(G, S) for a time-ordered species tree S and a
gene tree G, where c(G, S) is defined as the minimum cost over all
possible DTIL reconciliations between G and S.

2.3 Choosing a reliable gene tree among several
competing alternatives

Even though our aim is to reconstruct reliable gene trees from a mul-
tiple sequence alignment and a species phylogeny, our approach
does not directly take sequence alignments as an input, but requires
a sample of gene trees, typically produced from the alignment by ei-
ther a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods such as
PhyloBayes (Lartillot et al., 2009) and MrBayes (Ronquist et al.,
2012), or bootstrap resampling.

To find the optimal gene tree, clades found in the input sample
of gene trees are combined using the amalgamation approach in
order to recover an optimal tree with respect to our scoring scheme.
The optimal tree recovered will only contain clades found in the in-
put sample of gene trees, but it will not in general be found in the
sample itself.

Figure 1 provides a schematic illustration of the amalgamation
approach. Clades present in the sample of trees (the unrooted trees
on the left) can be combined to obtain a tree such that each clade is
found in the sample, but the tree itself is not. For example, one can
produce a green-blue tree consisting of a green subtree with genes a,
b and c, and a blue subtree with genes (1, e and f. The sequence score
of each tree is obtained using CCPs that depend on the number of
times different trees are seen in the sample and is described in detail
in the next section. The reconciliation score for each tree corres-
ponds to the MPR of the gene tree with the species tree. The amal-
gamation algorithm itself is a joint dynamic programming recursion

over (i) all trees that can be produced from clades present in the in-
put sample and (ii) all possible ways to reconcile each of these trees
with the species tree, to recover a gene tree with the smallest joint se-
quence-reconciliation score. As shown in Figure 1 in the online
appendix, amalgamation permits us to explore a vastly larger set of
trees than those contained in the sample.

Conceptually, both ALE (Szolldsi et al., 2013b) and TERA are
based on the amalgamation approach of AnGST (David and Alm,
2010), and all three methods are—at the level of the dynamic pro-
gramming recursion—closely related. TERA differs from AnGST in
the underlying reconciliation model (Doyon et al., 2010) and be-
cause it allows transfers going/coming from extinct or unsampled
species (Szolldsi et al., 2013a). Moreover, the AnGST scoring
scheme is solely based on the reconciliation score. ALE differs from
TERA in that it relies on a complex underlying probabilistic model;
the results of which, in contrast to TERA, are contingent on time-
like branch lengths of the species tree.

TERA’s amalgamation algorithm can be regarded as a generaliza-
tion of the gene tree reconciliation algorithm of Doyon et al. (2010),
which iterates over reconciliations by mapping each node of a gene
tree to branches of the species tree. In the joint recursion presented in
this article, instead of nodes of a gene tree, the clades found in the in-
put sample of gene trees are mapped into branches of the species tree.

More formally, assume we are given a set of (unrooted) gene
trees 9 on the same leaf set reconstructed from a unique sequence
alignment. We denote respectively by A(9) and 11(9) the union of
all the clades, and the union of all tripartitions in 9. For each tripar-
tition TC, we denote by 7t[1] (7t[2] and 7t[3], respectively) the first (se-
cond and third, respectively) element of TC. If 9 contains unrooted
trees we consider all possible rootings for each tree when computing
A(9) and 11(9). Furthermore, for a given clade C of A(9), we denote
by 11(C) the set of tripartitions TC 6 11(9) for which 7r[1] = C. When
focusing only on the reconciliation score, the optimization problem
consists of computing c(9, S) := min Geng(G,S), where 9am is the
set of gene trees such that A(G) Q A(9) for all G 6 9am. The
pseudocode is given in Algorithm 1 in the appendix. Roughly speak-
ing, our algorithm starts by computing the subdivision S’ of S, and
the sets A(9) and 11(9). Then, it performs a joint traversal of all
gene tree clades and species tree branches wherein clades C in A(9)
are considered in order of increasing size, and nodes x’ of S in order
of increasing height. For each pair (C, x’) the algorithm computes
the cost of reconciling clade C with x’ by testing all possible triparti-
tions TC in 11(C). Because each non-trivial tripartition TC can be seen
as an internal node of an amalgamated tree, with children 7t[2] and
7t[3], the cost of reconciling a tripartition TC with x’ can be computed
according to Algorithm 1 of Doyon et al. (2010). We refer the reader
to Algorithm 1 of Doyon et al. (2010) for a better understanding of
the pseudocode. The correctness of our approach is proven in the
appendix.

Note that—for ease of writing—the pseudocode of the algorithm
does not contain the transfers from the dead, i.e. the transfers going/
coming from extinct or unsampled species (Szolldsi et al., 2013a).
However, Algorithm 1 can be easily modified to accommodate this
kind of event by adding to the species tree S a sister group of the root
clade such that, within this group, duplications and losses are free, spe-
ciations are not permitted, and transfers to this new group (formally
corresponding to unrepresented speciations) cost zero—similar to what
is done in the likelihood framework by Szolldsi et al. (2013a).

2.4 Taking into account the CCP
As described in the introduction, our goal is to create a species tree
aware method for reconstructing gene phylogenies that uses

information from both gene sequences and from the reconciliation
with a species tree. That is, we wish to construct a method that opti-
mizes a joint sequence-reconciliation score. In order to do this, we
must find an efficient manner to incorporate a sequence based cost
in addition to the reconciliation cost of Doyon et al. (2010) in the
amalgamation scheme.

AnGST, the seminal algorithm of David and Alm (2010) that
introduced the idea of amalgamation, does not distinguish between
trees that can be amalgamated. The problem with this approach is
that, as the number of input trees—and thus the amount of informa-
tion given as input—increases, the set of possible trees that can be
amalgamated also increases—until all possible tree topologies can
be amalgamated. At this point, since all possible tree topologies can
be amalgamated, the most parsimonious reconciled gene tree will
only depend on the reconciliation score. In practice this introduces
the problem that the topology of the amalgamated gene tree may
vary significantly when adding only a few trees to the sample of trees
(in the worst case only one tree).

In a probabilistic framework, conditional clade probabilities
(CCPs, cf. Fig. 1) provide an accurate approximation of posterior
probabilities for a very large number of tree topologies from a
smaller MCMC sample (Hohna and Drummond, 2012; Larget,
2013; Szolldsi et al., 2013b). The CCP of a rooted tree G 6 921m
(Hohna and Drummond, 2012), denoted by PCCp(G), is defined as
the product of the conditional probabilities of all partitions in
11(G). The conditional probability of the partition of clade C ac-
cording to the tripartition TC is denoted PCCP(TC) and is approximated
by the ratio fg(7t)/fg(7t[1]), where for each clade C E A(9) and for
each tripartition TC 6 11(9), fg(7‘C) and fg(C) is the frequency of C and
TC in 9.

Here, in order to construct a parsimony method that optimizes a
joint sequence-reconciliation score, we choose to minimize the joint
cost

Cjoint(G,S) = C(QS) + CANA (1)

over G 6 gm, where the parameter cA weights the contribution of
the sequence alignment N A to the cost, defined as

PCCP(G) ) (2)

NA 2 —log (PCCP(GMAP)

where Pccp(GMAp) corresponds to the posterior probability of the
gene tree with the highest posterior probability according to the se-
quence alignment. The logarithm of the CCP provides an additive
cost for deviation from the phylogeny preferred by the sequence
alignment alone, similar to the additive cost for deviation from spe-
cies phylogeny provided by the DTL event costs. The parameter cA
is analogous to a statistical support threshold, corresponding to a
cost cA for each point of log posterior probability difference between
the log posterior probability of a given phylogeny and the gene tree
with highest posterior probability.

As illustrated in Figure 1, Algorithm 1 in online appendix is easily
modified by adding cA - log (PCCP(7'C|C)) to cs, cm) cT while filling the
dynamic programming matrix (on line 15, 17 and 18 of Algorithm 1,
respectively). The term +cA - log (PCCP(GMAp)), corresponding to the
gene tree with the highest posterior probability, can be neglected dur-
ing cost minimization as it simply corresponds to an additive constant.

Given estimates for the DTL costs (available for example in
David and Alm, 2010; Nguyen et al., 2013), the parameter cA can
be estimated in a self-consistent manner.

However, finding the proper weight between the disagreement
with the species tree (increase in DTL events) and the disagreement

with the sequence alignment (decrease in log (Pccp(G))) is difficult.
Our estimation approach consists of looking for the set of costs that
are the most self-consistent, i.e. the ratio of costs that best corres-
ponds to the ratio of events.

We assume a simple model for how costs determine the number
of events: each type of event, i.e. DTL events as well as the disagree-
ment with the alignment counted by N A, are considered to occur in-
dependently, such that events with smaller costs are expected to
occur more frequently. In particular, the expected amount of dis-
agreement with the species tree due to, respectively duplications,
transfers and losses, is proportional to exp (—6), exp (—‘C)
and exp (—2), while the expected amount of disagreement with the
sequence alignment is propotional to exp (—cA). The observed
amount of disagreement with the species tree is given by the sum of
the number of DTL events, i.e. N D, NT and N L, while the observed
amount of disagreement with the sequence alignment is given by
N A. We then employ an expectation maximization like recursion
equating at each step the observed frequencies with the expected
frequencies:

Algorithm 1 is then run until |cfffw — cA| is larger then a threshold 6.

2.51mplementation and validation
TERA is implemented in C++ and is freely available from http://
mbb.univ-montp2.fr/MBB/download_sources/16_TERA.

Posterior samples of gene trees, for both simulated and real
alignments, were downloaded together with the ‘true’ gene trees
used to simulate alignments from the dryad data repository
(doi:10.5061/dryad.pv6df) provided by Szolldsi et al. (2013b).

For all the parsimony-based species tree aware methods, includ-
ing TERA, we used the DTL costs 6:2, I: 3, 2: 1 obtained by
David and Alm (2010) using a criteria based on minimizing the
change in ancestral genome sizes on a large biological dataset. We
ran TreeFix-DTL with default parameters, JTT/GTR with a gamma
distribution as models of evolution, and as a starting tree the
PhyML tree. MowgliNNI was run with default parameters, a thresh-
old of 50 for weak edges, and with the PhyML tree—with bootstrap
values—as a starting gene tree. AnGST was run with default param-
eters using the dated species tree on samples of 1000 gene trees,
whereas JPrIME-DLTRS was run with JTT with a gamma distribu-
tion as model of evolution, 100 000 iterations, a thinning factor of
10 and a time out of 10 h. Finally, we ran TERA with a starting cA
of 0.1 and for 9 samples from 10 up to 10 000 gene trees for each
simulated alignment. The gene trees reconstructed by ALE were
downloaded from the above mentioned data repository.

Note that, from a practical perspective, the DTL costs we use are
the default parameters for all the parsimonious methods described
in the article, and seem to work well for several parts of the Tree of
Life. If the user suspects that these values are not suited for the ana-
lyses, these parameters should be estimated beforehand, e.g. using
the ALE method.

3 Results

To test the accuracy of gene trees reconstructed using TERA we
chose a dataset based on 1099 homologous gene families present in
36 cyanobacterial genomes. This dataset, published in Szolldsi et al.
(2013b), was constructed using homologous families from the
HOGENOM database (Penel et al., 2009) and contains both real

and simulated alignments as well as the gene trees used to simulate
sequences. The mean number of genes per family in this dataset
is 36.66, the largest family has 114 genes and the smallest 21
genes; the mean number of species in which a family is found is
31.49, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 36; the mean copy
number per genome—counting as zero genomes in which a family
is absent—is 1.012, with a minimum of 0.5833 and a maximum
of 3.17.

We chose this dataset, because (i) it contains a diverse set of gene
families from a reasonably large and divergent set of species, and (ii)
the parametric bootstrap-like simulation procedure used attempts to
retain as much of the complexity of the underlying biological dataset
as possible (Szolldsi et al., 2013b). Furthermore, to emulate the rela-
tive complexity of real data compared with available models of se-
quence evolution, we used a complex model of sequence evolution
to simulate sequences—an LG model (Le and Gascuel, 2008) with
across-site rate variation and invariant sites—and used PhyloBayes
(Lartillot et al., 2009) with a simpler model—a Poisson model
(Felsenstein, 1981) with no rate variation—to produce the sample of
gene trees used by both TERA and AnGST (see below for more
details).

3.1 Validation on simulated data

For the simulated alignments, both the ‘true’ gene tree used to gener-
ate the sequences and the species tree—along which the gene trees
evolved—are known. Consequently, it is possible to directly assess
the accuracy of different reconstruction methods in recovering the
correct gene tree.

As shown in Figure 1a in the online appendix, the number of
possible amalgamations increases roughly exponentially with
increasing sample size in the simulated dataset, but the median re-
construction accuracy achieved by TERA begins to saturate (Figure
1b in the online appendix). To compare the accuracy of our method
to that of others, we reconstructed gene trees using six different ‘spe-
cies tree aware’ methods: (i) the TERA algorithm described here, (ii)
ALE (Szolldsi et al., 2013b), (iii) TreeFix-DTL (Bansal et al., 2014,
submitted for publication, http://compbio.mit.edu/treefix-dtl/), (iv)
MowgliNNI (Nguyen et al., 2013), (v) AnGST (David and Alm,
2010) and (vi) JPrIME-DLTRS (Sjostrand et al., 2014) as well as the
species tree unaware method, PhyML (Guindon et al., 2010).

In Figure 2a, we plot the normalized Robinson-Foulds (defined
as the Robinson-Foulds distance divided by its maximum possible
value, and denoted as n-R-F in the following) distance of the recon-
structed gene trees to the true tree. These results show that all of the
species tree aware methods achieve better accuracy than the species
tree unaware method PhyML, which is to be expected as they are
given additional information in the form of the species tree. Among
the species tree aware methods, with an input of 10000 samples
TERA’s accuracy is statistically indistinguishable from the more
complex maximum likelihood based results from ALE (paired
Wilcoxon test P > 0.1) and is significantly more accurate than
TreeFix-DTL (Bansal et al., 2014, submitted for publication) (paired
Wilcoxon test P< 10‘s) as well as the other species tree aware
method MowgliNNI (Nguyen et al., 2013). TERA also outper-
formed jPrIME-DLTRS, although the accuracy of the latter may
have been limited by the available run time (recall that a time out of
10h per each data set was given). For an input of 1000 samples,
TERA is less accurate than either TERA or ALE with 10 000 input
samples (paired Wilcoxon tests P < 10‘8), statistically indistinguish-
able from jPrIME-DLTRS, slightly more accurate then TreeFix-DTL
(paired Wilcoxon test P = 0.026), and still significantly more accur-
ate than MowgliNNI and AnGST (paired Wilcoxon tests P < 10‘8).

1000 samples

Fig. 2. (a) To compare the accuracy of TERA and other methods we used the
simulated data set of Szélldsi et al. (2013b). We find that TERA achieves statis-
tically equivalent accuracy to ALE and better accuracy than the other meth-
ods, see main text for details. (b) To test for over and underfitting of the
species tree we examined the 431 gene families with exactly one copy in
each of the 36 cyanobacterial species. For each family we plot the difference
of the R-F distance of the true tree to the species tree and the R-F distance of
the reconstructed gene tree from the species tree. Negative values for the dif-
ference indicate overfitting, while in the case of underfitting we expect a posi-
tive value

Results for AnGST are only shown for sample sizes of 1000 gene
trees, due to the very large memory requirement of the AnGST im-
plementation. To investigate the effect of using a joint sequence-rec-
onciliation score we also ran TERA with cA=0, i.e. emulating
AnGST in only optimizing the reconciliation score. We found that
on a sample of 1000 trees AnGST was more accurate then TERA
with cA= 0 with an n-R-F of, 0.156 and 0.166, respectively.
However, using TERA with only 1000 samples, but estimating cA,
resulted in a mean n-R-F of 0.146. The average cA estimated by
TERA was 0.49 while the average N A was 6.57.

An important difference of TreeFix-DTL compared with the
other methods considered here, is that it does not use information of
the time order of speciation events in the species tree (note that
AnGST can also run without information on time ordering).
Therefore TreeFix-DTL uses less information, which may explain

lysis to gene families that have exactly one copy in each species.
In this case, we can simply use the n-R-F distance between the spe-
cies tree and each of the gene trees as our similarity measure. In
Figure 2b, we show the results for the 431 single copy universal gene
families in our simulated dataset. We measure the extent of over and
underfitting as the difference in n-R-F distance between the species
tree and the reconstructed gene tree and the n-R-F distance between
the species tree and the true gene tree. We observe that the species
tree unaware method, PhyML, as expected, reconstructs trees that
are more distant to the species tree than the true tree. The results for
the species tree aware methods are more variable: ALE, based on an
explicit probabilistic approach, exhibits a median difference of zero
and produces only a few examples of overfitting. TERA, which esti-
mates the cA parameter giving the relative weight of the sequence
and reconciliation component of the joint score, also achieves a me-
dian difference of zero when 10 000 samples are given as input, but
produces a somewhat larger number of slightly overfitted trees.
When only 1000 samples are used, both TERA and AnGST underfit
the species tree, similar to jPRIME-DLTRS, suggesting that it may
be a lack of convergence of the sampling in all cases. TreeFix-DTL,
which relies on a fixed support threshold, shows signs of more sig-
nificant overfitting; while MowgliNNI substantially underfits the
species tree, at least with the default parameters used here.

The runtimes for the methods discussed in this section are given
in Table 1. We can see that TERA has the fastest stand-alone run-
time. However, if the runtime necessary to generate the input tree(s)

are considered, Mowgli is the fastest method, but it is also the least
accurate (cf. Fig. 2a). For an input size of 1000 samples TERA
achieves comparable accuracy to TreeFix-DTL, but with a seven
fold reduced mean runtime. For an input size of 10000 samples
TERA achieves similar accuracy to ALE and outperforms TreeFix-
DTL, but considering the time to generate the required inputs
TreeFix-DTL is 1.3 times faster on average.

3.2 Results on real data

In order to test TERA on biological data, we again used the dataset
published in Szélldsi et al. (2013b), but focusing on real alignments.
As inputs to TERA we used: (i) the tree samples obtained from real
alignments and (ii) the ML species tree unaware gene trees obtained
using PhyML from the same alignments. Similar to the results of
ALE (Szblldsi et al., 2013b), we find that the number of transfer and
loss events (but not duplication events) in most parsimonious recon-
ciled gene trees is substantially lower than those found in the most
parsimonious reconciliations of PhyML trees: the mean and median
number of transfers per family was 3.914 and 3 compared with
10.38 and 9, respectively; the mean and median number of losses
per family was 5.088 and 4 compared with 7.542 and 7, respect-
ively, while the mean and median number of duplications per family
was 1.071 and 0 compared with 1.042 and 0, respectively.

4 Discussion

We have presented a detailed description of the TERA algorithm, a
parsimony-based species tree aware method of gene tree reconstruc-
tion. We demonstrate that TERA reconstructs gene trees with nearly
identical accuracy as the more complex ML based ALE method and,
at least on the simulated datasets considered here, outperforms the
other parsimony based species tree aware methods.

Examining a subset of single copy universal gene families we
show that TERA does not overfit or underfit the species tree. This
result lends credibility to TERA’s results on biological data, whereby
two thirds of apparent gene transfers in gene trees reconstructed
without taking into consideration the species tree are not recovered
given knowledge of the species phylogeny.

Although parsimony based methods are fundamentally limited in
some aspects compared with model based probabilistic methods, in
the case of species tree aware gene tree reconstruction our results in-
dicate that parsimony based methods can closely approach their ac-
curacy. A further advantage of TERA compared with the
corresponding probabilistic method ALE is that it is faster (if only
up to a constant factor), does not require explicit time-like branch
lengths that are difficult to estimate, and due to its relative simpli-
city, in particular the lack of numerical integration, is more robust
in practice. Compared with parsimony based methods that require
prior assumptions about statistical support, TERA is distinguished
by its ability to estimate a statistical support threshold from its in-
put. In contrast to the methods considered here it does require more
elaborate upstream analysis, taking as its input a sample of trees
from e.g. an MCMC-based tree inference methods, while in contrast
MowgliNNI requires a single tree with branch supports, and
TreeFix-DTL a multiple sequence alignment.

Finally, while we have shown that it is possible to estimate the
cA parameter, we have been less successful in estimating all four
costs (5,1,2,cA) simultaneously, due to the tendency of the cost esti-
mates to diverge toward a very low transfer cost, and a correspond-
ingly large number of transfers. We expect that relaxing the, in

general, unrealistic assumption of independence between events
could ameliorate this problem.

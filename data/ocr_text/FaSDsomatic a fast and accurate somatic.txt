ABSTRACT

Summary: Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technol-
ogies have enabled us to sequence large number of cancer samples
to reveal novel insights into oncogenetic mechanisms. However, the
presence of intratumoral heterogeneity, normal cell contamination and
insufficient sequencing depth, together pose a challenge for detecting
somatic mutations. Here we propose a fast and an accurate somatic
single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) detection program, FaSD-somatic.
The performance of FaSD-somatic is extensively assessed on various
types of cancer against several state-of—the-art somatic SNV detection
programs. Benchmarked by somatic SNVs from either existing data-
bases or de novo higher-depth sequencing data, FaSD-somatic has
the best overall performance. Furthermore, FaSD-somatic is efficient,
it finishes somatic SNV calling within 14h on 50X whole genome
sequencing data in paired samples.

1 INTRODUCTION

Next-generation sequencing and third-generation sequencing are
widely used to detect genetic mutations from tumor tissues and
their paired normal tissues (from the same individual), providing
an immense power for understanding the cause of cancer.
Besides the inherited germ line mutations, the newly acquired
somatic mutations constitute the majority of genetic mutations
that cause cancer (Hua et al., 2013; Stratton et al., 2009).
Increasing evidences show that tumoral heterogeneity exists
not only in intertumoral level but also in intratumoral level
(Gerlinger et al., 2012; Swanton, 2012). When the sequencing
depth is insufﬁcient, the minor clones, which may harbor the
meaningful positively selected mutations, could be easily con-
cealed by the dominant clones. Furthermore, owing to the

presence of non-tumor cells in the bulk of tumor, the proportion
of effective covered reads with somatic mutations will decrease,
therefore making somatic mutation detection more difﬁcult.
Finally, the germ line variants can outnumber somatic variants
by several orders of magnitudes (Pleasance et al., 2010); this
further complicates the difﬁculty of somatic mutation detection.

Efforts have been made by both biologists and bioinformati—
cians ato overcome those challenges, but the methods to call
somatic single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) directly from
sequencing data with accuracy and efﬁciency are still in
demand. (Supplementary Section 1).

2 METHODS
2.1 Model of FaSD-somatic

We assume that tumor samples could be modeled as a mixture of a
normal clone and several tumor clones. The tumor clones include a dom-
inant and several minor clones. Our model considers not only the dom-
inant tumor clone, where majority of somatic SNVs come from, but also
the minor ones with relatively lower frequency of somatic mutations.
Because all clones are from the same individual, the dependency of
tumor and normal clones could be used to infer genotypes (Larson
et al., 2012). We ﬁrst count genotypes of all possible diploid clones that
may exist in tumor sample, then use the FaSD model for SNPs calling
(Xu et al., 2012). Finally, we use a joint genotype likelihoods model to
analyze the tumor-normal paired sequencing data and infer high-quality
somatic SNVs. (Supplementary Sections 2 and 3).

2.2 Implementation

FaSD-somatic is a command line tool, written in C/C++ and can be
compiled in any computing environment with g++ support. It takes a
variety of input ﬁle formats including SAMtools pileup and BAM ﬁles.
To speed up the program, we tried strategies, such as earning time from
space. For example, for the comparison of two letters (reads), an array
containing 26 Boolean values was used instead of 26 letters. Then, the
comparison between letters became a Boolean value comparison, which
saved much time. For the functions to handle the BAM ﬁles, a set of
utilities written by C that can manipulate the alignments in BAM or SAM
ﬁles were borrowed from SAMtools (Li et al., 2009). SAMtools source
code was modiﬁed and integrated into FaSD-somatic, including the con-
version from the implicit variable type to explicit to ﬁt the compiler. We
also provided a script called runSOMApl to run FaSD-somatic in multi-
threads, which signiﬁcantly accelerates the process.

2.3 Evaluation metrics

Because large-scale experimental validation of somatic and non-somatic
variants is impractical, we measured the concordance of the somatic pre-
dictions with databases known to be enriched for either somatic or germ
line mutations. Catalog of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC) v64
(Forbes et al., 2011) was used to generate the gold standard for somatic
mutations. The gold standard for non-somatic mutation was built by
excluding COSMIC somatic SNVs from curated germ line mutations in
the phase 1 of 1000 genomes project.

To test the callers’ performance speciﬁcally on the shallow depth data,
we applied the receiver operating characteristic analysis. The VarScan2’s
high-conﬁdence (HC) somatic SNVs calling set on the higher-depth lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) data (~40X) is used as the benchmark.
(Supplementary Sections 4 and 5).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Evaluation benchmarked by known databases

As shown in Figure 1A, in the paired tumor and normal LUAD
samples with the lowest sequencing depth of 4X each, FaSD-
somatic has the highest concordance with the COSMIC vali-
dated somatic gold standard among all ﬁve somatic SNVs callers
(maximum concordance value 0.0079 compared with Varscan2’s
0.0060, SomaticSniper’s 0.0039, JointSNVmix’s 0.0023 and
SAMtools’ 0.0011). Even if the quality threshold decreases and
the number of predictions increases simultaneously, FaSD-som-
atic still had the highest concordance with somatic mutation
benchmark. In the aspect of the concordance with the 1000
Genomes Project validated germ line benchmark, FaSD-somatic
is <20% at the beginning, and it gradually decreases to reach the
third highest position with a value of 10% (Fig. 1B). We further
evaluated the programs for other cancer types. In the 6X
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Supplementary Fig. S1) and

50X lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) (Supplementary
Fig. S2) samples, similar trends were observed.

3.2 Evaluation benchmarked by de novo higher-depth data

First, ﬁve software were used to call somatic SNVs on a 4X
LUAD dataset, and the results were benchmarked by the
Varscan2’s HC calling result on the 40X LUAD data sequenced
from the same sample because somatic SNV calling at this depth
is considered of high quality (\Nang et al., 2013). The AUC of
FaSD-somatic has a mean value of 0.801, and the 95% non-
parametric conﬁdence interval is [0.765, 0.835], which is signiﬁ-
cantly higher than other software. Then, the 50% subsampled
data from benchmark itself was also evaluated. FaSD-somatic
outperformed others, especially in the loci with a sequencing
depth lower than 10X (Supplementary Figs S3—S5 and
Supplementary Tables Sl—S3).

3.3 Processing speed

The time taken for these tools to process the data is a major
bottleneck for sequencing data analysis. All ﬁve programs were
tested on a server, with 2.00GHz Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-
2620 and 64 GB memory. Based on one thread of single core
of CPU, FaSD-somatic can ﬁnish the whole genome somatic
SNVs calling within 4815, 8601 and 49 807s, respectively, on
4X LUAD, 6X GBM and 50X LUSC datasets, which is 38%
faster than SomaticSniper, 62% faster than SAMtools, 113%
faster than VarScan2 and 501% faster than J ointSNVmix
(Supplementary Fig. S6 and Supplementary Table S4).

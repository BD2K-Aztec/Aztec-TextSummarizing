ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identifier (ID) mapping establishes links between various
biological databases and is an essential first step for molecular
data integration and functional annotation. ID mapping allows
diverse molecular data on genes and proteins to be combined
and mapped to functional pathways and ontologies. We have
developed comprehensive protein-centric ID mapping services
providing mappings for 90 IDs derived from databases on genes,
proteins, pathways, diseases, structures, protein families, protein
interaction, literature, ontologies, etc. The services are widely used
and have been regularly updated since 2006.

1 INTRODUCTION

A central difﬁculty in integrating and comparing molecular data
is ﬁnding and maintaining correspondences of identiﬁers (IDs) for
genes, proteins and higher level functional groupings like pathways
and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Various research groups and data
repositories use different data sources, IDs and names for nucleotide
and proteins sequences in their analysis. The ﬁrst step to integrate
diverse datasets is to map the data to a common set of biological
objects. In our experience working with research labs, we are often
presented with 3—4 different types of database IDs for the same types
of biological object, whether proteins or genes. In addition, many
of these IDs are redundant in that several actually point to the same
gene/protein.

Several groups have developed tools to address this common
problem. Many take a gene—centric approach useful for genomic
and microarray work (Berriz and Roth, 2008; Bussey et al., 2003;
Diehn et al., 2003; Draghici et al., 2006; Huang Da et al., 2008;
Waegele et al., 2009). Others take a more protein—centric approach
(Cote et al., 2007; Mudunuri et al., 2009), which is more useful
for proteomics work, and also can be useful for systems biology
as proteins are often the active biological object that interacts with
other objects and pathways.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.
IThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two authors
should be regarded as joint First Authors.

We have developed comprehensive protein—centric ID mapping
tools and services built on the iProClass protein data warehouse
(Huang et al., 2003), which provides mappings between UniProtKB
(UniProt Consortium, 2009) and currently supports IDs from 90
data sources. The services allow individual and batch mappings as
well as programmatic access and FTP downloads. The mappings are
updated monthly.

2 METHODS

The data sources for ID mapping consist of UniProKB cross—references
and additional sequence and cross—reference information from the iProClass
database, which contains information derived from over 100 data sources in
records for over 14 million protein sequences. A complete list of data sources
is found at http://proteininformationresource.org/cgi—bin/iproclass_stat. ID
mappings can be one of the three types: (i) between similar biological
objects, for example, an NCBI GI number and UniProtKB accession for
a protein; (ii) between related biological objects Gene > mRNA > Protein,
for example, UniProt Accession to ENSEMBL gene; and (iii) mapping from
objects to their properties, such as a GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession to a
KEGG pathway ID or GO ID. Combining all three types provides a powerful
network from which biological knowledge can be extracted. Because of data
source heterogeneity, mapping between database IDs can be complex. The
basic approaches we use for establishing a relationship are as follows: (i) use
database cross—references from well—curated databases, such as UniProtKB,
which includes cross—references in each protein entry. Most of the cross—
references in UniProtKB are actively maintained via collaborations between
UniProt and the cross—referenced databases to ensure quality. (ii) Use other
database IDs as a bridge (transitive mappings). For example, one can use
a GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession referenced by UniProtKB and also by
an NCBI GI number to make a correspondence. (iii) Use sequence identity
to establish the relationship between two database IDs. Usually, a 100%
sequence identity for the same taxon is required for our mapping.

The system is built upon the iProClass protein—centric data warehouse.
IDs are mapped to UniProtKB or UniParc accession numbers using the
approaches outlined above. Database tables are built for storing the ID
mapping data and Apache Lucene indexes are generated for database search
and retrieval. We have two implementations for the public: the ID mapping
services on the UniProt web site (Jain et al., 2009) and on the PIR web
site (proteininformationresource.org). The system design is illustrated in
Figure 1. We currently update our data warehouse and the ID mapping
database every 4 weeks in conjunction with UniProtKB.

3 RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

In December 2010, there were over 125 million IDs mapped to
over 14 million UniProtKB and UniParc protein accessions. The set

can produce a very much larger combinatorial network of IDs pairs
using UniProt accessions as a bridge. The mapping services currently
support 90 types of IDs. All numbers will continue to grow.
Web-based ID mapping: this is available from both the UniProt
and PIR web sites at http://uniprot.org/mapping and http://
proteininformationresource.org/pirwww/search/idmapping.shtml,
respectively. The two sites draw from identical mapping tables and
provide batch mappings. The UniProt site provides UniProtKB
centric mapping (i.e. one of the pairs must be a UniProt accession),
while the PIR site allows transitive mappings between all IDs
bridged by UniProtKB. For details on the options and output
formats available, see the online help at each web site.
Programmatic access: this is provided on the UniProt web site
via a REST style web service, for help and example code see
http://www.uniprot.org/faq/28. On the PIR web site, help is at http://
proteininformationresource.org/cgi—bin/idmapping_http_client.
FTP downloads: FTP downloads of ID mapping tables
are available from ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_
release/knowledgebase/idmapping. The FTP directory contains two
ID mapping data ﬁles, the idmapping.dat ﬁle with tab—delimited
columns for: UniProtKB accession, ID type and ID and an
idmapping_selected.tab ﬁle contains IDs that are most often
requested by users. See the README ﬁle for more information.
The ID mapping services have been used extensively since 2006.
The FTP ﬁles are downloaded on average 15 000 times a year from
about 4500 unique IP addresses a year. Analysis of web usage shows
897 000 uses during the last year, an average of 74 700 a month. User
logs suggest that most users are mapping small sets of accession/ID
(including single proteins) to UniProtKB. A lesser number of power
users map thousands at a time or download from the FTP site.
Currently, the most popular mapping pair is from Entrez Gene ID to

UniProtKB accession. In addition, other sites including NCBI and
a few other ID mapping services redistribute these mappings from
their sites and services.

The main strengths of our services compared to others are as
follows: a large number of IDs are supported; all organisms are
supported; frequent updates; mappings are available for download
and well as from the web site; and, we interact directly with data
provided through the UniProt consortium to ensure accuracy.

Selected published examples of use cases for the service include
mapping of NCBI GI numbers to UniProtKB accession/IDs and
ﬁnally to GO terms to identify functionally linked proteins (Cokus
et al., 2007); functional mapping of mass spectrometry data to
pathways (Park et al., 2008) and integration of omics data for
pathogen—host interactions (McGarvey et al., 2009).

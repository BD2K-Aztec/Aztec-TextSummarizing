ABSTRACT

In the past years, there has been a growing interest in methods that
incorporate network information into classification algorithms for bio-
marker signature discovery in personalized medicine. The general
hope is that this way the typical low reproducibility of signatures,
together with the difficulty to link them to biological knowledge, can
be addressed. Complementary to these efforts, there is an increasing
interest in integrating different data entities (e.g. gene and miRNA ex-
pressions) into comprehensive models. To our knowledge, R-package
netClass is the first software that addresses both, network and data
integration. Besides several published approaches for network inte-
gration, it specifically contains our recently published stSVM method,
which allows for additional integration of gene and miRNA expression
data into one predictive classifier.

Availability: netClass is available on http://sourceforge.net/p/
netclassr and CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org).

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the major goals of personalized medicine is to identify
molecular biomarkers that reliably predict a patient’s response to
therapy to avoid ineffective treatment and to reduce drug side
effects and associated costs. For that purpose, prognostic and
diagnostic biomarker signatures have been derived from omics
data in numerous publications for various disease entities.

To construct biomarker signatures typically machine learning
algorithms are used, such as SVMs (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995)
and RandomForests (Breiman, 2001). The challenge is the ex-
treme high dimensionality of omics data coupled with a relatively
small sample size, which imposes a major need for careful feature
selection. However, during the past years it has become more
and more clear that classical feature selection methods, such as
t-test based ﬁltering, frequently lead to signatures that are neither
reproducible on a different dataset (Ein-Dor et al., 2005) nor
biologically interpretable (Gonen, 2009). Hence, there has been
a growing interest to incorporate prior information on protein—
protein interactions, pathways or Gene Ontology annotation
into feature selection algorithms (see Cun and Frohlich, 2012a
for an extensive review). It has been shown that such approaches

can at least increase the feature selection stability and facilitate
the biological interpretation of signatures (Cun and Frohlich,
2012b).

In this article, we present our R-package netClass, which im-
plements ﬁve network-based gene selection methods. Although
there is a rich literature on general data integration, netClass is,
to our knowledge, the ﬁrst software that allows for integrating
miRNA and mRNA expression data together with protein—
protein interactions and miRNA-target gene information (Cun
and Frohlich, 2013) into one predictive model. netClass thus
complements the functionality of our earlier software package
pathClass (Johannes et al., 2011). It is worth emphasizing that
netClass focuses on classiﬁcation algorithms only. A software
package that is more tailored to Cox regression is CoxBoost
(Binder and Schumacher, 2009).

2 PACKAGE OVERVIEW

netClass currently implements ﬁve network-based gene selection methods,
which have turned out to be successful in the literature: (i) Average ex-
pression proﬁle of pathways (Guo et al., 2005); (ii) Pathway activity
classiﬁcation (Lee et al., 2008); (iii) Classiﬁcation based on differential
expression of hub genes and correlated partners (Taylor et al., 2009); (iv)
Filtering of genes according to a modiﬁed Google PageRank algorithm
Winter at al., 2012); (V) Kernel-based smoothing of t-statistics over a
network structure (Cun and Frohlich, 2013). Speciﬁcally, the latter ap-
proach also allows for integrating miRNA and mRNA expression data.
Neither of the ﬁve above-mentioned methods has been implemented in
pathClass, which mainly focuses on the SVM-RFE algorithm and vari-
ants thereof (Johannes et al., 2010). Hence, netClass and pathClass com-
plement each other.

Pathway activity classiﬁcation is the only non-SVM based classiﬁca-
tion approach in netClass: it uses logistic regression (Lee et al., 2008). All
the other algorithms internally use (linear) SVM classiﬁcation. netClass
enables to tune the soft margin parameter automatically in a computa-
tionally efﬁcient manner using the span rule, which provides a theoretical
upper bound on the leave-one-out cross-validation error and can be cal-
culated from training data only (Chapelle and Vapnik, 1999).
Furthermore, to evaluate the prediction performance of classiﬁcation al-
gorithms, in netClass feature selection and soft margin parameter tuning
are embedded into a repeated k-fold cross-validation scheme. Cross-val-
idation can be performed Via user-friendly interface functions and allows
for parallel computing.

2.1 Data and network integration via kernel-based
smoothing of t-statistics

A speciﬁc feature of netClass is the implementation of our recently
proposed stSVM algorithm, which allows for joint integration of network
information, together with miRNA and mRNA expression data

Model training

Fig. 1. Workﬁow of stSVM: Marginal statistics for features in each
-omics dataset are computed and smoothed over the structure of a
joined miRNA-PPI network. After re-ranking, a permutation test selects
the most relevant features and trains an SVM model. The obtained sig-
nature can be visualized as a network

(Cun and Frohlich, 2013). The basic idea behind stSVM is to smooth a
feature-wise marginal statistic (like the commonly used t-statistic) over
the structure of a joint protein—protein and miRNA-target gene inter-
action graph. For this purpose, a random walk kernel is used (Gao
et al., 2009). A permutation test is used to select features in a highly
consistent manner, and then these features are used for subsequent
SVM training. In our article, we demonstrated the utility of this approach
on four datasets from different tumor entities and speciﬁcally showed
that integration of miRNA and mRNA expression could enhance the
prediction power for prostate cancer prognosis (Cun and Frohlich, 2013).

2.2 Integration of igraph

netClass facilitates the post hoc analysis of obtained feature sets by inte-
grating the R-package igraph (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006). Algorithms
incorporating network structures return the connected sub-graphs be-
tween selected features. This enables the full functionality of graph algo-
rithms and plotting routines (Fig. 1). In this context, speciﬁcally Steiner
tree methods, as e.g. implemented in our package SteinerNet, may pro-
vide a useful additional tool (Sadeghi and Frohlich, 2013).

2.3 Example usage

To illustrate the use of netClass, we show an example for running stSVM
on a small sample dataset. First, we get the sample data expr with gene
expression matrix genes, miRNA expression matrix miRNA and class
labels y. The adjacency matrix for the network is given in admatrix.
We then train stSVM on the whole dataset and plot the sub-graph
induced by selected features:

>library(netClass)

>data(expr)

>data(ENZSY)

>data(ad.matrix)
>dk<—calc.diffusionKernelp(L:ad.matrix,p=2,a=l)
>st=train.stsvm(x=cbind(expr$genes,expr$miRNA),
y=expr$y,Gsub=ad.matrix,dk=dk,ENZSYzENZSY)
>plot(st$trained$graph)

3 CONCLUSION

netClass is an R-package that allows for network and data inte-
gration for biomarker signature discovery. It includes several
published approaches for incorporating network information
into gene selection. Moreover, netClass contains our recently
published stSVM algorithm, which allows for additional integra-
tion of miRNA and mRNA expression data. All implemented
methods can perform repeated cross-validation to estimate the
prediction performance. Moreover, integration of igraph facili-
tates the follow-up analysis of selected features via graph algo-
rithms and plotting functions. In summary, we believe that
netClass provides a useful tool for biomarker signature discovery
in personalized medicine.

Abstract

Motivation: With the booming of interactome studies, a lot of interactions can be measured in a
high throughput way and large scale datasets are available. It is becoming apparent that many dif—
ferent types of interactions can be potential drug targets. Compared with inhibition of a single pro—
tein, inhibition of protein—protein interaction (PPI) is promising to improve the specificity with fewer
adverse side—effects. Also it greatly broadens the drug target search space, which makes the drug
target discovery difficult. Computational methods are highly desired to efficiently provide candi—
dates for further experiments and hold the promise to greatly accelerate the discovery of novel
drug targets.

Results: Here, we propose a machine learning method to predict PPI targets in a genomic—wide
scale. Specifically, we develop a computational method, named as PrePPltar, to Predict PPIs as
drug targets by uncovering the potential associations between drugs and PPls. First, we survey the
databases and manually construct a gold—standard positive dataset for drug and PPI interactions.
This effort leads to a dataset with 227 associations among 63 PPIs and 113 FDA—approved drugs
and allows us to build models to learn the association rules from the data. Second, we characterize
drugs by profiling in chemical structure, drug ATC—code annotation, and side—effect space and rep—
resent PPI similarity by a symmetrical S—kernel based on protein amino acid sequence. Then the
drugs and PPIs are correlated by Kronecker product kernel. Finally, a support vector machine
(SVM), is trained to predict novel associations between drugs and PPls. We validate our PrePPltar
method on the well—established gold—standard dataset by cross—validation. We find that all chemical
structure, drug ATC—code, and side—effect information are predictive for PPI target. Moreover, we
can increase the PPI target prediction coverage by integrating multiple data sources. Follow—up
database search and pathway analysis indicate that our new predictions are worthy of future ex—
perimental validation.

Conclusion: In conclusion, PrePPltar can serve as a useful tool for PPI target discovery and provides
a general heterogeneous data integrative framework.

Computational probing protein—protein interactions targeting small molecules 227

 

1 Introduction

Systems biology emphasizes to understand the complex biological
systems from interactions beyond the single molecules. This para—
digm shift pushes the generations of large sets of interactions called
interactome. One typical example is to measure protein—protein
interaction by yeast—two—hybrid and mass spectrometry. Protein—
protein interactions (PPIs) are building blocks for the majority of bio—
logical processes in the living cell. Beyond the single protein, they are
natural to serves as the basic elements to be perturbed by drugs in the
treatment, cure, prevention, or diagnosis of disease. Indeed, targeting
PPIs with small molecular inhibitors is of increasing interests both in
academia as well as in the pharmaceutical industry (Arkin and Wells,
2004). Many different types of interactions can be inhibited using
drug-like small molecules (Archakov et 61]., 2003; Pawson and Nash,
2003; Wells and McClendon, 2007). Searching potential drug PPI
targets can serve both therapeutic purpose and useful chemical tool
for basic science (Valkov et 61]., 2012). Compared with inhibition of a
single protein, inhibition of PPIs is promising to broaden the drug tar—
get search space. Moreover, drugs targeting such interactions are
more specific and likely to act with fewer side—effects than conven—
tional medication inﬂuencing whole cell functions (Klussmann and
Scott, 2008). However, it’s challenging to find PPI target by wet ex-
periment since it suffers from the dynamics of PPIs and the particular
problem of more exposed and less defined binding sites (Valkov et
61]., 2012). Computational methods are then highly desired to provide
candidates for further experimental verification and then accelerate
the mapping of PPI targets on a large scale.

The initial challenge is the discovery of specific PPIs and in turn
identification of those molecules that are ‘druggable’ (White et a],
2008). To address this issue, computational techniques were de—
veloped to identify small molecules as PPI inhibitors through a ra-
tionalization of the PPI inhibitor chemical space (Arnout et 61].,
2013; Neugebauer et 61]., 2007; Reynes et 61]., 2010; Villoutreix,
2014) and the design of PPI—focused compound libraries (Basse
et 61]., 2013; Hamon et 61]., 2013; Labbe et 61]., 2013), which de—
posited the structures of PPIs as protein complexes and their ligands.
Following the identification of a suitable PPI, the next step involves
study of the binding interface and ligand design. Within a binding
interface, only a small number of highly conserved amino acid resi—
dues: ‘hot spots’, are crucial for the interaction. Thus the key prob-
lem in PPI inhibitors discovery becomes looking for the location of
‘hot spots’ from large surface area of the PPI interface. Previous
work mainly focused on fragment—based methods, which attempted
to discover the compounds that are druggable and ligandable by
matching three—dimensional structure of molecules with the surface
area of PPI interface (Valkov et 61]., 2012). Structure information is
required in fragment—based methods, however, only a small fraction
of proteins have well—established structures, thus this class of meth—
ods is restricted in small—scale.

With the rapid development of high—throughput experimental
methodologies, genome—wide PPIs in some model organisms, includ-
ing Escherichia coli (Butland et 61]., 2005), Helicobacter pylori (Rain
et 61]., 2001), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Gavin, 2002; Uetz et 61].,
2000; Ito et 61]., 2001), Caenorhabditis elegans (Li, 2004),
Drosop/oila melanogaster (Giot et 61]., 2003), and Homo sapiens
(Stelzl et 61]., 2005; Rual, 2005), have been established. Meanwhile,
some curated databases deposit high quality drug targets data,
including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG),
Biomolecular Relations in Information Transmission and
Expression (BRITE) (Kanehisa et al., 2006), BRENDA (Schomburg
et 61]., 2004), SuperTarget (Gunther et 61]., 2008), and DrugBank

(Wishart et 61]., 2008). These valuable information sources together
provide a great opportunity to understand the mechanism of PPI tar-
gets from the viewpoint of interactome. That is, drug—PPI associ—
ations could be constructed based on genome—wide PPIs and high
quality drug targets data. Most importantly, the understandable
rules for drug—PPI associations can be learned by a statistical pre—
dictor based on these associations.

Here, we develop a machine learning framework to Predict PPIs
targets (PrePPItar) by dissecting the drug—PPI associations in a large—
scale manner. We observed that the current available data sources
describe drug’s biological function in living cell from different levels
and different aspects. For example, drug’s chemical structure pro—
vides information by the ‘structure determines function’ paradigm.
ATC—code annotation provides the therapeutic effect at molecular
level, and side—effect hints the unwanted effect at phenotype level.
One straightforward assumption is that drugs similar in one or more
data source metrics will interact with similar PPIs. We demonstrate
that drugs with similar chemical structures, ATC—codes, or side—
effects indeed associate with similar PPIs. Then we propose the idea
to integrate heterogeneous chemical structure, ATC—code, and side—
effect information sources. Specifically, drug and PPI are first char-
acterized by their similarity—based profiles, and a kernel function is
then defined to correlate them. Finally, the potential drug—PPI asso—
ciations are inferred by training a machine learning model, i.e. sup—
port vector machines (SVM), which is motivated by statistical
learning theory (Vapnik, 1995, 1998) and has been successful on
many different classification problems in bioinformatics (Schélkopf
et 61]., 2004). PrePPItar overcomes the main difficulty to integrate
these data sources from structure, ATC classification, and side—effect
level, which are highly heterogenous.

To make the learning feasible and validate PrePPItar by cross
validation, we construct a well—established dataset from scratch. In
total, 227 associations among 63 PPIs and 113 FDA—approved drugs
are collected from HPRD (Prasad et 61]., 2009) and DrugBank
(Wishart et 61]., 2008). We find that all chemical structure, ATC—code
annotation, and side—effect information are predictive in different
ways. Moreover, drug—PPI associations can be uncovered by combin—
ation of these three properties. In addition, database search and path—
way analysis indicate that our new predictions are worthy of future
experimental validation. Compared with single protein target predic—
tion, PPI target prediction can discover some dissimilar targets, that
is, it is promising to broaden the drug target search space.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Methods

We propose a novel algorithm, PrePPItar, to predict PPI targets by
identifying the potential associations between drugs and PPIs based
on kernel fusion of heterogenous data sources. The schematic illus—
tration of PrePPItar is shown in Figure 1A. The functional role of
drug is characterized by its molecular structure, molecular function,
and phenotype data. PrePPItar aims to optimally integrate those
three data sources and connect drug with PPI more accurately.

The PPI target prediction problem is converted into an inter—
action prediction problem: determining whether a give pair of
drug—PPI is associated or not. We introduce SVM—based algorithm
to cope with this prediction task. The algorithm works in three
phases (Fig. 1): (B) Collecting known drug targeting PPIs as gold—
standard positives in a bipartite graph. (C) Modelling drug—drug and
PPI-PPI similarity metrics. Drug similarity is derived from chemical
structures, ATC—codes, and side—effects. PPI similarity is calculated

similarity among PPIs by Kronecker product kernel, and applying

tion and standard training dataset are needed.

Given two drug—PPI pairs, we consider to construct a kernel
function which potentially correlates with their similarity. Since the
kernel function represents the similarities among the training sam-
ples in some sense (Hofmann et al., 2008), we put more efforts on
the similarity among drugs and similarity among PPIs rather than on
the representing profiles for drugs and PPIs.

2.2 Drug similarity

The chemical structures, drug ATC—codes, and side—effects are used
to represent the similarity among drugs, respectively. SC is con—
structed to represent drug chemical structure similarity. Each row (or
column) of this matrix is the chemical structure similarity profile for
a single drug, where the chemical structure similarity between two
drugs d and d’ is computed by a graph—based method for comparing
pairwise chemical structures, SIMilar COMPound (SIMCOMP)
(Hattori et al., 2003), which is widely used in single protein target
prediction (Yamanishi et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010, 2011).

S A is utilized to denote the drug therapeutic similarity matrix.
Each row (or column) of this matrix is the therapeutic similarity
profile for a single drug, where the ATC—code based similarity be—
tween drugs d and d’ is calculated as following:

SA(d, d’) : ti€T(I;)1:)€<T(d/)sim(ti, ti), (1)
where T(d) and T(d’) are the sets of ATC—code annotations
of corresponding drugs. The similarity between two ATC—codes
(t,- and t,) is calculated by the equation of sim(t,-, ti) :
w(t,-)w(t,-)exp(—yd(t,-, ti», where d(t,-, ti) is the shortest distance be—
tween two ATC—codes t,- and t,- in the hierarchical structure of the

ATC classification system. w(t,-) and w(t,-) represent the weights of
the corresponding ATC—codes, and are defined as the inverse of
ATC—code frequencies, which means that more emphasis was put on
the specific codes rather than the general ones (Yamanishi et al.,
2010). y is a predefined parameter (set to be 0.25 in this study).

The matrix SE is applied to represent the drug similarity matrix
under their side—effect measurement. Each row (or column) is the
side—effect based similarity profile for a single drug. The drug simi-
larity under their side—effects measurement is defined as the weighted

defined as wk : exp(—fk2/0'2/o2), where fk is the frequency of the lath
side—effect in the data, and M is the total number of side—effects, 0' is
the standard derivation of {fk}24:1, and la is a constant (set to 10 in
this study).

2.3 PPI similarity

Similar to drug similarity profiles, we also apply similarity profile to
represent PPIs. We notice the fact that PPI is symmetrical, i.e. the
similarity between PPIs is independent to their proteins’ order.
Therefore, a symmetrical S—kernel function, which was used in
human PPI prediction (Shen et al., 2007), is introduced here to meas—
ure PPIs’ similarity. Specifically, the similarity between PP11 and
PPIZ is calculated by the following:

tion in Matlab Bioinformatics toolbox. The matrix SPPI is then

utilized to represent the PPI similarity. Each row (or column) is the
similarity profile for a single PPI.

2.4 The kernel function and drug—PPI association
prediction

With the representation of drugs and PPIs by their similarity profiles,
the kernel function with drug—PPI pairs can be calculated as
Kronecker product kernel (Basilico and Hofmann, 2004; Ben-Hur
and Noble, 2005 ; Hue and Vert, 2010; Oyama and Manning, 2004):

Kdrug—PPI = Sdrug ® SPPI: (3)

where Sdmg can be any one of SC, S A and SE or their combination. In
this paper, ‘chem’ denotes the case when Sdmg : SC, ‘ATC—code’ de—
notes the case when Sdmg: S A, ‘side—effect’ denotes the case when
Sdmg: SE, and ‘comb’ denotes the case when Sdmg : max(Sc, S A, SE),
which means drug similar in one or more than one metrics will target
similar PPIs. Taken together, the rationale behind our kernel function
construction scheme for drug—PPI pairs is that two drug—PPI pairs are
similar only when the corresponding compounds and PPIs are simultan—
eously similar supported by different lines of evidences.

With the above kernel function construction scheme, the PPI tar-
get prediction task is ready to be formalized as a binary classifica—
tion problem with the kernel function feeding to SVM. As the kernel
function (3) is feeded to the SVM learning scheme, the predictor can
be calculated by the equation of f (x) : sgn(Z,l-:1 ocfyinmg_ppI(x,-, x)
—I—b*), where oc* is the solution of the following optimization

and b* can be obtained as follows. If there exists or;k E (0, C),
j: 1, - - - , I, then b* : yl- — Ell-:1 yiochdmg_ppI(x,-,xi). Here x repre—
sent a given drug-PPI pair.

If we treat the drug—PPI pairs with associations publicly available
as the positives and the others as the negatives, the training data im-
balance problem will arise. Because there are only a relatively small
number of known drug—PPI associations. This situation will make
the SVM ineffective in determining the class boundary (Wu and
Chang, 2003). To maintain a balance between training positives and
negatives in SVM training procedure, we randomly select a negative
dataset from the unlabeled data (unknown drug—PPI pairs) to make
sure that it has the same size with the training positive dataset.

3 Results
3.1 Gold—standard drug—PPI network

Here, we aims to discover novel associations between drugs and
PPIs from the data. To this end, we first prepare high quality drug—
PPI associations as gold—standard dataset, which can be used to train
the model and to validate the performance of the prediction algo—
rithms as a community standard. Specifically, we collect protein tar—
gets from DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2008), which contains 5 394
drug—target interactions for 1417 FDA—approved small molecule
compounds. Then we map protein targets which interact with the
same drugs into human PPI networks from HPRD (Prasad et a],
2009). Finally, by keeping the PPIs associated with the same drug,
we got a drug—PPI association network with 227 associations among
63 PPIs and 113 FDA—approved drugs (Supplementary Fig. 82A).
The procedure to generate above drug—PPI association network is
shown in Figure 2A. An example of PPI target for Dasatinib is
drawn in Figure 2B, it shows PPI: P06239—P10721 as target of
Dasatinib, due to that protein P06239 and P10721 are in the same
complex: 3D7T (Krysta et al., 1998). The histogram of drugs with re—
spect to their PPI targets, and the histogram of PPI targets with respect
to their interacting drugs are shown in Figure 2C and D, respectively.
Figure 2C shows that, most drugs target only a few PPIs, but some
have many PPI targets. For example: Muromonab has 8 PPI targets
while most PPIs just interact with a few number of drugs (Fig. 2D).
The most—targeted PPIs are P35 348—P35 368, P28221—P28222,
P35 348—P25100 and P12314—P08637. Comparing with other targets

associated with the same drug, PPI targets have higher sequence simi-
larity (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Furthermore 33 PPIs participate in
the same IPA canonical pathway (Supplementary Table S5 ).

We also analyze the existing drug—protein network to see what
kind of drugs prefer to target a PPI. Supplementary Fig. 81A and
81B show that, drugs can be divided into two types based on the dis—
tance among their interacting proteins in PPI network: Type I drugs
tend to target PPI or protein cluster (small average distance of
proteins in PPI network) and Type II drugs tend to associate with
isolated protein targets. Although a lots of drugs have more than
two protein targets, only a small fraction of them which have higher
molecular weight and exact mass prefer to bind PPI (Supplementary
Table S1). That is, Type I drugs belong to minor population, and
PPI targets are only a small fraction of drug protein targets
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). This result implies that proteins interact—
ing with the same small molecules tend to have different functions.
Just like that the primary target (on—target) results in a therapeutic
benefit to the patient, additional target (off—target) may lead to un—
desirable side effects. Although they interact with the same drug,
their functions are different.

3.2 Benchmark datasets and SVM implementation

The lists of the above gold—standard dataset are shown in
Supplementary Tables 84—86. It serves as the benchmark dataset to
validate the performance of PrePPItar. It includes 227 drug—PPI asso—
ciations among 63 PPIs with annotations in HPRD, PDB complex
and IPA canonical pathway (Supplementary Table S5) and 113
FDA-approved drugs with their ATC—codes and associated diseases
(Supplementary Table S6). Drug targets and target sequences are ex—
tracted from DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2008). ATC—codes are ex—
tracted from KEGG BRITE (Kanehisa et al., 2006) and DrugBank
(Wishart et al., 2008). Drug side—effects are extracted from SIDER
(Kuhn et al., 2010).

We train the SVM—based predictor by using LibSVM (Chang
and Lin, 2011). In our implementation, the penalty parameter C is
optimized by a grid search approach with 3—fold cross—validation,
and the optimal value of C is 1. To evaluate the performance of
our methods, 10—fold cross—validation is introduced. The perform-
ance of our proposed method is shown by receiver operating char—
acteristic (ROC) curve (Gribskov and Robinson, 1996), which
shows the trade—off between the true positive (correctly predicted
associations) rate (TPR) with respect to the false positive (wrongly
predicted associations) rate (FPR). Furthermore, considering the
complementary role of AUPR (area under precision—recall curve) to
AUC in performance evaluation, AUPR is also used to evaluate

the performance of PrePPItar. The evaluation criteria used to as—
sess the performance of PrePPItar are shown in Supplementary
Table S2.

3.3 Correlation analysis shows chemical structure,
drug—target interactions and side—effects are all
predictive

Our prediction algorithm is based on the assumption that drugs
similar in some metrics will have the same PPI target. First, we valid—
ate whether this assumption works or not. Here, chemical structure,
ATC—code annotation, and side—effect are utilized to measure drugs’
similarity. Thus we check if each similar measurement correlates
with PPI similarity, that is drugs with similar structures (ATC—code
annotations or side—effects) will target similar PPIs. To this end, we
correlate chemical structure, ATC—code annotation, and drug side—
effect similarity with PPI similarity, respectively. Pearson’s correl—
ation coefficients (PCCs) between drugs similarity in chemical struc—
tures, ATC—code annotations, and side—effects metrics and PPI
similarity are shown in Figure 3A. It shows that all three PCCs are
larger than 0.3, and PCC between PPI similarity and chemical struc—
ture similarity goes beyond 0.5. Moreover, the P—values are less than
1e — 16 for all three PCCs. All these results suggest that PPI similar—
ity relates with chemical structures, ATC—code annotations, and
side—effects. Furthermore, it correlates more with chemical structure
similarity. That may come from the fact that chemical structure de—
scribes the basic feature of compound. PPI target depends on the
structure of binding interface between small molecular and ligand.
Thus chemical structure provides direct and more information in
identification of PPI target. Scatter plot relating drug structure,
ATC—code annotation and side—effect similarity with PPI similarity
(Supplementary Fig. S3) also indicates that drugs similar in either
structure, ATC—code, or side—effect measurement have similar PPI
targets. Moreover, PPI similarity is more correlated with drug chem-
ical structure similarity.

3.4 PPI target prediction by PrePPltar

We firstly validate the performance of each single data source in PPI
target prediction. The effects of chemical structure, ATC—code, and
side—effect similarity in uncovering the observed drug—PPI associ—
ations are shown by replacing the drug similarity matrix Sdmg in ker-
nel function (3) with SC, S A, and SE, respectively. The ROCs on each
data source’s effect are displayed in Supplementary Figure S4. The
figure shows that, for all the three data sources, ROC curves are be—
yond the diagonal (random classification) and close to the 0—1 base—
line. Since we are more interested in the performance of these

methods when FPR is rather small, we also draw ROC curves with
FPR less than 0.02 in Figure 3B. It shows that, ‘side—effect’ obtains
the highest TPR when FPR is very small, and with the number of
known associations increasing, ‘chem’ reveals more observed drug—
PPI associations.

The evaluation criteria obtained by PrePPItar are listed in
Table 1 when the corresponding F—measure reaches its maximum.
From Table 1, we can see that, ‘chem’ and ‘ATC—code’ achieve com—
parable prediction performance, ‘side—effect’ performs the worst. It
means that chemical structure and ATC—code annotation are import—
ant to identify observed drug—PPI associations. What’s more, ‘chem’
obtains over 0.90 AUC and over 0.85 sensitivity, ‘ATC—code’ ob—
tains the best sensitivity of 0.835, and ‘side—effect’ obtains the AUC
of 0.87, and make accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and F—measure
over 0.85. All these results suggest that, each such data source will
do one’s bit in inferring the potential rules from the existing drug—
PPI associations. Therefore, combination of these three data sources
should produce a much more sophisticated picture of the associ—
ations among drugs and PPIs.

Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure S4 show that, ‘comb’ not
only obtains the best ROC curves, but also achieves the high TPR
when FPR is less than 0.02. That is, ‘comb’ can achieve better per—
formance when predicting a small fraction of known drug—PPI asso—
ciations. In addition, Table 1 shows that ‘comb’ performs better
than using single data source. For example, ‘chem’ and ‘side—effect’
make the AUPR 0.917 and 0.906, respectively, while ‘comb’ obtains
an AUPR 0.936. ‘chem’ and ‘ATC—code’ obtain the accuracy 0.85
and 0.86, respectively, while ‘comb’ obtains an accuracy 0.87,
which has one percent improvement. These facts demonstrate that
all three data sources are very useful in prediction. Combination of
them significantly improves the accuracy of drug—PPI association
identification.

3.5 Comparison with PPI inhibitors and single protein
target prediction

Previous work discovered PPI inhibitors by constructing a universal
classifier to distinguish drug-like PPI inhibitors from Chemical
Libraries. Only chemical properties were used. For example, many
studies applied computational method to discover the candidate
small molecules binding protein complex based on drug’s chemical
properties (Arnout et al., 2013; Neugebauer et al., 2007; Reynes
et al., 2010; Villoutreix, 2014). While here, we integrated drug
chemical structure, phenotype information and protein genomic se—
quence information to uncover the associations between drugs and
physically interacted PPIs. We put more focus on associations be—
tween drugs and PPIs, not only included compound information,
but also included the protein information. While previous work
identified the specific small molecules used as PPI inhibitors based
only on drug’s chemical properties. This makes the number of
studied PPIs is very limited. Instead, we address the issue of drug—PPI
associations by extracting information both from drug and PPI sides.
Furthermore, we extend the protein complex data to physical inter—
action data by high throughput experiment. This greatly increased
the prediction coverage.

Compared with single target prediction, PrePPItar takes PPI as
an basic unit of drug target. By using S—kernel to define the similarity
between PPIs, PrePPItar can uncover those protein targets, which
have less similarity to a known protein target. This is feasible be—
cause S—kernel measures similarity between PPIs as the maximum
similarities between proteins involving corresponding PPIs. Take
drug NADH (DrugBank: DB00157) as an example (Fig. 4A), the
candidate interaction DB00157—O43837 will be missed by single
target methods, due to that the similarity between candidate target
043837 and known target P5 0213 is only 0.392. However, it can
be uncovered by direct PPI target method, because of the fact that
candidate PPI: O43837—P51553 is similar to known PPI target:
P5 0213—P5 155 3 (with 0.835 similarity). In addition, DrugBank in-
dicates the target role of 043837 for NADH. Besides that, 043837
and P50213 share many GO annotations, including tricarboxylic
acid cycle in biological process phase, mitochondrial matrix in cellu-
lar component phase, NAD binding, isocitrate dehydrogenase
(NAD—I—) activity and magnesium ion binding in molecular function
phase. That is, 043837 and P5 0213 may work together to perform
the same molecular function, such as inhibition by the same drug.

Although side—by—side comparison of drug—PPI prediction and
drug—target is difficult, we still design some experiments to systemat—
ically compare the proposed approach with three state—of—the—art
methods for predicting drug targets (Yamanishi et al., 2010, 2012,

Fig. 4 (A) The example shows the promising advantage of inhibition of PPI target. Due to candidate target 043837 has low similarity to known target P50213, the
relationship between drug C00004 (NAHD) and protein target 043837 will be missed by prediction of single protein target, but can be discovered by prediction of
direct PPI target method with high similarity to known PPI target: P50213—P51553. (B) The relationship between drug D03658 (Dasatinib) and PPI
(NP_002180.1(013261)-NP_000869.1(P14784)). Co-pathway relationship between drug Dasatinib and protein NP_002180.1, and functional analysis indicate that
drug D03658 (Dasatinib) will associate with PPI (NP_002180.1-NP_000869.1) with high probability

2014). Firstly, we compare three state—of—the—art methods in web
service DINIES (Drug—target Interaction Network Inference Engine
based on Supervised Analysis) with our method. DINIES is a re-
cently constructed web server for predicting unknown drug—target
interaction networks from various types of biological data (e.g.
chemical structures, drug side effects, amino acid sequences and pro—
tein domains) in the framework of supervised network inference
(Yamanishi et al., 2014). We first submitted our manually curated
drug—PPI dataset to DINIES by taking PPI as the drug target. The re—
sults showed that our method outperformed the three methods by
higher sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Then we decomposed our
gold—standard drug—PPI network into the drug—protein network by
separating PPIs into individual proteins. We ran DINIES on this
drug—protein network by integrating drug chemical structure, ATC—
code, side—effect data and protein sequence data. We found that our
method can greatly increase the coverage of PPI target compared
with the three methods. Finally we compiled the example dataset
provided by DINIES as a new drug—PPI dataset. The co—pathway in—
formation provided by KEGG database is used to approximate PPI.
This leads to a drug—PPI network with 1 985 interactions among 53
drugs and 292 co—pathway PPIs (Supplementary Table S7). Our
method achieved an AUC of 0.937 by 10—fold cross—validation and
outperformed the three methods in DINIES on this dataset. We
checked one example that DINIES failed to predict while our
method can predict. The drug—protein pair D00312—has:2099 was
missed by DINIES because has:2099 is dissimilar with known target
of D00312: has:2100 (with 0.37 sequence similarity, and share three
Pfam domain in all 335 Pfam domains). While it could be uncovered
by our method PrePPItar in prediction D00312—has:2099 has:2100.
The evidence used by PrePPItar is as follows. The co—pathway pro—
tein pair has:2099 has:2100 is similar to known co—pathway protein
pair has:1812 hsa:1813 (with Pfam domain similarity 0.74).
has:1812 hsa:1813 is associated with drug D00059. The drug
D0005 9 is very similar to D00312 (side—effect based similarity be—
tween D00312 and D00059 is 0.85). Therefore D00312—has:2099
has:2100 can be predicted by our PrePPItar in high confidence. The
detailed experiments and the corresponding results are provided in
the Supplementary Material. Taken together, our method could not
only uncover more drug targets comparing with three state—of—the—
art methods for predicting drug targets, but also discover some novel
targets failed by the single protein based drug target prediction.

3.6 Novel predictions

By cross—validation, PrePPItar displays its promising performance in
predicting observed drug—PPI associations. To test whether it can
produce biologically useful predictions, we focus on the unknown
(non-interacting) drug—PPI pairs. We trained ‘comb’ on the gold—
standard drug—PPI associations and randomly selected non—interact—
ing drug-PPI pairs from gold standard drug—PPI network, and tested
it on 4 050 drug-PPI pairs. This comprises the randomly selected 50
PPIs form HPRD (excluding PPIs appearing in gold—standard data—
set) and 81 drugs with known KEGG ID in gold—standard dataset.
Our expectation is that ‘comb’ can discover novel PPI targets for
known drugs.

The top five novel predictions are listed in Table S3. For each
novel prediction, we look for the drug-target form DrugBank
(Wishart et al., 2008), drug treated disease from KEGG BRITE
(Kanehisa et al., 2006), the corresponding disease genes from
OMIM (Hamosh et al., 2002), the pathway information, disease
gene from KEGG BRITE (Kanehisa et al., 2006), and protein cellu—
lar component annotation from Uniprot (http://www.uniprot.org/).

As an example shown in Figure 4B, drug D0365 8 (Dasatinib) is an
oral multi-BCIUABL and Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor
approved for usage in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML). This drug participates in the pathway of hsa04060
(Cytokine—cytokine receptor interaction). Protein NP_002180.1
(Interleukin—15 receptor subunit alpha) has the molecular annota—
tion of cytokine receptor activity and participates in the pathway of
hsa04060 (Fig. 4B). These annotations suggest that NP_002180.1
will be the target of D0365 8 with high probability, and PPI
(NP_002180.1—NP_000869.1) will be served as the target of
D0365 8 with high probability. That is, further experiment should
focus on those PPIs with one of protein sharing the same pathway.

The analysis of the remaining four predictions is presented in the
Supplementary Material. Database search and functional annotation
analysis support these novel predictions. All these results suggest
that PrePPItar can uncover potential PPI targets of drugs and can
provide candidates for further experiments.

4 Discussion and conclusion

In this work, we integrate multiple chemical properties of drugs,
such as chemical information, ATC—code annotation, and the drug
side—effect. We use the maximum among them to obtain good pre—
dictions. However, there are alternative strategies to address the
same issue, such as the multiple kernel learning (MKL), which opti-
mizes the weight to integrate kernels (Francis et al., 2004;
Sonnenburg et al., 2006; Mehmet and Ethem, 2011). MKL is a uni-
fied framework and has elegant model to integrate different data
sources. To compare with MKL, we implemented the alternative op—
timization method. We iteratively obtained optimal weights to inte—
grate kernels and got the optimal decision function. It turns out that
MKL achieved an AUC of 0.795, which is lower than both single
kernel and maximum kernel. One possible reason is that using max—
imum weight can effectively remove redundancy. These comparison
results suggest that our simplified strategy is the better option for
integrating data sources. In addition, MKL will add extra computa—
tional complexity. So in practice, it is better to choose the maximum
strategy to simplify the model and make it available to large—scale
problems.

Here, only PPIs in HPRD are included in our gold—standard data—
set. It results in a relative small benchmark dataset and limits the
usage of this dataset. Therefore, we enlarged the PPI set by introduc—
ing a recently constructed structure—based PPI database, called
PrePPI, which deposits human interactions in databases HPRD,
DIP, IntAct, BioGRID and MINT prior to Aug. 2010. It includes
58 772 interactions among proteins (Zhang et al., 2013; Zhang QC
et al., 2013). By selecting the interactions, which correlated with the
same drugs in DrugBank database, we got 576 interactions among
229 FDA-approved drugs and 241 PPIs, which includes 85 of 113
drugs and 25 of 63 PPIs in our gold—standard dataset. We validated
our PrePPItar on this larger dataset and got the AUC of 0.842. This
result further demonstrates the efficiency of PrePPItar by using dif-
ferent gold—standard positive datasets. Another concern about our
golden—standard dataset may lie in the fact that only physically inter-
acted PPIs were included here. That is, we only consider the bio—
active partners. While protein targets for the same drug may be not
just physically interacted. They may have some functional linkage
and participate in the same cellular pathway. We will consider ex—
tending the dataset by including other types of protein linkages in fu-
ture, including the whole protein—family, co—pathway, and genetic
interactions. In addition, PPIs are dynamic in biological processes. It
may vary in different tissues and conditions. Thus extended work

would consider some tissue specific and condition specific data as
features. For example, gene expression data can be easily obtained
in many different situations. And some studies have already demon—
strated that gene expression is important to identify novel drug tar—
gets (Kosaka et al., 2013; Saito, 2005; Shibata et al., 2010).
Therefore, one could use tissue—specific gene expression under drug
different dosage to predict whether a given drug can be used as PPI
target in this specific tissue or not.

The PPI inhibition by drugs database, such as iPPI—DB (http://
www.ippidb.cdithem.fr) and 2P21db (http://2p2idb.cnrs—mrs.fr/), de—
posit the structures of PPIs as protein complexes and their ligands.
The small molecules targeting PPI complex are usually called PPI in-
hibitors. In our gold—standard dataset, the FDA approved drugs in
DrugBank database and their interacting PPIs are included.
Specifically, the PPIs in our gold—standard datasets are those physic—
ally interacted proteins, which interact with the same drug in
DrugBank database. While PPIs in PPI inhibitors database are the
protein complexes, which directly bind a specific small molecule.
Therefore, PPIs in our gold—standard dataset are not limited to those
protein complexes directly binding to a small molecule, but have
some other types of relationships with small molecules, such as sen—
sitivity to drug therapy. Here, we aimed to broaden the PPI targets
searching space, not just focusing on those structurally interacting
PPIs for drugs. This will provide novel candidates for drug
discovery.

We utilized sequence information to characterize the similarity
among PPIs in this work. The experimental results show that se—
quence information is predictive in PPI target prediction. One con—
cern is that protein sequence similarity for a protein pair is too strict
for protein complex. Because two proteins may form the complex
due to complicated reason, such as they are co—expressed and have
some functional linkage (Whisstock and Lesk, 2003; Dobson et al.,
2004). Therefore, we tried to include protein similarities based on
other protein information, such as the Gene Ontology (GO) annota—
tions. We applied the GO annotation linkage as the measurement
for protein similarity. Specifically, we downloaded the human gene
GO annotation from Gene Ontology Consortium, applied R pack—
age named GOSemSim (Yu et al., 2010), which can be used to com—
pute semantic similarity among GO terms, to measure the similarity
among proteins. We then used S—kernel to measure the similarity
among PPIs and finally got the AUC of 0.927 by using maximum
kernel. While sequence—based similarity achieved AUC 0.936 by
‘comb’. This indicates that sequence similarity is widely used not
only because it may be the easiest data source to access, but also be—
cause it could get the competitive results with the other data sources.
However, we did find PPIs with similar function but with dissimilar
amino acid sequence. For example, PPI: P50213—P51553 and PPI:
Q9Y478—Q13131 got similarity 0.85 based on GO annotations, but
got similarity 0.04 based on amino acid sequence similarity.
Although none of P50213 and P51553 is similar to Q9Y478 or
Q13131 in terms of amino acid sequence, P51553 and Q13131
share GO term of GO:0005524, and got similarity 0.601 by running
GOSemSim. This result suggested that, different data sources for
protein might play complementary roles. Therefore the better way
to represent PPI is applying maximum strategy to integrate the mul—
tiple protein data sources. In future, we will extend our work to inte—
grate different data sources for protein in PPI target prediction,
including protein sequence, GO annotation and so on. Another pos—
sible improvement is to use the defined interacting domain in protein
sequence and to make the sequence similarity score more accurate.

In summary, we propose a new computational method,
PrePPItar, to predict PPI targets by inferring novel associations

between drugs and PPIs from a collection of molecular structure,
molecular function and phenotype data. Our main contributions
here are both in proposing the machine learning framework and
integrating the drug and PPI similarity profiles by kernel function to
construct the predictive model. Specifically, we characterize the
drug similarity profiles form chemical structures, ATC—code annota—
tions, and side—effects. We quantify the PPI similarity by S-kernel.
And by casting PPI target prediction into a binary classification
problem, a SVM—based predictor is utilized to uncover unknown re—
lationships between drugs and PPIs. The improvement in the evalu—
ation criteria is obtained by combining chemical structures, ATC—
code annotations, and side—effects. This is shown by the maximum
F—measure on a well—established drug—PPI networks with 227 associ—
ations between 113 drugs and 63 PPIs. Taken together, PrePPItar
can accurately uncover drug—PPI associations with database and lit—
erature evidences. Indeed, the database search and pathway analysis
reveal that our novel predictions are worth future experimental val—
idation. Furthermore, prediction of PPI targets will broaden the
drug target search space. In conclusion, PrePPItar will promote the
further research in drug discovery.

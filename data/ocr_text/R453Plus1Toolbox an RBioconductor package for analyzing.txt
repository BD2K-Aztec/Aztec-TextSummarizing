ABSTRACT

Summary: The R453Plus1Toolbox is an R/Bioconductor package
for the analysis of 454 Sequencing data. Projects generated
with Roche’s data analysis software can be imported into
R allowing advanced and customized analyses within the
R/Bioconductor environment for sequencing data. Several methods
were implemented extending the current functionality of Roche’s
software. These extensions include methods for quality assurance
and annotation of detected variants. Further, a pipeline for
the detection of structural variants, e.g. balanced chromosomal
translocations, is provided.

Availability: The R453Plus1Toolbox is implemented in R and
available at http://www.bioconductor.org/. A vignette outlining typical
workflows is included in the package.

1 INTRODUCTION

Roche 454 Sequencing technology produces hundreds of thousands
of DNA sequences consisting of a few hundred nucleotides
each (Margulies et al., 2005), thereby permitting highly sensitive
detection of molecular mutations. Roche developed the GS FLX
Data Analysis Software that enables researchers to handle the
challenging analysis of the massively parallel sequencing data. The
software implements a variety of standard analysis workﬂows, but
so far an interface to programming languages like R is not available.

Hence, a few specialized pipelines (De Schrijver et al., 2010;
Pandey et al., 2010) for highly customized analyses were developed.
In contrast to these software packages, we present an R package that
expands Roche GS FLX software by offering access to sequencing
results generated by Roche’s software from within R. Based on the
R/Bioconductor infrastructure for sequencing data (Morgan et al.,
2009), several new functions expanding the scope of Roche GS FLX
software were implemented and further user—deﬁned functions can
easily be added. In addition, a pipeline for the detection of structural
variants such as balanced chromosomal translocations or inversions
was implemented, which is a functionality with great utility in the
characterization of complex cancer genomes.

2 AVAILABLE FUNCTIONALITY

Most functions implemented in the toolbox were designed to support
at least one of the following three use cases.

2.1 Analysis of PCR amplicon projects

Roche provides the GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer Application
for the analysis of projects investigating massively parallel data
generated from speciﬁcally designed polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) products (Kohlmann et al., 2010). Properly conﬁgured
projects can be read in and are represented as objects of class
AVASet. This class facilitates to store different information about a
project, such as sample information, reference sequences, amplicon
coverage, detected variants, etc. coherently in one object. Based
on this data structure, several methods were implemented that
complement the functionality of the GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer
Application.

For a successful amplicon sequencing project, it is important
to ensure that a sufﬁcient coverage of all amplicons across all
samples in the experiment was achieved. Plots like Figure 1A or
Supplementary Figure Sl can be generated within the toolbox to

R453Plus 1 Toolbox

 

monitor the coverage of each sample. Similarly, plots showing
the coverage of several samples stratiﬁed by lane, Pico—Titer—Plate,
amplicon or multiplexer sequence can be generated. Integrated in a
HTML—based quality report, these ﬁgures are helpful to control and
monitor in—depth and high—throughput data quality in a routine set—up
with many samples processed per run. For instance, we detected an
inﬂuence of certain multiplexer sequences on the achieved coverage
(Grossmann et al., 2011a).

Comprehensive genomic annotation is important for the
interpretation of detected variants. Given an amplicon sequencing
project, the R453Plus1Toolbox allows to query the Ensembl
database and to fetch and summarize all relevant information in
a HTML report. For each mutation within a gene, as represented in
the Variants Frequency Table of the GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer
Application, the report shows the position (exon, intron, untranslated
region) and potential amino acid changes with respect to each known
transcript. Also, all detected variants are searched in the Ensembl
variation database and linked to the corresponding entry if it exists.

Detected variants can be visualized by different plots. For
example, all coding variants of one gene can be plotted at their
position alongside a schematic gene (Supplementary Fig. S2). Single
variants can be plotted showing coverage and percentage of reads
that carry mutations in one plot (Supplementary Fig. S3).

2.2 Analysis of mapping projects

Mapping projects allow the alignment of arbitrary reads from one
or more sequencing runs to a given reference sequence. Mapping
projects analyzed with Roche’s GS Mapper Software can be read
in and are represented by instances of class MapperSet, which is
similar to the AVASet class.

Many of the functionalities for amplicon sequencing projects are
also available for mapping projects. A similar HTML report can
be generated displaying all detected variants together with their
annotation and information about the samples. Also, functions for
visualization of variants can be applied to mapping projects in an
analogue manner. For targeted sequencing approaches like capture
array experiments, methods computing the percentage of on—target
reads as well as the achieved coverage of the target region were
implemented.

2.3 Detection of balanced structural variants

Balanced structural variants like translocations or inversions often
occur in cancer genomes and may lead to disease—speciﬁc fusion
genes. Such variants can be detected with non—paired reads if at
least one read spans the breakpoint of the variant (Abel et al., 2010).
These reads originate from two different locations on the reference
genome (so—called ‘chimeric reads’) and are used by our pipeline to
detect the breakpoints of structural variants.

The pipeline supports demultiplexing in cases where
molecular bar codes were used. Linker sequences can be
trimmed if appropriate. We used the Burrows—Wheeler Aligner’s
Smith—Waterman Alignment algorithm (Li and Durbin, 2010), but
other implementations producing local aligments in SAM format
(Li et al., 2009) can easily be integrated. After alignment, we
apply ﬁve different ﬁlter steps to separate chimeric reads spanning
breakpoints of structural variants from artiﬁcial chimeric reads

that were generated during sample preparation. Chimeric reads
passing the ﬁltering steps are clustered based on the chromosomal
positions of their breakpoints. Each obtained cluster of reads then
represents a putative breakpoint. To our experience, clusters of
three or more reads and, in particular, reads covering both strands
of a breakpoint region can be veriﬁed in most cases and truly
reﬂect molecular fusions. In contrast, remaining artiﬁcial chimeric
reads form clusters of size one. Detected clusters can be visualized
by our package as shown in Figure 1B and C and Supplementary
Figure S4. Our pipeline was evaluated in detail using a set of
21 leukemia samples (Grossmann et al., 2011b) and is further
described in the Supplemental Material.

3 CONCLUSION

The R453Plus1Toolbox provides an interface to access 454
Sequencing data processed with Roche GS FLX Software from
within R and offers many tools for quality reports, annotation
and advanced analyses. Users can add customized methods using
the R/Bioconductor infrastructure. Hence, the R453Plus1Toolbox
is useful for custom analyses of 454 Sequencing data and may
further support a broad application of amplicon deep sequencing
in a diagnostic laboratory, in particular, for the analyses of tumor
specimens.

Abstract

Motivation: High-dimensional DNA methylation markers may mediate pathways linking environ-
mental exposures with health outcomes. However, there is a lack of analytical methods to identify
significant mediators for high-dimensional mediation analysis.

Results: Based on sure independent screening and minimax concave penalty techniques, we use a
joint significance test for mediation effect. We demonstrate its practical performance using Monte
Carlo simulation studies and apply this method to investigate the extent to which DNA methylation
markers mediate the causal pathway from smoking to reduced lung function in the Normative
Aging Study. We identify 2 Cst with significant mediation effects.

1 Introduction

 

Mediation analysis plays an important role in biomedical, behav-
ioral, and psychosocial research studies, typically to understand the
mechanism whereby change in one variable causes change in an-
other (MacKinnon, 2008). Analytical methods for mediation ana-
lysis have been published extensively in the literature. For example,
MacKinnon et al. (2002) compared several methods to test the stat-
istical significance of the mediation effect via a Monte Carlo study;
Wang and Zhang (2011) considered estimating and testing medi-
ation effects in censored data; Taylor and MacKinnon (2012) inves-
tigated four applications of permutation tests to the single-mediator

model; Pearl (2012) presented the causal mediation formula based
on the counterfactual approach; Zhang and Wang (2013) intro-
duced and compared four approaches to dealing with missing data
in mediation analysis; Boca et al. (2014) developed a permutation
approach for testing multiple mediators. For more details about me-
diation analysis, we refer to the review papers by Ten Have and
Joffe (2010) and Preacher (2015). A comprehensive list of literature
on mediation analysis is given in a webpage maintained by David
Kenny (http://davidakenny.net/cm/mediate.htm).

Most of the above results are concerned with a single or multiple
but low-dimensional mediators. To the best of our knowledge,

there is very limited research on the high-dimensional mediation ef-
fects. However, with the development of advanced data collection
techniques, high-dimensional data become increasingly common in
many areas of scientific research. Our motivating example is an
epigenome-wide DNA methylation study. In the methylation process,
methyl groups are added to DNA at binding sites typically referred to
as cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) islands, which results in
changes (typically down-regulation) to the expression of that DNA.
Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array is a widely
used platform that allows to measure DNA methylation levels of
roughly 480K probes, resulting in high-dimensional data.

Specifically, our clinical interest lies in the effect of smoking
(measured in pack-years) on lung function, and the extent to which
this effect may be mediated by methylation changes. Prior studies
have identified CpG sites associated with cigarette smoking in both
epigenome-wide or gene-specific analyses, e.g. Gao et al. (2015),
Harlid et al. (2014), Zeilinger et al. (2013). Identifying which
markers mediate the effect of smoking on lung function is highly de-
sirable from a public health perspective as it can lead to improved
techniques for disease early detection and prevention. However, cur-
rently there are no appropriate statistical methods developed for use
in the high-dimensional mediation analysis.

In this article, we will adopt the multiple mediator model’s
framework (Preacher and Hayes, 2008) and extend it to the high-
dimensional setting. Then, we propose a method to estimate and test
mediation effects in high-dimensional epigenetic studies. Our key
ideas are: first, reduce the pool of potential mediators from a very
large to a moderate number (i.e. less than the sample size); next,
conduct the variable selection with the minimax concave penalty
(MCP, Zhang 2010); third, carry out joint significance testing for
mediation effects.

The structure of the article is given as follows. In Section 2, we
introduce the high-dimensional mediation regression model and pro-
pose the estimation and inference procedures. In Section 3, we illus-
trate the performance of our proposed procedure via extensive
simulation studies. In Section 4, we apply our method to study the
mediating effect of high-dimensional DNA methylation markers on
the causal effect of smoking on lung function in the Normative
Aging Study. Section 5 presents some concluding remarks and dis-
cusses further research topics.

2 Model and methodology

Mediation models are used to evaluate mechanism by which an ex-
posure has an effect on an outcome. The simplest case of mediation
analysis with one mediator is shown in Figure 1 with three variables:
exposure X, mediator M, and outcome Y. The variable M mediates
the effect of X on Y; that is: X causes M and then M causes Y. In the
case of high-dimensional mediators (Fig. 2), we consider the follow-
ing regression equations to assess the mediation effects:

Y=C*+V*X+61,
Mk=Ck+0¢kX+ek, k=1,"',P, (1)
Y=C+VX+ﬁ1M1+”'+ﬁpM-p+52a

where Mk, k = 1, - - - , p are the mediating variables (potential medi-
ators); 32* represents the “total effect” of the independent variable X
on the dependent variable Y; )2 is the parameter relating X and Y via
the direct effect, after adjusting for all mediators of interest.
Moreover, a = (a1, - - - ,ocp)T
dependent variable to the mediating variables, and [f = (ﬁ1,- - - ,ﬁp)T

is the parameter vector relating the in-

is the parameter vector relating the mediators to the dependent

variable adjusting for the effect of the independent variable. The
“indirect effect” is denoted by the path X —> M —> Y in Figure 1,
and in the high-dimensional case is denoted by (a1ﬁ1,---,apﬁP)T
Furthermore, c*, c and ck, k = 1, - - - , p are the intercept terms; 61, 62
and ek, k = 1, - - - ,p are residuals. Note there are p functions in the
second equation of (1), one for each mediator.

Since the number of mediators p is much larger than the sample
size 11, traditional regression analysis fails to work in the third equa-
tion of (1). To tackle this problem we will first employ the sure inde-
pendence screening (SIS, Fan and Lv, 2008) to identify those Mk’s
with large absolute effect |ﬁk|, which form an index set denoted by
I C {1, - - - ,p}. We will then perform variable selection using MCP.
Details of the proposed procedure are as follows:

Step 1. (Screening). Use the SIS (Fan and Lv, 2008) to identify a
subsetI = {1 S k S p : Mk is among the top d = [2n/log(n)] larg-
est effects for the response Y}. Of note, the methylation markers are
standardized to ensure that the coefficients are in the same scale.

Step 2. (MCP-penalized estimate). Compute {,3}, k E I} by mini-
mizing the MCP penalized criterion,

Q015 = Z; (Yi — c — in — ZkelﬁkMik)2 + 23/261103"S wk)’ (2)

where p),5(-) is the MCP:

2
pix/it) = Ajlﬁkl —%j1{o s lﬁkl < 62}

225
+7H|ﬁkl Z 5/1}-

Here 2 > 0 is the regularization parameter, and 5 > 0 determines
the concavity of MCP. The MCP procedure has been implemented
in R package ncvreg (Breheny and Huang, 2011). We prefer MCP
over other penalty functions, e.g. elastic net (Zou and Hastie, 2005)
since MCP can select the correct model with probability tending to
1 (Zhang, 2010). Further, we set d = [211/ log(n)] in Step 1 instead of
d = log(n)] in Fan and Lv (2008) to increase the chance to iden-
tify important mediators, since we need to consider both X —> M
and M —> Y simultaneously.

Estimating and testing high-dimensional mediation effects

 

Step 3. (Ioint significance test). Let S = {k :Bk 7S 0}, which is
based on the MCP-penalized estimate in Step 2. The raw P-value for
testing H0 : [ik = 0 is given as

Praw,1k =  _  }7
01k

where le 6 S,  is the cumulative distribution function of N (0, 1),
and 81k is the estimate of standard error for Bk that can be obtained
from the oracle property of MCP (Fan and Li, 2001; Zhang, 2010).
To control the family wise error rate (FWER), it is necessary to ad-
just for multiple comparisons by Bonferroni’s method. Thus, we
propose to use the following corrected P-value

Pcorr,1k = min(Praw,1k '  1), 

where k E S, and |S| is the cardinality, i.e. the number of elements
in set 8. Notice that the MCP has the model selection consistency
(Zhang, 2010), which ensures the validity of the joint significance
test procedure.

Similarly, the raw P-value for testing H0 : ock = 0 is

Praw,2k =  _  }7
02k

where le 6 S, 0?; is the ordinary least squares estimator for ock and
82k is the corresponding estimated standard error. Similar to (3), the
Bonferroni corrected P-value is

Pcorr,2k = min(Praw,2k '   

We will reject the null hypothesis of no mediation effect with Mk
only if both ock and 8,, are significant. The Bonferroni corrected
P-value for the joint significance test is defined as

Pcorr,k = maX(Pcorr,1ka Pcorr,2k)7 

where the corrected P-values Peormk and Peorer are defined in (3)
and (4) respectively. If Pam)e < 0.05, we can conclude that there
exists significant mediation effect for Mk on Y, k E 8.

Remarks 1: Another approach (Liu et al., 2013) is to test the me-
diation effect by the following model:

Y=C*+V*X+61,
Mk=ck+0¢kX+ek, k=1,"',P, (6)
Y=c+yX+ﬁkMk+sk, k=1,---,p.

In the last equation of Model (6), Y depends on only one mediator
Mk. However, as shown in Figure 2, multiple mediators contribute to
the outcome Y. Preacher and Hayes (2008) described several advantages
of the single multiple mediation Model (1) over the separate simple me-
diation Model (6). First, failure to adjust for other P — 1 mediators could
lead to either inefficiency (if mediators are independent of each other)
or even bias (if mediators are correlated with each other). The latter
issue may be more troublesome as the correlation among probes close
to one another can be as high as 0.6 (Moen et al., 2013) in cell lines or
even stronger in our Normative Aging Study (NAS) data collected dir-
ectly by blood sample. Furthermore, including multiple mediators in
one model allows us to determine to what extent the specific indirect ef-
fects are associated with mediators, as shown in our Application.
Finally, it is not feasible to predict Y using only one mediator.

3 Simulation studies

In this section, we will conduct some simulation studies to assess our
proposed procedure. We generate data from model (1), where X is

generated from N(0, 1.5), the first 8 elements of [i (ﬁk, k = 1, - - - ,8)
are (0.20, 0.25, 0.35, 0.40, 0.50, 0.50, 0, 0)T, and the first 8 elements
of 0c (ackJe = 1,---,8) are (0.25,0.15,0.25,0.55,0,0,0.55,0.55)T.
The rest of [i and 0c are all 0. Let c: 1, )2 = 0.5. ck is chosen as a ran-
dom number from U(0, 2). ek and 62 are generated from N(0, 1.2)
and N (0, 1), respectively. The direct effect )2 = 0.5 and the total ef-
fect )2* = )2 + 221 akﬁk = 0.895, so the percentage of total effect
mediated by methylation markers is 0395/0895 2 44%.

We fit the model by the proposed method and use the joint sig-
nificance test procedure to derive the P-values. We also compare
our procedure with the naive joint significance test based on model
(6 ), where we use Bonferroni’s adjustment by the total number of
methylation markers p. In the above setting, let 80 = {1,2,3,4}
denotes the index set of significant mediators. Following Dezeure
et al. (2015), we define FWER=P(E|k E 88 : Pam)e < 0.05), where
Pam,e is given in (5). Similarly,
Power = Zk€50P(PCO,,,k < 0.05)/|So|. Table 1 presents the estima-
tor and mean square error (MSE) for the indirect effect
akﬁk, k = 1, - - - ,9. The FWER and power are reported in Tables 2
and 3, respectively. All simulations are based on 500 replications,
with sample size n = 100, 200 and 300, respectively.

From the results in Table 1, we can see that the estimators are
close to the true values of indirect effect and the MSE decreases as
the sample size n increases. Table 2 indicates that the proposed joint
significance test procedure has reasonably well controlled type I
error, while a little conservative. In contrast, the naive procedure
has poor type I error control. In Table 3, our method has better
power than the naive method. Therefore, our method is preferred in
practice.

4 An application

Methylation markers are often considered potential mediators be-
tween exposures and health outcomes. For example, Bind et al.
(2014) found that the effect of air pollution on coagulation and in-
ﬂammation was significantly mediated by several methylation
markers in the Normative Aging Study. However, they only con-
sidered 5 specific methylation markers. An epigenome-wide medi-
ation analysis will allow for more thorough and systematic
identification of all the possible mediation effects due to DNA
methylation.

Our data come from the US Department of Veterans Affairs
Normative Aging Study, an ongoing longitudinal cohort of elderly,
predominantly white American veterans. In 1963, 2280 men aged
21—80 years and free of hypertension or other chronic conditions
were enrolled. Between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2013,
686 were randomly selected and had blood samples profiled using
the Illumina Infinium 450K BeadChip DNA methylation array. A
total of 500ng of DNA was used to perform bisulfite conversion.
The DNA methylation level was calculated as M values (logit of
methylated probe intensity) which approximate a normal distribu-
tion (Du et al., 2010). Batch effect and potential confounding effects
of blood cell subtype were estimated by Housemandn method
(Houseman et al., 2012) and corrected for using ComBat (Johnson
et al., 2007). We include 484 548 probes in the analysis.

We are interested in how these methylation markers mediate
the relationship between smoking and lung function. Lung func-
tion is measured by four outcomes: FEV1 (forced expiratory vol-
ume in 1 second), FVC (forced expiratory vital capacity), FEV1/
FVC, and MMEF (maximum mid expiratory flow). We conduct
separate mediation analysis for each measure. We exclude subjects
with lung-related diseases, e.g. asthma, emphysema and COPD, re-
sulting in a sample size of 290. Smoking status and frequency were
assessed via questionnaire between 1999 and 2006, defined as
‘baseline’ for our analyses. Methylation was measured at baseline,
and outcomes were measured between 2001 and 2006 (e.g.
2+ years post-baseline for each subject), allowing us to ensure the
proper temporal relationship (exposure —> methylation —> lung
function). Our analysis also adjusts for age, height, and weight in
each equation of model (1).

Of note, in the Normative Aging Study, there are much stronger
correlations between M’s and Y than those between X and M’s.
Therefore, in Step 1 we also add the top d = [2n/log(n)] Cst in
the path from X —> M to increase the possibility to identify signifi-
cant mediators. In the second step we run a variable selection on the
screened Cst. In Step 3 we use the joint significance test to derive
the P-values. Since smoking reduces lung function, we filter out me-
diators with indirect effect akﬁk > 0.

In Table 4 we list the summary results for each of the four out-
comes. We identify 2 Cst as mediators, which are associated with
at least one lung function outcome. Specifically, ch5 5 75 921 (in the
gene region of AHRR) is associated with three measures of lung
function, methylation of which has been shown to be a sensitive
marker of smoking history (Gao et al., 2015; Harlid et al., 2014).

Another CpG, cg2485 9433 in the intergenic region 6p21.33 is asso-
ciated with MMEF of the lung function (Ambatipudi et al., 2016;
Zeilinger et al., 2013). Therefore, our Epigenome-Wide Association
Study (EWAS) results are supported by the current literature for
their potential roles in smoking and lung function, demonstrating
the validity of our approach.

We are also interested in the relative magnitudes of the total ef-
fect mediated through methylation markers, defined as akﬁk/y* for
each methylation marker. The results are listed in the last column of
Table 4. About 50% of total effect between smoking and FEV1 (or
FVC), and 40% between smoking and FEV1/FVC is mediated
through cg055 75921, and 16% between smoking and MMEF
through cg24859433. We note that the percentage of total effect
mediated by methylation markers for FEV1 is close to the
Simulation Setting (44%), demonstrating the applicability of our
method to real scenarios. Intervention could be explored on these
Cst to modify the lung function among smokers. Finally, we use
the naive joint significance test for the NAS data. However, it fails
to identify any significant mediators.

5 Conclusion and remarks

We developed a new method to estimate mediation effects with
high-dimensional mediators. We used the sure independent screen-
ing and the MCP methods, and the joint significance test for medi-
ation effects. We illustrated the proposed method via simulation
studies and a real data example. We identified 2 Cst which could
mediate the effects of smoking and lung function. Our method can
be widely used in high-dimensional DNA methylation analysis from
population studies.

Several other issues may complicate the testing of high-
dimensional mediation effects, which will be studied in the future re-
search. e.g. confounders (Li et al., 2007), non-linearity (Albert,
2012) and measurement error (Valeri et al., 2014; Zhao and
Prentice, 2014). Particularly, for measurement error, two classical
correction approaches including the method of moments and regres-
sion calibration (Valeri et al., 2014) may be employed in the high-
dimensional mediators case.

In reality, many exposures or risk factors may work simultan-
eously on DNA methylation. For example smoking and physical ac-
tivity can both affect lung function through DNA methylation. If
these exposures are independent of each other, we can simply add
the other risk factor in Model (1). For example, in the second equa-
tion of Model (1), we have a total of 2p parameters
(alk, 0(2),, k = 1,. . . ,p). The estimation and inference can be carried
out similarly. However, complications arise when there factors are
correlated or have interaction effects. It is of further interest to in-
corporate multiple exposures into the mediation analysis of high-
dimensional methylation markers.

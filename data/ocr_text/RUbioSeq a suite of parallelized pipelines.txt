ABSTRACT

Motivation: RUbioSeq has been developed to facilitate the primary
and secondary analysis of re—sequencing projects by providing an
integrated software suite of parallelized pipelines to detect exome
variants (single-nucleotide variants and copy number variations) and
to perform bisulfite—seq analyses automatically. RUbioSeq’s variant
analysis results have been already validated and published.

1 INTRODUCTION

Primary and secondary data analyses of next-generation sequen-
cing studies (NGS) consist of a set of successive stages that are
repetitively and routinely executed using a wide collection of
tools (e.g. quality control tools, read aligners, variant callers
and so forth). These tools have different origins and usually
lack of straight interoperability. This issue has driven computa-
tional biologists to demand intuitive, efﬁcient and integrated
pipelines to facilitate routine NGS analysis and improve the re-
producibility of the results. Several remarkable efforts have been
carried out in this sense. Prominent examples include
NARWHAL, a recent proposal to automate Illumina’s primary
analysis (Brouwer et al., 2012) and HugeSeq, a powerful pipeline
designed to cover primary and secondary analysis of single-
nucleotide variant (SNVs) and copy number variation (CNV)
experiments (Lam et al., 2012). HugeSeq uses FASTQ ﬁles as
input to detect and annotate genomic variants running GATK
(DePristo et al., 2011) and SAMtools; however, the current ver-
sion of HugeSeq does not support either sample quality control
tools or bisulﬁte-seq (BS-Seq) analysis methods. Galaxy, a large
and ﬂexible web-based platform also provides an NGS toolbox
(Blakenberg et al., 2010). Despite its potential, Galaxy’s NGS
tools are still in ,6 and do not support either CNV or BS-Seq
analysis. We present RUbioSeq, an automated and parallelized
software suite for primary and secondary analysis of Illumina

and SOLiD experiments. Using standard input and output ﬁle
formats and an intuitive XML conﬁguration ﬁle, the application
offers an integrated framework to run parallelized pipelines for
variant detection in exome enrichment and methylation studies.
RUbioSeq results have been experimentally validated and ac-
cepted for publication (Domenech et al., 2012).

2 FEATURES AND METHODS

RUbioSeq is highly conﬁgurable. The parameters of the analysis
are speciﬁed in an intuitive XML conﬁguration ﬁle, which allows
customization of the pipeline. Every RUbioSeq workﬂow ac-
cepts single- and paired-end experiments and detects Illumina’s
CASAVA version automatically. We have included additional
quality control steps to check the integrity of the inputs and
the BAM ﬁles generated. RUbioSeq workﬂows are divided
into functional modules that may be executed independently.
The results are saved in a project directory tree maintaining a
structured organization for the output ﬁles. Further details are
available in the user manual at http://rubioseq.sourceforge.net/.

2.1 SNVs detection pipeline

The primary input ﬁles accepted by RUbioSeq are reads in
FASTQ (Illumina) or CSFASTA/QUAL (SOLiD) format.
Alternatively, BAM alignment ﬁles are supported as input
(Fig. 1). SNV pipeline is divided into three main modules: (i)
short-read alignment with a combination of BWA+ BFAST
aligners (Li and Durbin, 2009; Homer et al., 2009) and quality
control analysis using F astQC, (ii) duplicate marking using Picard
tools, realignment and recalibration using GATK, and TEQC as
quality control and (iii) GATK variant calling, tumor/control
somatic indels detection and advanced ﬁltering using GATK’s
VariantFiltration walker. Finally, variants are annotated using
Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor WEP, McLaren et al., 2010).
All the output ﬁles are generated in standard formats, such as
BAM and VCF (Danecek et al., 2011; Li et al., 2009).

2.2 CNV detection pipeline

RUbioSeq’s CNV detection pipeline uses the modules (i) and (ii)
described in Section 2.1 to generate GATK recalibrated BAM

ﬁles. Then CONTRA software uses recalibrated BAMs to per-
form the CNV analyses for case—control comparisons (Li et al.,
2012). CONTRA calls copy number gains and losses based on
normalized depth of coverage, generating output ﬁles in standard
VCF format (Fig. 1).

2.3 Bisulﬁte—seq pipeline

RUbioSeq requires bisulﬁte-converted reads in FASTQ format
as input. The software accepts input data generated from Cokus
et al. (2008) and Lister et al. (2009) protocols (Krueger et al.,
2012). This pipeline has been structured in three analysis mod-
ules: (i) read ﬁltering, F astQC quality control, bisulﬁte sequence
alignment and methylation calling using Bismark, (ii) depth ﬁl-
tering and output ﬁles generation and (iii) an optional interval
methylation percentages calculation (Fig. 1). The lack of stand-
ard output format for methylation-calls has encouraged us to
adapt this output to the widely established VCF format. See
RUbioSeq’s documentation for further details.

2.4 Implementation details

RUbioSeq is written in Perl. Its modular design provides a high
ﬂexibility to facilitate the inclusion of additional functionalities
in future versions of the tool. RUbioSeq has been implemented
to run on UNIX HPC systems scheduled by SGE or PBS. The
software allows pipelines to be launched in a UNIX workstation
as well. We have also implemented a parallelized and multi-
threaded execution of the analysis process enabling different
levels of execution. RUbioSeq’s workﬂows are prepared to per-
form multiple samples simultaneously on an HPC system. Under
this parallelized design, the real execution time for N samples
(N * t) is reduced to t, where t represents execution time for one

sample. This feature can be executed in two ways: Standalone
multisample where every sample generates an independent result
and Joint multisample where all samples contribute to a unique
ﬁnal result.

2.4.] Analysis protocols All the implemented code and pro-
grams used in RUbioSeq are open-source. Our modules use
state-of—art software, such as BWA and BFAST aligners,
GATK variant caller and Ensembl’s VEP. We have set
RUbioSeq’s parameters with defaults established in best practice
recommendations provided by developers for each of the analysis
tasks and platforms supported. We have also set-up platform-
speciﬁc alignment protocols. For instance, for Illumina exome
variation analysis, the software takes advantage of BWA efﬁ-
ciency and BFAST sensitivity by ﬁrst performing a BWA align-
ment step and then a BFAST alignment for those reads
unmapped at the ﬁrst step. Next, RUbioSeq generates the
output BAM ﬁle containing all the mapped reads that will be
accepted by RUbioSeq’s downstream execution module.

2.4.2 Benchmarking RUbioSeq has been executed in a 24 node
Intel Nehalem cluster with 16 cores (2.67 Ghz each core) and
48 GB of ransom access memory per node. The variant detection
workﬂow generated full lists of genomic variants in 3 h for an
Illumina paired-end experiment carried out in 10 chronic
lymphocytic leukemia samples (CLLs) and their corresponding
healthy controls (SRA ID: SRA049097). This study covered
coding and regulatory regions belonging to 301 genes
(1.36 Mb) associated to CLLs (Domenech et al., 2012). We add-
itionally tested our software with BS-Seq data available from the
NIH Roadmap Epigenomics consortium. We used the Illumina’s
H1 cell line sample (SRS004212) from the UCSD Human
Reference Epigenome Mapping Project (SRP000941). We have
analyzed 10 F ASTQ ﬁles (~1.5 GB per ﬁle) using the joint multi-
sample execution mode and the default parameters. The ﬁnal
results (without bowtie—build) were generated in ~3.5 h.

3 CONCLUSIONS

We have developed RUbioSeq, an integrated and parallelized
workﬂow for DNA-Seq and BS-Seq studies. As RUbioSeq de-
pends on >20 different software packages, we have created a
customized 64-bit LiveDVD (based on Ubuntu 12.10 Desktop
LiveCD), which bundles RUbioSeq plus all its dependencies,
ready to be used on any computer. The results generated by
RUbioSeq have been validated and accepted for publication.

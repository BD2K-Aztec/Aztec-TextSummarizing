Curators of the world
unite: the International
Society of Biocuration

We often take the wealth of biological data that is available for
granted. As computational biologists, we can often search the
Internet and ﬁnd a dataset that will fulﬁll our needs. These are
usually made available through one of the hundreds of biological
databases that have been created over the last 20 years. The people
who marshal this information and put it into the formats that allow
us to easily work with it are the unsung heroes of molecular biology.
The recently formed International Society of Biocuration (ISB) gives
these people a voice.

Biocuration can be summed up as the transformation of biological
data into an organized form. It is only achieved through the combined
efforts of the experimental community who generate the data, the
biocurators who organize the data and the software and database
developers who make the data available for all to use.

The ISB grew out of the International Biocuration Conferences,
which provided a forum for biocurators to discuss the scientiﬁc
obstacles as well as new developments in the ﬁeld. The next meeting
is the Fourth International Biocurator Meeting that will be held in
Chiba, Japan, in October 2010. Further details can be found on
the ISB’s web site at http://www.bi0curator.org/. I would like to
encourage all biocurators and developers with an interest in curation
to register as a member of the ISB and play a part in the growth of
this exciting new body.

The Society was founded in early 2009. The ﬁrst election
of the executive board was held in September 2009, which is
now composed of Pascale Gaudet (President), Lorna Richardson
(Secretary), Lydie Bougueleret (Treasurer), Terri Attwood, Tanya
Berardini, Tadashi Imanishi, Owen White, Ioannis Xenarios
and myself. The mission of the ISB is to deﬁne the work
of biocurators; propose discussion and job forums; organize
conferences and workshops; build relationships with journals and
publishers to improve links between journals and databases; provide
documentation and gold standards; and foster connections with user
communities to ensure that databases meet their needs. A further
important purpose is working to raise awareness of biocuration and
biological databases with funding agencies to help secure long-term
funding for biocuration. Despite the billions spent each year on
generating biological data, there is still a reluctance to invest in
the relatively small fraction of funding needed to maximize the use
of this data through curation.

Next time you download a dataset for your work, spare a thought
for the hardworking biocurator that has made your life so much
easier. If you are a biocurator or database developer, then please
join the ISB to support their important work. I would like to wish
the International Society of Biocuration a warm welcome and every
future success.

Conﬂict of Interest: AB. is a member of the Executive Board of
the ISB.

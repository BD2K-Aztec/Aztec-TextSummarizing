Abstract

Summary: ENViz (Enrichment Analysis and Visualization) is a Cytoscape app that performs joint
enrichment analysis of two types of sample matched datasets in the context of systematic annota—
tions. Such datasets may be gene expression or any other high—throughput data collected in the
same set of samples. The enrichment analysis is done in the context of pathway information, gene
ontology or any custom annotation of the data. The results of the analysis consist of significant as—
sociations between profiled elements of one of the datasets to the annotation terms (e.g. miR—19
was associated to the cell—cycle process in breast cancer samples). The results of the enrichment
analysis are visualized as an interactive Cytoscape network.

Availability and implementation: ENViz is publically available in the Cytoscape App Store (http://
apps.cytoscape.org/apps/enviz). For additional information please visit the tool website: http://

1 Introduction

The recent emergence of novel high—throughput technologies enables
the quantification of different types of biological features in a gen—
ome—wide scale (e.g. mRNA expression levels, miRNA expression
levels and DNA copy numbers). In parallel with these technologies,
various methodologies have been developed to handle integrated
analysis of functional genomics data, mainly by studying the tran—
scriptional programs and global organization of biological proc—
esses. Still, only a few tools support routine joint analysis of sample
cohorts with multiple genomic measurement results (Gomez—
Cabrero et 61]., 2014). Even fewer tools provide the visualization
strength of Cytoscape in this context (Cline et 61]., 2007; Bindea
et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2010).

The ENViz approach to integrated data analysis uses the power
of enrichment statistics combined with genomic annotation

databases to statistically assign relevant function annotations to
explored profiled elements. It thus provides a better understating of
the relationship between different molecular entities in cells or or-
ganisms. Visualizing ENViz results as Cytoscape networks provide
compact structured representation of enrichment results.

Even though the development of ENViz was motivated by avail—
able modern biological measurements, joint analysis of two sample
matched datasets and systematic annotations may be applied to oth—
er similarly structured.

2 Tool description

ENViz follows an enrichment analysis approach, driven by three in—
put matrices: (i) the primary data matrix (e.g. genes expression
measurement across a set of samples), (ii) the annotation matrix

matic of the analysis and the overview of the data loaded into Cytoscape for ENViz analysis. The Analysis panel controls data input and analysis parameter set-
tings. The Visualization panel controls the significance threshold for the enrichment network generation and the color coding of the annotation categories based
on enrichment scores. (b) Bi-partite network for enrichment analysis of breast cancer data. Nodes in this network correspond to WikiPathways (colored yellow-

providing binary annotation on each of the primary data matrix
elements [e.g. pathway or gene ontology (GO) annotation] and (iii)
the pivot data matrix providing information on the same set of
samples of the primary data matrix (e.g. miRNAs expression meas—
urement) (Fig. 1a).

For each pivot data element ENViz performs these steps:

° Compute the correlation to each element of primary data.

° Rank primary data elements based on above correlations.

° Compute the statistical enrichment of annotated elements (e.g.
pathways) in the top of above ranked list based on a minimum-
hypergeometric (mHG) statistics.

Details of mHG statistics are explained in (Eden et al., 2007,
2009). Briefly, given a ranked binary annotation vector we compute
enrichment of this annotation in the top [a ranked elements based on
the hypergeometric statistics, where k is selected to optimize this en—
richment. Finally, the mHG score [—log(mHG P—value)] for the
pivot—annotation association is reported. The calculated significance
level is valid for every individual pivot annotation pair, but is not
corrected for the number of pairs tested.

Significant results are represented in Cytoscape as an enrichment
network—a bipartite graph with nodes corresponding to pivot and
annotation elements, and edges corresponding to significant pivot—
annotation associations, where significance threshold is user defined

(Fig. 1b). In addition ENViz supports extended visualization for as—
sociation to:

° The WikiPathways (Kelder et al., 2012) database (Fig. 1c), where
top correlated genes (from the primary data) are visually overlaid
on the relevant pathway.

° The G0 (Ashburner et al., 2000) database (Fig. 1d), where all
GO term associated with a particular pivot element can be visu—
ally overlaid on the GO graph, which may point to functionally
relevant mechanisms.

To address multiple testing issues, as well as some potential
dependencies between primary data elements, ENViz implements
filtering by permutation correction. For each permutation, samples
in the pivot data matrix are randomly shuffled, and an enrich-
ment score Stand is calculated for each pivot with at least one sig—
nificant association, as defined by the user. If, for a given pivot—
annotation pair with enrichment score S, we observe StandZS
more than a user—defined number of times across all permutations,
then this pivot—annotation element pair is considered not signifi-
cant. For pivot—annotation pairs that survive this permutation test
filtering, the original mHG score is reported as the enrichment
score.

More details can be found in the user tutorial (http://www.
agilent.com/labs/research/compbio/enviz/ENVizUserTutorial.pdf).

Cytoscape App for integrated statistical analysis

3 Example

An example dataset, based on data published in (Enerly et al., 2011)
and formatted for ENViz, can be downloaded from http://www.
agilent.com/labs/research/compbio/enviz/data.html. This dataset
consists of 100 breast tumor samples with various characteristics.
Primary data is gene expression profiles from Agilent microarray
experiments, pivot data is Agilent microarray—based miRNA
profiles, and the annotation matrix is taken from WikiPathways
and GO database. As shown in Figure 1 using ENViz we identify a
significant association between miR—301 b and the cell—cycle
pathway.

On a standard laptop (i7 chip), the analysis of the example data
with default parameters and the WikiPathways annotations takes
N1 min; analysis with GO annotation takes ~25 min.

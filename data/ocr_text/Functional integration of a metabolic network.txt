ABSTRACT

Motivation: Flux balance analysis (FBA) has been used extensively
to analyze genome-scale, constraint-based models of metabolism in
a variety of organisms. The predictive accuracy of such models has
recently been improved through the integration of high-throughput
expression profiles of metabolic genes and proteins. However,
extensions of FBA often require that such data be discretized
a priori into sets of genes or proteins that are either ‘on’ or ‘off’.
This procedure requires selecting relatively subjective expression
thresholds, often requiring several iterations and refinements to
capture the expression dynamics and retain model functionality.
Results: We present a method for mapping expression data from
a set of environmental, genetic or temporal conditions onto a
metabolic network model without the need for arbitrary expression
thresholds. Metabolic Adjustment by Differential Expression (MADE)
uses the statistical significance of changes in gene or protein
expression to create a functional metabolic model that most
accurately recapitulates the expression dynamics. MADE was used
to generate a series of models that reflect the metabolic adjustments
seen in the transition from fermentative- to glycerol-based respiration
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The calculated gene states match
98.7% of possible changes in expression, and the resulting models
capture functional characteristics of the metabolic shift.
Availability: MADE is implemented in Matlab and requires a mixed-
integer linear program solver. Source code is freely available at

1 INTRODUCTION

The availability of sequenced genomes has enabled the assembly
of high—quality, genome—scale metabolic reconstructions (Oberhardt
et al., 2009). Various constraint—based techniques such as ﬂux
balance analysis (FBA) have been developed to predict the steady—
state ﬂux distribution through a metabolic network after various
environmental and genetic perturbations. This method assumes that
an organism’s metabolic objective (or objective function) is to
maximize the ﬂux through a subset of pathways [often corresponding
to the production of biomass in unicellular organisms as an
approximation of growth (Feist and Palsson, 2010)] and formulates

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

a linear programming problem describing the stoichiometry of the
metabolic network (Orth et al., 2010).

With constraint—based techniques such as FBA, in silico
reconstructions have successfully predicted relationships between
the presence or absence of a gene and the metabolic capabilities
of a microorganism, including gene essentially (Feist et al., 2007),
adaptive evolution (Applebee et al., 2008; Lee and Palsson, 2010)
and strain design for optimal production of a metabolic byproduct
(Burgard et al., 2003; Feist et al., 2010; Kim and Reed, 2010). These
predictions assume that the reactions in a reconstruction are either
‘on’ or ‘off’, as determined by a set of Boolean rules connecting
reactions to the binary expression states of associated genes. This
simpliﬁcation attempts to overcome the paucity of kinetic details for
metabolic gene/reaction associations and allows genes to be mapped
to the hundreds or thousands of reactions in a genome—scale model.

Genome—wide transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) can be
used to predict the likely ‘on’ or ‘off’ state of metabolic genes as
a function of environmental factors. Unfortunately, complete TRNs
are only available for a limited number of organisms [including
Escherichia coli (Covert et al., 2004) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(Herrgard et al., 2006)]. Other reconstructions must instead rely
on experimental measurements (typically from gene expression
microarrays) to determine the appropriate gene states, but this
approach suffers from two complications. First, classifying reactions
as ‘on’ or ‘off’ requires setting a threshold in the continuous
expression levels of the associated genes; such thresholds cannot be
accurately determined from measured mRNA levels alone. Recent
evidence indicates that such a correlation between transcript levels
and metabolic reaction activity does exist (Moxley et al., 2009).
However, determining a speciﬁc threshold above which microarray
measurements imply physiologically appreciable activity in the
corresponding metabolic reaction is an unresolved problem. Second,
these thresholds are not independent, since functioning metabolic
reconstructions require a minimum set of reactions to be active in
each condition, regardless of any apparent change in the underlying
gene expression data. Especially when considering decreases in
expression levels, the choice to ﬁt these data by inactivating the
corresponding reaction must be balanced with the functional effects
of removing a reaction from the metabolic network.

An early attempt at reconciling gene expression data with an FBA
model was the GIMME algorithm (Becker and Palsson, 2008). Using
a set of user—supplied thresholds for the transition of each gene
from ‘on’ to ‘off’, GIMME iteratively reactivated ‘off’ reactions
(by turning on genes below their threshold) until a functioning
model was obtained. While GIMME did produce functioning FBA
models, the method required the a priori determination of expression
thresholds.

A more recent approach (Shlomi et al, 2008) used the expression
thresholds in previously published databases to classify reactions
as either highly, moderately or lowly active. After choosing a
threshold for the minimum ﬂux through a highly active reaction,
a mixed—integer linear program (MILP) was formulated to calculate
a steady—state ﬂux distribution that maximized the number of highly
(lowly) expressed reactions that carried at least (not more than)
the threshold ﬂux. All such reactions were assumed to be active
(inactive). Although this approach was successfully applied to a
reconstruction of the human metabolic network, the same technique
would not necessarily guarantee that the set of active reactions could
produce the necessary objective ﬂux in microorganisms with a more
deﬁned objective function. Additionally, determining the state of
each reaction does not uniquely determine the expression state of
each gene in the reconstruction. (An active reaction, for example,
could be activated if either of two genes, each encoding an isozyme,
were expressed.)

We present a method for de novo determination of a functional,
binary expression state for all genes in a metabolic reconstruction
using experimentally derived expression data. Our algorithm,
Metabolic Adjustment by Differential Expression (MADE), uses
an optimization—based approach to create a sequence of binary
expression states that reﬂect the most statistically signiﬁcant changes
in the series of gene expression measurements; it does not require
the use of arbitrary expression thresholds for each gene. The
optimization is constrained to produce only functioning models
by simultaneously imposing a minimum value on the system’s
metabolic objective. MADE is formulated as a single MILP problem
that can be solved on several freely available, in addition to
commercial, linear programming packages.

2 APPROACH

MADE relies on expression data from two or more conditions
to determine the best—ﬁtting gene states. (Again, ‘conditions’ can
be any set of environmental, genomic or temporal data.) To
illustrate, consider the simple metabolic system in Figure 1a. The
product of the gene input facilitates the transport of metabolite
A into the system, after which it undergoes transformation into
B, catalyzed by either of two isozymes—the products of genes
left and right. Production of B is assumed to be the metabolic
objective. This example system receives an external stimulus, and
the transcriptional response is measured for each gene at 0, 2 and
4h, as summarized in Figure lb.

As indicated by the expression data, the expression levels of
genes input and left decrease between 0 and 2h; they remain at
this lower level of expression until the 4h time point. Expression
of the enzyme Right appears to increase between each set of time
points. The challenges of converting these data into a binary gene
state are illustrated in Figure 1c. As a ﬁrst approximation, having
input and left ‘on’ at Oh and ‘off’ at 2 and 4h matches the overall
expression pattern. However, the gene product of input is always
necessary for a functioning model, so neither of the resulting 2 or
4h gene states is feasible. Finding a binary representation for the
gene right is also not straightforward. The continuous expression
levels increase during each transition, but a binary approximation
can only transition from ‘off’ to ‘on’ once. It is unclear whether right
should be actively expressed beginning at 2 or 4 h.

Figure 1d demonstrates the results of the MADE approach.
Consistent with the measured expression, left turns ‘off’ between
0 and 2h, remaining in that state for the ﬁnal time point. Although
input expression decreases signiﬁcantly, MADE leaves the gene ‘on’
for the entire time course because of its essentiality. It is assumed
that while mRNA expression of input has decreased by 2h, the
functional abilities of the gene product must be preserved to facilitate
transport of a necessary metabolite. Finally, MADE activates right
transcription at 2h rather than 4h, using the greater statistical
signiﬁcance of the increase between 0 and 2h as evidence for this
approximation. The resulting model is functional at all time points
and suggests that the metabolic system initially routes ﬂux through
the Left—catalyzed pathway and transitions to the Right—catalyzed
pathway after 2h.

3 METHODS
3.1 FBA

At steady state, the ﬂuxes through each chemical reaction in a metabolic
network satisfy the system of equations Sv =0, where v is a vector of ﬂuxes
and S is a matrix representation of the network stoichiometry. The rows of
S correspond to the metabolites in the system. Each column in S describes
a single chemical reaction, with negative (positive) entries indicating the
stoichiometric coefﬁcients of the reactants (products).

The FBA problem is formulated as the following linear program that
maximizes the ﬂux through an objective reaction (vobj).

max vobj
subject to

SV 2 0 (a)

lb 5 v S ub (b)

In addition to the aforementioned mass balance constraints (a), upper and
lower bounds, ub and lb, are imposed on the ﬂuxes in the network. These
bounds enforce thermodynamic reversibility and mechanistic (i.e. maximum
uptake and secretion rate) constraints for the reactions. The solution to the
FBA problem is a unique maximum ﬂux through the objective reaction,
which is used as a measure of biological ﬁtness.

Several methods have been used to incorporate gene—protein reaction
(GPR) and TRN constraints on an FBA problem (Covert et al, 2004;
Gianchandani et al, 2006; Lee et al, 2008). The SR—FBA formalism
converts the Boolean rules into a series of integer inequalities, allowing
for simultaneous solution with the FBA problem as a single MILP (Shlomi
et al, 2007). More details on this conversion are available as Supplementary
Methods.

3.2 MADE representation

Given a sequence of measured mean expression levels {e1,e2, ...,e,,} for a
gene, a sequence of differences {d192,d2_,3, ...,dn_1_,n} can be deﬁned as

+1 ei<ei+1
di—>i+1 = 0 et=€i+1 (1)

—1 ei>ei+1

For example, the value of d1_,2 signiﬁes that the mean expression of the gene
signiﬁcantly increases (+1), decreases (—1) or remains constant (0) between
conditions 1 and 2. Statistical signiﬁcance is determined by p1_)2, the P—value
corresponding to the conﬁdence of assigning the gene to one of the cases in
Equation (1).

MADE ﬁnds a sequence of binary expression states {x1,x2, ...,x,,}, x,- 6
{0,1} such that the differences between successive states (xi+1—x,-) most
closely match the corresponding differences in the mean expression levels

dial-+1. Because the binary representation of gene expression assumed by
FBA models cannot account for all possible expression patterns, MADE
uses the statistical signiﬁcance of the differences to create the most probable
approximation. For example, consider a gene with mean expression levels
(over four time points) of {10, 11, 65, 109}. If the calculated differences
were {0, +1, +1} with P—values {0.02, 0.048, 0.0012}, an exact binary
representation of this sequence is not possible, since the gene must increase
over two consecutive intervals. MADE would choose the binary expression
sequence {0, 0, 0, 1} over {0, 0, 1, 1}, since the increase between time
points 3 and 4 is more statistically signiﬁcant than the increase between time
points 2 and 3.

More formally, the binary expression sequence returned by MADE is
computed as the

where n is the number of conditions, X C{0,1}” is the set of all gene
expression states that allow functioning FBA models, and w(pl-_,,-+1) is a
weighting function that assigns larger weights to more signiﬁcant P—values
[for example, w(p) = —logp]. The absolute value in the summand measures
the discrepancy between the binary transitions and expression differences.
Binary sequences that show an increase or decrease when the measured
expression indicates no change (or vice versa) incur a ‘penalty’ of w; binary
sequences that increase when expression data decrease (or vice versa) are
penalized by 2w.

3.3 Formulating the MILP problem

For each transition between conditions, the binary variables x representing
the expression state of the metabolic genes are partitioned into three sets
I , D and C, corresponding to increasing, decreasing or constant expression

between the two conditions. The optimization objective f for this transition
is the weighted sum

fi—>i+1(x)= ZW(Px,-a,-+1)(Xi+1—xt)

x61

+ZW(Px,-ki+1)(xi —xi+1) (3)
xED

_ XVI/(173619141 )AXMiH
xEC

where A xi, xi H is a binary variable that takes the value 0 when x,- =xi+1 and
1 otherwise; this deﬁnition is enforced by adding the Boolean constraint
Axi,xi+1 : (xi XOR xi+1)~

The weights w(p) were calculated as (—logp), but using other functions
that mapped smaller P—values to a higher weight, e.g. w(p) = 1— p, did not
signiﬁcantly change the results. The logarithmic transformation was chosen
to minimize ill—conditioning for highly signiﬁcant changes. Using a unit
weighting function w(p)= 1 for all P—values would cause MADE to match
the greatest number of transitions without regard for the signiﬁcance of the
changes. The P—values were determined by t—test on the normalized array
data in accordance with standard microarray analysis procedures using the
GeneSpring software package (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
The objective function reaches its theoretical maximum when all calculated
expression states match the observed expression changes.

MADE maximizes the sum of the objective function values across all
conditions subject to a regulated FBA formalism:

Constraints (a) and (b) represent the mass balance, stoichiometric and
thermodynamic constraints of FBA. The metabolic objective (e.g. biomass
production) is required to be above a minimum value in (c) to ensure a
viable ﬂux distribution. Minimum values of 0.1—0.3 of the optimal objective
ﬂux have been used to ensure viability in FBA—based bacterial strain design
(Kim and Reed, 2010). The system of equations (d) contains an integer
programming formalism for the GPR rules and a set of constraints that couple
these rules to the metabolic ﬂuxes v. These constraints were formulated using
SR—FBA, as described above. A separate set of constraints (a—d) appear for
each experimental condition.

MADE was implemented in Matlab r2009a (The Mathworks, Natick,
MA, USA) using the genome—scale S.cerevisiae metabolic model iND750
(Duarte et al, 2004). The ﬁnal MILP problem was solved with the CPLEX
solver (ILOG, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) on an Intel dual—core desktop computer
running Linux. The MILP gap for all problems converged to less than 0.5%
in under 500 s.

3.4 Flux variability analysis

Solutions to the FBA problem are not unique, since several ﬂux distributions
can yield the unique optimal objective value. As a variation on FBA, Flux
Variability Analysis (FVA) captures the feasible range of reaction ﬂuxes that
satisfy an optimal objective value. The method calculates the minimum and
maximum allowable ﬂuxes through each reaction using the linear program

max / min v,-
subject to

Vobj = V:bj (C)

where (a) and (b) are the FBA constraints and 12:5 is the optimal value of
the objective ﬂux. FVA was used in calculations described below.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Expression data gathered from the glucose to glycerol shift in
the yeast S. cerevisiae are ideal candidates for MADE application.
Yeast treats glucose as its preferred carbon source, as evidenced
by the repression of genes catabolizing all other carbon sources in
glucose—rich media (Dickinson and Schweizer, 2004). After nearly
all available glucose has been exhausted, yeast begin a drastic
shift in the metabolic activity to initiate respiration of ethanol, the
fermentation product of glucose. The effects of this ‘diauxic shift’
extend beyond central carbon metabolism, as the organism also
slows production of amino acids and ribosomal—related proteins.
The demand for these metabolic byproducts is decreased by the
drastically slowed growth rate. Overall, nearly 1700 genes show
differential expression in this process, accounting for over 25% of
the yeast genome (DeRisi et al, 1997). [For review of the diauxic
shift, see Carlson (1999)]

While the metabolic effects of the diauxic shift are well studied,
the transition from glucose— to glycerol—based growth is less
understood. Roberts and Hudson used a series of microarrays to
measure expression changes at 15, 30 and 60 min following a

shift from glucose— to glycerol—rich media (Roberts and Hudson,
2006). The results indicated changes among expression levels
in a number of gene ontologies and several individual genes.
Integrating these data with a metabolic model would enable the
analysis of pathway—level and functional shifts in the metabolic ﬂux
distribution.

We used MADE to integrate these data with iND750, a fully
compartmentalized, genome— scale model of S. cerevisiae metabolism
(Duarte et al., 2004). A total of four environmental conditions were
considered: growth to early log phase in YPD (glucose—rich media);
and growth on YPG (glycerol—rich media) for 15, 30 and 60 min
after the switch from YPD. Expression states were calculated for
743 metabolic genes in the model (a sample of these results is
shown in Figure 2; complete results are shown in the Supplementary
Material). Figure 3 shows the overall gene expression levels grouped
by functional pathways. The expression levels for genes associated
with each reaction in the pathway were averaged as a measure
of overall subsystem—related transcriptional activity. The MADE—
derived binary approximations for several subsystems follow the
continuous expression patterns, although changes in measured
expression often appear more subtle than switches between ‘on’
and ‘off’ states. Speciﬁcally, expression levels in the fatty acid
and glutamate subsystems increase immediately after the glycerol
transition, and membrane/ion transport activity decreases near the
end of the transition period. All of these ﬁndings are consistent with
published conclusions (Roberts and Hudson, 2006).

4.1 Flexibility of metabolic subsystems

The models returned by MADE also recapitulate several of the
expected functional behaviors of the glucose/ glycerol shift. We used
FVA to characterize the metabolic ﬂexibility in each subsystem. The
heatmap in Figure 3 shows how the average range of admissible
ﬂuxes for each reaction in a subsystem changes during the shift.
High values indicate that the ﬂux through a subsystem can vary
signiﬁcantly while still achieving optimal growth. Lower values
correspond to tight metabolic regulation.

As seen in Figure 3, the FVA results are similar for the iND750
model in the YPD and YPG environments before applying gene
expression data. The MADE—calculated expression states change the
metabolic capabilities of the model at each time point. Thus, a binary
representation of gene expression enables multi—level resolution of
metabolic functionality when examined on the pathway level.

Yeast grown with an ample glucose supply strongly repress
catabolism of all other carbon sources (Dickinson and Schweizer,
2004). When glucose is removed, a genome—wide transcriptional
adjustment reactivates pathways involved in transport and utilization
of other nutrients. The MADE—generated models reﬂect this shift.
Cells grown in YPD display the smallest range in ﬂux variability,
corresponding to a tightly regulated metabolic state that is highly
optimized toward glucose utilization. After the shift to glycerol, the
ﬂux variability increases as the organism increases its metabolic
versatility.

MADE requires all calculated expression states to yield
functioning models, as deﬁned by a minimum ﬂux through the
objective reaction. The models of the glucose/glycerol shift were
required to produce at least 30% of their maximum objective ﬂux.
However, after integrating the expression data, the resulting models
were capable of producing 44, 44, 60 and 69% of the maximum

objective ﬂux for the 0, 15 , 30 and 60 min time points, respectively.
While requiring a minimum level of metabolic functionality does
change the gene states returned by MADE, the algorithm does not
appear to be overly sensitive to the chosen minimum objective value.

The 30% objective ﬂux threshold was chosen for this study to
capture many of the short-term changes in expression following
the transition in media. Previous work has shown that microbes
behave suboptimally shortly after such transitions and evolve to

match the in silica optimal solution after hundreds of generations
(Ibarra et al., 2002). Future studies could use MADE to generate
models that exhibit nearly optimal behavior by setting the objective
ﬂux threshold at a very high level (e. g. 90—99% of the optimal value).

4.2 Incorporating a transcriptional regulatory network

The differential expression initiated by the glucose to glycerol
switch is due in part to transcriptional regulation. In order to reﬁne
the MADE-generated models, we coupled the iND750 model with
iMH805, a transcriptional regulatory network previously assembled
from primary literature (Herrgard et al., 2006). The network consists
of 436 Boolean rules capturing expression relationships among
82 nutrients, 55 transcription factors and 750 metabolic genes.
The network was converted to a MILP system using the SR—FBA
formalism, and the resulting equations were added to the GPR
constraint set—no further modiﬁcation of the MADE algorithm
was necessary to calculate best ﬁt expression states for each of
the 55 transcription factors. The addition of the TRN changed
the MADE prediction for 578 (77.8%) of the metabolic genes
(see Supplementary Material). As expected, the network did help
reﬁne the MADE prediction: for example, EN 02, a phosphopruvate
hydratase, is known to be expressed in glycerol-based media (SGD).
Without the TRN, MADE predicted that only the related gene EN 01
would be expressed. With the TRN, MADE correctly identiﬁed both
ENOI and EN02 as being ‘on’.

4.3 Accuracy of MADE

As previously mentioned, the binary variables representing gene
expression in the FBA framework cannot describe all possible
expression patterns. Using the prototypic model in Figure 1 as
an example, the total number of comparisons is six (3 genes X 2
transitions). However, the number of feasible comparisons is only
ﬁve, since the binary description of right expression cannot increase
twice consecutively. Therefore, when measuring the ability of
MADE’s results to reproduce the expression change dynamics, it is
useful to also calculate the percent of feasible transitions matched.
The number of feasible matches can be calculated by running MADE
without the minimum metabolic objective constraint. This allows
MADE to ﬁt gene expression states without regard for overall model
functionality.

The fermentive/glycolytic shift data contained 2229 transitions,
of which 1885 were feasible. MADE matched 98.7% of the feasible
transitions (83.5% of all transitions). It is important to note that
the 15.4% of transitions that are infeasible are a consequence of
the binary representation of gene expression in FBA. Additionally,
the assumption in MADE that the statistical signiﬁcance of
differential gene expression correlates with biological signiﬁcance
does not always hold. Also, some of the correctly matched
transitions may not accurately reﬂect the true metabolic behavior.
The transitions in gene expression data are not necessarily a
completely accurate representation of the actual expression state
due to errors in the experimental data.

5 CONCLUSION

Our MADE algorithm integrates gene or protein expression data
and a metabolic model without a priari determination of activity
thresholds. MADE can be applied to any set of two or more

Normalized expression levels were averaged across all genes associated with the subsystem. For comparison, the same approach was applied to the binary

for reactions in the subsystem; ‘0’ is the smallest range. The ‘Models Only’ FVA results use the indicated media and no constraints on gene expression. The

to match most closely the genes that exhibit the most statistically
signiﬁcant changes in expression levels. The resulting gene states
always produce functioning models and match the direction
of differential expression with high accuracy. Results from the
glucose/glycerol shift in S. cerevisiase indicate that MADE-derived
models also recapitulate the overall behavior of the actual biological
system.
